Alcock, Dr. A.R. Anderson,\nDr. A.F.R. Hoernle, His Grace Archbishop Dr. Paul Goethals,\nDr. G.A. Grierson, Babu Pa\u00f1c\u0101nana Mukherjee, Pandit Harimohan Vidyabhushan, Babu Mahendranath R\u0101y, Pandit Harapras\u0101d \u010c\u0101stri,\nC.R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nVisitor:\u2014Monsieur A. Foucher.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nTwenty-six presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen duly proposed and seconded at the last meeting of the Society were ballotted for and elected ordinary members:\n\nR. Paget Dowhurt, Esq.\nRichard Burn, Esq.\nG. Place, Esq.\nDr. Arnold Caddy.\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next meeting:\n\nW. C. Macpherson, Esq., I. C.

Grierson, seconded by C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nThe following gentlemen have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\n\nMajor J. Hayes Sadler, B. S. C.\nDr. G. H. D. Gimlette, M.D.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited a personal relic of General Cunningham.\n\nPandit Haraprasad \u00c7\u0101stri exhibited a second set of Vi\u1e63\u1e47upur Circular Cards and read the following note.\n\nA single pack contains forty-eight cards, in twelve groups of four each. The first four have each a figure, which though apparently a female figure, on closer examination appears to be the figure of a Malla king dressed in female attire. This is the Ace. The second four have two wrestlers. These are valued at two. The third four have three leaves. The fourth four have four conch shells; the fifth, five flowers; the sixth, six carpet cushions; the seventh, seven swords; the eighth eight Bakula fruits; the ninth, nine full blown flowers; the tenth, ten plums. The eleventh four have each a horseman and the twelfth each an elephant rider. They are valued at 11 and 12 respectively.\n\nThe point of the game is this. He who gets the number seventeen first in a group of four players, wins the stakes. The cards are first shuffled then cut by the right-hand man, and one card is dealt to each player from right to left. Then the right-hand man is given another card. If he gets more than seventeen he loses the stakes and throws away his cards; if he gets seventeen he wins; if he gets less, he has the option of either demanding another card or allowing cards to be given to others. If nobody gets seventeen, nobody wins. If a man gets two horses, two elephants, two aces and two twos, he also wins.\n\nSome of the designs in this pack are the same as in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47upur Circular Cards already described in Journal, Part I, p. 284. But others are not. The elephant rider, the horseman, the wrestlers and the king in the Ace remind one of the \u0100\u015bvapatis, Gajapatis and\nNarapatis R\u0101jyatrav\u0101dhipatis so often mentioned in the inscriptions of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. On the Radical and Participial Tenses of the Modern Indo-Aryan Languages.\u2014By G. A. Grierson, Esq., Ph.D., C.I.E.\n   The paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. Chronology of the S\u0113na kings of Bengal.\u2014By Babu Nagendra-N\u0101tha Vasu.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nThough considerable research has been made to construct a genuine history of the S\u0113na kings, yet much remains to be done. The following conclusions are the abstract of the results of my perusal of the manuscripts of the D\u0101na-s\u0101gara, the K\u0101rik\u0101s of \u0112\u1e0d\u016b-mi\u00e7ra and Hari-mi\u00e7ra, and other books, the genealogy of the Candra-dvipa dynasty, and a newly discovered copper-plate.\n\n1. After the reign of \u0100di-\u00e7\u016bra and his descendants, the P\u0101la kings ascended the throne of Bengal. The S\u0113na kings flourished after the P\u0101la kings.\n\n2. Vijaya-s\u0113na's son, Ball\u0101la-s\u0113na, wrote the D\u0101na-s\u0101gara in 1169 A.D., and ruled Bengal for 50 years. After ascending the throne, Ball\u0101la set out for the conquest of Mithil\u0101, and while there, he heard the news of his son Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a's birth. There he inaugurated the Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a era in 1119, in commemoration of his son's birth.\n\n3. Ball\u0101la's son, Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na, established, after his father, kulinism among the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. He reigned for 27 or 28 years from 1170 to 1198-99 A.D., when Bengal was conquered by Mu\u1e25ammad-i-Bakhtiar.\n\n4. According to the \u0100in-i-Akbari, M\u0101dhava-s\u0113na and Ke\u00e7ava-s\u0113na ruled Bengal in succession, after their father Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na. But in my opinion they never ascended the throne. They were probably governors of provinces, or regents of their father, during his life-time. Following the advice of the Pandits, M\u0101dhava-s\u0113na left his father's kingdom, and went on a pilgrimage to Ked\u0101ran\u0101tha, a fact corroborated by the existence of a copper-plate grant of M\u0101dhava-s\u0113na in the Yog\u0113\u00e7vara temple near the city of Almora in Kum\u0101\u1e47.\n\n5. Ke\u00e7ava-s\u0113na, likewise, went away for fear of the Mu\u1e25ammadans, and took refuge in the court of some king,\u2014probably Vi\u00e7var\u016bpa-s\u0113na, another son of Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na, and described as the terrible destroyer of the Yavana dynasty in the copper-plate grant of the 14th year, noticed by me in the last meeting, and who I suppose formally ascended the throne in 1200 or 1201 A.D.\n6. According to the ancient K\u0101rik\u0101s of Kulac\u0101ryas, Danauj\u0101-m\u0101dhava, grandson of Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na established kulinism among the Brahmanas and Vangaja k\u0101yasthas. \u0100b\u016b-l-fa\u017cl mentions one R\u0101j\u0101 N\u014dj\u0101h as reigning after Sad\u0101-s\u0113na. This N\u014dj\u0101h, is no doubt, Danauj\u0101 of the K\u0101rik\u0101s and the Danauja R\u0101ya of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Firz-Sh\u0101hi. But none of them tells us his father's name. He is probably son and successor either of Vi\u00e7var\u016bpa or of Sad\u0101-s\u0113na. According to the genealogy of the Candra-Dvipa kings, Danauj\u0101-m\u0101dhava is the founder of that family. His fifth descendant Jaya-d\u0113va died without male issue, and so the kingdom passed to his daughter's son Param\u0101nanda of the Va\u1e47u family. After 7 R\u0101jas from Param\u0101nanda had succeeded to the throne, the son of the last king's sister, namely Udayanar\u0101ya\u1e47a of the Mitra family inherited the kingdom. His descendants are now living at M\u0101dhavap\u0101c\u0101.\n\n7. There was another king named Ball\u0101la, who was a Vaidya and reigned at Vikrama-pura, and is described by his teacher Gop\u0101l\u0101-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da in his 'Ball\u0101la-carita' written in 1378 A.D. This often leads to the error that the S\u0113na kings of Bengal were Vaidyas. Ball\u0101la-s\u0113na son of Vijaya-s\u0113na and father of Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na lived about 250 years previous to this Vaidya Ball\u0101la, who was probably a zam\u012bnd\u0101r of note, and at the time of the dismemberment of the kingdom of Bengal rose to some eminence.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\n\n---\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last:\u2014\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

R. S., President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\n\nMaulvi Abdus Salam, Dr. A. W. Alcock, H. K. W. Arnold, Esq., J. C. Bose, Esq., F. Finn, Esq., Dr. G. A. Grierson, Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, S. C. Laharry, Esq., C. Little, Esq., J. Mann, Esq., R. D. Mehta, Esq., W. H. Miles, Esq., B\u0101bu Pa\u00f1c\u0101nana Mukherjee, Dr. G.

Adie, B\u0101bu Jyoti Bh\u016b\u1e63an Bh\u0101dur\u012b.\n\nAccording to the Bye-laws of the Society, the President ordered the voting papers to be distributed for the election of Officers and Members of Council for 1896 and appointed Major R. C. Temple and Mr. J. C. Bose to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1895.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year:\u2014\n\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review 29 Ordinary Members were elected, 7 withdrew, 4 died, 16 were removed from the list, viz., 11 under Rule 38\nas defaulters, and 5 under Rule 40, being more than 3 years absent from India. The election of one Member was cancelled at his own request as he was contemplating an early return to Europe. Of the Members elected 2 were old Members who rejoined. The total number of Members at the close of 1895 was thus 297 against 295 at the end of the preceding year; of these 108 were Residents, 122 Non-Residents, 12 Foreign, 23 Life, 31 Absent from India and 1 Special Non-Subscribing Member, as will be seen from the following table which also shows the fluctuations in the numbers of Ordinary Members during the past six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |\n| 1890 | ... | 105 | 140 | 10 | 255 | 21 | 25 | 2 | 48 | 303 |\n| 1891 | ... | 101 | 134 | 10 | 245 | 21 | 27 | 2 | 50 | 295 |\n| 1892 | ... | 115 | 127 | 11 | 253 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 310 |\n| 1893 | ... | 116 | 123 | 12 | 251 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 306 |\n| 1894 | ... | 98 | 125 | 12 | 235 | 22 | 36 | 2 | 60 | 295 |\n| 1895 | ... | 108 | 122 | 12 | 242 | 23 | 31 | 1 | 55 | 297 |\n\nThe four Ordinary Members, the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Mr. Valentine Ball (special non-subscribing member), H. H. the Mahar\u0101j\u0101 of Johore, The Rev. D. G. Latham-Browne and Mr. A. M. Nash.\n\nThere were five deaths amongst the Honorary Members, viz., those of Professor Hermann L. E. Helmholtz, Professor T. H. Huxley, Monsieur Louis Pasteur, Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson and Dr. Rudolph von Roth. To fill these vacancies and others previously existing, the Society, on the recommendation of the Council, elected as Honorary Members, Dr. George B\u00fchler, The Right Honourable Lord Rayleigh, Lieutenant-General R. Strachey, and Mr. C. H. Tawney. Thus the number of Honorary Members stands at 21.\n\nIntimation of two deaths amongst the Corresponding Members was received, viz., Dr. R. G\u00f6sch of Berlin and Mr. A. von Kr\u00e4mer of Alexandria, the number now stands at 4.\nThe lists of Special Honorary Members and Associate Members continue unaltered from last year, there having been no casualties, their number standing at 5 and 10 respectively.\n\nDuring the year, one member, Mr. N. D. Beatson-Bell, compounded for his future subscriptions.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nThe following presentation made to the Society was transferred to the Indian Museum under the provisions of Act XXII of 1876.\n\nA Diorite plug found in the Banda District, presented by Mr. J. Cockburn and referred to in the Society's Proceedings for May and June 1894.\n\nThe Trustees on behalf of the Society were:\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nC. Little, Esq.\nDr. Mahendralal Sarkar.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe Accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1, in the Appendix, under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society and of different Funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1895 was taken at the following figures:\n\nReceipts Rs. 16,844; Expenditure Rs. 16,013.\n\nThe actual results were found to be:\u2014Receipts Rs. 18,166-6-11, Expenditure Rs. 13,080-5-11.\n\nThe Receipts show an increase of Rs. 1,322-6-11, while the Expenditure shows a decrease of Rs. 2,927-10-1 on the Budget Estimate.\n\nThere is an increase in Receipts under the heads of \"Subscriptions,\" \"Sale of Publications,\" \"Interest on Investments,\" \"Rent of Rooms\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Subscriptions\" and \"Miscellaneous\" show a very slight increase, but owing to the large sale of the Society's Journals and Proceedings, \"Sale of Publications\" shows an increase of Rs. 1,050-7-2. During the year, Temporary Investments were made and there is thus an increase of Rs. 183 under the head of \"Interest on Investments.\" \"Rent of Rooms\" also shows an increase of Rs. 60. This is due to the payment in this year by the Photographic Society of India of one month's rent in advance.\n\nOn the Expenditure side, the items of \"Stationery,\" \"Freight,\" \"Contingencies,\" \"Binding,\" \"Journal Part I,\" and \"Proceedings\" show an increase. Owing to new registers being required for the\nlibrary, there is an increase of Rs. 33-6-6 under the head of \"Stationery.\" The amount budgetted for under the head of \"Freight\" has been exceeded by Rs. 10-14-0, an additional box containing the Society's publications having been despatched to the London Agents. There is an increase of Rs. 154-6-9 under the head of \"Contingencies.\" This is due to the carting of good earth for the improvement of the Society's garden and to providing peons with new clothing for the cold weather. During the year, it was found necessary to bind many old works belonging to the Oriental Library, thus there is an increase of Rs. 81-12 under the head of \"Binding.\" \"Journal Part I\" was estimated for at Rs. 2,100 whilst the actual expenditure was Rs. 3,036-5-0. In February 1894, the Council sanctioned a special grant of Rs. 1,265 for the printing of Major Raverty's article on the \"Mihran of Sind and its Tributaries.\" As reported last year, Rs. 408-4-6 was spent for the printing of the maps only, leaving a balance of Rs. 756-11-6 unexpended. To meet the printing charges, the above balance has been freely drawn on for this purpose. \"Proceedings\" has exceeded its budget grant by Rs. 26-9-0. This is due to an extra plate.\n\nThere were two items of extraordinary expenditure during 1895 under the heads of \"Furniture\" and \"Registration Fees\" not provided for in the Budget. After the repairs to the Society's building, none of the book cases could be locked as the almirahs were not on a level and the necessary repairs cost Rs. 79-13-0. In accordance with section 4 of Act XXI of 1860, Rs. 95, was spent in Registration Fees for 19 years from 1877 to 1895.\n\nThe Actual expenditure on the \"Journal\" and \"Proceedings\" was as follows:\n\n|                | Part I     | Rs. 3,036 5 0 |\n|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| Journal        | Part II    | ... 1,537 9 6 |\n| Proceedings    |            | ... 1,026 9 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 5,600 7 6\n\nThis is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 2,599-8-6.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of probable ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1896 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 16,420. Expenditure Rs. 16,042.\n\nOn the Receipts' side, the estimated income under the head of \"Interest on Investments\" has been increased by Rs. 76 on account of the interest on Temporary Investments. The two years for which the Government of Madras sanctioned an allotment having expired, \"Government Allowance\" has been reduced by Rs. 500.\nOn the Expenditure side, the amount budgetted for under \"Freight\" has been increased by Rs. 20 to provide for the despatch of a greater number of cases of books for sale to the Society's agents.\n\nThere is an additional item of Rs. 5 under the head of \"Registration Fees\" which amount has to be paid yearly.\n\nBeyond the Auditor's fee, no other extraordinary expenditure is anticipated during 1896.\n\nThe details of Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n**Receipts**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions             | Rs. 7,000 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications      | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Interest on Investments   | Rs. 5,200 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms             | Rs. 720 0 0 |\n| Government Allowances     | Rs. 3,000 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 16,420 0 0\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries                  | Rs. 3,400 0 0 |\n| Commission                | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Pension                   | Rs. 52 0 0 |\n| Stationery                | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| Lighting                  | Rs. 40 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes           | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage                   | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Freight                   | Rs. 30 0 0 |\n| Meetings                  | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Contingencies             | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Books                     | Rs. 1,500 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals         | Rs. 16 0 0 |\n| Binding                   | Rs. 500 0 0 |\n| Journal Part I            | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" II                      | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" III                     | Rs. 3,000 0 0 |\n| Proceedings               | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Printing circulars, &c.   | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Registration Fees         | Rs. 5 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 16,042 0 0\nLondon Agency.\n\nThe number of copies of parts of the Journals, of the Proceedings, and of the Bibliotheca Indica, sent to Messrs.

The Council sanctioned in the year 1884, the publication of the English translation of the first volume of Muntakhabu-t-Tawarikh by Abdul Qadir, the Badaoni. It was arranged that it should be prepared uniformly with Mr. Lowe's translation of the second volume then in the course of preparation. Maulvi Abul Khair of the Madrasah College was requested to take the work in hand. For various reasons the editor could not commence work, and the work was kept in abeyance. Last year Dr. George Ranking accepted the editorship, and he has published his first fasciculus with copious annotations, Fasc. I.\nB. Sanskrit Series.\n\n1. The Aitar\u0113ya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is, next to the Rg Veda, the most ancient Sanskrit work known, consequently it attracted the attention of Oriental Scholars very early. Haug published an edition of the work about 40 years ago. But he could not procure a commentary. Pandit Satyavrata S\u0101ma\u00e7rami was therefore requested to undertake an edition with S\u0101yan's commentary. He has published five fasciculi during the year, Vol. I, Fasc. IV and V; Vol. II, Fasc. I to III.\n\n2. Pandits Yog\u0113\u015bvara Sm\u1e5btiratna and K\u0101makhy\u0101n\u0101tha Tarkav\u0101gi\u1e47a completed the second part of the third volume of the Caturvarga-Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i. This brings the Pari\u1e63\u0113\u1e63a Kha\u1e47\u1e0da or Miscellaneous Volume to an end. Vol. III, Part III, Fasc. X.\n\n3. The Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali-prakarana has been completed by Mah\u0101mah\u014dpadhy\u0101ya Candrak\u0101nta Tark\u0101lank\u0101ra with a commentary and a commentary on the commentary. The Editor in his preface makes an attempt to fix the date of the great teachers of the Ny\u0101ya philosophy. Vol. II, Fasc. III.\n\n4. Professor Dr. Alfred Hillebrand of Breslau has published only one fasciculus, namely, Vol. II, Fasc. III of the \u010crauta S\u016btra of \u010c\u0101mkh\u0101yana. This volume gives the commentary of \u0100narttiya, son of Varadatta.\n\n5. Since the transfer of the editorship of the Taittiriya \u015a\u0101hita by Mah\u0101mah\u014dpadhy\u0101ya Mah\u0113\u1e63a Candra Ny\u0101yaratna to Pandit Satyavrata S\u0101ma\u00e7rami the work is progressing at the rate of one Fasciculus a year. The Fasciculus published last year is No. XXXVIII.\n\n7. The Tattva-cint\u0101ma\u1e47i also has advanced by one fasciculus only, namely, Vol. V, Fasc. I. This is the first fasciculus of the last Kha\u1e47\u1e0da or part dealing with the evidential value of speech.\n\n8. The Madhyakha\u1e47\u1e0da of the V\u1e5bhad-dharma-pur\u0101\u1e47a has been completed. In two more fasciculi the work will be concluded. Fasc. V. was published during the year.\n\n9. The Svayambh\u016b-pur\u0101\u1e47a has also advanced by one fasciculus only, namely the fourth.\n\nC. Tibetan Series.\n\n1. The Sanskrit and Tibetan edition of the Kalpalat\u0101 advanced by two fasciculi, namely Vol. I, Fasc. V, and Vol. II Fasc. IV, under the joint editorship of R\u0101y \u010carat Candra D\u0101s, C.I.E., Bah\u0101dur, and Pandit Harimohan Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63ana.\n\n2. Babu Prat\u0101pa Candra Ghose has published one part of the Sher Phyin, namely Vol. III, Fasc. I. As he omits all the passages which are often repeated, there is a prospect of the work coming\nto a speedy close. The publication of the C\u0101t\u0101s\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101, of which this is a Tibetan translation, otherwise would have been as great an undertaking as the publication of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\n\nList of all Societies, Institutions, &c., to which the Publications of the Asiatic Society have been sent during the year, or from which publications have been received.\n\n* Societies, &c., which have received the Asiatic Society's publications, and have sent their publications in return.\n\u2020 Societies, &c., which have received the Asiatic Society's publications, but have sent none in return.\n\u00a7 Societies, &c., whose publications have been received, but to which nothing has been sent in return.\n\n* Allahabad:\u2014Editor, Pioneer.\n\u2020 Amsterdam:\u2014Royal Zoological Society.\n\u2020 \u2014\u2014\u2014:\u2014Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen.\n* Angers:\u2014Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d' \u00c9tudes Scientifiques d' Angers.\n* Baltimore:\u2014Johns Hopkins University.\n* Batavia:\u2014Society of Arts and Sciences.\n* \u2014\u2014\u2014:\u2014Kon.

S., President, in the chair.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThirty-seven presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen duly proposed and seconded at the last meeting of the Society were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members:\n\nW. C. Macpherson, Esq., I. C. S.\nSurgeon-Lieutenant Charles E. Williams, I. M. S.\n\nThe Council reported that in consequence of the deaths of:\u2014Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Professor T. H. Huxly, Professor Hermann L. E. Helmholtz, Dr. Rudolph von Roth, and Monsieur Leonis\nPasteur, there were now four vacancies in the list of the Honorary Members. The Council therefore recommended the four following gentlemen for election as Honorary Members at the next meeting:\n\nSir Joseph Lister, Bart., P. R. S., Surgeon Extraordinary to the Queen, Professor of Clinical Surgery in King's College, London, is the author of numerous papers on Surgical Pathology and Histology, but is celebrated, before all, as the great originator and exponent of the Antiseptic System of Surgery, a system that has not only revolutionized surgery and reformed Hospital Hygiene, but also has had a beneficial influence on every other branch of Medicine.\n\nIn the history of the antiseptic reformation, Sir Joseph Lister was the foremost to recognize, first, that septic changes in wounds are of the nature of fermentations, and are due to the advent and multiplication within wounds of organic germs; and secondly, that these germs find their surest and most favourable abode in places where the wounded are improperly crowded together.\n\nThe \"antiseptic treatment\" initiated by Sir Joseph Lister was aimed more at the destruction of the germs in the neighbourhood of any given wound; but with the spread and acceptance of Listerian principles the treatment became more and more directed towards removing the conditions under which the germs were found to exist, until to-day the antiseptic treatment is not so much a matter of special surgical technique as a matter of scrupulous sanitary cleanliness. But the wide reforms in the care of the sick which this strict sanitary observance has brought about are the direct and obvious outcome of the original antiseptic teaching of Sir Joseph Lister.\n\nProfessor Michael Foster, Secretary of the Royal Society, Professor of Physiology in the University of Cambridge, is the author of numerous papers on pure physiology as well as on histology, but is specially known by his Text Book of Physiology, and for his influential labours in the cause of scientific education at Cambridge University.\n\nThe Text Book of Physiology is, practically, original work\u2014original in its treatment of the subject, and above all original in its wealth of philosophical suggestion. It is not too much to say of the earlier editions of that work that they have had a deep influence far beyond the limits of their special field of education, and that their introductory and few closing chapters, without departing from strictly physiological ground, exhibit physiology at its highest level as a branch of learning.\n\nProfessor F. Kielhorn Ph.D., C.I.E., now Professor of Sanskrit in the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, formerly Professor of Oriental Languages in the Deccan College in British India. He is equally distinguished by his intimate knowledge of Sanskrit Grammar and of\nIndian Epigraphy and Palaeography. In the former department he has published in English, an excellent Sanskrit Grammar for students which has been translated into German by Dr. Solf. His edition of the Vy\u0101karana Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya of Pata\u00f1jali is a standard work on Sanskrit Grammar. He has contributed numerous valuable papers on Indian Epigraphical subjects to our own Journal, as well as the Indian Antiquary, the Epigraphia Indica and other learned periodicals. The British Government has acknowledged his eminence as an Oriental scholar by the bestowal on him of the honour of a C.I.E.\n\nProfessor Charles Rockwell Lanman, Professor of Sanskrit in the Harvard College, Cambridge, in the United States of America. He is\u2014since the death of Professor W. D. Whitney of the Yale University\u2014the most distinguished Sanskrit scholar in America. He is the author of a very excellent Sanskrit Reader with Vocabulary and Notes, and has published numerous valuable papers on a variety of points touching the grammar and religion of the Vedas as well as Indian subjects generally, which were contributed to the Journals of the American Oriental Society and other learned Societies, our own included. He is also one of the Secretaries of the first-named Society.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next meeting:\n\nF. MacBlaine, Esq., I.C.S., Nowgong, proposed by Dr. G. A. Grierson, seconded by C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nMaulvi Abdul Karim, B.A., Assistant Inspector of Schools for Muhammedan Education, Presidency Circle and Orissa Division, proposed by Maulvi Abdul Wali, seconded by Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\n\nT. N. Das, Esq., B.A., (Oxon.) Bar-at-Law, Assistant Professor, Hooghly College, proposed by S. C. Laharry, Esq., seconded by Dr. G. A. Grierson.\n\nSat\u012bc Candra Banerjie, Esq., M.A., LL.B., proposed by S. C. Laharry, Esq., seconded by Dr. G. A. Grierson.\n\nC. H. Bompas, Esq., proposed by Dr. G. A. Grierson, seconded by C. R.

On Irregular Causal Verbs in the Indo-Aryan Vernaculars.\u2014By G. A. Grierson, Esq., C.I.E., Ph.D.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn the formation of causal verbs, in the Vernaculars of Central and Western India, certain verbs insert \\(d\\), \\(r\\), \\(l\\), or \\(n\\) before or after the causal suffix. Examples are Gujar\u0101t\u012b bes-\u0101-d, 'cause to sit;' Sindhi, sikh\u0101-r 'teach;' Hindi, di-l-\u0101, 'cause to give;' K\u0101\u00e7miri, pak-an-\u0101v, 'cause to go.' The origin of these inserted letters has hitherto been considered obscure.\n\nThe author points out that recent comparative philology shows that in Sanskrit many verbal roots took nominal suffixes before adding the personal terminations. Examples are kri-\u1e47\u0101-ti, 'he buys,' su-\u1e47\u014dti, 'he squeezes,' mr\u1e47a-ti, 'he kills,' krp-anya-ti, 'he is a suppliant,' l\u0101-la-ya-ti 'he causes to adhere.' Sometimes these suffixes give a causal force to the root, and sometimes, so far as meaning goes, they are merely pleonastic.\n\nThe author next shows that some modern Indo-Aryan roots have certainly taken similar pleonastic suffixes. As an example, he takes the Sanskrit drava-ti 'he runs,' and shows that in some languages, it takes \\(k\\), in others \\(g\\), in others \\(r\\), in others \\(d\\) or \\(r\\), and, in one, both \\(g\\) and \\(r\\); so that we find the forms\n\n(1) druk, d\u014dk, daug,\n(2) d\u014dr, d\u014dr, daur,\n(3) dugur, all of which mean 'run.'\n\nHe finally explains the consonants inserted in modern causals, by stating that they have a similar origin.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\n2.

On the transformation of hypochlorites into chlorates.\u2014By Babu Yati Bhushan Bhaduri, M.A., Premcand Raycand Scholar. Communicated by the President.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn the preliminary portion the various methods of estimating chlorates and hypochlorites have been carefully examined. Direct estimation of both in a mixture containing the same have been found possible by distillation in moderately dilute solution with pure phosphoric acid and then the residue with fuming hydrochloric acid. Hypochlorites can not be estimated in acid solutions (with KI and HCl) in presence of chlorates.\n\nThe action of chlorine on sodio hydrate is ascertained by passing the washed gas through a solution of the hydrate. Owing to considerable change of volume consequent on absorption, the amount of sodium is determined afterwards. The total chlorine is determined by reduction with zinc copper couple and the hypochlorite by Penot's, or distillation method. From numerous experiments it is found that the amount of chlorate which is formed in solution up to 7 per cent. of concentration and containing free alkali is insignificant. Above 10 per cent. solution, however, the secondary reaction\u2014transformation\u2014becomes more distinct and when the concentration exceeds 20 per cent., time becomes an important factor. Presence of free alkali retards the change.\n\nTo study the transformation, the solution of known strength is kept in stoppered bottles or sealed tubes and then exposed to rays of different degrees of refrangibility or kept in absolute darkness. After the required time the contents are analysed (the volume of oxygen also determined). The results of the analyses prove that a solution of sodium hypochlorite slowly decomposes even when kept in absolute darkness. The rate of decomposition increases as the refrangibility of the rays increases. Yellow rays are far more active than the red. The change is one into chlorate and free oxygen. If there be little or no free alkali, chlorine is simultaneously liberated.\n\nWhen the change takes place at about 100\u00b0 C. strong sealed glass\ntubes are used. Comparing the percentage decomposition of a number of solutions in which the relative quantities of free alkali, chloride, chlorate and hypochlorite are the same, the following peculiarities are observed. The decomposition diminishes with dilution up to a certain point when it is minimum. Further diminution in concentration instead of diminishing increases decomposition. This peculiar deportment is observed not only with similar solutions heated to different periods of time, but in all solutions which are examined, the ratio of hypochlorite to free alkali being approximately as $2:5$, $2:2$ and $2:1$. When the percentage decompositions are represented by curves whose ordinates express percentage decompositions and abscissa concentrations, greatest depressions (minimum decompositions) lie very nearly in the same vertical line. The exact strength of the solution which decomposes least is not yet known with great accuracy, but it appears to lie between $1.5$ to $1.7$ per cent. of concentration. The influence of other constituents may be neglected as all the solutions containing widely different quantities of chlorate, hypochlorite and free alkali lead to the same conclusion. In all cases oxygen and chlorate are simultaneously produced. At the end of the first hour the amount of oxygen that is liberated varies from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the oxygen fixed in the chlorate. As the duration of heating is prolonged the quantity of free oxygen is increased, but in no case is this quantity greater than the oxygen of the chlorate although the strength of the solution is seen to vary from $3$ to $8.9$ per cent. and duration of heating from one to six hours and a half. As the strength of the solution diminishes the liberation of free oxygen increases. For the same weight of chlorate formed, the quantity of oxygen diminishes with the rapidity with which the solutions are heated.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in February last:\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,** presented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nCalcutta.

Rost (Honorary Member).\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following obituary notice of the death of Dr. R. Rost, an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nOur Society has to mourn his loss of one of its most distinguished Honorary members who has recently died very suddenly\u2014Dr. Reinhold Rost, who was till within a short time of his death occupied actively in work connected with Oriental language and literature. On the 7th February last, Dr. Rost was at Canterbury in the performance of duties connected with St. Augustine's College, where he lectured weekly, when death put an end to his labours, and completed a life spent in the service of the languages and literature of the East. Reinhold Rost was born seventy-four years ago in a small manufacturing town in the duchy of Saxe-Altenberg. He was the son of a Lutheran minister holding the Office of Archdeacon. He was educated at the University of Jena where he graduated as Ph. D. in 1847, and almost immediately after taking his degree proceeded to England, where he had been offered a small teaching appointment, at the institution above referred to, as Oriental lecturer.\n\nIn 1864 he became Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, and in 1869 was appointed librarian to the India Office in succession to Dr. Fitz Edward Hall, which post he held till 1893, when he was succeeded by the present librarian Mr. Tawney whose name is so honourably known to us all in this Society. \"Dr. Rost will long be remembered\" says the Academy in its obituary notice, \"as the ideal librarian to the India Office. Though primarily a Sanskritist, he had to consider the claims of Arabic and Persian, of Pali, Burmese, and Sinhalese, of Tibetan and Malay, and of countless vernaculars. Of all these languages he had a competent knowledge, and he had further to give his attention to questions relating to archaeology, ethnology, and Indian history. In brief Dr. Rost elected to turn himself into an oriental encyclopaedia which no one ever consulted in vain.\"\n\nHe was subsequently elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society a distinction reserved by that Society for thirty only of the leading orientalists of the world, and still more recently became Member of the Council.\nThe India Office Library practically owes its existence in its present form to Reinhold Rost, and even after his somewhat enforced retirement in 1893, he continued to do much useful work in an unofficial capacity for the institution in which the real interest of his life was centred. \"Above all things\" says the Athen\u00e6um \"the India Office Library became under him, as the Asiatic Society was before, the natural and regular resort of all students of the East, old and young who might be visiting London; and they could not come away without feeling that they had profited by his profound knowledge, ready counsel, and genial sympathy.\"\n\nDr. Rost wrote little under his own name. His first publication was an Essay on the Hind\u00fb Sources of Burmese law (1850), and he also compiled a catalogue of the palm-leaf MSS. in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg, 1852). He however was the hidden source of much that has issued from other men inspired by his learning and encouragement, he was also the editor of H. H. Wilson's selected works, of Brian Hodgson's Collected Papers, and of four volumes of Miscellanies relating to Indo-China.\n\nIn conjunction with M. Nicholas Tr\u00fcbner, whose valued friend he was, a series of \"Simplified Grammars\" was planned and edited by Dr. Rost.\n\nPublic recognition of his vast attainments came in the form of honorary degrees from various universities, Edinburgh conferring upon him the LL.D., while Oxford made him an M.A. Honoris Caus\u00e2, a distinction attainable by very few. Prussia, Russia and Sweden gave him decorations and in 1888 he was appointed a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. He married in 1863, and leaves a son who is a sculptor of eminence. The bust of Mr. Tawney now standing in the vestibule of the Senate House of the Calcutta University is ample testimony for all here to the skill of Reinhold Rost's son who executed it; none who have seen it, and knew the original, can fail to be struck with the fidelity of the portrait in marble. Dr. Rost was elected to the Honorary Membership of this our Society in March 1894, and by his death we feel that our Society has lost one of the most distinguished of those men whom it has been its pride to enrol among its Members in acknowledgment of their life-devotion to the sacred cause of scientific advancement, and in testimony of the value placed by this Society upon the results of their life's work.\n\nThe Philological Secretary also read the following report, dated 29th November, 1895, submitted by Dr. G. A. Grierson to the Government of Bengal, General Department, on his investigation at Bodh-Gaya.\nDated Howrah, the 29th November, 1895.\n\nFrom\u2014G. A. Grierson, Esq., Ph. D., c. i. e., Magistrate of Howrah,\nTo\u2014The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, General Department.\n\nWith reference to your No. 408 T.G., dated the 31st October, 1895,\nI have the honour to report, that I left this for Bodh-Gay\u0101 on the 9th\ninstant, and examined the masons' marks referred to.\n\n2. I now beg to forward herewith a report of what I saw there.\nI regret that it is not more satisfactory.\n\n3. I may add that I have consulted Dr. Hoernle, and he has\nauthorised me to state that he agrees with the conclusions arrived at by\nme.\n\nREPORT.\n\nDr. B\u00fchler, in his study on the Indian Br\u0101hma alphabet (page\n30), refers to a discovery of Sir A. Cunningham at Bodh-Gay\u0101 in the\nfollowing terms:\u2014\n\n\"In the cloistered walk, which Asoka erected over the supposed\nCakrama of Buddha, there is a double row of pillars, eleven on each\nside, which bear the following letters*\u2014\"\n\n\"On the south side\u2014a, \u0101, i, u, \u1e5b, e, ai, o, au, a\u1e25.\"\n\n\"On the north side\u2014ta, \u1e6da, jha, ja, cha, ca, \u1e0da, gha, ga, kha, ka.\"\n\n\"The characters, of which some specimens are given, op. cit. Plate\nX, No. 1, are of the same type as those of Asoka's Edicts.\u2020 They are,\nno doubt, masons' marks, and intended for numbering the pillars ac-\ncording to the simplest and most natural system of notation by means\nof the letters. As the Indian masons are neither great scholars nor\nquite illiterate,\u2021 it may be assumed that the alphabet, which they used,\nis the popular one of the elementary schools of the day. As far as it\ngoes, it closely agrees in its character with that still taught in the\nmodern indigenous schools, and omits, like it, and like the alphabet of\nthe Lalita vistara, the vowels r, \u1e5b, l, \u1e0d. If it omits also the eleventh\nvowel a\u1e43, giving a\u1e25 in its place, that is no doubt due to a mistake of\n\n* Cunningham, Mah\u0101bodhi Gay\u0101, page 8; Plates V, No. 3, and X, No. 1.\n\u2020 It will be shown below that the ga with the round top and the peculiar cha,\nwhich they contain, occur also in the Edicts.\n\u2021 The Indian masons, the Sutradh\u0101ras or Vardhakins of the older literature and\nthe Sile\u1e6d\u1e6das of our days, occupy an intermediate position between the Aryan and the\nS\u016bdra classes. They wore, and still wear, the sacred thread, and they once possess-\ned, and still possess, a small amount of Sanskrit learning. The rules of their craft,\nwhich they commit to memory, are written in Sanskrit, and are at present largely\nmixed with Prakrit and barbarous bastard forms.\nthe engraver; for no alphabet could be without this m\u0101trika, least of all that of A\u015boka's times, when Anusv\u0101ras were used very extensively.\n\n\"Sir A. Cunningham's discovery possesses, as he himself has pointed out, considerable importance for the history of Indian writing. The masons' alphabet, with its diphthongs ai and au, the Visarga in the group a\u1e6d and the guttural ya, deals a heavy blow to the theory, according to which the writing of the third century B.C. and earlier times served merely the purposes of the Prakrit dialects. It is as plain as possible that this alphabet has been framed for the requirements of Sanskrit, and it is at least highly probable that its formation is due to the Brahmans, whose influence and peculiar theories are also recognizable, as will appear further on, in the manner of the derivation of the secondary signs from the original ones. In the third century B.C., it appears the state of things in the elementary schools was the same as in our days. The children learnt an alphabet which was not intended for their vernacular dialects, and this was no doubt due to the circumstance that already then (as later, when the legend regarding Buddha's Brahminical writing-master, Visv\u0101mitra, arose, and also in modern times) the elementary instruction was chiefly in the hands of the Brahmans, who did not think it worthwhile to alter, for the sake of their Prakrit-speaking pupils, the alphabet invented and suited for the peculiar bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 of their schools and class.\"\n\nAs I knew Bodh-Gaya pretty well, and had no memory of this important series of masons' marks, I visited that place, under instructions of the Bengal Government, in the middle of November, and examined the pillar, or rather pillar bases, referred to by Dr. B\u00fchler, with some minuteness. Sir A. Cunningham's description* is as follows:\n\n\"This cloistered walk, which still exists close to the north side of the Temple, is a simple brick wall, 53 feet long, 3 feet 6 inches broad, and a little more than 3 feet in height. On each side there is a row of 11 Persepolitan pillar bases, of the well-known pattern of a vase placed above three or four steps and surmounted by a parabolic moulding with an octagonal top for the reception of an octagonal shaft. Each of these bases was marked with a separate letter of the A\u015boka alphabet, the 11 bases on the south side bearing the 11 vowels a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, e, ai, o, au, ah, and the northern bases the first 11 consonants k, kh, g, gh, ng, ch, chh, j, jh, ny, t. In Plate V [of Mah\u0101bedhi], I have given one of the Bharhut bas-reliefs, which I feel certain must be a representation of one of these covered walks. In the same plate I have given a view of the remains of Buddha's walk at Mah\u0101bodhi. The whole length of the walk is given with the northern row of pillar bases still in situ,\n\n* Mah\u0101bedhi, page 8.\nand the broken shaft placed on the end base. The walk itself was still visible in Huen Thsang's time (A.D. 640); but the pillar bases were then covered by a plastered terrace. This arrangement of letters has an important bearing on the antiquity of the Indian alphabet, as it shows that the several characters had already been arranged in their present groups as gutturals, palatals, cerebrals, dentals, labials, semi-vowels and sibilants. The southern row of these bases was partly hidden under the basement of the Great Temple which had been built over them on a slightly different alignment, part of the two most westerly bases alone appearing 7 inches outside the wall, while all the easterly bases were completely covered.\n\n\"As these pillar bases showed that the walk had once been roofed over, I made diligent search for some remains of the pillars, and I was fortunate enough to light upon an octagonal shaft with a female figure on it, which had been brought to light by Mr. Beglar's excavations. On measuring the bottom of the shaft, I was delighted to find that it was of the same dimensions as the recessed tops of the bases. The westerly base of the southern row, which bore the Asoka letter A, was therefore extracted and when the octagonal shaft was set upon it, it was found to fit so exactly that there could be no doubt that the two pieces belonged to the same pillar. This proved to be the case when, turning the shaft round for a better view, it was found to be marked with the same letter A as the base on which it was then standing. No fragments of other shafts have yet been found.\"\n\nSir A. Cunningham gives photographic fac-similes of the letters on Plate X, fig. 1, of his work, and on page 16 annotates this illustration in the following terms:\n\n\"At the top of the plate, fig. 1, I have given fac-similes of the Asoka letters found on the Persepolitan pillar bases of Buddha's walk. The first two are the vowel a on the base and its shaft; the third letter, k, was found on the first base of the northern line, opposite a. The remaining letters, g, chh, j and t, were found on the 3rd, 7th, 8th and 11th bases of the same line. The other letters were lost owing to the breaking of the edges or lips of the upper parts of the bases.\"\n\nI now proceed to describe what I myself saw. As my account will differ from that of Sir A. Cunningham's in important particulars, casts of the entire row of pillar bases will be deposited in their original order in the Indian Museum, so as to enable scholars to judge for themselves.\n\nIn his \"Mah\u0101bodhi\" (Plate V), Sir A. Cunningham gives what purports to be an accurate plan to scale of Buddha's C\u0101\u1e47kama as he saw it. As this plan is not correct for the C\u0101\u1e47kama as it now stands, I give in figure 1 a new plan drawn to scale by the overseer in charge of the Temple.\nThe row of pillar bases on the south side, mentioned by Cunningham, is no longer visible. In the process of repairing the Great Temple most of them have been left buried within the walls of its foundation. This may be presumed from Cunningham's description, and is borne out by the statement of Jagann\u0101th Singh, the custodian of the Temple on behalf of the Mahant, who was there when the repairs were going on.*\n\nIn my plan the supposed original sites of these southern bases are indicated by dotted squares, and the line of the Temple wall is shown. According to General Cunningham, this southern line of bases was lettered as follows in the Br\u0101hma (or so called P\u0101li) alphabet:\n\n| Number of base | ... | 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. |\n|----------------|-----|----------------------------------|\n| Letter         | ... | a\u1e25, au, ai, \u0101, \u0101, u, i, \u012b, \u0101, a. |\n\nHe states, however, that the only letter which survived was that on No. 1, viz., a (H). This pillar-base was sent by General Cunningham to the Indian Museum, where it deposited in the A\u015boka gallery, and is numbered in the catalogue AR. It bears the letter a (H) clearly cut upon it, but lying on its side, thus (C). There are deposited alongside of this pillar-base two step-like plinths of what were apparently similar bases (catalogue mark, ST). These are very possibly all that remained of the bases which General Cunningham said bore the letters \u0101 and i. Regarding the letters on the remaining pillar-bases he says that they have all chipped off. It is impossible to check his statement, for the bases are no longer visible. Is is not improbable that Nos. 2 to 7 bore the letters attributed to them, but I cannot understand on what authority he makes out that No. 8 bore ai, that No. 10 bore au, and that No. 11 bore a\u1e25, or on what authority he omits the vowels r, \u1e5b, l, or \u1e0d. The last four have just as much right to appear as a\u1e25. The diphthong ai\u2020 is a very rare letter, and no instance of the existence of au is known to occur elsewhere.\n\nThe letter a\u1e25 does not occur in the P\u0101li language. It only occurs in Sanskrit, so that if it existed on any one of these pillar-bases, it would prove that Sanskrit was a written language at the time when the masons made the mark. In order to locate it on the eleventh base, besides omitting the letters r, \u1e5b, l, \u1e0d, which do not occur in P\u0101li, General Cunningham has had to omit the very common P\u0101li letter am (anust\u0101ra).\n\n* It is, however, stated by him that only the first (a) base was unearthed from the foundations, and that the remaining bases on that side were never seen by General Cunningham. As a matter of fact, General Cunningham sent the a base, and, possibly, the plinths of the two next ones, to the Indian Museum.\n\n\u2020 The only instances of the occurrence of ai which I know of are in the word \u015b\u0101ra which appears three times in the Girn\u0101r rock inscription. It usually appears in P\u0101li under the form \u0101.\nIt is beyond the bounds of probability that, in writing the vowels in alphabetical order, the masons should have omitted so common a letter, and have substituted in its place a letter hitherto not met with in the alphabet. In my opinion, if there was originally any letter on the eleventh southern base, it must have been \\(a\\), not \\(a\\). At any rate, Sir A. Cunningham never saw any letter on the eleventh base at all, and, owing to the disappearance of the base inside the wall of the great Temple, it is impossible to find out the grounds of his statement.\n\nRegarding the alleged existence of \\(a\\) on No. 8, and of \\(a\\) on No. 10, though there is no proof of their ever having been there, their existence is not impossible. The testimony of the Girnar rock Edict show that \\(a\\), though rarely used, did exist in A\u015boka's P\u0101li, and if \\(a\\) existed, there is no reason for \\(a\\) not also existing, though no instances of its existing are known to occur. At any rate, whether they were there or not, their presence there does not prove that, at the time of their inscription, Sanskrit was a written language.\n\nThe northern row of pillar-bases is still in existence and is accessible for examination. Sir A. Cunningham does not say that he or Mr. Beglar found them in the sites that they now occupy. They may have been found lying about amid the d\u00e9bris of the ruins, and put up where they are now by Mr. Beglar. I enquired from old servants of the Mahan\u0101th, and from Jagann\u0101th Singh, already referred to, who informed me that they were found in situ. At the same time, I must point out that base No. 2 is not of the same design as the rest. The vase itself and the top are octagonal and not round, and the moulding between the top and the vase is smaller and of a different pattern. Possibly it was substituted after the original pillars were erected, during one of the many repairs which the Temple and its precincts have undergone.\n\nAccording to Sir A. Cunningham, this row of bases was lettered as follows in the Br\u0101hma alphabet:\n\n| Number of base | ... | 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. |\n|----------------|-----|----------------------------------|\n| Letter         | ... | \\(ta, \\tilde{na}, jha, ja, cha, ca, ya, gha, ga, kha, ka.\\) |\n\nOf these, according to Cunningham, only the letters on Nos. 1 (\\(ka\\)), 3 (\\(ga\\)), 7 (\\(cha\\)), 8 (\\(ja\\)) and 11 (\\(ta\\)) had, in his time, survived. The others had been chipped off. I find on inspection that there are now no letters on numbers 3 (\\(ga\\)), 8 (\\(ja\\)) and 11 (\\(ta\\)). If these existed in Cunningham's time on the bases mentioned by him, they have since been chipped off.\n\nOn the other hand, No. 5 distinctly bears a letter shaped thus \\( \\text{\\textbackslash} \\), which does not belong to the P\u0101li alphabet, unless it is a\nFig. 2.

According to Cunningham this base (No. 5) should have borne the Br\u0101hma letter ga, which, though very rare, occurs under the form \\( \\bigcirc \\).\n\nAs this point is of some importance for the purposes of palaeography, I give in figure 2 a reproduction of Cunningham's representation of the rubbings of the letters taken by him, and in figure 3 a photograph (actual sizes) of the rubbings taken by me.\n\nThe ga with the round top represented by General Cunningham, occurs, according to Dr. B\u00fchler, once in the Delhi Siw\u0101lik column (Ed. VII), and in all inscriptions of the second century B.C. Its form (together with that of cha, to be noted later on) is of importance as proving the date of the masons' marks. But did it ever exist here? I cannot believe that so acute an observer as General Cunningham should not have noticed the perfectly plain mark on No. 5, and it appears to me to be most probable that the round topped ga which he gives is (whatever letter it represents) merely a faulty impression of the square topped letter on No. 5, and that, led by his reading it as ga, he has, by a slip of memory, located it on No. 3, where ga ought to have existed. I may add that No. 3 is now so badly damaged that I do not think it likely that any letter could have been visible on it so comparatively short a time ago as General Cunningham's last visit.\n\nAs to what this angular topped letter on No. 5 is, I do not like to give any decided opinion. It is certainly not \\( \\Gamma \\), as hitherto known, which should appear on that base (if it is arranged in alphabetical order). It might possibly represent \\( bha \\) with the right hand top appendage worn away, but this is the 23rd consonant of the Indian alphabet, and would be altogether out of place. It may also be a later development of a round topped ga, but I know no other similar case i.e. the ancient A\u1e63\u1e6daka alphabet, though it occurs in later alphabets, especially in the old P\u0101li alphabet of the Burmese. In this case the mark (if the bases are in alphabetical order) should be on the third, and not on the fifth base, and either the bases were not originally in alphabetical order, or their order was changed at some time subsequent to their erection. In the first alternative, the whole theory of the masons' marks representing an alphabetical order falls to the ground. In\nthe other case, if the position of this base has been altered, the position of other bases may have been altered too, and, as evidence of the order of the ancient Br\u0101hma alphabet, the whole row of bases is valueless.\n\nUnless, therefore, the letter on No. 5 can be shown to be some Br\u0101hma form of ya, with which I am unacquainted, these masons' marks prove nothing. Dr. B\u00fchler states that the letter ya occurred in Sanskrit and not in P\u0101li. If therefore, the mark does represent ya, it affords valuable evidence of the fact that the Sanskrit alphabet was written when the masons' marks were made.\n\nThe letter on No. 7, cha, has the form instead of the more usual . According to Dr. B\u00fchler, it occurs once in the K\u0101lsi A\u1e63\u1e6daka inscription, and frequently in the inscriptions of H\u0101thigumpha, N\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t, Mathur\u0101, and the Western Caves.\n\nTo sum up this portion of the subject.\n\nThe following table shows (a) the marks on the pillars as Sir A. Cunningham saw them, (b) the marks which I have seen, and (c) the complete series of marks which should have been on them if Sir A. Cunningham's theory is correct:\n\n|   | (a) | (b) | (c) |\n|---|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1 | ka  | ka  | ka  |\n| 2 | \u2014   | \u2014   | kha |\n| 3 | ga  | \u2014   | ga  |\n| 4 | \u2014   | \u2014   | gha |\n| 5 | ?ga | ?ya | ya  |\n| 6 | \u2014   | \u2014   | ca  |\n| 7 | cha | cha | cha |\n| 8 | ja  | \u2014   | ja  |\n| 9 | \u2014   | \u2014   | jha |\n| 10| \u2014   | \u2014   | \u0148a  |\n| 11| ta  | \u2014   | ta  |\n\nI have examined these pillar bases with the greatest care several times by both morning and evening light, and I cannot discover even the faintest trace of any of the letters seen by Sir A. Cunningham, and which I have marked in column (b) as not existing.\n\nI now proceed to describe the condition of each pillar-base in the northern row. Each base, as mentioned by Sir A. Cunningham (Mah\u0101-\nbodhi, page 8) represents a vase placed above a plinth composed of three steps, and surmounted by a parabolic moulding with an octagonal top for the reception of an octagonal column. It would be more correct to speak of the top as circular with an octagonal recess cut in the top surface to receive the column. The annexed figures show (figure 4) a plan of the circular top, drawn to a scale of one inch to a foot, and (figure 5) an elevation of the whole. The rim is marked with four radial lines on the top surface of the outer edge or lip. These are evidently marks for orienting the vase, as they point north, south, east and west respectively. They are shown on the plan (figure 4). The letter ka on No. 1 is cut on the outer edge of the rim, below, and about an inch and a half to the east of the northern line. In Nos. 5 and 7 the letters are also on the outer rim, but exactly under the northern line.\n\nNo. 1.\u2014This is in good order, and the ka is cut clearly on the northern side of the rim. Mr. Beglar has set up on it an octagonal pillar shaft, which evidently belonged to one of the series of vases. It is figured in Plate IV of Cunningham's Mah\u00e2bodhi, and described by the author in page 9 of that work. I give a sketch of it in figure 6.\n\nCunningham says that this pillar shaft was marked with the P\u00e2li letter a, and that it was originally fixed in the base No. 1 of the south row (now in the Indian Museum). On examining the shaft, I do find a trace of that letter. At one place, just above a chipped place, there are two marks, thus \\(\\checkmark\\). These are most probably the remains of the letter a (\\(H\\)) lying on its side, as is the case in the letter on the corresponding pedestal (see page 2). Figure 7 is a photograph of the rubbing of this mark.\n\nNo. 2.\u2014This is badly damaged. The west side is knocked off. Only portions of the eastern and of the southern rims remain. No masons' mark visible. As already pointed out, this pillar's base differs from the others in its general designs, being octagonal and not circular.\n\nNo. 3.\u2014This is the one on which General Cunningham says he found the letter ga. The northern and the southern rims have been chipped off, and no masons' mark is now visible.\n\nNo. 4.\u2014Badly damaged. Of the rim, only portions of east and west sides remain. No masons' mark.\n\nNo. 5.\u2014Also badly damaged. The northern and eastern rims are, however, nearly complete. On the northern face of the rim, just under the northern orientation mark, is the letter \\(\\checkmark\\), which Cunningham perhaps read as ga, and said was on No. 3.\n\nNo. 6.\u2014In fair condition, but the northern and eastern parts of the\nrims are chipped off. As all masons' marks appear to have been on the northern rim, there is none visible.\n\nNo. 7.\u2014The whole of the south side of this base knocked off. The north side is complete and the rim bears clearly the letter cha. The orientation of this base is not quite in line with that of the rest.\n\nNo. 8.\u2014Badly damaged. The whole of the south side knocked off; also the northern and western rims. Cunningham says that this base bears the letter ja. There is no trace of this letter, nor, as the fractures are evidently very old, can I understand how it can have been on its usual place on the north side when he saw it.\n\nNos. 9 and 10 are mere fragments of the plinths on which the bases stood.\n\nNo. 11.\u2014Cunningham says that this base bore the letter ta. There is now no trace of this letter. The base is badly damaged, the southwest side and nearly the entire rim having been knocked off. The top of the rim bearing the northern orientation mark still exists, and we should find the mason mark under this. Unfortunately the lower part of this rim, where the mark should occur, has been chipped away. The fracture looks comparatively recent.\n\nTo sum up. I think it may be assumed that all these pillar bases, both on the south and on the north side, had masons' marks. There were eleven bases on each side. Of those on the south side (of which eight are still buried in the Temple wall and one, or, perhaps, three in the Indian Museum) the first (western) base was marked with the letter a and is now exhibited in Calcutta. There is no evidence as to what letters the other bases bore, and Cunningham's statement that they bore the letters \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, \u1e5b, ai, \u1e0d, au, a\u1e25 cannot be supported.\n\nOn the north side the first (western) base has ka, and the seventh has cha; cha is the seventh consonant of the Sanskrit alphabet and the sixth of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ka alphabet. If, therefore, the pillars are in their original order, as Jagann\u0101th Singh states, this tends to prove that Sanskrit was a written language when the masons made the marks.\n\nOn the other hand, the letter which Cunningham appears to have read as ga, and which he says he saw in its right alphabetical place on the third base, is really on the fifth base, and, if it is ga, is not in correct alphabetical order. If therefore the reading is correct, the bases were either not originally set up in alphabetical order, or have since been interchanged. In either case their value as regards the history of the Indian alphabet is very small.\n\nThe letters ja and ta seen by Cunningham are no longer visible.\n\nThe importance of these bases rests on the correct reading of the\nmark on No. 5. If it is to be read as ya, they go to prove that Sanskrit was written in the second century B.C., when the masons' marks were made; or, at least, add a hitherto unknown letter to the P\u0101li alphabet.\n\nFor these reasons, casts of the complete set of the northern row of pillar bases are worth taking, and I am leaving instructions accordingly.\n\nG. A. GAIERSON.\n\nThe 25th November, 1896.\n\nP.S.\u2014Since writing the above, the Mahanth and his people assure me that no one has ever seen the pillar bases on the south side, which are now built into the foundation wall of the Temple, except the first one, which Sir A. Cunningham says was marked a. They say, 'Cunningham Sahib read his books and took measurements, and then dug into the wall of the Temple and found the a base. He never dug into the wall for the others, but as Cunningham Sahib says they were there, they are there. Cunningham Sahib could read books and knew everything, and when he said anything was in any place, he was always right.' This probably means that General Cunningham did not venture to dig into the walls for the last eight bases which his account shows were entirely within the foundations. He certainly removed No. 1, and probably the plinths of Nos. 2 and 3, which were partly visible and could be removed without injury to the main building (see quotation on page 54). These are the three exhibits now in the A\u015boka gallery of the Indian Museum.\n\nG. A.

Three of these are males, and five females, and in addition there are two living males in the Zoological Gardens at Alipore, where the remaining female has apparently recently died.\n\nThis species is to be found in East Siberia (whence Radde described it) China, and Japan. The birds will be added to the Museum collection, where there is already a specimen apparently of this form, numbered 1789D. in Blyth's catalogue, but referred to the common and nearly allied species *F. nyroca*. This was procured in the Bazaar in 1842 or 3.\n\nThe single specimen of the second species exhibited belongs to that curious form the white-faced Stiff tail Duck (*Erismatura leucocephala* (Soop.) The present individual was sent to the Editor of the \"Asian\" newspaper by Captain H. R. Davies, who stated (\"Asian,\" Feb. 14th, 1896) that it was shot by Captain E. D. White, 52nd Light Infantry, on the 22nd January last, at Bettia near Hardoi, between Lucknow and Bareilly. Captain White has kindly presented the specimen to the Indian Museum. It is in heavy moult, and quite incapable of flight, which considering the time of its occurrence is rather surprising, and almost looks as if the species might be somewhere resident within our limits. It is found usually in Southern and Eastern Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia, but is mentioned in the list of birds, in Mr. W. R. Lawrence's recently published work on the \"Valley of Kashmir,\" p. 131, as having occurred in that country and once or twice in the Panjab.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.

In printing Sanskrit works, this character has become the current one not only in\n\n* Since this paper was read Count Salvadori's volume of the British Museum Catalogue (xxvii) containing the ducks, has come to hand, in which I see that *F. baeri* has been recorded from Bengal, though this author appears (p. 344) to doubt the fact; the occurrence of so many specimens quite disposes of this doubt. From the same work it appears (p. 445) that the other species is less rare in India than I had supposed, though its presence in moult is still noteworthy. F. F.\nIndia, but all over the civilised world, wherever Sanskrit language has made its progress. Hence, considering its wide-spread circulation and use, it is worthwhile enquiring into the origin of the name, by which this form of character is recognised by the civilised world, besides the origin of the form itself. This I have tried to explain to some extent in my article entitled 'The origin of the N\u0101garas and the N\u0101gari-alphabet.'\n\nThe abstract of my article is as follows:\u2014\n\nAs the Gaurjara language and the Gaurjara character originated from Gurjara, as Vanga-bh\u0101s\u0101 and Vanga-lipi derived their names from Vanga (Bengal), so the N\u0101gara language and the N\u0101gari character derived their names from a particular place called Nagara. This Nagara was ancient Camat-k\u0101ra-pura (present Bada-nagar) mentioned in the N\u0101gara-kha\u1e47\u1e0da of the Skanda-pur\u0101\u1e47a, and described as having become desolated by the havoc of the N\u0101gas (snakes). A Br\u0101hma\u1e47a named Trij\u0101\u1e6da by propitiating Mah\u0101deva, drove away, by his favour all the N\u0101gas from this place and rendered it Na-gara, (poisonless) after which it came to be known by the name of Nagara. There Trij\u0101\u1e6da established the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as who came from distant countries; these Br\u0101hma\u1e47as afterwards bore the common local title of N\u0101gara for their residing in the city called Nagara.\n\nIn the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bta-candrika by \u0100c\u0101ra-kr\u1e63\u1e47a, N\u0101gara is mentioned, with others, as a corrupt dialect then current.\n\nDuring the prosperity of its Hindu kings, none of the other Br\u0101hma\u1e47as of Gujar\u0101t attained to such high reverence before kings, as these N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. And the language they used was very probably N\u0101gara.\n\nThe most ancient inscription in the N\u0101gari character has been discovered in Gujar\u0101t. Though various sorts of different characters were then in vogue there, all the inscriptions, celebrating the greatness of these N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, inscribed during the reigns of the Hindu kings, are written in the N\u0101gari characters. Even now, some N\u0101gara-Panditas of Gujar\u0101t boast of their ancestors as the devisers of the N\u0101gari-alphabet. The N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who long ago left their mother-country (Bada-nagar) and travelling over several tracts, settled at \u0100nasagundi, Vijaya-nagar and other places of the Deccan, though, during many centuries of their residence among the people, they have quite lost their mother-tongue, and adopted those of the natives, still adhere to their ancient tribal character in writing religious books, while all the surrounding people use a character of their own.\n\nUnder such circumstances, I think the N\u0101gari character to have been the character devised or adopted by the N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as of Gujar\u0101t and named after them.\nFrom a thorough examination into the forms of the ancient N\u0101gar\u012b, it is obvious that the form is only a modification of the ancient Gupta-character. This ancient form was introduced into Gujar\u0101t from Northern India by the N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, which is proved by the fact that most of the copper-plates in N\u0101gar\u012b found in Gujar\u0101t were granted to the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as come from K\u0101nya-kubja, Pundra-vardhana, P\u0101\u1e6dali-putra, &c. No doubt Br\u0101hma\u1e47as began to emigrate into Gujar\u0101t and reside there long before that period.\n\nI think the story of Trij\u0101ta and his driving away the N\u0101gas from Camat-k\u0101ra-pura is only an allegory. The N\u0101gas of the N\u0101garakha\u1e47\u1e0da were perhaps the snake-worshipper \u015ah\u0101h kings or the N\u0101ga race of Gujar\u0101t, who reigned there up to the 4th Century A.D. These \u015ah\u0101h kings, or the N\u0101gas, were afterwards defeated and driven away from N\u0101gar\u0101-\u0100nandapura by the \u010caivas (worshippers of \u010civa), who erected there numerous temples which were visited by the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Tsiang in 7th Century A.D.\n\nIn the lists of Indian alphabets given in works prior to this period, no mention whatever is made of N\u0101gar\u012b.\n\nThe first mention of N\u0101gar\u012b-lipi, is in the Jaina Scripture Nandi-s\u016btra. Most of the Jainpriests hold, that the Nandi-s\u016btra was compiled at the same time or a little before, as the first publication of Kalpa-s\u016btra. In 453 A.D. by order of Dhr\u016bva-s\u0113sa king of Valabhi, the Kalpa-s\u016btra was read before the public at \u0100nandapura (present Bada-nagar). It is probable that the Nandi-s\u016btra was compiled about this time at \u0100nanda-pura, then a Jaina city, and the compiler had in view the character used by the N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, when he enumerated the others.\n\nAt a shortly later period, in the copper-plate grant of Dad\u0101 Pra\u1e47anta-r\u0101ga king of Gurjara, dated \u00c7aka 415, we see the first specimen of the N\u0101gar\u012b character in the Royal sign-manual upon the plate. It is very probable that this character came to be current somewhere about the latter part of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries.\n\nDuring the reigns of the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra-k\u016b\u1e6da kings of Gujar\u0101t, and their successors the Cauukyas, the N\u0101gara-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as retained the Royal priesthood, the ministership and other higher offices of the state all to themselves. From the perusal of the copper-plates of these R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra-k\u016b\u1e6da kings, we come to know, that some of them conquered Gand\u0101, Vanga, Kalinga, G\u0101\u1e45ga, Magadha, Malava and several other countries in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries A.D. It is possible during this period, the name N\u0101gara or N\u0101gar\u012b became circulated in many parts of India.\n\nThis paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\n3.

(With Plate V.)\n\nSome years ago Mr. Biechynden, then Secretary to the Agricultural Horticultural Society of India, sent to the Botanical Garden specimens of a \"double\" rice. Of these specimens I now offer an account.\n\nThe phenomenon was found to be due merely to \"proliferation\" in the gynoecium, without any accompanying abnormality in the other parts of the flower.\n\nThe glumes are precisely those of the race of Oryza sativa known in Bengal as 'Kamal bhog,' a small-grained rice of high quality, of which I take the double rice to be a sport. The andraecium also in this sport has always been found normal.\n\nIn the gynoecium of over 150 flowers examined, not one was found with fewer than 4 ovaries (all apparently perfect), the usual number being 5; a good few flowers were found to have 6, and one or two had 7 ovaries; no flower had more than seven. When 5, 6 or 7 ovaries were present, sometimes only 3, but usually 4 or 5, appeared to be perfect.\n\nIn some hundreds of flowers of 'Kamal bhog,' 'Kal magru,' 'Lal kalam,' 'Mota hurn, and 'Kala nadi'\u2014these are the races mostly cultivated in the neighbourhood of Calcutta\u2014which were examined at the same time, no example of duplication of the ovary was met with.\n\nIn the gynoecium of the flowers in this sport, the individual ovaries are sometimes all quite similar; oftener, however, one or more may have 3 styles instead of 2 (see fig. 8 b.), and in some of the flowers with 4 or 5 ovaries this is all the abnormality that can be detected, except that at times the two styles may be conjoined at the base in one or more of the ovaries (see fig. 8 c.). But in flowers with more ovaries than 5, one or more of them may remain flaccid, their walls being without chlorophyll, and the embryo remaining undeveloped; this may happen even in cases where the style seems to be perfect. In other cases, only one style and stigma may be developed (see fig. 8 d); sometimes also the styles and stigmas may be imperfect (see fig. 8 e) and very abortive ovaries may even be organically united laterally to adjacent ones (see also fig. 8 e). In cases where the stigmas are imperfect, there is apparently never any formation of chlorophyll in the\novarian walls. It happens that all the figures numbered 8 a\u2014e are drawn from ovaries that were contained in the same flower.\n\nAfter the stamens wither, it is most usual to find that only 2 ovaries continue to develop (see fig. 9), and then not infrequently one of these fails to grow as fast as the other (see fig. 10); but very often both grow equally (see fig. 11), and the result is the 'double rice.' In this case the inner faces of both the grains are flat with a whitish vertical central band (see fig. 12), and on section, the embryo of each is found at the outer, or glumal, aspect of the base of the grain.\n\nIn a few cases three grains are developed, and then instead of having flat faces (see fig. 14), they meet in the centre at the white line already mentioned (see fig. 15), this line being at the apex of an obtuse angle; the embryo is in each case at the outside, as before.\n\nThe accompanying Plate shows all the peculiarities noticeable in the flowers of this sport. The sport comes true to seed.\n\nExplanation of the Plate.\n\nPlate V. \"Double\" Rice.\n\n1. Spicule of \"Double Rice\" (Oryza sativa L., race 'Kamal bhog'\u2014sport.) nat. size.\n2.

The Later Moghuls (1707\u20131803).\u2014By WILLIAM IRVINE, Bengal Civil Service (Retired).\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n2. The Mammalia of Tibet.\u2014By Graham Sandberg, B.A.,\nChaplain of Sibuthu.\n\n(ABSTRACT.)\n\nThe author first remarks upon, and endorses, the fact that the Mammalian Fauna of Tibet is singular.\n\nHe then notices its numerical profusion, especially in certain \"herbivorous species, such as yak, antelope, wild ass, goat, and wild sheep,\" which occur in the elevated northern tracts of the country in immense herds.\n\nIn seeking for the causes of this numerical abundance he alludes to the fact\u2014recorded by travellers\u2014that the natural food-supply, in the form of coarse grasses, is surprisingly abundant at certain seasons of the year; and he also thinks that the fact that the Tibetans are Buddhist, and are therefore averse to the taking of life, is worthy of consideration. He does not, however, think it yet possible to explain how so many large herbivorous animals can subsist through the long and severe winter, and concludes that many must then perish of hunger.\n\nThe author next proceeds to enumerate the Mammalia found in Tibet, but he explains, first, that by Tibet he means not merely the elevated Tibetan plateau of Geologists, but also the lower outlying portions of the Indo-Chinese sub-region of the Oriental Region of Zoologists. He therefore includes in his enumeration \"all forms occurring between the southern and northern barriers of the country, and between Ladak and the Szechuan-Yunnan frontier line.\" Within these limits he recognizes 146 species of Mammalia, not including Bats and domestic animals.\n\nIncidentally the author gives the following interesting information with regard to the country commonly spoken of by Zoologists as Moupin:\n\n\"It is a district or sub-prefecture lying between, lat. 31\u00b0 30' and 32\u00b0 N., and between long. 102\u00b0 30' and 102\u00b0 50' E., and is so small a tract that to write 'this species inhabits Moupin' would be paralleled by stating of the English weasel 'it is found in Gloucestershire.' The name Moupin occurs in no map: the fact being that the Abb\u00e9 David has told us the French form of the Chinese name of a Tibetan District, This Moupin, which should be Muping-sze, is a Chinese designation for Nangchhen Shring-wa, commonly known to Tibetans as Drumba or Jumba.\n\n\"This Drumba, otherwise 'Moupin,' is occupied by a Sifan tribe, and is shut off from China by a lofty snow-capped range styled by Tibetans Gyalmo Mordo. The average elevation may be set at circa\n9000 feet, and the climate is exceedingly damp, rain or snow falling, it seems, nearly every day. Though the Chinese are fast immigrating and burning the timber up in wasteful fashion, the country is still well-wooded and encradled amid lofty heights covered with trees and thicket.\"\n\n3. The Copper-plate Inscription of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-d\u0113va II. of Orissa, dated \u00c7aka, 1217\u2014By Nagendra N\u0101tha Vasu.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nWhen the K\u014dndrap\u0101da canal was being excavated, there was found in the village of K\u014dndu-p\u0101\u1e6dna, about 20 feet under ground, a stone chest containing three sets of copper-plate grants each consisting of 7 plates. The grant under review, one of N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha-d\u0113va II. and dated \u00c7aka 1217, is one of these three sets. It is important as it contributes largely to the history of the Ganga Kings of Orissa. Several of the statements of the Temple Records of Orissa\u2014(M\u0101dal\u0101-pa\u1e47ji) and of the historians who follow them, about those Ganga-Kings vary greatly from the accounts given in this grant. According to the former the great temple of Jaga\u1e47\u1e47\u0101tha was erected by king Anuyga-bh\u012bma, but the grant clearly states that though Anangga-bh\u012bma built several temples, it was long before him that Ceda-yupa-d\u0113va had built this celebrated shrine. This and other notable facts which the inscription throws light upon, and which materially alter the History of Orissa, are dealt with at some length, in my article on the inscription to which I refer for details of great interest.\n\nThe paper will be published in full, in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. Notes on the Indian species of Vitis.\u2014By G. King, M.B., LL.D., C.I.E., F.R.S.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\n5. The Gauhati Copper-plate Grant of Indrap\u0101la of Pr\u0101gjyotisha in Assam.\u2014By Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nAssamese copper-plate grants are rare. This is the third which has been made known. The first is the so-called T\u0113jpur grant, which was published in 1840 in Volume IX of the Society's Journal. A third, the Nowgong grant, will shortly be published by Mr. E. A. Gait.\n\nThe Gauhati grant belongs to the P\u0101la dynasty of Assam, the other two grants belong to the same dynasty, but a different one from the Palas.\n\nThe members of the Assam P\u0101las mentioned in the grant are Brahma P\u0101la (alias Ratna P\u0101la), Purandara P\u0101la, and Indrap\u0101la. The\ngrant was issued by the last mentioned. He immediately succeeded his grandfather Ratna P\u0101la, his father Purandara apparently having died during Ratna's life-time. Ratna-p\u0101la appears to have been the first of the Assamese P\u0101las. The names preceding his in the genealogical list are all mythical.\n\nThe grant is not dated, but its characters, which are old Bengali of the kuf\u012b type, refer it to the early part of the 10th century A.D.\n\nThere is nothing to connect the Assamese P\u0101las with the great P\u0101la dynasty of Bih\u0101r and Bengal. The probabilities are against any connection. The two dynasties use different seals, and claim a different ancestry. At the same time it may be remembered that D\u0113vap\u0101la of Beh\u0101r is said to have conquered Assam, in the latter part of the 9th century, and Dharmap\u0101la of Bih\u0101r is said to have settled a colony of Br\u0101hmans there about the middle of the 9th century. Ratnap\u0101la of Assam would be a contemporary of D\u0113vap\u0101la.\n\nThe grantee is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a D\u0113\u00e7ap\u0101la, and the land granted to him is defined as situated near the hamlet of K\u0101si, on the Digumm\u0101 river. The locality can no more be identified.\n\nThe paper will be published in full, in the Journal, Part I.\n\n6. Description of some New Indian Trees.\u2014By G.

J. Rodgers, M.R.A.S., Honorary Numismatist to the Government of India, on the Sangla Tibba in the Gujranwala District, in connection with the question of quarrying that hill for the purpose of supplying ballast for the Wazirabad-Lyallpur Railway.\n\nReport.\n\nSixty-eight and a half miles from Wazirabad, on the Wazirabad and Lyallpur Railway, the new railway station of Sangla is being made. It is about half a mile west from the Sangla Tibba, and between the station and the hill runs the Chenab Canal, having immediately on its west the new colony of Chahur or Jahur Fatulpuri, known formerly also as Bakh Andheri, which is close by a small rock, known as Mundapatura. The Tibba or Rock of Sangla is one of a series of rocks which crop up in the neighbourhood. About a mile and a half to the south are three others known as Arti or Arna, and about a mile and half to the south-east of Arti is a solitary one known as the Gupha or Cave-rock, because in it is a cave said to have been, in olden times, the residence of a thief and adam khor, or man-eater. All these rocks seem to be composed of iron-stone. Those at Arti are being used as quarries for ballast for the Railway. Nothing has been done to the Sangla rock or to the Gupha.\n\nThe Sangla rock is the highest and longest of all, rising, as it does, to the height of nearly 200 ft. above the plain. Of this plain, I ought to say, that it is to all appearance perfectly level, but with a uniform slope towards the south-west. To the east and north of the rock, there is a slight depression which, in one place, once had an embankment, probably artificial. The level plain comes nearly up to the rock. The rock rises abruptly on the north and west sides. Towards the east, there is a small tableland about 30 ft. high which lies between a spur of the northern part of the rock, and another from the centre of the main rock. Owing to the shaly nature of the rock the sides are covered all over with broken stones. These in three places are mixed with brick ends. At the top of the rock there is no area whatever on which buildings of any size could be erected, and in consequence,\nthere is not anywhere any sign of a building of any kind ever having been on the rock. There is not a chisel mark on any part. On the ridge stretching towards the east in the northern part of the rock, there are some modern foundations dug out, but they have never been built on. They are only for buildings about 8 ft. broad. There is a Trigonometrical Survey Station on the highest point. This is a circular erection, about 6 ft. in diameter and 3 ft. high. It is made of old bricks, and contains nearly all the old bricks to be found in the whole neighbourhood. One I measured was $15'' \\times 11'' \\times 2\\frac{1}{8}''$. The next largest bricks I saw were only half this size. On the small plateau below there are some heaps of brick ballast and perhaps three gari loads of brick ends. Here and there are signs of rough foundations of small buildings, rows of stone with the straight surface turned outwards.\n\nIn no case did I see any superstructure on these rows. In no place are there two rows of stone or brick one on the top of the other. Were all the brick ends in the place to be collected, there would not be a truck load.\n\nAfter much persistent search I was rewarded by finding a broken stone image on the eastern lower plateau, and a corner-brick carved on the edge, amongst the debris to the north of the rock. The image is not made of Sangla stone, but of doab red sandstone. It is split in two pieces and has lost the left arm and the legs. The right hand holds a ball. The features are defaced but there is a tall crown on the head.\n\nIn several places on the plain at the foot of the rock broken pots are found but they lie on the surface only. There is no depth of them anywhere.\n\nOn the rock itself as there are no buildings nor traces of their having been any, so there is no well or any source from which water could be obtained, and no tank in which it could be stored.\n\nTo the north, however, about a quarter of a mile from the rock and close by the eastern bank of the canal is an old well made of large bricks. About 12 ft. down there is a curious ornamentation going round the well, made up of repetitions of the accompanying figure. This well, the few big bricks, the carved brick, the broken image, and the broken pots scattered on the surface are the only signs of antiquity in the place. General Cunningham says that 4,000 bricks were taken to mark, and that probably 4,000 more are in the Survey Station on the hill top. If I were inclined to be extravagant I might say let us suppose that the whole of the brick ends about the place represent 12,000 more, then we should have\n20,000 bricks which are not sufficient for a structure of any size and could never have been sufficient to surround a town built round the rock. No place exists near Sangla or in the far off neighbourhood to which bricks could have been removed in any quantity. In the new colony of Jahur all the buildings are of mud.\n\nThere were no mud houses in Sangla or its vicinity. No mud walls surrounded the place, for, mud houses and mud walls when thrown down leave unsightly heaps which can never be removed, especially in a country with so small a rainfall as the Bar has. There are no signs of such mounds. Even the small mound at Mundapatura is not one of this kind. It is a small projecting rock, and a heap of rocky debris.\n\nThere is nothing now therefore of any antiquity in Sangla or its neighbourhood except the well. This has been beautifully restored by the Engineers of the Canal by having its broken masonry courses replaced and a small parapet erected at the top. Its water is 79 ft. from the wall top in spite of the well being actually in the bank of the canal. One well could have supplied but a small population with water. The swamp or seasonal lake must have dried up very soon after the rains. It had been long quite dry when I visited it on the last day of October.\n\nFrom all this it will be seen (1) that Sangla may have been a small village near the hill or rock. (2) It may have had a small temple or a few houses of brick, but they were more probably of reeds. (3) The people used earthen vessels. (4) There were no large buildings or bazaars. (5) There were no fortifications. (6) There were no buildings of stone.\n\nWe know that everything strange in Nature in India has been worshipped, and has had, and has now in these days of modern enlightenment, its resident faqirs who have their followers and dependents, and hence small communities exist in these places. The rocks at Sangla are a strange phenomenon. They must have attracted faqirs in olden times. Before the canal was open, however, there was not a house near the rock and the only ones now are those connected with the brick kiln and the Canal Chowki nearly a mile to the north of the hill.\n\nTherefore my decision is that there is nothing now on the rock or in its neighbourhood of any Historical importance whatever. There is nothing either in the rock, for, it is not a rock with fissures or caverns. The stone of which it is composed may be used for ballast or for any other purpose for which it may be required.\n\nThere is a place called Sangala mentioned as having been besieged\nby Alexander the Great in his invasion of the Punjab. This is what is said of it in Arrian's Arrabasis, Book V, Chapters XXII to XXIV. Chapter XXI tells us: \"He himself, i.e., Alexander, crossed the river Hydraotes\" and \"he was advancing into the country beyond the Hydraotes.\" (N.B.\u2014The Hydraotes was the Ravi or crossing which Alexander would be in the Bari Doab.)\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\"Alexander meanwhile had learned that the Kathaians and other tribes of independent Indians were preparing to meet him in battle if he invaded their country, and were inviting the neighbouring tribes, which were independent like themselves, to co-operate with them. He learned also that the city near which they meant to engage him was strongly fortified, and was called Sangala.\"........... \"Alexander, on receiving this intelligence, marched rapidly against the Kathaians, and, on the second day after he had left the river Hydraotes, arrived at a city named Piruprana....which surrendered on terms of capitulation. Alexander gave his troops rest the next day, and, on the third day, advanced to Sangala where the Kathaians and the neighbouring tribes that had joined them were mustered before the city and drawn up in battle order on a low hill which was not on all sides precipitous. They lay encamped behind their waggons, which, by encircling the hill in three rows, protected the camp with a triple barricade. Alexander, on perceiving the great number of the barbarians and the nature of the position they occupied, drew up his army in the order which seemed best suited to the circumstances, and at once despatched against them the horse archers just as they were, with orders to ride along and shoot at the Indians from a distance, so as not only to prevent them making a sortie before his own dispositions should be completed, but to wound them in their stronghold even before the battle began.\n\n* * *\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n* * * \"Yes, even from these waggons they were forcibly driven by the phalanx of infantry and even at the third row they no longer held ground, but fled with all the haste they could into the city, and shut themselves within its gates. Alexander that same day encamped with his infantry around the city, as far at least as the phalanx enabled him to surround it, for, the wall was of such great extent that his camp could not completely environ it. Opposite the part where the gap was left, and where also was a lake not far from the walls, he posted the cavalry all round the lake, as he knew it not to be deep, and at the same time anticipated, that the Indians, terrified by their previous\ndefeat, would abandon the city during the night. The event showed he had conjectured aright, for, about the second watch, the most of them dropped down from the wall, and came upon the outposts of the cavalry. The foremost of them were cut to pieces by the sentinels, but those in the rear, perceiving that the lake was guarded all round, withdrew into the city. Alexander now encompassed the city with a double stockade, except where the lake shut it in, and around the lake he posted guards to keep still stricter watch. He resolved also to bring up the military engines against the place for battering down the walls. Some deserters, however, came to him from the city and informed him that the Indians intended that very night to escape from the city by way of the lake, where the gap occurred in the stockade. So at that point he stationed Ptolemy, the son of Lagoo, with three divisions of the hypaspists, each 1,000 strong, all the Agriarians and a single line of archers.\u201d\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n* * * Such were the directions he gave, and Ptolemy in that place collected as many as he could of the waggons which the enemy had left behind them in their flight, and placed them athwart so that the fugitives might imagine there were many obstacles to their escaping by night. He ordered the stakes which had been cut, but not fixed in the ground, to be formed into stockades at different points between the lake and the wall. * * * About the fourth watch, the barbarians, in accordance with the information Alexander had received, opened the gates which fronted the lake, and rushed towards it at full speed. * * * Ptolemy, with his men, fell upon them and killed them, one after another, as they struck out from the waggons. Upon this the Indians fled back once more to the city for refuge, and as many as 500 of them were slain in the retreat.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Porus also arrived, bringing with him the remainder of his elephants, and a force of 5,000 Indians, and the military engines which had been constructed by Alexander were now brought up to the wall. But the Macedonians, before any part of it was battered down, took the city by storm, having undermined the wall, which was of brick and planted ladders against it all round. In the capture, 17,000 of the Indians were slaughtered, and more than 7,000 were captured together with 300 waggons and 500 horse men. The loss in Alexander\u2019s army was somewhat under 100 killed and 1,200 wounded.\u201d * * *\n\n\u201cHe drew back to Sangala and razed the city to the ground.\u201d * * *\n\n\u201cHe himself advanced with his army to the river Hyphasis to conquer the Indians who dwelt beyond it.\u201d (N. B.\u2014The Hyphasis was the Bias, so the Sangala of Alexander must have been in the Bari Doab.)\nFrom the above, it is plain\u2014\n\n(1) That Sangala was a strongly fortified city three days' march from the Ravi in the Bari Doab.\n\n(2) It was a large city with gates, so large that Alexander's army could not wholly encompass it.\n\n(3) The walls were so high, they needed to be battered down. They must have been therefore not only high but thick. Eventually they were undermined.\n\n(4) The walls were of brick. The city was razed to the ground.\n\n(5) The gap in the stockade was so large, it had to be guarded by more than 3,000 men.\n\nNothing whatever is said about the rock at Sangla. A small rock or hill is mentioned outside the town.\n\nAt Sangla, to-day, there is no sign whatever of extensive ruins such as must be wherever Sangala was. The historian places it in the Bari Doab and after its capture Alexander marched straight on the Bias.\n\nFrom all this, I infer that Sangla Tibba has nothing whatever to do with the strongly fortified city, surrounded by a high and thick brick wall, besieged by Alexander the Great, taken by him, and razed to the ground, and which was situated in the Bari Doab.\n\nAgain, in \"Buddhist Records of the Western World\" compiled before 713 A.D., we read that New Sakala was $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to the north-east of the old town of Sakala. Both Sakalas were then about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circuit. The walls of old Sakala were thrown down, but the foundations were still firm and strong. This old Sakala had, some centuries before the visit of the Chinese traveller, been the capital of Mahirakula who had \"established his authority in this town and ruled over India.\"\n\n(Here I venture to observe that this part of the country, Sangla and its vicinity, used to be known as the Sandal Bar and was an impenetrable jungle.)\n\n\"In the old town of Sakala is a sangharama with about 100 priests.\"\n\n* * * \"By the side of the convent is a stupa (tope) about 200 ft. high.\"\n\n* * * \"To the north-east of the sangharama, about a mile, is a stupa about 200 ft. high, built by Asoka Raja.\"\n\n* * * \"About $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to the north-east of the new capital, we come to a stupa of stone, about 200 ft. high, built by Asoka.\"\n\n(Beal's Buddhist Records of the Western World, Volume I, page 165-172.)\n\nGeneral Cunningham makes Sangla Tibba, the Sangala of the Alexandrian invasion and the Sakala of the Buddhist Records. On this I have to remark:\u2014\n(1) If Sangala and Sakala were the same, then the place had been in existence over 1,000 years when it was visited by the Chinaman. The foundations of its walls had stood thick and firm for 1,000 years. In that 1,000 years, there must have been a vast accumulation of sweepings and ashes and mud. The place was a large one, so that there must be even now where it stood, a very high mound. There is but the rock at Sangla.\n\n(2) There were three stupas of stone more than 200 ft. high. After 1,200 years, there must be signs of those stupas. We know that such buildings were sculptured. There is not a sign of any such buildings either in, or on, or near, Sangla, neither is there a trace of the New Sakala mentioned by the traveller.\n\n(3) Sakala was the capital of Miharakula, a man whose coins are very plentiful in some parts of the Punjab. But not a coin is said to have been ever found in Sangla. I hunted several hours in the bazaars of Hazizabad and could find no coins older than the reign of Sikandar Lodi.\n\n(4) The travels of the Chinaman say nothing about the rocks, the peculiar physical feature of the neighbourhood.\n\nFrom all this, I infer that the absence of all walls and foundations from Sangla; the absence of all traces of stupas either inside or outside the place and its neighbourhood; the absence of ruins of a neighbouring New Sakala; the absence of coins; the non-mention of chief physical features of the place, seem to point out plainly that Sangla is not the Sakala of the Chinese traveller.\n\nI have before shown that it is not the Sangala of Alexander's expedition.\n\nSangla is therefore stripped of all historical associations.\n\n(For the discussion identifying Sangla Hill, with Sangala of the Greeks and Sakala of the Chinese traveller, see Archaeological Reports by General Cunningham, Vol. II, page 192-200.)\n\nThe quotations from Arrian are from McCrindle's \"Ancient India, its invasion by Alexander the Great,\" page 114-120.\n\nThe image and brick found by me will be deposited in the Lahore Museum, together with a ball, which may be of cast or native iron. This last was found by Mr. Eldridge, Assistant Engineer, Chenab Canal, in the Arti quarries. I obtained it from Balik Ram, Contractor of Railway ballast.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to tender my thanks to Messrs. Preston and Benton, Superintending and Executive Engineers, for all their courtesy\nGraham Sandberg \u2014 Note to Mr. Gait's paper on Ahom Coins. [June, and assistance; also to Mr. Bremner of the Wazirabad and Lyallpur Railway. These gentlemen all take an intelligent interest in the history of the district through which their Canal and Railway pass.\n\nLalla Ram Surup, Sub-Overseer, did the work I set him well. There was not much for him to do, as the absence of antiquities rendered the survey of the place almost unnecessary. He made the accompanying map (Plate VI) from his survey. On it are shown the different points to which I have drawn attention.\n\nThe Secretary read the following letter:\n\nSABATHU : PUNJAB.\nMay 25th, 1896.\n\nThe Editor : Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal, Part I.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your note to Mr. Gait's paper on Ahom coins, in which you set forth the series employed in Tibet and Mongolia for compiling the Kalendar, I hope you will forgive a few remarks in the interests of accuracy. I would point out that the names of the members of each series in the Mongol language are by no means correctly given in your revision of Huc's list. In fact Huc's version has the spelling much nearer to original Mongol than that which you substitute on the authority of Dr. Waddell.\n\nDenary Series.\u2014The Mongol for \"Wood\" is Modon, usually pronounced Modo; Huc gives Moto; your list Mod. \"Fire\" is always Gal; Huc gives Gal; your list Kal. \"Earth\" is Shiroge, usually pronounced Shir\u00e9; Huc gives Ch\u00e9r\u00e9 (i.e., Sh\u00e9r\u00e9); your list Shora. \"Iron\" is Te-m\u00fcr; Huc gives Te-mur; your list T'ul-ed. (N.B. There is no such letter as 't' in Mongol). Finally, \"Water\" is Usun, sounded Usu; Huc gives Usu; your list Osu.\n\nDuodenary Series.\u2014The Mongol for \"Mouse\" is Khulugh\u00e1na, sounded in North Mongolia Kulguna and in the South Hulgh\u00e1na; Huc gives Khouloukhana (i.e., the literary form almost exactly); your list Hul-kan. \"Tiger\" is Bare; Huc gives Bara; your list Par (N. B. There is no letter \"P\" in Mongol). \"Hare\" is Tolai; Huc gives Tol\u00e9; your list T'us-lus which is an impossible orthography in Mongol. \"Dragon\" is Lu; Huc gives Lou; your list Lwu! \"Fowl\" is Takya, sounded Takya; Huc gives Takia; your list Ta-ka. \"Dog\" is Nokhai and \"Pig\" is Khakhai; Huc giving Nokh\u00e9 and Khakh\u00e9; your list No-has and Ka-has.\n\nConfirmation of the above-stated readings may be found in the works of Bobrovnikov, Castr\u00e9n, and I, J. Schmidt.\nSURVEY ROUND SANGLA HILL\n\nScale 600 Ft.: = 1 Inch.\nAs Mr. Rockhill has observed, the much-maligned Huc, ever since he wrote his charming volumes on Tibet and Tartary, has been continually accused of errors, and then always found to have been correct after all. The more we learn of Tibet and Mongolia, the more is the marvellous accuracy of the geographical, philological, and general observations of that learned and adventurous Lazarist father made evident.\n\nIn the Tibetan list two mistakes occur. The words lo'ag \"Ram,\" and spRou \"Monkey,\" should be Luk and Sprou.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nGRAHAM SANDBERG.\n\nChaplain of Sabathu.\n\nThe Joint Philological Secretary Pandita Haraprasad C\u00e4stri exhibited three Archaeological photographs forwarded by Mr. W. Banks Gwyther, Esq., Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Public Works Department with a note by Mr. Ume\u00e7a Candra Vatavyala, Officiating Magistrate, Bagud\u00e4.\n\nPhotograph No. 1 belongs to an image found in a tank in the village of Durgapur near Mahasthana in Bagud\u00e4. It is a female figure probably of Tara Devi one of the Baudha \u00c7aktis so much worshipped in Medieval India. It contains an inscription which is nothing else but the ordinary Confession of Buddhist faith. \"Ye dharm\u00e4 hetuprabhav\u00e4ti etc.\"\n\nNo. 2 belongs to an image discovered under a tree in the town of Bagud\u00e4, of a Bodhisattva and a \u00c7akti in an amatory condition sitting on a throne.\n\nNo. 3 belongs to an image which lay among a pretty large number of broken images in the village of Tilak. It is also that of a Baudha \u00c7akti sitting on a throne supported by a tiger. She has four arms carrying a gada or mace a cakra or discus, a kumbha or waterpot in three of her arms. The object in her fourth arms is indistinct.\n\nMr. Ume\u00e7a Candra Vatavyala has caused all the three images to be brought over to Bagud\u00e4. They might, now, with profit, be brought to the Indian Museum.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Materials for a Carcinological Fauna of India, No. II. The Brachyura Oxystoma.\u2014By A.

Buddhist Sutras Inscribed on Bricks found at Gop\u0101lpur in the Gorakhpur District.\u2014By Vincent A. Smith, Indian Civil Service, and William Hoey, D. Litt., Indian Civil Service. (With Plate VII.)\n\nThe tract of country south of Gorakhpur lying between the Ami, Ku\u1e47a, and Gh\u0101gra rivers is singularly rich in ancient sites, which have as yet received very slight examination.\n\nOne of the most ancient of these sites is marked by the village Gop\u0101lpur, which is situated about two miles west of the bazaar known as Gola, a short distance from the northern bank of the Gh\u0101gra, and about twenty-eight miles almost due south of Gorakhpur. See the map, Plate VII.\n\nThe largest mound north-west of the village is known as Kopgah or Kopw\u0101 Dih. The horseshoe shaped sheet of water called Bark\u0101, or Barj\u012b\u1e6d\u0101 T\u0101l, encloses another mound, which has the curious name of Ma\u00f1jaratiy\u0101 Dih, or 'the midnight mound.'\n\nSomewhere in these ruins a hoard of twenty gold Gupta coins was found in July 1854, which included seven specimens of the coinage of Chandra Gupta II. (circa A.D. 400). At a later date an indigo planter is said to have obtained a pot of cowries in Kopw\u0101 Dih, and the curious little terracotta plaque herewith sent (see Plate VII) was obtained by Dr. Hoey from the same place. The ruins also yield great earthen vessels, pestles, and other utensils of terracotta, and numerous specimens of spindle whorls (tikri). Small stone stools (cauki,) of which Dr. Hoey possesses a specimen, frequently turn up, and indicate that the buildings included a Buddhist monastery. These stools, which are commonly from twelve to fifteen inches long, and six inches high, with four small feet, are found at many Buddhist sites, and were probably used by the monks to stand on when bathing.\n\nA small temple east of the village and an adjoining tank preserve a reminiscence of Buddhism in the name Dharm Dshl. Though the temple in its existing form is modern, it is built partly of ancient materials. Moulded terracotta or brick ornaments, belonging to an older building, are inserted in the walls.\n\nFolklore of the usual kind has grown up around the ruins, which are supposed by the villagers to mark the site of the fort and city of Bhar R\u0101j\u0101. They are haunted by two spirits, one male, and the other female. The male deity is Bh\u0101s\u0101sura, the buffalo demon, and is appeased by offerings of oilcake and chopped straw. The female spirit is simply called Dshl, and is fed with sweetened rice cooked in milk.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Thomas in J. A. S. B., xxiv. (1855), p. 499, and V. A. Smith in J. A. S. B., Vol. LIII, Pt. I. (1884), p. 162.\n2 Cunningham, Reports, iii, 52; xi, 162; xvii, 4.\nShe is believed to be the ghost of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 girl buried alive in the foundations to protect a golden treasure.\n\nA well-known myth is attached to the Bark\u0101 T\u0101l. Once upon a time, whenever any man came to the city, and wanted food and utensils in which to cook it, the dharm nauk\u0101, or 'boat of merit,' rose to the surface of the water, and supplied his needs with provisions and golden vessels. So long as the golden vessels were duly returned, the boat sank, and disappeared until again called for. But one day a covetous man stole the golden vessels, and since that day the mystic boat has been no more seen.\\(^1\\)\n\nSome months ago the local zemindar, who was building indigo vats, employed men to collect all the loose bricks which they could find. When the surface supply failed, the workmen began to dig in the Ma\u00f1jharatiy\u0101 mound, and coming to a masonry floor, they broke into a chamber below, and extracted a number of bricks. Pandit R\u0101mgharib Caub\u0113, who is a resident of Gop\u0101lpur, noticed that one of the bricks so extracted was inscribed, and, having obtained it from the workmen, sent it to Mr. V. A. Smith.\n\nShortly afterwards (in January 1896) Dr. Hoey visited the spot, and succeeded in recovering the other inscribed bricks now submitted.\n\nDr. Hoey is of opinion that the masonry floor broken through by the labourers belonged to some comparatively modern building erected on the mound. He caused the hole to be re-opened and found that the inscribed bricks had been taken out of a small chamber about eight feet square and about eight feet below the surface, which was built of huge bricks, about a foot and a half long, and some three inches thick. The inscribed bricks are said to have rested on a sort of pedestal, or edhi, made of brick, which was destroyed for the sake of the material. On a ledge in the chamber Dr. Hoey himself found a small earthen-ware saucer containing eleven copper coins, which had evidently been undisturbed since they were deposited.\n\nThe coins belong to the reigns of the great Ku\u1e63\u0101n kings, Hima Kadphises, Kaniska, and Huvi\u0161ka, and therefore range in date from about A.D. 40 to about A.D. 150, according to the chronology generally accepted. They are all of well-known types, and include examples of the three leading forms of obverse used by Huvi\u0161ka, namely the elephant-rider, the throned king, and the king squatted cross-legged. One coin belongs to the 'Cock and Bull' Mitra series associated with Ayodhya. The obverse, with bull to left, and the legend Ayu Mitrasa is distinct. The reverse, which should show the cock and palm-tree, is defaced.\\(^2\\)\n\nWe now proceed to describe the bricks.\n\n\\(^1\\) A similar legend attaches to the Kawwal Dih tank at Gorakhpur.\n\n\\(^2\\) Those Ayu Mitrasa coins, which were described by Carlyle for the first time in 1880 (J. A. S. B., Pt. I, Vol. XLIX, p. 27), are ascribed by Cunningham (Coins\nNo. I, that sent in by Pandit R\u0101mgharib Caub\u0113, is about $10\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, by $4\\frac{1}{2}$ broad, and one inch thick. Unluckily it was broken in transit, but, notwithstanding the fracture, very few letters have been lost. The characters are about quarter of an inch in height, and are inscribed on both sides of the brick, nine lines on the front, and ten on the back. The writing was evidently incised before the brick was baked. The moulding was roughly done, and the surface is consequently uneven, and the letters are often irregularly formed.\n\nWe have obtained a fairly satisfactory facsimile of the text of this brick by pencilling over a paper estampage, which is submitted here-with. In its present state the brick would not yield a clear photograph, but if it were soaked for a long time, and the letters very carefully cleared of mud, a tolerably distinct photograph might be obtained. One side of one of Dr. Hoey's bricks has thus been cleaned.\n\nThe bricks Nos. II and III are perfect, except for some minute chippings.\n\nNo. II measures $11\\frac{1}{2}$ by $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, and has twelve lines of writing on one side, and ten on the other.\n\nNo. III measures $9\\frac{1}{2}$ by $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches and has twelve lines of writing on each side.\n\nNo. IV (fragments A, B, C) is in bad condition. It measured originally about 9 inches by 5, and had twelve lines of writing on one side, and six on the other.\n\nNo. V is a small fragment of a brick, the rest of which has been lost.\n\nThe fragments of Nos. IV and V were recovered by Dr. Hoey near the indigo vats, into which several of the inscribed bricks have probably been built. Others are believed to be still in the villagers' hands.\n\nThe discovery of these brick records seems to us to be of much interest and importance. So far as we are aware, no similar discovery has ever before been made in India, and it is startling to find the Indian Buddhists using brick, as the Assyrians did, to preserve long documents.\n\nThe characters of the inscriptions, which use throughout the tridentate form of unattached y, belong to the Northern alphabet of the third or fourth century. The coins associated with the bricks indicate that the earliest possible date should be assigned to the inscriptions.\n\nAnc. I. p. 93, Pl. ix, 14, 15) to S\u0101rya Mitra. It seems to us impossible to read the characters as S\u0101rya, although \u0100rya gives no sense. The characters for A and B are quite distinct.\n\n1 The inscriptions on bricks found at Sh\u014drk\u014dt in the Jhang district of the P\u0101j\u0101b are merely masons' marks, notes to indicate the proper laying of the bricks. (Cunningham, Reports, v., 102.) Bricks inscribed with the name of Qri Kum\u0101ra Gupta have been found at Bhitar\u012b in the Gh\u0101zipur district (ibid. I, 97, Pl. xxx.)\nThe language is good grammatical Sanskrit prose. With the exception of the legends of the Gupta coins, inscriptions dating from the period between A.D. 250 and 400 are almost altogether lacking. The discovery now announced, therefore, helps to fill a considerable gap in Sanskrit palaeography and epigraphy.\n\nWe are not prepared to offer complete transcripts and translations of these curious brick inscriptions, and must leave that task to professed scholars. But there is very little difficulty in deciphering most of the characters, and there is no doubt as to the general nature of the contents of the inscriptions. They all deal with Buddhist ontology, and specially with the doctrine of the twelve nid\u0101nas, or 'causes' which connect \u0101vidy\u0101, or Blind Ignorance, with J\u0101ra-mara\u1e47a, Decay and Death, and thus form the Bhava-cakra, or Cycle of Existence.\n\nThis ontological doctrine has recently been twice discussed and illustrated in the publications of this Society, and is, of course, familiar to all students of Buddhism.\n\nDr. Waddell, in a most valuable paper, has shown that the so-called Zodiac in the cave-paintings at Ajant\u0101 is really a pictorial representation of the Cycle of Existence, practically identical with the pictures now commonly used by the Lamas of Tibet.\n\nPandit Hari Mohan Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63an has published a Sanskrit text and English translation of the Bhava-cakra S\u016btra in eleven gl\u014dkas, forming the 27th Pallava of the Avadd\u012bna Kalpalat\u0101, entitled Pratiya Samutp\u0101da Avad\u0101na, the work of the poet K\u1e63emendra. This metrical exposition of the doctrine by K\u1e63emendra is practically identical in substance with the prose version given on brick No. I. The inscription on that brick is a complete S\u016btra, and begins with the well-known formula, Bhagav\u0101n may\u0101 grutam \u015bkamin samay\u0101 Bhagav\u0101n \u010cr\u0101vastiya\u1e41, etc.:\u2014\"Thus have I heard\u2014Once upon a time, Bhagav\u0101n was dwelling at \u010cr\u0101vasti in the J\u0113tavana, in the garden of An\u0101thapindada, etc.\"\n\nThe other bricks (Nos. II-V) do not seem to contain the opening s\u016btra formula, though all treat of the nid\u0101nas.\n\nBricks Nos. II-V are the property of Dr. Hoey, who proposes to present No. II, to the British Museum, and No. III, to the Lucknow Provincial Museum. No. I is the property of Mr. V. A. Smith, who gave a high price for it, and reserves the question of its disposal. Nos. IV and V, will be disposed of under Dr. Hoey's instructions.\n\n1 E.

Reverse in quatrefoil\n\nNo margin. Margins illegible.\nThis coin is not in Thomas or in the Panjab and Calcutta catalogues, or in the B.M. catalogue. The obverse corresponds with that of No. 9877, p. 146 of the Calcutta catalogue, a silver coin, and the epithet \"Qhaq al isl\u00e1m wa al masalmin\" is found on a coin of Sikandar Sh\u00e1h bin Ili\u00e1s Sh\u00e1h, No. 9872, p. 143.\n\n4. A new Mint of Akbar.\u2014By Richard Burn, I.C.S.\n\nThe coin which I send for inspection bears a mint name which I read as M\u00e1nikp\u00far. If this reading is correct it adds a new mint city of Akbar to those already known. The coin is in good preservation, weighs 325 grains and its diameter is 875\" and every letter except the \"k\u00e1f\" is unmistakable. The unit figure, however, is not on the reverse, though there seems to be a trace of 9.\n\nM\u00e1nikp\u00far has been a celebrated place since the conquest of Qanauj, and indeed its Shaikhs claim to have been settled there more than a century and a half before. Standing on the bank of the Ganges in the district of Partabgarh opposite to Karra, it has again and again been the scene of battles under both Path\u00e1ns and Mughals. From Katlagh Kh\u00e1n under N\u00e1siru-d-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad in A.H. 654 to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in A.D. 1760-61, rebels to the central government have ravaged the neighbourhood. It was in the sands between Karra and M\u00e1nikp\u00far, according to Z\u00ed\u00e1u-d-din Barn\u00ed that Alau-d-d\u00edn Muhammad treacherously seized his uncle Jal\u00e1l\u00fa-d-d\u00edn F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h by the hand, at the same time giving the signal for his assassination. Under Akbar the sark\u00e1r of M\u00e1nikp\u00far was included in the Sub\u00e1h of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and even in his reign the same lawlessness prevailed. Perhaps the most important battle of that time was that in A.H. 974 when Akbar's rapid approach forced Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n to raise the siege of Shergarh and withdraw to Karra where his brother Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n was besieging Majn\u00fan Kh\u00e1n K\u00e1ksh\u00e1l, the J\u00e1gird\u00e1r. The Emperor followed and at Rai Bareli heard that the rebels intended joining the sons of Mirza Sult\u00e1n. By a forced march he reached M\u00e1nikp\u00far, and as no boats could be secured he swam the river on an elephant followed by a hundred cavalry. It was the old story of the army spending its night feasting in imagined security. Before they had time to recover from their confusion Akbar was in their midst joined by Majnu\u0144 Kh\u00e1n and Asaf Kh\u00e1n J\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Karra. Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n was trodden to death by an elephant, and Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n was killed by some of the Am\u00edrs.\n\nThe vicissitudes of M\u00e1nikp\u00far came to an end in 1762 when it was incorporated in Oudh by Shuj\u00e1-ud-daulat, in which province it still remains. Its population at present is under 2,000, but the gardens and groves in its neighbourhood still contain ruins that bear witness to its former importance.\nNotwithstanding the many fights that took place in the neighbourhood, the supremacy of the central government was not shaken during the reign of Akbar. The coin has nothing to distinguish it from the ordinary d\u00e1m, and I should therefore judge that more coins of this mint, and of different years will come to light. During the decade to which it must belong (980-989) there was no serious attempt on the place, and it appears to have been an ordinary mint. The coin was obtained in a bazar in the Farokhabad District.\n\n**Description of coin.**\n\n| Wt. | D. | Obverse. | Reverse. |\n|-----|----|----------|---------|\n| 325 | .875 | \u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f | \u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f |\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in July last:\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals, presented by the respective Societies and Editors.**\n\nAngers.

On the K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b Vowel System.\u2014By Dr. G. A. GRIERSON, C.I.E.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe vowel system of K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b is extremely intricate, and resembles English in this, that the spelling of a word gives an insufficient clue to its pronunciation. This is due to the important part which epenthesis plays in the pronunciation of the language. That is to say, the frequency with which a final short vowel is not itself pronounced, but affects the pronunciation of the vowel of the preceding syllable, thus giving rise to a number of diphthongal and broken sounds, which are not represented by the letters composing the word. A similar peculiarity exists in English. For instance, take the word mar. Here the a, has the sound of ah. But if we add a final e to this word, we get the word mare, in which e is not pronounced, but epenthetically affects the preceding a, so that it is pronounced like a Sanskrit \u0113 and no longer like ah.\n\nIn K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b, no less than three different vowels are used in this way. Placed at the end of a word, they are hardly audible, or are not pronounced at all, but they altogether change the sound of the preceding vowel. These three vowels are i, u, and \u016b, and when so used, the author represents them by small letters above the line, thus i, u, \u016b. By native grammarians they are called m\u0101tr\u0101-vowels. As an example of their use, the words k\u0101r\u0101, k\u0101r\u0101, and k\u0101r\u0101, may be taken. Roughly speaking, the first is pronounced something like kyrie, the second like core, and the third like the German k\u00f6r. So also, the base b\u014dl-, speech, when the feminine termination -i is added to it is pronounced b\u014dli;\nthe base *nil*, dark green, when the masculine termination *a* is added, becomes *nyil*; and the root *b\u014dz*, hear, when the feminine termination *\u0101* is added, becomes *b\u014dz\u0101*.\n\nThe author's object has been to discuss this question of epenthesis in K\u0101\u00e7mir\u012b as thoroughly as possible, and for this purpose, he has prepared lists of words, showing the result of every possible occurrence of these m\u0101tr\u0101-vowels.\n\nThe results are interesting and explain many peculiarities in K\u0101\u00e7mir\u012b declension and conjugation.\n\nThe paper will be published in full, in the Journal, Part I.\n\n8.

P\u00e9al, F.R.G.S.\n   The paper will be published in the Journal, Part III.\n\n4. *The Discovery of Vidy\u0101viveka, an unique MS. at Puri.*\u2014By Pandit Haraprasada \u010c\u0101stri.\n   It is a well-known fact that V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra commented upon some of the best known works on the six schools of Hind\u016b philosophy. His Bh\u0101mati is a commentary on \u010c\u0101\u1e47akar\u0101c\u0101rya's \u010c\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya; Ny\u0101yav\u0101rtika-t\u0101tparya-t\u012bk\u0101 on Ny\u0101yav\u0101rtika by Udyotakara; \u015a\u0101mkhyatattva-kaumudi on \u012a\u015bvarak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's K\u0101rik\u0101s; Yogas\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya-vy\u0101khya on Y\u014dga-bh\u0101\u1e63ya by Vy\u0101sa.\nBut on Mim\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 he wrote a commentary, entitled Ny\u0101yaka\u1e47ik\u0101, on a certain work named Vidhi-viv\u0113ka. His commentary is known to Hall (see his catalogue p. 87). A MS. of this commentary is to be found in the Sanskrit College Library at Benares. Two pages of this commentary are missing, and so I was requested to get a copy of these two pages from the only other MS. known to belong to the Mahant of \u010c\u0101\u1e45kara-ma\u1e6dha at P\u016bri. The \u010c\u0101\u1e45kara-ma\u1e6dha MS. is noticed by the late R\u0101ja R. Mitter in p. 291 of the eighth volume of his Notices of MSS. My travelling Pandit, Bin\u014ddvih\u0101r\u012b K\u0101vyat\u012brtha was asked to copy out the pages at P\u016bri, and in attempting to do so, he has made an important discovery. He was successful in laying his hand on the identical MSS. mentioned by Dr. Mitra. This was very fortunate, because since the publication of Vol. VIII, many of the \u010c\u0101\u1e45kara-ma\u1e6dha MSS. are reported to have been lost or destroyed.\n\nThe beginning and end of the MS. is the same as given in Vol. VIII; but on careful examination, the first forty-six leaves of the MS. proved to be the text of the Vidhi-viv\u0113ka. The MS. of Ny\u0101yaka\u1e47ik\u0101 was defective. It commences at leaf 87 and ends at leaf 268. The whole MS. was mistaken by Dr. Mitra's Pandit to be that of Ny\u0101yaka\u1e47ik\u0101. The text of Vidhi-viv\u0113ka is by Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra\u2014the great Mim\u0101\u1e41saka teacher who was converted to be a Veda\u1e47\u1e6dist by \u010c\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya and who wrote a large number of works on Veda\u1e47\u1e6da. His name as a Sa\u1e47\u1e47y\u0101si was changed into S\u016bre\u1e47var\u0101c\u0101rya. He wrote the Vidhi-viv\u0113ka while he was a householder and fully believed in the efficacy of Vedic rituals. The so-called biographers of \u010c\u0101\u1e45kara have dwelt largely on the powers and learning of Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana, who was regarded as an incarnation of Brahm\u0101 himself.\n\nThe MS. of the Vidhi-viv\u0113ka is written in an excellent D\u0113van\u0101g\u0101r\u012b hand and appears to have been written at least two hundred years ago. I have caused a transcript of the MS. to be made in Bang\u0101li character, and it is now laid before you.\n\n5. List of Birds collected by the Afghan-Baluch Boundary Commission of 1896.\u2014By F.
