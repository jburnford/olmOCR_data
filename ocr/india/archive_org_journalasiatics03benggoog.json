Rivett-Carnac, C. S.\n\n(With five plates.)\n\nAt the meeting of the Society held in Calcutta in February, 1870, the existence on the tumuli of Central India of \"cup marks\" similar to those found on the Stone Circles and Monoliths of Northern Europe was briefly noticed by me (see Proceedings of the Asiatic Society for February, 1870, p. 57). It may interest the Society to learn that, during an autumn holiday in the Kam\u00e1on hills, I have come across many other markings on stones and rocks closely resembling those described by the late Sir James Simpson in his 'Archaic Sculpturings', the work noticed at the meeting of the Society above referred to,\u2014and that, on this occasion, the markings found have not been confined to cups and circles, but include rough sculpturings of a somewhat more defined type than those previously noticed.\n\n2. At a point about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles south of Dw\u00e1r\u00e1-H\u00e1th, and 12 miles north of the Military Station of R\u00e1n\u00edkhet in Kam\u00e1on, the bridle road leading from the plains through Nain\u00ed T\u00e1l and R\u00e1n\u00edkhet to Baijn\u00e1th, and thence on to the celebrated shrine at Bidran\u00e1th, is carried through a narrow gorge, at the mouth of which is a temple sacred to Mah\u00e1deo, where the pilgrims who follow this route generally halt for a short time, and where from the position of the temple in the defile, the priest in charge\n\n* Archaic Sculpturings of Cups, Circles, &c., on stones and rocks in Scotland, England, and other Countries. By Sir J. Simpson, Bart., D.C.L., Edinburgh, Edmonton and Douglas, 1867.\ncan conveniently levy contributions on all passers-by. The temple will not be found marked on the one-inch-to-the-mile map of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, but it is locally known by the name of Chandeshwar, and the above description will perhaps be sufficient to enable any who care to visit the spot to find its position without difficulty.\n\n3. About two hundred yards south of the temple, towards the middle of the defile, and to the right hand of the traveller from R\u00e1nikhet to Dw\u00e1r\u00e1-H\u00e1th, a rock partly covered with low brushwood rises at an angle of $45^\\circ$ to the height of some seventy feet above the stream. The rock has been much worn by the action of heat and damp, and to a passer-by would not at first sight appear to possess any interest, but when carefully examined in a good light, it will be found to be covered with \"cup marks\" and sculpturings, the principal forms of which have been figured in the accompanying rough sketches.\n\n4. A reference to Sketches I to V in the accompanying plates will shew that in Europe, the \"cup marks\" or holes scooped out on the face of the rock, and noticed by me at the meeting of the Society above referred to, predominate. On the Chandeshwar Rock in a space measuring 14 feet in height by 12 in breadth, upwards of 200 such marks may be counted. They are of different sizes, varying from six inches to an inch and a half in diameter, and in depth from one inch to half an inch, and are generally arranged in perpendicular lines presenting many permutations in the number and size and arrangement of the cups. These exactly correspond with the \"First Type\" of the marks found in Europe described at page 2 of Sir J. Simpson's work above referred to, and figured in many of the plates with which his book is illustrated.\n\n5. In the portion of the rock shewn in Plate II, commencing from left to right and taking the upper ledge, first comes a row of four small cups, then three rows of cups each $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in diameter, the first line containing nine, the second seven, and the third seven cups. Then follows a row of 15 cups somewhat smaller in diameter, the 11th and 15th (the last) of which are distinguished by an incised ring surrounding each cup, corresponding exactly with the \"Second Type\" figured at Plate 1, and described in page 4, of Sir J. Simpson's work.\n\n6. Then follow three lines containing respectively 17, 14, and 15 small \"cups\". The 13th and 17th (the last) cups of the first row are \"ringed\" and belong to the \"second type\". The last cups of the second and third line are distinguished by what Sir J. Simpson describes (page 5) as a \"groove or gutter\", leading from the cups downwards, and of which several specimens will be found figured in his work. The next group of three lines consists of 8, 7, and 6 small cups respectively, surrounded by three lines in the shape of a fork. Then follow 11 lines, first two lines\ncontaining respectively 6 and 5, then three lines of 6, 6, and 7, then another arrangement of three lines with 8, 10, and 11, and lastly yet another arrangement of three lines each of 8 cups. All these cups are small and similar in type to those already noticed.\n\n7. On the lower ledge beneath the first arrangement of three lines of large cups, a further combination of three is noticed, a large cup, then a line of four, then three. These are weather-worn and somewhat indistinct, and may perhaps have been continuations of the upper line. To the left is yet another combination of three, two large cups, the upper one of the first line with a groove, the two next both grooved, and the lower groove joining the two cups, the third also grooved. Then follow two lines containing the one six, the other seven large cups.\n\n8. Sketch III; on plates III and IV, shews cup marks on three separate portions of the rock, the first (A) to the left containing eight cups, one of which is grooved, the second (B) a straight row of sixteen cups, with a row of four running off at right angles in the centre. The last (C) is a curious arrangement of thirteen cups all with grooves or gutters, similar to those figured in Plates IX\u2014XIV and XX of Sir J. Simpson's work.\n\n9. The sculpturings shewn in Sketch IV of pl. III are of a somewhat more elaborate type. The first (A) has perhaps been intended for a cobra, or a leaf. The second (B) is curious from the combination of lines and large cup-marks, some of which are six inches in diameter, and in shape is not unlike the \"Swastika\". The third (C) is of a somewhat similar type, and may be allowed to claim relationship to Fig. 15, Plate II, of Sir J. Simpson's work. The sizes of the markings are roughly noted on the sketches. I have neither the time nor the appliances at present to draw them to scale.\n\n10. From the villagers, and from the old priest at the temple hard by, no information was to be obtained of the origin of these markings, beyond that \"they were so old that the oldest man in the village had no knowledge of who had made them, nor had they been made in the time of their father's father, but they were most probably the work of the giants or the go\u00e1l\u00e1s (herdsmen) in days gone by.\" Much information was perhaps hardly to be expected from the class of persons questioned, but the subject of their possible origin will be noticed more in detail in later paras. of these notes.\n\n11. On visiting the temple sacred to Mah\u00e1deo at the entrance to the gorge, I could not help being struck by the peculiar construction of many of its shrines as bearing a marked resemblance to these rock markings. In addition to the principal shrine, placed within the temple itself, a massive little structure, built up of large stones, many of which would appear to have been taken from Buddhist ruins so plentiful in the neighbourhood of Dw\u00e1r\u00e1-H\u00e1th, I counted 37 minor shrines within the walled enclosure by\nwhich the temple is surrounded. These consist mostly of a rough pedestal formed of loose stones surmounted by a Mah\u00e1deo and yoni. The yoni in the largest of these shrines was a solid block of stone, cut to the well-known \"jew's-harp\" shape, the upright Mah\u00e1deo being slightly carved at the summit and base. Some half a dozen others were more or less solid and well made according to the conventional construction of these symbols. In one case the stone which did service for the yoni, was the cushion-shaped finial of some Buddhist temple, the Mah\u00e1deo being represented by a carved head with high raised cap broken off from some neighbouring ruin. The fragment had been inserted cap downwards in the square hole by which the cushion had been fixed on to the top of the original structure.\n\n12. The remaining shrines were of a much poorer type. But this last class was to me much the most interesting, as suggesting a possible connection between the rock markings and lingam worship. Rough sketches of these types will be found in plate III, which accompanies this paper. The position and arrangement of these symbols and the veneration paid to them, some having been quite recently decked with small offerings of flowers, left no doubt that they equally with the larger and more solid shrines represented the Mah\u00e1deo and yoni. But whereas in the first noticed and better class, as will best be explained by the section E in plate III, the Mah\u00e1deo is represented by an upright stone, this other and poorer type is without the upright, and is apparently a conventional rendering, or sketch of these symbols, roughly cut on the stone, the inner circle representing the Mah\u00e1deo, the outer circle the yoni, the line or lines the gutter, by which the libations and offerings are drained off from this as well as from the more elaborate class of Mah\u00e1deos.\n\nOf this poorer class, i.e. those without the upright, some 20 or 30 may be counted in the Chandeshwar enclosure, from the well-defined inner and outer circles shewn in Fig. A sketch IV of pl. III, to the very poorest class in Figs. B and C, sketch V, which is little more than a rough cup-mark surrounded by a circle and \"gutter\", cut on an easily worked slab, split off from some neighbouring rock. On one such slab I found cup-marks together with the symbols, but as the cups were in all probability on the slab before it was split off from the rock and made to do service on the top of the shrine, no particular significance can be claimed for this circumstance. To facilitate reference, in case no copy of Sir J. Simpson's work is at hand, the several types noticed in the Archaic sculpturings have been copied, and accompany this paper.\n\n13. In the centre of the yard, is a monolith Mah\u00e1deo of 4\u00bd feet in height above the ground, shewn in pl. IV, sketch VI, fig. A. It has no markings on it,\u2014but together with all its surroundings seems very old. The priest in charge of the temple held that most of the shrines were very old, and accoun-\nted for their large number by saying that the yard was the burial-place of men of great sanctity, some of whom had been brought from great distances for interment there, and that Mah\u00e1deos of an elaborate or poor class were placed over the tombs according to the means of the deceased's friends. I have at this moment no means of verifying whether any particular class of Hindus are buried in the hills, or whether my informant intended to convey that ashes only were deposited beneath the shrines, but on this point there will be no difficulty in obtaining information.\n\n14. A few days later I visited, in company with Mr. William Craw, the proprietor of the beautiful D\u00fanagiri estate, the summit of the Pandakoli (Col du G\u00e9ant ?) mountain, which rises to a height of nearly 8,000 feet above the sea, to the north-east of the D\u00fanagiri Tea Factory. Here we found a small open place of worship, composed of two stone circles of the shape and dimensions shewn in pl. IV, Fig. B, sketch VI. The outer circle was of rough stones piled one on the other, with large stones at the entrance. The inner circle was partly of large stones about 8\u00bd feet measuring above the ground, partly of smaller ones\u2014very large stones not being available on the summit. The entrance was to the south. The inner circle was 8 feet, the outer 16 feet in diameter. In the centre of the inner circle were several Mah\u00e1deos, stones split off from the neighbouring rocks and roughly shaped. The shrine was open to the elements on all sides, save where it was partially sheltered by a wild guelder rose to the branches of which some rags had recently been attached as votive offerings by visitors to this place of pilgrimage. A small iron lamp, an old bell, and three small tridents, or 'trisuls', (from the summit of the hill, by the way, a grand view of the three snow peaks of the Trisul mountain and of Nanda Devi may be obtained) completed the furniture of this rustic temple. No priest lives on the hill, which is too cold, jungly, and inaccessible for lengthened sojourn, but a fair is, I learn, held there in the spring, when many pilgrims, chiefly barren women, visit the shrine.\n\n15. The construction of the temple, as shewn in pl. IV, sketch VI, fig. B., appears of some interest when considered in connection with the rock cuttings and shrines at Chandeshwar, some 15 miles distant. Here, as the sketch will shew, are two circles, complete save where the \"gutter\" forms the entrance. The Mah\u00e1deos are in the centre of the inner circle.\n\n16. Another circumstance perhaps deserving of notice is the position of a monolith Mah\u00e1deo, 5\u00bd feet above the ground, situated 8 feet southwest of the shrine, a second monolith of almost the same size was 80 feet due west of the first. If I remember right, the shape of the temple is the same, or nearly the same, as that of Stonehenge, and Avebury, and the outer monolith is in the same position to the Pandakoli shrine, as the \"Friar's Heel\" is to Stonehenge.\n17. Local tradition ascribes the construction of the temple to the P\u00e1nd\u00fas from whom the hill takes its name. In the small lake, visible from the summit, and about 6 miles north-west the P\u00e1nd\u00fas are supposed in days gone by to have washed their garments, whilst the hill top, with its, for the Him\u00e1layas, broad expanse of grassy level, was the drying ground for the P\u00e1nd\u00fa linen. Mr. Craw, who with his gun and dogs has visited most of these little known recesses of the Him\u00e1layas, has kindly promised to keep a look out for similar remains during his sporting excursions.\n\n18. Subsequently, on the march between D\u00fanagiri and Sameshwar, I came across some more monoliths, on the right hand side of the road, close to the Lodh Tea Factory. They are apparently the remains of what once was a considerable structure. In shape the monoliths exactly resemble the Chandeshwar Mah\u00e1deo. But on the one is carved a circle intended perhaps for the moon; on the other, what looks like a sun. If I mistake not, there is supposed to be some connection between sun and moon worship and the worship of the Mah\u00e1deo and the yoni, the sun taking the place of the Mah\u00e1deo, the moon of the yoni.\n\n19. Some three miles further on, on the right hand side of the road just above a little village distinguishable by its Deod\u00e1r trees, and a small temple belonging to the Bidran\u00e1th Mahant, I halted for a short time to examine a mass of boulders lying round a mound, which from a distance bore some resemblance to the tumuli common in Central and Southern India. On its summit was a shrine about two feet high of peculiar construction, consisting of a sort of box, like a Kistvaen, formed of four slabs of stone imbedded in the earth, a fifth and movable slab forming the top, or cover. Within, sheltered from the weather by these slabs, was a small stone Mah\u00e1deo, or ling, daubed with red paint, and a small iron lamp. Outside the Kistvaen was a second and smaller stone Mah\u00e1deo, and on it, apparently taking the place of the red paint, a cup mark.\n\n20. A further examination of the site indicated the existence round the mound of an outer and inner circle of stones, the larger of about 30 feet in diameter. The mound was in the midst of irrigated, and well cared for rice fields, and the boulders, lying about in disorder, had apparently been disturbed to make way for the plough in the absence of a Kam\u00e1on \"Sir J. Lubbock's Act\" for the preservation of ancient remains. But the circular shape of the mound and of the arrangement of the boulders surrounding it, some of which were too heavy to be displaced, was still traceable. One of the boulders, a huge mass measuring 7 feet in height by 13 feet in length by 9 feet in breadth, which could successfully defy most attempts at displacement, had five rows of cup marks still traceable on it, whilst other rows much weather-worn could with some difficulty be made out. About half a mile further on, I again found cup-marks on a somewhat smaller group of boulders, among the rice fields.\n21. The villagers' view of the matter was, as usual, that the marks were those of the giants, and that the little shrine at the top of the hill was the burial-place of a holy man, the same as the Chandeshwar account. The Kistvaen was evidently modern. But this fact would not affect the view that the original tumulus was of old date. It may often be noticed how later comers adopt the sites chosen by their predecessors for places of worship or sepulture. Of this Dw\u00e1r\u00e1-H\u00e1th is an example, whilst perhaps one of the most striking instances may be seen in the Chand\u00e1 District at Narkand\u00e1, not far from the confluence of the Waingang\u00e1 and the God\u00e1var\u00ed. Here a ridge of rocks running across the stream forms a natural anicut, ensuring a fine and constant reach of deep water during even the hottest and driest months. On the left bank of the stream are groups of temples of some half a dozen distinct types, from the Cyclopean class, massive blocks of stone without ornament, and evidently of a very early date, up to the recent florid additions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur. And a case came under my own notice some years back, in which a fak\u00edr was buried in the middle of one of the largest of the stone circles of the Higna group, near the city of N\u00e1gpur, a tumulus certainly several hundreds of years old. The first comers chose good sites and built and buried there. Later on, the remains of temples or tombs suggested the eligibility of those sites, and the later comers borrowed not only the idea of the position, but building materials also from the ruins.\n\n22. In the above remarks I have tried to confine myself to what I saw and heard on the spot, and have as far as possible avoided mixing up therewith speculations on the origin and significance of the remains. I am generally content to do this, and to leave the analysis of what I may collect and what may appear of interest, to those, who, from the appliances and information at their disposal, are able to subject such enquiries to reliable tests, and to extract from my rough jottings any grains of the true ore which may be therein contained. And on the present occasion, having only one or two books of reference with me, (my baggage being necessarily restricted during a march among the Him\u00e1layas to what can be carried on the backs of a limited number of men) it may be especially undesirable to advance what may appear to be very crude theories regarding the significance of these markings. I am nevertheless tempted to add to my notes a few remarks and suggestions, more in the hope of evoking some discussion from those who are better informed than myself, and who, with the library of the Asiatic Society ready at hand, can supply omissions or correct any misapprehensions into which I have fallen, than with any intention of appearing to attempt dogmatise on a subject on which I cannot, of course, claim to write with any sort of authority.\n\n23. In the first place I would desire to notice, with reference to the\nmarkings described in paras. 8 to 10 of these notes, (for this paper has been divided into paragraphs, in order to facilitate reference to the several points mentioned) that since I had the pleasure to bring to the notice of the Society the existence of markings on the stone circles of Central India similar to the Archaic sculpturings on similar circles in Europe, that the subject has been advanced a stage by the discovery, not only of the single type of \"cup marks\", but of two or three other distinct types, nearly exactly resembling those treated of, and figured by, the late Sir J. Simpson in his work already alluded to.\n\n24. In addition to the \"cup-marks\" of which so many examples are to be found at Chandeshwar and in the Sameshwar valley, we have now the second type, i.e. the cup mark enclosed in a circle\u2014also the types given at Figs. 14 and 15 of Plate II, and in other plates, of Sir J. Simpson's work. A comparison of the accompanying sketches, which, although rough, are sufficiently accurate, with the plates in Sir J. Simpson's volume, will, I believe, leave little doubt of an extraordinary resemblance between the markings found on similar classes of remains in Northumberland, and in many parts of Scotland, Ireland, Brittany, Norway, Denmark, &c.\n\nExtracts from Sir J. Simpson's descriptions of these markings and tracings of some of the plates accompany this paper, in case the work should not be immediately available.\n\n25. Sir J. Simpson holds that these markings in Europe are not of natural formation, and an examination of these series of lines and holes in Kam\u00e1on will lead to the same conclusion, and leave little doubt that the same view holds good in India also. The distinct rows in which the cups are arranged, the shapes other than that of \"holes\" assumed, indicate design and suggest that the sculpturings are artificial, not natural. Sir J. Simpson meets the view that those in Europe are of recent formation and have been made perhaps by the shepherd boys on which to play a sort of game of draughts, by shewing that the cup-marks are more often on the sides of boulders, or on the face of rocks, where no such game could be played; and the same remark holds good for the Central Indian and Kam\u00e1on cup-marks. And, after all, even admitting that this view correctly accounts for the cup-marks, it would not dispose of the origin of the other rough sculpturings.\n\n26. Moreover the people of the neighbourhood have no tradition of the origin of the remains or of the markings on them save that they are the work of the giants, or the go\u00e1l\u00e1s, which in their minds means the far past. No one there has any knowledge of the markings being of recent construction.\n\n27. And here attention may be called to the circumstance that the idea of such remains being the work of the \"go\u00e1l\u00e1s\", or herdmen, is identical in Kam\u00e1on and in Central India, also many hundreds of miles south. In Central India tradition points to the existence of a Go\u00e1l\u00e1 dynasty, a\nrace of nomads, \"Shepherd Kings\", who held the country before the advent of Aryan civilisation, and here among the Himalayas, the same idea seems to prevail, and to the same people is attributed the construction of similar Cyclopean works. All this would seem to indicate that the markings are not of modern origin.\n\n28. Then as to the significance, if any, of these markings. First as to the cup-marks. They are generally arranged in rows, large and small. Sometimes a row is composed entirely of large and small marks. Often the large and small holes are found in juxta-position. The combinations and permutations are numerous. This would seem to suggest that the markings have some significance, and are not so arranged for ornament only. In a brief paper written for the late Earl of Mayo, shortly before his death, on the cup-markings found in Central India, and which I believe it was Lord Mayo's intention to communicate to the Royal Irish Academy, by which Society the subject of cup markings on similar remains in Ireland had been discussed, it was suggested by me that these markings might possibly represent a primitive form of writing. The Agham writing consists of combinations of long and short strokes cut on sandstone. On sandstone it would be easier to cut lines with the grain, so to speak, of the stone. To attempt to make a cup mark would be to risk splitting the slab. On the other hand to cut a line on hard trap would be difficult, whereas to work an iron instrument round and round so as to make a \"cup-mark\", would be comparatively easy. It was also pointed out that the American invention by which a record of the message sent by the Electric Telegraph is made by the instrument itself, the most primitive style of marking, or writing on the paper was necessarily adopted. And the letters in the Morse Code are consequently composed of numerous combinations of long and short strokes. In Army signalling, which I saw recently carried on here from the hill tops by men of the 19th (Princess of Wales's Own) Regiment stationed at R\u00e1n\u00edkhet, the same simple system is adopted to represent letters by long and short wavings of a flag. By night a lamp is used, long and short flashes taking the place of the long and short wavings of the flag. It is then perhaps not impossible that the many permutations of large and small cup markings may have some such sort of significance having been adopted as a primitive style of record many hundreds of years back by a people who had not advanced very far in civilisation. I have not had time during my recent march in Kam\u00e1on to collect many specimens of such permutations, and have been obliged to content myself with the knowledge of the existence of such markings in many parts of the province, leaving any further investigations for some future pleasant holiday. But the permutations at Chandeshwar, as the annexed sketch will show, are numerous enough for the sake of the argument, if\nindeed it has any force at all. And the accompanying rough sketch VIII, (Pl. IV) of some of the Central Indian markings, shewing many permutations, will assist still further to explain my views, such as they are on the subject.\n\n29. Next as to the possible further significance of some of the markings. If the remarks in para. 12 et seq. and the rough sketches annexed have in any way helped to explain my views, then it will be seen that a resemblance exists between the Chandeshwar rock and European markings, and the shrines in the temple at the mouth of the Chandeshwar gorge. That many of the shrines are of recent construction is evident. It will hardly be contested that the last of types 2, 4, and 5 of Plate I, of Sir J. Simpson's book, bear a striking resemblance to the Mah\u00e1deo and yoni marks on the Chandeshwar shrines. The centre mark would appear to do duty for the lings, the circle for the yoni\u2014and the \"gutter\" is the depression to be found on most stone yonis, by means of which the votive libations are drained off from the symbols. And here it may be noticed that in Mah\u00e1deo worship, the offering of flowers, and the pouring of a libation, generally of Ganges water, over the symbols is, so far as I have seen, very general. Those who have visited Benares will remember the little spoons resembling somewhat our Apostle's spoons, some of them beautifully chased, with a figure or cobra at the upper end of the handle, used by pilgrims and worshippers at that city in sprinkling the holy water over the Mah\u00e1deos there. In Kam\u00e1on little niches are to be noticed in Mah\u00e1deo temples with stone receptacles for holy water, not unlike what are seen in churches abroad. And the temple at Baijn\u00e1th boasts of a large, well-carved figure, holding a bowl, which the priest informed me held Ganges water, and from which pilgrims sprinkle the Mah\u00e1deo placed close by.\n\n30. Then again in connection with the monolith Mah\u00e1deos found at Chandeshwar, Pandukoli, and Lodh, mentioned in para. 13 et seq., it may be worth noticing that circles, and what I will call the \"conventional symbols\" of the Mah\u00e1deo and yoni, are found on exactly similar monoliths in Europe; take for instance Figs. 2 and 3 of Plate xvii of Sir J. Simpson's work.\n\n31. In India these monoliths are found in the centre and in proximity to shrines bearing these markings. Sometimes a circle is found cut on them, and again the shape of the place of worship at Pandukoli with its double circle of stones, in the centre of the inner of which are the Mah\u00e1deos, is as nearly as possible exactly that of these conventional markings.\n\n32. If I am not mistaken, this too is the shape of Stonehenge, and other remains in Europe in the vicinity of which monoliths similar to Indian Mah\u00e1deos and bearing incisions similar to the \"conventional symbols\" are found. It seems then hardly improbable that the ruins in\nEurope are the remains of that primitive form of worship which is known to have extended at one time over a great portion of the globe, and which still exists all over India, and that these markings are the rude records of a nomadic race which at an early epoch of the world's history left the Central Asian nursery, and travelling in different directions have left their traces, in Europe as in India, of tumuli and rock sculpturings, generally to be found in hill countries, and inaccessible spots whither at a later period they were forced to retreat before the advance of a more civilised and a more powerful race. The one being what are generally known by the somewhat vague term of Scythians or Shepherd kings, the other the Aryans, descended from the same parent stock, and who later were forced by the necessities of increasing numbers to emigrate from the common Central Asian home, and to explore and conquer the rich countries far to the West and South. Baron Bonstetten's Map of the localities in which archaic remains are found (Plate xxxiii of Sir J. Simpson's work) supports this view. Kistvaens, barrows, cup-marks, rock sculpturings, all more or less of the same type, abound in all the corners of the European Continent indicating that the people who constructed them, were driven thither by a wave of invasion surging from some central point. And so also in India, these remains are found, not in the plains and open country, but in the forests, among the fastnesses of the hills, in the gorges of the Him\u00e1layas and Nilgiris, on the Highlands of Central India in that Cul-de-sac of the N\u00e1gp\u00far country, which was long protected by its natural rampart of the S\u00e1tpuras with their \"abattis\" of dense forest, from the effects of Northern Invasion.\n\n38. I am aware that the view of these markings having reference to Lingam worship is not now advanced for the first time. The subject is alluded to at page 93 of Sir J. Simpson's work but only to be summarily dismissed with the following brief remark:\n\n\"Two archaeological friends of mine, dignitaries in the Episcopal Church, have separately formed the idea that the lapidary cups and circles are emblems of old female Lingam worship, a supposition which appears to me to be totally without any anatomical or other foundation, and one altogether opposed by all we know of the specific class of symbols used in that worship, either in ancient or modern times.\"\n\nI am sanguine, however, that if the late Sir J. Simpson had seen the sketches of what I have called the \"conventional symbols\" on the shrines at Chandeshwar, and had been able to compare them with some of the types figured in his work, he might have been inclined to modify the opinion above extracted. The treatment of these symbols is purely conventional, they bear no anatomical resemblance to anything, they are unlike many of the large well known and acknowledged representations of the Mah\u00e1deo and\nStill they nevertheless represent the same idea. And here it may be noticed that the same argument of anatomical non-resemblance might be advanced in regard to the well known representations, common throughout India, of the meaning of which to the initiated there is no doubt at all. To the uninitiated, however, the shapes convey nothing, and I have known cases of Europeans who have been many years in the country who were quite unsuspicious of what \"that jew's-harp idol\", as they called it, was intended to represent. As the old priest at Chandeshwar said, \"Those who can afford it, put up a big Mah\u00e1deo; those who can't, put up these slabs.\" And so also with us. The rich relations or friends of the Christian may put up over his grave a solid richly-carved stone cross. The grave of a poor man, if marked at all, has over it perhaps two pieces of wood nailed together in shape of a cross, or a cross roughly cut on a piece of stone. The Christian Church is built in the form of a cross. In Pandukoli and many other spots, the Mah\u00e1deo temples are built in the shape of the conventional symbols of that faith. And inasmuch as the symbols of the Mah\u00e1deo and yoni can be more conveniently indicated on stone or on paper by what may be called a ground plan than by a section, the form shewn in pl. III, Fig. A, Sketch V, was apparently first adopted, and this degenerated into the rough conventional treatment of the cup-mark and circle so common on monoliths in many parts of Europe.\n\n33. In the view that these markings are nothing but a conventional rendering of the Mah\u00e1deo and yoni, I am further confirmed by what has recently been brought to my remembrance, of the manner in which an Am\u00edn, or native Surveyor, will indicate a Mah\u00e1deo temple on his plotting. I remember that the sign used to mark the position of such temples by the Am\u00edns in the Field Survey of the Chand\u00e1 Revenue Settlement, in which district I was Settlement Officer some few years ago, and where this form of worship is very common, almost exactly resembled the sketch in Figs. B and C, plate III, sketch V. It is not unlike the form of the Vestal Lamp. Indeed on the summit of a hill near R\u00e1n\u00edkhet, on the top of a pile of stones which did duty for a Mah\u00e1deo shrine, I found a small slab, bearing an almost exact resemblance to the well known form of the classic lamp. In the hole into which oil is poured, a small upright Mah\u00e1deo is placed.\n\n34. Perhaps enough has now been said regarding the possible significance of these markings to ensure some discussion and to elicit an expression of opinion from those who are better qualified than I can claim to be to speak with authority on the subject. I at least hope that some of the Members of the Society may be able to put me right where my information is incorrect or imperfect. Hereafter, with the help of some references and notes which I have in my library in the plains, I shall hope to be able to endeavour to trace these barrows and rocks, together with their markings,\nfrom Madras, through Central India, and the Him\u00e1layas, and thus on through Central Asia to the Crimea and South Eastern Europe. From thence there will be but little difficulty in completing the chain, through the Continent of Europe, to our own Islands. And if this is done, then there would seem to exist a sufficiently distinct tracing of the routes adopted by the tribe, one section of which went West, the other South, in their search for fresh climes and pastures new, at a period of which there is but faint historical record, save on the rough stones and temples with their markings of a type which are common to both Europe and India.\n\n35. Before concluding these rough, and necessarily imperfect, notes, I must add two extracts, which I have found since I began to write, amongst my limited baggage, and both of which seem to bear directly on the subjects above noticed.\n\nAt para. 17, the local tradition which attributes the construction of the circles on the summit of the Pandukoli hill to the P\u00e1nd\u00fas has been noticed. Here is an exactly similar tradition regarding an almost exactly similar class of remains near Salem in the Madras Presidency, many hundreds of miles to the south of the Him\u00e1layas.\n\n\"In a paper on Tumuli in the Salem District the Rev. Maurice Phil-lips, of the London Missionary Society, arrives at the conclusion that the tumuli were the burial-places of the non-Aryan aboriginal inhabitants of the South, who are now represented by the Dravidians, and who, like the pre-Aryan inhabitants of the North, are proved by their language to have belonged to the same branch of the human family as the Turanians; that their ancient customs and religion disappeared before the combined influence of Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Jainism, precisely in the same way as the ancient customs of the Teutons, Celts, Latins, and Slavs disappeared in Europe before the influence of Christianity, or the ancient customs of the Scythians of Central Asia disappeared before the influence of Muhammadanism. If this theory be correct, no tumuli in the plains of India are later than the thirteenth century A.D. and on the Neilgherry Hills, probably none are later than the fifteenth or sixteenth century A.D. The natives know nothing about the tumuli, and according to Dr. Caldwell there is no tradition respecting them either in Sanskrit literature or in that of the Dravidian languages. The Tamil people call them Pandu-Kuris, Kuri means a pit or grave, and Pandu denotes anything connected with the P\u00e1nd\u00fas, or P\u00e1ndava brothers, to whom all over India ancient mysterious structures are generally attributed. To call anything a work of the P\u00e1n-d\u00fas is equivalent to terming it 'Cyclopean' in Greece, a work of 'Picts' in Scotland, or 'a work of Nimrod' in Asiatic Turkey.\"\n\n36. And the following extract from an article in the Madras Times of the 7th February, 1876, bears equally on the subject.\n\"The village of Jala is about fourteen miles from Bangalor situated at the base of a large isolated rocky hill; upon the summit of which is a little grassy dell, stretching out in front of a cave, that has been converted into a small picturesque temple. It is but a small village, the temple is curiously built against the side of a low rocky hill, a cave forming the sanctum. It possesses no architectural beauty, and is interesting only from the fact that the priest in charge, a wild looking fanatic, apparently about sixty years of age, has never left its precincts, for more than forty years, nor has he allowed the lights in the holy place to go out for that period! The whole neighbourhood is thickly covered with cromlechs; near the village there are at least one hundred plainly to be seen. These cromlechs are surrounded by circles of stones, some of them with concentric circles three and four deep. One very remarkable in appearance has four circles of large stones round it, and is called by the natives \"Pandavara Gudi\" or the temple of the Pandus, who are popularly supposed to have been the descendants of the Pandavas, the five sons of the Raja Pandu.......The smaller cromlechs are designated \"Pandasiara Mane\" or the houses of the Pandus. This is supposed to be the first instance, where the natives popularly imagine a structure of this kind to have been the temple of a by-gone if not of a mythical race..........Many of these curious structures have a triple circle, some a double, and a few single circles of stones round them, but in diameter they are nearly equal, the outer circle varying from thirty-seven to forty feet.\"\n\n37. I extract also from page 185, 5th Series VI, September 2nd, 1876 of \"Notes and Queries\", a note shewing that the custom of hanging shreds of rags on trees as votive offerings, still exists in Ireland, that country of stone circles. The sacred tree at the Pandukoli temple or stone circle was, as noticed at paragraph 14, similarly decked at the time of our visit, and the custom is, as is well known, common throughout India.\n\n\"Anatolian Folk-lore.\u2014The custom of hanging shreds of rags on trees as votive offerings still obtains in Ireland. I remember as a child to have been surreptitiously taken by an Irish nurse to St. John's Well, Aghada, County Cork, on the vigil of the Saint's day, to be cured of whooping cough by drinking three times of the water of the holy well. I shall never forget the strange spectacle of men and women \"paying rounds\", creeping on their knees in voluntary devotion or in obedience to enjoined penance so many times round the well, which was protected by a grey stone hood, and had a few white-thorn trees growing near it, on the spines of which fluttered innumerable shreds of frieze and vary-coloured rags, the votive offerings of devotees and patients.\"\n\nThe proceedings at the Pandukoli Fair might be described in almost similar words.\nP. S. Since the above paper was written, I had the pleasure of meeting, at the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi, Mr. Campbell of Islay, now on a visit to this country, who has taken much interest in the subject of the Scotch Rock-markings. To him I shewed copies of the rough sketches, and explained briefly the views noticed in this paper. Mr. Campbell has since visited Ayodhy\u00e1, and has been good enough to send me a note on his enquiries there, from which the following is an extract:\n\n\"January 8th, 1877. Benares.\n\n\"Having seen sketches and notes on rock Sculptures in India which closely resemble unexplained rock carvings in Scotland; and having myself found one of the Scotch forms cut on a boulder in K\u00e1ngr\u00e1, I was set on the right scent by Mr. Rivett-Carnac at Delhi. Being at Ayodhy\u00e1 with a Hindu who speaks good English, I got a fak\u00edr and drew on the sand of the Gogra the figure\n\nI asked what that meant. The fak\u00edr at once answered,\n\n\"Mahad\u00e9o\". I then drew and got the same answer. At Delhi, my old acquaintance Mr. Shaw told me that these two signs are chalked on stones in K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 by people marching in marriage processions. The meaning given to these two symbols now in India is familiarly known to the people. Many other Scotch signs may probably find an explanation here. One in particular I take to be the Trisul. I brought a number of Scotch signs with me. I have got a number of marks from natives who still use them.\"\n\nMr. Whiteley Stokes, too, knowing the interest taken by me in the subject, has been good enough to send me a copy of the Journal of Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland for July, 1875, containing Mr. W. F. Wakeman's paper on Rock-markings in the County of Fermansagh.\n\nThe sketches and description of these Irish rock markings correspond almost exactly with the Kam\u00e1on markings noticed in this paper.\nThe Kaim\u00fbr Range.\u2014By Chandrasekhara B\u00e1nurji,\nDeputy Magistrate, Bongong.\n\nGeneral features.\u2014The Kaim\u00fbr Range is a spur of the double-ridged Vindhya. It is the more easterly of the three so called Table-lands of Central India, each of which has for its floor the three great varieties of the gray, the red, and the yellowish sandstones. It shoots out from the District of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur in the \"inhospitable regions\" of which the goddess Baran has selected one of her mountain abodes under the name of Vindhya-v\u00e1shini. From this region the range stretches eastwards in a lofty plateau, forming a belt of upwards of 130 miles, with an average breadth of 35. The mighty Sona, pent up on both banks by high ridges, flows along the foot of this Table-land until touching almost the base of the northern arm under the summit of Roht\u00e1s, takes then a turn, and cuts a north-easterly course through the open plains of South Bih\u00e1r. The mountain chain, however, bends northward sending out smaller spurs, until reaching Sahasr\u00e1m, it may be said to terminate with the dome of the Chandan Sayyid mount. From this point the chain relapses gradually into the plain, re-appearing once only fourteen miles off in two small blue knolls at Nokh\u00e1.\n\nAlthough occupying a vast extent of country whose breadth across the plateau exceeds at places forty miles, hardly any of its peaks attains the height of 2,200 feet.* Its small elevation reminds one of the curse of Vindhya to which the Hindu mythological accounts often allude. \"Vindhya, having prostrated before his spiritual guide Agra Sila, still remains in that posture by the command of the holy personage. This humiliation is the punishment for his presumption in emulating the lofty heights of the Him\u00e1laya and the Meru\". According to this legend Vindhya has one foot at Chan\u00e1r, the true name of that fortress being \"Charan\u00e1dri,\" and another at Gay\u00e1. The vulgar inconsistently suppose that the head of the prostrate mountain is near the Temple of Vindhya-v\u00e1shini.\n\nThe ancient name of the country along which this chain extends was Kaira Des, from the Daitya of that name known to tradition as its earliest king. The range was probably known as the Kairo M\u00e1li, corrupted to Kaim\u00fbr. The Pur\u00e1\u1e47as and the natives however still call it the Vindhya M\u00e1li, whose summit are crowned with the shrines of the goddess Barani under different names, Vindhya-v\u00e1shini being the foremost and more widely known than the rest. Vindhya-v\u00e1shini was the offspring of Yasod\u00e1, being supposed to be the same child which was made over by Vasudeva to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ka\u00f1\u015ba\u2020 the\n\n* Colebrooke's journey to N\u00e1gpur.\n\u2020 'For Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.' St. Matthew, Chap. II. The similarity of the story was pointed out by Sir William Jones.\nmerciless tyrant of Mathur\u00e1. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ka\u00f1\u00e1 attempted to kill this child by dashing her against a stone. The girl, who was the manifestation of Sakt\u00ed, or the creative energy of the Deity, gave the slip, hovered over Ka\u00f1\u00e1 in the form of a kite, warned him of his future fate at the hands of the youth who was being reared at Gokula, and steered her aerial flight until she perched on the peak near which her shrine now stands, four miles south of Mirz\u00e1pur. The entire range of the Vindhya M\u00e1li is dedicated to the shrines of Baran\u00ed, and is itself considered a mass of sacred matter, which the hill-men adore as Dharti or the earth-god. The spirit of the great goddess guards the heights of the chain and its gh\u00e1ts, fences its steep sides, and protects the hill-men from falls and surprises, from wild animals and wilder demons. If the votaries of Vishnu, of S\u00e1kya and of the Sun had struggled to establish their respective cults on the right bank of the Son, the left has been held undisputedly and solely by the worshippers of Sakt\u00ed. In Gay\u00e1 we have the shrines of Buddha, Vishnu and Surya-n\u00e1r\u00e1ya\u1e47a predominant in different quarters of the district. On the opposite bank we have fanes of the several manifestations of Um\u00e1 alone. Vindhy\u00e9swari, Bhav\u00e1ni, Tripur\u00e1, M\u00fand\u00e9swari and T\u00e1r\u00e1shand\u00ed are perched on the summits of the Kaim\u00far Range. The goddess undoubtedly exercises great sway on these heights. Owing to her influence it is thought that demons in the shape of painful diseases kill few of the hill-men. Fewer still fall a prey to the wild animals. Peace reigns throughout the length and breadth of the Chero and Kharw\u00e1r hamlets. Few crimes are perpetrated, although fewer, we suspect, are reported, and one Police head-constable accordingly, with two assistants posted on the tableland, has been sufficient for a number of years to keep British prestige alive over this extensive range.\n\nThe great peculiarity in the formation of the range is its steepness. The flat tablelands on its top are supported by precipitous sides which rise suddenly from fields where there is hardly a stone to impede the plough. About a third of these heights near the base is generally covered with a slope of rubbish which it must have taken ages to wash down. The tall crests of many a forest tree crown these slopes. But immediately above these, the sides are mere layers of primitive rocks, barren and black at places, high rocky walls standing in bold prominence against the blue sky. In others the walls bend into glens and recesses where a little dip between two summits serves as the channel for whirling cataracts. The spots below these cataracts are generally sacred pools which retain water throughout the year, and enable many important streams to flow down to the plains. \"After* a clear drop of two to six hundred feet, the water splashes into a deep tarn scooped out by its continual falling, on leaving which it runs through a channel several miles in length, and obstructed\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey, Vol. VII, p. 20.\nthroughout its course with huge masses of rock fallen from above. From each side of the stream rise the undercliffs of the escarpment, covered with tangled jungle and debris, and crowned by vertical precipices which cut off all access to the plateau above, save by one or two narrow paths known only to the wood-cutter or the charcoal-burners, by whom alone the gorge is ever visited.\"\n\nGeological features.\u2014The escarpment of the Kaim\u00fbr Range which faces the Son for more than 200 miles between Roht\u00e1sgarh and Bilharf is nearly a straight line for the entire length, without any indentation, except the curve at Bijayagarh. The northern escarpment, however, from Sahasr\u00e1m westward is deeply indented by intricate and ramifying gorges. The spurs which shoot out from the main range on the northern face seldom lie detached. They either project like bastions, or run in belts to join ultimately the chain itself, although there are some breaks between the ramparts to serve as passes to the wild glens embosomed by them.\n\nAt places the chain runs in double lines, branching off and extending for miles in two parallel high upright walls, enclosing a narrow strip of land between their feet, and displaying only a short strip of the sky over their summits. These long labyrinthine glens are cut by the beds of some mountain streams, with trees along their banks, and transparent pools along their stony beds.\n\nThe stone of the hills is chiefly composed of sandstones of different hues, varying from gray to red, either in the grains or the veins. It is to this sandstone that the mountains owe their grand appearance, displaying the most stupendous precipices. In his geological account of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Major Sherwill observes\u2014\"The vast precipices exhibited in this sandstone admirably display the horizontal formation of the mass; one of the precipices at the foot of Roht\u00e1s, I found by measurement to be 1,300 feet, a sheer mass of stone without a bush or tree on its surface; it is situated close to an over-hanging mass of building known as the Haj\u00e1m's palace, a few minutes walk from the gateway leading up from R\u00e9jgh\u00e1t. The echo at this spot, which is a complete amphitheatre of precipices, is very distinct and grand, giving seven distinct responses to several syllables; the report of a gun reverberates like thunder; the sandstone at this spot is of a dark red, an overhanging rock at this spot enabling a person to look over and to fully contemplate this fearful abyss.\"\n\nNext to the sandstone is the limestone. From the fact of its appearing in many places, though far apart, separated even for many miles, Major Sherwill was inclined to think that \"it penetrates in unbroken stratum under the sandstone.\" Mixed with the limestone is chalk, called by the natives khar\u00ed matti, \"which is unctuous to the touch\", \"has a shiny appearance, but soils the fingers.\"\nHornstone, which may ordinarily be mistaken for chlorite, is found in many layers along the face of the precipice at the Tuttula Kund, four miles west of Tilauth\u00fa. I am informed that this stone is also met with at Jadun\u00e1thpur on the southern edge of the range; and four miles west of the kho or recess, a hill of the same mineral projects into the Son and causes rapids. The black crests on the limestones, or bands of shales near Bijayag\u00e1rah, led to the belief that coal existed in the Kaim\u00far range. The report originated, so far back as 1837, with Mr. Hyland, and Mr. Osborne of the Opium Department was deputed to investigate. But Mr. Osborne's, as well as later, investigations have shown that the similarity of the shales with coal ends unfortunately in the appearance, as they are perfectly incombustible and mere argilaceous matter.\n\nThe sacred cave of Gupta is an opening in a calcareous hill where the flags are thin and white, approaching in appearance to unpolished slates of marble.\n\nGneiss and Quartz are remarkably absent in the Kaim\u00far Range, although they occur in the North West, in the Vindhyas, and the ridges south of the Son.\n\nFrom what has been written above, it may easily be imagined that the stones of the Kaim\u00far Range consist of two principal layers. The upper terrace is the so-called Kaim\u00far sandstone. The lower the limestone with bands of 'pencil'-coloured shales at places which were mistaken for coal. Major Sherwill estimated the thickness of the sandstone layer at Roht\u00e1s at 1,300 feet, but towards the west, the escarpments are reduced to 6 or 700 feet. The thickness of the shales at Durg\u00e1vati and Bijayag\u00e1rah varies from 200 to 150 feet. They are quite black and brittle.\n\n\"The stratigraphy of the hills\", observes Mr. Mallet, \"is very simple on the whole, the various bands being spread horizontally over wide areas, and it is only in a few special regions of disturbance that the geology is at all complicated. Taken generally, the upper Vindhyas are made up of several thick masses of sandstone with alternatives of shale which in lithological character frequently preserve a remarkable uniformity over immense areas.\"\n\nThe southern edge of the range appears to be higher from the fact that almost all the rivers that take their rise on the plateau flow towards the north, none going towards the south to the Son. The two more important of these streams are the Durg\u00e1vati and the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1.\n\nThe Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1, notwithstanding its seemingly crystal water, is a detested stream. In a country where almost every stream is a good nymph of the valley, and melts and flows either to fertilize its banks or to purify sinners, the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1 forms an exception. Its water is unholy, and a dip into it is sufficient to destroy the virtues of the simple savage and\nthose of the holy saint. The common story about it is, that in the illustrious race of the sun, there lived a king by the name of Trinsankhu, who, among other horrid sins, was guilty of incest and of the murder of a Br\u00e1hman. To wash away the taint it was necessary to collect the waters of all the sacred pools and streams in the world. From the holy bath thus formed, the prince having been washed, the defiled waters flowed into a river, and formed the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1. Religious Hindus must carefully avoid the slightest touch of the waters. Beneath this superstition, there is probably a simple warning against its use on hygienic grounds only.\n\nThe Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed takes its rise in the Kaderkh\u00f3, a valley of exceeding beauty, \"dark, deep, and cold.\" Descending from the tablelands, it winds on, some six miles north, to the Sugi\u00e1kh\u00f3, which strikes off to the west, and stretches some ten miles between steep walls of rock. The valley is there contracted into a few hundred feet, through which the stream cuts its course into the open country. After a very winding flow it meets the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1 along with other tributaries, the entire volume of water falling on the northern slope of the range being thus ultimately drained through the channel of the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1 only to the Ganges.\n\nThe Son, although it takes its rise in a more distant country, drains the southern slope, and is both a source of beauty and strength to the tract lying between it and the hill range. It is also considered a sacred stream. Mr. Wheeler gives a tradition which assigns the easterly course of the Son to disappointed love with the Narmad\u00e1. The story which is locally current here is, however, different. According to it, the Son was originally confined within the sacred pool of Amarakan\u1e6dak. On the banks of this pool stood the hermitage of Jamadagni, the father of Para\u015bur\u00e1ma. Near at hand a rustic once drove his plough to which he attached a calf and its dam. The calf resented this cruelty by driving its horns into the chest of the ploughman, who died on the spot. This taint of sin turned black the white skin of the calf; on going into the pool, however, the calf was purified and regained its original colour. Para\u015bur\u00e1ma observed this, and considered that the pure waters of the pool should be sent out for the good of humanity. He cleft the side of the spring with one stroke of his parasu or axe, and thus made the infant Son stream away. The left bank of the Son, which at present includes the district of Gay\u00e1, was called the K\u00edta Des.*\n\n* In confirmation of this name, the following text may be cited:\n\n\u0915\u094b\u091f\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0915\u0941 \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u0903; \u0928\u0926\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d\u0964\u0964\n\nThe modern name of the \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d is the Pun-pun. Deokuli in the Arwal Parganah was the hermitage of Chavana Muni, where an annual fair is still held. R\u00e1jagriha in Bih\u00e1r is too well known to require notice.\nsacred spots in this country. But the Kaira Des* which extended along the left bank of the river, was generally considered sacred, and therefore the region of the Kaimur Range proper.\n\nProductions. The timbers of the hills are on the whole poor. Where properly taken care of by the zemindars, such as in the glen of Koendi, the sal or sakna grows to a respectable size and serves for beams. But generally the tree is stunted. It is difficult, however, to say whether the poverty is owing to reckless and continual cuttings, or to the sterility of the soil itself. Both causes have been at work from time immemorial. Nevertheless the asan (Terminalia alata tomentosa), the pi\u00e1l (Buchanania latifolia), the wild j\u00e1man, the mohn\u00e1, the keond, and the arjuna grow luxuriant in the lower valleys, while the profuse scarlet flowers of the Butea frondosa along the slopes of the outer hills impress one with the propriety of the name of Pal\u00e1sas given by the ancients to the country now included in the Division of Bih\u00e1r. The hills supply bamboos, and other wood which suffice for the buildings of the natives, and are taken down a great way off down the Son during the freshes.\n\nLac-dye is extracted from the small branches of various trees, such as the knsum and the p\u00edpal. The white silk cocoon, which is larger than elsewhere, grows on many plants, principally on the asan tree (Terminalia alata). Of other forest produce may be mentioned bees\u2019-wax, the haritaki (myrabalan) large and small; the bah\u00e9r\u00e1 (Terminalia Belerica) used both for dye and medicine, the amla or amlaki used for pickles, a kind of Mimosa used as medicine in cases of diarrhoea. The catechu, cherange, a sort of small almond which is greatly relished by the Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed, the bagai a sort of grass extensively used for ropes, answering to the sar-mangu of Bengal, the kaneri, and chitti complete the list.\n\nThe kaneri is a sort of yam resembling in appearance garlic with a slight rosy tinge; a size is made of it for dressing new-woven cloth, and the natives say that it is exported to countries beyond India.\n\n* In opposition to a common belief among certain European scholars, Dr. R\u00e9jendral\u00e1la Mitra, in his great work on Orissa, urges that \u201cthe policy of the Br\u00e1hmans was not to excite an odium theologicum, but to enlist the sympathy of the people in behalf of their creed, by advancing half way and agreeing to a compromise.\u201d As one instance to illustrate this theory, we may say that the belief that the left bank of the Son on which Buddha Gay\u00e1 stands is more sacred than the right one, was adopted by the Br\u00e1hmans from the Buddhists. The following anecdote will show what we mean: \u201cThe death of R\u00e9j\u00e9 Madden, the Balwand Ruler of the Kharw\u00e1rs, was approaching. It was considered unlucky to die on the southern bank of the Son, and he was consequently removed to the northern bank where he remained awaiting his death\u201d.\u2014Sherring\u2019s Aboriginal Tribes.\nThe chitti is a sort of hemp extracted from the stalk of a wild plant of that name whose culture cannot be too much recommended. Both in gloss and silkiness it is superior to jute or any other flax that we know of in the country. The \"s\u00e1l-gind\" which Dr. Buchanan translated into olibanum, but by which we suspect the oil extracted from the juice of the s\u00e1l tree was meant, is not at present expressed, probably owing to the gradual decay of that noble tree on the hills.\n\nHoney is yielded by two species of bees; partly by the regular honey-bee, but mostly by the black bhringa. The latter makes its hive in the cracks and crevices of steep cliffs, beyond the reach of all animals and the havoc of man. These cliffs are generally inaccessible from the foot. But the hill-men of the Mas\u00e1har tribe, whose trade it is to dig out roots and herbs for medicines and collect honey, approach them by a dangerous device. Rope cradles are hung on trees standing on the crest of precipices. The Mas\u00e1har covers himself with a blanket, holds a torch in his hands, and waves it to and fro along the side of the steep rock hundreds of feet above the glens. Every time that his cradle comes near to the hive, he puts in his flaming torch as best he can, and thus succeeds in killing and scaring away the honey-makers. When the bees appear to have left the hive completely his demoniac rocking ceases, his cradle stops near the mouth of the crevice, he extracts the honey and takes the hive, which is broken for wax. The unholy trade continues every fortnight from the night of the new moon in the month of November to June when the largest yield is expected, June being the best season for the collection.\n\nOf the mineral wealth of the hills the most important is Iron. There are six furnaces within the limits of the advanced outpost on the plateau, where the ore is roasted to the extent of 200 maunds per annum. The metal, such as we saw, is spotted red, and supplies the materials for all instruments of husbandry to the forest races; small quantities are also brought down to the plains where it sells at about 5 Rs. the maund. The smelting of the ore is carried on entirely by the Sahar\u00e1 clan of the Kham\u00e1r tribe.\n\nAt present the entire value of the Iron smelted per annum is estimated at 1000 Rs. only,\u2014200 maunds at 5 Rs. With capital and enterprise, we have no doubt, the mineral wealth of the hills could be greatly developed. Sulphate of Iron is extracted in different parts of the hills.\n\nAs has been observed above, calcareous stone abounds in every part of the Range. There are two hills on the eastern slope near Akbarp\u00far, which are entirely composed of limestone in different stages of formation. Some do not yet, but others melt into beautiful white lime. On the southern and eastern slopes, the quarries are close to the Son, while the S\u00e1r\u00e1, a small stream which flows straight on to the D\u00farg\u00e1vat\u00ed, has a respectable channel near the quarries of Mas\u00e1i, and affords, during the rains, a facility of\ntransport to the Railway Station at Ch\u00e1ns\u00e1; but it is little used at present.\n\nIn the days of Dr. Buchanan there was a large mine of alum and Sulphate of Iron at the Kairy\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t near Roht\u00e1s, but I do not know if it is worked now. In developing the resources of the hills, British enterprise was here, as elsewhere, the great pioneer. The mine was first worked by the energy of a gentleman whom the natives, when Dr. Buchanan visited the place about the year 1808, remembered as Mr. Phojel. But with the death of the latter, the mines fell into neglect, and no one has since been attracted to the secluded valley.\n\nThe sandstone of the hills is peculiarly hard, and admits of good polish. The quarries are abundant\u2014ashlers, paving stones, pillars, and other materials for building purposes are hewn out everywhere along the slopes. Cups, plates, mill-stones are also cut, and even the potter's wheels in these parts are made of slender slabs of sandstone. Out of the bluish block of hornstone, images of idols are modelled and sent to Ban\u00e1r\u00e1s and Gairik: red ochre is also taken to several towns. Regarding the quality of the sandstone Mr. Mallet observed that \"it is fine-grained and homogeneous, yellowish and grayish-white in colour, occurring in beds several feet thick, and perfectly free for long distances from any kind of jointing or fissures, so that very large blocks may be excavated. Some stone finds its way even as far as Calcutta, being in use by the undertakers for tomb-stones, floorings, &c. The stone of the Jumna bridge was obtained from quarries some miles up the river. The cities of Benares, Mirzapur and Allahabad, besides others of less note, draw their supplies of building stone exclusively from the Caimures.\"\n\nThe red variety is, for architectural purposes, much inferior to the white. The irregularity of its colouring greatly mars the effect, as will be remembered by any one who has visited the T\u00e1j, where the frequent juxta-position of red and partially white blocks of sandstone and the streaked and blotched appearance of others forms a most unsightly blemish to the gateway and other outer buildings of that noble and almost faultless mausoleum.\n\nThe yellowish white sandstone is a splendid material, capable of being cut into immense blocks. Many noble buildings, extending from the palace at Bharatpur to the cupolas of Roht\u00e1sgarh, attest the durability of the Vindhyan stone.\n\nThe crops and food grains grown on the tableland are those raised everywhere in Bih\u00e1r. Millet and maize are reaped in October. Wheat, barley and gram grow on the mountain top. Rice of good flavour is gathered in winter. But the cultivation of either cotton, poppy, or sugarcane is never attempted. In several places the plains immediately adjoining the\n\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. VII, page 116.\nfoot of the hills are sown with indigo, but the out-turn has not yet been encouraging; the yield, according to our calculation, hardly exceeding 13 chattaks of the blue dye per bigah.\n\nThe dairy produce of the hill-men consist mostly of gh\u00ed or clarified butter. After the early rains, as soon as the hills put on their green verdure, the entire stock of cows and buffaloes, counting more than 25,000 herds, are taken up to the plateau to graze. The charahas or cowherds, some 5,000 men, follow the cattle.\n\nExtempore villages crop up on every side. The tableland presents a busy scene, while cattle-theft commences to disturb the owners. During this season the cows are milked, and gh\u00ed to the extent of at least 10,000 maunds is prepared, which at 13 Rs. the maund represent the value at Rs. 130,000 per annum. When the milking season is over and the grass begins to dry, the stream of movement turns towards the plains and the temporary huts are abandoned.\n\nBirds.\u2014Of birds of prey the t\u012bla, the kite, and the smaller hawks breed on the hills, but the larger female zerra with which the gentlemen in these parts yet indulge in sport, like the Barons of the Middle Ages, comes from the northern countries. The larger and smaller quail, i.e. both the titir and the bater, are the only birds which are pursued by these hawks. The bageri is snared only by the fowlers. Peacocks and partridges also abound in several parts of the forest, and the bogolu or the heron is pursued for its feathers. We meet the yellow wren (Halud guri), the musical sh\u00e1m\u00e1 like the nightingale, and the munia or Amedabats in the bushes, while other birds hardly larger than the little finger delight to come down to the gardens to pick up the honey, or steal a little drink from the sides of the wells or bathing-places.\n\nOf \u201cthe favourites of the Hindu poets\u201d the cuckoo or kokila raises its rich voice occasionally, and we hear one even now, as we write these lines, to tune its sweet gamuts\u2014\n\n\"In gladsome hours of blushing spring,\nMid fragrant spring and bees on wing,\nThe cuckoo young doth pass his days.\"\n\nOf the Indian gracile, the pied starling or go-s\u00e1l\u0131k and the s\u00e1ri can be had by hundreds. But the real hill maina \u201cof fine glossy plumage with permanent yellow mantle\u201d and with varied pleasing note, which breed profusely in the hills of Orissa and Kaunjbar, is not to be found in the Kaim\u00far Range.\n\nThe parrot (tiy\u00e1) also abounds in these hills, but whether it is the Alexandrian parrot which the great conqueror took to Europe we cannot determine. It is a nice talking bird, and a story is current about one of these hill-parrots which awaked the owner of a house when a bullock was being stolen.\nThe panduka, or the dove of different sorts and hues, from the plain ash-coloured to the spotted brown, frequents almost every bush both at the foot and the top of the hills.\n\nAquatic birds are not to be found towards the northern slopes, owing to the heat and the want of watering-places, but in winter the chakrab\u00e1k, or the golden Br\u00e1hmani geese, may be seen in pairs cutting through the silent waters of the Son.\n\nThe sportsman may have his game any time in these forests. In the Mirz\u00e1pur district, we learn, peacocks and partridges abound. Black antelopes range the open country, and the white-footed deer shelter in the deep woods. Further to the east, the Nilg\u00e1i, the gour, the bear, the hyena, and the leopard infest the country; while there are glens here and there known as the homes of the royal tiger. The mongoose, porcupine, and hare also inhabit the bushes and slopes. The ring-horned deer, however, which roam by dozens, if not hundreds, in certain tracts in the Gay\u00e1 district, are missed in the woods of the Kaim\u00far Range. The family of the monkey also, which Dr. Buchanan found to be numerous, has become scarce. The lion, the rhinoceros, and the wild elephant, which the Emperor B\u00e1bar saw close to his camp at the edge of the Chan\u00e1r hills, have altogether disappeared.\n\nEthnology. The forests of the Kaim\u00far Range, hemmed in by the hills on the one side and the broad Son on the other, have in the historic period given shelter to different tribes of aborigines. The memoirs of the adjacent districts record that they receded before the wave of the Aryan migration to the shelter of the slopes and forests of the Kaim\u00far Range. Yet different tribes followed one another into these secluded summits, struggled, or blended with each other according to exigencies, until the \"iron heel\" of the R\u00e1jp\u00fat settler stamped out their political life. These tribes are the Bhars, Suriy\u00e1s, Cher\u00fas, Binds, and Kharw\u00e1rs, who, according to the current tradition, extended their dominions on both sides of the Ganges to the province of Audh. The Cheran Parganah and the Cheran Island on the Ganges in the S\u00e1ran district are still traced as the original settlement of the Cher\u00fas; and, although suffering humiliation from defeat in battle and from deception in the game of treachery, their scattered villages and the debris of their forts must still be the subject of interesting study to the antiquarian and the ethnologist.\n\nAt times these aborigines had their revenge. Whenever the neighbouring Aryan ruler proved weak, these barbarians repeated history, came down upon him, ravaged his land, and ruled his country. Sometimes the policy of conciliation resulted in social blending. Intermarriage between the daughters of the Kharw\u00e1r chief and a Chandel R\u00e1jp\u00fat prince is mentioned in the annals of Bundelkhand. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pal\u00e1mau, although claiming to be a Kshatriya, is suspected to have a mixed origin.\nOn the whole, however, the aborigines have been consigned to the lowest depths. They live on the hills as wood-cutters and herdsmen, and, when appearing in our courts, they do so as cattle-lifters only. Unintentional as it may be, their abject condition has escaped attention; unknown to the philanthropist and unthought of by the legislator, they live the life of the animals which surround them. It is high time that something should be done for these poor people, when the triumph of peace and of peaceful industry is being extended to the remotest corners of the country.\n\nWave after wave as the tide of migration touched the foot of these hills, its peaks were turned into strongholds for military defence. In the remains of the forts, on the summits of the Kaim\u00fbr Range, we see the ruins of greatness of different races. In Pamp\u00e2pur, some miles south of M\u00eerz\u00e2pur, the ruins of an extensive strong fort mark the rise of the Bhar R\u00e2j; on the northern slope Raghubirg\u00e2rh and Simalg\u00e2rh, defended by the main-range on one side and a spur which runs as a belt round them on all other sides, yet keep alive the same name. The family of Bhars, who yet own the zam\u00eend\u00e2ris round the latter forts, make every attempt to mix with, and to be known as, Purih\u00e2r R\u00e2jp\u00fbts. The R\u00e2jp\u00fbts would, however, recognise them only as the descendants of the old R\u00e2j Bhars. The Suriy\u00e2s have also some forts in and near Bhubn\u00e2, the principal one being Sir\u00e2mpur. The kot, or castle, of R\u00e2mgar, although now occupied by R\u00e2jkum\u00e2rs, is said to have been originally built by the Cher\u00fbs who held sway at Chy\u00e2pur. But the forts which the Aryan R\u00e2jp\u00fbts subsequently erected there, have become more famous. On the west, Bijaig\u00e2rh stands at the elevation of 2,017 feet, and on the east Roht\u00e2s at 1,485 feet. We have already described Fort Roht\u00e2s.* Bijaig\u00e2rh was raised by the Gharw\u00e2r R\u00e2jp\u00fbts, the descendants of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2j Jaya Chand of Kanauj, when the Muhammadan conquest drove them to the eastern country in search of new homes. It stands on a high cliff, and gives name to a parganah around it. \"The rock on which the fortress stands is so steep,\" that it appeared \"impregnable\" when Mr. E. T. Colebrooke visited it in 1798. It was, however, besieged and reduced by Col. Popham when Cheyt Singh took refuge in it, and was restored to its old chieftain, from one of whose race the R\u00e2j\u00e2s of Ban\u00e2ras had snatched it. Sherg\u00e2rh is the last of the forts which was destined to be the great citadel of the Indian Empire, had fortune favoured the ambitious scheme of its vigorous founder. It was built by Sher Kh\u00e2n close to his native place, about twelve miles from the Grand Trunk Road, south of Jah\u00e2nn\u00e2b\u00e2d, \"amidst the most magnificent scenes, and adjacent to one of the richest plains in the world.\" Its ramparts and bastions present a more imposing show to the places below than fort Roht\u00e2s, whose works from the height of the rock are not visible from the plain. The ascent to the\n\n* See Mukarji's Magazine for 1875.\nprincipal *g\u0101l\u012b* is much grander than any of the approaches to Roht\u0101s, and when seen from the north side has an appearance resembling, as observed by an European traveller, \"the Castle of Durham.\"\n\n**Antiquities.** The peak of Mungesvara, which rises to the height of 1,936 feet, has no fortress on it, but for years it was held by two Chian robbers, named Nor\u00e1 and Kor\u00e1, who infested the Son valley, and, armed with bows and arrows, committed many daring robberies and murders. Their arrest could not be effected, as after each of their crimes, they ascended the stiff cliffs of Mungesvara, and were harboured by the rude villagers on the summits. \"They were afterwards captured by the villagers, and were brought in tied on string beds*.\"\n\nThe northern slope of the range has been the seat of many R\u0101jp\u00fat chiefs, who, avoiding the open country in front, made the mountain range the back-ground of their k\u014d\u1e6ds or castles. The ramification of these R\u0101jp\u00fat chiefs extends from Chy\u00e1pur to Saw\u0101r, and the fortresses they raised, with the high ridge and forest on one side and deep trenches on the other, plainly show that they came and held the country by military force. As the foremost spot to be taken in the line of march from the North-West, Chy\u00e1pur appears to have been the field where each successive conqueror had to unsheathe his sword. In the race of ascendancy it was here that the R\u0101jp\u00fat and the Pa-th\u00e1n appear to have first met in battle, and the remains of a fort and very large tanks and scattered tombs and shooting min\u0101rs of the Afgh\u00e1n period, clearly point out that the importance of the place did not lie in tradition alone. At present, however, Chy\u00e1pur is a decayed and decaying place, and the splendid dome and min\u0101r\u2020 which \"obtrude to the sky\", and which in magnificence can be compared to the tomb of Sher Sh\u00e1h alone, threaten to tumble down at no distant time. There is one religious institution, however, which has survived the storms of ages, and which continues to keep up a permanent interest in Chy\u00e1pur. It is the shrine of Harsha Brahma. If Harsha Brahma had a tongue to speak, we could hear from him the story of centuries. But his votaries, who have sanctified him from a Br\u00e1hman to a god, assign a comparatively recent date, Sambat 1485, for his deification. He occupies a fane within the precincts of a very ancient fort whose walls have crumbled down, whose trenches have filled up, and whose ample gateway is the only high edifice of stone and brick which is still standing. But the massive stone walls of this gate are surmounted by an arch of small bricks, whose foils continued through its ceilings, and raise a suspicion that the fort must have been once taken and\n\n* Dr. Oldham.\n\n\u2020 This is the octagonal tomb of Ikhtiy\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, son-in-law of the emperor Sher Sh\u00e1h, situated on the banks of a small stream and overshadowed by a huge ridge of the hill.\nheld by a Moslem. The history of Harsha Brahma is, however, enveloped in a myth. Harsha Brahma is said to have been the high priest of R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1l\u00edb\u00e1han, a R\u00e1jp\u00fat chief of the country. Falling out with the R\u00e1j\u00e1, the Br\u00e1hman was deprived of his lands, and he waged a little war in which he invited the Emperor of Delhi to assist him. Whether the curse of the Br\u00e1hman or the valour of the Path\u00e1n was the cause, we will not undertake to determine, but the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s power was exterminated and Harsha Brahma rose triumphant. Dying soon after, he was sanctified,* and his shrine stands on a raised terrace with no other shelter but the branches of an old p\u00edpal tree, and continues to draw crowds of daily pilgrims from distant places. His name is greatly dreaded, and no oath in the country, even within the sacred limits of Ban\u00e1ras, would be more solemn than one taken by the name of Harsh B\u00e1h\u00e1.\u2020\n\nA couple of days\u2019 leisure enabled us to pay a visit to some of the noted shrines on these hills, which we shall now attempt to describe in the words of our journal which we hurriedly jotted down at the time.\n\nPast the town of Sahasr\u00e1m we came to a country which towards the west was covered with a dense forest of palm trees, whose tall trunks and elegant crests stood in bold relief on the twilight heaven\u2014silent like so many sentinels by the huge ramparts which projected from the neighbouring hills. The south and the east were blockaded by a barren belt; a solitary palm-crest on the top of the ridge standing up prominently as a flag-staff; while the view was bounded on our left by a huge pyramid, on whose top the white tomb of Chandan Sayyid caught the eye as a relic of art amidst everything that was nature\u2019s own. Our tent had been sent up the Ko\u1e6d\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, and we thought we would have early rest. But scarcely had we gone a mile when a man came down from our pioneer, to tell us not to attempt the pass. We were advised to go to Tilauth\u00fa, where, we were told, a competent guide could be had. We were thus compelled to change our program at a moment\u2019s notice. Tilauth\u00fa lay eleven miles off, and changing our cart for an elephant, on we went at a sluggish pace until we reached the pass of T\u00e1r\u00e1 Chandi. T\u00e1r\u00e1 Chand\u00ed lies at a short distance only from Sa-\n\n* This story of Harsha Brahma, taken from a poem in Hind\u00ed, called Brahma-Mukt\u00e1vali, by Isvari Datt Pandit, serves as one of many instances to refute the over-bold assertion of Buckle that \u201cthe tendency of Asiatic civilization was to widen the distance between men and their deities\u201d, and that \u201chero worship or deification of mortals could form no part of the ancient Indian Religion\u201d. Vol. I, pp. 142-146.\n\n\u2020 Chys\u00e1pur, during the Mughul period, was attached to Roht\u00e1s as one of the domains of the keeper of that Fort. Subsequently it was held as the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bhagah\u00e1npur, one of whom in a fit of desperation killed the n\u00e1sir or court officer of the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d collectorate, who was sent to serve a process on him. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri was, about the year 1790, confiscated for the offence.\nhasram, and presents the only opening to cross the chain. There is a small pool on the right side of the pass which retains water over gigantic layers of stone. On the left there is a shrine of T\u00e1r\u00e1 Chand\u00ed, an image covered all over except the face, which is plated with silver. The pass is rough, and we went up and down over a wild country until we came to a deep stream, the banks of which were covered with bushes, affording splendid shelter to game. Two miles further on from T\u00e1r\u00e1 Chand\u00ed, we came across the stone quarries which have supplied material for accomplishing that giant's work, the anicut across the Son, a dozen miles off. A light railway runs up to the foot of these hills, and although rail and labour had been at work for years and the gigantic Son has been dammed by a stone wall thirty to forty feet wide and near three miles long, how little, how very little, of the corner of the hill has suffered by continual cutting! How rich indeed is the stock of nature! From the quarries we turned to the south, and proceeded along the base of the chain, which appeared higher the more we advanced towards the south. At places where the summits rose high, we were deceived many a time by the prominent walls of stone which from their erect, slender, and rounded layers presented the appearance of some crumbling bastion or ruined fort. Forts they are indeed, and may be so to those who know how to use them, reared not by man, but by nature! From these heights towards the Son, the country is an even plain, well wooded with the bar, p\u00edpal, mahu\u00e1, and the mangoe, and cleared at places for the wheat, barley, and, thanks to European energy, the blue dye or indigo.\n\nThe road we took to Tilauth\u00fa appeared well-frequented. Traders and carts, equestrians and pedestrians, bullocks and tatas, trotted up and down towards \u00c1rah and Pal\u00e1mau, and it will surely be a good thing to improve the condition of this ancient route. Such as it is, dusty and rough, we followed it up until we found ourselves in a nice shady plain, where the neat turrets of a well-finished Math were the most pleasant object for the eye to rest upon. The turrets rose from amidst a mangoe tope on the one, and a well cared-for orchard on the other side. Four temples of the Ban\u00e1ras type reared their spires in the four corners of a square court, and one over a gateway towards the north, enclosed by straight plain walls. In the centre of the court stands a huge and higher temple with attached turrets round the main spire. Below the turret, the temple is surrounded by a square veranda projecting from the main building, and resting on elegant pillars and arches of slate. This is a peculiar type of temple structure, which is much adopted by the Jains in this district, and adds both to the strength and beauty of the buildings. The pillars are short with twelve flutes on each, and are overlapped both at base and the capital with ornamental neatly cut foliage. The ceilings are made of broad stone slabs of a length of about 12 feet each.\nWe halted at this temple for refreshment. The fare offered was poor enough, but the priest was good-natured, and, to humour us, recited a verse to the effect\u2014\n\n\"That there was no harm for the Eastern people (Bengali) to take fish.\nThere was no harm for the people of the Deccan to marry their daughters to nephews.\nThere was no harm for the Western people to drink water from leather bags.\n\n\"And there was no harm for the people of the north to eat buffalo meat.\" This authority, however, came an hour too late. To collect information as to the best way of getting up to the hill, to visit the shrine, and to get at the inscriptions of which we had heard, but which nobody could precisely tell us where to find, were matters of anxiety. An old policeman, born and employed in the neighbourhood, at last offered to show us both the shrine and the \"letters\" around it.\n\nIt was the shrine of Tuttal\u00e1 Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed. Tuttal\u00e1 Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed lay five miles off, and as soon as we could be ready, we trudged on wearily along a sandy road stretching to the south-west. Amidst everything that was wild we were delighted to observe the broad clearings in the jungle, decked with the crops of the season\u2014oats, wheat, barley, and the handsome poppy, and to contrast the bleakness of the hills with the result of human energy, which has turned the wilderness into fields of lovely green. Past this plain we found ourselves near the shrine. With the sun in front and a bed of innumerable stones scattered under our feet, we walked on wearily until the bluish haziness faded away, and we got a full view of the glen. It is a most secluded and wild spot, formed by the receding curves of two stupendous ridges, narrowing in from the north-west and south-east: their steep arms have raised a barrier which casts a gloomy shade, and makes it twilight long before the setting sun goes to his western bed. The summits of the two ridges slope down nearer 200 feet before they join. But from where they join to the foot of the glen, some 400 feet in height, the rock is one upright wall of sandstone. The edge of this wall has been washed for unknown ages by a waterfall which, during the rains, dashes down in a huge torrent. The surging of the cataract has of course dug a huge tarn below, which is deep, and retains limpid water all round the year.\n\n\"A lofty precipice in front,\nA silent tarn below.\"\n\nDuring the autumnal months when the sky is serene, the hills stand in their rich mantle of deep blue and green, and the sun shines clear over head, this water-fall appears like a blazing column investing the chain with a splendour which the eye could never be tired of gazing. We gazed upon it but once at a distance across the Son, and ever since, we had been anxious to know what the place was like. The water, which spills out into the pool\nduring the freshes, flows forth in abundance through the adjacent country. The sound and fury of the cataract keep the people in the plains sufficiently awake. The fall of a stone or boulder over night when washed down from the hill to the pool, fills the heart of the timid peasant with awe. The waters at times flood and spoil their crops, but beyond these sad effects to how little good use are they brought? With comparatively little effort on the part of man, could not the dry vale be turned into a luxuriant lake, to serve as feeder to irrigation canals? But as the case with her history, so it is with her physical resources: in India nature and man work in silence in their accustomed courses of evil, without awakening a thought or making \"the pulse beat one stroke more or less.\" The outside world is indifferent. To subjugate nature to the uses of civilised life, is a task which we have never been taught to accomplish, and while a waterfall only 150 feet in height on the opposite side of the globe has taught the Indian youth to talk with wonder of the falls of Niagara, this grand water leap of Tuttal\u00e1, nearer our homes, from at the least twice that height at the period of the rains, passes unknown, unmarked by the geologist, unnoticed alike by the engineer and the painter of natural scenes. The historian, who loves to dive into the depths of antiquity, never dreams to see what this spot is like.\n\nBut to the scene and the shrine. The shrine stands on the precipitous wall between the edge of the projecting cataract above and the gulf below. From the opposite bank of the pool the shrine appeared like a red spot on the breast of the precipice. To climb up to it was a hopeless task, we thought. But winding round the eastern bank of the pool we saw stones sufficiently broad to permit us to ascend or rather scramble up. So up we went, on all fours at times, leaving boots aside, until we found ourselves more than 125 feet above the water's edge of the pool below, and over 300 feet beneath the cataract, and face to face with the goddess Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed. The niche of the idol is a curve in the rock, sloping below and projecting about a foot and a half above. From this projection the hill rises 500 feet straight up, forming on each arm a stupendous curve of a high rocky wall, from the top of which the fleeting clouds seem hardly a stone's throw apart. It was awful to behold the projecting precipice above threatening to hurl and sweep one down to the gulf beneath. From this recess there is but one opening which displayed the country towards the north-east.\n\nThe shrine is hardly in keeping with the grandeur of the scenery around. It speaks well of the poetical temperament of the Hindu; a better site could hardly have been selected to excite religious feelings, or to hold an annual fair. The idol is small and poor. It is an image in stone of the great Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed, hardly two feet in height. The eight-handed goddess stands armed in her usual triumphant posture over a\nlion under one foot and the fallen and cleft Mahis\u00e1sura under the other. The stone out of which the image has been cut is rough sandstone. Placed as it was in a secluded spot, it did not, however, escape the ravage of the intolerant Moslem. The story of K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n, the K\u00e1l\u00e1pah\u00e1r of these hills, who broke the face and broke as many arms as he could, and threw the idol down the rock, is still told in mournful language. Great satisfaction is, however, derived from the fact that ruin has already seized the ruthless family of this faithless Path\u00e1n, and not a soul is breathing now to commemorate his name.\n\nAbove the slab of the idol, which is cut in half-relief, there is an image of N\u00e1r\u00e1yana, engraved or incised in the rock itself. On both sides of these images there are inscriptions cut in a character which differs from the Devan\u00e1gari of the present day, and their language is a corrupt Sanskrit, which is scarcely intelligible. These inscriptions bear the date 1224, Samvat, = 1171, A.D. The records are consequently 706 years old. The rock and the inscriptions have a lamp black colour, probably from the smoke of the fires which are lighted at times for homas and sacrifices. The inscriptions are, however, legible.\n\nThe first commemorates the reign of \"N\u00e1yaka Sr\u00ed Prat\u00e1pa Dhabala. The youthful, long-armed Prat\u00e1pa, protector of the people, of handsome countenance, bright as a garland of innumerable suns, the great Lokap\u00e1l (supporter of men), lovely as Cupid, owning strongholds of three and nine apartments or gates, a worthy son of the Solar Race, who acquired his kingdom on Sunday the 4th day of the waxing moon of the month of Jaishthya in the year of Samvat, 1224; who was mighty, honoured by the strong, a disciple of K\u00e1rtikeya (given to war), a source of pleasure to his chaste queens. The Prince was the son of a wreath-bedecked and learned king, who was always acknowledged even by the chief of the Devas (Indra) before his envoys.\"\n\nIt was dark before we could get copies of the inscriptions and leave the glen. Hardly had we left the range, when deep darkness overtook us. On our arrival at the temple we found our men and traps had been thrown out of the building. The obstinate priest, we were told, would not allow us to stop inside during the night. This was no satisfactory news to be told after a long day's fatiguing ramble. We went inside. Sweet words\nwe found would be vain. So we resorted to a stronger argument. The math was instituted for charitable purposes. We were guests whom the priest was by duty bound to shelter. Neglect on his part, we observed, would be a serious dereliction of duty, and he would see to his cost that another man would soon succeed, if he further continued to argue. This had the desired effect. A change came over the spirit of the priest, and he was all humility and charity again.\n\nWe rose early, or rather mistook the moonlit night for dawn, and went on looking on the silent hills and the twinkling stars until the faint dawn broke in. We felt the incense of the morning refreshing and inciting us to repeat\u2014\n\n\"Will not man awake and springing from his bed of sloth enjoy this cool,\nThis fragrant hour, to meditation due and sacred song?\"\n\nBut our meditation was rather roughly disturbed as we turned round and spied a huge black brute passing in front of us. \"Is this a boar?\" Our stout companion of a chaukid\u00e1r said, \"A bh\u00e1l only\". But before I turned again, Master Bruin was far away, and we regret we did not see more of his bearish majesty. A few minutes trotting up and down brought us back to the rough pass of T\u00e1r\u00e1 Chand\u00ed.\n\nThe sun was just up, and we enquired of a nymph dressed in ochre-coloured clothes, and who appeared to be the keeper of the shrine, if there was any writing on the rocks. She went into an adjacent cave and pointed it out to us. The cave was still dark, and we had to obtain a lamp from the priestess. The cave faces the south, and is at the extremity of the ridge which breaks in at the Pass. This is the only Pass which affords any thoroughfare to the country which lies east of the range. The country is well defended by nature. It is a cart-shaped tract, having the hills on the north and west, and the broad Son on the east. This secluded country, whose breadth varies from two to twelve miles, appears from the inscriptions to have been the principality of a R\u00e1jp\u00fat chief, who was also the lord of the strongholds on the hills, before the Moslem banner was hoisted on them. The name of this chief was Prat\u00e1p Dhaval Ail, of the order or gotra of Pars\u00e1 R\u00e1jp\u00fats. He was a great worshipper of Sakti, and, having founded the shrines of Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed in the glen of \"Tuttal\u00e1\" and of Tripur\u00e1 at the waterfall, built up a third for T\u00e1r\u00e1 Chand\u00ed at the only pass through which his dominions could be approached from Sahasr\u00e1m and the open country. The cave which adjoins the shrine, is enfaced with a masonry wall, in which there is one door. A veranda fronts this wall, and rests on a row of slender stone pillars overlooking the pass. The cave has therefore one artificial and three natural sides, although the side walls are partly made up of masonry, to make the room rectangular. In the rear wall or rock, there is a\nhuge block, apparently engaged to the rock. It is more than two yards long and a foot and a half broad. Placed under a roof and surrounded by walls, it is rendered secure from the beatings of the weather, and therefore from decay. A long inscription has been cut on this block, which is completely legible. It is dated Samvat 1226, or 1173 A.D., and was carved under the auspices of a monarch immediately before the approach of the Crescent. The inscription consists of two parts. The first has two slokas in praise of the goddess of the shrine, and runs, if we are rightly informed, in the Upendravajra metre. The second part has three couplets and a half in the Srag-dhar\u00e1 metre, and recites the praise of the \"stout and hard-hearted monarch Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Pr\u00e1t\u00e1pa Dhavala Ail, who was lord over r\u00e1j\u00e1s, owned a country and a fort, whose dominions extended 684 square miles on each side as ascertained by actual measurement by the hand. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 was a Kshatriya of the Pars\u00e1 gotra. He had the surname of Ail, and was of the same noble race as Rohit\u00e1sva, whom tradition assigns to have been the founder of Fort Ruhid\u00e1s or Roht\u00e1s, and the first Aryan settler on the Son. He reigned in the same country as far back as 35 centuries. Was Pr\u00e1t\u00e1p Dhaval Ail, of whose existence, race, and name we have a tangible proof in the shrines and inscriptions, a descendant of Rohit\u00e1sva, to whose age the researches of History have yet hardly descended? It is difficult to doubt this. \"For among the noble houses of the nations of the earth there is none that can boast of a longer pedigree, or of a more splendid history, than the R\u00e9jputs of India.\"*\n\nWe next visited the Mund\u00e9var\u00ed hill, on the summit of which there are the remains of a very ancient shrine. The hill is situated about six miles to the south-west of Bhubun. At the foot of the hill, an annual fair is held on the night of the 9th of Bais\u00e1kh, when streams of pilgrims with flaming torches wind up the slope. From a distance the Mund\u00e9var\u00ed hill looks like a blue-pointed pyramid with the slight outline of a spreading tree on the summit. The tree grows on the ruined tower of a temple, the sides of which only are now standing. The approach to the temple lies through the eastern face of the mount. The ascent is easy; stage by stage as you ascend, the hill is observed to consist of three or four successive spires. Between the foot of each spire and the one immediately under it, there are even plains, which were once the sites of masonry buildings. The ruins of these are spread along the eastern slope with some huge images of gods. The chief of these is a big image of Ganes\u00e1, richly ornamented. There is another image lying flat on the rock. The head is broken and is missing, but it has a coat with\n\n* According to Mr. Sherring, (p. 143) Roht\u00e1s on the Son was founded by the Kachhw\u00e1ha or Kushhw\u00e1ha tribe of R\u00e9jputs, who trace their origin to R\u00e9ma through his son Kuah. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Nala, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Si\u0144ha, and the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaypur, are the present illustrious descendants of this race.\nskirts hanging down to within two inches of the knee, a pair of boots or buskins, a girdle, and a sword-belt hanging towards the left.\n\nThe chief interest of the place is, however, centered in the temple on the highest point of the hill. The spire of the temple has fallen, and its sides are partly buried in debris. But its cornice is visible, and it is supported on a frieze, consisting of a nice range of tiger-heads. The fierce eyes of these faces rather ill-assort with the moustaches twisted up to a point over stretched and slender lips which give them altogether a grotesque appearance. The front paws are also visible, contracted to the point of a start.\n\nAll the doors of the temple, except the northern one, have been blocked up by the debris of the fallen porch. The square at this door is nicely carved, and entering through it we come to the shrine. The shrine is an octagonal spire, supported in the middle by four pillars with the same number of sides. The roof above consists of big stone slabs. Within the four pillars there is a standing block representing the phallus or Siva, but it has the peculiarity of having four faces carved on its four sides, looking towards the four doors of the temple. The temple itself appears square outside, but the walls have been thickened to an octagon inside. The eastern recess of this thick wall is occupied by a handsome equestrian statue of the goddess Mundalesvari. She rides triumphant on a buffalo, in the attitude of a man, and holds fast with her left hand one of its horns, to restrain the brute. Her ornaments are rich\u2014richer is her hair, which is turned up in the shape of a nice chignon. Altogether the sculptor has succeeded in imparting to her face a vigour which is not usually observed in figures in old Hindu temples. Indeed, the great peculiarity of the images on the Munde\u015bvar\u012b hill is the elongated oval cut of the face, which contrasts with the square flats of the Orissan artists.\n\nThere are different slabs on the slopes in which inscriptions may be found. The letters are peculiar, neither resembling the Devan\u0101gar\u012b, nor the P\u0101li. But the most remarkable among them is to be found on a tongue of the hill, appropriately known to the natives as the Jibh Devi. Westward from the summit, the descent to this tongue lies over precipitous boulders; the crevices having thorny plants and poor grass. Going down the hill we came to this projecting rock, the so-called Jibh Devi, about 16 feet broad, protruding like a tongue about 30 feet from the hill. There is a broad crack at the point of projection over which one has to leap. It overhangs a wild country, bounded on all sides with wilder hills, and overlooking the plains some 300 to 350 feet deep. Over this narrow slice there are devices of plants and leaves. Inscriptions run across these plants, and they may well deserve the patience of the antiquarian. The letters are, however, so few and detached, that the information\nthey are likely to give, may ultimately turn out to be of little use. There is no doubt, however, that the pointed letters, some of which resemble the V and E of the English alphabet, must belong to a very ancient age, and it would be interesting to trace the people who engraved them. The letters are big and deeply cut.\n\nTradition attributes the rocks on the Mund\u00e9vari hill to a Daitya, by the name of Munda. He was the brother of Chanda, the chief who founded Chy\u00e1pur. They belonged to a race of Pre-Aryans, who must have latterly blended their own worship of the phallus with that of the Sakti. The remains of their forts and stone buildings incontestably point out that the Daityas, who at times established sovereign sway over the Aryans, were not mere savages. Hated and dreaded as their names may appear, they were certainly powerful princes who represented a more advanced state of civilization than history has yet been ready to assign them. The history of these primitive races, detested by the names of D\u00e1kas, Daityas, Dasyus, the raw-eaters and the \"Black race\", remains yet to be written, and in the relics of their ruined forts, temples, pillars, scattered along the plains and hills of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d and the valleys along the Ganges, some material may be gathered to show that they were not entirely men of that degraded condition in which their antagonists have invariably depicted them. Mr. Thomason's remarks regarding the Bhar tribe equally apply to the other aborigines of the district: \"They were a powerful and industrious people, as is evident by the large works they have left behind them.\"\n\nNote on the old Manipuri Character.\u2014By G. H. DAMANT, C. S., Officiating Political Agent, Manipur.\n\n(With two plates.)\n\nThere can be but little doubt that this alphabet is a form of the Devan\u00e1gari, and it was in all probability introduced from Bengal along with Hinduism by some wandering sany\u00e1s\u00ed in the reign of Charairongba, who flourished about 1700 A.D.; at least there is no evidence to show that a knowledge of writing existed among the Manipuris at any earlier date. The earliest MS. I can find, purports to have been composed in the reign of Charairongba, and there are no mural inscriptions of old date in the country. The alphabet is singularly ill-adapted to the Manipuri language, and in point of fact, we find in the MSS. that the letters g, gh, chh, j, jh, all the gutturals, n, d, dh, b, bh, c, and sh are seldom, if ever, used except in words of Bengali origin, k, t, p, and ch being used for g, d, b, and j respectively, while\nw, a letter which distinctly exists in the Manipuri language, is unrepresented in the alphabet. Compound letters are seldom used or required.\n\nThe most important MS. is called the \"T\u00e1khelgnamba\", and contains an account of the wars between Pamhaiba, alias Garib-Namaz, [Gharib-naw\u00e1z] king of Manipur and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tiparah. The copy in my possession contains 45 leaves written on both sides.\n\nThe next in importance is the \"Samsokgnamba\", which is a history of the war between Charairongba and his son Pamhaiba of Manipur and the kings of Burma and Sumjok. It contains 36 leaves.\n\nThe \"L\u00e1nglol,\" a short MS. of ten leaves only, is a treatise on morals, intermixed with proverbs and maxims, and would probably be interesting as throwing light on the customs of the Manipuris before their conversion to Hinduism. The only other MSS. of which I have been able to obtain information, are the \"Meiy\u00e1nggnamba\", an account of the wars between Manipur and Kach\u00e1r, and the \"Salkau\", a treatise on cattle and the respect to be shown them. Of these two latter I have not been able to obtain copies. The above seem to comprise the whole literature of Manipur; but it is just possible that further search may reveal one or two other works. The MSS. are all written on a coarse, but very durable, kind of paper, with pens made of bamboo; paper blackened with charcoal on which they write with a soapstone pencil is also used. The character has now been almost entirely superseded by Bengali, and indeed but few of the Manipuris can read it. A national chronicle is, however, still kept in the old character by the guild of priests, 'maibees' as they are called, in which every event of importance occurring in the country is regularly recorded.\n\nThe language of the MSS. is most difficult, being quite unintelligible to an ordinary Manipuri, while those who can understand it are very few in number. It is, however, interesting as being the oldest form we possess of the Manipuri and cognate dialects. In a practically unwritten language like this, for the very few writings which exist could never have affected the mass of the people, considerable variations in dialect must inevitably take place in the course of a very few years; but in the present instance the difference between the written and spoken language is so great, that it can hardly be accounted for in this way. Tradition has it, and it seems most probable, that the Manipuris are a conglomeration of several distinct tribes, and it may well be that these MSS. are written in the dialect of one of them, whichever may have been predominant at the time; but this is a question which can only be satisfactorily settled after careful enquiry.\n\nI subjoin a copy of the complete Manipuri alphabet, and a facsimile with transliteration and translation of the first page of the \"Samsokgnamba.\" The translation is little more than tentative, as the meaning of many phrases is obscure and doubtful, the Manipuris themselves differing very much as to their meaning.\nTranslation.\n\nHail O King, hail lord of heaven, hail snake* king, slayer of kings, O mighty king, snake king at whose voice the people flee, who has performed the works of a king, who has conquered ten camps of Burmese, with body and soul I will sing of Selbi,\u2020 Samsok\u2021 and the villages conquered last month. Hail to his\u00a7 father, king Charairongba, who changed the names of the gods, who warred in Selbi and Tekhau,|| who subdued in war the Lolloitha,\u00b6 who ascended the throne in the sight of all the people, who was related to the Burmese** and brought the Poerai\u2020\u2020 into connection with them. I will tell how his daughter Chakpa Makhau Gnambi the lady\u2021\u2021 of royal family was given in marriage.

A. Grierson, C. S., Bangpur.\n\nI was much interested by an article by Prann\u0101th Pandit in the last number of the Journal of the Asiatic Society on the \"morals of K\u0101lid\u0101sa.\"\n\nWith reference to one head of his subject, \"Polygamy,\" I venture to differ from him. He says (page 357), \"It is noteworthy that it (polygamy) is never prominently brought forward in the poems, except in the case of the wives of Da\u015ba-ratha.\" And again, further on, \"The greatest of our poet's heroes are either monogamists, or may be taken to be so for all the purposes of his epic narrative.\"\n\nHas he not with regard to the poems forgotten Dil\u012bpa, one of the very noblest characters in the Raghuvans\u00e1, who is especially declared to have had a numerous (I. 82) ant\u0101k-pura-varga or zen\u0101na. Moreover, though it is then said that he considered these wives of no value in comparison to \u015audakshin\u0101, Dil\u012bpa is at the same time distinctly said to have considered not only her, but also Lak\u1e63hm\u012b as his wife, and hence to have been at least a professed bigamist. Of course it may be urged that calling Lak\u1e63hm\u012b his wife was a mere figure of speech, but still the fact shows that according to K\u0101lid\u0101sa, his model Dil\u012bpa did not consider polygamy an objectionable practice.\n\nAgain Agni-var\u1e47a in the nineteenth book, who, though not a reputable character, was undoubtedly one of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's heroes, can hardly be called a monogamist.\n\nWith regard to K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play-heroes, one, at least, viz., Pur\u016bravas, cannot be taken as a monogamist, \"for all purposes of the epic narrative,\" or of the dramatic narrative either.\n\nIn the second Act of Vikram\u0101v\u0101si, Nipu\u1e47ik\u0101 makes him out offending his Queen by imagining her to be Urva\u015bi, and calling her by her (Urva\u015bi's) name \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0903 \u0915\u093f\u0902\u091a \u091a\u093e\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0903\u0964 This surely is hardly the act of a strict monogamist, especially as subsequently Pur\u016bravas marries Urva\u015bi in the lifetime of his Queen.\n\nThe only other Dramatic Hero of K\u0101lid\u0101sa with whom I am acquainted,\u2014Dushyanta, though undoubtedly possessed of an \"affinity\" for Sakuntal\u0101, as every right-minded hero should have for the heroine, used to appear surrounded by Yavan women, with bows in their hands and wearing garlands of flowers.* I know that the commentators say that these women were simply arm-bearers, but on this occasion there was no reason\n\n* \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0915\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0928\u0940\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0939\u0924\u0903, near the commencement of the 2nd Act of the Sakuntal\u0101.\nfor their bearing arms, and even if there was, such a profession does not explain their carrying garlands at the same time.\n\nAs this passage is, however, liable to discussion. I now quote another in the same act (the second), which occurs just before the 43rd verse (M. W.'s Edition). The Vidushaka says to the king, speaking of his longing for Sakuntal\u00e1, \"Just as a man who is sated with dates may desire the tamarind, so your highness, slighting the jewels of women in your Zen\u00e1na, has fixed his desires upon Sakuntal\u00e1.\"*\n\nThere is one more play by a K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa, which is by some ascribed to the author of the Sakuntal\u00e1\u2014the M\u00e1lavik\u00e1gnimitra. The hero in this piece is certainly not a monogamist, in fact Agnimitra is represented as being \"very much married\" indeed. He has a first Queen Dh\u00e1rin\u00ed, and then a second Queen Ir\u00e1vati, who is the chief villain of the piece. Not only are these both prominent characters, but the king, not satisfied with only two, finishes the play by marrying M\u00e1lavik\u00e1, which is the conclusion to which the whole course of events of the piece has been tending.\n\nIt thus appears that it can hardly be considered an accurate statement of facts that \"the greatest of\" K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa's \"heroes are either monogamists or may be taken to be so for all purposes of his epic narrative.\" Dil\u00edpa was a polygamist, about Raghu we know nothing, and the only great heroes of Raghu's line, who bear out the above remarks, so far as we can tell, were Aja and R\u00e1ma.\n\nEvery one of the dramatic heroes is a polygamist, and the subject of marriage, so far as it relates to one or to a plurality of wives, is not mentioned either in the Ritu-Sanh\u00e1ra, the Megha-d\u00fata, or the Kum\u00e1ra-Sambhava.\n\n* \u0924\u0925\u093e\u0903\u092a\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u091c\u0940\u0935\u093f\u092a\u0930\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f\u0915\u093e \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u0930\u091a\u0928\u093e\u092f\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0923\u093e\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOn the Route between Soh\u00e1r and el-Bereym\u00ed in 'Om\u00e1n, with a note on the Zaff, or gipsies in Arabia.\u2014By Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles.\n\n(With a map.)\n\nHaving arrived at Soh\u00e1r (\u0633\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0631) on the 18th November, 1875, and visited the Governor Seyyid Bedr-bin-Seif Al B\u00e1-Sa'\u00edd\u00ed, I requested him to be good enough to arrange for my visit to el-Bereym\u00ed, and Sheikh R\u00e1shid-bin-Hamd, with whom I was personally acquainted, and who is a man of considerable influence in el-Dh\u00e1hireh (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629), having been at one time Governor of el-Bereym\u00ed, was selected to accompany me. I could, however, only promise myself a hasty visit, as my arrangement with Captain Clayton, Her Majesty's Ship Riflemen, who had kindly given me a passage, was to meet again at Soh\u00e1r on the 22nd. The Sheikh's preparations as regards camels, &c., were not completed until the next morning at 10 A. M., when we started with nine matchlocks of the Na'im and Mok\u00e1bil tribes, and reached about thirty miles by nightfall, encamping for the night at Sah\u00edlah, (\u0633\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0631) a village in the W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze (\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u064a \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0651\u0629) belonging to the el-Kun\u00fad. The road, after leaving the belt of palm groves and cultivation outside Soh\u00e1r, ran N. W. for an hour to 'Auh\u00ed, (\u0639\u064f\u0647\u0652) a little patch of date groves and gardens irrigated by a felej, and then turned west over a stony, gradually rising plain, covered with thin acacia jungle and underwood towards the hills. The W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze, which we came to soon after, is here neither broad nor deep, being but a few inches lower than the plain, and barely distinguishable from it, showing that no great torrent ever rushes down it, but that after rainfall, which in 'Om\u00e1n is rarely heavy, the water that is not absorbed by cultivation is sucked in by the porous soil on the way. Another hour brings us to the site of an ancient ruined town, attested by heaps of fragments of black rock lying in squares and ovals, which mark the foundations of houses, and by parts of ruined walls and towers on adjoining hillocks, covering altogether a considerable extent of ground. From the appearance of the foundations, the houses must have been on a small scale and of rude construction. No vestige of any edifice of architectural pretensions remains. At the present day the locality is uninhabited, and a place of more dreary and complete desolation I have rarely seen. My companions could not tell me the name of the site, their only traditional knowledge was that it belonged to the Persians in the time of ignorance, and that it was destroyed by God on account of the refusal of the inhabitants to embrace the blessed truths of Isl\u00e1m.\n\nA little further is a dried up felej leading from the hills, called Felej-el-S\u00fak, (\u0641\u064e\u0644\u0652\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0651), and also ascribed to the Persians. At 2\u00bd P. M., we\ncame in sight of Sehl\u00e1t (\u0633\u0647\u0644\u0627), a village picturesquely situated on the top of a hill, and having at a distance a somewhat imposing appearance, though a closer view dispelled the illusion. It belongs to the Ben\u00ed Gheith (\u0628\u0646\u064a \u063a\u064a\u062b), a petty Hinaw\u00ed tribe, subordinate however to the Na'im. Here we rested for a short time while the camels were fed. The next village we come to an hour later is Mileyyeneh, (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0647) and our road henceforth lies in the bed of W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze as far as Hail, (\u062d\u064a\u0644) for we have now reached the foot of the hill range and commence a more steep and winding ascent. Just below Mileyyeneh, where the W\u00e1d\u00ed narrows considerably, is an arched aqueduct, of solid masonry that supplies a village, called el-Ghor\u00e1k (\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0642), belonging to the Ben\u00ed Gheith. I could learn nothing precise about this aqueduct, which is evidently of very ancient construction, from the Sheikh, the tradition as usual being limited to the fact of its having been constructed by the K\u00e1firs before Isl\u00e1m. Here we were overtaken by a heavy thunder-storm, which soon drenched us through and made the rocky path too slippery for the camels to venture out of a walk; the sight, however, was very grand from the picturesque scenery around us; the dark blue hills of the back ground, streaked by deepest black ravines and gorges, and with ridge upon ridge of lower hills in front being lighted up here and there by the rays of the sun, now near setting, glancing through a rent in the dark heavy masses of clouds above us and showing a strange contrast of light and shade. It was some time after dark when we reached the groves of the little village of Sahileh, (\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0644\u0647) and here the Arabs having lost the path and nearly brought us to grief among the water channels and low walls of the plantations, we were fain to wait for a villager to light us with a torch to our camping ground. This place belongs to the el-Kun\u00fad, and has two small towers for defence. The next day, starting soon after sunrise, we pushed on more rapidly and reached el-Bereym\u00ed at 7\u00bd p.m.\n\nTravelling at first in a south-westerly direction, we pass after an hour an affluent on the right bank, called W\u00e1d\u00ed el-S\u00faf\u00e1n, (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0646) up which is a village of the same name, and then the W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze, here forming a loop, we cross the 'Akabat Kum\u00e1sh\u00ed (\u0639\u0643\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u0645\u0627\u0634\u064a) to join it again. A few miles further S.S.W. brings us to Burj el-Shikeyr\u00ed, (\u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0643\u064a\u0631\u064a) just beyond which lies the village of K\u00e1n, (\u0643\u0627\u0646) memorable for a conflict between the Wahh\u00e1b\u00eds and the Hadhram\u00ed troops of Seyyid Sa'id-bin-Sult\u00e1n some sixty years ago, in which the latter were signally defeated with great loss, and which paved the way for the onward progress of these fanatics to Shin\u00e1s (\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633), where they again destroyed His Highness' forces. A cemetery of the slain in the bed of the W\u00e1d\u00ed near K\u00e1n attests the severity of the contest there. The tower of Shikeyr\u00ed is on a peak some 200 feet high on the right bank, and is joined to another tower below by a stone wall. It was built for the special purpose of barring the progress of the\nWahhab\u00eds. After another hour and a half we pass W\u00e1d\u00ed W\u00e1sit, up which lies a town of that name. Sheikh R\u00e1shid was very anxious I should visit this place, as the Sheikh Suleim\u00e1n-bin-Sa\u2019\u00edd el-Sh\u00e1m\u00ed was a great friend of his and a man of some importance. It lay, however, too much out of the road, and time was of consequence. The next place we reached was el-Khoweyrej, (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u06cc\u06cc\u0631\u062c) a village of the same clan as W\u00e1sit, the Show\u00e1m\u00eds, (\u0634\u0648\u0645\u06cc\u0633) a sub-division of the Na\u2019\u00edm, and having the protection of a fortlet and two towers. The cultivation here was extensive and very refreshing to the eye in contrast to the drear and arid rocks around. The fields were neatly arranged in terraces on the right bank, advantage being taken ingeniously of every available spot of ground capable of production. They were well kept and evidently received much attention, irrigation being carried on by means of channels leading from the copious stream above. Contiguous to this is \u1e24ail, another large village, the two forming the most considerable settlement I met with between Bereym\u00ed and Soh\u00e1r. \u1e24ail has several towers, and on the opposite bank is el-R\u00e1b\u00ed, (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a) a pinnacle rock about 200 feet high, on which is perched a tower surrounded by a low wall now crumbling away. The work is ascribed to the Persians, and the position is well chosen for the purpose for which it is said to have been constructed, namely, to serve as an outpost to protect the maritime plain from the inroads of the Bedouins. This outpost not improbably marks the limit of the grasp of the Persians in the age immediately preceding the introduction of Isl\u00e1m, when they are related to have held the sea-coast of \u2019Om\u00e1n, the Arabs maintaining themselves in the highlands and interior. Two petty clans of the Na\u2019\u00edm, the Rash\u00edd\u00e1t and Had\u00edd\u00e1t occupy \u1e24ail, and are at enmity with their neighbours the Show\u00e1m\u00eds of Khoweyrej and W\u00e1sit. As may readily be imagined, quarrels among such very close neighbours are very bitter, and they are said to ripen every four or five years into a free fight, which is not terminated without bloodshed. In such cases the people of \u1e24ail have the advantage of being able to cut off the water-supply of those below by damming up the stream, which is a very effective punishment, and is generally instrumental in bringing hostilities to a speedy termination. At \u1e24ail the W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze is joined by its confluent, W\u00e1d\u00ed el-\u2019Abyleh, (\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0644\u0629) up which the road now leads. The course of W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze above the junction is short, and lies W. S. W. towards K\u00e1bil and Seneyneh (\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u0646\u0647). A few miles up it is a steep pass, marking, as my Sheikh informed me, the boundary of el-Dh\u00e1hireh. We rested a little while at \u1e24ail, and then continued our route, soon reaching more open and level ground with woody ravines and scattered herbage. The highest point of this pass is called el-Nejd, where the aneroids showed an elevation of 1,860 feet, the peaks of the range on each side rising above us 1,000 feet or more. On descending the other side, we reached after an hour the W\u00e1d\u00ed \u2019Ain, which runs like all other water-\ncourses on the southern side of the range in a south-westerly direction until its waters are absorbed by the thirsty desert. We now continue W. N. W. over an unbroken plain sparsely studded with acacias direct on to Bereym\u00ed. On our right lies el-Mahdhab, (\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0628) the habitation of the Ben\u00ed Ka'b tribe, while to the S.W. the lofty isolated range of Jebel Hafit, (\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0644 \u062d\u064e\u0641\u0650\u064a\u062a) looming some 20 miles away, alone breaks the level expanse before us, and we stand on the border of that inhospitable sea of sand and waste that stretches without break or interruption for nearly 800 miles across the peninsula, and forms the greatest sand desert of Asia. The Bedouins of our party having remained behind at a watering place we had passed, we found we had been jogging on for some miles without them, and the Sheikh professed some apprehension lest we should encounter any of the 'Aw\u00e1m\u00edr Bedouins, who, he said, were constantly prowling about. It is customary in 'Om\u00e1n, when moving from one part to another, to take a man or two as Khafir, or protector, from each of the more important tribes through whose country one has to pass. This applies not only to strangers, but also to any Arab passing through the territory of another tribe with whom his own are not in \"saff\" or league, when it is of course unnecessary. Sheikh R\u00e1shid had not been able to procure an '\u00c1mir\u00ed at Soh\u00e1r before starting, and hence his anxiety.\n\nWe had another thunder-storm this evening, but not much rain. On arrival at Bereym\u00ed, I went to the house of Sel\u00edm-bin-Mohammed, whose father, the Chief Sheikh of the Na'im tribe, resides at Dhank (\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0643). Our arrival was the signal for a general assembly of visitors, whom I soon tired of, and I therefore beat a retreat to another house outside, which was cleared for my reception.\n\nEarly the next morning, I set out to visit the fort, which at present is in the hands of Sheikh \u1e24amd. I saw his house on the way, and as he was laid up with a dislocated shoulder from a fall off a camel, he sent to invite me in to take coffee. The house consists of two lofty rooms separated by an arch and with no furniture, but a carpet or two and an array of coffee pots; two or three damsels bundled out as I entered, but the fowls and goats that seemed to make up the complement of inmates, being less bashful, remained. The walls of the courtyard are loop-holed for musketry, and a rusty iron gun lies half-buried in the ground inside. It took some little time to get coffee ready for the assembly that had crowded into the house and filled both sides of the room, but when it was over, I took leave and continued my way to the fort. On reaching the gate, I received a salute of three guns, which put the ordnance hors de combat by dismounting them from their rickety carriages, and thus prevented any further expenditure of powder. I was then taken over the fort, and the objects of interest generally were pointed out to me with great readiness and evident pleasure by the Sheikh's nephew and his people. I was gratified by their civility, and\nspent some time in looking over the place, the strength and importance of which in their eyes are by no means undervalued. The plain in which el-Bereym\u00ed stands being so level, the view from the upper towers is extensive and interesting, embracing as it does the whole of el-Jow, and enabling one to get a tolerably clear notion at a glance of the topography of the settlement. To the S. W., at a little distance off, lies Sedeyri\u2019s house, erected many years ago by that Wahh\u00e1b\u00ed Chief for his own residence. It was solidly built of stone, but was destroyed by Seyyid \u2019Az\u00e1n in 1870, who disapproved of seeing so strong a fortified house so near the fort, and who required the stones of which it was built to repair and strengthen the latter. After leaving the fort, I spent some time in walking through the section of the settlement more particularly known as el-Bereym\u00ed. The dates had nearly all been gathered, and the fields were being just freshly sown for the spring harvest, except a few late fields of jow\u00e1ri, and the fruit season was over, so I did not see the place to full advantage, but the fields were neat and regular, and the orchards well cared for. Indeed, great attention is paid to horticulture throughout \u2019Om\u00e1n, and at all the centres of population the \u2018Bost\u00e1ns\u2019 are the great objects of interest. The houses in these settlements are seldom grouped together, but are scattered among the date groves; they are principally of mat and date leaf construction, and form perhaps the least obtrusive part of the landscape. A good proportion of the few mud houses was dilapidated and untenanted, and gave a general air of unsubstantiality to the place. The verdant appearance of this oasis, however, in which the tall and handsome foliage of the date is the predominant feature, is most attractive and refreshing to the eye of the traveller, and soon makes him oblivious of the drear and arid waste he has traversed to reach it, while the luxuriant vegetation, the sight and sound of running water, the almost entire absence of unproductive trees and plants, convey an impression of prosperity which is by no means borne out in reality.\n\nDuring the day several of the Sheikhs came to visit me at Sa\u2019reh, (\u0633\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0647) and as they were communicative, I was glad of the conversation. Among those who came was Sheikh \u2019Ali-bin-Seif of the Beni Ka\u2019b, who lives at el-Mahdhah; he was loquacious and lively, and was very solicitous I should visit his tribe and settlement, but it was unfortunately not convenient to do so, and I was compelled to accept his invitation for another time. He told me he had been to el-Ri\u00e1dh, having been taken captive by the Wahh\u00e1b\u00eds in his youth and carried thither in irons. He believed they were 24 days on the road from el-Bereym\u00ed to el-Hass\u00e1, as they travelled slowly, and there was plenty of water on the way. Not having had time to visit any of the Beni Y\u00e1s settlements in the morning, a messenger arrived from them inviting me to do so, but I was obliged to decline, as it was already time for me to be taking my departure. At the suggestion of Sheikh R\u00e1shid, I re-\nquested Sheikh Selim to furnish us with an escort to the limits of el-Jow, but as he proposed to accompany me himself the first stage, I accepted his company with pleasure. It was not without strong remonstrances and pressing invitations to stay a day or two longer that we were permitted to make a start, but we succeeded in doing so about 3 p.m., and in presence of an admiring crowd of boys and Bedouins, we left el-Bereym\u00ed at a brisk trot by the same road that we had come; the Bedoos shouting and singing and racing their camels at full speed in high spirits and evident delight at being on the road again, and already oblivious of the fact that half an hour before they had been sulky and disgusted at being told to collect the camels for the journey. After some miles a peak to our left, named Ka\u1e6dar, (\u0643\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631) was pointed out to me as having on the top the remains of a Persian settlement with trees, dwellings, &c., and said to have been occupied by them after their repulse at el-Bereym\u00ed. We passed Kha\u1e6dmet el-Shikla, (\u062e\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0634\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0627) a small village at 12 miles, and soon after observing a low reddish coloured hill some distance off very conspicuous among the other dark rocks, I told a man to bring me a specimen. Nearly the whole party started off, and returned with sufficient stones to fill a portmanteau. It was a red compact nummulitic limestone, and was the only block of the kind I noticed on the journey. It was just dark when we reached el-Khur\u00fas, (\u0627\u0644\u0652\u062e\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0633\u064f) a deep cleft in the rocky bed of the W\u00e1di 'Ain, which holds a perennial supply of rain water. The Arabs were anxious to push on to \u1e24ail, another 15 miles or so in the dark, but I objected; wood and water were sufficiently abundant, and we soon had a good fire under way and suppers cooking. I noticed the men obtained fire from a spark by rolling the tinder into a ball with dry Arabs grass and swinging it round until it burst into flame. The dew to-night was very heavy, and my blanket was drenched by morning. The elevation of el-Khur\u00fas is 1,630.\n\n20th.\u2014Before starting I took leave of Sheikh Selim-bin-Mohammed, whose protection was no longer required, giving him a suitable present, and I may mention as an instance of the entire want of shamefacedness in the Arab in begging, that he came up to me quietly, after he had received his douceur from my factotum, to whisper a request for two dollars more. I insinuated he had already received what I thought was proper for him, on which he said, \"Well, give me one, only one more dollar, and I will be satisfied.\" This man's father is Chief of one of the largest tribes in 'Om\u00e1n, and he himself a man of much influence and consideration. We reached the Nejd two hours after leaving el-Khur\u00fas. The ground here, which for some extent is comparatively level, is well wooded with acacias, rhamnus, &c., and green with low brushwood and grass. It is visited in the season by the Na'im and Ka'b Arabs for pasturing their camels and goats. The mountain range we were crossing is, except in the valleys and water-courses,\nwhere the detritus from the hills forms a little soil, remarkably arid and sterile, and is everywhere from Jebel Akhdhar to Ru\u00fas el-Jeb\u00e1l entirely unclothed with verdure, presenting one of the bleakest ranges it is possible to imagine. The large valleys contain a good deal of herbaceous, but very little ligneous vegetation. Among the trees and plants in the W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze and in the plain beyond the range were noticed the rhamnus, screwpine, somar or acacia vera, acacia Arabia, two oleanders, calotropis G., castor-oil, and colocynth gourd, two or three euphorbias, the wild lavender, a rush much used for making mats called rasad; the maranneh, (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0647) the narcotic plant noticed by Palgrave; the rose-scented shirkeh, and much coarse grass in tufts.\n\nAt Hail, which we reached in three hours from el-Khur\u00fas, and which is perhaps 35 or 40 miles from Bereym\u00ed, we halted for a short time for breakfast and to feed the camels, which were beginning to show symptoms of fatigue, for since the commencement of the journey we had been keeping up a jog-trot of from five to seven miles an hour, whenever the road rendered it at all practicable. Our dromedaries were all pretty good, and were as sleek and well-shaped in appearance as they were swift and easy in going. 'Om\u00e1n camels are acknowledged the best in the world. The Sherif of Mecca rides none other, and last year he received a present of six from Seyyid Turki, which were sent by sea to Jedda. They fetch from $100 to 150, if very superior, but the ordinary ones run from $80 upwards. Depth of chest is considered one of their chief points. The Bedouins of 'Om\u00e1n sometimes take their camels from el-Bereym\u00ed across Arabia to Nejd and el-Hej\u00e1z for sale. In 'Om\u00e1n, Arabs ride behind the hump, the saddle being very small with a felt and sheepskin over it. The camel's nose is not pierced, but a headstall with a chain nose-band and a thick camel hair rope forms the bridle. In Yemen, they sit in front of the hump, resting the feet on the neck of the animal, the saddle having a high pommel to give support. On leaving Hail, we entered the political boundary of Soh\u00e1r, and proceeded down the W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze by the side of running water, flowing at intervals as far as Mileyyeneh; owing to the alternate porosity and rockiness of the bed, the stream rushes along at one place for some distance, then suddenly disappears to re-appear again as suddenly further on. K\u00e1n and Shikeyrf, Sahilah and Mileyyeneh, are successively passed and left behind, until at nightfall we reached our halting place not far from Sehl\u00e1t, where the road branched off to Jebel Ghar\u00e1beh, a spot I was anxious to visit. During our march to-day we had been joined by two Sheikhs of the Na'im tribe, who were taking two horses for sale to Soh\u00e1r. One of these, a chestnut mare, was a very casty, well-formed, and pretty animal, and from the price put on her the Sheikhs seemed to have a very exalted idea of her value. We passed on the road several small parties of donkeys and camels laden with\ndried and salt-fish going up to el-Bereym\u00ed, where the consumption of these articles is very considerable. The elevation of this place was found to be 850. The road we have been travelling lies almost entirely along the smooth sandy bed of the W\u00e1d\u00ed or torrents, and presents no difficulties of any kind to communication. For the first 30 miles or so from Soh\u00e1r the road winds up W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze, and for 10 miles more its confluent W\u00e1d\u00ed 'Ab\u00edleh. We then cross the ridge of the chain, here very low and not exceeding 1,900 feet, while the peaks on each side reach about 3,000. On descending the other side, we find ourselves on the plain of el-Jow, which borders on the great desert. Though heavy in places, the road is quite practicable for guns, and I remember no place that would be likely to cause artillery more than an hour's detention. The mountain range that has been crossed is part of the chain leading from R\u00e1s Mosandim (\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0645) to Jebel Akhdhar, and divides the provinces of el-Dh\u00e1hireh and el-B\u00e1tineh. The hilly district between these two provinces is styled el-Hajar (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0631) by the Arabs, but there is no general name for the range that connects Jebel Akhdhar with Ru\u00fas el-Jeb\u00e1l. The water-sheds towards Ru\u00fas el-Jeb\u00e1l lie east and west, while lower down towards Jebel Akhdhar, they lie N. E. and S. W. Running water was met with by me only in W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze from Hail to Sehl\u00e9t, and then never more than a few inches deep, but there is no scarcity of water anywhere. The inhabited spots are irrigated both by canals drawn from the stream, and by wells. The rocks met with were mostly sedimentary, the principal being a very dark limestone and an argillaceous slate, the latter lying in great angles. The bed of W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze is cut through a breccia containing fragments of granite, green limestone, quartz, and a beautifully variegated sandstone, and the breccia or conglomerate is penetrated in some places by masses of slate or shale. The range is very peaked and sharp ridged, and here and there the strata were in waves, appearing as if the rock had been at some period subjected to pressure. Throughout the whole route, the aspect of the country is extremely barren and sterile, and, as might be expected, is unable to sustain much animal life. The only wild animals, I noticed, were a few ravine deer and foxes, and birds were everywhere extremely rare. On starting the following morning, we proceeded down the bank of W\u00e1d\u00ed el-'Aweyneh (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647) of the el-Mok\u00e1bil, who occupy chiefly the upper part, where it is well wooded, and where running water is abundant. In an hour and a half we reached Jebel Ghar\u00e1b\u00e9h, (\u062c\u0628\u0644 \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0647) where, as I had already learnt from Sheikh R\u00e1shid, who had been regaling me throughout the journey with the traditional lore of 'Om\u00e1n, were situated the ruins of the citadel of 'Om\u00e1n, the pristine name of Soh\u00e1r, at one time the capital of the whole country. I determined here to take the opportunity of exploring these interesting and ancient ruins, which are probably not paralleled in 'Om\u00e1n, and accordingly made a short halt for the\npurpose. The hill is not high, perhaps 250 or 300 feet, but it is very steep and inaccessible, and there being no semblance of a road, I was glad to accept the assistance of the Bedouins, who are as agile as cats and clamber about the most difficult places with ease. Around the summit, which is irregular, are traceable the ruins of these fortifications extending perhaps for half a mile. The wall still stands in places, from two to six feet high, and it is possible to trace the outline of part of the buildings at the highest point, though the greater part are an undistinguishable heap of ruins. Along the line of fortification at intervals were small circular towers, several of which are still conspicuous. The thickness of the walls was uniformly about three feet, and they are constructed entirely of rough fragments of the rock of which the upper part of the hill is composed, viz., a white colitic limestone, cemented with clay, and I could detect only three places in which mortar had been used at all. These were an arch in the wall, the curbstones in the path that led down the hill and the water cisterns. One of these cisterns, of which there are two, is quite at the summit, and is in shape an oblong, constructed of round pebbles cemented and plastered with mortar. The other is oval-shaped and of similar construction. It is lower down the hill. Both these tanks are small and shallow, and in such good condition, that, if cleaned out, they might still be serviceable. There are no signs of wells having been sunk that I could see; indeed, the quality of the rock precludes the idea of such an experiment. Somewhat below the highest point is a low arch in the wall, built of selected stones cemented together, and was not improbably that of the gateway, as it is just over the road. There is one other arch in a tower still lower down, but it is made with long slabs placed together uncemented. Only a few yards of the roadway are traceable near the top, the rest is entirely obliterated, but it probably wound round the greater part of the hill. It was very narrow, and is faced at the edge with curbstones. It was at the extreme summit where the outline is best preserved, that the residence of the Chief or Governor probably stood, but to judge from the heap of stones in situ, the building was apparently of no great extent; perhaps a small stone house for the Chief and rude shelter for the garrison were all that was needed. From its position and strength, however, the importance of the castle is sufficiently apparent, and it was doubtless considered quite impregnable in those days of slings and bows, while it of course commanded the whole plain of Soh\u00e1r from hence to the sea.\n\nAccording to the tradition of the Arabs, as related to me by Sheikh R\u00e1shid and confirmed by Seyyid Turk\u00ed and others, the castle at Jebel Ghar\u00e1b\u00e9h, as well as the city of 'Om\u00e1n, were founded by Juland\u00e1-bin-Karkar, (\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0629 \u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631) under whom the city covered a great part of the maritime plain lying between Jebel Ghar\u00e1b\u00e9h and the sea; but there is no doubt that\nboth the ruins of el-Ghar\u00e1beh and the city are much anterior to the time of the Julandaites. Another legend related to me was of the daughter of Juland\u00e1, whose hand became diseased and withered, while the physicians were unable to apply any remedy. She remained thus for a long time, and at last decided to try the benefit of the sea air and bathing, after experiencing which for a short time she entirely recovered. The above tradition, it may be remarked, deriving the Julandaites from the 'Am\u00e1lekite Ben\u00ed Karkar is opposed to the more generally received account, according to which they descend from the el-Azd of 'Om\u00e1n. The 'Am\u00e1leka properly derive from the Ishmaelite or Nejdean stock, as does also Soh\u00e1r, the brother of Tasm and Jadis and the Eponymus of the ancient town. The Julandaites were a powerful dynasty in 'Om\u00e1n, and for some time previous to the second advent of the Persians before Isl\u00e1m held dominion over el-Bahrein and the whole of the Persian Gulf. According to Ross' Annals of 'Om\u00e1n, the Persians at the time of the introduction of Isl\u00e1m had possession of the sea-coast of 'Om\u00e1n, while the Arabs had the interior. Mohammed sent messengers to the two sons of Juland\u00e1, who then ruled in 'Om\u00e1n, and these messengers alighted at Damsetjerd near Soh\u00e1r, a fortified place built by the Persians. Juland\u00e1's sons, 'Abd and Jeifar, and the Arabs agreed to accept Isl\u00e1m, but the Persians, refusing, were attacked in Damsetjerd by Jeifar and compelled to quit 'Om\u00e1n. This Damsetjerd I am inclined to identify with the ruins at Felej el-S\u00fak described above, and this is indicated, I think, both by their position and the Arab tradition attaching to the spot. The extreme antiquity of Soh\u00e1r as one of the principal emporiums of 'Om\u00e1n is shown by its identification with the ancient city of 'Om\u00e1n, the capital of the country, which depends not alone on Arab tradition and authority, but is accepted by European writers, who see in Soh\u00e1r the Omana or Omna of Pliny and Ptolemy.\n\nThe exact period, however, at which the town changed its name is a question more difficult of solution, and regarding which history and tradition afford no clue. The ancient history of Soh\u00e1r is very obscure, as, though frequent references to it may be found in all ages, no good description or account of it exists that I am aware of. A short notice, however, by Ibn Moj\u00e1wir is worth quoting. He says:\u2014\"Soh\u00e1r had 12,000 houses, and every n\u00e1khod\u00e1 dwelt in a separate house, and the people used to draw their drinking water from the aqueduct. Some one told me there were 192 steel-yards for the weighing of merchandize between vendors and purchasers. The town was built of bricks, mortar, and teak-wood, and it became ruined, and the jinni haunted the castles around. Ab\u00fa Bekr el-Bisr\u00ed informed me that the country belonged first to the kings of Kerm\u00e1n of the Selj\u00fak dynasty, then it was ruled by the el-Ghuzz, and afterwards it became deserted and was destroyed by the Arabs.\" Some cultivated spots\nare still to be seen near Jebel Ghar\u00e1beh, but the only outward and visible sign of its former greatness remaining is the aqueduct Felej el-Mo'taridh (\u0641\u0644\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0636).\n\nThis work, which is of good stone masonry, leads along the surface of the ground, with a gentle declivity from the W\u00e1di Jezze in the vicinity of H\u00e1reh Barghesh, (\u062d\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0631\u063a\u0634) or Soh\u00e1r Peak as we call it, to the shore, a distance in a straight line of 14 or 15 miles, and is still distinctly traceable for the greater part of the way, disappearing at the outskirts of the present town.\n\nI noticed by the side of it more than one small cistern of exactly the same pattern and construction as those on Jebel Ghar\u00e1beh. The modern town of Soh\u00e1r has for some years been in a gradually declining state. It has been described in the bright pages of Palgrave, but has still further decayed since his visit. In Soh\u00e1r proper, which lies between R\u00e1s Sell\u00e1n (\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0633\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0646) and the village of Soweyhereh, (\u0633\u0648\u0628\u0631\u0647), the population is now only about 4000, including 400 Persians, a dozen Jews, who have been gradually decreasing in numbers year by year, and half-a-dozen banians; the bulk of the inhabitants here as also along the coast from Soh\u00e1r to Majis being of Persian and Bel\u00fach descent. The citadel, in which the Governor Seyyid Bedr resides, is a lofty, square, plain building, with a strong entrance and well defended by a moat; next to Soh\u00e1r Peak it is the most conspicuous object seen from seawards. From the roof an excellent view is obtained of the surrounding country, and a lovely landscape it is, the sea-shore being fringed with a belt of stately palm gardens and cultivation about three miles broad, while behind, the plain rises gradually, until broken up by the lower spurs of the lofty, dark, serrated range in the back-ground. In the second story of this house is the tomb of Seyyid Thoweyni-bin-Seyyid, but the room in which it stands has been bricked up since my last visit. It is remarkable that of the number believed to have been associated directly or indirectly with Seyyid Selim in his parricidal act, some nine persons, only two are alive, the rest having all, with one exception, met violent deaths. The town wall is very dilapidated, especially the front towards the sea, and is now fast crumbling down, and there are no towers or bastions to it, but the moat is still kept clear on the land side. The circuit of the wall is about a mile, but a very small extent of the area inside is covered with houses, the rest of the ground being bare or occupied with date and other fruit trees. The market contains about forty shops, and is good and well filled, the fish market particularly; the fisheries on the B\u00e1'tinah coast being abundant almost to a miracle. The custom duties are 5 per cent., and the farm this year has been sold to a Persian for $175 per month; but this is no gauge for the amount of imports, as foreign goods are obtained from Muscat, where they have already paid duty, and are consequently free from assessment here. Trade is said to be decreasing annually, and to be transferring itself to\nShargah, which is almost as easy of access to the principal customers as Soh\u00e1r, the Arabs of el-Dh\u00e1hireh and el-Jow, and where goods are cheaper, being imported thither direct from Bombay, and thus saving Muscat dues and re-shipment. Soh\u00e1r has no harbour, nor even the slightest shelter for native craft, and is dependent entirely on its position in being able to tap the trade of Upper el-Dh\u00e1hireh and el-Jow for existence, and should this source of prosperity be in part drawn off by rival ports, it must sink in time to the level of other towns in the B\u00e1tinah. El-Jow, in which el-Bereym\u00ed lies, is the smallest of the six provinces of \u2019Om\u00e1n, and is situate between el-Dh\u00e1hireh and the Shem\u00e1l. It is bounded on the south by Jebel Hafit, on the east by Khatmet el-Shikla and el-Mahdheh, on the north by el-Shem\u00e1l, and to the west by the desert. El-Jow is inhabited by several tribes, both Gh\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed and \u1e24inaw\u00ed; the former having been in the ascendant since the accession of Seyyid Turki. The most powerful and the predominant Gh\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed tribe at present is the Na\u2019\u00edm, which is divided into two distinct and about equal sections, each having numerous subdivisions, and numbers on the whole some 20,000 souls. They occupy el-Bereym\u00ed Proper and Su\u2019areh, (\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647) and their possession of the fort enables them to overawe the whole of the settlement. Since the time of Seyyid \u2019Az\u00e1n, they have been practically uninterfered with by the Muscat Government, but of course own allegiance to the present Sult\u00e1n. The Na\u2019\u00edm are at feud with the Ben\u00ed Y\u00e1s, who occupy part of el-Bereym\u00ed, and their hostility is interrupted only by occasional truces; collisions frequently occurring between them. Of the two sections of the Na\u2019\u00edm one inhabits more particularly el-Jow and Bereym\u00ed, the other el-Dh\u00e1hireh. They are of the more orthodox or Sunn\u00ed persuasion, unlike the generality of \u2019Om\u00e1n\u00eds who are Ib\u00e1diya. The Chief Sheikh of the tribe is Mohammed-bin.-\u2019Al\u00ed-bin-\u1e24am\u00fad, who lives at Dhank, his representative at el-Bereym\u00ed being his son Selim.\n\nThe principal \u1e24inaw\u00ed tribe at el-Bereym\u00ed is the Ben\u00ed Y\u00e1s, who formerly gained so much notoriety by their piratical exploits. The Chief of this tribe is Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khal\u00edfah, a man of strong character, and perhaps the sole individual in these parts possessing any real personal power and authority. He resides at Ab\u00fathab\u00ed, and there are four smaller Sheikhs subordinate to him residing at el-Bereym\u00ed. This tribe takes the lead on the \u1e24inaw\u00ed side in all dissensions between the \u1e24inaw\u00eds and Gh\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed at el-Bereym\u00ed, and during Seyyid \u2019Az\u00e1n\u2019s reign held the predominant position here. The Beni Y\u00e1s occupy the villages of Jemi\u2019, Kat\u00e1reh, Heyl\u00ed, (\u0647\u064a\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0647\u060c \u062c\u064a\u0645\u064a) and the W\u00e1d\u00ed Mes\u2019\u00fad\u00ed (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a) at el-Bereym\u00ed, and are said to have formerly out-numbered the Na\u2019\u00edm, but this state of affairs has become reversed of late. The Gh\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed tribe next in importance to the Na\u2019\u00edm, is the Ben\u00ed Ka\u2019b, which numbers some 15,000 souls, and occupies the district of el-Mahdheh, which includes the mountain range and val-\nleys between W\u00e1d\u00ed el-Jezze and W\u00e1d\u00ed Hatta. There are about 20 villages in this district, the principal of which is el-Mahdheh, where the Sheikh 'Ali-bin-Seif resides. They are all irrigated by conduits drawn from the hills, and as the soil is the same, Mahdheh produces the same kinds and quality of grains and fruits as el-Bereym\u00ed. There is no direct pass through the range from el-Mahdheh to Soh\u00e1r between Hatta and el-Jezze. Other Gh\u00e1fr\u00ed tribes are the Beni Kattab (\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0643\u062a\u0628) and el-Dar\u00e1mikeh (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0643\u0629); and Hinaw\u00ed tribes are the Dhow\u00e1hir (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0647\u064a\u0631), which occupies el-'Ain, el-D\u00e1\u00fad\u00ed, el-Kharais, el-Mareyjib, Sa'neh and Mo'taridh, and rank next in power to the Beni Y\u00e1s and the 'Aw\u00e1mir. This last is a very large nomadic tribe, widely scattered over 'Om\u00e1n, but occupying chiefly the desert outskirts from Kooria Moor\u00eda Bay to the Sabkha, and roaming about with their flocks and herds in a state of semi-savagedom. The 'Aw\u00e1mir are genuine Bedouins, and no wilder or more predatory race exists, I believe, in Arabia. One of their clans, the 'Aff\u00e1r (\u0639\u0641\u0627\u0631), are popularly supposed to feed upon the bodies of animals that have died naturally, but this is denied by the tribe who, however, admit that they are not unfrequently reduced to devouring their skin clothing. A large portion of this tribe has settled down, particularly in the province of 'Om\u00e1n, where they occupy a district of twelve villages called the 'Buld\u00e1n el-'Aw\u00e1mir' and follow agricultural pursuits. The wandering 'Aw\u00e1mir do not even respect the members of other clans of their own tribe unless they are acquainted with them, but plunder indiscriminately all they meet.\n\nIn August 1874, a party of this tribe arrived at Muscat from the neighbourhood of W\u00e1d\u00ed Rekot in Kooria Moor\u00eda Bay to assist His Highness Seyyid Turki in an expedition he was engaged on, and returned afterwards, as they had come, by land. They professed to have no difficulty in making their way over the great desert.\n\nEl-Bereym\u00ed is the appellation usually applied to a collection of seven villages or settlements, of which the one, specially bearing that name, is the largest and most important. The others are Su'areh to the N., Jem\u00ed, Kat\u00e1reh and Heyl\u00ed to the N. W., and 'Ain and Mo'taridh to the S. E.; and the population of the whole may be estimated at 12,000 to 15,000. From the outside the appearance of these settlements is very pretty and refreshing, the date palms and orchards forming a green-setting to the low palm leaf huts, which are scattered throughout, and which just peep through the foliage. They have a striking similarity to the \"\u00e1b\u00e1dis\" or settlements in Mekr\u00e1n. The general condition of the people is low, and there is a noticeable equality of property throughout, but this is owing probably more to the want of good government and the chronic state of warfare and insecurity they live in, than to the natural disadvantages of the land. Agriculture is in rather a mediocre state as regards cereals and vegetables, the principal object of culture being of\ncourse the date. They are not dependent on the annual rainfall which is small, but are able to irrigate with certainty by means of their valuable aqueducts drawn from the hill range as well as from wells, water being abundant and at no great depth. Each settlement has at least one of these canals, that of el-Bereym\u00ed Proper being brought from a perennial spring in the hills distant about twenty miles. The water in this canal was quite warm to the touch, but I forget what they told me about the source. The grains grown are wheat, jowari, maize, barley, and bajri, the spring crops being wheat, the autumn, jowari, and bajri. This is sometimes succeeded by a crop of beans or pulse, but the latter are never sown intermingled with cereals. The stubble is always ploughed in and never burnt, and the only other manure used is cattle dung. The vegetables grown are sweet potatoes, radishes, cucumbers, egg-plants, onions, and pumpkins. Tobacco, cotton, red and white, and lucerne are also grown, the last for the use of cattle. Eight or nine crops of this are obtained in the year, showing the quality of the soil, which is fertile but thin. But more care and attention are bestowed on the fruits than on anything else, and they consequently arrive at considerable excellence. All the best kinds of dates are cultivated, *furd*, *maseybili*, *khalas*, &c., though they are not considered equal to the same varieties in Bedieh (\u0628\u062f\u064a\u0647) and Sem\u00e1il (\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0644). The other fruits are peaches, mangoes, custard-apples, limes, sweet-limes, oranges, mulberries, pomegranates, melons, guavas, figs, and grapes. There are only a very few horses at el-Bereym\u00ed belonging to the Sheikhs; cattle too are scarce; camels are abundant and cheap; and asses are used extensively for burden and riding. The food of the people is chiefly dates and coarse bread or rice, varied by salt-fish, camels\u2019 and goats\u2019 flesh. Milk is abundant, and a hard sort of cream cheese is made, the juice of an euphorbia being sometimes used instead of rennet for coagulating the milk. On the sea-coast the intestines of fish are often used for this purpose. There being no banians or other regular traders, there is no general bazar at Bereym\u00ed, but every afternoon a market is held where the Bedouins assemble with their produce and animals for sale or barter with those who can supply their wants. Money is little used on such occasions where cloth, articles of food, camels, donkeys, goats, and all the miscellaneous articles of an Arab household, are exchanged. The most trifling things change hands, and the scene is, as may be imagined, a lively and picturesque one. The ladies here, I observed, did not wear the tinselled mask seen in Muscat, but covered their heads with a black cloth veil, which is still more unbecoming. I must not omit that like their European sisters they wore high-heeled shoes. Their occupations, besides household affairs, are spinning, mat-weaving, felt-making, and tending goats and kine.\n\nEl-Bereym\u00ed formerly possessed two forts, only one of which is now\nstanding, the other has been demolished, and lies a heap of ruins. Both are said to have been built by the Show\u00e1mis, a strong clan of the Na'im occupying chiefly the W\u00e1d\u00ed Jezze, but the fort still standing was improved and strengthened by the Wahhsb\u00eds during their occupation. It consists of four towers joined by curtains and surrounded by a deep ditch. It is of square form, built entirely of mud or unburnt bricks, and carries eight guns of sizes. The breadth of the ditch is about 25 feet, and both scarp and counterscarp are quite steep and faced with brick work. The rampart is eight feet high and two thick, and there is an open space of 20 paces between it and the towers. These towers rise perhaps 40 feet, the curtain somewhat less than half way up, and each side of the square formed by them is about one hundred and fifty feet. The gate is the weakest part of the structure, there being only a single small wooden door standing half way across the ditch, which is here bridged with the trunks of two date trees. Inside the fort is a residence for the Sheikh with accommodation for the men, and some godowns. Water is abundantly provided by two wells, which would yield sufficient for a large garrison. I tasted the water of one, and it was perfectly sweet and good. Near the outer gate is a brass 24-pounder, mounted as a field-piece, having the name of Seyyid-bin-Sult\u00e1n, A. H. 1258 in Arabic, and the English date 1842. It is one of a batch of 20 that Seyyid Sa'id procured from America at that time for his corvette the Sultan. This gun was brought from Soh\u00e1r by Seyyid 'Az\u00e1n, in 1870, in his expedition against Bereym\u00ed, and was used against the fort it now defends. With unusual energy and forethought for an Arab, Seyyid 'Az\u00e1n brought spare carriage wheels, harness, and tents, all of which are carefully stored up in a godown. The harness did not look as if it had ever been used, and they told me the gun had been dragged thither entirely by manual labour. The fort is fairly well situated, and stands out on the plain, but on the N. W. side the houses and cultivation encroach somewhat close upon it, and on the other side lie the ruins of Sedeyr\u00ed's fort at no great distance, which would afford capital shelter for an enemy. Both as regards strength and position it is the most important fort in this part of 'Om\u00e1n, and is generally regarded as the key of the country towards the west. Its reduction, therefore, would be considered necessary by any force approaching from that side.\n\nI endeavoured to gather information respecting the route between 'Om\u00e1n and Nejd, but the accounts were somewhat discrepant. According to some the first district beyond el-Jow is Bein\u00faneh, in which is el-'Ankeh, a hamlet of the Ben\u00ed Kattab, with a small date grove, the Sheikh of which is Sa'id-bin-Aweydim\u00ed. Next to Bein\u00faneh lies el-Dhafreh, inhabited chiefly by the Men\u00e1sir, and where there is a watered grassy vale called Da'f\u00eds, visited in season for pasture by the Men\u00e1sir, 'Aw\u00e1m\u00edr, Ben\u00ed Y\u00e1s, Ben\u00ed Kattab, el-Mizaniyeh, and el-Ghafaleh nomads. Further on between el-Dhafreh,\nKa\u1e6dar, and el-\u1e24asa is the district of el-Ja\u2019f\u016br. Through these districts lies the route from el-Bereymi to el-\u1e24asa, from whence the road continues to el-Ri\u0101dh. There is no tract that can be followed, as the sand is blown about by the wind, but there appear to be two general routes, one of which is used more in winter, the other in summer; the first is straighter and shorter, the other passes near the sea, is more winding, and after leaving the Sabkheh turns north for three days. The journey is not considered dangerous or difficult, as water is found in a great many places, though usually very brackish, and they seldom have to carry a supply for more than two days. Caravans very rarely make the journey, and travel only at night, taking about thirty days from el-\u1e24asa to el-Bereymi. Troops as a rule travel by day only, their pace being a gentle amble, and they cover the distance in twenty to twenty-five days. A k\u0101sid takes ten days. The Men\u0101s\u012br and Ben\u012b Y\u0101s chiefly hold possession of the eastern part of the route, the Al Morra of the western. No hills are met on the way, and the only W\u0101dis are el-Sabkheh and el-Sohba. I give in a tabular form the halting stations of the two routes, but as already observed, water is procurable in many other places. The Sabkheh, or Sabkheh Matt\u012b, as it is sometimes termed, is a marshy tract or W\u0101d\u012b about forty miles in breadth, commencing from the vicinity of W\u0101d\u012b Jabr\u012bn and entering the Persian Gulf between Long. 51\u00b0 50' and 52\u00b0 20', lat. 24\u00b0. In some parts it is a treacherous morass, only to be crossed at the beaten tracks, and it is said that should the camel miss the path, he becomes engulfed in the mud. The Sabkheh, according to the concurrent testimony of all the Sheikhs and best informed persons I have spoken to on the subject, both in el-Jow and Muscat, including His Highness Seyyid Turki, is the boundary line between Nejd and \u2019Om\u0101n, and has been so considered from time immemorial. The water-shed of el-Aarid and Yem\u0101meh appears to lie S. E., the W\u0101d\u012b \u1e24an\u012bfeh and all other W\u0101dis converging towards el-Randha, where they unite in the W\u0101d\u012b el-Sohba, which falls into the Persian Gulf just above the Sabkheh Matt\u012b, probably at Khor el-Dhoan. The Bedouins in the great desert rear great numbers of camels, the sale of which constitutes their chief support. The Al Morra and \u2019Aw\u0101mir are said to traverse it extensively, as it is not entirely destitute of water, which can be obtained of brackish quality in places by digging. Palms and other large trees are not met with, but dwarf acacias and herbaceous vegetation, suitable for camel fodder, are sufficiently abundant. Besides two species of gazelle and the oryx, numerous ostriches inhabit the more northern and western portions, and are hunted for the sake of their feathers, which eventually find their way to Mecca, there being no sale for them in \u2019Om\u0101n. There is said to be a route running direct S. E. from Nejd to Mahra that takes twenty-five days. Water is procured every three or four days, and is carried on in skins, the\nBedouins finding their way without difficulty; a light camel-load of dates and flour enabling them to traverse a long distance. In 1870, Sa'ud-bin-Jelowi came straight across the great desert from Nejran to Ab\u00fathabi in fifty-six days, travelling leisurely, but for the last fifteen days he and his followers were greatly pressed for food, their store having become exhausted. His purpose was to meet Seyyid 'Az\u00e1n, which he did at Burka, and then accompanied him in his expedition against el-Bereym\u00ed.\n\nSouth of Yem\u00e1meh and three days from el-Hasa lies the fertile and well-watered valley of Jabr\u00edn, whose groves of date palms are said to extend for several miles. It is situated entirely in the desert, and does not form part of Nejd. It was formerly a large and flourishing settlement, but it subsequently became so malarious and unhealthy, that the inhabitants were driven away, and it is now almost entirely destitute of permanent residents. The Arabs claim an antiquity of 800 years for it, but it has long since fallen to ruin, though I believe the fort and some of the walls of the houses are still standing. It is also said that after heavy floods gold coins are sometimes picked up by the Bedouins. The dates belong to the Al Morra and Dow\u00e1ir tribes, who visit Jabr\u00edn in the summer to collect the harvest, which is carried for sale to Nejd and el-Hasa. It is also extensively resorted to by the neighbouring nomads with their flocks and herds for the sake of the luxuriant pasturage.\n\nIn el-Bereym\u00ed I found a small colony of Arab gipsies, Zat\u1e6d (\u0628) or Zat\u00fat, as the Arabs call them, settled and I have since had further opportunity of observing these people. In his 'Alte Geographie Arabiens' Dr. Sprenger has identified the Zat\u1e6d with the Jats of India, and though, as he shows, they have been in Arabia upwards of 1,000 years, they are at once distinguishable from the Arabs as a distinct race. They are taller in person and more swarthy, and they have that cunning and shifty look stamped on their physiognomy so observable in the gipsies of Europe. The Zat\u1e6d are spread over Central and Eastern Arabia from Muscat to Mesopotamia, and are very numerous in 'Om\u00e1n. Everywhere they maintain themselves as a separate class and do not intermix by marriage with strangers. It occurs sometimes, I believe, that an Arab takes a Zat\u1e6diya to wife, but no pure Arab girl would be given to a Zat\u1e6d, though daughters of Arabs by slave mothers may occasionally be obtained by them. It is probable, too, that the race is continued to some extent by adoption as well as procreation, as they do not seem to be a prolific people. In 'Om\u00e1n, besides those who have been permanently settled in the country, are to be found many who come across from Persia and Bel\u00fachist\u00e1n in search of employment or to visit their kinsfolk, but their stay is seldom prolonged. The Arab Zat\u1e6d are divided into numerous clans or families, for which they have adopted Arab nomenclature, such as Wil\u00e1d Ma\u1e6dlab (\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0645\u0637\u0644\u0628), Wil\u00e1d \u1e32ab\u00e1l (\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0642\u0628\u0627\u0644), Wil\u00e1d Shaghraf (\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0634\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0641).\nMusand\u00e9 (\u0645\u0633\u0646\u062f)\u060c Harimal (\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0644)\u060c Haik (\u0647\u064a\u0643)\u060c \u2019Ashori (\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0649)\u060c &c., and each of which is in a state of clientship to some powerful Arab tribe, generally that of course with which it has most trading connections. The Zat\u1e6d all profess the Musalm\u00e1n religion, but no doubt they retain many of their own customs and usages. The levirate law obtains among them, but should there be no brother, the nearest male relative can take the widow to wife. They are looked down upon by the Arabs as an inferior race, but they are valued for the useful services they perform; and as their persons and property are always respected, they usually go about unarmed. In Nejd, I hear, the Zat\u1e6d women are considered to be very handsome and dance publicly for money, but they are reputed to be chaste and moral; they are a necessary ingredient at private festivities, as they set off the assembly by their beauty and the party is not thought complete without them; they are consequently also more sought after by the Arabs there as wives. In \u2019Om\u00e1n the case is different. The \u2019Om\u00e1n\u00ed women are more highly endowed by nature than their Nejd sisters, and the Zat\u1e6d are not thought so favourably of by comparison. They appear to lead a semi-nomadic life, and move about from village to village with their families and chattels, working as occasion requires, but a few families may be found permanently established in most of the large towns and settlements. Their little mat hovels are the smallest and wretchedest human tenements I have ever seen, being merely a couple of mats arranged round three or four sticks tied together at the top, and the whole concern not usually exceeding 4 or 5 feet in height. They are accomplished handicraftsmen, being farriers, smiths, tinkers, carpenters, weavers, and barbers. They manufacture also guns and matchlocks; indeed most of the trades and manufactures seem to be in their hands, and they are to the natives of the interior what the Banians and other Indians are at the sea-port towns.\n\nThe Arabs assert that the Zat\u1e6d speak among themselves in a dialect unintelligible to strangers, and they call this \u2018Rattini\u2019 or \u2018Farsi\u2019; but it is my belief that the original tongue of the Zat\u1e6d has become almost entirely obliterated through long and intimate intercourse with the Arabs, and that what they speak among themselves is a jargon or gibberish of their own particular manufacture, composed of a corrupted Arabic mixed with the few Jat words they have retained. To effect this they have invented a simple and ingenious system by which they are able to transmute any word required into their own jargon without the slightest hesitation. The plan is to prefix the letter m and to suffix an additional syllable eek, while lengthening the first or second syllable of the word itself. Thus Bard (cold) becomes Mbardeek; Kamar (moon), Mkamareek; Ghol (snake), Mgholeek. I subjoin a few words that appear to be of their own vocabulary, as specimens:\u2014Father\u2014Bweieekee; Mother\u2014Mahiktee; Brother\u2014\nM\u00e2nas; Son\u2014Kashk\u00e2shee; Man\u2014Fseyil; Woman\u2014Fseyileh; Slave\u2014Daugeh; Head\u2014Kerr\u00e2; Body\u2014Kerr\u00e2sh; Bread\u2014Kshayim; Rice\u2014Fid\u00e2mah; Knife\u2014Jerr\u00e2ha; Water\u2014Tsamm\u00e9e; Donkey\u2014Gyadoor; Go\u2014Bat\u00fbs; Child\u2014Tow\u00e2tneek.\n\nThe Arabs do not of course trouble themselves with speculations as to the origin of this people, but have a traditionary belief that they immigrated to Arabia from Persia at some remote period. I may remark, in conclusion, that resemblance between the Zatt and the Gipsies of Europe in character, appearance, habits, and profession (I have no means of comparing the languages) is so striking and complete, that the hypothesis of their identity of origin must be regarded as, at least, highly probable.\n\nA Route from el-Bereym\u00ee to el-Hasa.\n\n| Names of places. |\n|------------------|\n| El-Dhafreh       | \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0647\u0631\u0629 |\n| Khotem           | \u062e\u062a\u0645 |\n| El-Ser\u00e2d\u00eeh       | \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u062d |\n| Bed\u00fb el-Motowwa' | \u0628\u062f\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0648\u0639 |\n| Bein\u00fbnah         | \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0646\u0629 |\n| Bed\u00fb Jerr\u00e2sh     | \u0628\u062f\u0648 \u062c\u0631\u0634\u064a |\n| Sakkheh Matt\u00ee    | \u0635\u062e\u0629 \u0645\u0637\u064a |\n| El-Sala'         | \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0639 |\n| Salwah           | \u0633\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0647 |\n| El-Ghodha        | \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0636\u064a |\n| El-Sakik         | \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0643\u0643 |\n| El-Hemr\u00e2r        | \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0631 |\n| El-Taraf         | \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0631\u0641 |\n| El-Hasa          | \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0635\u0629 |\n\nFrom El-Hasa, i.e., Hef\u00fbf, the usual road to Nejd is followed.\n### Another Route from el-Bereym\u00ed to el-Hass.\n\n| Names of places | Quality of water | Remarks |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| El-Johar        | Wells of good water | Acacia jungle, but no cultivation.

S.\n\nNote. It is proposed to publish a translation of the seven Mo'allaq\u00e1t, or \"Suspen-\nded poems\" of the Arabs, together with a rendering into English of the notices of their\nauthors contained in the famous Kit\u00e1b-el-Agh\u00e1n\u00ed, or \"Book of the Songs of the Arabs,\"\nby Abu-l-Faraj el-Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed. The following version of the fourth Mo'allaqah, that of\nLebid, with its accompanying notice, is here printed as a specimen of the work.\n\nThe book will consist of four parts: I. An Introduction, giving a sketch of the\nhistory of Arabia during the century before the Hijrah to which the poems belong, a\nbrief account of early Arabian poetry generally, some information regarding the mode\nin which the poems have been handed down and the early r\u00e1w\u00eds or traditionists to\nwhom their preservation and illustration are due, together with an examination of the\nhistorical data afforded by the Kit\u00e1b-el-Agh\u00e1n\u00ed regarding the lives of their authors.\nII. Translations from the Kamil-et-taw\u00e1r\u00edkh of Ibn-el-Athir and the Kit\u00e1b-el-Agh\u00e1n\u00ed,\ngiving the history of the Wars of Bas\u00fas and D\u00e1his. III. Notices of each of the seven\npoets (except Tarafeh, who is not mentioned in the work) translated from the Kit\u00e1b-\nel-Agh\u00e1n\u00ed. The account of Tarafeh will be filled in from extracts from Ibn Quteybeh\nand others supplied by Reisako's edition of his Mo'allaqah. IV. Following each\nnotice, a translation of the poet's Mo'allaqah in English prose, line for line with the\noriginal. Parts II, III, and IV will be illustrated where necessary by notes append-\ned.\n\nThe renderings of the poems will be taken from the text of Arnold (Leipzig 1850),\nthose of the Kit\u00e1b-el-Agh\u00e1n\u00ed from the B\u00fcl\u00e2q edition (in 20 volumes) of that work, and\nthose of passages from the Kamil from Tornborg's edition.\n\nIt is hoped that an accurate translation of the most ancient and authentic poems of\nthe Arab race\u2014poems which have for ages been regarded with the highest admiration as\nmodels of style and composition, and which undoubtedly present a fresh and faithful\nportraiture of the people among whom they appeared\u2014illustrated by the oldest\nand most trustworthy traditions regarding the circumstances under which they were\ncomposed and the valiant stock to which their authors belonged, will not be found\nunacceptable.\n\nThe system of transliteration applied to Arabic words when they occur in Persian\nand Hindustani which has been adopted by the Asiatic Society, though well suited for\nthe purposes of those languages, is not appropriate when the object is to represent in\nEnglish Arabic words as uttered by Arabs. In the following pages, therefore, a sys-\ntem has been followed which is believed to agree closely with the best standard of pro-\nnunciation current in Arabia; it is mainly that adopted by Mr. E. W. Lane in his\ngreat Arabic-English Lexicon, the only differences being that among the consonants\n\u0161 is represented by the old-English \u0160 (with which it exactly agrees), \u1e0d by \u1e0f (to mark\nclearly its relation to \u0636), \u0642 by Q, hemzeh by ', and \u0621 by '\u060c and in rendering the\nvowels the circumflex instead of the acute accent has been used to indicate length, and\ni and \u0113 substituted for ee and oo. In the use of the taml\u00e9h of the Fat\u1e25ah (giving the\nvowel \u0627 the e-sound) and the Dammeh (change of u to o) an endeavour has been made\nto follow as closely as possible the rules laid down by Mr. Lane in his paper at pp. 171\u2014\n186 of the 4th volume of the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft.\n### Another Route from el-Berem\u00ed to el-Ilaan.\n\n| Name of place | Quality of water | Remarks |\n|---------------|-----------------|---------|\n| El-Johar      | Wells of good water (food, from shallow pits) | Acacia, jungle, but no cultivation.

His father was called Rab\u00ee'at-el-mo'tarr\u00een (\"a Spring to those who came to ask for his bounty\") on account of his liberality and generosity: he was slain by the Ben\u00fb Lebid in the war which befell between them and their tribe and his people. His uncle was Ab\u00fb Niz\u00e2r '\u00c2mir ibn M\u00e2lik Mul\u00e2'ib-el-Asinneh (\"the player with lances\"), a name which he gained from the verse of Aus son of Hojr\u2014\n\n\"'\u00c2mir played gaily with the points of the spears,\nAnd the fortune of the whole host betook itself thereto.'\"\n\nThe mother of Lebid was T\u00e2mineh daughter of Zinb\u00e2\u2018 of 'Abs, one of the daughters of Je\u011fimeh the son of Raw\u00e2hah. Lebid was one of the poets who are counted as belonging to the Ignorance, and also a mukhad-rim, or one who attained to the days of el-Isl\u00e2m; and he was one of the noblest of poets who composed faultless verses, of good knights, of reciters of the Qur'\u00e2n, and of those who attained to long life: it is said that he lived a hundred and forty-five years.\n\nAhmed ibn 'Abd-el-'Aziz el-Jauhari states in his traditions respecting Lebid's life, on the authority of 'Omar ibn Shebbeh, who heard it from 'Abd-all\u00e2h ibn Mohammed ibn Hak\u00eem, and it is also asserted by el-Hasan ibn 'Ali, who was told by Ibn Mahraweyh, who heard it from 'Abd-all\u00e2h ibn Ab\u00ee Sa'd, who heard it from 'Ali ibn es-Sabb\u00e2h, who heard it from Ibn el-Kelbi, and also from 'Ali ibn el-Musawwar, who had it from el-Asma'i, and also from el-Med\u00e2'ini and other men whom he mentions, among whom are Abu-l-Yaq\u00fbb, Ibn Da'b, Ibn Ja'diyeh, and el-Waqq\u00e2si,\u2014that Lebid son of Rabi'ah came to the Prophet of God (may God bless him and grant him peace!) with a deputation from the Ben\u00fb Kil\u00e2b after the death of his brother Arbed and '\u00c2mir ibn et-Tufeyl: that he then professed el-Isl\u00e2m, and, separating himself from his tribe, became a companion of the Prophet,* and was a sincere believer; that he afterwards settled in el-K\u00fbfeh in the days of 'Omar ibn el-Khatt\u00e2b (may God be satisfied of him!), and abode there until his death towards the end of the Khalifeh-ship of Mo'\u00e2wiyeh. His life reached to a hundred and forty-five years, of which he lived ninety in the Ignorance and the rest under el-Isl\u00e2m.\n\n'Omar ibn Shebbeh says in his traditions, and I was also told by 'Abd-all\u00e2h ibn Mohammed ibn Hak\u00eem, that Lebid said, when he reached the age of seventy and seven\u2014\n\"My soul stood and plainted to me with bitter weeping\u2014\n'I have borne thee now seven years over the three-score and ten'.\n\"I said\u2014'and if thou wilt add but three thou wilt reach the goal of\nthy hope,\nfor in but three years more the fourscore will be filled.' \"\nAnd when he reached the age of ninety, he said\u2014\n\"Now that I have overpassed my space by twenty* years\nI stand with shoulders bared to meet the stroke of Fate.\"\nAnd when he lived to a hundred and ten, he said\u2014\n\"Is there no life left for a man after that he has lived\na hundred years, and after that yet ten years more?\"\nAnd when he lived still longer, he said\u2014\n\"Verily I am a-weary of life and its length\nand of hearing men ask\u2014'how goes Lebid?'\nMen are overborne, but he stands still unconquered,\nby Time, the long, the everlasting dreary length!\nI see the day come upon me and the night,\nand each of them after its passing returns again:\nEach day as it comes is like the day I met before\u2014\nit wanes not\u2014I grow feeble\u2014it but grows in strength.\"\n\nMohammed ibn el-Hasan ibn Dureyd informed me that he had been\ntold by Ab\u00fb H\u00e2mid es-Sijist\u00e2n\u00ee, who said that he had heard it from el-\nA\u1e63ma\u2018i, that \u2018\u00c2mir ibn M\u00e2lik Mul\u00e2\u2018ib-el-Asinneh, whose by-name was Abu-l\nBera\u2019, repaired with a company of the Ben\u00fb Ja\u2018far, among whom were Lebid\nson of Rabi\u2018ah, M\u00e2lik son of Ja\u2018far, and \u2018\u00c2mir son of M\u00e2lik Lebid\u2019s uncle,* to the Court of en-No\u2019m\u00e2n. And they found with the King er-Rabi\u2018 ibn Ziy\u00e2d\nof \u2018Abs, whose mother was F\u00e2t\u00eemeh daughter of el-Khurshub. Er-Rabi\u2018\nwas one of en-No\u2019m\u00e2n\u2019s boon companions, as was also a certain merchant of\nSyria whose name was Zaraj\u00fbn* son of Naufil; the King had dealings with\nhim in his trade, and, as he was a man of polished manners and abundance\nof jest and anecdote, delighted to make him merry. Accordingly, whenever\nen-No\u2019m\u00e2n desired to have a drinking party in private, he would send for\nthe Syrian, and en-N\u00eet\u00e2s\u00ee, a physician who was in his service, and er-Rabi\u2018\nson of Ziy\u00e2d, and they formed his company. And when the Ja\u2018faris reach-\ned el-H\u00eereh, they came before en-No\u2019m\u00e2n to present their petitions; and\nas often as they went forth from his presence, er-Rabi\u2018 who remained alone\nwith him used to abuse them to him and mention all their bad qualities:\nfor the Ben\u00fb Ja\u2018far were enemies of the tribe of \u2018Abs.\u201d And he did not\ncease backbiting them to en-No\u2019m\u00e2n until he made him ill-disposed towards\nthem. And one day when the Ja\u2018faris came before him, the King treated\nthem with harshness, although he had formerly received them with honour\nand seated them near himself; and they left his presence in wrath. Now\nLebid had been left behind to guard their goods and to take out their camels every morning to graze; and he came to them one night when they were talking of what er-Rabi\u2018 had done, and asked them what was the matter; but they refused to tell him. Then he said \u201cBy God! I will not guard aught of your goods or take out a camel of yours to pasture, except ye tell me the whole matter.\u201d (And it must here be told that the mother of Lebid was an orphan who had been brought up under the protection of er-Rabi\u2018). They said \u201cThy mother\u2019s brother has slandered us to the King and turned away his face from us.\u201d Then said Lebid\u2014\u201cCan ye arrange so that he and I shall be brought face to face? I will withhold him from further mischief by a speech that shall bite and sting him\u201d: en-No\u2019m\u00e2n shall never have any regard for him again.\u201d \u201cHast thou anything to say to him?\u201d they asked. \u201cYes,\u201d said Lebid. \u201cCome, we will try thee,\u201d said they, \u201cSatirize this herb.\u201d Now there was in front of them a plant with slender shoots and few leaves, growing close to the ground, of the kind called et-teribeh. So Lebid began:\u2014\u201cThis teribeh, which is neither fit for making a good fire, nor for nourishing a house, nor does it delight its neighbour\u2014its sticks are mean, its leaves withered, its advantage little\u2014the most evil of herbs for pasture, the poorest of them in leafage, the hardest of them to pull up\u2014its country is far away, he that eats of it is a-hungered, he that lives thereon is a contented soul! Set me face to face with the brother of \u2018Abs\u2014I will drive him away from you in disgrace\u2014I will leave him overwhelmed with confusion.\u201d They said \u201cWe will wait till the morning before giving thee our decision.\u201d And \u2018\u00c2mir said to them\u2014\u201cWatch this boy of yours\u201d (meaning Lebid): \u201cif ye see him sleeping, he is not fit to undertake the contest with er-Rabi\u2018: he speaks only what comes to his tongue; but if ye find that he watches the whole night, then he is the man to do the deed.\u201d And they watched him, and found him mounted on one of the camel-saddles, with his teeth clenched on the pummel of it; and so he remained till dawn. And they said \u201cThou art the man for the enterprize!\u201d Then they took him and shaved his head, leaving only his top-knot,\u201d and clad him in a hulleh. And he went forth with them, and they took him before en-No\u2019m\u00e2n. And they found him eating his morning meal in the company of er-Rabi\u2018 ibn Ziy\u00e2d: the two were eating together, and no third person was with them. And the palace and court were filled with deputations from different tribes. And when en-No\u2019m\u00e2n had done his meal, he gave permission to the Jaffaris to enter: and they went in; and when their affair came on for hearing, they set forth the requests for which they had come. And er-Rabi\u2018 interrupted their speech. Then Lebid said\u2014\n\n\u201cShall my head be driven hither and thither every day?\nMany the battle that is better than quietness!\nWe are the children of the Mother of the Four,\nOur swords are keen, our platters ever full:\nWe are the best of '\u00c2mir son of \u0160a'\u015fa\u2018ah\u2014\nCleavers of skulls in the midst of the battle-din:\nWe give to eat to all men from our brimming bowls\n\u2014 Stay! God keep thee from cursing! eat not with him!\n\nEn-No'm\u00e2n withdrew his hand from the food that was before him, and said, \"By God! boy\u2014thou hast disgusted me with my meat: I never felt for it the loathing that I feel to-day!\" Then er-Rabi\u2018 started forward, and said, \"He lies, by God! the son of an unchaste woman! verily I did with his mother thus and thus!\" And Lebid said to him\u2014\"Such an one as thou did as thou sayest with a nurseling of his house, his own near kinswoman! Nay, my mother was of those women who do not the things thou sayest.\" And en-No'm\u00e2n satisfied the requests of the Ja'faris at once and dismissed them. And er-Rabi\u2018 son of Ziy\u00e2d immediately went to his house. And en-No'm\u00e2n sent to him double of what it was his custom to give him, and bade him depart to his people. And er-Rabi\u2018 wrote* to him saying\u2014\"I know that what Lebid said has made a deep impression on thy heart; and I will not cease entreating thee until thou send one to strip me and proclaim to those about thee that I am not as he said.\" But the king replied to him\u2014\"Nay, thou canst do nothing now to shield thyself from what was said of Lebid, nor canst thou recall again that with which men's tongues are busy. Go and join thyself to thy people.\" And er-Rabi\u2018 departed to his people, and sent from among them the following verses to en-No'm\u00e2n\u2014\n\n\"If I have driven away my camels, verily I have a spacious place of plenty\u2014there is no place of plenty like it in breadth and length:\nA place where, if all Lakhm were to come down thereon,\nthey would not match with their wealth one feather of Semwil.\nThe she-camels with their young ones graze on the juicy herbage there,\nthough it be not like your pastures of salt and honey.\nStay thou in thy land alone, and recline now that I am gone\nnow with en-N\u00eet\u00e2s\u00ee and now with Nauf\u00eel\u2019s son.\"\n\nAnd en-No'm\u00e2n answered him in these words\u2014\n\n\"Hasten with thy camel-saddle whithersoever thou wilt, so that it be away from me,\nbut lengthen not speech upon me, and leave thy vain discourse.\nI have been told a thing that I shall never forget,\nwhile Egypt lies by the side of Syria and the Nile.\nAnd what boots thy defence of thee against it, now that it has been borne abroad\nby the swift riding-camels through the rugged plains of Semwil? The thing has been said, be it true or be it a lie, and what shall excuse thee from a thing that has once been said? Botake thyself where thou findest the land so broad and wide, and feast thine eyes thereon in all its breadth and length!\" 18\n\nAnd it is said that Lebid also satirized er-Rabi' in the following verses, which some however allege to be spurious\u201419\n\n\"O Rabi'\u2014let not any one bring thee before me And ask me of thy faults and thy true nature Or enquire what man thou art and what thou wast! For thou, when the battle-press girds thee round, art like Naught but a thing which hindrances constrain; Verily thou sippest naught but a sip and tastest it; If he that withstands thy flight but feel thee, surely He will find thee even lighter than himself; Verily thou art an old traitor, a hypocrite, A manifest villain that returns to his villainy again and again.\"\n\nLebid used to compose poems, but forbade them to be published until he composed his Mo'allagah; and what had been done by er-Rabi' son of Ziy\u00e2d and Hamzeh son of Damarah and the other chiefs who formed their company having been mentioned, Lebid said to his people \"Publish now my poems.\"\n\nI quote from the book handed down by Abu-l-Hakem: he says\u2014\"I was told by el-'Al\u00e2 son of 'Abdall\u00e2h el-Muwaqqa' that Lebid was once present among a company of persons who were telling tales by night in the house of el-Wel\u00eed son of 'Oqbeh,20 who was governor of el-K\u00fbfeh. And el-Wel\u00eed asked Lebid of what passed between him and er-Rabi' son of Ziy\u00e2d before en-No'm\u00e2n. Lebid replied, 'That befell in the days of the Ignorance: but now God has brought to us el-Isl\u00e2m.' And el-Wel\u00eed said, 'I adjure thee that thou tell me.' And when an Amir used this form of asking, it was considered necessary to obey him; so Lebid began to tell the tale. And a certain man of Ghani21 who bore a grudge against him said\u2014'We were not informed of this.' 'Doubtless, son of my brother,' said Lebid, 'thy father could not come by the knowledge of things like this: he was not of those who were admitted to witness them, that he should tell thee of them.'\"\n\nMy uncle told me that he had been informed by el-Kir\u00e2n\u00ee, who heard it from el-'Omari, who was told by el-Heythem, who learned it from el-'Ayy\u00e2sh, who was told by Mohammed ibn el-Munteshar, that Lebid was never heard to boast of his former state after he became a Muslim except one day, when he happened to be in a courtyard belonging to Ghani. He was lying on his back, having wrapped himself in his mantle, when there\napproached him a young man of Ghani who said\u2014\"May God bring evil upon Tufeyl for that he said\"\u2014\n'May God requite Ja'far for what they did to us when our sandals made us of those who tread the earth and slipped so that we fell!\nThey refused to be weary of us: and verily if our mother had met from us that which they met, she would have been a-weary!\nThe lord of abundant wealth and every afflicted one\u2014in the chambers of their house they were warmed and sheltered:\nThey said \"Hasten in hither, until ye can see your ways when the darkness is folded away by the dawning of the day.\"\nWould that I knew what good he met at the hands of the Ben\u00fb Ja'far, that he should say this of them\"! And Lebid drew aside the mantle from his face and said\u2014\"Son of my brother! the men that thou knowest belong to a time when a Police has been established, when men call on one another for help and receive it: when a House of public provision has been set up whence the servant goes forth with a wallet to feed the hungry, and a Public Treasury from which every Muslim receives his stipend; but if thou hadst known Tufeyl on the day when he said this, thou wouldst not have reviled him.\" Then he lay down again on his back, saying, \"I ask pardon from God!\" and he continued to repeat these words until he arose from rest.\n\nIsm\u00e2'il ibn Y\u00fbnus informed me that he had been told by 'Omar ibn Shebbeh, who heard it from Mohammed ibn Hak\u00eem, who had it from Kh\u00e2lid ibn Sa'id, that Lebid one day in el-K\u00eefeh passed by a place where a company of the Ben\u00fb Nahl were sitting: and he was supporting himself by a hooked staff. And they sent a messenger to ask him who was the best poet of the Arabs. He replied\u2014\"The Wandering King, the Man of the Ulcers.\" And the messenger returned and told them, and said \"This is Imra' el-Qeya.\" Then he returned again and asked him \"Who next?\" He answered \"The Boy of the Ben\u00fb Bekr that was slain.\" And he came back and told them, and said \"This is Tarafeh.\" Then he returned a second time and asked \"Who next?\" Lebid answered\u2014\"Next after these is the Man of the Hooked Staff,\" meaning himself. This story is differently told by Ahmed ibn 'Abdall\u00e2h ibn 'Amm\u00e2r, who says that it was related to him by Ya'q\u00fbb eth-Thaqafi, Ibn 'Ayy\u00e2sh, and Mis'ar ibn Kid\u00e2m, all of whom heard it from 'Abd-el-Melik ibn 'Omar, who affirmed that he had been told it by the very person who was sent to Lebid by the men who were called \"The noble reciters of the Qur'\u00e2n\u2014el-qurrd' el-ashrdf.\" (El-Heythem says that he asked Ibn 'Ayy\u00e2sh who were \"the noble reciters of the Qur'\u00e2n,\" and that he replied that they were Suleym\u00e2n son of \u015earad el-Khuz\u00e2'i, el-Musayyab son of Nejbeh el-Fez\u00e2ri, Kh\u00e2lid son of 'Orfutah ez-Zuhrl, Mesr\u00fbq son of el-Ajd\u00e2' el-Hamd\u00e2ni, and H\u00e2ni' son of 'Orweh el-Mur\u00e2di.)\nLebid was then in the mosque, having in his hand a hooked stick; \"and I said to him\" (says the messenger) \"'O Ab\u00fb 'Aq\u00eel! thy brothers send thee greeting and ask thee to tell them who is the best poet of the Arabs.' He answered\u2014'The Wandering King, the Man of the Ulcers.' And they sent me back to him to ask who was the Man of the Ulcers: he replied 'Imra' el-Qeys.' Then they sent me again to him to ask 'Who next?' He answered 'The Boy of Eighteen Years.' They bade me ask him whom he meant: he replied 'Tarafeh.' Then they sent me a third time to ask\u2014'And who then?' he said\u2014'The Man of the Hooked Staff, where he says\u2014\n\n\"Verily fear of our Lord is the best of spoils:\n\u2014it is by God's leave that I go late or soon;\nI give praise to God\u2014He has no like:\nin His hand is all good: what He wills He does.\nWhom He leads in the paths of good is guided aright\nwith a quiet heart: whom He wills He leads astray.\"\n\nmeaning himself: then he said 'I ask pardon of God!'\n\nAhmed ibn 'Abd-el-'Aziz [el-Jauhari] informed me that 'Omar ibn Shebbeh had told him that he had heard from Ab\u00fb 'Obeydeh that Lebid composed only one verse after he became a Muslim, namely:\n\n\"Praise be to God that my end came not to me\nuntil I clad myself in the robe of el-Isl\u00e2m.\"\n\nThe same Ahmed states that he was told by his uncle, who heard it from Mohammed ibn 'Abh\u00e2d ibn \u1e24\u00e2bib el-Muhellebt, who was told by Na\u1e63r ibn Da'b, who had it from D\u00e2\u016bd son of Ab\u00fb Hind, who learned it from esh-Sha'b\u00ee, that 'Omar ibn el-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e2b wrote to el-Mughireh son of Sho'beh, who was governor of el-K\u00fbfeh, bidding him cause the poets of his government to recite before him the poems they had composed under el-Isl\u00e2m. And he sent for el-Aghleb the R\u00e2j\u00eez, el-'Ijli, and said to him \"Recite to me thy verses.\" And he answered\u2014\n\n\"Dost thou wish for an epigram or an ode?\nVerily thy request is easy to satisfy at once!\"\n\nThen he sent for Lebid and bade him recite. And Lebid said\u2014\"Dost thou desire aught of what has been wrapped in forgetfulness?\"\u2014meaning his verses of the days of the Ignorance. \"No,\" said el-Mughireh, \"recite to me that which thou hast composed under el-Isl\u00e2m.\" And Lebid left him, and went and wrote out on a sheet of paper the Chapter of the Cow, and returning with it said\u2014\"God has given me this in exchange for poesy since I became a Muslim.\" And el-Mughireh wrote all this to 'Omar; and the Khalifeh diminished the stipend of el-Aghleb by five hundred pieces of silver, and added them to that of Lebid, which thus amounted to two thousand five hundred dirhems. And el-Aghleb wrote to the Prince of the Believers, saying\u2014\"Dost thou diminish my allowance because I obeyed\nAnd 'Omar returned to him the five hundred dirhems, but left the stipend of Lebid at two thousand five hundred. Ab\u00fb Zeyd relates that Mo'\u00e2wiyeh when he became Khalifeh desired to retrench the odd five hundred from the allowance: for he said\u2014\"The two posts\" (meaning the two thousands) \"are well enough: but what need is there for the cross-piece?\" (meaning the five hundred). And Lebid replied to him\u2014\"I am but an owl* of to-day or to-morrow: return to me the name of it: for perchance I shall never touch the thing itself, and thou wilt save both the cross-piece and the two posts.\" And Mo'\u00e2wiyeh's heart was touched, and he left him his stipend undiminished; but Lebid died before he could receive it.\n\n'Omar ibn Shebbeh relates in the traditions which he gathered from 'Abdall\u00e2h ibn Mohammed ibn Hak\u00eem, and I have been told by Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem ibn Ayy\u00fbb, who had it from 'Abdall\u00e2h ibn Muslim, that Lebid was one of the most generous of the Arabs; he had sworn in the days of the Ignorance that the East wind should never blow without his giving a feast to the poor. And he had two great bowls which he used to fill with meat morning and evening at the place of prayer of his people, and feed men out of them. And one day the East wind blew when el-Wel\u00eed son of 'Oqbeh* was governor of el-K\u00fbfeh. And el-Wel\u00eed mounted the pulpit and pronounced the Khutbeh before the people; then he said\u2014\"Your brother Lebid son of R\u00e2bi'ah made a vow in the days of the Ignorance that whenever the East wind blew he would feed those in need. Now this is one of the days of its blowing: help him therefore. As for me, I will set you the example.\" Then he came down from the pulpit, and sent to Lebid a hundred young she-camels, and wrote to him these verses\u2014*\n\n\"I see the butcher sharpening his two knives\nwhen the breezes of Ab\u00fb 'Aq\u00eel are blowing:\nHigh-nosed is he, high-headed, a man of '\u00c2mir\u2014\nlong are his arms even as a polished blade.\nThe son of the Ja'fari fulfilled his oaths,\nin spite of infirmities and slender store,\nBy slaughtering large-humped camels when there swept by\nthe skirts of the East wind blowing at eventide.\"\n\nWhen Lebid received these verses, he said to his daughter\u2014\"Answer him: for by my life! I have lived a long time, and am too weary to reply to a poet.\" So his daughter composed these lines\u2014*\n\n\"When there blow the breezes of Ab\u00fb 'Aq\u00eel\nat their blowing we call for help to el-Wel\u00eed;\nHigh-nosed is he, keen-hearted, of '\u00c2bd-Shems's line:\nhe has holpen in his generosity Lebid\nBy the gift of camels like hills, as though a company\nof the sons of Ham were riding on their backs.\"\nO Ab\u00fb Wahb, may God requite thee with good!\nwe have slaughtered them: now give us to eat the ther\u00e2d!\nRenew thy gifts! verily the generous man gives again and again,\nand my assurance is that thou wilt certainly give again.\"\n\nAnd Lebid said to her\u2014\"Thou wouldst have done very well indeed if\nthou hadst only not asked him to give thee more to eat.\" She said\u2014\"Nay,\nbut kings never count it a shame that men should ask of them.\" He an-\nswered\u2014\"Verily, O my little daughter, in this thou art most of all a poet!\"\n\nAhmed ibn 'Abd-el-'Az\u00eez informed me that he had been told by 'Omar\nibn Shebbeh, who heard it from Mohammed ibn 'Imr\u00e2n ed-Dabb\u00ee, who was\ntold by el-Q\u00e2sim ibn Ya'la, who had it from el-Mufaddal ed-Dabb\u00ee, that\nel-Farezdaq one day chanced to pass by the mosque of the Ben\u00fb Uqey\u015fir,\nwhere there was a man who was reciting some verses of Lebid's among which\nwas the following\u2014\n\n\"The torrents have scored afresh the traces of the tents, as though\nthey were lines of writing in a book which the pens make new\nagain.\"\n\nAnd el-Farezdaq prostrated himself. And they asked him\u2014\"What is\nthis, O Ab\u00fb Fir\u00e2s?\" he answered, \"Ye know the prostration which is the\ndue of the Qur'\u00e2n, and I know the prostration which is the due of song.\"\n\nIsm\u00e2'il ibn Y\u00fbnus the Shi'\u00ee states that he heard from 'Omar ibn Sheb-\nbeh, who had it from Ibn-el-Baww\u00e2b, that the Khalifeh el-Mo'tas\u00eem one\nday was sitting at a wine-party, when one of the singers sang\u2014\n\n\"The sons of el-'Abb\u00e2s know not how to say no:\nYes rises lightly to their tongues;\nTheir mildness adds lustre to their noble strain\u2014\nthus is mildness the ornament of generosity.\"\n\nEl-Mo'tas\u00eem said\u2014\"I do not know these verses\u2014whose are they?\"\nThey said \"Lebid's.\" \"Why,\" said the Khalifeh, \"what had Lebid to do\nwith the sons of el-'Abb\u00e2s?\" The singer replied\u2014\"What Lebid said was\u2014\n'The sons of er-Rayy\u00e2n know not how to say no.'\nIt is I that put el-'Abb\u00e2s in place of er-Rayy\u00e2n.\" And el-Mo'tas\u00eem praised\nand rewarded him. Then the Khalifeh, who had a great admiration for the\npoems of Lebid, said\u2014\"Who among you can recite his poem beginning\u2014\n'We wither away: but they wane not, the stars that rise on high'?\"\nAnd one of those that sat with him said \"I.\" He said \"Recite it to me.\"\nAnd he began\u2014\"\n\n\"We wither away: but they wane not, the stars that rise on high,\nand the hills endure, and the mighty towers, though we be gone.\nI dwelt under the shade of a house that all men sought,\nand there has left me in Arbed a neighbour that helped me well.\"\nAnd el-Mo\u1e6da\u1e63\u1e63im burst into a flood of tears, and invoked God's mercy upon el-M\u0101m\u016bn\u2014\"For such a brother,\" said he, \"was he to me.\" Then he went on, reciting the rest of the poem himself\u2014\n\n\"Nay, wail not, if the Days have sundered him from me\u2014\nOne day the stroke of Time shall fall upon all of us!\nThe race of men is nought else than a tent-place and its folk\u2014\nthe day that they leave it void, it returns to its loneliness.\nThey pass forth from it in bands, and it remains after them\neven as an empty palm with the fingers folded thereon.\nAnd what is man but a kindled brand whereof the glow\nsinks into ashes when once its blaze has spent itself?\nAnd what is man but hidden thoughts of good intent?\nAnd what is wealth but a loan, a trust to be given back?\nLies there not before me, even though death should be slow to come,\nthe comradeship of the staff over which my fingers close?\nI tell tales of the ages that have long passed away;\nI totter along\u2014when I rise, my body is bent in twain;\nI am become like a sword that has worn out its sheath\u2014\nfar away are the days of its forger, but still its point is keen.\n'O go not away from us!'

Then said el-Welid, \"I call you to witness that I am quit of him.\" The teller of the tale goes on to say that there were sitting there a company of the Qureysh to whom Lebid son of Rab\u00ee'ah was reciting his verses; and 'Othm\u00e2n went and sat down with the people. And Lebid said\u2014\n\n\"Yea, everything is vain except only God alone!\"\n\nAnd 'Othm\u00e2n said to him\u2014\"Thou speakest truth.\" And Lebid continued\u2014\n\n\"And every pleasant thing must one day vanish away.\"\n\nAnd 'Othm\u00e2n said\u2014\"Thou liest!\" And the people knew not what he meant; and one of them signed to Lebid to repeat the verse again, and he did so; and 'Othm\u00e2n again said that he spoke truth in the first half-verse, and lied in the second: for the delights of Paradise shall never vanish away. And Lebid cried\u2014\"O ye people of the Qureysh! there used to be no such man as this in your assemblies!\" And Ubayy son of Khalaf (others say, his son) rose and smote 'Othm\u00e2n on the face; and some one said to 'Othm\u00e2n\u2014\n\n\"But yesternight thou wast safe from treatment like this.\" He replied\u2014\"How needful is it for this sound eye of mine that there should befall it what befell the other for the sake of God!\"\n\nMohammed ibn Khalaf ibn el-Marzub\u00e2n told me that he had heard from Ahmed ibn el-Heythem, who was told by el-'Omari, who learned it from el-Heythem ibn 'Ad\u00ee, who had it from 'Abdall\u00e2h ibn 'Ayy\u00e2sh, that [the Khalifeh] 'Abd-el-Melik wrote to el-Hajj\u00e2j bidding him send to him esh-Sha'bi, and he sent him. And the Khalifeh attached him to his sons, and bade him educate and instruct them. Ibn 'Ayy\u00e2sh continues\u2014\"He invited me one day to visit him during the illness of which he died: and he choked with a morsel of food while I was with him. And he rested himself for a long time: then he said\u2014'I have become as the poet says\u2014\n\n\"I am as though, now that I have over-passed seventy years,\n\nI had stripped my shoulders bare to meet the stroke of Fate.\"\n\nBut he lived till he reached a hundred and ten, when he said\u2014\n\n\"Is there no life left for a man after that he has lived\n\na hundred years, and after that yet ten years more?\"\n\nStill he lived on till he reached a hundred and twenty, when he said\u2014\n\n\"Verily I am aweary of life and its length\n\nand of hearing men ask 'How goes Lebd?'\n\nMen are overborne, but he stands still unconquered\n\nby Time, the new, the everlasting dreary length;\"\nI see the day come upon me and the night,\nand each of them after its passing returns again.\"\n\nAnd he was glad and congratulated himself, and said 'I do not think there is any fear for me: already I feel much relieved.' And he bade them give me four thousand dirhems; and I received them and was going out, but had not reached the door when I heard the cry of the wailing woman who proclaimed that he was dead.\"\n\nEl-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali informed me that he had been told by Mohammed ibn el-Q\u00e2sim ibn Mahraweyh, who heard it from H\u00e2r\u00fbn ibn Muslim, who was told by el-\u2018Omari, who learned it from el-Heythem ibn \u2018Ad\u00ee, who had it from Hamm\u00e2d er-R\u00e2wiyeh, that en-N\u00e2bighah e\u1e0d-\u1e0cuby\u00e2ni looked upon Lebid son of Rabi\u2018ah when he was a boy with his uncles at the gate of the palace of en-No\u2019m\u00e2n son of el-Mun\u1e0d\u00eer, and asked who he was; and his genealogy was repeated to him. Then en-N\u00e2bighah said to him\u2014\"Boy, thine eyes are assuredly the eyes of a poet! Dost thou ever compose verses?\" \"Yes, O my uncle,\" answered Lebid. \"Recite then to me something of thy composition,\" said en-N\u00e2bighah. And he recited to him his poem beginning\u2014\n\n\"Abode she not in Spring in this desolate camping-ground?\"\n\nAnd en-N\u00e2bighah said\u2014\"Boy, thou art the best poet of the Ben\u00fb \u2018\u00c2mir! More, O my son!\" Then Lebid recited\u2014\n\n\"There are traces of Khauleh in er-Rasis, but of long ago.\"\n\nAnd en-N\u00e2bighah smote his sides with his hands and cried\u2014\"Go! thou art the best poet of all Qeys!\" (others say he said \"of all Haw\u00e2zin\"). This story was however told me differently by my uncle, who heard it from el-\u2018Omari, who had it from Laq\u00eet, who heard it from his father and from Hamm\u00e2d er-R\u00e2wiyeh, who learned it from \u2018Abdall\u00e2h ibn Q\u00e2t\u00e2deh el-Moh\u00e2rib\u00ee, who said that he was himself standing with en-N\u00e2bighah at the gate of en-No\u2019m\u00e2n son of el-Mun\u1e0d\u00eer. \"En-N\u00e2bighah said to me\" (says \u2018Abdall\u00e2h) \"'Hast thou seen Lebid son of Rabi\u2018ah among those here present?' 'Yes,' said I. 'Who is the best poet of them?' said he. 'The young man whom thou hast seen do thus and thus,' said I, describing him. Then he said\u2014'Sit by me until he comes forth to us'; so we sat down, and when Lebid came out to us, en-N\u00e2bighah called to him\u2014'Come hither, son of my brother!' and he came up: and en-N\u00e2bighah bade him recite some of his verses, and he recited\u2014\n\n'Hast thou not drawn nigh to the desolate camping-ground\nof Selma in el-Med\u00e2\u2019ib and el-Qaf\u00e2l?'\n\nAnd en-N\u00e2bighah said to him\u2014'Thou art the best poet of the Ben\u00fb \u2018\u00c2mir! More!' and he went on\u2014\n\n\"There are traces of Khauleh in er-Resis, but of long ago,\n\u2014in Ma\u2018\u00e2q\u00eel, and el-An\u2018am\u00e2n, and Sh\u00fbm.\"\nAnd en-N\u00e2bighah cried\u2014'Thou art the best poet of Haw\u00e2zin! More still!' and he continued\u2014\n\n'Effaced are her resting places, where she stayed but a while and where she dwelt long,\nin Mina: desolate are her camps in Ghaul and er-Rij\u00e2m.'\n\nAnd en-N\u00e2bighah said\u2014'Go thy ways! thou art the best poet of the Arabs!'\n\nAhmed ibn 'Abd-el-'Aziz told me that he had heard from 'Omar ibn Shebbeh, who was told by 'Abdallah ibn Mohammed ibn Hakim, who learned it from Kh\u00e2lid ibn Sa'id, that Lebt\u00eed, when his end was approaching, said to his brother's son (for he had himself no male issue)\"\u2014\"O my son! verily thy father is not dead, he has but passed away. When thy father is taken, place his body with its face to the Qibleh, and wrap it in its raiment; and raise no loud wailing over it; but see these two bowls of mine wherefrom I used to feed the poor: fill them with meat and carry them to the mosque; and when the im\u00e2m has pronounced the sel\u00e2m,\" bring them forward for men to eat therefrom; and when they have eaten, say to them\u2014'Come ye to the funeral of your brother.' Then he recited his verses\u2014\n\n\"When thou buryest thy father, lay\nover him wooden planks and clay\u2014\nBroad flags of stone, hard, firm-set,\nthat shall stop the chinks of the branches\" strewn\nAbove him, and keep his cheeks unstained\nby the dust of earth\u2014But they will not keep them!\"\n\nKh\u00e2lid ibn Sa'id says that these verses are taken from a long ode; and Y\u00fbnus has mentioned that Ibn Sureyj set to music certain verses of the same poem: but he does not state more particularly the air to which they were set. The following are the verses he gives:\"\u2014\n\n\"O my little son, hast thou seen my uncles,\nthe sons of the 'Mother of the Sons'?\nAnd my father round whom the wretched ones\nflocked in the bitter winter days:\nAnd Ab\u00fb Shureyk and the alightings\nin the place of straitness where we met them?\nNever have I seen or heard of\nthe like of them in all the world!\nAnd I have out-lasting them all, and yearn\nclinging to the fellowship I had with them.\nLeave me and what my right hand owns,\nif therewith I have done aught to strengthen men,\nAnd do with what is thine as it comes into\nthy mind, giving help asked or unasked.\"\nKh\u00e2lid adds that he said to his two daughters when death was upon him\u2014\n\n\"They wish, my two girls, that their father should live for ever:\n\u2014Am I aught else than a son of Rabi\u2018ah or Mudar?\nAnd if it should hap one day that your father come to die,\nrend not your cheeks, ye twain, shear not your hair for me!\nBut say\u2014' He was a man who never wronged an ally,\nwho never betrayed a friend, or did aught of treachery'\nUntil the year is done: then the name of peace be on you!\nfor he who weeps for a year has discharged what is due from him.\"\n\nAnd after his death his daughters used to array themselves and go every day to the meeting-place of the Ben\u00fb Ja\u2018far ibn Kil\u00e2b, and mourn there for their father; but they did not weep or wail, even as he had bidden them. And they continued thus for a year, and then went their ways.\n\nIn vol. XV of the Agh\u00e2ni (pp. 137 sqq.) the story of the death of Lebid\u2019s uterine brother Arbed (son of Qeys, son of Jez\u2019, son of Kh\u00e2lid, son of Ja\u2018far, son of Kil\u00e2b), who was slain by a lightning-stroke, is told at great length. Two different versions of the tale are given, according to the first of which (extracted from the history of Mohammed ibn Jerir et-Tabari, and resting on the authority of \u2018Amar ibn Qat\u00e2deh) the circumstances were the following. A deputation of the Ben\u00fb \u2018\u00c2mir ibn \u0160a\u2018sa\u2018ah, headed by \u2018\u00c2mir ibn et-Tufeyl, Arbed ibn Qeys, and Hayy\u00e2n ibn Sulma, waited upon the Prophet. \u2018\u00c2mir had arranged with Arbed that he should occupy the attention of Mohammed by conversation, while Arbed slew him when he was off his guard. This project failed, Arbed excusing himself for not attacking the Prophet by saying that \u2018\u00c2mir stood between him and Mohammed, and he could not smite the latter without striking the former. On their return \u2018\u00c2mir fell sick of a carbuncle on his neck, and died in the tent of a woman of the Ben\u00fb Sal\u00fbl. Arbed when he reached his home was asked what had befallen between him and Mohammed: he replied \u201cHe invited us to worship a thing which I should like to see before me now: I would shoot it with this arrow and slay it.\u201d And a day or two after this speech he went out with a camel which he intended to sell, and was killed together with his camel by a lightning-stroke.\n\nThe other version is extracted from the book of Yahya ibn H\u00e1zim, and rests on the authority of Ibn Da\u2019b. According to it, Lebid\u2019s uncle \u2018\u00c2mir ibn M\u00e2lik Ab\u00fb Bera\u2019, being sick of an internal tumour, sent Lebid with a present of camels to Mohammed, begging him to pray for his recovery. The Prophet said\u2014\"If I accepted anything from a polytheist, I would accept the present of Ab\u00fb Bera\u2019\"; then he spat upon a lump of clay and gave it to Lebid, bidding him dissolve it in water and give it to \u2018\u00c2mir to\ndrink, when he would be healed of his disease. Lebid on this occasion stayed some time with Mohammed and heard the Qur'\u00e2n, and while there copied out on a sheet of paper these words\u2014\u201cer-Rahm\u00e2nu 'allama-l-Qur'\u00e2n\u201d [\u201cGod the Merciful has taught men the Qur'\u00e2n\u201d] and carried them home with him. \u2018\u00c2mir recovered as the Prophet had said; but Arbed, whom Lebid met on the way home and told of Mohammed's noble bearing and holiness, and to whom he read the words he had written, impiously replied\u2014\u201cWould that I might meet er-Rahm\u00e2n in this waste\u2014my blood be upon me if I smote him not with my sword!\u201d And shortly afterwards, going out in the night to search for his camels, he was struck dead by lightning in the place where he had spoken these words. Of these two stories the first is to be preferred, as most in accordance with the other known facts of Lebid's life, and with the tenor of the marthiyehs or dirges which he uttered over Arbed. Several of these have been preserved; one has already been given: the following few lines are to be found in the Ham\u00e2seh, and the Agh\u00e2ni tells us (p. 140) that they were quoted by the first Khalifeh Ab\u00fb Bekr and applied by him to the Prophet\u2014\n\n\u201cBy my life! verily if the messenger spoke true,\na grievous stroke has fallen on Ja'far from the hand of Fate!\nA brother was he that gave me aught that I asked of him\nfreely, and pardoned all the wrong that I did to him!\u201d\n\nNotes to the Notice of Lebid.\n\n1 The second hemistich of this couplet offers some difficulty. De Sacy reads\n\n\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u062c\u0645\u0639\n\nand renders \u201ctandis que la ligne enti\u00e8re de l'escadron avoit \u00e9t\u00e9 enfonc\u00e9e et avoit c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 leur violence.\u201d But the reading of the B\u00fbl\u00e2q edition of the Agh\u00e2ni is distinctly\n\n\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u062c\u0645\u0639\n\nand the use of \u062e\u0637 in the sense of \u0635\u0641 is of doubtful authority; while the rendering given above would require the line to begin with \u0648\u0642\u062f\u0647. The translation adopted follows the explanation of the phrase \u0631\u0627\u062d \u0644\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u0621 given by Lane, and understands the hemistich as meaning that the whole fortune of the war hung on the spear-points which \u2018\u00c2mir took to himself: he was the f\u00e2ris-el-jeysh\u2014\u201cthe knight of the host,\u201d a warrior such as \u2018Antarah draws for us in vv. 64 to 71 of his Mo'allaqah.\n\n2 Lebid was thus nearly connected with the king of Hawz\u00een, Zuheyr son of Je\u1e0d\u00eemeh, who was slain by Kh\u00e2lid son of Ja'far of \u2018\u00c2mir, Lebid's great uncle on the father's side; he was (through his mother) first cousin once removed of Qays son of Zuheyr, the leader of \u2018Abs in the war of D\u00e2his. It should be added that the text of the Agh\u00e2ni appears to make Zinb\u00ea'a woman, whereas the name is that of a man; we may perhaps understand \u201cone of the daughters of Je\u1e0d\u00eemeh\u201d as applying to T\u00e2mirah, and \u201cdaughters\u201d as meaning female descendants generally.\n\n* H\u00e2jara. De Sacy renders \u201cqu'il accompagna ensuite le Proph\u00e8te dans sa fuite \u00e0 M\u00e9dine.\u201d This, however, is impossible, for the death of \u2018\u00c2mir ibn et-Tufeyl occurred in A. H. 10.\n* Twenty. De Sacy line reads *tis'in* (ninety) for *ashrin* (twenty), which latter reading existed in his MS. as well as in the B\u016bl\u0101q edition; it does not seem necessary to do violence to the text.\n\n* It will not escape notice that this passage does not agree with the genealogy given at the head of the article, insomuch as it distinguishes between Lebid's uncle, 'Amir son of M\u0101lik, and 'Amir Abu-l-Bers' or Ab\u016b Niz\u0101r, Mula'ib-el-Asinneh. This story is told over again (with a different *ism\u0101d* but in almost the same language) at p. 22 of Vol. XVI of the Agh\u0101n\u012b; this does not appear to have been observed by De Sacy. The obscure passages in the text before us have in some cases light thrown upon them by variants in the second version.\n\n* Zaraj\u016bn: the second version gives the name as Sarah\u016bn.\n\n* This enmity was doubtless due to the slaying of Zuheyr son of Je\u1e0d\u012bmeh by Kh\u0101lid son of Ja\u02bffar.\n\n* In our text the words are \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0642\u0650\u0649 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650\u0633\u0652 \u0645\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0645\u0652. In the second version they are \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0642\u0650\u0649 \u0645\u064f\u0636\u0650\u0641\u0652. I have translated as if \u0645\u064f\u0636\u0650\u0641\u0652 stood in place of \u0645\u064f\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650\u0633\u0652.\n\n* In our text the words are \u062a\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0639\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064f. In the other text they are \u062a\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0639\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f; the latter is the more usual spelling of the name: *vide* Lane s. v. \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064f. The plant is variously described, and according to Lane the name is now applied to what is called in Persian *\u1e6d\u0101k*, i.e., *\u1e6d\u0101k\u1e63\u012b*. *\u1e6c\u0101k\u1e63\u012b*, an insignificant weed of the natural order Cruciferae, the well-known \"shepherd's purse,\" suits the passage well. (De Sacy's MS. appears to have read \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u062b\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f, which he renders \"de l'esp\u00e8ce qu'on nomme th\u00e9riyya, c'est \u00e0 dire, humide\"; the word meaning *moist* is, however, \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064f, fem. \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064f without tashdid.)\n\n* This speech of Lebid's, which naturally loses its chief flavour in a translation, is in rhyming prose, each rhyme being three times repeated. The speech is given with slight variations, but substantially the same in sense, in the notice of er-Rab\u012b\u02bf in Vol. XVI.\n\n* \"Top-knot\", \u1e62u\u02bf\u0101betu\u1e25: here it is in the singular, and therefore means either the top-knot or forelock: in the other version the word is in the dual, and means the two curls, one on each side of the head, commonly worn by boys.\n\n* Hulleh is the name of a dress consisting of three garments, a shirt, an \u02bfid\u0101r or waist wrapper, and a ridd\u0101 or wrapper for the whole body.\n\n* This address is in the Rejes metre: each line rhymes with all the rest. In line 3 \"The Mother of the Four sons\" is the wife of M\u0101lik ibn Ja\u02bffar: she had really five sons, viz., 'Amir, Tufeyl, Rab\u012b\u02bfah, 'Abideh and Mo\u02bfawiyeh. Ibn Quteybeh thinks (Ma\u02bf\u0101rif, ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, p. 43) that the poet has put four instead of five merely for the sake of the rhyme: it may be, however, because four only were famous among the five. Umm-ei-banin \"Mother of the Sons\" was an honoured title which was borne by many Arab mothers; er-Rab\u012b\u02bf's own mother Fa\u1e6d\u012bmeh was known by it: her sons were called ei-kemel\u0113h, \"the perfect.\" The last four lines of the piece cannot be decently rendered into English, but they will be found in De Sacy's French. Lebid charges er-Rab\u012b\u02bf with being afflicted by the white leprosy called b\u0101re\u1e63, and puts the charge in a manner calculated to cause extreme disgust in the King. In the notice of er-Rab\u012b\u02bf in Vol. XVI, the piece has two more lines, making fourteen in all, beside other minor variations.\n\n* \"Wrote.\" That er-Rab\u012b\u02bf knew how to write is proved by the fact that he, with all the other sons of Fa\u1e6d\u012bmeh daughter of el-Khurshub, was called K\u0101mil, \"perfect,\" which in the days of the Ignorance meant \"a man who was a poet, valiant,\"\nable to write, a skilful swimmer and a good shot with the bow.\" (Quoted from the Kit\u0101b el-Agh\u0101n\u012b by Causs. de Perceval, Journal Asiat. Dec. 1836, p. 533.)\n\nThese verses present many points of difficulty: they occur again in Vol. XVI, pp. 23, 24, and the readings there given differ in some particulars from those given here. In line 1, De Sacy reads, for the reading of his MS. and the B\u016bl\u0101q ed., \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0644\u064a \u0633\u0645\u0639\u0629\u060c but this will not scan, while the reading of the text seems to be nonsense. I have preferred the reading of Vol. XVI, p. 23, viz., \u0623\u0646 \u0644\u064a \u0633\u0645\u0639\u0629. In line 3 Lakhm is the family name of the kings of el-Hirreh. \"Come down\" i.e. to water\u2014waradet: Vol. XVI, p. 24 reads wuzinet \"were weighed.\" In line 4 there seems to be a play on the word rish, which means both wealth and feathers. Semwil is here given with sin: in Vol. XVI, it appears as Shemwil with shin. In both places the B\u016bl\u0101q ed. reads rishi Semwil; but De Sacy gives ibni Shemwil, and translates \"fils de Samuel,\" i.e. the famous es-Semau'al of el-Ablaq in Teyma. It is true that in the reply of en-No'm\u0101n, as given in Vol. XIV, line 6 speaks of ibni Semwil\u0101: but in Vol. XVI, the reading is abr\u0101qa Shemwil\u0101. I find in the Mar\u0101sid a place Semwil, of which all that is said is that it is \"a place abounding in birds.\" This seems to suit the passage best; at any rate the change of es-Semau'al to Shemwil requires strong support before it can be accepted.\n\nIn line 7, De Sacy's should be changed to ; his conjectured reading \u062d\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u0631 for the meaningless \u0627\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u0631 is supported by the version of Vol. XVI, and has been adopted. In v. 8 a word occurs which is found in no dictionary, viz., \u063a\u0634\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0647 (Agh. Vol. XIV,) or \u063a\u0634\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0647 (id. Vol. XVI,) or \u063a\u0634\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0647 (De Sacy). De Sacy renders \u063a\u0634\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0647 \"elles ne sont pas, comme chez vous, r\u00e9duites \u00e0 manger des herbes saum\u00e2tres ou nitreuses.\" But salt pastures are just those which camels like: and it seems possible that \u063a\u0634\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0647 may be connected with \u0639\u0633\u0644 honey.\n\nThese verses, like those of er-Rab\u012b' just quoted, shew variations in the different versions. The second couplet as I have rendered it runs\n\n\u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0630\u064f\u0643\u0650\u0631\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0634\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064d \u0644\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0634\u0650\u0626\u064b\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0635\u0631\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0645\u0650 \u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0629\u0650\n\n(The Bulaq ed. reads \u062c\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062a apparently only by a misprint. De Sacy prefers to make \u062c\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062a the nom. to \u0645\u0635\u0631 and \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0629 the accusative after it, and this rendering has much to recommend it). But in Vol. XVI the verse appears thus\n\n\u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u0630\u064f\u0643\u0650\u0631\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0634\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0621\u064d \u0644\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0634\u0650\u0626\u064b\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0635\u0631\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0645\u0650 \u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0629\u0650\n\nto the second hemistich of which it is difficult to assign a meaning.\n\nThe third couplet runs in our text thus\u2014\n\n\u0641\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062c\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0637\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0648\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064d\n\nIn Vol. XVI, it runs\n\n\u0641\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062c\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0637\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064f \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064d\n\nNow if we take Semwil as the name of a place, \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064d is obviously inappropriate. I have therefore adopted, in lieu of \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0648\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064d from the other version. Abr\u0101q is not given in Lane: but it seems a permissible plural from \u0628\u0631\u0642 plural of \u0628\u0631\u0642\u0629, a rugged and gravelly plain. \u062c\u0632\u0639\u0647 in the sense of traversing and passing through (Zuheyr, Mo'all. 15), also suits abraq in this meaning best. (Of the reading of Vol.\ngenerally it may be said that \u062e\u0631\u0645 appears to make nonsense, and that while \u0634\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0644 is a word meaning \"light and active\" applied to a camel, it does not seem appropriate here.\n\nThese verses have not been rendered by De Sacy, and we should be glad to know that they were really spurious and not by Lebid. Verses 4 and 5 accuse er-Rabi' of cowardice, and say that in the press of battle he is like a thing held there by force, and would be glad to escape if he could. In verse 6 he is charged with merely sipping a sip and tasting of the fight \u062d\u0627\u0633 \u062d\u0633\u0648\u0629 \u0648\u0630\u0644\u06cc\u0642. In verses 7 and 8 the meaning is that if the man who stands next to er-Rabi' in the press and takes him for a bulwark (who to do so must needs be a coward himself) feels him, as one feels a sheep to see if it is fat \u063a\u0646\u0645), he will find that he is lighter and leaner, i.e. more cowardly and chicken-hearted than himself. In the last line is a word, \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642, which is explained in the commentary on the authority of el-A\u1e63ma'i as meaning the action of a beast whose legs are hobbled or shackled, or one walking among thorns: he sets down his forelegs, then he raises them and in the place where they had been puts his hind legs. So here the sense is that er-Rabi' having committed a villainy, returns to the same again.\n\nEl-Welid son of 'Oqbeh. His grandfather was Ab\u016b Mo'eyt son of Ab\u016b 'Amr son of Umayyah son of 'Abd Shems; he became a Muslim at the conquest of Mekkeh (A.H. 8), and was sent by the Prophet to collect the Sadagah or poor-rate from the Bennu-l-Mu\u1e63\u1e6dalaq; having returned with a false report that they had refused to pay it to him, the Prophet ordered arms to be taken up against them: whereupon there was sent down from God this warning verse (Qur. xlix. 6) \"O ye that have believed! verily there has come to you a wicked man with news: act therefore with deliberation.\" 'Omar appointed el-Welid to be collector of the Sadagah from the tribe of Teglib, and 'Othm\u0101n made him governor of el-K\u016bfeh in succession to Sa'd son of Ab\u016b Waqq\u0101s. One day he was leading the prayers in the great mosque of el-K\u016bfeh, and being drunk, after he had finished turned to the people and said \"Shall I give you any more?\" This greatly scandalized them, and they reported to 'Othm\u0101n his drunken habits. The Khalifeh thereupon removed him from his post and inflicted upon him the legal punishment (had\u0101) for drunkenness, viz., eighty stripes. After this he remained in el-Med\u012bneh until 'Al\u012b was proclaimed Khalifeh, when he withdrew to er-Raqqah, a town on the upper Euphrates, where he lived till his death, taking part with neither side in the contest between 'Al\u012b and Mo'\u0101wiya. El-Welid was the uterine brother of the Khalifeh 'Othm\u0101n. (Ibn Quteybeh, Ma'\u0101rif, pp. 162-3).\n\nGhan\u012b: the tribe of \u0100mir ibn \u0160a'sa'ah to which Lebid belonged descended (as will be seen from the genealogy with which the notice begins) from Qeys son of 'Eyl\u0101n through his son Khasafeh. Ghan\u012b was the offspring of another son of Qeys (or, as others say, his grandson), A'sur. The tribe of Ghan\u012b was bound by the ties of mutual protection (g\u012bw\u0101r) to \u0100mir, and a man of Ghan\u012b having slain Sha's son of Zuheyr the king of Haw\u0101zin, Kh\u0101lid, Lebid's great uncle (see above, note 9) offered to bear the bloodwit: on Zuheyr refusing to accept anything but the destruction of the offending tribe, Kh\u0101lid slew him; and this produced an enmity between \u0100mir and 'Abs which was not appeased till many years after on the outbreak of the war of D\u0101his.\n\nIn rendering this poem I have ventured, with great diffidence, to take it in a sense exactly opposite to that adopted by De Sacy. He imagines that the words of \u1e6cufeyl are directed against Ja'far: and he renders the word in line 3 which I translate \"to be weary of us,\" \u064a\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0646\u0627, \"venir \u00e0 notre secours,\" observing however in a note that he would have preferred to read \u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u0631\u0646. This other reading would, however,\nbe impossible with \u0644\u0647\u062a at the end of the verse; and also means \"he contracted a loathing of him, he became tired of his society\": never, as assumed, \"he grieved for him, showed him sympathy.\" In the next two verses De Sacy takes the subject to be Tufeyl's mother, while it appears to me to be the tribe of Ja'far. Now it is to be remembered that the story is told as a case of Lebid's boasting of his former state after he had become a Muslim. Ja'far was Lebid's own family: it is therefore improbable that the verses should be to the discredit of Ja'far; and the whole tenor of the tale and its sequel shews that Tufeyl must be praising Ja'far for some good deeds done him which seemed to the young man of Ghant, who was accustomed to the orderly administration and public charity which existed under el-Islam, to be a very trifling thing. It appears to me conclusive that, after reciting the verses, the Ghanawi says \u0644\u06cc\u062a \u0634\u0639\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0631\u0623\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u0649 \u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0645. Had the tale been against the house of Ja'far, the phrase would have run \u062d\u064a\u062b \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645. At the same time I should add that it is not impossible that lines 5 to 8 may refer to Tufeyl's mother; a collective family name like Ja'far is frequently construed with a feminine singular: but just before, by a constructio ad sensum, it has been construed with a masculine plural, \u064a\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0646; it may seem unlikely that from the natural constructio ad sensum the phrase should revert to the grammatical regimen of the feminine singular, though instances are not wanting. If this be so, then, taking lines 6 to 8 as praise of Tufeyl's mother, reading in line 6 her for their, and in line 7 she for they, the result of the passage will be that while the hospitality of Tufeyl's mother is related, that of the Ja'faris is declared to be still more excellent.\n\n\"Eighteen years.\" Tarafeh is said to have been six and twenty when he was killed: this earlier age may perhaps refer to the time when he attained distinction as a poet.\n\nEl-Mughireh son of Sho'beh: he was of the tribe of Thaqif, and nephew of the martyr 'Orwah ibn Me'sud; he was a distinguished warrior, and was present at the battles of el-Yemameh (when Museylimeh \"the Liar\" was slain), el-Yarmuk (in A.H. 13, when he lost an eye), el-Qadisiyyeh (A.H. 15), Meysan, and Nuhawend (where he led the right wing), besides many others. According to Ibn Quteybeh (Ma'arif, p. 150) he was made governor of el-Basrah, not el-Kufah, by 'Omar; and Ibn Khallikan (De Slane's translation, Vol. IV, pp. 255-258) tells a tale, equally discreditable to 'Omar and el-Mughireh, of the manner in which the former screened the latter from the punishment due to him on account of a true charge of adultery brought against him during his rule at el-Basrah. It seems therefore doubtful whether this anecdote, which makes him governor of el-Kufah during 'Omar's reign, can be genuine. I find however that in the index to Freytag's edition of el-Meydani's proverbs he is said to have been made governor of el-Kufah first by 'Omar and afterwards by Mo'awiyeh; of the latter fact there is no doubt; he died at el-Kufah in A.H. 50 of the plague. Ibn Quteybeh mentions (Ma'arif, p. 276) that he was the first Muslim who took bribes. This story is twice told in the Aghani: it recurs in Vol. XVIII, p. 164, in the notice of el-Aghleb. This poet, who belonged to the tribe of 'Ijl, a sub-tribe of Bekr ibn Wa'il, was called \"the Edjiz,\" or reciter of verses in the rejaz metre, because he was the first who used that metre for qasidahs, or long odes; \"before his time\" (says Ibn Hafib, quoted by el-Isfahani) \"the Arabs used the rejaz only in war, in driving camels, in boasting one against another, and on other like occasions, and each poem consisted only of a few couplets. El-Aghleb was the first who used it for a qasidah, and after him other men followed in the way he had shewn them.\" El-Aghleb, like Lebid, was very old when\nhe professed el-Isl\u0101m; he left his tribe and settled in el-K\u016bfah with Sa\u2019d son of Ab\u016b Waqq\u0101s, and was present at the battle of Nuh\u0101wond (A. H. 21), where he was among the slain.\n\nThe second, or, if we omit the F\u0101ti\u1e25ah from our reckoning, the first S\u016brah of the Qur\u2019\u0101n.\n\nThat is \u201cI shall be but a ghost (h\u0101meh) to-day or to-morrow.\u201d It is remarkable that this speech, savouring of the superstitions of the Ignorance, when men spoke of the spirits of dead men as owls, should be put into the mouth of so pious a Muslim as Lebtid, especially after the Prophet had specifically denied the existence of the h\u0101meh as of other things regarded with superstitious awe. (See Mest\u2018\u016bd\u012b, Mur\u016bj-e-\u1e0d-\u1e0cahab, Vol. III, p. 311). But it will be seen from a discussion elsewhere that this particular superstition (or at least language having reference to it) was by no means eradicated by el-Isl\u0101m, and that h\u0101meh was used generally to indicate a dead person even by Muslims.\n\nThese words (\u201cI am but an owl of to-day or to-morrow\u201d) are given as a proverb in el-Meyd\u0101n\u012b (Freytag\u2019s edn., Vol. II, p. 885) and a history added which connects them with Lebtid\u2019s own tribe of \u2018\u0100mir. Shuteyr ibn Kh\u0101lid ibn Nufayl was taken prisoner by Dir\u0101r son of \u2018Amr of Dabbeh, who said to him\u2014\u201cChoose one of three things: first, restore to me my son el-Hoseyn, whom thy son \u2018Otbeh has slain.\u201d \u201cI cannot raise up the dead to life,\u201d said Shuteyr. \u201cThen give up to me thine own son to be slain in his place,\u201d said Dir\u0101r. \u201cNay,\u201d replied Shuteyr, \u201cthe Ben\u016b \u2018\u0100mir would never agree to surrender a knight valiant in battle for a one-eyed dotard who is but an owl of to-day or to-morrow.\u201d \u201cThen thou must die,\u201d said Dir\u0101r, and bade his son slay him.\n\nFor el-Welid see note (18).\n\nThese verses are sufficiently clear. De Sacy supposes that Ab\u016b \u2018Aq\u012bl is the name of a tribe in el-\u012araq which dwelt eastward of el-K\u016bfah, so that the breeze that blew from thence would be the East wind: but Ab\u016b \u2018Aq\u012bl is the Kunyeh or by-name of Lebtid, as will have been noticed from a previous passage in this account of him. \u201cHigh-nosed\u201d \u0634\u0645\u0651\u0627\u0621\u060c having the quality called \u0634\u0645\u0651 in the nose: that is, straightness with length and height: it is used to describe a magnanimous man who holds his head high. \u201cHighheaded\u201d \u0639\u0635\u064a\u0645: this word is properly applied to a camel who, by reason of the disease called \u0645\u0647\u062f\u060c is obliged to hold his head up in the air without turning it to right or left: hence it is applied in both a good and a bad sense to a proud and noble man who holds his head high. \u201cLong-armed\u201d \u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u062f\u060c i.e. generous. In the last line De Sacy reads \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0628\u060c while the B\u016bl\u0101q ed. has \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0628\u061b the former would mean the East wind\u2019s moaning or whistling: the latter the sweeping in different directions of its skirts as it blew.\n\nThe Arabic word for \u201cof \u2018Abd-Shems\u2019s line,\u201d viz. \u0639\u0628\u0634\u0645\u064a\u060c deserves notice as a curious contracted nominal adjective. In lines 5 and 6 the idea is that the camels, which are black\u2014the most precious kind of all (see \u2018Antarah, Mo\u2019all. 12)\u2014have humps so large (the hump being the most esteemed part of a camel as food\u2014Tarafch, Mo\u2019all. 93) that they look as if a company of negroes were riding on their backs. Ab\u016b Wahb was el-Welid\u2019s Kunyeh or by-name. Therid is a mess of bread crumbled into broth\u2014a much appreciated dish in the simple cookery of the Arabs.\n\nEl-Farezdaq, with el-Akhtal and Jerir, made up the famous triumvirate of most excellent poets of the third order, the Isl\u0101m\u012bs or those who had seen nothing of the days of the Ignorance.\n\nEl-Mo\u2019tasim reigned from A.D. 833 to 842: he succeeded his brother el-M\u0101m\u016bn, whose reign extended from 813 to 833 A.D.\nThis most touching and admirable poem has been rendered by R\u00fcckert in his translation of the Hamseh (Vol. I, p. 387). In line 2 \"mighty towers\" is \u0635\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0647\u064f, plural of \u0635\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0647\u064f, which has several meanings: \"fortresses\" is the one which seems to suit the passage best. Line 13 R\u00fcckert thinks probably spurious, the insertion of an after-age. He renders it\u2014\n\nDer Mensch, was ist er anders als was er Frommes denkt?\nund was sein Gut, als etwas auf Widerruf geschenkt?\n\nDe Sacy understands it as of the fleeting of life\u2014\"l'homme ressemble aux bonnes r\u00e9solutions que sugg\u00e8re la pi\u00e9t\u00e9.\" The latter is the preferable sense, though it certainly has a modern tone which is strange to old Arab poetry. R\u00fcckert also rejects, as a commonplace interpolation, lines 25 and 26; and certainly 23, 24 and 27, 28 seem to be consecutive in thought. In lines 17, 18 we have proof of Lebid's already great age when Arbed died, before he became a Muslim; line 18 might be more literally rendered \"I am as though, as often as I stand, I were stooping;\" r\u0101k\u012b is the posture assumed in prayer when the body is bent at right angles. In line 21 \"O go not away from us,\" \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627, is a phrase of frequent recurrence in dirges, and seems to have been used by the wailers at burials in the same way as (but with an exactly opposite sense) the Latin illuet. At the end of the same line I have followed De Sacy and R\u00fcckert in taking \u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064b as meaning \"a trysting place\" (\"un in\u00e9vitable rendezvous,\" \"unare Frist der Einigung\"); but it may also be rendered (as though pointed \u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064b) \"threatening, imminent.\" I prefer, however, the rendering adopted, as more suitable to the train of thought suggested by \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627. Lines 23 and 24 shew that Lebid was still a pagan and a disbeliever in the Resurrection when he uttered the verses. Lines 27 and 28 are quoted and explained by Lane s. v. \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0642\u064f. The \"waiter on the pebble's cast\" \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0635\u0649 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 (\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0642\u064f) is the woman who endeavours to obtain an augury by the cast and fall of stones (R\u00fcckert \"Sandwurfweissagerin\"), while the \"watcher of the flight of birds,\" \u0632\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650, is an auguree of the Roman sort (R\u00fcckert \"Vogelflugausleger\"). It would seem that these allusions to divining and the vanity of it are indirect attacks on Mohammed.\n\nThis history relates to the earliest days of el-Isl\u00e2m, before the first Flight, that to Abyssinia in A.D. 615. 'Othm\u00e2n son of Ma\u00e7\u02bf\u00fbn was one of the four converts who embraced the new faith together with 'Abd-er-Rahm\u00e2n son of 'Auf (Muir, Life of Mahomet, II, 106): he was a man of an ascetic temper, and his austerity caused the utterance by Mohammed of the precept\u2014\"There is no monkery in el-Isl\u00e2m.\" He led the emigration to the Christian Court of the Nej\u00e2sh\u00ee (id. II. 133). El-Weltd ibn el-Mugh\u00eereh was an aged chief of the Qureysh (id. II, 32, 80, 128, &c.) who led in the rebuilding of the Ka\u02bfbeh after its destruction by a flood in or about A.D. 606. He is believed to be the gainsayer who is cursed in the 74th S\u00fbraA of the Qur\u02be\u00e2n; he was one of the most violent of the Prophet's opponents, and a witness of His temporary apostacy, when he praised L\u00e2t, 'Ozza, and Men\u00e2t.\n\n\"The Holy Temple\" el-Mcejid-el-Har\u00e2m, i.e. the Ka\u02bfbeh.\n\nThe rest of this poem is given in the preamble to Lebid's Mo\u02bfallaqah in the edition of the Mo\u02bfallaq\u00e2t with Persian notes by Rash\u00eedu-n-Nab\u00ee of H\u00fbgl\u00ee. It runs\u2014\n\n\"Yea\u2014everything is vain except only God alone,\nand every pleasant thing must one day vanish away!\nAnd all the race of men\u2014there shall surely come among them\na Fearful Woe whereby their fingers shall grow pale;\"\nAnd every mother's son, though his life be lengthened out to the utmost bound, comes home at last to the Grave:\nAnd every man shall know one day his labour's worth when his loss or gain is cast up on the Judgment-Day.\"\n\nThese verses have, however, a suspicious Islamic tone, and their genuineness seems very doubtful. The \"bleaching of the fingers\" in v. 4 is death.\n\n**Esh-Sha'bi.** His name was '\u00c2mir ibn Shar\u00e2h\u00eel ibn 'Abd-eah-Sha'bt; he belonged to the Himyerite race, and was born in the 6th year of 'Othm\u00e2n's Khilafate; he was a K\u00e2lib (secretary or scribe) to successive governors of el-K\u00fbfeh. According to el-W\u00e2qid\u00ee he died in 105 A. H. at the age of 77: others say 104 A. H. This anecdote therefore gives an authority for the attribution to Lebid of the verses referring to his great age which extends to a period only about 60 years after the poet's death. (Ibn Quteybeh, Ma'\u00e2rif, p. 229).\n\n**\"Seventy.\"** As the verses were given before, they were uttered when Lebid's age was ninety.\n\n**En-N\u00e2bighah of Duby\u00e2n** was one of the foremost poets of the Ignorance: much of his verse is still extant, and has been printed in Ahlwardt's \"Diw\u00e2ns of the six Ancient Arabic poets.\"\n\nAccording to Ibn Quteybeh Lebid had sons: but when he became a townsman and settled in el-K\u00fbfeh, they returned to their desert life and left him (Ma'\u00e2rif, p. 169).\n\nThe Salm is uttered at the end of the prayers by the im\u00e2m and his fellow worshippers; if the worshipper be alone, it is addressed to the angels: if he be praying with others, it is addressed to men and angels together.\n\n\"Branches\": \u063a\u0635\u0646\u0648\u0646: so in the B\u00fbl\u00e2q edition. De Sacy reads \u063a\u0635\u0646\u0648\u0646, the folds or wrinkles of the body, and understands that these are flattened out by the heavy flags laid over them: but this is not in accordance with the method of burial in use among the Arabs.\n\nThese verses are not rendered by De Sacy. \"The Mother of the Sons\" has been explained before in note (13). The second couplet accords with the renown of Rabi'ah as the \"Rab\u00ee't-at-el-Mo'tarr\u00een\" of which we are told at the beginning of the Notice. Who the Ab\u00fb Shureyk mentioned in the third couplet is I do not know, nor the event (apparently some famous encounter) to which it refers: perhaps it is the great \"Day of the Defile of Jebelsh.\" Both this poem and that which follows it must be understood as belonging to the days of the Ignorance, before Lebid (already aged) ceased to compose verse.\n\n**The Mo'allaqah of Lebid.**\n\n**ARGUMENT.**\n\nIn verses 1 to 11 the Poet describes the deserted abode of his Beloved, where in the Spring her tribe and his had pastured their flocks together; verses 12 to 15 tell of her departure thence for distant fields, named in vv. 17\u201419. Then the Poet sets forth his view of friendship and the duties of friends when their love cools (vv. 20\u201427); mentioning his camel as the means of cutting short an acquaintance which has become a burthen, he first describes her hardy frame; then (v. 24) he likens her in her eagerness to start on her way to a cloud heavy with rain, the out-lying portions of which, having emptied themselves of their watery burthen, have hurried away on the moist wings of the South wind. Then follow two other comparisons: the first of the camel to a wild she-ass, driven far away into the wilds by her jealous mate; how these two lived together is told at length (vv. 25\u201435). The second compares her to a wild cow\nwhose calf has been killed and torn by wolves, and who wanders restlessly by the outskirts of the pastures away from the herd in search of it; at the end of her wanderings, when she is beginning to be comforted for her loss, she is beset by hunters and dogs, but escapes the former and beats off the latter (vv. 36\u201452). Then he turns again to his Lady, and tells her more of his mood. He describes to her the revels which she knows not of (vv. 57\u201461): his open-handedness (v. 62) in clothing the naked and feeding the hungry: his valour in defence of his tribe (v. 63), which gives him again occasion to tell of his good mare (vv. 66\u201469): his high place in the Courts of Kings, where he is chosen as arbiter between contending poets (v. 70): his liberal hospitality, when he provides for his friends fat camels as the prize of the arrow-gambling (vv. 73\u201475); and his charity to the poor and friendless, whom he satisfies with food (vv. 76\u201477). Then he passes from himself to his tribe, and vaunts their nobleness of heart and the valour and steadfastness of their young men and their greybeards (vv. 78\u201489).\n\n1 Effaced are her resting-places\u2014where she stayed but a while and where [she dwelt long\nin Mina: desolate are her camps in Ghaul and er-Rij\u00e2m,\n2 And by the torrents of er-Rayy\u00e2n: the traces thereof are laid bare\nand old and worn, as the rocks still keep their graving:\n3 Tent-traces over which have passed, since the time that one dwelt there,\nlong years, with their rolling months of war and peace.\n4 The showers of the signs of Spring have fallen on them, and there have [swept\nover them the rains of the thundering clouds, torrents and drizzle\n[both\u2014\n5 The clouds that came by night, those of the morning that hid the sky,\nand the clouds of even-tide, with their antiphons of thunder;\n6 There have sprung up over them the shoots of the rocket, and in the [sides\nof the valley the deer and the ostriches rear their young;\n7 The large-eyed wild kine lie down there by their young ones\njust born, and their calves roam in herds over the plain.\n8 The torrents have scored afresh the traces of the tents, as though\nthey were lines of writing in a book which the pens make new\n[again,\n9 Or the tracery which a woman draws afresh as she sprinkles the blue\nover the rings, and the lines shine forth anew thereon.\n10 And I stood there asking them for tidings\u2014and wherefore did I ask\naught of deaf stones that have no voice to answer?\n11 Bare was the place where the whole tribe had rested: they passed [away\ntherefrom at dawn, leaving behind them the tent-trenches and the [thatch.\n12 The camel-litters of the tribe stirred thy longing, what time they moved away and crept into the litters hung with cotton, as the wooden frame-work creaked.\n\n13 \u2014The litters hung all round, over their frame of wood, with hangings, thin veils and pictured curtains of wool.\n\n14 They began their journey in bands, wide-eyed as the wild cows of T\u016bdih, or deer of Wejrah as they watch their fawns lying around.\n\n15 They were started on their way, and the sun-mist fell off them, as though they were low rocky ridges of Bisheh, its tamarisks and its boulders.\n\n16 Nay\u2014why dost thou dwell on the thought of Naw\u0101r? for she is gone, and severed is all that bound her to thee, whether strong or weak.\n\n17 Of Murrah was she: she halted in Feyd, then she travelled on to those of el-Hij\u0101z. How then canst thou reach to her\n\n18 On the Eastward slopes of Aja\u2019 and Selma, or in Mohajjar where Fardeh and er-Rukh\u0101m cut her off from thy coming?\n\n19 Or it may be she went to el-Yemen, and then her abode should be in Wih\u0101f el-Qahr, or Tilkh\u0101m, in \u0160uw\u0101\u2019iq.\n\n20 Cut short then thy longing for one whose converse is changed to thee: and verily the best in affection is he who knows how to cut its bonds.\n\n21 Give freely thy best love to him who loves thee\u2014there remains to thee the power to flee him when his love limps and its straightness bends to a fall:\n\n22 To flee on a camel spent with journeyings, which have left of her yet something, her back and hump both thin and spare.\n\n23 When her flesh has fallen away, and her flanks grown spare and lean, and the strap which ties her shoe to her pastern is cut to pieces with use,\n\n24 Then she bends joyfully to the rein, eager to start, as though she were a dusky red cloud whose cloudelets drained of rain have sped away on the South wind:\n\n25 Or a wild she-ass great with young, mated to a white-bellied male whose sides bear the marks of his fights with the stallion-asses, their blows and their bites.\n\n26 He takes his way with her to the uplands among the hills, his sides all scarred, with jealousy in his heart roused by her rebellion and her desire.\nTo the downs of eth-Thelebut, where he scans from the heights thereof\nthe wilderness of rolling uplands, in dread lest the guidestones\nshould hide a foe.\n\nUntil, when they come to the end of the six months of Winter,\nthey feast their fill on the dewy herbage: and long had they suffered\nthirst.\n\nThey resolve to turn again, and seek with a steady purpose\nthe water-springs: and the way to gain one's end is to set the\nheart firm!\n\nTheir pasterns were pricked by the awns of the barley-grass, and there\nswept over them the hot blasts of Summer in their swiftness and their\nheat.\n\nAnd they raised as they galloped along a train of dust whose shadows\nfleeted like the smoke of a blazing fire with its wood wrapped in ruddy flame\n\nFanned by the North wind, its dry sticks mixed with moist stems of\n'arfaj, with its volumes of rolling smoke that rise over the tongues of\nflame.\n\nHe sped along thrusting her before him\u2014a custom it was of his,\nwhen she lingered behind, to thrust her on in front\u2014\n\nAnd they plunged together by the bank of the rivulet into a pool\nbrimming, set close with reeds, and splashed about its waters\u2014\n\nA pool set round with reeds that screened it from the sun\nthose of them that lay in a tangle on its face and those that stood\nupright.\n\nIs she like my camel\u2014or shall I compare her to a wild cow who has\nlost her calf, who lingers behind the herd, its leader and its stay?\n\nFlat-nosed is she\u2014she has lost her calf, and ceases not\nto roam about the marge of the sand-meadows and cry\n\nFor her youngling just weaned, white, whose limbs have been torn\nby the ash-grey hunting wolves who lack not for food.\n\nThey came upon it while she knew not, and dealt her a deadly woe\n\u2014Verily Death, when it shoots, its arrow misses not the mark!\n\nThe night came upon her, as the dripping rain of the steady shower\npoured on\nand its continuous fall soaked the leafage through and through:\n\nShe took refuge in the hollow trunk of a tree with lofty branches\nstanding apart\non the skirts of the sandhills, where the fine sand sloped her way.\nThe steady rain poured down, and the flood reached the ridge of her\nin a night when thick darkness hid away all the stars;\nAnd she shone in the face of the mirk with a white glimmering light\nlike a pearl born in a sea-shell that has dropped from its string.\nUntil, when the darkness was folded away and morning dawned,\nshe stood, her legs slipping in the muddy earth.\nShe wandered distracted about all the pools of So'aid\nfor seven nights twinned with seven whole long days,\nUntil she lost all hope, and her full udders shrunk\n\u2014the udders that had not failed in all the days of her suckling\nThen she heard the sound of men, and it filled her heart with fear\n\u2014of men from a hidden place: and men, she knew, were her\nShe rushed blindly along, now thinking the chase before\nand now behind her: each was a place of dread.\nUntil, when the archers lost hope, they let loose on her\ntrained hounds with hanging ears, each with a stiff leather collar\nThey beset her, and she turned to meet them with her horns\nlike to spears of Semhar in their sharpness and their length\nTo thrust them away: for she knew well, if she drove them not off,\nthat the fated day of her death among the fates of beasts had\nAnd among them Kes\u00e2b was thrust through and slain, and rolled in\nlay there, and Sukh\u00e2m was left in the place where he made his\nOn such a camel, when the glistening sands dance in the hot noon,\nand the skirts of the mirage clothe their rolling hills,\nWill I accomplish my desire\u2014I shall not be turned away from it by\nnor by all the reviling that men may care to heap on me.\nAnd did not Naw\u00e2r then know that I am one\nwho knits where he pleases the knot of love and cuts it where he\nWont to leave when it likes me the places that I care not for\ntill the fated doom of Death shall lay hold of a certain soul?\nNay, verily thou knowest not how many a night\ncool and mild, good for delight and revelry,\nI have passed as we told tales together: and many a vintner's flag\nhave I come to when it had been taken down and his wine grown\n[scarce and dear.\n\nI buy the costly wine in the old and blackened skin\nor the pitch-anointed jar, when its seal is broken and its wine ladled\n[out.\n\nMany the clear draught I have drunk in the morn, and many the sing-\n[ing-girl\nto whom I have listened as she strained the strings on the lute\n[which her thumb adjusts.\n\nI have risen to drink of the wine before the cock crowed at dawn\nthat I might drink deep of it again when the sleepers awoke from\n[sleep.\n\nAnd many the morning of wind and cold whose chill I have shut out\nwhen its reins were held in the hand of the bitter North.\n\nAnd I too have shielded the Tribe from harm when there bore my wea-\n[pons\na swift mare, my girdle its reins as I went forth at dawn:\n\nI mounted the watching-mound on the top of a dusty hill\nnarrow in standing-place, whose dust blew towards the standards\n[of the foe:\n\nUntil, when the Sun put forth his hand and laid hold of night\nand the darkness covered all the terrors of our line of fear,\n\nI came down, and my mare reared up like a lofty trunk of palm\nbare of branches, which the climber can never hope to climb;\n\nI pushed her along as the ostrich flees, and swifter than that,\nuntil, when she became hot with the race and her bones light,\n\nThe light saddle loosened upon her, and her breast streamed with\n[sweat,\nand her girth was soaked through and through with the foam\n[that covered her.\n\nShe rises in the air, and strives against the rein, and inclines sideways\nlike the circling down of a dove when a flight of them flies to drink.\n\nAnd many the Court of Kings thronged by strangers who know not one\n[another,\nwhose gifts are hoped for by men and their chiding feared,\n\nWhere thick-necked men stood, like lions, threatening one another in\n[their hate\nas though they were fiends of the Desert with their feet firm\n[set in strife\u2014\n\nI have denied what was vain in their claims, and dealt out to each his due\nas I judged right: and their noblest was not nobler than I.\n73 And many the camel, prize of the gamers, to whose slaying I have called my fellows with the gaming arrows, all alike in length:\n74 I call them to the slaying of a barren she-camel, or one with young, and her flesh has been given freely to all my neighbours;\n75 And the guest and the stranger from afar were in my tent as though they had come down into Teb\u00e2leh with its meadows of [rich grass.\n76 There sought refuge by my tent-ropes every wretched one clad in scanty rags and wasted like the camel by her master's [grave.\n77 And they fill brimful with meat, when the winds are blowing shrill, great bowls of broth, to which their fatherless ones come to drink.\n78 Verily we of '\u00c2mir, when the Tribes are met together, there wants not of us a Chief to lead in the doing of a noble deed,\n79 Or a Divider to portion out to the Tribe its due, or a Prince to give less or more as he deems right and good\n80 In his headship: or a generous man who helps men with his bounty free-handed, a gainer of all good gifts and one who takes them by [force.\n81 For he comes of a Stock to whom their Fathers laid down the way \u2014and every people has its own way and its leader therein.\n82 If there comes an alarm, thou shalt find among them the helmets of [mail, and the hawberks of woven mail the rings of which shine like stars:\n83 They will not be craven, nor shall their deeds fall without fruit, for their hearts are firm and waver not with vain desire.\n84 Be content with that which the King has allotted to thee as a portion: for verily One who knows has portioned out the tempers of men.\n85 And when faithfulness was dealt out among the Tribes of men, the Dealer gave to us a full and abundant share;\n86 And He built for us a house of glory with lofty roof and our greybeards and our young men have risen to the height [thereof.\n87 They are the Leaders in work when mishap befalls the Tribe, and they are its good Knights and they are its Lawgivers;\n88 And they are a fair Spring-tide to him who seeks their shelter, and to the widows, when their year of widowhood lengthens out;\n89 And they are the men to see that no Tribesman holds back in malice, and that no vile betrayer goes over to the foe.\nVerse 1. \"Mina.\" There are two places of this name mentioned in the Mar\u0101sid-el-\u012a\u1e6d\u1e6dil\u0101': the first the well-known valley close by Mekkeh, the second a place in Dariy-yeh, a province of Nejd, on the route which passes through that country from Mekkeh to el-Ba\u1e63rah; the latter is meant here. Ghaul and er-Rij\u0101m (that the latter should have the article is proved by a verse of Aus ibn \u1e24ojr cited by ez-Zauzen\u012b) are the names of two mountains in the same neighbourhood.\n\nv. 2. \"er-Rayy\u0101n:\" this is here the name of a mountain in Dariyyeh: it is also the name of a great mountain in the ranges of Aja' and Selma, the mountains of Teyyi', where, according to the Mar\u0101sid-el-\u012a\u1e6d\u1e6dil\u0101', there is a never-ceasing flow of water; the word means \"having abundance of water for irrigation\": and it is evident from the name and the mention of torrents here that abundance of water was as characteristic of the er-Rayy\u0101n in Nejd as of that in Teyyi'.\n\nv. 3. \"Long years\": Hijaj, plural of \u1e25ijjeh; literally, seasons of pilgrimage: as we say \"Summers\" and \"Winters\" in the same meaning. \"Months of war and peace\": in the days of the ancient Arabs the year was divided into four months of peace, in which war between the tribes was by common consent unlawful, and eight months during which war was permitted; the months of peace were Du-l-Qa'deh, Du-l-Hijjah, Moharram, and Rejeb.\n\nvv. 4 and 5. \"The showers of the signs of Spring:\" mar\u0101biu-n-nuj\u016bm: Mirb\u0101' is rain that comes in the beginning of the season called Rabi' or Spring: en-Nuj\u016bm are the constellations called anw\u0101', that is, the 28 Mansions of the Moon, which by their rising or setting at dawn were supposed to bring rain or wind, heat or cold (Lane s. v. \u0645\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0629). Rabi' is not strictly Spring; for it includes the whole time from September till March, during which rain falls in Arabia: it is that season when the pastures are fresh and grazing abundant. The commentator on verse 5 divides the year into three seasons, viz., Shit\u0101', Rabi', and Sayf, or Winter, Spring and Summer; and he says that in the different words used for clouds in verse 5 the rains of the whole year are described: those of Winter fall generally by night, those of Spring in the morning, and those of Summer in the evening. (For an account of the ancient Arabian seasons, see Lane, s. v. \u0634\u062a\u0627\u0621; and for one of the anw\u0101' see Pocock, Spec. Hist. Ar. p. 163.)\n\nv. 6. \"The rocket:\" Eyhaq\u0101n, explained as el-jirjir el-barri, which is the Erucis Sylvesteris.\n\nv. 7. \"Wild kine.\" According to Lane (s. v. \u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629) the animal intended is the antelope defassa of modern zoologists, which is still called by this name in Egypt. \"It is a species of bovine antelope; in Barbary, it seems that the animal thus called is another species of bovine antelope, or perhaps a variety of the former; it is said to be what is termed by Pallas antelope bubalis; by others, alephalus bubalis, or acronotus bubalis; and this is said to come occasionally to the Nile: but the Arabic appellations given above are employed with much laxity.\"\n\nv. 8. The comparison of the almost effaced traces of a Spring encampment, washed by the rain and worn by the winds, to lines of writing which have faded by long use is common in old Arabic poetry. Zuheyr says (the lines are quoted in the notice of him extracted from the Agh\u0101ni) speaking of tent traces (ful\u016bl)\u2014\n\n\u0628\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0623\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0637 \u062d\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0642\u064b\u0627 \u0645\u0635\u064a\u0644\u064b\u0627\n\n\"Worn are they: thou wouldst think their lines over which two years have passed were a parchment old and faded.\"\nAnother instance is quoted by Lane s. v. \u062c\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c. From this it is evident that writing and books were not so strange to the Arabs of the time immediately preceding el-Isl\u0101m as has sometimes been asserted.\n\nv. 9. The reference here is to the washm or tracery pricked into the skin of a woman's hands and arms. The pattern is pricked out with a needle, and there is sprinkled over the skin and rubbed into it a preparation called na\u02bf\u016br, here rendered \"blue,\" i.e. powdered indigo, but which may also mean powdered lamp-black. As the rains which deepened and broadened the traces of the tents are in verse 8 compared to a writer who goes over lines of writing again with a pen, so in v. 9 they are likened to a woman who renews the tattooing by sprinkling fresh pigment over the old lines; which being rubbed in, the lines appear fresh again.\n\nv. 11. \"Tent-trenches:\" nu\u02bfy, the trench which is dug round a tent to receive the rain draining from its roof and to prevent the flooding of its interior; it is to be remembered that these pastures were resorted to during the season of rain. \"Thatch,\" Thum\u0101m, i.e. panic grass. Forskal (page 20) says that the name is used for Panicum Dichotomum: but it is applied by the Arabs to many species of panicum. The grass is used for thatching and for stuffing holes in the tents so as to keep out the weather.\n\nv. 12. \"Crept into the litters:\" the word used (takannus) is appropriate to the action of a hare or a fox creeping into its hole (kinds).\n\nv. 14. T\u016b\u1e0d\u012bb is mentioned in v. 2 of the Mo\u02bfallagah of Imra\u02bf el-Qays. The Mar\u0101sid-el-Ittil\u0101\u02bf says that it is the name of \"a hill of white sand which rises among other hills of red sand in the great desert (ed-Dahn\u0101) near el-Yem\u0101meh,\" one of the Southern provinces of Central Nejd: \"but others say it is a different place.\" Wejr\u0101h is also mentioned in the Mo\u02bfall, of I. Q., verse 33: it is a stage on the road from Mekkeh to el-Ba\u1e63rah, 40 miles or 3 stages from the former, much frequented by wild kine. The mention of the look which a wild cow or deer casts on her young one, at which time her eyes are most beautiful and tender, as a comparison for the eyes of a beautiful woman is common in old Arab poetry. See I. Q., Mo\u02bfall, v. 33.\n\nv. 15. B\u012bsh\u0113h is the name of a valley in el-Yemen which is thickly populated: also of a village in Tib\u02bfameh; so the Mar\u0101sid: the commentary says that it is a valley on the road to el-Yem\u0101meh. The long line of camels with their litters in which the ladies ride is compared to the ridges of rock of this valley in the part where its ridges are low and sink into the plain (\u0628\u0650\u0634\u064e\u0647). These, in the noon-tide, stand out from the midst of the mirage, with their rocks and tamarisks (athl, Tamarix Orientalis), even as the tall camel litters make their way through the mists of morn which cling round them like a skirt.\n\nv. 16. \"Naw\u0101r:\" the name of his Love: the word means \"timid, retiring.\"\n\nv. 17. \"Of Murrah.\" There were many tribes of this name: the one intended is, however, probably Murrah ibn Sa\u02bfsa\u02bfah, the progenitor of which was the brother of \u02bf\u0100mir son of Sa\u02bfsa\u02bfah, father of the tribe to which Lebt\u012bd himself belonged. These Ben\u016b Murrah were more commonly known as the Ben\u016b Sal\u016bl, and, as stated in the extract from the Agh\u0101n\u012b, it was among them that the famous \u02bf\u0100mir ibn Tufeyl died after his unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the Prophet.\n\nFeyd is a place still well known by that name: it was visited by Palgrave (Central and East. Arab. Vol. I, p. 230), and is situated on the South-East face of Jebel Selma, the most Southern of the two ranges of Teyyi, about the middle of the range. el-Hij\u0101z, \"the barrier\" i.e. between the uplands of Nejd and the low coast country of Tib\u02bfameh, is the mountainous tract in which Mekkeh and el-Medineh are situated.\nv. 18. \"Aja' and Selma\": in the original el-jebel\u00e1n, \"the two mountains:\" the two well known ranges, now called collectively Jebel Shaumar, and formerly famous as the country of Teyyi'. They are now inhabited, according to Palgrave (I. 118), by a mixed race, sprung from the union of Teyyi' with 'Abs, Teghlib and Haw\u0101zin, called the Ben\u016b Shaumar (or acc. to Wetzstein, Z. D. M. G. XXII, p. 99, Shammar).\n\nel-Mohajjar is given as the name of several places in the Mar\u0101sid: here it probably means a hill of the range of Teyyi' which is girt (bojjira) by a stretch of sand. Fardeh is also the name of several places: here it appears to be an isolated hill in Teyyi', called in the Mar\u0101sid Fardet-esh-Shum\u016bl. er-Rukh\u0101m (Rukh\u0101m without the article in the Mar\u0101sid), a place in Teyyi'.\n\nv. 19. Suw\u0101'iq (in Mar\u0101sid, es-Suw\u0101'iq), a tract in el-Yemen. Of Tilk\u0101m the Mar\u0101sid only knows that it is mentioned here, and Wih\u0101f el-Qahr (\"Black rocks of violence\") is not mentioned at all.\n\nv. 23. Camels frequently have their soft feet protected by a leather shoe, which is tied by a strap round the pastern.\n\nv. 26. \"Her rebellion and her desire.\" The meaning seems to be that the he-ass's jealousy is roused by the rebellion of the female before her pregnancy and her desire thereafter, which makes him suspect that she may not be with foal by him.\n\nv. 27. eth-Theleb\u016bt, a waddi between Teyyi' and Duby\u0101n, South-East of the range of Selma. \"The guidestones\": dr\u0101m, plural of ir\u0113m, stones or cairns set up to mark the way in the desert.\n\nv. 28. \"The six months of winter:\" Jum\u0101da sittetan. According to ez-Zauzeni, Jum\u0101da is here put for esh-Sh\u012bd, winter, as in the verse of the \u1e24am\u0101seh\u2014\n\n\"In a night of Jum\u0101da, the season of cold and rain,\nwhen the camp-dog cannot see the tent-ropes for the darkness thereof.\"\n\nOthers say that he divides the year into two halves of six months each, and that Jum\u0101da is taken in its ordinary meaning, the name of a month, as the last month with which the Winter season ends; there are two Jum\u0101das, the first and the second, respectively the fifth and sixth months of the Arabian year: the second would be meant here. The verse means that during the cool season of dews and rain the two wild asses had satisfied themselves with the grass of the pasture, and had had no need of water, from which they had abstained all this time: then the Summer set in, and the pasture withered, so that they had to resort to the water in the deep valleys.\n\nv. 29. The literal version of this couplet is\u2014\n\n\"The two returned with their affair to a strongly set (purpose)\nfirmly determined: and success in plans is the fixing of them firm.\"\n\nI have added in my translation what is understood,\u2014that their purpose was to seek for water.\n\nv. 32. 'Arfaj, a shrub much used for fuel: its botanical name is not given by Lane, nor does it occur in Forskal.\n\nv. 36. \"Who has lost her calf:\" mesb\u0101'ah, more fully \"whose calf has been torn and slain by beasts of prey (sabo').\"\n\nv. 37. \"Flat-nosed:\" more accurately \"camoys-nosed,\" kh\u0101n\u0113d, an epithet reserved for kine and deer. \"The sand-meadows\": esh-Shaq\u0101'iq, plural of Shag\u0101gh, an intervening space or tract between two elongated tracts of sand, producing good herbage.\n\nv. 38. \"Youngling just weaned:\" so I have rendered mo'afar, following the commentary, which explains that it means \"cast down in the dust\" ('afar), and is applied to the young of an animal which is suckled by its dam and then left for a day or two to find its own food, so as to wean it gradually. The mother tumbles over the\ncalf in the dust when it desires to suck and prevents it from doing so. \"White:\" g\u0101bd. The wild kine are white, except the face and legs and tail, which are black: so says the commentator here. Imra'el-Qeys (Mo'all. 64) compares them to onyx stones.\n\nv. 43. \"A pearl born in a sea-shell:\" jum\u0101net-el-bahriy. Jum\u0101neh is properly a false pearl, or a bead of silver shaped like a pearl, from the Persian gum\u0101n, thought, fancy: here it is put for a genuine pearl, as is shewn by the following word el-bahriy, which may be either the shell or the diver. \"That has dropped from its string:\" salla niq\u0101m\u016bd\u0101: literally \"of which the string has been pulled out:\" the restless roaming of the cow is likened to the rolling hither and thither of the pearl.\n\nv. 45. No information is given in the Mar\u0101sid regarding So'a'id.\n\nv. 46. The commentary says that the apodosis of \u1e25att\u0101 i\u1e0d\u0101 in this verse, viz.: salet 'sm\u0101s (she forgot her young one), is omitted: I prefer to understand verse 47, though introduced by wa, as the apodosis. A similar construction exists in verse 49: \u1e25att\u0101 i\u1e0d\u0101 ya's\u012bra-r-rum\u0101t\u016b, wa arsal\u0101.\n\nv. 47. \"The sound:\" rizz, \"a noise heard from afar.\" \"From a hidden place:\" 'An \u1e63ahr\u012b gheyb\u012bn,\" \"from a place which concealed what was in it\".\n\nv. 48. In rendering this couplet the reading \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652 has been chosen instead of \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652; the former is cited in the notes to Arnold's edition (p. 29) from the Gotha MS.: the latter appears in his text. The native commentators prefer the latter, apparently because the construction of \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652 as an \u0625\u0650\u062e\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0652 is thought the most appropriate explanation of the verse: but \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652 from \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652 to run would be equally admissible as regards construction, \u062a\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u0652 being its \u062d\u0627\u0644, and the sense seems to require the word; for the next verse says that the pursuers lost hope of reaching her, evidently because of her swift flight. Taking \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0652 as the first word, the verse may be literally rendered\n\n\"She rushed along, thinking that each of the two openings was a meet place for fear, both behind her and before her\".\n\n\"The two openings,\" kila-l-sarjeyn: that is, the splitting of the thicket which opens before her and closes behind her as she rushes along: it is equivalent to the following words, khafsh\u0101 wa-im\u0101mu\u1e25\u0101. Maula \"a meet and fitting place,\" as in the Qur'\u0101n, \"en-n\u0101ru maulakum,\" \"The Fire is your fitting place.\"\n\nv. 49. \"With stiff leather collars on their necks:\" Q\u0101filan a'\u1e0d\u0101mu\u1e25\u0101. Another rendering of these words, which is the one preferred by De Sacy, is \"lean and slender-waisted\" (aux flancs maigres et effil\u00e9s); q\u0101fil means dry, and a'\u1e0d\u0101m, plural of '\u1e0d\u0101meh, is said to mean waist as well as leather collar. The latter meaning, however, is the only one of the two given in Lane.\n\nv. 50. \"Spears of Semhar.\" According to the commentary and other authorities quoted by Lane, Semhar was the name of a certain maker of spears who dwelt in the town of el-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d in el-Bahreyn, where the best bamboos from India were landed and fashioned into lances, which are thence frequently called khaffiy: he is said to have been the husband of Rudeyneh, who also used to straighten spears; others say that Semhar was the name of a town or village in Abyssinia where good spears were made. But it will be seen from Lane (s. v. \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0647\u064e\u0631\u0652 ) that there is a quadrilateral verb meaning \"to be straight and hard,\" and that semhariy is applied to bow strings as well as spears, while musmahirr is used of a thorn in the sense of tough. In this verse there is another appellative, Medariyyeh, that is, belonging to or made at Medar, a vil-\nlage in el-Yemen twenty miles from \u015ean'\u0101 (Mar\u0101qid), which also means spears (i.e., long and sharp horns), spears being made there as well as at el-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d.\n\nv. 52. Kes\u0101b and Sukh\u0101m, names of two of the hounds.\n\nv. 56. \"A certain soul:\" ba'da-n-nuf\u016bs, i.e., himself. This verse affords an interesting example of the archaic use of \\( \\text{\u062c} \\) as the equivalent of \\( \\text{\u064a} \\) ( \\( \\text{\u064a} \\) ) i.e., unless. Having the force of \"if not,\" it causes the verb to take the jussive or apocopated form required in the protasis of a conditional sentence.\n\nv. 58. \"As we told tales together\": the Arabic verb samara means to pass the night in drinking wine and holding pleasant discourse together. \"Vintner's flag:\" the shops (\u1e25\u0101n\u016bt) of the wine-sellers were distinguished by flags hung out before them; when the flag was taken down it was a sign that the shop was closed or that the wine had run out. In this verse and the next Lebd vaunts his liberality in buying wine for his fellows when it was at its dearest. So 'Antarah (Mo'all. 52), describing a gallant man, calls him hatt\u0101ku ghdyd\u012b-t-tij\u0101r \"one who pulls down, or causes to be taken down, the vintners' flags,\" i.e., exhausts their stock.\n\nvv. 60, 61. The morning draught of wine is praised above all others by the ancient poets. In the work entitled el-Mari-en-na\u1e0d\u012br (\"the green meadow\") Mohammed ibn Abi Bekr el-Usy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b says of the \u1e63ab\u0101k or morning potation\u2014\"The poets make mention of the morning draught in preference to wine drunk at other times, because in ancient times Kings and others used to prefer drinking in the morning, and because of the freedom of the heart at that time from care or thought of the obstacles and calamities of Fortune; also because those that arose early to drink anticipated those who blamed their wantonness: for it is the custom of the blamer to blame a reveller in the morning for what he has done the night before, because that is the time when he becomes sober and recovers from his drunken fit.\" (Quoted from Kosegarten, Mo'all. of 'Amr Kulth. p. 49.)\n\n\"A singing girl.\" The singing girls who sang at the drinking parties of the ancient Arabs were Greeks, Syrians, or Persians; until after el-Isl\u0101m the Arabs, though masters of rhythm and metre, had no indigenous system of singing except the rude song (originally of the camel-driver) called ra'jiz. These girls probably sang for the most part in their own tongue and played the music which they had learned in Persian 'Ir\u0101q or Syria; but in the life of en-N\u0101bighah of \u1e0cuby\u0101n as given in the Agh\u0101n\u012b (IX. 164) a singing-girl of Yethrib (afterwards el-Med\u012bnah) is mentioned, who sang one of that poet's poems in Arabic and so enabled him to detect a fault of prosody.\n\nv. 62. \"Whose chill I have shut out,\" i.e., by gifts of clothes and food to the naked and hungry. The phrase \"when its reins were in the hand of the bitter North\" means that the North, the coldest of winds, had full control over the day.\n\nv. 63. \"My girdle its bridle\": he threw the bridle over his shoulders so that it became a girdle to him, in order that he might have his hands free for his weapons.\n\nv. 64. The dust blew from the hill-top where he acted as scout on to the Enemy's banners: this indicates that they were close at hand and that his post was one of danger.\n\nv. 65. \"The terrors of our line of fear:\" 'aur\u0101t-eth-thugh\u016br. 'Aur\u0101t means the dangerous or undefended portions of a place open to attack; and thugh\u016br, plural of thagh\u016br, is the frontier over which the enemy spreads his line of assailants. When the sun sets, and watching at the place of observation is of no further use by reason of the darkness, Lebd comes down and scours the plain between his Tribe and the foe, to see that no night attack is being prepared by the latter.\nv. 66. In this verse the word \u0686\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652 is used of the trunk of a palm tree which is still an object of desire to the gatherer of the fruit, but is so tall that he cannot hope to climb it: it is thus evident that the word is not, as stated by the authorities quoted in Lane a. e., restricted to the trunk of a palm tree after it has become dry or has lost its head of leaves and fruit.\n\nv. 68. \"Light saddle:\" \u0686\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652, a saddle made only of sheep-skin and wool, without any frame of wood, used by swift riders.\n\nvv. 70.\u201472. In these verses, says the commentator, he boasts of the contention which passed between him and er-Rabi' son of Ziy\u00e2d at the court of en-No'm\u00e2n son of al-Mund\u00eer king of el-Hirh\u00e2. The circumstances of this contest are related in the notices of both poets given in the Kit\u00e2b el-Agh\u00e2n\u00ee.\n\nv. 71. \"Fiends of the Desert:\" \u062c\u0650\u0646\u0650\u0651\u064a\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e. El-Bed\u00eeyi may be either the proper name of a certain valley, or it may be synonymous with el-b\u00e2diyeh, the Desert generally.\n\nv. 73. The custom of the Arabs in gambling with arrows was to require those who lost to pay for the camel which was the prize of those who won: Lebd's liberality consisted in that he furnished the prize himself from his herds, and thus those who lost had not to pay.\n\nv. 74.

Lebd's own father Rab\u00ee'ah, as the Agh\u00e2n\u00ee informs us, was known as Rabi'at-el-Mo'tarrin i.e. \"a Spring for those who came to seek his bounty.\"\n\n\"Their year of widowhood.\" The commentator quoted by Arnold (not ez-Zauzeni) says that in the Ignorance it was the custom for widows on the death of their husbands to undergo a period of separation (\"iddah\") extending to one year. Under al-Isl\u00e2m the iddeh was fixed (S\u00fbrat-el-Baqarah, verse 234) at four months and ten days. During this\nperiod they could not marry again nor go forth from their houses, and were thus most miserable. Reference appears to be made to this ante-Islamic custom in v. 240 of the Surat-el-Baqarah.\u2014\"Such of you as shall die and leave wives shall bequeath their wives a year's maintenance without causing them to leave their houses.\" That the period of mourning in the Ignorance was a full year, not for widows only but for the whole family of the deceased, may be gathered from the verses of Lebd on his own death quoted near the end of the notice of him in the Agh\u00e2ni, where he bids his daughters mourn for him\u2014\n\n\"Until the year is done\u2014then the name of Peace be on you:\nfor he who weeps for a year has discharged what is due from him.\"\n\nEx-Zauzeni, however, takes murmil\u00e2t as meaning merely \"poor women,\" and refers the lengthening of their year spoken of to the weariness of their life of poverty.\n\nv. 89. The commentator quoted by Arnold explains humu-L'ashireh as equivalent to hum muglihu-l-'ashireh: \"They are the men who order or rule the tribe.\" Ex-Zauzeni and the Persian commentator Rash\u00eedu-n-Nab\u00ee, however, reject so violent an ellipse and take the verse in the simpler construction which I have followed. Of the use of \u0644\u0641 in the negative sense which it bears here (= lest) other examples are to be found in the Mo'allaqah of 'Amr son of Kulth\u00fbm, vv. 26 and 32.\nOn the Shighni (Ghalchah) Dialect.\u2014By R. B. Shaw, Political Agent, Ladak.\n\nA few words of the Shighni dialect, collected by Munshi Faiz Bakhsh, were attached to my former paper on the Ghalchah Dialects printed in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Pt. I, for 1876. I see that the late Oriental Congress held at St. Petersburg expressed the opinion that a study of the forms of speech in use about the head-waters of the Oxus was very desirable. I hope therefore that this short grammar and specimen story of a third of those dialects may be acceptable.\n\nShighn\u00e0n and Rosh\u00e0n, the districts where it is spoken, lie in the valley of the Oxus just above the country of Darw\u00e0z, on the great bend which the river takes round Badakhshan. They extend also up the valleys of some of its feeders which descend from the Pamir. They are both under the same Ruler (Asaf Ali Khan is the name of the present Mir). His dominions form the most northerly of the Hill-States dependent on Afghanistan. My informant (a Shighni) saw him go, some six years ago, to do homage at Faizabad to Naib Muhammad Alam, the Governor of Afghan Turkistan. The next year, his son went on a similar errand, since which my informant has been absent from his country. On both occasions tribute was taken: 2000 tillas (gold coins), 1000 y\u00e0mbu (Chinese shoe-silver) &c. These are probably mere round figures used to express a considerable (and unknown) amount; for these two items alone would be worth about \u00a318,000. The next district to the north, Darw\u00e0z, is represented as being subordinate to Bokh\u00e0r\u00e0. Shighn\u00e0n was not invaded by the Afghans, but followed natural-\nly the destiny of the mother province, Badakhshan, to which it has been, from time immemorial, attached. The former seems to be the most important of the Ghalchah States, and wonderfully protected from invasion by natural advantages.* It would thus form a safe refuge for an aboriginal people.\n\nThe valleys of the Oxus feeders which form the greater part of the territory of Shighn\u00e0n and Rosh\u00e0n, open out at their heads into the high plains of Pamir. It will be observed that the Shighni dialect shows a greater affinity to that of Sarikol (in the Eastern side of Pamir) than to the speech of the Wakhis, notwithstanding that the latter occupy a valley on the same side of the main water-parting, and parallel with the Shakh-Darrah (Shighn\u00e0n). This would show that the open Pamirs must have opposed less serious obstacles to inter-communication than the Western ridges which divide the Oxus feeders from one another, or than the narrow gorge of that river itself. Its local name \"Panjah,\" suggests the illustration of a hand with fingers outspread (as in playing the piano). It is obviously easier (comparing small things with great) to cross the level back of the hand, than to travel at right angles across the arched fingers.\n\nThe Shighni dialect has all the sounds known in the other Ghalchah dialects with the addition of one which is intermediate, and seems to explain the transition, between the Persian skh and the Sarikoli kh (as in German ich). It will have been noticed that many Persian words such as shab, sharmanda, P\u00e0dsh\u00e0h, become in Sarikoli kh\u00e1b, kharmanda, P\u00e0dkh\u00e1h, &c. The Shighni supplies the intermediate step by a sound which I do not know how to express (without special type) better than by the compound skh. It is the German ch of ich sibilated so as almost to resemble an English sh. The steps are plain from the sh pronounced at the back of the upper teeth with the front part of the tongue, to the skh a little further back with the middle part of the tongue raised, and to the Ghalchah kh slightly further back still. This skh is unlike the Wakhi sch; for while the former is an attempt to sibilate the kh, the latter is an sh pronounced at the back of the palate, with the tongue curled back.\n\nTHE SUBSTANTIVE.\n\nSingular.

The Infinitive is in ao, and the declension of the Verbal Substantive is effected with the Root (deprived of the ao) as well as with the full Infinitive form. In other words the Nominative and Accusative of the Verbal Substantive add the syllable ao to the Root form, and other cases add their own respective terminations either to the Root or to the Nom. form.\n\n**Conjugation of the Verb 'To Take'.**\n\n(i.)

B. The form chid-ao sut may be compared with ghi\u00e8w sut \u201che went (to) the hunt\u201d, to show that there is nothing exceptional in the Verbal Substantive taking the Accusative (which is the same as the Nominate,) form after the verb sut \u201che went\u201d. In both cases it is probably a contraction for the Dative chid-ao-ird and ghi\u00e8w-ird. Cf. English \u201che went a journey\u201d, \u201che wrote me word\u201d. The Infinitive is merely a case of the Verbal Substantive. With common compounds, as in Hind. before sakna and chukna, or, in Persian after b\u0101yad, tav\u00e0nad, &c., the termination vanishes and the mere root is left.\n\nThe Numerals are:\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | one | y\u00ecw, y\u00ec, or \u00ec |\n| 2. | two | dho |\n| 3. | three | \u00e0rro\u00eb |\n| 4. | four | tsav\u00f2r |\n| 5. | five | pinz |\n| 6. | six | khh\u00e0ushk |\n| 7. | seven | wuvd |\n| 8. | eight | wassht |\n| 9. | nine | n\u00e0\u00f2 |\n| 10. | ten | dh\u00ecs |\n| 11. | eleven | dh\u00ecs-et-y\u00ecw |\n| 15. | fifteen | dh\u00ecs-et-pinz |\n\nSHIGHNI STORY.\n\nWOI\u2014DIR\u00c8GH.\n\n1.

One day a king made an agreement with (his waz\u00eer), (and) said: If to me there be a son (born), and to thee a daughter, (thou shalt) give thy daughter to my son. The (other) wazirs were sitting (there), and heard this compact. 2. One day a son was (born) to the waz\u00eer, and he died. To the king a daughter was (born). (Next) morning they brought the news to the king : \u201c A daughter has been (born) to thee.\u201d 3. The king was sitting in public, (when) a man came in, (and) said : \u201c The waz\u00eer is dead.\u201d (But) the king refused his alliance. Men heard this. (So) the waz\u00eer\u2019s son remained (unmarried).\n4. Day by day he increased in stature and became big. A day was, (that) he spoke to his mother (and) said: \"Gracious mother, there is a bow of my father's.\" She said: \"Go into the treasury.\" He entered into the treasury, and took the bow and came out. 5. He came outside, and at once began to exercise himself. He practised much, and became expert. 6. A woman came from market. She came with (some) whey in a vessel on her head. He pulled the bow, (his arrow) struck this vessel, so that it passed through it from one side to the other. 7. The whey poured down into her face. Then she put her hand to her face. She fixed her eyes on the boys. All of them (had their) arrows in their bows, the wazir's son's (was) empty. 8. Then she said: \"Oh wretch! was it for this that thou wast born of thy mother? The king has (done well to) refuse relationship with thee!\" 9. Then he carried his hand to his pocket, and took a penny thence. He threw (it) to that woman (saying): \"Oh woman! take thou the penny; why dost thou speak evil words?\"\n\n10. He told his mother (of) this matter, (and) said: \"Oh mother! what evil (?) was there in my father. These men come not into my presence.\" He sent a man into the villages. He assembled all the people, and brought them (in). Not any one went into the king's presence. Then he began at once to give food to the men. 11. Afterwards he took counsel with the people. He said, \"I will send a man into the king's presence, (and say) a man's word (is equivalent to) a woman's deed.\" 12. They sent the man, (who) went into the king's presence, and saluted (him). (The king replied:) \"And to you be the peace. May thy father's house be blessed. Thou hast accomplished a good journey.\" 13. Then (the man) took up his tale, (and) said: \"King of the world! The wazir's son sent me before thee. Thou hadst made such and such an agreement with his father. Whatever falls upon the heads of kings, they turn not away from their word. What is this (that thou doest)?\"\n\n14. Then the king said: \"Seize this (man). Thrust an arrow through his mouth. (It) will be a warning to another.\" 15. Then this man went out, and went before the wazir's son, who saw him, and said: \"Oh take this arrow from this (man's) mouth.\" They took the arrow. Then he asked him (of) the matter, and said: \"What did he do?\" 16. He replied: \"I spoke thy word. The king said: Thrust an arrow through this man's mouth. It will be a warning to another.\" 17. The wazir's son turned to his counsellors, and spoke, saying: \"What shall we do now? Consult together\", he said. (They replied) \"We will send another man.\" They sent another man. 18. He arrived in the king's presence. After salutation, he took up his tale. The king said: \"Seize him!\" The wazirs said: \"Oh king of the world! first do thou talk (with him); after all, that is a young boy who makes so much of a\nfuss; do you make a greater fuss. Now let it be thus, (say) \u2018Bring me a white falcon, (and) I will ally myself with thee.\u2019\u201d (So) they gave that man his leave. 19. He went into the presence of the wazir\u2019s son, (and) said: \u201c(Art) thou a lion or a fox?\u201d (The other) replied: \u201cNo, I have ever been a lion\u2019s offspring.\u201d The man said: \u201cThe fact of the matter is this: let him bring me a white falcon (says the king).\u201d\n\n20. Then he turned to his counsellors, (and) said: \u201cMake preparations.\u201d They made preparations. They got ready provisions for him. In the morning they set out on the road. All of them started with him, (but) he turned them back, saying: \u201cI have no need of you. I am a Kalandar (beggar). If I (can) bring and give the king\u2019s service, this (is my desire). Turn ye back.\u201d 21. Then by himself he set his face to the road. His road (went) towards the wilderness, and to the skirt of the desert. He travelled many a farsang (parasang) (and then) a river came across (his path). 22. He alighted from off his horse. A horseman came from another direction, (and) alighted on the bank of the river. They spoke to one another. (The new-comer) said: \u201cEh, brother! may your journey be happy. What object hast thou chosen (for it)?\u201d The wazir\u2019s son replied: \u201cI am going on the service of the king, for a white falcon.\u201d\n\n23. (The other) said: \u201cWhat is your distinguished name?\u201d He replied: \u201cThe wazir\u2019s son.\u201d This one in return asked the other (his name), who answered: \u201cAl\u00e0-\u00e0spa.\u201d Then (the wazir\u2019s son) said \u201cCome, let us go together.\u201d (Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa) said: \u201cDo thou shut thine eyes, (and) turn thy face backwards, (and) I will come.\u201d The wazir\u2019s son shut his eyes, (and) turned his face backwards. He turned round, the other (was) before him.\n\n24. Then they joined together and went on. They went into a desert. A long way they journeyed, and became thirsty and hungry. Then they alighted in the midst of that desert. (Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa) said: \u201cOh brother! bring out a morsel of food.\u201d He took out some food, and at once they began to eat. 25. After eating the food, (the wazir\u2019s son) said: \u201cDo thou go for a walk on one side, thou wilt find a (place) under some rock or other, (which) we will make our shelter for the night.\u201d Then the wazir\u2019s son sat down, and Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa went off. He made a large circuit in that desert, nothing was there. Then he sat down for a moment there. 26. He raised his hands in supplication, (and) bowed his head. (Again) he raised his head, and looked: a castle has sprung up, with the gate open. He went and entered the castle, and walked through it. Then he turned away from the place, and went back to his companion. 27. He said: \u201cOh brother! I have found a (place at the) foot of a rock, to-night let us go, there is our shelter for the night.\u201d Then they went and entered the castle. The (wazir\u2019s son) said: \u201cOh brother! where is that rock shelter?\u201d Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa answered: \u201cIs this an insufficient rock shelter?\u201d 28. They went\nand fetched fuel. One (of them) at once began to light a fire. The other went for water. Then they began to drink and eat. They ate, and tied up their horses in the stable. They placed barley and grass (before them).\n\n29. That night they slept there; in the morning Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"I go a hunting, do thou sit (still).\" He went a hunting, the wazir's son sat still. 30. He cooked some food for himself. He ate by himself, and covered up the other's portion and put it by. By himself he came and threw himself on to his bed. (A certain) time elapsed, (and then) the door made a sound. 31. A span-high thing came in and passed on to the fireplace. It pulled out a hair of its own moustache, bound him hand and foot and threw him down. It ate his food itself and went out. The wazir's son struggled, and with difficulty succeeded in drawing himself out of (his bonds), and pursued it.\n\n32. He looked for it; it jumped into a pit. He became vexed and turned back. He entered the castle. He came by himself and sat down in his own place. He took his sword and at once began to sharpen it. The door creaked, he took his sword up and rushed behind the door. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa entered by it. 33. He said: \"Brother, what is my offence against thee?\" The other replied: \"Let us go, I will tell thee a tale.\" Then they went (in). Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa put down his load (of game) from off his back. The other went and brought food for him. He ate his meal and said grace. The wazir's son got up and at once began cleaning the saucepan and the dish. 34. Then Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"What was my offence against thee?\" The other said: \"Oh, thou (hast) not (committed) any offence against me. I and thou are brothers. Just now I cooked some food. I ate it by myself and set (some) aside for thee. I came and threw myself down in my own place. The door creaked. A span-high (creature) entered. Then it pulled out a hair of moustache of its own. It bound me hand and foot. It ran and ate its meal. Then it went out. I struggled and struggled and painfully released myself. Then I followed after it. 35. I looked for it, and it jumped into a pit I turned back again. I came and took my sword, and sat down here. The door creaked. I started up (thinking) this time if it enters, it will at once have me down. Thou didst enter.\" They spread out their bedding and went to sleep.\n\n36. The morning dawned, and Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"Oh wazir's son, do thou go a hunting and I will sit (still).\" The wazir's son went a-hunting. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa at once began (to prepare) a meal. He cooked the food, himself he ate (his portion) and set aside (some) for the other. He took his sword and came and sat down there. 37. At that very moment the door creaked; he at once arose and it entered. He made a stroke with his sword, and struck its head off at his feet, (while) the body (fell) behind the door. 38. He ran and collected his cups and platters, that they\nshould not become bloodied. Before he could sit down (again), (the creature's) head flew on to its neck and became joined on. Then it went out and fled away. 39. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa pursued it. He looked for it. For once he turned aside, and put his hand on his beard saying: \"To-morrow you shall see what will happen to you.\"\n\n40. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa returned discontentedly, and entered the castle. He came and sat in his own place. He placed his sword on the skirt (of his robe). At last the door creaked, and he jumped up. The wazir's son came in. He said: \"What offence have I (committed) against thee?\" 41. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa replied: \"Nothing at all. Yesterday thou didst tell (me a tale); I did not believe (it). Thy story has been verified. Come, now let us put away our hunting. Let us employ some artifice to enter (the creature's) pit. Let us twist a silken rope.\" 42. (So) they twisted a rope forty yards (long). In the morning they made their breakfast, and went on their way. The wazir's son said \"I will go in.\" Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"Well, thou canst not (find) strength.\" Then they arrived at the spot. He fastened the rope tightly under his arms. He entered as far as his knees. (Then) he exclaimed: \"Oh! I burn!\" 43. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa pulled in the rope, and said: \"(Now) the turn is mine. One instruction I give thee. (If) I say, Oh, I burn; (then) do thou let the rope go freer.\" Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa entered. He cried: \"Oh! I burn.\" The other let (the rope) out. 43. Finally a long time passed, the rope remained short in his hand. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa reached the bottom of the earth, (the country of) Chil-diny\u00e0. He undid the rope from under his arms. Then the wazir's son made a camp-fire at the mouth of the pit.\n\n44. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa started off. A flock came (along the road) from in front, meeting him. He saluted the shepherd and said: \"Whose is this flock?\" The shepherd answered: \"The span-high one's.\" Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa came up and seized a sheep. He took off its head in the air (without throwing it on the ground). He prepared for himself one spit (-full of meat) for roasting, from off it. He cooked and eat it, and then went on. 45. Next a cow-herd met him. He saluted him and asked: \"Whose are these cattle?\" (The cow-herd) replied: \"The span-high one's.\" He went, and seized the largest of all the bulls; he took its head off. He prepared for himself one spit (-full of meat) for roasting, from off it. The rest of it he threw away. The cow-herd struck himself a slap on the face. 46. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa went on, some distance, when a camel-herd met him. He saluted him and said: \"Whose are these camels?\" The other replied: \"The span-high one's.\" He went and seized the biggest of all the male camels. He took its head off; and prepared for himself one spit (-full of meat) for roasting, from off it, and went on (again). The camel-herd struck himself on the face. 47. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa went on. A man in charge of a troop of\nhorses met him. He saluted and said: \"Whose is this troop of horses?\" He went (and) seized a big horse, and took its head off. He prepared for himself a spit (-full of meat) for roasting, from off it. That keeper of the horses struck himself on his face. 48. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa went on and arrived at the town. The Treasurer was sitting in the gateway. (Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa) said: \"What doest thou here? Here not a bird (even) is able to breathe.\"* (The other) answered: \"However that may be, my fate has brought me here.\"\u2020 49. Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa asked him: \"In what (lies) the life of the span-high one?\" The treasurer answered: \"To-day is two days since he was in the Upper World. He returned wounded thence. Now he sleeps. His life is at his side, (and lies) in two stones, one on this side and one on that. Break those stones. From inside them two magpies will come out. Cut their heads off from the left. At his side there is a stick. Strike it on thy knee and break it. From inside it a lamp will come out. Put it into the water, and his life will go out (of him). If thou wert to put him in pieces fine as millet seed, he would not die. If thou omittest not one of these (instructions), he will die.\" Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa performed these instructions. The span-high one died.\n\n50. Forty keys of his were (hanging) on pegs. He took them, and immediately began to open the doors. He opened them all, (till but) one remained. He came and at once opened this and went in. A beautiful (damsel was) there. Neither the sun entered to her, nor the moon. 51. She immediately began to weep and said, \"Oh youth! why dost thou work thine own perdition?\" He answered, \"For love of one hair of thine. What doest thou there?\" She said: \"I was seven years old (when) the span-high one stole me, and brought me and made me fast here.\" He said, \"Be happy, I have killed him.\" She answered, \"It is not easy to kill him; if thou wast to make him (into pieces) the size of grains of millet he would not die.\" Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa said, \"Let us go; see I have killed him.\" He took her by the hand and they came. She looked; he was dead.\n\n52. Then they sat down that evening. They ate their meal. (Then) they came to sleeping. He drew his sword and threw it (down) between (them). She said, \"Why doest thou thus?\" He answered, \"I have received (this) counsel of my father. As long as I have not reached my home, I do not ungird myself.\" Then they slept. 53. In the morning he loaded up the wealth of that (creature). All of it he loaded up. They came to the mouth (bottom) of this pit. (Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa) shook the rope, and tied the things one by one, and (the wazir's son) pulled (them up). At last he finished hauling, and (Al\u00e0-\u00e0spa) brought that Beauty (to the rope).\n\n* I.e. \"there is not room for a bird even to get in and steal.\"\n\u2020 A common reply to an impertinent question. Lit. \"Whatever may be (the case), by my fate I have come here.\"\nwazir's son pulled. At one sight of her face, (he fell) in love as if he had beheld her a hundred times. 54. \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa had kept a black sheep by him. By way of a trial, he made the rope fast to it and said: \"Pull well, it (is) I.\" (The wazir's son) pulled, (till) a cubit remained. He saw a black sheep. Then he cut the rope. (The body of the sheep) struck (the ground) in front of \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa, and was (dashed) to pieces. 55. Then he wept much, and said: \"Alas for the world. For the sake of that Beauty, he has treated me so.\"\n\n56. Then the wazir's son repented himself, saying: \"(Why) did I not take him out?\" He returned and came to the mouth (head) of the pit, and threw down the rope to \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa, who seized the rope: the other pulled, \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa came out. They embraced one another, and wept much. 57. \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"Brother, why didst thou so? Thou hast become in love with the Beauty, in love with the goods of this world.\" The other replied: \"Whatever has happened, has happened so.\" They went into the castle. 58. The wazir's son said: \"Come, let us divide (the goods). \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"Do thou make the division.\" The wazir's son began to divide, and takes for himself what is large and good; the refuse he gives to the other. \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"This woman is now thine, these goods are now thine, I want them not.\" Even his own share he gave to him. 59. He said: \"Do thou sit still, I will go and bring thee the white falcon.\" He sat still, and \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa went off. A certain space of time passed. He went into a town, he took a white falcon and came (back). He came and remained there for the night, in the morning he said: \"Let us start.\" They ate their food and saddled their horses, and started.\n\n60. They went a certain distance of road. Then they arrived at the bank of that river. \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"Here I say good-bye.\" The wazir's son said: \"Come, let us divide these goods.\" \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa said: \"No, by thy mother's milk (they are) a gift to thee. And I have one bargain (to make) with thee. If thou perform that same for me, I am satisfied with thee in this world and in the next. Make me the promise. 61. The bargain is this. (When) thou hast gone and made thy marriage, and arrived at the throne of prosperity, and art about to sleep, put out thy foot to thy wife and say: 'Pull off my sock.' When she has pulled off one, say: \"Woi-Diregh! (Ah, alas!)\" If thou doest that so, I (shall be) well pleased with thee.\"\n\n62. \u00c0l\u00e0-\u00e0spa went on his way (direction). The wazir's son came to his own place. They carried the news to the king, that the wazir's son has come and has brought a white falcon. The king gave that man the reward of good news. 63. The wazir's son arrived and entered the king's presence. He took the falcon and went in. The king arose from his place. He gave him the salutation of a friend. He took the falcon on his\nhand, and said: \"Wazir's son; thou hast had much trouble. Go (and repose) in thy house.\"\n\n64. He went home. His mother saw him and rejoiced much. That night he remained (there) and in the morning he took up (the arrangements for) his wedding. Men assembled together. They made a wedding feast for five days. The king did not give such a feast, as the wazir's son gave. 65. The next day they celebrated the marriage. He took his wife and went home. On going to bed he put out his foot to his wife and said: \"Pull off my sock.\" She pulled off one: He said: \"Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh (Ah! alas!),\" and his wife said: \"What is this? If thou hast taken Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh (to wife), why didst thou take me?\" 66. He said: \"Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh is a man, not a woman.\" She said: \"No, a woman. That same day that thou wentest forth, she at the same time went. I and she studied at school together.\" He said: \"If that be so, I do not want thee at all.\" 67. He put on his sock (again), and mounted his horse and went forth that same night. At last it became light. A flock of sheep met him. He saluted (the shepherd) and said: \"Whose is this flock?\" (The shepherd) replied: \"Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh's.\" 68. Thence he went on; a camel-herd met him. He said: \"Oh camel-herd! whose are these camels?\" He answered: \"Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh's.\" Thence he went on, a cow-herd met him. He said: \"Whose are these cattle?\" He replied: \"Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh's.\"\n\n69. He went on; a garden came (in sight) in front of him. He asked: \"Whose is this garden?\" The gardener answered \"Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh's.\" The gardener had (has) taken some flowers in a vase. His face was away from (the wazir's son). The latter took off his ring and hid it in the midst of the flowers. The gardener took (them) up and went away. 70. He took the flowers to Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh. She had thrown herself on to a couch. He took up the flowers to her. She said: \"Oh gardener, thou hast brought wonderfully sweet-smelling flowers.\" 71. Then she took the flowers and opened them out. The ring came out. She said: \"Oh gardener, who is in the garden?\" He answered: \"Oh lady! a person came into the garden.\" She said: \"Speak not of flowers (compared) with his face.\"\n\n72. The wazir's son came out of the garden. He came to the castle gate. A maid came out for water. He came and sat by the side of a bush. The maid came and fetched water. 73. He said: \"Oh maiden, give me some water.\" She said: \"Art thou not a wonderfully foolish person? Wo\u00ef-Dir\u00e8gh is fairy-born. How shalt thou drink water in her cup?\" (So) she would not give him any water, (but) she took her water and went off.\n\n74. She had not gone a yard (when) her water turned into blood. She poured it away and came again and fetched (more) water. He said: \"Oh maiden, give me water.\" She did not give him (any). 75. Again she went\nto the (same) spot and (the water) became blood. Again she poured it away. Again she came and fetched water. He said: \"Oh maiden, give me water.\" She did not give it.\n\n76. He said: \"Oh maiden, if thou takest it till to-morrow, thou wilt not make the water reach her presence. Give me water.\" (She) filled the cup and handed it to him. A drop he drank, (and) threw his ring into the cup. He spread his handkerchief over the water, and said: \"Open not its mouth (lit. head), (but) convey it to Woi-Dir\u00e8gh.\"\n\n77. She brought it and (Woi-Dir\u00e8gh) said: \"Ah! how dost thou bring water! To-day has become to-morrow.\" (The maid) said: \"I have a matter to represent to thee; after that do whatever (thou wilt) to me.\" And she took up her tale: \"So now whatever thou mayst do to me, thou art great [i.e. thou art the mistress].\" 78. [Woi-Dir\u00e8gh] said: \"Go call [him].\" [The maid] went out [and] called him. Then he entered and saluted [her]. She got up from her couch to [meet] him.

B.\u2014No special mark has been put against the Persian and Arabic forms.\n\nThe Mythic History of the God Vir\u00e1j.\u2014By G. S. Leonard, Assist. Secretary, Asiatic Society, Bengal.\n\nIn giving an account of the god Vir\u00e1j, the deity worshipped in the form of the universal world, and forming one of the ten supernatural beings in the scale of the creative agents, we have to consider him in the three-fold light of history, mythology, and theology, in all of which he makes a conspicuous figure in the original works of India.\n\nThe great variety of discordant accounts found in the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as and elsewhere, regarding the genesis of Vir\u00e1j and his historical and mythological traditions make it extremely difficult to form a correct and distinct idea of his personality, to ascribe to him a definite shape and form, to depict his real figure, like that of any other god in the Hindu Pantheon, and to attain to a knowledge of the doctrines his religion inculcates.\n\nVir\u00e1j, as we learn from the different accounts of his genesis, does not appear to have a prior or separate existence of his own apart from nature, to entitle him to an independent entity or personality. His body, unconfined by any dimensions, cannot possibly admit of any distinct shape or form. And the doctrine taught in the established form of his worship is not composed of the creed of a particular deity, nor professed by a set or sect of people among the numberless schisms of the Hindus, nor is it capable of a distinct delineation.\n\nSo great is the confusion in the gradation of persons, as has been justly remarked by Moore in his Hindu Pantheon, that it presents us Vir\u00e1j in different degrees of relationship to Brahm\u00e1 the creator. Manu mentions him as the offspring of the latter, when the Brahma Vaivarta Pur\u00e1\u1e47a repre-\nsents him as progenitor of the same. He is stated in the Institutes as father of Svayambhuva Manu, while in the Matsya and Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47as we find him identified with the latter. The Brahma Vaivarta again represents him as the offspring of R\u0101dh\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and presents us with a multiplicity of minor Vir\u0101js (Kshudra Vir\u0101\u1e6ds) proceeding from the elder one (Mah\u0101 Vir\u0101\u1e6d).\n\nThe epithet of the first male (\u0100di Purusha) agrees with Vir\u0101j in one place, and with Brahmac in another; with N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a in a third, and with Svayambhuva in a fourth. In one place the hymn addressed to the thousand-headed male (Sahasra \u015a\u012brsha Purusha) agrees with Vir\u0101j, and in another with Brahmac, and elsewhere we find it addressed to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. So his wife Satar\u016bp\u0101 (Centiforma)\u2014a fit epithet for the consort of Sahasrar\u016bpa, milleformis\u2014Vir\u0101j is represented in one place as his progenitrix and wife of Brahmac, and in another as a daughter of the same and consort of Svayambhuva Manu, identified with Vir\u0101j.\n\nNotwithstanding the inextricable confusion, as shown above, in which the persons of Vir\u0101j and his consort are involved, a careful study of the subject and patient inquiry into the mists of fiction, which inseparably attend the character of Vir\u0101j in every theory of the \u015a\u0101stras, will enable us to find the true person of this deity, from the fictitious and pretended ones imposed upon him in sectarian works, each claiming the title for its respective divinity, which it attempts to glorify above the rest. Thus the Brahmites invariably honor Brahmac with that title which the Vaishnavites contend to reserve for their adored Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and the Krishnites of late for their favorite deity, as also for his offspring by R\u0101dh\u0101. While on the other hand the \u015aivites lay a claim to it, not alone for their god but also for his pigmy son Gane\u015ba, the Janus of the Hindus. They also denominate their goddess K\u0101l\u012b by the name of Satar\u016bp\u0101. The M\u0101navites or Adamites do not scruple to call the great ancestor of mankind by that august name, and the great mother of the human race by that of Satar\u016bp\u0101.\n\nIn the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, says Dr. Wilson, \u201cVi\u1e63\u1e47u is said to be the first Purusha or spirit who, in association with Pradh\u0101na\u2014matter, becomes male and female, i.e. active and passive energies for the creation of the world in the egg.\u201d \u201cThis system,\u201d adds he, \u201cis conformable to that anciently maintained as explained in the opening of Manu, substituting Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for Brahmac.\u201d The same sort of reasoning applies in the case of Vir\u0101j also, who is represented, (vide Moore\u2019s Pantheon) to be a biformed being half male and half female, sometimes joined together and at other times in separate forms. In disregard, therefore, of the persons, severally designated with the title Vir\u0101j (for we find not only the other gods but potentates of the earth oftentimes honored with that title), and in exclusion of every consideration respecting the different forms in which he is exhibited, we must satisfy our\ncuriosity concerning him with a bare description of his nature and attributes, according to the import of the word and its definition given in the S\u00e1stras, with an exposition of the system of religion which is promulgated under that name in the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as and the Ved\u00e1nta, together with its analogies in other Asiatic and European systems.\n\nVir\u00e1j, as the word signifies (virajati = regit from the root \u2018rajri\u2019 = regere) means the ever-reigning ruler or sovereign of the universe, be he whoever he may, whose entity is composed of three natures: viz. the intellectual or chaitanya, the spiritual or Vai\u015bv\u00e1nara, and a concrete gross nature, sth\u00fala \u015bar\u00edra, which respectively constitute his omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence throughout the utmost bounds of existence. He is also considered as Vi\u015bva constituting the individual souls of the Vi\u015bved\u00e9v\u00e1s or different orders of gods or supernatural beings which subsist in him, and is sometimes represented as Mah\u00e1 = magnus or Kshudra = parvus in the relation of father and son, as he fills a greater or lesser sphere, the whole universe or a part, and both of the same nature and properties.\n\nSuch being the import of the word according to its definition, Vir\u00e1j proves to be the lord of the universe coeval with its creation, but whose essence, instead of dying away with the dissolution of the material world, as the Pantheist says, will continue for ever with the entity of its divine origin to all eternity. He proves also, from the joint testimony of the S\u00e1stras given in the following pages, to be the automaton or moving principle of the visible world, whose body, as the poet figuratively expresses it, \u201cis nature, and whose soul is god.\u201d He may be called both great and small, agreeably to our conception of him presented to our enlarged or limited faculties; and as infinity is beyond the conception of a finite being, we, for the sake of meditating on his nature, can assign to him a greater or a lesser magnitude of a whole or part, according to the powers of our understandings, for he is \u201cas great in the earth as in the ethereal frame.\u201d\n\nThe form of Mahavir\u00e1t is no more than the macrocosm of European philosophers, which comprehends the whole of the visible world, and the Kshudra-vir\u00e1t agrees exactly with the microcosm of metaphysicians, which Dr. Reid, like the Ved\u00e1ntists, applies to Man or Manu who is an aggregate of the intellectual and physical natures of Vir\u00e1j. The obvious manifestation of the deity in the face of nature, though of itself evident to the meanest understanding from every object of creation by which on all sides we are beset, is yet so mystified by the reveries of theologians, and the rhapsodies of philosophers on the one hand, and so diversified by the discordant descriptions of poets and obscured by the conflicting accounts of mythologists on the other, that this confused chaos of abstract mysticism of the Ved\u00e1nta, and the contradictory myths of the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as would well nigh destroy each other, and leave a void in the belief of the Vir\u00e1jian religion, as it has\nalready done in the minds of the vulgar and ignorant, had not the irresistible light of natural theology showed its superiority over every other scheme of religion to the saints and sages of all ages and countries, and preserved its relics among the learned and superior classes of the Hindus. The truth of the self-manifestation of the deity in the universe forms the pith and marrow of the Vir\u00e1j\u00edan doctrines, (Vir\u00e1dmata) and is in unison with the true, rational, and natural religion of all mankind, whether deduced \u00e0 priori from a pre-existent cause to his work, or inferred \u00e0 posteriori, from the works of nature to a superintending agent.\n\nThe deduction of Vir\u00e1jism from its fountain head of Brahmin by the analytical method pursued by the Ved\u00e1nta like all other ancient schools, is not only too abstruse for common comprehensions, but too intricate and mazy on account of its concatenation of causes and effects to several successive steps or gradations of being. I have therefore followed the modern method of induction in the investigation of Vir\u00e1jism as it is presented to us, and then attempted to resolve it to the main source whence it sprung. \"The world subsists in and is the abode of God,\" is a main tenet of the Vir\u00e1j\u00edan theology; and the universe like a mirror not only reflects God's image, but refracts it to every observer in it. The want of such a display of divine attributes either in the works of nature before us, or in the construction of our intellectual, mental, and bodily faculties, would undoubtedly lead us to form a very different ideal of divine nature\u2014different from the light of nature, and therefore of truth, and as different from each other as those propagated by the false dogmas of pretended revelations, and as various and uncertain as those introduced by the endless speculations of philosophers. A religion or system of doctrines teaching the mysteries of divine nature inconsistent with the light of nature, may seem too grand and sublime to common capacities, too amusing to the speculative, and may be also very good in the abstract, but it can neither appeal to our comprehensions unless justified by the light of nature, nor be of practical use to us, unless it appeal to our own natures and the nature of things. The pure mysticism of the Ved\u00e1nta and Sifism, and the ideal spirituality of a Plato, a Berkeley, and others, may be suitable to intellectual and spiritual beings of higher orders placed in other spheres as cherubs, seraphs, and other denominations of the holy choir; but a being of this material world, confined to this sublunary sphere, requires a religion adapted in every sense to his comprehension and well suited to his nature, as that inculcated by the Vir\u00e1j\u00edan or natural theology.\n\nThe admirable Sir W. Jones has given us an extract of European theology from the writings of the illustrious Mr. Neckar which I shall quote in this place as best calculated to give a just idea of the Natural theology of Vir\u00e1j in the glowing language of a modern philosopher. \"Considering themselves as an emanation from that infinite Being, they\nwould cherish the idea of a God, who created, who regenerates, who preserves this universe, by invariable laws, and by a continued chain of similar causes, producing similar effects, who pervades all nature with his divine spirit, as an universal soul, who moves, directs, and restrains the wonderful fabric of this world. The blissful idea of a God sweetens every moment of our time, and embellishes before us the path of life; unites us delightfully to all the beauties of nature, and associates us with everything that lives or moves. Yes; the whisper of gales, the murmur of waters, the peaceful agitation of trees and shrubs, would concur to engage our minds and affect our souls with tenderness, if our thoughts were elevated to one universal Cause, if we recognised on all sides the works of Him whom we love, if we marked the traces of his august steps and benignant intentions, if we believed ourselves actually present at the display of his boundless power, and the magnificent exertions of his unlimited goodness.\"\n\nI am confident that the S\u00fafi and Ved\u00e1ntist would consider this rhapsody as an epitome of their common system, for they concur in believing the Spirit of God to pervade the universe, and to be always immediately present in his works, and consequently always in substance, and the souls of men (jiva) though differing infinitely in degree, yet not at all in kind, from the divine Spirit of which they are particles in which they move, and in which they will be ultimately absorbed.\n\nThe ubiquity of the divine Soul containing the grand arcanum of the Ved\u00e1nta and S\u00fafi theologies, is the invariable theme of oriental poetry and philosophy, for when the Veda says \"He is in and yet out of all\", it fully agrees with the Urd\u00fa poet Mir Hasan in maintaining his spiritual presence in all material bodies, yet different from all matter:\n\n\"He is neither in the stone nor in the gem,\nYet shines alike in every hue the same.\"\n\nAnd while the Ved\u00e1ntist in his ecstacy beholds everything as an image of his Maker, the S\u00fafi, in his religious rapture, sees nought but the essence of his God spread all around him.\n\nBut the advocates of Pantheism are apt to construe the inseparable union and diffusion of the essence of Vir\u00e1j over the material world, whether exhausted or unexhausted in nature, as a real, material, and physical pantheism, and the untangible universality of Vai\u015bv\u00e1nara (\u0396\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2) the vivifying and animating soul of the universe, as a spiritual, ideal, and intellectual pantheism. But in the zeal of maintaining their favourite theories they entirely forget, that the perfect, immaterial, and incorruptible essence of a spiritual nature, though so closely connected with the material world, as supporting, sustaining, vivifying and moving all its parts for evermore, cannot be assimilated to imperfect, gross, dense, and motionless matter, by its pervasion over the whole, which means but the omnipresence of the\nspiritual essence and not its transubstantiality into matter. For the text says \"The spirit of Vir\u00e1j, presiding over all material forms, is said to be embodied in the shape of the universe, but when that ever wakeful soul is said to preside over individual souls on earth, he is understood as a superintending spiritual substance.\" The Commentary on the above passage states: \"Vir\u00e1j Purusha's filling the world with his substance signifies, his presiding over individual souls in a divine and not material form.\" This explanation proving the spirituality of Vir\u00e1j's essence, keeps him aloof from the charge of materialism.\n\nThe atheistic pantheism of Spinoza maintaining the absorption of the infinite god (Brahm) in nature is entirely ignored by the Vedas, for it has been inveighed against by Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra in the introduction to his English version of the Ch'h\u00e1ndogya Upanishad, where he maintains a Theistic Pantheism by upholding the existence of the finite world in the infinite essence of God. \"Udd\u00e1laka,\" says he, \"instead of supposing with pantheists the absolute consubstantiality of God and Nature,\u2014of God and the whole universe being of one and the same substance\u2014makes the Deity create the universe first, and then shed out as it were, a ray of his light. His doctrine in short, is not the absorption of the infinite into the finite\u2014of God in Nature\u2014but of the finite in the infinite\u2014Nature in God.\" Spinoza with his iron logic has fallen into a downright fallacy by supposing the extinction of the divine essence and personality by their pervasion or diffusion over the universe, because the Veda, granting even the infinity of the universe, declares God is perfect and so is the universe which is derived from him, as a prototype of the divine archtype. The subtraction of the perfect from the perfect leaves the remainder perfect. This doctrine of the Veda though a seeming paradox, is however true of infinite quantities, for if you take infinity from infinity, the remainder is also infinity.\n\nThe terminology of the Vedas using the word emanation for causation or creation, and diffusion and pervasion for omnipresence, as also the use of the ablative case for the instrumental, has oftentimes misled the learned to understand the Ved\u00e1ntic theism as a material pantheism. But the literal acceptation of such grammatical and verbal terminations cannot fail also to bring the charge of pantheism home to the Bible and other sacred writings, where the language is glowing and elevated.\n\nVir\u00e1jism is sometimes liable to the charge of finitism, from not having existed prior to the creation, but being coeval with the existence of the finite world, to which he is said to be subservient as the world is subservient to him. All this is very true, because Vir\u00e1j had no being before the creation of the world, but the Eternal Being that had an existence before creation manifested himself either as Vir\u00e1j or governor of the world after he had created it, or emitted a spark of himself for presiding over it. In the\nformer case it must be infinite and in the latter case it is equally so, being an effluence of the same nature, wherefore he is called Avyaya or imperishable, even after the dissolution of the world.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, Vir\u00e1jism falls under the charge of a third kind of Pantheism, called the Dualistic, ascribing the co-existence of the finite world and its infinite soul, as the passage says \"though Vir\u00e1j is infinite, yet he is inseparably connected with the finite world.\" But this is a false objection raised by materialists, as two co-eternals and co-infinites are impossible in nature, one of them, i.e. the creative power must be anterior to the created object, and united to it in spirit for its government. Hence it is no dualism but monotheism.\n\nAgain Vir\u00e1jism is brought under the charge of materialism from Vir\u00e1j's being the product (K\u00e1rya sar\u00edra) of the partition and combination (pa\u00f1ch\u00ed karana) of the five atomic principles or elementary bodies of the material world, just as the material force of bodies is produced by the union of substance and particles. But it must be borne in mind that the Vir\u00e1j spoken of in the S\u00e1stras as a Purusha or sensible spirit cannot be the result of any mechanical or chemical force: and he is said to be chaitanya or intelligent soul, which can never spring from galvanism or electricity. He is styled the mundane soul, which must be a particle or modification of the eternal, self-existent supreme soul of God (Brahm).\n\nThe multiplicity of divine personages from Brahm to Vir\u00e1j and the plurality of individuals in the person of the latter, viz. a Va\u00efsv\u00e1nara, Vi\u015bvar\u00fapa, and Vi\u015bva, all tend to prove both Brahmaism and Vir\u00e1jism as regular polytheistic systems, notwithstanding their pretensions to simple monotheism.\n\nIn refutation of this charge of polytheism I may mention that the Hindus consider these gradations of divine beings, not as so many independent, self-existent persons, but as modifications of the Supreme being, and entirely dependent and subordinate to him for the purposes of creation and the preservation of the universe. The Hindu never ventures to declare them as all co-eternals or co-omnipotents with the Supreme soul. Therefore if the Christian Trinitarian with his creed of three co-existent and self-independent persons in the triad is viewed as a monotheist, why should not the Hindu Unitarian with his faith in the triads be reckoned so likewise?\n\nAnother objection that is raised against Vir\u00e1jism with any degree of plausibility, is that of idolatry from the representations given of Vir\u00e1j in the Pur\u00e1nas. But is there any possibility of making an idol with a thousand heads, hands, eyes and feet, and whose dimensions are as extensive as nature herself? Does the description of the Being in the Psalms \"whose canopy is the Heaven and whose footstool is the earth,\" amount\nto idolatry? Does the language of the Bible attributing hands, feet, eyes and ears to the Most High savour of idolatry? The answer is no; these descriptions are but figures of speech. In this case I see no cause why this reasoning should not equally apply to Vir\u00e1j. Although I have made many personal enquiries and consulted all the authorities on Hindu Mythology known to me, I have been unable to hear of, or discover, any mention of an image of Vir\u00e1j, with the exception of the colossal figures in the caves of Elephanta, and these are only supposed to represent Vir\u00e1j.\n\nVir\u00e1j worship.\u2014The worship of Vir\u00e1j, like those of the other divinities of the Ved\u00e1ntic Triad, is positively enjoined in the S\u00e1stras as an essential duty of the twice-born or higher classes of Hindus. It is absolutely requisite for every Br\u00e1hman to recite the Purusha Sukta or Purusha Medha Sukta\u2014the Vedic hymn addressed to Vir\u00e1j Purusha\u2014the first male, in his daily rituals, and is as indispensably necessary as the G\u00e1yatr\u00ed, the essence of the Vedas, and the creed of all Br\u00e1hmans, to be repeated in their daily ablutions and worship of Vishnu. There is no Br\u00e1hman, however ignorant he may be, that has not got the G\u00e1yatr\u00ed and the first stanza or at least the first hemistitch of the Purusha Sukt\u00e1 by heart, to be muttered with his sandhy\u00e1s or daily prayers in the morning or evening.\n\nThe Trinities of the Veda and the Ved\u00e1nta being much more concerned with the sacred scriptures and theology of the Hindus, than the other deities connected with their mythology, their worship is consequently confined with the learned few, while that of the other is widely spread among the lower classes of the people. Hence the worship of the supreme Brahm, which in the Vedic ages had been popular among Br\u00e1hmans, was during the Pur\u00e1nic periods, driven to the woods and forests, where it was restricted to religious recluses and ascetics, till it was brought back and its worship re-established among the learned by the celebrated Sa\u00f1kar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya of the Deccan, and lately introduced among the secular Hindu public by the philanthropic R\u00e1mamohana R\u00e1ya, from whom the first Br\u00e1hmya Sam\u00e1j of Calcutta had its origin, and who was the prime mover in the wide and increasing dissemination of the truths of this primeval religion among the educated and intelligent classes of the people.\n\nThe religion of Brahm\u00e1 too, which had been in full force among the ancient Hindus was latterly supplanted by Sivitism from many parts of India. (Vide As. Res., vol. 6.) It was re-established afterwards in the Deccan under the name of Hiranyakarba adoration, until it was entirely suppressed by the zeal of the Unitarian Sa\u00f1kar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, as is mentioned in the Sa\u00f1kara Vijaya of Anandagiri, Chap. XI. It was, however, again revived by M\u00e1dhava \u00c1ch\u00e1rya, under the appellation of Brahma Sampr\u00e1d\u00e1ya or M\u00e1dhv\u00e1-ch\u00e1ri, as Wilson describes in page 87 of his sketches of the \"Hindu Sects.\" The worship of Brahm\u00e1 as god of fire, or Vulcan of the Hindus, still\ncontinues in Bengal, particularly where incendiaries grow frequent. Brahm\u00e1 or Hiranyakarba, says Wilson, is particularly reverenced at Pokhar in Ajmir, and also at Bithur in the Do\u00e1b. Vide id. p. 12.\n\nThe worship of Vir\u00e1j is purely mental, without any visible form, symbol or figure. It was greatly in vogue during the Vedic period, when the Purushamedha and \u00c1vamedha sacrifices were in use, as the Vedas severally attest. At present the god Vishnu, the second person of the \"mythological triad,\" and possessing the attribute of the preservation of the world, is identified with Vir\u00e1j, and worshipped under that name in the Purusha Sukta hymn. The form of Vir\u00e1j displayed in the person of Kri\u015bna, an incarnation of Vishnu, tends also to corroborate this identity. The Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata furnishes us with instances of the manifestations of Vir\u00e1j adored by the P\u00e1ndavas and gods of all orders.\n\nIn the Deccan, and particularly at Berar, there is still extant a Vir\u00e1j-worshipping sect, where notwithstanding the propagation of Hinduism much later than in Northern India, the forms of the ancient and primary modes of worship, with the usages and customs of the Vedic times, are preserved entire from the innovations and changes of the North.\n\nAuthorities inculcating the necessity of worshipping Vir\u00e1j may be quoted in great numbers from different S\u00e1stras, but for fear of tiring the patience of the reader with a recital of mere injunctive precepts without their proper formul\u00e6, I will note but a few to show how explicitly a Br\u00e1hman is enjoined to pay his adoration to that deity from the earliest times, in different S\u00e1stras. Manu says, the recital of the Purusha hymn exculpates a man from every sin.\n\n\"Whoever daily recites the hymn addressed to the Vir\u00e1j purusha, being solely intent upon him in heart and mind he verily pleases the god, and thereby avoids the miseries of life and obtains the heaven of Vishnu afterwards.\"\n\n\"Whoever without recital of the hymn to the Purusha, either bathes or worships Vishnu, all his acts become null and void.\"\n\n\"Whoso worships Vir\u00e1j with recital of the Purusha hymn, and scatters flowers and water upon his offerings, he has verily worshipped the whole universe, with whatever exists or moves in it.\" (Vir\u00e1j being an epitome of the whole.)\n\n\"Whoso offers flowers or sprinkles water with recital of the Purusha hymn, to the gods, he does them full adoration.\"\n\n\"Let men worship Hari, who is without beginning, middle and end, with the Kadvishnu mantra and Purusha sukta hymn, because in the whole Veda there is nothing like these.\"\n\nI give below an abridged translation of a few stanzas of the Purusha Sukta or Universal prayer from the \u0100ranya G\u00e1na of the S\u00e1ma Veda, taken from \"Ward on the Hindus,\" in Vol. I, p. 289.\n\"Possessed of innumerable heads, innumerable eyes, and innumerable feet, Bramha fills the heavens and earth and dwells in the human breast. He who knows all, and whatever was, and whatever shall be, and is separate from all. In his separate state he exists in a threefold form above the universe, the fourth part is transfused through the world. He is therefore called the great being; his command is the water of life. From him proceeded the Virat purusha, He is the source of universal motion; he is not separate from the universe; he is the light of the moon, of the sun, of the fire, of the lightning, and of all that shines. The Veda is the breath of his nostrils: the primary elements are his sight, the agitation of human affairs is his laughter, and his sleep is the destruction of the universe. In different forms he cherishes the creatures, as in the form of fire he digests their food; in the form of air he preserves their existence, in the form of water he satisfies them, in the form of the sun he assists them in the affairs of life: and in that of the moon he refreshes them with sleep. The progression of time forms his footsteps: all the gods are to him as sparks of fire. In the form of fire he cherishes the gods (fire is said to be the mouth of the gods); therefore I bow to him who is the universe; to the gods who dwell in heaven I bow; to the gods who dwell in space I bow; to the gods on earth I bow; to the regent of waters I bow; to the gods who guard the region I bow.\"\n\nThe Ch'h\u00e1ndogya Upanishad, in Section XVIII, adores him in the following form: \"Verily of that All-pervading Soul, the heaven is the head, the sun is the eye, the wind is the breath, the sky is the trunk, the moon is the fundament, and the earth is the feet. The altar is His breast, the sacrificial grass constitutes the hair of His body, the household fire forms His heart, the Ann\u00e1h\u00e1rya-pachana fire forms His mind, and the \u00c1havaniya fire forms His face.\"\n\nThe \u0100ranyak\u00e1 Upanishad describes the sacrificial horse as a form of the Vir\u00e1tpurusha.\n\nManu, in the first chapter of his Institutes, containing both the early Theogony and cosmology of the Hindus, gives the following account of the genesis of the world, and the origin of Vir\u00e1j, as in the translation of Sir W. Jones:\n\nVerse 8. He (Brahm) having willed to produce various beings from his own divine substance, first with a thought created the waters, and placed in them a productive seed:\n\nVerse 9. That seed became an egg bright as gold, blazing like the luminary with a thousand beams; and in that egg he was born himself, in the form of Brahm\u00e1 the great forefather of all spirits.\n\nVerse 10. The waters are called n\u00e1r\u00e1, because they were the production of Nara or the spirit of God, and since they were his first ayana\nor place of motion he thence is named N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or moving on the waters.\n\nVerse 11. From that which is the first cause, not the object of sense, existing every where in substance, not existing to our perception, without beginning or end, was produced the divine male, famed in all worlds under the appellation of Brahm\u00e1.\n\nVerse 13. And from it's (egg's) two divisions he framed the heaven above and the earth beneath, in the midst he placed the subtle ether, the eight regions, and the permanent receptacle of waters.\n\nVerse 32. Having divided his own substance, the mighty power, became half male, half female, or nature active and passive, and from that female he produced Vir\u00e1j.\n\nVerse 33. Know me, O most excellent of Br\u0101hma\u1e47s to be that person, whom the male power Vir\u00e1j, having performed austere devotion, produced by himself; Me the secondary framer of all this visible world.\n\nVerse 34. It was I, who, desirous of giving birth to a race of men, performed very difficult religious duties, and first produced ten Lords of created beings, eminent in holiness.\n\nVerse 35. Marichi, Atri, A\u1e45giras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Cratu, Prach\u00e9tas or Daksha, Vasishtha, Bh\u1e5bigu, and N\u00e1rada.\n\nVerse 36. They, abundant in glory, produced seven other Menus, together with deities, and the mansions of deities, and Maharshis or great Sages unlimited in power.\n\nVerse 51. He, whose powers are incomprehensible, having thus created both me and this universe, was again absorbed in the supreme Spirit, changing the time of energy for the time of repose.\n\nVerse 52. When that power awakes (for, though slumber be not predicable of the sole eternal Mind, infinitely wise, and infinitely benevolent, yet it is predicated of Brahm\u00e1 figuratively, as a general property of life) then has this world its full expansion; but when he slumbers with a tranquil spirit, then the whole system fades away.\n\nVerse 53. For, while he reposes as it were, in calm sleep, embodied spirits, endued with principles of action, depart from their several acts, and the mind itself becomes inert.\n\nVerse 62. Sw\u00e1r\u00f3chisha, Auttami, T\u00e1masa, Raivata likewise and Ch\u00e1cshusha beaming with glory, and Vaivaswata, child of the sun.\u201d\n\nThis account of the creation and the creative powers employed in the process, very nearly corresponds with the description of the creation given in the opening chapter of the book of Genesis, with the slight reversion of the creation of water before that of heaven and earth, which in the Mosaic account is described as increate, as chaos itself. \u201cThe Spirit of God moved on the waters\u201d agrees almost verbatim with the words of the Bible\nwa-r\u00fah eloh\u00edm merahhefet 'al-pen\u00e9 tehom. The spiritual essence is the first development of the divine soul (Brahm), that which is, filling all infinity and existing from eternity. All Sanskrit authorities from the Veda to K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa speak of water as offspring (nara s\u00fanav\u00e1,) or first creation (Srish-tir\u00e1dy\u00e1) of the Spirit of God, which is thence called N\u00e1r\u00e1yana, Vishnu, Jalas\u00e1yi, &c., producing the mundane egg within the waters of the deep. This person of the Godhead agrees with the Holy Spirit of the Scriptures, who begat the mundane egg in the womb of the watery abyss, as Milton describes in Books I and VII, of his Paradise Lost.\n\n\"\u2014\u2014\u2014 with mighty wings outspread,\nDove-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss\nAnd mad'st it pregnant.\n\n\"\u2014\u2014\u2014 but 'on the watery calm'\nHis brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,\nAnd vital virtue infused and vital warmth,\nThroughout the fluid mass.\n\nThe next person is the first-begotten by the Spirit of God under the names of Brahm\u00e1, Hiranyagarbha, S\u00fatr\u00e1tma, &c. He is mentioned as the first male, and described as the creator of everything that was created. This person of the Godhead agrees with the \"only begotten Son of God\", or rather of the Holy Ghost, as we read in Matthew, \"for that which was conceived in her, is conceived of the Holy Ghost.\" He is spoken of by John the evangelist as the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 = Word, and Creator of all things. \"In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.\"\n\nHence the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 is regarded by Platonising Christians as one of the Demiurgic authors of the world, an agent or Aeon, employed by the Supreme Deity in the creation of the universe like Brahm\u00e1, although the majority of Christians will have the \"begotten Son\" to be co-eternal with the Father. The last person of the godhead\u2014Vir\u00e1j, must, according to the Bible, be either the image of god \"in which created he him,\" i.e. Adam or Adima, agreeing with Svayambhuva Manu, the first man according to the Matya and the Padma Pur\u00e1nas.\n\nThe authorities next in importance to Manu are those of the Pur\u00e1nas, which contain the historical, legendary, traditional, and mythological accounts of the Hindus, and which are invariably consulted by them in all matters concerning history, polity, law, jurisprudence, morality, and religion. The Pur\u00e1nas, however, are so blended with myths, fables and fictions, that it is hardly possible to separate truth from falsehood. The preceding account by Manu is sufficient for all purposes, as on the authority of the\nVedas it is said to be uncontrovertible, and no authority contrary to it is to be deemed valid.\n\nThe Brahma Vaivarta, a comparatively recent and Vaishnavite Purana in which Krishna is extolled above all other gods, and identified with Narayana, makes Mah\u00e1 Vir\u00e1j the offspring of that god by his consort R\u00e1dh\u00e1 in Goloka, and progenitor of Brahm\u00e1, Vishnu, Siva, and other gods. (Vide Aufrecht's analysis of the said work for his account of Viraj, \"Radhae filius Krishnae pars sedecima et ejus progenies.\")\n\nThe following account of the nativity of Vir\u00e1j is given in the third chapter of the Prakriti Khand\u00e1 of the said Purana:\n\n\"The egg remained in the water a whole age of Brahm\u00e1, and then on a sudden it burst into twain, from which issued forth an infant bright as millions of suns, a suckling babe, crying with hunger. The lord of the world being thus exposed in the water like a child abandoned by its parents, looked upwards like a helpless orphan. He the Great Vir\u00e1t, then swollen in bulk, more than the bulkiest object, became huger than the hugest body, in the same manner as an atom which on the one hand is minuter than the minutest particle, forms the hugest body on the other. He was the receptacle of innumerable worlds, he seemed the Great Vishnu in his nature, and was a sixteenth part of the essence of Krishna. Every pore of the hairs on his body exhibited a world of worlds, which Krishna himself was unable to number. For it may be possible to count the grains of sand on earth, but not the worlds, the Brahm\u00e1s, Vishnus, and Sivas, that grew in his person. His body was composed of the universe stretching from the highest Empyrean to the lowest Tartarus, and called the mundane egg, with Brahm\u00e1, Vishnu, and Siva contained in it.\"\n\nThe same Purana gives us two other accounts of the different minor or Kshudra Vir\u00e1jes, one of whom was born in a pore of hair in the body of the major and the others in every world which appeared in the pores of hair upon him. The seventh chapter of the said Purana, describes the formation of the earth from the body of Vir\u00e1j, in contradiction to that of Madhukaitabha as Aufrecht mentions. \"Terra ex illuvie, quae in corpore Vir\u00e1jis in aqua stantis adhaerebat, orta est.\"\n\nThe Matsya Purana, which has been analyzed by Aufrecht in No. 95, of his Catalogus Codicum Sanscriticorum, gives the following account of Vir\u00e1j in the third chapter.\n\n\"De creatione a Brahmane facta. Cui ut S\u00e1vitrim sive Satar\u00fap\u00e1m undecunque intueretur, quatuor (immo quinque) facies oriuntur. Eorum filius Manu Sv\u00e1yambhuva (aliis nominibus Vir\u00e1j sive Adhip\u00farusha appellatus) nascitur, a quo reliqui Manues descendunt.\"\n\nThat \"Brahma the creator took S\u00e1vitr\u00ed or Satar\u00fap\u00e1 for his wife, who bore Svayambhuva Manu, who was also called Vir\u00e1j or the First Male, and\nfrom whom the other Manus had descended.\" That \"He the Great Brahm\u00e1\" divided his person in twain and became half male, and half female. This female was severally called by the names of S\u00e1vitr\u00ed, Satar\u00fap\u00e1, G\u00e1yatr\u00ed, and Brahmani. That \"the soul of the world, i.e. Brahm\u00e1 passed a long time with her and in process of time begat Manu, who is likewise called Svayambhuva and also Vir\u00e1j the first male.\" And that he on his turn produced fourteen others Manu, Svarochisva, &c., who had the patronymics of Vair\u00e1j\u00e1s or Svayambhuvas given to them. I omit giving the other accounts relating to the creation in this Pur\u00e1na, as they coincide in almost every particular, except in the gradation of persons, with the account given by Manu.\n\nThe third chapter of the Srishti Khand\u00e1 of the Padma Pur\u00e1na also corroborates the account given in the Matsya Pur\u00e1na, with regard to the identity of Vir\u00e1j with Svayambhuva Manu springing from Brahm\u00e1, and taking Satar\u00fap\u00e1 to wife. Thus Brahm\u00e1 then produced from his essence Svayambhuva Manu identical with himself, who became king for the preservation of the universe, and begot a sinless girl named Satar\u00fap\u00e1, whom Svayambhuva took as his wife.\" In this Pur\u00e1na Brahm\u00e1 himself is said to have produced the other Manus, viz., Brigu, Pulastya, Pulaha, &c., and not through Svayambhuva Manu as stated in the Institutes or the Matsya Pur\u00e1na. But there is no mention here by whom he begot them. It mentions, however, of Brahm\u00e1's creation of another supernatural being before that of the Manus, who was called Rudra, and who was as brilliant as the midday sun, and had a formidable and bulky body, half male and half female. This person can be no other than Vir\u00e1j, though he did not propagate the Manus as his race. Rudra is another name for Siva, who is acknowledged by the S\u00edvites as Vir\u00e1j in the Rudray\u00e1mal\u00e1 Tantra. In the Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, Vishnu is said to be the first purusha or spirit, who with association with pradh\u00e1na matter, becomes male and female for the creation of the world in the egg. This Vishnu, says Wilson, is the same as the Brahm\u00e1 of Manu which can never be the fact, as it is the popular belief, supported by the best authorities that Vishnu is identical with Vir\u00e1j.\n\nThe great epic Mah\u00e1bharata presents us with two striking instances of the manifestations of Vir\u00e1j and Vi\u015bvar\u00fapa in the person of Kri\u015bna, who had given himself out to be an incarnation of N\u00e1r\u00e1ya\u1e47a, Vishnu, or Vir\u00e1j. In chapter 130 of the Udyoga Parva, he is mentioned to have assumed the first form, in order to intimidate the haughty usurper Duryodhana, who had plotted to arrest his person. \"Think not oh! foolish prince,\" said he, \"that I am alone:\u2014the Suns, furies, Vasus and Rishis all accompany me. Thus saying he laughed aloud when lo! unnumbered spirits like flashes of lightning issued forth from his resplendent body. Brahm\u00e1 appeared as burning on his forehead, and the Rudras shone forth from within his breast.\nOn his right arm were seated the ruling divinities of the world, and his countenance exhibited the images of Agnis, Adityas, Vasus, S\u00e1dhyas, Indras, \u00c1\u015bvinas, Maruts, and Vi\u015bvedev\u00e1s, or all orders of deities, with an innumerable train of Yakshas, R\u00e1kshass, and Gandharvas. Arjuna, holding his bow and deadly darts, stood on his right hand, and Baladeva with his plough on his left. The sons of P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0du appeared seated on his back, and his front showed the mighty warriors of the Vrishni and Andhara races. In his palm he held the discus, club, \u015bakti, and other weapons. When behold! sparks of living fire, mixed with fume and smoke fled on all sides from his nostrils, ears, eyeballs, and the pores of his body. The assembly of mighty monarchs closed their eyes from fear, at the sight of the terrific cosmoform of Krishna. All were seized with fear save the sages, Rishis, Bh\u00edsha, Drona, and Sanjaya, who remained fearless because of their faith in the godhead of Krishna, who had favoured them with clairvoyance [divya-chakshu].\u201d\n\nSo in the Bhagavad-Gita\u2014\n\n\u201cThe mighty compound and divine being Hari, having, O R\u00e1j\u00e1, thus spoken, made evident unto Arjuna his supreme and heavenly form; of many a mouth and eye; many a wondrous fight; many a heavenly ornament; many an up-raised weapon; adorned with celestial robes and chaplets; anointed with heavenly essence; covered with every marvellous thing; the eternal God whose countenance is turned on every side! The glory and amazing splendour of this mighty being may be likened to the sun rising at once into the heavens, with a thousand times more than usual brightness. The son of P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0du then beheld within the body of the God of Gods, standing together, the whole universe divided forth into its vast variety. He was overwhelmed with wonder, and every hair was raised on end. He bowed down his head before the God, and thus addressed him with joined hands.\u201d\n\nAnother part of this epic presents us with the macrocosm or Vi\u015bvar\u00fapa of Krishna before the assembled deities and monarchs, in the Sabha Parva on the occasion of the R\u00e1jas\u00faya ceremony of the coronation of Yudishthira. In Wilson\u2019s Religious Sects of the Hindus, page 30, I find Vir\u00e1ja as a name of one of the six qualities of the subtle form of Vishnu or Krishna, and meaning absence of human passions synonymous with Vir\u00e1ga. Instances like this, however, can be multiplied to any amount in proof of the identity of Vir\u00e1j with Krishna and Vishnu, but I think those already deduced are sufficient for the purpose.\n\nIn the Gane\u015ba Pur\u00e1na, Vir\u00e1j is represented as incarnate in the form of Gane\u015ba, the god of the elephant head, for the purpose of destroying a certain demon. In chapter 62, called the Vir\u00e1j-darsana, the following description of Gane\u015ba\u2019s person as Vir\u00e1j is given.\u2014\u201cAs the demon was thus\npondering in himself, he beheld before him the form of Vir\u00e1j, touching the sky with his head, his feet rooted in Tartarus, his ear-holes containing the cardinal points, and huge forests forming the hairs on his body. The orbits of heavenly bodies appeared as circles on his person, and the wide seas looked as drops of sweat on his body, millions and millions of deities sporting on the tips of his fingers and nails, and the fourteen spheres of planetary bodies in the universe revolving in his belly. This being then snatched the demon and killed him in a trice, as children do bugs with their nails.\"\n\nThe Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, which is devoted to Vishnu, represents that god as Vir\u00e1j in the incarnations of Krishna and Baladeva. It says that the gods being persecuted by the demon Ka\u00f1sa complained to Vishnu of their grievances, who, in reply, told them that he will undertake to quell the arch-fiend by assuming his form of Vir\u00e1j in his incarnation of Krishna at Vrind\u00e1vana, and forthwith showed his Vir\u00e1tr\u00fapa, which the gods hallowed and adored.\n\nNow as regards his consort Satar\u00fapa, [centiforma] the female personification of material force [\u00e1kti], as Vir\u00e1j is the male prosooposca of spiritual energy, I have to mention that the words hundred and thousand in the appellations of both are mere metonymies of determinate numbers for indeterminate ones by figure of speech, as both spirit as well as matter can assume an infinity of shapes and forms. This female, in the various authorities quoted above, is sometimes made to represent the wife of Brahm\u00e1, at other times of Vir\u00e1j and lastly of Svayambhuva Manu. But Moore, in his Hindu Pantheon, takes her for the wife of Vir\u00e1j purusha only, and says, on the authority of Colebrooke, that the notion of Vir\u00e1j dividing himself into male and female forms occurs almost in every Pur\u00e1na, and the colossal figure in the cave of Elephanta bears relation to this division and re-union of Vir\u00e1j. The partition of the body into male and female halves may very likely lead us to suppose this person to be Brahm\u00e1 whom Manu has represented to be divided into two epicine halves, as also Svayambhuva Manu, the first man or Adam of the Hindus, whose left half, [rib or side] gave birth to the mother of mankind. \"But we know for certain on the authority of Manu that Vir\u00e1j was not the same with his progenitor Brahm\u00e1, nor identical with his progeny Svayambhuva, whom \"D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh\" says Sir William Jones, was persuaded to believe, and not without sound reason, to be no other person than the progenitor of mankind, to whom the Jews, Christians, and Muhammedans unite in giving the name of Adam. Therefore Satar\u00fapa, who is designated by the special title of Rajd\u00e1r\u00edka or wife of Vir\u00e1j, in the Rudra Y\u00e1mala Tantra, could not be the consort either of Brahm\u00e1 or Svayambhuva, as represented in the confused accounts given of her in the different Pur\u00e1nas, the inconsistencies of which are so apparent,\nand the absurdity of identifying a god with a man so evident, as not to require an explanation.\n\nThe perfect coincidence of the description of Rajd\u00e1rik\u00e1 with that of her husband confirms the belief of her being a co-partner of Vir\u00e1j only, as will plainly appear from the following extract:\n\n\"She had millions of Vishnus on her right arm, and a million of Brahmas on her left; a million of Sivas on her head, and as many Indras at her feet. Millions of moons shone in her nails, and as many suns in her eyeballs. Her worshippers addressed her saying 'Save us, Oh! thou source of the world and consort of Vir\u00e1j, that givest birth to millions of Brahmas, Vishnus, and Sivas, in thy hollow bowels.'\"\n\nThe difference of sex in the Hindu deities is assigned to the same reason, which Proclus mentions concerning the Greek and Roman divinities, in Timaeus, p. 290. \"The division of male and female comprehends in itself all the plenitudes of divine orders; since the cause of all staple power and identity, and the leader (\u03c7\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) of being, and that which invests all things with the first principles of conversion, is comprehended in the masculine order. But that which generates from itself all various progressions and partitions, measures of life, and prolific powers, is contained in the female division.\" Here we see all the gods from the supreme being downwards not only having a female energy but inseparably joined with it, as in the person of Adonis in the Orphic hymns.\n\nMention of Vir\u00e1t-kshetra, the site of Vir\u00e1j's nativity, the scene of his incarnation, and the field of his exploits is often made in some of the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as. The Adhy\u00e1tma R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a describes the sanctity of the place in chapter 84, which has been noticed by Dr. Aufrecht under No. 74 of his Catalogus Codicum Sanscriticorum. The Br\u00e1hma Pur\u00e1\u1e47a mentions it to be situated at the confluence of eight streams, as Aufrecht says in p. 19 of the said Catalogue \"ad Vir\u00e1ja regionem, prope octo fluminum confluentem sitam, proficiscitur.\" In the K\u00e1ka-rudra-samv\u00e1da, it is mentioned as contiguous to Chola, Videha, Keral\u00e1, &c., and to be under the constellation Sagittarius, with K\u00e1nch\u00ed, Karn\u00e1\u1e6da, &c. The Vir\u00e1t-bh\u00fami, or land of Vir\u00e1j, is famed in the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as for its production of diamonds which are thence called Vir\u00e1taj\u00e1s, and which justifies the supposition of its being situated near Golconda, celebrated also for its diamond mines. The place in the modern Geography of India is Berar, in the Deccan, and is called Ber\u00e1r, Borar, and Bor\u00e1\u1e0d, by the natives, and there is every reason to suppose this district to be the birth-place of Vir\u00e1j, and more so, from the indisputable fact of the origination of all the early incarnations of Vishnu having taken place in the Deccan, then known as the land of demons. The Vir\u00e1t-bh\u00fami is also called the Matsya-desa, or fish country, in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, an appellation which the inhabitants of Bagur\u00e1 (Bogra), a district\nin the north of Bengal, claim for this tract of land, because its streams teem with fish.\n\nThe accounts of the origin of the world, with those of its creative agencies, and created bodies given both by Manu and Moses, are mere allegories of the natural order of things, which require some explanation. In the chaotic state of things there existed only the eternal and infinite soul of god [Brahm] filling all the 'toh\u00fa wa-bok\u00fa', the null and void, and overspreading the whole with the immoveable, inactive, and all-pervading essence of his inscrutable nature, his entity and intellect the source of power. For knowledge, says the father of modern philosophy, is power, and infinite knowledge therefore must be the fountain of infinite power. He, wishing to create the world, first created the air, represented as the first development of the all-encompassing soul in the form of the spirit, the main source of motion and force, to give mobility to inert substance. To this followed the production of water, the atomic principles of which are conceived in the bosom of ether, which being agitated by the force of air or spirit of \"N\u00e1r\u00e1yana,\" conceived the latent heat, represented as Brahm\u00e1 or god of fire within its bosom. This heat in its turn gave birth to Va\u00edshv\u00e1nara the vivifying fire. And lastly the combination of the triple principles of the spirit, gave birth to the mundane egg, or rotundity of the material world, which came next to be manifested in its present form which we call Vir\u00e1j. How far these theories of the Ancient Hindus are correct according to the light of physical science and modern experimental philosophy I am unable to decide, but I am confident that some of them agree with the theories of the Grecian philosophers on the origin of the world. Thales, for instance, regarded water or fluid substance as the single original element from which everything came and with which everything returned. Anaximenes derived the origin of all material things from a single element, and according to his theory air was the source of life. Heraclitus of Ephesus regarded fire as heat as the primary form of all matter, and Anaxagoras of Clazomen\u00e6, conceived a supreme mind or intelligence (no\u00fbs) distinct from the visible world, to have imparted form and order to the chaos of nature.\n\nThe Ved\u00e1nta holds Vir\u00e1j to be the result of Pa\u00f1chikarana or assemblage of the five elements, which for the sake of brevity I will quote from Ward's translation of the Ved\u00e1nta S\u00e1ra, Vol. I, p. 371.\n\n\"From the five subtile elements proceeded the subtile bodies. From these five subtile elements in proportions of five, arose the masses of solid matter; but each is distinguished by the name of the element which is most prevalent. In the solid mass of ether sound is found; in air is found both sound and touch; in fire sound, touch and form; in water, sound, touch, form, and taste; in earth, these four and smell. The qualities are\npartly natural and partly artificial. The active principle dwelling in the collected sum of solid matter is called Vaisv\u00e1nara, or he who is conscious of self-existence, and Vir\u00e1j as he is held forth, or displayed in all creatures.\"\n\nBut as the being under investigation is to be considered more properly as an intellectual and spiritual person or the sensible emblem of an ideal being, rather than any real personage of history, his nature and character are to be sought for more in works of philosophy, theology and divinity, than in any other, and we must therefore explore the Ved\u00e1nta, the only metaphysical and theological school of the Hindus, for a true account of this supernatural being. It conceives three orders of incorporeal natures in the chain of beings from the supreme to the human soul. The first consisting of pure intelligence (chit) composed of the causal principles of nature called K\u00e1rana Sar\u00edras. The second of intellectual beings [chetasas] composed of subtile spiritual bodies called \u015a\u00edkshma or linga Sar\u00edras. And the third comprised of intelligent beings [chaitanyas] joined with concrete, gross or material bodies called Sth\u00fala Sar\u00edras, in which Vir\u00e1j the god manifest in nature is included. Another definition of the demiurgic triads will have the last to be the product or K\u00e1rya Sar\u00edra; the second, that by which it is produced, linga sar\u00edra; and the first, that from which the thing produced, takes its pattern, i.e. the K\u00e1rana Sar\u00edra, depicting them under the analogy of the archetype, architect, and the offspring, in which last position Vir\u00e1j is taken to stand, who therefore is understood to participate of the entity and omnipresence [the chief attributes of the eternal and infinite soul] as far as he extends throughout the duration and bounds of nature.\n\nTo give a description of the theogony of Vir\u00e1j, among the other persons of the triads, or, in other words, to show the distinction of that state of the divine soul from the other conditions, and the relation it bears to them in the order of succession, would require an exposition of the whole theodecy of the Ved\u00e1nta system, which would be out of place here. I shall therefore content myself with giving a short account of these different degrees of divine personages, or rather the several denominations of these spiritual and psychological beings, in order to show the relation they bear to Vir\u00e1j according to what I could gather about them, from the translation of the Ved\u00e1nta S\u00e1ra by Ward, Colebrooke's Essay on the Ved\u00e1nta, and R\u00f6er's translation of the Upanishads.\n\nThe first order composed of pure intelligence (chit) and possessed of causal form (K\u00e1rana Sar\u00edra) and having the quality of purity or goodness only (Satva), is comprised of three persons according to the general or particular modifications of these properties, styled totality (Samashti), and speciality or individuality (vyashti), in Ved\u00e1nta terminology, vis.:\u2014\n1st.\u2014Brahm, omnipresence or the unlimited essence of god in duration and space; called also turiya or quadruple, for its being the receptacle of the three orders and human soul (jiva).\n\n2nd.\u2014Praj\u00f1\u00e1, omniscience, i.e. intellect or understanding devoid of action, whence it is termed inert (niskriya).\n\n3rd.\u2014I\u015bvara, omnipotence, the active principle, or creative agency and causality of god.\n\nThe second order composed of intellectual beings (Chetanas) possessed of subtle spiritual bodies (sukshma linga sarira) and having the quality of passion or affection (rajas,) comprises the three persons of\n\n1st.\u2014S\u00fatr\u00e1tma, the undivided spirit or connecting soul of all subtle bodies, as Pope expresses it; \u201cDiffused through all, yet in all the same.\u201d\n\n2nd.\u2014Hiranya-garbha or Brahmad, the creator of the Universal frame.\n\n3rd.\u2014Taijasa, the spirit united with the mind in intellection.\n\nThe third order composed of intelligent beings (sthula Sariras) possessed of concrete and gross bodies, and having the quality of foulness (tamas) is also comprised of three persons, according to the universality or individuality, manifestation or reticence.\n\n1st.\u2014Vai\u015bv\u00e1nara, the universal soul latent in all bodies, as their prime automaton or moving principle and allied to material force.\n\n2nd.\u2014Vir\u00e1j, the mundane soul obvious in nature as her formal cause.\n\n3rd.\u2014V\u00ed\u015bva, the individual soul abiding in every gross body.\n\nAnd lastly Jiva, the human soul endued with life and sensation.\n\nWard, in his translation of the Ved\u00e1nta S\u00e1ra, gives the following descriptions of these persons in the Godhead belonging to the threefold triads of the Deity:\n\n\u201cThe active principle dwelling in the collected sum of solid matter is called wishw\u00e1nara or, he who is conscious of self-existence, and Vir\u00e1t, as he is held forth or displayed in all creatures, &c.\u201d\n\nColebrooke, in speaking of them, begins with the last [J\u00edv\u00e1tma], and says, \u201cThe soul [as a portion of the divinity] is infinite, intelligent, sentient, and true. It is made to act by the supreme Being, but in conformity to its previous resolutions: and those again have been produced by a chain of causes extending backward apparently to infinity.\u201d [Vide Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. II, p. 22.]\n\nDr. R\u00f6er, in the introduction to his translation of the Taittir\u00edya Upaishad, gives the following compendious sketch from the Ved\u00e1nta S\u00e1ra.\n\n\u201cThe cause of the world, according to Ved\u00e1nta, the source of all reality, and strictly speaking of all reality itself, is Brahm, the supreme soul or spirit.\u201d \u201cIt consists of the three qualities of satva, rajas, tamas, which denote the three degrees of its existence, or of its power of manifestation, &c.\u201d \u201cGod in his relation to the totality of ignorance is omnis-\ncient, omnipotent, &c., that is, he has all the attributes of the Creator and ruler of the world, and is called in this respect Y\u00e1vara [the ruler]\u201d. \u201cGod in his relation to special ignorance is the individual soul, the defective intelligence Praj\u00f1\u00e1.\u201d \u201cHere again, the subtle body is either a totality or an individuality. The soul or god as pervading the totality, is called the S\u00fatr\u00e1tma or Hiranyagarbha, as pervading an individuality, and Taijasha [the resplendent]. Both, however, are in reality one.\u201d Again, \u201cFrom the subtle elements further proceed the gross elements, and from the gross elements the different worlds and different bodies &c.\u201d \u201cThe soul as abiding in the totality of gross bodies is called Vai\u015bv\u00e1nara, Vir\u0101t, &c., as abiding in an individual body Vi\u015bva.\u201d The definitions of some of these modes of the divine soul are differently given in different works, as for instance the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dukya Upanishad describes Pr\u00e1j\u00f1\u00e1 as omniscience instead of ignorance, as stated in the Ved\u00e1nta S\u00e1ra. Thus, \u201cHis third condition is Praj\u00f1\u00e1 [who completely knows] who has become one, whose knowledge is uniform alone, whose nature is bliss, &c.\u201d \u201cHe [the Pr\u00e1j\u00f1\u00e1] is lord of all: he is omniscient, he is the internal ruler, &c.,\u201d [vide idem, verses 5 and 6].\n\nThese quadruple conditions of divine spirit are incased in four different sheaths of the soul, which I give here in the words of Dr. R\u00f6er.\n\n1st. \u201cThe intellect with the internal organs forms the intellectual sheath. 2nd. Mind, with the organs of action, the mental sheath. 3rd. The vital airs, together with the organs of action, for the vital sheath. 4th. The three sheaths when united are the subtle body of the soul &c.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gross body is called the nutrimentitious sheath (Annamaya Kosha), and as it is the place where gross objects are enjoyed, it is called awake.\u201d All these four conditions of the soul are perceptible in four different states of human life, namely, the intellectual, in deep sleep, when the intellects are awake, notwithstanding the dormancy of the other faculties; the mental, in the dreaming state, when the mind acts in absence of bodily functions; the concrete, consisting of Vai\u015bv\u00e1nara, Vir\u0101t and Vi\u015bva, in the waking state, when we perceive all sensible objects by means of external organs.\n\n\u201cThe totality of the gross, the subtle and the causal bodies, forms one great world, and the soul from the pervader to the ruler is one soul.\u201d Hence these triple orders of intelligences, are of the same essence, inasmuch as they are all intellects, admitting only of the difference in point of boundlessness and limitation, otherwise called universality and individuality. They are modifications of the selfsame spirit of god and are equally objects of worship, and that of Vir\u0101t is the most important as the most conspicuous among them. Meditation of these modes of Brahma\u2019s existence is said to be the most rational and profound worship of god, and it is necessary to commence with the mode or state in which reflection first rises, and is concluded with the last result to which that reflection has attained.\nIt may perhaps not be irrelevant here to trace some analogies of the incorporeal natures treated herein, with those met with in European philosophy, although I am far from maintaining that they bear any exact similitude to each other. I find Vir\u00e2jism bears a great resemblance to Stahl's doctrine of Animeism, whose automaton or moving force of the world corresponds exactly with Va\u00efsv\u00e2nara, the other name of Vir\u00e2j, and answers to one of the demiurgoi of Plato, called nature by Lampsacus and the Stoics and Plastic nature by Dr. Cudworth. Vir\u00e2j agrees in some respects with the Arch\u00e6us of Paracelsus, and the Principium Hylarchicum of Henry Moore.\n\nSome are apt to consider these theories, as also Vir\u00e2jism, to be allied to Pantheism, while on the other hand it can plainly be seen, that though the spirit of god is apparent to all as working in the universe, it is essentially separate from it, having had a separate personal existence before it was brought into being, and continuing to have a separate personal existence simultaneously with it. The words of St. Augustine \"in illo sunt omnia,\" could not be construed in a Pantheistic sense, nor could that which Lucan says, \"Jupiter est quodcumque vides, quocunque moveris,\" be taken in that sense. The angel in Genesis [xvi, 7-18] is called 'El r\u00f3\u00ee,' 'God of sight,' or God manifest, and the word Immanuel, God with us, plainly refers to the manifestation of Vir\u00e2j. The mystic doctrine of the Persian S\u00faf\u00eds alludes to the manifestation of divine essence in the whole creation in the words \"there is no real entity besides that of god.\"\n\nThe universality and individuality of the divine spirit, of which it is difficult to derive an idea from their definitions in the Ved\u00e2nta, appear much to resemble the generality or particularity of the psychic fluid, which according to the doctrine of Queene is said to be diffused alike through all nature, but differently exhibited according to the particular organisations of minds and bodies. The Hindu Theism, like every other system of Unitarianism, inculcates the unity, soleity, and monadity of the divinity, as it is well known by its maxim \"Ekamev\u00e2dvit\u00eeyam,\" agreeing with the \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 of the Christians and the hua w\u00e1hid of the Muhammadans, but at the same time it speaks of the persons of the Trinity, only as so many manifestations and denominations of the same being, according to the distinctions of mere modes as maintained by Modalists, and illustrated by them by analogies drawn from nature, as the following: \"Speciem ignis, splendorem et calorem: splendor ab igne nascitur, calor ab igne et splendore generatur. Splendor est de igne, et tamen sunt coeva. Sic tria in sole occurrent; ipsa solis substantia, radius et lumen, et tamen in his tribus est eadem lux: ut radius de sole nascitur, sic Filius de patre generatur, calor ab utroque prograditur, sic spiritus ab utroque spiratur.\" To each of these persons they ascribe a \"character, \u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, hypostasis,\" i.e. \"Complexus notarum quibus person\u00e6\ndivin\u00e6 inter se differunt,\u201d and take into consideration the internal and external relations which they bear to each other.\n\nThe nearest affinity which the Ved\u00e1nta theology bears to any other, is that of Plato, where we have the same number of the orders of Demiurgic principles in the Jovial, Adonical, Dionysiaca! trinities [\u0394\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae, \u1f08\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae], from which many grades and degrees of gods are said to proceed, as the intellectual, supermundane, mundane, &c., but how far they agree with the Ved\u00e1ntic orders is a question which cannot be discussed here.\n\nBefore taking leave of my subject, I will add a few words in anticipation of the charge of Pantheism, which Vir\u00e1jism may otherwise incur from the ubiquity, universal pervasion, and similar attributes of the god. It must be borne in mind that Vir\u00e1j fills the universe in spirit, while Pan the god of Pantheism is represented as filling it in substance, as Dr. Jardine says in his tract on Theism. \u201cThere are those who identify god with the universe, believing that he is immanent in all things, that he is the substance or inherent force which shines forth in the sun, organises the various forces of nature, lives in the animal and vegetable kingdom, and thinks in the human mind. This is usually known by the name of Pantheism.\u201d The Orphic hymn quoted below describes Pan, as materially and substantially diffused in nature like Vi\u015bvar\u00fapa and not in spirit as Vir\u00e1j.\n\n\u201cI call strong Pan, the substance of the whole,\nEtherial, marine, earthly, the total whole,\nImmortal fire; for all the world is thine\nAnd all are but parts of thee, O power divine!\u201d\n\nIn a fragment of Epictetus, we find Chrysippus referring everything to Jupiter, and maintaining a rigid Pantheism in these words, that\u2014\u201cThe world is, as it were, an animated body, and that god is the governing power, and the soul of the whole.\u201d And that \u201cthe world is one of the intelligent principles, governing in common with gods and men.\u201d Diogenes the Babylonian, in his book concerning Minerva, asserts that, \u201cthe world is the same as Jove and comprehends the divinity.\u201d Among the followers of Zeno, many assert this Pantheism, by saying \u201cGod is one, the universe and its soul.\u201d\n\nThe notion of the spiritual diffusion of Vir\u00e1j throughout the whole expanse of nature occurs in the Orphic hymn to Protogonus, the firstborn Aeon, but nothing can be better descriptive of his nature and attributes, than what is given in Pope\u2019s Essay on Man, IX.\n\n\u201cAll are but parts of one stupendous whole,\nWhose body nature is and god the soul.\u201d\n\nAnd in Thomson\u2019s hymn at the end of his \u201cSeasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese as they change, Almighty Father, these\nAre but the varied God, &c., &c.\u201d\nNote on a Copper-plate Grant found in the Record Office of the Cuttack Collectorate.\u2014By B\u0101bu Rangal\u0101la Banerjea, Deputy Collector, Cuttack.\n\n(With a plate.)\n\nThis document was found by me in an old box in the Record Office whilst engaged in drawing up a report on the condition of the records. The box contained a number of old deeds of grants in the Devan\u0101gari, Persian, Bengali, Marhatti and Uriy\u0101 characters; these were the remnants of a vast variety of such documents, said to have been filed by the original holders, before the Collector Mr. Kerr in 1810, when the province was settled for the first time. Up to this day applications are filed before the Collector, for a copy, or for the original, of one or other of these documents. Unfortunately no proper register has been kept with reference to these important records, and there is nothing to shew by whom the plates were filed before the Revenue authorities. The deed is inscribed on three oblong plates of copper, each measuring $8'' \\times 6\\frac{1}{4}''$. The first plate has the inscription on one side only; the second, on both sides; and the third on the upper half of the inner side. The three were originally held together by a ring, for which the plates were pierced, the hole being eight-tenths of an inch in diameter. The ring is lost. The writing is in an antique form of the Ku\u1e6d\u012bla character.\n\nThe record commences with some very prurient poetry, describing the personal charms and Arcadian loves of the nymphs of Ka\u1e6daka, the numerousness of its majestic elephants, the shining whiteness of whose tusks overshadowed the bright autumnal moon, and the freshness and coolness of the gelid breezes which stirred the waves of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b, and allayed the languor of its love-sick maidens.\n\nAfter this exordium the record goes on to state that in the glorious city on the banks of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b, there lived a king named Janamejaya, and from him came a lord of men called Yaj\u0101ti, whose fame had spread over the three regions of the universe, and whose prowess had, without any exertion, subdued his enemies. This panegyric is immediately followed by the well-known royal titles of the Gupta dynasty, adding the word \u201cTrikal\u0101\u1e45gadhipati\u201d (\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0932\u093e\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0927\u0940\u092a\u0924\u093f), or \u201cthe lord of the three Kali\u1e45gas\u201d; the name of Bhava Gupta and that of his successor, literally \u201cthe adorer of his feet\u201d, Siva Gupta are then introduced, and after them follows the mandate of the latter to his courtiers, officers and other subjects to this effect, that he,\nSiva Gupta (not Yajati) gives the village of Chandra in the Bisaya or fiscal division of Marada in the province of Dakshi\u1e47a Ko\u015bala, to one Ga\u1e45ga-p\u0101ni, the son of Div\u0101kara and grandson of Ananta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja clan, for so long as the sun, moon and stars would continue to shine in the firmament. The edict then enumerates a number of S\u0101stric quotations, as usual in such records, cursing the robbers of land given in gift, extolling those who preserve and protect such gifts, and expatiating on the shortness of human life, which is said to be as unstable as a drop of water on the slippery surface of a lotus leaf. The concluding verses are an eulogy on Champati Chhincha\u1e6da of the minister of war and peace of Yajati, (not of Siva Gupta), and then comes the date of the plate and the name of the engraver M\u0101dhava. The date is the 9th of the waxing moon in Jyesh\u1e6dha, on the ninth year or Sa\u00f1vatsara of the reign of Yajati.\n\nThe discovery and decipherment of this plate, establish two hypothetical points advanced by me in my paper on the Chaudw\u0101r plate, namely: 1st, that Orissa, or a part of it, was, during the Gupta rule, called after their mother-country \u201cKo\u015bala,\u201d and 2nd, that the Ke\u015baris of Orissa acknowledged the Guptas as the Paramount Power.\n\nIn support of the first of these two points, we have in unmistakable terms the names of Dakshi\u1e47a Ko\u015bal\u0101 or South Ko\u015bal\u0101 followed by that of the fiscal division of Marada, and the name of the village Chandra. The last two names still exist in the district of Ka\u1e6daka: the pargan\u0101 of Hariharpur is up to this day called in common parlance Marada Hariharpur, and there still exists in that pargan\u0101 a village called Chandra. The latter is written with a final long \u0101, whereas that of the plate is a short one, but the difference is so slight, and such phonetic changes are so very common in Indian names, that it scarcely deserves a comment here. The village is still a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 village of note.\n\nAs to the subordinate position of the Ke\u015baris, the indication in the plate is plain enough. The gift is made in the name of the Guptas with the imperial and dignified designation of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja, while Yajati is simply called Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, and his ancestor Janamejaya, a r\u0101j\u0101 only. The S\u0101stras very distinctly enjoin that it is the sovereign only who has the power of giving land in perpetuity, even S\u0101mantas or tributary kings, when making such gifts, must take the permission of the Paramount Power. The quotations above referred to prove this beyond a question; these mention the names of Sagara and R\u0101ma, the emperors of India, as the givers of land. This law has much relaxed in the present iron-age, despite the injunctions of the Sm\u1e5btis.\n\nA new link in the royal lineages of Orissa is gained by the reading of this monument, and of another which was found under ground in a place called Puran, in Pargan\u0101 Sybir. According to the M\u0101dl\u0101p\u0101nji and the\nVa\u00f1\u015b\u0101valis, Indra Deva or Chandra Deva reigned in Orissa in 328 or 328, A.D. Two or three years before these dates, Orissa was occupied by the Yavanas, who held it for 146 years, after which Yaj\u0101ti Ke\u015bari expelled them, and founded the Ke\u015bari or lion dynasty. This prince was said to have reigned 52 years, and he it was who brought back the image of Jagann\u0101tha to Puri, and laid the foundation of the temple-city at Bhuvane\u015bvara. Now, both these records are silent as to the parentage of Yaj\u0101ti; but here the plates give it in plain terms, stating that Janamejaya was his ancestor, and he (Janamejaya) reigned on the banks of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di, i.e. in Ka\u1e6dak Chaudw\u0101r. This is very probable, as the royal family was expelled from Puri by the Yavanas, who are said to have come in ships and landed near the sacred city. The astrologers of Orissa say that Chaudw\u0101r was founded by Janamejaya the great-grandson of Arjuna one of the heroes of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; but this is evidently a confounding of names, for the plates simply say\u2014\n\n\"\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u091a\u092e\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f \u092e\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0924\u092d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f:\u0964\n\u0928\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0941 \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0923\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0947 \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u0935\u093e\u0915\u0903\u0965\"\n\n\"There was a king of gentle mien named Janamejaya the lotus-faced.\"\n\nIt does not describe him to be the extirpator of the N\u0101ga race, the son of Parikshita, and the lord paramount of all India reigning in Indraprastha or Delhi. The plates simply call him a r\u0101j\u0101, having his chief city on the banks of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di.\n\nIf these surmises be accepted as correct, we have here then the approximate date as to the time when Chaudw\u0101r was founded, namely, the earlier part of the first century of the Christian era, for traditionally Janamejaya was its founder; and he must have been some adventurer from the north-west; the Va\u00f1\u015b\u0101valis are silent as to the father of Ha\u1e6dake\u015bvar Deva, the sixth prince in ascent from Yaj\u0101ti, and presumably Janamejaya must have been his progenitor, for in the Puran plate, we find Bhima Deva was also born in the race of Janamejaya, and this prince reigned in 282\u2014319, A.D. The following is his lineage:\n\n| A. D. | \n|-------|\n| 143\u2014194 | Ha\u1e6dake\u015bvara Deva: reigned 51 years. |\n| 194\u2014237 | Birabhuvan or Tribhuvan Deva: reigned 43 years. |\n| 237\u2014282 | Nirmala Deva: reigned 45 years. |\n| 282\u2014319 | Bhima Deva: reigned 37 years. |\n\nIt is almost superfluous to add here, that the Janamejaya of our plates, is not the Janamejaya Ke\u015bari of the Va\u00f1\u015b\u0101valis: the latter reigned between the years 754\u2014768 A.D., about 250 years after Yaj\u0101ti.\n\nAnother noticeable fact regarding the endowment mentioned in this deed, is the probability of such grants having been made by the person\nunder notice, for, according to the palm-leaf records, this prince was celebrated for his piety and his munificence to Br\u0101hmans, for he it was who rescued his native land from the hands of a foreign foe, restored the worship of Jagann\u0101tha at Puri, and commenced to build the sacred fane for the worship of Mah\u0101deva in Bhuvanesvara.\n\nAs regards the names of places in this plate: at the commencement of the declaration, the endower says that the village of Chandra, in the fiscal division (Vi\u015baya), of Marada, in the country (De\u015ba) of Dakshina Ko\u015bala, is given in perpetuity; but with regard to the grantee, the declaration specifies that he was a Madhyade\u015biya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who came originally from the village of \u015ar\u012bvalla, and was residing at Silabhanjapati, a village in the country of Odra (Orissa). Now the question arises, if the country at the time bore the name of Dakshina Ko\u015bala, which included the fiscal division of Marada, and a village called Chandra; what was the site of Odra whose name occurs separately, as distinct from Dakshina Ko\u015bala? If we recall to mind, however, that the Odra of old was not conterminous with the Orissa of modern days, including the three districts of Ka\u1e6dak, Puri, and Balasor, the difficulty disappears. Odra originally comprised very little, if any, besides the present subdivision of Khurd\u0101. It was the original country of the Od Ch\u0101s\u0101s, and the name Odra was subsequently assigned to the whole tract from the Chilk\u0101 Lake to the Vaitaran\u012b River, and included the names of Kali\u1e45ga, Ko\u015bal\u0101, and Tilkala. We have its parallel in Bengal. Different portions of that province at one time bore the names of Pundravardhana, Gauda, Barendra, Tamralipta, &c., which all gradually gave place to the single designation of Banga, though the latter was but a small portion of the main country in the delta of the Ganges.\n\nThe original country of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a who had the endowment from the royal hands of Yaj\u0101ti Ke\u015b\u0101r\u012b, calls for a few remarks. Dr. Hunter, speaking of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a migrations in Orissa, says: \"The local legends and the palm-leaf records alike relate how about 500 A.D. the founder* of the long-haired or lion line imported ten thousand Br\u0101hma\u1e47as from Audh and endowed them with lands around J\u0101ipur on the sacred Baitarini river.\" But the record under notice and the Chaudw\u0101r one (which is evidently a very old grant) prove beyond a question, that the North-western Br\u0101hma\u1e47as must have migrated to Orissa long before Yaj\u0101ti Ke\u015b\u0101r\u012b, for the plates give the names of three generations of the grantees, the names of their original and adopted countries and villages, &c. This record shows moreover, that the migration was not restricted to Audh Br\u0101hma\u1e47as only. In this case, the grantee belonged to Madhyade\u015ba, which, according to Manu, is the country between the Him\u0101laya and the Vindhyan chain, bound-\n\n* Yaj\u0101ti Ke\u015b\u0101r\u012b.\ned on the east by Pray\u00e1ga (All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d) and on the west by Vinasana (Kurukshetra).*\n\nThe site of Sr\u00edvalla or Valla must be searched for in the North-West for identification, while Silabhanjapati occurs somewhere in Khurd\u00e1. Again, the Br\u00e1hmans not only formed colonies round Jajpur, but had villages given them near Katak Chaudw\u00e1r in Marada Hariharpur, in the subdivision of Khurd\u00e1, during the reigns of the founder of the Kes\u00e1ri dynasty and his predecessors. There is every probability, however, of the Kes\u00e1ris, who originated and sustained the revival of Br\u00e1hmanism in Orissa, having invited Br\u00e1hmans from the North-West, even as their successors the Gang\u00e1va\u00eds brought them from the South; these two distinct streams of migration of the Br\u00e1hmans are now blended together, unlike the K\u00e1nyakubja and Vaidika Br\u00e1hmans of Bengal, who never intermarry nor eat with each other.\n\nThe record is full of orthographical mistakes, but I thought it tedious to note them in detail; the reader will find them by comparing my reading with corrections with the facsimile of the plate. A few of the corrections have been shown in parenthesis.\n\n**Transcript.**\n\n*\u201c\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u094b\u092a\u0947\u0937\u094d\u092f \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0938 \u0938\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0903\u0965\u201d*\n\n*\u201c\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u094b\u092a\u0947\u0937\u094d\u092f \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0938 \u0938\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0903\u0965\u201d*\nOm, be it so!\n\nWhere wanton pleasure is enjoyed to perfection by young people in the play of love's charming sport, with eyes expanded and minds enamoured and centred in love, although the pleasure was at times disturbed by their embraces, which caused horripilation, inarticulate sounds of lips and exhaustion\u2014\n\nwhere lovers of exquisite beauty, desiring to pick a quarrel with their loved ones, mention the beauties of Apsaras and thereby excite their jealousy, and are beaten by the maidens with the lotus of their ears, suffer from excessive internal pain occasioned by the arrows of undaunted Cupid,\u2014and have horripilation from the rising of the thick sweat\u2014\n\nwhere by the shining pestle-like tusks of tall elephants which have made the rising of the moon redundant in dispersing darkness\u2014where the brilliant ornaments of pearl of immoral people and the place of assignation at the top of their house are made exceedingly white\u2014\n\nwhere the lofty waves of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed break each other, and cause bubbles to rise, and the air, carrying the particles of water, refreshes the ladies who have zealously pursued the pastimes of love\u2014\n\n\u2014even there, in that glorious city, there reigned once a king named Janamajaya, whose white canopy of fame had spread over the three worlds, and penetrated the eight quarters\u2014who conquered all his enemies with\n\n* The last three feet of this stanza are missing.\nforce, who always meditated on the image of goddess Bhavya, was opulent, and prosperous, and whose face was as beautiful as the lotus.\n\nHe adorned in every battle the breast of the lady-like earth with pearls issuing from the foreheads of elephants torn asunder by him with his horn-weapon; the (white) dust raised by elephants in the sky and the stream of light of the adorned earth were as brilliant and beautiful as the jewels on the head of the king of gods, and appeared as the emblems of the glory of the king.\n\nThe king Yaj\u00e1ti was his son.

If any man, through intoxication or by mistake, takes or induces another to take with force any land which had been presented by any other person, he takes his birth among beasts and birds, and is tied with the noose of Varu\u1e47a.\n\nShould any man steal a single gold coin or resume land, even a square inch in area, he will dwell in hell until the dissolution of the world.\n\nHe who takes by force land which had been given by him or by any other person, becomes a worm in ordure, and rots there with his ancestors.\n\nThe sun, the moon, the god of water, the god the creator, the god the preserver, the destroyer and fire, praise the donor of lands.\n\n\"This common bridge of virtue ought to be preserved by you evermore\"; R\u0101mabhadra repeatedly begs this of you.\n\nIt ought to be remembered that prosperity and life are as evanescent as a drop of water on a lotus leaf.

S. Leonard, Assistant Secretary, Asiatic Society, Bengal.\n\nB\u00e1bu Prann\u00e1th Pandit in a paper entitled 'Morals of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa,' published in Part I, No. 3, 1876, of the Asiatic Society's Journal, has raised the question of the Monogamy of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa's Heroes, from which Mr. Grierson of Rangpur has dissented, and in support of which opinion he has adduced some proofs. As I quite agree with Mr. Grierson on this point, I beg to produce some further proofs to show that the majority of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa's Heroes practised polygamy.\n\nI begin with Dushyanta, and adduce the following passages from the drama of Sakuntala, in which he is a principal actor, and where K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa the author has not scrupled to declare the polygamy of his hero, like that of the majority of Indian Princes, both in ancient and modern times. In the first place Dushyanta's admiration of the surpassing beauty of the woodland maidens, viz., Sakuntala and her two companions, and his comparing them with\nthe royal dames in his seraglio, plainly enough indicates his having more than one wife at home, thus:\n\n\"Dusha. Oh how charmingly they look! If the beauty of maids, who dwell in woodland retreats, cannot easily be found in the recesses of a palace, the garden-flowers must make room for the blossoms of the forest, which excel them in colour and fragrance.\"\n\nIn the next place we see that Sakuntala's female friends would not consent to her marriage with the king, unless he would plight his faith to love her more than the rest of his harem. Thus:\n\n\"Anusuy\u00e1 (laughing). Princes are said to have many favourite consorts. You must assure us, therefore, that our beloved friend shall not be exposed to affliction through our conduct.\n\nDusha. What need is there of many words? Let there be ever so many women in my palace, I will only have two objects of perfect regard; the sea-girt earth, which I govern, and your sweet friend, whom I love.\n\nBoth. Our anxiety is dissipated.\"\n\nWith reference to the passage \"women in my palace,\" there can be no room for supposing that the royal consorts alluded to, were concubines or sweethearts, as the word parigraha in the text bespeaks them to have been the Prince's partners, by vinculum matrimonii.*\n\nIn the 7th chapter of the story of Sakuntala in the 1st book of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata (and it must be borne in mind that the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata is the ground-work of our poet's drama), Sakuntala makes Dushyanta promise the regency and succession to her issue, should she have any, in preference to those of his other consorts before she would consent to wed him. Thus:\n\n\"Sak. If this be right, then attend to my vow, the son to be born in me must be elected prince regent. If so it be, then let me be joined to thee. Be it so, replied the king, without any deliberation.\"\n\nNothing can be more explicit and plain of this hero's polygamy, than the love ditty of queen Hansamati in Act V, whereupon Dushyanta smiling, says:\n\n\"I was once in love with Hansamati, I am now reproved for continuing so long absent from her.\u2014Friend M\u00e1dhavya, inform the queen in my name, that I feel the reproof.\"\n\nAgain the speech of the chamberlain in the palace garden scene, plainly indicates the hero's plurality of wives.\n\nChamb. \"\u2014\u2014 mistaking the women in his apartments, and through distraction, calling each of them Sakuntala; then he sits with his head long bent on his knees.\"\n\nSiva, the hero of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa's poem Kum\u00e1ra Sambhava, is well known\n\n* The words Avarodha, Suddh\u00e1ntar, are synonymous with \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, zenana, seraglio, and harem, where none but espoused wives are kept.\nto have been a polygamist; for besides possessing Um\u00e1 or Durg\u00e1, K\u00e1l\u00ed and Gang\u00e1, he is known, like amorous Jupiter, to have transformed himself into human shapes to enjoy the loves of a Kochin\u00ed, Bagdin\u00ed, and others. True it is, as B\u00e1bu Prann\u00e1th Pandit says, \"That throughout the seven cantos, there is no mention of the co-wifehood of Gang\u00e1, though that was well known to K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa,\" yet we find that both his consorts K\u00e1l\u00ed and Gang\u00e1 are mentioned by their names in the poem as accompanying their consort in his nuptial procession to Um\u00e1. (Book VII, Verses 39, 42.)\n\nIn the Raghu Vansa, Dilipa's polygamy has been shewn by Mr. Grierson by the word antahpura-varga, which is a mere pleonastic expression used by the commentator for the word avarodha in the text, (B. I, 32) which I give here in full from Stenzler's translation:\n\n\"Rex, et si frequenti gynaeceo gaudebat, hanc feminam prudentem atque Lakshmim praecipuas suas uxores existimabat.\"\n\nThe next hero of the poem, Raghu, from whom it derives its name, is expressly mentioned by the poet to be married to several princesses, nay, as many as stars of heaven, in beauty and number, as is described in Book III, Stanza 88.\n\n\"Deinde, statim post solemnem crinium tonsuram, pater ejus matrimoni\u00ed ceremoniam peregit; atque principium filiae, illum maritum optimum adepta, splendebant sicut Dakah\u00e6 filiae, tenebrarum fugatorii nupt\u00e6.\"\n\nK\u00e1lid\u00e1sa describes Raju's son Aja as a chivalrous Knight competing for svayamvara or marriage election, in which case the poet had no need of narrating his former marriage, mention of which may be found in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, and therefore the question of his polygamy cannot be determined.\n\nDasaratha, the son of Aja and father of R\u00e1ma, is a well known polygamist, as is admitted by B\u00e1bu Prann\u00e1th Pandit, and K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa has had no hesitation in mentioning his numerous wives by their names, and the degrees of their attachment to the King. B. X. Stanzas 59\u201460. Thus:\n\n\"Dilecta ei erat Kausaly\u00e1, amata quoque uxor e Kekay\u00e6 familia orta; ideo rex Sumitram ab utraque honoratam videre optabat.\"\n\nIn short, most princes of the solar race may be shewn to have been polygamists, but as they do not form the heroes of our poet, it is unnecessary for me to give their names.\n\nI have thus shewn by quotations from K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa's works that the majority of his heroes were polygamists. The grounds upon which Prann\u00e1th Pandit appears to build his theory of the monogamy of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa's heroes are shortly these,\u2014The bridal benediction\u2014the great attachment of certain kings to certain queens\u2014and the excessive grief of some of his heroes on separation from their consorts. On these three points I would wish to make a few concluding remarks.\nThe fact is that K\u0101lid\u0101sa was no greater advocate for monogamy than he was for polygamy, nor did he attach any greater importance to the one than to the other, as is evident from the passages cited above, as also from the absence of a single expression in his works, giving preference to the one or other state. The benediction \"Mayest thou gain the undivided love of thy husband,\" the blessing pronounced over Um\u00e1 by the matrons, was only used in conformity with the general mode of well wishing to young brides, though the consummation of the blessing is one which rarely falls to the lot of any woman of this country.\n\nThe poet's description of the greater attachment of a prince to a particular consort, as in the cases of Sudaxin\u00e1 and Indumati, serves only to show the particular honor and regard due and paid to the p\u0101t-r\u0101n\u012b or pradh\u0101n\u0101 mahish\u012b, whose offspring alone was entitled to succeed to his crown and throne.\n\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa's long-winded elegies of woe at the separation of lovers, as in the cases of the heart-rending lamentations of Aja, R\u00e1ma, Rati, and Nala, are only descriptive of the excessive love and fondness that a lover might naturally have for the particular object of his esteem and affection in preference to all others. This can be proved by the following quotation from the poet himself.\n\n\"Nam apum examen, etsi innumer\u012b flores verno tempore florant, pr\u00e6cipua Mangifer\u00e6 adheret.\"\n\nSo also the professed devotedness of the wanton Krishna to Radha, whom he addresses in the following enraptured strain, does not in any way prove the singleness of his love.\n\n\"Thou art my life, thou art my ornament, thou art a pearl, in the ocean of my mortal birth; oh! be favourable now, and my heart shall eternally be grateful.\"\n\nThe frantic lamentations of Pururavas and Dashmanta are but graphic pictures of distracted lovers, and bear no resemblance to the calm and constant love of a monogamist placed in the same circumstances.\n\nThe characters of R\u00e1ma in the Raghu, and Nala in the Nalodaya of the poet, are undeniably pure instances of monogamy, but such exceptions to polygamy are extremely rare.\nNote on Kh\u00e1nj\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n Garh in the District of Bardw\u00e1n, Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-Division, Bengal.\u2014By Gour D\u00e1s Bysack, Deputy Magistrate, late of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nIn the days of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, Bangbara Kh\u00e1n, the founder of Ko\u1e6d Simulg\u00e1\u1e5bh, came to Bengal, and first settled twelve miles south of Bardw\u00e1n in the village of Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d on the banks of the Dam\u00fadar. Many may doubt the authenticity of his advent to this country in the time of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. But from inquiry on the subject we find that Mukanda R\u00e1m Chakravarti, Kavi Kankana, wrote his celebrated work, the Chand\u00ed, during the latter part of Akbar\u2019s reign, i.e., in the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Si\u00f1ha\u2019s rule in Bengal, that this learned poet was a native of the village of D\u00e1muny\u00e1, in the vicinity of Ko\u1e6d Simul, about ten miles north of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, and that he received a sanad from Naw\u00e1b Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n or Kh\u00e1n\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the son of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n. R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Si\u00f1ha ruled in Bengal from the year 1589 A.D., and left this country in the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr (1604 A.D.). It is not likely that Kavi Kankan died immediately on returning to his native village D\u00e1muny\u00e1 from Arar-Brahmana where he composed his Chand\u00ed. It was while he was still living, and most probably after the death of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n, that Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, the son of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n, was dignified with the title of Naw\u00e1b, and was commissioned by the Emperor to rule in this country.\n\nIt has already been said that Bangbara Kh\u00e1n first fixed himself at Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d, but it cannot be admitted as a fact that he was the founder of that village. It is supposed that the village of Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d was either founded by Sulaim\u00e1n, the last but one Afgh\u00e1n king of Bengal, or by some functionary of his. On looking into ancient records we are satisfied that the name of the village has ever been written and read as Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d. If it had been founded by king Sulaim\u00e1n, it was but just to have it called after his name Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d. There is sufficient proof also of its not having been founded in the days of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr (Sal\u00edm). Sulaim\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d was in existence at the time of Kavi Kankan\u2019s composition of the Chand\u00ed. It is written in his work* that the owner of the village of D\u00e1muny\u00e1 was an inhabitant of Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2020 Now the Chand\u00ed was written in the days of Akbar when Bengal was in the\n\n* \u09b8\u09b9\u09b0 \u09b8\u09cb\u09b2\u09bf\u09ae\u09be\u09ac\u09be\u09a6, \u09a4\u09be\u09b9\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09b8\u09c1\u0995\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u099c,\n\u09a8\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09b8 \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u0997\u09c0 \u09ae\u09cb\u09b6\u09bf\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u099c\u0964\n\u09a4\u09be\u09b9\u09be\u09b0 \u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09bf\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09b8\u09bf, \u09a6\u09be\u09ae\u09c1\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09b0 \u0995\u09b0\u09bf\u0995\u09c3\u09b7\u09bf,\n\u09a8\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09b8 \u09aa\u09c2\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09c7 \u099b\u09af\u09bc \u09b8\u09be\u09a4\u0964\u0964\n\n\u2020 In those days one Gop\u00ed N\u00e1th Niyogi was the owner of the village.\nhands of R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n S\u00ednha. If we suppose that this town had been founded in the time of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, we cannot account for its existence in Akbar's days. At the time when the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr sent Qutb-udd\u00edn to kill Sher-Afkan, the first husband of N\u00farjah\u00e1n, one Bangbara Kh\u00e1n by name is said to have assisted him in the atrocious deed. It seems that this person was the progenitor of the Kh\u00e1n family of Ko\u1e6d Simul. On his coming to Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d, he held the office of Tahsild\u00e1r or Collector of Revenue, and commemorated his name by the erection of a mosque* and the excavation of a long tank or jhil. The mosque is now in ruins, and the tank, too, for want of repair, is in a bad state. It is said that after remaining at Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d for some time, he went to Dashghara on the invitation of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2020 of that place. One day he started on a hunting excursion, and by chance reached a jungle on the west bank of the Dam\u00fadar, and here he was charmed with the natural scenery and longed to make it the place of his abode. In accordance with his wish, the whole jungle was cleared within a short time and a dwelling house was built on the spot. This primeval jungle had been full of Simul trees\u2014Bombax heptaphylla. In the current language-Ko\u1e6d means limit; barrier, or surrounding; the village was girdled with Simul trees and hence it was called Simulkot.\n\nTradition has preserved a curious story about the settlement of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n at Ko\u1e6dsimul. When Bangbara came a-hunting from Dashghara, he had a hawk with him. On coming to the forest of Ko\u1e6dsimul, he let loose his hawk to attack an aquatic bird. In a few seconds the hawk was defeated in the contest. The Kh\u00e1n, therefore, thought the place to be sacred, and caused his mansion to be erected there. The early history of our land is full of legends in which it is difficult to distinguish the wheat from the chaff. Nothing in this country, not even the most trivial act or event, such as a migration from one place to another, or the selection of a particular site for a dwelling place, could be done or allowed to occur without invoking supernatural aid; every little circumstance or occurrence must be preceded by some superhuman cause or agency. Similar legends prevail at other places to account for their origin or for their names. This story of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n's selection of his place and abode may have\n\n* It is said that there was in this mosque a stone bearing an inscription, but nobody knows where the stone is or has been removed to. The oldest Muhammadans in and about the Gah assured me that it was removed to the Masjid at Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d, which is near Chakd\u00edgi, eleven miles south of Mi'm\u00e1ri Station. Inquiry was made there, but no trace of the stone could be found. Some people, however, stated that the stone had been taken away from the new Masjid at Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d by one of the Collectors of Bardw\u00e1n; but while at Bardw\u00e1n, and even afterwards, I made careful enquiries, but could obtain no clue of the stone or the inscription it bore.\n\n\u2020 N\u00e1r\u00e1yan P\u00e1l was the R\u00e1j\u00e1 alluded to.\nbeen borrowed from, or given rise to, the legend of the origin of the name of Birbh\u00fam: it will be found that a heron killing a hawk at some spot within that district led to the adoption of the name of Birbh\u00fam; vide Annals of Rural Bengal, Appendix D, page 427. But it is forgotten that Birbh\u00fam is but one of the 12 bh\u00fams* or districts in which part of R\u00e1dha was divided.\n\nTradition has it that after a few years the rule of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n became permanent in this country. The folklore on this point is, that the name of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n appeared on the Imperial coinage of Dihl\u00ed, and his name was beaten in the naubat. The fact is that, under the Muhammadan rule, even subordinate functionaries of the Government tried to assume, and in many cases did assume, independence when they came to the mufassal. And so it happened in the case of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n. It is probable that this Kh\u00e1n taking advantage of favourable opportunities which lay in his way, struck the coin and beat the drum in his own name. For this delinquency he was arrested by an embassy from the Dihl\u00ed Court. The Kh\u00e1n on his way to Dihl\u00ed put an end to his life, it is said by swallowing the diamond of his ring. The Imperial embassy returned to Dihl\u00ed with the dead body of the Kh\u00e1n. The Emperor was touched with remorse on seeing the serene face of the Kh\u00e1n, and asked whether he had any wife and children. The wife of the Kh\u00e1n and his son, then fourteen years of age, were summoned to Dihl\u00ed. On their arrival, the Emperor was moved with pity at the sight of the mother and her son Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, and gave him the title of Naw\u00e1b and deputed him to act in the place of his father. Naw\u00e1b Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, on returning to Kotsimul, caused a moat to be excavated round his mansion, 70 feet in width and 30 feet in depth. The Garh itself measures 1060 feet by 890. There is an entrance on the west side of the moat. The moat is called Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n G\u00e1ph, for it was excavated by Naw\u00e1b Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n.\n\nBangbara Kh\u00e1n was descended of a Sayyid family. His birthplace was Barba, south of Dihl\u00ed, but his descendants have deteriorated to Bengali Musalm\u00e1ns by intermixture with them, though in point of caste the Kh\u00e1ns are still esteemed superior. Tradition also preserves to us the story that Bangbara Kh\u00e1n was appointed Tahsild\u00e1r over the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Dashghara, Bardw\u00e1n, Birbh\u00fam, Bishnpur, M\u00e1yapur, Go\u00e1di-Krishnagar, and Kat\u00e1k. How far there is truth in this assertion it is hard for us at present to determine. No authentic history has yet been found of these several principalities except of those of Bardw\u00e1n, Bishnpur, and Krishnagar.\n\n* 1, Birbh\u00fam; 2, Sainbh\u00fam; 3, Sik'harbh\u00fam; 4, Gopibh\u00fam; 5, B\u00e1manbh\u00fam; 6, M\u00e1nbh\u00fam; 7, Bar\u00e1bh\u00fam; 8, Dhalbh\u00fam; 9, Singbh\u00fam; 10, T\u00fanbh\u00fam; 11, Mal-bh\u00fam; 12, Bhanjabh\u00fam. Vide Blochmann's Geography and History of Bengal, Journal, Vol. XLII, (1873) p. 224.\nPortions of the early account of the Bishnupur r\u00e1j appeared in the Hindu Patriot, when that paper was under the able editorship of the late Haris Chandra Mukerjee, and those numbers of the Patriot furnish the substance of the account given of the r\u00e1j by subsequent writers.*\n\nThe early history of Bengal is clear in regard to the one fact that the Bishnupur r\u00e1j dates from very ancient times, and that it had its existence long before the arrival of the Muhammadans in Bengal. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bishnupur were never subject to Muhammadan rulers. At intervals the Muhammadans invaded Bishnupur, and plundered and ravaged the country. Sometimes they experienced defeats, and fled, leaving behind them all their baggage and treasure in the hand of the victors. This state of things cannot properly be called subjection, and it does not appear probable that the Bishnupur r\u00e1j was within the fiscal jurisdiction of Bangbara Kh\u00e1n.\n\nOn the death of Kh\u00e1naz\u00e1\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, he was succeeded in his office by his son Gardai Kh\u00e1n. After the death of Gardai Kh\u00e1n, we hear of one Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n passing his days at the place as a Zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r and Aimad\u00e1r. In his time the importance of the Bardw\u00e1n R\u00e1j-family was well established, and he was a dependent Zam\u00edn-dar of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bardw\u00e1n, who gave him the title of Chandhuri. It was in the time of Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n that the English got possession of Bengal.\n\nAt the beginning of the English rule, much of the heritage of the Kh\u00e1n family which they had held from the days of the Naw\u00e1b to those of the Chaudhuri, was transferred to other hands. The son of Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n was 'Abdur-Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, on whose death 'Al\u00ed Naq\u00ed Kh\u00e1n became the heir of the family property; he married a daughter of the Musalm\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1g\u00f3r in Birbh\u00fam. 'Al\u00ed Naq\u00ed Kh\u00e1n departed this life at the age of sixty. While 'Al\u00ed Naq\u00ed was still living, the land survey and settlement of Bengal began. At the death of 'Al\u00ed Naq\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, his son Tafazzul Husain Kh\u00e1n was a minor of only four years of age, and on the death of the latter, his son Tasadduq Husain Kh\u00e1n became the heir. He is still living, enjoying his ancestral heritage. He has a little son, but no daughter. It is remarkable and worth noting that from Bangbara Kh\u00e1n to Tasadduq Husain Kh\u00e1n, no one had a brother or a sister. The family has hitherto continued and been represented by a single male scion in each generation, an occurrence as rare as it is singular, nay almost unprecedented in a genealogy consisting of so many as seven or eight generations. Very little is now left for the support of the family. They eke out a bare subsistence from the few acres of land in their possession.\n\n* Vide also Col.

some say that it means the Sun (feminine in Arabic as in German), as the greatest of all the heavenly bodies: others that it is the Milky Way; to me it seems most probable that it means the Heaven, and that the solitude which is spoken of in the first half-verse is further described in the second by saying that the wanderer's only companion on his way is the turning Heaven.\n\nII.\n\n'Amr son of Ma'd\u012b-kerib.\n\n\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u064a\u0632\u0631\n\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0648 \u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u064a\u062a \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\n\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0646\n\u0648 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u062b\u0646 \u0645\u062c\u062f\u0646\u0627\n\u0627\u0639\u062f\u062f\u062a \u0644\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627\n\u0628\u063a\u0629 \u0648 \u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\n\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0630\u0627 \u0634\u0637\u0628 \u064a\u0642\u0647\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u0627\n\u0648\u0639\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0630\u0627\u0643\n\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0643\u0639\u0628\u0627 \u0648 \u0646\u0647\u062f\u0627\n\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0628\u0633\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064a\u062f\u2014\u062a\u062f\u0646\u0645\u0648\u0627 \u062d\u0644\u0642\u0627 \u0648 \u0642\u064a\u062f\u0627\n\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0626 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0649\n\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u064a\u0627\u062c \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\n\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a \u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0646\u0627\n\u064a\u0641\u062e\u0635\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0634\u062f\u0627\n\u0648\u0628\u0646\u062a \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\n\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u062f\u0649\n\u0648 \u0628\u062f\u062a \u0645\u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\n\u062a\u062d\u0641\u064a \u0648 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u0627\n\u0646\u0632\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0643\u0628\u0634\u0647\u0645 \u0648 \u0644\u0645\n\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0632\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0634 \u0628\u062f\u0623\n\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0646\u0630\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0645\u064a \u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0630\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0642\u064a\u062a \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0634\u062f\u0627\n\u0643\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u062e \u0644\u064a \u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d\u2014\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0649 \u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649\nComeliness stands not in brave attire,\nthough thou wrap thyself in a robe of burd:\nComeliness lies in a noble stock\nand valiant deeds that bring renown.\n\nI gathered to meet the chances of Time\na hauberk flowing, a swift strong steed\nStout and hardy, a grooved blade that cleaves\nhelmets and bodies of men in twain:\n\n5 And well I knew that on that day\nI should have to fight both Ka'b and Nahd\u2014\nMen who, when they are arrayed in steel,\nglitter like leopards in leather and mail.\nEach man runs to the battle-stead\nwith what he has gathered ready therefor.\n\nWhen I beheld our women flee\nfurrowing the hard earth as they ran,\nAnd Lemiseh's unveiled face shone as though\nit were heaven's full moon when it rises on high,\n\n10 And all her loveliness, hidden before,\nstood bare to see, and the case grew grave,\nI stood forth to fight their chief: and needs\nmust I fight him\u2014no escape therefrom.\nThey vowed that my blood should spill: and I\nvowed, if I met then, to do my best.\n\nHow many a brother lief and dear\nhave my two hands laid to rest in the grave!\nI wailed not, nor raised lament or cry,\nfor my weeping would profit naught at all:\n\n15 I wrapped him round in his winding-sheet\u2014\nhard was I born on my birth day!\nI stand in the stead of those dead men:\nthe foemen count me a host alone.\nGone are the men I loved, and I\nlonely abide like sword in sheath.\nNOTES.\n\nThis poem is in the K\u0101mil (dimeter hypercatalectic) and is scanned thus:\n\nv. 1. \"burd\" a striped woollen stuff of el-Yemen, counted of great price.\n\nv. 2. \"a noble stock\": ma'dadin, plural of ma'din, literally \"mines\": hence, the origin of a family or race.\n\nv. 3. \"a hauberk flowing\": s\u0101bighah, dir being understood: a coat of mail that reaches to the ankles.\n\nv. 4. \"a grooved blade\": \u1e63\u0101\u1e25 sh\u016b\u1e6dub. Sh\u016b\u1e6dub or sh\u016b\u1e6dab are the grooves on a sword made for the blood to flow off after a stroke. \"Bodies of men\" abd\u0101n: this may mean also \"short coats of mail\"; but here it seems best to take it in the more usual sense. The sword of 'Amr son of Ma'di-kerib, called er-Sam\u0101d\u016bm or er-Sam\u0101d\u016bnch (\"the short and stout, compact and heavy\"), which he inherited from the Himyarite Kings, was one of the most famous blades of Arab legend.\n\nAfter this verse comes another in some editions\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0642\u064b\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u064b\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0647\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0645\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0627\n\nAnd a straight spear-shaft that quivers when I poise it, aiming it straight and true.\n\nv. 8. \"Furrowing the hard earth as they ran\" yefha\u1e63na bil-ma'z\u0101'i shadd\u0101. The verb fa\u1e63ha\u1e63a is explained as meaning \"making holes in the earth like af\u0101\u1e25\u012bs,\" plural of af\u0101\u1e25 which is the nest of the Qat\u0101. But this sense seems inappropriate, as the swifter the flight the less impression would the runner's feet make on the ground; another reading is yemha\u1e63na, from ma\u1e25asa, which means to run swiftly: also to glance, gleam, of lightning.\n\nv. 11. \"Their chief\": kebsh, literally, \"ram.\" This word is frequently used to denote the leader of a troop, as the ram leads the flock: e.g. in the Mo'all. of El-H\u0101rith son of Hillizeh, v. 50.\n\n\u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0642\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633 \u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0634 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0642\u0650\u064a \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0621\n\nRound Qays, his men clad in mail with a chief of el-Yemen, as though he wore a hard white rock.\n\n(Qaraqiy means 'of el-Yemen', because that is the land of the Qaraq or leaves of the selam [Mimosa flavia, Forsk.] wherewith hides are tanned.)\n\nv. 14. \"Profit nought at all\": l\u0101 yeruddu zend\u0101; zend means a fire-stick, and the literal meaning of this proverbial expression is \"will not bring as return so much as a fire-stick.\"\n\nv. 16. This 'Amr was counted, in the battles of el-Isl\u0101m, as equal to a thousand men. \"The Khalifeh 'Omar\" (we read in the Agh\u0101ni, XIV. p. 28) \"sent to Sa'd son of Ab\u016b Waqq\u0101s, his general in el-Tr\u0101q, 'Amr son of Ma'di-kerib and Tulayhah son of Khuwaylid el-Asadi, and wrote to him 'Lo! I have sent to aid thee two thousand men.'\"\n\nv. 17. \"Lonely abide as sword in sheath\": bagitu mithla-s-seyf ferd\u0101. The loneliness is explained in two ways: first, because the sword has no companion in its sheath; and second, taking sa-Seyf, \"the sword,\" as meaning the incomparable blade er-Sam\u0101d\u016bm which had no fellow or like.\nIII.\n\nTa'abbata Sherr\u00e0 went forth to woo a woman of 'Abs, of the house of Q\u0101r\u012bb, who first inclined to him and promised to marry him; but when he again visited her, he found her averse from him. \"What hath changed thee?\" said he: she answered\u2014\n\"Verily the honour of being thy wife is great; but my people said to me: 'What wilt thou do with a man who will surely be slain to-day or to-morrow, and thou be left husbandless?'\" And he turned away from her, and said\u2014\n\nThey said to her\u2014'Wed him not! for his life is nought at all:\nthe first spear-point that he lights on perchance shall stretch him [dead.]\n\nAnd she gave no whit of heed to wisdom, but feared to be\nthe widow of one whom Night enwraps, full of hardihead;\nLittle he slumbers or sleeps, and the heart of his intent\nis to gain the blood of vengeance, or face a foeman grim.\nThere comes down to fight with him whom his tribe count their bravest\n[man,\nbut not to gain fame of valour does he smite heads in twain.\n\n5 Little he stores of food beyond what shall stay his need:\nhis ribs stand forth with hunger, and his bowels cleave to his back.\nHe has lain in the wild beasts' lairs until they know him well,\nand never through fear of him have they fled from their grazing\n[grounds\u2014\n\nHe seeks not to take the hare or the deer by guile or spring:\nlong has he fought with men, grey is he and old therein.\nAnd he who deals ever with warfare, it cannot but be that he\nshall meet one day therein a fall from the hand of Death.\nThey see a man whose heart cares not to hunt the deer,\nand if they could grasp man's hand, they would verily grasp his hand.\n10 But he\u2014the lords of fat camels grow lean through fear of him,\nas they follow his track alone or girt with a company.\nAnd as for me, well I know that, though I live long, at last\nI shall meet the spear of Death flashing bare before mine eyes.\n\nNOTES.\n\nThe metre of this poem is the same as that of the first piece.\n\nv. 3. \"Little he slumbers or sleeps\": qallu ghirdri-n-naumi. Ghirdr is the beginning of sleep, drowsiness; the force of qalli being to deny altogether, the phrase means that he sleeps not at all, nor does he ever suffer drowsiness to creep over him.\n\"A foeman grim\": kemiyyan musaffa'd; kemiy is one fully armed: musaffe' means stained or blackened with the rust of armour which is constantly worn.

To grasp the hand is a sign of friendship and good will in Arabia as in Europe.\n\nv. 10. \"Fat camels\": makhdad, properly \"pregnant camels,\" which were held to be the most delicate of flesh (see Tarafeh, Mo'all. 93).\n\nNotes on, and Translation of, three Copper-plate Inscriptions from Sambalpur.\u2014By Pratapachandra Ghosha, B. A.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society for November 1872, under the head of presentations received, the receipt was announced of a Copper-plate Grant consisting of three leaves, found in the Sambalpur District. The plates were presented to the Society by Capt. M. M. Bowie, then Deputy Commissioner of that district. The plates were found buried in an earthen vessel, at some depth below the surface in the Tributary State of Patna attached to the Sambalpur District. The inscription records the grant of a village named Vakavedda on a small rent to four Br\u00e1hmans of four different gotras. The grant was made on the 8th lunar day of the bright half of the month of Ashadha in the 6th year of the reign of Janamejaya.\n\nThe plates are in tolerable preservation. The inscription runs over three oblong tablets connected together by a solid copper ring. The first covering plate is inscribed on one side only, and the last has but two lines of inscription on the second side. The ring is surmounted by a round\nPrat\u00e1pachandra Ghosha\u2014Three Copper-plate Inscriptions. [No. 2,\n\nseal with a thick border. The legend on it is unclear. It has been much affected by age, and the faint but rough relief impressions lead me to surmise that it had at one time a figure of R\u00e1machandra seated on a lotus, and surrounded by lotus leaves and flowers. At the foot of the lotus throne there appears to be a kneeling figure, evidently of Hanum\u00e1na, for it has a tail.\n\nThe character of the inscription is of the 12th century; the r of the inscription, however, is of as ancient a form as is met with in the Kutila type. The vowel signs are nearly identical with those of the Bengali alphabet. It is, however, noteworthy to observe that the ancient forms of \u090f, \u0909, \u0914 and \u0913 occur in this inscription. The \u090f, \u0909 and \u0914 are closely allied to the Bengali type. The language is Sanskrit, and the metre of the slokas which close up the inscription is in the long distich. The grammar on the whole is correct, but errors and omissions committed by the engraver are numerous.\n\nThe inscription opens with the simple auspicious \"Swasti\" in the style of a proclamation from Mah\u00e1bhava Gupta, evidently a son or scion of the family of Civa Gupta, the monarch of the three Kalingas. The place is then described, and the conditions of the grant are set forth; the annual rent being fixed at 8 palas of silver. A pala according to Amara Sinha is \"Karsha chatushtaya\", i.e. weighing 32 tol\u00e1s. As usual, in granting the village its mines are also given away.\n\nThe second tablet describes the recipients who are all evidently Bhatas (heralds?) by profession. The first is of the Kouchchha gotra, which is not known in this part of the country. The pravaras, that is the rishis, allied to the family are Angirasa and Varshayauvan\u00e1ca, and those of next to kith and kin are Yuvan\u00e1ca, Damvarisha and Angira, professing the Kauthama section of the S\u00e1maVeda. These are all evidently p\u00e1chatya Vaid\u00edka Br\u00e1hmans, that is to say, the Urias of the Western clan. The first donee's name is D\u00e1m\u00e1ka, the son of Aiprali. He came from a place called Leragringa in the valley of the Pampa. The second is of the Gautuma gotra. The second, third, and fourth all belong to the K\u00ednva section of the Yajur veda, the second comes from Upa\u00e7ringa, the upper peak as contradistinguished from Leragringa of the first donee. The third is named V\u00e1sudeva, the son of Hrishikesha, of the Kash\u00e1treya gotra. The fourth, though coming from the same valley as the first, is of the Agasti gotra and named Kon\u00e7adeva, the son of R\u00e1ma\u00e7arm\u00e1.\n\nAfter the description of the donees, the usual imprecatious are fulminated against the resumption by the future princes of the lands and the usual quotations from the Dharma \u010castras are added in which the donors of lands are praised, and their resumers are condemned as heinous sinners.\n\nThe engraver, an employee of the son of Mall\u00e1dhara Datta, the minister of the States, is a K\u00e1yastha of the Ghosha family.\nThe inscription closes with an eulogium on Janamejaya, whose name has been used in the plate. What this Janamejaya had to do with the grant is not at all evident from the inscription. The donor entitles himself as the king of the three Kalingas, a title not uncommon with the Uria kings of the 10th and 12th centuries to adopt (vide J. A. S. B., p. 21, 1869).\n\nUntil we can identify the Janamejaya of this inscription, it is needless to make an attempt at fixing the date of this grant. There is, however, one important point deserving of notice; in this plate mention has been made of the Ghosha family of the Kayasthas, a family which traces its descent from the days of the earliest of the Vedas. In the Rigveda, the twain Acvinas are said to have given a husband to the unmarried daughter of Ghosha: Ghoshayai chit pitrishade durone patim jurantyai Acvinavaddattam. R. V., i. 117, 7. Sayanacharya, however, says Ghosh\u00e1 was daughter to Kakshivat.\n\nTransliteration of the Copper-plates.\n\nPlate I.\n\nPlate II.\nPlate I. Amen! From the famous fortress of victory situated at Murastima (?), the most venerable great ruler of rulers and Sovereign-lord Cri Civa Gupta Deva, descended from whose feet the devout worshipper of Mah\u0113vara, most venerable, great ruler of rulers, and Sover-\neign-lord, the Glory of the Lunar race, and King of the Three Kalingas, \n\u015ar\u012b Mah\u0101bh\u0101va Gupta Deva, Lord spiritual and temporal, thus declares: \nAll J\u0101ts, soldiers, spies, Dhitrik\u0101s (?), watches or guards, favourites of the \nGovernment, dependents on the foot of Royalty, and others, living at any \ntime, in the village of Vakavedd\u0101, in the confines of the territories in the \nvalley of the Tunga, or in the allied countries in the vicinity. Be it known \nto you, that this village, with all its mineral wealth, free of all restraints, \nwith the right of collecting all supernumerary taxes, with its mango and \nmahu\u00e1 trees, with its excavations and salt lands, bounded by well-known \nboundaries on all its four sides, and restricted from the entrance of J\u0101t \nsoldiers, is given by us, for the settlement of the best Br\u0101hmans, sprung \nfrom the principals of the different families, viz.: \n\nPlate II. One of the Kachchha family, of the order of Angirasa \nyuvan\u0101ga, and sub-order Yavana\u00e7va-Amvarisha-Angira, student of the \nKauthhama section of the S\u0101maveda, inhabiting the Lera\u00e7ring\u0101 (Lera-\nchera?) alluvion of the Pamp\u00e1 Lake, son of the venerable Aiprali, and \nnamed Damaka. The second of the Gautama family, of the order of \nAngirasa, sub-order V\u0101rhaspatya, student of the Kanva section of the \nYajur veda, emigrant from Upe\u00e7ringa, inhabitant of Ka\u00f1dakehetra, and son \nof the venerable Naropaganda. The third of the Kash\u0101treya family, of \nthe order of Archan\u0101ga, sub-order \u00c7oabo\u00e7vana, student of the K\u0101nya sec-\ntion of the Yajur veda, emigrant from Koekhaladda, inhabitant of Lepa-\ntung\u0101, offspring of the Bhattas, son of the venerable Rishikesha, (H\u1e5b\u1e63hi-\nkesha rightly) and named V\u0101sudeva. And the fourth of the Agasti family, \nof the order of Idhmab\u0101hava, sub-order Chyava, student of the K\u0101nya \nsection of the Yajur veda, emigrant from Trikalinda, inhabiting the valley \nof the Pamp\u00e1, by name Kond\u0101deva, son of R\u0101maparm\u0101. \n\nTo these excellent Br\u0101hmans, I, with the sprinkling of water, for the \npurpose of their possession, until the duration of the Sun, Moon and Stars, \nat the fixed rent of eight palas of silver per annum; for the sake of adding \nto the merit and fame of my parents, as of myself, execute this Deed of \ngift in the Copper-plate edict. Knowing that it is for the rightful posses-\nsion (of the donees), and for the augmentation of the merit and fame of \nmy parents, and as of myself, that this Deed of gift is executed upon this \nCopper-plate edict. Knowing this yourselves, you are to dwell there \nhappily, taking rightful possession, levying, according to your respec-\ntive shares, revenues, and receiving the gold and other minerals of the soil. \n\nLet future proprietors of the soil, in due regard to our piety and \nrenown, and for our sakes, maintain this grant, as of their own, as it is \nsaid in the Dharm\u0101-Gastras (jurisprudence) that Sagara and many other \nkings have made gifts of lands, but the merit (of the grant) accrues to \nhim who for the time being is the proprietor of the soil.\nDoubt not of your merit, O earthly kings! because these gifts by others have been made, for endless merit awaits on him that maintains, rather than on him who confers, the same. The donor of land rejoices in heaven for a period of sixty thousand years; but their resumers and their advisers, too, dwell in the regions of hell for an equal space of years. Gold is the first offspring of Fire; Earth is the favourite of Vishnu and cows are the progeny of the Sun; therefore, whoever makes donations of gold, cows, and lands, these three kinds of donors do no more return on earth. Their fathers exult, and grandfathers laud (them), when their land-giving posterity thus bring about their redemption. Whoever receives a gift of land, and whoso makes a gift of it, both of them for their pious deeds ever ascend the heaven. The resumer of land is never absolved, though he should consecrate thousands of tanks, perform hundreds of Vajapeya sacrifices, and bestow ten millions of cows in charity. Whoever with an evil heart, dispossesses another or causes one to do such an act, being beset by darkness, he becomes fast entangled in the noose of Varuna, and degenerates into prostrate animals.\n\nPlate III. Whoso resumes land, whether of his own giving, or given by others, becomes a worm of the dirt, and rots there with his forefathers. The sun, Varuna, Vishnu, Brahma, the moon, fire, and the glorious Giva, all bless the giver of land. This common bridge of the piety of kings should always be supported by you. This is what Rama-chandra most expects of all future sovereigns of the earth. Reflecting on the transitoriness of human life and fortune, which is like a drop of water on the leaves of a lotus, and knowing that \"this world is a fleeting show\", let none obliterate the acts of others.\n\nThis Copper-plate document is written, on the eighth day of the moonlit-fortnight of Ashadha, in the sixth year of the victorious reign of the most venerable, great ruler of rulers and sovereign-lord, the illustrious Janamejaya Deva, which to write in figure is Samvat 6 Ashadha, Gudi, by Koi Ghosha, son of Vallabha Ghosha of the Kastha caste, in the service of the son of Gri Malladhara Datta, the Chief Minister of Peace and War.\n\nThere reigns the illustrious king of the Lunar race Janamejaya by name, who in purity and splendour resembles the carbuncle gem, in the family of the gemming lords of the earth. Whose valour and bounty are boundless as the ocean, and whose lawful gifts have made his name more glorious. He resembles the Lord of gods in saving the earth when in difficulties, and he is celebrated as a mighty vanquisher of the hosts of his enemies.\nNotice of a pre-historic Burial Place with Cruciform Monoliths, near Mungapet in the Nizam's Dominions.\u2014By William King, Depy. Supdt., Geol. Sur. of India.\n\n(With two Plates.)\n\nAbout eight miles W. S. W. of Mungapet (Paluncha Taluq), on the right bank of the Godavari, and on the road to Hanamconda, I passed over the strange place of sepulture described in this paper. It is in the midst of, and overgrown with, forest and scrub jungle, and is quite out of the ordinary route of European travellers; but as the tombs have been opened and there are signs of excavation, apparently of other hands than those of despoilers, it is possible that this spot has been visited and described by some previous observer. The only notice I can find having reference to like places in the neighbouring country is that of Colonel C. L. R. Glasfurd (Report of the \"Upper Godavery District, 1868,\") who says: \"But scattered here and there in the forests, and on the sides of hills, are found the remains of a race before whose antiquity even the ancient Hindu dynasties of the Peninsula of India must probably give way. I allude to the megalithic monuments of Indo-Scythic sepulture, consisting of cromlechs, kistvaens and cairns, which have been found in four of the six taluqs of this district.\" This account answers generally for the locality under description, except for the presence of some stone crosses, which in my experience of such burial-places in Southern India, are quite unique. Other ruder and perhaps more ancient remains (commonly\ncalled Korumbar rings), in some respects similar to these, are frequent over parts of the Madras Presidency; but here in addition to the presence of large crosses, the tombs are all built of worked stones, and furnished with coffin-like cavities in place of the usual urns or earthenware chatties.\n\nThe place itself is called, by the people around, Rakshasgudium or 'the village of demons', whom they describe in the usual way as having been as tall as trees, unclothed, long-haired, and of a time beyond the ken of man. Situated close to the present village of Kaperlaguru, it consists of an assemblage of kists or huge stone boxes for the reception of the dead, (and, if the size of some of these be taken into consideration, of very honoured dead too). The numbers of inferior people who must have been employed to quarry, dress, and carry the stones, were not buried in this place; it was the necropolis evidently of the rulers, not necessarily the heroes, of the country, for many of the kists contain two or more receptacles of different sizes as for families.\n\nThe ground occupied is about half a square mile in extent, but it is difficult to be exact as to the area or even as to the number of tombs owing to the thick forest growth, and there were only a few hours at my disposal for searching the place. There are, however, about 150 tombs scattered irregularly along the crest and western slope of a low sandstone ridge, (lying mainly in a long W. N. W.\u2014E. S. E. group) which is rather thickly crowded with kists near the northern end, where the high road crosses the ridge. In the more crowded portion of this ancient cemetery are four large cruciform monoliths, one lying flat on the ground at the extreme northern end of the place, and three a few yards south of the road, one of which is perfect and standing in a nearly upright position.\n\nThe crosses do not seem in their position to bear any very particular relation to the tombs near them, and are too large, supposing they are not in their original sites, to have been moved far from their first position. The northern-most cross is not lying near any kist, but the upright one and another (broken and dug down to its base) are placed close to two pairs of large tombs, though their position is not strikingly associated with either of these.* The fourth monolith is lying on the ground some fifty yards further south near a tomb.\n\nThe appended sketches (Plates XI and XII, figs. 1, 2) will show the style of these singular monoliths, which I think may be termed crosses, though they differ in many respects from all ornaments or sculptures of this class, while they are I consider of much more ancient date than the type from which nearly all crosses are derived.\n\nThe two crosses in the middle ground are facing about E.\u2014W., but not exactly; that is, the proper face may be to the sun or the reverse, for\n\n* (See Plate XII, Fig. 6.)\nI cannot say which is the front or back, as each cross is placed differently with regard to its neighbouring tombs. Some of the kists face the rising sun, others are at an angle with this position, or in other words, the entrances are always easterly though at varying degrees to the south or north of this.*\n\nThe distinguishing points in these monuments are the various breadth and length of the limbs, and the curved junction between the arms and lower limb.\u2020 The broken cross in the middle ground has been dug down to in order to expose the foot; its measurements are:\u2014whole height, 13 feet; height to arm, 9' 4\"; width of lower limb, 3' 2\"; length of unbroken arm from centre, 3' 8\"; width of arm at end, 2' 5\"; width of upper limb, 2' 1\"; thickness of monolith, 1' 8\". The neighbouring cross is smaller, but it stands 5' 6\" over the ground, and from the proportions of the others its lower limb must be sunk in the ground for about 6 feet.\n\nThese monoliths are neatly dressed, without any ornamentation or inscription, and present a rather less weathered appearance than the kists, which were apparently only roughly squared and then hammered or chiselled on certain surfaces, though the style of tooling is the same in all cases.\n\nEach tomb consists of four upright tooled slabs placed rectangularly, covered by another flat slab dressed at the edges, and the whole is generally encircled by a ring of rudely-dressed oblong stones meeting together at their ends, these being cut to give clean joints to the circle. The box or kist is built on the surface of the ground or, as it generally is, rock, there being no excavation or pit as is more frequently the case with the ruder Korumbarrings. One of the upright slabs is pierced for a small doorway large enough to admit a human body, and the sides of this entrance are cut or counter-sunk so as to allow of a slab or other closure being placed against the opening, though I did not see any loose slabs lying about which might have been used in this way. The covering slab overhangs the kist for more than a foot in width. (See Plate XII, figs. 3, 4, and 5.)\n\nMost of the tombs are more or less broken and tumbled about, while their interiors have in many cases been torn up; but a few still show what the inner arrangements were like. There was or is a floor or basement slab, very often the size of the interior, in which were cut out or carved one or more long and shallow cavities with rimmed edges suitable for the reception of a corpse. The largest tomb contains two of these receptacles with room for a third; in another are three, one (ordinary size) on either side with a smaller hollow, possibly for a child, between; while there is only one small cavity nearly three feet long on one side of the floor of a further tomb.\n\n* Possibly the fact of the entrance being to the north or south-east may have had reference to the time of death of the first tenant, according to the seasonal position of the sun.\n\n\u2020 See Plate XII, Figs. 1 and 2.\nThese coffin-like hollows are narrow at the opening, but widen out towards the bottom. They are not of much size, the largest being 5' 6\" long, 1' 6\" wide at mouth, and 11 inches deep; and this smallness probably indicates that the bodies were embalmed, more particularly as the cavities would seem to have been cut out as they were required, the floor slab having been placed when the tomb was built. Another point in favor of the view of embalming is, that the cavities are perfectly clean, not stained as they might have been in case of rapid decomposition of the corpse.\n\nThe kists are generally about 6 feet long by 5 feet broad and, with the overhanging roof, about 4 feet high; but some are much larger. The principal tomb is 9' 6\" long, and 9' wide, the covering slab being 14' 8\" by 11' 6\", with a thickness at the edge of 1' 4\"; the whole height from the ground being 5 feet. The circle enclosing this tomb is 37 feet in diameter, the stones forming it being some of them 8 feet long.\n\nGenerally, each circle of stones encloses one tomb; but there are exceptions, such as two kists within a single circle, and again, four of these arranged in a row inside of a long elliptical ring.\n\nThe covering slab and the sides of the kist are each of a single piece of sandstone, but many of these are now cracked, and in one instance I could not tell whether the upright slab were fractured or that one part of it had been cut to fit the other as is often the case in the facing of the great stone walls of some of the Teling\u00e1na fortresses. The small door-way is most frequently cut out in the upper half of one of the wall slabs, generally at one side or the other, though in a few cases it is in the middle. There does not appear to have been any covering stone for the body cavities, indeed the raised rim of these would have required a covering with perhaps more carving than the builders could elaborate.\n\nThe stone used is in all cases a very coarse grey sandstone, the rock of the place itself, but I could not see any trace of quarries though such may have been overlooked in my difficult search through such jungle. This use of the stone of the neighbourhood is another point of difference between these relics and the ordinary Korumber rings of S. India, the latter being usually constructed of stones other than the rock of the immediate locality.\n\nFurther examination of the slopes of the low hills in the neighbourhood of R\u00e1kshasgudium brought to light other sites of similar assemblages of tombs, but these are all very poor in the number and size of the kista, while there are no cruciform stones.\n\nThe history of this place of sepulture is of course lost in obscurity, but some attempt may be made to give it a place in the archaeological record. Col. Glasfurd, as shown in the extract from his report at the beginning of this paper, attributes the remains observed by him in the God\u00e1vari valley to a possible Indo-Scythic period, though I think he uses this\nterm in a sense to which it cannot be applied, for though there is sufficient evidence of a Hindu occupation of the country, there is little or none as to a previous Scythian one, the prior occupation having by all accounts had its derivation from the north-eastward instead of from the north-west. The mistaken use of the term Scythic may, however, be due to its being a general term for the pre-Aryan occupation of Europe, and thus adopted for the like period in India. Col. Glasfurd's Indo-Scythic time would then be the period to which I also am inclined to attribute the R\u00e1kshasgudium remains, namely, to later pre-Aryan times. Or, a narrower limit might be given in a Hindu-Kolarian period; for these tombs\u2014supposing as I do, that they were erected by a people of the Kolarian family\u2014are of a higher order of building than was usual with them, evidencing a later stage in the history of the people who erected tombs of this kind, and this burial-place may have been in use long after the Aryan occupation.\n\nThe absence of any inscriptions or incised ornamentation whatever would seem to place the R\u00e1kshasgudium kists and monoliths in an earlier age than that of such inscribed buildings or stones as are now extant in the adjacent country, which are either of Buddhist or Teleng\u00e1na workmanship. I do not remember noticing any inscriptions on the Buddhist caves of the God\u00e1var\u00ed or Kistna valleys, but such are frequent in the Teleng\u00e1na ruins of Warangal and in the chain of large reservoirs extending northwards from Pakkhal tank, which last, according to the inscription on the bund, dates back some 1700 years.\n\nIt seems necessary, therefore, to look for a period whose people were less civilized than the Teleng\u00e1nas and who probably did not possess a written character, in fact, for a pre-Aryan race, and the remnants of this I think exist still in the few and scattered tribes of the God\u00e1var\u00ed valley coming under the general name of Kois, who do not, however, acknowledge any acquaintance with the remains under consideration.\n\nThere seems little doubt but that these Kois are related to the Kols of Bustar and the country north-eastward by Katak, and that they are thus of the Kolarian family. This country, in the God\u00e1var\u00ed valley, is scattered over with cromlechs and kists somewhat of the same general type as those of R\u00e1kshasgudium though of much ruder form. But, as this family of people is tracked northward, the architectural character of these becomes improved, their occurrence more frequent, and the popular theories concerning them more intelligent, until in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, the Larka Kols or Hos, as described by Colonel Dalton, are found still making use of and erecting sepulchral and monumental collections of stones, always of ruder form, however, than the relics in question.\n\nWithout, however, taking into consideration the peculiarities of style, tooling, and mode of burial evidenced in the R\u00e1kshasgudium tombs, there\nis a very general resemblance between them and the other sepulchral ruins scattered over the country above indicated and even as far south as the K\u00e1v\u00e1ri river, which ruins are doubtless the relics of pre-Aryan races, an early branch of whom, is possibly now represented in the small degraded tribe of Yanadis* of Striharicotta, and a later branch by the more civilized though still low Kois and Kols of the north.\n\nHere at R\u00e1kshasgudium, however, we have the most improved form of the type burial-place, the placing of the corpse in a horizontal receptacle, and the unique cruciform monuments, all of which are evidences of civilization, possibly of the highest form at which the Kolarian people had arrived when their country was inundated by the great Aryan wave.\n\nIt is at the same time very remarkable that in the part of the country where I would have it that the evidences of the highest phase of civilization of the pre-Aryan exists, we have now only a very degraded remnant of the race with no knowledge of the ruins in question. May I suggest on this, that the Kois of the present day possibly had no direct ancestors living here at the time of the Aryan invasion, or are they the returned residue of so much of the race as was driven outwards by the invaders, or perhaps the after outspreading of those branches of the race who were never touched in the fastnesses of Sambalpur and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur by the wave of conquest, while the more refined tribes then existing became gradually absorbed into, or amalgamated with the new race.\n\nA great difficulty in tracing out the age of these remains, presents itself in the cruciform character of the monoliths; for I believe these are unique in the pre-historic sepulchral remains of India, and it might naturally be expected that a like though rougher form of the same type should occur among the ruder examples of similar places in the neighbourhood, while at the same time it is necessary to face the apparently much easier solution of the problem that the monoliths and even the cemetery itself may be of very early Christian origin. It is, however, more probable that a more refined section of the pre-Aryan people should have had one burial-place with special monuments for their greatest families, than that a single early Christian cemetery should have been planted far inland, in the centre of heathendom without a trace of the cross being left in the countries outside.\n\nAs stated in the commencement of this paper, it is very possible some previous observer may have seen this place and recorded his observations; but I am unable to learn of such, while my means of reference to any previous literature on the subject is very small. At the same time, I must\n\n* The Yanadis frequent the country around Pulicat Lake (Madras): and I saw, in 1863-64, two of these people producing fire by the manipulation of pieces of wood, on a rainy day, within 200 yards of a modern village.\nacknowledge reference to Col. E. T. Dalton's paper on the 'Rude Stone Monuments of Chutia Nagpur and other places,'* and, more especially, to Mr. R. N. Cust's paper on the 'Non-Aryan Languages of India.'\u2020\n\nPostscript.\n\nMy attention has been drawn to Mr. Mulheran's notices,\u2021 of cromlechs and stone crosses in the God\u00e1var\u00ed valley, which bear out my supposition that these had been visited by some previous explorer. I think the burial-place referred to by Mr. Mulheran as at or near Katapur\u00a7 is clearly that of R\u00e1kshasgudium, but I have not seen the locality called Malur. It is worthy of notice that the Rakshasgudium crosses are not always to the right of the cromlechs, for it is difficult to say\u2014See Plates XI, fig. 2, and XII fig. 6,\u2014to what cromlechs any particular cross belongs.\n\nMr. Mulheran does not make out a clear case for either a Christian or even a Buddhistic origin of these crosses and cromlechs: though I agree with him that their origin is extremely puzzling. The crosses in question are not so clearly of a Latin form as Mr. Mulheran would imply; and had they been Christian, I think they would have been placed more conspicuously as appertaining to a particular tomb, or set of tombs. I am not aware of any case of a memorial Christian cross being placed opposite the corner of a tomb, as in this locality. I know, in Ireland, of pagan places of burial or memorial|| having been christianized by the addition of christian ornaments or signs, and such might have been the case at R\u00e1kshasgudium: but the complete isolation of the place is against this view; the monoliths themselves evidence more labour than could have been effected by a stray Christian fold, or by wandering missionaries; there are no inscriptions; and the proportion of the monoliths are essentially different to those of any Christian cross. It is also not known that any such form of monolith or cromlech exists now near any Christian remains in India.\n\nCol. Walker's remark,\u00b6 as to the doubtfulness of the hypothesis of the cromlechs being the work of a \"stone-implement using race,\" is just with regard to the cromlechs of R\u00e1kshasgudium; for these are, I think, evidently in their tooling the work of men who used iron implements.**\n\n* Journ.

S., Rangpur.\n\nRangpur is and always has been a border country. With the Koch State and the Bh\u00fatan Dv\u00e1rs on the north, the wild tribes of \u00c1s\u00e1m on the east, the advancing tide of Aryan civilization, and subsequent Muhamma-dan conquest pressing on from the west, and, worst of all, the hated Van-g\u00e1l\u00e1 from the south, it is but natural that these conflicting elements should have left deep traces of storm and turmoil on the inmost life of the people. The district itself long formed a part of the Kraun'cha or Koch Bih\u00e1r kingdom, and being particularly exposed to invasion from all sides, it is covered with sites of battle-fields, and abounds in legends relating to national heroes. The people themselves have a legend that they are descended from a remnant of the Kshatriyas who escaped the destroying axe of Para\u015bu R\u00e1ma, and it is possible that a few of such families may have settled on this debatable ground, and have found a new home and a new Ganga on the banks of the Brahmaputra. They say that the Kraun'cha Him\u00e1laya takes its name from those recreant (Krukt\u00e1) warriors who abandoned their father's faith, pure in its Vedic simplicity, for the dread gods of the dwellers of the mountains; and they point to their caste names and their strange religion in confirmation of the theory. Be that as it may, it is certain that Rangpur contained Hindu colonists at a very early period of Indian History. The name of one of its rivers\u2014the Karat\u00f3y\u00e1\u2014is even mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bharata, and the Lohity\u00e1, a portion of the Brahmaputra, which borders the extreme east of the district, is also alluded to (Bhishma Parvan, 376).\n\nAs usual, little attempt seems to have been made to proselytize the aboriginal inhabitants. The Hindu, while probably the most receptive, is the least missionary religion in the world. The wild savages were allowed to retain their demon worship, their \"Hudum Deo\", and their rites of almost T\u00e1ntrik obscenity, and were formed into a caste of D\u00e1sas with their own customs (flesh-eating, widow marriage, polygamy, and even polyandry), their own gods and their own language. In process of time, other and even lower castes were formed, Chand\u00edlas and Bh\u00fami-m\u00e1l\u00eds for instance, and the D\u00e1sas taking up the name of their former R\u00e1ja-putra masters, called themselves, or were called by their humbler brethren, R\u00e1ja-vam\u015byas. Such is the story of the R\u00e1jbams\u00ed caste, which now includes within its bond sixty per cent. of the Hindus of Rangpur.\n\nIn such a legendary history it is of course impossible to fix dates, or even to assign eras for these changes. The earliest king whose name I have found mentioned in local songs is M\u00e1nik Chandra, a baniya by caste. Of course he is stated to have lived in the Satya Yuga, which gives no era\nwhatever; but I think it will be evident from a perusal of the epic poem called M\u00e1nik-Chandra-R\u00e1j\u00e1r-g\u00e1n, that he must have lived at a very early date, considerably before the Muhammadan invasion under Sh\u00e1h Ism\u00e1'il Gh\u00e1z\u00ed, A. H. circ. 850, of whom an account was given by Mr. Damant, in Vol. 43 of the Journal. No character is more popular than Ism\u00e1'il Gh\u00e1z\u00ed in this district, and the popular songs teem with allusions to him; and yet the epic poem above-mentioned contains no mention of him or of any Musalm\u00e1n whatever. I therefore conclude that this epic must have been originally written, or rather composed, for it has been unwritten till lately, before Ism\u00e1'il Gh\u00e1z\u00ed's time, and, as it makes M\u00e1nik Chandra a king of the good old days, \"when saints were many, and sins were few,\" he must have lived a considerable time before the Musalm\u00e1n invasion.\n\nThis invasion was another important factor in forming the character and language of the people. Rangpur was for years the battle-ground between the Kraun'cha Hindus, and the invading Yavans from the west. We have traces of this existing in the topographical nomenclature of the present day: there are Maghal Bach\u00e1 where a Hindu General escaped from the enemy, and Maghal h\u00e1t, where one of the numerous treaties of peace was signed, and several other similar names throughout the country. But perhaps the most pregnant sign of the magnitude of the forces which were insensibly moulding the condition of Rangpur for future centuries is the existence to the present day of a vast dyke extending right across the district from east to west.\n\nIt was built to aid the defenders in withstanding Musalm\u00e1n invasion. South of it, and when that became untenable, south of another farther north, were conquering foreigners, bearded strangers, bringing a new language and a new religion, and armed with all the hatred for the K\u00e1firs which a strange language and a strange religion can give. For years the rule over the populace south of these dykes was the occupation of conquerors and not the colonization of immigrants, and that region has never since rebounded from the oppression. The Parganas south of the south dyke, are the most backward in Rangpur, and the despair of its rulers. They abound in moderately wealthy Muhammadans, descendants of the followers of Ism\u00e1'il Gh\u00e1z\u00ed and his compatriots, but the ra'iyats are a tribe of fetish be-ridden savages worthy of the pen of a Burton or Cameron. Too ignorant to betake themselves to the refuge of the law, their sole idea on seeing a stranger is, that he is come to extort more money from them, and thereupon they run into the jangals and hide themselves. They do this not only when the stranger is a native official, but even when he is a European. I myself have gone into villages, and have had the greatest difficulty in finding a man who was brave enough to speak to me. I would not wish it to be thought, that what I have just written has been exaggerated: it is\nmerely a copy, and in some parts a verbatim copy, of district reports: and it is fully borne out by my own observations.\n\nAs might have been expected, this tract forms a rich mine for the investigator into aboriginal folk lore.\n\nThe people, Muhammadans and Hindus alike, worship two gods, the Burhi Deo, and Hudum Deo. The first is a bamboo set up in the earth, to which are hung half a dozen rags and perhaps an old bottle or two. The worshippers have no distinct reason for cultivating it, except a vague idea, that if they do not, some undefined evil will probably befall them; and so they do p\u00faj\u00e1 to it, by attaching to it any old refuse they may find in their house.\n\nThe other is a kind of Indra, worshipped only by women, and only in the time of drought. They set up a plantain tree at night at a cross-road, and dance naked round it singing songs of the most horrible obscenity.\n\nSuch is the state of those who live south of the dyke. That of those on the north side presents more favourable aspects. While the former country was occupied by a foreign army, the latter was held by a people who fought for themselves and their religion with a certain amount of success. Northern Rangpur was never effectively held for any length of time by the Muhammadans, and the result is that the greater part of its population is Hindu at least in name. Although degraded, the people are not so degraded as their brethren of the south. It is true that they follow few of the customs of Hindus born nearer the source of Aryan civilization in India, situated so far to the west,\u2014but one thing has been ineradicably stamped in their character, they know that their ancestors fought for their religion, whatever it is, and were able to retain it. There has thus been begotten amongst them a sort of local patriotism, which, if it has occasionally been a bar in the way of attempts made to help their progress, has at the same time had an effect which cannot have been otherwise than invigorating.\n\nIt may sometimes have tended to patriotism in a \"parochial\" sense, but it has taught the people to think for themselves and to act for themselves, and, above all, to see that under the English R\u00e1j there is a reign of law which is the same for the poor man and the rich.\n\nI have been engaged for some time past in collecting the folk-songs of Rangpur, and nowhere is the difference between these two belts of country more easily perceived than in a comparison of them. Those of the northern tract are often semi-religious lays with subjects taken from the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata or Pur\u00e1na, but with an individuality about them, in their language and character, which stamps them with their owners' names. Some of them are really ambitious productions, with snatches of poetry in\nthem which might please even a fastidious taste, and one already mentioned deserves special notice. It is of considerable length, about seven hundred and fifty verses, and has been handed down by word of mouth for generations in a family of Yogins, who make their living by singing it and other songs. It is a kind of epic, and describes the life of two ancient kings of Rangpur, who lived in the Satya Yuga, named Manik Chandra and Gopi Chandra. I have been fortunate enough to obtain a copy, taken down from the Yogins as they recite it; and I hope at some future date to be able to give a full account of it. Amidst much that is puerile and exaggerated, it contains many true touches of poetry, and gives some valuable information as to the customs of the country in bygone days. It has of course undergone many changes in its passages from mouth to mouth, but from internal evidence, as I have already said, I believe it to have been originally composed before the Musalm\u00e1n invasion.\n\nThis and other northern country songs, it should be noted, are remarkable for their hatred of the dakshina desa, from which the evil-mind Vanga comes.\n\nThe songs of the south are, on the contrary, either short erotic lyrics, of which the less said the better, or hymns sung in honour of Hudum Deo or at the K\u00e1rtika p\u00faj\u00e1, which surpass even them in obscenity. Destitute alike of wit and of poetical feeling, they can do nothing but disgust the most unimpassioned and impartial investigator.\n\nI propose now to give a short sketch of the grammar of the very peculiar dialect spoken in Rangpur, with a few specimens of the songs which are best adapted to illustrate my remarks thereon.\n\nTHE ALPHABET.\n\nThe Alphabet of course is nominally the same as that of Beng\u00e1li, but it contains sounds which are, I believe, unknown to that language.\n\nFor instance there is a liquid, generally a substitute for a regular ril (e.g. \u092e\u0948\u0925\u093f\u0932\u0940 for \u092e\u0948\u0925\u093f\u0932\u0940), which is much more nearly the Tamil lingual l than any other sound with which I am acquainted. It is sometimes heard at home in the London streets, when in the morning the milkmen cry \"milk.\"\n\nWith regard to the pronunciation of ordinary letters it must be remarked that\u2014\n\n(1.) An initial \u0930r is almost always elided, and generally a following \u0905a v\u1e5biddhied into \u0906\u0101. Thus \u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0924\u0947 randhite \"to cook\" and \u0930\u0935\u093e rava \"voice\" are always pronounced \u0906\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0924\u0947 \u0101ndhite, und \u0906\u0935\u093e \u0101-o respectively. Sometimes a reverse process takes place and a \u0930r is supplied where not required. A good example is \u0930\u0947\u091c\u0947\u0902\u091f revenue agent, which is pronounced \u0930\u0947\u091c\u0947\u0902\u091f iviniu rejen.\nl and n are interchangeable at pleasure, especially when initial, or forming the last syllable of a word. In some parts of the country the people seem to have lost all power of pronouncing n unassisted by a subsequent conjunct letter. Thus b\u00e1na-b\u00e1la, \"he made\" may become b\u00e1la-b\u00e1la or b\u00e1la-b\u00e1la or b\u00e1la-b\u00e1la. Lakshmipur becomes Nakhipur.\n\n(8.) Aspirated are interchanged with unaspirated letters, and vice versa. Thus Daivakini is also pronounced Daivakhili or Daivakhini.\n\nSimilarly je and jhe, who. garba and garba, a womb. b\u00e1dh\u00e1 and b\u00e1dh\u00e1, hindrance. bojh\u00e1 and bojh\u00e1, a burden. bh\u00e9n\u00e1 and bh\u00e9n\u00e1 and vin\u00e1, looking away.\n\n(4.) The vowels i, i, and e, are freely interchangeable. For examples, see above.\n\n(5.) With regard to other letters\u2014\n\n(a.) a can take almost any vowel sound, except that of a in \"America.\" As an extreme instance I give kariy\u00e1, which is pronounced kaire or rather koire, having done.\n\n(b.) i is frequently omitted, the consonants on each side forming a conjunct. Thus, b\u00e1dh\u00e9 or b\u00e1dh\u00e9, bindhit\u00e9 or bindhit\u00e9. It is also sometimes inserted between the members of conjuncts.\n\n(c.) Single medial surd letters are elided optionally. Especially kh, also b, v, and y.\n\nE.g., sa-i for sakhi, de-o for deva, pia for priya. Compare Vararuchi, II. 2.\n\n(d.) chh is always pronounced as a dental s. \u00e1chhe, is, becomes \u00e1se. Compare Vara., II. 41, for a reverse example.\n\n(e.) s is never pronounced as a dental, but always as sh, the reverse of Vara. II. 43.\n\n(f.) j and y are often pronounced as z, and this not only in Arabic and Persian words, but in such words as zan, when, for jakha\u1e47.\n\n(g.) Similarly ph sometimes becomes f.\n\n(h.) b sometimes becomes m. For example see the verb paradigms.\n\n(i.) As in ordinary Bengali, r, and v interchange with j and b respectively. r also interchanges with d.\n\n(6.) Conjuncts. I know of no rule under which these can be brought. They are made and decomposed ad libitum. y and v at the end of a compound are pronounced as in ordinary Bengali. r at the end of a compound is generally detached, as in par\u00e1n for pr\u00e1na. Vara., III. 62. Sometimes, however, it is dropped, as in pia for priya. Compare Vara. III. 8. At the commencement of a compound it has little effect beyond strengthening the letter underneath. E.g. pushkari\u1e47i\na tank, becomes \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0940 pushk\u0101r\u012b, which is pronounced almost like pushk\u0101n\u012b. Vara. III. 50.\n\nA noticeable exception to the rule of separation is the preposition \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f prat\u012b, which becomes \u092a\u0924\u093f; see Vara. II. 7, and Hema-Chandra\u2019s s\u016btra Praty-\u0101dau dah according to which the pr\u0101k\u1e5bit form is pa\u1e0di, and not pati. Also, as regards the elision of \u0930, see Vara. III. 8. Other compounds can only be settled by comparison and selection.\n\nNouns.\n\nThe following are the terminations, in the declension of nouns:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nominative \u2014 or \u090f | \u090f, \u0917\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e |\n| Objective } \u0913\u0915, \u0915 | \u0917\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0915 |\n| Dative } | |\n| Instrumental | \u091a\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0930 |\n| Ablative | \u0918\u0928\u0947, \u0920\u093e\u0930 |\n| Genitive | \u0930 |\n| Locative | \u0938 |\n\nThus \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915 a boy is declined\u2014\n\nNom. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915 or \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0947\n\nObj. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u094b\u0915 or \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0915\n\nInst. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915 \u091a\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0930\n\nAbl. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0918\u0928\u0947 or \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0920\u093e\u0930\n\nGen. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0930\n\nLoc. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0938\n\nand similarly in the plural,\n\n\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0917\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e, &c.\n\nAdjectives.\n\nThese call for no remarks. They are without gender or inflection, except when used as substantives.\n\nPronouns.\n\nAs might be expected, their forms are many for each person. The most common are as follows:\n\nFirst person \u092e\u0948\u0902, \u092e\u0948\u0902, \u092e\u0948\u0902, \u091a\u093e\u0938\u093f, \u091a\u093e\u0938\u093f, \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0930\u093e.\n\nSecond ditto \u0924\u0942, \u0924\u0942, \u0924\u0942, \u0924\u0942\u0938\u093f.\n\nThird ditto \u092f\u0939 this \u092f\u094b, this or that. \u0924\u093e\u0901 or \u0924\u093e\u0901 or \u091a\u093e\u0938\u093f that or he.\n\nRelative \u092f\u094b, or \u092f\u094b or \u091a\u093e\u0938\u093f, who.\n\nInterrogative \u092f\u094b, or \u092f\u094b or \u091a\u093e\u0938\u093f, who?\nSamples of Declension.\n\nNom. \u092e\u0948\u0902 I \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902 or \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e\nObj. \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0915\u0947, \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0915\u0947 me \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0915\u0947,\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e\nInst. \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e by me \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e\nAbl. \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e, or \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930 from me \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e or \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\nGen. \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0915\u0947 of me \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0915\u0947\nLoc. \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0915\u0947 in me \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0915\u0947\n\nSimilarly are declined \u092e\u0948\u0902 you, \u0938\u093e that, \u091a\u093e who, &c.\n\n\u092f\u0939, this, is declined as follows:\n\u092f\u0939, \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e, \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e, &c.\n\nThe plurals of all these words follow the analogy of substantives.\n\nThe two most interesting forms amongst the above, to my mind, are \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902 and \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e. The first is the missing link between the Bengali \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902 and the Hindi \u092c\u093e\u0939, both of which are plural honorific forms. \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e is interesting as showing the process by which in almost every language, plural honorific forms supersede the usual singular. \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e is the plural of \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902, which is itself a plural form. \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902, however, by constant use has acquired a purely singular sense, and thereby ceases to be honorific, and a fresh plural of a plural has to be coined to supply the deficiency. I may mention that \u0924\u094b\u0939\u0930\u093e is also used in a similar singular sense for \"you\" in the north-west of the District.\n\nAnother point worth noting amongst these pronouns, is the characteristic ending in \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f, \u092c\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902, or \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0930\u093e, which are all local variations of the same sound. This is the characteristic ending of most of the sarva-nam\u0101m, mistranslated \"pronouns.\" Thus we have \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0902\u091a not \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f meaning \"all.\"\n\nIt is worth enquiring into, how numerals in so many languages came to have not only original Aryan pronominal inflexions, but pronominal terminations showing the most manifest signs of, and being the result of modern phonetic decay. Such an enquiry, however, would necessitate discussing the whole theory of pronominal declension, a task which I willingly leave to more competent hands. What I have set myself to do is to record facts, and to leave others to draw inferences from them.\n\nI here give specimens I have collected of the commonest pronominal forms, in the form of a \"Philological Harp.\"\n| Pronoun | Place | Time | Manner | Quantity |\n|---------|-------|------|--------|----------|\n| Determinative | this | hither | now | thus | this much |\n| Demonstrative | that | thither | then | in that way | that much |\n| Relative | who | whither | when | how | how much |\n| Interrogative | who? | whither? | when? | how? | how much? |\n\n**Verbal Forms.**\n\nPrefatory. As will be seen the main scheme of the Rangpur\u00ed conjugation is founded on that of classical Bang\u00e1li. To bring this out more clearly, I shall give the two paradigms in parallel columns. As usual in local dialects, the so called non-honorific or, in reality, singular form, is preferred to the honorific plural form usually found in the books.\n\nIn book-Bang\u00e1li there are few irregular verbs. The two commonest examples are \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e to go, and \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e to be. The former has its past participle \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e and \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e instead of \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e and \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e, and the latter has its Imperfect tense \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e instead of \u0917\u093e\u092f\u093e. The regular forms are, however, sometimes used in poetry, and I have remarked that the peasantry of Bard-\nw\u00e1n and the neighbouring districts occasionally use those of \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0932\u093e in conversation. In the northern half, however, of Rangpur the regular forms are the rule and the irregular the exception. Indeed in conversation, \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0932\u093e and not \u092c\u093f\u0939\u0941 is always used.\n\n**PARADIGM.**\n\nThe verb \u092a\u0947\u0921\u093c\u093e\u0928\u093e to

I do not for a moment pretend either that the forms I have given are all necessarily peculiar to Rangpur, or that I have by any means suggested all the possible varieties. I have only given the forms usually current amongst the lower orders of the District.\n\nOther Miscellaneous Grammatical Forms.\n\nI have already shown one point of resemblance between Rangpuri and Hindi in the word \u201cI\u201d \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0942\u0901.\n\nThere is another form of the genitive, which may, I believe, be connected with the well-known Hindi suffixes \u0915\u093e, \u0915\u0947, and \u0915\u0940, signifying \u201cof.\u201d It is met in the books, or rather in the grammars, in the genitive of \u091a\u093e\u092a\u0925\u093f\n\"your honour\" \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930, meaning \"of your honour,\" while \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930 means \"of one's self.\" This is exactly reversed in Rangpuri, where \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930 is almost always used when the speaker wishes to say \"of one's self.\" In this dialect, however, the suffix \u0915\u093e\u0930, which I believe to be a sort of double genitive, is not confined to \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930. I find it used in common conversation, in such phrases as \u0939\u0941\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u0916\u093e \u091c\u0947\u0902\u0921\u0947 \u090f\u0915\u0942\u0902 \"I came on foot a journey of two days\"; \u0915\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u093e\u0930 \u091c\u092e \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0940 \"put it aside for to-morrow.\" Curiously enough, when in Tirhut in the year of the famine, I was thrown much amongst uneducated classes, I noticed, amongst other forms in which a relationship to Bangali might be traced, a similar use of the word \u0915\u093e\u0930 and instead of \u0915\u093e\u0930, which then not having been in Rangpur, I could not understand.\n\nI now proceed to give some examples of Rangpuri folk songs.\n\nI have used the Deva-Nagar\u00ed alphabet, and not the Bangali, as I believe they will thus be accessible to a wider number of readers. As the three sibilants are freely interchangeable, I have for the sake of uniformity followed Vararuchi II, 43, and have written a dental \u0936 sa throughout. I have not, however, been able to carry out this rule rigidly in the case of some compound letters. For similar reasons I have represented both \u0936 and \u0936 by \u0936.\n\nThe first story is a kind of nonsense verse, not unlike some of our nursery rhymes at home. Although I do not know any exact European parallel, it is quite possible that such an one may exist, and I have given it in the hope of the analogy being pointed out.\n\nI do not know why it is called a Gorakh N\u00e1ther g\u00e1n. It appears to have no connection whatever with Krishna. It is a great favourite amongst the people, who delight in hearing it sung, and go into fits of laughter at the absurder impossibilities related.\n\n\u0917\u094b\u0930\u0916

Let me whisper a tale in your ear. I got a present of three villages.\n(2.) But two villages were all waste land, and in the third there was not a single man.\n(3.) In the village in which there was not a single man sat three blacksmiths. But two of them did not know their business, and the third did not make anything.\n(4.) The blacksmith who made nothing, made three spades. But two of them were broken and good for nothing, and the third had no ferule for the handle.\n(5.) With the spade which had no ferule, he dug three tanks. But two of them were filled with dust, and the third had no water in it.\n(6.) In the tank which had no water in it, he set three fish-nets. But two were in rags and tatters, and the third had no meshes.\n(7.) With the net which had no meshes, he caught three ru-is (a kind of fish). But two jumped away and escaped, and the third he couldn\u2019t find.\n(8.) The ru-i he couldn\u2019t find, he took off to K\u00e1l\u00edganj market, and sold it for three k\u00e1hans* of kaoris. But two k\u00e1hans he didn\u2019t get and one they didn\u2019t give him.\n(9.) With the k\u00e1han of kaoris they didn\u2019t give him he bought three earthen cooking pots. But two were broken and worthless, and the third had no bottom.\n(10.) With the pot which had no bottom, he cooked rice for three br\u00e1hmans. But two didn\u2019t eat any; and the third didn\u2019t get any.\n(11.) And the br\u00e1hman who didn\u2019t get any, gave him three slaps. But two didn\u2019t touch him, and the third wasn\u2019t a slap, &c.\n\nThe next song is a curious and characteristic production of the tiger-haunted northern half of the district. It tells how the Tiger-god Son\u00e1rdy Th\u00e1kur destroyed an army of Mughuls.\n\n\u092c\u093e\u0918\u0947\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0924\u093e\n\n\u0936\u094b\u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f

Th\u00e1kur Son\u00e1r\u00e1y.\u201d All the tigers roar forth his name.\n(1.) From house to house the Th\u00e1kur wandered, uttering the name of Hari.\n(2.) He uttered the name of Hari as he went along the way; and he met the whole Mughul army on the road.\n(3.) The whole Mughul army asked him a question: but in the pride of his heart, the Th\u00e1kur only shook his head.\n(4.) So they undid their waistbands and tied up the Th\u00e1kur, and with blows they thrust him on before them.\n(5.) They thrust him on into their prison, and tied a twenty-two maund stone upon his chest: (and left him there).\n(6.) The little Mughuls got up and said to the big Mughuls, \u201cBrothers, come, let us see our prisoner* of yesterday.\u201d\n(7.) Both the classes of Mughuls went to bathe.\n(8.) They ate their breakfast (and drank) sweet water, and then went off to see their prisoner.\n(9.) The Mughuls went on, and on, and on, and arrived at the prison.\n(10.) When they arrived at the prison, they peeped carefully in. \u201cHe has thrown off the twenty-two maund stone, your Son\u00e1r\u00e1y is not there.\u201d\n(11.) The little Mughuls got up and said to the big Mughuls, \u201cBrothers, this binding up was not good. Let us go home.\n(12.) \u201cLet us go home and build seven houses. If we keep inside them, there will be no fear of the tiger.\u201d\n(13.) (The Th\u00e1kur said unto himself) \u201cYe scoundrels, low-caste Mughuls, ye could not recognize me. Your Mughuls will be killed one fine night.\n\n* Lit. \u201ctying up.\u201d\n(14.) The Th\u00e1kur went to the edge of the wood and gave forth a roar, and with one bound there came twenty hundred tigers.\n\n(15.) Twenty hundred tigers came, thirty hundred camels, and with heads down came wild bears.\n\n(16.) \"Hurrah, Tigers; take some betel and p\u00e1n. We have revenge to take upon those scoundrelly Mughuls.\n\n(17.) The tigers rushed up tumultuously and took the p\u00e1n: and with one spring of their bodies they destroyed the seven houses.\n\n(18.) The tigers got tired with breaking down the houses, so they jumped into the inner apartments.\n\n(19.) The Mughul's wife had gone into the cook-house. When the tigers saw her, they tumultuously twisted her neck.\n\n(20.) The Mughul's daughter had gone to fetch water. When she saw the tigers, she jumped into the river and began to swim. The fishes said \"A crocodile is eating her.\"\n\n(21.) She said, \"Oh Th\u00e1kur, why are you afflicting me so to-day.\"\n\n(22.) He caught the Mughul by the left arm, and gave him a blow. The Mughul fell on the ground crying \"B\u00e1p, B\u00e1p.\"\n\n(23.) He said, \"Oh Th\u00e1kur, why are you afflicting me so to-day. I'm not a slave of my wealth but I am of my life. I'll sell my riding horse and be your slave.\"\n\n(24.) On that day Son\u00e1r\u00e1y Th\u00e1kur made himself visible, and men now worship him when they fall into temptation.\n\nThe third specimen is a song describing the birth of Krishna. It is by far the most popular song amongst the Hindus of the district. It is not extant complete, but I have been able to collect many pieces of it and to repatch them into something like the original song which no doubt originally existed. I have been able to produce a pretty fair text; as there is hardly a line of which I have not obtained two or three copies. Considering the great distances from each other at which the places were whence I obtained the fragments, it is wonderful how they agree; especially as it is not customary for the reciters to possess written copies, or even to be able to read them if they did. B\u00e1bu Hari\u00e9 Chandra R\u00e1\u00ed of Ulipur in this district was able to give me three extensive fragments, which were of great assistance to me. They gave me, in fact, the main thread on which to string the other smaller fragments I had collected.\n\nNo doubt the story was originally continued further than I now give. In fact, I have some short pieces on Krishna's later life which favour such a theory: but unfortunately they are not nearly numerous enough, as far as I have yet been able to see, to justify me in giving any more at present.\nAs it is given here, the story ends abruptly. Perhaps, at some future time I may be able to extract more of the same kind of gold from the rich mine of material yet lying by me unexamined.\n\n\u0915\u093f\u0902\u091a\u0947\u0930

Ugrasena was a great king, renowned throughout the three worlds; and in his family was born a damsel named Devaki.\n\n2. \"Into what house will I give the damsel? I cannot find a worthy suitor. She hath beauty and she hath jewels. She is fair to look upon.\"\n\n3. About this time the most excellent saint Narada came on a visit to her father.\n\n4. When the king saw the saint, he made obeisance and gave him a splendid throne to sit upon.\n\n5. They brought water in a vessel for him to wash his feet, and also gave him camphor and betel and pan of the kind known as mitha bhari. Then the king said, \"Thy arrival here, Reverend Sir, is propitious.\n\n6. \"In my house there is growing up a damsel named Devaki. She is growing both in beauty and in virtue, and is exceedingly fair to look upon. Where shall I give her in marriage? I cannot find a worthy suitor.\"\n\n7. Narada thereupon proceeded to make astrological calculations, and then said to the king, \"In the city of Gokula is the house of Vasudeva. There give thou thy daughter Devaki in marriage.\n\n8. \"Devaki and Vasudeva are a perfect match for each other. In his house give thou her in marriage.\"\n\n9. On hearing these words, king Devaki was pleased, and despatched Narada with an invitation to king Vasudeva.\n\n10. He also invited with great honours the kings of the various (neighbouring) countries; the Ro-bh\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans came in crowds.\n\n11. They planted four R\u00e1m plantains in the court-yard (for the marriage seat). They filled the house with golden offering dishes and lamps with shades,* and they shortened the eight days preparatory ceremonies of Devaki's marriage to four days.\n\n12. They set Vasudeva and Devaki sitting together, and the kings of\n\n* Lit. Lamps which can be carried about.\nthe earth began to make presents of horses and elephants, each to the best of his ability.\n\n13. First the mother of the bride made her present. She gave them a hundred ships.\n\n14. After her the bride's brother made his present of a hundred cows.\n\n15. After him her father's eldest brother made his present. He gave only one cow, and it had a short tail.\n\n16. After him his wife made her present. She gave the reel of a spinning wheel.\n\n17. After her the bride's grandparents made their present. But they gave no present and no offering; they gave nought but hurry and bustle.\n\n18. After them the bride's maternal uncle made his present. He gave the iron ferule of a broken rice pestle.\n\n19. At this stage of the proceedings the excellent saint, after making astrological calculations, said \"Oh Kamsa, I see thy death in the womb of Devak\u00ed.\"\n\n20. On hearing these words, King Kamsa became extremely sorrowful in heart. He took his sword in his hand and would have slain Devak\u00ed.\n\n21. But five or six kings caught hold of him and held him back, while the reverend saint came up to him, and remarked as follows:\n\n22. \"Slaughter of a cow or of a Br\u00e1hman may be expiated by gifts, but he who slayeth a woman, with him travelleth his sin.\"\n\n23. Devak\u00ed and Vasudeva went to Gokula, and there each year she had a child to the number of seven.\n\n24. At each birth Vasudeva worshipped K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and finally K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a took up his abode in Devak\u00ed's womb.\n\n25. At the end of the month, on a moonlight night, Devak\u00ed showed signs of pregnancy.\n\n26. She took gil\u00e1 fruit and \u0101ml\u00e1 fruit and went to bathe; and on the way Holy Hari made himself visible to her in his full form.\n\n27. \"Oh Devak\u00ed, sweet Devak\u00ed, I ask for a little place within thy womb.\"\n\n28. Devak\u00ed said, \"To-day what dismay is mine. On all sides I see nought but a terrible darkness.\n\n29. \"The sun is hot, and the way seemeth long. I know not what God addresseth me from the sky.\"\n\n30. \"Fear not, Devaki, my gentle mother. I will kill for thee thy enemy\u2014I the Holy Hari.\n\n31. \"One day, within the limits of a single night, I will protect thee\nfrom the Club-bearer. I will slay the king with all his family. Truly a valiant act.\n\n32. \"The king will die saying, 'I am killed'. That I can prophesy. I will kill Kamsa the Asura. Short will be the time it will take me.\"\n\n33. Again on another occasion Devak\u00ed went to bathe, and in the form of dust the Holy Hari entered into her womb.\n\n34. On this side of the river bathed the chaste Devak\u00ed. On the other side bathed Ya\u015bod\u00e1 and Rohin\u00ed.\n\nYa\u015bod\u00e1 spake.\n\n35. \"Friend, Friend, Friend of my soul, I say unto thee, did not the Yamuna flow between us, I would clasp thee in my arms.\"\n\n36. When the river Yamun\u00e1 heard these words, he left the sands of his bed, and the two friends embraced each other where the water had just been flowing.\n\nYa\u015bod\u00e1 spake.\n\n37. \"Friend, Friend, Friend of my soul. Friend, I say unto thee a word. How many days and how many months art thou with child?\"\n\n38. When Devak\u00ed heard these words, she began to weep. \"What, dost thou my friend not know? My brother is my foe.\n\n39. \"On seven days hath he sent seven children of mine to Yama's abode. Other women remain pregnant for ten months and ten days, but I have been a year with child.\"\n\nYa\u015bod\u00e1 spake.\n\n40. \"Friend, Friend, Friend of my soul, hear the vow I make unto thee.\n\n41. \"If a holy daughter is born unto me, and if thou hast a son, do thou give him unto me.\" The two friends thereupon swore to observe this promise.\n\n42. \"One vow, two vows, the third time a vow. If this vow is broken, may evil befall us.\" The two friends thereupon swore to observe the promise.\n\n43. Up to her knees in water Devak\u00ed purified herself, and up to her breast in water she dipped herself five times.\n\n44. At a bad gh\u00e1t she dived, but it was at a good gh\u00e1t that she arose from the water.*\n\n45. The two friends exchanged their wet clothes for dry, and each lifted a water jar on to her hip, and went to her own house.\n\n* That is, Krish\u1e47a entered into her during the dive.\n46. After concluding her bath, Devak\u012b went home to her palace, and day by day, her body and limbs waxed in size.\n\n47. At this time the startled goblins of the night, the Asuras, came and wandered through every house and palace, and thus the scouts of King Kamsa approached his presence chamber.\n\n48. On his five sides, the king had five servants round him. The Sheriff and the Prime Minister and forty-two books of law.\n\n49. They played upon brazen and copper gongs and gonglets and clarionets. There is no counting the number of war trumpets and cymbals.\n\n50. The King said, \u201cOh musicians, cease playing. Let the scout tell the news he brings.\u201d\n\n51. The scout folded his hands and made obeisance. \u201cYour humble club-bearer hath seen that Devak\u012b is pregnant.\u201d\n\n52. When King Kamsa heard these words, he was as it were thunder-struck. He bent his head and did not utter a word.\n\n53. Early in the morning, the King bathed himself with water and sat down in the hall of audience with his five servants.\n\n54. The King said, \u201cMy servants, by what device can I escape? Hari hath taken birth to destroy me.\u201d\n\n55. The Sheriff and the Prime Minister said, \u201cOh King build a fort of iron. Environ it with elephants, horses, men-at-arms, and an army.\n\n56. \u201cAs long as that exists, no one\u2019s father wilt thou fear.\u201d The servants then proceeded, \u201cOh King thou feelest fear within thy soul\n\n57. \u201cTake thy sister Devak\u012b and fasten her up. When this child is born, we will send it to Yama\u2019s house.\u201d\n\n58. Kamsa on hearing this was pleased in mind, and called several times for his scouts; and while he was yet calling, they made their appearance.\n\n59. A scout clasped his hands and made obeisance. \u201cWherefore hath Your Majesty summoned us?\u201d\n\n60. The king addressed that scout with expressive eyes. \u201cGo, oh scout, to Gokula.\u201d\n\n61. One order of the king was as good as two to the scout. He took his spear and spear-head into his hand and ran by the shortest way.\n\n62. As he ran, the scout did not even stop to tie up his hair. He went straight to, and entered, the city of Gokula.\n\n63. The scout arrived at Gokula and swore an oath. (He said to Vasudeva) \u201cThe King\u2019s council is assembled and ill it bodeth thee. Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, ye will have to cross the Yamuna.\u201d\n\n64. The Holy Krishna then addressed them with a sweet voice, \u201cGive the scout sweetmeats and water to eat.\u201d\n65. The scout ate sweetmeats and water (to satiety), and left some uneaten, and then he placed Vasudeva and Devak\u00ed before him, and produced them in the King's council.\n\n66. With hands clasped Vasudeva made obeisance, saying, \"Wherefore hath the great king summoned me?\"\n\n67. The King said, \"Oh Vasudeva, N\u00e1rada, the saint of old, hath told me time on time, that my death lieth in the hands of my sister's children.\n\n68. \"Ye two shall remain prisoners in my fort, and when thy child cometh into existence, I will send him to Y\u00e1ma's abode.\" But Devak\u00ed, when she heard these words began to weep.\n\nDevak\u00ed spake.\n\n69. \"My Brother, I have lost my second self. Thou hast not let one single daughter of mine remain before thee. Brother, may thy horses and thy elephants die, and may thy wife become a widow; may thy p\u00e1gar\u00ed fall of itself from off thy head.\"\n\n70. King Kamsa said to the scout, \"(Why art thou standing idle?) Art thou looking for thy father's head. Thrust Devak\u00ed into the fort.\"\n\n71. Devak\u00ed said, \"Who speaketh these words to me, evil and yet good.\"\n\n72. The scout arose and spake, \"Vasudeva is thy husband. Thou art the sister of the king. Who shall speak ill of thee?\"\n\n73. Then they bound Vasudeva and Devak\u00ed, and instantly made preparations.\n\n74. And with eighty maunds of iron they built a fort. Outside, it was closed and over it an iron net.\n\n75. Weeping Devak\u00ed laid herself down to sleep, and sitting by her head N\u00e1r\u00e1yana showed himself to her in a dream.\n\n76. \"Why, my mother, why do ye both weep? In thy womb the lord N\u00e1r\u00e1yana hath taken up his abode.\n\n77. \"One day, within the limits of a single night, will I protect thee from the Club-bearer. I will slay the king with all his family. Truly a valiant act.\"\n\n78. \"I have determined to be born in Gokula. All the gods from Indra downwards will attend at the ceremony.\" Then Devak\u00ed awoke from sleep.\n\n79. \"Awake, awake my lord, the crown* of my head. This night, just before dawn I dreamt a dream. N\u00e1r\u00e1yana hath taken up his abode in my womb.\n\n80. \"'I have determined to be born in Gokula,' saying these words he left me and went to heaven.\"\n\n* Literally \"umbrella.\"\n81. Krishna summoned the gods urgently, and they came, and made obeisance to him with hands clasped, \"Wherefore, Oh Mighty Lord, hast thou summoned us?\"\n\nKrishna Spake.\n\n82. \"I have determined to be born in Gokula. 'Come ye all, and raise a storm of wind and rain. Hear ye now, oh gods, my resolution.'\"\n\n83. They took fifty-two times sixteen scores of winds and clothed themselves in them. Silavati was dressed in forty times sixteen scores of hail-stones.\n\n84. Indra clothed himself in twelve clouds, and they roared like unto the roar of a lion or of an elephant.\n\n85. For seven nights and nine days the storm raged in Gokula.\n\n86. The clouds poured forth in streams. The hail began to fall like thunder-bolts.\n\n87. Plants and trees were broken. The trees flew about like dust. The Sriphala tree fell, and the tiger ran away with a broken tail.\n\n88. The scouts of king Kamsa fled and hid themselves under the m\u0101ch\u0101s* of the householders. The messengers and the archers fled, running at the top of their speed.\n\n89. One messenger fled to where the ploughmen were. He laid aside his sword and shield and took to weeding the field.\n\n90. Another scout ran into the house of a woman fresh from childbed. He took the p\u0101gar\u012b off his head and with it began to cleanse the child.\u2020\n\n91. He said to the wife, \"Mother, mother, close the door. Who again will enter (such) service (as mine), may his wife be unto him as his mother.\n\n92. \"I would sooner turn a beggar, and support an old father and mother, and break up my sword and shield, and fashion them into scythes and hatchets.\"\n\n93. As the day has been, so is the night. Devak\u012b hath a child and the neighbours know it not.\n\n94. He is born of a dark complexion, with a garland of wild flowers round his neck. The tune of his nostrils is like the melody of a flute.\n\n95. A pearl coronet on his head, a Sriphala and a lotus in his hand. On his right standeth Lakshmi, on his left Sarasvati.\n\n96. He tottereth as he goeth. His feet wear a pair of anklets. Round his neck a glorious golden wreath.\n\n* A kind of bamboo divan. \u2020 Lit. 'Ano faeces detergens.'\n97. Indra cometh on his elephant Air\u00e1vata. Sachi cometh in her chariot of flowers. Mother Earth cutteth his navel string.\n\n98. The Mother saith \"My son, my son. Show me the moon-face of my child. Why hath he come into the house of a luckless one?\"\n\n99. \"Even now Kamsa's scouts invest each house and room. He will dash thee to death upon a stone.\"\n\n100. In a dark room Krish\u00f1a is born, and he shineth pure and radiant as the moon-light. As he issueth from her womb, and falleth upon the ground, he speaketh unto her.\n\nKrish\u00f1a spake.\n\n101. \"I have dwelt in my mother's womb, and have given her great pain. It is true it is a Sunday, but my mother's face is pale as the Moon.\n\n102. \"Speedily my mother, come to Gokula, Kamsa must not escape.\" But Devak\u00ed exclaimed, \"Alas!\" and struck the pillow with her arm, saying \"Who will call me Krishn\u00e1's mother?\"\n\n103. Every one rejoiced and gave vent to cries of victory. Vidy\u00e1dhara\u015b danced, and Gandharvas sang with joy.\n\nKrish\u00f1a spake.\n\n104. \"My Father, hear my words. Make me a changeling in the house of Nanda the cow-herd.\"\n\nVasudeva spake.\n\n105. \"The first man-at-arms waketh and watcheth with bow and arrows in his hand. My child, when I see trident-bearers watching, my heart faileth me.\n\n106. \"Ulm\u00e1n and Surm\u00e1n wake and watch, and their voice is mighty. Other staff-bearers and spear-bearers wake and watch in all directions.\n\n107. \"My child, shield-bearers wake and watch with shields upon their shoulders. Gun-bearers wake and watch with guns in their hands.\n\n108. \"Nepu the man-at-arms waketh and watcheth behind the palace.\n\n109. \"My child, the fort and moat are all awake. Every one is now present. Faithful old servants of King Kamsa wake and watch around.\n\n110. \"On the backs of elephants mahauts watch. On horseback sit watchmen ready. Eight trumpeters sound bugles night and day.\n\n111. \"My child, scholars and teachers alike wake for thee. How, Krish\u00f1a, my Son, can I take thee away.\"\n\n112. Krish\u00f1a heard these words with delight, and began to call for the goddess of sleep: and while he was yet calling, she appeared.\n\n113. With hands clasped the goddess of sleep made obeisance. \"Wherefore hath My Lord called me?\"\nKrishna Spake.\n\n114. \"I tell thee Sleep; and pay thou heed unto my words. Cast thou the city of Kamsa into an oblivious sleep.\"\n\n115. The Goddess of Sleep replied, \"Remain at ease,\" and she let loose Uhil\u00ee and Kuhil\u00ee, her two sleep-slaves.\n\n116. The first man-at-arms fell asleep, in his hand his bow and arrow. The three trident-bearers fell asleep, terrible as they were to look upon.\n\n117. Urm\u00e1n and Surm\u00e1n of mighty voice fell asleep; and so did the villain staff-bearers and arm-bearers in all directions.\n\n118. So did the gun-bearers with their guns in their hands, and the shield-bearers with their shields on their shoulders.\n\n119. The fort and moat fell asleep, every one as he had come; so did the old and trusted servants of king Kamsa.\n\n120. The mahauts slept on their elephants and the guards upon their horses. The eight trumpeters also slept.\n\n121. Also all the scholars and teachers fell asleep. One by one the whole capital became inert and senseless.\n\n122. Then Krishna said unto his Father, \"My Father, take me away.\" And as they got outside the fort, the rain and storm ceased.\n\n123. For the sake of the All-mother of the universe, Mahe\u015bvara went in front. Gods and Gandharvas accompanied them, and sandy islands rose in the Yamuna.\n\n124. When Vasudeva saw the Yamuna's waves, he became filled with terror, saying, \"How can I cross the river?\"\n\nKrishna Spake.\n\n125. \"See Father, in front of us even jackals have been able to cross. The water will not reach thy knees. So take me in thy bosom and pass over.\n\n126. \"Let not there be fear in thy mind, My Father. I have come into thy house, the fruit of thy many pious deeds. Home thou art of all the virtues. Hear my words and place me in the cow-herd's house.\n\n127. The father took the abode of virtues into his bosom and descended into the water. Holy Krishna bathed.\n\n128. And Vasudeva searched for Him amidst the waters of the Yamuna.\n\n129. He searched in the water, nor could he find Krishna. He became sorrowful in heart.\n\nVasudeva Spake.\n\n130. \"Devak\u00ed hath wasted away of grief for her seven former children; and now when she heareth of this, she will surely die.\"\n131. The Holy Hari cried to his father, \"I am bathing. Wherefore art thou weeping with distracted mind?\"\n\n132. \"For ten months and ten days was I within my mother's womb. I have not been suckled by her, and I have bathed to purify myself from the taint.\"\n\n133. He searched in the water and found him. He took him into his bosom saying, \"Where are my Friend* and her husband?\"\u2020\n\nVASUDEVa SPAKE.\n\n134. \u2020\"The fruit of many virtuous actions, Krishna, hath been born in my house. Bring forth and show me thy Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1y\u00e1.\"\n\nNANDA SPAKE.\n\n135. \"In my house hath been born a daughter. I have called her Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1y\u00e1. In form and virtues is she truly beauteous.\"\n\nKRISHNA SPAKE.\n\n136. \"If thou givest one damsel, Oh Nanda, thou wilt give salvation to a thousand generations. Thou shalt see, what I, the Holy Hari, can do for thee.\"\n\n137. He took the Holy Hari to his bosom, his eyes glistening like two diamonds; and gave in exchange Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1y\u00e1.\n\n138. What woman that beareth child hath given place in her womb to one like Him. Or what pangs did Vasudeva suffer as he returned home after exchanging his child.\n\n139. The rain and storm ceaseth and Kamsa's scouts, again surround the house, and send the news to the king by the mouth of a messenger.\n\n140. \"A daughter hath been born to thy sister.\" When the king heareth the news, he hasteneth (to the fort).\n\n141. Forth he draggeth Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1y\u00e1. He dasheth her upon a washerman's stone, and forth she riseth in the air in the form of a celestial female.\n\n142. Away flieth Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1y\u00e1, and as she goeth she saith, \"Hear me, uncle. I say unto thee what concerneth thee.\n\n* Yasod\u00e1.\n\u2020 Nanda.\n\u2021 We must now suppose that Vasudeva has crossed the Yamuna and has met Nanda, whom he is now addressing. Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1y\u00e1 is of course Yoga Nidr\u00e1, who took birth as the child of Yasod\u00e1.\n143. \"He who will slay thee, waxeth strong in Gokula. Go forth and see him in the house of Nanda, the cow-herd.\"\n\n144. When King Kamsa heard these words, he was pleased, and on the spot summoned his scouts.\n\n145. His Prime Minister arose and made reply, \"On the ocean at K\u00e1lidaha is a friend of thine. On the shores of K\u00e1lidaha is the house of Unaku\u1e6di the N\u00e1ga.\n\n146. \"He will amite the child upon the breast. Truly a valiant deed.\"\n\n---\n\nThe concluding poem is an interesting account of the twelve seasons. It is supposed to be the soliloquy of a woman of the Bedhya caste during the absence of her husband on a peddling tour. The Bedhyas here, as in other districts, have the reputation of being half gipsies, half thieves. Their ostensible means of livelihood is a petty traffic in h\u00e1mak\u00fa (a kind of Rangpur\u00ed tobacco prepared for chewing), camphor, cloves, and other spices which they sell to women. I have ventured in this case to attempt a metrical paraphrase, instead of a literal translation. The original is so extremely compressed, and so full of allusions to agricultural life, that it would be almost unintelligible without a full commentary.\n\nThe piece partakes more of the nature of a Bh\u00e1n\u00e1 or dramatic monologue (Cf. Wilson's Theatre of the Hindus, Vol. II, p. 384), than of any other species of Sanskrit composition with which I am acquainted. The reciter's husband, Nil\u00e1 Bedhya, has gone on a voyage down the Ganges to the southern regions, where the tide ebbs and flows, and he is absent a whole year. She describes each month how she looks forward to his return, in simple but feeling language. It is a great relief to come to it after the eternal viraher anala of the orthodox book-school.\n\nIn the month of Pausha, she hints that advances have been made to her by some rich neighbour, who offers to make her his d\u00e1s\u00ed; not at all an uncommon occurrence in this district, where women are bought and sold, and stolen like cattle. The arguments used are curious enough, and characteristic. The seducer says, \"You had better come to me. You are alone and have no friends. This is the cold month of Pausha, and you will surely die. You will have no one to burn your body, and it will be thrown away into the fields to rot. So thick will be the winter mists that even the vultures and the jackals will not see your body to devour it.\"\n\nIn M\u00e1gha and Ph\u00e1lguna, every one who can bear a hand is hard at work in the fields. Jute is being cultivated, and the a-u\u015b dh\u00e1n, one of the main food staples of the district, is being planted. The very fishermen are hard at work, building low embankments round the rapidly drying pools, and subse-\nquently baling out the water to catch the tiny fish which swarm therein. Thus the only people left at home are the gurus mah\u00e1s'aya of the village school, and the pupils who are supposed to be under his care. The latter yield to the temptations of the cool spring season, as school-boys do all over the world, and, relieved of the supervision of the elder branches of the family, run truant and riotous throughout the village. Great is the damage done by them, and great the rage excited amid the elders on their return from their day's work; and, as no parent can see anything but good in his own offspring, the unfortunate guru is made the scapegoat for all the mischief done. The boys certainly have been naughty, but it is equally certain that it is the mah\u00e1s'aya's fault. This forms the subject of the episode related under the month of Ph\u00e1lguna.\n\nIn Vais\u00e1khha, the wife remembers that there is rejoicing in every home, while she alone is miserable. The p\u00e0dd, or thatch covering, of the rice-stores of the past year is first broken in this month. While everything is happy, she can do nought but think of her husband, and be tortured by jealous suspicions as to his conduct in the far country.\n\nAt the commencement of the rains, when storms are prevalent, and her heart is anxious for the wanderer tossed about amidst the tidal waters of the Sundarbans, the happier women of the village gibe at her and give her false news of the death of her husband.\n\nAt the height of the rains, the Komda, a large fish-eating bird which haunts the banks of the Brahmaputra, utters its loud tub, tub, the livelong night. The people say that it is a ghost who is speaking, and every one considers it an omen of ill-luck when he hears it.\n\nIn Bh\u00e1dra, the T\u00e1l fruits ripen and fall to the ground. They lie there, and apparently decay, but if opened even after many days, they will be found to contain a clear transparent kernel of great delicacy. The wife is led to compare this wonderful power of retaining its beauty and freshness, with her own comeliness, and to fear that before Nil\u00e1 returns, she may be an old and haggard woman.\n\nThe rest of the monologue, I hope, explains itself, and so I introduce it without further preface.\n\n\u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e\u0930 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915

Many of the words used are devoid of mean-\ning even to the singers. They have found them in the song, and it is not\ntheir business to alter things written in the Satya Yuga. Sometimes they\nare unable to explain whole passages, saying, \"It is a Satya yuger katha,\nhow are we to know it.\" For other words they have a traditional meaning,\nwhich I am fain to accept for want of a better. For instance, I am told\nthat \u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e, in the Tiger song, means \"both\", and have translated it\nso, because I fail to trace the derivation of the word. There are several\ngentlemen throughout the district who take an intelligent and lively inter-\nest in its dialect, but even their help has been sometimes ineffectual in un-\nravelling a Gordian knot.\nNotes on the Bhars and other Early Inhabitants of Bundelkhand.\u2014By Vincent A. Smith, B.A., B.C.S.\n\n(With one plate.)\n\nThe origin, history and fate of the Bhar* tribe have long afforded material for speculation and enquiry to students of local antiquities and history in the eastern districts of the N. W. P. and Audh, but hitherto no attempt seems to have been made to trace the westward extension of the race, or to collect any information concerning it in the districts west of All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d and Banda. The following notes are the result of observations and enquiries made in the Ham\u00edrpur District during the last two years, and, incomplete and fragmentary though they are, they will I hope be found to supplement usefully the information previously collected by observers in the eastern districts and to throw some light on the history of the Bhar tribe.\n\nThe Census returns of 1872 give the total number of Bhars in the N. W. P. as 243,462, and of R\u00e1j Bhars as 13,481, the grand total being 256,943: the district details\u2020 show that the tribe is now almost exclusively confined to those eastern districts which were formerly included in the Province of Benares and in the kingdom of Audh: the census figures may not perhaps be perfectly accurate, but they certainly indicate correctly in a general way the distribution of the tribe throughout the N. W. P.\n\nIt will be observed that not a single Bhar is recorded as residing in any of the Bundelkhand districts; it is, however, well known that the Bhars were once numerous in Banda, and the information which I have collected proves that in former times they lived in every part of the Ham\u00edrpur District, and were even found in the Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed District west of the Dha-s\u00e1n River: how much farther west they may have extended I have at present no means of judging, but it is evident that the tribal movement has been from the west eastwards, and it would therefore appear that the answer to the question \u2018who were the Bhars\u2019? should be sought, not, as has hitherto been done, in the localities where they have been driven to bay, but rather in those western regions from which they emigrated.\n\nThe former presence of the Bhars in the Ham\u00edrpur District is attested by the traditions, which will be presently described, and by local names in every pargana. A few examples of such names out of many may be of\n\n* The name is usually spelt \u2018Bhar\u2019, but the spelling \u2018Bharr\u2019 would more accurately represent the pronunciation.\n\n\u2020 Details are:\u2014\n\nR\u00c1J BHAR.\u2014Jaunpur (256): A\u2019zamgarh (316): Gh\u00e1zipur (5,631): Gorakhpur (1,464): Bast\u00ed (5,814). Total 13,481.\n\nBHAR.\u2014Meerut (22): Bad\u00e1on (14): \u00c1gra (130): K\u00e1nhpur (1248): All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d\ninterest; thus, the old name of the town of Sumerpur (in Parg. Sumerpur) is Bharu\u00e1, and in the parganas of Maudh\u00e1, Panw\u00e1ri-Jaitpur, Jal\u00e1lipur, and R\u00e1th, respectively, we find localities named Bharasaw\u00e1n, Bharw\u00e1r\u00e1, Bhar-kh\u00e1r\u00ed or Barkh\u00e1r\u00ed, and Bhanraur\u00e1 Kher\u00e1, and in several of these cases the evidence of the name is confirmed by that of tradition.\n\nThere seems to me to be little doubt that the Bhars are a non-Aryan race, and are the congeners of the Gonds, Kols, Bhils, and other more or less wild and predatory hill tribes who once occupied Bundelkhand. It is, as Sir H. Elliot* observes, \u201cconfessedly very difficult to trace the connexion or difference between the aboriginal tribes of Bhars; Cher\u00fas, Seor\u00eds, and Kols\u201d, and Mr. Sherring\u2020 believes \u201cthat many of the aboriginal tribes of India were originally blended together.\u201d Whatever may be the precise connexion between the so-called aboriginal tribes, it is quite certain that several of them occupied Bundelkhand simultaneously and jointly, and I suspect that in traditions they are often confounded. For instance as in the case of M. Gund\u2021 (in Parg. Panw\u00e1ri-Jaitpur), where the name points apparently to the Gonds, the original settlers are spoken of as Cham\u00e1rs: in such cases I suspect that the term Cham\u00e1r is used in a vague way to cover the ignorance of the speaker, and is practically equivalent to \u201clow caste barbarian\u201d; the word Cham\u00e1r it will be remembered is not properly the name of a tribe, but simply means a worker in leather. I think it very probable that the Cham\u00e1rs, who now form the most numerous element in the low caste labouring population, are an extremely heterogeneous body, and have but recently been developed into a caste formed of the fragments of tribes, which were free from the trammels of caste, and were alike unclean and impure in the eyes of the Brahmans, and whose remnants have now been lumped together by Brahman pride as the men who work in leather, the unclean thing.\u00a7\n\nWe have no direct knowledge of the inhabitants of Bundelkhand at the dawn of history; our earliest piece of information is that afforded by Hiouen Thsang in the 7th century A.D., who states that the king of Kha-\n\n(76): Jaunpur (14,696): A\u2019zamgarh (74,144): Mirzapur (4,338): Benares (34,805): Gh\u00e1sipur (54,060): Gorakhpur (43,152): Bast\u00ed (17,822): Ga hw\u00e1l (456).\n\nTotal 243,462.\n\n[From N. W. P. Census Rep. I, pp. 105, 135.]\n\n* Beames\u2019 Elliot, I, p. 60, s. v. Cher\u00fa.\n\u2020 J. R. As. Soc. V., N. S., p. 399.\n\u2021 Here, as in many other villages in the south, a Gond ghost is locally worshipped.\n\u00a7 In connection with this subject, it may be noted that the kust\u00e1 or waistcloth, worn by the low caste women of Bundelkhand, seems to be the same garment as that used by the women of the Maiw\u00e1r Bhils (J. A. S. B., XLV, Pt. I, pp. 355 and 289); and the same dress is used by the Gonds (Beames\u2019 Elliot, s. v. Gond).\njur\u00e1ho was a Brahman. About 800 A.D., the Chandel dynasty arose and ruled in K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, Khajur\u00e1ho, and Mahob\u00e1, but the inscriptions which give us the names and lineage of the rulers tell us nothing of the ruled. Chand in his account of the Chauh\u00e1n and Chandel war (in 1184 A.D.) gives us a glimpse of the subjects of the Chandels in his list of the warriors of the Chandel prince Parm\u00e1l; the list names Isur D\u00e1s Lodhi Bhup\u00e1l, two Gonds, a Baghel, a Gahlaut, and others, but in what I have read of Chand's poem I have not found any mention of the Bhars. Famous though the Chandel dynasty is for the great embankments and splendid temples constructed under its auspices, I believe that, even in its flourishing days, the country was but very partially cleared, and was chiefly inhabited by sundry hill tribes, who owned indeed a certain allegiance to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but yet lived for the most part free of control, and indulged with little restraint in their hereditary propensities for fighting and plunder. According to the census returns of 1872, the Chandels in the Ham\u00edrpur District number only 656, and, although they were undoubtedly once much more numerous than now, I do not believe that they ever colonized the country in large force. In the Mahob\u00e1 pargana the Chandels are zamind\u00e1rs, I think, in only two villages; in the rest of the district I do not know of their holding a single village, and the local traditions of the many villages in every pargana which I have examined, in no case mention the Chandels as the former owners of the soil, but everywhere we find traces of Gonds, Kols, Bhils, Bhars, K\u00e1chh\u00eds, Ah\u00edrs, Cham\u00e1rs, and other low caste and outcast people as the original occupiers of the land.\n\nI believe then that the Chandels were simply a small clan who supplied the members of the ruling dynasty and much of the personnel of the local court, but who never supplanted the tribes that were in occupation of the soil previous to the rise of the dynasty. But the Bhars and Gonds and their fellows have now disappeared, or have at least lost all tribal individuality, and can no longer be identified under the old names, and other races are lords of the soil. In other parts of India a similar transfer of the land seems to have occurred, but there the history of the change is obscure and the details unknown; here, however, the outlines of the revolution can be clearly traced, and even some of the details can still be vividly presented.\n\nWhatever may be the truth with regard to eastern Audh, where Mr. Carnegyt with apparently considerable reason, doubts the reality of the fact of a R\u00e1jp\u00fat conquest, there is no doubt that in the Ham\u00edrpur District the Bhars, Gonds and other early occupiers of the soil, were in compara-\n\n* For some of this local information I am indebted to notes made by natives employed by Mr. W. Martin, C.S., and to his contributions to the N.W.P. Gazetteer.\n\n\u2020 J.A.S.B., Vol. XLV, (1876), p. 297 seq.\ntively recent times vanquished by force of arms and obliged to yield their lands to the conquerors, who either exterminated the vanquished or reduced them to a servile condition: in a great portion of the district the victors were R\u00e1jp\u00fats, but in extensive tracts they were Lodhis, themselves a tribe of probably non-Aryan descent. It is impossible to say exactly when this contest began and when it ended, but it was protracted and intermittent, and certainly lasted from 1080 A.D. to 1730 A.D., as I now proceed to show in some detail.\n\nThe S\u00e1rd\u00fal Charitra, a metrical chronicle of the B\u00e1gr\u00ed Th\u00e1kurs, relates the manner in which 750 of that clan treacherously destroyed at Kahr\u00e1, in the west of the Banda district, 1000 Kols and Bhils, and then seized their villages in the year 1137 Samvat = 1080 A.D.; the story is curious and interesting, but is too long to quote: it is to be observed that at the date mentioned in the chronicle the power of the Chandel dynasty was at its height. Another similar tribal record tells of the conquest of the Bhils in the same tract of country by the Mauh\u00e1r Th\u00e1kurs in the year 1239 Samvat = 1182 A.D.\n\nThe parganas of Ham\u00edrpur and Sumerpur are now almost exclusively held by Bais, Gaur, Gautam, and other Th\u00e1kur clans, most of whom retain more or less distinct traditions of their having entered the country from the north-west, cleared the jungle and founded the existing villages: for example it is still remembered how in the year 1405 Samvat = 1348 A.D., Bija Rai Gaur came from Ajm\u00edr and entered the service of Ham\u00edr Deo Karchuli, the founder of the town of Ham\u00edrpur, and settled his followers and relatives in twelve villages in the neighbourhood: and many other similar traditions might be related, though a precise date is not generally given.\n\nI have already mentioned that the local nomenclature of the northern parganas shows traces of the presence of the Bhars previous to the R\u00e1jp\u00fat invasions.\n\nIt is plain then that in large tracts of country the wild tribes had been early overpowered, but in many places they held their ground much longer: thus the story is told that the Bhars of Isl\u00e1mpur\u2020 in the north of the R\u00e1th pargana were punished by Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h for looting royal treasure, and it seems most probable that the prince referred to was Sher Sh\u00e1h\u2019s son Isl\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who reigned from 1545-58 A.D. and whose favourite capital was Gw\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1r.\n\nAt Maudh\u00e1 in the east of the Ham\u00edrpur District mention is made of\n\n\u2022 I use the form Lodhf in preference to Lodha, because the former is that commonly used in Ham\u00edrpur.\n\n\u2020 Here and in several neighbouring villages the Bhars are remembered as Bhar\u00e9 Th\u00e1kurs: the desire of low caste tribes to pass as R\u00e1jp\u00fats is well known.\nthe Kols so late as the year 1730 A.D., when a battle took place between Dalil Kh\u00e1n, a son of the S\u00fabahd\u00e1r of All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the Bundel\u00e1s, the latter being assisted by the Kols, with whom Dh\u00e1nuks, Kanjars, and Kayars are said to have been associated.\n\nThe foregoing details show the gradual manner in which the aboriginal* tribes have been supplanted.\n\nThe interesting question as to the nature of the religion of the Bhars was raised by Mr. Sherring,\u2020 and has since been discussed by Mr. Carnegy. The former gentleman came to the conclusion that the Bhars were Buddhists; and the latter arrived at the somewhat ambiguous result that the \"god-neglecting, caste-disregarding race\" which formerly held Eastern Audh were the Bhars.\u00a7 Mr. Sherring's arguments and the plates of Bhar sculptures, published in illustration of his essay, seem to me to prove that the religion of the Eastern Bhars was Jain rather than Buddhist, and the facts which I shall now mention are I think sufficient to raise a presumption that the Bhars and other aborigines of Bundelkhand during a period of at least two or three centuries professed Jainism, though perhaps not exclusively. It may well be that in earlier times they were Buddhists, for the close relation between the Jain and the Buddhist faith and the high antiquity of the former are only now beginning to be perceived.\n\nA tradition is current at Mahob\u00e1 that many years subsequent to the conquest of that city in the reign of Shih\u00e1b-udd\u00edn\u00a7 (1202-3 A.D.), Ajaip\u00e1l and Bhar and others, seven brothers who were Jains and Jog\u00eds and great magicians, became rulers of the country: Ajaip\u00e1l conquered Ajm\u00edr, but Bhar held Mahob\u00e1, and so oppressed the Musalm\u00e1ns that they invoked the aid of Malik Sh\u00e1h who came from the west, and after a bloody contest slew R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhar and his fourteen sons, whose wives then burned themselves without the aid of fire, the place where they sacrificed themselves being pointed out to this day as the Chaudah R\u00e1n\u00ed ki sati, i.e., the burning-place of the fourteen queens.\n\nMauza' Bharw\u00e1r\u00e1 in pargana Panw\u00e1r\u00ed-Jaitpur is said, according to the local tradition, to have been founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhar of Mahob\u00e1|| and to have been occupied by Lodh\u00eds in 1300 Samvat (= 1243 A.D.):\n\n---\n\n* I use the word 'aboriginal' as a convenient term, but as I have hinted above some of the so-called aborigines may themselves have moved from their original seat.\n\n\u2020 In the essay already quoted, p. 228.\n\n\u2021 J. A. S. B., XLV, Pt. I, 299.\n\n\u00a7 Mr. Blochmann, in J. A. S. B., XLIV, Pt. I, p. 277, proves the correct date of the conquest.\n\n|| A tradition is quoted in N. W. P. Gaz. I, pp. 406-7, to the effect that a temple at Dadhw\u00e1 Manpur Garrampur in pargana Badaus\u00e9 of the Banda District was the treasury of the Bhar R\u00e1j\u00e1s of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, whose descendants continued to use it until a recent date: this is the only reference I know to Bhar R\u00e1j\u00e1s of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar.\ntrating the supposed connection between the Bhars and Jainism, it is noticeable that at Dina\u00ed about a mile from Bharw\u00e1ra there is a colossal Jain image of Setn\u00e1th with an inscription dated 1196 Samvat (= 1189 A.D.), and the ruins of a highly ornamented temple are a conspicuous object on an adjoining hill top. In other localities I have found at and near Bhar sites small Jain sculptures which it would be tedious to specify. The earliest known Jain inscription in Bundelkhand, (supposing its date to be correctly read, which is doubtful*) is one at Khajur\u00e1ho, dated 1011 Samvat = 954 A.D., in the reign of King Dhanga; the other Jain inscriptions from Khajur\u00e1ho and Mahob\u00e1, enumerated by General Cunningham (Arch. Rep. II, 448), range from 1142 to 1234 Samvat, i.e., 1085 to 1177 A.D.: eight additional dated Jain inscriptions, which I know of in various places in the Ham\u00edrpur District, range from 1196 to 1232 Samvat = 1189 to 1175 A.D. At Khajur\u00e1ho all the important temples, whether Vaishnava, Saiva, or Jain, seem to have been erected in the eleventh century A.D.\u2020: we may therefore safely affirm that Jainism flourished in Bundelkhand during the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. side by side with other forms of religion, and we have already seen that during the same period much of the country was occupied by the Bhars and other aboriginal tribes.\n\nI have already mentioned that Mr. Sherring's arguments to my mind proved the eastern Bhars too to be Jains; chance enables me to offer a fact in confirmation of this theory.\n\nI lately obtained from Banda a collection of hymns to the twenty-four deities of the Digambar Jains as there recited at a Jain shrine: the first hymn is addressed to Adin\u00e1th, and its opening lines which I quote\u2021 below, show that the ruined Bhar stronghold Pamp\u00e1pur near Mirz\u00e1pur, the locality described in detail by Mr. Sherring, is still a sacred place of the Jains.\n\nA Bh\u00e1t supplied my pandit with lists, as complete as he could remember, of the Bhar and Gond\u00a7 tribal deities; the following he named as the Bhar gods:\n\n* Cunningham, Arch.

It is possible that the Bhains\u00e1 Darw\u00e1za, one of the gates of the town of Mahob\u00e9, may be named after Bhainsesur.\n\nAntiquarian visitors to Mahob\u00e9 are familiar with the temple of Maniy\u00e1 Deo, the tutelary deity of the Chandel R\u00e9j\u00e1s; it is curious that the only other shrine in the Ham\u00edrpur District, so far as I know, dedicated to this divinity is found at a village named Barel in pargana R\u00e1th, where there are indications near the modern village, which is occupied by a Lodh\u00ed population, of the former existence of a town or large village which has long since disappeared. This locality seems to be the Bharel* named by the above quoted Bh\u00e1t as one of the Bhar villages, and some sculptures exist in the village such as are found at Bhar sites. It becomes, therefore, possible that Maniy\u00e1 Deo was a Bhar goddess, and, if this be the fact, the circumstance throws some light on the origin of the Chandel race, which is admittedly impure. I had not an opportunity of seeing the object of worship at Barel, but the cherished image at Mahob\u00e9, which I have seen, is simply a shapeless block of stone daubed with red, and evidently represents none of the Hind\u00fa gods, whereas it is exactly such an object as we might expect to be the fetish of a tribe of hill men. There is not, so far as I am aware, any tradition of a close connection between the Chandels and the Bhars,\u2020 but with the Gonds the Chandels are known to have maintained constant intercourse, sometimes friendly, and sometimes hostile. Chand tells us that the Chandel R\u00e9j\u00e1 K\u00edrat Singh hunted at Maniy\u00e1 G\u00e1ph with Singh the Gond chieftain of G\u00e1ph\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1 on the Narbad\u00e1, and that afterwards when war broke out, K\u00edrat Singh was taken prisoner by the Gonds, an injury which was revenged by Alh\u00e1 in the reign of Parm\u00e1l. The name of the Gond hunting ground Maniy\u00e1 G\u00e1ph inevitably suggests that Maniy\u00e1 Deo may be a Gond as well as a Bhar deity, and, if this supposition be correct, an additional proof is obtained that there was little difference between Bhar and Gond. In the hills of the Kaim\u00far Range in R\u00edw\u00e1, east of Bundelkhand, the Bhars, Suriy\u00e1s, Cher\u00fas, Binds, and Kharw\u00e1rs may still be\n\n* The loss of the initial aspirate in local names is very common; thus in the Ham\u00edrpur District, Bilrakh and Bilahapr\u00ed were formerly Bhil villages, and in Audh (J. A. S. B., XLV, Pt. I, p. 300) Bado\u00ed, Barros\u00e1, Bark\u00edch, and Barel\u00ed derive their names from the Bhar; and many similar examples might be given.\n\n\u2020 Oldham, \u2018Stat. Memoir of Ghazipur\u2019 (I, 48), states that Chandel R\u00e9j\u00e1put\u00e1 murdered the Bhar R\u00e9j\u00e1 and founded the principalities of Bijai\u00e1gh, Bardhi, and Barhar in the R\u00edw\u00e1 territories.\nfound intermingled, and \"intermarriage between the daughters of the Kharw\u00e1r chief and a Chandel R\u00e1jp\u00fat prince is mentioned in the annals of Bundelkhand.\"* In Lalatpur, too, the connection between the Gonds and Chandels seems to be remembered,\u2020 and the story of the marriage of Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed of the Chandel line with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garha Mandl\u00e1\u2021 shows that the connection subsisted so late as the sixteenth century A.D.; there is therefore nothing improbable in supposing that the myth of the union of Hem\u00e1vat\u00ed with the moon as related in the Chandel legends was invented to conceal the fact that the Chandels really sprang from an aboriginal stock; whether this stock was called Bhar or Gond we cannot say, and, if I am right in thinking the two tribes to be very closely connected, the question is of no importance. The construction of the great Vijayanagar or Bij\u00e1nagar lake near Mahob\u00e1 is attributed to the Gaharw\u00e1rs, who are said to have preceded the Chandels in that part of the country, and I think it is not unlikely that the Chandel clan is the result of crossing Gaharw\u00e1r with Bhar or Gond blood: the popular legends indeed assert the fact of relationship between the Gaharw\u00e1rs\u00a7 of Benares and the Chandels.\n\nThe Bhars of Bundelkhand, so far as we know them, seem to have possessed little of the arts of civilization, and to have consequently left behind them almost nothing of architectural or artistic interest. In the eastern districts the Bhars are credited with the construction of many tanks and massive forts, but in Ham\u00edrpur I have not met with a single fort or tank the construction of which is ascribed to them; everything old is indiscriminately called Chandel, and is usually placed to the credit of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Parm\u00e1l or his famous champions Alh\u00e1 and Udal: it is, however, probable that some of the works attributed to the Chandels were executed by other races. The commonest objects of antiquity in the district are rude bas-reliefs of Hanum\u00e1n, here usually called Mah\u00e1b\u00edr, and there is scarcely one of the numerous sites of ancient abandoned villages, whether Bhar or otherwise, which is not marked by an image of the monkey-god.\n\nUpright slabs or pillars of granite bearing on one face a pair of rudely carved figures in relief, are met with in many places. The design consists of two standing figures, one male, and the other female, holding each other by the hand: at the top left hand corner of the stone there is a detached\n\n---\n\n* Chandra Sekhara Banurj\u00ed, in J.

Jaitpur was occupied by Gonds, who were expelled by the Bundelas and Marathas. At an ancient village in pargana R\u00e1th I found two of these stones, and close by, a sati pillar of the ordinary type* bearing only the emblems of a female hand and arm with the sun and moon, but without human figures. Stones sculptured with the sun and moon emblems, unaccompanied by either figures or hand, are often met with.\n\nRude effigies of single warriors, armed with a bow, or with a round target and a short straight-pointed sword, are also common.\n\nI append a rough sketch or diagram (Pl. XIV) of a curious slab standing in the village of Tika Mau near Mahob\u00e1: the village is an ancient one, and is mentioned by Chand as belonging to Desr\u00e1j, father of Alh\u00e1 and Udal, and according to tradition was formerly occupied by Kurmis: the design resembles in general outline that of the \"sati-sat\u00ed\" sculptures above described, but differs in that the male and female figures are not holding hands and have heads resembling respectively a monkey and a bird, and that the detached hand is placed between the sun and moon.\n\nOn the surface of the mound marking the site of a Bhar village at Barenr\u00e1 in Jal\u00e1lpur, my pandit picked up the two curious objects figured at the bottom of Plate XIV. They look like seals or amulets, and the material seems to be the coarse soap stone found in the district: I cannot even guess the meaning of the characters engraved on them, but the open hand on the larger one is exactly similar to that carved on the stone monuments. As is the case at many ancient sites in the district, bricks of great size are found at Barenr\u00e1.\n\nThe Bhar site named Bhareswar near Rauro in pargana R\u00e1th is remarkable for an irregular circle formed of twelve large upright stones, close to which two other stones are lying prostrate: one of the slabs here is carved with five small detached rings, called nakat-gol by the people, which remind me of the \"cup markings\" in Kam\u00e1on, described by Mr. Carnac\u2020: coins are said to have been found at this spot, but as usual I could get no definite information about them.\n\nI have often seen at old sites slabs engraved with sets of concentric rings a foot or more in diameter, which most probably symbolize Mah\u00e1deo, as conjectured by Mr. Carnac with reference to the similar sculptures in Kam\u00e1on, or may perhaps be images of the sun as the villagers say.\n\n* Cunningham, Arch.

C. Bayley and Dr. Rajendralal Mitra are of opinion that the inscription described by me is not genuine, and their opinion is based on arguments which I readily admit to be conclusive: the forgery was a clever one, but not sufficiently clever to deceive competent scholars.\n\nI have therefore cut out from my paper all references to the inscription, and much other matter which rested on the authority of the pandit, who beyond doubt contrived the forgery.\n\nAll information derived from a tainted source is of course open to suspicion, and therefore I must specify the assertions still remaining in the text of my paper which rest on information supplied by the incriminated pandit.\n\nThe tribal records of the Bagrai and Mauhar Thakurs were furnished by him in copies: the originals he said he had met with while employed on a tour of investigation under the orders of the Settlement Officer at Banda: there seems to be no particular reason why these documents should have been fabricated.\n\nThe Jain hymns, one of which I quote, were also brought to me by the pandit, who professed to have taken them down from the dictation of a person who takes care of a Jain shrine at Banda; they are of little interest and not likely to be inventions.\n\nThe lists of Bhar and Gond deities, the name of Bharai as a Bhar village, and the names of Bilrakh and Bilahari as Bhil villages, rest on the authority of a Bhil as reported by the pandit, and I have no special reason to suppose these particulars to be untrue.\n\nThe seals or amulets, whichever they are, were brought in by him, and seem genuine; but I have not visited Baregr\u00e1 myself.\n\nAfter the excisions it has undergone, my essay, I fear, presents a very disjointed appearance, and retains little of value or of interest.\n\nV.

Shaw,\nPolitical Agent.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nThe Turkish tongues are of singular interest to the student of language. They are to him, what the mountains which surround their birthplace are to the geologist; who there can observe many of the vastest operations of nature and their results, naked as it were, and not veiled by the superficial covering which in other less barren countries makes the investigation and tracing out of the various formation so laborious a task.\n\nThe Indo-European languages are like an ancient building, where frequent restorations have interfered with the original design, and where finally a universal coat of plaster has destroyed all outward distinction between old and new. In the Turanian structure, on the other hand every tool-mark is still fresh, the places where the scaffolding has rested, are still visible, and we can almost trace each course of the stone-work to its origin in the quarry whence it was hewn.\n\nIt may seem strange that a language developed by the rude and nomad tribes of Central Asia, who in their own home have never known how to reduce it to rule (or rather to distinguish the laws through which they themselves had unconsciously formed it), should present in fact an example of symmetry in complexity such as few of the more cultivated forms of speech exhibit. Although its own people would have one believe that it is subject to no rule and almost purely arbitrary (their only notion of grammar being that of Arabic and Persian with which the Turki cannot be made to fit); yet in reality a few simple and transparent rules suffice to account for all its permutations. These rules, possessing an accumulative power, are enough to produce the immense variety of forms noticeable in the Eastern Turki.\n\nWe are now learning to believe that even in languages such as Greek, German, or even English, every seeming irregularity is really the result of laws, some of which we know and can trace in their action, and some of which are yet to be discovered. But in Turki we can see them; it is as if the centuries were to flow backwards, and we could watch the building of the Pyramids and solve by ocular demonstration the doubts of the learned as to the method by which the vast blocks were transported from the quarries, and placed in their present positions. We can even detect in some instances a commencement in this Turanian tongue, of the process by which the Aryan languages have been polished down and enamelled, as it were, till they reached their present condition.\nViewed in this light the study of the Eastern T\u00fcrki is seen to have an interest which is not to be measured by the amount of the commercial or other intercourse likely to be facilitated by it. For the Turkish tongues, a journey eastward is pretty nearly equivalent to a study of the earlier forms of an Indo-European language. In either case we get nearer to the source; and the less literary character of the former makes it easier to approach its origin in space than in time. R\u00e9musat, in his \"Langues Tartares\"* truly says: \"Le dialecte de Constantinople est celui de tous qui s'est le plus enrichi, je pourrais dire appauvri, par l'introduction de mots Arabes et Persans; et l'on n'en rencontre que fort peu dans la langue des T\u00fcrks voisins de la Chine, o\u00f9 l'on peut, pour cette raison, esp\u00e9rer de retrouver l'antique langue T\u00fcrke dans un \u00e9tat plus voisin de sa puret\u00e9 primitive.\"\n\nValikhanoff (the son of a Kirghiz chief in the Russian service, whose name, Vali Kh\u00e1n, with the affixed Russian patronymic ending off, is significant of Russia's progress among those tribes) writes:\u2020 \"The language......spoken in K\u00e1shghar is altogether unknown to European savants\", and Prof. V\u00e1m\u00e9ry, in quoting him, adds that this language \"has incontestably the most primitive words and formations amongst all Turkish forms of speech.\"\u2021\n\nIn the Turkish of K\u00e1shghar and Yarkand (which some European linguists have called Uighur,\u00a7 a name unknown to the inhabitants of those towns, who know their tongue simply as T\u00fcrki), we can obtain a glimpse backwards at a state of the language when the noun (which in Western Turkish is almost inflected) was but a rude block, labelled if necessary by attaching other nouns, &c., to show its relation to the remaining words of a sentence, as in Chinese. Of these attached words we can still see the meaning and special force, and can even use some of them as independent parts of speech (see below in Chapter III and Chapter VII, Numerals). It requires scientific dissection to extract and realize the meaning of the genitive element in the Latin word \"ros\u00e6,\" for instance; but the T\u00fcrki genitive ulus-nung (\"tribe's,\" lit. \"tribe property\") bears its origin on its face, and it cannot be very long ago that the word \"nung\" or \"neng\" would have been used freely to mean \"goods\" or \"possessions\", as it is in the Kudatku-Bilik|| (translated by Prof. V\u00e1m-\n\n* Page 250, edition 1820.\n\u2020 See Messrs. Michel's \"Russians in Central Asia\".\n\u2021 V\u00e1m\u00e9ry's \"Chagataische Sprach-studien\", p. 3.\n\u00a7 This would seem in many cases to be a misnomer as applied to the modern language of K\u00e1shghar.\n|| E.g. \u00fcla neng \"bestow (thy) property.\"\nThe mark of the accusative *ni* is at the present day in common use as an independent pronoun signifying \"what\".\n\nWhen we follow these affixes into Western Turkish, they seem to have lost their initial consonants, and to have sunk into mere inflectional terminations.*\n\nAt the early period above referred to, the verb was perhaps a mere noun of action, destitute of any conjugation, although afterwards labelled by means of certain syllables (originally independent words) to indicate the several times and modes of the action. Such compound words, which could hardly be considered verbs, would apply equally to the agent, the action, and the object acted upon. In this stage the T\u00fcrki verb would have answered to the description of the same part of speech in an allied tongue: \"The Tibetan verbs must be regarded as denoting, not an action or suffering or condition of any subject, but merely a coming to pass... ...they are destitute of what is called in our languages the active or passive voice, as well as of the discrimination of persons, and show nothing beyond a rather poor capability of expressing the most indispensable distinctions of tense and mood....... The inflection of verbs...is done in three different ways:......(c), by adding [to the Root] various monosyllabic appendices, the Infinitive, Participles, and so called Gerunds are formed.\" [Dr. Jaeschke's Tibetan Grammar, printed at the Moravian Mission Press at Kyelang, in British L\u00e1haul, Chapter VI, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30], (see also page 262, below).\n\nA further development of the language would consist in also labelling these verbal nouns with the several pronouns or the corresponding possessive affixes (according as the desired sense might require) to point out the subject of the action.; and thus were at last obtained several tenses of a real conjugation.\n\n* This will be seen by an inspection of the following comparative statement:\n\n| Root | K\u00e1shghari Post-positions | Osmanli terminations |\n|------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Nom. | *at*                    | ....                |\n| Gen. | *at*                    | *ning*              |\n|      |                         | -*ung* (*u\u0101*)       |\n| Dat. | *at*                    | *ga\u1e25*               |\n|      |                         | -*ah*               |\n| Acc. | *at*                    | *ni*                |\n|      |                         | -*i*                |\n| Abl. | *at*                    | *din*               |\n|      |                         | &c.                 |\n|      |                         | -*t\u016bn*              |\n|      |                         | &c.                 |\nAll these stages of the T\u00fcrki verb formation co-exist in the present language of Yarkand. If one asks a man whether he has seen so-and-so, he replies: \"k\u00f6rgan.\" This word may denote equally \"the person who sees\", \"the thing seen\", and \"the action of seeing.\" But in a case of ambiguity, or for greater emphasis, he might also answer: k\u00f6rgan-im b\u00e1r (lit. \"my seeing exists\"), or k\u00f6rgan-man (lit. \"I the seer\"). In one case the possessive (im \"my\"), and in the other the personal pronoun (man \"I\"), is affixed; and thus the 1st Person singular of two (Indefinite) Past Tenses is formed. These are the two typical modes of forming the persons of a tense, and there is no other.\n\nOut of such simple materials is the whole Turkish conjugation produced, which Prof. Max M\u00fcller compares to a tree with innumerable branches, each of which is bowed down to the earth by the weight of the fruit which it bears. The above form, k\u00f6r-gan, is but one of the several verbal nouns produced from the root k\u00f6r; the same root when labelled with other affixes, instead of gan, denoting different times (tenses) or modes (moods) for the action, forms various verbal nouns and participles. These participles, either attached to pronouns as above, or in composition with auxiliary participles which are so attached, produce the whole of the 270 (and odd) tense-persons of which a primary T\u00fcrki verb conjugation consists.\n\nR\u00e9musat charges the Eastern T\u00fcrki (Ouigour) with employing no true auxiliary verb, i.e., according to his definition, an auxiliary personal future or past tense applied to a participle, either future or past (not present). \"Il r\u00e9sulte de cette combinaison, des plusque-parfaits, des futurs, des parfaits compos\u00e9s, toutes choses inconnues en Ouigour.\"\n\nA further acquaintance has revealed to us, at least in modern Ouigour (\"actuellement la langue des habitants des villes depuis Khasigar jusqu'\u00e0 Kamoul\"), all these things which M. de R\u00e9musat had missed. Such tenses as gelip-idim, \"I had done\", gelip-bolurman, \"I shall have done\", gela-durghan-boldum, \"I have determined to do\" (lit. \"I have become about to do\"), answer completely to the above definition. Thus the T\u00fcrki tongue leaves nothing to be desired in the way of tense varieties.\n\nBut this is not all; for the root itself previous to the addition of any tense or mood terminations may have its meaning or application modified by other affixes (producing secondary Verbs, Passive, Causative, Reciprocal, &c.). By the accumulative faculty of the T\u00fcrki tongue these produce numbers of fresh forms. Like a gambler who \"doubles all round\", each of them adds to the former stock of words a number equal to that which existed without it. Going round to each tense of the original verb and of its compounds, it lays down another by its side. One peculiarity of the process called \"playing double or quits\" is, as\npointed out by Thackeray in the case of Mr. Deuceace, that after a given number of repetitions (which may be easily calculated) the original stake will have swollen to the size of the National Debt. Fortunately there is a limit to the number of times that a T\u00farki verb can double its tenses; but still it reaches a figure which sounds most formidable to those who do not know that they can acquire it by a process of multiplication, and are not bound to add each unit separately to the mass of their knowledge.*\n\nWith all these possible combinations before him, the T\u00fark of the East appears to construct his words on each occasion from the elements at his disposal (as a compositor sets up type), rather than to employ ready-made or stereotyped forms. He accumulates affix upon affix until he has completed his meaning, instead of looking about him for a single word to which that meaning is already assigned.\u2020 Hence his belief that his language is arbitrary and dependent only on his own will (notwithstanding the fact that he really, though unconsciously, works on distinct and simple principles), and hence also the fact that to him each element of his words retains its separate vitality and meaning. When a Frenchman says \"vous \u00eates,\" he has ordinarily no notion that in the termination \"-tes\" he is repeating the pronoun \"vous\" in another form. But an Eastern T\u00fark is perfectly aware of the meaning of the termination in the words dursiz, \"ye are,\" kelghaningiz, \"ye have done\" (\"your doing exists\"), and will not hesitate to use the same pronouns in other applications (as siz-gabirdim \"I gave to you,\" or even superfluously prefixed to the verb, as siz dursiz, \"ye are\"; and so also dt-ingiz, \"your horse\").\n\nAs has been justly pointed out by Prof. Max M\u00fcller, among nomad families and tribes the tendency to adopt peculiarities and corruptions of language is constantly being neutralized by meetings and by the necessities of intercourse with other families or tribes among whom no such peculiarities, or different ones, have sprung up; while these meetings do\n\n* It may easily be calculated how many separate elements require to be retained in the memory, in order to remember the vast number of forms of a single Eastern Turkish verb. Thus there are about 13 participial (and root) stems, and 25 different syllables or words used in the formation of tenses (including pronouns, auxiliary roots, and participles). There are also 6 modifying syllables, making the secondary verb-forms. Thus absolutely only 44 verb-elements require to be learned by rote, the combinations and permutations of which suffice to make up the entire T\u00farki verb conjugation amounting to nearly 29,000 possible forms applicable to each separate (transitive) verb root. See N. B. at end of \"Verbs.\"\n\n\u2020 In Eastern T\u00farki \"un-gct-at-able-ncss\" would be a perfectly legitimate form (indeed quite a characteristic one). Vide Yct-al-maslik, &c.\nnot usually last long enough to allow of the growth of peculiarities common to the whole nation. When people, however, settle down in communities and towns, a certain number of expressions become worn down, as it were, by daily use, and in such a state of society these corruptions would be likely to become fixed and permanent. In this process the rationale of the various formations becomes less evident; the elements of the words are so fused together as to become indistinguishable; from want of recognizable examples men cease to put together unconsciously each word as they want it, and begin to use only those to whose sound they have become accustomed, and which are as it were ready-made. Thus the language loses in its richness of perhaps superabundant forms. It leaves the fluid and enters the solid state.\n\nEven in Central Asia such a process has begun in the towns and villages. Who would recognize in the short word wopti the compound tense bol-up-ir-d-i, \"it had become.\" Yet a native of Khokand, who will use the former in conversation, will spell it out at the full length of the latter if he has occasion to write it. He has not yet lost his sense of the full force of every one of the five elements that build it up. To a stranger who knew that the infinitive was bolm\u00e1q (or even wolmd\u00e1q), the pluperfect wopti would seem a most irregular form, and would be no guide in forming the pluperfects of other verbs.\n\nThe Y\u00e1rkandi (who lives further East) has not proceeded so far in his corruption of the word. He contents himself with shortening it into bolupti (showing greater respect for the root). So aparado (or, as the Andij\u00e1nis say: aparade) is used, where the true form is al-ip-b\u00e1r-a tur-ur, lit. \"having taken (he) going is standing\" (viz., \"he is taking away\"). The intermediate steps are alip-b\u00e1ra-trur, then alip-b\u00e1ra-dur, then ap-b\u00e1ra-dur, and then apara-dur; the corruption going on independently in the several members of the word, converting alip into ap, fusing the initial b of b\u00e1r with the preceding p, and turning turur finally into do or de. So also the imperative of another compound verb is shortened from al-ip-kel to apke or even akk\u00e9. And thus some words travel West, from the desert their birthplace, leaving a letter behind them in each country where they halt, but bearing the scars indelible on their bodies.\n\nIn extending itself towards Europe the Turkish tongue seems to approach the inflectional stage of development. Even in such forms as wopte, apke, and do (for turur), the root itself, the very sanctuary of an agglutinative language, has been invaded. But, moreover, in Western Turkish the affixes or terminations have become so far blended with the verb that their origin has been lost sight of. Some Grammarians in their analysis have mistaken, for instance, the pronominal affixes for parts of\nan auxiliary verb. Thus *kilrum* is by them supposed to be formed from the participle *kilur* and the word *im* \u201cI am\u201d (which is in reality no verb, but a pronoun). M. de R\u00e9musat, in his most learned and interesting researches on the Tartar Languages, sees an anomaly in the fact that, while both in Osmanli and in Ouigour (defined as \u201cencore actuellement la langue des habitants des villes depuis Khasigar jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Kamoul\u201d) there exist the tenses, *kilur-um* and *kil-dum* formed respectively with two tenses of the substantive verb, viz., *im* (*um*), \u201cI am\u201d, and *idum* (-*dum*), \u201cI was\u201d; yet this verb only exists in Osmanli, and not in Ouigour. In other words, that tenses in a primitive Turkish language, (Ouigour) are formed by means of another verb which only exists in a later dialect (the Osmanli).\n\n\u201cPourquoi n\u2019y retrouve-t-on pas plut\u00f4t le radical Ouigour *erdi*, ou *dour*, ou *dourour*? Quelle cause peut avoir introduit un \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e9tranger dans la conjugaison des verbes, la partie la plus intime de la grammaire? Ce fait peu connu, si j\u2019avais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 en bien exposer toutes les circonstances, offrirait, ce me semble, un probl\u00e8me philologique assez curieux \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre.\u201d\n\nThe answer is interesting and illustrates the progress of language. The seeming problem results from the degree to which forms, clear enough in Eastern T\u00fcrki, have become corrupted and obscured in Western Turkish. Taking the Past Tense, *idum*, &c., first, this certainly exists in Ouigour, where it is written *erdim* (\u0625\u0631\u062f\u0645). The modern K\u00e0shghari supplies the missing link by writing this word as above *erdim* or *irdim* and pronouncing it *idim*. Thus the Ouigour \u201cradical\u201d or auxiliary *erdi* which M. de R\u00e9musat desired, is really present in the tense \u2018kildum\u2019, \u2018kildi\u2019, under its later form \u2018idum\u2019, \u2018idi\u2019, whose absence from Ouigour he laments.\n\nNext taking the Present Tense *kilar-um*, formed with a supposed Pres. Tense of the Verb Substantive, viz. *im* \u201cI am\u201d, &c.\u2014the following comparison with the corresponding K\u00e0shghar (so called Ouigour) or more primitive tense will solve the problem, or rather will show that there is none:\n\n| OSMANLI. | PRIMITIVE. |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Participle.** | **Kashghar (Ouigour.)** |\n| **Supposed Verb** | **Affixed Pronouns.** |\n| **Substantive.** | |\n| S. 1st. kelur | kelur ... man (=I) |\n| \u201e 2nd. kelur sen | kelur ... san (=thou) |\n| \u201e 3rd. kelur \u2014 | kelur ... \u2014 |\n| Pl. 1st. kelur iz | kelur ... miz (=we) |\n| \u201e 2nd. kelur siz | kelur ... siz (=ye) |\n| \u201e 3rd. kelur lar | kelur ... lar (=they) |\nIt is plain that the Osmanli terminations are merely survivals of the primitive affixed pronouns.*\n\nIn no case can it be allowed that such a series of dissimilar syllables is really one tense, or that they are parts of the verb \"to be.\"\u2020 An examination of the Yarkand and Kashghar dialects accounts for them in another way; and even were this not the case, analogy is against such irregularities of form in a Turkish verb, no sign even of a common root being apparent in the different persons.\n\nThus, if the Ouigour (Kashghar) form of Turkish does not possess such a Verb Substantive as im \"I am\" (as M. de R\u00e9musat justly says), so neither does the Osmanli. There is no element in these Osmanli tenses which does not exist independently in the so-called Ouigour or Eastern Turkist\u00e1n\u00ed. Though I have taken R\u00e9musat's words as my text (because they themselves suggest the comparison with a more primitive dialect), yet it would seem that many Grammarians are under the same misapprehension with regard to the supposed Osmanli substantive verb. The pronominal affixes have become so blended in the verbs, as almost to lose all trace of their origin, and what is this but a long step towards inflection.\n\nThus in the varied dialects of that wide-spread tongue which is spoken over 70 Degrees of Longitude, extending from under the shadow of the Great Wall of China and the head waters of the Yellow River almost to the shores of the Adriatic, we see a whole volume in the history of language unrolled before us. Nearly every stage in the development of speech, between the monosyllabism of China at one end and the highly developed inflectionalism of Europe at the other, can be studied in the dialects spoken by that Turkish race which forms a link between the extreme East and the extreme West of the Old World.\n\nIt is hoped that an account, however imperfect, of the more Easterly or primitive form of this tongue will not be without interest to students.\n\nIn the following pages it will be noted that the Perfect Participle has been written with a p, whereas in the Extracts it will be found to end in a \u03c5 (b). But it must be remembered that the T\u00fcrki writers\n\n* If it be urged that besides the use of the syllables im, sen, &c., as verb-terminations, they are also used with substantives and adjectives, &c., in the sense of the verb \"to be\"; this may be paralleled by the Eastern T\u00fcrki usage by which pronouns are affixed (without any verb) to substantives and adjectives and other pronouns, and yet do not cease to be pronouns: e.g. kichik-man \"I (am) small\"; T\u00fcrk-san, \"thou (art) a T\u00fcrk;\" shu-man, \"I (am) he\". The verb \"to be\" is simply 'sous-entendu' in these cases.\n\n\u2020 The present tense of irmak \"to be\" would be ira-man or irur-man, irur-san, &c. This tense is found in old books.\nare very chary of wasting more \"nugtas\" than they can help, and make but seldom a difference in writing (and sometimes in speaking) between \u03c1 and \u03c1 and between \u03be and \u03be. The sound given to the final letter of the Perfect Participle is distinctly that of p, as may moreover be discovered from the fact that it hardens the dentals which follow it (in affixes), e.g., bolu(p)-ti, and not bolu(b)-di, as would be the case according to the Rules of Phonetic Variation (which see) if the final consonant were soft.\n\nAgain, it will be seen that I have written a\u00eft-ti, ket-ti, whereas in T\u00fcrki manuscripts these words are often written a\u00eft-di, ket-di. This latter spelling is due to a recollection of the origin of the formation (viz., the presence of the auxiliary irdi or idi in a shortened form), but the pronunciation is in fact that of a double t; as in English the word written as \"cupboard\" is pronounced \"cubboard.\" The T\u00fcrki writers, however, very frequently recognise this pronunciation by merely putting a \"tashdid\" over the t instead of preserving the d in the second place (\u03c9 for \u03c9).\n\n---\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE LETTERS.\n\nThe letters employed in writing by the inhabitants of Eastern Turkistan are the same as those in general use among Muhammadan nations, viz., those of the Arabic alphabet. It is needless to describe their system of writing at any length since it is known to all Oriental scholars; only the peculiarities of pronunciation, form, or use, will be noted here.\n\nA, a in the beginning of words is often pronounced very broad (like aw); as in \u0101t = horse (pronounced awt or ot).\n\nIn other parts of a word, if preceding several consonants together, it is also often pronounced broad.\n\nEx.: b\u0101shqa = other (pronounced boshqa).\n\nIn other cases, however, it resembles the a in father.\n\nThe short pronunciation of a is that of our words ordinary, oriental, America, &c.\nIn some words the \\(a\\) is pronounced like the English \\(a\\) in 'hand', 'than', &c.\n\nEx.: Yarkand, pronounced something between that spelling and 'Yerkend'; at, 'name', pronounced like the English word 'at' (almost ett).\n\nN. B.\u2014As the people of Eastern Turkist\u00e1n are rather uncertain in their use of the long vowels in writing, the use of them in short syllables being common and not implying any lengthening of the sound, in the following pages the broad mark (\\(\\ddot{a}, \\ddot{e}, \\ddot{i}\\) and \\(\\ddot{u}\\)) will only be introduced when the sound is long, and not invariably wherever long vowels are used.\n\nEx.: \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0642 will be written b\u00e1\u0161lam\u00e1q (pronounced almost bosh-lamock). Although there are three 'alifs', yet only the first and third are pronounced long or broad. So also with the other vowels.\n\n\u0628 \u0628 B & P, often interchanged in writing, and often confounded in pronunciation.\n\n\u062a T, the ordinary oriental, or soft European sound.\n\n\u062c \u062c J & Ch, often interchanged; when preceding consonants, they both of them tend towards the pronunciation of the French 'j'; hence in that position they are often confounded with one another and with sh.\n\nEx.: 'ichku' = goat, almost like 'ishku' (and, vice versa, the word tap-shurdi has been found written tapjurdi).\n\nBefore vowels the distinction is better kept up.\n\nEx.: chiqm\u00e1g, jabduq.\n\n\u062d H, a harsh guttural aspirate, but yet distinct from the following letter. The Eastern Turkist\u00e1n\u00eds put below it the mark usually denoting the other oriental \\(h\\).\n\n\u062e Kh, the German ch (as in machen, not as in ich).\n\n\u062f D, the ordinary sound.\n\n\u0631 R, do. But the Y\u00e1rkand\u00eds often swallow it altogether when it precedes another consonant, and sometimes in that case omit it even in writing.\n\nEx.: arpa = barley, pronounced apa; irdi, irmas, pronounced and often written idi, imas.\n\n\u0632 Z, the sound as in 'zeal.'\n\n\u0633 S, the ordinary sound. The T\u00fcrk\u00eds write this letter with three dots reversed beneath the letter.\n\n\u0634 Sh, the sound of the French ch, or the German sch, or of sh in the English word shall. (See remarks under J.)\n\n\u0639 the oriental letter 'ain', a sound inexplicable in writing.\nGh, the oriental letter 'ghain', resembling in sound the Parisian 'r grassay\u00e9', or the Northumberland 'burr', sometimes interchanged with \u0121, q (see Chapter II, \"Phonetic changes of Consonants\").\n\nF, often interchanged in pronunciation, and even in writing, with P; as 'F\u0101dshah' for 'P\u0101dshah'; 'farwah' for 'parwah', and vice versa, 'fursat' for 'furusat'.\n\nQ, pronounced far back in the throat with a kind of choking effort. The Y\u0101rkand pronunciation of it is rougher than that of the Persians. Sometimes interchangeable with \u0121 gh (see \"Phonetic Changes\").\n\nK, the ordinary sound, as in the English word 'keep'.\n\nG, the ordinary sound, as in get, never as in gin. K and G are sometimes interchangeable (see \"Phonetic changes\"), and in manuscript the second stroke is generally omitted.\n\nng, is pronounced as in English, but the g is not separately or distinctly sounded even before a vowel. The pronunciation is that of \"hanger\", not of \"anger\".\n\nL, the ordinary sound.\n\nM, do.\n\nN, do.\n\nW or O or U. As a consonant, the same as the English w. As a vowel, there are four varieties of pronunciation, not distinguished by any difference in the vernacular writing, viz.:\n\nO, as in bone.\n\n\u00d6, (German sound). Ex.: k\u00f6n (day) rhymes with G. sch\u00f6n, but is pronounced a little shorter.\n\nU, (English oo). Ex.: bu, (this) pronounced boo.\n\n\u00dc, (French u) or German \u00fc or ue. Ex.: \u00fclmak (to die): the sound of \u00fc in German '\u00fcber'.\n\nH, the common aspirate.\n\nY or E or I. As a consonant, pronounced like the English y; but the Y\u0101rkand\u00eds often give it a slight sound of the French j: as y\u00fcz (side), pronounced 'j\u00fcz' (French j), and ik\u00e9 (two), pronounced ijk\u00e9. As a vowel, either long \u00e8 (the French sound in \"p\u00e8re\", the same as the English diphthong ay), or short as in then; or else i (either short as in 'bit,' or long as in 'machine').\n\nTHE VOWEL MARKS.\n\nThe Eastern Turkist\u00e1n\u00ed written language possesses, though it seldom uses, the ordinary Oriental vowel marks. The entire system of spelling is\nin theory that of the Arabic alphabet; but as this system is a foreign adaptation, and not a home-growth (for the Eastern T\u00fcrki existed both in a spoken and in a written form before the introduction of Arabic into the country), we find many traces of imperfect fitting between the language and the writing that conveys it.\n\nEven in books we meet with the same word spelt in different manners; but more especially is the divergence apparent in the want of distinction between the sounds represented by the short vowel marks \"zabar\" (\u2014), \"zer\" (\u2014), and \"pesh\" (\u2014), and by the long vowels \"alif\" (I), \"ye\" (\u0649), and \"wao\" (\u0648) respectively. These latter are often pronounced short, e.g.: \u062f\u064a\u0646 pronounced din (from) as though written \u062f\u064a\u0646, while in Persian it would be pronounced din (faith). The \"pesh\" over a consonant is often pronounced like an i: e.g., \u0646\u0634 tush, pronounced tish (tooth).\n\nThe Y\u00e1rkand\u00eds on the whole seem to use the oriental vowels much like we use our own. That is, they rather ignore the system of vowel-sounds as inherent in consonants, and consider a written vowel almost necessary to complete a syllable, whether long or short.*\n\n---\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPHONETIC VARIATION.\n\nThe Root of a Verb never changes in any formation; nor does any Substantive\u2020 or Adjective. But there are numerous syllables capable of being affixed, whose vowels and consonants vary with those of the word they are attached to, according to certain general rules which are not without exceptions.\n\nA somewhat similar fact in European languages (as regards the consonants) is the change of the Latin prefix ad into ac in the word accept, into at in the word attain, and into af in the word affix, &c.\n\n* I have found \u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 spelt \u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631, &c.\n\n\u2020 Excepting when a final q or k softens into a gh or g respectively before an affix. See p. 256.\nThe guiding principle of the T\u00farki variation seems to be this: that the mouth and throat having assumed a certain shape for the pronunciation of certain sounds, it is difficult in the compass of the same word to shift the position of the organs; or, when a hard breath is coming out, to change it suddenly into a soft breathing; and vice versa.\n\nThus, if the throat has been put into the half choking state necessary to pronounce the 'ghain' (gh) or the 'q\u00e1f' (q), and another guttural comes immediately afterwards, it is difficult to prevent this being sounded with the same choking effort (or, in other words, it is difficult to shift forward suddenly the place of utterance); and vice versa.\n\nThus it will be found comparatively easy to pronounce sarigh-qul (where two choking gutturals follow one another); but a difficulty will be found in trying to say consecutively reg qum (the Persian and the T\u00farki words respectively for 'sand'), where the contact between the root of the tongue and the back part of the palate (for the g) has to be shifted suddenly back into the throat for the q; and still more difficult to give the proper sounds to each of the so-called gutturals in the following compound: \u00e0q kupruk (\"white bridge\"), where the initial k will almost inevitably retain some of the choking q sound, unless a fresh breath be taken.\n\nAn effort is required, and this the T\u00farkis avoid.\n\nThus, (a) Gutturals (so called) of either class, which may be roughly designated as common [k and g], and true (choking) [q and gh], when contained in a root tend to bring any guttural contained in an affix into the same class.\n\nSo again, when one has pronounced the syllable yet, it is easier to complete the word with a t than with a d. Thus yet-di becomes changed into yet-ti, for the same reason that cup-board has become cubboard in English pronunciation. So pit-qan becomes pit-kan.*\n\nOn the other hand after the liquids r and l, which only require a soft utterance, it would require a fresh effort of the breath to bring out the hard sounds of k, q or t, so g, gh or d are used.\n\nEx.: b\u00e1r-ghan \"going\"; kel-di \"he came\".\n\nThus, (b) Hard consonants at the end of the root tend to harden the utterance of the guttural or dental of the affix, and vice versa.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe principle is the same in the case of the vowels. When the tone of a word, as it were, is in u (oo), say, the T\u00farkis continue that sound, or one complementary to it, in certain of the affixes.\n\n* See post, Specimen pieces (copy of Passport): \"Ydrkand-ga khidmat-ka.\" Here ga and ka are the same word, but the initial guttural is softened after the final d of Y\u00e1rkand, and hardened after the final t of khidmat.\nEx.: ur-dum not ur-dim\nt\u00f6sh-l\u00f6k not t\u00f6sh-lik.\n\nSuch are the principles on which the practice seems to rest. The following are generally the rules by which these principles work; but they must be considered rather as tendencies than as rigid laws, and they only act where no other consideration interferes.\n\nIt is not all affixes that are liable to variation. Some seem to partake of the unchangeable nature of the roots. The particular affixes which are liable to phonetic variation will be pointed out in the following pages.\n\nPHONETIC VARIATIONS OF CONSONANTS.\n\n| Final Letter of Root (Simple or Compound) | Consequent Initial of Affix. |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                          | Guttural.                   | Dental.                      |\n| Usually after t, k, g, n, in body of Root.| Usually after b, p, ch, d, s, m, l, y, q, in body of Root. |\n|                                          | ordinary.                   | choking.                     |\n| a, d, e, g, h, i, j, l, m, n, o, r, u, z, Ex. 1, (See below). | g or gh | d Soft |\n| ch, k, q, p, s, sh, t. Ex. 2, (See below). | k or q | t Hard |\n\n[N. B.\u2014If the root ends with either of the consonants with which the affix may begin, there is simply a re-duplication.\n\nEx.: tig-gan not tig-kan.]\n\nEx. 1: sakla-ghan, sakla-di, from sakla-mak = to take care of.\nkel-gan, kel-di, from kel-mak = to come.\ngel-ghan, gel-di, from gel-maq = to do.\ntut-ma-ghan, from tut-maq = to seize.\nk\u00f6n-ga, \u201cto a day\u201d, yol-gha \u201cto a road\u201d.\n\nEx. 2: ishit-kan, ishit-ti, from ishit-mak = to hear.\nket-kan, ket-te, from ket-mak = to go.\nkech-kan, kech-ti, from kech-mak = to pass over.\ng\u00e4ch-qon, g\u00e4ch-ti, from g\u00e4ch-maq = to flee.\nt\u00edch-ka, \u201cto a tooth\u201d, yash-qa, \u201cto an age\u201d.\nThus, in the above examples the final letter \\( l \\) of the root \\( kel \\) determines that the initial letter of the participial affix shall be a soft guttural (\\( g \\) or \\( gh \\)) rather than a hard one (\\( k \\) or \\( q \\)); while the \\( k \\) of the same \\( kel \\) determines which of the two soft gutturals should be chosen, viz., the ordinary one \\( g \\), and not the true (choking) one \\( gh \\).\n\nOn the other hand, in the example \\( qel-ghan \\), while the letter \\( l \\) again compels the choice of a soft guttural, the other root-consonant \\( q \\) necessitates the adoption of the true (choking) soft guttural \\( gh \\) rather than of the ordinary one.\n\nIn \\( ket-kan \\) again, we have the hard guttural induced by the final \\( t \\) of the root, while the other root-consonant \\( k \\) being ordinary, determines that the hard guttural used in the affix shall be of the same class.\n\nIt will be seen that there is a cross division of the gutturals; 1st, into soft (\\( g \\) and \\( gh \\)), and hard (\\( k \\) and \\( q \\)); 2nd, into ordinary (\\( g \\) and \\( k \\)), and true (choking) (\\( gh \\) and \\( q \\)).\n\nThus the rules given above may be re-stated in other words, viz., that the former of these cross divisions is the one affected by the final letter of the roots, while the latter division is that over which the other letters of the root bear rule.\n\nIn the dentals there is only a simple division into soft and hard (\\( d \\) and \\( t \\)), affected only by the final letter of the root.\n\nAny word ending in a \\( k \\) or \\( q \\) softens the final letter into \\( g \\) or \\( gh \\) respectively before an affix beginning with a vowel (and sometimes even before consonants). Ex. \\( kunglak \\) \u201ca coat\u201d, \\( chaukan \\) \\( kunglag-i \\) \u201ca young woman\u2019s coat\u201d; \\( sarig \\) \u201cyellow\u201d, \\( Sarigh-chopan \\) (the name of a place).\n\nIt may be added that the letter \\( q \\) seems to have a certain affinity to the broad sound of \\( a \\), and the letter \\( k \\) to its short sound (almost like an \\( e \\) as in the English word hat). Thus \\( \u0645\u0627\u0642 \\) (\\( m\u00e1q \\)) is pronounced almost like \u201cmock,\u201d while \\( \u0645\u0627\u0643 \\) (\\( mak \\)) is pronounced as in \u201cMacAndrew\u201d (almost mec).\n\nOn the other hand, the vowel \\( e \\) seems to take its broad sound with the \\( k \\), and its short sound with the \\( q \\): \\( e : g : kel-mak \\) \u201cto come\u201d (pronounced almost \u201ccail-mec\u201d); and \\( qel-m\u00e0q \\) \u201cto do\u201d (pronounced almost \u201ckill-mock\u201d).\n\n**PHONETIC VARIATION OF VOWELS.**\n\n1. Whenever the affix begins with a Vowel and the Root ends with one, the latter prevails.\n\nEx.: \\( achku'm \\) (\\( achku = \\text{key}, \\) and \\( 'm \\) possessive affix of 1st Person).\n\nN. B.\u2014With a final diphthong there is no elision; the chief vowel\n(see Rule 2) induces the corresponding vowel for the affix. Ex.: 't\u00fci-\u00fcp'.\n\n2. In all other cases the affix assumes a vowel corresponding with the chief Root vowel, as follows:\n\n| Root Vowel or Diphthong | Corresponding Vowel for Affix |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1. a ai                 | i                             |\n| 2. e                    | i                             |\n| 3. i                    | i                             |\n| 4. o                    | u                             |\n| 5. \u00f6                    | \u00f6                             |\n| 6. u                    | u                             |\n| 7. \u00fc                    | \u00fc                             |\n| 8. o\u00ef                   | u                             |\n| 9. wi                   | i                             |\n\nEx. (1). tila-dim [tila (verb-root) and d'm (affix of 1st person Past)].\n\n(5). k\u00f6r-d\u00f6m [k\u00f6r (verb-root) and d'm (affix of 1st person Past)].\n\n(1). t\u0131p-ip [t\u0131p (verb-root) and 'p (affix Perf. Participle)].\n\n(2). kel-ip [kel (verb-root) and 'p (affix Perf. Participle)].\n\n(4). soq-up [soq (verb-root) and 'p (affix Perf. Participle)].\n\n(7). t\u00fci-d\u00fcm [t\u00fci (verb-root) and d'm (affix of 1st person Past)].\n\n(2.). ket-ing [ket (verb-root) and 'ng (affix 2nd person)].\n\n(6.). qum-luq [qum = sand, l'q (substantival affix)].\n\n(1). b\u00e0sh-l\u0131k [b\u00e0sh = head, l'k (substantival affix)].\n\n(6.). y\u00fck-\u00fcng [y\u00fck = baggage, 'ng (affix 2nd person)].\n\n(4.). y\u00f2l-nang [y\u00f2l = road, n'ng (affix genitive case)].\n\n(6.). \u00e0zuq-smiz [\u00e0zuq = food, 'miz (possessive affix 1st pers. Plural)].\n\n(1.). gun\u00e0h-smiz [gun\u00e0h = sin, 'miz (possessive affix 1st pers. Plural)].\n\nIf there is more than one affix, each is affected by the preceding one as if this were the Root (both as to consonants and vowels).\n\nEx. 1: 'tut-ma-ghan'; 'tut-al-ghan', (without the affix ma or al interposed, the last affix would take the form tut-kan). So y\u00f6rt-\u00f6ng with the affix lar interposed becomes y\u00f6rt-lar-ing, not -\u00f6ng.\n\n2. 'bil-mang' ('bil-ma-'ng'); 'kel-tur-up' ('kel-tur-'p') (Cf. bil-ing, kel-ip). Often the first affix has itself been affected by the Root. Ex.: 'bil-in-ip', 'tut-ush-up.'\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE SUBSTANTIVE.\n\nThe Plural of T\u00fcrki words is formed by affixing the syllable lar (which does not vary phonetically); and whenever this syllable occurs with a Substantive, it comes immediately after the root or radical portion of the word, which root is in every case inalterable.*\n\nEx.: \u0101t-lar = horses (from \u0101t = a horse).\nata-lar = fathers (from ata = a father).\n\nThere are no Articles in T\u00fcrki Grammar.\n\nThere is no difference of Gender in T\u00fcrki.\n\nBesides the above, two other sets of attached syllables or affixes are taken by the Substantive:\n\n(a). The first set is that of the Possessive Terminations. They are affixed to Substantives, &c., governing other substantives or pronouns in the genitive case, in the manner that will be seen below.\n\n| SINGULAR. | POSSESSIVE AFFIXES. | EXAMPLES. |\n|-----------|---------------------|-----------|\n| 1st person | 'm\u2020                 | \u0101t-im = my horse; put-um = my foot; ata-'m = my father. See the Rules of Phonetic variation (vowels). |\n| 2nd       | 'ng                 | yer-ing = thy place; achku-'ng = thy key. (Vowel variable.) |\n| 3rd       | i or si             | yol-i = his (her or its) road; ata-si = his (or her) father. The vowel is not variable. The form i is used after a consonant and si after a vowel or a silent h termination. |\n\n| PLURAL.   |                   |           |\n|-----------|-------------------|-----------|\n| 1st person| 'miz              | \u00fci-'miz = our house; \u0101t-imiz = our horse. (Vowel variable.) |\n| 2nd       | 'ngiz or 'nglar   | qiz-ingiz = your daughter; y\u00f6rt-\u00f6nglar = your country. (Vowel variable.) |\n| 3rd       | i or si           | y\u00f6rt-i = their country. (Same as 3rd person Singular.) |\n\n* Except by the softening of a final guttural k or g into g or gh before an affix. See p. 256, at bottom.\n\n\u2020 The apostrophe marks the place of the variable vowel in the affixes; 'm therefore is a general form to express im, um, \u00f6m, &c.\nAs before mentioned, the Plural affix of the noun, where employed, precedes these (as well as any other) affixes.\n\nEx.: \u00e1t-lar-im = my horses.\ny\u00f6rt-lar-ing = thy countries [to be distinguished from y\u00f6rt-\u00f6nglar = your (Pl.) country.]\ny\u00f6rt-lar-inglar or y\u00f6rt-lar-ingiz = your countries.\n\nAgain: yol-i = his (her, its or their) road.\nyol-lar-i = his (her, its or their) roads.\n\nThese Possessive Affixes are merely subsidiary to the regular Possessive Pronouns (or Nouns in the genitive, in the case of the 3rd person), which, as in European languages, precede the governing Nouns. This will be further treated of in the Chapter on Pronouns.\n\n(b). The second set of Affixes that may be attached to Nouns answer the purpose accomplished by declensional inflections and by prepositions in the classical and modern languages of Europe. For the sake of clearness they will be here classed under the ordinary declensional headings or cases; though these Affixes have not yet grown into the words they are attached to, as in the inflectional languages, but remain separate Post-positions.\n\n| Cases       | Substantive | Post-positions | English |\n|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------|\n| Nominative  | \u00e1t          |                | a horse.|\n| Genitive    | \u00e1t          | ning [nung or nang]* | of a horse.|\n| Dative      | \u00e1t          | gha [qa, ka or ga]\u2020 | to a horse.|\n| Accusative  | \u00e1t          | { 'n (Possessive) \u2014's horse. |\n|             |             | ni             | a horse.|\n| Locative    | \u00e1t          | da             | in (or at) a horse.|\n| Ablative    | \u00e1t          | din [or dan]   | from a horse.|\n|             |             | birla or bilan | with a horse.|\n|             |             | &c., &c.       |         |\n\nN. B.\u2014The Possessive form of the Accusative is employed as a Possessive Affix of the 3rd person only.\n\nEx.: P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h-ning \u00e1t-in alip-kel, Bring the king's horse.\n\nAny of these Post-positions (Sec. b.) may be agglomerated on to the end of any of the Possessive Affixes (Sec. a.) going through the whole declension with each of the latter.\n\nEx.: yol-um-nung, yol-um-ga, yol-um-ni, yol-um-da, &c., \u00e1t-lar-imiz-din, &c.\nroad my of, road my to, road my (acc.), road my in horse (pl.) our from\n\nThe order in which the Affixes treated of in this Chapter take their\n\n* See \"Phonetic Variation of Vowels.\" The Yarkandis have a preference for the form nang.\n\n\u2020 See \"Phonetic Variation of Consonants.\"\nplaces (when present) after the Noun, is as follows: 1st, Noun; 2nd, Plural Affix; 3rd, Possessive Affix; 4th, Post-position.\n\nEx.: \u00fci\u2014lar\u2014\u2014i\u2014\u2014ning = of his houses.\n(Noun) (Pl. Aff.) Poss. (Post-pos.)\n\nqiz\u2014lar\u2014\u2014ingiz\u2014\u2014ga = to your daughters.\n(Noun) (Pl. Aff.) (Poss. Aff.) (Post-pos.).\n\nSometimes the Genitive post-position ning is omitted, and only the Possessive affix of the other noun retained, i.e., two nouns are placed in apposition, the latter of them in the possessed form of the 3rd person; this is done when the compound is a common one in frequent use, as in English \u201chouse-door\u201d, door-key\u201d, \u201csun-light.\u201d\n\nEx. n\u0101s kutu-si = \u201ca snuff-box\u201d (for n\u0101s-ning kutu-si).\n\nQol kap-i = \u201ca hand-cover\u201d (i.e. glove).\n\nYuz-b\u0101\u0161-i = a centurion, lit. \u201cthe head of a hundred.\u201d\n\nNote.\u2014Derivation of the Declensional Affixes of the Genitive and Accusative. The affix of the Genitive may be represented (as has been seen above) by the formula n'ng, which becomes ning, nung, &c., according to the vowels of the word that it is affixed to. Now I imagine that this may be originally the same as the substantive neng, which in the ancient form of T\u00fcrki called Uighur means \u201cthing\u201d or \u201cproperty.\u201d [See V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry\u2019s \u201cUigurische Sprachmonumente\u201d, Vocabulary, p. 208.] In order to express the idea of the genitive, e.g., to say \u201cthe Chief\u2019s horse\u201d, the T\u00fcrkis would find the mere apposition of the word B\u0113g \u201cChief\u201d, by the side of the word \u0101ti, \u201cthe horse (his horse)\u201d, insufficient to discriminate between possessor and possessed; so they would label off the owner by the affixing of the word \u201cneng\u201d, meaning \u201cproperty\u201d.\n\nThus they would say \u201cB\u0113g neng \u0101ti\u201d, which would mean \u201cChief property the horse\u201d. Here \u201cChief-property\u201d or \u201cChief\u2019s property\u201d would be the general description of the class of things to be denoted, amongst which one thing is afterwards more particularly designated by saying \u201cthe horse\u201d. Thus we first get the genus (genitive), and then the particular individual in that genus. [See Max M\u00fcller\u2019s \u201cLectures on Language,\u201d Vol. I, p. 114, Fifth Edition \u201c\u2026\u2026casus generalis, the general case, or rather the case which expresses the genus or kind. This is the real power of the genitive.\u201d]\n\nA more uncertain derivation is that of the Accusative affix ni. The same syllable also forms the T\u00fcrki word for \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhat (that which)\u201d. Thus dt-ni mindi may perhaps be really \u201chorse that-which he rode\u201d; nan-ni yedur, \u201cbread that-which he is eating\u201d, i.e., \u201che rode a horse\u201d, \u201che is eating bread\u201d. The affix ni thus would point out the object of the verb; its subject being left undistinguished, as it is indicated by the affix of the verb itself.\nPossessive Affix, 3rd Person. It has been seen above that the Possessive Affixes corresponding to the several persons are as follows:\n\n1st *yol-um* = my road.\n2nd *yol-ung* = thy road.\n3rd *yol-i* = his road.\n\nIn the Accusative, however, as we have also seen, there is another Possessive Affix of the 3rd Person.\n\n1st *yer-im-ni* = my land (acc.), or *yol-um-ni* = my road (acc.)\n2nd *yer-ing-ni* = thy land (acc.), *yol-ung-ni* = thy road (acc.)\n3rd *yer-in* = his land (acc.), *yol-un* = his road (acc.)\n\nas well as *yer-i-ni*, *yol-i-ni*.\n\nIt seems that this same Possessive Affix of the 3rd person was formerly used in all the oblique cases (not the accusative only). The following expressions have been found in an old verse:\n\nTurkist\u00e1n-ning yer-in-da kh\u00e1l\u00ed imas er\u00e1n-lar.\nHar bir gulach yer-in-da y\u00e0t\u00far mard\u00e1n er\u00e1n-lar.\n\n\"In the land of Turkist\u00e1n there is no lack of heroes.\nIn every fathom of its soil there lie heroic men.\"\n\nThus in old T\u00farki the Possessive Affixes (at least for the oblique cases) ran thus:\n\n1st \u2014\u2014\u2014 'm\n2nd \u2014\u2014\u2014 'ng\n3rd \u2014\u2014\u2014 'n\n\na usage not yet quite obsolete in Eastern Turkist\u00e1n and which seems to have been generally retained in the more Western dialects.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\nTHE ADJECTIVE.\n\nThe T\u00farki Adjective does not change at all, either for the different cases or for gender or number.\n\nFurther details regarding it will be found under the heads of \"FORMATION\" and \"SYNTAX\".\n\nThe Comparative of Adjectives (and Adverbs) is obtained by adding the affix *rak*, *r\u00e0q* or *r\u00e1k*:\n\nEx.: *obd\u00e1n* = good; *obd\u00e1n-r\u00e1k* = better.\n\nThe Superlative is generally formed by inserting the object of comparison (or at least the word *hamah* = \"all\") in the genitive and putting the adjective* into the possessed form (3rd person).\n\n* This adjective thus becomes for the nonce a substantive: \"the best\" = \"the one who is best.\"\nEx.: Muhammad-ning din-i hamah din-lar-ning ulugh-i = Muhammad's Faith (is) the great (est) of all Faiths.\n\nBu hamah-si-ning chung-i = (lit.) \"This (is) the big(gest) of all of them\"; or as we should say: \"This is the biggest\".\n\nHamah at-lar-ning yakhshi-si alip-kel = (lit.) \"Bring the best of all the horses, i.e. \"Bring the best horse.\"\n\nThe Diminutive is formed by the affix ghana (both the gh and the first a being subject to Phonetic variation).\n\nEx.: kichik-kina = tiny little.\nkhush-ghana = rather happy.\n\nTHE PRONOUN.\n\nThe Personal Pronouns are, in the Singular: man = I, san (or sen) = thou, ul = he, she or it; and in the Plural: biz (or bizlar) = we, siz (or sizlar) = you, ular (for ul-lar) = they.\n\nN. B.\u2014As, in polite conversation, the forms biz and siz are often used with reference to a single person (like our word you), the other forms bizlar, sizlar are employed, when there might be a doubt, to denote plurality.\n\nThese pronouns receive the affixes of the different cases exactly in the same way as substantives do [Substs. Sec. b.]\n\nEx.: Nom. man .......... I\n\nGen. man-ning or maning ...... of me\nDat. man-ga ...... to me\nAcc. man-ni or mani ...... me\nLoc. man-da ...... in me\nAbl. man-din ...... from me, &c., and the others in like manner.\n\nHowever, the 3rd Person Singular changes the l into an n before the Gen., Dat., and Loc. affixes, and before the Abl. affix din, viz., un-ning or uning, un-ga, un-ni or uni, un-da, un-din (instead of ul-ning, ul-ga, &c.). Before birla and some other post-positions, it takes the Gen. form viz., uning birla = \"with him (in the unity of him).\"\n\nIn the oblique cases an is often used for un; as aning instead of uning.\n\nThe Possessive Pronouns are simply the Personal Pronouns with the genitive affix, viz.\u2014\n\nManing = my; saning = thy; uning or aning = his or her; biz-ning or biz-lar-ning = our; siz-ning or siz-lar-ning = your; ular-ning = their.\n\n* In speaking of persons, the genitive of this pronoun is generally used before any of the post-positions, e.g., uning-ga = to him (instead of un-ga); uning-din for un-din [not with the Acc. post-pos., however]. Compare V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry's \"Uigurische Sprach-monumente\", p. 35, where a similar rule is mentioned as prevailing in the ancient tongue of Uigurs. The same also sometimes takes place with man and san (I and thou).\nWe have already seen (Subst., Sec. a) that there is a set of possessive terminations or affixes of each person applicable to nouns. These possessive terminations are not generally of themselves sufficient to take the place of the ordinary possessive pronoun (or noun in the genitive). These also are frequently used and come before the noun, as in the following Table:\n\n**Possessive**\n\n| Pronoun | Noun Termination |\n|---------|------------------|\n| my      | maning........... |\n| thy     | saning........... |\n| his, her or its | uning or aning (or \u2014*ning).......i or si |\n| our     | biz-ning ........ |\n| your    | siz-ning .......... |\n| their   | ular-ning (or \u2014*lar-ning).........i or si |\n\nEx.: maning dt-im; saning yer-ing; t\u00e0gh-ning yol-i; biz-ning \u00fci-miz; me of horse my thereof placethy mountain of road its us of house our siz-ning qiz-ingiz; ular-ning y\u00f6rt-i.\n\nyou of daughter your them of country their.\n\nAs before, the post-positions of the various cases may be affixed to these compounds as may be necessary.\n\nEx.: maning dt-lar-im-din = from my horses.\n\nme of horses my from\n\n**Demonstrative Pronouns**: *ul* or *u* = that there (or he); *shul*, or *shu* = that here; *bul* or *bu* = this; *shu-bu* or *ush-bu* = this very, &c. These, when used before a substantive, are indeclinable, as adjectives. But when used alone, they receive the usual affixes of case and number, like a Noun or a Personal Pronoun.\n\nIn the oblique cases of the Singular, the *l* of *ul*, *shul* and *bul* changes into an *n* (which vanishes before another *n*); while the *b* of *bul* becomes *m* in those cases.\n\n**Singular.**\n\n| Ex. | Nom. shul or shu bul or bu | Nom. shu-lar | bu-lar |\n|-----|----------------------------|--------------|--------|\n| Gen. | shu'-ning | mu'-ning | Gen. | shu-lar-ning | bu-lar-ning |\n| Dat. | shun-ga | mun-ga | Dat. | shu-lar-ga | bu-lar-ga |\n| Acc. | shu'-ni | mu'-ni | Acc. | shu-lar-ni | bu-lar-ni |\n| &c. | &c. | &c. | &c. | &c. | &c. |\n\n**Plural.**\n\n**Adjectival Pronouns.** Under this head may be classed the compounds formed by other Pronouns and the affixes *dak*, *d\u00e0q* or *d\u00e0gh* and *cha*. The former of these is the same as the affix *dik* (in common use), and implies \"likeness.\" The second, *cha*, expresses \"amount\" or \"extent.\"\n\n* This blank represents a noun.\nExs. of the former: *mun-d\u00e0gh* = this-like.\n*shun-d\u00e0gh* = that-like, such.\n\nExs. of the latter: *mun-cha* = this amount, this much.\n*shun-ga-cha* = to that amount, so much.\n\nand combined: *an-d\u00e0gh-cha* = to an amount similar to that.\n\nUsed as Adjectives, these are indeclinable; but they are also sometimes employed alone, in which case they take the usual post-positions. [They are also employed as Adverbs.]\n\nThe particle *ki* or *gi* is used almost as a Pronoun. It answers to the Hindust\u00e1ni \"walla.\" Thus *maning-ki* = mine, *B\u00e0dsh\u00e0h-ning-ki* = the King's. It therefore takes the place of some noun which is understood between the speakers. It receives the usual post-positions; for instance, if a horse is in question, one may say \"*Kim-ning-ki-ga mindi*\" = whose did he ride? \"*maning-ki-ni urdi*\" = he struck mine. The English word \"one\" most nearly expresses it: \"the one belonging to me,\" &c.*\n\nWe shall see in the Syntax that this (or its parallel forms *gi* or *ght*) takes the place of a relative pronoun in subordinate sentences.\n\n**Interrogative Pronouns** are *kim* = who?; *ni* = what? The latter with the addition of the interrogative affix *mu* or *ma*, makes *ni-ma* = what?; with *cha* it makes *ni-cha* = how much?; with the Persian *chand* it makes *ni-chand* = how many?\n\nAgain a number of these words are derived from an obsolete *g\u00e0\u00ef* = which. Thus, with the possessive affix, *g\u00e0\u00ef-si* = which or who (of them): *g\u00e0\u00ef-d\u00e0q* = what like?\n\nProbably as corruptions of these have arisen the forms *g\u00e0n-d\u00e0gh* = what like? and *g\u00e0n-cha* = how much?\n\nSeveral adverbs also are derived from *ni* and *g\u00e0\u00ef*.\n\nAll these interrogative pronouns (excepting *ni*) take the usual affixes.\n\nEx.: *g\u00e0\u00ef-si-'miz* \"which of us\"\n*nima-ni citti* \"what said he?\"\n\n**Indefinite Pronouns** are *kim-ersa\u2020* = some one; *nim'-ersa\u2020* = something, also *ni-ersa\u2020* = something; *ni-chand* = a certain number; *kishi* = somebody, also used substantively for \"a person;\" *hama* (P) and *hama-si* = all, or the whole (of it or them).\n\n\u2020 Perhaps compounded with *irsa* \"may be\" [the Potential of *irmak*]; thus *kim-ersa* would be \"who (ever it) may be,\" *ni-ersa* \"what (ever it) may be.\" See Kudatku Bilik, Introd., *hargiz kim irsa...gelmai-turur* \"whosoever he may be...he does not make\" (\"qui que ce soit...ne fait.\")\nREFLECTIVE PRONOUN: \u00f6z = self, is used instead of the Demonstrative or Possessive Pronoun when this pronoun refers to the person or thing which is the subject of the sentence [like the use of khud in Persian, and \u00e1p, apna in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed]. The Reflective Pronoun is affected by the possessive affix of each person, and by the post-positions, where necessary; and if it is governed in the genitive by a noun, that noun takes the possessive affix of the same person:\n\nEx.: \u00f6z-\u00f6m-ning dt-im = my own horse.\nself my of horse my\n\n\u00f6z-\u00f6ngiz-ning y\u00f6rt-lar-ingiz-ga = to your own countries.\nself your of country (pl.) your to\n\nSometimes the possessive termination and the genitive post-position are omitted from the \u00f6z.\n\nEx.: \u00f6z ikhtiyar-im = my own choice, for \u00f6z-\u00f6m-ning ikhtiyar-im.\n\nWhen used merely like the word \"self\" in English, it takes the possessive terminations before the post-positions (if any) just like a noun.\n\nEx.: \u00f6z-\u00f6m = myself; \u00f6z-\u00f6m-ning = of myself, \u00f6z-\u00f6m-ga = to myself, &c.\n\n\u00f6z-\u00f6ng = thyself; \u00f6z-\u00f6ng-ning = of thyself, \u00f6z-\u00f6ng-ga = to thyself, &c.\n\n\u00f6z-i = himself; \u00f6z-i-ning = of himself; \u00f6z-i-ga = to himself, &c.\n\n[Note.\u2014The \u00f6z being thus treated exactly like a substantive, suggests the possibility of its being merely a contraction of y\u00fcz = face; viz. \"my face\" for \"myself.\"]\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE VERB.\n\nAll verbs in T\u00farki, both primary and derivative ones, active or passive, &c., are conjugated on precisely the same model. One might cut out the radical part of any verbal form, and substitute that of any other verb for it, and, with the exception of trifling phonetic changes, the conjugational frame-work would fit on to the new as well as it did on the original verb-root.\n\nThe radical portion of the verb suffers no internal alteration whatever. The conjugation is entirely effected by various affixes which convey the necessary changes of application.\nThe foundation of the system is the verb-root, from which are formed, by addition, several verbal adjectives and substantives which take the place of participles, and refer to the various times or modes in which action can take place.\n\nWe will take as an example the verb signifying \"to do,\" of which the root is QEL.\n\n**Simple Root:** QEL; expresses the bare idea of doing.\n\n**Present Participle:** QELA; answers to our own Pres. Part. \"doing\" [where the root ends in a vowel this Participle adds an i: as ISHLA, ISHLAT; OQU, OQUI.]\n\n**Participle of Continuance:** QELAR or QELUR. (See p. 297, note \u2020.) This Participle seems to indicate a continuance or non-completion in the action of the verb, and is used, as will be seen, for all tenses requiring such a meaning.\n\n**Perfect Participle:** QELIP; here the vowel of the affix varies phonetically in different verbs, and the general expression for the Perf. Part. affix would be 'p, the apostrophe being replaced by the proper vowel in each case (see \"Phon. Var. of Vowels\"). This Participle implies the completion of the action.\n\n**Indefinite Participle:** QELGHAN [The gh changes in different verbs into q, k or g. See \"Phon. Var. of Consonants\"]. This Participle may properly be called Indefinite, both because it refers to no particular time for the action, and also because its application is not confined to either agent or object. In fact it may mean either the \"person doing\" (the doer), or the \"act of doing,\" or the \"thing done.\"\n\n**Potential Participle:** QELSA \"potential doing.\" [The vowel does not alter, but is always a.]\n\n**Future Participle:** QELGHU. [The gh changes as above.] This Participle only survives in composition with certain affixes which give rise to forms in modern use, of which the syllable \"ghu,\" &c., supplies the future element. Thus with \"dig,\" which implies probability, we get a\n\n[Participle of Probability: QELGHU-DIG. This means \"likely to do at a future moment\"]\n\n**Participle of Fitness:** Again, with the affix luq (lig) implying quality, we have QELGHU-LUG, which means \"possessed of a do-able quality,\" i.e., \"fit or proper to do, or to be done.\"\n\nThese forms in themselves merely indicate a \"coming to pass\" in a general manner at the several times (or tenses) respectively, without connection expressed with any person or thing, either as subject or object. Even in this naked form, however, some of them may be used in making statements, where there cannot be much doubt about the application, especially in the 3rd person.\nBut usually, to give life to these dead forms, we require the pronouns. The addition of these at once suffices to convert a Participle* into a definite statement of fact, while at the same time they connect it with determinate subjects. Thus qela merely means \"doing\". But add the pronoun signifying \"I,\" and you get the definite statement qela-mon = I (am) doing.\n\nThe Personal Pronouns are used as affixes applied to such of the so-called Participles as are Verbal Adjectives, chiefly for the tenses denoting present or future action. But the Possessive Prolominal Affixes (attached to the Verbal Substantives) give either a past sense (since a completed action is most essentially the property of the person who has done it);\u2020 or else a sense either of Duty or of Intention, e.g., \"It is thine to do,\" i.e., \"do thou,\" or \"it is my (intention) to do,\" i.e., \"I mean to do.\"\n\nTo exemplify these formations we will first take two isolated tenses of auxiliary verbs, the first of which is used in a present sense, and the other in a past. These tenses will also be useful hereafter in the conjugation of a complete verb.\n\n1st. Dur (or turur) is probably a part of the verb tur-maq, meaning \"to stand;\" the Indefinite Participle is durghan for turur-ghan. There is also a form dur-mish.\n\n[N.B.\u2014The form dur having, as it were, lost its independence, and become a mere auxiliary, meaning hardly more than \"is\" (see N.B. p. 276); the original verb tur-mak (Pres. tura-man, &c.) is sometimes brought in as a fresh auxiliary expressing \"permanence.\"]\n\n2nd. Ir'd' (or id') is the Past of a defective verb ir-mak, meaning \"to be,\" of which the Indefinite Participle is irkan or irkan, and the Potential Participle is irsa or irsa. It also possesses a form ir-mish or irmish. The rest are absent, with the exception of a Continuative Participle irbur found in old books.\n\n**PRESENT AUXILIARY.**\n\nHere the simple Personal Pronoun is affixed for each person (except the 3rd):\n\nS. 1. Dur-man\u2020 = (lit.) I stand.\n2. Dur-san = ,, thou standest.\n3. Dur = ,, (he) stands.\n\n* Or any other Adjective &c., (see p. 296).\n\u2020 Thus answering to the tenses formed with the auxiliary \"to have\" in modern European languages.\n\u2021 The presence of the pronoun as a termination of the verb does not prevent its being used before the verb also, as the subject or nominative, e.g., man dur-man = \"I stand\" or \"I am.\"\nPl. 1. **D\u00fcr-miz** = (lit.) we stand or **D\u00fck-miz** (dignified form used in Aksu, &c.)\n\n2. **D\u00fcr-siz** = ,, ye stand **D\u00fck-siz**.\n\n3. **D\u00fcr-lar** = ,, (they) stand **D\u00fck-lar**.\n\nN. B. It will be noticed that when the Pers. Pronouns are thus used as Tense-endings the Pronouns of the 3rd pers. are omitted. In the Singular the stem stands alone for the 3rd pers., and in the Plural, the mere affix of Plurality is added.\n\n**Past Auxiliary**\n\nwith the *Possessive Pronominal* affix of each person added:\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | 2 |\n| 1. **\u0130rd-im** = I was ... (or) past existence [is] mine. |\n| 2. **\u0130rd-ing** = thou wert ,, ,, thine. |\n| 3. **\u0130rd-i** = he was ,, ,, his. |\n| 1. **\u0130rd-ik\u2020** = we were ,, ,, ours. |\n| 2. **\u0130rd-ingiz** = ye were ,, ,, yours. |\n| 3. **\u0130rd-ilar** = they were ,, ,, theirs. |\n\n[This word is pronounced *idim*, &c., dropping the *r.*]\n\nThere is another auxiliary verb **bol-maq** (root **bol**) = to become or be. Its Continve. Participle is **bol\u0103r** or **bolur**, &c. Its Potential Participle is, in regular form, **bol\u015fa**. Also note a defective verb in the 3rd person singular, *viz.*, \u201cb\u00e4r\u201d = there is.\n\nWe have thus as materials out of which to form the Verb-Conjugation, on the one hand 7 Stem-elements (Root and Participles, see above), and on the other 10 co-efficient elements:\u2014\n\n* Note that *bis* takes the form *miz* when used as a verbal termination. This is a beginning of the process by which the Osmanli personal tense-terminations have become differentiated from their originals, the Personal Pronouns.\n\n\u2020 This *ik* is an abnormal form used instead of the possessive affix of the 1st person plural *miz*. Now this is the only one of the six persons whose possessive affix cannot easily be distinguished from its affixed Personal Pronoun; and this probably led to the substitution of another form for the former in the case of verbs, to avoid confusion in the first person plural, between tenses ending with the Personal Pronoun and those ending with the Possessive Pronoun.\n1. The Personal Pronouns man, &c.  \n2. The Possessive Affixes, im, &c.  \n3. The Auxiliary Tense, dur-man, &c.  \n4. The Aux. Tense bol\u00e4r-man, &c.  \n5. The Aux. Tense id-im, &c.\n\n6. The Aux.

Tense bolsa'm,\u2020 &c.\n\nOut of these simple materials, by adding each of the latter set in succession to each of the former (with certain omissions), almost the whole conjugation of every verb (with its seeming intricacies) is formed, as we shall now see.\n\n* These are formed in the model of dur-man, &c., (with Pers. Pron.).  \n\u2020 These are formed in the model of id-im, &c., (with the Possessive Affixes).\n## SCHEME OF THE TURKI\n\n| TENSES OF THE ROOT: QBL | TENSES OF THE PRESENT PARTICIPLE: QBLA | TENSES OF THE CONTINUATIVE PARTICIPLE: QBLAR |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **1.

PERSONAL PRONOUNS\u2014\n\nFirst applying the Personal Pronouns to each of the Participles in turn, we get:\n\n(a) with PRESENT PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE.\n\n1. QELA-man = I do.\n2. QELA-san = thou dost.\n3. (Caret, see Comp. Pr. Tense.)\n\n1. QELA-miz = we do.\n2. QELA-siz = ye do.\n3. (Caret, see Comp. Tense.)\n\n*This is a Simple Present Tense;\n\n(b) with CONTINUATIVE PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nQELAR-man or QELUR-man = (lit.) I (am) continuously doing.\n\nThis refers obviously both to the present moment and also to those immediately before and after it. In practice it has obtained special reference to the latter, like our English \"I am going to do,\" and this Tense may therefore be called the Future Present:\n\n1. QELAR-man or QELAR-man \"I am doing\" or \"about doing.\"\n2. QELAR-san \"thou art doing\" or \"about doing.\"\n3. QELAR \"he is doing\" or \"about doing.\"\n4. QELAR-miz \"we are doing\" or \"about doing.\"\n5. QELAR-siz \"ye are doing\" or \"about doing.\"\n6. QELAR-lar \"they are doing\" or \"about doing.\"\n\n(c) with PERFECT PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE PERFECT TENSE.\n\n1. QELIP-man \"I have done\"; (lit.) \"I (have) completely done.\"\n2. QELIP-san \"thou hast done.\"\n3. (Caret, see Compound Perfect Tense.)\u2020\n4. QELIP-miz \"we have done.\"\n5. QELIP-siz \"ye have done.\"\n6. (Caret, see Compound Perfect Tense.)\u2020\n\nHere there is no doubt about what the meaning must be. The tense is therefore a simple Perfect;\n\n(d.) with INDEFINITE PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\n* The 3rd pers. S. and Pl. being wanting here, the corresponding persons of the Compound Present Tense are made to supply their place.\n\n\u2020 The 3rd persons of the Compound Perfect Tense supply the place of the lacking ones in this Tense.\nqelghan-man, &c., (lit.) \"I (was at some time or other) a doer.\" This is simply a general statement, and would be used in answer to the question: \"Have you ever done so and so?\" It would not be used to specify any particular action. It may be called\n\nThe 1st Indefinite Past Tense.\n\n1. qelghan-man \"I have done.\"\n2. qelghan-san \"thou hast done.\"\n3. qelghan \"he has done.\"\n4. qelghan-miz \"we have done.\"\n5. qelghan-siz \"ye have done.\"\n6. qelghan-lar \"they have done,\"\n\n(e.) with the Participle of Probability\u2014\n\nThe Probable Future Tense.\n\n1. qelghu-daq-man or qelghu-diq-man,* \"I am likely to do.\"\n2. qelghu-daq-san \"thou art likely to do.\"\n3. (Caret, see Compound Probable Future Tense.)\n4. qelghu-daq-miz \"we are likely to do.\"\n5. qelghu-daq-siz \"ye are likely to do.\"\n6. (Caret, see Compound Tense.)\n\nII. Having thus applied the Personal Pronouns all round, we proceed to do the same with Possessive Affixes, whose vowels (1st and 2nd Persons) vary phonetically according to the prevailing vowel of the root, as in the case of substantives.\n\nPossessive Affixes\u2014\n\n(a.) with the Root\u2014\n\nqel-ing = doing (is) thine\u2014it is thy business to do; qel-ing-lar = doing (is) yours, it is your business to do. This is therefore simply an Imperative, viz., \"do thou\" and \"do ye.\" In this sense of course the 1st and 3rd Persons are not used. There is another Imperative form qel-ghil or qel-ghin; and, as in most languages, also a forcible Imperative, being the shortest possible form of the verb, viz., the Root: qel = do.\n\nThe Imperative.\n\n2nd S. \\[\n\\begin{cases}\nqel & \\text{do.} \\\\\nqel-ing & \\text{do thou.} \\\\\nqel-ghil & \\text{do.} \\\\\nqel-ghin & \\text{do.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n2nd Pl. \\[\n\\begin{cases}\nqel-ingiz & \\text{\"do ye.\"} \\\\\nqel-inglar & \\text{do.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n(b.) with the Indefinite Participle (and the auxiliary 'b\u00e1r'):\n\n* The 3rd pers. of the Compound Tense supply the lacking ones of this.\nTHE 2ND INDEFINITE PAST TENSE.\n\n1. Qelghan-im b\u00e4r \"I have done.\"\n2. Qelghan-ing b\u00e4r \"thou hast done.\"\n3. Qelghan-i b\u00e4r \"he had done.\"\n1. Qelghan-imiz b\u00e4r \"we have done.\"\n2. Qelghan-ingiz b\u00e4r \"ye have done.\"\n3. Qelghan-ilar b\u00e4r \"they have done.\"\n\nBearing in mind that the Indefinite Participle qelghan has among other meanings, that of \"the action of doing,\" we can see very plainly the origin and intention of this formation. For 'qelghan-im-b\u00e4r, must mean literally: \"My action of doing exists\"; and it can be said to exist as the property of the doer by having been done by him. Hence the statement is equivalent to saying: \"I have done.\"* But all the circumstances connected with the doing remain vague. The utmost that is predicated is that the action has not been omitted. Here it is to be noted that the possessive affix im changes for the several persons of the Tense while the auxiliary b\u00e4r remains throughout in the 3rd pers. The reason is obvious on inspection. The Tense is merely a sentence, of which b\u00e4r is the verb, while the subject takes successively the possessive form of the several persons. Thus the tense is literally a sentence with a varying subject. \"My doing is,\" \"thy doing is,\" \"his doing is\", &c.\n\nThis forms a 2nd Indefinite Past Tense.\n\n(c.) with the Potential Participle:\n\nThis would mean \"the power of doing (is) mine,\" i.e., \"I may,\" or \"might, do.\" It is also used in relating a story sometimes, as an Historic tense: E.g., kelsam, h\u00each kishi yoq idi=\" (when) I came there was nobody (there).\" The poss. terminations of the 3rd pers. are omitted. In the Singular the stem stands alone; and in the Plural, the mere affix of Plurality is added.\n\nTHE PRESENT POTENTIAL.\n\n1. Qelsa-'m \"I may do.\"\n2. Qelsa-'ng \"thou mayest do.\"\n3. Qelsa \"he may do.\"\n1. Qelsa'q \"we may do.\"\n2. Qelsa-'ngiz \"ye may do.\"\n3. Qelsa-lar \"they may do.\"\n\n(d.) with the Future Participle:\n\n* As the form \u2014\u2014\u2014 im-b\u00e4r means \"there is of mine\" or \"I have\", the above tense is absolutely identical with the English \"I have done,\" which expression is also to be accounted for in the same manner (as above).\nqelghu-'m-dur (or b\u00e2r) &c. This is of course, literally, \u201cmy future doing exists (stands)\u201d (for qelghu, it will be remembered, is the Future Participle); and as one may be said to make a future action one\u2019s own by intending it, this comes to mean: \u201cI intend to do.\u201d [See latter remarks on (b).] This may be called\n\nThe Intentional Future Tense.\n\n1. qelghu-'m-dur or b\u00e2r \u201cI intend to do.\u201d\n2. qelghu-'ng-dur \u201cthou intendest to do.\u201d\n3. qelghu-si-dur \u201che intend to do.\u201d\n4. qelghu-'miz-dur \u201cwe intend to do.\u201d\n5. qelghu-'ngiz-dur \u201cye intend to do.\u201d\n6. qelghu-si-lar-dur \u201cthey intend to do.\u201d\n\nHaving exhausted the usual combinations of the simple pronominal affixes with the several participial elements of the Verb, and formed thereby nine Tenses, viz., a Simple Present, a Future Present, a Probable Future, a Perfect, an Imperative, two Indefinite Pasts, a Present Potential and an Intentional Future; we now have recourse to the auxiliaries.\n\nIII. Auxiliary: dur\u2014\n\nFirst, the Present Auxiliary dur.\n\n[N. B.\u2014This is perhaps a contraction from the verb turmaq \u201cto stand,\u201d which would make its Continuative Participle turur and its Future-Present turur-man, which may have become shortened into trur-man, and then made into dur-man. What gives colour to this supposition is that turur-man has been found employed as an auxiliary in the place usually filled by dur-man. And this auxiliary must be a Future Present, for the form of a Simple Present would be dura-man, and not dur-man.]\n\nBe this as it may, the auxiliary dur is used in a sense implying \u201cto stand\u201d or \u201cbe in a condition...\u201d like the Italian \u201csta bene,\u201d \u201csta male\u201d (\u201che stands well,\u201d &c., for \u201che is well.\u201d) In some connections (as with the Indef. Participle, &c.) it implies merely probability or presumption (and thus Futurity), in which sense it may be compared with our \u201cI stand to win\u201d (see gelghan-dur-man, b\u00e2r-durman, &c.). Thus we have:\n\n(a.) with Present Participle\u2014\n\nqela-dur-man,* &c. = I stand doing or to do, I am in the condition of doing; or, as we should express it, \u201cI am doing,\u201d or \u201cabout doing.\u201d\n\nThe Compound Future Present Tense.\n\n1. qela-dur-man \u201cI am about doing.\u201d\n2. qela-dur-san \u201cthou art about doing.\u201d\n3. qela-dur \u201che is about doing.\u201d\n\n* Pronounced in Yarkand and Kashgar \u201cqela-doman,\u201d \u201c\u2014dosan,\u201d \u201c\u2014do,\u201d &c., and in Khotan \u201c\u2014toman,\u201d &c.\n1. QELA-dur-miz \"we are about doing.\"\n2. QELA-dur-siz \"ye are about doing.\"\n3. QELA-dur-lar \"they are about doing.\"\n\nThis therefore is a Compound Future Present; (see remarks on qel\u00e0r-man).\n\nwith the Perfect Participle\u2014\n\n(b.) QELIP-dur-man,* &c., = \"I am in the condition of completely having done\"; or, \"I have done.\"\n\nThis is\n\nThe Compound Perfect Tense.\n\n1. QELIP-dur-man \"I have done.\"\n2. QELIP-dur-san \"thou hast done.\"\n3. QELIP-dur \"he has done.\"\n1. QELIP-dur-miz \"we have done.\"\n2. QELIP-dur-siz \"ye have done.\"\n3. QELIP-dur-lar \"they have done.\"\n\n(c) with the Indefinite Participle\u2014\n\nQELGHAN-dur-man, &c.* = \"I am in the condition of being indefinitely the doer.\" (For the Indefinite Participle has the meaning of \"the doer\" amongst others, and this is the only one here applicable.) This combination might be rendered \"I stand as or for, the doer,\" and is used in the sense of \"I must have done,\" or \"I have probably done.\" See remarks under DUR. It may be called\n\nThe Presumptive Past Tense.\n\n1. QELGHAN-dur-man \"I must have done.\"\n2. QELGHAN-dur-san \"thou must have done.\"\n3. QELGHAN-dur \"he must have done.\"\n1. QELGHAN-dur-miz \"we must have done.\"\n2. QELGHAN-dur-siz \"ye must have done.\"\n3. QELGHAN-dur-lar \"they must have done.\"\n\n(d.) with the Participle of Probability\u2014\n\nThe Compound Probable Future Tense.\n\n1. QELGHU-DIQ-dur-man \"I am (or stand) likely to do.\"\n2. QELGHU-DIQ-dur-san \"thou art likely to do.\"\n3. QELGHU-DIQ-dur \"he is likely to do.\n1. QELGHU-DIQ-dur-miz \"we are likely to do.\"\n2. QELGHU-DIQ-dur-siz \"ye are likely to do.\"\n3. QELGHU-DIQ-dur-lar \"they are likely to do.\"\n\n* Pronounced in Yarkand and Kashghar \"qelip-\" and \"qelghan-doman,\" \"\u2014doan,\" \"\u2014do,\" &c., and in Khotan \"\u2014toman,\" &c.\nIV. The auxiliary verb bol-m\u0101q in the Future-Present Tense when applied to the Past Participle of a Verb also gives a Tense:\n\n(a) qel-ip bol\u0101r-man, or bolur-man &c. = \u201cI shall have done,\u201d lit. \u201cI shall be or become (in the condition of) having done.\u201d\n\nThis is the Future Perfect Tense.\n\nV. Next we take the Past Auxiliary irdi or idi, and apply it to the several radical elements.\n\nAuxiliary: idi\n\n(a) with the Root\u2014\n\nqel-idim contracted to qel-'dim. (The d and the i change according to the Rules of Phonetic Variation.)\n\n[N.B.\u2014But it is possible that we ought rather to consider this tense as formed directly in each verb by the addition of a d; as ir-d-im itself was formed from the root of irmak and the Possessive Affix, &c. But if so, we can still trace this form no further back, beyond knowing that the d must confer a kind of substantival meaning* to allow of the application of a Possessive affix, by which combination a Past sense is acquired (see explanation of gelghan-im.) In this case gel-d-im would be literally \u201cmy action of doing (exists),\u201d and thus, \u201cI have done.\u201d]\n\nAt any rate the form gel-d-im, &c., is used in the sense of \u201cI did,\u201d &c., in relating particular occurrences. It may be called\n\nThe Definite Past Tense.\n\n1. qel-d-im \u201cI did\u201d\n2. qel-d-ing \u201cthou didst\u201d\n3. qel-d-i \u201che did\u201d\n1. qel-d-iq \u201cwe did\u201d\n2. qel-d-ingiz \u201cye did\u201d\n3. qel-d-ilar \u201cthey did\u201d\n\n(b.) with the Participle of Continuance\u2014\n\nqel\u0101r-idim or 'dim, or qelur-idim = I was continuously doing. This may be used of an Habitual action, \u201cI used to do,\u201d but more usually it applies only to a particular Past time, and predicates the incompletion of the action at that time. In other words it is our Imperfect \u201cI was doing.\u201d\n\nBy dropping the final r and the initial i, and hardening the d (to avoid confusion with other tenses), the Y\u0101rkandis get gel\u0101ttim, which is the word in vulgar use instead of gel\u0101r-idim.\n\n* See Max M\u00fcller\u2019s \u201cScience of Language,\u201d Lecture VIII, p. 346 (Fifth Ed.).\nTHE IMPERFECT OR HABITUAL TENSE.\n\n1.

QEL\u00c4P-id-ingiz \"ye had done.\"\n      -tingiz\n   3. QEL\u00c4P-id-ilar \"they had done.\"\n      -tilar\n\nThis therefore is a Pluperfect. It would refer to a special act, while the next Tense would be employed in a more general sense.\n\nE.g. \"I had read his letter just before he arrived\" would be rendered by .... oqu'p-idim; but \"I had read T\u00fcrki before ever I went to Turkistan\" would be rendered by .... oqu-gh\u00e4n-idim.\n\n(d.) with the Indefinite Participle\u2014\n\nQELGHAN-id-im, &c., = I was (in the position of) being a past doer, (viz. a person who had done). This throws back the doing before the time referred to, but that doing is itself indefinite. Such a shade of meaning has no exactly corresponding expression in English, but roughly it may also be translated: \"I had done,\" or \"I had been doing\" and the Tense may be called\n\nTHE INDEFINITE PLUPERFECT.\n\n1. QELGHAN-id-im \"I had done.\"\n2. QELGHAN-id-ing \"thou hadst done.\"\n3. QELGHAN-id-i \"he had done.\"\n   1. QELGHAN-id-ik \"we had done.\"\n   2. QELGHAN-id-ingiz \"ye had done.\"\n   3. QELGHAN-id-ilar \"they had done.\"\n\n(e). with the Potential Participle\u2014\nQELsa-id-im, &c. This would be \"the power of doing was mine,\" i.e., \"I might have done\" or (with agar, \"if\") \"had I done.\" This is\n\nTHE 1ST PAST POTENTIAL.\n\n1. QELsa-id-im \"I might have done.\"\n2. QELsa-id-ing \"thou mightest have done.\"\n3. QELsa-id-i \"he might have done.\"\n1. QELsa-id-ik \"we might have done.\"\n2. QELsa-id-ingiz \"ye might have done.\"\n3. QELsa-id-ilar \"they might have done.\"\n\n(f.) with the FUTURE PARTICIPLE OF FITNESS\u2014\n\nQELghu-luq id-im, &c. Qelghu-luq meaning \"fit to do,\" this tense may be translated: \"I was fit to do,\" or \"I was to do.\" It is\n\nTHE PRETERITE FUTURE TENSE.\n\n1. QELghu-luq-id-im \"I was to do\" or \"be done.\"\n2. QELghu-luq-id-ing \"thou wert to do\" or \"be done.\"\n3. QELghu-luq-id-i \"he was to do\" or \"be done.\"\n1. QELghu-luq-id-ik \"we were to do\" or \"be done.\"\n2. QELghu-luq-id-ingiz \"ye were to do\" or \"be done.\"\n3. QELghu-luq-id-ilar \"they were to do\" or \"be done.\"\n\nSometimes the auxiliaries dur and idi are accumulated one on the top of the other: e.g. qela-dur-idim (= I was about doing), and qelip-dur-idim (= I was in a continuous condition of having done, or, I had been doing).\n\nBefore leaving the Auxiliary idim we must take notice of the Tenses formed with its derivatory form \"irmish\" or \"imish,\" and its Indefinite Participle ikan, which, when affixed to certain parts of the Verb and conjugated by affixed Pronouns, reduces their statements to mere probabilities, or makes them conditional.\n\nVI. To express probability, or facts not positively known to the speaker (English \"It is understood or believed that,\" &c.), there is a whole series of tenses in 'mish.\n\nThe AUXILIARY (IMISH) makes\n\n(a). with the PRESENT PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE HEARSAY PRESENT TENSE.\n\n1. QELa-imish-man \"I am understood to do.\"\n2. QELa-imish-san \"thou art understood to do.\"\n3. QELa-imish \"he is understood to do.\"\n1. QELa-imish-miz \"we are understood to do.\"\n2. QELa-imish-siz \"ye are understood to do.\"\n3. QELa-imish-lar \"they are understood to do.\"\n\n(b.) with the CONTINUATIVE PARTICIPLE\u2014\nTHE HEARSAY FUTURE-PRESENT TENSE.\n\n1. QELAR-imish-man \"I am understood to be about doing.\"\n2. QELAR-imish-san \"thou art understood to be about doing.\"\n3. QELAR-imish \"he is understood to be about doing,\" &c.\n\n(c.) with the PERFECT PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE HEARSAY PERFECT TENSE.\n\n1. QELIP-imish (or' mish) -man \"I am understood to have done.\"\n2. QELIP-imish-san \"thou art understood to have done.\"\n3. QELIP-imish \"he is understood to have done,\" &c.\n\n(d.) with the INDEFINITE PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE HEARSAY PAST TENSE.\n\n1. QELGHAN-imish-man \"I am understood to have done (at some time or other).\"\n2. QELGHAN-imish-san \"thou art understood to have done.\"\n3. QELGHAN-imish \"he is understood to have done,\" &c.\n\nVII. The auxiliary dur has a similar form;\nThe Auxiliary (durMISH) makes\n\n(a.) with the PRESENT PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE HEARSAY COMPOUND PRESENT TENSE.\n\n1. QELA-durmish-man* \"I am understood to be doing (continuously understood to do.)\"\n2. QELA-durmish-san \"thou art understood to be doing.\"\n3. QELA-durmish \"he is understood to be doing\" &c.\n\n(b.) with the PERFECT PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nTHE HEARSAY COMPOUND PERFECT TENSE.\n\n1. QELIP-durmish-man \"I am (continuously) understood to have done.\"\n2. QELIP-durmish-san \"thou art understood to have done.\"\n3. QELIP-durmish \"he is understood to have done\" &c.\n\nIt must be understood that although the first person of these tenses is given for the form's sake, yet it is of rare occurrence, the 2nd and 3rd persons being more often used; for a man is generally not in much uncertainty about facts connected with himself, and does not depend on hearsay for information regarding them.\n\nVIII. We next have the Auxiliary Indefinite Participle ikan or ikin.\n\n* Example from the \"Tazkiratu-l-Bughra\": But-kh\u00e0na-ni ita-durmish\u2014\"He is building an idol-temple [I believe],\" or \"He is understood to be building....\".\nAuxiliary Indefinite Participle \"ikan\" makes\n\n(a.) with the Future-Present\u2014\n\nqel\u00e4r-ikan-man. This is used in asking a question, or in making a statement qualified by \"if\" or \"when\".\n\n[N.B.\u2014This Tense and the 3 following are as it were, supererogatory, for the \"ikan\" might be omitted without making much difference in the sense. There is just the difference between the English: \"What may you be doing?\" and \"What are you doing?\"]\n\nThe above may therefore be translated: \"I may be doing or about doing,\" and the tense may be called\n\nThe Future Present Indefinite Tense.\n\n1. qel\u00e4r-ikan-man \"I may be about doing.\"\n2. qel\u00e4r-ikan-san \"thou mayest be about doing.\"\n3. qel\u00e4r-ikan \"he may be about doing\" &c.\n\n(b.) with the Perfect\u2014\n\nqelip-ikan-man, &c. Here the introduction of the Participle ikan, reduces the positive affirmation of the Perfect into a mere presumption or rumour. The above compound word may be translated: \"I may or must have done\" or \"completed doing.\" We may call it\n\nThe Presumptive Perfect Tense.\n\n1. qelip-ikan-man \"I may or must have done.\"\n2. qelip-ikan-san \"thou mayest or must have done.\"\n3. qelip-ikan \"he may or must have done\" &c.\n\n(c.) with the Indefinite Participle\u2014\n\nqelghan-ikan-man, &c. This is similar to the last with the difference of the indefiniteness inherent in the Participle qelghan. The meaning is \"I may or must (at some time or other) have done,\" and we may call it\n\nThe Presumptive Indefinite Past Tense.\n\n1. qelghan-ikan-man \"I may or must have done.\"\n2. qelghan-ikan-san \"thou mayest or must have done.\"\n3. qelghan-ikan \"he may or must have done,\" &c.*\n\n(d.) with the Future Participle of Fitness\u2014\n\nqelghu-lug-ikan-man, &c. The Participle qelghu-lug means, as will be remembered, \"fit or proper to do.\" The verbal expression derived from it takes in the Present the indefinite auxiliary form in ikan. It thus means \"I am to do,\" &c.\n\n* Example from the \"Taskiratu-'l-Bughra\": P\u00e0dsh\u00e0h ni-chand bala-lar-ni kaba-da alip-kejghan ikan-lar. \"The king [it is said] had brought several children in bags.\" (Le roi aurait apport\u00e9. Fr.\u2014Er soll gebracht haben. Germ.).\nTHE FUTURE OF NECESSITY.\n\n1. Qelghu-lug-ikan-man \"I am to do\" or \"ought to do\" or \"be done.\"\n2. Qelghu-lug-ikan-san \"thou art to do,\" &c.\n3. Qelghu-lug-ikan \"he is to do\" &c.\n\nThe Auxiliaries in the Potential form give us fresh Tenses. Thus ir-mak in the Potential is ir-sa, and we may take\n\nIX. THE POTENTIAL AUXILIARY 'IR-SA'\n\n(a.) with the CONTINUATIVE PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nQelar-ir-sa-'m, &c. [(lit.) the possibility of continuous doing may be mine.] This would evidently mean \"I may be (continuously) doing\" or \"about doing.\" But the form gel-sa'm is more commonly used.\n\nThis Tense may be called\n\nTHE FUTURE-PRESENT POTENTIAL.\n\n1. Qelar-irsa'm \"I might be about doing.\"\n2. Qelar-irsa-ng \"thou mightest be about doing.\"\n3. Qelar-irsa \"he might be about doing\" &c.\n\nX. THE POTENTIAL AUXILIARY 'BOL-SA' makes\n\n(a.) with the INDEFINITE PARTICIPLE\u2014\n\nQelghan-bol-sa'm, &c. Literally, \"the action of doing may become mine,\" i.e., \"I may have done\" [see explanation of gel-ghan-im b\u00e1r].\n\nThis may be called\n\nTHE INDEFINITE PAST POTENTIAL.\n\n1. Qelghan-bolsa-'m \"I may have done.\"\n2. Qelghan-bolsa-ng \"thou mayest have done.\"\n3. Qelghan-bolsa \"he may have done\" &c.\n\n(b.) with the FUTURE PARTICIPLE OF PROBABILITY\u2014\n\nQelghu-diq bol-sa'm, &c. Literally \"the probability of future doing may become mine,\" i.e., \"I may be likely to do.\" This is\n\nTHE FUTURE POTENTIAL.\n\n1. Qelghu-diq-bolsa-'m \"I may be likely to do.\"\n2. Qelghu-diq-bolsa-ng \"thou mayest be likely to do.\"\n3. Qelghu-diq-bolsa \"he may be likely to do\" &c.\n\nThis completes that part of the Turki Verb Conjugation which is effected simply by the apposition of the 10 co-efficient elements respectively to the several stem-elements. But there is also a set of Tenses formed from the Root by means of some special co-efficients which are not applicable to any of the other stem-elements (the Participles). Some of these Tenses are defective. They are:\n(a.) An Optative for the 3rd Person, which seems to be connected in a certain measure with the Potential form. This is qel-sun*\u2014let him do; and in the Plural qel-sun-lar [pronounced in Eastern Turkist\u00e1n: qel-silla]=let them do. This latter is used as a polite form of address to an equal or superior [conf. the German 'thuen Sie.'].\n\n(b.) There is another Optative defective Tense with only the 1st Persons Sing. and Plur in -ai, and -ali or -aliq (alik). Together we get:\n\n(b.) 1. Qel-ai \"I will do\" or \"let me do.\"\n(a.) 3. Qel-sun \"let him do.\"\n(b.) 1. Qel-ali or Qel-aliq \"we will do\" or \"let us do.\"\n(a.) 3. Qel-sun-lar (qelsilla) \"let them do\" or \"be they (you) pleased to do.\"\n\n(c.) The tense formed by affixing the syllable \"ghai\" (whose guttural varies Phonetically) to the root of the verb, has a similar meaning but is complete in all its persons:\n\nThe Root\nwith the Affix ghai: Qel-ghai-man,\u2020=I will do, or let me do. This may be called\n\nTHE OPTATIVE FUTURE.\n\n1. Qel-ghai-man \"I will do\" or \"let me do.\"\n2. Qel-ghai-san \"thou wilt do\" &c.\n3. Qel-ghai \"he will do\" &c.\n1. Qel-ghai-miz \"we will do\" &c.\n2. Qel-ghai-siz \"ye will do\" &c.\n3. Qel-ghai-lar \"they will do,\" &c.\n\nWe next have to notice some tenses which could not be brought into the simple Scheme of the Verb, because they are, as it were, quantities raised to the 3rd power, being formed by the application of a co-efficient element to a compound consisting in itself of stem and co-efficient,\n\nThey are:\n\n(a.) Qelsa'm-idi, &c. This, being formed by the application of\n\n* Perhaps this is a corrupted survival of the old Turkish Possessive Affix of the 3rd person (see at end of \"Substantives\"). Thus qelsun would stand for qel-sa'n, which might be compared with qelsam = qel-sa-'m, and qelsang = qel-sa-'ng. The meaning of qel-sa'n would have been \"the power-of-doing (is) his,\" thus \"let him do.\"\n\n\u2020 This form, from the meaning attached to it, would seem to be connected with the Futuro Participle in ghu.\nthe aux. 3rd pers. Past tense, to the several persons of the Pres. Potential of the Verb, means literally: \"my power of doing existed.\" \"Thy power ... existed,\" &c. It is therefore equivalent to the 1st Past Potential, QELsa-id-im \"I might have done.\" Its possessive affix 'm changes for the several persons of the tense, while the aux. idi remains in the 3rd pers. throughout, like the b\u00e4r and the dur of the 2nd Indef. Past and of the Intentional Future. It is\n\n**The 2nd Past Potential Tense.**\n\n1. QELsa-'m-idi \"I might have done.\"\n2. QELsa-'ng-idi \"thou mightest have done.\"\n3. QELsa-idi \"he might have done.\"\n4. QELsa-'q-idi \"we might have done.\"\n5. QELsa-'ngiz-idi \"ye might have done.\"\n6. QELsa-'lar-idi \"they might have done.\"\n\n(b). QEL-dim-irsa, &c. This is the 3rd p. of the aux. potential \"irsa\" added to the several persons of the simple Past. (See Remark, on 2nd Indef. Past.) The literal meaning is \"my past doing may exist,\" i.e., \"I may have done.\" But this form seems to be generally used in the simple sense of qeldim\u2014\"I did,\" with the ir-sa added to give a very slightly potential sense, as after the word \"when.\" This is\n\n**The 3rd Past Potential.**\n\n1. QEL-dim-irsa \"I may have done.\"\n2. QEL-ding-irsa \"thou mayest have done.\"\n3. QEL-di-irsa \"he may have done.\"\n\n(c.) QEL-dim-ikan. Here, in the same way, the 3rd pers. of the aux. indef. \"ikan\" is tacked on to the several persons of the Simple Past of the Verb. The literal meaning is \"my past doing indefinitely exists.\" This has simply the meaning \"I did,\" but is used in asking a question or in making a statement qualified by \"if\" or \"when.\"\n\nEx.: t\u00fcn\u00fc-g\u00f6n nima ish qel-ding ikan = \"yesterday what mayest thou have done.\"\n\nThis is therefore\n\n**The 3rd Indefinite Past Tense.**\n\n1. QEL-dim-ikan \"I may have done.\"\n2. QEL-ding-ikan \"thou mayest have done.\"\n3. QEL-di-ikan \"he may have done\" &c.\n\n(d.) QELa-dur-ikan-man, &c. Here the Indefinite ikan is interposed before the pronouns of the Compound Pres. Tense. This Tense has simply the meaning of \"I am about doing,\" but is used in the same way as the last.\n\nEx.: nima-ish qela-dur-ikan-san\u2014\"What mayest thou be doing;\"\nThis tense is the *Compound Future-Present Indefinite*, but the simple Fut. Pres. Indef. is more used:\n\n**The Compound Future Present Indefinite Tense.**\n\n1. *qela-dur-ikan-man* \"I may be doing.\"\n2. *qela-dur-ikan-san* \"thou mayest be doing.\"\n3. *qela-dur-ikan* \"he may be doing\" &c.\n\n(*e.*) *Qela-dur id-im.* Here the aux. Past Tense *idi* is added to the Compound Future Present *qela-dur*. As this latter means: \"(I am) standing (or in a continuous condition of) doing,\" the above compound is \"I was in the continuous condition of doing\" hence \"I was about doing.\" This may be called\n\n**The Future Present Preterite.**\n\n1. *qela-dur id-im* \"I was about doing.\"\n2. *qela-dur id-ing* \"thou wast about doing.\"\n3. *qela-dur id-i* \"he was about doing.\"\n   &c. &c.\n\n(*f.*) *qelip-dur id-im.* As *qelip-dur* means \"(I am) standing (or in the continuous condition of) having done,\" the above compound means \"I was in the continuous condition of having done\" or \"I had done continuously\", hence \"I had been doing.\"\n\nIn another way, if we remember that *qelip idim* is the Pluperfect \"I had done\", it will at once be seen that the interposition of *dur* \"standing\", as *qelip-dur-idim*, must give it a continuative sense: \"I had been doing.\" This is\n\n**The Continuative Pluperfect.**\n\n1. *qelip-dur-id-im* \"I had been doing.\"\n2. *qelip-dur-id-ing* \"thou hadst been doing.\"\n3. *qelip-dur-id-i* \"he had been doing.\"\n   &c. &c.\n\nThere remain a few forms which, although capable of being conjugated through all the persons and possessing specific meanings, yet being formed from Verbal forms other than the regular stem-elements, or by means of attached words other than the regular co-efficient elements, had better be kept distinct from the regular Tenses, as **Verbal Expressions**.\n\n(*a.*) *qelish-im b\u00e1r*, &c. Changing the Possessive affix for each person. The form *qelish* meaning \"the doing\" (see below in \"Verbal Substantives\") *b\u00e1r* being the impersonal verb \"is,\" the above expression is literally: \"The doing (of so and so) is mine,\" i.e., \"It is mine to do\" or I have to do.\"\n1. QELish-im b\u00e2r, \"I have to do.\"\n2. QELish-ing-b\u00e2r \"thou hast to do.\"\n3. QELish-i-b\u00e2r \"he has to do.\"\n   1. QELish-imiz-b\u00e2r \"we have to do.\"\n   2. QELish-ingiz-b\u00e2r \"ye have to do.\"\n   3. QELish-ilar-b\u00e2r \"they have to do.\"\n\n[N.B.\u2014As the form\u2014\u2019m-b\u00e2r means \"I have,\" the parallel is complete with \"aimerai\" (aimer ai) &c. See Max M\u00fcller's Science of Language, Vol. 1, p. 258, Fifth Edition.]\n\n(b.) QEL-m\u00e2q-chi bol-dum, &c. This is the noun of the Agent (see \"Formation of Nouns\") derived from the Infinitive by the addition of the affix chi, with the Past of the verb bol-m\u00e2q (to become). The literal meaning therefore is: \"I have become the doer\" or \"the one who has to do.\" As it may be presumed that a person only becomes so of his own free will, this expression may be translated: I have agreed to do;\" and in this sense it is commonly used.\n\n1. QELm\u00e2q-chi-boldum \"I have agreed to do.\"\n2. QELm\u00e2q-chi-boldung \"thou hast agreed to do.\"\n3. QELm\u00e2q-chi-boldi \"he has agreed to do.\"\n   1. QELm\u00e2q-chi-bolduq \"we\" &c.\n   2. QELm\u00e2q-chi-boldungiz \"ye\" &c.\n   3. QELm\u00e2q-chi-boldilar \"they\" &c.\n\nOther expressions formed similarly from other tenses of the verb bol-m\u00e2q may also be used, but they are less common, and will, moreover, suggest themselves.\n\n(c.) QELa-durghan* bol-dum, &c. This compound gela-durghan (see below: \"Verbal Adjectives\") means: \"about to do.\" Hence the present expression is equivalent to: \"I have become about to do.\" There is more action of the will expressed here than in the last [for QEL-m\u00e2q-chi is only \"one who has do,\" whereas gela-durghan means \"about to do (actually)\"]. Therefore while the previous form is only used in the sense of \"I have agreed to do,\" the present expression implies active choice, viz., \"I have determined\" or \"formed the resolution to do.\"\n\n1. QELa-durghan (gelatgan) boldum \"I have determined to do.\"\n2. QELa-durghan-boldung \"thou\" &c.\n3. QELa-durghan-boldi \"he\" &c.\n   1. QELa-durghan bolduq \"we\" &c.\n   2. QELa-durghan boldungiz \"ye\" &c.\n   3. QELa-durghan boldilar \"they\" &c.\n\n* Pronounced in Y\u00e2rkand \"gelado-ghan,\" or \"gel\u00e2tq\u00e2n.\"\nOther tenses of bol-m\u00e0q are used with this; also durman and idim: e.g.\n\n(d.) 1. qela-durghan (gel\u00e0tq\u00e0n) id-im \u201cI was to do.\u201d\n2. qela-durghan-id-ing \u201cthou wert to do.\u201d\n3. qela-durghan-id-i \u201che was to do.\u201d\n&c.\n\n(e.) 1. qela-durghan (gel\u00e0tq\u00e0n) dur-man \u201cI am about doing.\u201d\n2. qela-durghan dur-san \u201cthou art about doing.\u201d\n3. qela-durghan dur \u201che is about doing.\u201d\n&c.\n\n(f.) qelsa-'m bolur ikan, &c. (The Possessive affix of the qelsa changing for the different persons). This expression is very difficult to put into a representative English form; but it shows how distinctly the Eastern Turki language keeps up the recollection of the origin of its verbal forms, and how little these have sunk into consolidated inflections. For here (after the manner of several previous tenses)* the form qelsa'm, so far from being looked upon merely as the 1st Person Singular of the Present Potential, is distinctly a Substantive in the possessed form (of the 1st Person Singular), and it is used as the subject or nominative of another verb (bolur) in the 3rd Person. By changing the Possessive affix of the \"qelsa\" we should get fresh compound substantives, each of which would again form the subject of the verb bolur. Such a series of expressions as these may perhaps be looked upon as a Tense in Turki; but they are simply sentences in a certain form with a nominative governing the possessive pronouns of the several persons successively [as in English one might say: my dog runs, thy dog runs, his dog runs, &c.]*\n\nThe literal meaning of the expression, however, (as regards the 1st Person Singular), may be said to be as follows:\n\n| qelsa | 'm | bolur | ikan\u2020 |\n|-------|----|-------|------|\n| the power of doing | mine | about to become | may be |\n\nor, as it is used in the interrogative usually with g\u00e0idagh (how), we may render it: \"[How] may my choice of action be about to come into play?\" or in other words: \"[How] shall my doing be?\" i.e., \"[How] shall I act\" or \"should I act?\" And so with the other persons, Singular and Plural; the verb \"bolur-ikan\" remaining all through in the 3rd Person Singular. When used not interrogatively, this expression denotes obligation, as \"I should\" or \"ought to....\"\n\n1. qelsa-'m bolur ikan \u201cI ought to\u201d or \u201cshould do.\u201d\n2. qelsa-ng bolur ikan \u201cthou\u201d &c.\n3. qelsa bolur ikan \u201che\u201d &c.\n\n* See also the 2nd Past Potential and the 3rd ditto, and the 2nd and 3rd Past Indefinite Tenses.\n\n\u2020 Bolur-ikan is the 3rd Person Singular of the Indefinite Future Present of the verb bolmdg.\n1. Qelsa-'q bolur ikan \"we\" &c.\n2. Qelsa-'ngiz bolur ikan \"ye\" &c.\n3. Qelsa-'lar bolur ikan \"they\" &c.\n\n(g.) Qelsa-'m bolur idi, &c. This is the same expression as the last with a Past sense. It means: \"should I have done\" or \"I ought to have done.\"\n\n1. Qelsa-'m bolur idi \"I ought to have done.\"\n2. Qelsa-'ng bolur idi \"thou\" &c.\n3. Qelsa bolur idi \"he\" &c.\n\n(h.) Qelsa-'m kirak, &c. The impersonal kirak means \"it is necessary.\" The meaning of this expression is therefore (literally) \"my potential doing is necessary,\" i.e., \"it is necessary that I should do,\" or \"I must do.\"\n\n1. Qelsa-'m kirak \"I must do.\"\n2. Qelsa-'ng kirak \"thou\" &c.\n3. Qelsa kirak \"he\" &c.\n\n(i.) Qeligh-liq-man, &c. Qeligh is a Verbal Substantive (see 'Formation of Substs.') meaning \"the condition of doing;\" the termination liq makes it into an adjective \"possessing the condition of doing\" or \"possessed of the qualification of having or being done.\" The pronoun affixed makes it into a statement, viz., \"I am possessed of the qualification of having or being done.\" It therefore expresses the attainment of a certain state or condition, and not a mere evanescent action.\n\n1. Qeligh-liq-man \"I am in a done or doing state.\"\n2. Qeligh-liq-san \"thou art\" &c.\n   &c.*\n\nN. B.\u2014It will have been noticed in the case of the Possessive affixes used as tense terminations: 1st, that where these are followed by the verb substantive b\u00e4r or dur, the 1st person plural keeps the ordinary possessive affix, 'miz, instead of the verbal one of the same person, 'q or 'k (see first note, p. 268). The 2nd Indef. Past and the Intentional Future are examples of this. 2nd, that when the stem terminates in a vowel, as Qel-ghu, the possessive affix of the 3rd person is si instead of i, according to the Rule (See \"Substantives, p. 258.\") The Potential is an exception. There the affix of the 3rd pers. is simply omitted.\n\n* To these verbal expressions others might have been added. E.g. The following have been found: \"Kashki kimersa gelghai irdi\" = \"Oh that some-one had been about to do it\", also gelghai ikan = (oh that he) were about to do\" or \"were going to do\". But in truth the combinations are endless.\nVERBAL SUBSTANTIVES.\n\nUnder this head will be classed those forms which, although represented by Gerunds, Infinitives, &c., in European languages, yet in Turki are real substantives formed from the verb-root, and are treated as such:\n\n(a.) Qel\u00e4r or Qelur; the Continuative. This is governed by post-positions just like any other substantive:\n\nEx.: Qelur-da=\"in doing\" or \"when about to do\" (lit. \"in the continuance of doing.\")\n\nOqu-r-gha mail qelur-san=thou wilt choose to read, (lit. thou wilt make inclination to the reading).\n\n(b.) Qelghan; the Indefinite. This is governed by post-positions, and also by Possessive affixes. When used for the object, (i.e. passively), it would be rendered in English by a relative clause:\n\nEx.: Bilghan-ing=\"that which thou knowest,\" lit. \"(thing) known of thee.\"\n\nWhen referring to the action, it would be rendered in a variety of ways in English, according to the sense:\n\nEx. 1 Qelghan uchun=\"because of doing\" or \"of having done.\"\nBolghan-din-kin=\"after having become\"; lit. \"after the becoming.\"\nBolghan-sari=\"in the measure of becoming\" or \"as fast as it becomes.\"\nU'gh\u00e1n-imiz beh-r\u00e1q dur=\"it is better for us to die;\" lit. \"our having died, or being dead, is better.\"\n\nIn this sense, although a substantive, yet it governs the same case as the simple verb, as do all substantives formed from verbs.\n\nEx.: yer-ga kirgan-im=\"for me to enter the earth,\" lit. \"my entry to the earth.\"\n\n(c). Qelish*; the Definite [its vowel is subject to Phonetic change.] This only expresses the action, and never the object. It takes post-positions and Possessive affixes, and governs the same cases as the parent verb:\n\nEx.: Oqu'sh-um-din=(lit.) \"from my reading\".\nSiz-lar-ni chirla-'sh-da=\"in calling you,\" lit. \"in the calling (of) you.\"\n\nWaj\u00fadi-gha Qelish-ing = \"thy coming into existence.\"\nSiz-ni ish qeldurush-gha t\u00e0gat-im yog = \"I have (there is of me) no power to make you work,\" lit. \"to the making.\"\n\n(d). Qelm\u00e1q; the so-called Infinitive also is a substantive taking\n\n* This form is perhaps connected with ish \"work\" or \"deed\" or \"act.\" Thus gel-ish (? for gel-m\u00e1g-ning ish-i) \"the act of doing.\"\npost-positions and Possessive affixes; but always with a Present or Paulo-\npost-Future sense. Its negative qelmas also takes affixes.\n\nEx.: Qelm\u00e1q-uchun=\u201cin order to do;\u201d lit. \u201cbecause of the (P. p. F.)\ndoing.\u201d\n\nSaning din-gha kirmak-ing-ni kh\u2019ahlai-dur-man=\u201cI wish thee to\nenter the Faith;\u201d lit. \u201cthy entry (acc.) into the Faith I desire.\u201d\n\n(e.) Qelghu-lug. The Participle of Fitness may be used as a sub-\nstantive with post-positions and Possessive affixes.\n\nEx.: siz-lar har-nima de-sa\u2019nglar de\u2019nglar, man qelghu-lug-um-ni\ngel\u00e1r-man=\u201csay what you may say, I shall do what I have to do (acc.).\u201d\n\nHere qel-ghu-lug-um is \u201cwhat I have to do,\u201d i.e. \u201cwhat is proper\nfor me to do.\u201d\n\n(f) Qeligh. This is more a Derivative than a verbal substantive\n[see \u201cFormation of Substantives\u201d]; but it requires to find a place here on\naccount of the adjective obtained from it.* It has always a concrete sense.\n\nEx.: \u00fclchak=\u201cscales\u201d from \u00fclcha-mak=\u201cto weigh,\n\u00fcl\u00fck=\u201ca corpse\u201d from \u00fcl-mak=\u201cto die.\u201d\n\nVERBAL ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS.\n\nUnder this head also are included forms which are not represented in\nthe same way in European languages, but exhibit their real structure very\nplainly in Turki. They are of course undeclined, as is the Turki rule for\nadjectives.\n\n(a). Qelghali; from qel, the root, and an affix ghal\u0131 which may pro-\nbably be broken up into ghu the Future-Participle affix, (or ? gha the Dative\nPost-position), and li\u2020 for lig, adjectival affix. Thus qelgha-li would be,\nliterally, \u2018qualified to or for (future) doing,\u2019 or \u201cin the manner for\ndoing.\u201d In common use it means \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cin order,\u2021 to do.\u201d\n\nEx.: K\u00f6rgali kel-di=\u201che came in order to see;\u201d lit. \u201che came\nqualified to see.\u201d\n\nBolghali uma-ma-di = \u201che consented not to become\u201d or \u201cin such a\nmanner as to become.\u201d\n\n* In some verbs this form gives a verbal adjective, from which a verbal substan-\ntive is formed by adding lik, reversing the usual course.\n\n\u2020 See Vamb\u00e9ry\u2019s \u201cUigurische Sprach-monumente,\u201d p. 39.\n\n\u2021 With this English expression in fact it corresponds pretty fairly; \u201cin order\u201d is\nreally only a compound adjective, \u201carranged\u201d \u201corderly\u201d: e.g. \u201chis affairs are in\norder\u201d; or a compound adverb: e.g. \u201carrange yourselves in order.\u201d Here the ad-\nverb may be still further compounded by adding the purpose: \u201carrange yourselves\nin order for marching (in marching order)\u201d or \u201cin order to march.\u201d Or again \u201cgo\nsingly in order for passing through the gate\u201d or \u201cin order to pass through the gate.\u201d\nThus the English expression \u201cin order to\u2014\u201d (with an infinitive) is merely a compound\nadverb, like the Turki form in ghal\u0131.\nB\u0101ghali buyur-dum = \"I commanded (him) to go\"; viz. \"I commanded (him) in order that he should go\" or \"so that he should go.\"\n\n(b). Qelip. The Perfect Participle. This when used in subordinate sentences may be considered as a verbal-adjective qualifying the subject of the chief sentence.\n\nEx.: bu k\u00e1fir-ni \u00fc\u011fu-si-din uighat-ip (man) im\u00e2n-gha targhi\u00eeb gel-a\u00ee = \"(I) having awakened this infidel from his sleep, should persuade him towards the Faith.\"\n\nHere \"having awakened,\" &c., is obviously the qualification of \"I,\" which is the subject of the main verb \"should persuade.\"\n\nThis is the chief form in which a verb enters into composition with another verb. See \"Compound Verbs.\"\n\nThis Participle is also used in a Passive sense: e.g. sinip ketti, lit. \"it has gone broken\" (t\u00fct gay\u00e2, H.) But sinip birdi \"he broke (it)\" (tor diy\u00e2, H.). Again,\n\nDozakh dep yer\u2014\"the place called Hell.\"\n\nThis passive use is less common.\n\n(c). Qel-ghach, the Preterite. A similar account may be given of this (see above, first para. of (b.) Qelip). The meaning is: \"after having done.\"\n\n(d). Qela-Qela. The Reduplicated Present Participle. This denotes \"continued doing\" or \"repeated doing.\"\n\nEx.: Sult\u00e2n shik\u00fbr qela-qela Art\u00fbsh-ga yetti\u2014\"The Sult\u00e2n, hunting as he went, arrived at Art\u00fbsh.\"\n\nQelmai, the Negative Present\u2014\"not doing\" i.e., \"without doing.\"\n\n(e). Qelgh\u00e2n. This indefinite (Past or Present) form does duty also as an adjective; and here again it may apply either to the agent or the object (direct or indirect). Of course as an adjective it is indeclinable:\n\nEx.: ishitkan s\u00f6z\u2014the speech heard (pass.).\n\nalgh\u00e2n keshi\u2014the person taking, or, who has taken (act.).\n\nIt may be itself joined to a noun or pronoun, which may be either its subject or object.\n\nEx.: man-qelghan ish\u2014the work that I do (lit. the me-done work).\n\nshah\u00eed-bolgh\u00e2n yer-da\u2014in the place where (so and so) became a martyr (lit. in the martyr-becoming place).\n\n(f). Qela-durghan. The adjective of Paulo-post Futurity; (see remarks, p. 276).\n\nEx.: erti keta-durghan Hajji\u2014the pilgrim who is going to start tomorrow (lit. the to-morrow-about-to-start pilgrim).\n\nbut-kh\u00e2na ita-durghan yer-da\u2014in the place where the idol-temple was (or is) to be built (lit. in the temple-about-to-build (be-built) place).\n\nIt will be seen that this, like all the forms of the Indefinite in ghan,\nis applicable to either subject or object (direct or indirect).\u2014i.e., is used either actively or passively.\n\nNegative: Qelma\u00ef-durghan.\n\n(g) Qelghu-luq,\u2014with a Future Passive meaning:\nEx.: Qelghu-luq ish\u2014a work that has to be done.\n\n(h) Qelghu-diq is active and applies to the agent or subject:\nEx.: su\u00e0bi-ni tarqu-diq ish\u2014a work likely to obtain merit.\n\n(i) Qeligh-liq, conveying the sense of a condition or state [see 'Verbal Expressions'];\nEx.: p\u00fcsh\u00fck-luq \u00e3sh*\u2014food ready cooked.\nqauhar-birla ar\u00e3\u00efsh Qeligh-liq=ornamented with jewels.\n\nTHE NEGATIVE.\n\nThe Negative of Verbs is formed by the syllables 'ma' 'ma\u00ef' or 'mas.'\n'Ma' is used in the Tenses of the Root, and in the Perfect, Indefinite, Potential and Future Participles, and the Optative; it precedes all the conjugational affixes.\u2020\n\nEx.: Qel-ma or Qel-ma-'ng\u2021\u2014\"do not;\" Qel-ma-dim \"I did not.\"\n(Perf. Parf.) Qel-ma'p\u2020 idi, \"he had not done.\"\n(Indef. Part.) Qel-ma-ghan-miz, \"we have not done.\"\n(Pot. Part.) Qel-ma-sa'm, \"I may not do.\"\n(Fut. Part.) Qel-ma-ghu-diq, \"not likely to do,\" &c.\n(Optative) Qel-ma'i\u0161 \"let me not do.\"\n\n'Ma\u00ef' is used for the Present Participle and its Tenses; or rather, the negative root gelma\u2014(see last rule) being formed, it comes under the rule (p. 28) by which \"where the root ends in a vowel the Present Participle adds an i.\"\n\nEx.: Qel-ma\u00ef-man \"I do not\"; Qel-ma\u00ef-durman, \"I am not about doing.\"\n\n'Mas' is used for the Continuative Participle in ur or ar.\n\nEx.: Qel\u00e4r-man, \"I am about doing.\"\nQelmas-man, \"I am not about doing.\"\n\nAlso for the Infinitive: Qelmas=\"not to do.\"\n\nThe Defective Auxiliary \"irmak\" has a negative \"irmas\" or \"imas\" which does duty instead of \"dur\" when a negative sense is required. [There is thus a negative Future-Present Tense of irmak, but no affirmative in common use.\u00a7]\n\n* It will be observed that p\u00fcsh-\u00fbk is the same form as qcl-\u00eegh, the \u00eegh being changed into \u00fbk by double phonetic change, viz. of vowel and of consonant.\n\n\u2020 That is, it comes immediately after the Root, or after the compound formed of Root plus the modifying Affixes in the Secondary Forms of a Verb (which see, post).\n\n\u2021 The Affixes beginning with vowels lose their own vowels after that of the negative syllable, which prevails. (See \"Rules of Phonetic Change of Vowels\").\n\n\u00a7 Irur is antiquated.\nEx.: kichik dur-man, \"I am small.\"\nkichik im\u00e4s-man, \"I am not small.\"\n\nThis form im\u00e4s is also sometimes used in compound Tenses, instead of the inserted syllable, to make a negative.\n\nThe defective verb irmak seems to have no negative form for the past tense; but the negative Future-Present imas is used, prefixed to the (affirmative) Past Tense of the same verb.\n\nEx.: Qelghan imas idilar for qel-ma-ghan idilar. \"They had not been doing.\"\n\nT\u00e0akhir qelghu-luk imas, (for qel-ma-ghu-luq dur) \"delay is not to be made.\"\n\nThe impersonal verb b\u00e4r or b\u00e4r-dur, \"there is\", \"it is,\" has its negative yoq or yoq-dur.\n\nTHE INTERROGATIVE\n\nis expressed by adding mu (vulg. ma) after the verb. This syllable generally follows the last of the affixes of the verb; but in the Tenses of the Present and Future-Present Participle, the interrogative is often used in the middle of the word, in the shape of a mere letter m added to the Present Participle.\n\nEx.: Qelding mu \"didst thou do?\" [regular form].\nQela-m'-san, \"dost thou do?\" [Present-Part. form].\nQelma\u00efi-m'-san \"dost thou not do?\" [do].\n\nThe particle mu repeated, stands for English \"whether ...... or ......\"\n\nE.g. ma'l\u00fcm bol-mai-dur k\u00e4fir-mu Musulm\u00e4n-mu = \"It is not known whether unbelievers or Muslims.\"\n\nWith the common form ikan or ikin (Indef. Part., or 3rd pers. of Indef. Past Tense, of irmak \"to be\") the interrogative syllable is prefixed instead of being suffixed, thus m'ikin = \"is (it) ?\" \"may (it) be?\" This compound is used, instead of the final interrogative mu, wherever ikan would be used in the positive. It expresses more of hesitancy between two opinions than the simple mu, owing to the peculiar indefiniteness of ikan:\n\nEx. bu maning-ki m'ikin = \"may this be mine?\" (bu maning-ki b\u00e4r mu\u2014would be simply \"is this mine?\"). Ul kishi kela-dur m'ikin.* = \"will that person come (or will he not, I wonder) ?\" Ul kishi kela-m'dur would be simply \"will that person come?\"\n\nSee also \"Syntax\" \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 16 for other examples.\n\n* This however may be said to be merely the Interrogative form of the Comp. Fut. Pres. Indef. Tense. Thus Kela-dur-ikan = \"he may be about coming\"; Kela-dur-m'i-kan (like Qela-m'-san in form) = \"may he be about to come\"? The effect is the same however.\nTHE COMPOUND PASSIVE.\n\nThe addition of the Auxiliary verb bolmaq, \"to become,\" to the Past Participle of the Transitive verb, forms a Passive, which may be conjugated through all the tenses of the verb \"bolmaq.\"\n\nEx.: ogu'p-bolmaq, \"to be read.\"\nogu'p-bolghan, \"read.\" (Indef. Past Participle.)\nogu'p-bolar, \"it is about being read.\"\n&c. &c.\n\nFor the Simple Passive see the Chapter on \"Secondary Forms of the Verb.\"\n\nWe may now say a few words about the Impersonal Auxiliary above-mentioned\u2014\"bar\". This must be carefully distinguished from the verb barmaq, \"to go,\" which enjoys a complete conjugation.\n\nBar, (pronounced in Yarkand, bd) the Impersonal Auxiliary, means \"there is.\"* It is also used to connect the predicate with its subject affirmatively, or rather to affirm the existence of the subject as connected with that particular predicate, in the same way that yop denies its existence in that connection.\n\nIn that sense it sometimes has the pronouns of the 1st and 2nd Persons affixed to it. It is also sometimes prefixed to the Auxiliaries durman, idim, and ikan, and conjugated by their means as follows:\n\n**PRESENT.**\n\n1. Bar-man \u2020 or Bar-durman, \u2020 \"I exist\" or \"I am.\"\n2. Bar-san or Bar-dursan, \"thou existest,\" &c.\n3. Bar or Bar-dur \"he exists,\" &c.\n4. Bar-miz or Bar-durmiz, \"we exist,\" &c.\n5. Bar-siz or Bar-dursiz, \"ye exist,\" &c.\n6. Bar or Bar-durlar, \"they exist,\" &c.\n\n**INDEFINITE-PAST.**\n\n1. Bar-ikan-man, \"I am\" or \"I was.\"\n2. Bar-ikan-san, \"thou art,\" &c. Bar-id-ing, \"thou wert.\"\n3. Bar-ikan \"he is,\" &c. Bar-id-i, \"he was.\"\n4. Bar-ikan-miz \"we are,\" &c. Bar-id-ik, \"we were.\"\n5. Bar-ikan-siz, \"ye are,\" &c. Bar-id-ingiz, \"ye were.\"\n6. Bar-ikan-lar, \"they are,\" &c. Bar-id-ilar, \"they were.\"\n\n* Primarily it means \"existence,\" but used verbally in the Turki manner it means \"there is.\"\n\n\u2020 The present of bar-mdq, \"to go,\" would be bara-man, &c.\n\n\u2020 The tense in dur is used, when the fact is merely presumed, to mean \"there must be,\" \"there probably is\" (H. hovega). See remarks, p. 276.\nIn the Negative, the word *yoq* would simply take the place of the word *b\u00e1r* throughout.\n\nThe Auxiliary *b\u00e1r* is made to supply the place of the verb \u201cto have\u201d which does not exist in Turki, (see Syntax, \u00a7 13). It may be used also as a verbal adjective or noun: *e.g.*, *ahl-im b\u00e1r \u00fci-da* = in the house where my wife is (lit. \u201cmy wife-being house in\u201d); *b\u00e1r-i-ni tuttilar* = \u201cthey took what there was of his\u201d [lit. \u201cthe existent (things) of him\u201d].\n\nThe Indefinite verb-tense *ikan* is the most usual copula in ordinary sentences.\n\n**Ex.** *Bu \u00e0t chung ikan* = \u201cthis horse is big.\u201d\n\nFinally any adjective or substantive or pronoun can be prefixed to the Personal Pronouns without any copula*: *e.g.*, *uss\u00e1k man*, \u201cI (am) thirsty;\u201d *kichik san*, \u201cthou (art) small;\u201d *\u00fci-da miz\u2020*, we (are) at home;\u201d *T\u00e2jik-lar-din siz mu*, \u201c(are) you of the T\u00e2jik tribe?\u201d *yoq*, *biz Turk-lar-din miz*, \u201cno, we (are) of the Turks\u201d (*i.e.*, of Turkish race). The verb substantive is simply *sous-entendu*, or perhaps its necessity is not felt in a primitive language, as neither is it in the language of children, *e.g.*, \u201cme good\u201d, \u201cyou horse\u201d, \u201cme coachman\u201d.\n\n---\n\n**CHAPTER VI.**\n\n**SECONDARY FORMS OF THE VERB.**\n\nThe Secondary Forms are produced by certain Affixes added to the Root, conveying some modification of the Primary verb.\n\nThese Affixes may be super-imposed one on the other as required.\n\nThe new Verb thus formed is conjugated just as the Primary Verb, taking the compound of Root plus modifying Affix or Affixes, as a new Root.\n\n**I.\u2014CAUSATIVES.**\n\nThe Turki Causative form gives to a Transitive Verb a Causative sense, while an Intransitive one becomes Transitive. This will be obvious from an example or two:\n\n(a). The first form of the Causative is that which applies to Verbs\n\n* A similar practice in Osmanli Turkish (where the abbreviated forms of the pronouns adopted as tense-terminations, are thus used) has misled Grammarians into the belief that the said abbreviated terminational pronouns form a tense of the Verb Substantive. See p. 246 (text and first note).\n\n\u2020 Note that it is the *verbal* or terminational form of the Personal Pronouns that is thus used (*miz* not *bis*), as in Osmanli.\nending with a vowel, or diphthong (or sometimes to those with the liquids \\( r \\) and \\( l \\)) by affixing a \\( t \\).*\n\nEx.: Ishla-mak = to work.\n\nIshla-t-mak = to cause to work.\n\nTuga-mak = to come to an end, i.e. to finish (intrans.).\n\nTuga-t-mak = to cause to come to an end, i.e. to finish (trans.).\n\nIbdr-mak = to send; ibdr-t-mak = to cause to send.\n\n(b). The second form of Causative is that which affixes \\( ur \\),\u2020 \\( tur \\) or \\( dur \\),\u2021 or \\( shur \\) (in which the Vowel is constant).\n\nEx.: push-mak = to be in a cooked state [neuter, not passive].\n\npush-ur-mak = to cause to be in a cooked state, i.e., to cook. (Trans.)\n\nkel-mak = to come. (Intrans.)\n\nkel-tur-mak = to cause to come, i.e., to bring. (Trans.)\n\nbil-mak = to know; bil-dur-mak = to cause to know, i.e., to inform.\n\ntap-maq = to receive; tap-shur-maq = to cause to receive, i.e., to entrust to.\n\n[N.B.\u2014In the cases of tuga-mak, push-mak, &c., the English language treats the Turki Causative (push-ur-mak, \u201cto cook,\u201d &c.), as the Primary Verb, and the Turki Primary (push-mak, \u201cto be cooked,\u201d) &c. as the passive of the same. For we should consider the idea (\u201cto cook,\u201d) to come before the idea \u201cto be in a cooked state.\u201d But the Turki language takes the latter as its primary idea, putting it in the form of a primary (Turki) verb; while it obtains the sense of our simple Active verb by adopting the form of the Causative from what is, in our mouths, a Passive (to cause to be cooked = to cook). This train of thought may sometimes help to account for what may seem to be a non-conformity between the Turki verbal-form and its English expression.]\n\n(c). The third form affixes \\( kur \\) or \\( kuz \\), the \\( k \\) and its vowel changing sometimes according to the Phonetic Rules.\n\nEx.: yet-maq = to reach.\n\nyet-qur-maq or yet-quz-maq = to cause to reach.\n\ngel-maq = to do; gel-ghuz-maq = to cause to do.\n\nkir-mak = to enter; kir-giz-mak = to cause to enter.\n\n* Probably a vestige of the verb \\( it-mak \\) \u201cto make.\u201d Thus \\( ishla-t-mak \\) quasi \\( ishla-it-mak \\) \u201cto make to work.\u201d\n\n\u2020 Such Verbs as have their Causative in \\( ur \\) always have their Continuative Participle in \\( dr \\) not \\( ur \\) to avoid confusion. Ex. ichmdq \u201cto drink;\u201d Continuative Participle ichdr; Causative form ich-ur-maq.\n\n\u2021 According to the Rules of Phonetic Variation for Consonants (the vowel does not change).\nII.\u2014The Passive.\n\n(a). The first form of the Passive is obtained by affixing 'l, il or ul (according to the Phonetic Rules, which see) to the Root. If the Root ends in a vowel, that of the Passive Affix disappears.\n\nEx.: \u00e0ch-m\u00e0q \u201cto open;\u201d \u00e0ch-il-m\u00e0q \u201cto be opened.\u201d\ntari-mak \u201cto sow;\u201d tari-'l-mak \u201cto be sown.\u201d\noqu-m\u00e0q \u201cto read;\u201d oqu-'l-m\u00e0q \u201cto be read.\u201d\ntut-mak \u201cto seize;\u201d tut-ul-mak \u201cto be seized.\u201d\n\nN. B.\u2014It seems probable that the origin of this formation was the addition of the Auxiliary bol-m\u00e0q, \u201cto become,\u201d to the Perfect Participle of another verb. The combination still survives with a passive significance, as tutup-bol-m\u00e0q, \u201cto be seized\u201d [See \u201cVerbs, Compound Passive.\u201d] This might easily be corrupted to tutubul-m\u00e0q* by the elision of p before b and Phonetic change in the Vowel; and thence the step would not be far to tutul-m\u00e0q,* slurring over the b between two vowels.\n\n(b). In cases where the Root of the Verb ends in l, the Affix of the Passive is changed into \u2019n, in or un to avoid the clashing of two ls.\n\nEx.: bil-mak = to know; bil-in-mak = to be known (not bil-il-mak).\n\n[N. B.\u2014Sometimes a Passive is formed from an Intransitive Primary Verb in the regular form, but its meaning is taken from the Causative.\n\nE. g., ajra-mak (intransitive) \u201cto be in a divided state.\u201d Passive ajra-'l-mak, \u201cto be divided.\u201d This is, in point of meaning, the Passive of ajra-'t-mak, \u201cto divide\u201d or \u201cto cause to be in a divided state\u201d (Caus.) ; but in form it is the Passive of the intransitive Primary Verb ajra-mak which of course by rights could have no Passive].\n\nIII.\u2014The Reflective.\n\nThis is formed precisely as the last [Passive (b)], but can be applied not only to Verbs whose root ends in l, but to all whose sense will bear it. Its meaning is directly or indirectly Reflective; but this sometimes gives rise to special meanings, whose exact connection cannot at first sight be traced.\n\nEx.: ur-mdq = to strike; ur-un-m\u00e0q = to strike one\u2019s self against;\n(sp.) to brush against.\ntolgh\u00e0-m\u00e0q = to twist; tolgha-'n-m\u00e0q = to twist one\u2019s self,\n(sp.) to writhe.\noqu-m\u00e0q = to read; oqu-'n-m\u00e0q = to read to one\u2019s self.\n\n* As least one such instance is actually known where alip b\u00e1r-m\u00e0q is contracted into apdr-m\u00e0q. It must first have been shortened to alipdr-m\u00e0q and thence (slurring over the l between two vowels) to apdr-m\u00e0q which is now in use.\nch\u00e0q-m\u00e0q = to strike a light; ch\u00e0q-in-m\u00e0q = to strike a light of itself; (sp.) to lighten (used of the Lightning).\naya-mak = to withdraw (trans.); aya-'n-mak = to shrink (withdraw one's self).\n\n[N. B.\u2014There are some Primary Verbs in the Reflective form, or at least of which no Primary form exists; this having probably become superfluous in point of meaning, as for example, with tuga-mak, \"to come to an end,\" and tuga-'n-mak, \"to finish itself;\" one of these is obviously superfluous, and might be dropped. Even when the real Primary form has become obsolete, the Secondary Verbs are formed as if from it, and not from the Reflective form.\n\nEx.: \u00f6rga-'n-mak = to learn, (to put into one's own mind).\nmakes \u00f6rga-'t-mak = to cause to learn, or to teach (others), (to put into another's mind).]\n\nIV.\u2014The Verb of Reciprocity or Companionship.\n\nThis form affixes 'sh, ish or ush* (according to the Phonetic Rule) to the Verb (root or compound). The sense conveyed is that the action is reciprocal between several persons, if the Primary Verb will bear this sense; otherwise it means that the action is performed by several together. Like some of the other secondary forms, this sometimes assumes a special restricted sense, which in English is expressed by a separate word.\n\nEx.: \u00fcs-mak \"to butt;\" \u00fcs-ush-mak \"to butt at one-another;\ntut-m\u00e0q \"to seize;\" tut-ush-mdq \"to seize one-another\", (speci-\nally) \"to wrestle;\"\noqu-m\u00e0q \"to read;\" oqu-'sh-m\u00e0q \"to read in company.\"\nur-un-m\u00e0q \"to brush against.\" ur-un-ush-m\u00e0q \"to brush against one another.\"\n\nV.\u2014The Verb of Possibility.\u2020\n\nTo express the power to do or suffer, the Turki language employs no separate Verb (as \"I can............\") but adds an affix \u00e0l to the Verb. This affix remains intact, never changing phonetically as others do.\n\nEx.: b\u00e0r-m\u00e0q, \"to go;\" b\u00e0r-\u00e0l-m\u00e0q, \"to be able to go.\"\n\u00e0ch-m\u00e0q, \"to open;\" \u00e0ch-\u00e0l-m\u00e0q, \"to be able to open.\"\ntut-m\u00e0q, \"to seize;\" tut-\u00e0l-m\u00e0q, \"to be able to seize.\"\ns\u00e0t-m\u00e0q, \"to sell;\" s\u00e0t-\u00e0l-m\u00e0q, \"to be able to sell.\"\n\n* Perhaps connected with ish \"a companion.\"\n\u2020 The Osmanli Turkish seems to have no form of Possibility, only that of Impos-\nsibility in ama or eme. This is obviously a relic of the Eastern or primitive affix of Possibility combined with that of Negation: e.g., (Osm.) ydz-ama-di for (East. T.) ydz-\ndl-me-di \"he was not able to write.\"\n[N. B.\u2014It may be said that this form is simply the apposition of the Verb \u00e0l-m\u00e0q, \u201cto take,\u201d to the Primary Verb. This is probably the origin of the formation; in fact it is sometimes found written separately with the Pres. Participle of the principal Verb followed by the tense of the Auxiliary \u00e0l-m\u00e0q; e.g. gela-\u00e0lmas = \u201ccannot make\u201d; but, in speaking it has got worn down into a mere formal affix instead of an independent Verb.\n\nThus the form b\u00e0r'-\u00e0lm\u00e0q, tut'-\u00e0lm\u00e0q, &c. may be considered a mere corruption or running together of the full compound: b\u00e0ra-\u00e0lm\u00e0q, tuta-\u00e0lm\u00e0q, &c.]\n\nWhere the Present Participle does not end in a but in i (in consequence of the Root ending in a vowel, see \u201cVerbs, Pres. Participle\u201d, page 28) no elision takes place between the final i of the verb, and the initial a of the auxy. This helps to distinguish this form from the Passive in these cases:\n\nEx.: [Primary Form] ajra-mak = to be in a state of division.\n[Passive Form] ajra-'l-mak = to be divided.\n[Form of Possib.] ajra'i-\u00e0l-m\u00e0k = to be able to be in a state of division.\n(Prim.) oqu-m\u00e0q = to read.\n(Pass.) oqu-'l-m\u00e0q = to be read.\n(Poss.) oqui-\u00e0l-m\u00e0q = to be able to read.\n\nNot only one but two or more of these modifying affixes may be used in the same Compound Verb, as will be seen below.\n\nThe order in which they should be applied to the Root, when several come together, depends chiefly on the meaning intended to be given. But there seem to be two general rules, viz., that the negative affix when used shall come last (before the conjugational ones), while usually the affix of Possibility comes next before the negative (if any), or otherwise last of all the modifying syllables.\n\nEx.: Bir-il-ish-tur-al-mai-dur-man\nRoot Pass. Recip. Caus. Possy. Neg. Auxy. Pron.\n\nModifying Affixes (Secondary Conjugational Forms) Affixes.\n\n= I am not able to cause (them), to be given to one-another.\n\nWith the exception of these two modifying affixes (viz., those of Possibility and of Negation), the order of the others is dictated by the meaning intended. For instance:\n\nBir-il-dur-mak is the Causative Form (in dur) of a Passive Verb\n\n* In other cases the distinction (between the Passive and Possibility forms) is made by the Phonetic change of vowel in the former as against the retention of the a in the latter: e.g. (Pass.) t\u00e0p-il-mdq, (Poss.) t\u00e0p-\u00e0l-mdq.\n(in *il*) obtained from the Root *bir*. It therefore must mean \"to cause to be given.\"\n\nAgain, *bir-dur-ul-mak* is the Passive (in *ul*) of the Causative Form (in *dur*) of the Verb *bir-mak*. Thus its sense is: \"To be caused to give.\"\n\n[N. B.\u2014With an Intransitive Verb only one of these two forms would be possible. For with *kel-mak*, \"to come,\" *kel-tur-un-mak* would be the Passive of the Causative Form, and would mean \"to be caused to come,\" i.e., \"to be brought.\" But the alternative form *kel-in-tur-mak* would be the Causative of a Passive Verb *kel-in-mak*, and such a Verb is logically impossible, since *kel-mak* \"to come,\" can have no Passive (though it is true a Passive form of certain Intransitive Verbs is used impersonally in a special sense; see \"Syntax.\")]\n\nThus each of these affixes modifies the combination preceding it, while the resulting meaning is again modified by the next succeeding affix. Each, moreover, may recur (in its varying forms) in the same combination.\n\nEx.: *kir-giz-il-dur-ul-mak* = \"to be caused to be made to enter\", i.e. \"to be caused to be brought in,\" where the Causative Affix appears under the forms of *giz* and *dur*, and the Passive under those of *il* and *ul*.\n\nIt will be understood that such complex forms are rare. Still, while generally making use of simple ones, the Turkis reserve to themselves the right of employing the longest compounds, and occasionally exercise the right.\n\n[N. B.\u2014It will be seen from this that the Turki Verb is capable of a vast number of different forms. There are, as we have seen, five Secondary Root forms besides the Compound Passive. The number of Permutations these are capable of is of course enormous. Many of these would be impossible logically (though not formally), while many would be mere repetitions in point of meaning.\n\nBut leaving out the Affix of Possibility (which generally comes last), it may be safely stated that with each of the five remaining forms taken successively as the first affix, at least five combinations can be made, conveying each a distinguishable meaning, which would be recognised by any educated native of Turkistan.\n\nThis would give us $5 \\times 5$, viz., 25 compound forms, to each of which could be added the Affix of Possibility, making up 50. But each of these 50 could be used in the negative; so that there are not less than 100 Compound Roots or Bases.\n\nOr the number may be estimated in this way. Prof. Max M\u00fcller, by the application in Western Turkish merely of the Causative, Reflective and Reciprocative Affixes, obtains 12 Secondary forms. For the Eastern Turki, if we attach to each of these the Affix of Possibility, we raise the number of forms to 24, each of which can be put in the Negative, making 48.\nNow all but the simplest of these are susceptible of a different order in the affixes (giving a difference of meaning, see above). Moreover, affixes may recur in the same combination (see preceding page). If we allow that these methods double the number of basal forms, we shall be well within the mark, and so we may fairly admit the figure 100 given above.\n\nNow there are some 44 complete Tenses (or conjugated expressions), and 4 Tenses with only 4 personal forms apiece. Thus we get 280 Tense-persons applicable to each of the 100 Compound Roots or Bases, besides verbal substantives and adjectives. Multiplying the two sums together we see that the number of intelligible forms which a single Turki Primary Transitive Verb-root is capable of giving rise to, is not less than 28,000.\n\nProf. Max M\u00fcller states that \"each Verb in Greek, if conjugated through all its voices, tenses, moods, and persons, yields, together with its participles, about 1,300 forms\" (Max M\u00fcller Lectures on the Science of Language, 5th Ed., Vol., I, p. 305.)\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nADVERBS, POST-POSITIONS, CONJUNCTIONS, NUMERALS.\n\nTHE ADVERB.\n\nMany Adjectives are used as Adverbs without alteration.\n\nOf course it would be superfluous to give a long list of Adverbs, which would be found again in the Vocabulary. But there are certain groups of Compounds which call for notice:\n\n(a). First, a large number are formed by means of the Locative Affix da = \"at\" or \"in;\" also din = \"from,\" and ga or ka = \"to:\"  \nq\u0101i-da or q\u0101n-da = in what (place) ? where ?  \nun-da = in that (place), there.  \nu'yer-da = in that place.  \nuza-si-da = on the top of it.  \ntubon-da = at the bottom.  \nara-si-din = from the midst of it.  \nnim'-ish-ka &c. == wherefore ? (lit.) to what work ?\n\nIt will be observed that these are merely Pronouns or Substantives in the Locative, Dative, or Ablative cases.\n\n(b). The Affix dik, d\u0101q or d\u0101gh gives rise to some Adverbs of similitude.\n\nq\u0101i-d\u0101q = what like ? how ?  \nmun-d\u0101gh = like this, thus.  \nshun-d\u0101gh = like that, so.  \n&c.\nOther Compound Adverbs can be formed in the same way by means of the Affix d\u00e0q or dik with various Substantives or Pronouns.\n\n(c). Another set is formed by affixing cha, which implies \"extent\" or \"amount.\"\n\nq\u00e0n-cha = how much?\nmun-cha = this much.\nshun-cha = that much.\nni-cha = how much?\n\n(d). Sometimes this Affix cha is preceded by the Dative Post-position:\nan-ga-cha = \"to that extent\" or \"so far as that\".\nkachan-ga-cha = \"to what extent of time?\" i.e., \"till when?\"\n\nThus the Compound Affix gha-cha comes to mean, in point of place \"so far as,\" and in point of time \"until.\" It answers to the Compound Verbal Affix ghun-cha. This is written in K\u00e2shghar ghu-cha, which would derive it from the Future Participle ghu; or it may be the termination of the Indefinite Past Participle \"ghan\" with the same affix \"cha,\" and thus qel-ghun-cha would be literally \"to the extent of the (indefinite) doing,\" which sense agrees well enough with the common use of this form viz., \"whilst doing\" or \"than doing.\"\n\nNeg. qel-ma-ghun-cha = \"whilst not doing,\" i.e. \"until (he or it &c.) does.\"\n\nEx.: mulaq\u00e2t bol-ma-ghun-cha = until a visit was paid, (lit. \"whilst not paid\").\n\nSaying din-ing-gha kir-ghun-cha = than entering into thy Faith.\n\n(e). The Substantive y\u00e0n \"side\" forms several Adverbs:\n\nq\u00e0i-y\u00e0n-gha = to which side?\nq\u00e0i-y\u00e0n-da = in what direction?\nu-y\u00e0n-din or u-y\u00e0n-i-din = from that direction.\nbu-y\u00e0n-da or bu-y\u00e0n-i-da = in this direction.\n\n(f). Next comes a group of which the derivation is less plain, but the connection in sense and form evident.\n\nbiri = on this side.\nnari = on that side.\nichkari = inside [ichra = ditto (also found)].\ntashgari = outside.\nilgari = before.\nyoqari = above.\nutra or utru = opposite, facing.\n\nN. B.\u2014It will be observed that the sense of all these is locative while the terminations are two: the simple ari or iri, and the fuller kari or gari. It is probable from analogy that some word indicating \"place\" or \"locality\" must be the origin of these endings. That word must be found in the\nsimpler as well as in the fuller forms. Hence it may be inferred that the \\( k \\) (or \\( g \\)) of some of them is not a part of the word we are seeking. Looking then simply at \\( ari \\) or \\( iri \\), where we are to find the meaning \"locality,\" we are reminded at once of \\( yer-i = \"its place.\" \\) I venture to suggest, therefore, that \\( biri \\) may be a corruption of \\( bu-yeri (= this place), \\) and \\( nari \\) of \\( an-yeri \\) or \\( 'n-yeri (= that place).\n\nAs for the others, \\( ichkari, \\) &c., it will be observed that \\( ioh \\) is a Substantive (see Vocabulary) meaning \"the interior.\" \\( Tash \\) or \\( tish \\) means \"the outside.\" Again it may be gathered by comparing the Chaghatai word \\( ilai \\) \"before\" with the Uigur word \\( ilik \\) (? \\( il-lik) \\) \"first,\" that there must once have been a word \\( il \\) meaning \"front,\" which would be the origin of \\( il-gari. \\) Lastly, as there is an Uigur Verb \\( yog-la-maq = \"to be elevated,\" \\) it may be gathered that \\( yog \\) as a root conveys the idea of height, whence \\( yogari. \\)\n\nIt will be observed that such of these compounds as take the simpler form without \\( k, \\) begin with Pronouns, while those which take a \\( k, \\) &c., before the element \\( ari; \\) begin with Substantives. Now an Adjectival Pronoun can be prefixed to a Substantive without intermediation. But a Substantive cannot be so attached to another Substantive. The regular formation in such a case is to affix the particle \\( gi \\) or \\( ki \\) [see p. 279 (b)] to the former, making it into an Adjective of Relation. Now this is exactly what we find in these words. Wherever the first element is a Substantive, we find a \\( k \\) introduced between the two parts of the word. This confirms my supposition that the final element is a Substantive. If we wished to combine the Substantive \\( ioh \\) \"interior\" with the Substantive \\( yer \\) or \\( yeri \\) \"place\" according to rule\u2014we should say \\( ich-ki-yeri = \"the inward place\", \"the inside\" (\\( ich-ki \\) being an Adjective of Relation meaning \"inward\") a form easily contracted to \\( ich-k'ari. \\) And so, \\( tash-q'ari \\) for \\( tash-gi-yeri \\) \"the outside;\" \\( il-g'ari \\) for \\( il-gi-yeri \\) \"the fore-side;\" \\( yog'ari \\) for \\( yog-gi-yeri \\) \"the up-side.\" (\\( Utra \\) is probably from a Participle of \\( ut-mak \\) \"to cross\", and not from a Substantive.)\n\nBut it may be said that these words (if formed as I have suggested) are mere Compound Substantives, and not Adverbs. This is so true that they are often treated exactly like Substantives. They are not only declined by means of Post-positions (e.g., \\( ilgari-da, tashgari-gha, \\) &c.), but they are also frequently put in the \"possessed\" form, and govern the genitive of the object, e.g. \\( ui-ning ichkari-si-gha, \\) \"to the inside of the house\"; \\( maning ilgari-'m-da, \\) \"at the front of me.\"\n\nV\u00e1mb\u00e9ry thinks that these forms may be divided into a mark of the dative \\( ga, \\) and a final syllable \\( ra \\) or \\( re \\) (indicating a direction towards according to Schott)*. I have ventured to offer another solution above, which I\n\n* Quoted by V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, \"Chagataische Sprachstudien,\" p. 30, note.\nwill further support by remarking that the treatment of these forms as Substantives (see last para.) quite accords with the supposition that they are formed on the word \"yer-i.\" Thus \u00fci-ning ichkari-si-gha would be\u2014(lit.)\n\n\"to its inner place of the house,\" and maning ilgari-'m-da would be (lit.)\n\n\"at my front place of me.\"\n\nBut such expressions are hardly consistent with the supposition that ichkari is made up of ich the \"interior\" plus ka \"to\" (Dat.), plus ri (a Post-position supposed to imply direction towards). For \u00fci-ning ich-ka-ri-si-\n\ngha would then be (lit.) \"to its towards to interior of the house\" with 3 Post-positions (two of them identical) agglomerated on the top of one another, and only broken by a Possessive Affix detached from any Noun. And maning il-ga-ri-'m-da would be on the same system (lit.) \"at my towards to front of me.\"\n\nWith regard to such forms as qa\u00eft-ru \"backwards,\" \u00fcz-ra up &c. (to which may be added ich-ra \"inside\") quoted by Prof. V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry to prove that the syllable ra is separate from the (supposed) Dative termination ka, and does not form part with it of a single element kari or gari, this conclusion is doubtless correct, as moreover the examples biri and nari show. Prof. V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry and I are agreed in thinking that the k element is distinct from the r element. What they each represent, is a different question. If the latter meant \"direction towards,\" the addition of the former with much the same sense, (viz. ka = to) would be superfluous; and still more so, on this supposition, would be a second apposition of the same affix in the expression tashqari-gha, &c.\n\nMoreover in the words above quoted of Eastern Turkistani, I cannot trace any signification of \"direction towards.\" In that dialect they all apply to \"rest in a place\" (e.g. Tashqari is the name of the outer courtyard of a house, and ichkari that of the inner or women's court), as moreover can be gathered from the fact that to express motion the dative post-position is added; e.g. tashqari gha \"to the outside,\" \"outward\"; while it is quite correct to say ichkari ulturadur \"he is sitting inside,\" tashqari turdi \"he stood outside,\"* which would be abnormal if those words implied motion or direction towards. As for the forms ich-ra, \u00fcz-ra, &c. (from the substantives ich = interior and \u00fcza = surface) where we should expect to find the particle ki following the initial element, it is probable that in the more Westerly dialects (for they are not common in Eastern Turkist\u00e1n), the substantive yer\u00ee, having already been contracted to ra or ri, has further\n\n* The phrase, \"Baddshah birls Wazir tashqari tur-up irdi-lar\" = \"The King and Vizier were standing outside,\" has been found.\nsunk into a mere post-position, so that its substantival origin and the consequent necessity for the relative particle, ki, after other substantives attached to it, may have been forgotten.\n\nThus it is only when governed by Post-positions, as \"da\", \"gha\" or \"din\" (expressed or understood), that such forms can be considered as Adverbs, although these Post-positions are often suppressed as understood.\n\nWhen themselves governing Nouns or Pronouns, they of course become Compound Post-positions, as in the instances given above in the Note.\n\n(g). Another group is formed with the Affix lash, implying \"direction\" or \"inclination towards.\"\n\nyogari-lash = upwards.\ntuban-lash = downwards.\nura-lash = sloping upwards.\nara-lash = mixedly, i.e., middle-wards.\n\nPOST-POSITIONS.\n\nThese may be divided into two classes, SIMPLE and COMPOUND.\n\nThe SIMPLE Post-positions are more affixes attached to the words governed by them, and forming what may be called (for the sake of comparison with the inflectional languages) various cases, Dative, Locative, &c.\n\nThe Simple Post-positions are: da \"at\" or \"in,\" din \"from,\" gha, qa, ga or ka \"to,\" ning \"of,\" ni (sign of accusative absent in English), birla or bilan \"with,\" siz \"without,\" uchun \"for,\" \"because of,\" &c., &c.\n\nThe COMPOUND Post-positions are really Substantives, which are themselves affected by the simple Post-positions, e.g., ich-i-da \"inside,\" [lit.] \"in its interior;\" \u00fcza-si-gha \"a'top,\" (lit.) \"to its top.\" These are sometimes applied directly to a substantive. But they also frequently require other Post-positions to connect them with the words they govern, e.g.,\u2014din kin (lit.) \"after from ...;\"\u2014ning \u00fcza-si-da \"a'top of\u2014.\"\n\nWhen they are used with the genitive of the noun governed, the sense is made definite.\n\nEx.: Tigh-ning \u00fcza-si-da = on the top of the mountain.\nTigh-ning tuban-i-da = at the foot of the mountain.\n\nWhen din is used instead of ning, or when the two Substantives are merely placed in apposition without any Post-position between, the sense becomes indefinite (especially in the latter case).\n\nEx.: Tigh-\u00fcza-si-da = on the mountain-tops.\nTigh-din-tuban-da = below the mountains.\n\nThe following is a list of the more usual forms; it being remembered that all can employ ning in the definite sense before them, while such as here have din prefixed, use that post-position for the indefinite (the others being merely placed in apposition when the sense is indefinite):\u2014\nustun-da or gha, &c. = upon.\n\u00e4ltin-da \" = under.\n\u00e0stin-da \" = ditto.\nich-i-da \" = inside.\nar\u00e0-si-da \" = amidst.\n\u00fcz\u00e0-si-da \" = a'top of.\ntup\u00e0-si-da \" = upon.\ntub-i-da \" = in the bottom of.\ny\u00e0n-i-da \" = at the side of.\n(only with ning) g\u00e0sh-i-da \" = in the presence of.\nditto \u00e0ld-i-da \" = in front of.\nditto bu-y\u00fcz-i-da \" = on this side of.\nditto u-y\u00fcz-i-da \" = on the further side of.\nditto k\u00edn-i-da \" = in the rear of.\nditto arq\u00e0-si-da \" = at the back of.\nditto t\u00e0sh-i-da \" = on the outside.\n\nDefte. (ning); Indfte. (din) ichkari = inside.\nditto (din) arq\u00e0-da = behind.\nditto (din) k\u00edn = after.\nditto (din) tuban = below, in a lower position than.\nditto (din) tag-i-da = beneath, under, (with something superposed).\nditto (din) ustun = above, higher than.\nditto (din) dstin = below.\n\nAll these declinable Substantives admit also of the Possessive Affixes, e.g. maning q\u00e0sh-im-da = \u201cin my presence\u201d; saning y\u00e0n-ing-din = \u201cfrom thy side.\u201d\n\nThe Compound ghacha (gha \u201cto,\u201d cha \u201cthe extent of;\u201d see Adverbs) is used as a Post-position meaning \u201ctill\u201d or \u201cas far as.\u201d\n\nEx.: Tiz-ghacha = as far as the knee; K\u00e0shqar-ghacha = as far as Kashghar; b\u00e0sh-tokhi-ghacha = till first cock, (i.e., till cock-crow).\n\nCONJUNCTIONS.\n\nThere are not many Conjunctions in Turki. It borrows them frequently from Persian and Arabic.\n\nThe home-born ones are kim \u201cthat,\u201d takhi \u201cstill\u201d, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d, imdi \u201cthen\u201d, &c., and the compound an-din-k\u00edn \u201cafterwards\u201d, &c.\nNUMERALS.\n\nThe Cardinal numbers are:\n\n| bir       | yigarma = twenty. |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| iki       | \u00f6t\u00f6z = thirty.    |\n| \u00f6ch       | qirq = forty.     |\n| t\u00f6rt      | illiq = fifty.    |\n| besh      | altmish           |\n| alti      | oratmish = sixty. |\n| yette     | yetmish = seventy.|\n| sakiz     | sakzan = eighty.  |\n| togoz     | togzan = ninety.  |\n| un        | y\u00fcz = a hundred.  |\n|           | ming = a thousand.|\n\ntuman = ten thousand.\n\nThe intermediate numbers are formed by simple apposition, the multiples of ten coming first, as: un-bir = \"eleven,\" \u00f6t\u00f6z-besh = \"thirty-five\"; t\u00f6rt-y\u00fcz sakzan-\u00f6ch = \"four hundred and eighty-three\"; bir ming iki y\u00fcz togzan = \"one thousand two hundred and ninety.\" It will be seen that to express multiples of a number the smaller factor comes first, as above: t\u00f6rt-y\u00fcz = \"four hundred\".\n\nThere is a class of Substantives derived from the cardinal numbers, which had better be noticed in this place.\n\nbir-ao or bir-ailan = one by itself, \"a one.\"\nik'-ao or ik'-ailan = a two, a pair, both.\n&c., &c.\n\n[N.B.\u2014It is probably by a contraction of the former that we get the Post-position bir-lan, birla or bilan = together with, \"in one.\" See Kudatku Bilik, Introd.\u2014an\u0131ng imz\u00e1li bir-ailin \"with their proverbs.\"]\n\nNext we have the Numeral Adjectives or Ordinal Numbers. These are:\n\n| bir-inchi   | yigarma-'nchi = twentieth. |\n|-------------|---------------------------|\n| iki-'nchi   | \u00f6t\u00f6z-'unchi = thirtieth.   |\n| \u00f6ch-'\u00f6nchi  | qirq-'inchi = fortieth.    |\n| t\u00f6rt-'\u00f6nchi | illiq-'inchi = fiftieth.   |\n| besh-'inchi | atmish-'inchi = sixtieth.  |\n| alti-'nchi  | yetmish-'inchi = seventieth.|\n| yetti-'nchi | sakzan-'inchi = eightieth. |\n| sakiz-'inchi| togzan-'inchi = ninetieth. |\n| togoz-'unchi| y\u00fcz-'\u00fcnchi = hundredth.    |\n| un-'unchi   | ming-'inchi = thousandth.   |\n[N. B.\u2014The termination is often written and pronounced ji. The ordinal affix is only applied to the last term of a compound number as: bir y\u00fcz qirq-sakiz-inchi = one hundred and forty-eighth.]\n\nThere are also some Numeral Adverbs formed by the additional of 'n. As bir-in iki-'n = by ones and by twos.\n\nN. B.\u2014Perhaps a contraction of bir-din iki-din, which form also exists with the same meaning.\n\nBir-ar, (no ik-ar), \u00f6ch-ar, t\u00f6rt-ar &c., = \"singly,\" \"by threes,\" \"by fours,\" &c.\n\n\"Once,\" \"twice,\" &c., are formed with qatim \"time\" as, iki-qatim \"twice,\" besh-qatim \"five times,\" &c.\n\nTHE TURKI YEAR-CYCLE\n\nConsists of twelve solar years, each named after some animal in a fixed order, as follows:\n\n1. Sachkan \"The Mouse.\"\n2. U\u0161 \"The Ox.\"\n3. B\u00e1rs \"The Leopard.\"\n4. Turushgan \"The Hare.\"\n5. Balik \"The Fish or Dragon.\"\n6. Ilan \"The Serpent.\"\n\n7. At \"The Horse.\"\n8. Qo\u00ef \"The Sheep.\"\n9. Maimun \"The Ape.\"\n10. Tokhi \"The Cock.\"\n11. It \"The Dog.\"\n12. Tunghuz \"The Hog.\"\n\nThe present year (1874-75) is the year of the \"Dog.\" The year begins and ends in the spring, and is divided into twelve 'mansions,' in each of which the Sun spends a month (the twelve Signs of the Zodiac). These are known only by their Arabic names at the present day.\n\nThe above chronological arrangement of solar years is purely Turkish (or perhaps Tartar in the extended sense). The Muhammadan lunar years and months are in more common use now; the solar ones being only employed in calculations of age and in matters where it may be a question of the season.\n\nEach entire cycle is called a \"muchal.\"\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nDERIVATION OF WORDS.\n\nFORMATION OR DERIVATION OF SUBSTANTIVES.\n\n(a). A noun of the Agent is formed by adding the affix chi to the Future Participle or to the Infinitive form of a Verb:\nEx.: qel-ghu-chi = a doer.\n     bib-mak-chi = a giver.\n\n(b). A Noun of Profession is formed by affixing chi to the name of the object used, or of the matter dealt with:\n     Ex.: miltek-chi = a musketeer.\n          zakdt-chi = a Custom's official.\n\n(c). An Abstract Noun is formed by the addition of lik or luk (with Phonetic variation both of Vowel and Consonant) to an Adjective or Adverb, or even to another Substantive:\n     Ex.: Sarigh-lik = yellow-ness.\n          Tola-lik = much-ness.\n          Ustad-lik = art (from ustad \"artificer,\" p.).\n          Gum-rakh-lik = perdition (from gum-rakh, \"lost road,\" p.).\n     Also to an Infinitive, or the Verbal Adverb in \"ghuncha.\"\n          \u00fclt\u00fcr-mak-lik = slaughter (from \u00fclt\u00fcr-mak \"to kill\").\"\n          ishit-kuncha-lik = worth-hearing-ness.\n\n(d). A Noun of Origin is formed by adding lik (or luk) to the name of a country or place:\n     Ex.: Khogand-lik = a man of Khokand, a Khokandi.\n\n(e). A Noun of Connection, by adding chan to any word to denote continuous or frequent connection:\n     Ex.: aghrik-chan = one who is constantly ill, an invalid.\n          sala-chan = one who always wears a turban (salla).\n\n(f). A Noun of Fellow-ship is made by affixing dash or lash (answering to our \"\u2014\u2014 fellow\"):\n     Ex.: at\u00e0-dash = a brother by the same father (at\u00e0).\n          gursag-dash = a twin (lit. \"womb-fellow\").\n          ash-dash or tabaq-dash = a meal-fellow, or one who is a companion at a meal.\n          maktab-dash = school-fellow, (maktab, \"school,\" a.).\n\n(g). A Verbal Substantive is formed by affixing k, q, g or gh to the Root, supplying the proper vowel when necessary, before it. The meaning is either the action of the Verb, or the result of that action:\n     Ex.: t\u00fcz-uk = an institution (from t\u00fcz-mak).\n          titra-k = a trembling (from titra-mak \"to tremble\").\n\n[N.B.\u2014That this Substantive is derived from the Verb, and not vice versa, is shown by the fact that the verbal form derived from t\u00fcz\u00fck would be t\u00fcz\u00fck-la-mak, and not t\u00fcz-mak, &c. (see \"Formation of Verbs\").]\n\nDERIVATION OF ADJECTIVES.\n\n(a). The Adjective of Likeness is formed by affixing dik (which is subject to Phonetic variations of the guttural) to a Substantive:\n     Ex.: goi-diq = \"sheep-like\" (from goi \"a sheep\").\n(b). The Adjective of Relation is formed by the addition of the particle *gi* or *ki* to Substantive, Adjective, Adverb or Participle (see pp. 26 and 77):\n\nEx.: *k\u0131n-gi* = \"following,\" \"last\" (from *k\u0131n* = rear);\n*yetkan-gi* = \"arriving,\" or \"which has arrived.\"\n\n(c). The Adjective of Quality is formed by affixing *lik* (or *luk*) (subject to Phonetic variation of guttural) to a Substantive or Participle:\n\nEx.: *Dada-lik haqq* = \"a father's right\" (fatherly right).\n*Kafiristan-lik* = \"infidel\" (said of a whole country); from *Kafiristan* = \"a land of infidels\".\n\n(d). A Verbal Adjective is formed by adding *k* or *q* to a Verb Root (supplying a vowel before it when necessary).\n\nEx.: *aghri-q* = ill, from *aghri-maq* = to be ill.\n*tuq* = satisfied, from *toi-maq* = to be content.\n*t\u00fcz-\u00fck* = right, in order, (see p. 53 (f) and note).\n\n(e). An Adjective of Habit is formed by adding one of the affixes *kak*, *qaq* or *chak* to the root of a Verb:\n\nEx.: *\u00f6ch-qaq* = \"flying about much;\" from *\u00f6ch-maq* = \"to fly.\"\n*qurq-qaq* = \"fearing much;\" from *qurq-maq* = to fear.\n*irin-chak* = \"lazy;\" from *irin-mak* = \"to procrastinate.\"\n\n(f). An Adjective or Adverb of Fashion or Mode by adding *cha*:\n\nEx.: *mazlum-cha chappan* = a woman's robe. *Turk-cha min-mak* = to ride as a Turk.\n\nCOMPOUND AND DERIVATIVE VERBS.\n\n(a). The commonest compound is the Perfect Participle of one Verb prefixed to another Verb which completes the meaning, and which is conjugated as may be required.\n\nEx.: *s\u00e4t-ip \u00e0lm\u00e0q* = to buy, or take by purchase, (*s\u00e4t-ip* = sold, *\u00e0lm\u00e0q* = to take).\n\n*\u00e0lip-b\u00e0rm\u00e0q* = to take away (*\u00e0lip* = having taken; *b\u00e0rm\u00e0q* = to go), contracted in Yarkand to *ap\u00e0rm\u00e0q*.\n\n*yetip-qalm\u00e0q* = to exceed, (*yetip* = having reached a limit); *q\u00e0lm\u00e0q* = to remain (over).\n\n*k\u00fcy\u00fcp-birmak* = to burn, or \"give over to burning\" (*k\u00fcy\u00fcp* = having burnt, *birmak* = to give).\n\nIt will be remembered that the auxiliary *bolmaq* used in this way with the Perfect Participle of a Transitive Verb makes a Passive, e.g., *qelip-bolmaq* = to be done.\n\n(b). Another formation consists of the Present Participle of one\n\n*Birmak* \"to give\", *goi-maq* \"to put\", and some others, are often redundantly used in the second place, like the Hind. *d\u00e9na*, &c.\nVerb before another Verb of different signification, answering to the English combination of a similar kind.\n\nEx.: *qela-b\u00e0shlam\u00e0q*\u2014to begin doing, or \u201cto begin to do.\u201d\n\nA Verb is formed from a Substantive by affixing *la* to form the Verb-root. Verbs thus formed are numerous:\n\nEx.: *ish-la-m\u00e0q*\u2014to work (from *ish* \u201cwork\u201d).\n\n*b\u00e0sh-la-m\u00e0q*\u2014to lead or to begin, \u201cto head\u201d (from *b\u00e0sh* \u201chead\u201d).\n\nA Verb of colour is formed by affixing the syllable \u2018*r*\u2019 to the adjective of colour, &c.\n\nEx.: *\u00e0q-ar-m\u00e0q*\u2014to become white.\n\n*\u00d6z-ga-\u2019r-m\u00e0q*\u2014to change colour (from *\u00f6z-ga* = other).\n\n---\n\n**CHAPTER X.**\n\n**SYNTAX.**\n\nThe following are points to be noted:\u2014\n\n1. The nominative or subject generally comes first in a sentence, and the verb always last.\n\nEx.: \u201cHAZRAT SULTAN shik\u00e0r-ga chiqtilar\u201d=\u201cThe Sultan went out to hunt.\u201d\n\nWhen it is desired to put emphasis upon the subject, it comes immediately before the verb.\n\nEx.: \u201cHazrat Sult\u00e0n-ga kalima tayiba-ni KHWAJA KHAZAR \u00f6rgat-tilar.\u201d\n\nviz. \u201cIt was Khw\u00e1ja Khazar who taught the \u2018kalima-tayiba\u2019 to His Highness the Sultan.\u201d\n\nLiterally: \u201cTo His Highness the Sultan the kalima-tayiba (accusative) Khw\u00e1ja Khazar taught.\u201d\n\n2. The usual order of a simple sentence is:\n\n(a). That the accusative or object shall immediately precede the verb and its adverbs or adverbial expressions, (other cases coming first):\n\nEx.: \u201cKh\u2019\u00e0ja Abu-l-Nasr S\u00e0m\u00e0ni Hazrat Sult\u00e0n-ga IMAN-NI shul-yer-da \u00f6rgattilar.\u201d\n\n\u201cKh\u2019\u00e1ja Abu-l-Nasr S\u00e1m\u00e1ni to His Highness the Sultan the faith (acc.) on-the-spot taught.\u201d\n\n(b). Sometimes the seeming accusative forms really part of a compound verb, in which case also it immediately precedes it, but without the mark of the accusative.\n\nEx.: *Bu qirq kishi Hazrat-din bukhsat-\u00e0ldilar.* \u201cThese forty persons from His Highness took leave.\u201d\nThe sign of the accusative is also omitted if the sense is indefinite:\n\nEx.: *n\u00e0n yemak* = to eat bread.\n\n(c). Sometimes the accusative is put first for emphasis (viz., out of its proper place).\n\nEx.: \"*ul dushman-ni ara-din yoq-qelmadim*\" = \"That enemy from (our) midst I have not destroyed.\"\n\nUL BUTKHANA-NING TAM-I-NI awaal siz qup\u00e0rip-biring dedur,\nthat idol-temple-of the wall (acc.) first you having raised give, he says\nviz. \"He says, you first raise the wall of that idol-temple.\"\n\n3. All subordinate clauses, and all sentences which in English would be joined by conjunctions, in Turki have their respective verbs put in the form of some Verbal Adjective (generally that in 'p), the sense being thus kept flowing on until the whole of the long chain of sentences is concluded by a personal Verb:\n\nE. g. *Kashqar khalq-i-ni k\u00e0fir-lar \u00f6z din-i-gha kirguz-up, it eshak tunguz gosht-i-ni ye'p, har\u00e0m harish-ni mub\u00e0h bil-ip, mutluq k\u00e0fir bol-up, galip ikan.*\n\n\"The unbelievers having caused the people of Kashqar to enter into their own religion, they (the Kashgharis) having eaten the flesh of dogs, pigs and asses, having considered unclean snakes to be lawful (food), having become unrestrained infidels, have remained (so) [or, have become and remain unrestrained infidels].\"\n\nIt will be noticed here that the author has changed his subject or nominative after the first clause. This is merely due to careless writing, as we sometimes see in English [e. g. \"Having finished my dinner the dance began.\"] The last verb *gal-ip ikan* can only by courtesy be called a personal Verb. Often a speaker begins a string of sentences in the above form but finding that he has completed the expression of his meaning, he leaves his speech grammatically incomplete by omitting to add a final personal verb.\n\n4. The Genitive precedes the substantive which governs it:\n\nEx.: \"*Sultan-ning dada-si*\" = \"The Sultan's father.\"\n\n5. The adjective does the same usually, except in Persian or Arabic combinations.\n\nIf the adjective for any reason comes last, the Post-positions, &c., are affixed to it, as being the end of the compound substantive (formed of it and its noun):\n\nEx.: *kalima-tayiba-ni.*\n\n6. When an adjective is in the Comparative, the object of comparison precedes it.\n\nEx.: \"*Tash-din yam\u00e1n-r\u00e1g*\" = \"Than a stone worse.\"\n\n7. If the sentence predicates a quality of the subject the adjective or words expressing the quality immediately precede the verb:\nEx.: \"Sultan-ning dada-si kafir-lik-da tash-din ham yam\u00e0n-r\u00e0q irdi.\"\nLit. \"the Sultan's father in infidelity than a stone even worse was.\"\n\n8. Relative clauses in who or which, are not so expressed in Turki. They are attached to the substantive to which they refer (preceding it), and form a compound adjective or subordinate sentence with its verb in the form of a verbal adjective, generally in gan (if Present or Past) or in durghan if Future.\n\n(a). Ex.: AT-NI SAT-KAN kishi \u2014 The person who sells the horse.\nHorse (acc.) selling person.\n\nERTI KETA-DURGHAN hajji \u2014 The pilgrim who is going to start\nTo-morrow about-to-go pilgrim.\n\nto-morrow.\n\nIf the (English) relative pronoun is in the accusative, dative, &c., still the Turki form is similar to the above (the sign of the accusative &c., being omitted), and the verbal adjective may have its subject or nominative expressed before it (or understood).\n\nEx.: (In the Accusative) BIZ QEL-GHAN ish-lar \u2014 The deeds which\nwe do.\n\nSAN K\u00d6RGAN kishi \u2014 the person whom thou\nsawest (or seest).\n\n(In the Dative) BIZ BASH UE-GHAN nima \u2014 that to which we strike the\nLit. we head-striking thing.\n\nhead (bow).\n\n(In the Genitive) MAN AT-I-NI URGHAN. adam keldi \u2014 The\nI horse his (acc.) having struck man came\n\nman whose horse I struck came.\n\nAT-I \u00dcLGHAN kishi yighla\u0161-dur \u2014 The person whose horse died, weeps.\nhorse his having died person weeps.\n\nTUSH-\u00dcM-DA K\u00d6RGAN \u015fer. Lit. \"in-my-dream-seen lion.\"\nViz., \"The lion which I saw in my dream.\"\n\n\"NICHAND YIL-NING BU YUZI-GHA BI\u00c5ZAT WA MASHAKKAT BILAN\nTAPKAN farzand-im.\" Lit. \"So-many-years-on-this-side-of-with-self-denial-and-pain-obtained son-of-mine.\nviz., \"My son, whom,\" &c.\n\nOr, conversely, the rule may be stated thus: The Substantive in Turki to which is attached (i.e. prefixed) a verbal adjective (indefinite) in gan, may be either the subject of the action of that verbal adjective, or its object (direct or indirect); and the said verbal adjective may accordingly be rendered in English, as the context may indicate, either by \"who or which (does or did) e.g satkan kishi = the person who sells.\"\n\nOr else by \"whom or which (so-and-so does or did)\"\u2014e.g. k\u00f6rkan kishi = the person whom (so and so) saw, [which may also be translated \"which was seen (by so and so)\"].\nOr else by \"to whom or to which (so and so does or did),\" e.g. b\u0101sh urghan nima = the thing to which (so and so) bows the head; &c., &c.\n\nAs in the first case the object may be expressed with its proper sign before the verbal adjective (e.g. AT-NI satkan kishi \"the person who sells the horse\") thus forming a subordinate clause in the sentence; so also, in the latter cases, the subject may be and is generally, prefixed to the verbal adjective for clearness' sake, except when otherwise indicated sufficiently plainly. Thus: BIZ-qelghan ish \"the deed which we do\" (or \"the deed done by us\"); SAN k\u00f6rgan kishi \"the person whom thou sawest\" [SAN-NI k\u00f6rgan kishi would be \"the person who saw thee.\"]\n\nBut in t\u016bsh-\u00fcm-da k\u00f6rgan sher\" the possessive affix \u00fcm sufficiently indicates that it was I that saw the lion, so that it is unnecessary to add the subject and say \"MAN...k\u00f6rgan...\" On the other hand if the lion were the seer we should say: man-NI k\u00f6rgan sher \"the lion which saw me.\"\n\n(b). If the subordinate clause merely predicates the existence of its subject in a certain relation, so that it has no verb except \"to be,\" the Turki language omits the verbal adjective or participle of this verb, and supplies its place with the particle 'gi' or 'ki' to connect the clause with its subject, which comes last in order.*\n\nEx.: \"TURKIST\u00c2N-TARAF-I-DA-GI khalq.\" Lit. \"Turkist\u00e1n direction-in-(being) people.\"\n\nviz. \"The people that are in the direction of Turkist\u00e1n.\"\n\n(c). To express a simile, the word or the whole subordinate sentence is connected with its subject by the particle 'dik' = like.\n\nEx.: \"DOZAKH-NING-DARW\u0100ZA-SI-NI ACHQAN-DIQ aghz.\"\n\nLit. Hell of door its (acc.) having opened like mouth.\n\nviz., \"a mouth as if opening the door of Hell.\"\n\nLikelihood is similarly expressed:\n\n* This syllable gi or ki takes the place (in sentences where the subordinate verb is \"to be\") of the indefinite Participle or verbal adjective of that verb. For if the translation of: \"the lion which appeared in my dream\" is t\u016bsh-\u00fcm-da k\u00f6rongan sher, then the translation of \"the lion which is in the jungle\" would naturally be \"jangal-da ikan sher.\" But instead of that they say: \"jangal-da-gi sher.\" Thus gi takes the place of ikan, and the idea is suggested that it may be a contraction of the same. For the Yarkand\u00eds often say ikin for ikan, and I have found one example of this being further contracted to 'ki'. [Ex. bu gai-si paighambar-ning ruh-i 'ki \"what prophet's soul may this be?\" where the full expression would be \"gai-si paighambar-ning ruh-i ikan.\"] The quasi-Pronoun ki (see Pronouns) points to the same derivation. Thus maning-ki is the idiomatic expression for \"that which is mine;\" but it may be taken as a contraction of maging ikin, which would mean the same. See also \"Derivation of Adjectives (b)\" kin-gi, yetken-gi, &c., p. 279.\n\nTake the following: Turkist\u00e1n-da-gi khalq Musalman boldi; AT maning-ki, eshak saning-ki; Kin-gi adam yetmadi; in each of these cases the word ikin or ikan might be\nEx.: Biz-ga ham z\u00e1k\u00e2t-ning \u015fu\u00e2bi-ni t\u00e2p-qu-diq* bir i\u0161h-ni\nUs to also customs of merit (acc.) likely-to-obtain one work (acc.)\nbuyur-sunlar. viz., \u201cCommand to us also some work that may be likely to\ncommand.\n\nobtain (for us) the merit of customs (paying).\u201d\n\n9. A conditional sentence is usually expressed without any \u2018if\u2019 by\nputting the verb into the Potential:\n\nEx.: \u201cShul Butkh\u00e2na-ning t\u00e1m-i-ni siz qup\u00e0r-sa-ngiz.\u201d\nLit. That Idol-temple of wall (acc.) you may raise.\nviz., \u201cIf you raise,\u201d &c., or \u201cshould you raise.\u201d\n\n10. With the adverb \u2018ilgari\u2019 meaning before, the verb (in the form\nof the Infinitive Verbal Subst.) is put in the negative:\n\nEx.: Ul Sultan bu \u2018alam-gha kel-mas-din nichand yil ilgari:\nthat Sultan this world to coming not than several years before\nEnglish\u2014\u2018some years before that Sultan had come into this world.\u2019\n\n(Cf. \u201cavant qu\u2019il ne fut venu au monde.\u201d)\n\nSo also with the verbal affix \u201cghuncha\u201d \u201cwhilst\u201d, to produce the\nmeaning \u2018until.\u2019\n\nEx.: mulaq\u00e2t bol-ma-ghuncha=\u2018whilst a visit had not been paid\u2019 or\nvisit being not whilst\n\n\u2018till a visit was paid.\u2019\n\n(Cf. \u201ctant qu\u2019une visite n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\u201d)\n\n11. There are two ways of quoting a statement made by another per-\nson (or an opinion ascribed to him), answering to the English forms: (a)\nThat which professes to give the very words of the speaker in inverted\ncommas; (b) \u201cHe said that\u201d followed by the third person (of the supposed\nspeaker).\n\nsubstituted for ki or gi grammatically though not idiomatically: Turkistan-da ik\u00e2n\nkhalq Musalm\u00e2n boldi \u201cthe people that are in Turkistan have (has) become Musalm\u00e2n.\u201d\nAt maning ik\u00e2n, eshak maning ik\u00e2n \u201cthe horse (is) what is mine, the ass what is thine.\u201d\nKin ik\u00e2n adam yetmadi \u201cthe man who is (or was) behind has not arrived.\u201d (This may\nbe shown to be grammatically a correct form, by substituting other verbs: e.g. Tur-\nkistan-da turgan khalq, \u201cthe people who stay in Turkistan\u201d; kin galghan adam \u201cthe\nman who remains behind\u201d; maning bolghan at \u201cthe horse which becomes mine.\u201d) So\nthat the particle ki or gi in all the meanings described respectively under Pronouns,\np. 232, under Adjectives of Relation, p. 279, and as taking the place of the English relative\npronoun, here p. 283\u2014in all these applications seems to be a corruption of the Participle\nik\u00e2n or ik\u00een of the verb substantive.\n\nIt must not be confounded, as some grammarians have done, with the conjunction\nkim (Persian ki\u00eeh) used in that language and in Osmanli Turkish to supply the place of\na relative Pronoun but which is really a mere \u201cconnective\u201d having the Personal Pro-\nnouns understood (or expressed) after it. See Forbes\u2019 Persian Gram. \u00a7 68: e.g. An kin\nchun pistah didam-ash hama magz \u201cHo whom I saw &c.\u201d Lit. \u201cHe, that I saw him &c.\u201d\n\n* Here tap-qu-diq is the Participle of Probability; so that this sentence is of the\nform described above under \u00a7 8 (a).\n(a). The former is rendered in Turki by prefixing some expression, such as \"D\u00e9di\" or \"aitti kim\" = \"he said\", \"he said that\" (though this is sometimes omitted) and finishing with the participle \"De'p\" = \"having said.\" These take the place of our inverted commas to mark the beginning and end of the quotation.\n\nEx.: Aidelar Al-hamdu-l-Illah talab-im muyessar boldi,\nThey said \"Thank God (the object of) my search has been obtained,\" having said.\n\n(b). The other form is rendered in Turki by putting the quotation in the words of the speaker, with this exception that the subject (or nominative) of the sentence quoted is in the accusative, as being the object of the governing verb 'he said' or 'he thought.'\n\nEx.: Sani \u00fcldi d\u00e9di = He said that thou wert dead.\nLit. thee he died he said.\n\nWhich may be rendered, \"he reported thee dead,\" or \"he said (of) thee, he is dead.\"\n\nHere \"sani\" (thee) is governed (in the accusative) by the verb \"d\u00e9di\" (he said), while the statement itself is in the actual words of the speaker, of which the above pronoun in the accusative forms the subject (unless we may suppose a nominative he understood).\n\nBiz-ni \u00e0lur-mikin dep parw\u00e0h gelma\u00ef = without fearing lest us will-they-take having said care making not we should take (it).\n\n[Here the biz-ni (acc.) seems to be governed by the \"dep,\" and not by the \"parw\u00e0h gelma\u00ef\" which would govern the ablative \"biz-din.\"]\n\n12. The reflective pronoun \u00f6z is used (like khud in Persian, or ap, apna in Hindustani) instead of a demonstrative or possessive pronoun, to fix the meaning on the subject of the sentence.\n\nEx.: Ya'qub \u00f6z-i-ning \u00e1t-i-ni ultur-di = Ya'qub killed his (own) horse.\n\nYa'qub aning \u00e1t-i-ni ultur-di would mean: Ya'qub killed his (viz., some one else's) horse.\n\nAgain: Man sani \u00f6z-\u00f6ng-ning \u00fci-ng-da k\u00f6r-d\u00f6m = I saw thee in thy (own) house [here the termination \u00f6ng leaves no doubt of the person].\n\nBut, 'Ali Ya'qub-ni \u00f6z-i-ning \u00fci-da k\u00f6rdi, is a doubtful phrase; for though by rights the \u00f6z should refer to the subject of the sentence ('Ali), yet as the accusative \"Ya'qub-ni\" comes so close before, it would probably be understood to mean: \"'Ali saw Ya'qub in his (Ya'qub's) own house.\"\n\nTo save the doubt it would be better to put it as follows:\n\nYa'qub-ni 'Ali \u00f6z-i-ning \u00fci-da k\u00f6rdi = Ali saw Ya'qub in his (Ali's own) house.\nWhile to express the other meaning without leaving a doubt, the reflective pronoun would be dispensed with, and the demonstrative used, viz.\n\n'Ali Ya'qub-ni ANING \u00fci-da k\u00f6r-di = Ali saw Ya'qub in his (Ya'qub's) house.\n\nIt is the same with the other cases (\u00f6z taking the proper possessive affix of the person): Ex. man \u00f6z-\u00f6mx-ni urdum \"I struck myself.\"\n\nYa'qub \u00f6z-i-din qurgti \"Ya'qub feared (from) himself.\"\n\n13. There being no verb \"to have,\" its sense is expressed by means of the impersonal verb b\u00e4r \"there is.\"\n\n(a) by putting the subject in the locative:\n\nEx.: man-da dt bar = there is to me (i.e., \"I have\") a horse.\n\nP\u00e0dsh\u00e0h-da \u00fci b\u00e4r = there is to the king's house, i.e., the king has a house.\"\n\n(b) by putting the (English) subject in the genitive; and the (English) object in the possessed form of the proper person:\n\nEx.: Maning \u00e1t-im b\u00e4r \"my horse exists\" or \"I have a horse.\"\n\nP\u00e0dsh\u00e0h-ning \u00e1t-i b\u00e4r \"the king's horse is (or exists),\" i.e., \"the king has a horse.\"\n\nOf course with the addition of the demonstrative pronoun the verb b\u00e4r would resume its simple meaning of \"is.\"\n\nEx. Bu maning \u00e1t-im b\u00e4r = \"this is my horse.\"\n\n14. The passive forms of intransitive verbs are not impossible in Turki. Sometimes they are in point of meaning the passive of the causative rather than of the primary intransitive verb, which can of course have no passive logically [See \"Secondary verbs, II,\" note at end]. But often again they take a kind of impersonal sense answering to the French form in \"on.\" Thus with b\u00e4r-maq \"to go;\" b\u00e4r-il-di is its passive past tense, 3rd person singular. Literally it would be translated \"it has been gone,\" which comes to mean \"one has gone\" \"on est all\u00e9.\"\n\n15. The Noun of the agent in chi governs the same case as the primary verb, as also do all other verbal forms.\n\nEx.: KUFF\u00c0R-NI yog-qelghu-chi. \"A destroyer (of) infidels (acc.).\"\n\n16. To represent the expressions which employ the infinitive in European tongues, the Turki employs its own infinitive or other verbal noun as a noun in the accusative or other case.\n\nEx.: QEL-M\u00c0Q-NI kh'ahlai-mon = I wish to do.\n\nthe doing (acc.) wish I\n\nYelgh\u00e0n AITMAK gun\u00e0h dur = to tell lies is a sin.\n\nOr the form in gali may be used, answering to English \"in order to.\"\n\nEx.: \u00fclt\u00fcr-gali buyur-di = he commanded to kill, or, he gave orders for the killing.\n\n\u00e0l-ghali kel-dim = I came (in order) to take.\n17. In interrogative phrases only one syllable or word of interrogation is necessary. Thus, if the words *nima* (what?), *q\u00e2i-si* (which?), or generally, any interrogative adverb, appears in the body of the sentence, the final interrogative *mu* or *ma*, or the dubitative *m\u2019ikin*, is not required. Otherwise it is:\n\nThus: *nima b\u00e2r* \u201cwhat is there?\u201d but, *shubu b\u00e2r mu* \u201cis it this?\u201d\n\nAgain: *Bu q\u00e2i-si paighambar-ning ruh-i ikin*, \u201cWhat prophet\u2019s soul may this be?\u201d\n\nbut: *Bu ful\u00e2n paighambor-ning ruh-i m\u2019ikin* \u201cMay this be such-and-such a prophet\u2019s soul?\u201d\n\n---\n\n**End of the Grammar.**\nAPPENDIX.\n\nTRANSLATIONS AND SELECTIONS.\n\nY\u00c1RKANDI T\u00d3RKI VERSION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER.\n\nEh! bizlar-ning k\u00f6k-da-gi d\u00e0da-'miz,\nOh us of Heaven-in Father-our;\nSaning at-ing ulugh bolsun;\nOf thee name thy great be;\nSaning p\u00e2dsh\u00e2hiq-ing kelsun;\nOf thee kingdom thy come;\nSaning riz\u00e2liq-ing asm\u00e2n-da bolghan-dik, yer-da ham bolsun;\nOf thee pleasure thy Heaven-in being like earth-in also may it be;\nBiz-ning \u00e1zuq-umiz-ni har-k\u00f4n yet-kuz;\nUs-of food our (acc.) each day cause-to-reach;\nBiz yam\u00e2n-liq qelghan-lar-gha baghishla-ghan-cha gun\u00e2h-\nWe bad-ness doers to forgiving-in-the-measure-of sin\nimiz-ni baghishla;\nour (acc.) forgive;\nGun\u00e2h-boladurghan waqt-ni kurs\u00e2t-ma,\nSin about to be opportunity (acc.) present-not\nMagar biz-ni yam\u00e2nliq-din qut-q\u00e2z;\nBut us (acc.) bad-ness from protect;\nAning-nohun-kim p\u00e2dsh\u00e2liq u kuchluk-lik u roshan-lik san-ga\nOf this because that kingdom and power and glory to thee\nmango dur.

Therefore I do not choose to neglect them (lit. the neglecting them). When I go out on a journey (lit. in my going out to a journey) by paying customs (lit. having given customs), I cause advantage to Musalm\u00e1ns; should I abandon trade I should remain excluded from the merit of paying customs.\"\n\nAnd again he spoke: \"Oh disciples, have ye not heard this story? One day the Prophet of God had sat down in the Blessed Mosque. Several indigent companions (of the Prophet) came in (lit. having entered, came). They said: 'Oh Prophet of God, other companions (of thine) (who are) rich, pay customs. To us also command some work that may obtain (for us) the merit of customs (paying), (that) we also having done that work may obtain the merit of customs (paying).' Thus they petitioned (lit. having said they made petition).\n\n\"The Holy Prophet said: 'Oh poor companions, daily the service of morning prayer having been recited, if you say thirty-three times 'Subh\u00e1n-allah;' thirty-three times 'Al-hamdu-l Illah;' thirty-three times 'Allahu akbar;' ten times 'La Il\u00e1ha ill' Allah, wahdahu, la-shar\u00edka lahu, lahu-l-mulku wa lahu-l-hamdu wa hua 'ala kulli shai-in qad\u00edr,'\u2021 ye will obtain the merit of giving customs. (Thus) saying he commanded.\"\n\n\"These indigent companions remained very happy. Some days after the rich companions having heard, they also recited (the words). These poor companions having again come into the presence of the Holy Prophet of God, said: 'Oh Prophet of God, the rich companions also having recited the prayers which we have to recite (lit. the us-to-be-recited prayers), are obtaining the merits of these also!' thus they represented.\n\n* Here the word \"disciple\" is put in the plural out of respect, although a single one is indicated by the word bir \"one.\" This is a very common usage.

He has no partner; Dominion is His, and praise is His, and His power extends over all. A.\n\"Then the Holy Prophet said: 'Zalika fazl-ullahi yutih\u012b man ya-\nsha';* that is: 'God the Exalted gives the merit of (paying) customs\nto (whatever) servant of His he chooses (lit. to his chosen servant). I,\nhow shall I do (anything)?' Thus he answered.\n\n\"Therefore it is known that in (paying) customs there is exceeding\nprofit. To this end I have not abandoned commerce,\" he said.\n\nExtract II.\n\n'It is that Abu-an-nasr S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed' said the Holy Prophet of God 'who\nshall acquire Sult\u00e1n Satuq Bughra Kh\u00e1n for the Faith.'\n\nAt once the companions computed the date and wrote: 'After the\nProphet of God shall have passed from the world three hundred and thirty-\nthree years, in the land of Turkist\u00e1n, one by name the Holy Sult\u00e1n Satuq\nBughra Kh\u00e1n Gh\u00e1zi, a noble person, shall come into existence; at the age\nof twelve he shall be acquired to the Faith.' Thus they wrote.\n\nAnd again on the spot the Prophet of God spoke: \"Awwalu man asla-\nma min at-Turk.\"\u2020\n\nThe meaning of this saying is this: as much as to say that: 'from\nthe direction of Turkist\u00e1n Sult\u00e1n Satuq Bughra Kh\u00e1n Gh\u00e1zi will become a\nMusalm\u00e1n.'\u2021\n\nSo that after a certain period the Holy Kh\u2019\u00e1jah Abu-an-nasr S\u00e1m\u00e1-\nni came into existence in this world; as he went on reading the revealed\nknowledge, he saw this saying: \"Awwalu man aslama min at-Turk.\" 'What\nsort of a person may this Sult\u00e1n Satuq Bughra Kh\u00e1n be' he said (to him-\nself). Without having seen him he began to love him.\n\nHe looks\u00a7 at the date; but little (time) remains to the coming into\nexistence of the Holy Sult\u00e1n. His love and friendship coming off victorious\nhe started on a journey in search of the Sult\u00e1n, in the direction of Turkis-\nt\u00e1n.\n\nExtract III.\n\nThe Holy Sult\u00e1n Satuq Bughra Kh\u00e1n Gh\u00e1zi entered the twelfth year\nof his age.|| Until that (time) the Holy Sult\u00e1n was in appearance an\ninfidel.\n\n* Lit. \"That is the grace of God which falls upon whomsoever He chooses.\" A.\n\u2020 Lit. \"The first who professed Isl\u00e1m among the Turks.\" A.\n\u2021 This is of course a very free rendering by the pious historian, for in the Pro-\nphet's traditional saying no name is reported.\n\u00a7 Lit. \"he might look,\" Pros.

Going along hunting he arrived at a place called Baq\u0161 in Lower Art\u016bsh. He looked; (and saw that) several men of pleasing appearance and of pure disposition had encamped on a grassy spot. The Holy Sult\u00e1n, with his companions, started in the direction of these travellers.\n\nHaving looked, they were astonished saying: \u201cIn these cities there were not (ever) such people, such men. What people are these? Come! let us go and see.\u201d (Thus) saying they moved on.\n\nBut these travellers* were the Holy Kh\u2019\u00e1jah Abu-an-nasr S\u00e1m\u00e1ni (and his company). Abu-an-nasr\u2020 looks\u2021: several horsemen are coming. They came near. He looks (again): it must be the Holy Satuq Bughra Kh\u00e1n (whose mention he had) seen in the History (of the Prophet\u2019s sayings).\n\nOn seeing (him) Abu-an-nasr said: \u201cThanks be to God, (the object of) my petition has been obtained,\u201d\u00a7 and he rejoiced exceedingly.\n\nImmediately he said to his servants: \u201cThe Lord of the present and future worlds, (the object of) my desire comes. Or rather, the reason of my coming to this country was because of this noble person. Oh servants! leave the baggage open,\u201d (so) saying, with Abu-an-nasr leading, all the travellers stood up to prayer. Having finished their prayer, they came back to their places and sat down. Till that time the Sult\u00e1n remained on the back of his horse.\n\nThe Sult\u00e1n, astonished, said: \u201c(These) are|| wonderful travellers; without caring for us, leaving their baggage open, they have become occupied in striking their heads on the ground.\u201d\n\nHe was (saying) these words, (when) Ab\u00fa-an-nasr came seven steps of ground into the presence of the Sult\u00e1n, and made a salutation. The Sult\u00e1n, getting off his horse, went to meet the Kh\u2019\u00e1jah Ab\u00fa-an-nasr. The Kh\u2019\u00e1jah invited\u00b6 the Sult\u00e1n and brought (him) with honour and respect to the place (where he was) sitting; bringing out his best goods by pairs to the Sult\u00e1n, he placed these choice things in (his) presence.\n\nThen the Sult\u00e1n with heart and soul accepted (the attentions of) the\n\n---\n\n* K\u00e1rw\u00e1n is used in Central Asia to mean one of the persons composing what we should call a \u201ccaravan,\u201d and not to mean the entire assemblage, as is indeed evident from the word in the text being in the plural.\n\n\u2020 The long titles are omitted for brevity.\n\n\u2021 The \u201chistoric present.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 The word \u201cde\u2019p\u201d (having said), which comes in here, may be taken as answering to our inverted commas.\n\n|| Duk for dur (respectful form).\n\n\u00b6 Takl\u00edf qelm\u0101q, a common Oriental expression for \u201cto invite\u201d.

As it was in the Sult\u00e1n's mind, (that) the Holy Khizr had said some one should be produced who should teach him Musalm\u00e1nism,* he doubted whether this might not be the very person. He asked: \"What (is your) name\"? Then the Kh'\u00e1jah answered \"my name is Ab\u00fa-an-nasr S\u00e1m\u00e1ni.\"\n\nThe Sult\u00e1n recognised that this must be the person spoken of by Khizr\u2020 (on whom be peace).\u2021 He rejoiced and said: \"Oh father, whatever you may say I will agree to. But, while we sat by on horseback, you left your baggage open, without fearing lest we should take (it), and became basied in striking your heads on the ground. We know you not. Tell us the truth of these proceedings of yours.\" (Thus) he spoke.\n\nThen the Kh'\u00e1jah said: \"Oh, Prince, in this world there is not an abiding world. Every one will go from this world; money, goods, riches, will not satisfy men; but rather by reason of money and goods men become captive to Hell. And again, we all are about making a journey from this world to the next, we have made ready the provisions and accoutrements (fitted) to a person who is travelling from this world.\" (Thus) he answered ..................................................................\n\nThe Sult\u00e1n having heard this speech from the Kh'\u00e1jah, a fear was produced in his heart.\n\nHe said: \"Oh Kh'\u00e1jah, what dost thou say (when) about to become a Musalm\u00e1n; I also will say it and become a Musalm\u00e1n.\"\n\nThe Holy Kh'\u00e1jah said: \"Repeat the Kalimah tayibah 'L\u00e1 Il\u00e1ha ill' All\u00e1h, Muhammad Ras\u00fal-ill\u00e1h' (there is no Divinity but All\u00e1h, Muhammad is the Messenger of All\u00e1h), (and) the Kalimah-i-Shah\u00e1dat 'Ash-hadu an l\u00e1 Il\u00e1ha ill' All\u00e1h, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa Ras\u00faluh\u00fa' (I testify that there is no Divinity but All\u00e1h, and I testify that Muhammad is his servant and his messenger).\"\n\nThe Sult\u00e1n said the 'Kalimah-i-Shah\u00e1dat (the declaration of testimony) and the 'Kalimah tayibah' (the beautiful declaration).\n\nThen he asked: \"Who is the person (you) call Muhammad?\" The Holy Kh'\u00e1jah said: \"(He who is) called Muhammad (is) the friend of God.

With all this fighting, (matters) did not come right. Othman Bughra Kh\u00e1n, a son of the Holy Sultan, with sixty persons, met with martyr's deaths. The infidels, fighting as they went, retreated to a town of China.\n\n* A certain \"Hazrat Begam\" is reverenced as a local saint at Qisil.

The people made an offering of their money and goods, their lives and bodies. They gave all of them to the poor.\n\nOn behalf of this people (the Princes) prayed for a blessing. All the Musalm\u00e1ns said \u2018Amen.\u2019 The prayer on behalf of these Musalm\u00e1ns (converts) met with acceptance.

Is it necessary for them to see the town in order to take it, or can they take it without seeing it?||\n\nJuqta Rash\u00edd exclaimed: \u201cOh Vizier, what speech is this? The city stands evident to the view,\u00b6 (yet) he speaks thus!\u201d\n\nThe magician responded: \u201cHowever many days that army may stay here, (so long) will I conceal the town.\u201d\n\nJuqta Rash\u00edd having saluted him sat down. All the infidels were glad, and beat a roll on the drum of rejoicing.\n\nMorning came. When the Holy Im\u00e1ms had concluded their prayers, they ordered a certain one (saying): \u201cGo in (to the city) and say: These who have come are the descendants of the Holy Mustafa** (on whom be God\u2019s mercy and peace). Their Holy names are Im\u00e1m N\u00e1siru-\u2019d-d\u00edn, Im\u00e1m Mu\u2019inu-\u2019d-d\u00edn, Im\u00e1m Zuh\u00faru-\u2019d-d\u00edn, and Im\u00e1m Qiw\u00e1mu-\u2019d-d\u00edn. They have come from M\u00e1wara an-Nahar in order to conquer the land of K\u00e1shqar, with an army of a hundred and forty thousand. They have ordered me (saying), go in and say to those infidels, hang your bows about your necks, come into my presence and become Musalm\u00e1ns professing the Faith. If they do not profess the Faith, beginning with Juqta Rash\u00edd,\n\n* Lit. \u201cBy head of man.\u201d\n\u2020 A similar story was told me at Qizil itself, where also I obtained my copy of the Taskiratu-l-Bughra (see Shaw\u2019s High Tartary, page 240).\n\u2021 The story here returns to the time when Yusuf Q\u00e1dir had obtained assistance from the Im\u00e1ms of Mada\u00edn, while Hasan Bughra Kh\u00e1n had gone on ahead (Ext. XXII) to recover K\u00e1shghar, and had been killed (Ext. XXV). We seem to have here a slightly different tradition.\n\u00a7 Lit. \u201cThere is to us\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n|| Lit. \u201cSeeing will they take the town, will they also take it not seeing?\u201d\n\u00b6 Lit. \u201cStanding showing itself.\u201d\n** The Prophet Muhammad.\nwe will kill all the infidels, capture their children, and destroy their towns.\"*\n\nHaving heard these words, the light of the world became darkness to the infidels. The infidels considered and said: \"We will not turn back from our faith.\" They pitched a green tent on (the roof of) the palace. The Sham\u00e0n leading, one and forty magicians became occupied in their magic.\n\nThey (the Musalm\u00e1ns) prepared to fight. The city disappeared. They recognized that the magician must have exercised (his) enchantments. Morning broke, the city became visible again. They beat a roll on the battle drum. At the moment when the bold soldiers were urging their horses to the battle, the city disappeared.\n\nIn the same manner for forty years they fought together at (this) town of China. Finally one night Juqta Rashid with all his army, fled.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEXTRACT XXIX.\n\nThe Holy Im\u00e1ms started in pursuit of Juqta Rash\u00eed and Nuqta Rash\u00eed.\n\n..............The Im\u00e1ms were at prayers. The infidels, finding the occasion opportune, slew\u2020 the Holy Im\u00e1ms like sheep, at the time of prostration.\n\nThen they all fought for the standard,\u2021 and cut off its bearer's hand. Without giving up the standard, he seized it between his knees. They cut off his (legs at the) knees also. He (then) held on to it with his neck (and shoulder). They severed his neck. The standard, soaring into the air, disappeared. The sun was eclipsed.\u00a7 the world became darkened. A voice came from the sky, a murmur came forth from the earth; the infidels went off towards China. One man fled and went to K\u00e2shqar, and gave the news to the King Y\u00fbsuf Q\u00e2dir Kh\u00e1n.\n\nY\u00fbsuf Q\u00e2dir Kh\u00e1n at once rode forth; (riding) night and day he arrived, and (when) he saw the sacred heads of the Holy Im\u00e1ms severed from their bodies, his senses left him. Again, he became conscious, and saw that the bodies of men were lying scattered like the stones of the wilderness. He wondered at not being able to distinguish between infidels and Musalm\u00e1ns.||\n\n* Lit. \"having killed, &c., .......... ....he destroys.\" Here the quotation is not kept to the proper person of the verb.\n\n\u2020 Lit. \"cut the throats.\"\n\n\u2021 Lit. \"saying, let us take the tugh (a standard made of a Yak's tail).\"\n\n\u00a7 Lit. \"seized.\"\n\n|| Lit. \"saying, it is not known whether infidels or Musalm\u00e1ns, he remained in wonder.\"\nHe prayed, a thunder-storm arose, water flowed down from the mountains, rain fell from Heaven; it placed the faces of the Musalm\u00e1ns in the direction of the 'Qibla'; it turned the infidels' bodies face downwards, and carried away the heads of the unbelievers.\n\nThen they took the Holy Im\u00e1ms' sacred bodies, and placed them in coffins. The other Musalm\u00e1ns' bodies they buried.\n\nThe date was five hundred and ninety-six [A.D. 1199]. On the 10th day of the month Zi-'l Hajjah, a Monday, the Holy Im\u00e1ms drank of the sherbet of martyrdom.\n\n\"But God knows best what is the truth.\"*\n\n---\n\n**NOTE ON THE UJATLIQS.**\n\n[In the \"Report of a Mission to Yarkand under Sir D.

It is the only work on P\u00e1li prosody extant, and is founded on the Vrittaratn\u00e1kara (Ocean of Metres), a Sanskrit work on post-vedic metres by K\u00e9d\u00e1ra Bhatta. It contains 136 stanzas or portions of stanzas, divided into six chapters which treat of the following subjects:\n\nChap. I.\u2014The technical terms, and symbols in prosody.\nChap. II.\u2014Metres regulated by time.\nChap. III.\u2014Metres with quarter verses similar.\nChap. IV.\u2014Metres with half lines similar.\nChap. V.\u2014Metres with quarter verses dissimilar.\nChap. VI.\u2014The six problems.\n\nThe work opens with the usual adoration to Buddha. Then follow an explanation of the technical terms, and a description of the various metres in P\u00e1li prosody. In the second, third, fourth, and fifth chapters, each variety is illustrated in its own metre. The sixth chapter enunciates the\nsix problems, and the work closes with a tribute of regard to the author's instructor, S\u012bla Thera.\n\nThe text has been collated from several Burmese MSS. and compared with two other valuable copies, one, a transcript from a Singhalese MS. in the India Office, kindly presented to me in 1870 by the late Professor Childers; the other, a tract, derived from two Singhalese MSS. by Professor Joh. Minayeff, published in 1869 by the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. Mr. Childers' copy has 138 verses, but the last two are merely portions of postscripts to other treatises of the author. Mr. Minayeff's text from wrong numbering has only 119 verses, though the matter forms 136. In this sketch C stands for the first of these, and M for the second.\n\nThere are several P\u0101li commentaries on Vuttodaya, and glosses on the commentaries. It is believed, the following comprise all that are to be met with in Burma.\n\n1. Vuttodaya T\u012bk\u0101, by Nava Vimalabuddhi at Pugan during the reign of the Burman king Kyatsw\u00e1, circa 1212 A.D.\n2. Chandos\u0101rattha, by Sadhamma \u00f1\u00e1na at Pugan during the same period.\n3. Cha-ppaccaya, by the same author.\n4. Vacanatthajotik\u0101, by the same author.\n5. Kavis\u0101ra, by Dhammananda at Pegu during the reign of the Pegu monarch Dhammar\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja, circa 1385\u20141421, A.D.\n6. T\u012bk\u0101, by Buddha\u015b\u0101ta during the same period.\n\nOf these, the three principal commentaries, viz., the second, fifth, and seventh have been consulted, and are referred to under the abbreviations of Chando., Vac., and Kav.\n\nMy grateful acknowledgements must here be made to the subjoined works from which I have derived great assistance; C. P. Brown's Sanskrit Prosody Explained; Weber's Ind. Stud., Vol. VIII; Colebrooke's Life and Essays, Vol. III; and the translation of the Vrittaratn\u0101kara now passing through the pages of the Pandit at Benares.\n\nA table of the prosodial feet is given at page 391, they are denoted in these pages by the initial letter of their symbols in capitals. A single long syllable is marked G, a spondee G\u00e1; a breve is marked L, a pyrrhic L\u00e1.\nTEXT.\n\nNAMO TASSA BHAGAVATO ARAHATO SAMM\u0100SAMBUDDAHASSA.\n\n1. nam' atthu janasant\u0101natamasant\u0101nabhedino,\n   dhamm' ujjalantarucino, munindod\u0101tarocino.\n2.

Praise be to the Chief of Sages, beautifully pure, radiant with the glory of virtue, who dispels the universal ignorance of mankind.\n\n2. The formerly written prosodies of Pi\u1e45gala and others, are not suited to the M\u0101gadha people.\n\n3. Therefore, distinguishing verses measured by feet from those regulated by time, together with the distinctive peculiarities of each, (made into) an understood series of poetry,\n\n4. This Vuttodaya, a collection of secular prosody, I will now commence in the language of the M\u0101gadha people for their instruction.\n\n5. (That foot is called) ma, (the three syllables of which are) all long; (that is) na, (the three syllables of which are) all short; bha, has the first long; ya, the first short; ja, the middle long; sa, the last long; ra, the middle short; ta the last short. These are the eight feet; go (stands for) garu (heavy); lo (for) lahu (light).\n\n6. Be it known that the five feet, bha, ja, sa, ma, na, are used in the Ariy\u0101 and other metres of that class. In that class a foot consists of four syllabic instants (kala).\n\n7. A vowel preceding compound consonants, a long vowel preceding the nigga\u1e47\u1e6d\u1e6dha, and optionally a vowel at the end of a quarter verse are heavy, and indicated by a bent mark; the other, a short vowel, measuring an instant of time, is light, and indicated by a straight mark.\n\n8. Be it known, that a heavy vowel\u2014preceding compound consonants at the beginning of a quarter verse\u2014is sometimes light, as in the subjoined illustration:\n\n   dassanara\u00f1anubhavane nibaddhagedha jinass\u2019 ayam janat\u0101\n   vimhayajanan\u012b sa\u00f1\u00f1ata kriy\u0101 nu kan nanura\u00f1jayate.\n\n9. Be it known, that the terms samudda, usu, rasa and the like, are used in the popular sense; p\u0101da is the fourth part of a verse; yati is verse division.\n\n10. Metre is threefold, either sama, addhasama or visama. That is sama, the quarters of which are similar in character.\n\n11. That is addhasama, which has its first and third, and second and fourth respectively alike. That is visama, which has quarters dissimilar in character.\n\n12. Metres vary in length from one up to twenty-six syllables in a quarter verse.\n\n13. Chants such as the D\u0101\u1e47\u1e0daka, Canda\u1e47vutthi and the like, and metres having three or even six p\u0101das are called \u2018G\u0101th\u0101\u2019 in another work.\n14. Further, in P\u0101li, other kinds of metre, as well as those just spoken of, are comprehended under the general name of G\u0101th\u0101.\n\n15. I will now point out the characteristics of the metres generally used, the names of which are noted herein.\n\n(Here ends) the first chapter giving the general definitions and symbols in prosody.\n\n16. When (in the first half of a stanza) the sixth foot is an amphibrach (J), or a proceleusmatic (NL), and with no amphibrach (J) in the odd feet of the remaining six, together with a final long (G); and when in the second half, the sixth foot is a breve (L) with six other feet, together with a final long quantity (G), the metre is called Ariy\u0101.\n\n17. If the sixth foot of the first half be a proceleusmatic (NL), the pause must be on the first of the four instants; if in the second half, the fifth foot be a proceleusmatic (NL), the pause falls on the last syllable of the fourth foot.\n\n18. A metre possessing the aforesaid characteristics is comprehended under the general name of Ariy\u0101.\n\n19. If the initial p\u0101das of each half verse are restricted by the pause to three feet (i.e., twelve instants), the metre is Pathy\u0101.\n\n20. If the initial p\u0101das exceed three feet, the metre is Vipul\u0101.\n\n21. That is Capal\u0101, in both halves of which the second and fourth foot is an amphibrach (J).\n\n22. That is Mukhacapal\u0101, the first half of which has the characteristics of a Capal\u0101, and the second half those of a Pathy\u0101.\n\n23. That is Jaghanacapal\u0101, the first half of which has the characteristics of a Pathy\u0101, and the second half those of a Capal\u0101.\n\n(Here ends the section on) the Ariy\u0101 class of metres.\n\n24. That is Giti, in which both halves have the characteristics of the first half of the Ariy\u0101, with the pause appropriately placed.\n\n25. That is Upagiti, both halves of which have the characteristics of the second half of the Ariy\u0101.\n\n26. That is Uggiti, which exhibits the halves of an Ariya stanza in inverted order.\n\n27. That is Ariyagit\u012b, the halves of which correspond respectively with the first half of the Ariy\u0101 plus one long syllable at the end.\n\n(Here ends the section on) the Giti class of metres.\n\n28. That is Vet\u0101kya, which has six instants in its odd quarters, and eight instants in the even, followed in each quarter by a cretic (R), and iambic (LG); in the even quarters six breves should not follow consecutively.\n29. That is Opacchandasaka, which has a cretic (R), and a bacchic (Y), following the six instants in the odd, and the eight instants in the even quarters.\n\n30. That is Ap\u00e1talik\u00e1, which has a dactyl (B), and a spondee (G\u00e1) following the six instants in the odd, and the eight in the even quarters.\n\n31. That is Lakkhanantik\u00e1, in the quarters of which an amphibrach (J) constitutes the first four instants.\n\n32. That is Udiccavutti, in the odd quarters of which an amphibrach (J) constitutes the first four instants.\n\n33. That is Paccavutti, in the even quarters of which a long syllable and an amphibrach (GJ) form the first six instants.\n\n34. That is Pavattaka, the odd quarters of which correspond with those of Udiccavutti, and the even with those of Paccavutti.\n\n35. That is Aparantik\u00e1, the quarters of which correspond with the even quarters of Pavattaka.\n\n36. That is C\u00e1ruh\u00e1sini, the quarters of which correspond with the odd quarters of Pavattaka.\n\n(Here ends the section on) the V\u00e9dilya class of metres.\n\n37. That is Acaladhiti, the quarters of which consist of sixteen instants.\n\n38. That is Matt\u00e1samaka, in the quarters of which the ninth instant is a short syllable, and the two last instants a long syllable.\n\n39. That is Visiloka, which has in each quarter after the fourth instant, either an amphibrach (J) or a proceleusmatic (NL).\n\n40. That is V\u00e1nav\u00e1sik\u00e1, which has in each quarter after the eighth instant, either an amphibrach (J) or a proceleusmatic (NL).\n\n41. That is Citr\u00e1, the fifth, eighth, and ninth instants of which are breves.\n\n42. That is Upacitr\u00e1, which has a dactyl (B), and a spondee (G\u00e1), after the eighth instant.\n\n43. That is P\u00e1d\u00e1kulaka, the quarters of which though consistent with the principle of the Matt\u00e1samaka class, contain syllables of mixed quantities.\n\n(Here ends the section on) the Matt\u00e1samaka class of metres.\n\n44. Be it known, that in the Pathy\u00e1 class of metres the difference between the number of the long quantities, and the instants, equals the number of the syllables; the difference between the number of the syllables and the instants, equals the number of the long quantities; half the difference between the number of the short quantities and the instants equals the number of the long quantities.\n\n(Here ends) the second (chapter) describing the metres regulated by time.\nIn the G\u00e1yatti.\n\n45. That is Tanumajjh\u00e1, the quarters of which consist of an antibacchic (T), and a bacchic (Y).\n\nIn the U\u1e47hi.\n\n46. That is Kum\u00e1ralalit\u00e1, the quarters of which consist of an amphibrach (J), an anap\u00e6st (S), and a long syllable (G).\n\nIn the Anuttthubham.\n\n47. That is Citrapad\u00e1, the quarters of which consist of two dactyls (B), and a spondee (G\u00e1).\n48. That is Vijjumm\u00e1l\u00e1, the quarters of which consist of two molossi (M), and a spondee (G\u00e1).\n49. That is M\u00e1navakam, the quarters of which consist of a dactyl (B), an antibacchic (T), and an iambic (LG).\n50.

That is Pam\u00e1\u1e47ik\u00e1, the quarters of which consist of an amphibrach (J), a cretic (R), and an iambic (LG).\n\nIn the Brah\u00e1ti.\n\n52. That is Halamukh\u00ed, which has a cretic (R), a tribrach (N), and an anap\u00e6st (S).\n53. That is Bhujagasusu, which has two tribrachs (N), an in molossus (M).\n\nIn the Panti.\n\n54. That is Suddhavir\u00e1jitam, which has a molossus (M), an anap\u00e6st (S), an amphibrach (J), and a long syllable (G).\n55. That is Papavo, which has a molossus (M), a tribrach (N), a bacchic (Y), and a long syllable (G).\n56. That is Rumnavat\u00ed, which has a dactyl (B), a molossus (M), an anap\u00e6st (S), and a long syllable (G).\n57. That is Matt\u00e1, which has a molossus (M), a dactyl (B), an anap\u00e6st (S), and a long syllable (G).\n58.

That is Ubhb\u00e1sakam, which has an antibacchic (T), a molossus (M), a cretic (R), and a short syllable (L).\nIn the Tu\u1e6d\u1e6dhabham.\n\n61. That is Upatthit\u00e1, which has an antibacchic (T), two amphibrachs (J), and a spondee (G\u00e1).\n\n62. That is Indavajir\u00e1, which has two antibacchics (T), an amphibrach (J), and a spondee (G\u00e1).\n\n63. That is Upavajir\u00e1, which has an amphibrach (J), an antibacchi (T), an amphibrach (J), and a spondee (G\u00e1).\n\n64.

Any metre not noticed here, having quarters dissimilar in character, is comprehended under the generic term G\u00e1th\u00e1.\n\n(Here ends) the fifth chapter describing metres the quarters of which are dissimilar.\n\n128. In the table (representing the various long and short quantities of a metre), set down a quarter verse with quantities all long, below first long a breve, followed by same (as above), preceded by longs, and this is to be repeated until there are all shorts in the row.\n\n129. If the row number of a variation in the table can be halved set down a breve, if being odd a unit is required set down a long quantity.\n\n130. From the first syllable write below each, numbers in progression from one, the sum of the figures beneath the short quantities, plus one, is the indicator.\n\n131. Write units one over another in number equal to the syllables of a quarter verse plus one, let each column be one less in number than the one preceding, let there be a rising from one and so on, the result is all longs and the like.\n\n132. The number of the possible variations of a metre may be determined by the preceding method, or by the one preceding that.\n133. Twice the number of variations in a given metre, minus one, gives the measurement in inches of the long, and the short quantities, and the intervals between them.\n\n(Here ends) the sixth chapter entitled the six problem section of the Vuttodaya composed by Sa\u1e45gharakkhita Thera.\n\n134. To supply a public want, this treatise was prepared under the encouragement of my benevolent preceptor, the venerable Sila Thera, residing at Selantara, to whom I wish every success.\n\n135. In return for this benefit, may I in successive births be a benefactor to others.\n\n136. May mankind attain the fulfilment of their desires as easily as I solved these six problems.\n\nThe Vuttodaya is ended.\n\nNOTES.\n\nNotes on Chapter I.\n\nv. 1. nam\u2019 atthu for namo atthu; odata for avad\u0101ta. \u201cEttha ca pa\u1e6dhama gath\u0101ya parammukhakaram dasseti, sesahi gandh\u0101rambhapall\u0101diket\u0101ni p\u0101ka\u1e6de yeva.\u201d Kav.\n\nv. 2.

The stanza may be freely\ntranslated thus:\n\nFrom the pleasure of seeing and hearing Buddha, springs\na passion never sate.\nWho would not derive pleasure from a study so wondrous and\nsublime?\n\nThe Chando. points out that this couplet illustrates the figure of\nRhetoric called Transition (atthantarany\u0101sa), the introduction of\nanother sense into a subject, (such as a moral reflection).

This chapter describes P\u00e1li metres regulated by time (matt\u00e1-vuti), called J\u00e1ti. They are four in number Ariy\u00e1, G\u00edti, Vet\u00e1l\u00edya, and Matt\u00e1samaka; the second, however, is merely a subdivision of the first. The Ariy\u00e1 class uses feet containing four instants or breves, or their equivalents; namely:\n\n- dactyl ...................... \u2014  _  _  B.\n- amphibrach ...............  _  \u2014  _  J.\n- anapest ....................  _  _  \u2014  S.\n- spondee ....................  \u2014  \u2014  G\u00e1.\n- proceleusmatic ..........  _  _  _  NL.\n\nAny one of these may be used in the even feet, viz., the second, fourth, and sixth. The amphibrach (J) is inadmissible in the odd feet, viz.; first, third, fifth, and seventh. In each half verse, which consists of seven and a half feet, the sixth foot must be an amphibrach, or proceleusmatic, or a single breve. The metres are musical lyric verses. Mr. C. P. Brown in his treatise on Sanskrit Prosody, has pointed out a metre in Horace similar to the Ariy\u00e1, the Ionic a Minore \u201cMiserarum est\u201d &c., (Od. iii. 12). The choruses in the Bacchae of Euripides are principally in this metre.\u00b9 Subjoined is the scheme of the four J\u00e1ti from verse 16 to 43, inclusive.\n\n\u00b9 Walford\u2019s Handbook of the Greek drama, p. 172.\n| I and II.

Stud.*, Vol. VIII, pp. 114 and 332.\n\nIn this class of metres each half line contains sixteen syllables, and two half lines form a couplet. The halves are independent, any one of one metre may be followed by that of another. Each quarter (or p\u00e1da) has eight syllables, the first and third are called odd quarters, the second and fourth even quarters. In each quarter the first and last syllables are free, the others (which in the subjoined table are formed into seats) are subject to rule, namely:\n\n(a.) In the first seat in either quarter any foot is admissible, except the anap\u00e6st (S), and the tribrach (N).\n\n(b.) In the second seat in the odd quarters any foot is admissible.\n\n(c.) In the second seat in the even quarters, no foot is admissible, except the amphibrach (J) or bacchic (Y).\n\n| Odd quarter | Even quarter |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Fre. | 1st Seat. | 2nd Seat. | Fre. | Fre. | 1st Seat. | 2nd Seat. | Fre. | Fre. |\n| Vatta, ................. | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Pathy\u00e1vatta, ........... | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Vipar\u00edtapathy\u00e1vatta, .... | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Capal\u00e1vatta, ............ | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Vipul\u00e1 of Pingala, ...... | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Vipul\u00e1 of Setava, ....... | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Bha-vipul\u00e1, ............ | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Ra-vipul\u00e1, ............. | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Na-vipul\u00e1, ............. | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n| Ta-vipul\u00e1, ............. | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 | C \u2014 \u2014 |\n\nNotes on Chapter 6.\n\nThis chapter enters into the solution of the six problems, (*cha-ppaccaya*) which are as follows:\u2014\n1. To distribute in the form of a table the different quantities in the possible variations of a metre.\n\n2. To determine the structure of a variation, the row number of which is known.\n\n3. To determine the row number of a variation, the structure of which is known.\n\n4. To determine the number of those variations which respectively contain no long quantities, or one long, or two long, and so on.\n\n5. To determine the number of the possible variations of a metre.\n\n6. To determine the space requisite for writing down the possible variations of a metre.\n\nv. 128. *te ca-m-ime*; And these; (three alternations (*vikapp\u00e1*) being understood). This is the reading of the Burmese MSS. \"*te ca ime tayo vidhiyo j\u00e1va sabbalahu go p\u00e1do, t\u00e1va kattabbo.*\" *Vac.* \"*puna lahuto pubbe garu te ca ime tayo vidhiyo sabbal\u00e1 sabbala-hup\u00e1da katabham; athav\u00e1 \u00d7 \u00d7 tato lahuto, garu pubbe pubbat-h\u00e1ne yeva pare panakkhar\u00e1 upari sad\u00eds\u00e1 yev\u00e1ty attho, evam ime akkhar\u00e1 kattabb\u00e1, j\u00e1va sabbal\u00e1 sabbalahup\u00e1dassa avas\u00e1nanti, imas-mim ca vikappe \u201cgarutevamime\u201d ti p\u00e0tho \u201cgaru iti evam ime \u201cti chedo\u201d Kav.*\n\nThis verse describes the mode of arranging in a table, the distribution of the long and short quantities in the possible variations of a metre.\n\nAccording to the rule all long quantities are set down in the first row, in each succeeding row, a short quantity must first be placed beneath the first long of the row above; to the right of such short quantity, must be written quantities similar to those in the row above; to the left of such short quantity, as many long quantities as may be required to fill up the row; and so on until a row of all short quantities is formed. Thus a metre, whose quarter verse consists of one foot, has two variations, a quarter with two, four variations, and a quarter with three feet, eight variations, and so on, the variations increasing in geometrical proportion, as the quarter verse increases in length.\n\n| Row number | The number of variations in a metre having three syllables in each quarter verse |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 2          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 3          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 4          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 5          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 6          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 7          | \u2014                                                                                |\n| 8          | \u2014                                                                                |\n\nv. 129. This rule determines the structure of a variation in the table, the row number of which is known. The *G\u00e1yatti* has quarters of six syllables, let the structure of the tenth row be determined.\nas 10 can be halved set down a breve\nas 5 without an additional unit cannot be\nhalved set down a long,\nas 3 an odd number requires a unit set down\na long,\nas 2 can be halved set down a breve.\nas 1 being an odd number requires a unit\nset down a long,\nas 1 again requires a unit set down a long.\n\nThe structure, then, of the 10th row of the G\u00e1yatti is\n\nv. 130. This rule is the converse of the preceding. Given the structure, to determine the row number. Let be taken as the structure of a variation in a metre having quarters of six syllables. Commencing at the first syllable place under each syllable, numbers in geometrical progression from one, thus:\n\nthe sum of the numbers beneath the short syllables plus one, gives the row number, e.g.: \\(1 + 8 + 1 = 10\\); and we have just seen that this structure corresponds with the 10th variation of the G\u00e1yatti.\n\nv. 131. This rule determines the number of variations containing no long quantity, or one long, or two longs, or all longs. Units are to be placed, vertically one over the other, in succession equal to the number of syllables the metre has in each quarter plus one; thus the G\u00e1yatti having six syllables, seven units are set down vertically one over the other; each succeeding column must be one less in number than the one preceding it; in each of the columns succeeding the first (which all commence with a unit) there is a rising, and in this fashion: after writing the first unit of each column, each following number must be the sum of the number immediately to its left in the preceding column plus all those below that said number; e.g., in the third column, 3 follows the unit being the sum of \\(2 + 1\\) of the preceding column, then follows 6 being the sum of \\(3 + 2 + 1\\), and so on, as in the subjoined table.\n\n1 one row with all long quantities.\n1 6 six rows with five longs.\n1 5 15 fifteen rows with four longs.\n1 4 10 20 twenty rows with three longs.\n1 3 6 10 15 fifteen rows with two longs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 six rows with one long.\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 one row with no long quantity.\n\nv. 132. vemam for v\u00e1 imam.\nThe number of the possible variations of a metre may be determined either, (a) by adding together the top numbers of the columns as shewn in the preceding rule, or (b) by adding together the numbers placed beneath the short quantities plus one, according to the rule in v. 130, e.g.:\n\n(a.) \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\)\n\n(b.) \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 1 = 64\\)\n\nThus 64 is the number of the possible variations of the G\u00e1yatti metre of six syllables in each quarter.\n\nv. 133. This rule lays down the space in inches, that is required for writing down the quantities in the several variations. The inches required must be double the number of variations minus one, thus the G\u00e1yatti having 64 variations would require for each quarter verse \\(64 + 64 = 128 - 1\\), or 127 inches.\n\nv. 134.

Dr.\n\nThe small metrical treatise known by the name of the Jyotisha-ved\u0101nga has attracted the attention of scholars since the first time when Sanskrit literature began to be studied by Europeans. Especially it was the celebrated verses containing a statement regarding the place of the winter-solstice at some ancient, although as it finally has turned out, rather indefinite period, which gave rise to a good deal of comment and speculation. They have been discussed in all their bearings by Sir W. Jones, Colebrooke, Bentley, Davis in the beginning of this century, and were submitted at a more recent period to renewed investigation; it may suffice to refer to Prof. A. Weber's papers on the nakshatras (especially the second one, p. 355), Prof. M. M\u00fcller's preface to the fourth volume of his large edition of the Rik-samhit\u0101, which moreover contains some calculations by Archbishop Pratt and Prof. W. F. Donkin, and the important paper by Prof. Whitney in the first volume (new series) of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, the substance of which is reproduced in the twelfth essay, second series, of his \"Oriental and Linguistic Studies.\" These verses about the places of the winter-solstice, bearing as they do on the question of the chronology of Vedic literature, certainly are the most important of the whole treatise, and may justly claim a much larger amount of interest than we can accord to the remainder of the Jyotisha; nevertheless the Jyotisha being avowedly the oldest Indian work referring to astronomy which has come down to our time, it was highly desirable that we should be enabled, by a publication of the entire work, to judge of its value. This was at last rendered possible by the paper of Prof. A. Weber \"Ueber den Vedakalender, Namens Jyotisham\" published in the transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, 1862; which contains an edition of the complete text based on the comparison of a great number of manuscripts, the gloss on the text by Som\u0101kara, a translation of the text which is founded on Som\u0101kara's explanations as far as these owing to the exceptionally bad state of the manuscripts could be made out, and a very instructive commentary by Prof. Weber himself, in which there is collected a large amount of material from divers sources tending to the elucidation of the obscure verses of the Jyotisha. But in spite of the important step in advance made in Prof. Weber's edition, there remains, as he has himself acknowledged, much to be done before we can claim fully to understand the Jyotisha. The first obstacle in our way is of course the style of the treatise itself with its enigmatical shortness of expression, its strange archaic forms and its utter want of connexion between the single verses. The second ob-\nstacle is, or I should rather be inclined to say, was the extraordinary corruption of all the manuscripts containing Som\u00e1kara's commentary, a corruption extending so far that in more than one passage it is hardly possible to make out even the general drift of the argument (I myself have been able to procure three MSS. in addition to those used by Prof. Weber, but they belong to the same families as his and no additional advantage is to be derived from them). The reason for which I prefer to call this second obstacle a past one lies in my conviction of Som\u00e1kara's commentary being not only of slight value, but, the explanations of a few verses excepted, positively harmful as misleading the student of the Jyotisha and preventing him from having recourse to the only legitimate method of arriving at its true meaning. In fact I consider Som\u00e1kara to have totally misunderstood by far the greater part of the few rules of which the Jyotisha consists. Professor Weber already, in his edition of the Jyotisha, has complained in many places of the want of connexion by which Som\u00e1kara's method of interpretation is characterized and of the strangeness of the results at which we frequently arrive when accepting him for our guide; but I think we may safely go a step farther and, instead of regretting the want of ability on our side to construe Som\u00e1kara's explanations into a consistent whole, reject his explanations just for the very reason that we are unable to elicit a satisfactory sense from them. It appears to me that Som\u00e1kara has grasped the meaning of his text only where it either was impossible to misunderstand it (so f. e. in the introductory verses) or where corresponding passages of the G\u00e1rg\u00ed Samhita assisted him in making out the right meaning (so f. e. v. 9, 10). In these latter cases his gloss certainly has some value, since those parts of Garga's work from which he quotes appear to be lost, or have at any rate not been recovered up to the present time; but with regard to the whole remainder of the Jyotisha\u2014and this remainder forms by far the greater part of the work\u2014his commentary must be declared to be worse than useless. The chief objection to Som\u00e1kara's manner of commenting\u2014an objection which by itself would be sufficient to condemn it\u2014is the complete absence of anything in the way of \"upapatti\" or proof. While every good commentary on an Indian astronomical work, after having explained one of the rules given in the text proceeds to justify it by showing its agreement with the general principles of the system, Som\u00e1kara never makes such an attempt; he simply gives a scanty explanation of the words of the text and then leaves the reader to his own resources. And the explanations which he gives are for the greater part of a very strange nature indeed. Later on, the true explanation of a few passages of the Jyotisha will be given, when Som\u00e1kara's mistakes with reference to these will clearly appear from a mere comparison; I now direct the reader's attention to some verses the right sense of which\nI am indeed unable to point out, but where nevertheless Som\u0101kara's want of understanding is patent. At first however I reprint the text of the Jyotisha, only for convenience's sake, since frequent references to it will be made in the following pages, not with the intention to give it in a purer form than that known up to the present time. A few corrections of the traditional text will be given later on; the necessary critical apparatus for the restitution of those verses which are manifestly corrupt, and for which I am unable to propose emendations, will be found in Prof. Weber's edition. I consider it superfluous to reprint here the different readings of the MSS.; the verses of the Jyotisha are for the greater part of such a nature that the restitution of the single words of the original text can only be accomplished after we have found out by some other means the probable sense of the whole verse. I follow the arrangement of Prof. Weber's edition giving at first those verses which are found in the recension connected with the Yajurveda and then adding these which belong to the Rik recension only.\n\n\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092f\u0902 \u092f\u0941\u0917\u093e\u0927\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0902

Som\u00e1kara's manifestly mistaken explanations alluded to above (the full text of S. will be found in Prof. Weber's edition). V. 21 he explains as stating the length of a tithi; but then a tithi would consist of fifty-six n\u00e1diik\u00e1s only, which duration is much too short (it is of course well known that a tithi in consequence of hr\u00e1sa actually may have that duration; but the knowledge of tithi-vriddhi and tithi-hr\u00e1sa with the reasons on which they depend, is foreign to the Jyotisha). V. 13. According to Som\u00e1kara's explanation the words of this verse would imply that the length of the holy time at p\u00farnam\u00e1s\u00ed which may be employed for sacrifices amounts to 138 n\u00e1diik\u00e1s in case of the parvan taking place in a chatur\u00e1n\u00e1 nakshatra i.e., a nakshatra consisting of four parts. But according to all authorities, and their number is a very great one, that part of the parvan-time which is fit for the offering of the sacrifice, includes only the fifteenth tithi of a paksha and three quarters of the immediately following pratipad, altogether seven quarters of a tithi, while 138 n\u00e1diik\u00e1s exceed even two s\u00e1vana days by eighteen n\u00e1diik\u00e1s. V. 14 would, according to Som\u00e1kara, imply that the last quarter of the fifteenth tithi of a paksha may be used for upav\u00e1sa, i.e., the initiatory rites preceding the performance of the sacrifice; but all teachers are unanimous in assigning to upav\u00e1sa only the three first quarters of panchada\u015b\u00e1 (noticed already by Prof. Weber, p. 54). Of v. 20 Som\u00e1kara gives two wholly different explanations, both equally unsatisfactory and one stultifying the other; the same observation is to be made regarding his interpretation of v. 25. And so throughout the whole commentary. Certainly S. has been unable to throw any light on the most obscure point in the Jyotisha, a point which I regret to say has remained obscure to me also, viz. the true meaning and purport of the an\u015b\u00e1s or parts which are said to belong to the nakshatras and according to the participation in which each individual nakshatra is either dvyan\u00e1 or tryan\u00e1 or chatur\u00e1n\u00e1. S. understands these parts as meant to fix the length of that period at each parvan which admits of being occupied by the parvan-sacrifice and its preparations, but as we have seen above, the results to which this assumption leads him flatly contradict whatever is known about that point from other sources of undisputable authority. I for my part doubt if the an\u015b\u00e1s are in any way connected with the time taken up by the new and full moon oblations, all the more as not a single word in the whole text of the Jyotisha directly points to such a conclusion (the only exception occurs in one of the verses, marked above v. 6\u2014which are found in the Rik-recension only; there we read the word\n\"upavasatha\"). Being, however, unable to replace Som\u00e1kara's explanation by a better one, I should not wish to express more than a doubt.\n\nI now proceed to point out the right meaning of some verses which have not been understood up to the present, preparing my way by shortly recapitulating the fundamental doctrines of the Jyotisha.\n\nThe author of the Jyotisha intends to propound in his treatise the doctrine of the cycle consisting of five years. V. 5:\n\n\"They teach (in this treatise) the knowledge of the time of the cycle consisting of five years which begins with the white half of the month M\u00e1gha and terminates with the dark half of the month Pausa.\"\n\nCompare also v. 1:\n\n\"Praj\u00e1pati, the lord of the cycle, him who consists of five years, &c.\"\n\nThe first question presenting itself, viz. the question about the nature of the year which constitutes the fifth part of the yuga, is answered in v. 28:\n\n\"Three hundred and sixty-six days, one year, six seasons, two ayanas (the northern and the southern progress of the sun), twelve months are to be considered as solar; this taken five times is a cycle.\"\n\nThe year meant is therefore the tropical solar year (of course I do not wish to intimate thereby that the author of the Jyotisha was able to distinguish between the sidereal solar year and the tropical solar year). I add Garga's description of the same year as quoted by Som\u00e1kara in his comment on v. 11 of the Jyotisha:\n\nThe above translated verse of the Jyotisha and this passage of Garga clearly refer to the same kind of year. There appears at first sight to be a difference in their way of subdividing the year, Garga making it to consist of 360 days, while the Jyotisha attributes to it 366. But this is only apparent. The day of which Garga speaks is the solar day of Indian astronomy, i.e., simply the three hundred and sixtieth part of a solar year, no account being taken of the natural succession of day and night. Garga had, before he defined the solar measure, described the s\u00e1vana measure and remarked that one yuga consists of 1,830 s\u00e1vana days; he could therefore afterwards adopt any subdivision of the solar year without the risk of being misunderstood. The Jyotisha on the other hand not having stated before\nhow many s\u00e1vana days there are in a yuga, had, when basing its yuga on the solar year, to explain how many natural days there are contained in the latter. We shall see that the yuga is divided besides into years of a different kind, namely, three lunar years consisting of twelve lunations each, and two lunar years consisting of thirteen lunations each. This division is that actually made use of in the course of the work, but it is of course only a secondary division originating from the wish of establishing an equation between solar and lunar revolutions. The knowledge of the solar year of 366 days, or of the sun's tropical revolution being accomplished in about 366 days, forms the necessary presupposition not only for the yuga of the Jyotisha and Garga with its two intercalary lunar months, but also for the ancient vedic quinquennial yuga with its one intercalary (s\u00e1vana) month. I can therefore not agree with Prof. Weber when he supposes (p. 12) this solar year to be an importation from some foreign country. Both yugas, the vedic as well as that of the Jyotisha, would never have been formed, but for the knowledge of the difference of five years of 360 days and of sixty lunations from the time during which the sun performs five tropical revolutions, and for the resulting wish to make up for the wanting harmony.\n\nTo return to the Jyotisha. The length of the solar year being defined and five years being set down as one yuga, the next question presenting itself is for what reason just this number of years is combined into a cycle.\n\nV. 81, first half:\n\n\"There are (in one yuga) sixty-one s\u00e1vana months, sixty-two lunar months, sixty-seven n\u00e1kshatra months.\"\n\nI.e. While the sun accomplishes five tropical revolutions, the moon accomplishes sixty-two synodical and sixty-seven periodical revolutions, and the whole period comprises sixty-one s\u00e1vana months of 30 natural days each.\n\nI again subjoin the fuller statements of Garga; first, regarding the s\u00e1vana measure:\n\nRegarding the lunar measure:\nAnd about the nakshatra-measure:\n\nThe next thing we want is a statement of the manner in which a day is subdivided. v. 38.\n\n(A nadik\u00e1) consists of ten and a twentieth kal\u00e1s, a muh\u00farta comprises two nadik\u00e1s, a day has thirty (nadik\u00e1s) or six hundred and three kal\u00e1s.\"\n\nWith this we have to combine the statement made in verse 30, that one kal\u00e1 comprises one hundred and twenty-four k\u00e1shthas and that made in v. 39, that one k\u00e1shtha consists of five aksharas.\n\nThe measure of the s\u00e1vana day, expressed in kal\u00e1s, is given already in v. 38; the length of the tithi expressed in the same measure amounts to $593 \\frac{1}{2}$ (1330, the number of s\u00e1vana days in a yuga being multiplied by 603, the number of kal\u00e1s of one day, and the product being divided by 1860, the number of tithis in one yuga). The length of the nakshatra day,\n\n* This verse is restored by conjecture only. The MSS. read: \u092e\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0903 or: \u092e\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0903 Likewise they read in the preceding line: \u0924\u0941 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0940\u092f\u0902 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0923\u0940. The latter has been emended into \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0940\u092f\u0902 by Prof. Weber already who remarks that \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0940\u092f\u0902 is proved from calculation to be erroneous. This is quite true, but it does not go far enough, the length of a nakshatra day not being 112 lavas but $112 + \\frac{1}{2}$ lavas. The only thing which we may confidently look for even in the most ancient astronomical and mathematical works of India, is rigorous exactness in calculations of the above kind (a remark which we shall have to keep in eye in our attempts to reconstrue the meaning of the Jyotisha). Prof. Weber seems inclined to refer the \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930 of our verse to the number of the sidereal months in one yuga. These are sixty-seven indeed; but the mentioning of the number of the months, which can easily be deduced from the stated number of the days, is of much smaller importance than the accurate statement of the length of the day. Thus the number of the lunar months also is not expressly stated by Garga. The corruption of the verse in question being very great the above emendation is of course only one of many we might adopt as far as the mere mode of expression is concerned; the sense would always have to be the same.\nthe thirtieth part of the nakshatra month \u2014 one periodical revolution of the moon, calculated in a corresponding manner, is 549 kal\u00e1s. Let us now compare with this some of Som\u00e1kara's statements. The first half of the obscure verse 21: \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903 he explains as stating the measure of the tithi to be fifty-six n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1s (or 562 4 kal\u00e1s) and the same sense he finds in the first p\u00e1da of v. 39: \u0936\u0924\u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u092a\u092e\u094d \u092e\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u091a\u0948\u0924\u0903, both explanations being founded on his supposing the number seven to mean seven certain divisions of time, which had been mentioned under the name of bh\u00e1n\u00e9sah\u2014parts of a constellation\u2014in verse 15 and were said there to consist of eight parts or according to Som\u00e1kara, eight n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1s. That Som\u00e1kara's estimation of the duration of a tithi is much too short is manifest, and has been remarked by the editor of the Jyotisha already (p. 75); it is in contradiction not only with Garga's statements, as Prof. Weber notices, but with the elements of the Jyotisha itself. It might perhaps be imagined that this estimation refers not to the average tithi but a tithi which is shortened for some special reason; but there is no mention made of such a shortening in any of the other verses of the Jyotisha. Leaving however v. 21 aside, we are able positively to show Som\u00e1kara's mistake regarding v. 39. The words \u0936\u0924\u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u092a\u092e\u094d \u092e\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u091a\u0948\u0924\u0903 he explains by \u0936\u0924\u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u092a\u092e\u094d \u092e\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u091a\u0948\u0924\u0903 \u091a \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u091a \u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0930\u0924\u093f \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093f; according to which we should have to translate \"the moon together with a nakshatra accomplishes a day consisting of seven parts (at 8 n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1s each).\" Now firstly, the measure of a tithi having been fixed, according to Som\u00e1kara, in v. 21 already, it would be utterly useless to repeat this statement here; secondly, it does not appear why the conjunction of the moon with a nakshatra should be mentioned here, the tithi having nothing to do with that matter; thirdly, \u0936\u0924\u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u092a\u092e\u094d cannot well mean \"consisting of seven parts\" but must be explained as \"that which is joined with a septad.\" The right explanation is doubtless as follows: The periodical revolution of the moon is performed in $30 \\times 549 = 16470$ kal\u00e1s (see above); 16470 divided by 27, the number of the nakshatras, gives us 610 kal\u00e1s as the time during which the moon remains in one nakshatra. Now 610 kal\u00e1s exceed by 7 kal\u00e1s the length of a (s\u00e1vana) day which amounts to 603 kal\u00e1s. We have therefore simply to supply a word for day (either from verse 38 Y or from the \"dy\u00fani\" of the second p\u00e1da of 39; I prefer the latter, a different verse preceding v. 39 in the Rik recension) and to translate \"the moon remains in a nakshatra for one day plus seven kal\u00e1s.\" This translation is moreover demanded by the words immediately following: \u091a \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091a \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093f \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f (R. \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0928\u093f) \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903 which undoubtedly state the length of the time during which the sun remains in one nakshatra. The reading of the Rik recension is clearly the right one; for the sun passing through all 27 nakshatras in 366 days remains in one nakshatra.\nexactly $13\\frac{1}{2}$ days. The reading of Y. does not afford any satisfactory sense; it is interesting only as a proof of the heavy corruptions which the text of the Jyotisha has sustained. Som\u00e1kara's explanation of \"uttam\u00e1ni\" is, owing to the bad state of the MSS., unintelligible; but that it cannot have any value appears from his stating that the sun remains in one nakshatra thirteen days only.\n\nI proceed at once to the verse which follows next in the Yajus recension, not because the matter it treats of is akin to that of verse 89, but because it contains a similar dangerous corruption and again illustrates Som\u00e1kara's untrustworthiness. The verse runs as follows:\n\n```\n\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u0928\u0902 \u0928\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e \u091a\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0902 \u0927\u0928\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u0928\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u091a \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902 \u091a \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0936\u0902 \u091a \u0936\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094d\u0965\n```\n\nSom\u00e1kara's commentary on this verse, as far as it can be made out, is as follows:\n\n```\n\u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u092f\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u0924\u0941 \u0936\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d \u091a\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0902 \u0927\u0928\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u092f\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u091a \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902 \u091a \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0936\u0902 \u091a \u0936\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094d\u0965\n```\n\nThe verse clearly contains a rule for finding the relative length of day and night for any nycthemeron during the year. The elements for this calculation are given to us in the well-known verse of the Jyotisha, which fixes the length of the shortest and the longest day of the year (v. 8):\n\n\"The increase of the day and the decrease of the night during the northern progress of the sun is one prastha of water; the reverse is the case during the southern progress; a period of six muh\u00fartas (is the result) during one progress.\"\n\nTherefore, the length of a nycthemeron being 30 muh\u00fartas (see above) the shortest day is twelve muh\u00fartas, the longest eighteen. Reasoning from these data only and not taking into account that in reality the day does not become longer by an equal portion at all times between the winter solstice and the summer solstice, we have the following simple calculation. The day increasing by six muh\u00fartas in one ayana = 183 days, it increases in one day by $\\frac{6}{183} = \\frac{1}{31}$ muh\u00fartas. Therefore, to find the length of any day between the winter solstice and the summer solstice, take the number of this day reckoning from the winter solstice and multiply it by two, divide the product by sixty-one and add the result to twelve, i.e., to the number of muh\u00fartas of the shortest day; the same rule applies to the days after the\nsummer solstice, only the process being presented as additive for all cases\nthe number of the days has not to be reckoned from the past summer\nsolstice, but from the coming winter solstice. From this it appears that\nwe have to read in the second half of the verse \u0928\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d instead of \u0928\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d\nand to translate:\n\n\u201cWhat is passed of the northern progress and likewise what remains\nof the southern progress each (viz. the number of days in both cases) is\nto be multiplied by two, divided by sixty-one and added to twelve; this is\nthe measure of the day.\u201d\n\nI think it unnecessary to enter, after this, on a discussion of Som\u00e1ka-\nra\u2019s explanation; I only remark that here as in other cases he was probably\nprevented from seeing the right meaning of the rule by its very imperfec-\ntion.\n\nThe estimation of the longest day at eighteen muh\u00fartas and of the\nshortest day at twelve muh\u00fartas, and the simple rule for finding the length\nof any day during the year appear to have generally prevailed in India,\nbefore the influence of Greek science began to make itself felt. We find\nthem preserved in the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as, at a time when people very likely might\nhave known better; see, for instance, Wilson\u2019s Vish\u1e47u Pur\u00e1\u1e47a, ed. by F.\nHall, Vol. 2, p. 247. Likewise we meet with them in the chief astronomi-\ncal treatise of the Jainas, the S\u00farapannatti or S\u00faryaprajnapti, a summary\nof whose contents has been given by Prof. A. Weber in the tenth volume\nof the \u201cIndische Studien\u201d. There (pp. 264 ff.) the successive increase\nand decrease of the length of the day by $\\frac{1}{9}$ muh\u00fartas is treated at length\nand explained according to the fundamental principles of the astronomical\nsystem of the Jainas.\n\nI may add here at once, that an identical rule about the increase and\ndecrease of the day is mentioned in Var\u00e1ha Mihira\u2019s Pancha Siddh\u00e1ntik\u00e1 as\ngiven by the Pait\u00e1maha Siddh\u00e1nta. I subjoin in the following the whole\npassage referring to this Siddh\u00e1nta as it is found in the only copy of the\nPancha Siddh\u00e1ntik\u00e1 which is known up to the present time\u2014that one dis-\ncovered by Dr. B\u00fchler\u2014without attempting to emendate the text which is\njust in that place particularly incorrect.\n\n\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0903 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092f\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0926\u093f \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092e\u0939\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u0927\u093f\u0917\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0965\u0967\u0965\n\u0927\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092e\u0915\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0935\u093f\u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0932\u094b\u092d\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0936\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u0927\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092f\u0902 \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0917\u0941\u0923\u0902 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0965\u0968\u0965\n\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092a\u0947\u092f\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u092d\u0947\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0927\u0915\u0947\u0964\n\u0926\u093f\u0917\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926\u093e\u092f\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0927\u0928\u093f\u0927\u093e\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0965\u0969\u0965\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092f\u0926\u093e \u092a\u0930\u092e\u094b\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0932\u093f\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0902 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902\u0964\n\u092c\u0930\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092c\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f \u092a\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0941\u0903\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0947 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u092f\u0902 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0936\u092e\u094d\u0965\u096a\u0965\nAlthough the above passage is so utterly corrupt that it hardly contains one sound word, any body familiar with the text of the Jyotisha Ved\u0101\u1e45ga will not fail to observe that the astronomical book quoted by Var\u0101ha Mihira as Pit\u0101maha Siddh\u0101nta must have been either the Jyotisha itself or a work very much like it. The first of the above verses teaches that five years compose a luni-solar cycle and that to thirty months one intercalary month has to be added. In the second verse it is mentioned that the dyug\u0101\u1e47a of the yuga begins with the light half of the month M\u0101gha. In the third verse Dhanishth\u0101 seems to be named as the first of the nakshatras and the \"saptabhir \u00fanam\" possibly refers to the passage of the Jyotisha which has been treated above \"sasaptakam bhayuk somah.\" The first p\u00e1da of the fourth verse may have to be read: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u0947 \u092a\u0935\u0947 \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0928\u0926\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u0903 and thus we should gain a parallel passage to the second p\u00e1da of v. 17 of the Jyotisha: \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u093d\u092a\u093f \u092a\u0935\u0947 \u0915\u0941\u0932\u0938\u0903 although the sense of both passages is obscure to me. On the other hand there is no doubt that the last verse contains the very same rule for calculating the length of a given day, which we have found in the Jyotisha. The posterior part of the first word we probably have to alter into \u090f\u0915\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094b\u0932\u0924\u0903 (or \u090f\u0915\u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094b\u0932\u0924\u0903), corresponding to the \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u092e\u0924\u0903 of the Jyotisha and to connect with \u092e\u0924\u094d while \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092f\u0902 has to be changed into \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092f\u0902; in the second half-verse we have of course to read \u0926\u093f\u0917\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0930\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0938\u0903. We may then translate\u2014abstracting from an emendation of the second part of \u0917\u0924\u092f\u0941\u0917\u093e\u0923\u093f which seems to contain some word expressing: day \u2014 : what has passed of the northern ayana, taken as positive (or additive; \u0938\u094d\u0935) and in the same way what has passed of the southern ayana, being taken as negative (or subtractive; \u0928\u094d\u092f) is to be multiplied by two and divided by sixty-one; the result is the measure of the day less twelve (i.e., twelve muh\u016brtas have to be added to the result in order to get the measure of the given day).\n\nRegarding the disputed point whether the rule fixing the length of the shortest and longest days of the year has been borrowed by the Indians from some foreign source, for instance from Babylon, or sprung up independently on Indian soil, I am entirely of the opinion of Prof. Whitney who sees no sufficient reason for supposing the rule to be an imported one. It is true that the rule agrees with the facts only for the extreme north-west corner of India; but it is approximately true for a much greater part of India, and that an ancient rule\u2014which the rule in question doubtless is\u2014agrees best with the actual circumstances existing in the North West of India is after all just what we should expect.\nI proceed now to those verses which contain statements about the position of the moon at the different periods of the year. We have at first to consider v. 10.\n\nThis verse contains an enumeration of the nakshatras (or rather of the divinities presiding over the nakshatras) in which the moon stands at the beginning of the ten ayanas of the yuga. The commentator quotes a long passage from Garga which contains the same statements expressed more lucidly and circumstantially, so that no doubt can remain about the real meaning of the verse. The ten nakshatras answering to the divinities enumerated are, according to vs. 32\u201434 of the Jyotisha: \u015br\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101, chitr\u0101, \u0101rdra, p\u016brva proshtapad\u0101, anur\u0101dha, \u0101\u015ble\u015bh\u0101, \u0101\u015bvayuj, p\u016brv\u0101\u015b\u0101dh\u0101, uttara-ph\u0101lgun\u012b, rohi\u1e47\u012b. The editor of the Jyotisha had, in his remarks on our verse (p. 33) expressed his desire of a competent person (viz. an astronomer) examining the statements made in it and ascertaining whether they agree with the actual state of the case. The wished for examination was, on the request of Prof. M. M\u00fcller, made by Prof. W. F. Donkin, and his note on the verse is appended to Prof. M. M\u00fcller's preface to the fourth volume of the large edition of the Rik-Samhit\u0101. The question was, as it appears, hardly of such a nature as to require the skill of a professional mathematician and astronomer; at any rate before asking if the statements of the Jyotisha agree with reality, it ought simply to have been asked if they agree with or are deducible from the elements of the Jyotisha; if this is strictly the case, they will of course participate in the imperfections of these elements and cannot possibly be in perfect harmony with reality. Prof. Donkin naturally proceeded in this manner. Sixty-seven sidereal revolutions of the moon being considered equal to five solar years, one ayana is equal to $6 \\times \\frac{7}{10}$ revolutions of the moon, or $6 \\times 27$ nakshatras plus $\\frac{27.7}{10} = 18 \\frac{9}{10}$ nakshatras. The moon is therefore at the end of each ayana $18 \\frac{9}{10}$ nakshatras in advance of the place she occupied at its beginning, and when examining the list of the twenty-seven nakshatras we find that her places calculated according to this rate of progress agree with the statements made in the Jyotisha and by Garga. As the Jyotisha only speaks of the nakshatras in general without stating in what points of them the moon is supposed to stand, there would seem to remain some space for irregularities in the moon's motion; but against such a supposition may be brought forward at least one of Garga's express statements, viz. that at the beginning of the third dakshin\u0101yana sun and moon stand together in the middle of \u0101\u015ble\u015bha (\u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947\u093d\u092a\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947\u093d\u092a\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f); in the exact middle of that nakshatra the moon can only stand\nwhen the sum of her progress during the five preceding ayanas is equal to \n$5 \\times 18 \\frac{1}{6}$ nakshatras. And the fact of the sum of her progress at the \nend of each period of $2\\frac{1}{4}$ years remaining always the same goes of course \nfar to prove the supposed thorough uniformity of her progress; for what \nshould be the inequalities which regularly disappear or destroy each other \nat the end of the stated period?\n\nWe may therefore assume that the author of the Jyotisha was either \nnot acquainted with the irregularities of the course of the moon which are \ntaken into account by the later Indian astronomers, viz. the irregularities \nproduced by the position and the revolution of the line of apsides of the \nsun and moon, or, at least did not make a practical use of them for his cal-\nculations. Keeping this in view, let us now consider a point which was un-\ndoubtedly of primary importance in the eyes of a vedic Astronomer, viz. \nthe question in which points of the circle of the nakshatras full moon and \nnew moon are taking place during the whole quinquennial cycle.\n\nThe yuga being assumed to contain 67 periodical lunar (n\u00e1kshatra) \nmonths and 62 synodical lunar (ch\u00e1ndra) months, one ch\u00e1ndra month is \nequal to $\\frac{5}{4} = 1 \\frac{1}{3}$ n\u00e1kshatra months. Consequently, the moon pass-\ning in one n\u00e1kshatra month through 27 nakshatras, passes in one ch\u00e1ndra \nmonth through $27 + \\frac{5 \\times 27}{62} = 29 \\frac{11}{62}$ nakshatras and in one paksha (lunar \nhalf-month) through $14 \\frac{1}{3}$ nakshatras. Full moon is therefore always \nseparated from new moon and again new moon from full moon by the last \nmentioned quantity. On this ground I have drawn up the following list \ngiving the places where all the hundred and twenty-four parvans (62 full \nmoons and 62 new moons) of the yuga take place. It begins of course with \nthe new moon marking the beginning of the yuga, which takes place at the \nbeginning of \u00e1ravish\u1e6dh\u00e1 or end of \u00e1rvana. The first column gives the new \nmoons, the second one the full moons.\n\n| 1. | $\\frac{124}{124}$ \u00e1rvana = $\\frac{0}{124}$ \u00e1ravish\u1e6dh\u00e1. |\n| 2. | $\\frac{22}{124}$

the first new moon of the next following yuga.\n\nWe must now look about if there can be found in the Jyotisha itself any traces indicating that its author acknowledged a list of the same nature as that given above. Our attention will naturally direct itself to the enigmatical eighteenth verse which according to the commentator contains an enumeration of the nakshatras in which a certain number of full moons take place. The twenty-seven disconnected syllables of which the verse consists are doubtless meant to represent the twenty-seven nakshatras, each syllable being taken either from the name of the nakshatra itself or from the name of the divinity presiding over it. The following is a list of the nakshatras arranged in the order implied in the verse;\n1. \u00e1\u015bvin\u00ed.\n2. \u00e1dr\u00e1.\n3. p\u00farvaph\u00e1lga.\n4. vi\u015b\u0101kh\u00e1.\n5. uttar\u0101\u015b\u0101dh\u00e1.\n6. uttarabh\u00e1drap.\n7. rohi\u1e47\u00ed.\n8. \u0101\u015ble\u1e63h\u00e1.\n9. chitr\u00e1.\n10. m\u016bla.\n11. \u0101\u015batbhisaj.\n12. bhara\u1e47\u00ed.\n13. punarvasu.\n14. uttaraph\u00e1lga.\n\nFor what purpose now are the twenty-seven nakshatras enumerated in the above order? Som\u00e1kara's commentary on the verse is in all manuscripts so corrupt that it is impossible to give it in extenso or indeed even to make out its drift in many places; it is however apparent what was his view concerning the order of succession of the nakshatras. He supposes that the author of the Jyotisha intended to indicate in what nakshatras the full moons during the quinquennial cycle take place, but, instead of giving the nakshatras for all, only named those of every second full moon. Thus the six first mentioned nakshatras are said to represent six out of the twelve full moons of the first year, the five following ones five of the full moons of the second year, etc. Several of the difficulties arising from this explanation have already been pointed out by the editor of the Jyotisha; the most important is that the number of the full moons of a yuga is sixty-two or at least, if no account be taken of the two intercalary lunar months, sixty, and that we should therefore expect to see the nakshatras of at least thirty full moons stated. But there are other objections of a graver character. For if we compare the places of the full moons which would result from Som\u00e1kara's explanation with the places as given in the list printed above, we find that they agree only for a part. The first full moon-nakshatra of Som\u00e1kara, viz. \u00e1\u015bvin\u00ed (\u00e1svayujau), belonging to the month \u00e1\u015bvina agrees with that given in the list (the ninth); but the second one does not agree, the full moon of the eleventh month m\u00e1rg\u00e1sirsha taking place not, as Som\u00e1kara says, in \u00e1dr\u00e1 but in m\u1e5big\u00e1sirsha. In the same way the full moon of Ph\u00e1lguna takes place not in p\u00farvaph\u00e1lgun\u00ed (bhaga) but in uttaraph\u00e1lgun\u00ed, the full moon of va\u015b\u0101kh\u00e1 not in vi\u015b\u0101kh\u00e1 but in anur\u00e1dh\u00e1, and so on through the whole list. If somebody should object in favour of Som\u00e1kara, that the fault of this discrepancy lies with my list, I should answer him that the onus probandi lies with him; the list is in strict accordance with the recog-\nnised elements of the Jyotisha and as long as no other elements can be pointed out as having been overlooked by me, it must be considered valid. But in reality the list is not only not invalidated, but on the contrary corroborated by the very verse we are speaking of at present. The following short list will set the matter into a clear light:\n\nThe 9th full moon takes place in $\\frac{1}{124}$ \u00e1\u015bvin\u00ed.\n\nThe 18th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{2}{124}$ \u00e1dr\u00e1.\n\nThe 26th full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{3}{124}$ p\u00farvaph\u00e1lg.\n\nThe 35th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{4}{124}$ vi\u015b\u0101kh\u00e1.\n\nThe 43rd full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{5}{124}$ uttar\u0101\u015b\u0101dh\u00e1.\n\nThe 52nd new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{6}{124}$ uttarabh\u00e1rap.\n\nThe 60th full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{7}{124}$ rohi\u1e47\u00ed.\n\nThe 7th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{8}{124}$ \u00e1\u015ble\u015bh\u00e1.\n\nThe 15th full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{9}{124}$ chitr\u00e1.\n\nThe 24th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{10}{124}$ m\u00fala.\n\nThe 32nd full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{11}{124}$ \u015batabhishaj.\n\nThe 41st new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{12}{124}$ bhara\u1e47\u00ed.\n\nThe 49th full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{13}{124}$ punarvasu.\n\nThe 58th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{14}{124}$ uttaraph\u00e1lg.\n\nThe 4th full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{15}{124}$ anur\u00e1dh\u00e1.\n\nThe 13th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{16}{124}$ \u0101rava\u1e47a.\n\nThe 21st full moon \" \" \" $\\frac{17}{124}$ revat\u00ed.\n\nThe 30th new moon \" \" \" $\\frac{18}{124}$ m\u1e5biga\u015biras.\nThe 38th full moon takes place in $\\frac{19}{124}$ magh\u00e1.\n\nThe 47th new moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{20}{124}$ sv\u00e1t\u00ed.\n\nThe 55th full moon, ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{21}{124}$ p\u00farv\u00e1sh\u00e1dh\u00e1.\n\nThe 2nd new moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{22}{124}$ p\u00farvabh\u00e9dr.\n\nThe 10th full moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{23}{124}$ krittik\u00e1.\n\nThe 19th new moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{24}{124}$ pushya.\n\nThe 27th full moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{25}{124}$ hasta.\n\nThe 36th new moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{26}{124}$ jyesh\u1e6dh\u00e1.\n\nThe 44th full moon ,, ,, ,, $\\frac{27}{124}$ \u00e9ravish\u1e6dh\u00e1.\n\nFrom comparing this list with the verse of the Jyotisha, the purport of the latter becomes manifest at once. The list begins with that nakshatra in the first one hundred and twenty-fourth part of which a parvan takes place, proceeds to that in the second $\\frac{1}{124}$ of which the same takes place, and so on up to $\\frac{97}{124}$, so that all nakshatras are comprised in the list. If we turn back to the complete list of all hundred and twenty-four parvans given above, we observe that all the numbers form regular progressions; it was therefore not difficult to lay down a simple rule, teaching at what place in a certain nakshatra parvans would take place after the place of the first parvan had been named. If such a rule is really hidden somewhere in the obscure verses of the Jyotisha, I am unable to say; possibly it might have been left to the ingeniousness of the student to find out the required law. Nor am I able to explain by what principle the author of the Jyotisha was guided in selecting the syllables which represent the names of the twenty-seven nakshatras. Doubtless he had his good reasons for taking sometimes a syllable of the nakshatra's name, and sometimes a syllable of the name of the divinity presiding over the nakshatra, and again for taking either the first or the second or the third, etc., syllables of the names. Som\u0101kara's explanation is corrupt and obscure, and seems besides not entitled to much regard since, as shown above, he is utterly wrong regarding the order in which the nakshatras are enumerated. I will only remark that after it had been ascertained in what part of a nakshatra the parvan takes place, the next important point would have been to find out at what time of the day the half month is finished, for thereon depends the fixing of the time for the\nPossibly the selection of the syllables is connected with this point; I have, however, not succeeded in discovering the exact relation.\n\nProf. Weber raises the question (p. 69) if the verse explained above may be used for deciding whether the series of the nakshatras acknowledged by the author of the Jyotisha begins with Krittik\u00e1 or with \u00c1\u015bvin\u00ed; the explanation given by me precludes of course the question entirely.\n\nFrom the preceding considerations it appears that the author of the Jyotisha must have imagined each nakshatra as divided into one hundred and twenty-four parts. A further argument for this division as well as for a sub-division of the one hundred and twenty parts is to be drawn from the divisions of time which are made use of in the Jyotisha. These latter have been stated above; a nythemeron is divided into thirty muh\u00fartas, a muh\u00farta into two n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1s, a n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1 into ten and a twentieth kal\u00e1s, a kal\u00e1 into one hundred and twenty-four k\u00e1shth\u00e1s, a k\u00e1shth\u00e1 into five aksharas. The great variety of sub-divisions of time employed in Indian astronomical works is well known, the only invariable element appears to have been the division of a day into thirty muh\u00fartas or sixty n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1s. Now, the system of sub-division of the n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1 being left to the choice of the individual astronomers they will naturally have selected those fractions of the n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1 which were to them of the comparatively greatest use in their calculations. What sub-divisions these are depends of course in each individual case on the celestial objects and motions which enter into the astronomer's calculations and on the view he takes of their relative importance. Thus we have seen above from Garga's exposition of the four measures of time that he divided the s\u00e1vana day into one hundred and twenty-four lavas, consequently the n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1 (although the latter is not mentioned in the quoted extracts) into 217 lavas. This division enabled him to express the measure of the s\u00e1vana day, of the tithi and of the solar day without using fractions, the first comprising, as stated, 124 lavas, the second 122, the third 126. And the lava being sub-divided into fifteen parts (\u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0926\u0936\u0935\u093e\u0903 the name of this sub-division is not given) made it possible to express the measure of the n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1 without fractions. An analogous example is the division of one angula into thirty-four tilas, which occurs in Baudh\u00e1yana's Sulvas\u00fatra (see this Journal for 1875) and which enables us to express the relative length of the side and the diagonal of a square without making use of fractions. The same applies to the measures of time used in the Jyotisha. That quite a different value could be attached to the terms \"kal\u00e1\", \"k\u00e1shth\u00e1\", etc., appears among other instances from the passage of Par\u00e1sara quoted by Bh\u00e0ttotpala in his commentary on Var\u00e1hamihira's Brihat Samhit\u00e1, which is referred to by Prof. Weber (p. 105); according to it Par\u00e1sara divided the n\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1 into ten kal\u00e1s, the kal\u00e1 into ten k\u00e1shth\u00e1s, and the\nk\u00e1sth\u00e1 (omitting several intermediate divisions) into eighty nimeshas or aksharas. Other values are given to kal\u00e1, k\u00e1sth\u00e1, etc., in other places.\n\nNow the Jyotisha begins with the apparently very inconvenient division of the n\u00e1dik\u00e1 into 10 $\\frac{4}{5}$ kal\u00e1s. But this division, besides enabling us to express the duration of at least the s\u00e1vana and the n\u00e1kshatra day in whole numbers (603 and 549), allows of our doing the same for the period during which the moon remains in one nakshatra, the length of which period is, as we have seen above, 610 kal\u00e1s. This is of course of primary importance for a work of the character of the Jyotisha which chiefly treats of the moon\u2019s revolution through the circle of the nakshatras. Further we have seen that the nature of the quinquennial yuga necessarily led to the division of each nakshatra into one hundred and twenty-four parts; this division of space suggested in its turn a new division of time, viz. that of the kal\u00e1 into one hundred and twenty-four k\u00e1sth\u00e1s. The moon passing through one nakshatra in 610 kal\u00e1s passes through its hundred twenty-fourth part in 610 k\u00e1sth\u00e1s. At the same time the k\u00e1sth\u00e1 helps us to a convenient expression for another period which is of first rate importance in the system of the Jyotisha, viz. that of the duration of a tithi, 593$\\frac{1}{2}$ kal\u00e1s being equal to 593 kal\u00e1s, 84 k\u00e1sth\u00e1s.\n\nConsiderations of a similar nature lead us to understand the use of the sub-division of the k\u00e1sth\u00e1 into five aksharas. After having established divisions of space and time convenient for expressing the motion of the moon, others were wanted whereby to express the relation of her motion to that of the sun. The moon making sixty-seven revolutions while the sun makes five, the sun passes through $\\frac{67}{5}$ of a nakshatra while the moon passes through a whole one. Now, in order to find an easy expression for this relation, the simplest method would of course have been to divide each nakshatra into sixty-seven parts; but this was no longer possible, the nakshatras being already, for more cogent reasons, divided into one hundred and twenty-four parts each. It was therefore necessary to look out for a sub-division of the one hundred and twenty-four parts of the nakshatra which would make a provision for the above stated want, and the first practicable sub-division which presented itself was that of each one hundred and twenty-fourth part into five parts or of the whole nakshatra into six hundred and twenty parts. For while the moon passes through sixty-seven out of the six hundred and twenty parts, the sun passes exactly through five of them. This sub-division of space again called for a corresponding sub-division of time, and thus the k\u00e1sth\u00e1 was divided into five aksharas. The moon remains in a whole nakshatra 610 kal\u00e1s, in $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a nakshatra 610 k\u00e1sth\u00e1s, in $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a nakshatra 610 aksharas; 8174 kal\u00e1s or k\u00e1sth\u00e1s or aksharas would be the corresponding periods for the sun. Another important advantage of the division of a nakshatra in 620 parts was that it allowed of expressing in\nwhole numbers the space passed over by the moon during one tithi, which amounts to 603 of the 620 parts of a nakshatra. And in the same time, viz. in the duration of a tithi, the sun advanced just forty-five such parts. I will just venture on mentioning that a reference to these forty-five parts is perhaps contained in v. 26. There some manuscripts read not \"navabhir\" but \"navatim\", and Som\u00e1kara explains \"navatibhir\"; if we adopt one of these latter readings, the verse directs us to divide the \"s\u00faryarksha-bh\u00e1g\u00e1n\" by ninety and then to multiply the result by two, which is the same thing as dividing them by forty-five. This is, however, only a conjecture, and I am unable to give a satisfactory translation of the verse.\n\nLet us now turn to the verses referring to the adhim\u00e1sas. The yuga containing sixty-two lunar months to sixty solar months two of the lunar months had to be treated as excessive (adhim\u00e1sa). To this arrangement manifestly refers v. 37, although all its words are not quite clear. The editor of the Jyotisha hesitatingly renders the first word by \"two less\", pointing out at the same time that Som\u00e1kara seems to explain \"dvi\" by \"dinam\" (the words of the latter are: \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0928 \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915 \u0926\u093f\u0928\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0928\u0947\u0928 \u092d\u093e\u0917\u0947\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u092e\u094d); the latter explanation really appears to be the right one. That the word \"dvi\", strange as it may appear, is used in the sense of \"day\" in several passages of the Jyotisha cannot be doubted (cf. p. 5 of Prof. Weber's edition), and if we take it in that sense, the verse may be translated as follows: \"a day diminished by its sixty-second part is to be deducted from the sun (the solar measure), etc.\" A (s\u00e1vana) day of 603 kal\u00e1s diminished by its sixty-second part (9 4/4) equals 593 4/4 kal\u00e1s, which is the length of a tithi, and thirty solar days being equal to thirty-one tithis, the verse apparently states in what manner the difference of solar and lunar time sums itself up. The word \"sap\u00e1rvapam\" or \"saparvan\u0101\u1e25\" must therefore express in some manner the period during which the mentioned difference amounts to one tithi; it may perhaps be translated \"at each parvan\", parvan denoting either the new moon parvan or the full moon parvan only. (Prof. Weber is inclined to refer the \"dvi\" in dv\u00fd\u00fan\u0101m to the two lavas which constitute the difference between Garga's lunar day and s\u00e1vana day; but this is impossible for two reasons; firstly, the division of the day into lavas is not made use of in the Jyotisha, and secondly, the difference necessitating the establishment of two adhim\u00e1sas is not between lunar time and s\u00e1vana time, but between lunar time and solar time, 1860 tithis being equal to 1800 solar days). The second half of the verse presents no difficulties produced by which there are formed in addition two excessive months in the middle and at the end (of the yuga).\" The thing was therefore managed in this way that the thirty-first and the sixty-second lunation of the yuga were not counted but combined with the following ones into one month. It is well known that the advanced Indian astro-\nnomy of a later period effects the agreement between lunar and solar time in a similar way; basing however on more exact data regarding the revolutions of the sun and the moon it does of course not pass over every thirty-first lunation.\n\nTo the question about the adhim\u00e1sa another verse of the Jyotisha also seems to refer, viz. verse 12, of which Som\u00e1kara gives a very peculiar explanation, founded on his view of the meaning of the word p\u00e1da.\n\nThe latter he supposes to signify the fourth part of the time which is required for the performance of the dar\u015bap\u00far\u1e47am\u00e1sa sacrifices and which, according to him, is itself called \"parvan\" in different places of the Jyotisha; the duration of this fourth part is thirty-one, viz. n\u00e1dik\u00e1s. The sense of the verse is therefore, according to him, as follows \"if the parvan (the lunar half month) is diminished, (the diminution) is in (i.e. does not exceed) a p\u00e1da, i.e. the time of thirty-one n\u00e1dik\u00e1s.\" By this diminution he seems to understand the difference of s\u00e1vana and lunar time. But, as Prof. Weber has already pointed out, a statement of this nature would be perfectly useless, since the difference between the two measures during a lunar half month amounts to $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a s\u00e1vana day only and therefore of course does not exceed 31 n\u00e1dik\u00e1s, being in fact less than half that amount. Prof. Weber would therefore prefer to take parvan as meaning the whole lunar month; but even on this supposition the statement of the verse would be of a strange indefiniteness; why say that the difference between lunar and s\u00e1vana time in the course of one lunar month amounts to less than $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a s\u00e1vana day when it actually amounts to $\\frac{1}{8}$ and when it was very easy to calculate the latter exact amount from the fundamental data of the Jyotisha? Besides, it appears to me that we have no right at all to supply the word n\u00e1dik\u00e1 in this verse as well as in many other verses where Som\u00e1kara makes use of it. It seems to me that the simplest explanation of the verse would be the following \"if a parvan is to be deducted (for the sake of establishing harmony between lunar and solar time) it is to be done at a quarter (viz. of all parvans); and such a quarter comprises thirty-one (viz. parvans, the whole yuga containing one hundred and twenty-four parvans).\" So that the verse is only another statement of the fact that each sixty-second lunar month is to be left out i.e. not to be counted. I pass at once to v. 30, where the word p\u00e1da again occurs (in the compound catushp\u00e1di). The verse states the number of the sub-divisions of the yuga according to the different measures of time. The first quarter of the verse is obscure in spite of Som\u00e1kara offering an explanation. He combines the two first p\u00e1das and interprets them as follows:\n\n\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0902 \u091a\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0935\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0903 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092e \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092e \u092f\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u0940\u092f\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e\u0947\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0964 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0907\u0924\u093f \u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0924\u093f \u092f\u0925\u093e\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d\n\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092e \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n21\nThat by \"ayan\u00e1ny rish\u0113h\" we have to understand sidereal (n\u0101kshatra) half months (so called from analogy to the ayanas of the sun) cannot be doubted; but it is impossible to state their number as being either one hundred and thirty-five or one hundred and thirty-four, since the yuga always contains sixty-seven n\u0101kshatra months only. The admission of an alternative between the two numbers would in fact be subversive of the whole system of the Jyotisha. I am not able myself to give a satisfactory explanation of the first p\u00e1da, but at any rate the second p\u00e1da must be separated from it and translated: the ayanas of the moon i.e. the sidereal half months are one less (viz. than one hundred and thirty-five) i.e. one hundred and thirty-four. When we come to read after this something about parvans, we naturally expect a statement of their number too, and I think that the third p\u00e1da means nothing else than \"the parvans are a tetrad of p\u00e1das\", i.e. (a p\u00e1da having been said above to be equal to thirty-one) are one hundred and twenty-four in number; which agrees of course with the datas of the Jyotisha. Prof. Weber takes parvan in this passage as meaning the holy time at each parvan and p\u00e1da as meaning the fourth part of that time, equal to thirty-one n\u0101dik\u00e1s (in accordance with Som\u00e1-kara's explanation of v. 12) and translates: the parvans have four quarters, i.e. last 124 n\u0101dik\u00e1s; but this interpretation is certainly less simple than the one given above and is not even countenanced by the commentator, whose remarks on the passage are: \u092a\u093e\u0926\u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902 \u091a\u0948\u0915\u0947\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0938\u0947\u0935\u093e \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u0926\u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902 \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926\u0940\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u092a\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0903\u0964 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u091a \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0925\u093e \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\nI have to add only two short remarks. In v. 5 (of those verses which are found in the Rik-recension only), we must read \u092a\u094c\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0903 \u091a \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0903 \u091a \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0903 instead of \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0903. The verse contains a statement of the dates of the equinoxes during the five years of the yuga, and a calculation of these dates according to the elements of the Jyotisha shows the necessity of the emendation. V. 16 contains the words \u092a\u094c\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0903 \u091a\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 which Som\u00e1-kara explains by \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0903 \u091a\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947. There is, however, no authority for taking the word \"Paulastya\" to be a name of the moon, while Pulastya is mentioned as father of Agastya in the Vish\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47a. The star Agastya (Canopus) is, as it is well known, frequently mentioned in the earliest Indian astronomical treatises, and, as it is visible in Northern India only during a part of the year, the verse of the Jyotisha seems to state that something\u2014although it is obscure what\u2014is taking place during that part of the year in which Agastya is not visible.\n\nA great part of the Jyotisha remains unexplained; vv. 11, 13\u201417, 19\u201423, 25\u201427, 29, 41 especially are still quite obscure in spite of Som\u00e1-kara's attempts at elucidation. It may be expected that, should the corresponding parts of the Garga-samhit\u0101 be recovered, light would fall from\nthem on the obscurities which baffle us at present. I do not however think that anything new would be added to our knowledge of the elements of the Jyotisha. The latter seem to contain nothing but the doctrine about the yuga consisting of a certain number of months of the different kinds, the statement regarding the coincidence of the yuga's beginning with the winter solstice and the new moon of M\u00e1gha, the new moon taking place in the first point of \u015bravish\u1e6dh\u00e1, and the rule stating the duration of the longest and shortest days together with the regular increase and decrease of the day during the whole year. All the remainder of the Jyotisha apparently contains nothing but deductions from these elements and is therefore of a secondary interest only.\n\n---\n\nTranslations from the \u1e24amdesh and the Agh\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2014By C.

The Ben\u016b M\u0101zin and the Bennu-l-'Amber (or Bel-'Ambar) were both sub-tribes of Tem\u012bm. \u1e0cuhl son of Sheyb\u0101n was the family name of a great sub-division of the tribe of Bekr son of W\u0101'il.\n\n\"The Child of the Dust,\" el-laq\u012b\u1e6dah, that is, a foundling: the mother of the tribe of \u1e0cuhl appears to be meant, but the commentators give no very certain information on the point. Another reading is eah-Shaqlqah, the name of the mother of a family in \u1e0cuhl.\n\nv. 8. \"Strike swiftly and hard,\" shaddu-l-i\u011fh\u0101rat\u0101: another reading is shennu-l-i\u011fh\u0101rat\u0101, \"pour down on their enemies from every side.\" This verse is the locus classicus for the use of the proposition bi in the sense of \"instead of\": a sense arising out of its use with verbs of paying, buying, &c., for the price; and that again arises out of one of its original senses, that of the instrument.\n\nII, III, IV, and V, four songs of the Ben\u016b-l-H\u0101rith ibn Ka'b.\n\nThe Ben\u016b-l-H\u0101rith ibn Ka'b dwelt in Nejr\u0101n, a fertile valley of el-Yemen; they were the chiefest of the tribes of Ma\u1e0d\u1e25ij (although probably themselves of Ma'addic origin*), and in the time of the Prophet were the acknowledged leaders of that stock.\n\n* This would appear from a poem in the \u1e24am\u0101sah (pp. 160-1, Freytag's Edn.), where a man of 'Abs claims the Ben\u016b-l-H\u0101rith as his brothers; but the author of the Agh\u0101n\u012b, in the genealogies he gives of H\u0101rithis, knows only their traditional descent from Kahl\u0101n.\nAbout half the tribe were Christians, and maintained their faith stoutly against the proselytising Jew King of el-Yemen, D\u016b-Nuw\u0101s, who in 523 A.D. led an army against the city of Nejran and besieged it. The story of the Martyrdom of the Christians of the Benu-l-H\u0101rith will be found told by a contemporary writer, Simeon the Syrian bishop of Beth-Araham, in Vol. I of Assemani\u2019s Bibliotheca Orientalis, pp. 359 sqq.;* their prince is therein called H\u0101r\u0113th bar K\u0101leb, who with his wife R\u016bma suffered death for the faith, and has become known in the Church as S. Arethas the son of Caleb; it seems probable that \u201cH\u0101r\u0113th son of K\u0101leb\u201d is really the tribal name, el-H\u0101rith ibn Ka'b; in Syriac the \u2018syn of Ka'b and the ldm of K\u0101leb differ only in size. The sequel of this deed of D\u016b-Nuw\u0101s is well known; the rule of the Himyarites in el-Yemen was overthrown by the Abyssinians under Ary\u0101t, sent by the king of \u1e62\u0113thiopia at the instigation of the Emperor of Constantinople to avenge the slaughter of the Christians of Nejran. The Christian Church at Nejran was still flourishing in the time of the Prophet, who in the ninth year of the Hijrah was visited at el-Med\u012bnah by a deputation of forty ecclesiastics (ab\u0101d\u0101r), headed by a bishop, and twenty laymen from that place. The conversation, which ensued is told in the Agh\u0101ni, X, 144; in the end the Christians of Nejran obtained from Mohammed a treaty securing to them, on the payment of tribute, the free exercise of their religion, and the portion of the tribe which had remained pagan in the same year gave in its adhesion to el-Isl\u0101m. The treaty with the Christians was renewed by Ab\u016b-Bekr after the death of Mohammed, but \u2018Omar, in pursuance of the Prophet\u2019s dying injunction that none but Muslims should be left to dwell in Arabia, removed them to Syria, where they received lands in exchange for those they surrendered in Nejran. (A.H. 13.)\n\nThe most noble family of the Christian H\u0101riths was the house of ed-Dayy\u0101n, to which belonged the author of the fourth of the pieces given below. The son of ed-Dayy\u0101n was \u2018Abd-el-Mad\u0101n, who had three sons, Ye\u1e63id, \u2018Abd-el-Medh, and Qeys. Ye\u1e63id was one of the most noble and generous Arabs of his day; and \u2018Abd-el-Medh and Qeys were two of the leaders of the deputation which visited Mohammed in A.H. 9. The three brothers built a church (\u1e25i\u02bf\u0101k) or, as some say, set up a great tent made of three hundred skins of red leather (one of the chief products of el-Yemen), at Nejran, which was called \u201cthe Ka'bah of Nejran\u201d; it was a sanctuary where all who were in need found help and refuge. All three were friends and patrons of Meym\u016bn el-A'\u1e25\u0101, who praises them in his poems, and learned from them the many Christian precepts which occur in his verse.\n\n---\n\n* The latest contribution to the history of the persecuted Monophysite Christians of Nejran will be found in the Zeitsch. d. Deutsch. Morg. Gesellsch., Vol. XXXI, p. 360. A Syriac letter of comfort addressed to them by Jacob of Sar\u016bg, exhorting them to patience and faith under their trials, is there given with a translation and commentary by Dr. R. Schr\u00f6ter, who has added a Syriac version of a Greek hymn by Johannes Psaltes, Abbot of Beth Aphthonius, on the subject of the martyrdom of those slain by D\u016b-Nuw\u0101s. The latter must have been composed within a year or two of the event; for it was translated from Greek into Syriac by Bishop Paul of Edessa, who died in 527 A.D. From it we learn (1) the name of the Jew-king, who is called Masr\u016bq, the same in Syriac as D\u016b-Nuw\u0101s in Arabic (\u201cLong-locks\u201d); (2) the number of the slain, something over two hundred; and (3) the name of their teacher, H\u0101r\u0113th.\n\nDr. Schr\u00f6ter has not referred to the \u1e62\u0113thiopic poems in which the constancy of the martyrs of Nejran is praised.\n\u2018Abd-Yagh\u00fbth, as his name shows, was of the pagan H\u00e2rith\u00ees; the idol Yagh\u00fbth (\"the Helper\") is mentioned with Ya\u2018\u00fbq and N\u00fbr in v. 23 of the 71st S\u00fbrah of the Qur\u2019\u00e2n: all three were worshipped by the Arabs of el-Yemen. The author of the second and third pieces, Ja\u2018far son of \u2018Olbeh, was the great-grandson (Agh\u00e2ni XI, 146) or great-great-grandson (Agh. XV, 78) of \u2018Abd-Yagh\u00fbth. Much uncertainty prevails regarding the date of his death. The Agh\u00e2ni calls him \"a mukhadrim of the two Rules,\" that is, a poet who flourished under both the houses of Umayyeh and el-\u2018Abb\u00e2s; according to this work (where several differing versions of his story are given) he was slain at Mekkeh in the reign of el-Mans\u00fbr Ab\u00fb Ja\u2018far (A. H. 136\u2014158). But in the commentary on the Ham\u00e2seh by el-Tebriz\u00ee he is said to have been put to death in the Khalifate of Hish\u00e2m son of \u2018Abd-el-Melik the Umawi (A. H. 105\u2014125). The \"Day of Sah\u00e2b\u00e2l\" was the adventure which led to his death: to avenge an insult put upon him by the Ben\u00fb \u2018Oqeyl, he made a raid upon them, and was returning with his booty when he was beset by the \u2018Oqeyl\u00ees in the valley of Sah\u00e2b\u00e2l. He fought his way through them and escaped; but having slain one of the \u2018Oqeyl\u00ees, that tribe accused him of murder before the Khalifeh\u2019s Governor at Mekkeh, who, after vain attempts to save his life, was obliged to deliver him up to his accusers, who put him to death.\n\nThe date of the Day of el-Kul\u00e2b is fixed by Caussin de Perceval as A. D. 612.\n\nII.\n\nThe death-song of \u2018Abd-Yagh\u00fbth, chief of the Ben\u00fb-l-H\u00e2rith ibn Ka\u2018b of Nejran. (Agh\u00e2ni XV, 75-76).\n\nAfter the slaughter of their fighting-men by the Governor of Kisr\u00e2 at el-Mushaq-qar, the Ben\u00fb Tem\u00eem withdrew from el-Bahr\u00e2n to the valley of el-Kul\u00e2b, near the great waste called ed-Dahn\u00e2, south of el-Yem\u00e2neh. Their helpless state there moved the covetousness of the people of el-Yemen, and all the tribes of Ma\u1e0d\u1e25ij gathered together to plunder them. But warning was brought to the people of Tem\u00eem, and they arrayed themselves for battle; and the fight lasted the whole day long, until night parted them. And they watched one another through the night, and at dawn went forth again to battle. Then the fury of the men of Tem\u00eem prevailed, and those of Ma\u1e0d\u1e25ij were driven in headlong rout; and many a chief was slain, and many a footman taken captive. \u2018Abd-Yagh\u00fbth was the leader of Ma\u1e0d\u1e25ij on that day: he too was taken captive, and \u2018Ismeh son of Ubeyr of Teym carried him to his house, where they made ready to slay him in requital for the death of en-No\u2019m\u00e2n son of Jess\u00e2s, the leader of Tem\u00eem, who had fallen in the first day\u2019s fight. And they feared lest he should utter satires against them, and make them a by-word among the Arabs; therefore they were about to gag him, when he promised that he would utter no word of reviling against them: so they left his tongue free. Then said he\u2014\"O ye sons of Teym, let me die as befits one noble.\" \"And how wouldst thou die?\" asked \u2018Ismeh. \"Give me wine to drink, and let me sing my death-song.\" \"So be it,\" said \u2018Ismeh; and he plied him with wine, and cut one of his veins, and left him until the blood all flowed forth from his body. And as his life ebbed, \u2018Ismeh\u2019s two sons who stood by began to upbraid him: \"Thou didst gather together against us all el-Yemen,\" said they: \"but now behold how God has dealt with thee.\" Then said \u2018Abd-Yagh\u00fbth\u2014\n\n\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0651 \u062a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0643\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\nUpbraid me not, ye twain! shame is it enough for me\nto be as I am: no gain in upbraiding to you or me.\nKnow ye not that in reproach there is little that profits men?\nIt was not my wont to blame my brother when I was free.\nO rider, if thou lightest on those men who drank with me\nin Nejr\u00e2n aforetime, say\u2014'Ye shall never see him more!'\n\u2014Ab\u00fb Ker\u00eeb and those twin el-Eyhem, the twain of them,\nand Qeys of el-Yemen who dwells in the uplands of Hadramaut.\nMay God requite with shame my people for el-Kul\u00e2b\u2014\nthose of them of pure race, and the others born of slaves!\nHad it been my will, there had borne me far away from their horse\na swift mare, behind whom the black steeds lag in a slackening\nthrong:\nBut it was my will to shield the men of your father's house,\nand the spears all missed the man who stood as his fellows' shield.\nThe matron of 'Abd-Shems laughed as she saw me led in bonds,\nas though she had seen before no captive of el-Yemen:\nBut one knows\u2014Muleykeh my wife\u2014that time was when I stood forth\na lion in fight, whether men bore against me or I led on.\n\nI said to them when they bound my tongue with a leathern thong\n\u2014'O kinsmen of Teym, I pray you, leave me my tongue yet free!\n'O kinsmen of Teym, ye hold me fast: treat me gently then;\n'the brother ye lost was not the equal in place of me.\n'And if ye must slay me, let me die at least as a lord;\n'and if ye will let me go, take in ransom all my wealth.'\nIs it truth, ye servants of God\u2014I shall hear no more the voice\nof herdsmen who shout for their camels in the distant grazing-\ngrounds?\n\nYea, many a beast did I slay, and many a camel urge\nto her swiftest, and journey steadfast where no man dared to go;\nAnd oftimes I slew for my fellows my camel at the feast,\nand oftimes I rent my robe in twain for two singing-girls,\nAnd oftimes withstood a host like locusts that swept on me\nwith my hand alone, when all the lances on me were turned.\nNow am I as though I never had mounted a noble steed,\nor called to my horsemen\u2014'Charge! give our footmen breathing-\nspace!'\nOr bought the full skin of wine for much gold, or shouted loud\nto my comrades stout\u2014'Heap high the blaze of our beacon-fire!'\n\nNotes.\nThe metre is the Taw\u00eel, second form.\n\nv. 4. Of the persons mentioned in this verse Ibn-el-Ath\u00eer (K\u00e2mil, Vol. I,\np. 469) says that Ab\u00fb-Ker\u00eeb was B\u00eeahr son of 'Alqameh son of el-H\u00e2r\u00eeth, while the two\nel-Eyhem (Eyhem means foolish, stupid, and was given as a nickname to many people:\ntwo kings of Ghass\u00e2n bore it) were el-Aswad son of 'Alqameh son of el-H\u00e2r\u00eeth, and\nel-'\u00c2q\u00eeb (the chief, lord), whose full name was 'Abd-el-Mas\u00eef son of el-Ab\u00eeyad; Qeys\nwas Qeys son of Ma'd\u00ee-Ker\u00eeb. Of these the last was chief of the tribe of Kindeh, and\nwas surnamed el-'Ashaj\u00ee, \"the Scarred\"; he was praised by el-A'\u00e2h\u00e2. El-'\u00c2q\u00eeb and\nel-Aswad el-Eyhem were two leaders of the deputation from Nejr\u00e1n to Mohammed at\nel-Med\u00eenah in A. H. 9. Of the first I have been able to discover nothing further.\n\nv. 6. This verse is variously given. Ibn-el-Ath\u00eer (i.e.) reads\u2014\net-Tebrizi, in his commentary on the Hamaseh (p. 298), quotes it thus:\n\nCaussin de Perceval (Essai, ii. 589), apparently following the Kitab-el-Iqd, reads\u2014\n\nThe first and second readings in the first hemistich give shafbeh, a mare light of flesh and active, instead of our nahdah; the third gives mukrah, a young mare; in the second hemistich, instead of our el-humw-el-jiyad, \"the noble black horses,\" Ibn-el-Athir reads \"the noble (itadg) bayz,\" et-Tebrizi, \"the noble short-haired steeds\" (jird), and C. de Perceval \"the beautiful short-haired steeds.\" As the last word of the verse tawdliyd (plural of taliyeh, \"following\") is decidedly best; mawdliyd, C. de P.'s reading, seems to be a word-play on the reading itadg, since it means slaves in opposition to free-born (itadg): such a play is foreign to old Arab verse. El-tall is a special word used for the fourth horse in a race where ten run, and thus appropriately describes the place of the pursuers.\n\nv. 7. Dimar has the same meaning as hagiqah, viz., the persons whom it is one's duty to defend. I am somewhat doubtful of the rendering of the second hemistich of this verse. I have taken yekhtatina as meaning \"missed,\" which is apparently a possible sense; but it may also mean \"carried away, suddenly took possession of,\" and may refer to his having been taken prisoner while he covered the retreat of his tribe.\n\nv. 8. \"Of 'Abd-Shems,\" that is, descended from 'Abd-Shems, son of Sa'd, son of Zeyd-Menat, son of Temim.\n\nv. 10. \"Teym.\" This family did not belong to Temim, but was one of the Ribat, or five confederate tribes, whose fortunes were at this time linked to those of Temim: the five were Dabbah, Teym, 'Adi ibn 'Abd-Menat, 'Okl, and Thaur; they were all descended from Udd, son of Tabikkah son of Ilyas. Teym is probably shortened for Teym-el-Lat (\"servant of el-Lat\") a name borne by many of the Arab families, which Mohammed changed into Teym-allah (\"servant of God\").\n\nv. 12. The last words of the second hemistich (tahrubuni bimdliyd) may be more literally rendered \"depoil me of all my wealth.\"\n\nv. 13. \"Ye servants of God,\" itadda-llahi: there is reason to suspect that this has been altered from 'ibada-llati, \"servants of el-Lat,\" which would be a paraphrase of the name of the tribe he was addressing, Teym-el-Lat. El-mutall, plural of el-mutll, means \"she camels having their young ones following them\"; mo'xibbn is \"driving camels to distant pastures.\"\n\nv. 17. Rijil is here a plural of rdjil, a foot soldier, not of rajul, a man.\n\nv. 18. \"Comrades stout,\" eydru qidgin: eydru are companions gathered together for the arrow-gambling called el-Meysir; this was played in the winter time, and by men sitting over the fire at night; the call to heighten the blaze was in order that the fire might be more conspicuous to the night-wanderer seeking for a shelter.\nAlas for Qurr\u00e0 Sahbal! the day that upon us drove\nthe crowd of frightened women, and the foemen pressed us sore.\nThey said to us\u2014'Two things lie before you: now must ye choose\u2014\n'the points of the spears couched at you, or, if ye will not, chains.'\nWe answered them\u2014'Yea, this thing may fall to you after fight,\n'when men shall be left on ground and none shall arise again;\n'But we know not, if we quail before Death's oncoming,\n'how much may be left of life; the goal is too far to see.'\n\nWhen we strode to the strait of battle, there cleared us a space around\nthe white swords in our right hands which the smiths had fur-\nbished fair;\nTo them fell the edge of my blade on that day of Sahbal dale,\nand mine was the share thereof wherever my fingers closed.\n\nNotes.\n\nThe measure is the second form of the Tawil.\n\nThis poem, if we may trust the account of the adventure to which it relates given\nin the Agh\u00e1n\u00ed, has been manipulated by Ab\u00fa Temm\u00e1m; as given in the Ham\u00e1seh, it\nsuggests an attack by the enemy on the tribe of the poet, a sudden surprise, with terri-\nfied women and few men to withstand a threatening foe; but as the tale is told by el-\nIsfah\u00e1n\u00ed (Agh. XI, 147), Ja\u2018far with two companions went forth to plunder the herds\nof \u2018Oqeyl, and was beset on his way back by detached parties of that tribe in the valley\nof Sahbal, whom he overcame and reached home safe. Another version of the poem\nis given in the Agh\u00e1n\u00ed which contains many more lines than that in the Ham\u00e1seh, and\nsome notable differences in those which are common to both; it is not necessary to\ngive here the lines by which the Agh\u00e1n\u00ed exceeds the Ham\u00e1seh: but the differences\nmay be briefly stated. v. 1 is in the Agh\u00e1n\u00ed\u2014\nThis reading (which follows an introductory verse) avoids the difficulty caused by the word *al\u0101h* (\"alas\") in the Ham\u0101seh's version; the poem is one of exultation: why should it open with \"Alas!\"? It also, instead of *el-wel\u0101ya*, \"the weak and frightened women,\" gives *es-sar\u0101ya*, \"the troops of horse,\" and instead of the difficult name Qurr\u0101, reads *qarnay*, \"the two horns\" (that is, probably, the two mountain peaks between which the valley of Sahbal lay). The verse may be rendered\u2014\n\n\"That even when under Sahbal's twin peaks upon us drove\nthe horsemen troop after troop, and the foemen pressed us sore.\"\n\nv. 2 is exactly the same in the Agh\u0101n\u012b. So is v. 3, except that in the second hemistich for *naw\u016bh\u0113* the Agh\u0101n\u012b reads *nahquh\u0101*, a word of the same meaning. v. 4 does not occur at all in the Agh\u0101n\u012b's version. v. 5 is the same in both as to the second hemistich, but the first in the Agh\u0101n\u012b is\u2014\n\n\"Their ambush beset our road, but there cleared us a space around\nthe white swords in our right hands which the smiths had furbished fair.\"\n\nv. 6 is the same in the Agh\u0101n\u012b and the Ham\u0101seh.\n\nIV.\n\nThe same, in ward at Mekkeh.\n\nMy longing climbs up the steep with the riders of el-Yemen\nby their side, while my body lies in Mekkeh a prisoner.\nI marvelled as she came darkling to me and entered free,\nwhile the prison's door before me was bolted and surely barred.\nShe drew near and greeted me: then she rose and bid farewell;\nand when she turned, my life wellnigh went forth with her.\nNay, think not that I am bowed by fear away from you,\nor that I tremble before the death that stands so nigh,\nOr that my soul quakes at all before your threatenings,\nor that my spirit is broken by walking in these chains;\nBut a longing has smitten my heart born of my love of thee,\nas it was in the days aforetime when that I was free.\n\nNOTES.\n\nThe measure is the same as in Nos. II and III.\nThis piece is given with almost the same text in the Agh\u00e2ni, XI, 149; the latter, however, begins it with the second verse of the Ham\u00e2seh's version, putting the verse which in it answers to the first last; this is\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064f

verse between vv. 4 and 5 of the Ham\u00e2seh's version; this is, however, clearly intrusive, and breaks the sequence of the thought: it is therefore not quoted here.\n\nV.\n\n'Abd-el-Melik son of

shame,\nwhatso be the raiment he wears, fair is it and comely;\nAnd if he takes not on his soul the burden of loss and toil,\nthere lies not before him any road to praise and glory.\nShe cast blame on us that our number was little to count and few:\nI answered her\u2014'Yea: the count of noble men is little.\n'But not few canst thou call those whose remnants are like to us\n'\u2014young men who vie with the old in the quest of glory.\n\nIt hurts us nought that we be few, when our friend by us\nis safe, though the friends of most men beside be trampled;\nA mountain we have where dwells he whom we shelter there,\nlofty, before whose height the eye falls back blunted:\nDeep-based is its root below ground, and overhead there soars\nits peak to the stars of heaven whereto no man reaches.\nA folk are we who deem it no shame to be slain in fight,\nthough that be the deeming thereof of Salf\u00eel and '\u00c2mir;\nOur love of death brings near to us our days of doom,\nbut their dooms shrink from death and stand far distant.\nThere dies among us no lord a quiet death in his bed,\nand never is blood of us poured forth without vengeance.\n\nOur souls stream forth in a flood from the edge of the whetted swords:\nno otherwise than so does our spirit leave its mansion.\n\nPure is our stock, unsullied: fair is it kept and bright\nby mothers whose bed bears well, and fathers mighty.\n\nTo the best of the uplands we wend, and when the season comes,\nwe travel adown to the best of fruitful valleys.\n\nLike rain of the heaven are we: there is not in all our line\none blunt of heart, nor among us is counted a niggard.\n\nWe say nay whenso we will to the words of other men,\nbut no man to us says nay when we give sentence.\n\nWhen passes a lord of our line, in his stead there rises straight\na lord to say the say and do the deeds of the noble.\n\nOur beacon is never quenched to the wanderer of the night,\nnor has ever a guest blamed us where men meet together.\n\nOur Days are famous among our foemen, of fair report,\nbranded and blazed with glory like noble horses.\n\nOur swords have swept throughout all lands both West and East\nand gathered many a notch from the steel of hauberk-wearers;\n\nNot used are they when drawn to be laid back in their sheaths\nbefore that the folk they meet are spoiled and scattered.\n\nIf thou knowest not, ask men what they think of us and them\n\u2014not alike are he that knows and he that knows not.\n\nThe children of ed-Dayy\u0101n are the shaft of their people\u2019s mill\n\u2014around them it turns and whirls, while they stand midmost.\n\nNotes.\n\nThe metre is the third form of the Taq\u012bl: the first hemistich is the same as in Nos. II, III and IV; but the second is catalectic and is scanned thus:\n\n\\[ \\text{u} - \\text{u} | \\text{u} - \\text{u} - \\text{u} | \\text{u} - \\text{u} | \\text{u} - \\text{u} \\]\n\nThis poem stands in the \u1e24am\u0101seh under the name of es-Semau\u2019al son of \u2018\u0100diya the Jew, but it is not by him; this is proved by the mention of \u2018\u0100mir and Sal\u016bl in verse 8, and of the Benu-d-Dayy\u0101n in v. 22. The mistake by which it has been attributed to es-Semau\u2019al arose, as pointed out by et-Tebriz\u012b against the passage, from v. 6, where the mountain spoken of, which is really a metaphor for the glory and renown of the tribe, has been thought to be the burg el-Ablaq in Teym\u0101, where es-Semau\u2019al dwelt, and where he sheltered the kin of Imra\u2019el-Qays the poet against el-H\u0101rith son of Ab\u016b Shemir king of Ghass\u0101n.\n\nOf the real author nothing is known except that he belonged to the noble stock of ed-Dayy\u0101n: his name recurs in the \u1e24am\u0101seh at p. 400 as the author of a marthiyeh,\nand he is there called a native of Syria (Sha'\u0101mi) and a metaphysician (Kel\u0101mi); I have found no mention of him in the Agh\u0101n\u012b, Ibn Khallik\u0101n, Ibn Quteybeh, or \u1e24\u0101fi Khalf\u012bfah. It seems to me most probable that the piece belongs to the early wars of the Arabs during the spread of el-Isl\u0101m over Asia Minor, Armenia and Persia, and I should doubt its being the composition of a mere scholar. The fact that it was attributed to es-Semau'al shows that its authorship is uncertain, and that it cannot be set down to any other with confidence.\n\nv. 5. \"Our friend,\" j\u0101r: this word is used for either (but most frequently for the weaker) of the two parties to a covenant of mutual protection (j\u012bw\u0101r); it is etymologically identical with the Hebrew g\u0113r (A.V. \"stranger\"), and the latter word frequently bears the same meaning: e.g. in Job xxxi. 32, where the LXX rightly render it by \u1f10\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd, which has the same double sense of host and guest, protector and protected.\n\nv. 6. The mountain here referred to is the glory and great name of the tribe; the same metaphor occurs in a noble passage of the mo'tallaqah of el-H\u0101rith son of Hil-lizeh (vv. 23\u201426).\n\nAnd we have stood, spite of their hate, and high towers\nand firm-based glory lift us aloft;\nBefore to-day has it blinded the eyes\nof men in which were wrath and denial.\nAs though the Fates beating against us met\na black mountain cleaving the topmost clouds,\nMighty and strong above the changes of things,\nwhich no shock of the Days can soften or shake.\n\nv. 8. Sal\u016bl was a brother tribe of '\u0100mir son of \u0160a'sa'ah: both were engaged in frequent contests and rivalries with the Benu-l-H\u0101rith ibn Ka'b, and especially with the house of ed-Dayy\u0101n; see, for instance, Agh\u0101n\u012b X, 146, where a story is told of a contest at 'O\u1e33\u0101\u1e6d between Yez\u012bd son of 'Abd-el-Mad\u0101n and '\u0100mir son of Tufeyl for the hand of the daughter of Umayyeh son of el-Askar el-Kin\u0101n\u012b, in which the former was victorious: also another (pp. 146-7) between the same Yez\u012bd and the men of '\u0100mir before one of the Ghassanide Kings. One of the battles between the Benu-l-H\u0101rith and the Benu '\u0100mir was the Day of es-Selef (Agh. X, 160): another was the Day of Feyf-er-R\u012b\u1e25 (Ibn-el-Ath\u012br, I, 474.)\n\nv. 14. \"Rain of the heaven\", md'u-l-muzn\u012b: literally, \"water of a white rain-cloud\": the sense is that they are as liberal as rain. Md-es-Sem\u0101, \"Water of the heaven,\" was a name given among the Arabs to men for their bounty and women for\ntheir beauty. \"One blunt of heart,\" kah\u00e1m: the opposite of m\u00e9di, cutting, keen, going straight to his end.\n\nv. 18. \"Days,\" Ayy\u00e1d\u00e1m, is the word used in Arab legend for battles: one says\u2014\n\"the Day of el-Kul\u00e1b,\" \"the Day of Shi'b Jebeleh,\" &c., although the fight may\n(as it did at el-Kul\u00e1b) have lasted longer than one day.

The boiling of the cauldrons is also explained in two ways; it is said that it is a metaphor for the heat and fury of war: but the better and simpler interpretation refers it to their ever open hospitality. \"We heal with our rich store\": that is, \"when any one is slain by us we pay from our herds the price of his blood.\"\n\nv. 9.

full-bellied\ntreading their dead, too gorged to leave them.\n\nNotes.\n\nThe measure is the Med\u012bd, the basis of which is a pair of ionics a minore separated by an anapest:\n\nThis poem stands in the \u1e24am\u0101sah under the name of Ta'abbata Sherr\u0101; but it is also attributed to Ta'abbata's sister's son, and held to refer to the vengeance wrought by the nephew on his uncle's slayers. The commentators, however, say that the slain man cannot be Ta'abbata himself, for Sal', the place named in the first verse, is in the neighbourhood of al-Med\u012bnah; but the place where Ta'abbata was slain lay in the country of Hu\u1e63eyl, eastward of Mekkeh, and was called Rakhm\u0101n. His sister said, bewailing him\u2014\n\n\"Fair was the warrior whom ye left in Rakhm\u0101n\n\u2014Th\u0101bit son of J\u0101bir son of Sufy\u0101n,\nWho slew his foe and poured wine for his fellow!\"\n\n(Th\u0101bit son of J\u0101bir was the real name of Ta'abbata Sherr\u0101, which means \"He carried evil under his arm.\")\n\nBut the weight of evidence is against the authenticity of the poem as an utterance of Ta'abbata's; it is more probably attributed to the famous imitator of the songs of the pagan Arabs, Ab\u016b Mo\u1e25ris ibn Hayy\u0101n, commonly known as Khalaf el-Almar. This man was a native of Fargh\u0101na, and was taken captive with his parents when Khur\u0101s\u0101n was conquered by the Muslims; he grew up to be a most eminent man of learning, and among all those of that class, who abounded in the days of the first 'Abbas\u012b Khalfiefs, he was the truest poet. He is best known as a fabricator of poems in the style of the ancients, with which he deceived the learned men of al-K\u016bfah, and even \u1e24amm\u0101d er-R\u0101wiyyah himself; he afterwards acknowledged the poems to be forged, but they refused to believe it. He died about A.H. 180. (Ibn Quteybah, Ma'rif, p. 270. Id. in N\u00f6ldeke's Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss d. Poes. d. alt. Arab. p. 15. Ibn Khallik\u0101n, I. p. 571, and III. p. 391. Agh\u0101n\u012b V. 174.)\n\nThe following are some of the marks of a late origin (\u0101th\u0101r et-ta\u1e63w\u012bd) which are to be found in the piece:\n\nThe subtlety of the thought conveyed in the words of verse 5, b,\u2014jalla \u1e25att\u0101 dagga flihi-l-ajjelu: this struck the ancient commentators as unlike the speech of a Desert Arab:\n\nThe play of words in verse 8 between yibbi\u0161u-l-jombeyni (dry-sided, i.e. lean) and nadi-l-haf\u012bywi, (moist-handed, i.e. liberal):\nThe alliteration in v. 9, where out of ten words seven contain the letter T:\nThe alliteration of gheythu and gh\u0101mirun in v. 10, and the rhyming antithesis of gheyth and leyth (besides \u1e25eyth in the same verse):\nThe very unusual distributive sense of kil\u0101 in v. 12:\nThe use of injaba in v. 14 for the dawn: it appears to be used in classical Arabic only for the clearing away of clouds;\nThe play on the word m\u0101gin in v. 15, where it means (1) a warrior who goes straight to his end, and (2) a sword that cuts through all obstacles.\n\nNone of these taken by itself would perhaps be conclusive; alliteration is not unknown in the ancient poetry, but it is not approved; and instances of word-play might also be found. But taken together they constitute what is called tekelluf (which may be rendered artificiality), which is foreign to the age to which the poem would belong if it were really by Ta'abat\u0101 Sherr\u0101.\n\nBut whether an imitation or a genuine old poem, there can be no doubt that the piece breathes the true spirit of the pagan Arab. Albert Schultens says of it\u2014\"Nobile hoc carmen . . . . monumentum est illustre laudationum quibus Fortium fortia facta concelebrari soletant.\" Magnis splendet ornamentis ac luminibus, quae gentis genium graphicoe pingunt.\" Goethe, in the Appendix to his West-Oestlicher Diwan (where he gives a translation of it, rendered from Schultens' Latin, as the only specimen of old Arab poetry which he adduces), writes\u2014\"Die Gr\u00f6sse des Characters, der Ernst, die rechtm\u00e4ssige Grausamkeit des Handelns, hier eigentlich das Mark der Poesie . . . H\u00f6chst merkw\u00fcrdig erscheint uns bei diesem Gedicht, dass die reine Prosa der Handlung durch Transposition der einzelnen Ereignisse poetisch wird. Dadurch, und dass das Gedicht fast alles \u00e4ussern Schmucks erlangt, wird der Ernst desselben erh\u00f6ht, und wer sich recht hinein liest muss das Geschehene, von Anfang bis zu Ende, nach und nach vor der Einbildungskraft aufgebaut erblicken.\"\n\nvv. 1 to 4 tell of the slaying, and set before us the avenger: vv. 5 to 13 praise the slain man, his mighty deeds and great heart: vv. 14 to 17 describe the onslaught which led in the end to his fall: vv. 18 to 20, the many deeds of daring which Hu\u1e0dayl had to avenge on him; vv. 21 to 27, the vengeance taken by him into whose mouth the poem is put.\n\nv. 1. \"Drips not without vengeance,\" nd yufallu: literally, \"is not poured forth like the dew or fine rain.\"\n\nv. 3. \"A heritage of bloodshed to me the son of his sister\", wa ward'a-th-tha'ti minni-bnu ukhiin: literally, \"and behind the vengeance\" (i.e., to take it up\u2014a continuation of the thought of verse 2) [there is] \"a sister's son in me.\" This verse has been misunderstood by Schultens and R\u00fcckert: the former renders it\u2014\"Post me talioni imminet sororis filius,\" and the latter\u2014\"Und ein Schwestersohn zur Rache tritt mir nach.\" Goethe, seeing with a fine discernment that the avenger who speaks is himself the sister's son of the dead, (compare verse 24\u2014inna jismi be'da Kh\u0101li lakkha), makes verses 3 and 4 the reported utterance of the dying man\u2014\n\n\"Erbe meiner Rache\nIst der Schwestersohn,\nDer Streitbare,\nDer Unvers\u00f6hnlche,\" u. s. w.\n\nMinni is here an example of the explicative men (ti-L-baydn).\n\n\"His knot none looses,\" 'ogdatuhu id tophalu, said of a man whose fury in battle is\nirresistible: the dictionaries give *takallelet* 'oqaduhu as meaning \"his anger was appeased.\"\n\nv. 4. The comparison of the warrior to a deadly serpent in this verse recalls the name of the family in Teghlib to which 'Amr son of Kulth\u00fbm belonged\u2014the *Ar\u0101qim*\u2014\"the spotted serpents.\"\n\nv. 5. \"The heaviest of burdens thereby is nothing\": literally\u2014\"it is great (i.e., terrible) so that the greatest therein becomes little\"; the criticism of the earlier commentators on this phrase has been mentioned above.\n\nv. 6. \"Whose friend,\" *jadr\u016bh*: see the note to v. 5 of No. V.\n\nv. 7. \"A sunshine,\" *sh\u0101mis*: literally, \"a sunny day.\"\n\nv. 8. \"Lean-sided\": leanness is a subject of praise in a hero because it denotes the hardships he has undergone, and also his generosity in giving to others to eat while he keeps nought for himself.\n\nv. 11. The first hemistich of this verse can be taken in two ways: either *masb\u016bhun* may be rendered absolutely, \"letting hang down,\" i.e., his garments; and *shud* may be taken of his complexion, \"swarthy\"; or, as I have rendered it, *shud* may be the accusative after *masb\u016bhun*, \"letting hang down his long black [hair].\" \"His skirts trailed\": in days of peace and quiet the Arabs allowed their *isdr* or waist-wrapper to trail on the ground: in war they girt it tight about their loins. Zubeyr says, describing a luxurious people (Ahlwardt, Six Poets, p. 77):\n\n![Arabic text]\n\n\"By them is wine, and a strainer, and musk thereby wherewith their skins are perfumed, and water: They trail their skirts of *burd*, and in them glows the vehemence of the cup and the ecstasy of song.\"\n\n(Water, to mix with the wine: so wine was commonly drunk by the Arabs: see Tarafeh, Mo'all. 59, and 'Amr Kulth. Mo'all. 2).\n\n\"A wolf's whelp,\" *sim*: a hybrid between the wolf and the hyena, with the fierceness of both.\n\nv. 12. \"Gall,\" *sharyum*, the colocynth or bitter gourd.\n\nv. 14. The mode of journeying in the Desert here described will be familiar to all readers of Palgrave's \"Central and Eastern Arabia.\"\n\nvv. 16, 17. In et-Tebriz'i's edition of the Ham\u0101seh these verses stand in the reverse order: the sequence in which I have given them is that in which they are placed by Schultens, and seems the natural one.\n\n\"They were tasting of asleep by sips,\" *iqtasau anfda naumim*: i.e., sleep was overcoming them little by little.\n\nv. 18. \"Broke the edge of his sword blade,\" *fellet shaddhu*: that is, apparently, overthrew him.\n\nv. 21. \"Hu\u1e63eyl has been burned,\" *galiyet*, i.e., scathed. So el-H\u0101rith son of 'Ob\u0101d, when he was unwillingly compelled to take part in the contest by the slaying of his son Bujeyr by Muhelhil, said of the War of Bas\u016bs\u2014\n\"I was not of those whose wrong wrought it, God knows!\nYet to-day must I be burned in its blaze.\"\n\nv. 22. \"He drank deep at the first draught\" (nehila) and \"he drank deep a second draught\" (alla), both words used originally of camels, are in constant use in Arab poetry to describe the thrust and thrust again of spears.\n\nv. 23. Wine was forbidden to him, because he had sworn not to drink it until he attained to his vengeance.\n\nv. 25. This verse is omitted in Freytag's edn. of et-Tebriz\u00ee's Ham\u00e2seh: I have restored it from Schultens' text, because it appears to arise naturally out of the idea of the preceding verse.\n\nv. 27. \"The vultures,\" 'it\u00e2q\u00fb-t-fayri: literally, \"the noble of birds,\" a term reserved for birds of prey. \"Flap their wings,\" ta\u1e25fi: this is the reading of Schultens, and is also given by et-Tebriz\u00ee in the commentary, though he admits teghd\u00e2 into the text; the former reading seems to me to give much greater vividness to the horrible picture than the latter, which is a mere auxiliary verb.\n\nVIII.\n\nIsh\u00e2q son of Khalaf.\n\nIf no Umeymeh were there, no Want would trouble my soul\u2014no labour call me to toil for bread through pitkiest night;\nWhat moves my longing to live is but that well do I know how low the fatherless lies,\u2014how hard the kindness of kin.\nI quake before loss of wealth lest lacking fall upon her,\nand leave her shieldless and bare as flesh set forth on a board.\nMy life she prays for, and I from mere love pray for her death\u2014yes, death, the gentlest and kindest guest to visit a maid.\nI fear an uncle's rebuke, a brother's harshness for her;\nmy chiefest end was to spare her heart the grief of a word.\nNotes.\n\nThe metre is the first form of the *be\u1e63\u1e6d*, in which the last foot is the same in the second hemistich as in the first; an attempt has been made to imitate it in the translation. The grammars give \u2014 \u2014 as permissible for the third foot, although on an examination of a large number of pieces of this measure in the \u1e24am\u0101seh I have found no example of a short first syllable; instances, however, occur elsewhere; see en-N\u0101bighah, v. 34 and 49, and xi. 3. Zuheyr, ix. 18, 21, 22. In the English, owing to the want of clear distinction between syllables long in themselves (apart from the accent) and short, it has not been found possible always to give a long syllable in this place.\n\nOf the author of these lines I have been able to ascertain nothing. The fragment is, as shewn by the rhyme in the first hemistich, the beginning of a *ga\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101d*; four more lines of the same measure and rhyme are given as a continuation of the piece in the Appendix to the Calcutta Edn. of the \u1e24am\u0101seh, p. 221: but they are of inferior merit to those selected by Ab\u016b Temm\u0101m. By his name (Ish\u0101q) the author should be an Isl\u0101m\u012b; the only authentic instance of a biblical name born by an Arab (not a Jew) before el-Isl\u0101m is that of the great-great-grandfather of \u2018Ad\u012b son of Zeyd el-Th\u0101d\u012b, who was called Ayy\u016bb (Job). (See Agh\u0101n\u012b ii. 18, and Abu-l-\u2018Al\u0101, quoted in the \u1e24am\u0101seh, p. 177). The sentiment of v. 4 is, however, rather pagan than Islamic.\n\nv. 3. \u201cMeat on a butcher\u2019s board\u201d is a proverbial expression for that which is utterly defenceless and helpless.\n\nv. 4. The scholiast compares the proverbs (both current in the Ignorance) *ni\u2019m\u0101-l-khatanu-l-qabru*, \u201cAn excellent son-in-law is the Grave,\u201d and *defnu-l-ben\u0101t mina-l-makrum\u0101t*, \u201cTo bury daughters is an act of mercy\u201d; the reference in the latter is to the practice of burying female children alive immediately after birth, which was still prevalent (though not widely spread) among the pagan Arabs at the time of the Prophet\u2019s mission. The lot of women among the Arabs of the Ignorance was a hard one; and it is most probable that the practice in question was perpetuated, if it did not begin, in the desire to save the family the shame of seeing its women ill-used or otherwise disgraced. This is to be inferred from the account given in the Agh\u0101n\u012b (xii. 150) of the reason why Qeys son of \u2018\u0100sim, a lord of the tribe of Temm\u0101m, adopted it. To this man was due the revival of the custom in the Prophet\u2019s time after it had almost died out; a terrible tale is told of his burial alive of the only one of his daughters who was saved at birth and brought up in another family unknown to him.\n\nv. 5. The use of the imperfect (*kuntu ubgi*) in the second hemistich of this verse is worth noticing. The speaker looks forward to the time when his daughter will be left fatherless, and find no love such as that which she found in him.\n\nIX.\n\n\u1e24itt\u0101n son of el-Mo\u2019all\u0101.\n\n\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0632\u0650\u0644\u0652\u064a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u062d\u064f\u0643\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0633\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062e\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0636\u064d \u0648\u064e \u063a\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0628\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0641\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0633\u064e \u0644\u064a \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0639\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u0650\u064a \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627 \u0631\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0636\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0636\u0650\u064a \u062a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0628\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0627 \u0631\u064f\u062f\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0636\u064d \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0636\u064d\nFortune has brought me down (her wonted way)\nfrom station great and high to low estate;\nFortune has rent away my plenteous store:\nof all my wealth honour alone is left;\nFortune has turned my joy to tears: how oft\ndid Fortune make me laugh with what she gave!\nBut for these girls, the Qata's downy brood,\nunkindly thrust from door to door as hard\u2014\n\nFar would I roam and wide to seek my bread\nin Earth that has no lack of breadth and length;\nNay, but our children in our midst, what else\nbut our hearts are they walking on the ground?\nIf but the wind blow harsh on one of them,\nmine eye says no to slumber all night long.\n\nNOTES.\n\nThe metre is the third form of the Sari', and consists of two dibrams (each commutable to \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 and \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014) followed by a cretic (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014); in the second hemistich, which is catalectic, the cretic becomes a spondee:\n\nOf the poet I have ascertained nothing.\n\nv. 4. The Qata is the sand-grouse; it is most probably identical with the Hebrew Qd'ath (A. V. \"pelican\").\n\nThe second hemistich of this verse has strangely perplexed the commentators. The following is a translation of et-Tebrizt's note upon it. \"Rudidna min ba'din ild ba'di means\u2014'They were gathered together to me in a brief space of time, one born of a second wife after another born of the first, one by the side of another.' Another reading is rededna min ba'din ild ba'dit, with the active form of the verb and the personal pronoun joined to the second ba'di; the meaning of this would be 'they have bowed me and bent one part of my back towards another.' Or, if we adopt the first reading, the line may mean that these daughters of his had been wedded, and were turned away together with their little girls; mardudeh is used in the sense of a divorced woman, and ild is sometimes equivalent to ma' (together with): you say h\u00e2d\u00e2 ild d\u00e2ka ('this with that') meaning ma'a d\u00e2ka; taking it in this way, min ba'din ild ba'di will be in the place of the accusative of condition to rudidna, i.e., they have been divorced together\nwith their children.' Or you may read r\u016bdidna as before, and min ba'di il\u0101 ba'di, giving both the ba'di the affixed pronoun; the sense would then be 'They were in my loins, and when I begot them they entered (were turned) into my heart, which burns by reason of them through excess of affection.' Another reading is jum\u012b'na min ba'din il\u0101 ba'di [the sense of which would be the same as the first explanation given by et-Tebriz\u012b]. Ab\u016b Hil\u0101l says: 'r\u016bdidna min ba'din il\u0101 ba'di is a sentence which hides but little meaning: perhaps he intended to say that they were born from different mothers, and were thrust from one to the other: but he did not express himself plainly.'\n\nSo far et-Tebriz\u012b; it appears to me that the difficulty (which consists in the use of the past, r\u016bdidna, for the future which the poet contemplates for his daughters, and which has led the commentators to try to explain that verb as referring to something already past) may be solved by supposing that the speaker puts his anticipation in the form of an event already come to pass. Such a construction is the common one for optatives, (jaz\u0101hu-lidd\u0101, &c.,) and is so used in places where there can be no question of the theological explanation which refers it to the foreknowledge of God, to whom future is as past; see e.g., \u1e24am\u0101seh, p. 67.\n\nThen, again, there are many instances in which what is spoken of as a past event is explained as a future one, e.g., in \u1e24am., p. 172.\n\nwhere the commentary (perhaps needlessly) understands that the poet, in his foreknowledge of what awaits him, speaks of it as already come to pass. So also in \u1e24am., p. 252, Jahdar son of Dubey'ah says\u2014\n\nplainly referring to a bereavement and widowing which are to be after his death in the fight before engaging in which he utters the verses. These instances seem amply to justify us in understanding the words in their natural sense\u2014\"pushed (or thrust) from one to another without help or kindness\"; nothing could be more far-fetched than all the explanations given by et-Tebriz\u012b.\nINDEX\n\nTO\n\nJOURNAL, ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL, PART I,\n\nFOR\n\n1877.\n\nA\n\n'Abd, son of Juland\u00e1, of 'Om\u00e1n, 60\n'Abd-el-Melik, son of 'Abd-er-Rah\u00edm, an Arabian poet, 446\n'Abdur Rahman Kh\u00e1n, of Kotsimul, 167\nAborigines:\u2014Bedhyas, 220; Bhars, 25, 26, 36, 227; Bhils, 228; Binds, 26; Cher\u00fas, 25; D\u00e1kas, Daityas, Dasyas, 36; Gonds, 228, 232, 234; Kham\u00e1rs, 22; Kharw\u00e1rs, 17, 21n., 25; Ko\u00eds, 183; Kols, 183, 228; Kurmis, 235; Lodhis, 231; Mashars, 22; Manipuris, 36; N\u00e1g\u00e1s, 38; Suriy\u00e1s, 25; Yanadis, 184; Zutt, or gypsies, in Arabia, 67;\u2014profess Buddhism, 231\nAb\u00fa Bekr el-Bisr\u00ed, 50\nAb\u00fa Mobriz ibn Hayy\u00e1n, 455\nAb\u00fath\u00e1b\u00ed, in 'Om\u00e1n, 52\nAcacia Arabica, 47;\u2014vera 47\nAethiopia, 439\nAgastya, or Canopus, 436\nAgham writing, 8\nAgh\u00e1n\u00ed, vide Kit\u00e1b-el-Agh\u00e1n\u00ed\nAgni-var\u1e47a, 39\nAgra Sila, Vindhya's guru, 16\nagriculture, in 'Om\u00e1n, 54\nAjaijal, of Ajmir, 231\nAjmir, 230, 231\n'Akabat kum\u00e1sh\u00ed, in 'Om\u00e1n, 42\nAkbarp\u00far, in Bih\u00e1r, 22\nAlh\u00e1, the Chandel hero, 233\n'Ali Naq\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, 167\nAll\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, 231\nalum, mine of, 23\n'Am\u00e1l\u00e9kites, 50\nAmarakantak, sacred pool of, 20\nAmedabata, the munia bird, 24\n'Amr, son of Ma'di-kerib, 169\nAm\u00fa River, 333; vide Oxus\nAnatolian Folk-lore, 14\nAncient Sculpturings on rocks in Kam\u00e1on, 1\n\nArabia, 41, 62, 90, 437, 459\nArab, 29\nArar-Brahmana, 164\nAsaf 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, M\u00edr of Shighn\u00e1n, 97\nAs\u00e1m, or Tekhau, 38\nastronomy, Hind\u00fa, 411\naugury, in Arabia, 82\n'Auh\u00ed, in 'Om\u00e1n, 41\n'Aw\u00e1m\u00edr Bedouins, 44\nel-Azd, of 'Om\u00e1n, 50\n\nB\n\nBadakhsh\u00e1n, 98\nbageri, a bird, 24\nBajn\u00e1th, in Kam\u00e1on, 1\nBalkh, 333n.\nBangalor, 14\nBangar\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, 164\nBarani, goddess, 16\nBarba, a place south of Dihl\u00ed, 186\nBarkh\u00e1ri, vide Bhark\u00e1ri\nbater, a quail, 24\nel-B\u00e1tinch, in 'Om\u00e1n, 48\nBedhyas, a tribe of gipsies, 220\nBen\u00ed-l-Ambar, 438;\u2014d-Dayy\u00e1n, 446;\u2014Gheith, 42;\u2014H\u00e1rit ibn Ka'b, 438, 449;\u2014Ja'far ibn Kil\u00e1b, 75;\u2014Ka'b, 46;\u2014M\u00e1z\u00edn, 438;\u2014Nahl, 67;\u2014Oqeyl, 440, 444;\u2014Sal\u00fal, 75;\u2014Sheyb\u00e1n, 437;\u2014Tem\u00edm, 440;\u2014Thaq\u00edf, 80\nel-Bereym\u00ed, in 'Om\u00e1n, 41\nBesh\u00e1m\u00e9h, son of Hazn, an Arabian poet, 450\nBhagahap\u00far, 28n.\nBhaprau\u00e1 kher\u00e1, 228\nBhar, R\u00e1j\u00e1, of Mah\u00f3b\u00e1, 231\nBhars, 25, 227, 233; vide Aborigines\nBharw\u00e1r\u00e1, 228, 231\nBharsaw\u00e1n, 228\nBharkh\u00e1ri, in Bundelkhand, 228\nBhar\u00fa\u00e1, 228\nBhav\u00e1mi, 17\nBhava Gupta, 149\nBhils, 233; vide Aborigines\nBhima Deva, 161\nBhunna Fort, 26\nBhubun, 34\nbh\u00fams, twelve, of Bengal, 166n.\nBh\u00fami-m\u00e1la, a caste, 186\nBidran\u00e1th, shrine of, 1\nBih\u00e1r, district of, 21\nBijaigarh, fort of, 26\nBinds, a tribe, 25\nBirabhanu Deva, of Orissa, 151\nBlochmann, H., an unpublished ghazal by H\u00e1fiz, 237\nbogolu, a bird, 24\nbombax heptaphylla, 165\nbotany, of Bih\u00e1r, 21;\u2014of 'Om\u00e1n, 47;\u2014of Arabia, 77\nBrahma Mukt\u00e1vali, by Isvari Datt Pandit, 28n.\nBrahma Sampr\u00e1d\u00e1ya, 133\nBrahmanism, in Orissa, 153\nBuchanania latifolia, 21\nBuddhism, 185, 231\nBuddhist ruins in Kam\u00e1on, 3\nBuld\u00e1n-el-'Aw\u00e1m\u00edr, 53\nBundel\u00e1 R\u00e1jputs, 231\nBundelkhand, 26, 227\nBurhi Dco, a Rangpur deity, 188\nBurj-el-Shikeyri, in 'Om\u00e1n, 42\nBurma, 38\nButea frondosa, 21\n\nCamels, of 'Om\u00e1n, 47; 78, 92, 95, 169, 173\nCampbell, Mr., on rock markings, 15\nCanopus, in Sanskrit Agastya, 436\ncastes, Hind\u00fa, 186, 231\nchakr\u00e1bik, the Brahmani goose, 25\nChan\u00e1r Fort, 16\nCh\u00e1nd, founder of Chy\u00e1pur, 36\nChand\u00e1l\u00e1s, a caste, 186\nChandan, Sayyid, tomb of, 28\nChandel R\u00e1jputs, 229\nChandeshwar temple, in Kam\u00e1on, 2\nChandra, a village in Orissa, 160\nChandr\u00e1s\u00e9khara B\u00e1nurj\u00ed, The Kaim\u00far Range, 16\nCharairongba, 36\nCharan\u00e1dri, or Fort Chan\u00e1r, 16\nChaudw\u00e1r, in Orissa, 150, 151.\nChavana Muni, 20n.\nChoran, in Bih\u00e1r, 25\nChor\u00fas, tho tribe, 17, 25, 26\nchitti, a sort of hemp, 22\nChristianity, 184;\u2014early, in Arabia, 439\nChy\u00e1pur, 26, 27, 28n.\nCiva Gupta, 174\nCopper-plate Grant from Cuttack, 149;\u2014from Sambalpur, 173\ncrosses, Christian, 173, 184\ncupmarks, on rocks, 1, 3\n\nD\u00e1ityas, D\u00e1kas, races of, 36\nDalil Kh\u00e1n, S\u00edh\u00e1d\u00e1r, 231\nDamant, G.

F. Campbell, Esq., F. G. S.\n\n(Read January 17th, 1877.)\n\n[We so seldom have the advantage of foreign opinion upon matters of scientific observation in India, that the Society will no doubt welcome the following notes upon Himalayan glaciation addressed to one of its Secretaries by Mr. J. F. Campbell, so well known for his remarks upon ice-action in every quarter of the northern hemisphere. The notes are left in their epistolary form, which is so well suited to communications that do not pretend to be exhaustive.]\n\nKotleh, November 19th, 1876, Kangra valley.\n\nMy dear Sir,\u2014On the 27th Sept. I landed with you at Bombay. By your advice I have come here to look at certain marks supposed to be glacial. Let me refer you to the second volume of 'Frost and Fire' for marks which I had recognized when that book was printed. Let me refer you to 'My Circular Notes.' (Macmillan 1875) for references to other papers of mine on glacial subjects, and for the result of my observations during thirty-five years. From these writings you may estimate my knowledge of glacial marks and my opinion.\n\n1. I have now skirted the base of the Himalayas from Hirdwar to Lahore. In the plains of Europe and of North America, I have seen large stones, carried great distances from parent rocks, say from a thousand to fifteen hundred miles, over plains. These commonly are smoothed, polished, and grooved, exactly like stones which are found beneath existing glaciers. These erratics reach as far south as icebergs now float in the\nAtlantic, namely, to Lat. 37\u00b0 N. in America. I have not seen one large stone in the plains of India so far as I have travelled, except stones carted and carried by men for building purposes. Of these not one was striated.\n\n2. I have been to Simla, and to \"Monsuri\" (so named by the people), and for short distances inland. In Scotland, Scandinavia, the Alps, and in North America; in Labrador, and in Vancouver's Island: in all northern countries where marks of ancient glaciations abound, and where I have travelled to study them; I have seen rocks and mountains of a particular rounded form, on which grooves mark out the course of the ancient glaciers or icebergs which moved over these rocks and rounded them. In Scandinavia horizontal grooves are visible on the large scale from end to end of fjords more than a hundred miles long, up to a height of more than a thousand feet above the sea level. All the rocky islands which stud the Norwegian coast are striated, up to considerable heights, and great blocks of transported stone are poised upon the hill-tops everywhere. Many of these erratics are angular blocks, as big as small houses. In 1841, I slept under a stone of this kind with fifteen other persons, guides and travellers, upon an Alpine glacier. Such stones abound in Scotland, and in Ireland, some as high as three thousand feet, and rest upon the tops of isolated mountains. I have not seen one \"perched block\" in the lower Himalayas, nor have I seen one hog-backed ridge or one rounded valley. I have seen everywhere far and near, with my telescope, and at my feet a constant repetition of the form V which I attribute to the action of running water, not to glacial action.\n\n3. I went to Hirdwar, to the exit of the Ganges from the basin in which that river and its branches take their rise in glaciers. I have photographs of these glaciers. In all the glaciated countries that I have visited, the ends of great basins of this kind are abundantly strewed with glaciated stones. I sought carefully from Deira to Hirdwar, and from Hirdwar to Roorkee along the Ganges canal, and I did not find one glaciated stone there.\n\n4. It sometimes happens that large glaciated stones are found in rocks consolidated, and classed geologically as old rocks;\u2014\"old red sandstone,\" &c. I have looked at the \"Siwaliks,\" at the rocks which contain fossils of large extinct animals. I have not seen one glaciated stone in these beds. The fauna of the Siwaliks &c., as described in books, indicate a warm climate, like that which now exists here, and do not indicate anything glacial.\n\n5. From Pathankote (here named \"Putt\u0101nkote\") to Nurpur, I crossed the mouth of a wide valley in which are several large rivers which take their rise amongst glaciers according to the maps. I saw nothing glacial on that stage. These streams drain the northern slopes of the Kangra range.\n6. From Nurpur to this place I have crossed several rivers, which descend from the southern face of a snowy range behind which rivers flow which I crossed yesterday. The range is some 12 or 13,000 feet higher than my road, according to the maps, and the top of it is distant about 12 or 13 miles. I have seen a vast number of large stones near these rivers. I have not seen one stone or one exposed rock surface with any mark of glaciation along my route thus far. Several large stones, some of granite, are below this house. Their surfaces are well preserved, and they are all dented by rolling, not striated by sliding.\n\n7. Where rivers are cutting through old moraines, they constantly undermine and wash out glaciated stones. A small rivulet near Dunrobin in Sutherland is full of large striated stones, washed out of an old moraine of large size. The plain rivers below Chicago in America also wash out large glaciated boulders which come from beyond Lake Superior. I have seen no such stone here, and nothing that has the remotest resemblance to any moraine that I ever saw anywhere. A fall of about a thousand feet in a mile, and the vast rainfall of these regions suffice to explain the transport of far larger stones than any which I have seen thus far in India. A very large stone was moved more than a hundred yards this year at Kalka, by the small river which there enters the plains. The stone was known because it had long been used as a washing stone. The fact was remembered because two washermen were carried away and drowned by a sudden flood. The slope at Kalka is far less than the slope here. Thus far I have seen nothing to suggest the action of ice at low levels between Hirdwar, and Lahore, Pathankote and Kotleh.\n\n8. So far as I can see now, my distant observations from Simla with a telescope, are confirmed by detailed examination of this ground.\n\n9. I say nothing of that kind of geology which belongs to professional men. I see enough to convince me that there is professional work on this ground for many expert geologists for many years. But generally it seems to me, that a part of the plain, formed of old as the plain is now forming, has been crumpled up against the older rocks, probably by a thrust. I saw a folded section in the right bank of the river at Nurpur yesterday with an expiring camel on the shingle to shew how \"siwalik\" fossils got buried of old by streams like those which now flow into the plains. They form \"Deltas\" or, if the new name is preferred fans, which now extend ten or twelve miles into the plains. These commonly spread till they meet so that a whole series make something like a continuous formation whose section must vary with the intermittent flow of rivers. Such a section of alternate beds of pebbles, shingle, sand, and brown mud I have seen in crossing the crumpled rocks which are named \"Siwaliks\" and \"Nahuns\" (?) hereabouts, and near Deiradun, I have no geological map,\nand a passing traveller cannot hope unaided to unravel the complications of beds which I see here. I saw another folded E.\u2014W. section today in a river bank. I do not therefore concern myself with that kind of geology which belongs to your department. I confine myself to marks of glaciation with which I have made myself familiar. About Lat. 80\u00b0 31' I have found none in India thus far.\n\n10. I have looked carefully for sea-margins along the foot of hills. All round Scandinavia, in Scotland, in \"the Labrador\", and in many other countries, \"terraces\" nearly parallel to the existing sea level mark old sea levels before the land was last raised. The form is very conspicuous, and the cause of it is often manifested by the discovery of recent shells in the sand and mud in which they died. I looked from Pathankote westwards, and saw the outline of the hills fade gradually into the plains at an angle of about five degrees. There was no semblance of a raised sea margin towards Kashmir. I have seen nothing like a \"terrace\" on the lower hills towards Hirdwar or beyond it. I never read of the discovery of recent sea shells anywhere in these regions. There is nothing hereabouts to suggest the agency of \"floating ice\" in lake or sea, or of lake or sea to float anything in.\n\n11. But as avalanches do fall into these Indian rivers, and make snow bridges, fragments of hard snow, or of glaciers, may possibly float downstream, and carry stones on ice rafts. Thus far I have seen no stones to suggest that possible method of transport by floating ice. The glaciers of which I have photographs are full of fallen stones, angular as they were when they broke from the cliffs. I have not seen one such stone in any river course that I have crossed. All the river stones are rolled.\n\n12. From my recent observations I see no reason to assume any great difference in this climate since the Sivaliks were deposited; since many kinds of extinct elephants lived hereabouts, with large saurians, like those which live in plain rivers now. I have found nothing to indicate a glacial period in India. What I noticed in travelling round the world you will find in the \"circular notes\" quoted above of which copies were at Bombay and Simla when I passed.\n\n13. Kangra, 20th.\u2014I passed yesterday over ridges which have been called \"moraines.\" My way led down stream to a fork, and then upstream to a level country. The gorge is manifestly cut by the river, and gives a section of beds of sandstone with a northerly dip. I noticed some large, rounded stones in the sandstone and some were \"horse tooth\" granite. Consequently the transport of such stones went on during the formation of these tilted beds. Near the top of the gorge I came to a thick bed of large rolled stones of many kinds. The bed seems to rest unconformably on the sandstones, on both sides of the river and to cover a considerable\narea though generally hidden beneath the soil. At a place called \"Cowlee\" I found a great number of very large stones in and about a river, which is crossed by a bridge. They are far larger than any that I have found elsewhere. I measured one roughly $12 \\times 8 \\times 8$ feet, and another 15 feet long. Many thousands of stones near this size have been washed out of the matrix which is hard reddish sandy stuff like the soil of the fields. As stones of this great size give reason to suspect glacial action, I sought carefully for marks. I went to the banks from which stones projected and found the surfaces where newly exposed, perfectly preserved. These were all smooth, or dinted, water-worn surfaces. There was no sign of striation on any stone that I examined. After a long search I came to the conclusion that these great stones were rolled to their present resting-place, and that this is not a \"moraine,\" but a \"Delta.\"\n\nNear Kangra a view is got which shews that the region crossed, in which these unusually large stones occur so abundantly, is the estuary of a number of streams which come out of a rocky amphitheatre furrowed by steep V water-courses, which begin at the top of the ridge, at the snow. From each of the larger furrows, extends a ridge of stuff which has been taken for a moraine. I am quite certain that I crossed no moraines. An old \"moraine\" consists of angular stones carried upon the surface of a glacier; of stuff carried in the ice; and of stones pushed along beneath the ice. There are medial and lateral moraines; the terminal moraine forms at the end of a glacier and makes a crescent-shaped rampart crossing a valley. It often forms a lake, like a \"bund.\" In these long ridges which I can see from this d\u00e2k bungalow, there is nothing like the shape of any kind of moraine. In crossing them I saw no large angular blocks; no small angular stuff; no striated stones, great or small. I can see minute details of the great hill face opposite to me, and there is no smoothed gorge there which could possibly have been the bed of a large glacier. From ridge to base the gorges are angular furrows, between ridges of extraordinary sharpness and steepness, in which the minutest details are picked out in snow, and in shadow. I can only see two small smooth patches on which small glaciers of the second or third order may have rested high up. I am quite certain that the \"Kangra erratics\" are large \"pebbles\" washed out of the \"Cads,\" by heavy floods. Stones larger than any that I have yet seen, are nearer to the mountains but they are all rounded. I can hear of no angular blocks, and I have seen none. What water may do in moving stones, is matter of observation and calculation. When a reservoir burst some years ago in England, the water swept away mills and machinery houses, and everything that stood in the way of the flood. I know many cases of extraordinary effects produced by unusual causes of this kind. The force of water depends upon the volume and velocity. Here the velocity must be extreme\nfor the fall is very rapid. The nearer to the hills the greater is the velocity. The weight of a stone in water is less by the weight of water displaced. The rainfall at Dhurmsala is 102 inches yearly. From the position of this high ridge at the edge of the plains the rainfall must be exceptionally great. A warm rain falling on deep snow causes an exceptional flood. I know a case in which such a combination worked havoc in Scotland. I cannot measure the area of the basin which I see, but it is large. From its exceeding steepness the water which falls into it, must gather, and flow out of it suddenly and with extraordinary volume, velocity, and force. Water power here seems ample, to account for the moving of the unusually large blocks of stone, which have been called \"erratics.\"\n\nIn Java is a volcanic cone 12000 feet high, named Pangerango. A cone is the worst form for collecting water power. Nevertheless at the foot of this cone a stream has dug a gorge, out of which it has shot stones as large as any which I have seen here. There is no question of glacial action in Java. A portion of an inverted hollow cone is good for collecting water power and here is a funnel nearly big enough to hold Pangerango inverted. My opinion is that the Kangra \"moraines\" are \"Deltas\" and the \"erratics\" pebbles of large size, proportioned to great water power. The largest are nearest to the parent rock.\n\n14. I found some beds of rolled stones yesterday in a hard matrix, so old that the pebbles had decomposed. Granite crumbled to sand at a touch; quartzite and slates broke to angular fragments at a tap from a hammer. This bed forms part of one of these so called \"moraines.\" I suspect that it will be found to form part of the \"Sivaliks\" undisturbed. The place is not far from Kangra, near a river, at a place where a cutting has been made for a road. If I am right in this the same conditions have endured here since the deposition of these coarse pebble beds, and there has been no \"glacial period\" here since then.\n\n15. I am one of those who believe that rock basins, which hold or have held water, commonly are glacial marks. The absence of lakes from these regions is evidence against glacial action. It has been said that depression at the upper end of a river valley, or elevation at the lower end may account for lakes like those of the Italian Alps. Here, in the dip of the Sivaliks, is evidence of such a movement; but there are no lakes, and I have seen nothing like old lake bottoms anywhere in these mountains.\n\nI am therefore confirmed in my opinion, that the Alpine lakes and Scandinavian fjords, and Scotch \"lochs\" are marks made by ancient glaciers of vast size, like those of Greenland. I have seen nothing that bears the smallest resemblance to any of these, the largest glacial marks that I know, here in the lower ranges of the Himalayas. What evidence there may be of the former extension of existing Himalayan glaciers, nearer to them, I\ndo not know from personal observation. But so far as I can learn from photographs, and from people who have travelled in these glacier regions, there is nothing near these glaciers to indicate any extension, that implies any great change in the local climate, any great elevation or a \"glacial period,\" that affected the whole world.\n\nLet me say in conclusion that this opinion founded on observation is contrary to my old opinion founded upon theory. I came prepared to find evidence of extensive glacial action here in Northern India about Lat. $30^\\circ 31'$. I have found none.\n\n---\n\nNo. 2.\n\nTHE KANGRA BIG STONES.\n\nBhagsu, November 24th, 1876.\n\n16. MY DEAR SIR,\u2014After sending you a paper from Kangra, in order to make sure of my ground I went to \"Dhada\" on the 22nd. It is otherwise named on the map, but that is the name now used here for a d\u00e2k bungalow eleven miles eastwards. I find that traditions regarding the big stones resemble traditions about like stones elsewhere. They are projectiles, about which mythical beings are concerned. One stone in particular is a \"deota\" fenced in with a square wall, painted, and adorned with flags and flowers. The large group in which it stands is said to be the site of a battle, between hill people and plain people, and these are their missiles. The holy stone was thrown down by Shiv, to a Rani who prayed to him. On that stone I found incised the \"spectacle ornament\" of Scotch antiquaries in a cartouche. It is on the west side. Some one has painted a pair of feet, to make this also a human figure and a deota. Something like the sun is painted red on the east side, and numerous devices on the south. Hanuman is on the north side of the next stone to the south. The people walk in procession sun-wise about this stone, and do puja to the pictures. I have seen nothing like this stone \"deota\" elsewhere. At Dhada is the mouth of a V gorge where the fall is about 12,000 feet in four horizontal miles, according to the map. It is a holy spot much used as a place for burning the dead, whose ashes are cast into the stream. It comes from a snow patch high up which is full of large stones. Close to the bridge I found a section of the \"Big stone formation\" and got to the solid rock surface under it, newly exposed, in a gravel pit. The stuff is sorted in layers of varying coarseness, from fine angular sand to the big stones. The bed rock is not glaciated. The thickness of the deposit may be 80 to 90 feet. Manifestly this is the apex of a Delta $\\Delta$, in the jaws of a V ravine, which has direct communication\nwith a snow patch full of big stones about 10,000 feet higher, and four or five miles distant. I am quite certain that no glacier, big enough to carry these stones, passed over the bed rock, whose surface is well preserved; below the dak bungalow at Dhada and under the stuff.\n\n17. Yesterday, 23rd.\u2014I crossed the big stone deposit close to the foot of the mountains, about four miles from the ridge, and 12,000 feet below the crest. I walked eleven miles carefully examining surfaces on stones of all sorts and sizes. I could not find one striated stone on the whole march. I found that granite pebbles as large as corn stacks abound, opposite to the longer and larger gorges which come from the snowy crest, and have the greatest fall. I found none of the kind or shape between these longer gorges, in the jaws of ravines which begin in nearer hill tops. These being slaty, send down slates of sorts, and the ground is covered with flat stones. I conclude that the ground which slopes from these hills to Kangra, is covered by a compound delta, arranged by water flowing from the whole series of streams which I crossed in walking eleven miles yesterday. I was unable to find any trace of glacial action at ten to fifteen miles from the base, or at the very base of the hills in this district.\n\n18. From here I have made a careful drawing of one of three or four high patches on which small glaciers may have rested. New snow makes them conspicuous from a distance. The rocks below them are smoother than elsewhere, and large stones rest on the rocks. These piles of stone have the look of terminal moraines in the snow. They end at about 14,000 feet above the sea-level, or 10,000 above this lower slope. I suppose that small glaciers once lay on these shelves, and that the climate has altered so as to destroy them. Far lower down I have seen hereabouts old snow resting in rock \"gulches.\" In the Alps such places are \"couloirs\" and \"chimneys.\" As a case to illustrate the effect of such conditions; I was hunting chamois many years ago in Switzerland, opposite to the Shreckhorn, and came to one of these steep narrow snow slopes. My guide told me to hurry over it. I was scarce landed on the rocks when a mass of big stones rolled and bounded past, with great and increasing velocity. Thin slaty stones had got on edge, and whirled past like flying wheels. They came from a small glacier like those of which I seem to see the beds on these Kangra hills; and they never stopped till they got to a large glacier, nine miles wide and twelve to fourteen miles long, which was some thousands of feet below us, in a valley.\n\nThat glacier was slowly carrying masses of fallen stones towards the Grimsel. Thence down to Interlaken all marks of enormous glaciation abound. A hot sun started the stone avalanche, by melting ice which supported the stones, on a small terminus moraine. This Kangra ridge is somewhat like the Shreckhorn at the top, and stone avalanches must\noften roll down on hard snow packed in narrow gulches. I notice that many of the largest stones have something like the shape of mill stones, and rest on a flat side. I think it possible that men may have seen the arrival of some of them, and that tradition ascribes their speed to \"Shiv.\" I ascribe it to gravitation.\n\n19. In the Alps and in Scandinavia I have seen many snow avalanches fall from steep hills, like those which I see from this house. If many square miles of a hill face, were swept of snow by a slide, like the roof of a house in a thaw, the snow avalanche here would certainly block up a deep water-course, form a \"bund,\" and accumulate water power. In this hot sunny region a snow dam could not last. I am told by natives that big lumps of hard snow are washed down to my road of yesterday. Ice dams have formed and burst in the Alps within human memory, and the result in the transport of rubbish was enormous. Not long ago an earthquake and heavy rains sent down from Mount Ararat a mass of snow, ice, mud, and debris, which flowed for twelve miles along a valley of less slope than the Kangra slopes below me, and carried enormous blocks of stone as far as they have been carried here. The great ridge above me has much snow on it, and may have had small glaciers high up, though no large glaciers have left marks on the hills. Causes like those which I have here indicated fully account for this big stone formation. Some probably rolled down upon snow slopes, in gulches, and rolled on over the slopes of deltas. Others may have been rolled down on the bursting of snow \"bunds,\" and may have been washed down normal slopes of gravel and sand by abnormal floods. A thunderstorm, or an earthquake may have helped in a region where the rainfall is said to be 102 inches, and where it may have been as great as it is elsewhere. A combination of such causes at long intervals, accounts for groups of large stones which I find here and there. Being exceptionally large and numerous, these seem to require exceptional conditions.\n\nIn any case I am quite certain that there is nothing on the ground which I have crossed to indicate the former presence of large glaciers on the Kangra slopes; either at 12 to 15 miles from the base of the high ridge, or at the base of it, or in the jaws of ravines which come from the crest of it, at Dhada, and elsewhere on my road thence to Bhagau.\n\n20. One of my objects in coming to India was to see for myself whether I could discover any trace of the \"Ice cap.\" Theoretically, during a glacial period, a crust of ice ten thousand feet thick came from the north pole, and went to the equator. If it did it came down the Himalayan slopes. I have now seen in India enough of jagged sierras, and of ravines of enormous depth and sharpness, of which many run from east to west, to convince me that no ice cap has crossed this region from north to south\nabout Lat $31^\\circ 2'$. It is impossible that an ice cap can have passed from Thibet, since these gorges began to be eroded. Some are three miles deep, so they must be very old. Forms which exist in the Himalayas prove the ice cap to be impossible. There is absolutely nothing here on which to found a \"Glacial period,\" which produced an \"Ice cap.\" There is no evidence, even of any great extension of local glaciers here. All the change that I can trace is the possible existence here, of small glaciers perched high up, near the crest, where snow now rests. That change of climate may have been the result of something like the atmospheric conditions which make the Sind rainfall about a fiftieth part of the rainfall here; and make the rainfall elsewhere about six times as great.\n\nI am greatly obliged to you for advising me to come here. My object is attained and very pleasantly.\n\n_Calcutta, February 14th, 1877._\u2014Had I been present at the reading of this paper, I suppose that the author's right to the last word would have been mine. I have been to Darjiling; to a fourth hill station; and I have now gained some knowledge of points in Kashmir and Bhutan fifteen meridian degrees apart. I have seen a considerable part of Ceylon, and the low country between Bombay and Lahore and along the Oudh and Rohilcund railway, opposite to Nepal. I have had the advantage of reading Hooker's journal, and Mr. Blanford's, within sight of their ground, and I have the benefit of Mr. Medlicott's criticism. I have also read papers by Major Godwin-Austen and Mr. Belt. I see no reason to alter my opinion about the Kangra \"big stones.\" I have seen many as big, in water-courses near Kursiong and Darjiling, left by streams which made the furrows and quarried the stones. The usual water-power is not sufficient to roll these big stones, because the gathering ground above them is too small in area and too low. But given a landslip, sufficient to gather a head of water, and the furrow would be swept by a flood when the dam burst. Numerous landslips of enormous size are visible from Darjiling; but the rivers Rungeet and Teesta have swept their beds clear of all obstructions. At some places very large rolled stones are left in these water-courses. But there are no deposits in the Indian plains comparable to the glacial deposits near Turin, in the Italian plains.\n\nThe burden of proof rests upon those who hold to improbabilities, and require conditions different from those which exist. So far as my facts go, they prove that Himalayan glaciers have never extended far from the regions in which glaciers now exist. These hang about the edges of great river basins, below very high gathering grounds of large area, which condense the warm damp atmosphere of the plains, and of the Southern Ocean. I have found nothing in India to prove that these conditions have altered materially since the Himalayas grew to be mountains.\nII.\u2014Note on the preceding paper.\u2014By H. B. Medlicott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of the Geological Survey of India.\n\n(Received Jan. 15;\u2014Read Jan. 17th, 1877.)\n\nMr. Campbell has kindly permitted me to add a few words to his communication, to bring out a small residuum of difference that remains between us upon the question of a former greater extension of ice action in the Himalayas. On the wider question of the Ice Cap, I would only say that I have not understood that speculation as dispensing with local centres of accumulation and dispersion, as requiring the polar ice to have poured over the Himalayas. On the smaller question too, Mr. Campbell has taken up the comparatively easy task of confuting the most extreme opinion. Although there is no mention of names, it is plain that the paper just read is a refutation of Mr. Theobald's Ancient Glaciers of the Kangra District, with a copy of which I had lured Mr. Campbell into visiting that region. I had thought indeed that I had myself said all that was called for in answer to Mr. Theobald, by pointing out that his so-called moraines were only ridges of erosion out of a diluvial deposit that must once have filled the whole valley (Rec. Geol. Survey, Vol. IX, p. 56); Mr. Campbell has, however, saved us any further trouble on that score by rehearsing all the well-known signs and tokens that must be left by a heavy glacier, and finding them wanting. In this he has entirely confirmed my own observations.\n\nI was the first (fourteen years ago, Mem. Geol. Survey, Vol. III, p. 155) to bring to notice the big stones of the Kangra valley as probably due to ice. I would beg leave to quote the few words I gave to the subject:\n\n\"The most interesting of these deposits is that in which large erratic blocks occur so abundantly along the base of the Dhaoladhar. It first shows itself on the east, about Haurbaug, and is nowhere more strikingly seen than along the steep inner slopes of the duns east of Dhurmsala, where the huge blocks are thickly scattered over the surface. In viewing this deposit as the result of glacial action, I base my opinion chiefly upon the size of the blocks (I measured one twenty-five feet by eighteen, by ten) and upon some peculiarities of distribution. An eye more practised than mine in glacial phenomena might detect more direct evidence, but it certainly is not well-marked, and it is easy to account for the subsequent removal of all such traces of glacial action in such a position as this. The blocks occur at a present elevation so low as 3,000 feet above the sea-level, and they are found through fully a thousand feet in height. They are almost exclusively composed of the granitoid gneiss of the central mass of the Dhaoladhar, from which their area of distribution is separated by a\nlofty ridge of schists, through deep gorges in which they have evidently been conveyed, a huge block being occasionally found perched on the sides of these gorges, some hundred feet above the present level of the stream; yet in such places I failed to observe any groovings or roundings of the rocky sides. The absence of evidence of this kind may, perhaps, be attributed to the rapidly disintegrating action of the heavy rains. I was many times puzzled to account for the positions in which these erratic blocks occur. They are frequently found on the slopes of the range out of the way of any of these main gorges, and even up the little receding valleys of streams, which only drain the outer hills, and down which the blocks could not have come. Must we superadd the agency of floating ice? The total absence of erratic blocks in other positions is often equally puzzling. The position of this glacial deposit more to the west, in the confined and elevated longitudinal valleys between Sihunta and Choari, impresses one more forcibly with the antiquity of its origin; it there lies in gaps and on ledges a full thousand feet over the deep drainage gullies close by.\"\n\nThus I adopted the opinion while declaring the absence of the usual scorings, and trusting to the facts of great size and peculiar distribution. The first step was an appeal against negative evidence, based upon the possible obliteration of superficial markings, by weathering and attrition, and upon the fact that although it is quite true that a large glacier must score its bed and the stones that lie thereon, transport by ice occurs largely without any such marks being made. We have recently had in India, and in this very connection of ice-action, a striking illustration of the unworthiness of such negative evidence. In 1856, Mr. W. T. Blanford declared his conviction that the Talchir boulder-bed was of glacial origin. Every year subsequently one or more of the officers of the Geological Survey were engaged upon these rocks in various parts of India, and looking out for evidence for or against this judgment, yet it was not till 1872 that Mr. Fedden had the fortune to find a most complete case of striated and polished Talchir boulders resting on a scored rock-surface. There are good specimens of these scratched boulders now in the Indian Museum. I have placed a small one on the table for inspection. In the case of the Kangra boulders, any possible glaciers in the Dhaoladhar must have been short, and have had a very rapid discharge; and consequently were of inconsiderable thickness, conditions which would reduce the scoring action to a minimum.\n\nAs to direct evidence, the matter of size of the blocks is of course conditional. On an appropriate slope masses of any dimensions may be moved with very little effort. If these Kangra big stones are, as Mr. Campbell contends, solely torrential deposits from the mountain gorges, we have only to work that simple condition so as to account for them wherever found. It is here that a slight discrepancy occurs between Mr.\nCampbell's observations and mine. He describes having taken a walk of eleven miles, and found no big stones in some minor gorges draining only from the outer ridges. Relying on this single observation, and perhaps also upon the privilege he claims as a non-professional geologist, Mr. Campbell eliminates and ignores what I have from the first said to be the chief argument for glacial action, that large blocks of the gneiss from the central ridge do frequently occur away from the gorges leading from that ridge, in minor valleys draining only from the outer ridge, where it is most difficult to suppose they can have been placed in the manner he supposes. It was to account for the position of these blocks that I had to imagine their transport on ice-rafts. Instead, however, of insisting on this crucial point, which Mr. Campbell ignores or denies, I am prepared to suggest how it may be compatible with the view he adopts. The fact that coarse diluvial deposits, not derivable from the Sivaliks, are found high over Kangra fort, on the hills south of the valley, makes it certain that the whole valley was once filled with like deposits, which must have reached high along the base and far up the gorges of the Dhaoladhar. It may be that under such conditions the diluvial spill from the gorges was high enough to mantle round and over spurs and to fill little valleys that are now totally cut off from those gorges.\n\nIt would be impossible to estimate the plausibility of this supposition without testing it on the ground in view of actual features. At the same time I think that Mr. Campbell can only make out a Scotch verdict of 'not proven' for the ice, as deeply implicated in the transport of these big stones. I cannot bring myself to doubt the evidence that has been given for the former extension of the great Himalaya glaciers to 4,000 feet lower than they at present attain to, as observed by Dr. Hooker, and by Mr. W. T. Blanford in Sikkim. At that time ice-agency must have been very active on the Dhaoladhar. If at present, as Mr. Campbell testifies, lumps of ice are brought by the torrents to the mouth of the gorges, the lumps of those days were probably large enough to pick up the big stones in their way. I would further suggest for Mr. Campbell's consideration, that so far as we can at present estimate it, the age of these high-level gravels along the base of the Himalayas, and to which the Kangra deposits belong, seems to be closely coincident with that of the Ice-Age of the western continents. An increase of glacial conditions in the Alps, corresponding to that proved for the Himalayas in Sikkim, would probably bring the ice down to Interlaken, if not to Neufchatel.\n\nI would conclude these few remarks with the hope that among the many settlers in the Kangra valley, there may be some members of this Society who will study the ground they live upon with some other purpose besides the cultivation of tea.\nIII.\u2014List of the Mollusca brought back by Dr. J. Anderson from Yunnan and Upper Burma, with Descriptions of new Species.\u2014By G. Nevill, C. M. Z. S.\n\nThe following is a list of the mollusca collected by Dr. Anderson on the two Yunnan Expeditions of 1868 and 1874, with descriptions of the new species and varieties; the greater part of the more remarkable novelties from the First Expedition have been already described by Mr. W. T. Blanford, in the P. Z. S. for 1869.\n\nI prepared this list for Dr. Anderson\u2019s work on the zoology of Yunnan and Upper Burma about a year ago; since then several of my identifications have been noted by other writers. M. Morelet especially, in a most excellent account of the mollusca of \u201cIndo-Chine,\u201d published as the 4th Livr. of the Ser. Conchil. in April 1875, with figures of the new and more important species, entirely confirms my views as to the probable identity of our common Paludina Bengalensis with species described from Sumatra, Siam, &c., as detailed further on; he records the occurrence in \u201cIndo-Chine\u201d of our Indian or Burmese Helix capitium, Pythia plicata, Planorbis exustus, P. compressus (which he identifies with P. Tondanensis from Java and P. saigonensis), Cyclophorus fulguratus, C. Bensoni (this identification I very much doubt), Ampullaria globosa and A. conica, Paludina Bengalensis with its variety polygramma, P. ampulliformis (= P. lecythis Bens., in my opinion doubtfully distinct from Gray\u2019s P. Chinenis), P. praemorsa, Bithinia goniomphalus (= B. iravadiaca), Stenothyra monilifera, Melania Touranensis (which he, no doubt correctly, believes to be only a variety of our M. variabilis), and M. spinulosa. He also anticipates in publication my views of the correct determination of the very difficult group of Neritina (Dostia) violacea: he unites into two species the three forms described and figured in this Journal for 1868 from Burma by Mr. W. T. Blanford, viz., N. violacea, Gm. (= crepidularia, Lam.) with N. drepressa, Bens., as a variety, and N. cornucopia, Bens., which he considers as specifically quite distinct, in which I decidedly agree with him, though we are both in opposition in this matter to the greatest living authority on the genus, Dr. E. von Martens, who, in his recent monograph of Neritina, for K\u00fcster\u2019s Ed. Conch. Cabinet, unites all three forms into one.\n\nThe late Prof. Deshayes in Vol. X of the Nouv. Archives du Mus\u00e9um (1876) gives a list of mollusca, collected lately in Cambodia by Dr. Jullien, in which many interesting forms, allied to our Indian genera, are fully described and figured; unfortunately, unlike M. Morelet, he entirely ignores the neighbouring Indian and Burmese regions and seeks for allied forms in South America. As well as I can judge without actual inspection\nof his types, he describes varieties of our *Paludina Bengalensis* as *P. Chalangensis* and *P. speciosa*, a variety of our *Melania variabilis* as *M. Julieni*; his *Unio anceps* is wonderfully close to some upper Burmese varieties of *U. Bonneaudi* and should be compared with it; his *U. comptus* and *U. Crossei* also require comparison with Burmese forms; the former I fear may prove identical with my *Unio fragilis*; his *Paludina obscurata* is also found in Penang, and I believe it has been previously described.\n\nA more accurate and ample report on the mollusca of the same region is published in the Journal de Conchil. for October 1876 by MM. Crosse and Fischer, in which the peculiar thick-shelled group of *Paludina Siamensis* is compared to that of the American sub-genus *Melantho*; I would call attention to the presence of a remarkable Bengal form of the same group, the *Paludina crassa* of Hutton, which has the singular habit of burying itself in closely packed groups of numerous individuals in the mud at all seasons, as accurately recorded in Hutton\u2019s excellent original description; our *Cachar Solenaia soleniformis*, Bens., so closely resembling South American species of *Mycetopus*, is also perhaps worthy of special remark in connection with MM. Crosse and Fischer\u2019s comparison of the *Unionidae* of \u201cIndo-Chine\u201d with those of South America; I would also record here that a species of *Canidia* was lately discovered in the Rangoon river by Dr. Hungerford; it is the *C. Bocourtii* of Brot (l. c., Pl. XII, fig. 6). M. Brot seems to have most thoroughly and undeniably fixed the proper systematic position of this interesting genus in the family *Buccinidae*, instead of the *Melaniidae*, where it had hitherto been classed.\n\nI have given figures in the \u2018Report on the Zoology of Yunan,\u2019 which Dr. Anderson is about to publish, of the following species described in this paper,\u2014*Helicarion resplendens*, *Trochomorpha percompressa*, *Glessula fusiformis*, *Bithynia turrita*, *Margarya melanoides*, *Paludina heliciformis*, var., *Paludomus Burmanica*, *Unio fragilis*, *U. Andersoniana*, *U. Feddeni*, and two varieties of *U. Bonneaudi*.\n\n**Trochomorpha Percompressa**, Blf.\n\n*Helix (Sicella) percompressa*, Blf. P. Z. S. 1869, p. 448.\n\nThe single type specimen in the Museum collection, found on the First Expedition at Bhamo, remains unique.\n\n**Nanina (Rotula) arata**, Blf.\n\n*Nanina (Rotula) arata*, Blf., P. Z. S. 1869, p. 448 (Bhamo).\n\n*Helix arata*, Blf., Con. Indica, pl. 82, figs. 8\u20149.\n\nVery closely allied to *N. anceps*, Gld., but may, I think, be fairly separated; the spire is considerably higher, and the base of the body-whorl more excavated round the umbilicus; the keel at the periphery is less acute\nand the epidermis appears to be darker; the sculpture is precisely similar; the Museum possesses specimens of *N. anceps* from Tenasserim, also from Moulmein. Dr. Anderson found *N. arata* tolerably abundant at Bhamo and Ponsee; the specimens from the latter locality are rather smaller and are the var. minor of Blanford.\n\n**Nanina (Macrochlamys) resplendens**, Phil.\n\n*Helix resplendens*, Phil., Zeits. Mal. 1846 (Mergui).\n\nThis species was found abundantly at Bhamo and in the second defile of the Irawady. The specimens are quite undistinguishable from others in the Museum from Mergui (typical locality). I think it doubtful if Godwin-Austen's *N. atricolor* from the Shisha Valley will prove really distinct.\n\nThe figure in the Con. Indica, pl. 5, fig. 4, is not characteristic of the species; it appears rather to represent *N. vitrinoides*.\n\n**Nanina (Macrochlamys) hypoleuca**, Blf.\n\n*Nanina (Macrochlamys) hypoleuca*, Blf., J. A. S. B. 1865 (Akoutong).\n\n*Helix hypoleuca*, Blf., Con. Indica, pl. 64, figs. 6, 7.\n\nA single specimen of this well-marked species was found at Bhamo; there are also specimens in the Museum from Pegu, Arakan, and Mergui.\n\n**Nanina (Durgella) honesta**, Gld., var. **ANDERSONIANA**.\n\n*Helix honesta*, Gld., Pr. Bost. Soc. 1844 (Tavoy).\n\n*Nanina honesta*, Gld. var., Stoliczka, J. A. S. B. 1871, pl. 17, figs. 7-9.\n\nThis species a good deal resembles an Assam form; its thicker and more shining substance, less open perforation, less oblique peristome (which is considerably more broadly reflected, nearly covering the perforation), and its possessing a whorl less will, however, distinguish it. Typical *N. honesta*, as admirably figured in the Con. Indica, pl. 90, fig. 10, is found at Pegu, Moulmein, and Thyet-Myo; var. *andersoniana* at Thyet-Myo, Sibasagar, Naga and Khasi Hills, Chittagong, and East Cachar; Dr. Anderson also found it at Ponsee, Ava, Nantin, and 2nd Defile (Irawady). This variety is distinguished by its less depressed shape, it is scarcely if at all angled at the periphery (the angulation being very distinct in type form), the peristome not quite so broadly reflected over the perforation; the substance and texture, perforation, shape of the aperture, and number of whorls are identical.\n\nType of var. *andersoniana*, from Ponsee: axis 6\u00bd, diam. 11 (apert. alt. 4, diam. 5\u00bd mil.).\n\nSpecimen from Chittagong: axis 7, diam. 13 (apert. alt. 6, diam. 6\u00bd mil.).\n\nSpecimen from Khasi Hills: axis 7, diam. 15 mil.\n\nTypical *N. honesta*, from Pegu: axis 6, diam. 12 (apert. alt. 5\u00bd, diam. 6\u00bd mil.).\nNANINA (SITALA) ATTEGIA, Bens.\n\nHelix attegia, Bens., A. & M. 1859 (Phie Than); Con. Indica, pl. 86, fig. 7.\n\nThis species was found at Prome and Bham\u00f4; the museum also possesses specimens from Moulmein, Assam, and Preparis Island.\n\nNANINA DIPLODON, Bens.\n\nHelix diplodon, Bens., A. & M. 1859, p. 187 (Teria Ghat); Con. Indica, pl. 60, fig. 8.\n\nA few specimens were found at the 2nd Defile below Bham\u00f4 and also at Ponsee in Yunnan. The outer tooth of the aperture varies slightly in shape. This species seems to be allied to the Sesara group.\n\nNANINA (ROTULA) PANSA, Bens.\n\nHelix pansa, Bens., A. & M. 1856, p. 252 (Akoutong); Con. Indica, pl. 56, fig. 1.\n\nFound at Prome and also at Kalawat.\n\nNANINA (MICROCYSTIS) BARAKPORENSIS, Pfr.\n\nHelix Barakporensis, Pfr., P. Z. S. 1862, p. 156 (Titalya, &c.); Con. Indica, pl. 87, fig. 7.\n\nNanina (Kaliella) Barakporensis, (Pfr.) Blf., J. A. S. B.\n\nA single specimen only was found at Bham\u00f4. The differences between the sub-genera Kaliella and Microcystis appear to be not yet sufficiently characterized.\n\nHELIX (PLECTOPYLIS) ANDERSONI, Blf.\n\nHelix (Plectopylis) Andersoni, Blf., P. Z. S. 1869, p. 448; Con. Indica, pl. 112, fig. 8;\n\nGodwin-Austen, P. Z. S. 1874, p. 612, pl. 74, fig. 9.\n\nThis remarkable form was not obtained on the Second Expedition; it was originally found at Hoetone and Bham\u00f4.\n\nHELIX (PLECTOTROPIS) TAPEINA, Bens.\n\nHelix tapeina, Bens., J. A. S. B. 1836, p. 362, (Sylhet).\n\nThe type specimens of Benson's H. tapeina are in the Indian Museum. Plate 15, fig. 6 of the Con. Indica well represents the form. It is distinguished from all other allied species by the less oblique columellar margin, rounded and not angular at the base (as are all its varieties); the keel at the periphery is acute. Typical H. tapeina is found abundantly at Cherra Punjee and in Assam.\n\nvar. AKOUTONGENSIS, Theob.\n\nHelix akoutongensis, Theob., J. A. S. B. 1859, p. 306; (not Con. Indica, pl. 15, fig. 4).\n\nOnly differs from the preceding by its more oblique columellar margin, more acutely keeled periphery, slightly more open umbilicus, and more depressed spire. I look upon this form as doubtfully separable from the next: the differences may be merely perhaps incidental to individuals, and not even to local races.\nDr. Anderson found this variety in Upper Burma, where it was very common. There are also specimens in the Museum from Ava and Thyet-Myo.\n\nAxis 5, diam. 15 mil.\n\nvar. ROTATORIA, Busch.\n\nHelix rotatoria, v. d. Busch., Phil. Abb. 1842 (Java); Mouss., Moll. Java, pl. 2, fig. 8.\n\nOnly distinguished from the preceding variety by the less distinct or less excavated sutures, by the very acutely keeled periphery, and by the very white, more thickened, and less rounded margins of the aperture, showing within a distinct emargination at the periphery. Plate 15, fig. 5 of the Con. Indica is an excellent representation of this form; it only differs from the figures of Mousson and Philippi by its slightly more raised spire.\n\nThere are specimens in the Museum from Prome, Akoutong, Assam, and Khasi Hills; it was also found by Dr. Anderson at Manwyne and Shan Hills.\n\nSpecimen from Akoutong, axis 6, diam. 15\u00bd mil.\n\nvar. BHAMOENSIS, nov.\n\nDistinguished from typical H. tapeina by the last whorl, which is only slightly angular and not distinctly keeled; the aperture is smaller and less produced, with the columellar margin slightly oblique and angular at base; it is smoother and less depressed than var. rotatoria, with squarer aperture and without the acute keel at the periphery. The raised spire and angulate (not keeled) periphery agree with those of H. phayrei; it is, however, smoother, less openly umbilicated, with more contracted aperture and less developed sculpture than that species.\n\nThis variety connects H. tapeina almost insensibly with H. catostoma, Blf., and its varieties; the more raised spire, less open umbilicus, and more rounded and regular margins of the aperture, without any sign of being thickened or subdentiform at their base, are the best distinguishing characteristics.\n\nFour typical specimens of this variety were found at Bham\u00f4. Major Godwin-Austen has also presented some similar specimens from the Naga Hills. Plate 15, fig. 10 of the Con. Indica looks to me as much like this variety as it does the shell it is said to represent (that is, H. Arakanensis, Theob., J. A. S. B. 1864, p. 5), from which, however, it is easily distinguished by its more open umbilicus, less conically raised spire, and by the absence of the acute keel at the periphery, &c.\n\nType from Bham\u00f4, axis 6\u00bd, diam. 12\u00bd mil.\nHelix (Plectotropis) trichotropis, Pfr.\n\nHelix trichotropis, Pfr., Zeits. Mal. 1850 (China); Conch.-Cab., pl. 134, fig. 9-10.\n\nThis species differs from H. tapeina by the shape being a trifle more trochoid, the apex more central, and the whorls more concave; the keel at the periphery is even more developed, and the aperture a trifle more produced laterally; a marked characteristic is the minute and close spiral sculpture of the base, which in H. tapeina and all its varieties is on the other hand distinctly though minutely granulose; it is principally on account of this last character that I prefer to class H. trichotropis as a distinct species, and not as a variety of H. tapeina (near rotatoria and akoutongensis.)\n\nMajor Godwin-Austen found an extremely interesting form in the Khasi Hills, with more depressed spire and thinner texture (axis 6, diam. 18 mil.) ; it is, I believe, one of these specimens that is represented in the Con. Indica (pl. 15, fig. 4) as H. akoutongensis, from Pegu. A few specimens were found by Dr. Anderson at the Second Defile, Irawady; they agree exactly with specimens in the Museum from Shanghai.\n\nSpecimen from 2nd Defile, Irawady, axis 6, diam. 15\u00bd mil.\n\nHelix (Plectotropis) perplanata, n. sp.\n\n(H. trichotropis, var. ?)\n\nFour specimens only of this very remarkable form were found at Mimboo, Upper Burma; a larger series is required to prove with certainty whether it be a distinct form, or only a variety of H. trichotropis, or of H. tapeina (near var. rotatoria).\n\nAfter a most careful examination with a lens, I am unable to trace any sculpture whatever on the base; the seven whorls above are perfectly flat, as in the European H. explanata; the keel on the periphery and the shape of the aperture are about the same as in H. trichotropis (especially the Khasi form); the umbilicus, however, is considerably more open, quite twice as open as in the Chinese and the above recorded specimens, and about half as open again as in those from the Khasi Hills; the epidermis seems peculiar, having the appearance of being less close in texture and of a decidedly more developed character.\n\nAxis 4\u00bd, diam. 17\u00bd mil.\n\nHelix (Plectotropis) oldhami, Bens.\n\nHelix Oldhami, Bens.\u2014A. & M. 1859, ser. 3, vol. III, p. 184; Con. Indica, pl. 15, fig. 7.\n\nThis species, well represented in the Con. Indica, is next allied to H. catostoma and to H. tapeina; the characters of the aperture distinguish it\nfrom the former, the very open umbilicus &c., from the latter. A single specimen was found at Ava, agreeing exactly with typical specimens from the Arakan Hills.\n\n**Helix (Plectotropis) catostoma**, Blf.\n\n*Helix (Trachia) catostoma*, Blf., P. Z. S. 1869, p. 447 (Ponsee).\n\n*H. catostoma*, Blf., Con. Indica, pl. 56, figs. 2, 3.\n\nThe specimen figured in the Con. Indica is not taken from a typical Yunnan specimen, but probably from one from Assam. The type in the Indian Museum, found at Ponsee on the First Expedition, is the only adult specimen as yet found in Yunnan; though, indeed, nine or ten immature specimens were also found, in none of which, however, are the characters of the lip developed. *H. catostoma* was found by Major Godwin-Austen and Mr. Robert tolerably abundantly in the Naga Hills, and it is probably one of these specimens that is figured as above in the Con. Indica; they only differ from the type form by the less depressed spire and slightly less open umbilicus; the characters of the aperture are the same, the dentiform process on the basal margin being equally developed and characteristic in both.\n\n**Helix (Plectotropis) huttoni**, Pfr., var. savadiensis nov.\n\n*Helix Huttoni*, Pfr., Symb. II. (Landour, &c.)\n\nThe shell represented in the Con. Indica, pl. 15, fig. 8, is not, I think, a typical specimen from the North-West Himalayas, but rather a specimen from Darjiling; the former is a smaller, more rounded, and less solid shell, scarcely keeled at the periphery, with a higher spire and less produced aperture. A form found by Dr. Anderson abundantly at Ponsee and Ava is nearer the Darjiling form; the spire is slightly higher, with the apex more central. Seven specimens of a distinct and remarkable variety were also found at Sawady; at first sight these present a curious resemblance to *H. arakanensis*, and with that species are probably the connecting link between *H. tapeina* and *H. huttoni*, though unmistakably only a variety of the latter; var. savadiensis differs by its more raised spire, stouter texture and less open umbilicus. *H. winteriana*, v. d. Busch. (Java) seems to be a var. of *H. huttoni*, differing by its more open umbilicus.\n\nSpecimen from Darjiling, axis 5\u00bd, diam. 12\u00bd mil.\n\nVar. savadiensis, from Sawady, axis 7, diam. 12\u00bd mil.\n\n**Helix (Plectotropis) Phayrei**, Theob.\n\n*Helix Phayrei*, Theob., J. A. S. B., 1859 (Ava); Con. Indica, pl. 1, fig. 15.\n\nThis is the largest species of the group, and is well figured in the Con. Indica; it appears to be rare, as three specimens from Ava are all there are in the Museum. It is next allied to typical *H. tapeina*, the umbilicus being exactly similar; the periphery, however, is merely angulate, not keeled;\nthe sculpture above is considerably coarser and more developed, the columellar margin more oblique and slightly angulate at base, and the outer margin more produced and rounded.\n\n**Helix (Trachia) delibrata**, Bens.\n\n*Helix delibrata*, Bens., J. A. S. B., 1836 (Sylhet).\n*Helix procumbens*, Gld., Proc. Bost. Soc. 1844 (Tavoy).\n\nThe types of this species from Sylhet are in the Indian Museum. It is a form with an unusually open umbilicus, a single spiral brown band, and a rather flat spire. Major Godwin-Austen has also presented similar specimens from the Khasi Hills. A closely allied form is abundant in Arakan and Bassein; this only differs by the umbilicus being a trifle less open; it is well represented in the Con. Indica, pl. 14, fig. 10. Close to both the preceding are six specimens found by Dr. Anderson at Bham\u00f4, umbilicus like that of the type form, suture a shade more excavated, slightly smaller in size. *Var. fasciata*, Godwin-Austen, J. A. S. B. 1875, pl. 1, fig. 1, is abundant at Seesbaugor in Assam; it only differs by its colouration. For the shell figured in the Con. Indica, pl. 14, fig. 9, I suggest the name of var. *khasiensis*; the raised and rounded whorls, less open umbilicus, and contracted aperture well distinguish the form; it has sometimes a single brown band, but is oftener without it; it is tolerably abundant in the Naga and Khasi Hills.\n\nType of *H. delibrata*, from Sylhet, axis 7\u00bd, diam. 21 (apert. alt. 9, diam. 11 mil.).\n\nSpecimen from Bham\u00f4, axis 6\u00bd, diam. 19 mil.\n\n*Var. khasiensis*, from Khasi Hills, axis 8\u00bd, diam. 19\u00bd (apert. alt. 9, diam. 10\u00bd mil.).\n\n*Var. fasciata*, G.-A., from Seesbaugor, axis 9, diam. 23\u00bd mil.\n\n**Helix (Ganesella) capitium**, Bens.\n\n*Helix capitium*, Bens., A. & M. 1848, ser. 2, vol. ii, p. 160 (Behar);\n*H. hariola*, Bens., A. & M., 1856, ser. 2, vol. xviii, p. 261 (Thayet Myo.)\n\nThere is no specimen in the Museum from Bengal of either of the shells called *H. capitium* or *H. hariola*, but I am informed by Mr. W. T. Blanford that he has in his collection specimens of typical *H. capitium*, from the Ganges Valley and from the Nullaymullay Hills in Southern India, and that he is convinced that the form in Upper Burma, first found by himself in 1861, cannot be distinguished. Morelet, Ser. Conch. IV, p. 254, 1875, records a most interesting locality for *H. capitium*, viz., Bangkok in Siam. On the other hand the Museum possesses both forms from Burma, from Prome the form figured in the Con. Indica, pl. 14, fig. 6, as *H. hariola*, and from Ava that figured on the same plate, fig. 5, as *H. capitium*; the latter Dr. Anderson also found at Kalawat in Upper Burma; the two forms\nseem to me perfectly identical, except that var. hariola is keeled at the periphery.\n\n**Helix (Dorcasia) similis**, F\u00e9r.\n\n*Helix similis*, F\u00e9r. Prod., 1821.\n\nFound abundantly at Prome, Pagan, Bham\u00f4, and Sanda, with and without the brown band at the periphery; specimens agree exactly with others in the Museum from Penang, Shanghai, and Thyet-Myo; specimens from Mauritius, Bourbon, Seychelles, and Brazil differ slightly, but most certainly belong to one and the same species.\n\nAxis max. 9\u00bd, diam. max. 16\u00bd (apert. alt. 8\u00bd, diam. 8\u00bd mil.).\n\n**Helix (Dorcasia) bolus**, Bens.\n\n*Helix bolus*, Bens., A. & M., 1856 (Prome).\n\n*H. tourannensis*, Soul., Voy. Bonite., Pl. 29, fig. 1-2 (Cochin China.);\nCon. Indica, pl. 23, fig. 7.\n\nDr. Anderson found this species very abundant at Pagan, Upper Burma, and at Ponsee and Sanda in Yunnan; typical specimens from Prome are exactly similar; specimens of var. *tourannensis*, from Cochin China, only differ by the spire being slightly more raised.\n\n**Helix (Dorcasia) zoroaster**, Theob.\n\n*Helix zoroaster*, Theob., J. A. S. B. 1856 (near Ava); Con. Indica, pl. 86, figs. 2, 3,\n\nThis species can be constantly distinguished from *H. similis* by its larger and more depressed form, by the considerably more open umbilicus, the more angulate last whorl, and the more produced aperture, the columellar margin of which is much more oblique. It was found abundantly at Prome, Thyet-Myo, Pagan, Tsagain, and Manwyne.\n\nAxis max. 9\u00bd, diam. max. 18\u00bd mil. (apert. alt. 9, diam. 10.)\n\n**Helix (Dorcasia) sculpturita**, Bens.\n\n*Helix sculpturita*, Bens., A. & M., 1859 (Ava); Con. Indica, pl. 53, fig. 9.\n\nThis fine species was found abundantly at Tsagain, Ava, Mandalay, and Second Defile, Irawady; it can be distinguished from both the preceding species by the rounded whorls and raised spire and by the height of the aperture; the brown band is almost always very distinct and richly coloured, in one or two specimens only is it obsolete. Though undoubtedly this and the two preceding forms are most closely connected, I consider all three at present as well-established species.\n\nAxis. max. 13, diam. max. 21\u00bd mil. (apert. alt. 11, diam. 11\u00bd).\n\n**Pupa (Cylindrus) insularis**, Ehr.\n\n*Pupa insularis*, Ehr., Symb. Phy. (Red Sea); *P. pulla*, Gray, P. Z. S. (Banks of the Ganges). *P. cylindrica*, Hut., J. A. S. B. 1834; *Buimus insularis*, Ehr., Con. Indica, Pl. 22, fig. 10.\nThis, probably our commonest Indian land-shell, was found in great abundance at Pagan, Upper Burma; very curiously neither this nor the next species are found at all in the neighbourhood of Calcutta. The Museum possesses specimens from Aden, Gwadar, Abyssinia, Sind, Kutch, Suliman Range, Trichinoply, Ceylon, Poonah, Burwani Hills, Tinali (Benares), and Saharanpur (N.W. Provinces). The Burmese localities of *P. insularis* and *P. caenopictus* now recorded, I consider particularly important and interesting. Pl. 22, fig. 10 of the Con. Indica well represents the Burmese form.\n\n**Pupa (Leucochila) caenopictus**, Hutt.\n\n*Pupa caenopictus*, Hutt., J. A. S. B. 1834 (Agra).\n*Bulimus caenopictus*, Hutt., Con. Indica, pl. 23, fig. 9.\n\nFound abundantly at Ava and Tsagain, Upper Burma; there are also specimens in the Museum from Erode, Cutch, Patna, Trichinopoly, Delhi, Quettan, Abyssinia, and Gwadar.\n\n**Pupa (Scopelophila) salwiniana**, Theo.\n\n*Pupa salwiniana*, Theo., J. A. S. B. 1870 (Shan States); Con. Indica, pl. 100, fig. 9.\n\nI found a single specimen of this interesting shell inside a *Glessula obtusa* from Bham\u00f4.\n\n**Succinea acuminata**, Blf.\n\n*Succinea acuminata*, Blf., P. Z. S., 1869, p. 449 (Ponsee); Con. Indica, pl. 68, fig. 7.\n\nFound on the First Expedition only, at Momein in Yunnan; it is a well characterized and perfectly distinct species.\n\n**Veronicella**, n. sp.\n\nTwo very fine specimens of an apparently quite new form were brought back from Ponsee, preserved in spirit; even in their present contracted state the bigger one is 93 mils. in length; I prefer not giving them a name at present, as I am not prepared to describe their anatomical characters.\n\n**Veronicella Birmanica**, Theo.\n\n*Vaginulus Birmanica*, Theo., J. A. S. B., 1864, p. 243 (Rangoon, &c.)\n\nThis species is not mentioned by M. Fischer, in his Monogr. of the genus, Nouv. Archiv, Vol. VII. Stoliczka gives further details concerning the form, J. A. S. B., 1871, p. 33. Dr. Anderson brought back eight specimens from Bham\u00f4 and Tonsine, preserved in spirit, of course; the largest measures 24 mils.\n\n**Helicarion resplendens**, n. sp.\n\nShell in texture and colour resembling *Helic gigas*, Bens., but a little thinner and more membranaceous; it is at once distinguished from it\nby its flattened, more ear-like and appressed shape. It also somewhat resembles *Helic. Peguensis*, Theob., J. A. S. B. 1834, p. 8, from Prome; it is, however, a larger and thicker shell, with the whorls of the spire much broader and more distinct, and considerably less open at the base; in many respects it is intermediate between the above two species, though all three are easily recognisable and quite distinct.\n\nType of *Helic. resplendens*, diam. max. 22, lat. 14, crass. 8 mil.\n\n*Helic. gigas*, (small specimen), diam. 22, lat. 16, crass. 10 mil.\n\n*Helic. Peguensis*, diam. 17, lat. 10, crass. 5 mil. (a rather larger specimen than the type).\n\nFour specimens of this interesting form were found at Sawady. Dr. Anderson also brought back a single specimen (in spirit) from Bham\u00f4 (5000 ft.) which clearly shows the animal to be of a light pinkish colour, very sparsely dotted with black specks, except on the mantle lobes and caudal extremity, which are thickly dotted; in this specimen the spire of the shell only is covered by the animal, though the mantle lobe has no doubt shrunk.\n\n**Helicarion gigas**, Bens., var.\n\n*Vitrina gigas*, Bens., J. A. S. B., 1836, p. 350 (Sylhet).\n\nA single specimen was found at Kyoukphoo; though differing slightly, it is so close to the shell of typical *Helic. gigas*, that I think there can be little doubt of their identity.\n\nDiam. 35\u00bd, axis 8\u00bd; apert. lat. 27\u00bd, alt. 21 mil.\n\n**Helicarion magnificus**, n. sp., G. A. and Nev.,\n\nI am indebted to Major Godwin-Austen for pointing out that this magnificent slug, the largest yet known of the genus, is quite distinct from Benson's *Helic. gigas* (Khasi Hills); Godwin-Austen has kindly undertaken to describe the animal with full details and a figure, so that it is only necessary for me here to state that it is very closely allied to the Assam species, but that the shell is much larger, of a brown (not green) colour, with the body-whorl much more flatly expanded, and the spire less convoluted and more depressed, and that, looked at from underneath, very much less of the reflected body-whorl is visible.\n\nThe largest specimen, in spirit, measures 70 mils.\n\nShell, diam. maj. 46, axis, 11\u00bd; apert. lat. 40\u00bd, alt. 29\u00bd mil.\n\nTolerably abundant at Momein in Yunnan, at 5,500 ft.\n\n**Helicarion venustum**, Theob.\n\n*Vitrina (?) venustum*, Theob., J. A. S. B. 1870, p. 400 (Arakan).\n\n? *Helic. solidum*, G. A., P. Z. S., 1873 (Hengdan).\n\nDr. Anderson brought back, from Ponseo in Yunnan, numerous specimens (preserved in spirit) of a small form, the shell of which I am unable\nto distinguish from typical Arakan specimens of *Helic. venustum*, only differing in apparently being of a smoother and more polished texture and in the spire being a shade more distinctly convoluted; a single specimen of *Helic. solidum* from the Naga Hills is quite undistinguishable from the above Arakan specimens. The figures in the Con. Indica of the two forms are however so distinct that the types will have to be re-examined. Dr. Anderson also brought back a small specimen (in spirit) of apparently the same form from Nampura in the Kakhyen Hills, found under stones near running water; the animal of this specimen differs from that of my *Helio. resplendens* in apparently completely covering the shell and in being of a duskier, more uniform colouration, apparently not speckled at all, but of a darker tinge on the mantle lobes and caudal extremity than on the rest of the foot; this as far as it goes would seem to agree fairly with the original description of the animal of *Helic. solidum*, J. A. S. B. 1875.\n\n**Helicarion (Cryptosoma) prestans**, Gld.\n\n*Vitrina prestans*, Gld., P. Bost. Soc. 1843, p. 100 (Tavoy); Con. Indica, pl. 65, figs. 5, 6.\n\nThe entire shell is covered with a thick and compact brown epidermis; the largest specimen in the Museum, from Tenasserim, measures, axis 27\u00bd diam. 31\u00bd mil. It is an extremely abundant species in Tenasserim, and also near Moulmein; Dr. Anderson found it abundant at Sawady and on the banks of the Irawady, Second Defile.\n\n**Ennea (Huttonella) bicolor**, Hutt.\n\n*Pupa bicolor*, Hutt., J.

Iconica'; probably *L. andersoniana* will prove to be a common species throughout S. China.\n\nThe late Dr. Stoliczka has since collected a perfectly identical form at Yarkand, as well as a variety at Kashgar, the latter interesting as possessing a very small umbilicus; *L. andersoniana* appears to be next allied to *L. pervia*, Mart. (? = *L. Davidi*, Desh.) and will require further comparison with type specimens of the two latter.\n\nLong. 10, diam. 6\u00bd; apert. long. 7\u00bd, diam. 3\u00bd mil.\n\nAbundant at Sanda and Nantin in Yunnan, at 4000 feet.\n\n**Limnaea Yunnanensis**, n. sp.\n\nShell medium-sized, ovately oblong, imperforate, pale horn-colour, very fragile, spire acuminate; whorls three to four, last whorl remarkably small; columella very strongly twisted and much produced, aperture very elongate contracted anteriorly, broadly and beautifully regularly rounded at base.\n\nThis species is closely allied to the shell figured by H. Adams, 'P. Z. S.' for 1866, as *L. Swinhoei* from Formosa; it also resembles pl. 4, fig. 25b\nin the 'Conch. Iconica,' but not fig. 25a, which belongs apparently to a distinct species; *L. yunnanensis* may eventually prove to be an extreme variety of *L. swinhoei*, characterized by the smaller body-whorl, by the aperture being more contracted anteriorly and more rounded posteriorly, finally by the slightly more twisted columella. I have little doubt that *L. swinhoei* itself is only a synonym of *L. flava*, Phil., Zeits. Mal. 1851, p. 78. (I. Liew-kieu); certain it is that a shell sent me by M. Morelet, under the latter name from China, agrees exactly with Mr. Adams' figure in the 'P. Z. S.'; Sowerby in the 'Conch. Iconica,' in his usual careless and worthless style, records and figures a species as *L. flava*, Morl.?\n\nLong. 16, diam. 10; apert. long. 11\u00bd, diam. 7 mil.\n\nAt Sanda in Yunnan.\n\n**Limnea acuminata**, Lam., var. **rufescens**, Gray.\n\n*Limnea rufescens*, Gray, Sowerby, Gen.

Indica, pl. 33, fig. 1, (not *C. eximius*, Mouss.)\n\nThe Museum is indebted to Dr. Oldham for several fine specimens of a form of this handsome species collected in Assam by Mr. Masters; they agree exactly in every respect with the type form, having light yellow-coloured apertures, &c., only they are a trifle larger in size; it is probably one of these specimens which is figured in the 'Con. Indica,' pl. 33, figs.\nit differs widely from Mousson's Javan species, by the acutely angled periphery, by its much more open umbilicus, and by the broad basal band, &c. A large series of a fine variety of this species has also been presented to the Museum by Mr. S. E. Peal, from the Naga Hills; this variety is of a slightly less depressed form, the umbilicus a trifle less open, but its most marked characteristic is the more circular aperture, which is of a deep crimson colour; I suggest that this handsome form be known as *C. sublavigatus*, var. *Pealiana*, after its discoverer. *C. balteatus*, Bena., from Pegu, is an extremely closely allied species.\n\nType, from Upper Burma, axis 29, diam. 46 mil.\nLarge form from Assam, axis 31, diam. 57 mil.\nType of var. *Pealiana*, from the Naga Hills, axis 30, diam. 56 mil.\n\n**Cyclophorus fulguratus**, Pfr.\n\n*Cyclophorus fulguratus*, Pfr., P.

Iravadica with typical specimens of B. goniomphalus from Cochin China (received from M. Morelet), prove the two species to be perfectly identical. Specimens from Siam of B. Siamensis, Lea (also received from M. Morelet), are exceedingly closely allied, and may prove to be only a variety; they differ, however, by their smaller size, and by the last whorl being rounded and not angulate, as is the case in B. goniomphalus. This species was obtained abundantly by Dr. Anderson at Ava, Mandalay, and Kabyuet.\n\nBithynia turrita, Blf.\n\nFairbankia? (Bithynia) turrita, Blf., P. Z. S., 1869, p. 448 (Kyoutong).\n\nThis most distinct and interesting species was not found on the Second Expedition; the single type in the Indian Museum, therefore, remains unique. The species is, I think, a true Bithynia, certainly not a Fairbankia. It was found at Kyoutong in Upper Burma.\n\nBithynia moreletiana, n. sp.\n\nIn shape resembling B. lutea, Gray, (Con. Indica, pl. 37, fig. 7); spire peculiarly short, apex very obtuse and flattened, always eroded, but not decollated; whorls 3\u00bd, the last obliquely produced; always imperforate, both in very young and very old shells; margins of aperture entire, broad-\nly reflected, produced and angled at base, outer margin rounded; epidermis dark olive-green; under the lens a minute spiral sculpture can be detected. Young specimens invariably show a sort of varix, formed probably at a period when their growth is arrested by some cause; this varix becoming absorbed in adult specimens. Above 200 specimens were found at Yaylay-maw.\n\nLong. max. 8\u00bd, min. 7\u00bd, diam. max. 6, min. 7\u00bd mil; long. anfract. ult. 7; long. apert. 5\u00bd, diam. 3 mil.\n\nThis species can easily be distinguished from the Indian *B. cerameopoma* and *B. lutea*: it is imperforate, has fewer whorls, a shorter and more obtuse spire, the columellar margin is less acutely angled at base, the epidermis green instead of brown.\n\n**Margarya**, n. gen.\n\nThis remarkable shell is very difficult to classify, owing to its great analogy to two fresh-water genera, *Paludina* and *Melania*. I think, however, there is little doubt but that it will have eventually to rank as a subgenus of *Paludina*. *Margarya*, so named in honour of its discoverer, who unfortunately shortly after was murdered near Momein by the Chinese, is characterized by its produced, melania-like spire, composed of scalariform, rapidly increasing whorls, with very distinct suture; apex obtuse; sculptured with prominent spiral ribs; rimate (or umbilicate?); margins of aperture rounded, not continuous; animal and operculum unknown.\n\n**Margarya melanioides**, n. sp.\n\nShell large, spire produced, melania-like, with very deeply excavated suture, apex obtuse; whorls six, convex, the first two flat and obtuse, the third large and tumid (bigger in proportion than the fourth); the four last whorls are girt with three nearly equally distant, raised, irregularly nodulose keels, the middle one much the largest, having its nodules more developed and of a more or less compressedly transverse shape; umbilicus very small, almost entirely covered by the reflected columella; aperture almost circular, nearly as broad as high; columella short, evenly rounded, moderately reflected over the shallow umbilicus; a slight callous between the columella and outer lip; remains of an epidermis distinctly traceable.\n\nA broken specimen of four whorls only, long. 67, diam. 47; anfract. ult. 44; apert. alt. 28\u00bd, lat. 27\u00bd mil.\n\nA perfect, but not quite adult, specimen (6 whorls), long. 52, diam. 34; anfract. ult. 35\u00bd; apert. alt. 23 mil.\n\nFour dead and water-worn specimens of this exceedingly interesting new form were picked up on the shores of Lake Tali in Yunnan by the late Mr. Margary and were given by him to Dr. Anderson, who has expressed\nhis desire that the form should be named in honour of the unfortunate discoverer.\n\n**Paludina Chinensis**, Gray, var. **ampulliformis**, Sow.\n\n*Paludina Chinensis*, Gray, Griff.

Indica, pl. 77, fig. 7 (Upper Burma).\n\nThe types of Benson\u2019s *P. lecythis* are in this Museum; they are a very large, globose, and thin form of *P. chinensis*; pl. 76, fig. 6, in the \u2018Con. Indica\u2019 fairly represents Benson\u2019s form; this variety has been recently rediscovered in India by Major Godwin-Austen, who found it at Munipur; Benson\u2019s types of *P. lecythis* were more probably found in the same locality, than in Sylhet proper.\n\nFound in great abundance, about 5000 ft. above the sea, at Nantin, Mungla, Momein, and Hotha in Yunnan; there are two forms existing everywhere together which pass by insensible gradations the one into the other: one is a short tumid variety like typical *P. lecythis*, but of stouter texture and with the whorls much more distinctly angulate, appearing to me to be the form called *P. ampulliformis* by Souleyet: the other has a more produced spire, resembling that of *P. lecythoides*; apparently both Yunnan forms can be distinguished from Chinese specimens by the markedly shorter last whorl, some one or two, however, show in this respect so close an approach to var. *lecythoides* that I am afraid the character cannot be relied upon to separate *P. chinensis* and its var. *lecythoides* from var. *lecythis* and var. *ampulliformis*.\n\n**Paludina dissimilis**, M\u00fcll., var. **decussatula**, Blf.\n\n*P. dissimilis*, var. *decussatula* (vel *P. decussatula*), Blf., P. Z. S. 1869, p. 445, (Ava).\n\nDiffers from *P. heliciformis*, v. Fr. by the less rounded whorls, by the more produced and not decollated spire, and by the less distinct angulation at the periphery, which is distinctly banded with a white belt, obsolete in the Pegu form. Both differ from typical Bengal *P. dissimilis* (*P. praemorsa*, Bens.) by the considerably more developed sculpture, more angular last whorl, less rounded aperture, and less open umbilicus, and by the more uniform green colouration; the white belt is also less distinct than it is in most Bengal specimens; it is even less like the South Indian var. *variata* and var. *obtusa*.\n\nCommon at Ava and Bhamo.\n\n**var. viridis**, Rv.\n\n*P. viridis*, Hanl. MSS., Rv., Con.

A few specimens only were found at Kabuyet.\n\nLong. 29\u00bd, diam. 21 mil.\n\n**Paludina Siamensis**, v. Fr., var.?\n\n*Vivipara Siamensis*, v. Fr., Zool.-bot. Ges., Wien, 1865, pl. 22, (Siam).\n\nThe Museum possesses a single typical specimen from Siam, which seems to present no distinctive characters, except in its greater size, from the numerous, but all unfortunately young, specimens found alive at the Second Defile of the Irawady and at Yaylaymaw.\n\n**Paludina Bengalensis**, Lam., var. **doliaris**, Gld.\n\n*Paludina bengalensis*, Lam., var. *digona*, Blf., P. Z. S., 1869, (Bham\u00f4.)\n\n*P. doliaris*, Gld., Proc. Bost. Soc., vol. I. p. 144.\n\nCountless varieties of this well known shell are to be found everywhere throughout the Indian region. The form from Bham\u00f4, called var. *digona* by Mr. Blanford, the type of which is in the Museum, is very incorrectly figured in the 'Con. Indica,' pl. 115, fig. 7, the characteristic angulation of the last whorl not being shown; it is apparently the widest spread variety of all; in the Museum are specimens almost undistinguishable from one another from Calcutta, Mandalay, and Siam (received from Morelet as \"P. lineolata, Mouss.\"). A small and less angular form of var. *digona* was obtained at Myadong, having the last whorl more produced and separated. Another form sent me by M. Morelet from Cochin China as \"P. polygramma, Mart.\", is also found in Pegu and Calcutta. An interesting form near var. *digona* was found at Shuaygoomyo: it differs by the remarkably developed transverse sculpture, by the peculiar green of the epidermis, which has less of a yellow tinge, and by the umbilicus being more open than in any other specimens I have seen of this protean shell; this form is near *P. oxytropis*, Bens. (Con. Indica, pl. 76, fig. 5) from Muni-p\u00fbr, though the latter I consider a good and distinct species. Since the preceding was written, M. Morelet has suggested (Ser. Conch. IV, p. 306), that probably both *P. polygramma* and *P. lineolata* are merely varieties of *P. Bengalensis*; he states that both forms are found in Cochin China, and he identifies the two former for certain as merely varieties of *P. sumatrensis*, Dkr., Mal. Bl. 1852.\n\n**Melania (Striatella) Tuberculata**, M\u00fcll.\n\n*Nerita tuberculata*, M\u00fcll., Hist. Verm., p. 191, (Coromandel).\n\nTwo forms of this very common and variable shell were found abundantly in the old channel of the Irawady at Myadoung; the commoner of the two somewhat resembles pl. 74, fig. 1, of the 'Con. Indica,' but is more richly coloured, with the brown band at base remarkably broad and\ndistinct; the whorls are a little narrower and more produced, the transverse ridges very acute and prominent, the longitudinal ribs nearly, or altogether, obsolete on the last two or three whorls; the upper two or three whorls are, as usual, decollated.\n\nLong. max. 27\u00bd, diam. 9 mil.\n\nThe other form is shorter and more rounded, of a pale green, with scarcely any brown spots or markings and with the basal band nearly, or altogether, obsolete; the transverse ridges are irregular and less acute, the longitudinal ribs, on the contrary, strongly developed, becoming obsolete only below the middle of the last whorl; decollated like the preceding.\n\nLong. max. 20, diam. 8 mil.\n\n**Melania (Melanoides) Jugicostis**, Bens.\n\n*Melania jugicostis*, Bens. MS., Con. Indica, pl. 110, figs. 8, 9. (Tenasserim Rv.).\n\nUnfortunately, only two specimens of this interesting species were brought back by Dr. Anderson; they were found at Myadoung with the preceding and following species. The species seems to me to belong rather to *Melanoides* than to *Plotia*; it certainly a good deal more resembles the Chinese *M. cancellata*, Bens., than *Plotia scabra*; in either case it is a very distinct and well characterized species, and is admirably figured in the 'Con. Indica.' Shell small, slightly decollated; whorls five, abruptly angular, smooth and shining, with a few rather distant, somewhat obsolete and irregular, transverse ridges on the lower half of the last whorl; longitudinally angularly ribbed, ribs very distant, thick and prominent, almost varicose, eight of them on the last whorl, disappearing towards the base; very pale green, with no markings except a subobsolete brown band at base.\n\nLong. 12, diam. 6 mil.\n\n**Melania (Melanoides) Iravadica**, Blf.\n\n*Melania Iravadica*, Blf., P. Z. S., 1869; Con. Indica, pl. 71, fig. 1.\n\nThis seems to me to be the Upper Burmese form of a shell described by Gould as *M. baccata*, Proc. Bost. Soc., 1847. Mr. Theobald has presented a series to the Museum from the Upper Salween River, well figured in the 'Con. Indica,' pl. 75, figs. 8, 11 and by Brot in the 'Conch. Cabinet,' pl. 9, fig. 6; at first sight they seem to differ considerably from the form described as *M. Iravadica*; there is scarcely, however, any real difference, except the larger size and more distinct sculpture of typical *M. baccata*, which has three rows of nodules, the upper one of which is altogether obsolete in *M. Iravadica*; in one or two specimens, however, of the former this row is also obsolete. The type specimens of *M. Iravadica* are in the Indian Museum.\nTypical *M. baccata*, of three whorls only, long 38\u00bd, diam. 20 mil.\n\n*M. Iravadica*, from Yaylaymaw, of three whorls only, long. 30, diam. 17 mil.\n\nAt the latter locality the species was found in great abundance by Dr. Anderson on the Second Expedition, as it was also on the First Expedition at Bham\u00f4 and Manwyne; the small specimens, so well figured by M. Brot (Mat\u00e9r. M\u00e9l. iii, pl. 4, figs. 12\u201413) were from the latter locality; these specimens had been given in exchange by the Museum to the late Dr. Stoliczka, by whom they were sent to M. Landauer.\n\n**Melania (Melanoides) Reevei**, Brot.\n\n*Melania (Melanoides) Reevei*, Brot, Mat\u00e9r. M\u00e9l. i., p. 46 and Conch.

Indica,' pl. 72, fig. 3. It is a well characterized species, quite distinct from *M. variabilis*, *peguensis*, and *gloriosa*, and of these three it is nearest allied to the last. There are specimens in the Museum from Noung-benzick in Pegu; it was also obtained plentifully at Mandalay on the First Expedition, and on the Second Expedition at Myadoung.\n\n**var. Imbricata**, Hanl.\n\n*Melania Reevei*, var., Brot., Conch. Cab., pl. 11, fig. 4 A.\n\n*Melania Reevei*, var. imbricata, Con. Indica, pl. 153, fig. 4.\n\nAbout twelve specimens of this variety were obtained at Yaylaymaw. It can be easily distinguished from the type form by its more developed sculpture; it has the same characteristic regular transverse ridges below the suture (four or five in number), but in addition has throughout other interrupted transverse ridges, broader than those near the suture and wider apart; it has also numerous longitudinal ribs, possessing a tendency at times to become obsolete (varying much in this respect in individual specimens), these ribs commence at the termination of the sutural row of regular transverse ridges, and are generally distinct only on the last few whorls; the columella is stained a rich brown colour.\n\nVar. *imbricata*, of nine whorls, long. 65, diam. 26 mil.\n\n**Melania (Plotia) Scabra**, M\u00fcll.\n\n*Buccinum scabrum*, M\u00fcll., Hist. Verm., p. 136 (Coromandel); Con. Indica, pl. 73, figs. 1-4.\n\n*Melania scabra*, M\u00fcll.\n\nA few specimens were found at Myadoung; they agree perfectly with Reeve's fig. 156 B (*M. spinulosa*, Lam.).\nPALUDOMUS ANDERSONIANA, n. sp.\n\nLarge and globose; spire produced and pointed; of a very striking greenish yellow colour, with four intense black bands on the last whorl, the one at the suture and the two near the base about the width of the broadest band on *P. ornata*; the second band from the suture twice this width, this latter, in all but very old specimens, is very distinctly visible within the aperture; whorls seven, the first two or three generally decollated, transversely superficially ridged, ridges more or less obsolete towards the centre of the upper whorls, one of them below the suture more prominent than the rest; columella pure white; the operculum constantly differs on its inner side from those of the other Burmese species by the remarkably raised and very rugose nucleolar portion and by the distinct, though minute, granular margin. Dr. Anderson obtained several hundred specimens in all stages of growth at Mandalay, Ava, Bham\u00f4, Kabyuet, and Myadoung. One of the best distinguishing marks from its var. *Peguensis* is the great width within the aperture of the second brown band; the band nearest the base, on the other hand, is comparatively smaller; in *P. Peguensis* (even in young specimens) the two upper bands are altogether wanting, the third very narrow, the last broad and diffused over the basal portion of the columella. This is probably the *Paludomus* sp. of Theobald from the Shan States, J. A. S. B., 1865, p. 264.\n\nLong. max. 29, diam. max. 22 mil.\n\nVar. PEGUENSIS (an sp. n.?)\n\n*Paludomus regulata*, Bens., var., Con. Indica, pl. 108, fig. 6.\n\nDiffers from the preceding by the slightly more rugose sculpture, by its more decollated apex, by the less cylindrical whorls and less produced and pointed spire (more apparent in young specimens), by the columella being apparently invariably faintly stained with brown, by the almost entire apparent absence of colouration on the last whorl, especially in the absence of the second broad band within the aperture. Unfortunately, all the specimens have lost their opercula. The specimen figured in the 'Con. Indica' is a very old decollated one.\n\nType of variety from Pegu, long. 21, diam. 16 mil.\n\nPALUDOMUS ORNATA, Bens.\n\n*Paludomus ornata*, Bens., A. & M., 1856, 498; Con. Indica, pl. 108, fig. 8.\n\nSpecimens of this very handsome species from Ava, Pegu, and Mandalay are in the Museum Collection; it is well characterized by its seven produced and solid whorls, acute and prominent spire; the Ava specimens are not decollated, though quite adult; those from the other two localities\nhave, however, all lost their first three or four whorls; both young and old shells are perfectly smooth, with the exception of a deeply incised spiral groove below the suture; the figure in the Con. Indica, pl. 108, fig. 8, is excellent; perhaps it scarcely shows sufficiently clearly the three broad spiral brown bands; from the peculiar thickness, even of young shells, these bands are, however, often scarcely visible; the operculum resembles that of *P. regulata*, Bens., only it is little flatter, both differ considerably from that of *P. Andersoniana*, being much smoother on their inner side.\n\nLong. 24, diam. 16 mil.\n\n**Paludomus regulata**, Bens.\n\n*Paludomus regulata*, Bens., A. & M., 1856, p. 496; Con. Indica, pl. 108, fig. 5.\n\nThis species was not obtained by Dr. Anderson; the Museum, however, possesses some hundred specimens from Prome and Thyet-Myo in Pegu; the specimens from the latter locality are typical ones from the collection of Mr. Theobald; the shell is admirably figured as above in the 'Con. Indica'; the spiral, broad, flattened ridges throughout are very characteristic, as is also its slightly compressed, angular shape; the operculum differs from that of *P. Andersoniana*, by being more concave and less broad on its inner side, the nucleolar part is less raised and much more rugose, the broad polished margin (under the lens) is destitute of sculpture, instead of being minutely granular.\n\nLong. max. 24\u00bd, diam. 16 mil.\n\n**Paludomus Burmanica**, n. sp.\n\nShell small, very thick, spire depressed, in shape closely resembling the European *Litorina obtusata*; only two whorls, the others decollated in both young and old specimens; smooth, with a few irregular striae at suture; columella very thick, pure white; aperture somewhat compressed, as in typical *P. labiosa*, not globose expanded as in *P. Blanfordiana*; in all the ten specimens found, only three instead of four bands, the upper one exceedingly broad, covering nearly half the last whorl, the middle one narrow, the basal one broad, but not diffused over any part of the columella, these bands are of the most intense black within the aperture, even in very old, thick specimens; epidermis unusually thick, dark olive-green, closely covered with regular raised pustules of a lighter colour.\n\nYaylaymaw and also Mandalay.\n\nLong. 14\u00bd, diam. 12 mil.\n\nThe operculum is like that of *P. regulata*, a shade darker in colour, nucleolar portion on the inner side a little more distinctly spirally rugose. The broad and richly coloured bands (only three in number), pure white columella, and peculiar epidermis are the principal distinguishing characters from typical Tenasserim *P. labiosa*; it is, I consider, quite distinct from *P. Blanfordiana*.\nPALUDOMUS BLANFORDIANA, n. sp.\n\nPaludomus labiosa, Con. Indica, pl. 108, fig. 9, (not of Bens.) \"Tongoop.\"\n\nThere are good many specimens in the Museum from Pegu and Ava, also from Gowhatta in Assam, agreeing exactly with the shell figured as above in the 'Con. Indica'; there are also seven typical specimens of *P. labiosa*, collected by Mr. Theobald in Tenasserim; these latter are a good deal smaller and less angularly globose than the Pegu species, their columella is more vividly stained with brown, the brown bands are less regular and distinct (showing in an especially marked way within the aperture), and finally both young and old specimens are truncated, which is apparently never the case with the former; the sculpture of both is the same, quite smooth, except for a few irregular spiral strie below the suture; the typical specimens of *P. labiosa* are without opercula; those of *P. Blanfordiana* resemble opercula of *P. regulata*, though they are even less rugose, the spiral strie of the nucleolar portion of the inner side being distinct and regular (seen through the lens).\n\n*P. labiosa* from Tenasserim, long. max. 12\u00bd, diam. 10;\n*P. Blanfordiana*, type from Ava, long. max. 19, diam. 15 mil.;\n*P. Blanfordiana*, var. from Assam, long. 20, diam. 15 mil.\n\nThis species resembles as closely *P. ornata* as it does typical Tenasserim *P. labiosa*; specimens from Assam differ in no respect from Burmese ones, except by the spire being a trifle more produced, this locality for the species is interesting, it appears to be very abundant there.\n\nAMPULLARIA THEOBALDI, Hanl.\n\n*A. Theobaldi*, Blf., Con. Indica, pl. 115, fig. 2, (Loc. ?)\n*A. maura*, Rv., var., Con. Icon. fig. 57 (Loc. ?)\n\nUnfortunately none of the 16 specimens collected by Dr. Anderson at Bham\u00f4 are quite full-grown, the outer lip in all of them being thin and sharp; in the depression of the spire they agree with Reeve's figure of *A. maura*, as well as the typical figure of *A. Theobaldi*; the umbilicus is open, agreeing exactly with the latter figure; the colouration and shape of the aperture are also the same; I think it very doubtful, however, if it can be separated as a distinct species from the common Assam form, from which it only seems to differ by its larger size, less produced spire, slightly more open umbilicus, and in the colouration being a shade more vivid; in the latter two respects, however, some few Assam specimens approximate most closely.\n\nUNIO MARGINALIS, Lam., var. SAVADIENSIS, nov.\n\n*Unio marginalis*, Lam., Anim. s. Vert.; Con. Indica, pl. 9, fig. 6, (sp. juv.)\n\nThis variety is abundant at Sawady in the Thengleng stream, also at Bham\u00f4 and at Shuaygoomyo; four young specimens found at Myadoung\nprobably also belong to this form. The nearest figured variety is *obesa*, Hanl., Con. Indica, pl. 44, fig. 7, from the Irawady; var. *savadiensis* is of a more ovate shape, of a slightly thinner texture, the nacre is of a light salmon- or cream-colour, instead of the ordinary bluish white tinge characteristic of var. *obesa*, the difference of colour in the nacre is constant both in young and old shells; the lateral teeth are more convex, the cardinal ones a little less strongly developed; young specimens of both varieties are prominently winged, as in var. *lamellatus*, pl. 44, fig. 7, of the Con. Indica; externally young specimens are of a gamboge-yellow colour, tinged with bright green on the wing.\n\nLong. max. 118, lat. max. 68 mil.\n\n**var. Corrianus, Lea.**\n\n*Unio Corrianus*, Lea, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. V., pl. 9, fig. 25;\n*U. marginalis*, var. *Corriana*, Con. Indica, pl. 44, fig. 4.\n\nFour magnificent specimens of this very marked variety were found at Yaylaymaw; the nacre is of the most beautiful salmon-pink colour; the only difference from typical Bengal specimens is that the texture and teeth are thicker, and this is the case also with specimens from Pegu.\n\nLong. 115, lat. 55 mil.\n\n**Unio Feddeni, Theob.**\n\n*Unio Feddeni*, Theob., J. A. S. B. 1873, pl. 17, fig. 3.\n\nTolerably abundant in paddy-swamps at Bham\u00f4, also at Yaylaymaw. I feel quite sure that Mr. Theobald is wrong in recording this species as found in the Pemgunga, Central India; typical specimens from Mr. Fedden are marked in the carefully kept collection of Mr. H. F. Blanford as from Burmah; the specimens found by Dr. Anderson in Upper Burmah confirm Mr. Blanford's record of the locality of the original type form, as opposed to that given by Mr. Theobald; Mr. Fedden collected in both localities.\n\n**Unio Burmanus, Blf.**\n\n*Unio Burmanus*, Blf., P. Z. S., 1869, p. 450 (Bham\u00f4); Con. Indica, pl. 42, fig. 1.\n\nThis form was not found on the Second Yunnan Expedition. Full-grown shells are narrower and more produced, with the umbones much less prominent, and the rugose sculpture also less developed than is the case with *U. Bhamoensis*.\n\nThe types of *U. Burmanus* from Bham\u00f4 are in the Indian Museum.\nUnio Bhamoensis, Theob.\n\nUnio Bhamoensis, Theob., J. A. S. B., 1873, p. 207, pl. 17, fig. 1.\nUnio Mandelayensis, Theob., J. A. S. B., 1873, p. 208, pl. 17, fig. 2.\n\nNot uncommon at Myadoung and Yaylaymaw; found also on the First Expedition at Mandalay, Bham\u00f4, and Shienpagah. The two above forms can certainly not be separated, as indeed might have been surmised from Mr. Theobald's remarks in the original description, large series from one locality showing that both varieties run one into the other. The Pegu form mentioned in the original description of U. Bhamoensis differs a good deal more from both than the Bham\u00f4 from the Mandalay one; it is a pity Mr. Theobald did not give this Prome variety a name, instead of the Bham\u00f4 one.\n\nUnio Fragilis, n. sp.\n\n? Unio foliaceus, Gld., Proc. Bost. Soc.; Con. Indica, pl. 42, fig. 3.\n? U. Peguensis, Anth., Am. J. Con., pl. 25, fig. 2.\n\nTen specimens from Yaylaymaw only differ from the Pegu form, in that the epidermis, except on the posterior angle, is quite smooth; unfortunately they all seem young shells; the two biggest are exceptionally tumid, in this respect differing from the others, as also from the Bham\u00f4 and Sheinpagah specimens; in all of the above the nacre is less yellow-tinged towards the umbones, and the teeth thinner than in U. foliaceus. It is a form extremely close to, if not identical with, the U. comptus, Desh. (Nouv. Archives X, Pl. 6, fig. 3\u20144), stated by MM. Crosse and Fischer to be the U. Sumatrensis of Lea.\n\nType of U. fragilis from Yaylaymaw: long. 34, lat. 17\u00bd, crass. 11\u00bd mil.\n\nThree specimens from Bham\u00f4, all young: long. max. 43, lat. 24, crass. 13 mil.\n\nThirty specimens from Shienpagah, all young: long. max. 32, lat. 17, crass. 9\u00bd mil.\n\nSpecimens of U. foliaceus, from Pegu, long. 58, lat. 22, crass. 17 mil.\n\nUnio Pugio, Bens.\n\nUnio pugio, Bens., A. & M., 1862, p. 193; Con.

It varies considerably in being more or less rugose in sculpture.\n\nLong. max. 52, lat. max. 29, crass. 24 mil.\n\n**Unio Andersoniana**, n. sp.\n\nThis species was found at Myadoung in tolerable abundance, together with *U. Bonneaudi* and several other species; two specimens were also obtained on the First Expedition at Shienpagah. It is next allied to *U. pachysoma*, Bens., and to some of the varieties of *U. coruleus*, Lea. It is easily distinguished from *U. Bonneaudi* by its more irregular shape, thinner texture by the acute angulation, greater production posteriorly, and by the more developed sculpture; a constant character also is the pink colour of the nacre, which in *U. Bonneaudi* is bluish white, this is equally distinct and characteristic in young as in old specimens.\n\nType from Myadoung, long. 32, lat. 15\u00bd, crass. 11\u00bd mil.\n\nSpecimen of *U.

Laos, Cambodia).\n\nSpecimens obtained at Hotha and Momein (5,500 feet) in Yunnan, and also at Mandalay, agree exactly with Prime\u2019s original figure. Major Godwin-Austen also found a small form of this well-marked species at Manipur, in the Kuchai stream.\n\nLong. 28\u00bd, lat. 20\u00bd, crass. 13 mil.\n\n**Corbicula Yunnanensis**, n. sp.\n\nMedium-sized specimens from Yaylaymaw agree fairly with Prime\u2019s figure and description of *C. Linneana*, (Ann. Lyc. N. York, 1867, Cambodia), the principal difference being the less truncate anterior side. Shell large, thick, transverse, inequilateral, compressed, rather abruptly tumid towards the umbones; anteriorly moderately produced and rounded, posteriorly produced and truncate (exactly as in Prime\u2019s figure of *C. Linneana*); lateral teeth curved, the anterior a little more so than the posterior; no lunule; epidermis dark brown, stri\u00e6 regular and close; interior violet, of a darker shade near the margin. This species is more inequilateral, more tumid near the umbones, and more regularly sulcated than *C. Mulleriana*, Prime (*loc. cit.*), from China, which, however, it also closely resembles.\n\nType from Manwyne in Yunnan (4,000 feet): long. 39, lat. 33 mil.\n\nYaylaymaw (all young): long. 21\u00bd, lat. 17, crass. 11\u00bd mil.\nCorbicula Andersoniana, n. sp.\n\nRather small, thin, subequilateral, transversely ovate, tumid; medium-sized specimens closely resemble in shape *C. inaequilateralis*, Prime, both sides are obtusely rounded, epidermis bright green, interior violet, paler near the margin. This species is quite distinct from the other Burmese and Indian ones, it is, however, exceedingly close to *C. tumida*, Desh., P: Z.

Lores and frontal feathers pale, tipped with pale black, extending as an obscure supercilium to the nape, where the feathers become broadly dingy white on their upper web, dark brown on the lower; those on the back of the neck are broadly black-centred. The ear-coverts are umber-brown, darker behind, forming a crescentic margin again bordered lighter. The chin is pure white for three-quarters of an inch; a dark gorget of broadly black-centred feathers then crosses the upper breast; the centering of the feathers becoming very large, oblong, and conspicuous on the elongate feathers of the sides of the neck, but paler and less defined on the flanks. From the gorget all beneath is pale rufescent ochre. The under tail-coverts are dark, bordered with white.\n\nLegs pale ochre.

J. Ogle).\n\nThis species is nearest and closely allied to *Pellorneum Mandelli*, W. Blanford, described from Darjeeling, which is the same as Hodgson's *P. Nipalensis*, a MS. name never published. It is a larger bird as regards wing, and the legs are more robust. The principal difference lies in the far larger extent of the dark streaking on the sides of the neck: the dark centred feathers are longer and broader than in *P. Mandelli*; the black oblong spots...\nbeing 0\u00b74 in. by 1\u00b73 in. in this new form as against 0\u00b78 by 1\u00b70, while those on the upper nape are bordered with white above; the top of the head is dark chestnut, opposed to a dull rufous umber in the Darjiling species. Yet the greatest departure is in the abrupt termination of the white chin, succeeded by the ochraceous tint of the rest of the under parts, while the black centerings of the feathers are so broad and closely distributed as to form a decided dark gorget, whence they spread away down the sides of the breast. The feathers of the head and nape are more lengthened and fuller than in the other species.\n\nWe appear to have in this genus\u2014all near allies:\u2014\n\n1. **PELLORNEUM RUFICEPS,** Swainson.\n   South India.\n\n2. **PELLORNEUM MANDELLII,** W.

H., 1871, p. 267, also from Tenasserim.\n   Burmah and Tenasserim.\n\nI cannot help thinking that the two last names are only synonyms. In the list of Birds from Tenasserim (Stray Feathers, Vol. II. p. 476.), the very country whence Tickell sent his specimens to Blyth, *P. minor* is recorded as common, but *P. Tickelli* as not yet obtained. Comparing specimens lately received from Tenasserim with the original description and with a specimen in the Indian Museum (also from Tenasserim) which there is every reason for believing to be one of the original types, I can arrive at no other decision but that *P. minor* and *P. subochraceum* are nothing else than *P. Tickelli*; nor is it likely that two distinct species whose dimensions are so exceedingly close are to be found in so limited an area.\n\n2. **ACTINURA OGLEI,** n. sp.\n\n**Desc.**\u2014Above rich umber-brown with a sienna tinge, strongly rusty on the head and nape, the soft feathers of the back and rump are very finely and indistinctly crossed with narrow bars. A well-developed frontal band of white having the shafts of its feathers black, merges into a well-defined pure white supercilium and is continued over the black ear-coverts and down the side of the neck, where the white feathers become bordered with black, the supercilium thus terminating in scattered spots. This white supercilium is bordered above with black. Lores dark, chin pure white,\n\n* Is given in Blyth's List of the Birds of Burmah, but I doubt if true *P. ruficeps* is found out of Southern India.\nbreast grey, flanks and abdomen dull earthy brown. Wings and tail rich umber narrowly barred with black-brown, the tail having about 24 such bars. Irides crimson lake; legs and feet umber-brown.\n\nLength about 6\", wing 2\u00b78\", tail 2\u00b78\", tarsus 1\u00b71\", bill at front 0\u00b760\".\n\nThe bill, which is stronger and deeper than in any other species of the genus, is black above, grey below.\n\nHab.\u2014Shot on Manb\u00fam Tila, on the Tenga Pani river, near Saddya, at 800 ft. (M. J. Ogle).\n\nThis is another new form for which we have to thank Mr. Ogle, after whom I have much pleasure in naming it. It is one of the most beautiful and distinct forms of the genus, its white chin and superciliary stripe being a most conspicuous departure from the type of coloration possessed by the other species.\n\nActinura Oglei in the coloration of the head and nape, and in its white throat, has remarkable affinities for Turdinus guttatus, Tickell, from Tenasserim. This last bird can hardly find a place in the genus Turdinus as exemplified by such forms as T. brevicaudatus and its allies. In the stout legs and feet it is akin to Actinura, and in the form of the nostrils it is also like Actinura Oglei. The principal departure to be noted is in the absence of barring on the wings and tail, but this is to be discerned, though it is indistinct, and is noted by Tickell in his original description, when the barring was no doubt more apparent than it now is in the faded type specimen in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. In A. Oglei this barring, I notice, is far less conspicuous than in A. Egertoni, A. Waldeni, &c. Altogether these two birds present a most instructive case of close generic relationship.\n\n3. Pomatorhinus stenorhynchus, n. sp.\n\nDesc.\u2014Above pale umber-brown with an ochraceous tinge, richer brown on the head, a more umber tint on the tail and wings, a narrow pure white supercilium from base of bill over the eye to the ear-coverts, but not extending further. Lores black, passing under the eye to the ear-coverts, which are grey-black and bounded posteriorly with rufous brown. Chin and upper throat pure white, breast and abdomen pale rufescent, flanks and under tail-coverts pale ochraceous brown.\n\nBill very long, tapering, curved, and much compressed; bright orange-red. Legs and feet horny grey.\n\n\u2642 Length abt. 8\"; wing 4\"; tail 4\u00b74\"; tarsus 1\u00b735\"; bill at front 1\u00b745\";\n\u2640 3\u00b725; \" 3\u00b79; \" 1\u00b720; \" 1\u00b715.\n\nThe female is thus very decidedly smaller than the male.\n\nHab.\u2014Obtained on Manb\u00fam Tila, on Tenga Pani River, near Saddya at 800 ft. (M. J. Ogle).\nThis beautiful *Pomatorhinus*, which with the preceding species was discovered during the past cold season, in its very slender and narrow bill approaches the *Xiphorhamphus* form more than any other species of this group of Scimitar Babblers. In its coloration it reminds one of *Pom. ferruginosus*.\n\nThe claw of the inner toe is smaller than the outer, and all the claws are rounded off at the tip so as to have a peculiarly blunt gouge-like appearance.\n\nThe collection also contains several other new and interesting species, some of which I am unable to determine satisfactorily out here, but which shall be described in more detail in my next List of Birds from the N. E. Frontier. I may mention (i) an *Abrornis* with yellow chin, which I propose naming *A. flavogularis*; (ii) *Chleuasicus atrosperrciliaris*, intermediate in size between *Paradosornis ruficeps* and *Ch. ruficeps*; (iii) *Horornis fuliginiventer*, Hodg.; (iv) *Turdinus Williamsoni* quite distinct from the type of *T. brevicaudatus*, Blyth, which is of a strong rufous colour on the breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts; this rufous colour pervades the back, and the spotting on the secondaries is smaller and less conspicuous than in the specimen lately received from Saddya.\nV.\u2014Note on the Variation of the Barometric Tides in connection with Diurnal Land- and Sea-Breezes.\u2014By Henry F. Blanford, Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India.\n\n(Received January 29;\u2014Read March 7, 1877).\n\nThe theory of the diurnal land- and sea-breezes on sea-coasts is perhaps one of the most familiar of meteorological topics, and the subject finds a place in all our handbooks of meteorology and physical geography, as an illustration of winds of convection. It has long been surmised, as a deduction from the theory, that the daily oscillations of pressure over the sea and the land, in the neighbourhood of coast-lines, must shew marked differences; the pressure being higher over the land during the night and early morning, over the sea during the afternoon and evening hours. Hitherto, however, as far as I am aware, this inference has never been confirmed by the results of actual observation; and the following facts, relating to the diurnal variation of pressure over the head of the Bay of Bengal between 60 and 120 miles from the coast of the Sunderbans, will therefore have that interest which must always attach to the confirmation of a familiar theory. At the same time, I may point out, the view which I put forward at a recent meeting of the Society, viz., that a considerable transfer of air takes place in the day-time from the land to the sea, also receives confirmation; and, regarded as a whole, the resulting phenomenon is, to my mind, a very beautiful and at the same time simple solution of a problem in meteorological physics.\n\nThe data which have given occasion to this communication have reached me only within the last few weeks. They are the reduced logs, relating to Indian seas, for the month of January, which have been accumulated for many years past by the London Meteorological Office, established by the late Admiral Fitzroy, and now under the direction of Mr. R. H. Scott and Captain H. Toynbee. The observations have all been made with compared instruments and have been corrected to the Kew standard; and the extracted observations have been carefully sifted in the course of extraction, and all doubtful entries rejected. Those which I shall now discuss are the barometric readings of ships north of latitude 20\u00b0, approaching and leaving the Sandheads; and are therefore all taken between distances of 60 and 120 miles from the coast. The observations having been made with marine mercurial barometers, it is probable that the amplitude of the range shewn by them may be somewhat less than would be shewn by barometers with large tubes, were it practicable to use such instruments on board ship; but all the instruments issued by the Marine Meteorological Department (and such only have been employed) have been subjected to a preliminary\ntesting for sensitiveness and those only selected which have satisfied the test. It is therefore improbable that any large correction would be required to render the present data strictly comparable with those of a standard barometer.\n\nThe theory of diurnal land- and sea-breezes, as I understand it, is as follows. Under the morning sun, the air resting on a land-surface is more expanded than that resting on the sea; the larger part of the absorbed solar heat being used up, in the former case, in heating the air, while in the latter it is chiefly employed in evaporating water and charging the air with vapour; and, as I shewed in a former paper, the pressure of a given volume of air, when heated, is raised more than seven times as much as when the same amount of heat is consumed in charging it with vapour. The exact proportion at a temperature of $80^\\circ$ is $7.27$. The expansion that follows in the two cases is not, however, quite in the same proportion, because more heat is consumed in work in the one case than in the other. Supposing that the expansion takes place under the same pressure in both cases, the ratios of expansion, for the same absorption of heat, would be $5.44$ times as great in the case of the heated air as in that of the air charged with vapour, at the assumed temperature. The chief effect of this unequal expansion is to tilt the planes of equal pressure ($de$, $fg$) somewhat as represented in the accompanying diagram, and to produce a head of pressure at a certain height in the atmosphere over the land; while at the land- and sea-surface the pressure is perhaps but little altered. This process goes on as long as the temperature is rising; and the result is a current of air, at a certain height in the atmosphere, blowing from the land to the sea. But this transfer of air from the land- to the sea-atmosphere, while tending to restore equilibrium at the higher level, produces an increase of static pressure at the sea-surface, and reduces that at the land-surface; and therefore, a return current sets in at the lower level, which is the well known sea-breeze. As is well known, the sea-breeze sets in first on the coast-line; and as the day advances it extends in both directions, coming from further out at sea and penetrating to a greater distance inland. This continues till the equilibrium at the ground-surface is restored, which, however, does not occur until late in the evening. At Calcutta, the anemometer trace shews that, on an average, the retardation of the sea-breeze is such that it does not set in fairly until about 5 or 6 in the afternoon. Its prevalence, for some hours after this, is familiar to all residents in Calcutta in the cool southerly wind.\nwhich, in the hot weather, sets in about the hour of the evening drive, is at its height about the usual dinner-hour, and makes the south verandah so pleasant for the post-prandial lounge. It lulls gradually, and as a rule ceases to be felt about midnight. Meanwhile, the cooling of the lower and more heated strata of the air, by reducing their elasticity, allows the higher strata to sink under the influence of gravity; and this, the more rapidly, the faster the cooling proceeds; and since, in virtue of the momentum acquired during the interval of more rapid cooling, the motion continues, after the contraction has begun to relax, the lower strata are dynamically compressed, producing the evening maximum of barometric pressure. As the expansion in the morning is greatest over the land, so also is the contraction in the evening; and, owing to this, the isobaric planes at a certain elevation are again disturbed, sinking lower over the land and producing a head of pressure over the sea. This disturbance causes a transfer of air from over the sea to the land at the higher level; and is followed by an accumulation of pressure at the land-surface, causing the outflow of the land-wind in the early morning hours.\n\nAccording to this theory, then, there should be an excess of pressure over the land in the morning and as long as the land-wind prevails, and an excess of pressure over the sea in the afternoon and evening; and we might expect that, at the time of the afternoon minimum, when, according to the theory of the barometric tides, the air is exercising simply a static pressure, the minimum of the sea-curve would shew a much less depression than the land-curve, while the reverse would hold good at the time of the morning minimum. A comparison of the Calcutta curve with that of the head of the Bay, superimposed in the accompanying diagram, shews that these relations really obtain in nature. Any small increase in the amplitude of the marine barometric curve which may be required to render it strictly comparable with that of the Calcutta standard barometer, would only have the effect of increasing the difference of the night maximum and minimum, and somewhat diminishing that of the morning maximum and afternoon minimum.\n\nIn the diagram, I have represented the curves as deviations from the same line of mean pressure. Actually, in January, the mean pressure of the land is in general lower than that over the sea. It must be remembered also that the places represented are 80 or 90 miles from the coast-line; and therefore quite on the limits of the belt within which the daily oscillation of the surface-winds is experienced. I anticipate that, when the data for March and April shall be brought into comparison in like manner, the two curves will shew a still greater difference, indicating a greater transfer of air.\n\nThe following are the values for the six hours of observation, deduced from the marine registers; the co-efficients of Bessel's formula, computed\ntherefrom; and the hourly values calculated from the formula: in conjunction with which I give also the corresponding values for the Calcutta curve.\n\n**Means of observations of Pressure.

Ixora alba of the Botanical Garden at Buitenzorg (not of Roxb.) appears to me to be the same as Korthals' Pavetta calycina, and has exactly the calyx of I. calycina, Thw., but otherwise the two species are entirely different.

S., &c.\n\nAmongst the collections brought by Dr. Stoliczka from Eastern Turkestan was the skin of a weasel which had been kept in confinement. Judging from the skin alone, the animal appeared chiefly to differ from the common European weasel in colour, and it was difficult to say how far this difference was due to the circumstances under which the individual had been kept. Although I strongly suspected that it was a distinct species, still I thought it safer not to form conclusions from a single skin, and in the list of species J. A. S. B., 1875, Vol. XLIV, Pt. 2, p. 106, I noted the specimen as *Mustela vulgaris* var.\n\nA year later Dr. Scully brought from Turkestan another skin of the same weasel, but the second specimen had belonged to a male wild individual. This skin was also entrusted to me together with some other interesting specimens for description, and I regret that other work has prevented my noticing it sooner. On comparing this second specimen more carefully with *M. vulgaris*, I found that it differed not only in colour, but in size, being a much larger animal. The length measured on the fresh carcase by Dr. Scully, shews that the Yarkand weasel is nearly as large as an ermine, whilst the tail, the vertebrae of which are for the most part preserved, appears to be proportionally longer than in the common weasel. The weight and some other details are also carefully recorded on the label. The name in Eastern Turkestan is *Agha makan*.\nThe following is a description:\n\n**Mustela Stoliczkanai**, sp. nov.\n\n*Mustela ad M. vulgarem proxime accedens sed valde major, superne fusco-arenaria, subtus albida, caud\u00e2 longiore, quartem partem totius longitudinis subaquante, cum dorso concolore; labris ambobus genisque inferioribus albis, macul\u00e2 utrinque post angulam oris fulv\u00e2, alter\u00e2que ante oculum utrumque alba, palmis plantisque confertim pilis indutis. Long. tota cum caud\u00e2 12\u00b72, cauda, pilis inclusis, 3, cranii 1\u00b78, pedis posterioris a calcaneo 1\u00b74 poll. Angl.*\n\n**Hab.** Yarkand (Stoliczka, Scully).\n\nColour pale sandy brown above, the hairs rather paler and whitish at the base, white below. Fur short, dense and soft. Tail throughout the same colour as the back. There is a small white spot close to the anterior angle of each eye, and a rather larger sandy brown spot a little behind the gape in the lower part of the cheeks which are white to within a short distance below the eye. Upper lip white. Upper whiskers dark brown towards the base, and of about the same length as the head. Fore feet white mixed with pale brown above, hind feet only whitish at the edges; soles of all the feet thickly clad, only the toe pads being naked, and even they are almost concealed by the long hair. Tail nearly cylindrical, about one-third the length of the head and body.\n\nThe whole length, measured by Dr. Scully when the animal was fresh, and noted on the ticket, was 12\u00b72 inches, the tail, of which the vertebrae are preserved, now measures 3 inches including the hair at the end, or 2\u00b73 without it. The hind foot and tarsus are 1\u00b74 inches long without the claws. Fur on the back about 0\u00b73 in. long. The weight marked by Dr. Scully on the label was 5\u00b72 oz.*\n\nThe skull is slightly imperfect behind, the occipital plane having been cut away, but as the occipital crest remains, the total length can be measured with close approximation. The cranium shews the specimen to have been just adult, the dentition being perfect, although the sagittal crest is only rudimentary. The following are the dimensions:\n\n| Dimension                                      | In.   | Metre |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Length of skull (approximate) from occipital plane to alveolar margin | 1\u00b775  | 0\u00b7425 |\n| Breadth of brain case across parietal region    | 0\u00b783  | 0\u00b721  |\n| Ditto across zygomatic arches                  | 0\u00b798  | 0\u00b724  |\n| Ditto behind post-orbital processes            | 0\u00b74   | 0\u00b701  |\n| Length of suture between nasal bones           | 0\u00b728  | 0\u00b7077 |\n\n* The weight of the common weasel, according to Pallas, Zoog.

D., Superintendent.\n\nIn preparing a Catalogue of the Mammals in the Indian Museum, it\nhas been necessary to examine in detail the now somewhat extensive collec-\ntion of shrews which has been formed since the Asiatic Society's collections\nwere practically transferred to the Government of India, nearly eleven years\nago.\n\nTo show the progress which has been made since 1866, in a department\nwhich has never attracted many cultivators, it may suffice to state that\nBlyth's Catalogue of Mammals which was published in 1863 contained only\n15 species of Asiatic Shrews. These were represented in the Asiatic\nSociety's Museum, in 1865, by 22 mounted and 18 alcoholic specimens, and\nby 5 skulls and 2 skeletons.\n\nAt present, there are 38 species of these small Mammals in the Indian\nMuseum, illustrated by nearly 130 alcoholic specimens, 29 dried skins, 71\nskulls and 5 skeletons.\n\nThe most important additions to the Indian Museum in this section of\nthe vertebrates, since the publication of Blyth's Catalogue, have been Anuro-\nsorex, and the water-shrew of the Himalayas, the so-called Crossopus\nhimalaicus.\n\nThe discovery of the former, remarkable, generic type in Assam was\nmade by Mr. S. E. Peal of Sibsagar, in 1871, about one year after it had\nbeen described by M. A. Milne-Edwards from a specimen obtained in\nS\u00e9-tchouan and Tibet by the distinguished traveller, M. l'Abb\u00e9 David.\n\nThe first specimen of the Himalayan water-shrew in the Indian Museum\nwas obtained by the late Dr. Jerdon in Sikkim, and the second example was\nprocured by myself to the east of Bham\u00f4, in the Kakhyen hills which form\nthe natural western boundary of the Chinese Province of Yunnan. It has\nbeen again obtained by Mr. Mandelli of Darjiling who has done so much to\nextend our knowledge regarding the fauna of Sikkim. No information that\nI am aware of, is on record regarding the localities and heights at which this water-shrew has been found in the Himalaya, but judging by the elevation at which it occurs in the Kakhyen hills which are essentially Himalayan in their fauna, this most interesting shrew most probably lives at elevations of 3000 up to 5000 feet, or perhaps even higher.\n\nIt is very closely allied to the aquatic shrew of Japan named *Sorex platycephalus*, Temminck, but apparently differs from it specifically.\n\nBy its general structure, it appears to be more nearly allied to *Nectogale* than to *Crosoopus* from which it is generically separated by the character of its teeth, leaving out of view other and more important considerations such as its long, attenuated body, and the much stronger ciliation of its feet and tail, in all of which characters, as in those of its skull and teeth, it evinces a closer relationship to *Nectogale* than to any other known genus of shrew. It is, however, less aquatic in its habits than *Nectogale*, as is proved by its hind feet not being webbed as in that genus, but there can be no doubt of the close generic relationship of *Nectogale* with the Himalayan water-shrew. The structural features, however, of the latter and of the Japan shrew are such that they cannot be referred to any existing genus of mammalia, and I therefore propose the following genus for their reception.\n\n**Chimabrogale**, n. g.\n\nTeeth white $\\frac{2 \\times 4}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{2} \\times \\frac{8}{2 \\times 6} = 28$. Front upper incisors with a small talon on their inner side. Three intermediate teeth of nearly equal size; feet and toes scaly, ciliated with short coarse rigid hairs along their external and internal margins. Toes not webbed. Tail long, scaly, quadrangular, covered with longish, coarse, adpressed hairs. Snout elongate: ears almost wholly hidden, valvular.\n\nThe more immediate object, however, of this paper is to describe a number of shrews which appear to be new to science and to indicate a few others which have hitherto been seemingly wrongly determined.\n\nThey belong to the genera *Crocidura* and *Soriculus*. A large number of the species belonging to *Pachyura*, the sub-division of the first-named genus distinguished by 30 white teeth, are possessed of a series of cuticular aggregated glands on the side of the trunk, emitting a strong musky odour, whilst a few of the same sub-division are devoid of these structures; whereas the majority of the shrews belonging to the second sub-division of Crocidura with 28 white teeth, are devoid of musk glands on the side, and are thus inodorous. Some very small shrews, such as *C. (P.) macrotis* and *C. (P.) nitidofulva*, have musk glands, like their larger conpeers, while others of the very same, sub-generic division want them, e.g. *C. (P.) pygmaeoides*.\n\nIn estimating the age of individuals, I have always been guided by the\ncondition of the bones of the skull, and I have judged those adult in which the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid bones have been united. This is the last suture to disappear, and its obliteration in shrews is the only reliable test of full maturity. In skulls, however, with this suture entirely lost, the teeth very frequently do not present any marked indications of wear, so that union takes place before the animals are aged.\n\nIn all the newly born shrews that I have examined, the teeth have never been through the gum, but they have always been so well developed that the position, and in some cases the form, of each tooth was clearly defined.\n\nGenus CROCIDURA, Wagler.\n\nSub-Genus PACHYURA, Selys.\n\n(Lateral gland.)\n\nCROCIDURA, (P.) FULVOCINerea, n. s.\n\nForm of the body as in C. (P.) gigantea.\n\nThe snout is long and pointed; feet well developed and moderately haired. Tail swollen at the base and rather long and densely haired. Snout and feet yellowish, and lower portion of limbs with short sparse hairs, as usual. Claws long and pointed. Fur dark-slaty in the hidden portion, but broadly tipped with pale fawn producing a brownish-gray mixed with tawny resembling the colour of Lepus cuniculus, but with a distinct rusty tinge on the head. Under parts more grayish brown, with a little tawny. Whiskers nearly all white, or pale gray. Hairs on the feet and tail pale yellowish-brown or nearly white, the short tail hairs being rather longer and much more numerous than is generally the case in the allied species, and those at the tip occasionally longer.\n\n| Adult | Adolescent |\n|-------|------------|\n| Length, tip of snout to vent, | in. 6\u00b707 | in. 4\u00b735 |\n| Vent to tip of tail, | 3\u00b790 | 2\u00b788 |\n| Length of hind foot without claws, | 1\u00b700 | 0\u00b782 |\n| Tip of snout to eye, | 1\u00b700 | 0\u00b770 |\n| Eye to ear, | 0\u00b757 | 0\u00b735 |\n| Height of ear, | 0\u00b750 | 0\u00b735 |\n| Breadth of ear, | 0\u00b741 | 0\u00b740 |\n\nThe first upper incisors are not very long; their posterior process is on a level with the third incisor and canine, and their longitudinal breadth about equals the breadth of the base of the dependent portion of the teeth. There is a small internal process of the cingulum. The second incisor is not very large and is hardly twice the size of the third incisor. This last mentioned\ntooth and the canine are of equal size and their tips are nearly on the same level. The premolar is very small and lies behind the canine and slightly internal to the first molar, so that only half of it is externally visible. It is very small and its tip reaches only a short way below the cingulum of the canine. The cusp on the anterior, external angle of the first molar is well developed and its point is on a level with the point of the canine in some, and below it in others. The chief cusp of this molar is not prominent.\n\n| Anterior border of foramen magnum to tip of premaxill\u00e6, in. | 1\u00b735 | 1\u00b715 |\n| Greatest breadth across maxilla, .................................. | 0\u00b750 | 0\u00b741 |\n| Breadth at posterior border of infraorbital foramen, .......... | 0\u00b728 | 0\u00b725 |\n| ,, anterior to brain case, ........................................... | 0\u00b733 | 0\u00b730 |\n| ,, external to glenoid foss\u00e6, ....................................... | 0\u00b753 | 0\u00b745 |\n| ,, ,, to tympanic, .................................................... | 0\u00b766 | 0\u00b758 |\n| Length of upper alveolar line, ..................................... | 0\u00b765 | 0\u00b754 |\n| From condyle of lower jaw to end of alveolar line, ............. | 0\u00b785 | 0\u00b770 |\n\nThe skull is distinguished from the skull of *C. blythii* by its greater size and much larger teeth. The first upper incisors are stronger and the second incisor relatively smaller than in that species; on the other hand, the skull, as is shown by the measurements given of a perfectly adult \u2642, is considerably smaller than the skull of *C. gigantea*, and the teeth are proportionally less.\n\nThis species, in its proportions, appears to be closely allied to *C. tytleri*, from Dehra D\u00fcn, but the characters of the latter have been so vaguely defined that it is impossible to decide whether the two are identical or not. Blyth does not give any information about the teeth. It is also distinguished from *C. gigantea* by its more profuse and fawn-coloured fur and by its well-haired tail, and from *C. blythii* by its larger size, by its dentition and by its pale fur.\n\nIt inhabits the valley of Assam (Gauh\u00e1ti).\n\n*Crocidura (P.) blythii*, Andr.\n\n*Sorex murinus*, Blyth, Journ.

The posterior process of the\nfirst upper incisor is moderately developed and there is only a very obscure\nprocess on its inner side. It is not so broad as the base of the front portion\nof the tooth. The second incisor is large, and broader than the conjoint\nthird incisor and canine, but its tip is above the level of the point of the\ncentral cusp of the first molar. The canine is considerably larger than the\nthird incisor, and its point is below the level of the anterior cusp of the\nfirst molar.\n\nThere appears to be a considerable difference between the size of the\nsexes, as indicated not only by the body measurements but by their skulls.\nThe skulls also indicate that the species is smaller than *C. fulvocinerea*,\nbecause its skull although not very much older than the skulls of which\nthe measurements are given below exceeds them in size. Comparing the\nskulls of these two species, the first upper incisors of *C. fulvocinerea* are\nseen to be larger than in *C. blythii*, whereas the second upper incisor of the\nlatter is considerably larger than the corresponding incisor of *C. fulvo-\ncinerea*, and its canine is more pointed and larger than the third incisor.\nThe premolar of *C. blythii* is relatively larger than the premolar of *C. fulvo-\ncinerea* and it has a small cusp-like process of the cingulum on its outer\nside, which is partially visible externally.\nAdolescent \u2640 Adult \u2640\n\nAnterior border of foramen magnum to tip of premaxill\u00e6, in 1\u00b720 in 1\u00b713\nGreatest breadth across maxill\u00e6, ........................................... 0\u00b744 0\u00b745\nBreadth behind infraorbital foramen, ...................................... 0\u00b727 0\u00b726\nBreadth anterior to brain case, ............................................. 0\u00b728 0\u00b730\n\" external to glenoid foss\u00e6, .................................................. 0\u00b750 0\u00b745\n\" \" to tympanic, ............................................................... 0\u00b754 0\u00b755\nLength of upper alveolar line, .................................................. 0\u00b758 0\u00b755\nLength from condyle of lower jaw to end of alveolar margin, ............ 0\u00b770 0\u00b768\n\nTomes describes the type of *S. griffithii* as characterized by the large size of its teeth which exceeded, he states, those of any example of *S. caeruleascens* he had ever seen. Such a description however is in no way applicable to the types of *S. griffithii* as understood by Blyth, and it is therefore perfectly evident, apart from external characters, that they are not the *S. griffithii* of Horsfield. Tomes, however, did not concur with Horsfield in considering the fur as either short close or soft, but describes it as of medium length, deep blackish gray, glossy and rather coarse. The specimens from Arakan described by Blyth as *S. murinus* (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., Vol. XVII, 1851, p. 15) were afterwards the types of Blyth's *S. griffithii*, but these specimens were regarded by Tomes as *S. caeruleascens*.\n\nBlyth was under the impression that the type of *S. griffithii* was from the Kh\u00e1sia hills, although described from Afghanistan, because he saw a fine skin of a shrew he believed to be *S. griffithii* from Ch\u00e1r\u00e1p\u00fanj\u00ed in the possession of Griffith. This specimen had been forwarded to the India House by Dr. M'Clelland, and Blyth seems to have concluded that it was the type of *S. griffithii*, Horsfield. But the evidence is unsatisfactory. And, moreover, Blyth's specimens do not agree with the description of *S. griffithii*.\n\nIt inhabits the hilly region of Assam, (Sib\u00e9\u00e1g\u00e1r), the Kh\u00e1sia Hills (Ch\u00e1r\u00e1p\u00fanj\u00ed) and Arakan.\n\n*Crocidura (P.) sindensis*, n. s.\n\nSnout moderately long, and pointed; ears full and rounded, sparsely clad, the margins and flaps with longish, somewhat stiff hairs. Lower half of limbs seminude; feet slender and toes rather long. Tail rounded, slightly swollen at the base and about four-fifth the length of the trunk. Fur moderately long soft and glossy; neutral gray and washed with umber, but not obscuring the gray; under-parts pale neutral gray with a silvery sheen in certain lights. Snout gray; feet yellowish, sparsely clad with whitish hairs; claws rather long and hooked.

No eminence of the cingulum on the inside of the posterior portion of the tooth which is rather broader than the base of the elongated portion. Second incisor not very large, but equalling the conjoint breadth of the third incisor and canine. The third incisor is considerably smaller than the canine, but the tip of the latter is somewhat above the level of that of the former. The premolar is not very small and it is nearly as broad as the canine behind which it directly lies, but externally it is nearly wholly hidden by the first molar. The anterior cusp on the first molar and its large cutting cusp are not strongly developed: the point of the latter is below the level of that of the second incisor. The anterior portion of the frontals is not much narrower than the portion behind the orbits.

As the character assigned by Blyth, viz., naked feet is misleading, I have re-named this species after its distinguishing feature, namely, its large ears.\n\nIt is closely allied to C. (P.) perrottetii from the Nilgiris but is distinguished from it by the character of its teeth, the first incisor being well curved with a prominent eminence at the base, and the first intermediate tooth being large and conical.

A small portion of the occipital has been broken off, but sufficient remains on one side to indicate that the foramen magnum has been very large; measured from the inferior border of the foramen magnum to the end of the palate anteriorly, the total length of the adult skull is only 0\u00b745. The condyles are large, and there is a considerable concavity or depression immediately over the temporal fossa. The most marked feature of the skull is the character of the teeth, more especially of the first upper incisor which is short and but little if at all hooked and destitute of the marked eminence at its base posteriorly which is so distinctive of the generality of shrews. There is a slight indication of the position of the eminence on the outer side of the tooth, but no more, and the tip of the first intermediate tooth is but little below the basal portion of the first incisor, and the immediately succeeding teeth gradually diminish in size to the fourth intermediate tooth which is well developed,\nand in the line of the teeth before it, and almost wholly visible externally. The anterior portions of the crowns of these three teeth are rather sharply pointed. The apex of the crown of the first molar is on a level with the base of the first incisor.

The second incisor is large and nearly equals the length of the chief cusp of the first molar. The third incisor and canine are almost of equal size, but the latter, as is generally the case, is slightly larger than the former. The premolar is small and wedged in between the canine and the first molar, is sharply conical, and nearly wholly visible externally. The anterior cusp on the first molar is small and rather blunt, and considerably above the level of the point of the canine. There is a minute eminence on the outside of the lower incisor near its tip. The total length of the upper line of tooth is 0\"45.\n\nThe skull unfortunately met with an accident before it was measured. This shrew would appear to attain to a greater size than C. serpentarius and to be a medium-sized species. The smaller and more rounded ears, and the short interval between the eye and the ear, its larger size and the presence of a lateral gland separate it from C. rubicunda; and its strong feet distinguish it from C. stoliczkana.\n\nThe Museum is indebted for this species to Dr. Bidie of the Madras Central Museum, whose name I have associated with it.\n\n(No lateral gland.)\n\n*Crocidura* (P.) *rubicunda*, n. s.\n\nSnout long and pointed, not much swollen across the moustachial region, well haired.

July 11th,\u2014Read August 1st, 1877.)\n\nKnowing the great importance, at the present time, of authenticated lists of the faunas of different districts, I have thought it worth while to bring to the notice of the Society, the following observations on the mammalian fauna, of the valleys of the Wardw\u00e1n and upper Chin\u00e1b rivers, made by me during a tour of these regions, in the course of my professional duties. The country noticed includes the greater part of the course of the Wardw\u00e1n river, (namely, the part from Inshin, to its junction with the Chin\u00e1b river); and also the valley of the Chin\u00e1b from Kishtw\u00e1r upwards to the point where this river divides into the two smaller streams of the\nChandra and the B\u00e2gha, in British Lah\u00fbl. The country is particularly interesting as being the border land between the Tibetan region on the one hand, and the so-called Himalayan region on the other.\n\nThe list of mammalia, given in the present paper, is confessedly imperfect, as it takes scarcely any notice of the micro-mammalia and none of the Chiroptera; while such larger mammalia as are noticed are chiefly those which have come under my own observation, or of which I have seen freshly-killed skins or skulls; I think, however, that the list of larger mammalia is tolerably complete.\n\nPRIMATES.\n\nOf this order I believe only two species exist in the region at present under consideration,\u2014viz., Inuus rhesus and Semnopithecus (Presbytis) schistaceus.\n\nInuus rhesus I have observed only in the Chin\u00e1b valley, a short distance above Kishtw\u00e1r, at an elevation of about 5600 feet; Jerdon in his \"Mammals of India\" mentions the occurrence of this species in the Himalaya, at an elevation of 5000 feet, as being the highest range of which he knew.\n\nSemnopithecus schistaceus ranges to greater heights than the last species, and is not unfrequently seen in pine trees when covered with snow; in our district this species ranges from a short distance above Kishtw\u00e1r up the Wardw\u00e1n valley as far as the village of Mar\u00fa or Petg\u00e1m which has an elevation of about 7500 feet, beyond which point I did not observe it. In the Chin\u00e1b valley I saw large numbers of this species near the village of Seri, or Sereri, at an elevation a little below 9000 feet; I think it does not range much further up the valley than the above-mentioned village. According to Jerdon the species has been observed at greater elevations than those here mentioned.\n\nCARNIVORA.\n\nFelis pardus is extremely common throughout the greater part of the Wardw\u00e1n and upper Chin\u00e1b valleys; in the latter I picked up a portion of a skull as far up as the village of Tindi. The species ranges to a considerable height in pursuit of Ibex.\n\nFelis tigris; I have been told by a friend that an individual of this species was killed some years ago in the Wardw\u00e1n: even if this be true, the species can only be regarded as an occasional straggler into these regions.\n\nFelis uncia; of this species I have seen two skins of individuals which were killed on the southern side of the great snowy range separating the Chin\u00e1b valley from Zansk\u00e1r; I believe the species has never been found to the south of the Chin\u00e1b, nor can I hear of its occurrence in Wardw\u00e1n: its proper home is undoubtedly the Tibetan region.\nI have not come across any specimens of the smaller Felidae, and can say nothing as to their presence in, or absence from, the districts under consideration.\n\nThe two species of Himalayan Bear\u2014Ursus isabellinus and Ursus tibetanus\u2014range over the greater part of our district; the latter species is found generally at a lower elevation and in more forest-clad ground than the former; U. isabellinus is found over the whole of the upper Wardw\u00e1n and Chin\u00e1b valleys, but does not extend down to the lower elevation of Kishtw\u00e1r, and becomes scarce above Triloknath; it also occurs abundantly to the south of the Chin\u00e1b in the upper Chamba district. U. tibetanus does not, so far as I can learn, extend much higher up the Wardw\u00e1n valley than the village of Petg\u00e1m, something over 7000 feet in height; it is found, chiefly in the forests near the river, along the whole of the Chin\u00e1b valley from Kishtw\u00e1r to Tindi, beyond which I have not heard of it; like the last species it is also common in Chamba. The north-easterly range of both species (except in the case of a few stragglers) is limited by the ranges of high mountains which separate the Wardw\u00e1n valley, and the Chin\u00e1b valley, from the Tibetan regions of S\u00far\u00e1 and Zanskar.\n\nAmong the Canidae, Canis (Vulpes) montanus is exceedingly common throughout the Wardw\u00e1n and Chin\u00e1b valleys: I have also procured specimens of another large fox* which has some resemblance to the black varieties of Canis (Vulpes) leucopus; but I am by no means certain as to the identity of the two forms, especially as C. leucopus is not mentioned by Jerdon as occurring in the Himalayas. The back of the Chin\u00e1b form is fulvous, the under-parts and limbs are nearly black, with a few dirty white streaks, the outer surfaces of the ears jet black, and the tail blackish, with a white tip.\n\nCuon rutilans, if I may judge by tracks, occurs both in the Chin\u00e1b and Wardw\u00e1n valleys.\n\nHerpestes griseus and Mustela subhemachelana, which are so common in Kashmir, I have not seen anywhere in the upper Chin\u00e1b or Wardw\u00e1n valleys.\n\nOn the Chin\u00e1b, however, I have seen two specimens of a species of weasel, which I cannot identify with any of the species described in Jerdon, unless it be a variety of Mustela kathiah, which is only known from Nepal. Unfortunately both times that I saw these animals I had only a rifle with me, so I was unable to procure them. The fur of the body and tail is of a reddish brown colour, and there is a large white blaze on the face, quite different from any described species.\n\nRodentia.\n\nMarmots occur on the snowy range which separates the Chin\u00e1b valley from Zanskar, but they do not occur on the range to the south of the\n\n* Mr. Blanford tells me that this form is probably C. montanus.\nChin\u00e1b; I have been shown a considerable number of skins from the former range, all of which are characterized by having short tails and which I have no doubt therefore belong to *Arctomys himalayanus*; I have seen no specimens of *Arctomys caudatus*, from this district.\n\nI am not aware whether or no Marmots occur in the Wardw\u00e1n.\n\n*Lagomys Roylei* occurs not uncommonly in the upper Chin\u00e1b between Kilar and Tindi; I did not see any specimens lower down, nor any in Wardw\u00e1n.\n\n*Pteromys inornatus* occurs throughout the Wardwan valley and in the upper Chin\u00e1b valley as far as Saneh, in considerable numbers; its peculiar cry is very frequently heard at night, especially in wooded districts.\n\n**UNGULATA.**\n\n*Cervus cashmeriensis* is found on the Kashmir side of the Wardw\u00e1n valley, but does not extend to the opposite side, or into the Chin\u00e1b district. The comparatively few individuals that are found in Wardw\u00e1n may be regarded as merely stragglers from Kashmir.\n\n*Moschus moschiferus* occurs throughout the Wardw\u00e1n valley, and very abundantly in the Chin\u00e1b valley some distance above Kishtw\u00e1r; I am not aware whether or no it extends into Chin\u00e1b; it becomes somewhat rare above Saneh in the Chin\u00e1b valley.\n\n*Hemitragus jemlaicus* is exceedingly common in the thickly wooded districts of the lower Wardw\u00e1n valley, and of the lower half of the upper Chin\u00e1b valley; in the latter region the village of Kilar (except in the case of stragglers) seems to mark its eastern range; this species also occurs in Chamba. The females are very generally found in the thick forests which extend down to the level of the Chin\u00e1b above Kishtw\u00e1r, while the males appear to prefer the more open ground which occurs at a higher level; on more than one occasion I have seen a flock of this species numbering twenty individuals.\n\n*Nemorhaedus goral* is found in considerable numbers on the southern or Chamba side of the range of mountains running along the southern bank of the Chin\u00e1b, and a few individuals may be found on the northern side of the same range; but the range of the species is limited to the north by the Chin\u00e1b.\n\n*Nemorhaedus bubalina*; of this species I have not heard of or seen any individuals in our country.\n\n*Capra sibirica*; the range of this species in the Kishtw\u00e1r district is limited to the west by the Wardw\u00e1n river; and to the south by the Chin\u00e1b; proceeding up the former river, however, as far as Petg\u00e1m and Inshin, we find the species occurring on the western or right bank of the river, though not in such numbers as on the eastern or left bank. In the same manner\nif we follow the course of the Chin\u00e1b above Kishtw\u00e1r, we find that beyond the village of Tindi, Ibex, though in small numbers, occur on the southern or left bank of the river; generally they are not found on the Chamba side of the range of mountains running along the southern bank of the Chin\u00e1b; but early this season a small flock was observed which had crossed the range into the Barmaor district; this being, as far as I can learn, the only instance of Ibex being seen there. To the east of the Wardw\u00e1n, and to the north of the Chin\u00e1b, Ibex in great numbers range over the Tibetan districts of S\u00far\u00e1, Zansk\u00e1r and Lad\u00e1k.\n\nWherever Ibex are found either to the west of the Wardw\u00e1n or to the south of the Chin\u00e1b, these rivers are bridged over during some portion of the year by snow, across which bridges the Ibex have doubtless passed from the country to the east and south of the two rivers, which is their proper home.\n\n*Capra Falconeri* is not found within the district under consideration.\n\n*Sus indicus* is found in the Chin\u00e1b valley at and below Kishtw\u00e1r, but I believe it does not range above that place, either in the Chin\u00e1b or the Wardw\u00e1n valley.\n\nThough not strictly belonging to the wild fauna of the district, I may mention that the half-breed between the Indian cattle and the domesticated Y\u00e1k is commonly employed in agriculture, in the Chin\u00e1b valley, at and above the village of G\u00fal\u00e1bgarh, the elevation of which place is but slightly over 6000 feet above the sea-level: this is the lowest elevation at which I have seen the half-breed living constantly in the Himalaya.\n\nFrom a perusal of the above notes, it will be apparent that the valley of the upper Chin\u00e1b, and in a lesser degree that also of the Wardw\u00e1n, forms an ill-defined boundary-line between the faunas of the so-called \"Himalayan\" and \"Tibetan\" regions.\n\nIf we refer to a list of the Mammalia proper to the plateau of Tibet, given by Mr. W. T. Blanford in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,* we shall find that the following four Tibetan species, viz., *Felis uncia*, *Canis montanus*, *Arctomys himalayanus* and *Capra sibirica* extend their range into the \"Himalayan\" region of the Chin\u00e1b, where they either mingle with or closely approach to the proper fauna of that region, such as *Ursus tibetanus*, *Ursus isabellinus*, *Hemitragus jemlaicus*, and *Nemorhaedus goral*. It is worthy of notice that the last of the four above-mentioned species does not occur on the ground where the outlying \"Tibetan\" forms range, while the other three \"Himalayan\" species mingle with the \"Tibetan.\"\n\nThere appears to be some doubt as to which of the two faunas the Musk-deer properly belongs; Mr. Blanford, in his above-quoted paper,\n\n* 1876, p. 633.\nconsiders that it should be referred to the \"Alpine-Himalayan,\" and doubts the fact of its occurrence anywhere on the Tibetan plateau. I am not in a position to say definitely, in the face of such authority, that the species does occur in the latter region, but I am rather inclined to think that it must, since I have been shewn skins of this species in Lad\u00e1k, said to have been procured there; moreover the Lad\u00e1kis have a distinct name for the animal, viz., L\u00e1u\u00e1,\u2014which is not usual in the case of animals which do not occur in the country. Again Jerdon in his \"Mammals of India,\" in treating of this species, says (taking the statement for what it is worth) that it extends into Central Asia as far as Siberia.\n\nIn separating so markedly the \"Tibetan\" from the \"Himalayan\" fauna, it must be borne in mind that there is evidence of the two having for a long period of time had means of communication with each other; otherwise we are unable to explain the very close relationship which undoubtedly exists between Ovis Vignii of the Tibetan plateau, and Ovis cycloceros of the hills of the Panj\u00e1b. It is probable that the latter must be regarded as originally a wanderer from the Tibetan fauna, which has become modified into a distinct species, now confined to the outer Himalayan district.\n\n---\n\nX.\u2014On the Met\u00e1d Rat (Golunda meltada, Gray) with a note on Golunda Ellioti.\u2014By W. T. Blanford, F. R. S., &c.\n\n(Received June 21st;\u2014Read July 4th, 1877.)\n\n(With Plate L)\n\nIn a paper published in the Journal for last year, Vol. XLV, Pt. 2, p. 165, I gave an account of the Golandi rat (Golunda Ellioti). The great difficulty which I found in recognizing this rat from the published descriptions, and the identification of the genera Golunda and Pelomys have induced me to study some of the other peculiar murine forms found in India. The affinities of these species cannot be clearly made out without fuller descriptions of their structural peculiarities than have hitherto been available, and the skulls and teeth especially need comparison with those of other Muridae. We are indebted to Dr. Peters for full accounts of the structure of two Indian rodent genera Nesokia* (= Spalacomys) and Platacanthomyst\u2020; but of others, such as Golunda, Leggada and Vandeleuria so little has hitherto been known that they are not even mentioned in Mr. Alston's recent classification of the Glires.\u2021\n\n* Spalacomys indicus (= Nesokia Hardwickei of Jerdon, and perhaps of Gray) Abhandl. K\u00f6n. Akad. der. Wiss. Berlin, 1860, p. 139, Pl. II, fig. 1.\n\u2020 P. Z. S. 1865, p. 397, Pl. 20.\n\u2021 P. Z. S. 1876, p. 61.\nThe genus *Golunda* was originally proposed by Dr. J. E. Gray* for two species, *G. Ellioti* and *G. meltada*. The former was described in the paper mentioned above; the latter is very imperfectly known. Mr. Blyth had no specimens of *G. meltada*, and consequently could only copy the earlier descriptions in his memoir on the Rats and Mice of India.\u2020 Dr. Jerdon, in the 'Mammals of India' only repeated the characters given by Sir W. Elliot, but he expressed a doubt whether the species ought to be included in the same group as *G. Ellioti*, as the physiognomy, character of the fur, and habits are distinct. I quite agree with Dr. Jerdon, and it appears to me that the characters of the skull and dentition fully confirm his suggestion.\n\nFor the original discovery of this species and of most of the *Muridae* inhabiting the plateau of Southern India we are indebted to Sir W. Elliot (at that time Mr. Elliot of the Madras Civil Service). The species was originally named by Gray\u2021 *Golunda meltada*, the specific name being evidently a misreading or misprint for *mettada*. The Met\u00e1d rat was again described by Sir W. Elliot\u00a7 himself under the name of *Mus lanuginosus* and an excellent account was given of its habits. Owing to the circumstance that a peculiar caste of natives, the Wad\u00e1ris|| or tank diggers of the Mahratta country, catch and eat rats of various kinds, and naturally have particular names for the different species, it is easier to obtain specimens, and, which is even more important, to identify them when obtained, than in the case of most Indian micro-mammals.\n\nI am indebted to my friend the Rev. S. Fairbank of Ahmednagar for an excellent series of the met\u00e1d rats, comprising five skins and five specimens in spirit, all obtained from the Wad\u00e1ri of the neighbourhood. The species appears much more abundant in the Ahmednagar district than the *Legyade* or the *Golundi*, although both occur and Mr. Fairbank has procured specimens for me. The original locality, Dh\u00e1rwar, is about 240 miles south of Ahmednagar.\n\nAs I have already stated, the species is not congeneric with *Golunda Ellioti*. The incisors are not grooved, the molars are like those of ordinary rats, and the palate is of the width usual in the family. I see no grounds for removing the species from the genus *Mus*.\n\nThe specific name is more difficult to decide. That *meltada* is a mistake is clear, but it is I think better to retain the oldest name, merely correcting the spelling to *mettada*, than to adopt Sir W. Elliot's term\n\n---\n\n* Charlesworth's Mag. Nat. Hist. I., 1837, p. 586.\n\u2020 J. A. S. B. 1863, XXXII, p. 352.\n\u2021 l. c.\n\u00a7 Madras Jour. Lit.

Hist., Ser. 2, VIII, p. 339, (1851) was by Kelaart, on the authority of Blyth, (Prod. Faun. Zeyl. p. 67,) considered the same as the Metad, although it differs in having grooved incisors, and in colour. By Blyth it was subsequently considered identical with G. Ellioti, Cat. Mam. Mus. As. Soc., p. 121.\n\nMus mettada has not hitherto, so far as I know, been recorded from any precise locality, except the Western Deccan; it probably, however, is found in others parts of the Madras Presidency. Jerdon says it has only been found in Southern India.\n\nDescription taken from 5 dried skins and 5 specimens in spirit.\u2014Colour above brown with a slight rufous tinge, below white, the two colours not sharply divided. Fur soft, glossy and rather dense, consisting of fine hairs which beneath the microscope are found to be slightly flattened and grooved. The hairs of the upper parts are very dark leaden grey, except near the ends, where they are light brown; black tipped hairs, a little longer than the rest, being mixed as usual with the fur on the back and face, but becoming fewer in number and gradually disappearing on the sides. On the breast and abdomen the fur is lighter grey at the base, white at the ends. The length of the ordinary hairs in the middle of the back is rather less than half an inch, (about 0\u00b742,) the longer hairs\nbeing about half an inch long. The whiskers slightly exceed the head in length, most are black, some of those near the upper lip being grey or white as a general rule, though not invariably; in one specimen, perhaps young, all are black.\n\nThe ears are very thin, rounded, subovate, nearly naked outside and inside, having only a few short hairs scattered over their surface.\n\nThe feet are very light brown above, the soles flesh-coloured, with a greyish tinge; there are only five tubercles or pads, as a rule, on the hind foot, the outer hinder tubercle being absent or rudimentary, and the inner small: five nearly equidistant pads on the fore foot. The hallux of the fore foot is quite rudimentary, but has a small teguline nail, the other nails are compressed. The second digit is shorter than the fourth, the fifth terminates nearly on a line with the junction between the third and fourth. On the hind foot there is but little difference in the length of the three middle toes, the third is a little the longest, the other two nearly equal; in individuals either may be slightly longer than the other; the fifth is rather longer than the first, but neither, without its claw, extends so far as the divisions between the other toes.\n\nThe tail is shorter than the head and body together, it is of moderate thickness at the base, (the diameter is 0\u00b72 inch in an adult male,) and tapers gradually to the point; it is closely ringed with scales and thinly clad with short bristly hairs, which are blackish above, pale below.\n\nIn the female there are two pairs of pectoral and two of inguinal mammae, both of the latter far behind the anterior edge of the thigh, and unusually close together, the anterior being, in one adult female, only a quarter of an inch from the posterior on the same side; the pectoral mammae are, as in many mice and rats, one pair, in front, inside the shoulders, and the other pair behind the armpits.\n\nI have extracted two skulls, one from an adult male in spirit, the other from the skin of a female. The general form differs but little from that of most species of Mus. The upper surface is slightly convex, the convexity being more pronounced on the nasal portion. The ante-orbital foramen is large, the zygomatic arch moderately stout. The incisive (anterior palatal) foramina are of great length, and extend back for some distance between the anterior molars. The bony palate between the molars is not nearly so narrow as in Golunda Ellioti, nor are the molars so broad. The latter appear to differ in no respect from those of other species of Mus. The incisors in both jaws are deep orange, not sulcated in front; those of the upper jaw nearly flat in front, those of the lower jaw convex.\n\nThe following dimensions are those of a male and female, both fully adult, preserved in spirit.\nTotal length from nose to end of tail, ........................................... 9\u00b72 8\u00b7\nLength of head and body from nose to anus, ................................. 5\u00b7 4\u00b725\n,, of tail, .................................................................................. 4\u00b72 3\u00b775\n,, of ear from orifice, .................................................................... 0\u00b775 0\u00b77\nBreadth of ear laid flat, .................................................................. 0\u00b762 0\u00b76\nLength of hind foot (without claws), .............................................. 1\u00b705 0\u00b79\n,, of fore foot (,,) from behind proximal tubercle to end of middle toe, .................................................. 0\u00b745 0\u00b74\nLongest whisker, ............................................................................. 1\u00b725 1\u00b73\n\nThe following measurements are from the skull of an adult male, the specimen figured\u2014\n\n| Measurement                                      | Inch   | Metre |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Length of skull from occipital plane to end of nasal bones | 1\u00b738   | 0\u00b7345 |\n| Greatest breadth across zygomatic arches         | 0\u00b762   | 0\u00b716  |\n| Length of suture between nasal bones             | 0\u00b751   | 0\u00b718  |\n| Breadth of frontal bones between orbits          | 0\u00b722   | 0\u00b7055 |\n| Length of anterior palatine foramina            | 0\u00b732   | 0\u00b708  |\n| Do. of row of upper molars                      | 0\u00b728   | 0\u00b707  |\n| Breadth of bony palate between anterior upper molars | 0\u00b712   | 0\u00b703  |\n| Length of lower jaw from angle to symphysis     | 0\u00b775   | 0\u00b7175 |\n| Height of ditto to coronoid process              | 0\u00b742   | 0\u00b7105 |\n| Length of row of lower molars                   | 0\u00b724   | 0\u00b706  |\n\nAdditional note on Golunda Ellioti (see J.

Measurements of dried specimens are of course only a rough approximation.\n| Date          | District                                      | Time of occurrence |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 2nd May, 1874| Shillong, Khasi Hills                         | 8 p.m.             |\n| 13th June, 1874| Tura, Garo Hills                              | 12.30 p.m.         |\n| 18th do.     | Shillong, Khasi Hills                         | Midnight           |\n| 14th do.     | Cachar                                        | 0.24 a.m.          |\n| 16th do.     | Cherra Poonji, Khasi Hills                    | 8 p.m.             |\n| 17th do.     | Mangaldai, Darrang                            | 9.30 a.m.          |\n| 6th July, 1874| Shillong, Khasi Hills                         | 1.40 p.m.          |\n| 3rd Augt. 1874| Jorhat, Sibsagar                              | 11.30 p.m.         |\n| 2nd Sept. 1874| Shillong, Cherra Punji                        | 8.20 p.m.          |\n| 17th do.     | Darrang                                       | 9.30 p.m.          |\n| 20th do.     | Nowgong                                       | 4.52 p.m.          |\n| 8th Nov. 1874| Tura, Garo Hills                              | 3.15 p.m.          |\n| 23rd do.     | Tezpur, Darrang                               | 8 p.m.             |\n| 6th Dec. 1874| Tezpur, Darrang                               | 7 p.m.             |\n| 18th do.     | Tura, Garo Hills                              | 9.55 a.m.          |\n| Do.          | Shillong, Khasi Hills                         | 4.30 a.m.          |\n| 26th do.     | Jowai, Khasi Hills                             | 10.11 p.m.         |\n| 29th do.     | Cachar                                        | 12.15 p.m.         |\n| Do.          | Goalpara                                      | 10 p.m.            |\n| 23rd Jan. 1875| Kamrup, Barpeta                               | 10.15 p.m.         |\n| Do.          | Khasi and Jaintea Hills, Jowai                 | 10.48 p.m.         |\n| Do.          | Do.                                           | 10.55 p.m.         |\n| 24th do.     | Do.                                           | 12.30 p.m.         |\n| 25th do.     | Do.                                           | 1 p.m.             |\n| 7th Feb. 1875| Do.                                           | 8.30 p.m.          |\n| 11th June, 1875| Sibsagar, Jorhat                              | 2.25 p.m.          |\n| Do.          | Khasi and Jaintea Hills, Shillong              | 2.58 p.m.          |\n| 3rd Sept. 1875| Kamrup, Barpeta                               | 8.57 a.m.          |\n| Duration          | Extent of damage if any, and general Remarks |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| ......             | No damage done.                             |\n| 4 or 5 seconds    | No damage done.

Read 7th November, 1877.)\n\n[Of the collections described in the following paper, only a portion of the specimens from Sind were obtained by myself. The other Sind specimens were collected and given to me by Mr. H. E. Watson, For the Travancore collection I am indebted to Col. R. H. Beddome, and the Burmese bats were obtained by Mr. Limborg in the neighbourhood of Moulmain.\n\nW. T. Blanford.]\n\nMr. W. T. Blanford has very kindly sent to me for examination an interesting collection of Chiroptera consisting of specimens obtained in Sind, in the hills near Travancore, and in Burma; representing in all twelve species, whereof I find that two are undescribed.\n\nI.\u2014Species from Sind.\n\n1. *Cynopterus marginatus*.\n\n*Pteropus marginatus*, Geoffroy, Ann. du Museum, XIV, p. 97.\nThis small species of frugivorous bat is generally distributed throughout India, but has not hitherto, so far as I know, been recorded from Sind.\n\n2. *Scotophilus Temminckii*.\n\n*Vespertilio Temminckii*, Horsfield, Zoolog. Researches in Java, (1824).\nExceedingly common in India. Specimens of this species are rarely absent from the smallest collections.\n\n3. *Scotophilus pallidus*.\n\n*Scotophilus pallidus*, Dobson, Monogr. Asiat. Chiropt. p. 186, (1876).\nThe third specimen of this species as yet obtained. It agrees in structure and in measurements with the type specimen, but the colour of the fur is darker, being light chestnut brown above, and brownish buff beneath, the base of the hairs on both surfaces pale buff.\n\nHab.

I, pl. 59B.\nThis species appears to be very generally distributed and in great abundance, in Southern India. Almost all collections from the Deccan contain examples of it. The presence of a small spine-like process at the commencement of the lower third of the outer margin of the ear-conch readily distinguishes the species from all other closely allied forms.\n\n2. *Phyllorhina fulva.*\n\n*Hipposideros fulvus*, Gray, Mag. Zool. Bot. II, p. 592, (1838).\n\nAlmost as common in Southern India as the foregoing species, and very variable in the colour of its fur, in the attachment of the wing-membrane to the posterior extremities, and in the size of the ears.\n\n3. *Megaderma lyra.*\n\n*Megaderma lyra*, Geoffroy, Ann. du Mus. XV, p. 190, (1810).\n\nThis species may be considered characteristic of the Indian and Ceylonese subregions. Its place in Burma is taken by *M. spasma*, L. It is very generally distributed throughout the Indian Peninsula, inhabiting caves, ruined buildings, and the roofs of houses.\n\n4. *Scotophilus Temminckii*, Horsfield.\n\nIII.\u2014SPECIES FROM BURMA.\n\n1. *Phyllorhina larvata.*\n\n*Rhinolophus larvatus*, Horsfield, Zoolog. Researches in Java, (1824).\n\nSpecimens agreeing in colour (bright chestnut) with others obtained at Prome, Upper Burma, by Dr. Anderson in 1868. Indian specimens of this species are darker coloured, and many have a bluish tinge.\n\nHAB. Moulmein.\n\n2. *Vesperugo (Hesperoptenus) Tickelli.*\n\n*Nycticejus Tickelli*, Blyth, J. A. S. B.

Tenasserim.\n\n3. *Vesperugo (Hesperoptenus) Blanfordi*, n. sp.\n\nHead very flat and broad; muzzle obtusely conical; nostrils opening widely apart by semi-lunate apertures, the margins of which are level with the extremity of the muzzle; ears short, triangular in outline, with broadly rounded off tips; upper half of the outer margin of the ear-conch straight, then convex, slightly concave opposite the base of the tragus, terminating abruptly in a deep lobe closer to the angle of the mouth than to the base.\nof the tragus; tragus narrowest opposite the base of its inner margin, expanded above and curved inwards.\n\nThumb short with a very acute claw; a broad adhesive cushion occupies the base of the inferior surface of the metacarpal bone and extends outwards and backwards upon the base of the metacarpal of the second finger.\n\nFeet very small, the sole of the foot apparently adhesive but not expanded as in *V. pachypus*; post-calcanean lobe remarkably large, (probably proportionately larger than in any other species of bat,) and broader than the foot, with a central cartilaginous prop: the extreme tip of the tail alone projecting.\n\nFur dark reddish-brown above, slightly paler beneath. *Penis with a distinct bone*, in shape quite similar to that of *V. Tickelli*, and with a similar prepuce.*\n\nDentition almost similar to that of *V. Tickelli*, the outer upper incisors are even smaller and placed more behind the inner incisors; the inner incisors unicuspidate and very acutely pointed; lower incisors trifid, and placed in the direction of the jaws; the single upper premolar close to the canine; the first lower premolar with a very short and obtuse cusp, the second equals three-fourths the canine in vertical extent.\n\nLength, head and body, 1\"75; tail 1\"1; head 0\"6; ear 0\"45; tragus 0\"18; forearm 1\"1; thumb 0\"15; third finger (metacarpal 1\"0; 1st ph. 0\"6; 2nd ph. 0\"6); fourth finger (metacarp. 1\"0; 1st ph. 0\"53; 2nd ph. 0\"28); fifth finger (metacarp. 0\"95; 1st ph. 0\"35; 2nd ph. 0\"22); tibia 0\"45; foot 0\"25.\n\n**Hab.** Tenasserim.\n\nThis species is about the size of *Vesperugo (Vesperus) minutus*. Temm. from South Africa, and is, therefore, one of the smallest species of the genus. It is not half the size of *V. Tickelli*, with which it agrees in other respects so closely. Its resemblance to that species in the position of the upper outer incisors, and in the form of the penis, which has a distinct bone, is very remarkable.\n\n---\n\n**XIII.\u2014Description of Spiraculum Mastersi,\u2014By W.

As no description of this curious form has ever been published, I give one.\n\nThis shell differs from all other known forms of *Spiraculum* by having the last whorl free and descending for a considerable distance, and by having, besides the sutural tube, a projection, frequently of a subtubular form, from the top of the peristome. The species has some resemblance to *Rhiostoma*, and still more to *Opisthopus birostris*.\n\n**SPIRACULUM MASTERSI.**\n\nSyn. 'Pterocycles (Sp.) Mastersi,' Blanford, MS.; Hanley and Theobald, Conch.

In a drawing which I possess, made from a living individual, the hairs on these ridges are shewn to be arranged in tufts.\nXIV.\u2014Note on two Species of Asiatic Bears, the \"Mamh\" of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n and Ursus pruinosus, Blyth, of Tibet, and on an apparently undescribed Fox from Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n.\u2014By W. T. BLANFORD, F. R. S., &c.\n\n(Received and Read Novr. 7th, 1877.)\n\nFor some years past I have endeavoured to obtain a specimen of the small bear, which is known to inhabit Baluchistan and the hilly regions of Western Sind. This bear is well known to residents in Sind by its Baluch name of \"Mamh\" or \"Mum,\" and individual animals have on rare occasions been found straying on to the alluvial flats of the Indus valley. I first heard of a dark-coloured bear in Western Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, when I accompanied Major St. John on the Perso-Baluch boundary Survey in the year 1872, but neither at that time, nor in the course of several months spent in Sind in 1875-76-77, could I procure a skin for examination. I have seen fresh tracks of the animal in the Khirthar range in Western Sind, and not only I myself, but several friends have endeavoured to obtain a specimen. Not long since a discussion took place in the columns of the 'Pioneer' newspaper as to this animal, and it was suggested that it might be a baboon, and hinted that it must be a myth. The latter hypothesis appeared supported by the extraordinary tales told of the animal by the inhabitants of the country, such as their belief that, except in the presence of man, it always walks on its hind legs, and a still more remarkable tale, that all \"Mamhs\" are females, that each seizes a man and forces him to cohabit with her, after laming him to prevent his escaping, the young be-\ning, of course, \"Mamhs\" like the mother. Probably the folk lore of Baluchistan would furnish many other wonderful stories of the animal, if enquiry were made.\n\nQuite recently my friend Major Mockler, the Political Agent at Gw\u00e1-dar on the Makr\u00e1n coast, who has very kindly been trying, for some time past, to procure this and other animals for me, obtained a skin from a Baluch chief, Mir Wajed\u00e1d of T\u00famp, about 70 miles north of Gw\u00e1-dar. This skin, which I received a few days since, had unfortunately remained for two months at Gw\u00e1-dar during Major Mockler's absence and without his knowing of its arrival, and much of the hair has consequently come off, but still there is abundance left to shew the characters of the fur. The skull is wanting, but the feet have been partly preserved.\n\nFrom the circumstance that I was assured by all my native informants both in Sind and Baluchistan that the \"Mamh\" was a black bear, I was rather inclined to anticipate that it might prove to be the common Indian sloth bear Ursus (Melursus) labiatus. We have no precise information as to the bears of Afghanistan, but Ursus isabellinus of the Western Himalayas and U. syriacus which inhabits Persia are both pale coloured animals, and although the Indian bear is not, so far as I am aware, known to occur within the Indus valley, or the desert tracts which bound that valley to the eastward, (it is mentioned by Stoliczka as a very rare straggler into the easternmost part of Cutch,) still it might of course be found in the Bal\u00fa-chist\u00e1n hills. A single glance at the skin sent by Major Mockler is however sufficient to shew that it belongs to a very different animal from the sloth bear of India. The latter has long coarse black hair and very long claws; in the Bal\u00fa-chist\u00e1n skin the hair is brown, rather short, and moderately fine, and the claws are unusually small.\n\nIt is impossible to identify the Sind and Bal\u00fa-chist\u00e1n animal with the black Ursus torquatus (commonly but most improperly known as U. tibetanus) and the only remaining bears of western and central Asia are U. arctos, U. syriacus and U. isabellinus. It is still a moot point amongst naturalists how far these forms are distinguishable, but they all agree in being large bears, considerably exceeding U. labiatus in dimensions, whilst the skin from Bal\u00fa-chist\u00e1n entirely bears out the statement made by various observers, and confirmed by all the information which I have been able to procure in Sind, that the \"Mamh\" is an exceptionally small form of the genus. Even if the present specimen be immature, the texture of the fur appears harsher, and the hairs shorter than in U. arctos and its allies, whilst the colour distinguishes the species from U. torquatus. There can I think be but little doubt that the present animal is unnamed; it may be an exceptionally small race of U. arctos, but even in this case the difference is so great as to entitle the Bal\u00fa-chist\u00e1n animal to a distinctive\nname. I propose therefore to call it, from the ancient name of the country it inhabits.\n\n**Ursus Gedrosianus**, sp. nov.\n\nSyn. *U. sp.* (?? *Melursus labiatus*) Zoology of Persia, p. 47.\n\n*Ursus minor, brunneus, torque pectorali albido, pilis breviusculis indutus, unguibus brevibus. Longitudo tota vix quinque pedes: unguibus singularibus in pede antico sesqui-pollicaribus.*\n\nThe colouration is nearly uniform, being a dark rufous brown, much the same as the ordinary tint of European individuals of *U. arctos*. The shoulders and the outside of the limbs appear to be darker than the back, the belly paler. On the breast there is a narrow white semicircular collar, the ends of which are not prolonged upwards in front of the shoulders as in *U. isabellinus*; the muzzle is whitish and the extremity of the chin white. The ears are not preserved. The claws are dark coloured, (several have been lost,) the inner claw on the fore foot measures 1\u00b76 inches in a straight line from base to tip, the second claw on the hind foot 1\u00b725 in the same manner. The sole of the hind foot, somewhat dried and contracted of course, measures 7 inches, and the whole skin, which has been dressed, but apparently not stretched, is about 4\u00bd feet long from nose to rump.\n\nThe fur, though not very coarse, is harsh and stiff, the hair is about 2\u00bd inches long on the shoulders, but not more than 1\u00bd elsewhere. The hairs are rather thin, probably from the animal having been killed in the hot season. Major Mockler writes to me that he is endeavouring to procure a better specimen and a skull, and I hope that it will be possible before long to give a more complete description of this bear and its affinities.\n\nConcerning the range of *U. Gedrosianus*, it appears to be found throughout the hills of Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n to the foot of the Persian highlands. When travelling through western Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n in 1872, Major St. John learned that the pale coloured Syrian bear replaces the dark Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n animal near Bam in Narmashir. To the west, as already noticed, the \u2018Mamh\u2019 is found in all the higher hills of western Sind, from the neighbourhood of the sea to the Bol\u00e1n pass, and it probably occurs throughout Kel\u00e1t. To the northward we know very little about bears; none are mentioned by Hutton in his \u2018Rough notes on the Zoology of Candahar,\u2019 J. A. S. B. XIV, p. 340, &c., and we have no precise information as to the kind which inhabits Afghanistan, except that Burnes (Cabool, p. 163), says it is of a reddish brown colour, which renders it possible that the species may be identical with that found in Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n.\n\nBefore describing a fox, of which two specimens were sent by Major Mockler with the skin just described, it may be as well to give a descrip-\ntion of another imperfectly known species of bear, for the skin of which I am indebted to Mr. L. Mandelli. The skin was brought to Mr. Mandelli at Darjiling by a man who said that he had purchased it at Lhassa, and that the animal inhabited the plains in the neighbourhood of that city. I could find no description of this animal until Dr. Anderson called my attention to a notice by Mr. Blyth in the Society's Journal for 1853, Vol. XXII, p. 589, of an imperfect skin, supposed to be that of a variety of the Himalayan black bear (*Ursus torquatus v. tibetanus*) for which the name *pruinosus* was suggested, should the species prove distinct. Whilst I doubt whether a name thus bestowed has any claim to recognition, I shall retain the term proposed in the present case, as it appears unobjectionable. The specimen was briefly noticed in Blyth's Catalogue of the Mammalia in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, and in Jerdon's 'Mammals', as the 'Blue Bear' of Tibet, a name under which the original specimen was sent by Dr. Campbell. The skin now received is perfect and in fair condition, but the greater part of the skull is wanting, only the jaws having been retained with the skin, and even of these the hinder teeth are defective. The animal was probably of considerable size, judging by the teeth, which are much larger than any in the skulls of *U. isabellinus* in the Museum, except in one case, of which more presently. It is manifest that the animal is distinguished by the characters of the fur, claws and dentition, from *U. torquatus*, and that it is in all probability closely allied to *U. isabellinus*, and consequently to the European bear, *U. arctos*.\n\n**Ursus pruinosus.**\n\nBlyth, J. A. S. B., 1853, XXII, p. 589,\n\n'Blue Bear' of Tibet; Blyth, Cat. Mam. Mus. As. Soc., p. 76.\u2014Jerdon, Mammals of India, p. 71.\n\n*Ursus major, affinis U. isabellino, supra fusco-fulvus, pilis dorsibus longiusculis, confertis, submollibus, nigris, fulvo-terminatis, capite humerisque fulvis, artibus nigris, unguibus pallidis fortibus.*\n\nThe general colouration above is tawny brown, palest on the head and shoulders, darker on the back, where the hairs are black with tawny tips, and black on the limbs. The head is tawny, much of the same colour as *Ursus isabellinus*, a little darker and browner under the eyes and on the forehead: the ears have tufts of long hair mixed tawny and black. Behind the head the neck is rather darker, but on the upper part of the breast there is a broad pale tawny crescentic band, with the upper terminations prolonged upwards, in front of the shoulder, almost to the back, precisely as in *U. isabellinus*. In *U. labiatus* and *U. torquatus* the band is confined to the breast, and the same appears to be the case in *U. Gedrosianus*. The upper and hinder parts of the shoulders in *U. pruinosus* are covered with tawny\nhairs about 3\u00bd to 4 inches long, whilst the interscapulary region, like the rest of the back, is clothed with black hairs, fulvous at the tips. The hair is moderately fine and about 3 inches long on the back. Apparently the animal when killed was about to lose its long winter coat, for the hair is much felted and matted together in places, and a short fine tawny hair is seen to be growing beneath. The hoary appearance given to the fur by the fulvous tips is extremely characteristic, but it may very possibly be less conspicuous at some seasons.\n\nThe claws are pale in colour, strong, and moderately curved, the first (and largest) claw on the fore foot measuring 2\u00b72 inches in a straight line from insertion to tip, and 2\u00b775 round the curve; the corresponding measurements of the first hind claw are 1\u00b73 and 1\u00b74 inches.\n\nThe animal is evidently old, several of the premolars have been lost, and the alveoli obliterated; the molars are much worn. As already mentioned, the size of the teeth and especially of the molars is unusually large; the canines appear very little larger than in *U. labiatus*. The posterior molar in the upper jaw is wanting on one side and imperfect on the other, it must be nearly 1\u00bd inches long and its anterior portion is 0\u00b788 broad, the ante-penultimate (1st true molar) measures 0\u00b79 inch in length by 0\u00b772, the tooth anterior to this or hindmost premolar is 0\u00b762 long. The three together when perfect must have measured nearly 3 inches in length. The 1st lower true molar measures 1\u00b702 long by 0\u00b753 broad, the second 1\u00b705 by 0\u00b763, the 3rd and hindmost 0\u00b783 by 0\u00b762.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that there is in the Society\u2019s old collection, now in the Indian Museum, a very large bear\u2019s skull attributed to *Ursus isabellinus*. The skull, No. 224, G. of Blyth\u2019s Catalogue is called \u201cEnormous skull from Kashmir purchased 1858,\u201d I was, I believe, with Mr. Blyth when he purchased this skull in the Calcutta Bazaar, at the shop of a dealer in all kinds of similar articles, where heads of various animals from very different parts of India were mixed together. Thus I remember myself purchasing on the same occasion an *Ovis Hodgsoni* skull and a fine frontlet of *Cervus Duvaucelli*; one of course from Tibet originally, the other from the plains of India. I should consequently attach no importance whatever to the supposed locality.\n\nNow the teeth of this large bear\u2019s skull resemble those in the jaws of Mr. Mandelli\u2019s specimen of *Ursus pruinosus* so closely, that it is by no means improbable that both may have belonged to the same species. The former is larger than any other skull of *Ursus isabellinus* in the Museum and the molar teeth are unusually large, though still inferior in size to those of *U. pruinosus*. The following are a few dimensions:\n\nLength from anterior edge of *foramen magnum* to end of premaxillaries, ................................................................. 12\u00b75\nBreadth across hinder portion of zygomatic arches, ...................... 8\u00b78\nBreadth of frontal bones between orbits, .................................. 3\u00b73\nBreadth of palate between posterior molars, ............................... 1\u00b79\nLength of 3 posterior molars in upper jaw, ................................. 2\u00b77\nLength of lower jaw from angle to symphysis, ............................. 9\u00b78\n\nThe bears of India and the neighbouring regions, so far as known, now consist of the following species:\n\n*Ursus Malayanus.* Malay Peninsula and Burma to Arakan.\n\n*U. torquatus.* Forest region of the Himalayas, and, it is said, the hills South of Assam.\n\n*U. pruinosus.* Plains of Eastern Tibet.\n\n*U. isabellinus.* Western Himalayas, chiefly above the forests, unknown in Tibet, and even in the Upper Indus Valley, Ladakh, &c.\n\n*U. (Melursus) labiatus.* Plains and hills of Peninsular India and Ceylon, extending, it is said, into the hills South of Assam.\n\n*U. Gedrosianus.* Hills of Western Sind.\n\nOf the above *U. pruinosus* is the only species not found within Indian limits. The discovery that *Ursus pruinosus* is widely different from *U. torquatus* removes the last excuse for applying to the latter animal a name derived from a country in which no such species exists. The range of *Ursus torquatus* has now been fairly ascertained to be Cis-Himalayan in Southern Asia, although some naturalists refer bears from Japan and Eastern Siberia to the same species, and as the use of the specific name *Tibetanus* involves a serious error, some other term should be substituted.\n\nFortunately in this instance there is no need to suggest a new name, for Wagner,* in 1841, proposed to call this bear *U. torquatus* on the ground that the animal not being known in Tibet, the original name given by Cuvier was inappropriate. Wagner's name was adopted by Schinz\u2020, and subsequently by Dr. J. E. Gray\u2021, who however appears to quote Schinz as its author. Mr. Blyth, in the 'Catalogue of the Mammalia in the Museum Asiatic Society,' p. 77, referred *U. torquatus*, Schinz, to *U. labiatus*, but this is evidently a mistake, as can be seen from Schinz's description and from the facts mentioned above. It is probable that Mr. Blyth, who worked under the disadvantage of having a very imperfect scientific library at command, took the reference from some other authority.\n\nNo one can be more averse than I am in general to changing specific names, but I think, following the British Association rule, that a name\n\n* Schrober, S\u00e4ugethiere, Supplement band, II, p. 144.\n\u2020 Syn. Mam., I, p. 302.\n\u2021 P. Z. S., 1864, p. 688; Cat. Carn. Pach. Edent. Mam., Brit. Mus., 1869, p. 225.\nshould be altered when it involves serious error, that the change is justified in the present instance.\n\nWith the skin of *Ursus Gedrosianus*, Major Mockler sent to me two well-preserved skins and a perfect skeleton of a singularly small and very grey fox, with the following note: 'I send two skins and a skeleton of the \"Poh\" which seems to be a very diminutive fox. They were shot by one of my \"sepoyes in the hills about 15 miles from Gwadar; he sat up at night for them over water, and threw about some dates and fish as bait.'\n\nThe \"Poh\" appears to me to be the same as the small Bushire fox, which, in the Zoology of Persia,* I referred, with doubt, after examining a young living specimen at the Zoological Gardens in London, to *Canis famelicus*,\u2020 R\u00fcpp. That the present animal must however be distinct from that described by R\u00fcppell is, I think, shewn by the dimensions: in *Canis famelicus* the length of the head is 5 inches 6 lines, (French measure = 5\u00b785 English,) and the whole length from nose to end of tail 2 ft. 10 in. (about 3 feet English,) of which the tail is 1 ft. 2 in. (1 ft. 3 in. English). Now in the little Baluchistan fox, the skull is only about 3\u00bd inches long and the whole length of the skeleton 2 ft. 7 in. of which about 1 ft. 1 in. belong to the tail. It is not clear whether R\u00fcppell in measuring the tail included the hair at the end, if he did, that would account for 2 or 3 inches of the length and the present animal would have a proportionally longer tail, but in any case, allowing for the probability that the measurements given in R\u00fcppell's work are from a stuffed specimen, the difference in the size of the head is quite inconsistent with the identification of the Baluchistan animal with *Canis famelicus*. The colour moreover in the former is much greyer, and the chesnut dorsal stripe of *C. famelicus* wanting or very faintly represented. I propose to name the Baluchistan fox from its grey colour.\n\n**Vulpes canus**, sp. nov.\n\n'Vulpes famelicus?'

In one specimen the ears are more dusky than in the other, which is shewn by the teeth of the skull to have been an aged animal. The hair of the body is soft and long, the longest hairs on the middle of the back being about 2 inches in length, with much fine under fur of a grey colour, dark ashy in one specimen, pale ashy in the other, the longer hairs on the back are black near the ends, the tips of many being white. On the anterior portion of the back in one specimen, the hairs are rufous between the grey base and the blackish tip, and the rufous colour extends along the back of the neck. This imperfectly marked rufous colour doubtless represents the chestnut stripe in *V. famelica*. The gape and chin are dusky, the breast ashy grey, the abdomen white. The fore legs are pale rufescent in the older specimen, dusky grey in the younger, the hind legs rufous brown outside in the one animal, dusky black in the other, the tail is very bushy, the hairs grey or white with long black ends above and at the tip, so that the tail appears blackish except below, where it is white or nearly white. The skins are too much stretched for their measurement to be of any use, except in the case of the tail, which measures 15 to 16 inches; of this the hairs at the end are about 2\u00bd in. The measurements above given are founded on the skeleton.\n\nThe skull, which, as already mentioned, is that of an aged animal, is very small and almost destitute of crests. The hinder portion of the brain pan is much rounded and the small occipital crest very low on the back of the head, being in fact about equally distant from the *foramen magnum* and the top of the skull. The following are measurements of this skull:\n\n| Measurement Description                                      | Inches | Metre |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Length from occipital crest to anterior termination of premaxillae | 3.65   | 0.92  |\n| \" from anterior margin of *foramen magnum* to do.             | 3.35   | 0.84  |\n| \" of suture between nasal bones                                | 1.12   | 0.28  |\n| Breadth of nasal portion of skull at posterior termination of premaxillae | 0.57   | 0.14  |\n| \" of frontal region behind postorbital processes              | 0.73   | 0.18  |\n| \" of brain case where widest across parietal region            | 1.4    | 0.25  |\n| \" of skull across zygomatic arches                             | 2.02   | 0.505 |\nLength of bony palate from anterior termination of premaxill\u00e6 to opening of posterior nares, (measured to end of small posterior projecting process in the middle of the palate,) ... 1\u00b785 \u00b7047\n\nBreadth of bony palate between penultimate molars (1st true molars,) ......................... 0\u00b747 \u00b7012\n\nLength of last upper premolar, ...................... 0\u00b738 \u00b70095\n\n\" of 1st molar, .................................. 0\u00b726 \u00b70065\n\nBreadth of do., .................................... 0\u00b737 \u00b7009\n\nOf the limb bones the humerus is 8\u00b71 inches long, the radius 3, the femur 3\u00b713, and the tibia 3\u00b758.\n\nP. S.\u2014Since the preceding description of Ursus Gedrosianus was in type, Dr. Duke has written to the 'Pioneer' to say that he has received two imperfect skins of a 'Mamh' obtained near Quetta, and that they are black. It remains to be seen whether the black and brown bears of Baluchistan are varieties or distinct. The former is more probable.\n\nXV.\u2014On an apparently new hare, and some other mammalia from Gilgit.\n\n\u2014By W. T. Blanford, F. R. S.\n\n(Received and Read Novr. 7th, 1877.)\n\nA small collection of mammals made in the course of last year by Captain Biddulph in the extreme north-western part of Kashmir was left by him in the Indian Museum, with a request that I would examine the specimens. The skins comprise a fox, an otter, a hare, a Lagomys, and a mouse.\n\nThe fox appears to me to be probably a form of Vulpes montanus in summer dress. A similar specimen was obtained by Captain Biddulph in K\u00e1shghar and made over by him to Dr. Stoliczka. The fur is very short; there being, in fact, scarcely anything but the underfur left, and even that is thin. Under these conditions the colour differs widely from that of V. montanus in its winter garb, and most skins are taken when the fur is in fine condition. The specimen is from Hanza (probably a place of that name N. N. E. of Gilgit), and was obtained at an elevation of 8000 feet. Another precisely similar, except that the ears were less black, was also procured.\n\nIn the skin before me, the face is rufous, deepest in front of the eyes, the ears sooty black outside, the middle of the back ferruginous with a brown tinge from the under fur, a very distinct rufous cross band on the shoulders, so as to form a marked cross on the back, and the sides of the body very pale. Lower parts dirty white. Tail not full, very woolly, (as is the fur generally,) slightly rufous above, elsewhere dirty white mixed with\nblack hairs, the tail-tip white. Legs rufous externally with dark hairs intermixed.\n\nThe otter-skin unfortunately wants the skull, and it is impossible to determine it accurately. It has evidently belonged to a large form, approaching *Lutra vulgaris* in size, but it is much paler in colour. The upper parts are somewhat light brown, the under fur being very pale whitish brown at the base, then rich wood-brown, rather rufous, with numerous longer hairs mixed, which have whitish tips, giving a pale speckled appearance to the fur. On the lower parts the under fur is white at the base, then light brown, with long white hairs intermixed, so that the general colour is slightly sullied white. The whiskers are white. Sides of the head below the ears and eyes, chin, and throat rather whiter than the breast and abdomen.\n\nThis animal may belong to the Central and Northern Asiatic species, referred by various naturalists to *L. vulgaris*. The exact locality is not given, but the specimen was doubtless obtained on the upper Indus or one of its tributaries.\n\nOf the mouse only a dried skin is preserved. The locality is marked 'Hunza 8000 feet,' and is probably the place already mentioned. I am unable to identify this skin with any known species: it closely resembles *Mus Bactrianus*, but appears distinguished by having the upper surface of the tail very much darker than the lower and by longer feet. The colour above is brown, below whitish, the tail dark brown above, pale isabelline below, feet whitish. The skin measures from nose to rump 2\u00b76, tail very little above 2, tarsus without claws 0\u00b775. I do not like to propose a new name on the amount of evidence before me. *M. Bactrianus* is said by Jerdon to have been sent from Kashmir, the only localities given by Blyth however are in the Panjab. I have since obtained this mouse from various parts of Sind, from Ajmere, where it has been found by Major St. John, and throughout many parts of Baluchistan and Southern Persia. It is possible that the Hanza mouse may be merely a variety.\n\nThe hare I am unable to identify with any known species and I therefore propose to name it from its discoverer.\n\n*Lepus Biddulphi*, sp. nov.\n\n*L. minor*, ad L. Tibetanum, L. Pamirensimque proxime accedens, supra pallide rufescens, pilorum apicibus nigris intermixtis, infra albus, caudae superne nigrae, uropygio cum dorso concolore, auribus mediocribus, apicibus ad marginem nigris, collo pectoreoque pallide rufescentibus; vellere molli, longiusculo, ad basin cinereo.

Angl.\nHab. in Yassin (Gilgit) provincid ad Kashmir pertinente, ultra flumen Indum jacente.\n\nThe general colour above is rather pale rufous, with a dusky wash caused by the tips of the longer hairs being black. There does not appear, in the only skin I have examined, to be the grey rump of *L. Pamirensis* and several other Central Asiatic species. The forehead and central portion of the muzzle is pale rufescent grey, the hairs rufous ashy at the base, then brown, and isabelline at the tips. The sides of the head are paler, but a few black tips are found on the hairs of the cheeks. There is a pale ill-defined band on each side of the muzzle, including the eye. Whiskers black at the base, white towards the end; some wholly white. Anterior portion of the ears outside nearly the same colour as the forehead, hair soft, not so dense and harsh as in *L. Pamirensis*, posterior portion of outer surface pale rufous, extreme tip of ear black outside, the black running about a third of the way down the posterior edge. Neck all round and breast pale rufous, hairs ashy at the base and pale tipped, except on the nape. Fur of body soft, on the hinder part of the back the hair is about 1\u00bd inches long, and consists of coarser piles mixed with fine woolly under fur. Throughout the dorsal portion the hair is ashy at the base, then isabelline, followed by a brown ring, the end being pale rufous, except in the longest hairs, which are tipped black. Tail sooty black above. Limbs externally pale rufous. Underparts white.\n\nThe skull of *Lepus Biddulphi* differs from that of *L. Tibetanus* in the following characters. The parietals are broader and flatter, the width of the frontals greater and they are somewhat more convex just behind the post-orbital processes. The nasals are truncated behind, the angle formed by the junction of the posterior and exterior margins being a right angle as in *L. Stoliczkanus* and *L. Yarkandensis*, differing in this respect from *L. Tibetanus*, *L. Pamirensis*, and *L. hypsibius*. The hinder extremities of the premaxill\u00e6 are parallel with the hinder margin of the nasals, the jugal is narrower vertically. The muzzle is less high and the whole skull flatter. The palatal opening is smaller and differently formed behind. The opening of the posterior nares is narrower. The lower jaw is much less high.\n\nThe nearest approach to the skull of *L. Biddulphi*, amongst the species of which specimens are available for comparison, is made by the hare which inhabits the Karakash valley between Ladak and Yarkand. This species much resembles *L. pallipes* of Hodgson from the portion of Tibet north of Nepal and Sikkim. In the skull of the Karakash hare, however, the nasals extend backwards to some distance beyond the terminations of the premaxill\u00e6, the zygomatic arch is broader and more convex beneath, the postorbital processes are differently shaped and the whole skull larger.\nThe skull, extracted from the skin, is imperfect behind, and the length cannot be measured. It was probably under $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The following are some of the dimensions:\n\n| Description                                                                 | In. | Met. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|------|\n| Length of suture between nasal bones                                      | 1\u00b723| 0\u00b731 |\n| Greatest breadth across hinder portion of zygomatic arches                | 1\u00b76 | 0\u00b74  |\n| Breadth of brain case behind glenoid fossa                                | 1\u00b717| 0\u00b729 |\n| Breadth of frontal region where narrowest behind post-orbital processes   | 0\u00b757| 0\u00b714 |\n| Breadth of nasals where widest near posterior termination                  | 0\u00b762| 0\u00b716 |\n| \" at anterior end                                                          | 0\u00b751| 0\u00b713 |\n| Length of bony palate behind anterior palatal orifices                     | 0\u00b725| 0\u00b706 |\n| Width of do. between anterior molars                                       | 0\u00b745| 0\u00b711 |\n| Length of row upper molars                                                 | 0\u00b761| 0\u00b715 |\n| \" of lower jaw from angle to symphysis                                     | 2\u00b725| 0\u00b757 |\n| Height do. to condyle                                                      | 1\u00b732| 0\u00b733 |\n\nThe Lagomys I find somewhat difficult to determine. Captain Biddupha has collected two specimens, one from the Gilgit district, obtained at an elevation of 10,000 feet, the other from the Kishengunga valley, at 7500 ft. On the whole these specimens appear to me to agree best with L. auritus, the species inhabiting the Indus valley in Ladak at moderate elevations, but the ears, so far as can be judged, are much smaller, scarcely exceeding in size those of L. Roylei. The dimensions however appear larger than those of L. Roylei, and the fur is much longer and softer. The colouration of the upper parts is greyish brown, the face being rufous to a variable extent, and there being in both skins a marked rufous patch below the ears, (the glandular patch noticed in skins of some species of Lagomys by Dr. G\u00fcnther; Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. Septr. 1875, Ser. 4, Vol. XVI, p. 230,) though this is evidently a variable character, for whilst in one skin, and this has the forehead less rufous than the other, the patch below the ear is ferruginous, and the breast, shoulders and flanks rufous, in the other skin the tinge is much fainter and is confined to the sides of the neck. The lower parts are white, faintly tinged with rufous in one specimen, the blackish basal portion of the hair shewing conspicuously.\n\nThe skull is very near that of both L. auritus and L. Roylei; from that of the former it only differs in having the nasals a little broader behind, and the orbits a trifle smaller, and from that of the latter by\nsimilar small differences. Neither the external characters nor the skull agree with *L. rufescens*.\n\nThe following is a summarized list of the species above discussed:\n\n1. *Vulpes montanus*.\n2. *Lutra*, either *L. vulgaris*, var. or an allied species.\n3. *Mus*, probably new, allied to *M. Bactrianus*.\n4. *Lepus Biddulphi*, sp. nov.\n5. *Lagomys auritus*? var.\n\n---\n\n**XVI.\u2014On a supposed new Sheep from the Central Hills of Kelat.\u2014By**\n\n**A. O. Hume.**\n\n(Received 30th October; Read 7th November, 1877.)\n\n(With plate IV.)\n\nI received last year from Major Sandeman, C. S. I., Political Superintendent of Kelat, the head and horns of a sheep which he supposed to be the same as the oorial (*Ovis cycloceros*) and which had been obtained in the Hills above the Bolan pass.\n\nDirectly I saw these horns I was struck with their greater length and slenderness, and their peculiar twist, and after comparing them with two specimens of *O. Vignei*, and numerous specimens of *O. cycloceros*, and the description of *O. Gmelini*, the head appears to me to belong to a hitherto undescribed species.\n\nIn all these three species, as far as I can make out, each horn lies in one plane, whereas in the present species the horn twists out, in a capital S. fashion. There is in fact much the same difference between the horns of the present species and of *O. cycloceros*, that there is between those of *O. Karelensi*, and *O. Hodgsoni*.\n\nIt seems to me not impossible that this species may be one at any rate of the wild stocks from which the domesticated breed originated.\n\nI propose to name this sheep\n\n*Ovis blanfordi.*\n\nafter my friend Mr. W. T. Blanford, our well known Zoologist and Geologist.\n\nThe following are the dimensions of the skull and horns with corresponding dimensions of those of a specimen of *O. cycloceros*, of apparently the same age, viz., about 8 years. In the case of each measurement, the dimension first given is that of *O.

Vignei*.\n\nThe frontal ridge between the bases of the horns is less developed in *O. Blanfordi*, and in this latter the posterior convex margin of the bony palate is differently shaped, being more pointed and not nearly semicircular as in *O. cycloceros*.\n\nAlthough this was promised me, I have not, I regret to say, as yet received any skin of this sheep; but I should hope that the dimensions above given, accompanied by an accurate drawing, would suffice to enable other observers to identify this supposed new species.\n\nXVII.\u2014Catalogue of the recorded Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, up to the end of 1876, compiled by Henry F. Blanford, Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India.\n\nThe following list was drawn up with a view to ascertaining with greater accuracy than had previously been practicable, what is the distribution of cyclones at the different seasons of the year, and also what parts of the Bay are most liable to storms, in each season of the year. The general results arrived at on these heads have been announced in my lately published work \"The Indian Meteorologist's Vade Mecum.\"\nThe basis of the present catalogue has been furnished by the two lists published by Dr. Buist in Vols. xii and xiv, of the Transactions of the Bombay Geographical Society, and that given by Mr. Piddington in the Sailor's Horn Book,* accompanying a chart of the storm tracks. To these I have added a considerable number of storms, notices of which I have gathered from other sources, and also those recorded in recent years in the Reports of the Meteorological Department. A few evident errors in Dr. Buist's catalogues (possibly arising from misprints) have been corrected, and attention has been drawn to some doubtful cases.\n\nThe several authorities referred to are designated in the Catalogue by the following symbols:\n\nB. i.

Harding, Esq., with a prefatory note by Henry F. Blanford.\n\nIn the Society's Journal, Part II, No. 1 of 1877, I published a short paper on the Variation of the Barometric Tides in connection with the Diurnal Land and Sea-breezes, in which the diurnal variation of pressure over the Bay of Bengal between latitude 20\u00b0 and the Sand-heads, in the month of January, was deduced from the ship observations recorded in the log-books collected by the London Meteorological Office. The method pursued in dealing with these observations was a very rough one, and by no means the best that might have been adopted; and I assumed (what I now admit was not justified) that the observations dealt with were sufficiently numerous to yield mean values for each hour of observation which should be comparable with each other.\n\nA few weeks ago I received from Captain H. Toynbee, the Superintendent of Marine Meteorology in the London Meteorological Office, the following Memorandum, which was drawn up at his request by Mr. Chas. Harding, and as it furnishes an important correction to the results given in my paper above referred to, I have much satisfaction in communicating it to the Society.\n\nH. F. B.\n\nIn glancing through Mr. Blanford's paper on the Variation of the Barometric Tides in connection with diurnal land and sea-breezes I was much struck by the diagram on p. 48, which shows the afternoon minimum, deduced from the sea observations, to be considerably less marked than the morning minimum; and from para. 2, p. 47, I gather that the pith of the paper depends greatly upon the shallowness of this afternoon minimum.\n\nThe discussion of the diurnal range of barometer observations at sea, in the neighbourhood of the equator, in the North Atlantic, (see Official No. 20, published by the Meteorological Office) in no way supports this excess of depression in the morning minimum, and the experience derived from that discussion has suggested to me a probable cause of much of the difference exhibited by Mr. Blanford.\n\nI rather fail to reproduce the mean results given by Mr. Blanford, but I see sufficient to warrant me in inferring that whatever observations he has allowed to enter into the discussion have been summed up as follows: if the part of the ocean under discussion yielded sixty-four noon observations, thirty-eight 4 p.m. observations, &c., the sixty-four noon observations were meaned and the mean compared with the mean of the thirty-eight 4 p.m. observations.\n\nI have quite ignored that I might refer to the original logs, and have considered myself restricted to the observations as given in the \"Data\nBooks\" and have dealt with the observations obtained from that source in a manner which as far as I can see is open to very little objection, and which is probably the best possible method under the circumstances.\n\nI have meant all the noon observations for an absolute reading, and for the means of the other 4-hourly periods have worked on the absolute differences which are obtainable from the various observations recorded: for example, working all the obtainable differences of 4 p.m. observations on noon observations for the same day, and finally meaning these differences, and applying the mean difference to the noon mean already obtained for a 4 p.m. mean:\u2014so on for all the other 4-hourly periods. The method has been to take noon as a centre and work on differences at each side of it. The midnight observation has thus been obtained, by working backwards and forwards from noon, and the difference of the two results is only .002 in.\n\nThe results for the 4-hourly periods are as follows, using all the sea data between 20\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 N. and 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 E.\n\n| 4 A.M. | 8 A.M. | Noon. | 4 P.M. | 8 P.M. | Midt. | Mean. |\n|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------|\n| 29.996 | 30.056 | 30.041 | 29.987 | 30.029 | 30.024 | 30.022 |\n| -.026  | +.034   | +.019  | -.035  | +.007  | +.002  | {diff. from Daily M.}\n\nI have computed Bessel's constants from the 4-hourly values, and the expression is as follows:\n\n\\[ x = 30.022 + .0136 \\sin(n.15\u00b0 + 320\u00b05') + .0311 \\sin(n.30\u00b0 + 160\u00b042') + .0002 \\sin(n.45\u00b0 + 90\u00b0). \\]\n\nFrom the constants, the following hourly values for the sea observations have been computed: they are given side by side with the hourly values of sea observations deduced by Mr. Blanford and with those of Calcutta.\n\n| Hour. | Calcutta. | Sea [C.H.] | Sea [Mr. Blanford.] |\n|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|\n|       | 30.011    | 30.022      | 30.022              |\n| Midt. | +.003     | +.002       | +.016               |\n| 1 A.M.| -.006     | -.011       | -.001               |\n| 2     | -.015     | -.023       | -.021               |\n| 3     | -.021     | -.028       | -.037               |\n| 4     | -.024     | -.026       | -.042               |\n| 5     | -.020     | -.016       | -.033               |\n| 6     | -.005     | -.000       | -.013               |\n| 7     | +.021     | +.018       | +.010               |\n| 8     | +.050     | +.034       | +.028               |\n| 9     | +.072     | +.043       | +.037               |\n| 10    | +.078     | +.043       | +.035               |\n| 11    | +.062     | +.035       | +.024               |\nAtmospheric Pressure at the Sandheads.\n\n| Time   | Noon | 1 p.m. | 2 \"   | 3 \"   | 4 \"   | 5 \"   | 6 \"   | 7 \"   | 8 \"   | 9 \"   | 10 \"  | 11 \"  |\n|--------|------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|        | + .032 | - .002 | - .031 | - .048 | - .054 | - .051 | - .040 | - .024 | - .007 | + .006 | + .012 | + .010 |\n|        | - .019 | .000   | - .018 | - .031 | - .035 | - .031 | - .021 | - .007 | + .007 | + .016 | + .018 | + .013 |\n|        | - .011 | .001   | - .010 | - .014 | - .016 | - .016 | - .014 | - .008 | + .002 | + .014 | + .023 | + .024 |\n\nThe above observations are plotted in the following diagram.\n\nThick line\u2014Sandheads.

The specimens described by De Haan were from Sumatra, those by Gray from the Malabar Coast. I have also a specimen of the female presented to me by my late friend Dr. Stoliczka, which was said by him to have been brought from Java.\n\nThe following are the measurements of two of the typical specimens\n\n---\n\nSimilarly, the metallic coloured *Mantis*, of which my native collector obtained numerous examples at this same place, has proved identical with the species (*Metallestes splendida*) described many years ago by Westwood from Malabar. The species, like so many other metallic insects (*e.g.*, notably *Chiloloba acuta*, of which fiery red with all the fire of the opal, green, and blue specimens, with all connecting shades, can be collected at Sahibganj in a few minutes; *Heterorrhina elegans*, and other *Cetoniidae*;) exhibits the phenomenon of dichroism, the blue (*M. violacea*) being structurally perfectly indistinguishable from those that are green with coppery reflections (*M. splendida*). To place the matter beyond all doubt I submitted specimens of each form for comparison with the type to Professor Westwood, who also was unable to detect any difference between them save that of colour.\n\nThe larvae are all coloured, as to their legs and bodies, like the blue form of the imago, thus exhibiting, as appears to me probable, an ancestral phase; and if this be so, then the dimorphism would in this case, at any rate, be interpretable as the retention, throughout life, of larval, that is, ancestral, characters by certain individuals of both sexes; and this may be the true nature of dimorphism in insects in general. But we are as far as ever from understanding what profit or advantage it can be to a species to exist under two or more different forms.\npreserved in the British Museum with Gray's own names and the locality (Malabar) still attached to them:\n\n\u2642.

India' or 'Madras.' Animals localized in this unprecise manner are all valuable enough as specimens of the species to which they belong, but they have no higher value.\nThe specimen agrees perfectly with the type in the British Museum, which however has lost the long and conspicuous supra-anal plate.\n\nThere can hardly be a doubt that Bates' *L. auscultator* is the male.\n\n**Lonchodes Crawangensis.**\n\n*Phasma Crawangense*, De Haan, Orthopt.

Total length 3 inches 3\u00b775 lines; head 1\u00b75; proth. 1\u00b775; mesoth. 9\u00b775; metath. 4\u00b775; abd. 18\u00b725 + 3\u00b775 = 22; antenn\u00e6 3 inches 5 lines. (*Type*).\n\n\u2640. Total length 4 in. 0\u00b75 line; head 2\u00b75; proth. 2\u00b775; mesoth. 11\u00b725; metath. 5\u00b725; abd. 22 + 4\u00b775 = 26\u00b775 lines; antenn\u00e6 3 inches 8 lines.\n\nThe typical specimen of the female in the India (formerly East India Company's) Museum, S. Kensington, a much shrivelled and mutilated insect, wanting the terminal segment of the abdomen, is rather larger and consequently proportionately slightly longer as to the mesothorax than the specimen of which the measurements are given above: in it the mesothorax and metathorax exactly measure 13\u00b75 and 5\u00b775 lines respectively.\nHAB. The only precise locality for the species which it is at present in my power to give is S\u00e1mag\u00fat\u00edng, N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, whence specimens preserved in alcohol have been sent to me by Captain J. Butler, and are now in the Indian Museum.\n\nThe organs of flight have entirely disappeared from this as well as from the following species.\n\n5. LOPAPHUS BAUCIS, Pl.

Abundant in the neighbourhood of Sibs\u00e1gar, Assam, whence I have received numerous individuals of both sexes\u2014dried as well as in alcohol\u2014from my valued correspondent, Mr. S. E. Peal, to whom I am also indebted for coloured sketches and much information respecting Phasmidae and other Arthropods. And apparently throughout the N. E. frontier country.\n\nThe accompanying figures were taken from one of the numerous specimens collected by Mr. Peal.\n\nI have examined the typical specimen of the female preserved in the National Collection, and I find that the stiff brown bristles figured and described by Westwood as fringing the sides of the abdomen at its base are present on one side of the body only, that they have no organic connection with the integument of the insect, and that some similar bristles lie scattered quite irregularly over the basal joints of the adjacent leg, like pelicans spilled upon a table; moreover, no trace of such setae is detectible in a specimen of the same sex and species placed alongside of the type in the same drawer, nor in any one of the multitude of specimens in the Indian Museum. The set\u00e6, which are apparently of a vegetable nature, have evidently got jammed between the dorsal and ventral arcs of the segments as the membrane connecting these at the sides contracted in drying.\n\nNecroscia Ph\u00e6tusa.\n\nN.

Gargantua, which from the mutilated condition of the terminal segments of the abdomen and from the presence of ocelli he had felt compelled to describe as a male, was in reality of the opposite sex, he at once pointed out N. Ph\u00e6tusa \u2642 as its true and legitimate partner.\n\nHAB. A perfect specimen of the female, captured by my native collector on Sinkieb Island, is in the Indian Museum. The typical specimens\nin the Hopeian collection at Oxford were both collected by Mr. A. R. Wallace, at Sarawak, in Borneo.\n\nObs. It is possible that the Sinkieb specimen, when actually compared with Westwood's typical one, may turn out to differ in much the same manner as the species of *Bacteria* from the same island does from *B. Sarawaca*, Westw.\n\n**Necroscia Hilaris.**\n\n*Phasma (Necroscia) hilare*, Westwood, Cab. Orient. Entom. p. 77, pl. 38, fig. 1, \u2640 (Assam).\n\n*Necroscia hilaris*, id., Monogr.

Mandelli*) and from the neighbourhood of Sibs\u00e1gar, Assam (*S. E. Peal*); but the identification of the male as *N.

Head large, oblong, parallel-sided; vertex divided by three notches into four tubercles. Pronotum shorter and narrower than the head, flat, with a few minute granules. Mesothorax slightly tapering from the insertion of the legs forwards, granulate above and below and on the sides; its dorsal arc longitudinally carinate, granulate along the top of the ridge and at the edges. Abdomen tapering slightly from the base to the emarginate apex, which carries a longitudinally carinate semioval plate; its terminal segments, dorsal and ventral, constructed much as in *Necroscia Salmanazar*, *N. maculicollis*, and *N. Sparazes*, in all three of which also the sixth ventral segment is furnished at its hinder extremity with a peculiarly shaped process, which serves as the point d'appui for the claspers of the male during copulation.* Legs long and stout; the fore tibiae and the femora and the tibiae of the two posterior pairs subtriquetrous and carinate along the middle of the under surface. Tegmina oval, with but a slight compressed conical elevation of the carina. Wings reaching about to the end of the fifth abdominal segment; the costal area luteous brown, like the body and legs; the costal vein divided at the middle of its length, the two branches uniting again near the extremity; posterior area milk-white, conspicuously\n\n* A fact ascertained by actual observation in *N. maculicollis*.\ntessellated with dark smoky-quartz-colour, all the transverse veinlets being broadly and distinctly margined on each side with this colour.\n\n\"Total length 3 inches 7 lines; head 3\u00b725 lines, prothorax 2\u00b75, mesothorax 7\u00b725; abdomen 1 inch 8 lines + 4 = 2 inches; antennae 2 inches 5 lines; wings 1 inch 10 lines; tegmina 5\u00b75 lines; fore femur 12\u00b775 lines, tibia 14\u00b75, tarsus 6\u00b775; intermediate femur 8\u00b75 lines, tibia 9\u00b75, tarsus 5; posterior femur 13\u00b75 lines, tibia 14, tarsus 5\u00b775.\n\n\"Hab.

Davison, to whom I have since been indebted for a fine series of specimens of the same species all taken by him from one lime-tree at Malewoon in the Mergui District; these differ from the typical ones only in their rather smaller size, and are of value in proving that I had correctly paired my insects on structural grounds alone. Amongst this series of specimens are larvae of the male, which shall be figured and described on a future occasion, as they show, in their lozenge-shaped abdomen, it is hardly doubtful, an ancestral phase of the species, and thus point to *Ph. Gergon* of the Philippines, which is lozenge-shaped as to the abdomen in the adults of both sexes.\n\n1. **Phyllium lobiventre.**\n\n*Ph. lobiventre*, Blanchard in Dumont d'Urville, Voy. au P\u00f4le Sud, Zoologie, iv, 359, Orthopt. pl. i, fig. 9, \u2642.\n\n\"Westwood, Monogr.
