It has an area of 4792 square miles, a population in 1881 of 1,062,350 or 221 to the square mile, and a land revenue in 1882 of \u00a3231,199 (Rs. 23,11,990).\n\nThe district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra includes part of the state of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra which lapsed to the British in 1843, together with the sub-division of T\u00e1sgaon which was formerly in Belgaum. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is bounded on the north by the Nira river and the states of Bhor and Phaltan, and beyond them by Poona; on the east by Shol\u00e1pur, the \u00c1tp\u00e1di subdivision of the Pant Pratinidhi state, and the state of Jath; on the south by the lands of the S\u00e1ngli branch of the Patvardhan family, a few villages of Belgaum, the V\u00e1rna river, and, beyond the V\u00e1rna river, by Kolh\u00e1pur; and on the west by the Sahy\u00e1dris, and beyond the Sahy\u00e1dris by the Konkan districts of Kol\u00e1ba and Ratn\u00e1giri.\n\nFor administrative purposes S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is distributed over eleven sub-divisions. Of these seven, W\u00e1i, J\u00e1vli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Koregaon, P\u00e1tan, Kar\u00e1d, and V\u00e1lva are in the west; and four, M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and T\u00e1sgaon are in the east:\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra Administrative Details 1882-83.\n\n| Sub-Division | Area | Villages | Hamlets | Government | Alienated | Total | People | Land Revenue |\n|--------------|------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|-------|--------|--------------|\n|              |      | Inhabited | Uninhabited | Inhabited | Uninhabited | Total | 1881 | To the Square Mile | 1882 |\n| W\u00e1i          | 380  | 92       | 80       | 35         | 32         | 92    | 35     | 127           | 88,610 | 227\u00b720 | 19,556 |\n| J\u00e1vli        | 419  | 181      | 1        | 59         | 71         | 32    | 11     | 152           | 71     | 253    | 63,729 | 162\u00b709 | 9702  |\n| S\u00e1t\u00e1ra       | 340  | 106      | 97       | 42         | 30         | 108   | 15     | 123           | 913    | 118,913 | 674\u00b772 | 26,916 |\n| Koregaon     | 340  | 115      | 56       | 15         | 8          | 50    | 16     | 74            | 51     | 126    | 32,878 | 84,898 |\n| P\u00e1tan        | 431  | 115      | 2        | 170        | 87         | 143   | 117    | 205           | 112,414 | 260\u00b752 | 15,600 |\n| Kar\u00e1d        | 391  | 74       | 102      | 30         | 1        | 24    | 74     | 31           | 105    | 140,920 | 860\u00b740 | 34,893 |\n| V\u00e1lva        | 545  | 98       | 1        | 80         | 40        | 28    | 99     | 40           | 139    | 169,408 | 810\u00b784 | 44,138 |\n| M\u00e1n          | 625  | 72       | 96       | 6          | 7         | 72    | 6      | 78            | 52,111 | 83\u00b787  | 8420   |\n| Khat\u00e1v       | 499  | 54       | 61       | 18         | 30        | 2     | 13     | 2            | 55      | 82     | 46,074 | 145\u00b745 | 15,464 |\n| Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur     | 509  | 41       | 64       | 22         | 1         | 30    | 25     | 61            | 91     | 50,327 | 157\u00b731 | 15,662 |\n| T\u00e1sgaon      | 825  | 35       | 28       | 10         | 14        | 7     | 35     | 14           | 49     | 79,704 | 246\u00b745 | 17,437 |\n| Total        | 4792 | 955      | 5        | 876        | 82         | 392   | 4      | 325           | 16     | 940    | 336    | 1,062,350 | 221\u00b769 | 231,199 |\n\nB 1282\u20141\nIn addition to the territories which form the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district, a large area of land is under the supervision of the Collector as Political Agent. This additional territory includes the Bhor state in the north-west, Phaltan in the north, the Aundh state in the east, and Dafl\u00e1pur and beyond it Jath in the extreme south-east. Of these territories the lands of Bhor begin from the north-west corner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to the north of the Mah\u00e1dev hills. From the Mah\u00e1dev hills, with a breadth varying from thirty-five miles in the south to fifteen miles in the north, Bhor stretches north-west over the rough Sahy\u00e1di lands in south-west Poona and in east Kol\u00e1ba, as far as within six miles of the line of the Bhor pass in Poona and seven miles of Pen in Kol\u00e1ba. Phaltan, on the north, adds a block of land to the north of the Mah\u00e1dev hills, which drains north to the Nira. Aundh is partly scattered within the limits of the M\u00e1n, Koregaon, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Kar\u00e1d, and T\u00e1sgaon sub-divisions, and partly forms a considerable block of the Atp\u00e1di sub-division to the north-east of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur which drains north-east into the M\u00e1n. Dafl\u00e1pur adds some lands in the south-east of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and Jath adds beyond Dafl\u00e1pur a long tract of country that stretches east and then north to the M\u00e1n and Bhima about twenty miles south-east of Pandharpur.\n\nThe chief details of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra states are:\n\n| STATES | TITLE       | AREA | PROFE, 1881 | REVENUE, 1882 |\n|--------|-------------|------|-------------|---------------|\n| Bhor   | Pant Sachiv | 1491 | 145,376     | 48,989        |\n| Phaltan| Nimibikar   | 397  | 58,402      | 18,500        |\n| Aundh  | Pant Pratinidhi | 447 | 58,916      | 19,849        |\n| Jath   | Deshmukh    | 884  | 49,486      | 16,825        |\n| Dafl\u00e1pur| Deshmukh   | 98   | 6007        | 1315          |\n| Total  |             | 3314 | 319,697     | 99,658        |\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra covers about a hundred miles from north to south, and about eighty miles from east to west. Except a small area in the north and north-east that drains into the Bhima, the district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is the head of the valley of the Krishna river. Down the centre, with a general slope to the south and south-east, along a valley which slowly opens into a plain, the Krishna flows first to the south and then to the east, passing across the whole district from its north-west to its south-east corner. From the central plain of the Krishna eight valleys branch to the hills. Six of them on the right run west or north-west, flanked by spurs from the Sahy\u00e1dris, and two of them on the left run north, flanked by spurs from the northern Mah\u00e1dev range. In the west the district is rugged and well watered; in the east it is flatter but parched and barren. Between the two stretches the Krishna valley, which, with the mouths of some of the side valleys, forms one of the richest tracts in the Bombay Deccan. Except near Mah\u00e1baleshvar and the Koyna valley in the west, little of the district is thickly wooded. Even in the rains the Mah\u00e1dev hills which lie across the north of the district are scantily covered with green, and during the hot months most of the country is parched and bare. Still, even in the stoniest and barrenest parts, the eye is often relieved by the green of watered crops and by groves of lofty trees. The\nwestern hills are remarkably bold with sharp outlines. The tops of many are flat, raised on lofty black scarps which in the distance look like fortress walls. The hills are layers of soft or amygdaloid trap separated by flows of hard basalt and topped by iron-stone or laterite.\n\nThe Sahy\u00e1dri range in the extreme west, the Mah\u00e1dev range passing at right angles from the Sahy\u00e1dris east across the north of the district, and the spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dris chiefly stretching east and south-east and the south-running spurs of the Mah\u00e1dev hills divide S\u00e1t\u00e1ra into three belts, a western, a central, and an eastern. The western or Sahy\u00e1dri belt includes the western parts of W\u00e1i, J\u00e1vli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, and V\u00e1lva. It includes the narrow rugged and steep crest of the Sahy\u00e1dris and the neighbouring ten to fifteen miles in the extreme west of the Koyna and V\u00e1rna valleys. It includes the bulk of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forest land and is throughout hilly and thickly wooded with evergreen trees. The Koyna and V\u00e1rna rise in the Sahy\u00e1dris and run south-east till they join the Krishna. On both sides of these rivers the hills rise steep from the river banks, leaving little room for tillage. The line of hill top is seldom broken into distinct summits and is generally bare as the rock is too smooth and steep to give trees a foothold. On the hill slopes the vegetation is dense; and in the valleys where the washings of the hills have gathered, the tree growth is luxuriant forming high forests chiefly of *jambhul* Syzygium jambolanum, *anjan* Memecylon tinctorium, *pisa* Actino daphne, jack Artocarpus integrifolia, *vad* Ficus indica, mango Mangifera indica, and *hirda* Terminalia chebula. Except Mah\u00e1baleshvar, M\u00e1ndhardev, and a few others which end in large plateaus, the flat tops are not more than fifty to 300 acres in area. The hills are crossed by many footpaths and by two important cart roads with large traffic, the FitzGerald pass in J\u00e1vli leading from Mah\u00e1baleshvar to Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ba and the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass leading by Kar\u00e1d and P\u00e1tan to Chiplun in Ratn\u00e1giri. Scattered over the hills, always close to a spring or stream, on the flat tops, on side terraces, and in the valley bottoms are small hamlets of rude ill-made huts whose timbers are rough forest posts, whose walls are of wattle and daub, and whose roofs are of thatch. Every spring is dammed and the sides of many of the hills are cleverly terraced for the growth of rice and garden crops. But the bulk of the soil is red iron-charged and poor, fit only for *n\u00e1chni vari* and other coarse hill grains which on some of the upper slopes are grown by coppice-cutting or *kumri*. Except a class of Musalm\u00e1n iron-smelters called Dhavada who are now labourers, most of the hill people are Mar\u00e1thi Kunbis. In the hot season the climate of the hills is cool and healthy; in the damp chilly rains the people suffer from fever and ague.\n\nThe central belt stretches from the eastern border of the Sahy\u00e1dri belt about thirty miles to the Vardhangad-Machindragad hills which run from the Mah\u00e1dev range south through the whole length of the district nearly parallel to the Sahy\u00e1dris. This central belt includes the eastern parts of W\u00e1i, J\u00e1vli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, and V\u00e1lva, and the whole of Kar\u00e1d and Koregaon. It is a tract of rich well-watered valleys nearly parallel to each other, stretching and widening to the\neast and south-east, and separated by sharp cut spurs which lie east and south-east from the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. The chief valleys are beginning from the north, the Koregaon, Krishna, Koyna, and V\u00e1rna valleys. The Koregaon valley in the north of the district is almost surrounded by hills, those on the west thinly wooded, and those on the east bare. The Krishna and the Koyna valleys are in the centre of the district. The Krishna valley, the finest valley in the district, between the Kamalgad spur in the north and the Vair\u00e1tgad spur in the south, passes from the great Mah\u00e1baleshwar plateau through W\u00e1i, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, and V\u00e1lva. South of the Krishna valley the Koyna valley lies between the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds on the west and the B\u00e1mnoli-Ger\u00e1dategad spur on the east. Like the Krishna valley it starts from the Mah\u00e1baleshwar hills, and, after stretching south about forty miles through J\u00e1vli and P\u00e1tan, turns east for forty miles further and opens into the broad Krishna valley at Kar\u00e1d. To the south of the Koyna valley with the Bhairavgad-Kandur hills on the north, and the Mahimatgad hills in Kolh\u00e1pur on the south, the V\u00e1rna valley, gradually opening, passes east till, about sixteen miles south of V\u00e1lva, it merges in the great Krishna plain. In the west the beginnings of these valleys are little more than ravines hemmed in by high steep hills. The soil is a bright barren iron clay, the small hamlets are perched on knolls or set on high stream banks, the people are poor, and most of the crops are grown with the help of r\u00e1b or wood ashes. Further east the flanking hills grow lower rounder and barer. Patches and belts of valuable teak gradually give way to tillage as the dales open into broad level valleys with b\u00e1hhul-fringed stream banks and lines of road shaded by lofty trees. These broad valleys are the richest part of the district.\n\nNear the centre of the valley, generally on the banks of the main stream, sometimes two or three miles apart, are large and often shady villages, peopled by careful and skilful husbandmen. Near the villages, along both banks of the central river, the deep and well watered black soil yields a succession of rich crops which keep green till February. In the rains all is green, and the fields pass to the foot of the hills and sometimes climb the lower slopes. After October when the rain crops are reaped the outer fringe of the valley lies barren and bare.\n\nThe eastern belt includes the four sub-divisions of M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v, K\u00e1hn\u00e1pur, and T\u00e1sgaon. Except in the extreme south near the Krishna the eastern belt is barren. Much of Khat\u00e1v and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur in the centre is a waving plateau about 250 feet above the Krishna valley. The plateau slopes east to the Yerla which crosses it on its way south to the Krishna. Beyond the Yerla it rises gently and again dips into the deeper valley of the V\u00edta. East of the V\u00edta the country rises about a hundred feet and passes into the hills which lead to M\u00e1ndesh, the country bordering on the M\u00e1n river including the M\u00e1n, \u00c1tp\u00e1di, and S\u00e1ngola sub-divisions. In the west of Khat\u00e1v are a few scattered teak, and many of the slopes have thick patches of scrub and coppice, chiefly karanj, lekti, and dh\u00e1vda. Though the soil is poor millet and other dry-crops are grown over a large area. M\u00e1n is a hollow nearly surrounded by low hills. The low lands are full\nof rock and the soil is poor. The hill slopes, which are seamed with streams, are generally covered with scrub forest chiefly as in Khat\u00e1v of *karanj* Pongamia glabra, and *dh\u00e1vda* Conocarpus latifolia. Most of the tillage in M\u00e1n is on the slopes and top of the plateau; the bulk of the low lands are waste. This M\u00e1n country has for long been and still is a pasture land for the cattle of the richer valleys further to the west. In the south of this eastern belt, beyond the central plateau of Khat\u00e1v and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, along the course of the Yerla, the lands of T\u00e1sgaon fall slowly to the Krishna. In the north and east T\u00e1sgaon is barren and rocky, cut by lines of low hills that strike out from the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur plateau. In the south and west, near the meeting of the Yerla and the Krishna, it turns into a rich well wooded plain.\n\nThe S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district contains two main systems of hills; the Sahy\u00e1dri range and its offshoots, and the Mah\u00e1dev range and its offshoots. The Sahy\u00e1dri system includes the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds which, through its entire length of sixty miles from north to south, forms the western boundary of the district. Within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, from about eight miles north of Prat\u00e1pgad passes south-west for about twenty miles. The crest then turns to the east of south, and, in an irregular line, continues to stretch south by east about forty miles till it enters Kolh\u00e1pur near Prachitgad about fifteen miles south-west of P\u00e1tan. In the sixty miles within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits the crest of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds is guarded by five forts. From the north these are Prat\u00e1pgad in the north-west of the district, Makarandgad following the line of the hill crest about seven miles south of Prat\u00e1pgad, Jangli-Jaygad about thirty miles south of Makrandgad, Bhairavgad about ten miles south of Jangli-Jaygad, and Prachitgad about seven miles south of Bhairavgad. Within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds is crossed by eight passes. Beginning from the north these are the FitzGerald or Ambinali pass in the north-west of the district, about ten miles west of Mah\u00e1bleshvar; the P\u00e1r pass about three miles south-west of the FitzGerald pass; the H\u00e1lot pass about six miles south of the P\u00e1r pass; the Amboli pass, about ten miles south of the H\u00e1lot pass; the North Tivra pass about ten miles south of the Amboli pass; the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass about fifteen miles south of the north Tivra pass; the Mala pass about eight miles south of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass; and the South Tivra pass about six miles south of the Mala pass. Of these eight passes the FitzGerald and the Kumbh\u00e1rli are fit for carts, the Amboli, North Tivra, South Tivra, and Mala are bullock tracks, and the rest are footpaths.\n\nFive spurs pass east and south-east from the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. Beginning from the north these spurs may be named the Kamalgad, Vair\u00e1tgad, Hatgegad-\u00c1rle, B\u00e1mnoli-Gher\u00e1dategad, and Bhairavgad-Kandur; the two last are large ranges each with three minor spurs. Kamalgad is a short spur which starts about five miles north of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and passes about ten miles east ending in the hill-fort of Kamalgad. It forms the water parting between the Valki on the left or north and the Krishna on the right or south. The\nsecond is the Vair\u00e1tgad spur up a branch of which the W\u00e1i-Mah\u00e1bleshvar main road climbs. It leaves the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds close to the village of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and stretches south-east about twenty miles ending a little beyond the hill-fort of Vair\u00e1tgad. This spur forms the water-parting between the Krishna on the left or north-east and the Kud\u00e1l\u00ed a feeder of the Krishna on the right or southwest. It has one fort Vair\u00e1tgad about six miles south-east of W\u00e1i. The third or Hatgegad-\u00c1rle spur starts like the Vair\u00e1tgad spur from Mah\u00e1baleshvar village, and stretches south-east nearly parallel to the Vair\u00e1tgad range to the north of Medha about thirty miles to \u00c1rle near the meeting of the Krishna and Vena. It is the water-parting between the Kud\u00e1l\u00ed feeder of the Krishna on the left or north-east, and the Yenna or Vena on the right or south-west. This spur has no hill fort. The fourth the B\u00e1mnoli-Gher\u00e1dategad is the chief of the Sahy\u00e1dri spurs. It starts from Malcolmpeeth on the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau and for a distance of about forty miles runs south nearly parallel to the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. It forms the water-parting between the Vena a feeder of the Krishna on the left or north-east and the Koyna another feeder of the Krishna on the right or west. This long range is as high and massive as the main crest of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. Besides by several small passes it is crossed by a good bullock track from Medha and B\u00e1mnoli. In the extreme south is the fortified peak of Gher\u00e1dategad. From the eastern slopes of the B\u00e1mnoli-Gher\u00e1dategad range three chief spurs stretch east and south-east across the plain. The first of these, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra spur, starts at Kelghar about three miles north-east of B\u00e1mnoli and about fifteen miles south-east of Malcolmpeeth, and stretches about fourteen miles to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and, from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, about twelve miles southeast to V\u00e1rna and Phaty\u00e1pur near the meeting of the Urmodi and the Krishna. It forms the water-parting between the Vena on the left or north-east and the Urmodi on the right or south-west, both feeders of the Krishna. Its only fortified hill is S\u00e1t\u00e1ra about the middle of the range. The second spur, which may be called the Kelv\u00e1l\u00ed-Son\u00e1pur spur, is short scattered and of irregular shape. It leaves the main range near Kelv\u00e1l\u00ed about eight miles south of B\u00e1mnoli, and, with many short side shoots, stretches about twelve miles south-east to N\u00e1gth\u00e1na. It forms the water-parting between the Urmodi river on the left or north-east and the T\u00e1rl\u00ed also a feeder of the Krishna on the south-west. Its only fort is Sajjangad or Parli on an outlying branch to the north of the main spur. The third or J\u00e1l\u00fa-Vasantgad spur starts from the B\u00e1mnoli-Gher\u00e1dategad range about nine miles south of Kelv\u00e1l\u00ed and with several offshoots passes about twelve miles south to near P\u00e1tan; about two miles north-east of P\u00e1tan it turns south-east, and stretches about fourteen miles to Vasantgad about four miles north-west of the meeting of the Koyna and the Krishna at Kar\u00e1d. During its twelve miles south the J\u00e1l\u00fa-Vasantgad spur forms the water-parting between the T\u00e1rl\u00ed stream on the left or east and the Kera a feeder of the Koyna on the right or west. In its fourteen miles to the south-east the spur forms the water-parting between the Krishna and its feeder the M\u00e1nd on the left or north-east, and the Koyna on the\nright or south-west. The only fort on the spur is Vasantgad near its extreme south-east end. In the extreme south of the district, starting from the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds near Bhairavgad about fourteen miles south-west of P\u00e1tan, a great belt of hills stretches south-east parallel to and a little north of the V\u00e1rna about thirty-six miles to near Kandur and Vadibh\u00e1g\u00e1i five miles south-west of Shir\u00e1l\u00e1, forming with the V\u00e1rna the boundary between S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kolh\u00e1pur. From this range several spurs run north-east and east, and fill the south-west corner of the district with hills. Of these spurs there are three chief lines, Gunvantgad about five miles south-west of P\u00e1tan, the water-parting between the Koyna on the left or north and the Morna on the right or south; the K\u00e1hir-Kirpa spur running east and separating the Morna on the left or north from the Kole or V\u00e1ng river on the right or south; and the K\u00e1lgaon-Jakinv\u00e1di spur running north-east to near Kapil about three miles south of Kar\u00e1d and separating the Kole river on the left or north-west from the N\u00e1ndgaon stream on the right or south-east.\n\nThe second system of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra hills is the Mah\u00e1dev system. In the north of the district the Mah\u00e1dev range starts about ten miles north of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and stretches east and south-east across the whole breadth of the district. The course of the range for the first thirty miles, to a little beyond the Kh\u00e1matki pass on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Poona road, is east. About Vela, four miles east of the Kh\u00e1matki pass, it turns south-east. Near Tadvala, twelve miles south-east of Kh\u00e1matki, through two breaks in the range, the W\u00e1i-Phaltan and the old S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Poona roads pass. Beyond Tadvala the hills again stretch in an irregular line east to the extreme east of the district at Kothla about twelve miles north-east of Dahivadi. Though its south-running spurs have many forts, the main crest of the Mah\u00e1dev range has only three forts, Gher\u00e1kelanja in the north-west about fourteen miles north-east of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, T\u00e1thvada about twenty miles north-west of Dahivadi, and V\u00e1rugad in the north-east about eleven miles north of Dahivadi. Besides many small openings the Mah\u00e1dev range is crossed by three important passes, the Kh\u00e1matki pass on the Poona-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road about twenty-eight miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the two breaks near Tadvala, about twelve miles south-east of Kh\u00e1matki, through which the Wai-\u00c1darki and the old S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Poona roads run.\n\nFrom the main range of the Mah\u00e1dev hills three spurs stretch south, the Chandan-Vandan spur in the west which runs about half across the district, and the Vardhangad-Machindragad and the Mahimangad-Panh\u00e1la spurs further east which stretch right across the district. The Chandan-Vandan spur is the water parting between the Krishna valley on the west and the V\u00e1sna valley on the east. The spur starts from the Mah\u00e1dev hill at H\u00e1rli about a mile and a half east of the Kh\u00e1matki pass and about twelve miles north-east of W\u00e1i. It stretches south about twelve miles to the twin forts of Chandan and Vandan, and, from them, about ten miles further to near the meeting of the V\u00e1sna and Krishna about three miles south-east of Sangam-M\u00e1huli. The Vardhangad-Machindragad spur begins\nfrom Mol in Khat\u00e1v about sixteen miles east of the starting point of the Chandan-Vandan spur and passes south through the whole length of the district about fifty miles to the Krishna near the town of Kundal. It forms the water-parting between the V\u00e1sna, Vangna, and other direct feeders of the Krishna on the west and the streams that drain into the Yerla a large tributary of the Krishna on the east. The spur has three fortified hills Vardhangad in the north about eight miles east of Koregaon, Sad\u00e1shivgad near Kar\u00e1d about thirty miles south of Vardhangad, and Machindragad about twelve miles south of Sad\u00e1shivgad. The third or Mahimangad-Panh\u00e1la spur begins from the Mah\u00e1dev hills about nine miles east of the starting point of the Vardhangad-Machindragad range and stretches south-east to Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. At Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur it splits in two, one branch passing twenty miles south till it ends in the old Panh\u00e1la fort in the extreme south of the district, and the other stretching south-east and leaving the district at Dhalgaon and beyond that continuing about sixteen miles south-east to Bilur about five miles south-west of Jath. It forms the water-parting between the valley of the Yerla, a tributary of the Krishna on the right or south-west, and the valley of the M\u00e1n a tributary of the Bhima on the left or north-east. It has two fortified hills Mahimangad about ten miles south of where the spur starts from the Mah\u00e1dev hills, and Bhop\u00e1lgaad about ten miles south-east of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur.\n\nThe tops both of the Sahy\u00e1dris and of the Mah\u00e1dev hills, especially in the north-western sub-divisions of W\u00e1i, J\u00e1vli, and P\u00e1tan, look like a succession of fortresses raised on a series of plateaus piled one over the other, the whole surmounted by a wall of rock. The top of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, the highest point in the district, is about 4710 feet above the sea. From the high Decan table-land on the east the Sahy\u00e1dris seem somewhat low and tame. But from the western edge of their crest great forms stand out from the Konkan with bold wild outlines and cliffs which in places have a sheer drop of over 3000 feet. For about thirty miles after leaving the Sahy\u00e1dris the Mah\u00e1dev hills keep a height of about 4000 feet above the sea and about 2000 feet above the plain. The north face of the Mah\u00e1dev range falls sharply into the Nira valley, the distance from the crest of the range to the river being not more than ten or twelve miles. To the south the hills fall much more gently to the valley of the Krishna.\n\nWithin S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits there are fifty-six notable hills and hill-forts, fourteen in W\u00e1i, four in J\u00e1vli, seven in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, five in Koregaon, five in P\u00e1tan, four in Kar\u00e1d, three in V\u00e1lva, seven in M\u00e1n, four in Khat\u00e1v, two in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and one in T\u00e1sgaon.\n\nW\u00e1i.\n\nThe names of the fourteen W\u00e1i hills are, B\u00e1leghar, Dh\u00e1mna, Harli, Kamalgad, Kenjalgad, M\u00e1ndhardev, P\u00e1nchgani, P\u00e1ndavgad, Pipli, Sonj\u00e1i, V\u00e1gdera, Vandan, Vair\u00e1tgad, and Yeruli. Of these hills Sonj\u00e1i the lowest is 3287 feet and Yeruli the highest is 4531 feet above the sea. One of them P\u00e1nchgani is a health resort, and five of them Kamalgad, P\u00e1ndavgad, Vair\u00e1tgad, Vandan, and Kenjalgad are hill forts. Kamalgad, 4511 feet above the sea, stands alone ten miles west of W\u00e1i, and has an ascent of about three miles. The\nsides are covered with shrubs and trees, and the top is flat, and is about fifty acres in area. It has one approach by a rough flight of steps, and inside are a deep well, a reservoir, and a cave. P\u00e1ndavgad, about 4177 feet above the sea and three miles north of W\u00e1i, has an ascent of about a mile and a half, and is thinly covered with scrub. Its flat top has an area of only thirty acres, surrounded by an almost ruined wall with two gates. Inside, at a small ruined temple of P\u00e1nduj\u00e1\u00ed, a yearly fair or y\u00e1tra is held. On the side are two or three water cisterns and a cave, and at the bottom of the hill are two more caves called P\u00e1ndavkratya or the P\u00e1ndavs' work.\n\nVair\u00e1tgad, 3939 feet above the sea and six miles south of W\u00e1i, has an ascent of about a mile. The top, which has an area of about thirty acres, has two reservoirs, but neither temples nor caves. It is surrounded by a wall with two gates, one of which is approached by steps. Besides the main entrance there is a secret path or chorv\u00e1t. Vandan, about 3841 feet above the sea and ten miles south-east of W\u00e1i, is a flat-topped hill with an area of about seventy acres, and an ascent of a mile and a half. The top, which has five small mosques and two reservoirs, is strengthened at the crests of ravines with two gates. Kenjalgad, 4268 feet above the sea and twelve miles west of W\u00e1i, is a flat-topped hill with an area of about fifty acres and an ascent of about two miles. The top, which has four reservoirs and one or two ruined temples, is surrounded by an almost ruined wall with a gate approached by a flight of about a hundred steps. The village of Ghera Kenjala on the top has about 100 people.\n\nThe four hills in J\u00e1vli are Mah\u00e1baleshvar, Makrandgad, Prat\u00e1pgad, and V\u00e1sota. Of these, Mah\u00e1baleshvar, 4710 feet above the sea, is a health resort and the other three are hill forts. Makrandgad, about 4054 feet above the sea and eight miles south-west of Malcolmpeth the Mah\u00e1baleshvar market, is commonly known as the Saddleback. The top is small and uneven. A few Jangam shrine-servants and husbandmen live on the top, which has a reservoir, a spring, and a temple of Mallik\u00e1rjun. Prat\u00e1pgad hill, as the crow flies is four or five miles west of Malcolmpeth. It is 3543 feet above the sea and stands alone with steep grass and scrub-covered sides, and is a place of great natural strength. It can be climbed either from V\u00e1da or Peth P\u00e1r, but has only one gate. The top plateau which is about half a mile long, is flat and is surrounded by an inner and an outer line of walls each with one gate. The fort, which is said to have been built by Shiv\u00e1ji, is still in fair repair. The citadel has an area of 300 by 400 yards. About seventy people, chiefly p\u00faj\u00e1ris or shrine servants, live on the hill top which has some reservoirs and two large temples, one dedicated to Bhav\u00e1ni and the other to K\u00e9d\u00e1reshvar. The tomb of the Bij\u00e1pur general Afzul Kh\u00e1n who was slain by Shiv\u00e1ji in 1659, is still shown on the hill. V\u00e1sota is a flat-topped hill on the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, about sixteen miles south of Malcolmpeth. It is climbed by a steep footpath about a mile and a half long with steps at the top. The top, which is surrounded by a wall, contains the remains of a mansion, a small temple, and two reservoirs.\nThe seven hills in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division are S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort or Ajimat\u00e1ra, Yavteshvar, Parli fort or Sajjangad, Petova, Gh\u00e1t\u00e1i, P\u00e1teshvar, and Shulp\u00e1ni, varying from 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Parli are fortified. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra hill, about 3307 feet above the sea and 1200 feet above the plain, stands immediately over the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The hill is climbed by a path about one mile long. The fort includes a flat hill-top about 1200 yards by 400. It is surrounded by a wall with an entrance in the north-west, and a second blocked entrance in the south-east. The only buildings on the top are two bungalows and a few temples and small reservoirs. Two low necks join it to the spur. The sides are steep and bare with a little scrub, and, except at the main gate, the top is surrounded by an unbroken wall of rock. The Parli or Sajjan fort, about 3000 feet above the sea, stands alone about seven miles south-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It is steep and may be climbed by three footpaths, all of which lead to the same point of entrance. The flat top, which is about 600 yards by 250, is surrounded by a wall in fair order with an inner and an outer gate both bearing inscriptions. The fort is famous for the footprints of R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi, the teacher of Shiv\u00e1ji. The footprints are visited every Thursday by numbers of pilgrims, and a great fair or y\u00e1tra is held in honour of R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi on the ninth of the dark half of M\u00e1gh in January-February. Besides the footprints, the top contains several temples, two mosques with Persian inscriptions, five water reservoirs, and a considerable population.\n\nThe five Koregaon hills, Harneshvar, Chavneshvar, Jaranda, N\u00e1ndgiri, and Chandan, vary from 3500 to 4000 feet above the sea. Three are hill forts of little importance, N\u00e1ndgiri about twelve miles north-east, Chandan about fifteen miles north, and Jaranda about eight miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. All are surrounded by walls each with one entrance. N\u00e1ndgiri has a plateau about 500 yards long and 300 broad, and the top of Chandan is 1000 feet by 800. These have no special temples or buildings but have one or more reservoirs. The slopes are bare and steep and are climbed by difficult footpaths.\n\nOf the five P\u00e1tan hills, Chandli, D\u00e1tegad, Gunvantgad, Bhairavgad, and Jangli-Jaygad, all except the first are fortified. Chandli, about six miles south of P\u00e1tan, is of an irregular sugarloaf-shape and is half cut from the rest of the ridge by a depression or pass. Except for a few teak trees the hill sides are bare. D\u00e1tegad is a flat-topped eminence at the southern end of a range of hills in the west of P\u00e1tan. The sides are bare and rocky. The ascent, which is some three miles from P\u00e1tan, though steep, is fairly easy. Gunvantgad or Morgiri, a striking hill from many points on the Sahy\u00e1dris, looks like a lion crouching with its head to the south-east. The ascent is easy, not more than half a mile from the village of Morgiri. The top has an area of about 200 yards by fifty. The forts of Bhairavgad and Jangli-Jaygad are both on spurs which jut into the Konkan from the edge of the Sahy\u00e1dris. Both are difficult of access, the path passing through masses of trackless forest.\n\nThe four Kar\u00e1d hills are, Ag\u00e1shiv, P\u00e1l, Sad\u00e1shivgad, and Vasantgad, of which the Sad\u00e1shivgad and Vasantgad are fortified.\nAg\u00e1shiv, standing about 1200 feet above the plain, has a pointed top, and is a prominent object about four miles south-west of Kar\u00e1d. The sides are steep and scantily covered with scrub. On the south-east of the hill is a group of Buddhist caves. P\u00e1l stands alone about two miles south-east of the village of that name. It is round-topped and rises about 1000 feet from the plain. On the top is a small temple. The sides are not steep and in many parts are under tillage. Sad\u00e1shivgad, a hill fort built by Shiv\u00e1ji, stands about three miles east of Kar\u00e1d. It is a round-topped hill at the western end of a spur which juts from the eastern wall of the valley. The sides are bare and rocky, easily climbed by a path about a mile long. The top which is about 400 yards by 200 is surrounded by a ruined wall. Vasantgad, about four miles north-west of Kar\u00e1d, a prominent object from both the Kar\u00e1d-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the Kar\u00e1d-Kubh\u00e1rli roads, is a place of great strength. A footpath leads from Talbid to the east of the fort, and the old gun road was from Khodshi about two miles to the south-east. On the top are two gateways and some temples and other buildings.\n\nOf the three V\u00e1lva hills, Mallik\u00e1rjun, Prachitgad, and Machindragad, the two last are fortified. Mallik\u00e1rjun, about eight miles south-east of Peth, has a fine Br\u00e1hmanical cave temple. Prachitgad is on a spur which stands out into the Konkan in the extreme west of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. Machindragad, a solitary round-topped hill in the north-east of the sub-division, is the southmost of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s forts.\n\nOf the seven M\u00e1n hills, V\u00e1rugad, Khokada, Shikhar-Shingn\u00e1pur, T\u00e1thvada, Jire-Padh\u00e1r, Kulakj\u00e1i, and Mahimangad, three, V\u00e1rugad T\u00e1thvada and Mahimangad are fortified. V\u00e1rugad, about ten miles north-west of Dahivadi, rises cone-shaped from the main spur. From the north the ascent is difficult and about a mile long; from the south the plateau leads to the base of the cone and the ascent is not more than 250 feet. Its grassy top which is about a mile long by a mile broad, is fortified on the crests of the ravines by a ruined wall with five gateways. On the top stands the village of V\u00e1rugad with an old temple of Bahiroba and with five hamlets of Kunbis, R\u00e1moshis, and Mh\u00e1rs. Khokada, fifteen miles north-west of Dahivadi, is flat-topped, rugged, and bare, and has one spring. On the top is the village of Khokada mostly of Kunbi husbandmen who raise crops of millet, Indian millet, wheat, and gram. Wolves and panthers occasionally visit the hill. Shikhar-Shingn\u00e1pur, thirteen miles north-east of Dahivadi and 3049 feet above the sea is flat-topped, rugged, and partly covered with grass and trees. On the top are the village of Shingn\u00e1pur, a temple of Mah\u00e1dev, and a hamlet of husbandmen and shepherds. T\u00e1thvada, about twenty miles north-west of Dahivadi, is rugged and partly covered with shrubs and grass. The top, which is about a quarter of a mile long and broad, is fortified along the crests of ravines by a partly ruined wall with one gateway. On the top are a paved apartment, a reservoir, and a well, but no temples or caves. Wolves and panthers occasionally visit the hill. Jire-Padh\u00e1r, ten miles south-east of Dahivadi and 3138 feet above the sea, is flat-topped.\nrugged, and covered with shrubs and grass. On the hill top are two hamlets of Kunbis and shepherds. Kulakj\u00e1i, eleven miles north-west of Dahivadi, is flat-topped, rugged, and covered with shrubs and grass. It has two springs, and the village of Kulakj\u00e1i and two hamlets of husbandmen and shepherds. The Tita, Bel, and Vakj\u00e1i passes go close by the hill. Mahimanged hill, 3219 feet above the sea and five miles west of Dahivadi, is bare and flat-topped with rocky sides. It has an easy ascent and is joined to a spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range. The top is grassy and about 900 feet long from east to west and 600 feet broad from north to south. It is partly fortified by a ruined wall with one gateway. It contains two dry reservoirs and an old temple of M\u00e1runi.\n\nOf the four Khat\u00e1v hills, Solakn\u00e1th, Bh\u00e1ps\u00e1h\u00e1, Vardhangad, and Bhushangad, two Vardhangad and Bhushangad are fortified. Solakn\u00e1th, eighteen miles north of Vaduj, the source of the Yerla river, rises 2000 to 2500 feet above the plain. The top is pointed, and the sides are steep and bare, without trees or tillage. Bh\u00e1ps\u00e1h\u00e1, four miles south-west of Vaduj, is a pointed hill with steep bare sides. Vardhangad, 3502 feet above the sea and fourteen miles west of Vaduj, is round-topped and easy of ascent, and is joined to a spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range. The top, which is about 300 yards long by 200 broad, is surrounded by a stone wall with one entrance. The wall is entire towards the east and south and is ruined towards the north and west. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road passes by the south of the hill which has a grassy top with four wells, four reservoirs, and an old temple. The hill-sides are too bare to give cover to wild animals. Bhushangad stands alone, eight miles south of Vaduj, steep, bare, and flat-topped. The top, which is about 200 yards long by 200 yards broad, is surrounded by a ruined stone wall with one entrance. The hill, which has a dry spring and no tillage either on the top or the sides, has two old temples on the top, one to a goddess and the other to M\u00e1runi. The hill is not infested by wild animals.\n\nThe two Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur hills are Rev\u00e1giri and an unnamed hill. Rev\u00e1giri four miles east of Vita rises 1500 to 2000 feet above the plain. The Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road passes by the hill which is sloping and bare or partly covered with shrubs. Crops are grown on the flat hill-top. It was formerly infested by tigers and wolves. The unnamed hill about fifteen miles west of Vita, is pointed and 1000 to 1500 feet above the plain. The hill is rugged, partly covered with shrubs, and without tillage. The Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road passes over it. About ten miles east of T\u00e1sgaon is Dandoba, a pointed hill of easy ascent and bare of trees.\n\nWithin S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits there are two river systems, the Bhima system in a small part of the north and north-east and the Krishna system throughout the rest of the district. Of the Bhima system there are two branches the Nira and the M\u00e1n. A narrow belt beyond the Mah\u00e1dev hills drains north into the Nira which flows east into the Bhima and the north-east corner of the district beyond the Mahimanged-Panh\u00e1la spur drains south-east along the M\u00e1n which afterwards flows east and north-east to join the Bhima. The total area of the Bhima system, including part of W\u00e1i and the whole of\nPhaltan and M\u00e1n, is probably about 1100 miles. Excluding about 400 miles of the Phaltan state, this leaves for the Krishna system 4000 miles or about five-sixths of the district. The drainage system of the Krishna includes, besides the drainage of the central stream the drainage of six feeders from the right side the Kud\u00e1li, Yenna, Urmodi, T\u00e1rli, Koyna, and V\u00e1rna, and of two from the left side the V\u00e1sna and the Yerla.\n\nThe Krishna is one of the three great rivers of Southern India. Like the God\u00e1vari and K\u00e1veri it flows across almost the entire breadth of the peninsula from west to east and falls into the Bay of Bengal. In sanctity the Krishna is surpassed both by the God\u00e1vari and by the K\u00e1veri. In length it is less than the God\u00e1vari, but its drainage area, including the drainage of its two great tributaries the Bhima and Tungbhadra, is larger than that of either the God\u00e1vari or of the K\u00e1veri. Its length is about 800 miles and its drainage area is about 94,500 square miles. Of its 800 miles about 150 lie within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits. The Krishna rises on the eastern brow of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau four miles west of the village of Jor in the extreme west of W\u00e1i. The source of the river is about 4500 feet above the sea in 18\u00b0 1' north latitude and 73\u00b0 41' east longitude. On the plateau of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hill near the source of the river stands an ancient temple of Mah\u00e1dev. Inside of the temple is a small reservoir into which a stream pours out of a stone cow-mouth. This is the traditional source of the river which Hindus lovingly call Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed the Lady Krishna. Numbers of pilgrims crowd to the spot which is embowered in trees and flowering shrubs. From its source the Krishna runs east for about fifteen miles till it reaches the town of W\u00e1i. From W\u00e1i the course of the river is south. About ten miles from W\u00e1i it receives the Kud\u00e1li from the right about two miles south of P\u00e1nchvad in South W\u00e1i. After meeting the Kud\u00e1li, the river continues to run south through the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division by Nimbandh and Varunth, and after fifteen miles receives the Yenna on the right near M\u00e1huli about three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. As the meeting of the Krishna and Yenna, M\u00e1huli is sacred. A fair is held five times in the year, once in K\u00fartik October-November, in Chaitra March-April, and in Ash\u00e1d June-July, and twice in Shr\u00e1van July-August. After meeting the Yenna the Krishna curves to the south-east and separates S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from Koregaon for about ten miles till it reaches the border of Kar\u00e1d. In Koregaon, after a course of forty miles, about a mile east of Mangalpur, the Krishna receives the V\u00e1sna from the left, and after a course of about fifty-five miles in the extreme south of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division, about two miles south-west of Vanegaon, it receives the Urmodi from the right. In Kar\u00e1d the river runs nearly south. It receives from the right two tributaries, the T\u00e1rli near Umbr\u00e1j after a course of about sixty-five miles and the Koyna near Kar\u00e1d after a course of about seventy-five miles. From Kar\u00e1d the Krishna runs south-east by V\u00e1lva and Bhilavdi in T\u00e1sgaon. About six miles south of Bhilavdi it receives the Yerla on the left after a course of 120 miles, and about three miles south of S\u00e1ngli in the extreme south of the district it receives the V\u00e1rna on the right after a course of 135 miles. After its meeting with the V\u00e1rna the Krishna continues to run south-east towards\nBelgaum. Within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits the Krishna is unfit for navigation. The channel is too rocky and the stream too rapid to allow even of small native craft. The banks are twenty to thirty feet high and generally sloping earthy and broken. The river bed, though in parts rocky, as a rule is sandy. In W\u00e1i and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the north-west, except that melons are grown in its bed, the water of the Krishna is little used for irrigation, except here and there by bhudkis or pits sunk on deep river banks. In Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, and T\u00e1sgaon in the south, crops of sugarcane, groundnut, chillies, and wheat are raised by watering the soil from recently made canals. During the fair season the Krishna is everywhere easily forded, but during the rains there is a considerable body of water, and ferries are worked at M\u00e1huli three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, at Dh\u00e1maner in the south of Korgaon, at Umbr\u00e1j, Kar\u00e1d, and K\u00e1rve in Kar\u00e1d, at B\u00e1he and Boregaon in V\u00e1lva, and at Bhilavdi in T\u00e1sgaon. Within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits the Krishna is bridged at Bhuinj on the Poona-Belgaum road, at W\u00e1i on the Poona-FitzGerald road, and at Vaduth on the old Poona road.\n\nKudd\u00e1li. The Kudd\u00e1li, a small feeder of the Krishna in the north, rises near Kedamb in J\u00e1vli, and after a south-easterly course of about sixteen miles through J\u00e1vli and W\u00e1i, flanked by the Vair\u00e1tgad range on the left or north and the Hatgegad-\u00c1rle range on the right or south, joins the Krishna from the right about two miles south of P\u00e1nchvad in W\u00e1i.\n\nYenna. The Vena or Yenna, one of the Krishna\u2019s chief feeders, rises on the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau and falls into the Yenna valley below the Lingmalla bungalow and plantation, on the east point of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hills about three miles east of Malcolmpeeth. It passes along the valley between the Hatgegad-\u00c1rle range on the left or north and the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra range on the right or south, and, after a south-easterly course of about forty miles through J\u00e1vli and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, it flows into the Krishna at M\u00e1huli about three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In the hot season the stream stops and the water stands in pools. It is crossed by no ferries. Besides a foot bridge at Medha in J\u00e1vli, it has four road bridges, one on the Poona-Belgaum road at Varya three miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, two on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Malcolmpeeth road at Kanhera eight miles and at Kelghar twenty miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and one on the old Poona road at V\u00e1dha-Kheda three miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nUrmodi. The Urmodi, a small feeder of the Krishna, rises near Kas in J\u00e1vli. It passes south-east along a valley flanked by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra range on the left or north and the Kalv\u00e1li-Son\u00e1pur range on the right or south. After a south-easterly course of about twenty miles, mostly through S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, it falls into the Krishna about two miles south-west of Vanegaon in the extreme south of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division. The banks of the Urmodi are high and steep. The flow of water ceases in the hot season. There is no ferry, and only one bridge on the Poona-Kolhapur mail-road at L\u00e1tna nine miles south of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nT\u00e1rl\u00ed. The T\u00e1rl\u00ed, a small feeder of the Krishna, rises in the north-west of P\u00e1tan about ten miles above the village of T\u00e1rl\u00ed. It flows south-\neast along a valley flanked by the Kalv\u00e1li-Son\u00e1pur range on the left or north-east and the J\u00e1lu-Vasantgad range on the right or south-west. After a south-easterly course of about twenty-two miles through P\u00e1tan and Kar\u00e1d, it joins the Krishna from the right at Umbraj in Kar\u00e1d.\n\nThe Koyna, the largest of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra feeders of the Krishna, rises on the west side of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau near Elphinstone Point in 17\u00b0 58' north latitude and 73\u00b0 43' east longitude. Of its course of eighty miles within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits, during the first forty it runs nearly south, and during the next forty it runs nearly east. During its forty miles to the south the Koyna flows along a beautiful valley with the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dris on the right and on the left the B\u00e1mnoli-Gher\u00e1dategad branch of the Sahy\u00e1dris which runs parallel to the main line at an equal height. In Javli the river passes by B\u00e1mnoli and T\u00e1mbi and receives the Solshi from the left about three miles north of B\u00e1mnoli and the K\u00e1nd\u00e1ti from the right about two miles south of B\u00e1mnoli. At Helv\u00e1k in P\u00e1tan, after a course of forty miles, the river suddenly turns east, and, after a further course of forty miles, by the town of P\u00e1tan where it receives the Kera from the north, it falls into the Krishna at Kar\u00e1d. In the first forty miles the Koyna is seldom more than 100 feet broad; but in the last forty miles the bed is 300 to 500 feet across. Especially in the first forty miles the banks are broken and muddy and the bed is of gravel. In the hot months the stream often ceases, but the water stands in deep pools through the dryest years. During the rains it fills from bank to bank, and small ferry boats work across it at S\u00e1ngvad and Yer\u00e1d in P\u00e1tan.\n\nThe V\u00e1rna in the south, separating S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kolh\u00e1pur, rises close to the western crest of the Sahy\u00e1dris in the extreme north-west of V\u00e1lva. It runs south-east for about eighty miles by Charan, Bil\u00e1si, and Dhudhgaon in V\u00e1lva, and falls into the Krishna about three miles south of S\u00e1ngli. Its banks are steep and broken, and, in the southern twenty miles, it overflows its banks every rains.\n\nThe V\u00e1sna, a small feeder of the Krishna, rises in the Mah\u00e1dev range near Solshi in the north of Koregaon. It flows south along a valley flanked by the Chandan-Vandan range on the right or west and by the Vardhangad-Machindragad range on the left or east. It runs south for about twenty miles, and, from the left, falls into the Krishna about a mile east of Mangalpur in Koregaon.\n\nThe Yerla, the largest of the left-hand or northern feeders of the Krishna, rises in Solakn\u00e1th hill in the extreme north of Khat\u00e1v. It flows along a valley flanked by the Vardhangad-Machindragad range on the right or west, and by the Mahimangad-Panh\u00e1la range on the left or east. It runs south for about seventy-five miles through Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, T\u00e1sgaon, and the lands of S\u00e1ngli. In Khat\u00e1v it passes by L\u00e1lgun, Khat\u00e1v, Vaduj, and Nimso, in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur by Danleshvar and Bh\u00e1lv\u00e1ni, in T\u00e1sgaon by Turchi and N\u00e1gaon, and in S\u00e1ngli by N\u00e1ndre. At Dhanleshvar in Kh\u00e1npur it receives the N\u00e1nd\u00e1ni from the right a stream about 300 feet wide. After a south-westerly course of about seventy-five miles the Yerla falls into the Krishna within S\u00e1ngli limits about six miles south of Bhilavdi.\nAt its meeting with the Krishna, the Yerla is about 600 feet broad. Its bed is sandy, and its banks are sloping earthy and muddy. The stream holds water throughout the year and crops of sugarcane, groundnut, wheat, potatoes, and onions are raised by bhudkis or wells sunk near the banks.\n\nOf the Bhima system of rivers the two chief S\u00e1t\u00e1ra representatives are the Nira in the north and the M\u00e1n in the north-east. The Nira, which separates S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from Poona in the north, rises on the Sahy\u00e1dri range within the lands of the Pant Sachiv of Bhor. Of a total length of 130 miles, about sixty miles lie on the borders of Poona to the north and of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Phaltan to the south. From its source in Bhor the river runs east to the north of the subdivision of W\u00e1i and the state of Phaltan. After leaving Phaltan, it runs north of M\u00e1lsiras in Shol\u00e1pur and falls into the Bhima about five miles east of T\u00e1mbve in the extreme north-east of M\u00e1lsiras. Within the limits of the Bhor state the Nira is bridged on the Poona-Kolh\u00e1pur mail road at Sirval in the north of W\u00e1i.\n\nThe M\u00e1nganga, a tributary of the Bhima, rises in the Tita hill in the north-east of M\u00e1n. Of a total length of about 100 miles, about forty lie in M\u00e1n within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits. In M\u00e1n the river runs south-east by Malvadi, Andhli, Dahivadi, and Mhasvad. Beyond S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits the M\u00e1nganga continues to run south-east through \u00c1tp\u00e1di, and from \u00c1tp\u00e1di it turns north-east through S\u00e1ngola and Pandharpur in Shol\u00e1pur, and falls into the Bhima at Sarkoli about ten miles south-east of Pandharpur. During the rains within the M\u00e1n sub-division the water of the M\u00e1nganga runs two to six feet deep. In the fair season it is about two feet deep in some places and almost dry in others. The bed is sandy and the banks earthy and sloping. In some parts near the river banks crops of sugarcane, groundnut, wheat, sweet potatoes, and onions are raised by p\u00e1ts or fair-weather channels.\n\nIn the west water is fairly abundant. In the east, hot weather after hot weather, want of water causes much suffering. The supply comes partly from rivers and streams, partly from reservoirs, and partly from wells which are numerous but in many cases run dry during the hot season. In 1882 for the storage of water there were 189 ponds and reservoirs, of which three were lakes of considerable size. There were 23,810 wells, 17,411 of them with and 6399 without steps. Besides three water supply works for the towns of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, and Isl\u00e1mpur, six water works are completed, the Rev\u00e1ri canal on the V\u00e1sna, the Yerla canals on the Yerla, the Gondoli canal on the M\u00e1n, the M\u00e1yni reservoir on the V\u00e1ng, the Chikhli canal on the N\u00e1ndni, and the Krishna canal on the Krishna. A seventh work, a large reservoir at Mhasvad in the M\u00e1n sub-division is being built.\u00b9\n\nThe whole of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra falls within the Deccan trap area. As in other parts of the West Deccan the hills are layers of soft or amygdaloid trap separated by flows of hard basalt and capped by laterite or iron clay.\n\n\u00b9 Details of these water works are given in Agriculture under Irrigation.\nThe usual Indian division of the seasons into cold, hot, and rainy is not suited to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The year may be better divided into five seasons, the rainy from about the tenth of June to the end of September, a close sultry time from the end of September to the middle of November, a cold time from the middle of November to the end of January, a dry hot time in which easterly winds prevail from the beginning of February to the end of March, and the hot weather from the beginning of April to about the tenth of June. The climate of the three and a half months of the south-west rains, from the middle of June to the end of September, as a rule is agreeable. The air is genial and soft with a fresh westerly breeze. The rainfall varies greatly in different parts of the district, the chief cause of difference being distance from the Sahy\u00e1dris. Rain falls in November and December in the early months of the north-east monsoon, and rain, which is known as mangoe showers, falls in May, and is important to the husbandman enabling him to sow his earliest crops. From the close of the south-west rains at the end of September to the middle of November the atmosphere is close and sultry. Comparing this period with the periods which go before and follow it, though the temperature is not much higher, the air is more oppressive and the season more sickly. The cold weather begins about the middle of November, and the sudden change from the moist warm month of October to the cold dry air of November often causes disease. About the middle of November the mornings and evenings become cool and pleasant and continue cool till the beginning of February. During these cool months occasional showers greatly help the vegetables which grow in abundance. The hilly parts are refreshed by heavy dews and river fogs spread for several miles beyond their banks. Though the most invigorating time of the year, the cold season is often the most unhealthy. The thermometer begins to rise early in February and as a rule with the increase of warmth sickness grows less. During the hot months of April and May, the temperature is at the highest and the atmosphere is close and dry. In the early part of the day the air is still, not a breath blows, not a leaf is in motion. Towards the afternoon a faint air sets in from the west which in an hour or two freshens to a breeze. The west wind blows all night, and in the early morning gives place to an east wind which continues till nine or ten. The hot weather, though exhausting, is not so trying as in most parts of the Presidency. In a cool house with the windows darkened and the doors shut at seven in the morning and opened at five in the evening, the mean heat at two in the afternoon was $85^\\circ$ and the mean daily variation $4^\\circ$. The temperature did not reach its maximum at two, but continued to rise till five when it was $86.5^\\circ$. On the doors being opened at five the thermometer rose one degree. When kept all day in an open veranda, with a westerly exposure, the thermometer rose to $92.4^\\circ$ at two and from that fell towards the evening.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. A. Young in Transactions of the Bombay Medical and Physical Society for 1838-39 page 211.\nDuring the south-west rains the prevailing winds are from the north-west and south-west. While the winds blow from the south-west on the Mah\u00e1baleshwar hills, at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, owing to the influence of the mountain ranges and the south-easterly lie of the valley, their direction is north-west. About the beginning of September, the wind veers to the east and keeps blowing from the east till the end of September. During the close sultry period in October and the first half of November the wind blows from the north-east, but it is generally light and unrefreshing. In the cold season from mid-November to early February westerly winds prevail. During the hot dry period from February to March the westerly winds and cold nights of the cold months cease and the evening westerly breezes of the hot season have not begun. Dry east winds prevail, and parch the skin and prevent perspiration almost as much as intense cold. These winds are dangerous to all, and should be avoided by all who are liable to liver disease. During the early hot season the easterly morning wind in the after-part of the day veers by the north to the west. In the later hot months, the wind blows steadily from the west, beginning generally about midday and blowing till a late hour. The nights and mornings are calm and cool.\n\nDuring the south-west rains, the sky is generally overcast with cumuli or cumulo-strati clouds. At the setting in of the south-west rain the clouds are dense and numerous, but as the rains advance they grow partial and fleecy. From about the 20th of July till the end of August, there is much sunshine, and as the cumuli are driven overhead by the westerly breeze, the more stationary cirro-strati may often be seen unmoved, high in the firmament. Towards the middle of September dark masses again gather and continue to hide the sun till the south-west rains end with the Elephanta storms in October.\u00b9 During the close sultry period from mid-September to mid-November fogs are few, but the sky is often partially hid by fleecy cumuli. In the cold weather, from mid-November to the end of January, the sky is generally clear with occasional cumuli, and not unfrequently horizontal and oblique cirri. The hot dry season from February to March has generally a clear and unclouded sky. In March April and early in May the sky is generally clear, about the middle of May it becomes overcast and cumulo-strati clouds gather on the horizon.\n\n\u00b2 During January and early February the air is cool and bracing, but the east winds are unpleasantly dry and tighten the skin. Towards the end of February the air grows perceptibly warmer, and, by the middle of March, the hot weather has begun. About this time it is usual to close doors and windows to keep out the hot wind which begins to blow strongly from the west. The heat increases gradually and is greatest about the middle of May. Then not uncommonly storms burst and sensibly lessen the intense heat of\n\n\u00b9 These storms are called Elephants because, according to Hindu astronomy, the sun is then in the Nakshatra or guest-house of the Elephant constellation,\n\u00b2 Trans. Bom. Med. and Phy. Soc. New Series, 1857-58, IV. 104-5.\nthe two preceding months. If no storms come, the weather continues sultry till the end of the first week of June. Even in the hottest weather, after sunset the air soon cools and the nights are seldom without an agreeable freshness from the sea breeze which does not lull till the early morning. At the hottest time of the year at six in the morning the mercury is seldom higher than $83^\\circ$. At six in the evening with the house closed the highest is about $86^\\circ$ and $88^\\circ$ with open doors. These cool nights prevent the heat from being so trying as in other parts of the Presidency, where the temperature is lower but damper and the nights are less fresh. During the rains the climate is peculiarly soft and agreeable. No great amount of rain falls in June, but the sky is thick with clouds and there are occasional showers. The first ten days bring a perceptible decrease of heat. The abatement of heat continues till the beginning of July when the regular monsoon sets in occasionally with violent storms of thunder and lightning. July is by far the wettest month in the year; August is often dry but light drizzling intervals till December are not unusual. A heavy burst, often six inches, of westerly rain nearly always happens in September. The people do not regard this as part of the regular south-west monsoon; it is known as the fall of the *Hasti Nakshatra* or the Elephant Guest-house. This is one of the most important falls both for the early and for the late crops. From the east or Madras monsoon, heavy rain falls towards the end of September and in early October. For about a month after the eastern rain ceases the air is generally hot and close. November ushers in the cold weather which lasts till the end of January. On the whole the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra seasons show considerable uniformity. They are not subject to abrupt changes or to extremes of heat or cold. Though its elevation, the comparative absence of water, and the bare surrounding country make the fair weather atmosphere rarefied dry and exciting, its nearness to the coast makes these qualities less remarkable than at other Deccan stations of less altitude, but further inland. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra climate is a marked change from the moist and relaxing Konkan. It is best suited to the nervous, the simply debilitated, and the relaxed, to the dyspeptic, and those affected with chronic bronchitis. It is liable to aggravate or render more acute, fever and head derangements by constricting the surface vessels and forcing inwards an increased flow of blood. The increased flow of blood congests and obstructs the organs which have been weakened by disease or climate. These adverse conditions are limited to the dry season, or at least are considerably modified during the soft mild and damp south-west monsoon. The rains seem specially suited to Europeans. While they last severe disorders are unusual, the prevailing complaints being slight fevers and chest and bowel complaints. Among the natives rheumatic and neuralgic affections are common and obstinate; Europeans are comparatively free from them. After the first burst of the south-west monsoon, rain falls for the most part in moderate quantities and in frequent light showers, which cool and freshen the air without as a rule preventing outdoor exercise.\nThe south-west monsoon on which the Sahy\u00e1dri and central belts mostly depend, begins about the middle of June and lasts till the end of September. As a rule, the south-west rain does not pass more than twenty miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The eastern belt, for the sowing of its early crops, depends chiefly on irregular storms between mid-May and mid-June, and, for the sowing of its late crops in October and November, for rain from the north-east monsoon. Besides in October and November some north-east rain occasionally falls about Christmas and in March or April. As a rule, close to the Sahy\u00e1dris, and in the Sahy\u00e1dri and central belts, the rainfall is heaviest, and, in the eastern belt which is further from the Sahy\u00e1dris, the rainfall is lightest. At the same time the rainfall does not solely depend on distance from the Sahy\u00e1dris. Places about the same distance from the Sahy\u00e1dris show a great variety in rainfall, and in some cases more distant stations have a better supply than stations further to the west. Of Medha and W\u00e1i which are about the same distance from the Sahy\u00e1dris, during the twenty-three years ending 1882-83, at Medha the highest recorded fall is 111 inches in 1882-83, and at W\u00e1i forty-nine inches in 1875-76. At Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 which is only twenty-five miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris, the lowest recorded fall is eight inches in 1871-72, and at Dahivadi, the most distant station from the Sahy\u00e1dris, the lowest is nine inches in 1866-67. Except at Malcolmpeeth, Medha, P\u00e1tan, and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the rainfall averages less than forty inches. At Malcolmpeeth, during the twenty-three years ending 1882-83, the rainfall averaged 255 inches.\n\nExcept that for Khand\u00e1l\u00e1, P\u00e1tan, Shir\u00e1la, Dahivadi, and T\u00e1sgaon they are wanting for a few years, for the twenty-three years ending 1882-83 rain returns are available for nine stations in the Sahy\u00e1dri and central belts, and for five stations in the eastern belt. During these twenty-three years the highest recorded fall is 373 inches at Malcolmpeeth in 1882-83 and the lowest is 7 inches at Vaduj in 1879-80 and at T\u00e1sgaon in 1876-77; the total average fall of the district varied from 72 inches in 1882-83 to 35 inches in 1871-72, and averaged 45 inches during the ten years ending 1869-70 and 50 inches during the thirteen years ending 1882-83.

During these nine years the fall varied from 56\u00b788 inches in 1853 to 33\u00b703 inches in 1855 and averaged 43\u00b717 inches. The details are: In 1852 a fall of 51\u00b713 inches, in 1853 of 56\u00b788 inches, in 1854 of 46\u00b731 inches, in 1855 of 33\u00b703 inches, in 1856 of 35\u00b770 inches, in 1857 of 47\u00b722 inches, in 1858 of 34\u00b708 inches, in 1859 of 41\u00b704 inches, and in 1860 of 43\u00b718 inches. Bombay Government Selections, New Series, LXXVIII, 16-17.\nMarch and December; three months during which rain generally falls, April May and November; and five months of unfailing rainfall, June July August September and October. Of the twenty-four years, in five rain fell in January, in four in February, in six in March, and in seven in December; in eighteen in April, in twenty-two in May, and in nineteen in November; and in all years in June July August September and October. Of the twelve months in the year, February is the driest month with a fall varying from $1.21$ inches in 1877 to zero for twenty years and averaging $0.09$ of an inch; March comes next with a fall varying from $1.07$ inches in 1863 to zero for eighteen years and averaging $0.10$ of an inch; December is third with a fall varying from $5.38$ inches in 1872 to zero for seventeen years and averaging $0.36$ of an inch; January is fourth, with a fall varying from $8.02$ inches in 1870 to zero for nineteen years and averaging $0.40$ of an inch; April is fifth, with a fall varying from $5.25$ inches in 1865 to zero for six years and averaging $0.67$ of an inch; November is sixth, with a fall varying from $5.57$ inches in 1864 to zero for five years and averaging $1.23$ inches; May is seventh, with a fall varying from $4.72$ inches in 1865 to zero for two years and averaging $1.38$ inches; October is eighth, with a fall varying from $9.55$ inches in 1867 to $0.02$ of an inch in 1876 and averaging $3.14$ inches; September is ninth, with a fall varying from $17.17$ inches in 1875 to $0.22$ of an inch in 1865, and averaging $4.34$ inches; August is tenth, with a fall varying from $19.36$ inches in 1861 to $1.97$ inches in 1880 and averaging $7.26$ inches; June is eleventh, with a fall varying from $17.85$ inches in 1863 to $0.43$ of an inch in 1881 and averaging $7.58$ inches; and July is the wettest month, with a fall varying from $27.81$ inches in 1882 to $4.53$ inches in 1877 and averaging $13.73$ inches. In this order of dry months January would come second instead of fourth, had it not been for the exceptional fall of eight inches in 1871. The goodness or badness of a year depends less on the fall for the whole year than on its distribution during the rainy months. In 1880, though the fall was the least recorded only twenty-nine inches, the season was not one of famine, because the rain was evenly distributed, $7\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in June, $6\\frac{1}{2}$ in July, two in August, and $4\\frac{1}{2}$ in September and October. Similarly in 1871, though of the total fall of forty inches about eight inches or one-fifth of the whole fell in January, 1871 was not a famine year, because the remaining thirty-two inches were fairly distributed, eight inches in June, ten in July, eight in August, one in September, and three in October. On the other hand, the year 1876 with a fall of thirty-one inches was a famine year, because the rain was badly distributed, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches fell in June, twenty-three in July, four in August, and almost none in September and October. Of twenty-four years, for four the yearly fall was more than fifty inches, fifty-eight in 1875, $57\\frac{1}{2}$ in 1882, $54\\frac{1}{2}$ in 1870, and $53\\frac{1}{2}$ in 1861; for eleven years the fall was between fifty and forty inches, and for nine years it was between forty and twenty-nine inches.

G. Moore, Col-\n\nstatement at page 22. As the monthly returns are supplied by the Civil Surgeon, the yearly total given in this statement is probably more accurate. The difference may, perhaps, be owing to one statement being returned for the calendar year beginning from January, and the other for the official year beginning from April.\n\n1 Information and Evidence collected by the Famine Commission, page 15.\nlector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, wrote in 1877: A fall of thirty-two inches, if well distributed between mid-May and January, is enough for the district; less than thirty-two inches damages the crops. Of these thirty-two inches three should fall in May, nine in June, five in July, five in August, five in September, four in October, none in November, and one between December and January. The May rain makes the grass spring and softens the soil so that the fields can be made ready to receive the westerly moonsoon in June. About five of the nine inches in June should fall between the 5th and the 20th so as to enable the husbandmen to complete the preparation of their fields and to sow b\u00e1yri in the east, early jv\u00e1ri and pulses in the centre, and rice and n\u00e1chni in the west. The remaining four inches cause the seed to sprout and the crops to grow. The five inches in July should fall about the middle of the month, to enable b\u00e1yri to be sown in the centre of the district. Rain in August and September is required for the proper growth of the crops, and if an inch or two falls at the end of September, with four inches at the beginning of October, the late or rabi crop can be sown, and will flourish. The cold weather crops need an inch in December or January, about Christmas or New Year's Day, to help them on. If rain does not fall in May or June the grass crop will probably fail in the centre and west of the district, and rice will probably not be sown. If rain falls early in June and if there is a long break, the rice and n\u00e1chni wither. If rain does not fall in June or up to the twentieth of July, the kharif or rain crop will not be sown. If good rain falls in June and none in July or August, the kharif will be lost. If seasonable rain falls at the end of September and the beginning of October, the rabi or cold weather crop will thrive. If no rain falls in September and October, but a fall comes early in November, the rabi crop will not be so good; if no rain falls in September October or November, the rabi crop will fail. The worst results are caused by the failure of the easterly rain in May, and by a scanty fall from the west in June and July.\n\nDuring the five years ending 1881, the extreme greatest heat varied from 104\u00b0 in May 1881 to 76\u00b0 in August 1879; the extreme least heat from 76\u00b0 in May 1878 to 56\u00b0 in November and December 1879 and in January 1880; the mean greatest heat from 96\u00b0 in April 1879 to 72\u00b0 in August 1879; the mean least heat from 79\u00b0 in May 1881 to 60\u00b0 in December 1879 and in January 1880; the mean range from 21\u00b0 in February 1880 to 1\u00b0 in August 1879; and the mean temperature from 89\u00b0 in May 1879 to 68\u00b0 in December 1879.

Between four and five in the evening of the 7th of April 1850, accompanied by a fierce duststorm, a tremendous fall of hail occurred at a village called Kondval about six miles from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The hailstones were as large as cocoanuts: houses fell, cattle were slain, and in the river many large fish were killed. For several hours the hill sides near the village were white as if after a fall of snow.\\(^1\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Transactions Bombay Geographical Society, IX, 195.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRODUCTION.\u00b9\n\nNear the Sahyadris, in twenty villages of J\u00e1vli, thirty of P\u00e1tan, and three of the Shir\u00e1la petty division of V\u00e1lva, iron ore is found in the murum or crumbled trap below the laterite.\u00b2 Till within the last thirty years the iron ore was smelted by a class of Musalm\u00e1ns called Dhavads. In fixing where to dig for ore the Dhavads looked first to the presence on the surface of small lime nodules or pieces of kankar of the size of a masur bean. The next best sign of ore was a heavy blackish-yellow earth. When a spot was fixed for a mine, a round pit was dug about four feet in diameter and six to ten feet deep. The digging employed four Dhavads for three days. While digging, the Dhavads cut small holes in the pit side, to serve as steps in going up and down the pit. Under the soil the iron ore was traced by digging towards parts where, in the first layer the earth was mixed with small round stones, in the second layer with reddish murum, in the third layer with whitish murum, and in the fourth layer with yellowish murum. In the fifth layer, at a depth of six to ten feet, the earth was generally sandy, and small nodules of iron ore were found. As these layers did not always lie one below the other the digging seldom passed straight down like a well. After the pit was dug, the ore was taken out of it in baskets with the help of ropes and the steps cut in the pit-side. From the pit the ore was brought to the smelting place in the form of nodules. Before they were smelted the iron nodules were burnt in a kiln in the same way as lime nodules. They were then moved from the kiln, and, with iron hammers, pounded to pieces about the size of gram-peas. To smelt the powdered ore a pit was dug about a foot in diameter and a foot and a half deep, and round the pit was built a wall about two feet high made of\n\n\u00b9 Most of this chapter is contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\n\u00b2 The twenty villages of J\u00e1vli are Ahir, Bhekavli, Deur, Gavdhosi, Indavi, Jungti, K\u00e1rgaon, Kas, Kusavdi, Machutor, Mah\u00e1baleshvar near the Tadil stream, Malcolmpeith, Malusar, Manji, Pali, Pimpri, Rula, T\u00e1k\u00e1vi, V\u00e1sota, and Vela. Of these villages, six, Bhekavli, Machutor, Mah\u00e1baleshvar, Malcolmpeith, Malusar, and Manji, are on the Mah\u00e1baleshwar hills. The thirty villages of P\u00e1tan are \u00c1yal, Atoli, Chapher, Dicholi, Dhokovle, Ghanbi, Gh\u00e1tm\u00e1tha, Gojigaon, Gokul, Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed, Humbarna, Kavanjv\u00e1da, Karvat, Kasni, Kense, Kisurla, Kondhavla, Kusavdi, Maneri, N\u00e1vji, Niknur, Falshi, P\u00e1nchgani, P\u00e1neri, Rasota, Risvad, Sator, Shirisinga, Tona, and Vatola. The three villages of Shir\u00e1la are Chandoli, Gava, and Randhiva.\npowdered flint mixed with white earth. At the bottom of the wall was a hole about a foot in diameter. Through this hole a tube, nearly a foot long, and made of ground flint and clay, together with two hand bellows was fixed in the wall, and the hole was closed. At the bottom of the furnace powdered charcoal or earth was laid to collect the smelted ore. The furnace was filled with ten parts of charcoal to one part of powdered ore, and heated till the ore melted. The charcoal was of the wood of the *anjan* Memecylon tinctorium, *gehela* Randia dumetorum, *jambhul* Syzygium jambolanum, and *umbar* Ficus glomerata, as these kinds of timber give strong and lasting heat. When the iron was melted while still red-hot the metal was taken out and hammered into a ball. Fifty to eighty pounds of powdered ore yielded five or six pounds of iron. It answered well for common field tools. Every part of the process was carried out by the Dhavads. If dug and smelted by paid labour, forty pounds of iron would cost the workers 10s. to 12s. (Rs. 5-6), and would fetch 15s. to 16s. (Rs. 7\u00bd-8). The Dhavads worked the iron into axes, sickles, griddles, pans, and other tools and vessels, most of which were bought in the Dhavads\u2019 villages by traders from Wai, Satara, and Poona. The Dhavad iron workers, though Musalmans in name, worship Hindu gods. They keep Musalm\u00e1n holidays and at birth marriage and death follow Musalm\u00e1n customs. They are strong and robust, speak a rough Marathi and Hindustani, and eat most kinds of animal food, even the flesh of dead buffaloes oxen and cows. Of late, partly from the want of fuel and partly from the cheapness of imported iron, the Dhavads have given up smelting. At present (1883) they live as labourers chiefly by road-making and myrobolan-gathering. Some of them are active snake-killers and often claim the monthly reward of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) sanctioned in the Satara and Javli treasuries at 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) a snake.\n\nFrom its nearness to the Sahyadris and the rocky nature of much of its soil the district is well supplied with stone for building and for road metal. The prevailing stone is trap in the plains and laterite on the hills. The trap is dark in colour and weighs 180 to 185 pounds the cubic foot. It is a hard compact stone well suited for masonry purposes, and, except when it has been exposed to the weather, is not generally difficult to work. Masons, as a rule, prefer freshly quarried stones to stones which have been exposed to the air for any length of time. The cost of blasting trap is 7s. to 8s. (Rs. 3\u00bd-4) the hundred cubic feet. Trap coursed masonry costs \u00a31 12s. to \u00a33 10s. (Rs. 16-35) the hundred cubic feet, the more expensive sorts being used almost solely for large bridges. Facing stones cost 12s. to 16s. (Rs. 6-8) the hundred, bond or through stones two and a half feet long each of a cubic foot and a half, cost \u00a31 (Rs. 10) the hundred; stones three feet long each of two cubic feet cost \u00a31 8s. (Rs. 14) the hundred; and corner stones cost \u00a31 4s. to \u00a31 8s. (Rs. 12-14) the hundred cubic feet. Chisel-dressed arch work of trap costs about \u00a38 (Rs. 80) the hundred cubic feet, arch facing stones about \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25), and arch corner stones about \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 16). Trap rubble costs 4s. to 7s. (Rs. 2-3\u00bd) the hundred cubic feet. Laterite can be blasted at 3s. to 4s. (Rs. 1\u00bd-2) the hundred cubic feet. It is softer than trap and is easily worked with a tool like a half\npickaxe. Laterite hardens in the air and makes a good building stone, but, as it is porous, if the walls are exposed to much wet, the outer surface should be plastered. Laterite is useful for small road drains, but, as it soon wears, trap corner stones are generally required. Only very hard laterite is used for large culverts. Almost all the Mah\u00e1baleshvar and P\u00e1nchgani houses are built of laterite as a very good quality of this stone abounds on the hill top. Good laterite masonry costs about \u00a32 (Rs. 20) the hundred cubic feet.\n\nThe metal used for making and mending roads is trap in the plains costing about 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) the hundred cubic feet, and laterite on the hills costing 3s. to 4s. (Rs. 1\u00bd-2) the hundred cubic feet. Trap is the better material and alone wears well under heavy traffic. Laterite binds well, and is good metal for roads with light traffic. Besides trap and laterite, murum or crumbled trap is largely used for roads. Murum is found overlying solid rock, sometimes on the surface and sometimes at some depth under black soil. It is either gray or reddish brown. The reddish brown is the better variety. When dug it comes away in flakes and large nodules and makes a good fine-weather road surface. Murumed roads become very heavy in wet weather and very dusty in dry weather.\n\nSand of good quality is found in the beds of all large streams on the plains, the cost varying from 1s. to 6s. (Rs. \u00bd-3) the hundred cubic feet according to the distance it has to be carried. On the hills where sand is not found ground laterite is used instead of sand.\n\nLime stone is found all over the district in the plains, especially near W\u00e1i. It is either nodular called kankar, or it occurs in seams along river banks. Kankar, if properly burnt, makes good mortar, but the river seams yield the best lime for building. As stronger materials are abundant lime stone is not used as a road metal. As it is seldom found on the hills, lime is sent from W\u00e1i to the stations of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and P\u00e1nchgani. The lime nodules or kankar used in the T\u00e1rl\u00ed bridge when analysed were found to contain, out of 100 parts, 12\u00b700 of clay, 0\u00b740 of sand, 1\u00b740 of oxide of iron, 84\u00b770 of carbonate of lime, and 1\u00b750 of carbonate of magnesia. The lime from seams used at the V\u00e1rna bridge contained 14\u00b760 parts of clay, 4 of sand, 2 of oxide of iron, 78 of carbonate of lime, and 1\u00b740 of carbonate of magnesia. The lime, which is supposed to have been used in building the Prat\u00e1pgad fort contains 51\u00b780 parts of lime, 3\u00b713 of iron and alumina, 2\u00b759 of silica, 2\u00b726 of magnesia, 35\u00b732 of carbonic acid, 3\u00b757 of sulphuric acid, and 1\u00b733 of moisture.\n\nGood clay for bricks and tiles is found in nearly all river banks. W\u00e1i, B\u00e1vdhan, M\u00e1huli, and Kar\u00e1d are known for their bricks and tiles, the bricks costing 9s. to 14s. (Rs. 4\u00bd-7) the thousand, and the tiles 7s. to 10s. (Rs. 3\u00bd-5). Ridge tiles cost about 10s. (Rs. 5) the hundred. Besides bricks and tiles, earthen vessels are made of the local black soil mixed with sand.\n\nBefore the passing of the salt act, Act VII of 1873, considerable quantities of salt were produced in M\u00e1n in the north-east of the district. A whitish surface soil called karal was gathered into heaps. Water was poured on the heaps till they were turned to liquid mud, and the mud was drained through an opening into\npits dug close by. The liquid was boiled in a large caldron, like those used for boiling sugarcane juice, until there remained nothing but small crystals of salt, which the poorer classes used and called *mengemith*. About forty pounds (20 *shers*) of the liquid produced six or eight pounds (3 or 4 *shers*) of salt. The salt was bitter and greatly inferior to sea salt. The manufacture still continues in the states of \u00c1tp\u00e1di and Phaltan and a good deal is imported into M\u00e1n and sold at forty to sixty pounds (20 to 30 *shers*) the rupee.\n\nThe S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forests have an area of 662\u00bd square miles or 13\u00b78 per cent of the whole district. Almost the whole area is hill land. The forest lands are scattered over the whole district, and are much broken by private and cultivated land. In the west the belt of evergreen forest along the line of the Sahy\u00e1dris is divided into six forest ranges, W\u00e1i, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, J\u00e1vli, Mah\u00e1baleshvar, P\u00e1tan, and V\u00e1lva. These six forest ranges are fairly compact and have little cultivated land. The seven eastern forest ranges, Khand\u00e1la, Kar\u00e1d, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v, Koregaon, and T\u00e1sgaon, are bare hills with here and there a little scrub and teak. In the eastern ranges the forest land is much mixed with private and cultivated tracts.\n\nIn 1872 the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forests were separated from the Poona forests and made a distinct charge. Between 1872 and 1878, besides one clerk and two messengers costing \u00a355 4s. (Rs. 552) a year for the office of the assistant conservator, a staff of three foresters at a yearly cost of \u00a3108 (Rs. 1080), and of twenty-four guards at a yearly cost of \u00a3225 12s. (Rs. 2256) was entertained and temporary hands were engaged for broken periods. Since 1878 the staff has been (1883-84) raised to twelve permanent foresters and twenty-four guards costing \u00a3633 12s. (Rs. 6336) a year. The permanent staff is supplemented by a temporary establishment of 186 guards costing \u00a31659 12s. (Rs. 16,596) a year. The temporary establishment is kept throughout the year, and, except that service in it does not count for pension, does not differ from the permanent staff. Besides these establishments there are two officers of whom one on \u00a3540 (Rs. 5400) a year is a district forest officer with an office establishment of three clerks and three messengers costing \u00a388 16s. (Rs. 888) a year, and the other is an assistant district forest officer with a temporary office establishment of one clerk and two messengers costing \u00a3247 4s. (Rs. 2472) a year. The office establishment of the forest settlement officer includes two clerks, two surveyors, and four messengers, and costs \u00a3352 8s. (Rs. 3524) a year. In 1883-84 the forest charges amounted to \u00a33521 12s. (Rs. 35,216).\n\nThe S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forest lands belong to three groups, the evergreen Sahy\u00e1dri forest lands, the slopes of the spurs that run east from the\n\n---\n\n1 Except demarcation which is contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C. S., the forest section has been compiled from materials supplied by Mr. H. Mainwaring, District Forest Officer, and from the Annual Administration Reports.\n\n2 The Mah\u00e1baleshvar forests within five miles from M\u00e1loolmpeth, including the reserves of fifty-six villages of J\u00e1vli and of nine villages of W\u00e1i, were under the superintendent of Mah\u00e1baleshvar till May 1878 and were then made over to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district forest officer. Gov. Res. 2784 of 30th May 1878.\nSahy\u00e1dris, and the bare or bush-sprinkled hills to the east of the Krishna. The evergreen forests of the Sahy\u00e1dri range form a belt along the west of the district six to fourteen miles broad. These forests extend through the whole length of the district from Bhor in the north to Kolh\u00e1pur in the south. They stretch almost without a break through the whole of this distance and are not much broken by tillage. They contain many trees valuable both for timber and as firewood. The chief of these are jambul Eugenia jambolanum, anjan Memecylon tinctorium, ain Terminalia glabra, umbar Ficus glomerata, kenjal Terminalia paniculata, hirda Terminalia chebula, phanas Artocarpus integrifolia, n\u00e1na Lagerstr\u00e6mia parviflora, and bamboos. As they form the catchment basin of the Krishna and several of its chief feeders, the Vena, Urmodi, T\u00e1rl\u00ed, Koyna, and V\u00e1rna, it is important that the slopes of these hills should be covered with wood. On account of the difficulty of transport the Sahy\u00e1dri forests yield little revenue. The forest lands are crossed by two highways, the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun and the Mah\u00e1bleshvar-Mah\u00e1d roads. Numerous tracks also lead to the Konkan which are used by villagers and small traders who bring up the produce of the Konkan on pack bullocks.\n\nOf the second group of forest lands a considerable portion of the slopes of the spurs which branch east from the Sahy\u00e1dris is covered with teak mixed with brushwood. Teak is not common on the lower slopes of the western sections of these spurs. It gradually thins in the upper slopes and in all parts of the hill sides towards the eastern ends of the spurs. These teak forests are much broken by patches of cultivated land. The third group of forest lands, the bare or bush-sprinkled hills to the east of the Krishna, includes the south slopes of the Mah\u00e1dev hills bordering the north of the district, and the two ranges which run north and south parallel to the Krishna and separated from one another by the valley of the Yerla. The westerly sections of these hills have some scrub and in places a few teak trees. Further east vegetation grows less, until, in their eastern sections, many of these ranges are bare rocks. That these rocks were once less bare of trees is shown by isolated temple groves. These groves occasionally occur in spots specially suited for trees, but they are also sometimes found in exposed open hill sides in no way differing in character or position from many surrounding treeless tracts. It seems probable that much of the hill sides was once wooded and that those patches alone remain which were the dwellings of gods and therefore might not be cut.\n\nIn the east and north-east of the district both the Yerla and the M\u00e1n and the streams which feed them run dry in the hot weather. Since 1877-78 much tree seed has been sown broadcast in all the ranges. The result in the west is fair. In the east, of the seedlings which sprang up many have failed to live through the hot weather. In spite of these difficulties partly from seedlings, but chiefly from guarding the self-sown growth of underwood, greenness is slowly spreading over many patches of hill side.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Administration Report of 1878-79 para 24, and 1880-81 page 16.\nShortly before the annexation of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1847) it was brought to the notice of Government that the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra mountain ranges were peculiarly bare of trees. The conservator Dr. Gibson remarked that this barrenness was in a measure peculiar to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory, and that it was due to the carelessness of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chiefs. The Peshw\u00e1s had been strict in preserving trees and in British districts the Peshwa's policy had, to some extent, been followed. Though careless of forests the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chiefs everywhere maintained the royalty in teak, sandalwood, and blackwood. Here and there special reserves known as kurans were kept chiefly near head-quarters and in the teak-growing tracts. In the Sahy\u00e1dris certain parts were reserved for thick forest by order of the Mar\u00e1tha Government, occasionally near forts apparently to make them less accessible and sometimes for the shelter of villages from the storms of the southwest monsoon. Almost every Sahy\u00e1dri village had its sacred grove and often other thick bits of forest reserved by the villagers themselves. These last were usually in inaccessible situations where wood-ash tillage was unprofitable and which were used as palm nurseries and perhaps for fuel and building timber. Over the rest of the hills wood-ash tillage had entirely cleared high forest. From 1860 to 1862, at the introduction of the survey settlement, the opportunity was taken to set apart considerable forest reserves. In all of these reserves grazing was allowed either free or on payment, but it was specially stipulated that the numbers were set apart for the growth of trees. As under the survey system the assessment was calculated on the principle of continuous payment, the amount was fixed at a very low rate generally 3d. to 4\u00bdd. (2-3 as.) the acre. Wood-ash tillage requires long periods of fallow. The cultivators therefore found it to their immediate interest to take all the land they could get at the low rates and throw it up when the fallow periods came round under the impression that their lands would then be reserved and the reserves opened to them for cultivation when the lands had recovered. When they found that the land was not again offered to them the cultivators were in great trouble, and to prevent distress it was found necessary to allot more land for wood-ash tillage. Fresh grants were made between 1868 and 1872 by Messrs Spence and Wilson. In time these lands also became exhausted, and in 1875 Messrs. Shuttleworth and Winter entered upon a joint demarcation to consolidate the forest and provide lands for wood-ash tillage. In 1878 a change was made in the forest policy of Government. It was decided that the need for increased forest conservancy was urgent to protect soil from being washed away; for the storage of water at the sources of great rivers; and on general considerations of climate and rainfall. It was decided that wood-ash tillage should be restricted and the infliction of some hardship on the agriculturists faced for these ends. After the introduction of the Forest Act all waste land in the Sahy\u00e1dris and a considerable area in the plains was formally proclaimed reserved forest. The area thus notified was 594,606 acres. It soon came to light that much of this waste was unsuited for forest, and that to keep it as forest would be injurious to cultivation without yielding any corresponding advantage. A large area of waste suitable for\nforest but not proclaimed, remained in the east of the district. In parts of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds the hardship caused by the stricter policy proved unbearable, while everywhere the enforcement of the new Forest Act was impossible as the people had hitherto been allowed to take many kinds of forest produce without interference. The result was that in 1880 an assistant collector was appointed to determine the rights existing in proclaimed forest lands and to recommend how claims not amounting to rights should be dealt with. The final proposals of the demarcation and settlement officer for all but three sub-divisions remain only for report, and the whole work of forest demarcation and settlement, except the acquisition of certain lands eventually to be included in forest, will be finished by the end of May 1885. Besides settling forest rights the assistant collector was directed to make a final demarcation of the forest lands, where necessary to recommend the exclusion of lands already proclaimed forest, and to consolidate forest blocks by exchange, or, if exchange was not possible, by purchase. Regard was to be had both to the interests of cultivation and of forest conservancy. In the parts of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds where distress was found to prevail, land was to be allotted for wood-ash tillage regulated on a fixed system of most troublesome rotation. The demarcation of the part of the wood-ash tract was completed in 1881, that of the rest of the district was systematically begun in 1882, during the latter half of which exchanges were negotiated all over the district. In 1883 the final demarcation line was fixed and sanctioned by Government for the sub-divisions of W\u00e1i, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and J\u00e1vli. Of 148,964 acres proclaimed forest in 1879, 4242 acres were to be excluded; the forest area was to be increased by 11,283 acres part available and part to be obtained by purchase or exchange, and the final limit of the forest area of these three sub-divisions was put at 200,627 acres or 313\u00bd square miles. Government at the same time sanctioned the settlement of rights in the proclaimed reserves and decided what privileges should be continued and under what restrictions. The rights admitted included rights of way, and access to springs, temples, and watercourses. The privileges allowed were grazing and gathering dead wood, thorns, and other minor forest products.\n\nThe chief timber trade is in teak rafters. The trade is small. It is only to meet the demand for timber required for local house building. When they have no other work a few cartmen buy small quantities of timber and carry it for sale to the different timber markets. The timber dealers are chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and a few are Musalm\u00e1n Bohor\u00e1s. The largest teak rafters grown in the district are not above one or 1\u00bd feet in diameter at the base. All larger timber has to be imported. The average prices obtained at the auction sales vary according to size from \u00a31 to \u00a34 (Rs.10-40) the hundred rafters. There is always a demand for firewood from the east of the district, but the forest lands are so bare of trees that the demand cannot always be supplied. A firewood store has been established at the hill station of Mah\u00e1baleshvar to supply residents and visitors. The price charged is 2s. 6d.\nthe khandi of 784 pounds. At Mah\u00e1baleshvar inferior rafters known as raival, that is building timber other than teak, fetch a fair price and are used in building and repairing the station bungalows. Of minor forest produce the chief is the myrobalan berry the fruit of the hirda or Terminalia chebula. Since 1879 the myrobalan has become a source of profit to Government. This tree is found in the evergreen Sahy\u00e1dri forests. The fruit is gathered by the villagers and brought by them to Government stores where they are paid 1s. 3\u00bdd. to 1s. 9d. (10\u00bd - 14 as.) the hundredweight. It is dried and sold by auction to merchants who export it largely to Europe where it is used in tanning and dyeing. During the four years ending 1882 about 1088 tons (3102 khandis) of myrobalans were gathered at a cost of \u00a32155 (Rs. 21,550), and sold at \u00a34592 (Rs. 45,920), leaving a profit of \u00a32437 (Rs. 24,370). In 1883 hardly any myrobalans were gathered, as the crop was wholly destroyed by locusts who eagerly devoured the hirda blossom.\n\nThe district has no special forest tribes. The villagers in the Sahy\u00e1dri forests are Kunbis, Dhangars, Mh\u00e1rs, and Dhavads. The first three live by wood-ash or kumri tillage and by keeping cattle; the Dhavads live by labour. The day's wages given to villagers employed in cutting timber vary from 3\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (2 - 3 as.). At these rates teak rafters can be cut by the forest department at about 5s. to 6s. (Rs. 2\u00bd - 3) the hundred and firewood at 1s. (8 as.) the khandi of 784 pounds.\n\nExcept in 1872 and 1878 when receipts were unusually low, during the thirteen years ending 1882-83, receipts have risen from \u00a32261 (Rs. 22,610) in 1870-71 to \u00a36010 (Rs. 60,100) in 1882-83, and charges from \u00a31055 (Rs. 10,550) in 1870-71 to \u00a35276 (Rs. 52,760) in 1882-83. For four years between 1878-79 and 1881-82 the forest department worked at a loss on account of the large establishment which was required to protect the forestlands and the small area which at present yields saleable timber. Since the 1876-77 famine the demand for timber has increased, the number of pieces of teak sold having risen from 13,119 in 1878-79 to 32,619 in 1882-83. There is also a good local demand for fuel. But in the present bare state of so much of the forest lands many years must pass before any considerable forest revenue can be expected. In 1882-83, in spite of the large establishment, the forest lands yielded a profit of \u00a3734 (Rs. 7340).\n\nThe details of forest receipts and charges during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 are:\n\n| Year | Produce | Cost | Sale | Profit |\n|------|---------|------|------|--------|\n| 1879 | Khandis | 480 | 390 | 884 | 474 |\n| 1880 | 1056 | 696 | 1162 | 466 |\n| 1881 | 711 | 468 | 1105 | 637 |\n| 1882 | 855 | 601 | 1461 | 830 |\n| Total | 3102 | 2155 | 4592 | 2437 |\n\n1 The details are: S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Myrobalans, 1879-1882.\nThe cultivated parts of the district have but a thin sprinkling of trees. Most large villages and towns have mango groves near them, but the fields and hedges have few trees except occasional teak and b\u00e1hhul near waste land. The only parts of the district where timber has been encouraged and cared for are along the roadsides, most of which are shaded by fine avenues of b\u00e1hhul mangoes.\n\nAccording to the Collector's 1882 stock returns the district farm stock included 246,921 oxen, 152,640 cows, 115,311 buffaloes, 13,390 horses, 425,374 sheep and goats, 4394 asses, and a few pigs and mules.\n\nOxen.\n\nThe Oxen, returned at 246,921, are of two breeds, the local and the khill\u00e1ri. The khill\u00e1ri bullocks are said to come from the east. Both breeds are used for field purposes. The khill\u00e1ri, though the larger and more muscular animal, is somewhat delicate and does not live so long as the local bullock. A common khill\u00e1ri bullock will sell for \u00a35 (Rs.50), in the cattle market of Mhasvad in M\u00e1n good ones sell for \u00a310 (Rs.100), and in parts of the district a choice animal fetches as much as \u00a320 (Rs.200). The tiny quick-running Surat bullocks are occasionally seen in light riding carts. Except a few from the Bhima valley oxen are seldom imported.\n\nThere is no special breed of Cows or of Buffaloes. It is said that Surat cows were imported a century ago. Cows and she-buffaloes are used for their milk only, except when necessity compels their use for field purposes. He-buffaloes and oxen are used for draught. The price of a good cow varies from \u00a32 to \u00a34 (Rs.20-40) and of a good she-buffalo from \u00a33 to \u00a34 (Rs.30-40). The skins of buffaloes, oxen, and cows are used by Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs and Dhors for making shoes, thongs, and water-bags. Buffalo meat is little eaten by Musalm\u00e1ns; but Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs, who have a right to the carcasses of dead buffaloes, eat almost every part of them. Large herds of buffaloes are often seen on the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds in charge of a single boy or girl. They are driven at night into enclosures hedged with rough posts generally five or six feet high. In other parts of the district the cows and buffaloes live either close to or inside of their owner's house.\n\nFew of the people own Horses. Except by chiefs and the wealthier land proprietors the animals ridden by the people of the district are seldom more than ponies. The valley of the M\u00e1n\n\n---\n\n1 A list of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forest trees is given in the Appendix.\nused to be famous for its horses, but all interest in horse-breeding has died out. In 1878 Government set apart three stud horses for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra but little use was made of them, fifty mares were served and only six foals were produced. The Collector complained that the mares brought were unfit for breeding and that the higher classes were indifferent to horse-breeding. During the three years ending 1877-78 no chief or proprietor had made use of any of the Government horses. In 1883 the results were a little better. Of thirty-nine mares served ten were in foal. Up to 1878, to encourage horse-breeding, horse shows were held in February at Pingli about two miles south of Dahivadi, and in December at Mhasvad fifteen miles east of Dahivadi. The animals shown were unsatisfactory both in number and quality and these shows have been (1883) discontinued. A weekly cattle fair is held at Belav\u00e1de in Kar\u00e1d where a considerable number of horses and ponies are sold. A few animals are brought from the Bhima valley; none leave the district.\n\nSheep and Goats, returned at 425,347, are bred locally. Few sheep or goats either come into the district or leave it. The price of a sheep varies from about 2s. to 6s. (Rs. 1-3). They are chiefly reared by the Dhangars in the east of the district. These with the Sangars, a branch of the same caste, use the wool of their sheep in weaving kambl\u00eds or coarse blankets, which is one of the largest industries in the district. Sheep\u2019s milk is said to be drunk chiefly by shepherds and seldom by husbandmen, who rarely take it except as a cure for colds. Sir Bartle Frere, while Commissioner in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in 1849, introduced some sheep from Kh\u00e1ndesh, but the cross breed was too delicate, was never popular, and has died out. Goats are valued chiefly for their milk. One breed of goat, found all over the district, yields long hair which Dhangars work into country ropes. Surat goats are occasionally imported for their milk. Sheep and goats are pastured almost solely by Dhangars. During the rains they are kept in the east of the district feeding on waste numbers or on grass lands. As the dry season advances, the shepherds move west to the pastures on and near the Sahy\u00e1dris. Sheep manure is highly valued by the holders of rich soil, who pay the owners of flocks either in money or grain to pen their animals on particular fields. Sheep and goats are lawful food to almost all S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Hindus, except Br\u00e1hmans, Son\u00e1rs, Gur\u00e1vs, and Sut\u00e1rs. Some well-to-do Musalm\u00e1ns and in rare cases Kunbis eat mutton daily. As a rule meat is eaten only on such great days as the Dasara in October and at marriages and other family festivities. Goats and sheep are occasionally offered to the gods. Sheep skins and goat skins are used for making ropes, thongs, and shoes, and goat skins for the sounding boards of various musical instruments, and their intestines for string. The usual mode of guarding sheep and goats at night is by a hedge of thorns, or by a long net stretched and supported by stakes driven into the ground, while men and dogs watch against thieves and wild beasts.\n\nPigs are kept for eating by Vaddars and Kaik\u00e1dis. Donkeys are kept as pack animals by some V\u00e1nis and Kumbh\u00e1rs and also by Vaddars. Mules are used sparingly as pack animals, and camels are\nrarely seen. Dogs abound in every village and are used for herding sheep. None are of good breed. Except Br\u00e1hmins, almost all classes rear hens. The eggs and more rarely the hens are sold in the local markets. Ducks and pigeons are occasionally kept and some Musalm\u00e1ns rear geese.\n\nIn the west near the Sahy\u00e1dris chiefly in the Koyna valley and the hills of the Mala pass are found the Tiger, Felis tigris, v\u00e1g; the Panther, Felis pardus, bibla v\u00e1g; the Bear, Ursus labiatus, \u00e1sval; the S\u00e1mbar, Rusa aristotelis, s\u00e1mbar; the Spotted Deer, Axis maculatus, chittal; the Ribfaced or Barking Deer, Cervulus aurus, bhenkar; the Hog Deer, Axis porcinus, p\u00e1ra; and the Bison, Gav\u00e6us gaurus, gava. In the east are the Hyena, Hy\u00e6na striata, taras; the Wolf, Canis pallipes, l\u00e1ndga; the Fox, Vulpes bengalensis, khokad; the Leopard, Felis jubata, chitta; the Antelope or Black Buck, Antelope bezoartica, k\u00e1lvit; and the Chink\u00e1ra or Indian Gazelle, Gazelle bennettii, m\u00e1lsand. Common to both east and west are the Hare, Lepus nigricollis, sasa; the Porcupine, Hystria lenoura, s\u00e1y\u00e1l; the Monkey, Presbytis entellus, v\u00e1nar or m\u00e1kad; the Hog, Sus indicus, dukar; and the Wild Cat, comprising the Civet, Viverra malaccensis, jav\u00e1di m\u00e1njar, and the Common Tree Cat, Paradoxurus musanga, ud. Neither tigers nor panthers are so numerous as to do much damage, though occasionally man-eating tigers appear, and, owing to their exceeding cunning and the large forests of the Koyna valley, are very difficult to destroy. Of late years bison have increased in the forests on the Mala pass hills, but they seldom come north of Helv\u00e1k though they were formerly found in the neighbourhood of Mah\u00e1baleshvar. A bull bison was shot on Mah\u00e1baleshvar in 1873. S\u00e1mbar have also increased in the Mala pass forests as the forest area is so large that it is nearly impossible to drive them out. They have almost ceased in the woodlands to the north of Helv\u00e1k as the villagers of that tract have killed large numbers by netting. The nets are laid in the s\u00e1mbar's runs and a line of men form, and, starting from the nets, beat the forest away from the nets. The s\u00e1mbar, imagining that they are being driven to people armed with guns, break through the line of beaters and rush into the nets where they are killed by men hid near. Almost every village has these nets which are about twelve feet high and twenty feet long. Though the people kill does and fawns, the spread of reserved forests has been yearly increasing the number of s\u00e1mbar. Bears are not numerous. They do no harm, and, except when they have young ones or are suddenly surprised, are never known to attack man. They feed on roots and berries and on white ants. Wild dogs kill many spotted and small deer, and the people say that they will hunt down and kill tigers. No case of a tiger being killed by wild dogs is known to have occurred in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In the east the antelope or black buck used to be common; but their numbers of late have greatly decreased. The best ground for black buck shooting is between Pusses\u00e1vli in Khat\u00e1v and Kadegaon in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. A good many of the people have guns, which, when they are not using, they lend to R\u00e1moshis and does and fawns are killed indiscriminately. The shik\u00e1ris or hunters too, take many by nooses laid on the ground and also with the help of tame bucks. They fasten nooses to the horns of the tame bucks and let\nthem go. The wild bucks in fighting with the tame ones, entangle their horns in the nooses and are caught. The chink\u00e1ra or Indian gazelle is found in small numbers in the hills about M\u00e1n. Wolves and hyenas are mostly found in the hills round Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and in the range between Phaltan and Khat\u00e1v. Even there they are scarce. Many licenses to keep guns have been granted for their destruction, but neither wolves nor hyenas are often shot.\n\nAccording to yearly returns of wild animals, during the eight years ending 1882, 294 persons were killed by wild animals, of whom twenty-three were killed by tigers, twenty-eight by other animals, and 243 by snakes; the number of cattle killed by wild animals was 661, of whom 589 were killed by tigers and leopards, and seventy-two by other wild animals and snakes. During the same eight years, of the wild animals killed for Government rewards thirty-four tigers were killed for \u00a373 12s. (Rs. 736), ninety-three leopards for \u00a382 10s. (Rs. 825), and 164,826 snakes for \u00a31027 12s. (Rs. 10,276). The details of wild animals killed are: five tigers, seven leopards, and 12,506 snakes in 1875; four tigers, four leopards, and 9980 snakes in 1876; eight tigers, ten leopards, and 16,483 snakes in 1877; three tigers, eleven leopards, and 7535 snakes in 1878; two tigers, eleven leopards, and 15,645 snakes in 1879; one tiger, thirteen leopards, and 43,724 snakes in 1880; five tigers, twenty-one leopards, and 38,712 snakes in 1881; and six tigers, sixteen leopards, and 20,241 snakes in 1882.\n\nThe list of snakes given in the Poona Statistical Account applies to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nThe Vena, Krishna, Koyna, and V\u00e1rna have large pools that hold water throughout the year and are fairly stocked with fish. Rivers like the M\u00e1n and Yerla which dry during the hot weather have no fish of any considerable size. The best, or at least the most frequently eaten fish, are the maral, malya, t\u00e1mbat, shing\u00e1da, and v\u00e1mb. The chief fishing castes are the Bhois and Kolis, and Kunbis and Muhammadans fish for their own use. No class of men live solely on their earnings as fishermen. The eating of fish is not uncommon among Musalm\u00e1ns and most low caste Hindus. Fish are caught by poisoning the water with the juice of the milkbush, by large nets which are floated in the stream, and by small hand-nets whose meshes are not more than three-quarters to one-eighth of an inch in circumference. Other modes of fishing, which are occasionally practised, are by turning the stream into a large basket or some other open receptacle, by throwing a dam across a stream, or by throwing up large quantities of water in which fish are also thrown up, and lastly by placing large earthen pots in the water and closing them when the fish enter. Fish are nearly always sold fresh, and from house to house; few are sold in the markets. In some places fish are preserved as sacred animals. In other places people fish where they please, though there seems to be an understanding that each village has a prior right to the fishing within its own limits and from its own river banks.\n\nThe following notes on the birds of the district are contributed by Mr. G.Vidal, C.S., as a supplement to Dr. Fairbank\u2019s Popular List of the Birds found in the Mar\u00e1tha country:\nGame Birds. The common Sandgrouse, Pterocles exustus, is plentiful but P. fasciatus the Painted Grouse is rare. The abode of the Sandgrouse is in the east, and its food consists in great part of the seeds of the common thistle. The Painted Partridge, Francolinus pictus, is common in the south-east of the district, about T\u00e1sgaon and Jath, and is generally found in sugarcane. The common Gray Partridge, Ortygornis pondicerianus, is also found. Neither Gray Coturnix communis, nor Rain Quail C. coromandelica, are plentiful in the district, and they scarcely repay pursuit in the cold weather. In February and March after the rabi or late crops have been reaped, they take to the rivers and find shelter in the tamarisk bushes in the beds and on the banks of the larger streams. On the Nira and parts of the Krishna fair bags may be obtained. Rain Quail breed in September in the long grass of the meadows or kurans round the city of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; Gray Quail are believed not to breed in the district. Jungle Bush Quail, Perdicula asiatica, are common in all hills covered with scrub. The Indian Bustard, Eupodotis edwardsi, is occasionally but rarely seen, and the Lesser Florican, Syphoetides auritus, is also extremely scarce. Of Plovers the Courier, Cursorius coromandelicus, is very common in the eastern sub-divisions, while Squatarola helvetica and Agialitis dubia the Gray and Indian Ringed Plover are rare. The Stone Plover, Edicnemus crepitans or indicus, also known as the Bastard Florican, is common throughout the district. The large Stone Plover, Scolopax recurvirostris, not noticed in Dr. Fairbank\u2019s List, is found on the banks of the Nira and probably of other large rivers in the cold months, usually in parties of three. The Demoiselle Crane, Anthropoides virgo, is the only common crane in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. From December to March they are found in vast flocks near the Nira, Krishna, and Yerla rivers and on the large reservoir at M\u00e1yni. They are wary birds and difficult to approach except when feeding in the early morning in kardai or safflower of which they are particularly fond. The Ph\u00e1nsi P\u00e1rdhis, to whose devices most birds fall an easy prey, are never able to entice the demoiselle crane into their nooses. They generally roost sitting in a long single line on a bare plain close to a river and guarded by sentinels on all sides. They seldom choose the same spot two nights running. Occasionally they feed at nights, especially during the early part of the cold weather when there are many cultivators in the fields by day. Their flight is remarkably strong, and they always call loudly on the wing. There are very few snipe grounds in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district though the Common Snipe, Gallinago scolopacinus and the Jack Snipe, Gallinago gallinula, as well as the Painted Snipe, Rhynchoea bengalensis, are occasionally found. The best chance of a bag is near the M\u00e1yni, Pingli, and Shingnapur reservoirs. The Bald Coot, Fulica atra, is found all over the district. The Whitenecked Stork, Dissura episcopa, is very common, and the Black Stork, Ciconia nigra, is found in the large rivers in the cold season. Most of the herons and egrets mentioned in Dr. Fairbank\u2019s List, except the Ashy Egret, Demi egretta gularis, are found in the district. It is worthy of note that Herodias garzetta, does not, as stated by Dr. Jerdon, lose its dorsal train in the cold weather, although the Large Egret, Herodias torra\nloses his. At the end of May the plume of the large egret is splendid, a good specimen usually having forty or more long plumes. The Cattle Egret, Bubulcus coromandus, and the Pond Heron, Ardeola grayi, are handsome birds in their breeding plumage, the pond heron with its deep maroon train being completely transformed and scarcely recognizable. Besides the above, the little Green Bittern Butorides javanica, is common in all the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra rivers. The Chestnut Bittern, Ardetta cinnamomea, is much rarer. The Pelican Ibis Platalea leucorodia, the Spoonbill Tantalus Leucocephalus, the White Ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus, and the Wartyheaded Ibis, Iconotis papillosus, are common in the larger S\u00e1t\u00e1ra rivers. The Shell Ibis, Anastomus oscitans, is a rarer bird. The Glossy Ibis, Falcinellus igneus omitted from Mr. Fairbank\u2019s List, is also frequently seen.\n\nNo geese visit the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. Of Ducks the Large Whistling Teal, Dendrocygna major, is found on the Nira. The Ruddy Shielddrake, Casarca rubila, also known as the Br\u00e1hmani Duck, M. s\u00e1raj, is common on the Nira and Krishna. Of Ducks proper, the Shoveller Spatula clypeata, the Gadwall Chaulelasmus streperus, the Widgeon Maroca penelope, the Common Teal Querquedula crocca, and the Blue-winged or Garganey Teal, Querquedula circia, are found scattered throughout S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in favourable localities.\n\nOf birds other than game birds the following may be noticed. The Scavenger Vulture, Neophron ginginianus, commonly called Pharao\u2019s Chicken, is common in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. A pair breed every year at Vita in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur producing a single egg. Of the Falcon class, the Perigrine and Shahin Falcon, Falco perigrinus and perigrinator are very rare; while the Redheaded Merlin or Turunti, Falco chiquera, is fairly common all over S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. A nest with three young eyesses has been found towards the end of February in a tamarind tree overhanging the Krishna. The young birds were kept for some time, but they were extremely vicious and wild and took the first opportunity to escape. A Hawk Eagle, Spir\u00e6tus cirrhatus was obtained in a large grove near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Of the Harriers, the Pale Harrier Circus mocrusus is the common variety. At Jath, a hundred or more of these birds have been seen roosting together on a bare plain. Haliastur indus, the Maroonbacked or Br\u00e1hmani Kite is decidedly uncommon. Syrnium sinense or Bulaca ocellata, the Mottled Wood Owl is the commonest of the large owls, and Athene brama, the pingli, is the commonest of the Owlets. Bubo bengalensis, the Rockhorned Owl, is also plentiful on all rivers. The hatred of crows to this, as indeed to all owls, is remarkable. A wounded owl may be followed for a mile or more, from tree to tree, entirely by the angry clamour of pursuing crows. The Hawk Owl, Ninox scutellatus, is not very uncommon along the banks of the larger S\u00e1t\u00e1ra streams. The Indian Roller, Coracias indicus, does not leave the district till late in the hot season. Several have been seen at the end of April. The Pied Kingfisher, Ceryle rudis, M. machhim\u00e1r or disa, is the commonest species in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and is a wonderfully familiar bird. It has been watched frequently at W\u00e1i diving fearlessly at the bathing steps among and within arm\u2019s reach of the bathers. Halcyon smyrnensis or fuscus, the Whitecrested Kingfisher is common throughout the district.\nThe Great Hornbill, *Dichoceros cavatus*, is occasionally seen in the Koyna valley and in the west of the district, but not in the plains. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra people have an odd belief that the common Roseringed Paroquets, *Palaeornis torquatus*, which build in holes in banyan or *pipal* trees, are better talkers than those which build in mango or any other trees. Of the Cuckoos the Koel, *Endynastes orientalis* or *honorata*, is very common. The people say that it never alights on the ground. They have an idea that its peculiar cry is a prayer for rain to fill the leaves with water, probably because the koel\u2019s note is much more frequent at the approach of the south-west rains than at other times. Mr. Fairbank has omitted from his list of Honeysuckers, *Cinnyris zeylonica*, the Amethyst-rumped Honeysucker (Jerdon, 232). This bird is not uncommon in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra gardens. A pair built their nest in September hanging to a slender twig of a creeper in the porch of one of the houses. Of the Muscicapidae or Flycatchers, *Muscipeta paradisi*, the Paradise Flycatcher is called by hill Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s *b\u00e1npakhree* or the arrow bird and by Europeans at Mah\u00e1baleshvar the *dhobi* or washermen\u2019s bird. It is found occasionally throughout the east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra wherever there is a grove of large trees. It is very wandering in its habits. Specimens have been obtained in a state of transition from the chestnut to the white plumage. The Redwhiskered Bulbul, *Otocompsa fascicaudata*, replaces on the Sahy\u00e1dris the common Madras Bulbul, *Pycnonotus hamorrhous*, which is found only in the plains, in the same way as the Bluewinged Rosyheaded Parrakeets replace the common Rosewinged species, *Palaeornis torquatus*. It is worthy of note that birds of several allied species differ in the hills and in the plains, and that the hill varieties are always brighter coloured than the plain birds. *Irena puella*, the Fairy Blue Bird, has not been found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. *Oriolus kundu*, the Indian Oriole, is found throughout the west of the district. The Blackheaded Oriole is rarely found to the east of the Sayh\u00e1dri range though both species appear equally distributed in the Koyna valley and in the western Sahy\u00e1dri belt. The Southern Yellow Tit, *Machlolophus jerdoni*, is found occasionally twenty miles or more east of the Sahy\u00e1dris.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPEOPLE.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census the population of the district was 1,062,350 or 212\u00b798 to the square mile. Of these Hindus numbered 1,024,597 or 96\u00b744 per cent; Musalm\u00e1ns 36,712 or 3\u00b745 per cent; Christians 886 or 0\u00b708 per cent; P\u00e1rsis 99; Sikhs 29; Jews 21; and Buddhists 6. The Buddhists were Chinese convicts now settled as gardeners at Mah\u00e1baleshwar. The percentage of males on the total population was 50\u00b712 and of females 49\u00b787. The corresponding returns for 1872 were a total of 1,062,121 or 221\u00b709 to the square mile, of whom Hindus numbered 1,026,110 or 96\u00b760 per cent; Musalm\u00e1ns 35,034 or 3\u00b729 per cent; Christians 880 or 0\u00b708 per cent; P\u00e1rsis 80; Sikhs 2; and Others 15. Compared with the 1872 returns the 1881 returns show an increase of 229 or 0\u00b702 per cent.\n\nOf 1,062,350 the whole population 1,018,931 or 95\u00b791 per cent were born in the district. Of the 43,419 who were not born in the district, 14,934 were born in the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak; 9558 in Kolhapur; 4686 in Poona; 4425 in the Konkan districts; 3998 in Sholapur; 1137 in Gujar\u00e1t; 760 in Bombay; 662 in the Rajputana States; 586 in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country; 445 in Ahmadnagar; 267 in Goa, Diu, and Daman; 215 in Madras; 125 in N\u00e1sik; 90 in Kh\u00e1ndesh; 862 in other parts of India; and 669 outside of India.\n\nOf 1,062,350 the total population, 1,005,499 (503,127 males, 502,372 females) or 94\u00b764 per cent spoke Mar\u00e1thi. Of the remaining 56,851 persons, 34,891 or 3\u00b728 per cent spoke Hindust\u00e1ni; 11,839 or 1\u00b711 per cent spoke K\u00e1narese; 4840 or 0\u00b745 per cent spoke Gujar\u00e1ti; 3552 or 0\u00b733 per cent spoke Telugu; 925 or 0\u00b708 per cent spoke M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri; 396 or 0\u00b703 per cent spoke English; 350 or 0\u00b703 per cent spoke Portuguese-Konkani or Goanese; 26 spoke Pashtu; 21 spoke Tamil; 3 spoke Arabic; 6 spoke Chinese; 1 spoke French; and 1 spoke Sindhi. Except in Jath where the people speak both K\u00e1narese and Mar\u00e1thi, and in T\u00e1sgaon where the home-talk of many people is K\u00e1narese, the language of the district is Mar\u00e1thi. The only classes who are considered to speak correct or book Mar\u00e1thi are the Br\u00e1hmans, Prabhus, and Shenvis. Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and low caste people especially Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs use many technical expressions and special words which are not known to those who speak book Mar\u00e1thi. Gujar\u00e1t\u00eds and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris use their own dialects though many of them also speak incorrect Mar\u00e1thi.\n\nThe following tabular statement gives the number of each religious class

per cent of the population.\n\nII.\u2014In House Service 6435 or 0\u00b760 per cent.\n\nIII.\u2014In Trade and Commerce 4349 or 0\u00b740 per cent.\n\nIV.\u2014In Agriculture 374,550 or 35\u00b729 per cent.\n\nV.\u2014In Crafts and Industries 55,009 or 6\u00b711 per cent.\n\nVI.\u2014In Indefinite and Unproductive Occupations including Children, 593,138 or 55\u00b783 per cent.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census, twelve towns had more than 5000 and four of the twelve more than 10,000 people. Excluding these twelve towns, which together numbered 115,638 or 9\u00b794 per cent of the population, the 946,712 inhabitants of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were distributed over 1331 villages, giving an average of one village for every 3\u00b774 square miles, and of 711\u00b727 people to each village. Of the 1331 villages 110 had less than 100 people, 179 between 100 and 200, 410 between 200 and 500, 331 between 500 and 1000, 224 between 1000 and 2000, 49 between 2000 and 3000, and 28 between 3000 and 5000.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census, of 174,406 houses, 151,173 were occupied and 23,233 were empty. The total gave an average of 34\u00b796 houses to the square mile, and the 151,173 occupied houses an average of 7\u00b702 inmates to each house. Though all do not succeed every man is anxious to own a house. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra houses may be arranged under two divisions, immovable and movable. The immovable houses may be divided into four classes: Those with tiled roofs and walls of fire-baked bricks; those with tiled or thatched roofs and walls of sun-burnt bricks or mud; those with thatched roofs and wattled or grass walls; and those with flat earth roofs and generally walls of unburnt brick. The movable dwellings belong to the wandering tribes who carry them with them. They are of two chief kinds small tents or p\u00e1ls either of coarse cotton or of wool and small huts of bamboo or date matting. The dwellers in tents and mat huts suffer much from the heat and cold and still more from the rain. To escape the wet many of them stop during the whole rains near some village and build small huts of grass, leaves, and branches. First class houses are seldom found\nexcept in towns and large villages. A first class house consists of one or two open squares surrounded by rooms or verandas and one or two storeys high. Of the two open squares the first is where the men live, and the back is set apart for women. The rooms in the inner square are used for sleeping, sitting, cooking, dining, and as store-rooms. The rooms in the outer square are generally used as sitting rooms. The front room in the ground floor and in the upper storey, if there is an upper storey, are used as guest halls. In front of some houses is a veranda where servants wait and behind are bathing rooms and cattle sheds. Buildings like these are owned only by inamdars or holders of public grants, jagirdars or land proprietors, and wealthy merchants. Almost all of them date from the times of Maratha rule. Houses of the second class, with tiled or thatched roofs and walls of fire-baked bricks, occur both in towns and in villages. The house consists of a front veranda and a central room with three or four other rooms, one of which is always set apart for cooking. If there is room in the veranda, the owner of the house makes it his office and place of business. As a rule the central room is used for dining and worshipping the house gods. Houses of this class have generally a cattle-shed either in front or behind them. Houses of the third class, with thatched roofs and wattled walls, are found chiefly in villages and in the hilly parts of the district inhabited by the poorer landholders and field labourers, and by the depressed or impure castes. The inside of a wattled hut is generally divided into two or three spaces by bamboo matting or by branches. Except when the number of the cattle is small and part of the house can be given to them, the poorer husbandman's cattle live in sheds or pens separate from the dwelling. The fourth class of flat earth-roofed houses called dhabis, are chiefly found in the east of the district. Owing to the weight of the earth roof they seldom have an upper storey.\n\nThe home of a well-to-do family is generally well stocked with brass and copper vessels, wooden boxes and tools, and bedding. If he is a high caste man he has silver drinking vessels and plates, articles of worship, and a pansupari or betel set including stands for attar of roses and other fragrant oils. He generally uses the silver ware on special occasions, such as marriage and other great days. For daily use he has copper and brass vessels and plates enough to meet his daily wants, he has also a set of big vessels enough to hold food for about two hundred persons. The ordinary wooden furniture in a rich Hindu house includes cots, boxes, and stools. Of late chairs tables and cupboards have begun to be introduced. The elders prefer carpets, cushions, and quilted cloths to chairs and tables and metal pots to glassware. The furniture of a middle class family is the same as that of a rich family but is only enough for the use of the family. He may own a few spare dishes but not enough to lend to others or to use in giving a caste feast. The houses of the poorer landholders and field workers have few metal vessels, sometimes none except a drinking waterpot and a ladle. They cook in clay pots and use earthenware for all house purposes. The chief articles in the husbandman's house are his field tools. Besides tools the house gear if put to sale would seldom fetch more than \u00a31 (Rs.10).\nThe daily food in a rich Hindu family includes rice, wheat, millet, pulse, vegetables, clarified butter, pepper, salt, and oil, and, in families to whom flesh-eating is lawful, fish, mutton, fowls, and eggs. The special dishes prepared in rich families are wheat cakes or puris, cakes stuffed with gram pulse and sugar called polis, gram balls called kalis or bundis, wheat balls or churm\u00e1s, rice balls or modaks, sweet rice or keshri bh\u00e1t, and curdled milk or shrikhand. The every-day food of a middle class family includes millet or rice, butter, pepper, salt, and oil. Their special dishes are nearly the same as those of the rich but inferior in quality. Those to whom they are lawful occasionally use fish and flesh. The daily food of the lower classes includes millet, Indian millet, r\u00e1la Panicum italicum, vegetables, pepper, and salt, and they occasionally use rice, fish, and flesh. Rich and middle class families lay in a stock of the chief grains at the harvest time of each grain. Those who drink liquor also generally keep some in store. Dried fish comes from Goa, Vengurla, and Harnai by Chiplun. The supply of salt is from Bombay or Chiplun. Except in rich and middle class families who employ cooks the cooking is generally done by the women of the family. Even in well-to-do families the women of the house not only superintend the cooking but themselves prepare dishes which require special skill or little labour.\n\nThe style of dress of almost all S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Hindus is much the same. The differences are chiefly in material due to difference in wealth. A rich man's indoor dress includes a waistcloth and a shoulder-cloth, when he goes out he adds a waistcoat, a coat, a turban or headscarf, and shoes. If the home waistcloth is short, he puts on a larger and costlier one with or without a silk border. His wife's indoor and outdoor dress is a coloured robe and bodice, and she is careful to rub her brow with redpowder. The festive dress both of men and women is the same as their every-day dress only of finer or richer material. Women in full dress, sometimes in addition to the robe and bodice draw a shawl over the head. Widows, as a rule, do not wear the bodice, or a robe of any colour but red or white. The wearing of black is forbidden to widows. A boy in a rich family before he is girt with the thread dresses in a coat, a cap, and a pair of trousers. The wearing of caps is a fashion which has lately come from Bombay. His show dress is a rich pair of trousers, a silk or broadcloth coat, and a fine lace-bordered cap. After he is girt with the sacred thread, a boy, like his father, dresses in a coat, waistcoat, turban, and waistcloth. Up to three years old the dress of a rich man's daughter is the same as her brother's dress. After three she generally wears a bodice and petticoat and sometimes a robe. She wears the petticoat till her marriage and then dresses like her mother. Middle class men and women wear clothes of the same form as those worn by the rich but of cheaper quality. Among labourers and poor landholders the men wear a loincloth or a pair of short coarse cotton breeches, a waistcoat of the same material, a woollen blanket, and a long narrow headscarf. They sometimes put on trousers and long coats. On special occasions they wear a waistcloth, a white or coloured waistcoat, and a turban, and a second shorter waistcloth wound round the hips. The women dress in the robe and bodice. Mar\u00e1tha\nand Kunbi women differ from Br\u00e1hman and V\u00e1ni women in not passing the skirt of the robe back between the feet. They are also, except on high days, much less careful to rub their brows with redpowder. At home the children of the poor, both boys and girls, wear no clothes till they are six or seven. After that a boy wears a loincloth and a girl a piece of cloth wrapt round the waist. After their marriage girls dress like their mothers and boys after eleven or twelve like their fathers.\n\nThe internal constitution of all villages whether Government or alienated is the same. Each village has a headman called p\u00e1t\u00edl, and in almost every case the office is hereditary and is held by a Mar\u00e1tha or a Kunbi. In some hilly parts of the district Mh\u00e1r p\u00e1t\u00edls are found, while in other parts the headmen are occasionally Gavlis, Dhangars, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, or Musalm\u00e1ns. Under the Mar\u00e1tha government the headman was responsible for the village revenues, and, on pain of being turned out of office, was frequently required to make good any deficiency in the collections from his own pocket or as he best could. He was also the head of the police. This system has so far been preserved that the revenue is still paid to Government through the headman, but he is no longer called on to make good deficiencies caused by the default of other villagers. It was the boast of Captain Grant Duff in the changes introduced in 1822 into the management of the state that he kept in its vigour the police influence of the p\u00e1t\u00edl, and Government have since continued the p\u00e1t\u00edl both as revenue and as police head. In many villages the hereditary right belongs to the heads of several branches of the same family, who may serve either in turns or at the same time. If the heads of more than one branch serve at the same time the police and revenue duties are usually performed by different persons. Under the old system, when the amount of each landholder's revenue payment was settled by the village community, the influence of the p\u00e1t\u00edl was more powerful than it is at present, and natives acquainted with the district agree in stating that the constant interference of superior authority has further diminished the headman's power. At the same time hereditary claims to serve are more rigidly respected under the British than under the Mar\u00e1tha government which often chose as officiator, the most powerful member of the p\u00e1t\u00edl's family whether he was the lineal head or not. The lands and allowances were hardly less secure than at present. Village headmen were formerly paid by assignments of land with or without a small additional allowance. In Government villages they now pay the full assessment on their land, and are paid on a fixed scale proportioned to the revenue they collect. In their police capacity p\u00e1t\u00edls have power to lock in the village office or ch\u00e1vdi persons committing petty assault or abuse within village limits, and in some cases they are empowered to punish the committing of petty nuisances. It is also the p\u00e1t\u00edl's duty to hold inquests and aid in the prevention and detection of crime. In civil disputes his power is chiefly confined to influence, but here and there civil functions have\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C. S.\nbeen revived by his appointment as village *munsif* under the Deccan Agriculturists' Act. When rich he lends money on much the same terms as other creditors. His hospitality and the amount of lead he takes on social occasions vary greatly with his means and character. In many villages, owing to his ignorance of letters, the headman is almost wholly in the hands of the accountant.\n\nLike the headman the village accountant or *kulkarni* is in almost every case an hereditary officer, the right of service running in families and the officiator being paid in the same way as among *p\u0101t\u012bls*. It is the accountant's duty to do all the writing work of the village, and, as the headman can rarely read or write, the accountant is as often as not the more powerful of the two. It is he or some member of his family who usually does most of the petition writing for the village, and in consequence most *kulkarnis* have a richly deserved bad name for stirring strife. It often happens that a *kulkarni* has more than one village under his charge, and still oftener that a family has the hereditary right to serve in a group of villages and to depute different members to serve in rotation. The *chaugula* or assistant headman acts as the *p\u0101til*'s and accountant's office-keeper. He has charge of the village office and of the writing materials and usually carries the records when they are taken out of the village. The other village servants are the village astrologer or Joshi and the family priest or Bhat, the priest of the village god or Gurav, the potter or Kumbh\u00e1r, the barber or Nh\u00e1vi, the carpenter or Sut\u00e1r, the blacksmith or Loh\u00e1r, the tailor or Shimpi, the shoemaker or Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r, the washerman or Parit, the tanner or Dhor, the watchman or Rakhv\u00e1ld\u00e1r, the guide and messenger or Mh\u00e1r, and the sweeper or M\u00e1ng. Br\u00e1hmans are most often both astrologers and family priests and frequently belong to the *kulkarni*'s family. Though they hold land both in return for acting as astrologers and as family priests they often do little as astrologers as those duties are generally conducted by a few specialists. Still most village Br\u00e1hmans can fix a lucky day for a marriage though they may not be able to cast a nativity. The family priest conducts marriages funerals and other family rites. He holds land from Government at a reduced assessment and receives money and grain allowances from the villagers. The patron god or guardian of the village is generally served by an hereditary priest, who is usually not a Br\u00e1hman but a Gurav. Other gods who have temples in the villages are usually served by special Br\u00e1hman ministrants called *puj\u0101ris*. The blacksmith, carpenter, tailor, shoemaker, tanner, and barber work for the villagers, who generally reward their services by yearly payments of grain. They also hold Government quit-rent land. The watchmen are usually R\u00e1moshis or M\u00e1ngs, who, though as often as not professional thieves, are fairly trustworthy when on duty. Under the Mar\u00e1tha government the watchmen used to be obliged to make good any stolen property which they failed to recover, and even now the villagers sometimes manage to extort compensation from them. They are paid partly in cash partly by rent-free lands and officiate in turns. Though not always trustworthy they sometimes prove valuable detectives. The Mh\u00e1r acts as a guide to travellers and as a Government messenger, and generally carries the revenue collec-\n\nB 1282\u20137\ntions to the sub-divisional treasury with or without the escort of the headman. He is also the general porter and boundary shower. He has a right to the carcasses of dead cattle, though M\u00e1ngs often dispute the right to the skins. The Mh\u00e1r holds Government land at a quit-rent. M\u00e1ngs generally act as scavengers and watchmen. They are often strolling acrobats and are generally professional thieves. Of special servants may be mentioned the Son\u00e1r or goldsmith who also acts as assayer. He is seldom found except in large villages when he sometimes holds the office of accountant. There are also the Gos\u00e1vi or ascetic and the non-Br\u00e1hman ministrant or puj\u00e1ri as mentioned above. The n\u00e1ikavdi or the hereditary village surveyor is met with and his services are occasionally called for. He was formerly an important servant when the assessment was fixed by yearly appraisement.\n\nIn nearly all villages will be found Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s or Kunbis and Mh\u00e1rs, and in a majority M\u00e1ngs also; R\u00e1moshis are rarer. The other castes are found in proportion to the size of the village. Such a thing as an exclusively Br\u00e1hman village, is believed not to occur in the district. The village grazing land is shared in common, and all but the impure castes may use the village well.\n\nThe scanty records of the period before the beginning of British rule furnish hardly any information regarding the movements of the people. It is probable that large numbers emigrated during the famine of 1792, which was occasioned by the scanty fall of rain and the political troubles of the time. The famine of 1803-04 is expressly stated to have been chiefly due to shoals of immigrants from the Northern Deccan where the failure of the late rains of 1803 was more complete than in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. No fewer than 25,000 strangers are said to have flocked into the town of W\u00e1i. In the famine of 1824 people are said to have emigrated both towards Ahmadnagar and Kolh\u00e1pur. In the recent severe famine of 1876-77 large numbers, both of the Kunbi and of the lower castes, went to Bombay and to the Berars. This movement was only the development, under a passing emergency, of a custom which for years has existed in the east of the district among the labouring classes, who rarely find local work either in the hot weather or in the early rains. Since the great development of trade and demand for labour in Bombay this movement in many cases has become yearly.\u00b9 The hill men of the west, whose means of existence are often at least as precarious as in the east, to a smaller extent avail themselves of the Bombay labour market. They are afraid of staying long from home and generally prefer work close to their homes. In such cases, where the emigrant owns land, some one always remains behind to look after it, otherwise, as often as not, entire families move. Except earth and stone workers of the Vad\u00e1r tribe, religious beggars, and strol-\n\n\u00b9 The 1881 census shows that 108,243 people born in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were in that year found in different parts of the Bombay Presidency. The details are, Bombay City 45,404, Poona 22,232, Shol\u00e1pur 12,365, Th\u00e1na 6936, Belgaum 4403, Bij\u00e1pr 3612, Kol\u00e1ba 3077, Ratn\u00e1giri 2905, Ahmadnagar 2348, Kh\u00e1ndesh 1856, N\u00e1sik 1274, Dh\u00e1rwar 633, Surat 349, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d 279, K\u00e1nara 189, Broach 165, Aden 107, Panch Mah\u00e1lis 59, and Kaira 50.\nling jugglers, musicians, and acrobats, there are few wandering tribes or travelling carriers in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\n**Brahmans** include sixteen divisions with a strength of 48,362 or 4\u00b77 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division       | Males | Females | Total |\n|----------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Dushasths      | 17,652| 16,409  | 34,061|\n| Devrukhas      | 88    | 84      | 172   |\n| Dr\u00e1vids        | 68    | 65      | 133   |\n| Gonds          | 490   | 394     | 884   |\n| Guj\u00e1ratis      | 126   | 9       | 135   |\n| Kanaujs        | 89    | 75      | 164   |\n| K\u00e1nvars        | 23    | 19      | 42    |\n| Karh\u00e1d\u00e1s       | 1444  | 1393    | 2837  |\n| K\u00e1sts          | 12    | 6       | 18    |\n| **Total**      | **25,030** | **23,332** | **48,362** |\n\nDeshasths are returned as numbering 34,061 and as found in almost every village. The name probably means local or original rather than Br\u00e1hmans of the Deccan plain as opposed to Br\u00e1hmans of the hilly Konkan. Of their origin or of their arrival in the country they have no tradition. They are divided into Rigvedis and Yajurvedis who eat together but do not intermarry. There are also two other subdivisions, the M\u00e1dhyandins and the \u00c1tharvans, the M\u00e1dhyandins being the followers of a branch of the Yajurved and the \u00c1tharvans of the Atharv, the fourth of the four Veds. \u00c1tharvans are mostly found in the east of the district and M\u00e1dhyandins scattered all over the district. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Deshasths are rather dark, but there is little difference in make or appearance between them and other local Br\u00e1hmans. They are neither hardworking nor enterprising, rather dirty in their habits, idle, and untidy, but good-tempered, hospitable, and generous. Almost all are hereditary priests or village accountants; most of the rest are in the service of Government as clerks and schoolmasters. Several Br\u00e1hmans of hereditary priest or village accountant families trade in grain or cloth or keep moneychanger's shops and more make their living as cultivators. Like other Br\u00e1hmans they have the custom, when a girl comes of age or is pregnant, of leading her through the streets in procession accompanied by women relations and friends and music. In the month of Bh\u00e1drapad or August-September, for luck, married women tie yellow threads round their necks. At the end of every family rejoicing, a birth, a thread-girding, or a marriage, they hire men to perform the gondhal dance. Their customs differ little from those of the Chitp\u00e1van Br\u00e1hmans given in the Poona Statistical Account. They send their boys to school and are well off enjoying quit-rent lands or \u00edn\u00e1ms and yearly grants or varsh\u00e1sans either from Government or from the chiefs.\n\nDevrukha's, from the Ratn\u00e1giri village of Devrukh, are returned as numbering 172 and as found over the whole district except in J\u00e1vli, M\u00e1n, T\u00e1sgaon, and Valva. Like Konkanaths or Chitp\u00e1vans\n\n---\n\n1 A large share of the Hindu caste details is compiled from materials supplied by R\u00e1v Bah\u00e1dur B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Gang\u00e1dhar S\u00e1the, District Deputy Collector.\nthey have come from the Konkan. They are somewhat darker than Konkanasths, hardworking, and orderly. They speak Mar\u00e1thi, and, except a few moneylenders and Government servants, are landholders. They send their boys to school and are well-to-do.\n\nDr\u00e1vid Bra/hmans are returned as numbering 133 and as found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, P\u00e9tan, and T\u00e1sgaon. They are said to have come from the Tamil districts of Madras during the Peshwa's supremacy (1714-1818). They are divided into Ayang\u00e1rs and Kurkals, and the names of their two chief family stocks are Vishv\u00e1mitra and Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1j. Persons bearing the same family name eat together but do not intermarry. The names in common use among men are Gop\u00e1l, R\u00e1mchandra, Vyankatesh, and \u00c1pa, and among women Min\u00e1kshi, P\u00e1rvati, and Lakshmi. They are rather dark-skinned and shave the face including the moustache. Their women tattoo their brows to the corners of their eyes. They speak Tamil at home and Mar\u00e1thi abroad. They live in houses of the better sort one or two storeys high with walls of brick or stone and tiled roofs. They keep servants and own cattle. They are vegetarians and dress like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. Their women plait their hair into braids, use false hair, and deck their heads with flowers. They wear the full Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, but give the bodice up as soon as they become mothers. Their ornaments are the same as those worn by Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. They are orderly, hardworking, hospitable, and frugal. They have a considerable knowledge of the Veds and other Br\u00e1hmans consider them of pure descent. Their name is connected with the temple of Yeoleshv\u00e1r near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, which is richly endowed with donations by the R\u00e9j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and is entirely managed by Dr\u00e1vid Br\u00e1hmans. Besides living as begging Br\u00e1hmans or bhikshuks they have taken to trade and husbandry. They are a religious people and are Shaivs by faith. They worship the ordinary Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses. They go on pilgrimage to Benares and R\u00e1meshv\u00e1r, and their priests are their own Br\u00e1hmans. They believe in witchcraft and spirit possession and consult oracles. Their sacraments or sansk\u00e1rs are nearly the same as those of Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans. They send their boys to school and are in easy circumstances.\n\nGolaks, also called Govardhans, are returned as numbering 874 and as found over the whole district except in P\u00e9tan, M\u00e1n, and V\u00e1lva. They are divided into Rand and Kund Golaks, the Rands being said to be the issue of a Br\u00e1hman and a Br\u00e1hman widow, and the Kunds the offspring of Br\u00e1hman parents in adultery. They hold a low place among Br\u00e1hmans, other Br\u00e1hmans neither eating nor marrying with them. They look and speak like Deshasths, and do not differ from Deshasths in house, food, or dress. They are hardworking, frugal, quiet, and orderly. They are husbandmen, moneychangers and lenders, astrologers and priests to Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and other middle and low class Hindas. They worship the ordinary Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses and keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts. Their priests belong to their own caste, and they settle social disputes at meetings of their castemen. They send their boys to school and are a steady class.\nGujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans are returned as numbering 135 and as found over the whole district except in J\u00e1vli, M\u00e1n, and Khat\u00e1v. They are strict vegetarians and do not eat food cooked by Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, who in turn refuse to eat though they take water from Gujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans. The men dress like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans in the waistcloth, coat, turban, shouldercloth, and shoes. The women wear the petticoat, the open-backed bodice, and the robe falling from the hips without passing the skirt back between the feet. They are thrifty, hardworking, and hospitable, and either beg and officiate as priests at the houses of Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis or serve as writers. They are not settled in the district but return to Gujar\u00e1t when they have put together some money. On the whole they are a steady class and free from debt.\n\nKanaujs are returned as numbering 164 and as found over the whole district except in P\u00e1tan. They are strongly made people and speak Hindust\u00e1ni. They are vegetarians and great eaters. The men usually wear a waistcloth, a coat, a shouldercloth, a head-scarf, and shoes, and the women a petticoat, robe, and backless bodice. They plait their hair in braids which they draw back and tie together at the back of the neck. They are clean, hardworking, and honest, being trusted soldiers and messengers. They act as priests to the local Pardeshi or Upper Indian castes. They are a religious people always bathing before they dine. They believe in witchcraft, sorcery, soothsaying, omens, and lucky and unlucky days, and consult oracles. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen. They send their boys to school and are a steady people.\n\nKa'nv Br\u00e1hmans are returned as numbering forty-two and as found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, V\u00e1lva, Kar\u00e1d, W\u00e1i, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and Koregaon. They are dark and dirty. They are vegetarians and live and dress like Deshashths. They are beggars, cooks, water-carriers, and a few are in the service of Government. They are Yajurvedis, worship all Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, keep the usual fasts and festivals, and go on pilgrimage to Pandharpur, Tulj\u00e1pur, Benares, and Pray\u00e1g or Allahabad. They believe in spirits and witches and have the same manners and customs as Deshashths. They do not allow widow marriage. They are bound together as a body and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school, and are a poor people.\n\nKarha'da's are returned as numbering 2837 and as found over the whole district. They apparently take their name from the town of Kar\u00e1d at the holy meeting of the Krishna and Koyna, and probably represent one of the early Br\u00e1hman settlers who took up his abode at this holy spot. According to the Sahy\u00e1dri Khand the Karh\u00e1d\u00e1s are descended from asses' or camels' bones which a magician formed into a man and endowed with life. This story is apparently an ill-natured play on the words kar an ass and h\u00e1d a bone. They are fair, intelligent, and short-tempered. They are priests, pleaders, landholders, moneychangers, and Government servants. Their manners and customs differ little from those of the Deshashths with whom and the Konkanasths they eat, and\noccasionally, but not generally, marry. Their household goddess is Durg\u0101devi to whom apparently they formerly offered human sacrifices. The victim was generally a stranger, but the most pleasing victim was said to be a son-in-law. The death was caused by cutting the victim's throat or by poisoning him. They send their boys to school and are well-to-do.\n\nKa\u015bts are returned as numbering eighteen and as found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and P\u00e1tan. They have no subdivisions, speak Marathi, and look like Deshasth Br\u0101hmans. They neither eat flesh nor drink liquor. They dress like Deshasths, and are hardworking, quiet, and orderly. They are husbandmen, traders, and Government servants. They call themselves Br\u0101hmans, but are not allowed to join with Br\u0101hmans in any ceremony. They are considered half-Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and half-Br\u0101hmans, and strict Deshasth and Konkanasth Br\u0101hmans hold their touch unclean. They are a religious people, worship the usual Br\u0101hmanic gods and goddesses, and believe in spirits and witchcraft. Their priests belong to their own class, and they make pilgrimages to Benares, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur. They send their boys to school and are well-to-do.\n\nKonkanasths or Chitp\u00e1vans are returned as numbering 8359 and as found all over the district. As their name shows they have come to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from the Konkan where their original seat seems to have been Chiplun or Chit\u00e1polan, a form which seems the probable origin of their other name Chitp\u00e1van. According to the Sahy\u00e1dri Khand the Chitp\u00e1vans are sprung from the shipwrecked bodies of foreigners which Parashur\u00e1m, the destroyer of the Kshatriyas, raised to life. Probably most Konkanasths settled in the district during the sway of the Konkanasth Peshw\u00e1s (1714-1818). They are divided into Rigvedis, \u00c1shval\u00e1yans, and \u00c1pastambhs or Hiranyakeshis who dine together and intermarry. They are fair with fine features, often gray eyes, and generally delicate frames. They speak Mar\u00e1thi and generally live in substantial houses with mud or tiled roofs. The men wear a waistcloth, turban, coat, waistcoat, shouldercloth, and shoes, and the women the full Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. Children of both sexes go naked till they are five or six years old, and after that a boy wears a loincloth, and a girl a gown. They are vegetarians and their staple food is rice, millet, pulse, vegetables, and butter. They are intelligent, enterprising, hardworking, even-tempered, and hospitable, but exceedingly cunning and thrifty, always living within their income. They live by priestcraft, the law, and Government service. Some are moneylenders, shopkeepers, and cultivators. They worship Jotiba, Khandoba, Mhasoba, and Satv\u00e1i, but their chief deities are Shiv, Vishnu, Ganpati, Vithoba, and Devi. According to the deities they hold in chief estimation they are classed as Shaivs, Vaishnavs, G\u00e1npatyas, and Sh\u00e1kts. Konkanasths have generally goddesses or Devis as their household deities and in their honour hold a yearly gondhal dance. They keep all Hindu fasts and festivals, and in almost every family is a priest called up\u00e1dhya or purohit who officiates at their houses. The Chitp\u00e1vans are noticeable among Western India Br\u0101hmans for\n\n---\n\n1 Sir John Malcolm, 1799 (Transactions Literary Society, Bombay (New Edition), III. 93-95.

S3.\nthe extent to which the younger men have given up their old beliefs and passed under the influence of certain European ideas. They send their boys to school and are in easy circumstances.\n\nMa'rw\u0101'r Br\u0101hmans are returned as numbering sixty-five and as found in J\u00e1vli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and T\u00e1sgaon. They speak M\u00e1rw\u0101r\u012b. The men wear the top-knot, moustache, whiskers, and beard. They generally live in hired houses and are strict vegetarians, and among vegetables refuse onions, garlic, radishes, carrots, and other root plants. They do not eat or drink from Gujar\u00e1t or Mar\u00e1tha Br\u0101hmans. The men dress in a small tightly rolled M\u00e1rw\u0101r\u012b turban, a long fine tight coat, a waistcloth, and shoes; and the women in a petticoat, an open-backed bodice, and a short upper robe which they use as a veil. They are extremely grasping and thrifty, but are quiet, orderly, and hospitable. They officiate as priests to their countrymen, and beg. They are not settled in the district and return to M\u00e1rw\u00e1r when they have made some money. They hold caste councils, send their boys to school, and are a steady class.\n\nPalsha's, said by their rivals the Konkanasths to be Pal\u00e1shin or Flesh-eaters but apparently from Palsavli village in Kaly\u00e1n, are returned as numbering fifty-three and as found in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Koregaon, and P\u00e9tan. They have no subdivisions and are generally fair and middle-sized. Their home speech is Mar\u00e1thi. They are hardworking, frugal, hospitable, and orderly, and earn their living as priests, astrologers, physicians, and beggars. They are vegetarians and live in middle class houses. The men dress like Deshasths in a waistcloth, coat, waistcoat, turban, and shoes. The women wear the full Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, and deck their heads with flowers. They worship the usual Br\u0101hmanic gods and goddesses, keep the regular fasts and feasts, and belong to the V\u00e1jasaney\u0101 Madhyandin branch of the Yajurved. Their family priests belong to their own caste and they go on pilgrimages to Benares, Pandharpur, Pray\u00e1g, and Oudh. They hold caste councils and settle social disputes at meetings of castemen. They send their boys to school and are a steady class.\n\nSava'sha's are returned as numbering 187 and as found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, V\u00e1lva, T\u00e1sgaon, Koregaon, and Kar\u00e1d. The story of their origin is that a Br\u0101hman, who married a Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r girl and was put out of caste, built a house with one hundred and twenty-five rooms and asked 125 Br\u0101hmans to dine at his house, holding out to each the promise of a handsome gift and secrecy. The guests one by one came and were feasted each in a separate room. When they had done their meal all met, and when the rest of the caste heard of what had happened they were turned out. Their women are generally handsome, and the men intelligent and hardworking. They are moneylenders and changers. Their customs are like those of other Br\u0101hmans, and their religious head is Madhav\u00e1ch\u00e1rya. They send their boys to school and are well off.\n\n---\n\n1 A detailed account of Chitp\u00e1van Br\u0101hmans is given in the Poona Statistical Account.\n2 Details are given in the Th\u00e1na Statistical Account where reasons are shewn for believing them to be of Gujar\u00e1t origin.\nShenvis are returned as numbering 875 and as found over the whole district except in Wai. They are considered to be one of the five Gaud or northern sects of Br\u0101hmans and to have come from Northern India. They came to the district from the Konkan during the time of the first three Mar\u0101tha kings (1664-1700) under whom and the Peshwas they held many important posts. They are fair, of middle height, orderly, intelligent, and hardworking. They are husbandmen and Government servants. Their family gods are Mangesh, Narsinh, and Sh\u00e1nta Durga. The religious ceremonies or kuldharm in honour of Mangesh and Narsinh are held on the Mondays of Shr\u0101vam or July-August, and those in honour of Sh\u00e1nta Durga on the fifth of the same month. On each of these occasions a man and his wife are feasted and presented with money gifts or dakshin\u00e1s. Their other ceremonies are like those of Deshashth Br\u0101hmans. Their social disputes are settled at meetings of the castemen, and intricate questions are referred to \u0100tmanand Sarasvati Sv\u0101mi their high priest whose head-quarters are at Kavla in Goa. They send their boys to school and are generally well off.\n\nTelangs are returned as numbering sixty-eight and as found over the whole district except in Kh\u00e1napur, M\u00e1n, P\u00e1tan, and T\u00e1sgaon. They only occasionally visit the district, living either by begging or by the sale of sacred threads. They are very dark and have a name for cleverness and deep knowledge of the Veds. Among themselves they speak Telugu, and with others an extremely incorrect Mar\u0101thi. They do not own houses, and are great eaters especially of sour dishes. Both men and women dress like Mar\u0101tha Br\u0101hmans. They are a religious people worshipping the usual Br\u0101hmanic gods and goddesses. They hold caste councils and settle social disputes at meetings of their castemen and of Mar\u0101tha Br\u0101hmans. They send their boys to school and are a poor people.\n\nTirguls are returned as numbering 319 and as found over the whole district except in Javli and M\u00e1n. They are said to be the issue of a Shudra father and a Br\u0101hman mother. They are considered low not only on account of their supposed origin, but because they grow and deal in betel leaves in rearing which they have to kill small insects. Other Br\u0101hmans do not eat or marry with them. They keep all Br\u0101hman rites and ceremonies, and like Br\u0101hmans wear the sacred thread. They are either Sm\u00e1rts or Bh\u00e1gvats, worship the usual Br\u0101hmanic gods and goddesses, and keep the ordinary Hindu fasts and festivals. They believe in witches and spirits and consult oracles. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen. They keep their boys at school till they can read and write. They are generally poor.\n\nWriters include two classes with a strength of 536. The details are:\n\n| Division          | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| K\u00e1yasth Prabhus   | 138   | 152     | 290   |\n| Pit\u00e1ne Prabhus    | 44    | 152     | 196   |\n| Total             | 232   | 304     | 536   |\nKa'yasth Prabhus are returned as numbering 340 and as found over the whole district except in P\u00e1tan. They have no subdivisions and look like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. They are generally fair, middle-sized, and regular featured. The men keep the topknot and moustache, but not the beard or whiskers, and the women wear the hair tied in a knot behind the head and deck their heads with flowers. Both men and women dress and speak like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, and, unlike them, eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They are neat, clean, hardworking, faithful, and loyal. They are writers and accountants and regard clerkship as their birthright. They worship the usual Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, and observe all their fasts and feasts. Their priests are Deshashth Br\u00e1hmans whom they pay great respect. They settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen, send their boys to school, and are a steady class.\n\nPa'ta'ne Prabhus are returned as numbering 196 and as found in all subdivisions except Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Koregaon, M\u00e1n, and T\u00e1sgaon. They have lately come from their homes in Bombay and Th\u00e1na in search of work, and are not residents but return to their homes to marry their children. They are clerks and writers in Government service and are well-to-do. Their social and religious customs are the same as those of the Th\u00e1na P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Prabhus, and they do not differ from their Th\u00e1na brethren in look, food, dress, or character.\n\nTraders include seven classes with a strength of 39,638 or 3\u00b786 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division          | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis     | 106   | 78      | 179   |\n| Jains             | 7728  | 7115    | 14,853|\n| Kom\u00eds             | 88    | 71      | 159   |\n| Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis    | 8711  | 8544    | 17,255|\n| Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1nis     | 1615  | 1628    | 3243  |\n| M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis      | 132   | 93      | 225   |\n| T\u00e1bolis           | 1344  | 1330    | 2674  |\n| **Total**         | **19,784** | **18,354** | **38,638** |\n\nGujara't Va'nis are returned as numbering 179 and as found over the whole district. They have castemen in the Konkan from whom they choose brides and bridegrooms and few go to Gujar\u00e1t to perform a marriage. They are generally fair, and their home speech is Gujar\u00e1ti. They are vegetarians, abstaining from fish flesh and liquor. Except rich townsmen who live in two-storeyed brick-built houses, they generally live in one-storeyed houses. They are clean, even-tempered, hardworking, and less exacting and more popular than M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, but they are wanting in vigour and enterprise. They are traders, grocers, moneylenders, grain and cloth dealers, and sellers of butter, oil, and other miscellaneous articles. They are all Valabhi Vaishnavs that is followers of Valabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya. Audich and other Gujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmans generally officiate at the\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\nhouses of all Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis. In their absence Konkanasth and Deshashth Br\u00e1hmans conduct their marriage, funeral, and other ceremonies. They do not allow widow marriage and practise polygamy, but not polyandry. Except unmarried children they burn their dead. All their social disputes are settled at caste meetings by the castemen. They send their boys to school, and are generally well-to-do.\n\nJains,\u00b9 or followers of Jin the Victorious, also called Shr\u00e1vaks that is hearers, are returned as numbering 14,853. They form an important part of the population in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, T\u00e1sgaon, V\u00e1lva, and other sub-divisions. They owe their influence to their landed interest, their industrious habits, and their regard for every variety of animal life. In appearance and dress Jains can scarcely be known from Kunbi landholders, and except a few who speak K\u00e1narese, both at home and abroad they speak Mar\u00e1thi. They are the hardest-working husbandmen in the district, making good use of every advantage of soil or situation. Except the well-to-do who employ labourers, the Jains, with the help of their women, perform every part of field work. At the same time tillage is a calling not recommended by their religion, as animal life consciously or unconsciously must be destroyed. On this account cultivating Jains formed a distinct class with a high priest of their own, who lives at Nandin, a village four miles from \u00dankli in T\u00e1sgaon. Though strict Jains disapprove of cultivators, they do not carry their objections to the length of refusing to dine with them. The Jains, being mostly tillers of the soil, do not take much interest in sending their boys to school. They are a well-to-do class.\n\nKomtis\u00b2 are returned as numbering 159 and as found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, J\u00e1vli, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, P\u00e1tan, and T\u00e1sgaon. They are natives of Telangan or the Telugu country, but they cannot tell when they came to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They have no history and no subdivisions. Their surnames are Utukh\u00e1r, Keshavkh\u00e1r, Pol\u00e1v\u00e1r, Chintalv\u00e1r, and Bachuv\u00e1r. The names in common use among men are Poshatti, Shivaya, R\u00e1maya, Krishnaya, and R\u00e1jaya; and among women Ganga, Shivb\u00e1i, Bh\u00e1gub\u00e1i, and Janshb\u00e1i. They are dark, middle-sized, and spare, and their home-speech is Telugu. They own houses one or two storeys high and keep them neat and clean. They are vegetarians and their staple food is millet, rice, and vegetables. They are temperate in eating, good cooks, and fond of sour and pungent dishes. They drink a liquid preparation of hemp flowers, but not liquor, and smoke tobacco, hemp, and opium. The men dress like Br\u00e1hmans in a waistloth, coat, turban, shouldercloth, and shoes, and the women in a robe and bodice. The women wear false hair and tie their\n\n\u00b9 Jain details are given in the Kolhapur Statistical Account.\n\u00b2 As in N\u00e1sik (Bombay Gazetteer, XVI. 59) the word Komti is used in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra of two distinct classes, a class of shopkeepers and a tribe of wandering beggars and charm-sellers. The application of the same name to two distinct classes suggests that the name is a place or district name. It seems possible that Komti is a shortened form of Komomethi, properly Kammametti, from the district Kammammett in the Niz\u00e1m's country. K\u00e1m\u00e1thi like Komti is applied to more than one distinct class, and it seems possible that like Komti K\u00e1m\u00e1thi comes from Kammametti.\nhair in a knot at the back of the head. They wear glass bangles and their ornaments are the same as those of Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans. They are a mild, honest, orderly, and hardworking people. Most of them are grocers, dealing in spices, salt, grain, butter, oil, molasses, and sugar. Their customs from birth to death are the same as those of the Shol\u00e1pur Komtis.\\(^1\\) They are bound together by a strong caste feeling and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school for a short time and are a poor people.\n\n**Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis**\\(^2\\) are returned as numbering 17,255 and are found in all parts of the district, especially in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, T\u00e1sgaon, and V\u00e1lva on the borders of the K\u00e1narese country. They are divided into Panchams, Shilvants, Tilvants, and Tirules. Of these the Panchams and Tirules eat together, though Panchams will not eat from Tirules. Some Shilvants eat from none of the other subdivisions. None of the four intermarry. They are dark and middle-sized. The men wear the top-knot and moustache but not the whiskers or beard. With some exceptions, both at home and abroad, they speak Mar\u00e1thi. Except a few who live in large towns in well built houses, they generally live in small one-storeyed dwellings. They keep horses, cows, and buffaloes, and pay their servants 8s. to 10s. (Rs. 4-5) a month as wages. They are moderate eaters, and their staple food is rice, millet, pulse, and vegetables. They have a strong dislike to flesh, fish, and liquor, and consider all food polluted even by the touch of a Br\u00e1hman. The men dress in a waistcloth, turban, coat, and shoes, and the women in the full Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. Both men and women rub their brows with white cowdung ashes or *bhasm* instead of with sandal and redpowder, and tie a *ling* round their necks. The women tie the hair in a knot at the back of the head, and do not use false hair or deck their heads with flowers. They are generally even-tempered and hospitable, entertaining any guest that happens to come to their houses, especially if he is a Ling\u00e1yat. They are a mercantile people and follow various branches of trade. They deal in cloth, grain, oil, butter, molasses, and sugar, and are moneylenders husbandmen and labourers. As lenders they are less pushing than M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. Difference of profession is admitted to make a great social difference, still it does not prevent them from intermarrying or dining together. They worship all the Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, and keep the usual fasts and festivals. But their chief god is Mah\u00e1dev and they keep the fasts sacred to him with special care. They hold that no true believer can be impure, and therefore disregard the Br\u00e1hmanic rules of ceremonial impurity. A Jangam or Ling\u00e1yat priest officiates at their houses, and both a Br\u00e1hman and a Jangam attend their marriages. If a boy is born to a barren or to a daughter-stricken couple or if a boy recovers from severe sickness it is not unusual to devote him to serve in a Jangam monastery or *math*. All Ling\u00e1yats both men and women wear the *ling*. The *ling* is put round the babe\u2019s neck on the fifth day after birth by a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Komti details are given in the Shol\u00e1pur Statistical Account.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1n\u00ed details are given in the Shol\u00e1pur Statistical Account.\nJangam who hands it to the mother, by whom it is kept till the child is seven years old. The child then wears it with certain religious rites one of which is a caste feast. Their marriage customs and rites are the same as those of peasant Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They bury their dead and in all cases a tomb is raised on the spot with an inscription and a ling engraved on it. Many of them observe no mourning on the occasion of a death, nor do the women sit by themselves during their monthly sickness. The Ling\u00e1yats are careful to obey the orders of their spiritual heads who live in monasteries, of which there are three within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits, at Aundh, at Mahasuli in Kar\u00e1d, and at Nimsod in Khat\u00e1v. Their social disputes are settled by a meeting of the caste at which a Jangam presides and a majority of votes carries the point. The boys learn to read and write Mar\u00e1thi and to cast accounts. They are a prosperous people.\n\nMar\u00e1tha V\u00e1n\u00eds are returned as numbering 3243 and as found over the whole district. The men are middle-sized, dark, and stout, and the women are fair. Their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi, and they are traders, shopkeepers, and husbandmen. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. The men dress like Br\u00e1hmans, in a waistcloth, coat, shouldercloth, headscarf or turban, and shoes or sandals. The women dress in the full Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice like Br\u00e1hman women, drawing the skirt of the robe back between the feet. They worship the usual Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, keep the ordinary fasts and feasts, and go on pilgrimages to \u00c1landi, Benares, Jejuri, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur. Their priests are Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans to whom they pay great respect. They hold caste councils, send their boys to school for a short time, and are a steady class, making enough to maintain themselves and their families.\n\nM\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1n\u00eds are returned as numbering 275 and as found in ones and twos in every large village in the district. They speak M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri at home and incorrect Mar\u00e1thi abroad. They keep their houses clean, and paint the walls with bright fantastic colours. The men dress in a close fitting turban, a waistcloth, and coat, and the women wear the open-backed bodice, a petticoat, and a short robe drawn up from the petticoat band and falling like a veil over the head and face. Above the elbow and on the wrists they wear gold ornaments, but their chief ornaments are ivory bracelets. Their food is wheat, pulse, butter, oil, and sugar. They take much less care of their persons than of their houses. Their women, except on great occasions, are slovenly, but the men generally bathe daily. The features of the men are more strongly marked and they are sturdier and more active than Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00eds. The men shave the head leaving three patches of hair, a top-knot and a lock over each ear. They have a bad name for hard and unfair dealing. Besides lending money they deal in cloth, grain, pulse, oil, butter, and various other articles. In religion they are either Vaishnavs or Shravaks. The midwife who generally belongs to the Mar\u00e1tha caste attends a lying-in woman for twelve days during which the mother is held impure. The midwife bathes the mother and child daily, and keeps cowdung cakes burning under the mother\u2019s cot. On the fifth day the mother worships the goddess Chhatti, and, on the\nfollowing morning, ties a golden image of Chhatti round the child's neck. On the twelfth day the house is cowdunged, the clothes of the mother and child are washed, and a few near women relations are asked to dine. The mother, after worshipping the planets, the sun, and the earth with flowers, becomes pure, and is at liberty to mix with the house people. On the same day an Upper Indian Br\u00e1hman priest gives the child a name and is paid 3d. (2 as.), and the women guests retire with a present of wet gram or ghugris. They marry their girls before they are fifteen, and hold a betrothal ceremony at which they present the girl with a rupee and a silver finger ring, and fill her lap with rice, a cocoanut, and betel leaves. After this the marriage may take place at any time and is generally held within a year or two. If the parents of the girl are poor the boy's father has to give the girl's father money. They build no marriage altar, get no waterpots from the potter's, plant no lucky post in the booth, and worship no sprays of lucky trees as marriage guardians. The two chief heads of expenditure in a M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri marriage are caste dinners and ornaments. Except unweaned children they burn the dead, and if the deceased has died on an unlucky day they carry on the bier along with the deceased a dough human figure and burn it with the body. They believe that if a figure is not burnt, some one of the deceased's family will shortly die. The chief mourner does not shave his moustache, neither does he carry the fire in his hands, but it is taken by their caste barber in a copper vessel. After the body is burnt the mourners bathe, return home, and purify themselves by drinking cow's urine. The family of the deceased observe no mourning, and feast the caste on the twelfth day after death. They hold caste councils and settle social disputes at caste meetings. Their boys learn to read and write either at school or from their fathers at home. As a class they are well-to-do.\n\nT\u00e1mbolis, or Betel-sellers, are returned as numbering 2674 and as found over the whole district mostly in towns. They are said to have come into the district from the Karn\u00e1tak ten or twelve generations ago. They are divided into Ling\u00e1yat, Mar\u00e1tha, and Musalm\u00e1n T\u00e1mbolis. The following particulars apply to the Ling\u00e1yat T\u00e1mbolis. Their surnames are Dalve and Jeble. The names in common use among men are Bh\u00e1u, Hari, Krishna, M\u00e1ruti, R\u00e1ma, and Vithoba; and among women Bh\u00e1gu, Chimna, Gaja, Kusa, Rakhmi, and Thaku. Their home speech is Mar\u00e1thi and they look like peasant Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They live in neat and clean houses of the poorer sort generally one storey high with walls of brick and tiled roofs. Most of them keep cows and she-buffaloes, and almost all of them have ponies for bringing home packets of betel leaves from villages and gardens outside of the town. They are moderate eaters, and their staple food is millet, vegetables, pulse, and pungent and sour condiments. They do not eat fish or flesh, neither do they drink liquor. Their holiday dish is gram cakes or puranpolis. The men dress in a short waistcloth or pancha, a coat, waistcoat, headscarf or turban folded after the Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1ni fashion, shouldercloth, and shoes, and the women in a robe and bodice.\nworn like those of peasant Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The men wear gold earrings, finger rings, and a silver waistchain, and the women the black glass bead necklace with a gold button, glass bangles, and silver or bell-metal toe-rings. They also wear gold and silver earrings and necklaces, and the well-to-do have rich clothes and ornaments for wearing on special occasions. As a class they are orderly and thrifty. They sell betel leaves, nuts, cement, tobacco, and the spices used in chewing packets of betel leaves, as cardamoms, cloves, nutmeg and nutmeg, catechu, musk, and saffron. They buy leaves at thirty-six kavlis or packets, each kavli containing five hundred leaves, for \u00a31 4s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs.12-15) and sell them retail making a profit of 6s. to 8s. (Rs.3-4) on every thirty-six kavlis. Their women do not help them in their calling. Some are also husbandmen, and others house servants and labourers. They are a religious people devoted to the worship of Shiv. They worship all Hindu gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and festivals. They make pilgrimages to Jejuri and Pandharpur and believe Khandoba to be an incarnation of Shiv. Their priests are Jangams, but both Jangams and Br\u00e1hmans officiate at their ceremonies. They believe in witchcraft and spirits and consult oracles, and, although they think that the simple besmearing of the brow with ashes removes impurity, they hold a mother impure for twelve days after childbirth. For the first five days after childbirth the mother and child are daily rubbed with oil and turmeric, and, in the morning of the fifth day, the family Jangam ties a ling round the child's neck. In the evening the midwife worships the goddess Satv\u00e1i in the mother's room, and the mother and child bow before it. On the afternoon of the twelfth day kinswomen, friends, and neighbours present the child with caps and jackets, and putting it into a cradle give it a name. The expenses for the first twelve days vary from 10s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 5-15). Among them the boy's father has to look for a wife for his son and if the girl's parents are poor the boy's father has to give the girl's father \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50-100). The ceremony of betrothal or s\u00e1kharpuda is not necessary. When betrothal is performed, both fathers exchange presents of clothes and the girl's father in addition has to feast the caste. Their marriage god is the branch of a jambhul tree which they tie to the marriage hall along with a betelnut folded in a piece of yellow cloth. They rub the girl with turmeric and send what is over with music to the boy's. At the girl's, in addition to the marriage hall, they raise an earthen altar and place earthen pots which they bring from the potter's, and, after marking them with red green and yellow lines, set them round the altar. In the evening the boy is taken in procession to the temple of the village M\u00e1ruti, followed by his sister carrying a plate with a lighted dough lamp, a pot containing cold water, covered with a cocoanut, rice, and a small wooden box containing redpowder. From M\u00e1ruti's temple the boy goes to the girl's and sits in the booth. In the booth the Br\u00e1hman priest makes a square of wheat grains, and, on this, the boy and girl sit facing each other. A piece of cloth is held between them and the Br\u00e1hman priest repeats marriage verses, and, at the end, throws\nrice over their heads. The cloth is pulled to one side, the other guests throw grains of rice over their heads, and the boy and girl are husband and wife. The boy and girl are taken before the house gods, where they bow, and, after dining together from the same plate, are taken outside and seated in the booth. The Br\u00e1hman priest rubs their brows with redpowder, and sticks rice grains over the powder, and kinsfolk and friends, waving copper and silver coins round their heads, drop them into a dish laid in front. The money waved is made over to the musicians. Presents of clothes are exchanged, and, after a feast to the guests, the boy returns home with his bride in procession accompanied by relations, friends, neighbours, and music. A T\u00e1mboli\u2019s wedding costs \u00a320 to \u00a340 (Rs. 200-400) of which 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2-3) go to the Br\u00e1hman priest as his marriage fee. When a girl comes of age she is unclean for five days, during which she is fed on sweet dishes. On the morning of either the fifth or the seventh day she is bathed in warm water and her mother presents her with a new green robe and bodice and her husband with a new turban. The mother then fills the girl\u2019s lap with five kinds of fruit, and, when the rest of the household go to bed, she joins her husband. This costs \u00a31 to \u00a32 (Rs. 10-20). They bury their dead. If the deceased is a married woman, she is dressed in a green robe and bodice, her head is decked with flowers, her brow marked with redpowder, and either her daughter or her daughter-in-law waves a lighted lamp before her face. The chief mourner walks in front of the bier, while a Jangam blows a conch shell beside him. On the way to the burial ground the mourners halt, place a piece of bread on the spot, rest the bier, and the bearers change places and go on. At the burning ground they lower the body into the grave already dug by Mh\u00e1rs, fill it, and after paying the Mh\u00e1rs 1s. to 2s. 6d. (Rs. \u00bd-1\u00bc), bathe and return to the mourner\u2019s. On the third day the chief mourner goes to the burying ground, sprinkles cowdung on the grave, and lays a stone over it. Over this stone he sprinkles cow\u2019s dung and urine, and, throwing turmeric and redpowder over it, offers it rice mixed with curds. He goes to a short distance, and, after a crow has touched the rice, bathes and returns home. On the fifth day the family Jangam rubs ashes on the chief mourner\u2019s brow and he becomes pure. On the sixth day the caste is given a feast, and, on the tenth, rice balls or daspind are offered in the name of the deceased and thrown into a stream or water. The Jangam and Br\u00e1hman priests are presented with money and the funeral ceremonies are over. A T\u00e1mboli\u2019s funeral costs \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 (Rs.15-20). They are bound together by a strong caste feeling and settle social disputes at meetings of the caste. The authority of caste daily grows weaker. They send their boys to school and keep them at school till they know to read and write a little and cast accounts. As Musalm\u00e1ns and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s have of late taken to betel leaf selling, the Ling\u00e1yat T\u00e1mbolis have suffered from the competition and are not so well-to-do as they used to be.\n\nHusbandmen include two classes with a strength of 608,108 or 55\u00b744 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\nKunbis are returned as numbering 583,569 and as found over the whole district. They say that the founder of their caste was the sage K\u0101shyap, and that they came into the district from M\u0101rw\u0101r, Jodhpur, and Udepur about thirty generations ago. They are said to have sprung from ninety-six clans. Among their surnames are Chav\u00e1n, G\u0101ikav\u00e1d, J\u00e1dhav, Shinde, and Sirke. The names in common use among men are Govind, Parsu, R\u00e1ma, and Shidu, and among women, Bh\u00e1girithi, Ganga, Gojra, Rakhma, and Uma. S\u00e1t\u0101ra Kunbis are dark middle-sized and hardy, and their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi. Their practice of keeping cattle in their houses generally makes them dirty. Their house goods include field tools, metal and earthen vessels and pans, a grindstone, a handmill, and a pestle and mortar. They are moderate eaters and their staple food is millet, pulse, vegetables, fruit, roots, spices, oil, and butter, and, besides fish, fowls, eggs, sheep, and goats, they eat the flesh of the wild hog, deer, and hare. Besides water they drink milk, whey, and liquor, and smoke and chew tobacco. The men dress in a waistcloth, jacket, shouldercloth, turban, and shoes, and while working in the fields in a loincloth and blanket. The women wear a robe and bodice, rub their brows with redpowder, and do not deck their hair with flowers. They are hardworking, temperate, hospitable, and among themselves honest and just. Most of them are husbandmen, and they are helped in their work by their women and children. They worship all Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses and keep the usual fasts and feasts. The chief Kunbi holidays are the Hindu New Year's Day in April, Akshatritiya or the Undying Third in May, N\u00e1gpanchmi or the Cobra's Fifth in August, Pol\u00e1 or Bullock Day in August-September, Dasara in September, D\u00edn\u00e1li in October-November, Champ\u00e1shashthhi in December, Sankr\u00e1n\u00ed on the 12th of January, the full-moon day of M\u00e1gh or February-March called Navy\u00e1chitpunav, and Shimga or Holi in March. Their fast days are the four Mondays and Saturdays of Shr\u00e1v\u00e1n or July-August, Navr\u00e1tra the first nine days of \u00c1shvin or September-October the two Ek\u00e1d\u00e1shis or Elevenths of \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or July-August, Hart\u00e1l\u00edka and Rish Panchami in August-September, and Sh\u00edvr\u00e1tra in February. Besides on these days some fast on all Mondays Saturdays Sundays and Tuesdays of the year. Their favourite gods are Bahiroba, Mhaskoba, and V\u00e1ghoba, and their chief goddesses are Mari\u00e1j, Muk\u00e1i, Satr\u00e1i, and Tuk\u00e1i whose images they have in their houses. They greatly respect Br\u00e1hmans and call them to officiate at their houses. Their religious teachers are Gos\u00e1vis, whose advice or updesh they take. They believe in spirits and witchcraft, and stand in great awe of ghosts and evil spirits. For her first confinement a young wife generally goes to her parents' house. When she is delivered, the midwife, who\ngenerally belongs to the mother's family, sprinkles a little cold water over the babe's stomach, and cuts its navel cord. She puts the cord in an earthen jar along with the after-birth, a little turmeric and redpowder and rice, and buries it in a hole in the mother's room. The mother and child are bathed in warm water and laid on the cot, and, that they may not suffer from an attack of cold, a dish of live charcoal is placed under the cot. The child is fed by sucking cotton soaked in castor-oil and the mother is given assafoetida, butter, and pepper. To strengthen them, after childbirth women are also given sunthavda a tonic of dry ginger, gum, clarified butter, dry dates, dry cocoa-kernel, and the roots of the saphet musli Curculigo alba. For twelve days a lamp is kept burning near the mother and child. The laps of the midwife and of some married women are filled, and they are presented with turmeric and redpowder and retire. A Br\u00e1hman astrologer is called who refers to his almanac and finds out a name for the child, and retires with a present of either grain or money. But the child is not always called by the name chosen by the Br\u00e1hman. On the second day, if the family is well-to-do and the child is a boy, neighbour women and the wives of kinsmen and friends pour pots full of cold water on the road in front of the house, and, on the twelfth day, are treated to a feast, and presented with robes and bodices. On the third day the mother begins to suckle the child. For four days she is held impure, and, except the midwife, no one touches her. On the fifth the mother and child are bathed, the house is cowdunged, and all clothes are washed. On this day the mother eats nothing but dry cocoa-kernel and dates. In the evening close to the mother's head and feet two human pictures called Balir\u00e1na are drawn with soot or charcoal on the walls of the mother's room with their heads turned in opposite directions. In a corner of the room is placed a grindstone and on it a silver image of Satv\u00e1i worth a penny or two, made by a local goldsmith. The midwife ties a red cotton cord or n\u00e1da round it and lays before the image a lemon, a coil of thread, packets of redpowder and turmeric, pomegranate flowers, frankincense, camphor, five dates, five betelnuts, five halves of dry cocoa-kernel, a copper coin, betel leaves, parsley seeds, orris root or vekhand, a marking-nut, and a piece of black cord. By the side of the image of Satv\u00e1i is laid the knife with which the navel cord was cut. In the same way the bathing spot and the figures of Balir\u00e1na are worshipped. Some lay a sword by the side of Satv\u00e1i and some lay a pen, paper, and inkstand. Rice, varan or split pulse, vegetables, unstuffed cakes or pal\u00eds, fried wheat cakes called k\u00e1nol\u00e1s, and, at the house of some, goat's flesh are laid before Satv\u00e1i. Friends and relations are asked to a feast, and stay up the whole night, seated on small square blankets or chav\u00e1les, singing l\u00e1vnis or ballads. A lamp of wheat flour, fed with oil or clarified butter, is kept burning near the image of Satv\u00e1i. The child is not allowed to look at the lamp, as if it does not see the lamp straight it is sure to get a squint. On the sixth the offerings made to Satv\u00e1i are not removed, and the mother and child are not bathed. The mother is fed with the food cooked on the fifth day, as it is believed that after the\nSatv\u00e1i ceremony the mother\u2019s eating stale food does not give the child stomach-ache. On the seventh day the midwife gathers the offerings and the image of Satv\u00e1i in a cloth, and lays them near the bathing corner or mori. She bathes the child and rubs it with oil, and bathes the mother but without rubbing her with oil. After the bath the mother is given a little turmeric powder mixed with oil and water and one or two half cocoa-kernels. She warms herself with a chafing dish and is laid on the cot. On the eighth day the mother is given complete rest. On the ninth day the ground of the lying-in room is coated with cowdung, and the mother and child are rubbed with a mixture of turmeric and oil, and bathed. The mother is fed with ordinary food cooked in the house. On the tenth the mother loses all impurity. She is bathed from head to foot and her room is cleaned with cowdung. The child is bathed and laid in a basket. On the eleventh the child is bathed and for some time is laid in a basket. Rising early on the twelfth, the midwife cleans the room moving the cot outside, bathes the child, and lays it in a basket. She rubs the mother with fragrant ointments and bathes her and bringing back the cot tells her to lie on it. Turmeric powder, redpowder, and red sugar are laid before the bathing spot or mori and it is washed. The mother takes her child and walks out of the house on a square blanket or chav\u00e1le or on a sheet. She then goes outside of the village to a b\u00e1hhul or other tree under which are five stones the abode of the goddess Satv\u00e1i. These she washes, lays flowers, powder packets, and thread coils or n\u00e1da pudis before them, burns incense and marks her brow with ashes taken from the incense-burner. She bows to the goddess, saying \u2018The child is not mine but yours, kindly keep it healthy.\u2019 Unwidowed women or savashins are asked to a feast of rice, split pulse, vegetables, and unstuffed cakes or polis. If the family lives in a town this feast is held in front of the house. On the thirteenth a wooden cradle is hung with a string six or seven feet long fastened either to the right or left side. About four or five in the evening five or six unwidowed women are given betel-leaves and whole-boiled gram or wheat. A stone pin used in pounding relishes or chatnis is washed, dressed in a child\u2019s cap and hood, and a gold or silver wire or sari is put round one of its ends. Under the cradle a white sheet is laid and folded four times, and round the four sides a square or chauk of wheat or rice is traced and a second sheet is spread over it. When all is ready the stone pin, which is called Gopya, is laid in the cradle, and the mother is seated under the cradle on the white sheet. After a short time Gopya is taken out of the cradle and the child is dressed in a cap and a hood or kunchi, and, to keep off the evil eye, its eyelids, left cheek, right hand, and left foot are touched with collyrium or lamp-black, and, while some of the women sing R\u00e1m\u2019s cradle song, the child is laid in the cradle. Boiled gram or wheat called ghugris are scattered along the side of the cradle, the cradle is rocked by the unwidowed women, and the child is generally given any name chosen by the Br\u00e1hman astrologer or by the married women guests if the astrologer\u2019s name does not suit their fancy. If a mother has lost several infants, she names the next child Dagad or Dhonda, that is stone apparently with the object of cheating the\nevil spirits into the idea that the child is not valued and is not worth carrying off. If the baby cries much it is named after its father's father or mother, as it is supposed that their spirit has come into the child. After the child has been named the women kiss it and pray God to keep it in health. After naming the child they hand the guests the ghugris or whole-boiled gram and wheat, saying 'Take this gram and take our b\u00e1l or babe to play.' Boys are married between fifteen and twenty-five and girls before they come of age. As a rule the proposals of marriage come from the boy's parents. Before accepting the offer the boy's father makes a full inquiry regarding the surname, family, and relations of the girl's father. When he is satisfied on these points the boy's father goes with friends and kinsfolk to the girl's, marks her brow with redpowder, touches her brow with a rupee, and lays the rupee in her hands. The girl is given a small robe, a bodice, and some ornaments, and her grandmother and her maternal uncle's wife are presented with two robes worth 5s. or 6s. (Rs. 2\u00bd-3) and called \u00e1jichir or grandmother's robe and m\u00e1vlunchir or aunt's robe. The girl's father asks the boy's father and his kinsfolk, and his own friends and kinspeople, to a feast of cakes or polis either stuffed or unstuffed. When the feast is over a Br\u00e1hman is called to fix the marriage day and is paid by both fathers. If the girl's father is poor he takes \u00a310 to \u00a315 (Rs. 100-150) as her price; if he is rich he gives her \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50-100) as her dowry. Before the marriage, in front of both the boy's and the girl's houses, a marriage porch is built and in the girl's marriage porch an earthen altar or bahule is set. Supplies of clothes, grain, oil, and other articles are also laid in. About a fortnight before the marriage the bride and bridegroom are rubbed with turmeric powder. Three or four unwidowed women grind this turmeric in a handmill to whose handle in a yellow cloth are tied a betelnut and three or four sprouted turmeric roots. In country parts except the headman and other m\u00e1nkaris or honourables, most of the men of the village take part in the turmeric grinding, sitting four or five at a handmill. They sing the women's corn-grinding songs. On the day when the boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric, women bring to the houses gram in a platter and in return are given small balls of boiled wheat flour. During the two or three days after the boy has been rubbed with turmeric friends and kinspeople ask him to dine, and when he goes young girls sometimes go with him. If one of the friends is wealthy, he calls the boy and all the members of the boy's family to his house with musicians playing before them, feasts them on cakes or polis, and hangs flower garlands or mund\u00e1vals round the boy's head. If the houses of the bride and bridegroom are in the same town or village the installing of their badge or marriage guardian called devak is held on the marriage day. If the boy and girl live in different places the worship is held two or three days before the marriage day. In installing the marriage guardian the first step is to worship the house gods. After the house gods are worshipped a near kinsman of the boy's father and his wife have the skirts of their garments tied together,\nand, under a waistcloth held over their heads by four persons, go, preceded by musicians, to the village M\u00e1runi. The husband carries on his shoulder an axe or some other iron field tool and a rope twelve to fifteen feet long, and his wife walks close behind him carrying a platter with the family crest and an offering of food. Behind the pair walk four or five unwidowed women each carrying a brass water cup full of water. At M\u00e1runi's temple the Gurav or ministrant has a supply of sprigs of five trees, the mango, the rui Calitropis gigantea, the saundad Acacia suma, the Indian fig or vad, and the jambhul Syzygium jambolana. The party bow before the god and lay sandal, flowers, frankincense, and food before him and the ministrant presents them with the five sprigs or panch palvis. On their return to the house they tie the five sprigs to a pole in the marriage porch and along with the sprigs tie a cake or poli and the spiced gram relish called besan which is eaten with bread. On this day some ten to twenty friends and kinspeople are asked to a feast of unstuffed cakes. They sit on square blankets and after a service of betel withdraw. When the guests are gone the women of the house sit on the bare ground and eat. When a marriage party has to go to a distant village they travel in bullock carts with music. On reaching the boundary of the girl's village or town, water is fetched and poured on the boundary by a Koli of the place who is given a cocoanut and occasionally a turban worth 2s. (Re.1). On entering the village, if he has not ridden the whole way, the bridegroom mounts a horse and goes to the village M\u00e1runi with music and halts there with his sisters or other young girls who are called karavlis or groom's maids. In the village the girl's father has provided a lodging or janmasghar for the boy's party. In the evening from M\u00e1runi's temple the bridegroom's brother or other near relation, called the vardhava or groom-sent, mounts a horse, and, with friends and music, goes to the bride's. On reaching the bride's her father asks him to dine, and, if he is rich, gives him a turban. When the groom-sent has taken some food the bride's father gives him, for the bridegroom, a tinsel chaplet, a turban, a red chintz overcoat, a pair of waistcloths, a pair of shoes, and a shouldercloth. The harbinger mounts his horse and starts for M\u00e1runi's temple with the bride's father and some of the bride's kinsmen who carry four or five bodice-banners or dhvajas tied to poles and held over his head, and followed by an unwidowed woman or savashin with a cocoanut and betel leaves in a platter. As he goes the bride's brother pelts him with onions. At M\u00e1runi's temple the bride's father lays the platter with the dress before the bridegroom. A Br\u00e1hman priest who is in attendance tells the bridegroom to wash his eyes with water, loosens the brocaded end of the bridegroom's turban, and winds it twice or thrice round the bridegroom's neck. He sets up a betelnut Ganpati and tells the bridegroom to wash it and lay sandal-powder and flowers before it. After this the priest touches the new clothes with turmeric powder, marks the bridegroom's brow with sandal-powder, and gives him the clothes. If the bridegroom's old turban is of little value, it is given to the barber who is to lead his horse; if the turban is rich the barber is given a cocoanut. Betel leaves are handed to all\npresent and money is given to the Br\u00e1hmans. The bridegroom's left cheek is touched with lamp-black. He lays before M\u00e1runi two betel leaves, a betelnut, and a copper coin and walks round him. He carries a dagger or poniard with a lemon stuck on its point. Before starting for the bride's a cocoanut is broken to keep off evil influences. The village Mh\u00e1r stands before the bridegroom as if to stop him and is given a white turban or shouldercloth worth 6d. to 1s. (4-8 as.). When he reaches the bride's house, a Mh\u00e1r woman comes with an iron lamp in a platter and waves it round his head saying 'May all your pains and troubles vanish and the riches of Bali be poured on you.' For this she is given a cheap bodice cloth. Near the door of the bride's house the wife of her maternal uncle waves round the bridegroom's head a lighted lamp of wheaten flour with two wheat flour balls at its sides and is given a bodice and a robe. This lamp-waving is called varov\u00e1ni or the bridegroom-waving. The boy's party are seated on the marriage porch and the bridegroom is made to stand near the earth altar in the centre of which is placed a mango sprig stuck in a ball of mud and at each corner a coloured earthen pot called vahi. The bride is carried out of the house and set in front of the bridegroom facing him. The priest and some begging Br\u00e1hmans come forward and divide into two parties. A cloth or antarp\u00e1t is held between the bride and bridegroom so that they cannot see each other's faces. They touch finger tips with the cloth between them. The two parties of Br\u00e1hmans hand the guests turmeric or red-coloured rice or millet to throw on the heads of the bride and bridegroom. The two parties of priests in turn recite mang\u00e1l\u00e1sthaks or lucky verses at the end of each verse throwing some coloured grains on the heads of the pair, and the guests like the Br\u00e1hmans at the end of each verse throw coloured grains. When the verses are over the Br\u00e1hmans clap their hands, all the guests clap their hands, and musicians raise a din of music. Shortly after the maternal uncles of the bride and bridegroom sit on stools with the bride and bridegroom on their knees and with their faces turned to each other. The priest tells the bride and bridegroom to fold their hands and touch finger tips while he winds a yellow thread round their necks. This ceremony is called sutavne or the thread-winding. While they are thus seated the girl-giving or kany\u00e1d\u00e1n is performed by the bride's maternal uncle, or in his absence by her father. When he gives her away the uncle presents the girl with copper vessels according to his means. The priest muttering some verses cuts the yellow thread that was passed round the pair's necks and tells them to sit on the altar or bahule. The bride sits on the bridegroom's left. In front of the pair a burnt offering is made called l\u00e1j\u00e1hom of clarified butter pieces of wood and fried rice. A winnowing fan with rice, split pulse, wafer biscuits, fried rice cakes, and vermicelli is laid before the bridegroom. The priest suddenly puts his hand over one of the articles on the fan, and asks the bridegroom to say what he has hid. If the bridegroom guesses right the priest says that his patron has got an intelligent son-in-law; if he answers wrong he calls him a dull fellow. After this a low stool covered with wheat flour and with lines drawn on\nit is set before the bride and bridegroom and they are told to say each other's name, money is given to the Br\u00e1hman, and he retires. On the same day, after the marriage is over, a party from the bride's go to the village M\u00e1runi, and, with the same rites as those described in the case of the bridegroom's party, bring and tie in the marriage porch the bride's father's devak or marriage guardian. After the bride's devak has been installed a party of the bride's kinswomen go in procession to the bridegroom, with platters full of fried rice cakes, and rice vermicelli or shewya. They are received with honour and are given turmeric and redpowder. They empty their platters and in return one of them the bridegroom's kinswomen put 1s. to \u00a31 (Rs.\u00bd-10) in cash. This food-gift to the bridegroom is called rukhvat. Then some of the bride's near kinsmen with music go to ask kinsmen to dine, and bring them home with music, and in the same way the women of the bride's family bring kinswomen. The relations are feasted on unstuffed cakes or polis, rice, split pulse, \u00e1lan or boiled rice flour seasoned with spices, and fried rice cakes. Early next morning, with music and friends, the bride and bridegroom seated on a horse, the bride in front, are taken to a river or garden, and, after retiring, have their feet rubbed with wet turmeric powder and oiled redpowder, and return with music. About ten the boy and girl are bathed on low stools in the booth. Round the bathing-place are set four or five t\u00e1mby\u00e1s or copper drinking pots with a white thread passed round their necks. At the time of bathing the bridegroom is seated on a low stool and the bride on another low stool or a large platter. While bathing they fill their mouths with water and blow it over each other's faces. The boy holds a betelnut in his hand and the girl using both her hands tries to force it out; then the girl holds the nut and the boy tries to force it out with his left hand. If the boy fails the guests jeer at him calling him bulga or impotent. When the bathing is over the bridegroom tries to lift the bride by his left hand and set her at his left side while the bride tries to prevent him lifting her from the ground. These struggles greatly amuse the guests and relations. The boy and girl are then dressed and their brows are rubbed with redpowder and their bodies with turmeric. They are given a dish of shewya, that is milk, clarified butter, rice vermicelli, and raw sugar, and feed each other. After dinner they sit on the altar in the booth. In the evening the bride's father gives a caste feast and on one of the days the boy's father treats the caste to rice, split pulse, vegetables, and unstuffed cakes or polis. On this day, or if this is not a lucky day on the next, the bride's lap is filled. The priest folds a waistcloth four times, covers it with rice or wheat grains, and tells the bride and the bridegroom to sit on it. While the priest chants verses the bridegroom fills the bride's lap with five half cocoa-kernels, five dates, five sprouted turmeric roots, five betelnuts, a quarter of a pound of rice, a comb, a small casket, and a variously coloured cord. The bridegroom's father presents the\n\n---\n\n1 The reason of the procession music and turmeric rubbing is to keep off spirits which at such times are specially troublesome.\nbride with the richest robe he can afford and the guests present the fathers of the bride and bridegroom with clothes or cash from 1s. (8 as.) upwards. These presents are called \u0101her. After this the twelve baluted\u0101rs or village servants come in, and, according to his means, the boy's father gives their wives bodicecloths or cash. If he is rich he gives the headman or p\u0101til a turban. In the evening the bride's and the bridegroom's skirts are tied together, and they walk to the bridegroom's house or lodging. After lamplight the bridegroom's mother with a band of kinspeople walks towards the bride's on cloths spread by the village washerman, and at the same time the bride's mother starts with a band of friends to visit the boy's mother. When the parties meet they stop ten or fifteen paces from each other. A waistcloth is held in front of each party and they begin throwing redpowder on one another. They jest with one another showing in front of the cloth a ladle, a rolling-pin, a dog, or a cat. While this is going on the bridegroom and his mother pretend to be offended and leave the party. The bride's father and mother follow them and appease them with presents. Then the two parties move on to the bride's where the bridegroom's mother is seated in the booth on a three-legged stool. Round her are arranged four or five metal drinking pots or t\u0101mby\u0101s with a thread passed round their necks, and the boy and girl are seated on her lap. The bride's father gives a robe to the bridegroom's mother and the bridegroom's father gives a robe to the bride's mother. This interchange of robes is called potjh\u0101kni or stomacher. While the bridegroom's mother is seated on her stool the jh\u0101l or handing ceremony is performed. A bamboo basket or round metal dish, with a comb, a looking glass, a casket, a rolling-pin, five sweet things, and five wheat flour lamps is set on the bridegroom's mother's head, and four or five women stand about her and sing the jh\u0101l song which runs: 'The bridegroom has reached the village boundary, I will worship the boundary and win the bridegroom.' Meanwhile a kinsman of the bridegroom's runs away with the basket or dish to the bridegroom's and is pursued and pelted with onions by the bride's people. The bride's father mother and other near relations hold the bride seated on their crossed hands and set her on her husband's lap and then on the laps of his father mother and other near relations. At the time of handing her over the girl's relations with sobs and tears say: 'Up to this she was ours, now she is yours.' This ceremony is seldom over till the morning cock-crow, and, after it is over, sometimes as late as five they sit to a feast. When the feast is over the bride and bridegroom are led into the god-house and bow before the images. As he bows the bridegroom steals one of the gods and refuses to give it up till the bride's father makes him a present. All then go to the bridegroom's. In the evening the bridegroom's father gives betel leaves with nuts to the guests and bids them goodbye. If the bridegroom belongs to another village, the guests who belong to his village accompany him home. When they reach the village the bride and bridegroom are taken to the temple of the village M\u0101ruti. In the evening about seven or eight the bride and bridegroom are seated\non a horse and led to his house with a procession, music, and if they can afford them fireworks. In the house a dish with coconuts saffron and betel leaves is waved round the image of Khandoba, a ceremony which is called the lifting of Khandoba's tali or plate. After the plate-waving comes the jhenda nachne or flag-dance when one man sets the bride on his back and another sets the bridegroom on his back and they dance. Sometimes the bride sits on the bridegroom's back and a man dances with both on his back. After the dance the bridegroom, holding the full box of a seed drill in his hand, sprinkles grain on the ground and along with the bride who carries resin in her hand goes to the god room. At the door of the god room they find the boy's sister who refuses to let them pass till they promise to give their first daughter in marriage to her son. They agree though the promise is almost never kept, and pass in, and laying a betelnut and a copper coin before them, bow to the house gods. The girl is considered the goddess of wealth and her brow is marked with redpowder. Some wheat with a piece of gold in it is heaped between the bride and bridegroom, and they are told to divide the heap. If the bride gets the gold in her half she is applauded and it is taken as an omen that the rule in the house will be hers. On the next or some other lucky day the bride and bridegroom are bathed and the turmeric is taken off. If she can afford it the boy's mother for a fortnight longer feeds them on boiled rice and clarified butter.\n\nWhen a girl comes of age her feet are rubbed with turmeric powder moistened with water and her brow with redpowder with or without oil; and she is fed on varan or splitpulse cooked in water with turmeric powder, and salt, rice, vegetables, and unstuffed cakes or polis. If her father-in-law is rich the girl is for four days seated in a gaily dressed frame called a makhar probably from makh\u0101laya or a place of sacrifice. On the fifth she and her husband are bathed and while they bathe music is played. She is dressed in a green robe and a green bodice, and her hands are adorned with fresh green glass bangles. Her father, if rich enough, gives her husband a waistcloth and turban and to his mother a robe and a bodice, and beds, a carpet, a set of betel dishes, and a samai or metal lamp for her and her husband's use. Some unwidowed women with relations are asked to feast on cakes or polis and the girl and her husband are made to feed each other from the same dish.\n\nWhen a woman is pregnant for the first time, her food longings are satisfied, and a special feast called dohalejevan or the longing dinner is held in the fifth or in the seventh month of her pregnancy. She is presented with a green robe and a green bodice, or a bodice only if her husband is poor, and some ten or fifteen unwidowed women are asked to dine with her. Lamps are placed by her side and the feast is made as grand as the giver can afford. To guard against the danger of miscarriage from violent movements or a sudden fright, a pregnant woman is made to sit in a sailing boat and a cart, is shown funeral processions, is made to cross the leather rope attached to the bag in a bullock draw-well, and to cross the boundaries of a village or a town.\nWhen a Kunbi is at the point of death he is lifted from his bed and laid on a blanket and his son rests the dying head on his lap. After death the body is bathed in water heated on a hearth set in front of the house. To carry the body a ladder-like bier is made of two poles six or seven feet long with three or four small cross pieces. Two new earthen pots, a large one for water and a small one for fire, redpowder, betel leaves, and a cloth about seven and a half feet long are brought from the market or village cloth shop. Word is sent to the village Mh\u00e1r who carries cowdung cakes and firewood to the burning ground which is generally on the river bank. The body is washed with warm water on a plank placed before the front door. Except the face the body is covered with a new waistcloth and a cord is passed several times round the body to secure the cloth firmly. Betel leaves and gul\u00e1l or redpowder are sprinkled over it, and a basil leaf is put in the mouth and some rice, a copper coin, and the quarter of a cake are laid beside the body. Four of the dead person\u2019s kinsmen bear the body, and the son bathes and walks in front carrying the firepot on a triangular frame fastened to a sling. Before setting out he is warned not to look back. About half-way to the burning ground at a place called the vis\u00e1vy\u00e1chi j\u00e1ga or rest-place the party stops and the bearers set the bier on the ground and change places. They throw away the rice the copper coin and the quarter of a cake which were laid on the bier beside the body and pick up a stone which is usually called the life-stone or jiv-khada. When they reach the burning ground they raise a pile of four layers of cowdung cakes. They then take off the waistcloth, cut the thread tied round the waist, and loosen the loincloth. The body is laid on the pyre and is covered with other layers of cakes. When the mouth is being covered the son pours a little water into it. The son sets fire to the pyre, bathes, brings water in the large earthen pot, and stands at the head of the pyre. Another person comes and with a small stone makes a hole in the earthen pot. As the water spouts from the pot, the son goes five times round the pyre and at the end throws the pot on the ground at the head of the pyre, and calls aloud beating his mouth with the back of his hand. He then goes and sits among the other men without touching them. After a short time the sound made by the bursting of the skull is heard and the chief mourner and others, at least the four bearers, bathe. The stone with which the earthen pot was pierced is kept with great care somewhere in the burning place. On their return to the house of mourning the funeral party are given nimb leaves to eat; or they go to a temple and then to their houses. The mourners do not cook but are fed on that day by a relation or a friend with food prepared at his house.\n\nIn the evening after the funeral a lighted lamp is set on the spot where the dead breathed his last. Flour is strewn round the lamp and the lamp is covered with a basket. Next morning the basket is moved and the flour is examined. If a human footprint appears on the flour the dead person is believed to be re-born as a human being; and if the footprint is that of a bird or beast, the spirit of the person is believed to have entered that beast or bird.\nNext morning the son, with some friends and relations, goes to the burning ground with three small earthen pots with their mouths covered with three small wheaten cakes and three *pimpal* leaves. He places the small pots in a winnowing basket and fills them with milk cow-urine and honey or sugar and lays some cowdung in the basket. On reaching the rest-place the son lays on the ground a cake with a little raw sugar. He goes on to the burning ground and from the spot where the body was burnt, he takes the ashes except one bone which he puts aside, and throws them into the nearest river. If he is rich he gathers the bones and afterwards takes them to a holy river. After removing the ashes the son sprinkles the spot with cowdung and cowurine and places the two pots with two cakes one where the head lay and the other where the feet lay. When the ash-gathering or *rakhs\u00e1v\u00e1dhane* is over the son and the other mourners bathe and return home. On the third day the bearers\u2019 shoulders are rubbed with oil, and they are given dry cocoa-kernel to eat. On the tenth all the household bathe and wash their clothes in the river; and the son shaves his moustache and bathes. While a Br\u00e1hman repeats verses the son washes with cow-urine, the life-stone or *jiv-khada* and the bone he kept, prepares ten balls and three little banners made of three ochre-coloured cloths each tied to a stick. The Br\u00e1hman is given some money, shoes, and sometimes even a cow, presents which are supposed to help the dead on his way to heaven. After preparing the offering balls the son sits at a distance that crows may come and eat them. If a crow touches them soon after they have been laid out, the dead is supposed to have died with no unfulfilled wish. If crows do not touch the balls the son and his relations promise to fulfil the dead person\u2019s wish, and, when the promise is given, the crows are believed to fall on the offering and eat it. After this is over the son and the other mourners bathe and return home. On the thirteenth day the priest is given money and provisions, and a feast of unstuffed cakes or *polis*, rice, and split pulse is given to friends and relations in honour of the dead. Some food is put in a platter and the platter is kept aside that crows may eat out of it. In the evening one of his near relations ties a small white turban round the son\u2019s head and takes him with the other mourners and generally some of the villagers to M\u00e1ru\u1e6di\u2019s temple where the son lays a copper coin and a betelnut before the god. Every month a man is asked to dine in the name of the dead, and, after five months and a half, a feast of unstuffed cakes or *polis* is given to the near relations of the dead. In the dark half of *Rhadrapad* or August-September the spirit of the dead is worshipped on the day of the fortnight which corresponds with the death day. When an unwidowed woman or *sav\u00e1dhi\u1e47i* dies the body on the bier is sprinkled with redpowder, betel leaves, and scented powders. Her forehead is rubbed with vermilion and her body with oiled turmeric powder. Some turmeric powder is taken from her body and rubbed on her husband. On her way to the burning ground she is asked to look back, and allow her husband to marry again.\n\nWhen a death occurs in a family, the close relations of the same family stock remain ceremonially impure or *sutaki* for ten days and\ndistant relations of the same stock for three days. Though widow marriage is allowed, a remarried woman is not allowed to perform religious rites along with her husband, and her husband is not allowed to make offerings to the dead. If a widower marries a maid he is not prevented from making offerings. A remarried widow is less honoured than other women. Kunbis are bound together by a strong caste feeling and settle social disputes at their caste council or panch. The guilty are fined and the fine money is used in good works or in a caste dinner. Their guru or teacher has no voice in social disputes. Some of them send their children to school keeping their boys at school five or six years and their girls one or two.\n\nMaratha's are found all over the district. The 1881 census includes them under Kunbis from whom they do not form a separate caste. Some Maratha families may have a larger strain of northern or Rajput blood than the Kunbis. But this is not always the case. The distinction between Kunbis and Marathas is almost entirely social, the Maratha as a rule being better off, and preferring war or service as a constable or a messenger to husbandry. The Satara Marathas seem to have no historic or legendary evidence as to when or from where they came into the district. Though somewhat fairer in colour and more refined in manners Marathas as a class cannot be distinguished from Kunbis with whom all eat and the poorer marry.\n\nAll Marathas have surnames some of them true or clan surnames, others false surnames, that is divisions of clan surnames generally called after places or callings. In most cases families who are known by a place or calling surname know or can find out to what clan surname they belong. The Maratha clan surnames are interesting as they include the names, and, in some cases, apparently preserve the true or un-Sanskritised forms of the names, of many of the early Deccan Hindu dynasties of whom all trace has passed from the Deccan caste lists. Among these dynastic names are Cholke perhaps the original form of Chalukya for long (560-1190) the rulers of the Deccan and Karnatak; Kadam which seems to be the same as Kadamb the name of dynasties who at different times ruled all the Karnatak, Kolhapur, and Goa (500-1200); More who probably represent the Mauryas a branch of the great North Indian family who were ruling in the Konkan and Deccan in the sixth century; Salunke, which seems to belong to late comers perhaps followers of the Solanki kings of Gujar\u00e1t (943-1240); Shelar, which seems to preserve the original name of the Silshar family who ruled in the Konkan and West Deccan from about 850 to 1275; and Yadav whose most famous Deccan family was of Devgiri or Daulatabad, who were in power, and, during much of the time supreme, in the Deccan from about 1150 till the Musalm\u00e1n conquest in 1294. As far as is known the Devgiri Yadavs passed from the south northwards, and it is possible they were not northerners but southerners Kurabars or other shepherds, who, under Brahman influence, adopted the great northern shepherd name of Yadav.\n\n1 Details of the origin and history of the name Maratha and a list of Maratha surnames and marriage guardians or devaks are given in the Kolhapur Statistical Account.\nThe preservation of these old dynastic names suggests the hope that an enquiry into the strength and distribution of these clans may throw light on the strength of the northern element in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. This hope seems idle. Almost all the leading tribal surnames Cholke, More, Pov\u00e1r, Shel\u00e1r, and Y\u00e1dav are found besides among Kunbis, who do not appreciably differ from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in race, among Dhangars, Kolis, M\u00e1lis (who are Kunbis), Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, R\u00e1moshis, and several wandering tribes, as Beld\u00e1rs, Bhar\u00e1dis, Bhorpis, Gh\u00eds\u00e1dis, and Kaik\u00e1dis, classes which seem to be but slightly connected. The existence of the same clan name in most middle and low-class Deccan Hindus may be due to the fact that these clans or tribes came into the Deccan as nations or communities complete enough to spread a fresh layer of people over the whole country. The case of the Vanj\u00e1ris whose great bands formerly included many classes of craftsmen and who still have Lohars and Mh\u00e1rs among them shows that this is not impossible. At the same time the evidence against sameness of surname proving sameness of tribe or race is so strong as to make such widespread immigrations improbable. The case of the Uchl\u00e1s or slit-pockets of Poona, all of whom are either G\u00e1ikv\u00e1ds or J\u00e1dhavs, is an extreme proof that sameness of surname by no means implies sameness of tribe or race. Uchl\u00e1s are recruited from all except the impure classes. They are joined, besides by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and K\u00e1m\u00e1this, by Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri Vanis, and Musalm\u00e1ns, and all recruits, whatever their caste, are adopted either into the G\u00e1ikv\u00e1d or into the J\u00e1dhav clan.\u00b9\n\nThe evidence presented by the case of the Uchl\u00e1s is supported in a less extreme form by the general Deccan practice of calling a chief's retainers by the chief's surname. Taken together with the case of the Uchl\u00e1s, who supply almost the last living trace of the old system of recruiting the predatory tribes, this practise seems to show that to have a northern surname is no proof of a northern origin or even of a strain of northern blood. The possession of northern surnames probably usually arose, like the possession of the Norman names of Gordon and Campbell by the Scotch Keltic highlanders, from the practice of followers taking or being given the name of their chief.\u00b2\n\nExcept the deshmulkhs or district officers, the heads of villages and in\u00e1md\u00e1rs or grant holders who live in good houses two or more storeys high with walls of brick and tiled roofs, most Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s live in poor one-storeyed dwellings. The well-to-do strictly enforce the women seclusion system called gosha that is curtain or Mar\u00e1th mola that is Mar\u00e1tha custom. It is uncertain whether women seclusion was borrowed from the Musalm\u00e1ns or is a remnant of the old Kshatriya rule of antiaspur or inner apartment. Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s eat flesh and drink liquor and their boys are girt with the sacred thread on or shortly before the marriage day. Mar\u00e1tha women, as a rule, do not pass the skirt of their robe back between the feet especially on festive occasions. Except the\n\n\u00b9 Uchla details are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\n\u00b2 In his own country a Mar\u00e1tha chief's retainers where they are known may be called by their own surnames. Among strangers retainers are called by their chief's surname. Mr. Y. M. Kelkar, Assistant Commissioner S. D.\ndifference caused by their practice of not allowing their women to appear in public the Mar\u00e1tha family customs at birth, coming of age, pregnancy, and death differ little from those described under Kumbis. The marriage ceremonies of the two classes have several notable points of difference. Among Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s marriage preparations begin on a lucky day chosen by the village astrologer or gr\u00e1m joshi and kinspeople are invited. A short time before the marriage, the boy is girt with the sacred thread, and, except that the Br\u00e1hman repeats classical Sanskrit texts instead of Vedic texts, the Mar\u00e1tha thread-girding is the same as the Br\u00e1hman thread-girding. The first of the marriage ceremonies is the turmeric rubbing which is performed with the same details at the houses both of the boy and of the girl. Turmeric is mixed sometimes with water and sometimes with milk and rubbed on the girl by her female relations and what is over is sent with music to the boy's. At the boy's a married woman traces a quartz square in the marriage hall, and in front of the square, sets a low wooden stool on which the boy is seated. Five or more other married women surround him and the Br\u00e1hman priest places a waterpot in the middle of the square, fills the waterpot with water, and drops into it a copper coin and a betelnut. On the mouth of the pot is laid a piece of cocoa-kernel and five betelnuts. The priest sets a betelnut Ganpati near the waterpot, lays sandal paste, flowers, vermilion, burnt frankincense, and sweetmeats both before the waterpot Varun and the betelnut Ganpati and prays them to be kindly. The married women with a dish of turmeric, redpowder, and rice grains, rub turmeric over the boy's body, mark his brow with redpowder, and stick grains of rice on the powder. The boy is dressed and a flower garland or mund\u00e1val is tied round his head. He lays a cocoanut before his family goddess or kuldevi, bows before her, and starts for the girl's home with the priest, kinsfolk, and friends and musicians. When they reach the girl's village boundary, or more often the temple of M\u00e1rti which is generally close outside of the village, they stop and perform the simanti or boundary ceremony. They are met by the girl's party at the temple. With the help of his priest the girl's father lays sandal flowers and sugar before the waterpot Varun and the betelnut Ganpati and presents the boy with clothes and ornaments. Betel is served to the boy's friends and kinspeople and the priests are dismissed with money presents. As the lucky moment draws near, a kinsman of the girl, called the vardh\u00e1va or bride-sent, visits the boy's party and asks them to come, and they start for the girl's. The boy is seated on horseback with a dagger in his right hand, before him walk the musicians, and after him his friends and relations. On reaching the girl's house the boy is taken to a ready-made place in the marriage hall where the male guests take their seats, and is seated on a low wooden stool near the marriage altar. The women go into the house, remove their veils and take their seats on carpets in the women's hall, apart from the marriage hall, where, except the old priests of both\n\n1 At the thread-girding of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur, thirty poor Br\u00e1hman boys were girt with the sacred thread at the state expense and by the same priests in the same hall, the rites performed being nearly the same.\nthe boy and the girl and occasionally the fathers of the couple, no male members are admitted, not even the men servants except on business, who stand at a distance and do not allow any male stranger to come in. At a lucky moment, the girl, closely veiled from head to foot and helped by her women servants and friends, is made to stand on a low stool before the boy face to face near the marriage altar and a yellow sheet marked with the lucky cross or *nandi* is held between them by the priests, who repeat verses and throw yellow rice at the couple, crying *Savdh\u00e1n* or Beware. At the lucky moment, the astrologer claps his hands and guns are fired; the priests draw aside the curtain, the musicians redouble their noise, and the priests and the women guests throw yellow rice over the pair.\n\nA short time before the lucky moment, one of the priests hands a little yellow rice to the men guests in the hall, and when the pair are wedded another priest gathers it from the men guests in a dish and pours it over the heads of the pair. The girl's maternal uncle or some other near male relation takes the girl's right hand and gives it to the boy who clasps it fast in both his hands. The priest lays both his hands over those of the boy and the girl and mutters verses. The girl's father lays sandal, flowers, rice, burnt frankincense, and sweetmeats before the betelnut Ganpati and the waterpot Varun, and pours water from the waterpot over the clasped hands of the boy and the girl, and this completes the girl-giving or *kany\u0101d\u0101na*. The boy lets the girl's hand go and the priest knots together the hems of their clothes. The sacrificial fire is lit and fed with clarified butter, sesame seed, cotton stalks, and *palas* or other sacred wood. The couple leave their seats and perform the *saptapadi* or seven steps by walking seven times from right to left round the fire. They worship the family gods and the marriage is over. Next day a feast is held at the girl's house. On the morning of the feast, a few young or newly married pairs are asked to the girl's house and play in the hall the usual games of betelnut hide and seek and of turmeric-throwing. Goats and sheep are brought in, and each of the pairs is made to show their skill with the sword. The bridegroom and bride first chop off the heads of two goats and the other pairs follow them, any one who with one blow cuts the goat's head clean off being loudly applauded. On the morning of the day on which the boy is to leave for his parents' house with his wife, the boy's mother performs the ceremony of seeing the girl's face or *summukh*. Accompanied by kinswomen and friends and the family priest and music the boy's mother goes to the girl's bringing bamboo baskets with sesame and gram balls, betelnuts, coccokernels, dates, a robe and a bodice, ornaments including the lucky marriage necklace or *mangalsutra*, and sweetmeats and fruit. At the girl's the family priest worships the waterpot Varun and the betelnut Ganpati, and the boy's mother dresses the girl in the clothes she has brought, puts on the ornaments, ties the marriage string round her neck, and sweetens her mouth with sugar. Then comes the basket or *jh\u00e1l*, that is the handing ceremony. A piece of cloth is spread in a bamboo basket, and nine dates, nine pieces of cocoa-kernel, and nine lumps of turmeric, a handful of rice, and\ncooked food are put in the basket. The priest worships the basket and the boy and girl walk five times round it from right to left. The basket is set on the heads of the nearest relations of the boy and the girl and the ceremony is over. The boy, accompanied by his relations and friends, starts with his wife for his father's house and the marriage is over. Among the rich a marriage costs \u00a350 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 500-1000), among the middle class \u00a310 to \u00a320 (Rs. 100-200), and among the poor \u00a33 to \u00a36 (Rs. 30-60). Except infants and the very poor, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s burn the dead, and the chief mourners are held impure for ten days. They worship the usual Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, and their favourite deities are Bhav\u00e1ni, Khandoba, and Vithoba. In honour of Bhav\u00e1ni every ceremony ends with a gondhal dance. They keep the regular Br\u00e1hmanic fasts and feasts. Social disputes are settled at caste meetings, and breaches of caste rules are punished by a fine which generally takes the form of a caste dinner. Some of them send their boys to school, but as a class they are not well-to-do.\n\nM\u00e1lis, or Gardeners, are returned as numbering 24,539 and as found over the whole district. They have no subdivisions. The names in common use among men are \u00c1pa, Dhondi, Hari, Moru, and R\u00e1ma; and among women Bhima, Koyna, Krishna, and R\u00e1dha. They look and speak like Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis and do not differ from them in house, food, or dress. The only distinguishing marks of M\u00e1l\u00ed women are a red level line on the brow and a thick silver neck ornament called sari. M\u00e1l\u00eds are hardworking, good tempered, hospitable, and thrifty. They are gardeners, husbandmen, and in Government service, and their women help them both in tilling and in selling fruit, flowers, and vegetables. Like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s they keep the usual Br\u00e1hmanic fasts and feasts. Their priests are Deshashth Br\u00e1hmans who officiate at their houses. They have a spiritual teacher or guru who lives at Mungi Paithan and visits them once every two years. They make pilgrimages to \u00c1landi, Jejuri, Pandharpur, and Tulj\u00e1pur and believe in spirits and witchcraft. Their customs are the same as those of peasant Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.

The family washerwoman seats the boy in a square and rubs him with turmeric powder. She hands him a betel packet and asks him to bow before the house gods. A mutton feast is held in the evening when relations and friends are feasted. The boy is carried in procession to the girl\u2019s accompanied by men and women relations and music, and followed by his sister with a lighted dough lamp in her hands. When he reaches the girl\u2019s house a lemon and a cocoanut are waved round his head and cast on one side. The boy is bathed in warm water, dressed in new clothes, and, sitting with his wife near the sacrificial fire feeds it with butter, with the help of the priest.

They cannot tell when or why they came into the district or why they are considered a degraded class. They have no subdivisions and claim no relationship with any other tribe. They are dirty and hardworking, but not so\nrobust or strongly made as the Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs. They rank higher than them and their touch is held not so polluting. They speak Mar\u00e1thi and generally live inside of the village in miserable huts, and earn a living by making bamboo baskets, winnowing fans, birds' cages, children's cradles, and sieves. They dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and their staple food is grain, salt, chillies, and oil.

(4 as.) at a death. The priest suffers no degradation for associating with them and they observe the usual Br\u00e1hmanic fasts and feasts. They have no headman and employ an elder to settle social disputes. A Burud's shadow does not now-a-days pollute a high caste man. The Buruds are sending their boys to school. Some have succeeded in getting into Government service, while others go to Poona and Bombay in search of work. They are careful in money matters generally spending money in food, clothes, ornaments, and building houses. They are a declining race. Except in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and other large towns where they are fairly off, they are generally very poor.\n\nCh\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, or Leather Workers, are returned as numbering 16,105 and as found over the whole district. They have no tradition of their arrival in the district or of any earlier home. They are divided into local Kunbi Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, Dhors, Mochis, and Pardeshi-Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs who do not eat together or intermarry. Except that their habits are extremely dirty there is nothing to mark them from other low caste Hindus. Mochis and Pardeshis are found in large towns and the Pardeshis as their name implies seem to have come from Northern India. Local Kunbi Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs consider themselves and are held by others the highest class of leather workers. The Mochis make shoes, boots, and other leather articles. The village Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r in return for his services receives a contribution in grain from every landholder. It is his duty every year to present a pair of shoes to the village headman and the accountant or kulkarni. In some places they hold state grant or in\u00e1m and are found as cultivators. It is also their business to hold torches on the occasion of a\nmarriage at the house of the p\u00e1t\u00edl and of other respectable villagers. They mend the leather appliances used in husbandry and cobble shoes. They live in poor huts outside of villages and their house gear consists of earthen wooden and metal pots. Their clothes are waistcloths, woollen blankets, turbans, waistcoats, robes, and bodices. Their daily food is grain, salt, chillies, and oil.

The food is generally cooked by women and eaten by the men without taking off any of their clothes, the guests bringing their own plates. Liquor is sometimes given and the guests sometimes sit singing the whole night. Among them a man earns 3d. to 1s. (2-8 as.) and a woman 1\u00bdd. to 6\u00bdd. (1-4\u00bd as.) a day. The monthly expenses of a poor man are about 8s. (Rs. 4) and those of a fairly well-to-do person \u00a31 (Rs. 10). When they name their children they distribute molasses or gul and betel packets, and feast castewomen when a girl comes of age. At the betrothal the parents of the boy present the girl with clothes and ornaments.

They allow widow marriage and practise polygamy. A girl\u2019s wedding costs \u00a32 to \u00a34 (Rs. 20-40) and a boy\u2019s \u00a35 to \u00a36 (Rs. 50-60). They either bury or burn their dead, but a child under two is always buried. When they bury the body is laid in the grave with the turban and other clothes on, and the chief mourner, followed by the others of the party, throws over the corpse a handful of earth and closes the grave. When they burn, the chief mourner sets fire to the pile, walks thrice round it with an earthen water jar on his shoulders, in which a small hole has been pierced, dashes it on the ground, and beats his mouth with the palm of his hand. The funeral party bathe and return to the mourner\u2019s house and separate. Next day the spot where the deceased was buried is levelled, or if the body was burnt the ashes are thrown into water. On the tenth day rice or wheat balls are prepared and some of them are offered to the spirit of the deceased and thrown into the water and others are left to the crows. The funeral expenses, including a feast to relations and friends, do not exceed \u00a31 (Rs. 10). Their favourite gods are Khandoba, Jotiba, and Vithoba, whose images they have in their houses. They worship dead ancestors and snakes, and go on pilgrimage to Alandi and Pandharpur. They also worship Muhammadan saints, and have no holymen or s\u00e1dhus of their own. Their priests are ordinary Deshashth Br\u00e1hmans. They are paid 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) at a birth, 9d. to 2s. (Re. 3\u00bd - 1) at a marriage, and 6d. (\u00bc as.) at a death.

They have no headman and an old and intelligent member of the caste is always consulted in social disputes. Adultery and eating with people of lower caste\nis punished with expulsion. A Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r's shadow is not now-a-days thought unbearable by the higher classes. Some send their boys to school and have gained Government situations. Some go to Poona and Bombay and other places in search of work. The Mochis and Pardeshis are fairly off, but the Dhors and village Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs do little more than earn a living.\n\nGhis\u00e1'dis, or Tinkers, are returned as numbering 248, and as found over the whole district except in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, M\u00e1n, and V\u00e1lva.

For five days the mother and child bathe in hot water and in the evening of the fifth they name the child and treat castemen to liquor worth 2s. (Re. 1). When a marriage is settled the boy's father gives the castemen 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and the girl's father 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd), and it is spent in treating the caste to liquor.

They make and sell brass and copper vessels and put glass bangles on women\u2019s wrists. Some of them sell needles, thread, and miscellaneous articles, small wooden and tin boxes, glass and wooden beads, combs, dolls, and looking glasses. Others are moneylenders, cultivators, and Government servants. They worship the usual local and Br\u0101hmanic gods and goddesses, and observe the regular fasts and festivals, and never dine without bowing before their house images. Their priests are ordinary Mar\u0101tha Br\u0101hmans whom they highly respect. A woman goes to her father\u2019s for her first confinement. The goddess Satv\u0101i is worshipped on the fifth day after a birth and her image is tied round the child\u2019s neck. The mother and child are impure for ten days.

They send their boys to school but take them away as soon as they have learnt to read and write a little and a fair knowledge of arithmetic. Such of them as deal in pots are generally well-to-do and live in houses of the better sort; those who deal in bangles are poorer.\n\nKoshtis, or Weavers, are returned as numbering 8632 and as found over the whole district. They are believed to have originally come from Paithan and are divided into Mar\u0101tha Koshtis and\nLing\u00e1yat Koshtis who neither eat together nor intermarry. They are dark, middle-sized, and weak, and speak Mar\u00e1thi. Their houses are poor, and, besides a couple of handlooms, their house goods include some earthen and a few metal vessels. The Ling\u00e1yat Koshtis are strict vegetarians, and the Mar\u00e1tha Koshtis eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. Both classes dress like Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis. The Ling\u00e1yats wear the ling but not openly, hiding it in their turbans or waistcloth, or leaving it in some safe place in the house. The ling is given them by Jangams who are their priests and are worshipped by Koshtis on marriage occasions. They are sober thrifty and hardworking. They are weavers, a few cultivators, and others day-labourers, and are helped in their work by their women. The Ling\u00e1yat Koshtis worship Shiv only, while the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s worship the usual local and Br\u00e1hman gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and feasts. The priests of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are Br\u00e1hmans who conduct their marriages, while at the marriages of Ling\u00e1yat Koshtis both Br\u00e1hmans and Jangams officiate although the Jangams only are their priests. The customs of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are the same of those of Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis. The Ling\u00e1yats bury their dead and observe no mourning, while the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s burn their dead and they hold mourners impure for ten days. They have no headman and settle social disputes at caste meetings. Koshtis send their boys to school till they can read and write a little Mar\u00e1thi.

They dress like cultivating Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and are hard-working, thrifty, hospitable, and orderly. They make tiles, bricks, and earthen pots and figures of men and animals. Though their appliances are most simple, they are expert in making neat and partially ornamented articles. All the members of the family help in the work.

They worship the usual local and Br\u00e1manic gods and goddesses and their family deities are Mah\u00e1dev of Singnapur and Jagadamba whose shrine is in the old fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They keep the regular Hind\u00fa fasts and festivals and their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans whom they greatly respect. Among them a girl's father has to look out for a husband for his daughter. When one is found, a day before the marriage the boy and girl are rubbed with turmeric at their homes. The married women with music go to the waste lands and bring mango, jambhul, and fig leaves and tie them to a post in the booth. On the marriage day at both houses relations are feasted\non mutton, and the boy is seated on a horse and taken in procession to the girl's. On his way he alights at the village M\u00e1ruti's when five men pelt him with balls of wheat flour. He bows before the god, goes to the girl's house, and stands at the entrance of the booth. A relative of the girl's comes out, waves a cocoanut round his head, and dashes it on the ground. The boy alights, goes into the booth, and bathes. The Br\u00e1hman priest spreads half a pound of rice in the booth and on the rice sets five betel packets. Over each packet he places a copper, a piece of dry cocoa-kernel, and a turmeric root. The boy and girl stand on each side of the square facing each other and two near relations hold a cloth or nandicha-shela between them with three turmeric streaks traced in the middle of it.

If the girl's father is well-to-do, he performs his daughter's marriage at his own expense. If he is unable to bear the marriage charges, the boy's father pays him \u00a34 to \u00a35 (Rs. 40-50) as the price of the girl and persuades him to accept the offer. When both fathers agree, on a lucky day the boy's father with one or two friends visits the girl's house and presents her with a green robe and bodice and sometimes with a pair of silver chains if his means allow. The girl's father welcomes the guests and they are seated. The girl is dressed in the suit of clothes presented to her by the boy's father, and bows before him.

The boy and girl each at their homes, are seated on a low stool placed in a wheat square marked by the priest, and rubbed with turmeric by a lucky married girl who is named by the priest. They are then bathed and their brows are hung with a network of flowers and the turmeric rubbing ends with a feast called haldiche jevan or the turmeric feast to friends and kinsfolk. Next morning sandal, flowers, and wheat cakes are set before the family gods and the family-god worship or devkarya is complete. Invitations are sent to friends and relations. The bridegroom is dressed in rich clothes and taken on horseback to the bride\u2019s with music and friends. He halts on his way at the temple of the village Maruti, bows to the god, lays before him a copper and betel packet, again bows and asks his blessing. The girl\u2019s people meet him at the temple and present him with a turban or waistcloth. The bridegroom mounts his horse and rides to the girl\u2019s with music and friends and kinsmen. When he reaches the booth, a lemon and cocoanut are waved round his head and thrown on one side. He is then allowed to dismount and taken to a low stool set in a wheat square marked by the priest. As the lucky moment draws near, the bride comes out and stands facing the bridegroom, the priests hold a curtain marked with the lucky cross or nandi between them, and repeat marriage verses. The astrologer tells the lucky moment, the priests remove the curtain, the guests throw red rice over the couple\u2019s heads, and they are husband and wife.

At a widow marriage, the suitor gives the widow a robe and bodice for herself and a turban and \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) in cash for her father. On a lucky night the priest visits her house and conducts the ceremony about one hundred yards outside of the house in the presence of five or six men friends of the couple. The couple are seated on low stools in a wheat square marked by the priest, their brows are marked with vermilion, and rice grains are stuck on it, and they bow before the priest. The widow puts on toerings or jodvis but she is not allowed to wear the lucky necklace or mangalsutra. Married women are not allowed to see her for three days, after which a feast to friends and relations completes the ceremony. When a girl comes of age, she sits apart\nfor three days, and on the fourth is bathed, and her lap filled with rice and a cocoanut. On the seventh or tenth day, she is dressed in a new robe and bodice, her brow is decked with flowers, and rice cocoanut betel and fruit are laid in her lap. Friends and kinsfolk are treated to a dinner and the age-coming ceremony is over. Women as a rule go to their parents for their first confinement. When a woman is brought to bed a midwife is called in. She digs a bath-hole or n\u00e1h\u00e1ni in the lying-in room, cuts the child\u2019s navel-cord, puts it in an earthen vessel, and buries it in the bath-hole. The mother and child are daily bathed in warm water, rubbed with turmeric and oil, and laid on a cot, under which a firepot is set and sweet fennel or badishop and Ligasticum ajw\u00e6n or onva are burnt in the firepot. On the fifth night an embossed gold or silver image of Satv\u00e1ii is laid on a lowstool in the lying-in room, and flowers, turmeric paste, vermillion, cocoa-kernels, betel, burnt frankincense, and cooked rice, pulse, and vegetables are set before the low stool. The mother with the child in her arms bows before the goddess and next day the image is tied round the child\u2019s neck. On the twelfth the mother\u2019s impurity is over, the house is cowdunged and the mother\u2019s clothes are washed, new bangles are put round her wrists and she is dressed in a new robe and bodice. Women neighbours and friends meet at the mother\u2019s, lay rice and a cocoanut in her lap, present the child with a hood or ku\u0144chi, sing songs, and cradle and name the child. The guests are treated to a dinner; betel and boiled gram are served to them, and they withdraw. They burn or bury their dead and mourn ten days. The dead is bathed in warm water, dressed in a white sheet, and laid on a bier. If the deceased is a married woman she is dressed in a green robe and bodice. A roll of betel and a piece of gold are put into the dead mouth, the body is tied fast to the bier and covered with a white sheet, redpowder and betel leaves are thrown over the bier, and some married girl of the house, either a daughter or a daughter-in-law, waves lights round the dead, and with a low bow withdraws. The corpse-bearers tie a copper and a small cake to the hem of the shroud, lift the bier, and follow the chief mourner who takes the lead carrying the firepot hung from a string. On their way to the funeral ground, the mourners halt, throw the copper coin and the bread that were tied in the shroud to one side of the road, change places, lift the bier, and walk straight to some stream or river where they burn or bury the dead according to the chief mourner\u2019s means. The chief mourner has his head except the topknot and his face shaved. The funeral rites are over and the mourners bathe and go home. On the third day they gather the ashes of the dead and throw them into the river or stream. The chief mourner washes the spot where the dead was burned or buried with cowdung, sets a stone in the name of the dead at the place, lays sandal paste, flowers, vermillion, rice, burnt frankincense, and food before the stone and withdraws a little to see whether the crows touch the food. At last he bathes and returns home, and a caste feast ends the ceremony. P\u00e1thavrats do not ask Deshasth Br\u00e1hmans to their houses, but priests of their own class conduct their ceremonies, and receive a pair of shoes and 2s. (Re. 1) in cash at every death rite. When a woman dies in\nchildbed, she receives every mark of honour which a married woman ought to have. While she is being carried to the funeral ground, a man closely follows the corpse-bearers strewing the path with *r\u0101la* Panicum italicum seed that the spirit of the dead may not return and haunt the living.

Their tools cost them 12s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 6 - 50) and they earn 16s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 8 - 20) a month. Many are taking to other than their hereditary calling. Some are writers and others\npetty moneylenders, and moneychangers. Their calling depends on the prosperity of the people and since the 1876-77 famine, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-goldsmiths have had less than their former amount of employment. Even skilful workmen find it difficult to keep themselves in comfort. They are either Shaivs or Vaishnavs and have images of their gods in their houses. Their priests generally belong to their own caste, but when a priest of their own caste is not available they employ Deshasth or other Br\u00e1hmans. Of late the Son\u00e1rs who term themselves Mukhm\u00e1si Br\u00e1hmans, or Br\u00e1hmans sprung from the mouth of Brahma, have taken to commit to memory the sacred verses used in religious ceremonies, but they know them and pronounce them so badly that they do not openly repeat them in presence of Br\u00e1hmans. Their customs differ little from those of Br\u00e1hmans. They settle social disputes either at caste meetings or by a reference to a council of caste elders. They send their boys to school and are fairly off.\n\nS\u00fat\u00e1rs, or Carpenters, are returned as numbering 11,043 and as found over the whole district. They have no divisions. They rank with or higher than Kunbis and are fairer and cleaner than Kunbis but less robust. In villages they repair field tools and are paid by the villagers in grain at harvest time. As carpenters and woodcarvers the town S\u00fat\u00e1rs are good workers and are easily trained to handle European tools. Their day\u2019s wages vary form 1s. to 3s. (Rs.\u00bd-1\u00bd). The women do not help the men in their work. Their staple food is millet, pulse, and vegetables, and they do not eat fish or flesh or drink liquor. The men wear the waistcloth and coat, and the turban folded either in the Mar\u00e1tha or the Br\u00e1hman fashion. They gird their boys with the sacred thread, the ceremony being performed by one of their own caste called guru or teacher. They practise polygamy and forbid widow marriage. Except unweaned children whom they bury they burn their dead. Their family deities are Bhav\u00e1ni, Khandoba, and Vithoba, and they keep the usual Hindu fasts and festivals. Their priests are Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans whom they consult as to the lucky moment for naming and marrying their children. They settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school but take them away after they have learnt a little reading and writing. They are fairly off, especially town carpenters.\n\nTelis, or Oilmen, are returned as numbering 9499 and as found over the whole district. They are divided into Ling\u00e1yat and Mar\u00e1tha Telis who do not eat together or intermarry but do not differ much from each other in work, dress, or customs. As a rule Telis are dark well-built and robust, but dirty in their habits. They speak Mar\u00e1thi. They live in houses with walls of brick and tiled roofs and own metal and earthen vessels. Their staple food is millet pulse and vegetables. They dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and are hardworking, hospitable, quiet, and well-behaved. They press sesame, dry cocoa-kernel, and sometimes hemp seed, and sell oil and oilcakes. The Ling\u00e1yats worship Mah\u00e1dev only and their priests are Jangams; the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s worship all the usual local and Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and festivals,\nand employ as priests the ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans. Except that the Ling\u00e1yats hold no cloth or antarp\u00e1t between the bride and bridegroom at the time of marriage, their marriages are the same as those of Kunbis. Both Ling\u00e1yat and Mar\u00e1tha Telis hold a girl impure for four days after she comes of age, and do not touch her till she has bathed on the morning of the fifth day. Both practise widow marriage and polygamy. Unlike the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s they bury their dead, and consider themselves impure for ten days. They settle social disputes at caste meetings. They turn out any one proved to have broken their social rules but let him back on paying a fine. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, but are fairly off.\n\nVada\u0301rs, or Earth Diggers, are returned as numbering 2388 and as found over the whole district except in J\u00e1vli. They are divided into M\u00e1ti or Earth and Dagad or Stone Vad\u00e1rs, who eat together but do not intermarry. Both Earth and Stone Vad\u00e1rs are dark, strong, robust, and hardworking, but ignorant and given to drink. They have no fixed dwellings and gather wherever they hear of work. The Dagad or Stone Vad\u00e1rs who quarry and break stones for building are said to have been the great hill-fort builders. They also make grind-stones. The M\u00e1ti or Earth Vad\u00e1rs work in earth and dig ponds and wells. Both classes live in rude huts of mats and sticks, and eat almost anything, being notably fond of mice and rats. When they have nothing else to eat, they go rat-hunting in the fields. Their home tongue is Telugu, but with others they speak a corrupt Mar\u00e1thi. The men of both classes wear a loincloth, a waistcloth, and a tattered turban, and the women the robe and bodice. Their chief deities are Bhav\u00e1ni and Khandoba, and they consult Br\u00e1hmans only for a name for their children and for a lucky day for their weddings. They practise widow marriage and polygamy. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They do not send their boys to school. Of late years Vad\u00e1rs of both classes have found constant and highly paid employment at the great Nira water works and on the new Deccan railways. At both water and railway works Vad\u00e1rs have proved the most valuable class of local workmen. They work by the piece, and both men and women are surprisingly effective. Most of their earnings go in drink.\n\nMusicians include three classes with a strength of 11,909 or 1\u00b716 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musicians, 1881. |\n|------------------------|\n| **Division** | **Males** | **Females** | **Total** |\n| Ghadsis | 309 | 300 | 609 |\n| Guravs | 4920 | 4779 | 9699 |\n| Hol\u00e1rs | 813 | 788 | 1601 |\n| **Total** | **6042** | **5867** | **11,909** |\n\nGhadsis, or Musicians, are returned as numbering 609 and as found in large towns chiefly in the east of the district. They have no tradition of their origin or of any former settlement, and are considered\nthe earliest people in the district. They have no subdivisions and claim no relationship with any other tribe. They are darker than Kunbis, middle sized, and look more like M\u00e1ngs and other low caste Hindus than Kunbis. The men wear the topknot, moustache, and sometimes whiskers, but not the beard. They speak Mar\u00e1thi. Their staple food is millet, salt, chillies, and oil, and their dinner parties consist of meat, pulse cakes, and liquor. They eat without taking off any of their clothes, and, after dinner, sit singing the whole night. They dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, are lazy, extravagant, and fond of pleasure, and amuse their patrons with their songs and music. They are renowned singers and players and perform at the houses of Br\u00e1hmans and other Hindus. Though their shadow is not now thought to defile, high caste Hindus do not so freely ask them to their houses as they ask Guravs. The hereditary calling of all seems to have been music, but many have taken to agriculture, day labour, and other means of subsistence. They paint their bodies red and black and beg by acting as Bahurupis or men of many faces or characters. As labourers men earn 3d. to 1s. (2-8 as.) a day and women 1\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (1-3 as.). Their monthly expenses vary from 8s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 4-10). They marry their girls between eight and twelve and their boys between twelve and twenty-five. They spend \u00a33 to \u00a34 (Rs. 30-40) on the marriage of a girl and \u00a34 to \u00a36 (Rs. 40-60) on the marriage of a boy. They allow their widows to marry and the men practise polygamy. They either bury or burn their dead spending about \u00a31 (Rs. 10) on a funeral. They worship all the usual local and Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, chiefly Bahiroba and Khandoba, and they keep all the regular fasts and feasts. Their priests are ordinary Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans whom they pay 1\u00bdd. (1 as.) at a naming, 2s. (Re. 1) at a marriage, and 6d. (4 as.) at a funeral. Child marriage, polygamy, and widow marriage are allowed and practised; polyandry is unknown. Their social and religious customs are the same as Mar\u00e1tha-Kunbi customs. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school and are a steady people.\n\nGuravs, or Priests, are returned as numbering 9699 and as found in ones and twos in towns and large villages. They have no tradition or memory of their arrival in the district or of any former settlement. They have no divisions and speak Mar\u00e1thi. They generally live in small one-storeyed houses close to the temple where they act as ministrants. Their staple food is millet, rice, pulse, and vegetables, and they say they neither eat fish nor flesh nor drink liquor. They dress either like Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans or cultivating Kunbis. They are musicians and attend to and clean the temples of the village gods and have the hereditary right to the offerings made to them. They supply bel and tulsi leaves and flowers to the chief villagers for the worship of their house gods. They make and sell leaf cups and plates and play music on marriage and other occasions at the houses of Br\u00e1hmans and other villagers, except at the houses of Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and other low caste people. A few hold small grant or in\u00e1m lands. They worship M\u00e1runi, Shiv, and other village gods, keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts, and make pilgrimages. When a Gurav woman is brought to bed, a midwife is\ncalled in and is paid 3d. (2 as.) if the child is a boy and half a cocoanut if it is a girl. The midwife cuts the child's navel-cord, bathes both the mother and the child with warm water rubbing them with turmeric paste and oil, and lays them on a cot under which a firepot is laid to guard against cold. The mother's impurity lasts ten days. On the fifth night an embossed gold image of Satvai is set on a low stool in the lying-in room and turmeric paste, vermilion, five betel leaves and nuts, boiled gram or ghugris, and sweetmeats are laid before the goddess. The mother bows before the goddess with the child in her arms and asks her blessing. Next day the embossed image is tied round the child's neck and the child if a girl is named on the twelfth and if a boy on the thirteenth. The house is crowded on the naming day and friends and kinspeople are asked to the house. The mother is dressed in a new green robe and bodice, new bangles are put round her wrists, and rice and a cocoanut are laid in her lap. Women neighbours and friends present the mother with bodices and the child with hoods or kunchis, and name and cradle the child, amidst cradle-songs or p\u00e1m\u00e1s sung in honour of R\u00e1m or Krishna, ending with the chorus 'Sleep my darling sleep.'1 The guests are treated either to a dinner or to betel and withdraw with handfuls of boiled gram or ghugris.\n\nGuravs marry their boys between ten and twenty-five and their girls before they come of age. Their marriages are preceded by betrothals, when, on a lucky day named by the village astrologer, the boy's father with a few of his friends visits the girl's house and presents her with a green robe and bodice and a pair of silver chains or s\u00e1nkhlis worth \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 25-30). The guests are welcomed to a seat on the veranda by the girl's father and such of his friends as he has asked to the house. The girl puts on the new clothes, the priest attends, and the boy's father marks the girl's brow with vermilion. The girl then bows before the house gods, the guests, and her elders, and the betrothal or m\u00e1gni ends with a feast to the boy's father and his friends. The fathers go to the local astrologer and he names the lucky day for the marriage. Booths are raised before the boy's and girl's houses and invitations are sent to friends and kinsfolk. At the house of each of the pair, an umbar Ficus glomerata post is fixed in one of the corners of the booth, molasses and betel are laid before the post, and a turmeric root and betelnut are tied to it in a piece of yellow cloth. Two or three days before the marriage, the girl is rubbed with turmeric at her house by five lucky married women named by the priest, who take what remains of the turmeric to the boy with music and rub him with it and bathe him in warm water, while musicians play and the married women of the boy's house sing songs. A feast called the turmeric feast or haldiche jevan completes the turmeric rubbing, and the women of the girl's house return with presents of betel. A raised altar is prepared in the girl's wedding booth and new earthen vessels brought from the potter's are placed at its corners. On the marriage day the bride goes with music and a band of friends.\n\n1 The Mar\u00e1thi is: Jo jo, re ni j bala, jo jo.\nto the village M\u00e1ruti, bows before the god, and, laying before him a betel packet and a copper, asks his blessing and returns home. The bridegroom goes on horseback to the bride's with music and friends, and is welcomed at her house by the girl's father. As the lucky moment draws near, the priest prepares a square spot, sets two low stools in it, and makes the bridegroom and bride stand facing each other on the stools; a yellow sheet is held between the pair and marriage verses are repeated by the priest who, at the lucky moment, draws aside the curtain, throws red rice over the couple, while the musicians raise a din of music. The hems of the pair's garments are knotted together, and they walk into the house, bow before the house gods and elders, and are made to eat from the same dish. Then the s\u00e1da or robe ceremony is performed, and the party of the bridegroom and the caste people are treated to a dinner. Lastly the bridegroom takes the bride to his house with music and friends and feasts and return feasts at the houses of the boy and girl end the ceremony. At every marriage the priest receives a turban and 4s. to 6s. (Rs.2-3) in cash and the whole marriage expenses generally amount to \u00a310 to \u00a330 (Rs.100-300). Among Guravs child marriage and polygamy are allowed and polyandry is unknown. A girl sits apart for three days on coming of age, she is bathed on the fourth and her lap is filled with rice and fruit. A gaily decked wooden frame is made and the girl is seated in it for the first sixteen days while the musicians are asked to the house to play drums and pipes. Her female friends and relations present the girl with sweet dishes and clothes, and her father and father-in-law present her each with a robe and bodice. The girl's father treats his son-in-law to a dinner and presents him with clothes and bedding. The couple are seated together on low wooden stools, the women neighbours meet at the house, and lay rice and cocoanuts in the lap of the girl, and the puberty ceremony is over. Guravs burn their dead and mourn ten days. After death the body is seated leaning against a wall, water is heated, and a bier is made. The dead is bathed in warm water, shrouded in a clean white sheet, and laid on the bier. A piece of gold and a roll of betel leaves are put into the dead mouth, and flowers, betel leaves, and redpowder are thrown over the body. A married girl, generally the deceased's daughter or daughter-in-law, waves a light about the face of the dead, four of the mourners take up the bier, and the chief mourner heads them with the earthen firepot in his hand, hung from a string. Before reaching the burning ground they halt to rest, the bearers set down the bier, and each picks five stones and instead lays a copper on the ground. The bearers then change places, lift the bier, and, with the chief mourner in front, walk to the burning ground. The pile is ready and the dead is laid on it. The priest repeats texts and the chief mourner places five wheat flour balls on the body, two on the face two on the two arms and one on the chest, and lights the pile. As soon as the skull bursts, the chief mourner fills an earthen pot, and, carrying it on his shoulder, walks three times round the pile. At the end of each turn another man walks with him and pierces the pot with a stone called the lifestone or ashma so that the\nwater gushes out. When three turns are made and the pot is thrice pierced, the chief mourner throws it over his back and beats his mouth with his right palm. The priest is given 3d. (2 as.) and the funeral party bathe and return home. The family of the dead are impure for ten days and cleanse themselves by drinking water brought from the priest's. On the third day the chief mourner goes to the burning ground, gathers the ashes, and throws them into some river or stream. He cowdungs the burning place, sets the lifestone on it, and lays before the stone sandal, vermillion, flowers, turmeric, burnt frankincense, and cooked rice mixed with clarified butter. The chief mourner has his face and head except the topknot shaved and the caste people including the bearers are feasted on the thirteenth if the dead has a son or on the twelfth if he has no son. The priest conducts the death ceremony and receives clothes, a pair of shoes, and 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2-3) in cash. Guravs hold that persons dying with their wishes unfulfilled become spirits and haunt the living. They believe in witchcraft soothsaying and evil spirits. When a woman dies in childbirth, while she is being taken to the burning ground, nails are driven into the threshold, a lemon charmed by a magician is buried under it and a man follows the body strewing r\u0101la seeds, that the spirit may not come back and trouble the people of the house. Guravs have a caste council and settle social disputes at meetings of the elders. A few send their boys to school, but they take to no new pursuits and are badly off.\n\nHol\u0101rs, literally Field Men, are returned as numbering 1601 and as found over the whole district except in J\u0101vli. They have no story of their origin and no memory of any former settlement. Their K\u0101narese name and its apparent derivation from hol (K.) the ground seem to show that they are one of the early local tribes. They have no subdivisions and claim no relationship with any other tribe. They are the same as Mh\u0101rs with whom they eat and marry. They speak Mar\u0101thi, and live in houses with mud walls and tiled roofs. Their house goods include earthen, wooden, and metal pots. Their staple food is millet, salt, chillies, and oil, but they eat the flesh of almost all animals including the cow and excluding the pig. Like Mh\u0101rs they eat the flesh of cattle who are found dead. In honour of birth, marriage, and death they give dinners of meat, pulse cakes, and liquor. Their women cook, and the guests dine off plates which they bring with them and without taking off any of their clothes. Liquor is sometimes served and the guests sit singing the whole night. Their dress is the same as that of Kunbis. They are a quiet and orderly people, are excellent musicians and songsters, and play on pipes and drums. They make shoes and bridles and as labourers the men earn 3d. to 1s. (2-8 as.) and the women 1\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (1-3 as.) a day. The monthly expenses of a family of five vary from 8s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 4-10). Their favourite gods are Jotiba, Khandoba, and Vithoba whose images they keep in their houses. They worship their deceased ancestors and make pilgrimages to Pandharpur and Ratnagiri in the South Konkan. They have no ascetics among them. Their priests are the ordinary village Br\u0101hmans who are paid 1\u00bdd. (1 as.) at a birth 2s. (Re.1) at a marriage, and 6d. (4 as.) at a death. The Br\u0101hman who\nconducts their ceremonies, standing outside of their houses does not suffer degradation for associating with them. They keep all the usual Hindu fasts and feasts. When they name their children they distribute molasses or gul, and when a girl comes of age they distribute packets of betelnut and leaves among friends and kinsfolk, and feast castewomen. They marry their girls between eight and twelve, and their boys between twelve and twenty-five. A girl's marriage costs \u00a33 to \u00a34 (Rs. 30-40) and a boy's \u00a35 to \u00a36 (Rs. 50-60). They practise widow marriage and polygamy. They bury their dead, spending about \u00a31 (Rs. 10) on the funeral. They have no headman and leave the settlement of disputes to some of their elders. Adultery and eating with a low caste man are punished with loss of caste, but the offender is let back on paying a fine which generally takes the form of liquor. A Hol\u00e1r's shadow is not now thought to pollute the higher classes. A few send their boys to school and are a miserable class.\n\nServants include two classes with a strength of 21,891 or 2\u00b713 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division | Males | Females | Total |\n|----------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Nh\u00e1vis   | 7077  | 7174    | 14,251|\n| Parits   | 3811  | 3832    | 7640  |\n| Total    | 10,888| 11,003  | 21,891|\n\nNh\u00e1vis, or Barbers, are returned as numbering 14,251 and as found over the whole district. Playing on their name they say they are born from Mah\u00e1dev's navel or ndbhi. According to another account they have sprung from a Br\u00e1hman father and a Kunbi woman who was not his wife. They have no divisions and their surnames are G\u00e1ikav\u00e1d, J\u00e1dhav, Mohite, Pov\u00e1r, and Shirke. They look like Kunbis and their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi. They live in middle class houses generally one-storeyed with walls of brick and tiled roofs. Their staple food is millet, pulse, and vegetables, and they eat fish and flesh, and drink liquor. Both men and women dress like Kunbis. As a class they are intelligent, fond of gossip, and proverbially cunning, as the proverb says The barber and the crow. They shave, hold torches at weddings and before great men, and play the drum or chaughada and the clarion or sanai. In almost every village a Nh\u00e1vi holds grant lands. As surgeons they bleed both by cupping and applying leeches, and their women act as midwives. Their family gods are Jotiba of Ratn\u00e1giri and Khandoba of Jejuri. Their manners and customs are the same as those of Kunbis. They are bound together by a strong caste feeling and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They do not send their boys to school and are a steady people.\n\nParits, or Washermen, are returned as numbering 7640 and as found over the whole district. They are divided into K\u00e1m\u00e1thi, Kunbi, and Pardeshi Parits who neither eat together nor intermarry.\n\n1 The Mar\u00e1thi runs, Nh\u00e1vu \u00e1ni K\u00e1vu.\nK\u00e1m\u00e1thi Parits say they came to the district from the Niz\u00e1m's country more than two generations ago. They have no divisions and their surnames are Alakonda, Angirvaru, Bilkor, Kotgirvaru, and Pipalgavvaru; families bearing the same surname eat together but do not intermarry. The names in ordinary use among men are B\u00e1lu, D\u00e1vu, Iraiya, K\u00e9d\u00e1ri, Lingu, Manh\u00e1ji, and R\u00e1maya; and among women Bhagamma, Ganga, Lingi, Narsamma, Shiva, and Vyakamma. Their home speech is Telugu, but with others they speak Mar\u00e1thi or Hindust\u00e1ni. A K\u00e1m\u00e1thi Parit is easily known by his custom of wearing a gold earring in the left ear, and a K\u00e1m\u00e1thi washerwoman by her peculiar way of wearing the robe. The robe in front is gathered into scanty puckers and is passed back between the legs being drawn tightly over the shins and tucked in at the waist behind. The upper end of the robe is passed round the waist and is drawn over the breast and head. They are dark and strong and live either in houses one storey high with tiled roofs or in thatched huts. Their houses are well kept and contain goods, along with the appliances of their calling, worth about \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Their staple food is millet, split pulse, and vegetables. They are also fond of fish and flesh and sometimes add these two dishes to their daily food. The only sweet dish they know is the gram cake or puran poli and this they use on ceremonial occasions. They offer goats and cocks to their gods and feast on the flesh of the sacrificed animals. They drink liquor. The men dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in a waistcloth, coat, shouldercloth, Mar\u00e1tha turban and shoes, and the women in the robe and bodice. The men's ornaments are earrings worth 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5-10), silver finger rings worth 4s. (Rs. 2), and a silver waist girdle worth \u00a33 (Rs. 30). The women's ornaments are a nosering worth \u00a31 (Rs. 10), earrings worth \u00a33 (Rs. 30), the lucky necklace or mangalsutra worth 6s. to 16s. (Rs. 3-8), silver bracelets worth \u00a31 (Rs. 10), and toerings of bell-metal worth 6d. (4 as.) K\u00e1m\u00e1thi Parits are neat, clean, hardworking, thrifty, and orderly. They work as washermen and earn \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 15-20) a month out of which they spend 10s. to 16s. (Rs. 5-8) on charcoal soda and soap. The women and children help the men in their work. They have two sets of gods, one including Narsoba and Yallamma their family deities who are kept in a wooden shrine, and the other including \u00c1tmasamma, B\u00e1lamma, Bangar, Maissamma, and Pochamma, who are placed in a niche or devli in a wall in the house. Their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans. They are not particular about keeping fasts, only a few fasting on the Ek\u00e1dashis or lunar elevenths of each month. Their religious head, a man of their own caste, lives at Haidarabad and occasionally visits his disciples. An elderly woman of the family acts as midwife and buries the navel-cord and after-birth in a hole in the mother's room, over which the mother and child are bathed regularly for twelve days and rubbed with turmeric powder and oil. On the fifth day an image of the goddess Satv\u00e1i and an earthen water jar are worshipped near the bathing pit, and five pieces of dry cocoa-kernel, redpowder, turmeric, and betel and cooked food are offered. The mother is held impure full eleven days. On the twelfth all the house people are bathed, and their clothes\nwashed, the house is cowdunged and cow's urine drunk. Near female relations gather at the mother's house, cradle and name the child, and the guests retire with presents of boiled wheat and gram. In the evening castemen are treated to liquor. Except that they marry their children sitting side by side on rice and that their maternal uncles stand behind holding in their hands sickles or weeding hoes, their marriages are the same as those of Kunbis. Their marriages cost about \u00a315 (Rs. 150). They allow widow marriage, the whole expense, about \u00a34 (Rs. 40), being paid by the widow's husband. They bury their dead, mourn ten days, and spend \u00a32 to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 20-25) on the funeral. On the third day they level the spot where the deceased was buried and mark it with a red stone. On the twelfth the caste is given a dinner. K\u00e1m\u00e1th\u00ed Parits hold caste councils, send their boys to school, and are better off than Kunbi Parits.\n\nKunbi Parits have no divisions, speak Mar\u00e1thi, and differ in no respect from Kunbis. They live in huts with thatched roofs and their staple food is millet, pulse, and vegetables. They eat fish and the flesh of goats, sheep, hare, deer, and fowls, and drink liquor. The village washerman is generally a Kunbi and is locally known as Parit. He washes for all the villagers except Mh\u00e1rs and M\u00e1ngs and other impure castes, and the men are helped in their work by their women. Besides by cleaning clothes, Parits sometimes earn their living by labour. They are found in every village and are paid in grain. Their favourite deities are Bahiropa, Bhav\u00e1ni, and Khandoba, and they also worship deceased ancestors. Their priests are the ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans and they keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts. Their customs are the same as Kunbi customs, they either bury or burn their dead and allow widow marriage. They settle social disputes at caste meetings. They do not send their boys to school and are poor and in debt.\n\nOf Pardeshi or Bundele Dhonis one family is found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the service of Europeans. They say they came from Upper India, but in appearance and speech differ little from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The names in common use among men are Krishna, R\u00e1ma, Lakshuman, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, and Sakhar\u00e1m; and among women J\u00e1nki, Lakshumi, Mohana, Munya, and R\u00e1dha. In house, food, dress, and religion they differ little from Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis. They are washermen and follow no other calling. They marry their girls before they are sixteen or eighteen and their boys before they are twenty-five. They burn their dead, mourn ten days, hold caste councils, send their boys to school, and like Mar\u00e1tha or Kunbi Parits are poor.\n\nShepherds and Cattle-keepers include two classes with a strength of 41,866 or 4\u00b708 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division | Males | Females | Total |\n|----------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Dhangars | 20,824| 20,728  | 41,547|\n| Gavlis   | 170   | 149     | 319   |\n| Total    | 20,994| 20,872  | 41,866|\n\nDhangars, literally Cowmen, are returned as numbering 41,547 and as found chiefly in the J\u00e1vli and P\u00e1tan hills and uplands. They\nhave no tradition of their coming to the district and no memory of any former settlement. They are darker than Kunbis, tall and athletic. Many of Shivaji's infantry were Satara Dhangars. Still though good soldiers they are a quiet orderly tribe. Most of them have their head-quarters in the east of the district, keep sheep and deal in wool. In the fair months they travel long distances westward to the hills many going on to the Konkan. They come back before the end of the hot weather when most of them make their way to the east, as, during the rains, the raw damp of the western hills is fatal to sheep. During the fair season as they graze over the country the landholders, for the sake of the manure, often pay them to pen their flocks in the fields. They have dogs of a better breed than the ordinary village dog. As a class Dhangars are noted for their dirty slovenly habits. Though most of those whose head-quarters are in the east and who keep their flocks in the east during the rainy season are shepherds, cow and buffalo-keeping Dhangars on the western hills are not uncommon. Cow-keeping Dhangars chiefly earn their living by the sale of clarified butter. Some among them also are husbandmen. Some settled Dhangars are fairly off but as a class they are poor. From the time their boys are five years of age they are generally employed in watching the cattle. They eat flesh and drink liquor. Their clothing is scanty, the men wearing a turban, a waistcloth, and a blanket, together costing about 6s. (Rs. 3) a year. Their marriage ceremonies and rites are nearly the same as those of Kunbis. Their chief gods are Khandoba and Mhasoba; Biroba is their tutelary house god and his image is buried with the bodies of the well-to-do. They do not worship their house gods daily, only on Saturdays and Sundays. Social disputes are settled by the members of three families: the Gavandes, Manes, and Ragjes. If one of them is not at hand, he is sent for and the dispute stands over till he comes. Breaches of caste rules are punished by making the offender give a caste feast. The Dhangars never send their boys to school and take to no new callings.\n\nGavlis, or Cowkeepers, are returned as numbering 319 and as found over the whole district. They rank higher than Kunbis, and are clean, orderly, shrewd, honest, and skilful in treating cattle diseases, and in breeding cows and buffaloes. Their customs do not differ from Kunbi customs and they keep the usual Hindu fasts and feasts. They hold caste councils, send their boys to school, and are fairly off.\u00b9\n\nFishers include two classes with a strength of 7068 or 0\u00b776 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division | Males | Females | Total |\n|----------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Bhois    | 1043  | 1035    | 2078  |\n| Kolis    | 2930  | 2060    | 4990  |\n| Total    | 3973  | 3095    | 7068  |\n\nBhois, or Fishers, are returned as numbering 2978 and as found over the whole district. They are dark, good-looking, sturdy, and\n\n\u00b9 Details of Gavli customs are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\nhardworking. Most of them make their living by catching fish. One of their chief former occupations was carrying palanquins and litters, but, with the opening of roads, litters have nearly disappeared and they have taken to agriculture, fishing, and labour. They now profess to look down on palanquin carrying. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They rank below Kolis, but do not differ from them in marriage and other customs. They hold caste councils, do not send their boys to school, and are a poor people.\n\nKolis, or Ferrymen, are returned as numbering 4990 and as found in almost every village, especially in J\u00e1vli, P\u00e1tan, and parts of W\u00e1i. All S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Kolis are water-fillers or p\u00e1nbharis. They seem to be different from the Poona and Ahmadnagar hill Kolis, the origin of whose name is doubtful. Besides P\u00e1nbharis, they are called Chumli Kolis from wearing a twisted cloth on their head when they carry a waterpot. They are said to associate and occasionally to eat with Kunbis. In several of the chief hill forts, Sinhgad, Torna, and R\u00e9jgad, men of this tribe formerly had the duty of guarding the approaches to the fort. They are quiet people ranking among village servants and get the grain in return for bringing water. Unlike the Kolis of Khed and Junnar in Poona, they do not join in gang robberies or become outlaws. They are the same as Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis to look at, but they do not generally eat in the same row with Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis and they marry among themselves only. They make the cement which is eaten with betel and a few of them catch fish. As a class they are a fine, good-looking, robust, and well made people. They are now quiet, orderly, settled, and hardworking. Besides fishing they work ferries along the Krishna and in the rainy months show great daring in securing timber floated down when the river is in flood. They grow melons in river beds with much skill and are found in every village as water fillers or p\u00e1nbharis; some are husbandmen and others cement dealers. They generally live in thatched huts, eat fish and flesh, and drink liquor. Their social and religious customs are like those of Kunbis. They usually bury the dead, and the chief mourner is held impure for ten days. Their favourite gods are Biroba and Khandoba, and their priests are Br\u00e1hmans whom they greatly respect. They hold caste councils, and do not send their boys to school. In some villages they hold grant or in\u00e1m lands in return for their services as water carriers. As a class they are poor.\n\nThe bulk of the unskilled labour of the district is done by the poorer Kunbis, Dhangars, Vad\u00e1rs, R\u00e1moshis, and Mh\u00e1rs. Besides these, two small classes, who are chiefly labourers, Pardeshis and Th\u00e1kurs have a strength of 1603. The details are:\n\n| Division     | Males | Females | Total |\n|--------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Pardeshis    | 617   | 573     | 1190  |\n| Th\u00e1kurs      | 207   | 206     | 413   |\n| Total        | 824   | 779     | 1603  |\n\nDetails of Koli customs are given in the Poona and Ahmadnagar Statistical Accounts.\nPardeshis,\u00b9 or Outsiders that is Upper India Men, are returned as numbering 1190 and as found over the whole district. They are tall strong and well made, the men wearing the topknot and moustache and sometimes the beard and whiskers. Their home tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni, and they are sober thrifty and proud. They are priests to their own people, watchmen, messengers, shopkeepers, petty traders, and labourers. They own no dwellings, and their staple food is wheat, butter, pulse, and vegetables. The men dress in a short waistcloth, jacket, cap, and sometimes a turban folded in Mar\u00e1tha fashion, and pointed shoes. They are Sm\u00e1rts, worship the usual Br\u00e1hmanic deities and keep the regular fasts and feasts. Few of them bring their families with them. As a class they are well-to-do.\n\nTh\u00e1kurs,\u00b2 or Chiefs, are returned as numbering 413 and as found over the whole district except in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division. They say the founder of their tribe was one Gang\u00e1r\u00e1m Bhat and have no tradition of coming into the district or of any former settlement. Their surnames are Chav\u00e1n, G\u00e1ikv\u00e1d, More, Pov\u00e1r, and Sinde. The men\u2019s names are Ganu, Lakshuman, Mah\u00e1du, and R\u00e1ma, and the women\u2019s Bhima, Kondi, Lakshumi, and Rukhmi. Except that they are darker skinned, in appearance, dwelling, food, and dress they do not differ from Kunbis. Their home speech is Mar\u00e1thi. They are a quiet, hardworking, thrifty, and hospitable people, and are husbandmen, labourers, and messengers. They rank below Kunbis, and eat with them but not in the same row. They marry among themselves. They are among the village staff of baluted\u00e1rs or servants. Among the Kunbis, when the father goes to see the boy or girl before marriage, he takes the village Th\u00e1kur with him. The Th\u00e1kur is also sometimes sent when the father does not himself go. The Th\u00e1kur is used as a messenger and calls the name of the giver at marriages when presents or \u00e1hers are made, and when the present is a turban helps the bridegroom to put it on. On the thirteenth day after a death, when friends bring in the mourning turban or dughavta, the Th\u00e1kur helps the chief mourner to put it on, and is given a copper and betelnut with four leaves. Their family gods are Bahiroba and Khandoba, and their ceremonies are conducted by their own castemen and not by Br\u00e1hmans. On the fifth day after the birth of a child they worship the goddess Satv\u00e1i, and offer her redpowder, lampblack, cocoa-kernel, betel, and millet bread, pulse, and vegetables. In the evening near relations and castemen are feasted on bread and pulse sauce, and on the following morning the goddess Satv\u00e1i, which is generally a\n\n\u00b9 Details of Pardeshi customs are given in the Shol\u00e1pur Statistical Account.\n\u00b2 The name Th\u00e1kur properly belongs to Gujar\u00e1t Rajputs. In N\u00e1sik it is used of three classes the writers who in Gujar\u00e1t are known as Brahmakshatris, a class of carpenters from Gujar\u00e1t, and the hill tribe who are most numerous in Th\u00e1na and Kol\u00e1ba, and are also found in Poona Ahmadnagar and Kh\u00e1ndesh. The N\u00e1sik use of the word Th\u00e1kur to two classes who claim a part Gujar\u00e1t Rajput origin favours the late Dr. J. Wilson\u2019s view that the Th\u00e1na hill Th\u00e1kurs got their name because they were at some time joined and led by Gujar\u00e1t Rajput outlaws. As they are closely connected with Bhats these S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Th\u00e1kurs, who seem to have nothing to do with any of their namesakes, have probably some Gujar\u00e1t strain.\nround piece of silver, is tied round the child\u2019s neck. On the morning of the twelfth day the house is cowdunged, the mother\u2019s clothes are washed, and the child and its mother are bathed. The mother, taking the child in her arms, sets five pebbles in front of her house and worships them with turmeric and redpowder, lays betel and molasses before them, and goes back into the house. A couple of married women who are asked to dine, cradle and name the child, and retire with presents of betel and boiled gram. Except that their own caste people conduct their marriages and repeat the marriage verses, their marriages do not differ from those of Kannbis. The five days after a girl comes of age is the only occasion on which their monthly sickness is held to make women unclean. Their marriages cost the boy\u2019s parents \u00a310 (Rs. 100) and their deaths \u00a31 (Rs. 10). They allow their widows to marry and they burn their dead. They have a caste council and settle social disputes at caste meetings. A few among them send their boys to school and as a class they are poor.\n\nUnsettled Tribes include three classes with a strength of 20,000 or 1.95 per cent of the Hindu population.

A few of them send their boys to school.\n\nVanj\u00e1ris, or Caravan Men, are returned as numbering 2046 and as found over the whole district except in J\u00e1vli, Koregaon, P\u00e1tan, and W\u00e1i. They say they were once Ling\u00e1yats and tell the following story of how they became followers of Khandoba. The founder of their clan while travelling with his bullocks grew weary, took their loads off his bullocks, and sat under a tree to rest. A V\u00e1ghya or devotee of Khandoba passing by, advised him to keep that day, the sixth of M\u00e1rga-shirsh or November-December sacred to Khandoba. The Vanj\u00e1ri, who did not wish to leave his own faith, sat silent. When he was rested he put his hands on one of the loads, and found it so heavy that he could not lift it. He asked the V\u00e1ghya how the load was so heavy. The V\u00e1ghya said, Offer a sheep to Khandoba and the load will be lighter. The Vanj\u00e1ri offered a sheep, moved the load with ease, and became a follower of Khandoba. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Vanj\u00e1ris say they have no subdivisions.

The women do not wear false hair, but tie their hair in a knot behind the head or plait it into a braid.\n\nMh\u00e1rsasa class are hardworking, quiet, frugal, hospitable, and honest, but hot-tempered and dirty. In villages they serve as messengers, carrying letters from the village to the sub-divisional head-quarters and aid the headman or p\u00e1til and the accountant or kulkarni in calling meetings of villagers and performing other official duties. They are also given presents for services they render as village servants and are generally husbandmen and labourers. They remove dead cattle from the village and eat their flesh giving the skin to the hereditary or vatand\u00e1r village Mh\u00e1r. They bury the bodies of villagers or strangers who have no relations or friends, dig graves, and carry firewood to the burning ground receiving the grave clothes in return. To perform their Government duties they every year choose a headman called tar\u00e1l and serve under his orders. This tar\u00e1l is subordinate to the mehtar, the general head of the Mh\u00e1rs. The Murli Mh\u00e1rs and the Jogti Mh\u00e1rs are not included among village servants and live by begging. A Mh\u00e1r\u2019s shadow is not now thought to defile and they do not carry a jar round their necks to spit in. Except during the rainy season the Mh\u00e1rs work all the year. Their busy season is about Div\u00e1li in October-November and they rest on all holidays. Gavsi Mh\u00e1rs worship the usual local and Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, especially Khandoba and Mah\u00e1lakshmi. The Murli Mh\u00e1rs worship no god but Khandoba, and the Jogti Mh\u00e1rs worship the goddess Yallamma. Many at stated times visit Pandharpur to pay homage to Vithoba and \u00c1landi to do honour to Jny\u00e1neshvar. They have a religious teacher of their own class who wears a tulsi bead necklace, and any one who wishes to ask his advice has to present him with a waistcloth, a turban, and 8s. (Rs. 4) in cash. They have a priest of their own caste called pandit or learned whom they pay 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) at a birth, 2s. (Re. 1) at a marriage, and 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) at a death. They keep Saturday Sunday and Tuesday and the lunar elevenths in \u00c1sh\u00e1dh or July-August and Shr\u00e1van or August-September as fast days. They believe in spirits, and hold that persons dying of an accident or with unfulfilled wishes turn into spirits and haunt the living. They enter men women children and cattle, and leave only when what they ask for is given them. They have no such distinction as outdoor and house spirits. Mh\u00e1rs have no midwife, any old woman in the house helps the mother.\nThe navel cord and after-birth are buried in a pit in the lying-in room and the mother and child are bathed at the pit every day. On the third day after the birth comes the *tikondi* or third day ceremony when five married women are feasted. On the fifth day comes the *panchvi* or fifth day ceremony when a large earthen jar is set near the house door and filled with water by as many elderly women as the child\u2019s father can afford to feast. A silver or copper image of the goddess Satvai is placed in a winnowing fan and before it are laid turmeric and red-powder and a cocoanut. The mother with her child in her arms makes a low bow before it and a feast is held when rice and bread are served.\n\nOn the twelfth day the *barisi* or twelfth day ceremony is performed. In the morning the house is cowdunged and the mother and child are bathed. In the afternoon, when the female guests have come, the child is laid in the cradle by its mother and named and the mother\u2019s lap is filled with rice grains or pulse. Boiled pulse and betel are handed round and the guests retire. At any time between when the child is five years old and of age both on boys and on girls the ear-blowing or *karnashravni* is performed. The ear-blowing generally takes place on the eleventh of a Hindu month. After worshipping his gods the Mhar priest, if the child is a boy takes him on his right thigh and if a girl on his left, and whispers a verse or *mantra* in the right ear. The priest now becomes the child\u2019s godfather. Mhars fix no limit of age for the marriage either of their boys or of their girls. It depends on the parents\u2019 circumstances. If the parents are well-to-do the children are married at an early age; if the parents are poor the sons remain unmarried until they are thirty and the daughters till they are sixteen. At the betrothal the boy\u2019s parents present the girl with clothes and ornaments, put sugar in her mouth, and a rupee on her brow. The boy is presented with a turban and they retire after consulting the village priest or *joshi* as to the lucky day for holding the marriage. They make marriage halls and plant an *umbar* Ficus glomerata post, or *muhurtmedh* to which they tie an axe or wheat bread and rub it with turmeric. Friends and kinsfolk are treated to a dinner at the houses of both the boy and the girl. Three or four days before the marriage comes the turmeric rubbing when the boy is rubbed with turmeric, and the boy\u2019s kinswomen with music take the rest to the girl\u2019s. The girl is rubbed with turmeric and presented with a bodice, robe, and ornaments. On the marriage day, a couple of hours before the appointed time, the boy is dressed in new clothes and a marriage ornament or *bashing* is tied to his brow. He is seated on a horse and his sister if a child is seated behind him; if she is a grown girl she walks behind the horse with a waterpot in her hand covered with a bunch of mango leaves and a cocoanut. With them go his male and female relations, friends, and music. He goes to the temple of the village Maruti where he is received by the girl\u2019s parents and a few near relations, and is presented with a new turban and such other clothes as the girl\u2019s father can afford who takes him and his friends with him to his house. On the way near the house a cocoanut and a piece of bread are waved round the boy\u2019s face and thrown away. When he reaches the girl\u2019s, the boy and girl are made to stand facing each other and a cloth is held between them while the priest\nrepeats verses. At the lucky moment the cloth is pulled on one side and the priest and guests throw rice grains over the pair's head and clap their hands. The boy and girl put flower garlands round one another's necks and the male guests are presented with betel and the women with turmeric and saffron. The remaining parts of their marriage ceremony, including feasts on both sides, differ little from those of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They allow their widows to marry, the ceremony always taking place at night and in a lonely place. It begins by the widow worshipping two jars filled with water. Both the village priest and a Pandit of their own caste officiate. Her new husband presents the widow with a new robe and after a short ceremony they are husband and wife. They bury their dead, holding no ceremony over unmarried persons and children under two. When a married man dies his body is washed and the chief mourner pours a little water into his mouth. The body is then rolled in a piece of cloth or blanket and carried to the burial ground either on a bamboo bier or in a sling. A grave is dug and the body is laid in it, and the chief mourner throws a handful of earth over the body and the rest follow. Then the grave is filled, the chief mourner walks thrice round it with an earthen waterpot filled with water on his shoulders in which a hole is pierced at each round and at the end of the three rounds dashes the pot on the ground and cries aloud. The mourners then return to their houses. The chief mourner and his family mourn ten days. On the third day the grave is levelled, and on the twelfth and thirteenth days, cakes and rice balls are offered to the spirit of the dead. If a pure or a Gavsi Mh\u00e1r dines or commits adultery with a M\u00e1ng or a Bhangi, he is put out of caste and is not allowed back unless he shows that he was ignorant of the caste of the person with whom he associated. They are a poor people and though some of them have the wish to send their boys to school, they cannot, as their boys are not allowed to sit side by side with middle and upper class Hindus.\n\nBeggars include thirteen classes with a strength of 9485 or 0\u00b792 per cent of the Hindu population. The details are:\n\n| Division     | Males | Females | Total |\n|--------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Bh\u00e1ts        | 229   | 313     | 447   |\n| Bhuy\u00e1s       | 86    | 22      | 58    |\n| Chitrakathis | 45    | 53      | 98    |\n| Gondhils     | 476   | 559     | 1035  |\n| Gop\u00e1lis      | 17    |         |       |\n| Gos\u00e1vis      | 1453  | 1195    | 2647  |\n| Jangams      | 1011  | 1885    | 2796  |\n| Joshis       | 480   | 438     | 918   |\n| **Total**    | **4975** | **4810** | **9485** |\n\nBh\u00e1ts, or Bards, are returned as numbering 447 and as found over the whole district except in J\u00e1vli and P\u00e1tan. They have no divisions. The men wear the topknot, moustache, and whiskers, and some let their beards grow. They speak both Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and Mar\u00e1thi, and live in middle class houses, one or two storeys high with walls of brick and stone and tiled roofs. They keep cattle but not servants, and their house goods include metal and earthen pots and\npans. Their staple food is millet, rice, pulse, and buttermilk. They eat fish and flesh, but they are not allowed to use liquor. The men dress like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in a waistcloth, coat, turban, and shoes; and the women in a petticoat and a bodice with a back. They pass a robe round the waist over the petticoat and draw one end over the head. The men\u2019s ornaments are an earring or bhikb\u00e1li and finger rings. The women\u2019s ornaments are a gold nosering, the lucky necklace or mangalsutra, silver wristlets or gots, and bellmetal toe-rings or jodvis together worth \u00a33 to \u00a34 (Rs.30-40). They are an intelligent and good-looking class. They are thrifty, sober, and hospitable. They have a minute knowledge of their patrons\u2019 family trees and compose and repeat poems with much spirit and gesture. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and many of the nobility had Bh\u00e1ts in their service, who, since the fall of the chiefship have been forced to take to other means of livelihood. They are beggars and day labourers and barter old clothes for brass and copper pots which they buy from coppersmiths. They worship all Hindu gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and feasts. Their family gods are B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed and Krishna, and their family priests are the village Br\u00e1hmans. Their religious head is an ascetic or bair\u00e1gi of the Vaishnav sect who whispers a sacred verse into the candidate\u2019s ear at the time of the initiation. Except the worship with redpowder and flowers of a twig of the jujube or bor tree in the mother\u2019s room on the fifth day after a birth, and the setting of a lighted lamp before the twig and allowing it to burn the whole night, they have no fifth day worship. On the twelfth day they feast married women in some garden or grove near their house on pulse, rice, and vegetables and return home. In the evening they fill the mother\u2019s lap with grain, cradle the child, and name it singing songs. The female guests retire with betel and boiled gram. The chief points in which their marriage customs differ from those of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are: They have no marriage altar in the bride\u2019s booth, they bring no clay jars from the potter\u2019s; the boy does not visit any temple on his way to the girl\u2019s; and they hold no cloth or antarp\u00e1t between the boy and girl at the time of marrying them. Unlike Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s they drive a five or six feet long teakwood pole into the ground in the centre of the booth, and after the couple have walked seven times round the pole the marriage is over. They burn their dead and mourn ten days. On the tenth the chief mourner shaves his moustache, giving the priest 2s. to 4s. (Rs. 1-2). On the twelfth the caste is given a dinner in honour of the dead. They have a headman called chaudhari who settles all social disputes at caste meetings. The old men among them are held in great reverence and are appealed to in social disputes. They send their boys to school, and excepting a few who hold grant lands are generally badly off.\n\nBhuty\u00e1s, or Spiritmen, are returned as numbering fifty-eight and as found only in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They have no subdivisions, and look and speak like Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from whom they do not differ in house food or dress. Except by their long and filthy begging coat and necklaces of cowrie shells they cannot be known from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They are a quiet thrifty and orderly people, and their hereditary\ncalling is begging from door to door in the name of the goddess Bhav\u00e1ni. They worship all Kunbi gods and goddesses, and keep the regular fasts and festivals. Their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans and their spiritual heads are Gos\u00e1vis. Their customs from birth to death are the same as those of Kunbis. They settle social disputes at caste meetings, send their boys to school, and though poor are thrifty and free from debt.\n\nChitrakathis, or Picture Showmen, are returned as numbering ninety-eight and as found only in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, and T\u00e1sgaon. They say they are from T\u00e1sgaon and came to the district about seventy-five years ago as beggars. They claim to be Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and are divided into B\u00e1gd\u00eds, Gondhlis, Joshis, and V\u00e1sudev\u00eds who eat together and intermarry. They resemble Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in appearance, speech, house, food, and dress, and are quiet hardworking and hospitable. They show pictures of heroes and gods and repeat stories from the Pur\u00e1ns while showing them, and also sing and beg. They worship all the Kunbi gods and goddesses, and keep their fasts and festivals, and their family gods are Amb\u00e1bhav\u00e1ni of Tulj\u00e1pur, Jotiba of Ratn\u00e1giri, Khandoba of P\u00e1li, and Lakshmi of Kolh\u00e1pur. Their priests are ordinary village Br\u00e1hmans whom they greatly respect, and their customs from birth to death are the same as those of Kunbis. They have no headman and settle their social disputes at caste meetings. A few of them send their boys to school. They are a poor people.\n\nGondhlis, or Gondhal Dancers, are returned as numbering 1035 and as found over the whole district. They have no divisions and in appearance, speech, house, food, and dress are the same as Kunbis. They are worshippers of the goddess Amb\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed in whose honour they sing and dance. Mar\u00e1tha Hindus, after some joyful event in the family such as a birth or a marriage, usually perform the gondhal dance. When a gondhal is to be performed, the dancers are feasted during the day, and dance at night. A high wooden stool is set in the middle of a room and a handful or two of wheat is laid on it. On the wheat is set a copper cup with betel leaves in it, and, over the leaves, a half cocoa-kernel holding some rice, a betelnut, and a copper coin. Near the stool is set an image of the goddess Amb\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed and a lighted lamp. In front of the stool stand the three or four dancers with a drum, a one-stringed fiddle called tuntune, two metal cups, and a lighted torch. The head dancer dresses in a long robe and garlands of cowrie shells and stands in front of the others, lays sandal flowers and food before the lighted torch and takes the torch up, dances with the torch in his hands for a time, sings, and at intervals makes a fool of the torch-bearer. The dance lasts about an hour, and, after waving a lighted lamp or \u00e1rti in front of the goddess and throwing copper and silver coins in the plate holding the lamp the dance is over. The dancers are paid 1s. to 2\u00bds. (Rs. \u00bd-1\u00bc) and are sometimes given a turban. In religion and customs Gondhlis do not differ from Kunbis, hold caste councils, send their boys to school, and are well-to-do.\n\nGop\u00e1ls,\u00b9 or Cowherds, are returned as numbering seventeen, and\n\n\u00b9 Details of Mar\u00e1tha Gop\u00e1l customs are given in the Ahmadnagar Statistical Account.\nas found only in J\u00e1vli and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They sing, dance, and wrestle. They are wandering beggars and have no settled home. They wander in small bands visiting sacred places. They keep moving during the fair season and halt in the rains. They are poor.\n\n**Gos\u00e1vis**, or Passion Lords, are returned as numbering 2647 and as found over the whole district. They claim descent from the sage Kapil but are recruited from all middle and upper class Hindus. They are divided into Bair\u00e1gis, Davris, K\u00e1nph\u00e1ty\u00e1s, and Menjogis, and, except that the men let the hair and beard grow long or clean shave the head and face and wear red ochre clothes, they look either like Kunbis or Mh\u00e1rs. Their home tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, and they eat from all Hindus except the depressed or impure tribes. They claim to be vegetarians, eating no flesh and drinking no liquor. But they eat opium and smoke hemp. They rub themselves with ashes and dress in ochre clothes. They beg from door to door and some sing and play on a lyre while begging. Formerly Gos\u00e1vis took service as soldiers and had a good name for bravery and loyalty. In 1789 Mah\u00e1dji Sindia enlisted large numbers of these people, formed them into a distinct body, and placed them under the command of Himat Bah\u00e1dur who was both their captain and religious teacher. Gos\u00e1vis seem inclined to give up begging and take to husbandry and to service as constables and messengers. Though they ought to remain single, some of them marry. They bury their dead. They worship all the Hindu gods and goddesses, but their chief god is Mah\u00e1dev. They travel from place to place, visiting sacred spots, and seldom stay many days in one place. When a man wishes to become a Gos\u00e1vi, he fasts the day before the initiation. Next morning a barber shaves his whole head, bathes him, and smears his whole body with ashes. His religious teacher or *guru* whispers a sacred verse into his ears and gives him molasses to sweeten his mouth and salt that he may prove true to his faith. He is clothed in a red ochre dress and molasses are handed among guests, neighbours, and acquaintances as a sign of joy. A feast is held and the new disciple cooks and serves some dishes. After dinner the sacrificial fire or *bijhom* is lit and the novice is a complete Gos\u00e1vi. They are bound together by a strong fellow-feeling and are poor.\n\n**Jangams**, or Ling\u00e1yat Priests, are returned as numbering 3796 and as found over the whole district. They are the priests of Ling\u00e1yats and worshippers of Shiv. Round their necks they wear a copper or silver casket with an emblem of Shiv. Besides acting as priests they go begging from village to village and house to house, dressed in ochre clothes and carrying a couch shell or a drum. When their head Jangam, who is called *sv\u00e1mi* or lord, dies he is succeeded by some of his numerous disciples. He lives in a monastery in Kar\u00e1d. He visits his followers once every four or five years, fining and levying contributions. His disciples or agents also go about gathering his dues or *haks*. Jangams eat no flesh. When they dine they set the plate on a three-legged stool and eat the whole food served without leaving a particle, and afterwards wash the plate with water and drink the water. Jangams do not marry but are\nsaid to be allowed to visit certain prostitutes who are chosen by the monastery. They bury their dead and raise a tomb over the grave with an inscription and an emblem of Shiv.\n\nJoshis, or Astrologers, are returned as numbering 918 and as found over the whole district. They do not differ from Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis in appearance, speech, house, food, or dress. Their begging dress is a rather long white coat, waistcloth, shouldercloth, shoes or sandals, and generally a loose white turban. They are quiet, patient, and orderly. While telling fortunes, they look on the lines of the palm, and speak in tones so serious, solemn, and respectful that the listener is greatly impressed. They are astrologers, fortune tellers, and beggars, and go singing and beating a small drum or huduk. They worship all Mar\u00e1tha-Kunbi gods and goddesses and keep the same fasts and feasts. They believe in witchcraft and spirits. Their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans, and their customs from birth to death are the same as those of Mar\u00e1tha-Kunbis. They hold caste councils and are a poor people.\n\nKolh\u00e1tis, or Tumblers, are returned as numbering 131 and as found over the whole district except in Kar\u00e1d, Khat\u00e1v, Koregaon, and M\u00e1n. They are a slight, active, and intelligent people with fair skins, dark eyes, and short black hair. They speak a mixture of Gujar\u00e1ti Mar\u00e1thi and Hindust\u00e1ni and have no home, moving from place to place generally in gangs of twenty to twenty-five, carrying small mat huts and cots on the back of donkeys or ponies or on their own heads. They pass the rains in some dry part of the country. They eat the flesh of almost every animal and are excessively fond of drink. The men wear a waistcloth, waistcoat, and turban, and draw a sheet or ch\u00e1dar over their body. They wear rings in their ears and brass armlets. The women wear a robe and bodice and the same ornaments as ordinary Mar\u00e1tha-Kunbis. Both men and women are tumblers and beggars, and some of the women in addition are prostitutes. They steal and kidnap high caste girls to bring them up as prostitutes and are under the eye of the police. They also make and sell small buffalo horn pulleys, mattresses, combs, and dolls. Any one working for hire is put out of caste, but is let back again on paying a fine varying from a handful of betel leaves to \u00a31 (Rs. 10). They worship the usual local and Br\u00e1hmanic gods and goddesses, but their chief deities are Vir and the cholera goddess Mari. They hold the cow sacred. Their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans, and they use charms and believe in witchcraft. They also worship Musalm\u00e1n saints. They feast the caste when a child is born and at marriages walk in procession like other Hindus and follow Hindu customs. They feast their castefellows on the thirteenth day after a death. On coming of age, a Kolh\u00e1ti girl is called to choose between marriage and prostitution. If she chooses marriage, she is closely looked after; if she prefers to be a prostitute her parents call a caste meeting, feast them, and declare that their daughter is a prostitute. The children of unmarried girls are considered outcaste, but they eat and live with their mothers and are supported by them. They have a headman called n\u00e1ik or leader whose duty is to remain in camp and look after the welfare of the\ncommunity. All Kolh\u00e1ti women, whether married or single, are watched by the police. Though poor they are a contented class. They do not send their boys to school and take to no new pursuits.\n\nM\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs, or Respectables, are returned as numbering eighty-two and as found over the whole district except in Javli, Kh\u00e1napur, Khat\u00e1v, M\u00e1n, and P\u00e1tan. They say that some five hundred years ago the M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs and the class called Gorjis formed one brotherhood. At that time a certain dharmapar\u00e1ya\u1e47a or ascetic had two disciples named Div\u00e1kar and Munindra. Munindra took to eating flesh and Bhatt\u00e1ch\u00e1rya a disciple of Div\u00e1kar quarrelled and separated; a part of the brotherhood followed Bhatt\u00e1ch\u00e1rya. He ordered his followers to change their ochre or bhagva robes to black, and called them mah\u00e1mubh\u00e1vs or men of high mind which use has worn to M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs. The sect of M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs includes a Bair\u00e1gi or religious and celibate, and a married householding or Gharvasi division. Celibate M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs are both monks and nuns. Married M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs are divided into those who do not keep caste distinctions, and Bhole or nominal M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs who accept the principles of the order so far as they do not interfere with the rules of their caste. They are recruited from all Hindus except the depressed classes. Among religious or celibate M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs the monks shave the whole head and face not even allowing the moustache to grow, and the nuns also have their heads shaved by a male barber. Their home tongue is Mar\u00e1thi and they live either in monasteries or wander in bands from place to place. They eat no flesh and drink no water in presence of an idol. Both men and women wear black clothes. The monk\u2019s dress is a short waistcloth a headscarf and a shoulder-cloth, and the nun\u2019s a robe the end of which they do not pass back between the feet and no bodice. The monks also do not pass the end of their waistcloth back between the feet and both monks and nuns wear earrings and necklaces of tulsi beads because the plant is sacred to their god Krishna. The monks sometimes wear silver armlets and finger rings. They are a quiet thrifty and orderly people. To take no life is one of their chief rules. They are careful to avoid a place where a murder has been committed and will not eat food for three days in any place where an accidental or a violent death has happened. They generally wander in bands visiting sacred places, receiving into their order grown men and women and children devoted to the M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v life by their parents, making converts, and begging. Of late many have given up begging and have settled as traders and husbandmen. Their gods are Datt\u00e1treya and Krishna whose shrines are at M\u00e1hur in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country. Though they reject all Br\u00e1hmanic and non-Br\u00e1hmanic gods they keep images of Datt\u00e1treya and Krishna in their monasteries and celebrate feasts on the anniversaries of Datt\u00e1treya and Krishna. They have no images of saints and their hatred for all other Br\u00e1hmanical gods has made them unpopular among Br\u00e1hmans, though they are respected by lower class Hindus. They profess not to believe in.\n\n1 Contributed by R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur N. G. Deshp\u00e1nde, Dist. Depy. Collr. Ahmadnagar.\n2 Details of M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v customs are given in the Ahmadnagar Statistical Account.\nghosts or spirits. They say that the ailments which others suppose to be caused by spirits they hold to be bodily sicknesses or plagues sent by God to punish secret sins in this or in a former life. Both men and women study the revered Bhagvat Gita or Krishna scripture, and the learned among them whether men or women are termed Pandits. These Pandits preach and expound separately to the members who are of their own sex. They have only one Mahant or pontiff whose seat is at Ridhpur in Ber\u00e1r, and who is called the K\u00e1ranjkar Mahant. The reward which stirs the best of them to strict holy living is the hope of a seat near the throne of God. The sect is recruited from young children who have been devoted by their parents, or have no one to care for them, or have themselves renounced the world and entered the monastery. The nuns either begin as children or late in life; young women seldom join. The monks and the nuns never live together, and the nuns never serve the monks however high their position may be. The nuns and the monks travel separately. If a band of nuns meets a band of monks and travels with them they put up at a great distance, generally in a separate village. The women hold a separate service for themselves, visiting the temple at noon, or other fixed hours, when no men are allowed to attend. Women and men never hold a joint service. On her admission as a sister a woman, whether she is a Br\u00e1hman or a low caste woman by birth, is a disciple and pupil of the nun who whispers the sacred verse or guru mantra into her ear, and continues her follower so long as the teacher lives. Not only the Mahant or head of the monastery can impart the teacher's verse or guru mantra, any one who has leave can teach it. The nuns call their religious teacher \u00e1i guru or Mother Teacher and the other nuns sisters. Their chief religious house is at Ridhpur in Ber\u00e1r. The members both of a monastery and of a nunnery are divided into five grades. The five grades of M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v monks are the head or mahant, the teacher or pandit, the manager or k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri who provides the inmates with food, the food-server or p\u00e1lekar, and the disciples or ch\u00e9l\u00e1s. The five grades of M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v nuns are, the head or bidk\u00e1r \u00e1i the teacher called either pandit or vamdeskar \u00e1i, the manager or kothi \u00e1i, the young women's guardian or lasurkar \u00e1i, and the food divider or bhojan \u00e1i. M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v nuns attend the funerals both of monks and of nuns. At a monk's funeral they walk far behind. At a nun's funeral men dig the grave and withdraw. The body is carried to the grave by nuns seated in a palanquin the monks walking at a distance behind. When they reach the grave the nuns take the body out of the palanquin, strip it of its clothes except a waistcloth, lay it in the grave, cover it with earth and walk away. When the nuns retire the monks who followed at a distance come and fill the grave. When a Mahant or head of a religious house dies his body is washed, it is seated on a raised seat, and is worshipped by the monks. It is then tied to a palanquin in a sitting position. The palanquin is carried by the disciples on their shoulders to a place chosen for the occasion. As they walk they ceaselessly repeat the names of Krishna and Datt\u00e1treya from the moment of the death till the body is buried. M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs do not use ordinary burial grounds. They choose a clean spot,\nand a grave is dug lengthwise, north and south, and spread with salt. The body is taken out of the palanquin, stripped of its clothes, and a loincloth of buff silk is tied round the loins, and it is laid in the grave with its head to the north and its feet to the south. It is laid on its left side so as to face the east and a cocoanut is broken on the head. A sash or shela, or other valuable cloth is spread over the body, and salt is spread on the sash and earth. After the earth has been spread on the salt each of the mourners lays a cocoanut and a betel packet over it and the grave is filled and the ground levelled so as to leave no trace of the burial. No tomb is ever raised over a M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v. For ten days after the death the members of the religious house are fed. After the death of the head of a monastery such of his disciples as have a name for holy conduct or learning offer themselves as candidates for the post. They go to Paithan in the north-east of Ahmadnagar where they have to pass an examination before learned Pandits, and whoever the learned pronounce best qualified is taken to the M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v monastery in Paithan and is there seated on a raised seat, worshipped, and declared Mahant. Cocoanuts, betel, and sweetmeats are handed round and, on the following day, a feast is held and dry food is offered to such as do not eat from their hands. The newly installed Mahant, before assuming his powers, visits the temple of P\u00e1nch\u00e1leshvar in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country, and, after worshipping Datt\u00e1treya, gives a feast to the M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs, dry food to such as do not eat from his hands, and alms to beggars. The Mahant inquires into and punishes offences committed by the monks, and the Guru mother inquires into and punishes offences committed by the nuns. When a dispute arises which she cannot settle the Guru mother takes the parties before the Mahant. The head nun or Guru mother keeps a strict watch over the sisters and any monk or nun who commits adultery is put out of the house. Any one who dislikes these strict rules may marry and become a householder or Gh\u00e1rav\u00e1si M\u00e1nbh\u00e1v.\n\nTirmalis, or Bullock Showmen, are returned as numbering forty-eight and as found in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Kar\u00e1d, Koregaon, and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They have no subdivisions and their home tongue is Telugu. They are strong and well made and live in middle class houses. They eat fish and flesh and drink a little liquor. They dress like Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, and are clean, neat, and orderly. Their hereditary calling is begging, but some are petty traders, dealing in sacred threads, rudr\u00e1ksh and tulsi bead necklaces, metal boxes, and glass beads. They worship all Mar\u00e1tha Kunbi gods and goddesses and keep the regular fasts and festivals. Their priests are either Telang or Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, and they believe in witchcraft and spirits. They allow child and widow marriage and polygamy but not polyandry. They burn their dead and mourn ten days. They hold caste councils and settle social disputes at caste meetings. They send their boys to school until they learn to read and write, and are thrifty and steady.\n\nUchla\u2019s, or Pickpockets literally Lifters, are returned as numbering 148 and as found in Kar\u00e1d, Koregaon, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and V\u00e1lva. They have no divisions and their home speech is Telugu. They live\neither in ordinary middle class houses or in straw huts with thatched roofs. Except a few metal and earthen vessels their houses contain little furniture. Most of them keep cattle. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They are petty thieves and pickpockets and are not helped in their calling by their wives. They visit local fairs to carry on their trade. Of late a few have taken to tillage and day-labour. They wipe out the sin of theft by occasional grants of bread to the poor. Their family deities are Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i of Tulj\u00e1pur in the Niz\u00e1m's country, Babiroba of Kar\u00e1d in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Khandoba of Jejuri, and Yallamma in the Karn\u00e1tak. They have a priest of their own caste whom they ask to conduct their marriage and other ceremonies. They have a headman called n\u00e1ik who settles their social disputes. A few of them send their boys to school till they are twelve, and they are generally a steady class.\n\n**Vaidus**, or Drug Hawkers, are returned as numbering nine and as found only in Kar\u00e1d. They appear to have come into the district from the Karn\u00e1tak, but when they came is not known. They are dark, hardy, muscular, and robust, and are hospitable orderly and hardworking, but extremely dirty and unsettled. The men wear long moustaches and beards and shave the head. Their home tongue is Telugu, but with others they speak a corrupt Mar\u00e1thi. They generally camp outside of towns and villages in cloth or mat tents which they carry on donkeys. When they go drug-hawking, they sling across their shoulder a bamboo pole hung with one or two bags containing healing roots, herbs, hides, and poisons. They are ready to heal any disease from a cold to a fever, giving some certain cure from the bag. They also beg and are given both grain and cooked food. They eat almost any flesh that comes to them including frogs, rats, and serpents. When nothing special comes in their way their ordinary food is a pittance of bread and vegetables. The men wear a tattered turban, a loincloth, and occasionally a waistcloth. The women wear a robe and sometimes a bodice. After childbirth the mother is held impure for nine days. During this time she does not keep her room, but on the very day the child is born goes about as though nothing had happened. Except for choosing a lucky day for the marriage of their children they never ask the help of a Br\u00e1hman. They pay him five betel packets and five coppers. When the boy and girl are married they feast their caste with flesh and liquor. They bury their dead and hold the mourners impure for three days. They allow child and widow marriage and polygamy but not polyandry. Their chief deities are Khandoba, Vyankoba, and Yallamma, but they worship all other local and Br\u00e1hmanic gods. They fast on Tuesdays in honour of Yallamma and on Saturdays in honour of Vyankoba. They settle social disputes at caste meetings and refer difficult questions to their priest or guru, a Jangam whose head-quarters are in the Karn\u00e1tak. The teacher gathers a three-yearly contribution.\n\n---\n\n1 Details of Uchla customs are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\nof 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) from each family. They do not send their boys to school, and their calling and condition are steady.\n\nVa'sudevs are returned as numbering fifty-one and as found in Khat\u00e1v, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1sgaon, V\u00e1i, and V\u00e1lva. They have no divisions and look, speak, eat, and dress like Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis. They are wandering beggars going in small bands from place to place. Their begging dress is a long hat or crown adorned with peacock feathers, a long coat having numerous folds, and trousers. They carry in their hands two metal cups and play upon a flute. They are given grain, money, and old clothes. They worship all the Mar\u00e1tha-Kunbi gods and goddesses, and their priests are village Br\u00e1hmans. Their family gods are Bahiroba, Khandoba, Mah\u00e1dev, and Vithoba. Their religious teachers are Gos\u00e1vis and they believe in witchcraft and spirits. Their customs are the same as those of Mar\u00e1tha-Kunbis, they hold caste councils, do not send their boys to school or take to any new occupation, and are a falling people.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns are returned as numbering 36,712 or 3\u00b745 per cent of the population. They include thirty classes of whom nine intermarry and form the main body of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns, and twenty-one form distinct communities. The classes who intermarry and form the main body of Musalm\u00e1ns may be arranged into two groups, one including the four leading Musalm\u00e1n classes of Moghals, Path\u00e1ns, Shaikhs, and Syeds, the other including five classes At\u00e1rs or perfumers, Kal\u00e1igars or tinsmiths, Mah\u00e1wats or elephant-drivers, Many\u00e1rs or bangle-sellers, and N\u00e1lbands or farriers. Of the twenty-one separate communities who marry among themselves four are of outside and seventeen are of local origin. The four of outside origin are Bohor\u00e1s and Mehm\u00e1ns from Cutch and Gujar\u00e1t, Mukris and G\u00e1ikas\u00e1bs from Maisur, the first three being traders and the fourth craftsmen. Of the seventeen local classes two B\u00e1gb\u00e1ns or fruitiers and T\u00e1mbolis or betel-sellers are shopkeepers; ten Dhavads or iron-smelters, Dhondphod\u00e1s or Tak\u00e1r\u00e1s stone-masons, Gavand\u00eds or bricklayers, Jh\u00e1r\u00e1s or dust-sifters, Bakar Kas\u00e1bs or mutton-butchers, Momins or weavers, Patvegars or silk-tassel twisters, Pinj\u00e1ris or cotton-teasers, Rang\u00e1ris or dyers, and Sikalgars or armourers, are craftsmen; three classes, Dhob\u00eds or washermen, Haj\u00e1ms or barbers, Pakh\u00e1l\u00eds or watermen are servants; and two Nag\u00e1rjis or kettle-drum-beaters and G\u00e1rud\u00eds or jugglers, are players.\n\nOf the four leading classes Moghals, Path\u00e1ns, Shaikhs, and Syeds, the Moghals are a very small body and the other three include large numbers and are found in all sub-divisions of the district. Though in origin most of them are chiefly local Hindus who on embracing Isl\u00e1m took the name Shaikh or Path\u00e1n from the religious or military leader under whom they were converted, almost all claim and probably most of them have some strain of foreign or Upper Indian blood. The chief foreign elements were the traders, especially horse dealers, the religious leaders, and above all the mercenary and military adventurers, who from the beginning of Musalm\u00e1n power in India found their way to the courts of the Deccan Hindu kings. After the conquest of the Deccan by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji (1294) and under the Bahmani (1347-1490), and\nBij\u00e1pur (1490-1686) kings, there were steady additions of foreign immigrants. This continued probably on a greater scale under Aurangzeb (1658-1707).\n\nExcept that the men wear the beard, the local converts differ little in look from local Hindus and, except the Bohor\u00e1s and Mehm\u00e1ns who speak Gujar\u00e1ti and Cutchi at home, almost all S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed with more or less mixture of Mar\u00e1thi words with themselves and Mar\u00e1thi with others. Among the classes of foreign origin, and to a less extent among the main body of Musalm\u00e1ns, the men have sharper and more marked features, fairer skins, and lighter eyes than the corresponding Hindu classes. The women show fewer traces of non-local origin and in many cases can hardly be distinguished from Hindu women except that they do not mark their brows with vermilion or pass the end of the robe back between the feet. Some well-to-do Musalm\u00e1ns in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra live in two-storeyed houses with stone and cement walls and tiled roofs, and surrounded by a yard. The bulk of the Musalm\u00e1n houses, many of which have a front or back enclosure surrounded by a stone wall four or five feet high, are like tile-roofed cottages built with rough stone and mud and smeared with cowdung. The rich houses have generally four or five rooms, the front room being used as the d\u00e1l\u00e1n or men\u2019s room with a few mats, carpets, and cushions; the middle rooms are allotted as bedrooms one of which is a women\u2019s sitting-room and store-rooms, and the last room forms the kitchen with a good store of metal vessels. The poor houses or huts have two or three rooms with a cot or two, a few mats, some quilts and coarse country blankets, and cooking and drinking vessels, a few of metal and the rest of clay. Village houses are built in much the same style as poor town houses, the front room being the biggest, is used as a stable for cattle. As a rule the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns keep no servants. The village houses have no wells and the women fetch water from the village pond. Both town and village Musalm\u00e1ns own cattle and sheep and goats.\n\nTown Musalm\u00e1ns take two meals a day, breakfast about nine on millet or wheat bread, pulse, mutton, and vegetables, and supper at seven or eight in the evening of boiled rice mutton and pulse if well-to-do, and bread and pulse with pounded chillies or chatni if poor. Village Musalm\u00e1ns and some rich town Musalm\u00e1ns have three meals a day, the villagers taking a cold breakfast about seven before going to their fields, a midday meal in the field, and a supper on reaching home in the evening. The rich add to the usual two meals a cup of tea or milk with bread in the morning immediately after rising. The staple food of villagers is millet bread, pulse, and vegetables; a few rich villagers eat mutton daily and almost all manage to get mutton on the Bakar Id festival. Except a few fresh settlers as Bohor\u00e1s and Mehm\u00e1ns, who generally eat beef, the bulk of the local Musalm\u00e1ns prefer mutton to beef, and some communities will on no occasion touch beef. Buffalo beef is eschewed by all, and fowls, eggs, and fish are eaten without any objection when they can afford them. The trading classes as a rule use coffee and tea every day, and husbandmen drink milk with bread every morning. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns drink both\nEuropean and country wines, smoke hemp-flower or ganja, drink hemp-water or bh\u00e1ng, and eat opium, tobacco smoking chewing and snuffing being common among all classes. Their special dishes are the same as those of Poona and Ahmadnagar Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nExcept the members of the four leading classes and the Bohor\u00e1s and Mehm\u00e1ns who dress in loose trousers, a waistcoat, a shirt and a Musalm\u00e1n-shaped turban, almost all S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1n men dress in Hindu style. The men wear indoors a headscarf, a waistcoat, and a waist or loincloth; out of doors on all occasions the rich and on festive occasions the middle class and poor wear a twisted turban or a loose Mar\u00e1tha turban, a coat, a pair of trousers, and shoes. Most husbandmen while indoors dress in a dirty napkin used as a loincloth and on going out draw a coarse country blanket over their shoulders. The daily dress of town Musalm\u00e1ns is of cotton, but they have a silk dress for special occasions. Indoors almost all the women wear the long Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. The chief exceptions are the Bohora women who dress in a petticoat, a backless bodice and a headscarf, and the Mehm\u00e1n women who wear a shirt reaching to the knees and loose trousers. Except the Bohor\u00e1s who wear a large cloak that covers the whole face and figure, they have no special outdoor dress. About thirty per cent of the middle class Musalm\u00e1ns of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra keep the zen\u00e1na or seclusion system, while others appear in public with the same dress they wear at home. Every married woman has a suit of silk presented by her husband at the time of her marriage, which generally lasts during the whole of her life. Almost all Musalm\u00e1n women begin married life with a number of gold and silver ornaments in proportion to the means of her husband and parents, who, as a rule, have to present their daughters with a gold nosering, a set of gold earrings, and silver finger rings. The husband has to pay his wife \u00a312 14s. (Rs. 127) if not more at the time of marriage, which are generally spent on ornaments. In a poor family these ornaments by degrees disappear in meeting special ceremony charges and in helping the family in times of difficulty.\n\nAs a class town Musalm\u00e1ns are clean and neat, while villagers are often dirty and untidy. Almost all local classes and the richer classes of Bohor\u00e1s and Mehm\u00e1ns are steady and hardworking. The upper classes are clean, polite, and generally sober and honest. B\u00e1gb\u00e1ns or fruiterers, Gavand\u00eds or bricklayers, Kas\u00e1b\u00eds or butchers, Pinj\u00e1r\u00eds or cotton-cleansers, and Tak\u00e1r\u00e1s or masons are strong and rough.\n\nMost village Musalm\u00e1ns are land proprietors or j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, and husbandmen. Of town Musalm\u00e1ns many are soldiers, constables, messengers, and servants; a few are craftsmen and artisans; and some are moneylenders. Though hardworking and thrifty many are given to drink and are badly off. Except Mehm\u00e1ns and Bohor\u00e1s, who take contracts, deal in European goods, and are well-to-do and rising classes, most Musalm\u00e1n craftsmen and artisans are badly off on account of the competition of European and Bombay machine made goods. They are often required to borrow to meet special charges. Village Musalm\u00e1ns, especially husbandmen, are thrifty. Among the regular Musalm\u00e1ns, especially among town traders,\nsoldiers, constables, messengers, and servants, the women add nothing to the family income. On the other hand in many of the special communities and among husbandmen, weavers, and other craftsmen and petty shopkeepers, the women earn almost as much as the men. Sameness in faith, worship, manners, and customs bind Musalm\u00e1ns into one body. Except some families of Bohor\u00e1s who are Shi\u00e1s of the Ism\u00e1\u00edl\u00ed branch and followers of the Mulla S\u00e1heb of Surat, all S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns belong to the Sunni sect of the Hanafi school. They respect the same K\u00e1zi, worship in the same mosque, and bury in the same graveyard. Among the special or local communities, the B\u00e1gb\u00e1ns or fruiterers, Kas\u00e1bs or mutton butchers, Dhondphod\u00e1s or stone-masons, Gavand\u00eds or bricklayers, Pinj\u00e1r\u00eds or cotton-cleaners, and Pakh\u00e1l\u00eds or water-carriers have such Hindu leanings that they do not associate with other Musalm\u00e1ns; almost never attend the mosque, eschew beef, keep Hindu feasts, and openly worship and offer vows to Hindu gods.\n\nOf the regular Musalm\u00e1ns about twenty per cent teach their sons to read the Kur\u00e1n. All of them are careful to circumcise their boys and to have their marriage and death rites conducted by their K\u00e1zi. The initiation or bismilla and the sacrifice or ak\u00edka are often neglected, owing partly to ignorance and partly to poverty. Though as a rule they do not attend the mosque for daily prayers, almost all are careful to be present at the special services on the Ramz\u00e1n and Bakar Id feasts, and are careful to give alms and keep fasting during the whole month of Ramz\u00e1n. The well-to-do make special offerings on the Bakar Id and pay the K\u00e1zi his dues. Their religious officers are the K\u00e1zi or Judge but now the marriage registrar, the Khatib or preacher, the Mulla or priest, the Muj\u00e1var or beadle, and the N\u00e1ib or the K\u00e1zi's deputy. Besides the religious officers certain Pirj\u00e1d\u00e1s or sons of saints hold a high position among them. They are spiritual guides and have religious followers chiefly among weavers and the classes who live by service. These Pirj\u00e1d\u00e1s live on estates granted to their ancestors by the Musalm\u00e1n rulers of the Deccan. Carelessness and love of show have forced most of them to part with their lands and they are now supported by their followers. Except Bohor\u00e1s all Musalm\u00e1ns believe in saints or pirs, to whom they pray for children or for health, and offer sacrifices and gifts. Most craftsmen and almost all husbandmen believe in Khandoba, Mhasoba, Mari\u00e1i, and Satv\u00e1i, Hindu deities to whom they make gifts and offer vows, and whom they worship either privately or publicly. Mhasoba is supposed to be the guardian deity of the field, and most husbandmen offer him a fowl or goat every year either at the harvest gathering or at the opening of the rains in June, when a new field year begins. They worship Satv\u00e1i or Mother Sixth, who is supposed to register the destiny of the child on the sixth night after birth, and Mari\u00e1i or Mother Death to save them from cholera. No S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns make pilgrimages to Mecca, but for amusement and to offer vows most young women and men visit the fairs of local saints and some-\n\n---\n\n1 Details of the duties of K\u00e1z\u00eds and other religious office bearers are given in the Poona and Shol\u00e1pur Statistical Accounts.\ntimes go a few days' journey to the neighbouring districts of Poona Sholapur and Kulbarga. As a rule S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns believe in witchcraft and soothsaying, and allow and practise polygamy and widow and child marriage.\n\nAfter the birth of a child, the members of the family are ceremonially unclean for forty days, during which the house images of saints are not worshipped. When a woman is in labour a midwife is sent for. The midwife delivers the woman, buries the navel-cord and the after-birth in an earthen pot in a corner of the lying-in room and bathes the mother in the same corner. If the child is a boy the midwife is paid 1s. 3d. (10 as.) and if the child is a girl 7\u00bdd. (5 as.). On the fifth day the goddess Chhati or Satv\u00e1i is worshipped. A silver human tooth and a small silver sickle are the objects of worship. The tooth and the sickle are laid in a winnowing basket with a platter containing the heart and head of a goat and boiled rice, and half a dry cocoa-kernel, two betel leaves and a betelnut, and a marking-nut with a needle through it. Before these things the mother burns incense and bows. The ceremony is marked with a feast given to friends and relations. In some families mutton is served at this feast while in other families rice and split pulse sauce are served. On the twelfth day the young mother takes her child to a distance from the house and worships five stones under a tree with turmeric powder, vermilion, scented powder, a piece of red string, and a betelnut and five betel leaves. On the fortieth day the mother is bathed and dressed in a new robe and bodice. When the woman bathes on the fortieth day, she is made to rub her teeth with sticks of forty different kinds of trees and forty pinches of tooth-powder. The woman is also made to put on new glass bangles. Friends and relations are treated to pul\u00e1v that is a dish of rice and mutton cooked together, or to banga that is rice and mutton cooked separately. In the evening the child is dressed in a cap and a frock, and its hands and feet are adorned with silver ornaments. The women gather near the cradle, put the child into it, and sing songs as they rock the cradle. Before naming the child a piece of sandalwood is wrapped in a handkerchief, waved about the cradle, and is passed from one woman to another with the words, Take this moon and give the sun. After the piece of wood has been several times passed backwards and forwards, they lay it in the cradle by the side of the child and name the child. The name of the child is chosen by the K\u00e1zi according to the position of its birth stars.\n\nSunta or circumcision is performed at any time between a boy's third and twelfth year, the younger age being always preferred. In rich families the circumcision is marked with as much pomp and show as a marriage. A booth is raised in the front of the house with the muhurtmedh or first post driven into the ground on a lucky moment; and betelnuts, rice, and turmeric roots are tied in a yellow cloth and fastened to the first pole. A water jar encircled with a red thread bracelet or kankan passed round turmeric roots is also tied up and the boy to be circumcised is rubbed with turmeric paste for two days. On the second day female friends and relations are asked to the biy\u00e1pari feast, in which five unwidowed women who have not broken their fast are served with boiled rice, bread,\nvegetables, split pulse, curry, wafer biscuits, and pickles. As a rule none but unwidowed women are allowed to attend this feast. On the third day the boy is bathed in warm water, dressed in a new turban, a pair of drawers, a shouldercloth, and a jama or long white robe reaching to the heels, and from head to foot he is covered with a veil made of a network of flowers and called the sultani shera or king's chaplet. His arms and wrists also are covered with flower garlands. He is made to sit on a horse and taken in procession to a mosque to say the prayers. In the mosque the Kazi teaches the boy the prayer, and, at the end of the prayer, the boy and the Kazi embrace each other and the musicians attending the procession begin to play on their instruments. They again set the boy on the horse and return home with the same pomp and sit to a feast. In the evening, after dinner, the barber who is to circumcise the boy and who is called nabi that is Prophet, or khalifa that is Ruler, comes. The boy is seated on a stool or chaurang covered with a red cloth and usually with a red handkerchief. This stool is set on a square piece of yellow cloth, with a square of lines of red rice or wheat drawn by unwidowed women. A platter is laid before the child and in it a burning lamp. Two persons, one on each side, hold the boy fast, and on both sides of the boy stand two persons holding lighted wicks of cotton thread soaked in oil. As he circumcises the child the barber calls out Din Din, that is religion. Unwidowed women wave the platter with the light in it about the boy and lay it down, and friends and relations wave copper or silver pieces each about the boy and throw them into the platter. The boy is carried and laid down on a cot and is fanned with wheaten unleavened cakes by the women of the family. Next day the barber washes the wound, turns up the skin by means of a wooden instrument called ghodi, applies oil to the wound, and receives 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) from the father or other relation. Besides this he receives a meal of undressed provisions and the money waved about the boy by his friends and relations. The wound heals in ten to fifteen days, and the expenses amount to \u00a35 (Rs. 50). In poor families the ceremony is finished in a day at a cost of \u00a31 to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10-12). Instead of going to a mosque the boy's father brings the Kazi to his house, the barber circumcises the boy in the Kazi's presence, and the ceremony ends with a feast to friends and relations.\n\nAmong Satara Musalmans offers of marriage come from the boy's parents. The boy's father goes to see the girl, and if he finds her to his taste, he tells her father so, who returns with him to see the boy. If both the fathers are satisfied, they go to the Kazi and Mulana to see whether the birth stars of the boy and girl agree and whether the marriage is likely to prove lucky. If they are satisfied that it has a good chance of being lucky they return home and settle what sum the boy's father is to pay the girl's father as the price of the girl. This sum is spent by the girl's father in the marriage, and the boy's father has to spend nothing. The cost generally ranges from \u00a310 to \u00a330 (Rs. 100-300). When both parties are rich enough to bear the costs, no sum is paid by the boy's father to the girl's father. Girls of middle class families are generally married between\nnine and thirteen to young men of twenty to twenty-two. Girls of rich families are often obliged to remain unmarried till their fifteenth or sixteenth year on account of the want of a suitable match. In such cases grown-up girls are married to men of above twenty-five. Of the four main classes Shaikhs and Syeds intermarry and Path\u00e1ns and Moghals keep separate. In the betrothal the bridegroom sends to the bride presents of a silver sari or wire necklace, chotis or hanging hair ornaments with hollow silver knobs, tod\u00e1s or silver chain foot ornaments, and a green robe and bodice. In return the bride\u2019s parents, whom the bridegroom feasts on s\u00e1kharbh\u00e1t, that is rice boiled and seasoned with sugar, give him a turban, a silver ring, and a handkerchief. The betrothal day is fixed as lucky by the K\u00e1zi who is paid five copper coins, a betelnut, and molasses worth 1d. (\u00a7 a.). The marriage takes place six or eight months after the betrothal. When the marriage day draws near a booth is built in the front of the house; and around it boiled rice mixed with curds is thrown and a cocoanut broken as an offering to evil spirits, that they may not attack the bride and the bridegroom. In a corner of the booth a mango branch with a betelnut, some turmeric roots, and a little rice tied to it in a piece of yellow cloth, is driven into the ground. It is called the muhurtmedh or lucky post, and is planted in the ground at a lucky moment. At night the rajjaka, in which songs in the praise of All\u00e1h or God are sung to the music of drums, is performed by women of the family, and in rich families by Dombins or professional female singers and drummers. While the singing and music go on gulgul\u00e1s or small stuffed wheaten cakes and rah\u00edms or boiled rice flour balls made with milk sugar and rosewater, are heaped in the name of All\u00e1h or God in two miniature pyramids, one for the bride and the other for the bridegroom. Before these little heaps a red cotton cord, flowers, and burnt incense are laid. After a short time the heaps are broken and the cakes and balls are handed to women. Next day, without his knowing it, a woman marks the bridegroom\u2019s clothes with turmeric paste. This is called the secret turmeric or chorhalad. Like Hindus, the Musalm\u00e1ns of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra allow no widows to attend festal meetings, and are particular about lucky days and persons. Thus the woman who puts on the secret turmeric or chorhalad must have her husband alive, and her name must be given out by the K\u00e1zi after consulting his almanac. In the evening the bride and bridegroom are rubbed with turmeric paste, one after the other, as they are not allowed to see each other\u2019s faces till they are married. In this ceremony both men and women take part, and it is called the s\u00e1halad or public turmeric, as opposed to the chorhalad or secret turmeric. When the bride and bridegroom are being rubbed with turmeric paste, they are seated on a chaurang or stool covered with yellow cloth and set on a square of yellow cloth having a square of red rice or wheat, drawn by five unwidowed women. The turmeric paste is first rubbed on the bridegroom and then on the bride, care being taken that they do not see each other\u2019s face. On the third day the feast of biy\u00e1pari is given, which includes boiled rice, wheaten cakes, a sauce of split pulse and three or four kinds of vegetables. The food is first served in five small earthen dining plates to five unwidowed women.\nBefore they sit to eat, they knot together the dress of the bride and the bridegroom and in front of them burn incense in the name of All\u00e1h or God, and the bride and bridegroom bow to All\u00e1h. On this and on the next day while musicians play, friends and relations make presents of clothes to the parents of the bride and bridegroom. On the fourth day a feast of pul\u00e1v that is rice cooked with mutton, called the var\u00e1t or hometaking feast, is given to male guests. In the evening the tel mend\u00ed or oil and henna Lawsonia inermus ceremony takes place. In this the bridegroom is made to sit on a stool having a pile of pitchers called telghad\u00e1s or oil-jars on each side, one of seven pitchers in the name of the bridegroom and the other of nine pitchers in the name of the bride. On the top of each of these piles are laid two suv\u00e1l\u00eds or raised wheaten cakes fried in oil. The bridegroom's right wrist is encircled with a betelnut bracelet or kankan, a copper coin, a turmeric root, and a pinch of rice tied in a piece of red cloth and the tooth-powder of the Chebulic myrobalan, and iron filings is applied to his teeth. As he sits on the stool five unwidowed women, one after another, wave round him a millet stalk with wheat cakes and betel leaves dipped in oil and tied to it by a red cotton cord. A canopy of a square piece of cloth with twenty-five wheat cakes is held over his head by four persons and the wheat cakes are equally divided among the four bearers.\n\nThe bridegroom is led into the house and his place is taken by the bride who undergoes the same ceremony except that a necklace of glass beads is tied round her neck and that her hands and fingers are adorned with glass bangles and silver rings. This ceremony is important, for when her husband dies a woman removes the necklace and the glass bangles. After the ornaments are put on two half cocoa-kernels tied together by a red cotton cord are dropped into the laps of the bride and the bridegroom. The pair are then bathed separately. At the time of bathing, their mothers hold the skirts of their robes over the heads of their children and unwidowed women from the oil jars pour water over them through the skirts. They are dressed in the clothes presented to them by their fathers-in-law, and their eyes are anointed with sulphuret of antimony. The bridegroom's dress is much like that which he wore on the circumcision day, and as he was then he is veiled from head to foot, with a network of flowers called sult\u00e1nisher\u00e1s or king's chaplets. His arms and neck are adorned with garlands of flowers and his turban with a bouquet. He is then at about four in the morning led on horseback to a mosque to say his prayers. His sister walks behind his horse with a platter containing a burning lamp made of dough and keeps throwing a fragrant unguent or chiksa made of millet and turmeric and other scent-giving drugs. In the mosque the K\u00e1zi tells the bridegroom to recite his prayers five times, and at the end of the prayers the K\u00e1zi embraces the bridegroom. The bridegroom is brought in procession into the marriage booth and seated on the square in the booth. When the bridegroom reaches the door of the booth a cocoanut and four lemons are waved round him and thrown away as an offering to evil spirits. Meanwhile the bride is bathed in the same way as the bridegroom, and her hair is plaited into a braid by unwidowed women. She puts on shoes, wears flower garlands, and is covered with a flower veil called sher\u00e1s.\nor garlands. Her lap is filled with the *suv\u0101gpuda*, that is a packet of scented powders, and she is wrapped in a white sheet or *ch\u00e1dar*. While the bride sits in the house, the bridegroom is taught the *nikekh\u00e1n\u00ed* or duties of a husband. The chief of these are, that he should not punish his wife without a fault, and that he should send his wife to her parents whenever they send for her. Two agents or *vakils* and two witnesses, one for the bride and the other for the bridegroom, stand before the K\u00e1zi and declare that they have agreed to this marriage and are ready to bear evidence. The K\u00e1zi feeds the bridegroom with five morsels of macaroni. By this time the bride comes and sits, facing west, on a cot set in the booth in front of the square on which the bridegroom is seated. A curtain is held between them and a little *chiksa* or millet ointment is thrown on their heads as a sign that the nuptials are over. The K\u00e1zi removes the curtain and musicians play. The bride and bridegroom are made to sit on the cot side by side and allowed to see each other\u2019s face for the first time. As they sit the K\u00e1zi takes a little sugar into his hand, puts it on the bride\u2019s right shoulder and asks the bridegroom whether he thinks sugar sweet or his wife sweet, who answers the Kur\u00e1n is the sweetest. The couple look at each other\u2019s faces in a looking glass and each placing a hand on the other\u2019s back they bow five times to the Almighty. The bride goes into the house and the bridegroom stays in the booth till noon when the *var\u00e1t* or hometaking procession starts. In this procession the bride sits in a carriage while the bridegroom rides a horse and escorts his bride to his house carrying her on his side to the front gate of the house. Here he is met by his sisters and cousins who, before letting him in, make him promise to give his daughters in marriage to their sons. He consults his wife and she tells him to give them the promise. He then sets his wife on the ground and they walk together into the house. In the evening the bride and bridegroom, with some men and women, go to the bride\u2019s father\u2019s house where they play with the wedding bracelets or *kankans*. In this play the *kankans* of the couple, with five betelnuts, five turmeric roots, five pomegranate buds, and a silver ring are thrown into what is called *sarvar* water which is made of a mixture of turmeric powder and lime. The bride and bridegroom try to pick the ring and other things out of the water, and force them from each other\u2019s hands. When the play is over they are made to stand side by side, bathed and dressed, the bridegroom being dressed in a *lungi* or coarse waistcloth. Friends and relations are feasted on cakes or *polis* and dismissed, this feast being the last of the marriage festivities. A S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1n may have, at the same time, more than one wife; but a woman cannot have more than one husband. Divorce is allowed and practised. It is not very uncommon to see a woman who has been divorced by two or three husbands.\n\nAmong S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns, as a rule, a widow marries a widower or a person who has divorced his wife. A man who wishes to marry a widow gives \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10 - 15) to the widow\u2019s parents, a turban to her father, and a robe and a bodice to herself. Besides this he puts glass bangles on her wrists and ties the *lacha* or glass-bead necklace round her neck. In the evening the K\u00e1zi tells\nhim the duties of a husband and marries them, and receives 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc) as his fee. Unwidowed women are careful not to be present at or even to overhear a widow marriage service; and after the marriage, the faces of the couple should not be seen till they have bathed next morning. If the man is well-to-do he gives a feast to his friends and relations, or else sends bat\u00e1s\u00e1s or sugar packets to his friends.\n\nWhen a girl comes of age she is held unclean for five or seven days. During this time she is made to sit by herself and is not allowed to touch anything in the house. Every day she is rubbed with turmeric paste and oil and bathed in warm water; and her relations bring her presents of sweetmeats, macaroni, puffs, and cakes. On the seventh day she and her husband are bathed together in warm water and she is dressed in a green bodice and robe. Her husband presents her husband with a turban worth 16s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 8-10), a shouldercloth worth 6s. to 12s. (Rs. 3-6), and a seal ring or chh\u00e1p worth 1s. (8 as.) and a handkerchief worth 1s. to 2s. (Re. \u00bd-1). Some flower garlands are tied round the girl\u2019s neck and some are allowed to hang from her temples. Her husband\u2019s turban is decked with a bouquet and her arms and wrists are adorned with flower garlands. They are seated together, the girl to the right of her husband, and their laps are filled by a lucky woman chosen by the K\u00e1zi after consulting his book. Each of their laps is filled with one cocoanut, five half cocoa-kernels, five betelnuts, five dry dates, five turmeric roots, five lemons, five pomegranate buds, five plantains, five polis or cakes fried in oil, and puffs or k\u00e9nol\u00e1s. All these are brought by the girl\u2019s parents. The husband and wife go to bow to the household saints or pirs, generally R\u00e1jevali and D\u00e1wul Malik, and the guests are treated to a feast of polis or cakes. Each of the women who is asked to the lap-filling brings a cocoanut, a bodicecloth, and flowers as presents to the girl. The night is spent by the women in singing and beating drums, and in rich families by listening to hired Dombins who are paid 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2-3) with dressed food for the night. Besides the Dombins, some engage kettle-drum-beaters and other musicians to pass the night. In this ceremony a Musalm\u00e1n spends from \u00a32 to \u00a36 (Rs. 20-60) according to his means.\n\nIn the sixth month of a woman\u2019s first pregnancy, her and her husband\u2019s laps are filled in the same way as when she came of age. On this occasion her mother brings five baskets filled with dhavalbutis or cakes made of five kinds of flour and seasoned with spices, Italian millet cakes having sesame seed stuck in them, wheaten cakes, millet cakes, and two kinds of gram flour cakes p\u00e1tvadis and l\u00e1tivavadis, usal mug or split pulse seasoned with oil and spices, and boiled rice mixed with curds. She also brings a turban for the husband and a robe and bodice for her daughter. As a rule friends kinspeople and the members of the family eat the dressed food brought by the girl\u2019s mother.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns bury all their dead. When a Musalm\u00e1n dies some near relation with the Mul\u00e1na goes to market and buys a shroud seventy-five feet long for a man and ninety feet long for\nChapter III.\n\nPeople.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\n\na woman and other things wanted for the funeral. These are rose-water, scents, sulphuret of antimony, aloe-lights, frankincense, and yellow earth; and in addition, frankincense oil and a flower-net when the dead is a woman. The dead is washed first with water boiled with bor and pomegranate leaves and then with soapnut water, and laid on the back on a cot. The Mul\u00e1na writes the creed, There is no God but All\u00e1h and Muhammad is the prophet of All\u00e1h in aloe-powder on the chest and forehead of the dead and puts pieces of camphor at all the joints of the dead body. The body is then wrapped in the shroud and carried to the graveyard. As the body is borne to the graveyard the funeral party, all of whom are men, accompany the dead body calling Kalma-i-Shahadat, that is I say that there is only One God, and recite verses from the Kur\u00e1n. Every now and then on the way the bearers are relieved and when they reach the spot where the bier is kept, which is generally at the idga or prayer place, they fall on their knees and pray to the Almighty. From this the corpse is carried to the grave and buried. As the grave is being filled all present go round the grave and throw in handfuls of earth. They close the grave and retiring forty paces fall on their knees and offer prayers to the Almighty for the dead. These prayers are called khatm\u00e1s. All then return to the house of the deceased person, and offer khatm\u00e1s or dead prayers on the spot where the dead body was washed and return to their homes. On the first day after the funeral the mourners are fed by their relations and friends on food dressed at their own houses. Among the low classes of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns, if a woman dies in childbed r\u00e1la grains are thrown behind the body as it is borne to the burial-ground. It is believed that a woman who dies in childbirth always becomes a ghost. She tries to return to her house, but stops to pick up the grains and is so long delayed that she never reaches. On the third day the mourners go to the burial ground, whitewash the tomb, and lay flowers, sabja or basil Ocymum pilosum or basilicum, and sweetmeats beside it. On the ninth, at a feast called dasva, rice and mutton are served. On the twentieth is a feast of wheat cakes and halva or almond sweetmeat. The cost of the different funeral rites and feasts varies from \u00a32 to \u00a36 (Rs. 20-60). On the fortieth day they spend \u00a31 to \u00a34 (Rs. 10-40) on a grand feast in which mutton is one of the main dishes. On this day a garland of flowers is kept hanging from the centre of the roof on a large platter filled with dressed food, vegetables, khir that is rice boiled in milk with sugar, and the heart of a goat; and, at the four corners of the house, four platters called khutas containing polis or cakes stuffed with pounded gram-pulse boiled with molasses, gh\u00e1ris or cakes stuffed with gram-pulse boiled with molasses, rot or cakes, k\u00e1navl\u00e1is or puffs, gulgul\u00e1is or wheaten stuffed cakes, khurphur\u00e1is or balls of gram flour seasoned with spices and fried in oil, wafer-biscuits, cucumbers, pomegranates, guavas, plantains, and custard apples. The mourners and guests burn incense before the central dish and offer prayers for the soul of the dead. After the prayers all sit to eat and after dinner smoke tobacco and return to their homes. As it is a funeral feast betel leaves and nuts are not handed to the guests. In the evening is a\nKur\u00e1n reading or manlud and the Mul\u00e1na is paid 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) for all his services during the funeral. About twenty per cent of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns, generally traders and servants, send their boys to school where they are taught both vernacular and English. The sons of husbandmen and craftsmen begin to help their parents as soon as they are eight or ten. A few town Musalm\u00e1ns have learnt English and some are employed as Government servants and have risen to high positions in the police and army.\n\nThe great body of Musalm\u00e1ns who intermarry and differ little in looks customs or dress, besides the four main classes Moghals, Path\u00e1ns, Shaikhs, and Syeds, includes five special communities. Of these two At\u00e1rs or perfumers and Many\u00e1rs or bracelet-sellers are traders; two Kal\u00e1igars or tinsmiths and N\u00e1lbands or farriers are craftsmen, and one Mah\u00e1wats or elephant-drivers are servants.\n\nAt\u00e1rs, or Perfumers, said to be the representative of Hindus of the same name converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707), are found in small numbers only in towns. Their original name is Mahanult\u00e1r and they get their present name from dealing in scented oils or attars. They are said to have come from Poona and Talegaon during the time of the Mar\u00e1tha kings at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In look speech food and dress they resemble the regular Musalm\u00e1ns and as a class are clean, neat and tidy, hardworking, and thrifty. Their women dress in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice and appear in public but do not help the men in their work. They have fixed shops where they sell scented oils, abir powder, frankincense sticks, and mas\u00e1la or a mixture of aloewood sandalwood and dried rose leaves. During the Muharram they sell coloured thread wreaths or s\u00e1helis which are worn both by Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns as the signs of mourning for the death of Hasan and Husain. These threads are worn during the latter five of the ten days of the Muharram and are thrown into water on the tenth. They cost 1\u00bdd. to 3d. (1-2 as.). At\u00e1rs generally marry among themselves, but also give their daughters to Shaikhs and Syeds. In social matters they form a separate community under an elective headman and settle social disputes according to the votes of the majority of members and with the consent of the headman. They do not differ from the main classes of Musalm\u00e1ns in manners or customs, and are said to be careful to say their prayers. They teach their children to read the Kur\u00e1n and send them to school. They do not take to new pursuits but say their calling has ceased to be well paid since the introduction of English perfumes and that they are badly off.\n\nMany\u00e1rs, or Bangle Sellers, said to represent local Hindus of mixed origin converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707), are found in small numbers only in towns. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and\n\n---\n\n1 Details of Moghal, Path\u00e1n, Shaikh, and Syed customs are given in the Poona Statistical Account.\n2 Hasan and Husain the grandsons of the Prophet and sons of Ali the son-in-law of Muhammad, were killed on the plain of Karbal\u00e1 in Southern Persia in H.61 A.D., 683.\nMar\u00e1thi abroad. Like other regular Musalm\u00e1ns they are tall or of middle height, dark or of olive colour, strong and well made, the women being fairer and thinner than the men. The men wear the beard full and dress in a waistcloth, a tight-fitting jacket, a coat, and a Mar\u00e1tha turban. The women wear a Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and except the old, do not help the men in their work. Both men and women are clean and neat in their habits, orderly, honest, hardworking, and thrifty. They are bangle-sellers and have fixed shops, and also hawk their goods about the streets and attend weekly markets and fairs. They sell both China glass and local glass bangles, and some of them are well-to-do. They marry among themselves generally, form a distinct body, and settle social disputes according to the votes of the majority. Except that they eschew beef and perform no initiation or bismilla and sacrifice or akika, their social and religious customs are the same as those of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They belong to the Hanafi school of the Sunni sect, and are careful to say their prayers. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, but their calling is well paid and they are able to save.\n\nKala'igars, or Tinsmiths, calling themselves Shaikhs and found scattered in small numbers over the district, are said to represent Hindus of the same class converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707). They call themselves Shaikhs and neither men nor women differ from Shaikhs in look, dress, food, or in social and religious customs. They tin copper and brass vessels. As a class they are clean and neat in their habits, but, though hardworking and thrifty, as their work is not constant, few of them are well-to-do, and many have moved to Poona and Bombay in search of work. They form a separate community under an elective headman called chaudhari, who, with the consent of the majority of the members fines any one who breaks their caste rules. They keep no Hindu customs and do not differ from regular Musalm\u00e1ns with whom they intermarry. In religion they are Hanafi Sunnis, and many are religious and careful to say their prayers. They teach their boys to read the Kur\u00e1n and Mar\u00e1thi. They take to no new pursuits, and are badly off.\n\nN\u00e1lbands, or Farriers, said to represent local converts of mixed Hindu origin, are found in small numbers in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Mah\u00e1baleshwar. They call themselves Shaikhs and are like to Kal\u00e1igars or tinsmiths in look dress and customs. Their women dress in a robe and bodice and do not appear in public or add to the family income. As a class N\u00e1lbands are clean and neat in their habits, honest, and hardworking, but given to drink. They shoe horses and bullocks, and earn 6d. to 2s. 6d. (Rs. \u00bc - 1\u00bc) a day. They have a well managed union with an elective headman or p\u00e1t\u00edl, marry with any regular Musalm\u00e1ns, and do not differ from them in social or religious customs. In faith, Sunnis of the Hanafi school, they respect and obey the K\u00e1zi and employ him to conduct their marriage and death ceremonies. But they are careless about saying their prayers, and give their boys no schooling. A few of them are employed as messengers and servants, and as a class they are fairly off.\nMaha'wats, or Elephant Drivers, are found in small numbers in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and other large towns. They are said to represent local converts of the Hindu class of the same name, and speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and Mar\u00e1thi abroad. They are tall or of middle height and dark. The men shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress in a turban, a tight-fitting jacket, and a pair of light trousers or a waist-cloth. The women wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice and appear in public, but add nothing to the family income. Both men and women are clean in their habits, hardworking, thrifty, and sober. Under British rule the demand for their services has fallen. They have taken to new pursuits; a few are husbandmen, some serve as constables, and others as messengers and servants. They live from hand to mouth, and have to borrow to meet special charges. They have no special organisation and no headman, and marry with any of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns. Most of the men and almost all the women eschew beef and have a leaning to Hindu customs, keeping Hindu feasts and worshipping Hindu gods. In religion they are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, but few are religious or careful to say their prayers. They respect and obey the K\u00e1zi, and employ him to conduct their marriage and death ceremonies and to settle social disputes. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, and are a falling class.\n\nThe four outside separate communities who marry among themselves are:\n\nBohora's, immigrants from Gujar\u00e1t and by descent partly Gujar\u00e1t Hindu converts and partly Arab and Persian immigrants, are Shi\u00e1s of the Ism\u00e1ili sect and are known from one of their former pontiffs as Daud\u00ed Bohor\u00e1s. All are followers of the Mulla S\u00e1heb of Surat. Two or three families in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town and a few at Mah\u00e1baleshvar are said to have been in the district about forty years. They speak Gujar\u00e1ti among themselves and Hindust\u00e1ni with others. The men who are tall or middle-sized, thin, and brown or wheat-coloured, shave the head clean, wear the beard full, and dress in a silk headscarf or a white turban, a white coat, a shirt, a waistcoat, and a pair of loose trousers. The women who are shorter, fairer, and thinner than the men, are regular featured and dress in a chintz petticoat, a headscarf, and a tight-fitting backless bodice with short sleeves. Out of doors they put on a large black cloak which shrouds the whole body from head to foot, except a small gauze opening for the eyes. They seldom appear in public, and add nothing to the family income. As a class Bohor\u00e1s are clean and neat in their habits, hardworking, orderly and thrifty, and often well-to-do, and able to save. They marry among themselves, but one Bohora in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra has taken a wife from a poor Sunni family. Being a limited number they mix and associate with the ordinary regular Musalm\u00e1ns in dinner parties and religious meetings and bury their dead in the ordinary Sunni Musalm\u00e1n graveyard. Though they do not obey the regular K\u00e1zi, they employ him to conduct the marriage and death ceremonies. They perform the initiation or bismilla and the sacrifice or akika ceremonies, and do not keep Hindu feasts or offer vows to Hindu gods. Though Shi\u00e1s at heart they...\ndo not openly profess their religion, for fear of displeasing the Sunnis. They teach their boys Gujarati and Marathi, and on the whole are a rising class.\n\nMehma'ns, properly Momins or Believers, number three or four families at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and a few at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Originally of Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war they seem to have come from Bombay and Poona about thirty years ago, and are converts of the Loh\u00e1na caste. They speak Cutchi at home and Hindust\u00e1ni abroad. In look, food, dress, and customs they closely resemble their brethren in Bombay and Poona. They are clean and neat in their habits, orderly, hardworking, and thrifty, and have a good name among traders. They deal in English furniture and piecegoods, and are a well-to-do and a saving class. They form a separate community, but have no special organisation and no headman. They respect and obey the K\u00e1zi, and their social and religious customs do not differ from those of ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, and are strictly religious and careful to say their prayers. They teach their boys to read the Kur\u00e1n and Marathi, but not English. They do not take to new pursuits, but their calling is well paid and they are fairly off and lay by. On the whole they are a pushing class.\n\nMukris,\u00b9 said to mean Deniers from mukerna to deny, are believed to represent Hindus of the Vanj\u00e1ri or Lam\u00e1n caste converted by Haidar Ali (1763-1782) at Maisur about the middle of the eighteenth century. They are found in small numbers at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Mah\u00e1baleshvar. They are said to have come from Maisur, first to Belgaum and thence to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, about fifty years ago, and were formerly a larger class as of late years in consequence of disputes with local money-lenders and traders, several of them have gone back to Belgaum and Kolh\u00e1pur. Some have given up moneylending and taken to service and contracting. Their home tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni and they speak Marathi abroad. In look, food, dress, and manners they are like the Mukris of Shol\u00e1pur, and as a class are clean and neat, hardworking and orderly, but quarrelsome and not over-honest. They are grocers and are corn and spice dealers, and are well-to-do and able to save. They marry among themselves only and form a separate community under an elective headman called chaudhari, who, with the consent of the castemen settles caste disputes and punishes the breakers of rules with fines and caste feasts. Their social and religious customs are the same as the regular Musalm\u00e1n customs. Though in name Sunnis of the Hanafi school they seldom say their prayers, but obey the K\u00e1zi and employ him to conduct their marriage and death ceremonies. They teach their children to read Marathi and Urdu, but not English. None of them has risen to any high position.\n\nGa'i Kas\u00e1bs, or Beef Butchers, probably immigrants from Maisur, are found in small numbers in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra cantonment and at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. They are said to be descendants of Abyssinian slaves and K\u00e1buli Path\u00e1ns whom Haidar Ali employed to kill cows and\n\n\u00b9 The story of the supposed origin of the name Mukri is given in the Shol\u00e1pur Statistical Account.\nbuffaloes in Maisur, and who came to the Deccan with General Wellesley in 1803 and Sir Thomas Munro in 1818. They are found only in military cantonments. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni among themselves and Mar\u00e1thi with others. In look dress and manners they are like the local regular Musalm\u00e1ns. As a class they are dirty and untidy in their habits, and though hardworking, hot-tempered and quarrelsome, and much given to liquor. Some of them are well-to-do and able to save, but most are badly off. They kill cows and buffaloes and have fixed shops, and sometimes take beef to villages near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and exchange it among the low caste Hindus for corn or money. They marry among themselves and form a separate community and have a well managed union under an elective headman called chaudhari. They belong to the Hanafi Sunni sect and are not careful to say their prayers. They obey and respect the K\u00e1zi and employ him to conduct their marriage and death ceremonies. Except that they do not perform the ceremonies of initiation or bismilla and sacrifice or akika, their social and religious customs are the same as those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They give their children no schooling and take to no new pursuits.\n\nThe seventeen local communities who form distinct bodies and marry among themselves only are:\n\nBa'gba'ns, or Fruiturers, are found in considerable numbers in towns and large villages. They say they are descended from a Musalm\u00e1n mother and a Mar\u00e1tha father, but according to others they represent Kunbis converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707). The men add Shaikh to their names and in look, food, dress, and manners do not differ from the regular Musalm\u00e1ns. The women dress in the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice and can be known from Kunbi women only by wearing silver bangles instead of glass bangles. They are neat and clean in their habits, honest, hardworking, orderly and thrifty, and keep bullocks and ponies to carry home vegetables and fruit from their gardens and villages to towns. They are market gardeners, and are fairly off. Of late they have been giving up their Hindu customs and becoming stricter Musalm\u00e1ns. About twenty years ago they used to worship a metal pot or ghat in honour of Tulja Bhav\u00e1ni on Dasara Day in September-October, and the goddess Satv\u00e1\u00ed on the sixth night after childbirth, and to hold the mother impure for twelve days. Now they perform the chhalla ceremony on the fortieth day after childbirth only. Their social and religious customs are the same as those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and regularly attend the mosque, and fast during the Ramz\u00e1n and keep the feast of the Bakar Id. They ask the K\u00e1zi to register their marriage, and obey and respect him. They have a headman and a caste council who settle caste disputes with the consent of the castemen. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, but their calling is well paid, and they earn enough to live on and are able to lay by.\n\nBakar Kas\u00e1'bs, or Mutton Butchers, are found in small numbers over the whole district. They are said to represent Hindu Kh\u00e1tiks converted by Tipu Sult\u00e1n (1782-1799), and hence they say they add Sult\u00e1n\u00ed to their names. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni among themselves and Mar\u00e1thi with others. The men who are dark, strong,\nand well made, wear the beard full, shave the head, and dress in a pair of drawers or a waistcloth, a shouldercloth, a shirt, a Mar\u00e1tha turban, and a pair of shoes. The women, who are fairer than the men and regular featured, dress in a robe and bodice, appear in public, spin wool, and mind the house. As a class mutton butchers are clean and neat, honest, hardworking, and thrifty, and many are well-to-do and able to save. They have fixed shops and their work is constant, but they say they have lately suffered from the competition of Hindu Kh\u00e1tiks. They eat from all, except Nh\u00e1vis, Dhobis, T\u00e1m-bats, and Son\u00e1rs and the impure castes of Hindus, and never associate with ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns. They eschew beef, keep all Hindu feasts, and offer vows to Hindu gods. They marry among themselves and form a separate community under an elective headman called p\u00e1t\u00edl, who, with the consent of the majority of the castemen, settles their social disputes. They are Hanafi Sunnis and are seldom careful to say their prayers. Except circumcision they keep no Musalm\u00e1n rites, though they obey and respect the K\u00e1zi and employ him to conduct their marriage and death ceremonies. They keep images of their gods and of Musalm\u00e1n saints or pirs in their house, and they are the disciples or murids of the Pirj\u00e1d\u00e1s of Bij\u00e1pur and P\u00e1tan in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They do not send their children to school and take to no new pursuits, but their calling is well paid and they are a saving class.\n\nDhavads, or Iron-smelters, said to represent local Kolis converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707), are found in large numbers in the Mah\u00e1baleshwar hills. Their home speech is a dialect of their own of Hindust\u00e1ni and Mar\u00e1thi words, and out-of-doors they speak corrupt Mar\u00e1thi. The men are generally middle sized, dark, and sturdy, with high cheek bones and small eyes, and shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress in a dirty, carelessly wound white turban, a tight-fitting jacket, and a pair of light trousers or a waistcloth. The women, who are shorter and fairer than the men, dress in a dirty and untidy Hindu robe like the Domb\u00e1ri women, passing the skirt back between the feet and tucking the end of the robe to the waistband leaving half the legs bare, and a tight-fitting short-sleeved bodice covering the back and tied in a knot in front under the bosom. They appear in public and do as much work as the men, bringing head-loads of fuel and grass from the forest. Though hardworking, Dhavads, as a rule, are dishonest, wild-tempered, and given to drink country liquor. They smelt the iron which is found in laterite or iron clay hills. But partly from the growing scarcity of fuel and partly from the cheapness of foreign iron and hardware goods their iron smelting has nearly ceased. They live by cutting and selling grass, gathering honey, and making and selling iron nails, tongs, and frying pans. They live from hand to mouth. They marry among themselves and form a separate community, and have a well managed body under their elective headman or p\u00e1t\u00edl who settles their social disputes with the consent of the castemen and punishes the caste rule-breakers with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. Except that they call themselves Hanafi Sunnis, circumcise their sons, and ask the K\u00e1zi to register their marriages, they have few Musalm\u00e1n customs. They keep Hindu feasts, eschew beef, and worship Hindu gods...\nThey say no Musalm\u00e1n prayers, and give their children no schooling.\n\n**Dhobis**, or Washermen, said to represent local converts of the Hindu class of the same name, are found in small numbers in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. They speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed with themselves and Mar\u00e1thi with others. The men who are dark, thin, middle sized, and well made, shave the head or cut the hair close, wear the beard full and dress in a headscarf, a shirt, a waistcoat, and a waistcloth. The women are fairer and thinner than the men and wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and do as much work as the men. As a class they are clean and neat in their habits, orderly, honest, and hardworking, but spending on drink almost half of their earnings. They are employed both by Europeans and natives and earn 16s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs.8-15) a month. They marry among themselves and form a separate community with a good organization under a headman or *chaudhari*, who, with the consent of the castemen, settles caste disputes and punishes the breakers of social rules with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. In religion they are Hanafi Sunnis and are very careless about saying their prayers. Except that they ask the K\u00e1zi to register their marriage and to conduct their death ceremonies they keep no Musalm\u00e1n rites, observing Hindu feasts, eschewing beef, and offering vows to Hindu gods. They do not give their children any schooling or take to new pursuits, but their calling is well paid and they are a steady class.\n\n**Dhondphod\u00e1s**, or Tak\u00e1r\u00e1s, Quarrymen and Stone Masons, are said to represent Hindus of the same name converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707). They are found in small numbers in towns and large villages. Their home tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and they speak Mar\u00e1thi abroad. Except that they are not given to drink, in look food dress and manners they are similar to Dhavads. Some are quarrymen and stone-masons and others are stone-dressers. Most have moved to Bombay and Poona in search of work. Many are fairly off and have made fortunes by taking stone contracts in Bombay. The poorer, who are called Tak\u00e1r\u00e1s, roughen grindstones. They marry among themselves and have a well managed union under an elective headman styled *p\u00e1til*, who settles social disputes at caste meetings. Breaches of social rules are punished with fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. Except that they eschew beef, worship Hindu gods, and keep Hindu feasts their customs are said to be the same as those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns. Except circumcision they keep no special Musalm\u00e1n rite and seldom attend the mosque. They give their children no schooling and are a rising class.\n\n**Gavandis**, or Bicklayers, said to represent local Hindus of the same name converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707) are found in small numbers all over the district. Among themselves they speak Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and with others Mar\u00e1thi. The men who are tall or middle sized, thin and dark, shave the head, were the beard full, and dress in a dirty and untidy large white or red Mar\u00e1tha turban, a tight-fitting jacket, and a waistcloth; the women who are fairer and better featured than the men, wear a Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice,\nChapter III.\n\nPeople.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\n\nGavandis.\n\nappear in public, and mind the house. As a class Gavandis are dirty and untidy, hardworking, orderly, and thrifty. They are masons and bricklayers and in search of work many have moved to Poona and Bombay, and many have become day labourers earning 6d. to 9d. (4-6 as.) a day. Their work is not constant, and they are often badly off and in debt. They marry among themselves only, but have no special organisation and no head except the regular K\u00e1zi who settles their social disputes and registers their marriages. Except that they eschew beef and keep Hindu feasts their religious and social customs do not differ from those of the regular Musalm\u00e1ns. They belong to the Hanafi sect of Sunnis, but are seldom careful to say their prayers. They do not give their children any schooling, and some of them are employed as messengers and servants. As a class the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Gavandis are poor.\n\nGa\u2019rudis or Mad\u00e1ris.\n\nGa\u2019rudis, or Mad\u00e1ris, a wandering class of jugglers who move all over the district in bands of four or five families, represent local converts, probably of the Kolh\u00e1ti caste. Their head-quarters are at Miraj about thirty-five miles east of Kolh\u00e1pur. Their ancestors are said to have been converted by Mir Samsudin, commonly known as Mir\u00e1n Shamna, who died about the middle of the fourteenth century, and was buried at Miraj, his tomb being the scene of a yearly fair. Among themselves they speak a coarse Hindust\u00e1ni and with others a mixture of Mar\u00e1thi. As a class they are dark, sturdy, and middle sized; the men either shave the head or cut the hair close, and wear the beard full, and dress in a dirty carelessly folded and twisted turban, a waistcloth, and tight-fitting trousers leaving half the legs bare. The women, who are like the men in look, are dirty and untidy, and dress in a coarse Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice. They appear in public and except by begging do not add to the family income. They are a class of jugglers, tumblers, and snake-charmers, neither sober nor honest, poorly clad, and ill-fed. If they fail to maintain themselves by their performances they beg from door to door and live from hand to mouth. They marry among themselves only and form a separate community under an elective headman. They settle social disputes at meetings of the castemen at the yearly fair of their saint at Miraj. They keep no Musalm\u00e1n customs and do not obey or respect the regular K\u00e1zi except by employing him to register their marriages. They are Musalm\u00e1ns in name only and never say their prayers. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits, and are a falling class.\n\nHaja\u2019ms.\n\nHaja\u2019ms, or Barbers, representatives of local converts of the Hindu class of the same name, are found in small numbers in towns and large villages. In look, food, dress, and manners, they closely resemble Dhobis and speak Hindust\u00e1ni at home and a corrupt Mar\u00e1thi abroad. As a class though lazy and unthrifty, Haja\u2019ms are orderly and honest and live from hand to mouth. Their work is constant and they earn 6d. (4 as.) a day. They marry among themselves only and form a separate community without a special organisation or an elective headman. They refer their caste disputes to the regular K\u00e1zi, who registers their marriages and conducts their death ceremonies. Except circumcising their children and employing the K\u00e1zi at their marriages and deaths, they keep no\nsocial or religious Musalm\u00e1n customs, and are seldom careful to say their prayers. They call themselves Sunnis of the Hanafi school. They do not give their children any schooling or take to new pursuits, and are a steady class.\n\nJh\u00e1ra's, or Dust Sifters, are found in small numbers over the whole district. They are descended from Hindus, probably of the B\u00e1gb\u00e1n caste, who are said to have been converted by Aurangzeb (1658-1707). They rank with At\u00e1rs, Many\u00e1rs, and Patvegars whom they resemble in look food and dress, and with whom they eat and marry. They buy the sweepings and ashes of goldsmiths' shops and furnaces and sift out particles of gold and silver. They also sift the ashes of dead Hindus for melted ornaments diving and bringing up the mud when the ashes are thrown into water. They sell these particles to money-changers and make 6d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bc-1) a day. When they do not get sufficient work at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, they travel to Belgaum, Gok\u00e1k, Kolhapur, N\u00e1sik, and Shol\u00e1pur, and buy dust in the goldsmiths' shops, sift it in the river, and return home. As a class they are clean and neat in their habits, and, though given to drink, are hardworking and thrifty, and some of them are fairly off and able to save. They form a separate body with a well managed union under their headman called mehetra, and settle social disputes in accordance with the votes of the castemen. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school in name, but are seldom religious or careful to say their prayers. They respect and obey the regular K\u00e1zi and employ him to register their marriage and to conduct their death ceremonies. They never give their boys any schooling and besides as dust-sifters earn their living as messengers and servants.\n\nRanga'ris, or Dyers, are found in towns and large villages. They are said to represent converts from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r who came and settled in the district about fifteen years ago. They have a subdivision called Chipha. They speak Hindust\u00e1ni both at home and abroad, are dark, strong, and well built, and can easily be known by their blue hands. The men shave the head, wear the beard full, and dress like other Musalm\u00e1ns. The women are fairer than the men and dress in the Upper Indian petticoat and bodice, and wear large ivory bangles and wristlets, and a necklace of black glass beads. They appear in public and help their husbands in preparing colours. As a class Rang\u00e1ris are clean and neat, honest, hardworking, orderly, and thrifty. They are hereditary dyers, and their work is brisk in the fair season. Like mutton-butchers, they do not eat from the hands of Hindu Dhobis, Son\u00e1rs, T\u00e1mbats, and the depressed classes and do not associate with regular Musalm\u00e1ns, and eschew beef and liquor. They are Sunnis of the Hanafi school, fast during Ramz\u00e1n, and worship Muhammedan saints. Their customs, except their marriage customs, are the same as those of regular Musalm\u00e1ns, but they have no special organization and the regular K\u00e1zi settles their caste disputes. They marry among themselves, the boy as a rule taking as wife his maternal uncle's daughter. At the betrothal the boy presents the girl with a petticoat and a backless short-sleeved bodice. The parents of both the boy and the girl consult the regular K\u00e1zi and he names a lucky day for the marriage. The\nfather of the girl receives no money from the boy's father, but sometimes if he is poor the boy's father pays a sum of money to the girl's father. Booths are raised before the houses of both with a marriage post called *muhurimedh* fixed in one of the corners of each. Married women secretly rub some turmeric on the bridegroom's clothes. Then comes the *s\u00e1vhalad* or public turmeric rubbing at which the married women meet at the girl's house in the evening where the boy is also asked, seat the boy on a low stool placed on a square of wheat, sing M\u00e1rv\u00e1r songs, rub him with turmeric, and deck his head with flower garlands. The girl is carried in by some married woman on her hip and rubbed with turmeric, musicians play, and the women are feasted at the girl's. This they call the feast of *biyapari*, when the food is served in dishes and frankincense is burnt in the name of God, the marriage clothes of the couple are marked with sandal and placed before the dishes. Five women are made to fast during the day and are told to eat first of all. They are followed by the women of the house and the ceremony is over. The women of the bride's house take vermicelli and sugared rice or *s\u00e1kharbh\u00e1t* with music to the bridegroom's for his breakfast, and in return receive from him 2s. (Re. 1) and a bodicecloth. On the next day the god-humouring is performed and goats are killed, and friends and relations treated to a dinner. Early next morning the bridegroom is taken to the mosque and prays and the rest of the marriage ceremony is the same as among other Musalm\u00e1ns. The regular K\u00e1zi settles their caste disputes. They send their boys to school, and are well-to-do.\n\n*Momins,* probably represent converts of the Koshti caste, are found in towns and large villages. They form a separate class and do not marry with other Musalm\u00e1ns though in a few cases they have married with Patvegar or tassel-maker families. They have no objection to eat with any Musalm\u00e1n. A Momin woman differs from other Musalm\u00e1n women of the district in not wearing any nose ornament. They are weavers. The appliances of a Momin's loom are a brush or *kuncha* worth 4s. to 10s. (Rs. 2-5) and bought of a Kanj\u00e1ri, *k\u00e1mby\u00e1s* or rods laid flat between the alternate threads of the warp to keep them from becoming entangled, *turk\u00e1th* or a cloth beam worth 1s. 3d. (10 as.), *hatya* or a shuttle beam used as a batten or lay worth 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd), *phani* or the reed frame worth 3d. to 1s. 6d. (2-12 as.), *charka* or the wheel worth 2s. (Re. 1), *dhota* or a shuttle worth 9d. (6 as.) bought of a Kolh\u00e1ti, and *tansal* or uprights with rings worth 1s. 6d. (12 as.). Their women help by twisting yarn. They weave a turban of unbleached yarn 150 feet long in ten days, sell it for 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) and make 3s. (Rs.1\u00bd) as profit. They have suffered by the competition of machine-made yarn and they have been reduced to poverty. Some have left their craft and become servants and day labourers. They keep all the Musalm\u00e1n customs.\n\n*Nagarjis,* or Kettle Drummers, representatives of local converts of the Hindu class of the same name, are found in small numbers in towns only. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1ni and they speak Mar\u00e1thi abroad. They are dark, tall, or middle sized, regular featured, and well built. The men shave the head and wear the beard.\nfull, and dress in a large twisted turban, a coat, a waistcoat, and a waistcloth. The women, who are fairer and thinner than the men, wear a Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and add nothing to the family earnings. Both men and women are clean and neat in their habits. The men are kettledrum-beaters but since the fall of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chiefs the demand for their work has been less and they at present are asked to play during marriages at the houses of both the Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, and on festive occasions at local temples and the shrines of Musalm\u00e1n saints. Though hardworking many are given to drink and are badly off, and some of them have taken to tillage. They marry among themselves only and form a separate community under an elective headman or chaudhari, who settles caste disputes with the consent of the majority of the castemen, and punishes the breakers of social rules with fines and caste feasts. Though in name Sunnis of the Hanafi school they have strong Hindu leanings, keeping Hindu feasts, eschewing beef, and worshipping Hindu gods. They are seldom careful to say their prayers or to perform the ceremonies of bismilla or initiation and akika or sacrifice. They respect and obey the K\u00e1zi and employ him to register their marriages. They seldom send their boys to school. Besides as kettle-drummers they work as messengers and servants and are a steady class.\n\nPakh\u00e1lis, or Water-carriers, representing local Hindu converts of the same caste, are found in small numbers in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Mah\u00e1baleshwar, and other large towns. Their home-tongue is Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and they speak a corrupt Mar\u00e1thi abroad. As a class they are middle sized, dark, and thin; the men shave the head or cut the hair close, wear the beard full, and dress in a headscarf or a Mar\u00e1tha turban, a tight-fitting jacket, and a pair of tight and short trousers, or a waistcloth. The women are shorter and fairer than the men and wear the Mar\u00e1tha robe and bodice, appear in public, and, except the old who help in water-carrying, add nothing to the family income. As a rule Pakh\u00e1lis are dirty and untidy in their habits, hardworking and thrifty. They carry water in leathern bags on bullock-back and supply water to Musalm\u00e1ns, Christians, P\u00e1rsis, and a few low caste Hindus. Their monthly earnings vary from \u00a31 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 10-15) but they are given to drink and spend half their income on liquor. They marry among themselves and form a separate community under an elective headman called chaudhari who settles social disputes with the consent of the majority of the caste and punishes breaches of social rules by fines which generally take the form of caste feasts. They call themselves Sunnis of the Hanafi school but are seldom careful to say their prayers or perform the ceremonies of initiation or bismilla and sacrifice or akika. They respect and obey the regular K\u00e1zi and employ him to conduct their marriage and death ceremonies. But they have strong Hindu leanings, eschew beef, keep Hindu festivals especially the Dasara in September - October, and offer vows to Hindu gods. On Dasara Day they deck their bullocks with flowers, paint them yellow and green, and parade them through the streets along with the bullocks of the Hindus, preceded by music, and followed by a\ncrowd. They do not send their boys to school or take to new pursuits. They are a poor class and generally in debt.\n\n**Patvegars**, or Silk Tassel Twisters, are found in almost all towns. They probably represent local converts of mixed Hindu classes and rank with At\u00e1rs, Momins, and Many\u00e1rs with whom they intermarry and whom they resemble in look, food, dress, and customs. They ascribe their conversion to Aurangzeb (1658-1707) and twist silk tassels and make silk waist threads or *katdor\u00e1s* and soft pads or *g\u00e1dis* for women's necklaces. They do not send their children to school or take to new pursuits, but their work is constant and they are a steady class.\n\n**Pinj\u00e1ris**, or Cotton Teasers, representatives of local converts of the Hindu caste of the same name, are found only in towns. They are Musalm\u00e1ns and eat with other Musalm\u00e1ns, but marry among themselves only. The men take the titles of Shaikh, Syed, and Path\u00e1n after their names. The K\u00e1zi and Mulla officiate at their marriages and they give 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5-10) to the caste as present money. They have a headman called *mehtar* to whom in a marriage ceremony the boy's father gives a turban. The *mehtar* inquires into and settles their caste disputes. Most of them are carders of cotton and wool, and a few are servants and day-labourers. They stuff beds with cleaned cotton and make pack-saddles, quilted felt to put under saddles, and different kinds of felt. They are aided in their work by their women and children. The tools they use are a *kam\u00e1n* or bow worth 6s. (Rs. 3), a *dasta* or pestle worth 1s. (8 as.), and catgut sold at 4s. (Rs. 2) for 150 feet. The *kam\u00e1n* or bow is a somewhat square piece of plank having a pole with a hooked end fastened to it. The catgut passes over the hooked end and is fastened to the piece of plank. Thus the whole machine is something like a bow. The *dasta* is a cylindrical piece of wood having both its ends formed like knobs and a groove in the middle to handle it. As the carder sits to clean cotton or wool he holds the *kam\u00e1n*, which hangs down from the string of a bow attached to a peg in a wall and pulls the catgut by an end of the *dasta*. Their goods do not command sale, and their trade is on the decline.\n\n**Sikalgars**, or Armourers, are found only in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. They eat with all Musalm\u00e1ns, but marry with Many\u00e1rs, At\u00e1rs, and Patvegars only. They furbish and polish weapons and tools and make razors, knives, pack needles, carpenters' tools, and all sorts of cutlery. A few of them are engaged as servants. The large importation of European hardware has greatly interfered with their calling. They call the K\u00e1zi and Mulla to officiate at their marriage, and pay 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) to the K\u00e1zi. They present a turban to their headman or *mehtar*, differing in value according to their means. They ask other Musalm\u00e1ns to marriage feasts and are asked by them to similar feasts. Except this, their customs differ little from those of other Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\n**T\u00e1mbats**, or Coppersmiths, probably representatives of converts of the Hindu caste of the same name, are found in towns only. They say that they are descended from one Muhammad Din. They eat\nwith all Musalm\u00e1ns, but marry only with At\u00e1rs, Many\u00e1rs, Pinj\u00e9r\u00eds, Patvegars, Sikalgars, and Hat\u00edv\u00e1l\u00e1s. They call the K\u00e1zi and Mulla to conduct their marriage and other ceremonies. They make brass vessels. None of them has a shop of his own for brass wares; all of them are paid 6s. (Rs. 3 a man) the quarter of brass sheet worked into pots. Their capitalists are K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, for whom they make t\u00e1ts or dining dishes with the rim slightly inclined outwards, p\u00e1tel\u00e1s or cylindrical copper or brass pots with slightly rounded bottoms, t\u00e1mby\u00e1s or drinking pots of all fashions, par\u00e1ts or large platters with high rims slightly inclined outwards, and v\u00e1t\u00eds or cylindrical brass cups with rounded bottoms. Their religion forbids their working in copper. One T\u00e1mbat is said to be able to make twenty-eight pounds of brass into pots in twelve days. They sometimes smelt brass, the alloy containing two parts of copper and one and a half parts of pewter. To these metals half a pound of soda is added, and the whole mixture is put in an iron crucible. The crucible is put into a pit covered with charcoal, and fire is set and blown into a white heat. Nearly two hours are required for the alloy to form. Some forty years ago they were well-to-do. Since then they are slowly declining, on account of the large number of hands engaged in the trade. They are poor and barely self-supporting.\n\nChristians are returned as numbering 886 and as found chiefly in J\u00e1vli, Koregaon, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and W\u00e1i. Of the 886 Christians, 426 were Europeans including Americans of the American mission and Eurasians, and 460 Natives. Besides the civil officers a large number of Europeans belong to the military service. The American mission began work in the district in 1834 and has at present (1884) 124 native converts connected with it. In 1834 Mrs. Graves of the American mission opened a girls school at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Till 1849 when the Rev. William Wood of the American Mission settled permanently at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the school was removed to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra every year during the rainy season. Since 1849 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra has resident missionaries. In food, drink, dress, calling, faith, and customs, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Native Christians do not differ from the Ahmadnagar Native Christians.\n\nP\u00e1rsis are returned as numbering ninety-nine and as found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and J\u00e1vli. They are emigrants from Bombay. Their home speech is Gujar\u00e1ti. As shopkeepers, merchants, and contractors they are well to do and prosperous.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census, agriculture supported about 744,000 people or 70 per cent of the population. The details are:\n\n| Age          | Males   | Females | Total   |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Under Fifteen| 154,707 | 139,857 | 294,564 |\n| Over Fifteen | 218,245 | 231,204 | 449,449 |\n| Total        | 372,952 | 371,061 | 744,013 |\n\nThe bulk of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra landholders are Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis. But the best class of husbandmen are the Jains of the south and southwest of the district. In 1851 Mr. Ogilvy described the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Kunbis as hardworking skilful husbandmen, understanding the rotation of crops, the value of manure, and the necessity of refreshing the soil by fallows. The general opinion is less favourable to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Kunbi who is said to be wanting in enterprise and averse from improvement. In the east of the district the landholders are said to be only moderately hardworking, and the richer soils in the west are said to suffer from being cropped several years in succession without ploughing. At the same time different parts of the district show notable instances of skill and enterprise. In parts of Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 and W\u00e1i bad conditions have been improved with great success. By terracing slopes and damming ravines the very rocks have been forced to yield a good return. The hill cultivator is most acute in availing himself of every spring, and is an adept at terracing the hill sides, and generally wherever means of irrigation are available the cultivator shows industry and skill. Instead of limiting his undertakings to eking out a bare subsistence he aims at an increase of comfort and fortune. That there are no more signs of enterprise is due to the want of capital and the despair of escaping from the moneylender. The habit of disposing of their own produce has lately increased among landholders, owing to the restricted credit occasioned by the Agriculturists' Relief Act, which is believed to have had the effect of quickening enterprise and the desire to improve. The condition of the landholders varies considerably in different parts of the district. It may be roughly stated that few east of\n\n---\n\n1 Except the details of crops and water-works, and the account of famines, this chapter is contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\nthe Yerla river are in comfortable circumstances, and many are frequently obliged to leave their homes in search of employment. Few anywhere are clear of debt, but the western landholder has probably better credit and less often borrows from neediness than the eastern. The Kunbi landholder generally sells his produce to the village dealer, to wandering buyers who frequent villages at harvest time, or in the nearest market. A few export on their own account chiefly to Poona and Chiplun. Most of the local field produce is sent away by merchants who have secured it either by purchase from the growers in satisfaction of debts, or from moneylenders at wholesale prices. During the idle season many husbandmen make use of their own and their cattle's labour in cart-driving, while some members of many families are engaged in carting the whole year round. Cases of husbandmen giving up their calling and taking to crafts or other industries are unknown in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nThe soils of the district belong to three main classes, red in the hills and black and light-coloured in the plains. The black or k\u00e1l\u00ed soil is generally found in belts lying along the banks of the leading streams, the breadth of the belt varying with the size of the stream. In the Krishna valley is found the broadest belt of this rich soil, which yields the best garden and dry crops in the district. Under the name of black is included the slightly lighter and less productive k\u00e1lvat which is mixed with a small quantity of murum or crumbly trap. The leading light coloured soils are the m\u00e1l r\u00e1n or murum m\u00e1l a hard rocky soil commonest at the bases of the more eastern hills. The same soil, mixed with red at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, forms one variety of the soil called t\u00e1mbad or red. Another soil known as t\u00e1mbad is black soil mixed with red. Near the heads of the streams which issue from the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, the soil of the valleys is red or t\u00e1mbd\u00ec and yields most of the rice grown in the district. On the hill tops where the water cannot be sufficiently confined for rice tillage this soil is used for kumri or wood-ash tillage. There is also the soil called chumkhadi which is a broken trap or murum soil strongly charged with lime. Lime is also found in black soils near river beds. The soil of the country at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds west of the Yerla is generally good, and the soil of the Krishna valley is especially rich. East of the Yerla, and in the Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 petty division in the north-east, the land becomes poorer, and the proportion of black soil becomes much smaller.\n\nOf an area of 4792 square miles or 3,067,948 acres, 2,442,503 acres or 79\u00b762 per cent are in 960 Government villages, and 625,440 acres or 20\u00b738 per cent are in 396 alienated villages. All the Government lands have been surveyed, and of the lands in alienated villages 363,189 acres have been surveyed. According to the revenue survey, of the 2,442,503 acres of Government land, 1,802,156 acres or 73\u00b779 per cent are arable; 141,291 acres or 5\u00b779 per cent unarable; 4956 acres or 0\u00b720 per cent grass or kuran; 337,715 acres or 15\u00b787 per cent forest; and 106,385 acres or 4\u00b735 per cent village sites, roads, and river beds. Of the 1,802,156 acres of arable land in Government villages 382,957 or 21\u00b724 per cent are alienated. Of\nthe whole arable area of 1,802,156 acres 1,378,659 acres or 76\u00b750 per cent were in 1882-83 held for tillage. Of this 43,462 acres or 3\u00b715 per cent were garden land, 14,895 acres or 1\u00b708 per cent were rice land, and 1,320,302 acres or 95\u00b777 per cent were dry crop.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings, including alienated lands in Government villages, was 120,158 with an average area of 14\u00bd acres. Of the whole number of holdings 46,353 were of not more than five acres; 25,628 were of five to ten acres; 22,620 of ten to twenty acres; 11,601 of twenty to thirty acres; 5,584 of thirty to forty acres; 2,946 of forty to fifty acres; 3,782 of fifty to a hundred acres; 1,285 of 100 to 200 acres; 221 of 200 to 300 acres; 66 of 300 to 400 acres; and 72 of over 400 acres. As regards the distribution of these holdings the rule is the more fertile the subdivision and the larger its area of watered land the smaller are the holdings. Thus in 1879-80 in Kar\u00e1d, which is probably the most fertile sub-division of the district, 81\u00b734 per cent of the holdings were under twenty acres and 31\u00b727 per cent were under five acres; while in M\u00e1n, the poorest sub-division, only six per cent were under five acres and 27\u00b725 per cent under twenty acres. Again in M\u00e1n 32\u00b77 per cent of the holdings were between fifty and 200 acres against 4\u00b78 per cent in Kar\u00e1d. In the hilly sub-divisions of W\u00e1i, Javli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, and V\u00e1lva the number of small holdings is larger. As, though entered in one name, many of the large holdings are jointly occupied by large families, it may be stated as approximately correct that ten or fifteen acres of a fair dry crop holding in the rich western valleys will support a holder with a family of three or four persons in decent comfort, while in the barren east twenty to thirty acres are required even for less easy and certain subsistence.\n\nIn the plains the black soil is generally so heavy as to make ploughing impossible with less than four bullocks and in many places as many as six pairs are required. To raise the full number of bullocks poor landholders with small holdings borrow from each other or hire. In jir\u00e1yat or dry crop soil a pair of oxen can plough ten to twelve acres, in m\u00e1l or broken trap soil in the eastern subdivisions a pair can plough twenty-five to thirty acres, and in the hilly soil five to thirty acres according to the steepness of the field and the depth of the soil.\n\nAccording to the Collector's yearly returns the 1882-83 field stock included 55,724 ploughs of which 31,855 were for two bullocks and 23,869 for four bullocks; 18,275 carts of which 1,241 were riding carts and 17,034 were load carts, 246,921 bullocks, 152,640 cows, 115,311 buffaloes of which 82,711 were females and 32,600 males, 13,390 horses mares and colts, 4,394 donkeys, 425,374 sheep and goats, 31 camels, and 5 elephants.\n\nOf field tools the chief are the plough or n\u00e1ngar, the seed drill called p\u00e1bar or kuri, the harrow or kulav, the weeder or kolpa, and the mud harrow or chikhl\u00e1che aut. The plough is of two kinds, the large or thorla n\u00e1ngar and the n\u00e1ngri or small hand plough. A plough drawn by a pair of oxen costs about 2s. (Re. 1). The seed drill has its teeth or phanis communicating with tubes or nalis\nwhich end in a box called ch\u0101de. This box the sower keeps filling with seed which passes through the tubes into the furrows made by the teeth. According to the soil the seed drill is drawn by two to eight bullocks and costs about 4s. (Rs. 2). After the seed drill, to cover the seed, the harrow or kulav is drawn. It is an iron blade or p\u0101s fastened to two upright teeth fixed in a harrow frame and costing about 2s. (Re. 1). When the crop is about a foot high, the weeder or kolpa is used to clean the field of grass and weeds. The weeder has a small harrow frame with two iron blades bent near the middle at right angles, the upper part of each blade being fixed into opposite sides of the frame at an acute angle to the frame and at an obtuse angle to the ground, and the lower part pointing inwards and horizontally towards the corresponding part of the other blade. These two horizontal pieces pass through the ground about a couple of inches deep and turn up the surface on both sides of the crop. The mud harrow, costing 1s. to 1s. 6d. (8-12 as.), is used in rice fields in turning up the ground to receive the seedlings when ready for planting. Of small field tools the chief are the large and small hoes kudal and kudali, the spade or p\u00e1vda, the axe or kurh\u00e1d, the pruning knives and sickles or p\u00e1yla and koyti, the manure rake or d\u00e1tale, the trowel or khurpa, and the reaping sickle or vila. All cultivators have not the plough and the seed-drill, but very few are without the smaller field tools.\n\nAt present (1883) S\u00e1t\u00e1ra has six works for watering land. These are the Rev\u00e1ri canal on the V\u00e1sna, the Yerla canals on the Yerla, the Gondoli canal on the M\u00e1n, the M\u00e1yni reservoir on the V\u00e1ng, the Chikhli canal on the N\u00e1ndni, and the Krishna canal on the Krishna. Of these six works the Rev\u00e1ri canal is an old work restored, and the other five are new works. Of the six works the Krishna canal which has its source in the Sahy\u00e1dris, has an unfailing supply of water, while the Rev\u00e1ri, Yerla, Gondoli, M\u00e1yni, and Chikhli water works chiefly depend on the local rainfall.\n\nThe Rev\u00e1ri Canal lies on the V\u00e1sna, a feeder of the Krishna in Koregaon. The V\u00e1sna rises in the Mah\u00e1dev range which runs south-east to the borders of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district, forming the water-shed between the Krishna and the Bhima valleys. The V\u00e1sna falls into the Krishna ten miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the head works of the canal lie about eleven miles above the meeting of the rivers. About 1781 the work was originally partially built by one N\u00e1ro App\u00e1ji, the hereditary kulkarni or accountant of Padali, who was a distinguished officer in the Peshwa's service. When N\u00e1ro died, the river work was completed and the canal was unfinished. In 1849, within a year after the district came under the British Government, the work was completed and the canal brought into use. A want of slope in the channel, and the excessive smallness of two tunnels which prevented their being cleared, stopped the flow of water. After the experience of one season the canal was abandoned. In 1863 the irrigation department undertook to restore the work. The descendants of N\u00e1ro App\u00e1ji gave up their claims on the work on condition that they were allowed the free use of water for nine\nacres of land. The massive masonry of the original river work was in perfect repair, all that was wanted was to renew the channel. The canal is four miles long and has a head discharge of fifteen cubic feet a second. It commands 6000 acres of which 5340 are arable. A complete system of distributaries, some of which extend to the Krishna valley, was constructed by the villagers. The work came into use in 1865-66. In 1882-83, of 3624 arable acres under command, 519 acres or 14\u00b732 per cent in the lands of seven Koregaon villages were watered. Of the 519 watered acres 160 were for kharif or early crops and 359 for rabi or late crops. The acre water rates were \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) for the whole year, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months, and 2s. (Re. 1) for early dry crops. The chief crops watered were jivdi 122 acres, wheat 108 acres, groundnut 215 acres, and sugarcane thirty acres. In 1882-83 along the line of the canal were 1574 trees, chiefly babul, mango, and jambul. In 1882-83 the rainfall at Rev\u00e1ri was 40\u00b750 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882-83 it averaged 29\u00b713 inches.\n\nThe Yerla Canals lie on the river Yerla which rises in the Mah\u00e1dev range immediately east of the V\u00e1sna, and joins the Krishna sixty miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The head works of the canals, one on each bank of the river, are on a rocky barrier sixty miles above the meeting of the Krishna and the Yerla. The work was begun in 1867 and finished in 1868. It includes a masonry weir across the river, 538 feet long and sixteen feet high, with regulators at each end forming the headworks of the two canals which are completely bridged and regulated. The right bank canal is nine miles long and the left bank canal 8\u00bd miles. Both canals have a head discharge of forty-two cubic feet the second. The monsoon supply in the river is trustworthy but irregular, and the dry weather discharge generally falls very low. During 1876 the rabi or cold weather supply totally failed. In November the river's discharge was only 2\u00bd cubic feet a second, and water was stored at night and ran down the canals during the day only. To supplement the supply to the Yerla right and left bank canals, the storage reservoir at Nher was begun in 1876, chiefly as a famine relief work, and completed in 1880-81 by ordinary labour. The reservoir lies at the village of Nher on the Yerla river, twenty-two miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and six miles above the headworks of the canals. The dam is 4820 feet long and seventy-four feet in greatest height. The lake, when full, contains 523 millions of cubic feet, the available capacity being 490 millions. The drainage area above the dam site is sixty square miles and the reservoir is calculated to fill with a run-off of 3\u00b751 inches. After filling the reservoir on the right bank a waste weir 700 feet long and with a crest fourteen feet below the top of the dam provides for the escape of flood waters. In 1882-83, of the 7159 net arable acres under command 749 acres or about ten per cent were watered in the lands of nine villages of Khat\u00e1v. Of the 749 watered acres 403 were for kharif or early crops and 346 were for rabi or late crops. The acre water rates were \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) for the whole year, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months, and 2s. (Re. 1) for monsoon dry crops. The chief crops\nwatered were *jv\u00e1ri* fifty-five acres, wheat thirty-nine acres, *khapla* or husked wheat fifty-three acres, groundnut 303 acres, peas thirty-four acres, gram 126 acres, and sugarcane ninety-three acres. In 1882-83 the rainfall at Khadgun was 35.87 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882-83 it averaged 27.58 inches. In 1882-83 7535 trees were growing along the canal chiefly *b\u00e1bhul*, mango, *j\u00e1mbhul*, *nimb*, and *savd\u00e1d*.\n\nThe Gondoli Canal lies on the river M\u00e1n which rises in the Mah\u00e1dev range, a mile and a half north of the village of Gondoli and three miles south of the town of Dahivadi in M\u00e1n. The canal was begun as a relief work in 1867 and completed in 1872. The headworks of the canal are on the site of an old ruined *b\u00e1ndh\u00e1ra* or masonry weir built across a massive rocky barrier. The new weir is of rubble masonry 325 feet long and twenty-four feet high. The canal leading off on the right bank is also entirely new. The canal is eight miles in length and has one main branch, two miles long, leading from the seventh mile. The canal has a head discharge of ten cubic feet of water a second. The canal near its head crosses two deep ravines on light wrought-iron aqueducts. With this exception the masonry works are simple, consisting of ordinary escapes. The head of the canal lies near the source of the river, the drainage area being only sixty-eight square miles. The supply of water is meagre, and even during the monsoon is fitful and uncertain. To increase the water supply the Pingli lake was chosen and surveyed in 1874-75 as a storage lake. The Pingli lake lies three miles above the headworks of the Gondoli canal on a small feeder of the M\u00e1n. The work was begun in October 1876 as a famine relief work and completed in April 1878. The lake is formed by an earthen dam 5200 feet long with a greatest height of fifty-four feet. The full supply level is nine feet below the top of the dam, giving a greatest depth of storage of forty-five feet. The outlet level is sixteen feet above the bottom of the reservoir, and the available depth of storage is twenty-nine feet. The escape of flood water, after the filling of the lake, is provided for by a waste weir 750 feet long, partly dug out and partly built, with a masonry wall on the right flank of the dam. A greatest flood is calculated to rise three feet on this weir that is to six feet below the top of the dam. The outlet is an oval masonry culvert with masonry head wall connected with the dam by a light wrought-iron bridge. Two sluices, each two feet square are provided, closed by iron gates. The area of the catchment basin of the lake is twenty square miles. The average rainfall is estimated at 18.43 inches, and the average yearly supply of water, taking the run-off as one-fourth the rainfall, is estimated at 214 millions of cubic feet. The available capacity of the lake above the outlet level is 195 millions of cubic feet. The Pingli lake was opened in 1878-79, and is to be joined to the Gondoli canal by a canal three miles long and commanding an area of 1100 acres between the Pingli lake and the Gondoli canal. At present (1883-84) the Gondoli canal is supplied by getting water down the main stream and picking it up near the Gondoli canal by a small masonry weir and a connecting channel. In 1882-83, of the\n3010 arable acres under command, 300 acres or ten per cent were watered in eight villages of M\u00e1n. Of the 300 watered acres 118 were for kharif or early crops and 182 for rabi or late crops. The acre water rates were \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) for the whole year, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months, and 2s. (Re.1) for monsoon dry crops. The chief watered crops were bajri twenty-six acres, jv\u00e1ri twenty-four acres, khapla or husked wheat eighty-six acres, groundnut thirty-eight acres, gram fifty-seven acres, and sugarcane twenty-five acres. In 1882-83 the rainfall at Gondoli was 21.99 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882-83 it averaged 21.33 inches. In 1882-83 along the canal 2234 trees were growing chiefly b\u00e1bhul and nimb.\n\nThe M\u00e1yni Lake is on the V\u00e1ng river a feeder of the Yerla. The headwork of the canal lies about six miles above the meeting of the V\u00e1ng with the Yerla and forty-five miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The work was begun in 1868 and opened in 1875-76. When full the lake has an area of 380 acres and holds 190 millions of cubic feet of water. It is formed by an earthen dam 2870 feet long and fifty-seven feet in greatest height, and has a ten-mile long canal on the left bank. The catchment area of the river above the dam is fifty-four square miles and the lake is estimated to fill with a run-off of 1\u00bd inches from this area. The escape of flood waters is provided for by a waste weir 600 feet long on the left bank. The crest of the weir is thirteen feet below the top of the dam. The level at which the canal takes off is thirty-one feet below the crest of the waste weir. The head discharge of the canal is thirty-three cubic feet a second. In 1882-83, of 4625 arable acres under command 742 acres or about sixteen per cent were watered. Of the 742 watered acres 467 were for kharif or early and 275 for rabi or late crops. The acre water rates were \u00a31 (Rs. 10) for the whole year, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months, and 2s. (Re.1) for rain crops. The chief crops watered were jv\u00e1ri fifty-six acres, khapla or husked wheat fifty-eight acres, groundnut 315 acres, gram eighty-nine acres, and sugarcane seventy-five acres. In 1882-83 the rainfall at M\u00e1yni was 27.37 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882-83 it averaged 25.19 inches. In 1882-83 along the line of the canal were 938 b\u00e1bhuls and casuarinas.\n\nThe Chikhli Canal lies on the right bank of the N\u00e1ndni, a feeder of the Yerla. The N\u00e1ndni rises eight miles south of the head of the Yerla canals, and joins the Yerla river twenty-eight miles above the meeting of the Yerla and the Krishna. At the site of the canal head works, six miles above the meeting of the N\u00e1ndni and the Yerla, the N\u00e1ndni has a catchment area of 160 square miles. The canal was partly made as a famine relief work in 1866-67 and was opened in 1870. The weir which forms the head works of the canal is of rubble masonry. It stands on the site of a disused temporary dam. The canal, which is about six miles long, is completely bridged and has a head discharge of fifteen cubic feet a second. In 1882-83, of 1478 arable acres under command 217 acres or 14.68 per cent were watered in the lands of four Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur villages. Of the\n217 watered acres, 179 were for *kharif* or early crops and thirty-eight for *rabi* or late crops. The acre water rates were \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) for the whole year, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months, and 2s. (Re. 1) for monsoon dry crops. The chief crops watered were *khapla* and *r\u0101la* each sixteen acres, groundnut 132 acres, sugarcane eight acres, and chillies twenty-two acres. In 1882-33 the rainfall at Chikhli was 38.38 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882-33 it averaged 25.03 inches. In 1882-33 along the line of the canal were 2524 trees chiefly *b\u0101bhuls* and mangoes.\n\nThe Krishna Canal lies on the left bank of the Krishna, and besides in certain villages of the Pant Pratinidhi and S\u0101ngli states, waters land in the sub-divisions of Kar\u0101d, V\u00e1lva, and T\u0101sgaon. Almost the whole watered area lies between the canal and the river. The headworks lie on the Krishna opposite the village of Khodsi, about two miles above the town of Kar\u0101d at the meeting of the Krishna with the Koyna. The total drainage area of the Krishna at the site of the headworks is 1247 square miles. The supply lasts throughout the year. Although it is abundant during the rains it falls to a comparatively scanty stream during the hot weather, and the discharge has been registered as low as twenty-four cubic feet the second. To remedy this scanty supply a scheme is under consideration proposing to make a storage lake on a feeder of the Krishna. The Krishna canal works were sanctioned in 1863 and opened in 1868. They consist of a weir across the river at Khodsi with a canal taken off on the left bank thirty-five miles long, completely bridged and regulated. The weir is of rubble masonry 1200 feet long and twenty-one feet in greatest height, narrowing from nineteen feet at the base to eight feet at the crest. The weir has a batter of one in six on the downstream side. A small subsidiary weir below forms a pond to break the force of the falling water. To store the water brought by slight freshes provision is made for raising a temporary earthen dam on the crest of the weir. On the right bank is a wing wall with an embankment above, and escapes are formed at both flanks to aid the closing of the earthen dam. The weir is continued by a curved wall up to the regulator which is thrown well back from the river bank. In this wall are four scouring sluices, one of which lies close to the regulator. The regulator is a simple block of masonry with nine under-sluices having thirty-four feet of waterway. These are closed by planks, working in grooves, and raised and lowered by screws worked from the platform above. Their sills are fixed so that, if necessary, the head of the canal may be deepened. The canal is thirty-five miles long with a bottom width at head of eleven feet and side slopes in soil of 1\u00bd to one, and a bed fall of one foot in the mile. Further down the size and slope of the canal slightly changes. The bed fall remains one foot a mile for the first thirty miles and for the remaining three is increased to one foot and a quarter. The bottom breadth remains at eleven feet for the first fifteen miles, narrows to ten feet between the fifteenth and the twentieth mile, to nine feet between the twentieth and twenty-fifth mile, to eight feet between the twenty-fifth and thirtieth mile,\nand to six feet between the thirtieth and thirty-third mile. Cross drainage is secured by eleven aqueducts, forty-two culverts, and twenty-three escapes, and communication is provided by fourteen bridges and twelve paved crossings. The pavements of the crossings, which at first were above the bed level and caused the canal to silt, were lowered in 1877. Except at the head there are no masonry regulators. Before 1871 distributing channels were made by the landholders, the supply being through earthenware drain pipes laid under the embankment and closed by plugs and mud. In 1872 a complete system of fifty-four distributing channels was sanctioned at an estimated cost of \u00a31231 (Rs. 12,310). With a depth of four feet of water the canal was estimated to discharge 140 cubic feet a second, with a velocity of 2\u00b71, but using Bazin's formula, the mean velocity at head would be only 1\u00b753 feet and the discharge 104 cubic feet the second. Besides watering land this canal supplies the town of Kar\u00e1d with water by a six-inch cast-iron pipe laid across the Krishna in the form of an inverted syphon, and ending in a reservoir on the opposite bank. From this reservoir the water is distributed through the town by earthenware pipes with dipping wells at intervals. The cost of this work was borne by the Kar\u00e1d municipality, who also pay for water at the rate for perennial crops, the yearly payment being about \u00a322 (Rs. 220) on an estimated daily consumption of 66,000 gallons.\n\nIn 1882-83, of the 25,533 arable acres under command 3023 or about eleven per cent were watered in the lands of thirty-one villages of Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, and T\u00e1sgaon. Of the 3023 watered acres, 1498 were for kharif or early crops and 1525 for rabi or late crops. The acre water rates were \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18) for the whole year, 8s. (Rs. 4) for eight months, 4s. (Rs. 2) for four months, and 2s. (Re. 1) for monsoon dry crops. The chief crops watered were rice 109 acres, ju\u00e1ri eighty-six acres, khopla or husked wheat 174 acres, groundnut 1327 acres, sugarcane 1050 acres, chillies eighty-two acres, and tobacco forty-one acres. In 1882-83 the rainfall at Gond village was 48\u00b703 inches, and during the ten years ending 1882-83 it averaged 27\u00b727 inches. In 1882-83 along the line of the canal were 27,368 trees, chiefly b\u00e1bhul, mango, nimb, bamboo, sandal, and hingan, and 7866 saplings, chiefly b\u00e1bhul, mango, j\u00e1mbhul, bamboo, nimb, and karanj.\n\nBesides these six works, all of which are in use, the Mhasvad Lake is being built as a separate water work on the lower M\u00e1n. The Mhasvad lake scheme had been under investigation for several years, but the work was not begun till the 1876 famine. It includes a large lake on the river M\u00e1n in the M\u00e1n sub-division, with a high level canal leading thirteen miles and commanding the area between the M\u00e1n and the Bhima, including fifty-six villages of Pandharpur and S\u00e1ngola in Shol\u00e1pur with a total area of 252,402 acres or 394 square miles. The lake, which has a catchment area of 480 square miles and a full supply depth of sixty-seven feet is formed by an earthen dam 9000 feet long and with a greatest height of eighty feet. The masonry waste weir for the escape of floods is 3000 feet long. The lake covers an area of 4014 acres or six square miles and can hold 2585 millions of cubic feet of water. The canal which\ndistributes the water is seventeen miles long and with numerous branch canals, runs down the water-shed from the point at which the high level canal passes through the water-shed. In an average year the water-supply would suffice for an area of 30,000 acres. The work may be said to protect an area of 90,000 acres one-third of which may be watered every year.\u00b9 The country under command of this canal stands in great need of water as its rainfall is very uncertain. The estimated cost is \u00a3147,623 10s. (Rs. 14,76,235) and the total expenses to the end of 1882-83 are \u00a373,648 (Rs. 7,36,480).\n\nBesides at Kar\u00e1d where water is supplied from the Krishna canal, two reservoirs, at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Isl\u00e1mpur, supply the towns with drinking water. The works now in hand for improving the water-supply of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town are a storage lake at Kas, and a canal to bring the water of the lake into the old conduit at Yavteshvar about two miles west of the town. The lake is on the Urmodi river about a mile and a half from its source close to the village of Kas in J\u00e1vli and thirteen miles in a straight line west by north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The catchment area of the lake is only 2\u00be square miles but as the average yearly rainfall is 157 inches the supply is ample and certain. The dam, which is of earth with a puddle trench below, is 714 feet long and 56'41 feet at the highest point. The width of the top is ten feet and it has a slope of three to one on the water side and of two to one on the other side. The lake's full supply level is 3671'04 feet above mean sea level, and the top of the dam is 15'9 feet higher. The water face of the dam is pitched with stone, the thickness increasing gradually from six inches at the bottom to nine inches at the top. When full the lake covers 137 acres and holds 73,737,000 cubic feet of water. As the contents of the lake above the level of the outlet sluice are 60,740,000 cubic feet and the loss by evaporation is estimated at 15,310,000 cubic feet, the available storage is 45,430,000 cubic feet.\n\nThe water is drawn from the lake by a regulating sluice, consisting of a culvert through the dam, having a tower at one end and a discharging basin at the other. The tower carries on its face a two feet square sluice gate, which is raised and lowered by a capstan worked at the top of the tower. The greatest discharge from the sluice is eighty cubic feet the second. The waste weir, which is sixty feet long, is cut out of the solid rock on the left bank of the river. The highest flood level is 8'9 feet above the crest of the weir. This is estimated to give a discharge of 5400 cubic feet a second, equal to a run-off of three inches an hour from the catchment area of the lake. The canal which is taken off from the left bank of the river, is carried under the waste weir channel which crosses it by an over-passage. The bed fall of the canal is four feet a mile, and the ruling section is 1\u00bc feet bottom width, side slopes 1\u00bd to one, top of banks three feet wide and three feet above canal bed, and depth of water 1\u00bd. In its length of about 15\u00bd miles the canal has over 200 cross drainage works, including forty aqueducts, seventy-seven culverts, fifty masonry over-passages, three inverted syphons, consisting of iron\n\n\u00b9 Public Works Department Administration Report of 1876-77.\npipes twelve to fifteen inches in diameter for crossing large streams, and three aqueducts or water-leads formed of an iron trough supported on beams and masonry piers. At the end of the fourth mile the canal is taken to a lower terrace, first running down a stream till it is picked up by a masonry weir and discharged down a zigzag masonry channel into an inlet chamber below. The total fall at this place is 232 feet. In the sixth and ninth miles the canal passes through three closed masonry channels 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet wide and 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet high of a length of 300 feet 600 feet and 325 feet. In the ninth and tenth miles, where the hill side is exceedingly steep and difficult, the canal for 3400 feet will be carried partly in embankments supported by dry stone retaining walls and partly by an iron trough supported by beams resting on masonry piers. The estimated cost of the whole works is \u00a336,916 8s. (Rs. 3,69,164). Up to 1883-84 \u00a310,354 6s. (Rs. 1,03,543) were spent on the lake and head works and this part of the work is practically complete. The estimated cost of the canal is \u00a326,098 4s. (Rs. 2,60,982). Except about three miles, the channel is nearly finished. Most of the masonry drainage works are ready, but the special iron syphon pipes and iron troughs and some of the closed channel remain to be done. The work will be nearly finished before July 1884.\n\nThe Isl\u00e1mpur Lake, which is a mile south of the town of Isl\u00e1mpur, is for the water-supply of Isl\u00e1mpur in the V\u00e1lva subdivision. The works, which include a storage lake and a channel, were begun as a famine relief work in 1876 and finished in 1879. The lake, which is able to hold twenty-five millions of cubic feet of water, is formed by an earthen dam 2892 feet long and thirty-one feet in greatest height. The area of the catchment basin is 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) square miles. The escape of floods is provided by a waste weir 200 feet long. The water is carried to the town along an open channel. No distribution is provided, the main intention being to keep the existing reservoir and wells in the town well supplied. The estimated cost was \u00a34888 10s. (Rs. 43,885) and the expenditure was \u00a36686 (Rs. 66,860).\n\nBesides these large water works, sub-divisional returns show 5990 wells with steps, 15,979 wells without steps, seventy-two pakka or permanent and 2427 kachcha or temporary dams, 1992 dhekuris or water-lifts, 157 ponds and reservoirs, seventeen canals, and 2314 streams and springs. The cost of building wells varies greatly in different parts of the district. They are of every description from holes sunk in the rock or soil to carefully built wells faced with stone; comparatively few are lined with brick. In murum or broken trap soils wells require little building for the subsoil is very hard though it is easily pierced. The broken trap soil of the eastern subdivisions supplies a number of cheap wells which would be very effective but for the capricious rainfall. One season of good rainfall gives these wells a two years' supply. Along the higher valleys of the Sahy\u00e1dris the villages often suffer severely from want of water. The people lack capital to sink wells in the hard rock and the water near the surface or in wells sunk in the softer soils runs off during the dry weather.\nThe best garden land producing sugarcane, turmeric, betel leaves, vegetables, and fruits is constantly manured. The full acre allowance of manure in these gardens is estimated at 4000 pounds a year; for ordinary garden land 1600 pounds are enough. Dry crop lands are generally enriched every fourth year with 1000 pounds of manure. When both early and late crops are grown, they are grown in rotation; when only early crops are grown there is no rule. In kumri or wood-ash tillage the ground is allowed to lie fallow for six seven and even twelve years.\n\nIn the Sahy\u00e1dri villages there is much variety of soil. On the crest of the Sahy\u00e1dris the soil is miserably poor and scanty and is washed away by the yearly deluge of over two hundred inches. Nearer the plains the land is richer and both rice lands and gardens are frequent. Ordinary dry crop tillage is rare as the prevailing system is wood-ash or kumri. In wood-ash or kumri tillage, on the tops and steepest slopes of the Sahy\u00e1dris between March and May the brushwood with the branches twigs and sometimes the very trunks of the larger trees are cut down and strewn over the ground. These and the grass are set on fire and allowed to burn themselves out. Before the rains begin in early June the surface is turned by a hoe, as the plough can seldom be used, and the seed is sown broadcast in the ashes which to a great extent serve both as soil and manure. After one cutting and burning the land will bear cropping a second and in some cases a third year. After two or three years' cropping the land must lie fallow eight to twelve years. A similar system known as the r\u00e1b system is practised on the lower slopes and in the valleys. It is much the same as the practice in growing rice. A plot of land called tarva or nursery is spread with leafy twigs, which are cut and stacked between March and May. Over the twigs, when it is available, is spread a layer of dung, then a layer of grass and straw, and lastly some dry earth to prevent the materials below burning too quickly. This whole is set fire to and left to burn generally in late April and early May. In this bed the seed is sown on the first fall of rain in early June. After the first heavy fall the rest of the field is ploughed and in July when they are four to six inches high, the seedlings are planted from the seed-bed into the field. Unlike rice seedlings, the seedlings of r\u00e1gi, vari, and other poor hill grains have not to be planted.\u2014They are dropped at irregular intervals over the field and left to take root. In this way land may be cropped three or four years; it then wants a four or five years' rest. The best kumri lands can be cropped every second year or in some places even every year. Between the fields which can be cropped every year and the bare hill tops are lands of every variety of soil. Only the coarsest crops are grown in these woodash or kumri lands, n\u00e1chni or n\u00e1gli Eleusine corocana, s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, k\u00e1lli a variety of n\u00e1chni, vari Panicum miliare, and r\u00e1l\u00e1 Panicum italicum.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 13,78,659 acres held for tillage, 278,604 or 20\u00b72 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 1,100,055\n\n---\n\n1 Evidence collected by the Famine Commission, 30.\nacres 36,955 were twice cropped. Of the 1,137,010 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 891,622 acres or 78\u00b742 per cent, of which 389,636 were under spiked millet bajri Penicillaria spicata, 321,305 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 45,057 under r\u00e1gi or n\u00e1chni Eleusine corocana, 31,725 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 23,739 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 18,984 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 14,458 under Italian millet r\u00e1l\u00e1 or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 9959 under maize makka Zea mays, 1319 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, 67 under kodra or harik Paspalum scrobiculatum, and 35,373 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 156,529 acres or 13\u00b777 per cent, of which 44,296 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 31,322 under tur Cajanus indicus, 27,514 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 9703 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 3401 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 539 under peas v\u00e1t\u00e1na Pisum sativum, 178 under masur Ervum lens, and 39,576 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 43,865 acres or 3\u00b786 per cent, of which 1854 were under gingelly seed til Sesamum indicum, 860 under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, and 41,151 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 14,161 acres or 1\u00b724 per cent, of which 10,591 were under cotton k\u00e1pus Gossypium herbaceum, 2152 under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea, 985 under brown hemp amb\u00e1di Hibiscus cannabinus, and 433 under other fibres. Miscellaneous crops occupied 30,833 acres or 2\u00b771 per cent, of which 9151 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 8336 under sugar-cane us Saccharum officinarum, 6658 under tobacco tambdhu Nicotiana tabacum, 367 under hemp g\u00e1nja Cannabis sativa, 20 under safflower kusumba or kardai Carthamus tinctorius, five under coffee Coffee arabica, and the remaining 6296 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe following are the chief details of the more important crops:\n\nSpiked Millet, bajri, Penicillaria spicata, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 389,636 acres, is a finer grain than jv\u00e1ri and requires more careful treatment and the help of water or manure. It is commonly grown in shallow black or light gravelly soils. It is sown in June or July and harvested in October or early November. Other grains are often sown with bajri the usual proportions in a mixed crop being thirty-two parts of bajri to one of r\u00e1l\u00e1, four of math, two of amb\u00e1di, one of til, and four of tur. These crops ripen in the order named from mid-October to mid-February. Bajri is chiefly used as a bread grain, though it is sometimes made into l\u00e1hi or parched millet. The stalks, called sarmad, are given to cattle, but are considered inferior to almost all other fodder unless trodden to pieces and mixed with chaff. The green ears are parched and eaten under the name of limbur. Two to 2\u00bd pounds of bajri including the pulses which are generally mixed with it are usually sown to the acre. The better the soil the less the seed. The average acre yield of unwatered bajri is about 300 pounds.\n\nIndian Millet, jv\u00e1ri, Sorghum vulgare, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 321,305 acres, is the staple grain of the desh or open country. Jv\u00e1ri is the only cereal whose straw is used as fodder in its natural\nstate. In the moist west the stores of *jv\u00e1ri* stalks are stacked and thatched, in the dry east they are stowed in long grave-like ridges and covered with clods of black soil. The straw of all other cereals and of all pulses is trodden into pieces mixed with chaff, and stowed in large baskets under the name of *bhuskut*. Five chief kinds of *jv\u00e1ri* are grown in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, *dudhmogra*, *k\u00e1lbondi*, *sh\u00e1l\u00fa*, *t\u00e1mbad*, and *utavli* or *argadi*. Of these *k\u00e1lbondi* and *utavli* are early or *kharif*, *dudhmogra*, *sh\u00e1l\u00fa*, and *t\u00e1mbad* are late or *rabi* crops. *Sh\u00e1l\u00fa* the most esteemed variety is grown in black soils seldom with water or manure. It is sown between mid-August and mid-October and harvested between mid-January and mid-February. The grain is white, the stalk is thin, three to five feet high, and has much sweet juice. It is the chief staple of the richest Krishna valley black soil. Its grain is considered the sweetest and best of all the varieties. The stalk gives nourishing though rather coarse fodder. *Utavli* or *argadi* is usually grown without water and generally without manure in shallow black and light soils. It is sown in June or July and is harvested in November. The stalk grows sometimes ten feet high, and the head is small. *Utavli* is also sown in watered land in April. If hot weather *utavli* is grown for grain, it is called *hundi* and ripens in June or July; if it is grown for fodder it is called *kadval*, is sown broadcast and very thick, and is cut before the head begins to show. *K\u00e1lbondi* that is black-husked, is grown without water or manure. It is sown in June or July and harvested in November. The stem is six to eight feet high and the head large. *Dudhmogra* or milky, is sown mixed or in alternate furrows with *sh\u00e1l\u00fa* from mid-August to mid-October and harvested with it between mid-January and mid-February. The grain is very full and milky and is much esteemed when made into *l\u00e1hi*. The stalk is a poor fodder being straight and hard. Its thin feathery head gives birds no foothold and saves it from their attacks. The stem of the dark-husked *dudhmogra* is sometimes used as a weaver\u2019s hand-rod. *T\u00e1mbad* or red *jv\u00e1ri*, is generally grown in light soils without water or manure. It is sown between early-August and early-October and is reaped in January. The grain is hard and the stalk which is three or four feet high is poor fodder. Besides these five kinds of *jv\u00e1ri*, the staple crop of middle class soils in the southern Krishna and Yerla valleys is called *dukhri*. It is very large grained and coarse. In the black soil of V\u00e1lva and T\u00e1sgaon it often grows as high as sixteen feet. It is reaped in December or early January and is sometimes sown in rotation with *sh\u00e1l\u00fa*. *Dukhri* and *sh\u00e1l\u00fa* give coarse fodder. The local names given to *jv\u00e1ri* in its different stages are: the seed *jondhala jv\u00e1ri*, the plant before the head forms *kadval*, the perfect plant *batuk*, and the ripe stalk *kadba*. *Jv\u00e1ri* plants growing with *b\u00e1jri* and *tur* are also called *kadval*. *Jv\u00e1ri* is chiefly in use as a bread grain; but is also eaten parched in *l\u00e1hi*. The unripe heads, parched and called *hurda*, are a favourite food with the labouring classes. *Utavli* and *k\u00e1lbondi* the early or *kharif* varieties require eight to ten pounds of seed to the acre, the better the soil the less the seed; *dudhmogra*, *sh\u00e1l\u00fa*, and *t\u00e1mbad* the late or *rabi* varieties do not require more than four to five pounds of seed the acre.\nR\u00e1gi or N\u00e1chni, Eleusine corocana, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 45,057 acres, is grown sometimes in wet lands by planting like rice and sometimes both in marshy and high-lying lands is sown by the drill. It is sown in June and ripens in October or November. It wants moisture but does not require either a deep or a rich soil. The straw, broken and mixed with chaff, is used for fodder. The green heads are parched and eaten, and like jv\u00e1ri heads are called hurda. The dry grain is used for bread. Though it is generally believed that n\u00e1chni is far less nutritive than b\u00e1ri or jv\u00e1ri, the hill people assert that one n\u00e1chni cake is worth three of jv\u00e1ri.\n\nWheat, gahu, Triticum aestivum, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 31,725 acres, is grown all over the district as a cold-weather crop being sown in October and November and reaped in February and March. It requires a moister climate than jv\u00e1ri. It is generally grown as a dry crop, but much watered wheat is also raised in all parts of the district. Two kinds of wheat are grown, bakshi and khapla. Bakshi which is usually watered and manured, is sown in rich black soil in October or November and reaped in February or March. It is the finest variety of wheat, but from its want of hardiness is not much grown. The stem is longer, sometimes five feet high, and the grain is larger than in other varieties, and the beard when ripe is tipped with black. The straw when broken and mixed with chaff is used as fodder. Khapla also called jod or husked wheat, always watered and manured, is sown in good black soil in November and is reaped in March. Its hardiness makes this the favourite garden wheat. It is called khapla because the grain cannot be separated from the husk without pounding. The broken straw is given to cattle as fodder. Wheat is chiefly a rich man's grain, as except on feast-days it is seldom eaten by the poor because clarified butter is always taken with it. The flour is much used in pastry and sweetmeats. From 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd pounds of wheat are sown to the acre, the better the soil the less the seed.\n\nS\u00e1va, Panicum miliaceum, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 23,739 acres is grown without water or manure in light red soils and on hill sides. The grain needs pounding to separate it from the husk. It is mostly eaten boiled like rice and is seldom made into bread. The straw is not used as fodder.\n\nRice, bh\u00e1t, Oryza sativa, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 18,984 acres, is one of the chief products of J\u00e1vli and P\u00e1tan and parts of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and W\u00e1i. Many varieties of rice are grown. An inferior variety is sown to a limited extent under irrigation. The better kinds are sown in a bed manured with burnt cowdung or wood-ashes. The seed is sown after the first rainfall in June, the field is ploughed as soon as the earth is soaked, and in July the seedlings are planted, and the crop is ready for cutting in October or November. The poorer sorts are generally sown broadcast, or by drill in poor rice-fields or on high ground in June and ripen in September. A poor rice known as dodka is grown under irrigation chiefly in the W\u00e1i, J\u00e1vli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, Kar\u00e1d, and V\u00e1lva sub-divisions, being sown in June and reaped in September. Rice requires pounding to separate the grain from the husk. The grain of the\nbetter sorts is chiefly used by the richer classes and on marriage and other festive occasions by the poor. It is chiefly eaten boiled; very little is made into bread. The straw when broken and mixed with chaff is used as fodder.\n\nItalian Millet, r\u0101la, Panicum italicum, in 1881-82 covered 14,458 acres. It is grown without water or manure in shallow black or light soils, usually in the same field as bajri. It is sown in June and ripens in October. The grain is separated from the husk by pounding and is boiled and eaten whole. The stalk is used as fodder and as thatch.\n\nMaize, makka, Zea mays, in 1881-82 covered 9959 acres. It is grown in black soil without water. It is sown in June and ripens in August; as a watered crop it may be grown at any season. The heads are usually eaten green and are known as bhutta. The ripe grain is also made into l\u0101hi and ground to flour for various purposes. The stalk is a very coarse fodder.\n\nBarley, s\u0101tu or jav, Hordeum hexastichon, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 1319 acres, is grown in black soil. It is sown in November and reaped in February. Barley is used chiefly in making s\u0101uche-pith or barley-flour. For this the grain is parched, ground, mixed with gram and wheat flour and flavoured with seeds. When eaten it is usually moistened and rolled into little dough balls. The grain also is used in certain religious ceremonies.\n\nGram, harbhara, Cicer arietinum, of several kinds and colours with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 44,296 acres is much grown. It is grown in good black soil usually without manure as a dry crop and sometimes with manure and water. It is sown in November and cut in February. The grain is eaten green as a vegetable and either boiled or parched when it is called havla; when ripe it is split into d\u0101l and eaten boiled or parched in a variety of ways; the ripe grain is given to horses, and the dry stalks are good fodder.\n\nPigeon Pea, tur, Cajanus indicus, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 31,322 acres, is grown generally in shallow and sometimes in deep black soil. It is sown without water or manure in alternate lines in the same field with early crops in June but is not harvested till January or February. During the eight months it is on the ground, tur is said to flower and seed eight times, all the pods remaining on the plant till harvest. It is a perennial plant but is never allowed to stand in the field after the first year. Tur is one of the most largely grown pulses in the district. The green pods are eaten as a vegetable; the ripe pulse is split and eaten in a variety of ways, both parched and boiled; the leaves and pod-shells are excellent fodder. The stem is used for wattling house walls and roofs, and for making baskets and brooms. Tur charcoal known as doll that is d\u0101l bush charcoal, has long been valued for making gunpowder.\n\nKulthi or Hulga, Dolichos biflorus, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 27,514 acres, is grown in shallow light soils without water or manure. It is generally sown in June with bajri in separate rows, and ripens in November. The pulse is either split and eaten as d\u0101l or boiled whole, and is used in soups and porridge. It is given to horses boiled. The leaves and stalk are good fodder.\nChapter IV.\n\nAgriculture.\n\nCrops.\n\nUd\u012bd, Phaseolus radiatus, in 1881-82 covered 9703 acres. It is grown like mug in rich soils when a second crop is to follow without water or manure. It is frequently sown with b\u0101jri or arg\u0101di in June and ripens in September. The ripe grain is black. The d\u0101l or split pulse of ud\u012bd is the most esteemed of all pulses. It is parched and ground to make spice balls, and is the chief element in the wafer biscuits called p\u0101pad. The green pods are occasionally used as a vegetable, and the stalks and leaves are good fodder.\n\nMug, Phaseolus mungo, in 1881-82 covered 3401 acres. It is grown by itself without water or manure, in shallow black or light stony soils, and often as a first crop on rich land in which the hivad or double-crop system is to be followed. It is sown in June and harvested in September. The green pods are eaten as a vegetable. The ripe pulse is eaten boiled whole and split and used as d\u0101l. It is parched, ground to flour, and made into spice balls. It is also made into porridge, and in times of scarcity into bread. The leaves and stalks are good fodder. Mugi, a variety of mug, is sown in June with b\u0101jri or arg\u0101di and reaped in November. Mugi differs from mug by its tendency to creep, by taking longer to ripen, and by having a small blackish pea instead of a dark-green pea.\n\nPeas, v\u0101t\u0101na, Pisum sativum, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 539 acres, are grown in moist ground without manure or water. They are sown in October or November and take four months and a half to ripen. The seed is eaten green as a vegetable, and when ripe is split into d\u0101l and eaten in various ways. The leaves and stalks are good fodder.\n\nMathi or Math, Phaseolus aconitifolius, is grown in shallow black or light stony soils without water or manure. It is almost always sown mixed with b\u0101jri in June and harvested in November. The pulse is split and eaten as d\u0101l in different ways. It is ground to flour and used with the flour of other grains in making cakes; it is also eaten parched or boiled whole with condiments. The grain is given to horses and cattle and the stalks are good fodder.\n\nGingelly Seed, til, Sesamum indicum, in 1881-82 covered 1854 acres. It is of two varieties, gora or white til also called hauri, and kula or black til. The two varieties are apparently the same except in colour; but from its pleasanter appearance in sweetmeats, the white commands a higher price. It is sown in June and cut in November. It is usually grown without water or manure with b\u0101jri either mixed or in separate furrows, and is often sown by itself on land that has long lain fallow. The seed is eaten in various ways, in sweetmeats or as a relish. The seeds yield an oil which in cookery is preferred to all others, and the pend or seed cake from which oil has been pressed is eaten by Kuntis with salt. The plant is not eaten by cattle.\n\nLinseed, javas or alshi, Linum usitatissimum, in 1881-82 covered 860 acres. It is grown in rich black soil without water or manure. It is sown in November and harvested in February. It is often sown in grain or wheat fields in separate furrows or by itself as a separate crop. The seed is eaten as a relish or chatni, and the oil is used in cookery. The fibre of the plant is not used.\nCastor Seed, *erandi*, Ricinus communis, is grown in black soil without water or manure. It is sown either in June or November and is harvested in November or February. It is sometimes grown round other crops, and more often in patches by itself. It is not much grown, and is more used as a lamp-oil than as a medicine. The people extract the oil for home use by boiling the bruised bean and skimming the oil as it rises to the surface. By this process four pounds of the seed yield one pound of oil. The leaf is used as an application for guineaworm, and the dried root as a febrifuge. A large variety of the castor plant, probably Ricinus viridis, is grown in gardens round other crops. Except that the stem and flower of the large variety are green and those of the small variety are red, the two plants do not differ from each other. Both varieties are perennial and would grow to a considerable size if they were allowed to remain on the ground for a second year.\n\nBrown Hemp, *amb\u00e1di*, Hibiscus cannabinus, in 1881-82 covered 985 acres. It is usually grown without water or manure mixed with *b\u00e1jri* in shallow black soils. It is sown in June and harvested in December or January. The young leaves are eaten as a vegetable and have an acid flavour. The seed is sometimes given to cattle, and in times of scarcity is mixed in bread. It is chiefly used as an oilseed, and is always mixed with linseed and *k\u00e1rla* or niger seed before the oil is extracted. The bark yields a valuable fibre which is separated from the stalk by soaking, and is made into ropes and used for various field purposes.\n\nEarthnut, *bhuimug*, Arachis hypogaea, is usually watered and manured, though in favourable situations. If sown early in the rains it will grow without water. It ripens in five months, but is often dug in the fourth month and eaten raw or parched. The ripe nut is sometimes eaten boiled with condiments, but is more frequently used as an oil-seed.\n\nSafflower, *kardai*, Carthamus tinctorious, is largely grown in black soil without water or manure. It is sown in October or November and harvested in February or March. It is often grown with late *jv\u00e1ri* or wheat, either mixed or in separate furrows and is sometimes grown as a separate crop. The young leaves are eaten boiled as a vegetable, and the oil is much esteemed for cookery. In the eastern sub-divisions large flocks of the Demoiselle crane feed on safflower.\n\nNiger Seed, *k\u00e1rla* or *khur\u00e1sni*, Verbesina sativa, is generally grown in shallow black and light soils without water or manure. It is sown in June and harvested in November. The seed is eaten as a relish or *chatni*, but it is chiefly known for its oil, which is universally used by the poorer classes in cooking. The oil-cake is much prized for milch cattle.\n\nCotton, *k\u00e1pus*, Gossypium herbaceum, in 1881-82 covered 10,591 acres. It is grown without water or manure in black soil. It is sown in July and ceases bearing in March. Cotton is the hair or wool that is attached to the seed, and is gathered from the growing plants as the pods burst in three or four pickings. The seed which is known as *sarki* is much prized as food for milch cattle. The stems are used in inferior basket work, and...\ncattle are grazed on the leaves and shoots after the cotton picking is over.\n\nIn 1848, at the suggestion of the Resident the late Sir Bartle Frere, Mr. Vary was sent to S\u00e9t\u00e1ra to introduce New Orleans and other varieties of cotton and to set up cotton gins. In 1850-51, about 60,000 pounds of New Orleans cotton seed were given to husbandmen, and, with great exertions on the part of Mr. Vary, about 3200 acres (4000 bigh\u00e1s) were planted with this seed. Even for the local crop the season was unfavourable and the foreign crop entirely failed. The rain was at first abundant and the plants looked well until September, when, except in a few places where they had been watered, they were destroyed by drought. An experiment was also tried in various parts with sugar-loaf cotton seed. It grew well until the middle of September, when the plants were destroyed by drought. This species was not considered so hardy as the New Orleans. As the husbandmen were discouraged by the experiments of 1850-51, the cultivation of foreign cotton fell to about 1080 acres (1349 bigh\u00e1s) in 1851-52 and to about 300 acres (370 bigh\u00e1s) in 1852-53. It then ceased to be grown. Attempts to introduce Broach cotton proved equally unsuccessful. In 1850-51, along with New Orleans seed, Mr. Vary distributed thirty-five saw gins among the husbandmen, but, as the gins cleaned the cotton of too much dirt and lightened its weight, the few husbandmen who used them in 1850-51, declined to use them again in 1851-52.\n\nTobacco, tamb\u00e1lkhu, Nicotiana tabacum, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 6658 acres, is grown in rich light soils generally with the help of manure and without water. It is sown in seedbeds in August, planted during September, and cut in December. The plant is not allowed to flower. As they appear all buds and branch shoots are nipped off and only eight or ten leaves are allowed to grow. For this reason Kunbis seldom grow tobacco as they fear it will bring sickness on their children. The cultivation is carried on by Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and other low castes who give half the gross produce to the owner of the land. In preparing the leaf for market the cultivator spreads it in the sun till it is thoroughly dry. The leaves are then sprinkled with water, sometimes mixed with surad grass or cow\u2019s urine, and while damp are tightly packed in a pit, or stacked under weights, and covered for eight days during which fermentation sets in. When taken from the pit or stack, the leaves are made into bundles and are ready for market. Tobacco is smoked and chewed by all classes.\n\nSugarcane, us, Saccharum officinarum, with in 1881-82 a tillage area of 8336 acres, is one of the most paying of watered\n\n---\n\n1 Cassel\u2019s Cotton in the Bombay Presidency, 84-86.\n2 The same fear of tobacco growing prevails among the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r Ling\u00e1yat husbandmen and the Gujar\u00e1t Kanbis. The idea seems to be that the narcotic power of tobacco is due to a spirit that lives in the plant, and that if any one destroys its home the tobacco spirit grows angry and attacks the man or the children of the man who made it homeless. This fear of the unhoused spirit seems to be the root of the Buddhist, Jain, and Ling\u00e1yat tenderness for life, Compare Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r Statistical Account, 277.\ncrops. Very great care is taken in its growth, and it thrives best in shallowish soil. Three kinds of sugarcane are grown, white khadya, striped l\u00e1ngdya, and black k\u00e1la or t\u00e1mlda. The ground is ploughed from corner to corner seven or eight times. Weeds, which are seldom found in watered land, are carefully picked out as the ploughing goes on. The clods are broken and levelled, and large quantities of manure are spread over and mixed with the earth either by hand or by a light rake called d\u00e1ta. Furrows, six inches deep and about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet apart, are cut by a deep plough, divided into small beds, and watered. Sugarcane cuttings, about a foot long and three or four inches apart, are dropped lengthwise into the furrows, and pressed by the foot well into the ground. When planted in this way sugarcane is called p\u00e1vlya us or foot-pressed cane. In growing the white or khadya cane, the cuttings are laid in the furrows without dividing the land into beds, and, after levelling the furrows by a beam harrow, the plantation is freely watered. Sugarcane grown in this way is called n\u00e1ngrya us or ploughed cane. The n\u00e1ngrya or ploughed cane being deeper set stands a scanty supply of water better than the p\u00e1vlya or foot-cane, and, if regularly watered, comes to greater perfection. The cuttings are planted sometimes in January and February, but more often in March, and begin to sprout after about fifteen or twenty days. Before it is five feet high the crop is twice or thrice weeded. No further cleaning is wanted as weeds do not thrive under the shade of grown canes. Before the rains set in, when the crop is not more than three feet high, except the white variety which wants only about half as much water, the cane requires a weekly watering, and, after the rains, a watering once every twelve or fifteen days. The crop takes full eleven months to ripen. The sugarcane mill consists of two b\u00e1bhul rollers called husband and wife or navra navri, worked by two or four bullocks. A cane pipe joins the mill to the boiling pan, which is under the charge of the owner of the cane, or of some other trustworthy person, as to choose the proper time to take the pan off the fire requires much knowledge and care. As the fire must be kept burning fiercely, b\u00e1bhul loppings are as much as possible used for fuel. Two men are required to feed the furnace, two to drive the bullocks and cut and supply the cane, one to feed the rollers, and one to see that the juice pipe runs freely. The sugar-mills are the evening resort of all the village. The white cane or khadya is very hard and coarse for eating, but the crop requires less labour and care than the other kinds of cane. It is found over almost the whole district. The cane is usually pressed at night between January and March. It employs a great number of hands. At the time of pressing, the owners never refuse cane or juice to any one, and crowds of beggars throng the fields. They even call passers-by to take some of their sugarcane and juice, believing free-handed gifts are rewarded by a plentiful outturn.\n\nIn$^1$ the year 1860 an experiment was made in the cultivation of\n\n---\n\n$^1$ Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XIX.\n**Chapter IV. Agriculture.**\n\n**Crops. Sugarcane.**\n\n*imphi* Holchus saccharatus or Chinese sugarcane. This plant which is grown in Europe as forage, has an advantage over the ordinary sugarcane in the very short interval required between the sowing and ripening. In the case of *imphi* 100 days only are required. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the result of the first experiment was so far satisfactory that the crop reached a height of eight feet and was much appreciated by cattle. Forty stalks made one pound of molasses. At present (1884) no Chinese sugarcane is grown in the district.\n\nIts uncertain and scanty rainfall makes eastern S\u00e1t\u00e1ra one of the parts of the Bombay Presidency most liable to suffer from failure of crops. The earliest record of famine is the famous Durga Devi famine, which, beginning in 1396, is said to have lasted twelve years and to have spread over all India south of the Narbada. Whole districts were emptied of their people, and for upwards of thirty years, a very scanty revenue was obtained from the territory between the God\u00e1vari and the Krishna.\u00b9 The famine of 1460, which is known as the famine of D\u00e9m\u00e1ji Pant, is remembered over the greater part of the Deccan.\u00b2 In 1520, mainly owing to military disturbances, the crops in the Deccan were destroyed and a famine followed.\u00b3\n\nIn 1629-30 severe famine raged throughout the Deccan. The rains failed for two years causing a grievous loss of life.\u2074 According to local tradition the famine of 1791-92 was the severest ever known. It seems to have come after a series of bad years, when the evils of scanty rainfall were aggravated by disturbance and war. The early rains failed entirely in the Bombay-Karn\u00e1tak, were scanty in the Deccan and Gujar\u00e1t, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and were deficient in the districts along the coast from Broach to Ratn\u00e1giri. In October rain fell abundantly, and the famine was ended by a good harvest in the spring of 1792. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the rupee price of Indian millet is said to have risen to six pounds (3 shers). The Native Governments granted large remissions of revenue, the export of grain was forbidden, and the sale price was fixed. Rice was brought from Bengal to Bombay.\u2075 In native opinion the famine of 1802-3 came next in severity to the 1791-92 famine. It was most felt in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Ahmadnagar, Shol\u00e1pur, Bij\u00e1pur, and Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r; but it also pressed severely on Belgaum, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Poon\u00e1, Surat, and Cutch; elsewhere it was comparatively light. In 1802 rainfall was scanty, but in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the harvest would have been good or fair, but for the ravages of Jasvantr\u00e1o Holkar and his Pendh\u00e1ris who destroyed the early crops as they were coming to maturity and prevented the late crops being sown. This scarcity was followed by the failure of the late rains in 1803. The local loss and scarcity were increased by the inflow of starving people from the districts of the North Deccan where the failure of rain was more complete than in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The result was that the famine was almost as severe in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as in the North Deccan. The pressure was greatest in July and August 1804, and was so grievous that, according to\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, I. 59. \u00b2 Col.

Corn is said to have been sold at two pounds (1 sh\u00e9r) the rupee. About 25,000 strangers are said to have flocked into the town of W\u00e1i in the hope of obtaining relief from the liberality of the Pant Pratinidhi, R\u00e1stia, and other wealthy families and no fewer than 10,000 persons are said to have died in the town of W\u00e1i alone. Abundance of water and plenty of grass, for the early rains (June-August 1803) had been abundant, did much to lighten the general distress.\\(^1\\) In 1824-25 a failure of the early rains caused considerable and widespread scarcity. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Indian millet prices rose to twelve pounds (6 sh\u00e9rs) the rupee. In 1862 a scanty fall of rain in the early part of the season caused widespread scarcity. Grain prices were so high that grain compensation was granted to all Government servants whose monthly salaries were less than \u00a320 (Rs. 200).\\(^2\\)\n\nThe scanty and badly distributed rainfall of 1876, thirty-nine compared with an average of fifty inches, led to failure of crops and distress amounting to famine over about one-half of the district.\\(^3\\) The east and south-east suffered most. As rain held off the early crops failed in M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v, and the greater part of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and T\u00e1sgaon. In addition to this failure of the early rains, September and October passed with only a few showers and but a small area of late crops was sown. With high grain prices, millet at seventeen instead of thirty-five pounds,\\(^4\\) and no demand for field work, the poorer classes fell into distress. The need for Government help began about the beginning of October. The grain-dealers withheld their stores and no grain was offered for sale. The distress and panic, especially among the lower orders of townspeople, were so great that the Collector ordered \u00a3856 (Rs. 8560) worth of jv\u00e1ri from Bombay. The arrival of the grain in November had the excellent effect of showing the grain dealers that they could not at one bound force prices to a famine level. As soon as the traders saw that Government were ready to import grain, they opened their shops and began to import on their own account. From December to March the pressure of distress was lighter as large supplies came into the district. In the hot months, with rising prices, the distress increased. The long period of dry weather in July and August forced grain prices still higher and caused much distress and suffering; but the plentiful and timely rainfall of September and October removed all cause of anxiety. By the close of November the demand for special Government help had ceased.\n\nThe following details show, month by month, the various phases through which distress passed and the measures taken to relieve it. In September 1876 rain so completely held off that people could not prepare their fields for the cold-weather crops. The early crops failed in M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v, and the greater part of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Colonel Etheridge's Report on Past Famines, 76, 80, 87, 97.\n\\(^2\\) Colonel Etheridge's Report, 153.\n\\(^3\\) The estimate was in area 2682 out of a total of 4792 square miles, and in population 461,000 out of 1,062,350.\n\\(^4\\) Thirty-five pounds for millet or b\u00e1jri and thirty-nine pounds for Indian millet or jv\u00e1ri were the ordinary rupee prices.\nT\u00e1sgaon; elsewhere, except in M\u00e1lcolmpeeth where, about the middle of the month there were a few good showers, the crops were withering. In Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and T\u00e1sgaon, fodder was scarce and dear. At S\u00e1t\u00e1ra grain prices rapidly rose till about the end of the month jv\u00e1ri fetched eighteen pounds the rupee. With want of field employment and such high grain prices, the loss caused by the failure of the early crops began to deepen into distress. Early in October there was a little rain at W\u00e1i, and on the 21st showers fell at Koregaon, T\u00e1sgaon, and Isl\u00e1mpur. The early crops continued to wither, while throughout the district, except the sh\u00e1lu, the cold-weather crops were either not sown, or where sown were dying. Cattle were starving for want of fodder, and in Khat\u00e1v and M\u00e1n were being sold at nominal prices or given away. In some places the crops were cut down for fodder. Grain importations had not begun and grain-dealers withheld their stores. Prices rose so high that the Collector thought it necessary to order grain from Bombay. Arrangements were also made with a S\u00e1t\u00e1ra merchant to import grain for sale at a moderate profit. At T\u00e1sgaon grain was so difficult to buy that the Collector sent fifty cartloads of jv\u00e1ri from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. To help the import of grain the municipal dues in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and T\u00e1sgaon were suspended. Great commotion and clamour prevailed, especially among the Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and R\u00e1moshis in Khat\u00e1v and T\u00e1sgaon, and people began to leave the district. Thefts were frequent, and, in T\u00e1sgaon, bands of the poorer classes assembled and demanded work. In the Collector's opinion, had not the arrival of Government grain forced the local dealers to bring forward their stores, these meetings would have turned into grain riots. To allay the disorder local funds works were opened, and, on the 17th, Government placed a sum of \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) at the Collector's disposal for charitable relief. In November only a few showers fell in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, and M\u00e1n. Where they had been sown the late crops withered. In the south and east water was growing scarce. In M\u00e1n the only supply was from holes dug in river beds. Grass and straw were very scarce, and in places even sugarcane was used for fodder. The grain ordered by the Collector arrived from Bombay through Chiplun. Its presence had a favourable effect and stimulated private imports of grain. To stimulate imports treasury orders on Bombay and other large towns were given to traders at par, and it was proposed to remit tolls on grain carts. The rupee price of jv\u00e1ri rose from eighteen pounds at the beginning of the month to sixteen pounds towards the close, and that of b\u00e1jri from twenty to seventeen pounds. There was much movement among the people, some leaving the district, others coming in large numbers from Phaltan, Jath, Miraj, S\u00e1ngli, and other neighbouring states. Still, as most landholders had reaped some small harvest and did not seek relief until their stock of grain was finished, the pressure on the works was not great, the daily number of labourers rising from 1000 in the beginning of the month to 11,414 at the close. Of 4371, the average daily number for the month, 4056 were able-bodied, expected to do a full day's work and superintended by public works officers, and 315 were aged or feeble, expected to do less than a full\nday's work and superintended by civil officers. Early in the month meetings were held at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and T\u00e1sgaon, and relief committees were formed. On the 9th \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000), out of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's grant of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), were placed at the Collector's disposal to be spent on alms. About the end of the month cholera made its appearance. December passed without rain and with no change in crop prospects. Grain importations continued, and the rupee prices fell for jv\u00e1ri from eighteen pounds at the beginning of the month to 20\u00bd pounds about the close, and for b\u00e1jri from seventeen to 19\u00bd pounds. The scarcity of fodder was increasing, and people were moving with their cattle to the Konkan. A mild form of cholera continued prevalent. The numbers of the destitute increased on public works from 4056 to 13,371, and on civil works from 315 to 2703.\n\nIn January 1877 no rain fell. Grain importations continued and the supply was sufficient. Jv\u00e1ri remained steady at twenty pounds the rupee, and b\u00e1jri fell from 19\u00bd to twenty pounds. Small-pox broke out among the labourers at the Nher lake. Otherwise public health was good, except at T\u00e1sgaon, where, about the middle of the month, there was slight cholera. The numbers on relief increased, on public works from 13,371 to 15,639, and on civil works from 2703 to 3289. About the middle of February rain fell in the western sub-divisions of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra P\u00e1tan and J\u00e1vli. The grain supply continued sufficient. The rupee price of b\u00e1jri rose from twenty to 18\u00bd pounds and jv\u00e1ri continued steady at twenty pounds. Cholera was prevalent and was increasing. The numbers on public works rose from 15,639 to 23,728; on civil works, in consequence of a reduction in pay in the civil works and of the transfer of workmen to public works, they fell from 3289 to 178. During the month twenty-four persons were on charitable relief. Early in March rain fell over most of the district. The grain supply continued sufficient, the rupee price of jv\u00e1ri rising from twenty to 18\u00bd pounds, and that of b\u00e1jri falling from 18\u00bd to nineteen. Emigration to Bombay and the Konkan continued. Cholera was prevalent and increasing. The numbers on relief rose, on public works from 23,728 to 26,539, on civil works from 178 to 239, and on charitable relief from twenty-four to 197. During April some good showers, especially in the south and south-east, improved the scanty water supply. The rupee price of both jv\u00e1ri and b\u00e1jri rose from nineteen pounds at the beginning of the month to seventeen pounds about the close. The hill villages of Kar\u00e1d and P\u00e1tan suffered severely, the people living chiefly on wild fruits and roots. The number of the destitute rose on public\n\n---\n\n1 The original day's wages were, for a man 3d. (2 as.), for a woman 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bd as.), and for a boy or girl 1\u00bdd. (1 a.). About the middle of November a sliding scale was introduced, providing that when prices rose over sixteen pounds the rupee, the money rate should vary with the price of grain, and that a man should always receive the price of one pound of grain in addition to one anna.\n\n2 The new rates were, for a man the price of one pound of grain and \u00bed. (\u00bc a.) instead of 1\u00bdd. (1 a.); for a woman the price of one pound and \u00bed. (\u00bc a.) instead of \u00bed. (\u00bd a.); and for a boy or girl the price of half a pound of grain and \u00bed. (\u00bc a.).\nworks from 26,539 to 32,122, on civil works from 239 to 514, and on charitable relief from 197 to 645. The mortality from cholera continued heavy. Late in May good rain fell in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, J\u00e1vli, W\u00e1i, and V\u00e1lva, and showers in M\u00e1n and T\u00e1sgaon. Emigrants were slowly returning. Among the hill people in the Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 petty division of W\u00e1i there was great distress, but many had left their homes and found employment on the Nira canal in the Poona district. In Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, the Mh\u00e1rs and R\u00e1moshis were in great want, and grain was distributed to them at their homes.\u00b9\n\nThe supply of grain continued sufficient, but rupee prices rose, for jv\u00e1ri from seventeen to $15\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds and for b\u00e1jri from seventeen to $16\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds. The scarcity of fodder was pressing hard, and the mortality among cattle was increasing. For the benefit of the infirm poor ten additional relief houses were established. Cholera continued prevalent and the mortality was heavy. The numbers of the destitute considerably increased, on public works from 32,122 to 42,731, on civil works from 514 to 1564, and on charitable relief from 645 to 1833. About the second week in June the eastern storms began. In T\u00e1sgaon on two consecutive days about six inches fell in torrents. At V\u00e1lva and other places the western rains had steadily set in by the 22nd of June. During the month an average of 10\u00b781 inches fell. Emigrants were coming back, and about the middle of the month large numbers began leaving the relief works to return to their fields. The sowing of the early crops was begun and was rapidly progressing, and in places the young crops had begun to show.\n\nThe supply of grain continued good, but rupee prices for b\u00e1jri and jv\u00e1ri rose from $15\\frac{1}{2}$ and fifteen pounds at the beginning of the month to fourteen pounds towards the close. The people largely supplemented their food with green vegetables, which had now become plentiful, and in V\u00e1lva mango, jack, and other fruits could be had in abundance. In P\u00e1tan and V\u00e1lva, the young grass was high enough to afford grazing for cattle and was finding its way to the markets. The numbers on relief fell, on public works from 47,849 at the beginning of the month to 41,046 about the close, and on civil works from 2560 to 1400.\u00b2 The mortality from cholera continued heavy. During July there was a fair rainfall in the west, but only a few light showers in the east. Crop prospects continued good, but in places more rain was badly wanted. Emigrants were still returning. Cart-rates from T\u00e1sgaon to Poona and back rose from ordinary rates of \u00a31 12s. to \u00a33 10s. (Rs.16-35), and grain traffic in carts from Chiplun was stopped. This, joined to the break in the monsoon, raised grain prices, for jv\u00e1ri from fourteen to $10\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds and for b\u00e1jri from $14\\frac{1}{2}$ to $11\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds the rupee; on the 22nd, at T\u00e1sgaon, grain was sold at seven pounds the rupee. These high prices caused less distress than might have been expected, as vegetables could be had in abundance and were\n\n\u00b9 In June the Collector put a stop to this mode of relief, as it was opposed to the spirit of Government orders.\n\u00b2 For June the average daily number of the destitute was, on public works 46,317, on civil works 2214, and on charitable relief 3768.\nfreely eaten, but, partly from the want of salt, caused much disease, especially dysentery. Green grass was coming to market and fodder was much cheaper. The mortality from cholera continued heavy. The numbers on relief fell, on public works from 46,317 to 28,632, on civil works from 2214 to 806, and on charitable relief from 3768 to 3051. In August there was an average fall of 7\u00b737 inches. Except *udid*, *mug*, and *r\u00e1la*, which in parts were much damaged by the scanty fall of the previous month, the crops were generally in good order but in the east required more rain. The supply of grain continued fair. Rupee prices both for *b\u00e1jri* and *jv\u00e1ri* remained steady at eleven pounds. Cholera continued prevalent but was decreasing. The numbers on relief works fell considerably, on public works from 28,632 to 19,517, and on civil works from 806 to 524; on charitable relief they rose from 3051 to 5345. In September there was a good and heavy fall of rain, averaging 10\u00b753 inches. Except in parts of M\u00e1n, W\u00e1i, and J\u00e1vli the crops were everywhere good. In Kar\u00e1d in some places the maize, *vari*, *s\u00e1va*, and *r\u00e1la* were harvested and grain was coming to market. Cart traffic to Chiplun, which had been stopped, was again opened. Rupee prices fell, for *b\u00e1jri* from twelve pounds at the beginning of the month to nineteen pounds about the close, and for *jv\u00e1ri* from 11\u00bd to 17\u00bd pounds. The condition of the people considerably improved. Cholera continued to decrease. The numbers on relief fell, on public works from 19,517 to 16,601 and on civil works from 524 to 494; on charitable relief they rose from 5345 to 10,342. In October an average of 6\u00b791 inches of rain fell. The sowing of the cold-weather crops was in progress, but it was kept back by the heavy rain, which also in some places injured the ripe early crops. Grain prices fell, for *jv\u00e1ri* from nineteen pounds at the beginning of the month to twenty pounds about the close, and for *b\u00e1jri* from 21\u00bd to twenty-four pounds. The numbers on relief fell, on public works from 16,601 to 9718, on civil works from 494 to 113, and on charitable relief from 10,342 to 7113. Early in the month (6th) all civil agency works were closed. A mild type of cholera continued prevalent. In November there were a few showers in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, V\u00e1lva, and T\u00e1sgaon. The harvesting of the early crops was nearly finished and *rabi* sowing was almost complete. During the month grain prices averaged 23\u00bd pounds for *jv\u00e1ri* and for *b\u00e1jri* 29\u00bd pounds the rupee. The numbers on public works fell from 2755 about the beginning of the month to 469 at the end, when the works were closed. The numbers on charitable relief fell from 1073 at the beginning of the month to 134 on the 24th. In the last week no one was charitably relieved. In December a few showers greatly benefited the cold-weather crops. Grain continued to grow cheaper, *jv\u00e1ri* falling to thirty-one and *b\u00e1jri* to thirty-two pounds. No one took advantage of the Government offer of charitable relief.\n\nThe following statement of millet prices and numbers receiving relief shows that during the first three months of 1877 grain kept pretty steady at nineteen pounds the rupee, or nearly twice the ordinary rates; that its price rose rapidly in April May June and July, till it reached 11\u00bd pounds in August, and that it then quickly\nfell to 29\u00bd pounds in November. As early as December 1876, the numbers on relief works reached 16,074. From that they rose steadily to 48,531 in June, and then falling to 29,438 in July owing to the large demand for field labour, continued to decrease till November, when the works were closed. The numbers on charitable relief rose steadily from 24 in February to 3768 in June. They then fell to 3051 in July, and, after rising to 10,342 in September, fell to 328 in November:\n\n| Month     | On Relief Works | On Gratuitous Relief | Average Prices | Rainfall |\n|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------|\n|           | Civil Agency    | Public Works         | Total          | Bajri   | Ju\u00e1ri   |\n| 1876      |                 |                      |                |         |         |\n| November  | 315             | 4056                 | 4371           | 16\u00bd     | 17\u00bd     | .07     |\n| December  | 2703            | 13,371               | 16,074         | 18\u00bd     | 19\u00bd     |         |\n| 1877      |                 |                      |                |         |         |\n| January   | 3289            | 15,639               | 18,928         | 19\u00bd     | 20      | 28      |\n| February  | 173             | 23,728               | 28,906         | 24      | 20      | 28      |\n| March     | 239             | 26,539               | 28,778         | 19\u00bd     | 19      | .04     |\n| April     | 514             | 32,132               | 32,636         | 19\u00bd     | 19      | 37      |\n| May       | 164             | 42,571               | 43,235         | 19\u00bd     | 19      | 37      |\n| June      | 2214            | 46,317               | 48,531         | 18\u00bd     | 14      | 10-31   |\n| July      | 806             | 28,632               | 29,438         | 12\u00bd     | 12      | 5-89    |\n| August    | 524             | 19,517               | 20,041         | 11\u00bd     | 11      | 7-37    |\n| September | 494             | 16,601               | 17,095         | 14      | 14      | 10-53   |\n| October   | 113             | 9718                 | 9831           | 23      | 19      | 6-91    |\n| November  |                 | 1128                 | 1128           | 28\u00bd     | 28      | 73      |\n| Total     | 12,965          | 280,099              | 293,052        | 32,646  |         | 43-72   |\n| Average   | 1079            | 21,646               | 22,642         | 3264    |         |         |\n| Total Cost Rs. | ... | ... | 10,75,281 | 106,061 | 1,811,372 |\n\nA special census taken on the 19th of May 1877, when famine pressure was general and severe, showed that of 46,235 labourers, 44,344 on public and 1891 on civil works, 18,316 belonged to the sub-divisions where the works were carried on; 13,998 belonged to different sub-divisions of the same district; 6702 were from other districts; and 7219 from neighbouring states. As regards their occupation, 3062 were manufacturers or craftsmen, 24,611 were holders or under-holders of land, and 18,562 were labourers.\n\nThe total cost of the famine was estimated at \u00a3118,137 4s. (Rs.11,81,372) of which \u00a3107,528 2s. (Rs. 10,75,281) were spent on public and civil works, and \u00a310,609 2s. (Rs. 1,06,091) on charitable relief.\n\nOf twenty relief-houses or camps opened in the district between November 1876 and November 1877, five were on the irrigation works at the Pingli, Nher, Islampur, and Mhasvad reservoirs and on the Krishna canal extension. Of the twenty relief-houses, one was started in November 1876 and the rest during 1877, three in February, one in March, ten in May, four in June, and one in September. Except at the Pingli, Nher, Islampur, and Mhasvad reservoirs where small huts were raised at Government expense, the buildings used for the relief houses were generally dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s or\nrest-houses, ch\u0101vdis or village offices, and temples. The following are the dates at which the twenty relief houses were opened and closed: the relief-house at T\u00e1sgaon was opened on the 16th of November 1876 and was closed on the 1st of November 1877; at a cost of \u00a31623 14s. (Rs. 16,237) it relieved a monthly average of ninety-four men, sixty women, and eighty children. The relief-house at Pingli reservoir in M\u00e1n was opened in February 1877 and closed on the 31st of October; at a cost of \u00a32881 4s. (Rs. 28,812) it relieved 358,760 persons in all or a monthly average of 39,862. The relief-house at the Nher reservoir in Khat\u00e1v was opened in February 1877 and closed on the 23rd of October; at a cost of \u00a3599 4s. (Rs. 5992) it relieved 95,138 persons in all or a monthly average of 10,571. The relief-house at the Isl\u00e1mpur reservoir in V\u00e1lva was opened in February 1877 and closed on the 30th of September; at a cost of \u00a3159 2s.

The relief-house at W\u00e1i was opened on the 30th of May 1877 and closed on the 1st of July; at a total cost of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) it relieved a monthly average of 463 men, 718 women, and 1218 children. The relief-house at Helv\u00e1k in P\u00e1tan was opened on the 1st of June 1877 and was\nclosed on the 16th of the same month; at a cost of \u00a35 18s. (Rs. 59) it relieved a monthly average of forty-two men, thirty-one women, and five children. The relief-house at Vaduj in Khatav was opened on the 11th of June 1877 and closed on the 11th of November; at a cost of \u00a3243 6s. (Rs. 2433) it relieved a monthly average of 363 men, 504 women, and 752 children. The relief-house at M\u00e1yni in Khatav was opened on the 18th of June 1877 and closed on the 25th of June; at a cost of \u00a37 16s. (Rs. 78) it relieved 1057 persons or a monthly average of 204 men, 615 women, and 238 children. The relief-house at the Krishna canal extension was opened in June 1877 and closed on the 30th of September; at a cost of \u00a34 18s. (Rs. 49) it relieved 595 persons or a monthly average of 148. The relief-house at Kar\u00e1d was opened on the 7th of September 1877 and closed on the 7th of November; at a cost of \u00a326 14s. (Rs. 267) it relieved a monthly average of 297 men, 584 women, and 707 children. Besides the cost on these relief-houses, Government spent about \u00a32386 (Rs. 23,860) in village charity.\n\nTo superintend relief works four m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were employed to the end of October 1877, one in M\u00e1n from the 10th of January 1877, one in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur from the 17th of January, one in T\u00e1sgaon from the 31st of January, and one in Khatav from the 14th of May. Besides these four m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs, during the various periods of the famine, the relief staff included five European officers, Mr. East the first assistant collector, Mr. Muir-Mackenzie an assistant collector, Major Bartholomew the district police superintendent, Mr. Mainwaring the district forest officer, and Mr. Adams an assistant superintendent in the Ratn\u00e1giri revenue survey. In addition to these relief officers, sixty circle inspectors were employed on village inspection in 1877 from the 10th of May to the 30th of June. Large relief camps on the works at the Pingli, Nher, Isl\u00e1mpur, and Mhasvad reservoirs, and the Krishna canal extension were superintended by a staff of public works officers.\n\nSome municipalities sold grain at fixed rates to the poor, a mode of charity which was much appreciated. It is a part of outdoor relief, and if well supervised has no effect on trade or on prices. The abuses to be guarded against are simply those which are always present when either grain or money are distributed without a test of alleged poverty. Grain sold at or below cost price meets the case of those who are not paupers, are much straitened, but yet so long as they can earn anything in their usual way or have any means left will not go to work. For the same reason loans of grain to respectable people willing to maintain their dependents are safe and are valuable. During the fair season grain came in large quantities into S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from Bombay by sea to Chiplun and from Chiplun to Kar\u00e1d by the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road; during the rains it chiefly came by rail to Poona, and from Poona in carts to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra along the Poona-Belgaum road. In the east grain also came by rail to Shol\u00e1pur, and from Shol\u00e1pur in carts to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nA great number of people from the M\u00e1n, Khatav, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and T\u00e1sgaon sub-divisions left the district in the early days of distress. Some of them went north and north-east to Bombay, Ber\u00e1r, and\nKh\u00e1ndesh, and others went south-west to the Konkan. The people who left the district were those in charge of cattle who usually had some means, and field labourers and small landholders who had no stock of grain and no credit. Of these three classes the labourers were the most numerous. The small landholders took with them their pair of bullocks and a cow or two, and left nothing behind but an empty house and a barricaded door. Some of them went to the Konkan and the rest to the Ber\u00e1rs. Many, especially of those who went to the Ber\u00e1rs, are believed to have found openings and settled. Of the labouring classes the better-off left first and found work in distant parts; others went to the public works and remained there pretty steadily; others wandered to the Sahy\u00e1dris whence later on they wandered back in much distress; and others, especially the women, hung about the villages living on next to nothing and dying in thousands on the first fall of rain.\n\nThe chief difficulties in dealing with the famine were the obstinacy of some who would not leave their villages for the works and the vagrancy of others who persisted in wandering instead of working. These difficulties were met by careful village inspection and gentle pressure in the case of the stay-at-homes, and by watchful supervision by officers of all grades in the case of the vagrants.\n\nIn the eastern sub-divisions, according to the agricultural returns, the number of cattle fell from 994,272 in 1876-77 to 775,393 in 1877-78, that is a loss of 218,879. In 1877-78 the actual number of offences reported was 5912 against 4064 in 1876-77. Serious crime, such as murder, dacoity, and robbery seems to have been more prevalent, and the number of thefts was considerably more than double what it was in 1876-77. In 1878 the tillage area fell short of that in 1876 by about 18,400 acres. Of about \u00a3155,740 (Rs. 15,57,400), the realizable land revenue for the year 1876-77, \u00a3130,267 (Rs. 13,02,670) were collected in 1876-77, \u00a3582 (Rs. 5820) remitted, and the rest was collected in subsequent years.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nUnder the head capitalists and traders, the 1878 Licence Tax papers showed 19,823 persons assessed on yearly incomes of more than \u00a310. Of these 9887 had from \u00a310 to \u00a315 (Rs. 100-Rs. 150), 4033 from \u00a315 to \u00a325 (Rs. 150-Rs. 250), 2316 from \u00a325 to \u00a335 (Rs. 250 - Rs. 350), 1051 from \u00a335 to \u00a350 (Rs. 350 - Rs. 500), 958 from \u00a350 to \u00a375 (Rs. 500-Rs. 750), 560 from \u00a375 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 750-Rs. 1000), 327 from \u00a3100 to \u00a3125 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 1250), 151 from \u00a3125 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1250-Rs. 1500), 176 from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1500-Rs. 2000), 121 from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 2000 - Rs. 3000), 105 from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 (Rs. 3000 - Rs. 4000), 46 from \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 4000-Rs. 5000), 49 from \u00a3500 to \u00a3750 (Rs. 5000-Rs. 7500), 19 from \u00a3750 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 7500-Rs. 10,000), and 24 over \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000).\n\nSince 1879, incomes under \u00a350 (Rs. 500) have been exempted from the License Tax. In 1881-82, of 2661 assessed on yearly incomes of \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and more, 1149 had from \u00a350 to \u00a375 (Rs. 500-Rs. 750), 456 from \u00a375 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 750-Rs. 1000), 343 from \u00a3100 to \u00a3125 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 1250), 161 from \u00a3125 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1250-Rs. 1500), 167 from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1500 - Rs. 2000), 154 from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 2000-Rs. 3000), 91 from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 (Rs. 3000-Rs. 4000), 51 from \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 4000 - Rs. 5000), 48 from \u00a3500 to \u00a3750 (Rs. 5000-Rs. 7500), 15 from \u00a3750 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 7500-Rs. 10,000), and 26 from \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) and upwards.\n\nThere are no regular bankers in the district. Deposits used to be made with certain bankers or s\u00e1vk\u00e1rs of high reputation, who are said to have given interest up to three per cent a year.\n\nBills of exchange and letters of credit or bhal\u00e1vanpatras are of two kinds payable at sight or darshani and payable after a fixed period or mudatichi. The discount charged on an exchange bill or hundi not payable at sight varies from one to two per cent a month. Hundis of long periods are drawn almost solely in mercantile transactions by the consignor on the consignee, the period varying with the time calculated for the clearance of the stock by the consignee. Bombay hundis are generally issued at eleven days' sight and at a discount of one-half to three-quarters per cent. The largest bills cashed in the district vary from \u00a3300 to \u00a3700 (Rs. 3000 - Rs. 7000). The few firms which cash these bills have capitals of over \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000).\n\n1 Contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\nThe only coins in common circulation are the Imperial rupee and parts of the rupee. Formerly both the ch\u00e1ndor rupee valued at 92\u00b76 per cent and the ankushi valued at ninety-seven per cent of the Imperial rupee were in circulation. They still often appear in rural hoards and in the hands of moneylenders.\n\nScarcely any class can be termed the reverse of frugal. It may be said that twenty to thirty per cent of all classes are fairly endowed with a desire to save. Of the remainder the larger portion of landholders spend beyond their means, while the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis and trading Br\u00e1hmans almost to a man put by money every year. Few of any class can be said to accumulate wealth. Almost all savings are squandered over family and religious celebrations. It is said that the larger bankers or s\u00e1vk\u00e1rs and the higher grades of Government native officials, after deducting all ordinary and extraordinary expenses, save about one-third of their net profits and emoluments.\n\nThe district has few large trading firms. The leading firms are almost entirely for the export of field produce or the local sale of grain. Few, except the higher native officials, invest their savings in joint stock companies, Government securities, or state Savings Bank. At the same time the amounts invested in Government securities and Savings Banks show a steady increase. In 1870-71 the Savings Bank deposits amounted to \u00a32016 (Rs. 20,160), in 1875-76 to \u00a33595 (Rs. 35,950), and in 1882-83 to \u00a36628 (Rs. 66,280). In 1870-71 the interest paid to holders of Government securities amounted to \u00a3135 (Rs. 1350), in 1875-76 to \u00a3133 (Rs. 1330), and in 1882-83 to \u00a3281 (Rs. 2810). Traders use their increased capital to extend their business. They seldom start any new form of investment.\n\nNo great amount of capital is invested in house property. As a trader saves, he attempts to secure for his shop a better position and more warehousing room. Houses are rarely bought with a view to securing a return from tenants. This form of investment is confined to the few P\u00e1rsis and Bohor\u00e1s who own the bungalows rented by the Europeans at the head-quarters station. Occasionally a wealthy person enlarges or adorns his house for purposes of comfort or display and the possession of a mansion or v\u00e1da is reckoned a mark of wealth and importance. Considerable holders of Government or private land especially seem to consider it a point of honour to have a large house in every village in which they own land whether they live there or not.\n\nLand is perhaps the favourite investment with all classes possessed of a substantial surplus, the exclusively trading classes alone excepted. Even among traders all who are natives of the district are glad to own land. But they will wait till good land is available before investing in it, and will sink in it only surplus profits not diverting any portion of their capital from their trade. The social status conferred by the possession of land has often much to do with the investment, though when watered land, especially sugar-cane land, can be had on favourable terms by squeezing a debtor the produce is looked to. The difficulty under which the trader lies\nis that he always has to sublet, and is almost certain to be cheated by his tenant. When the tenant is a debtor the trader cheats him back and in the end matters square themselves to the trader's advantage. Professional classes have a marked fondness for land investment. Few successful pleaders, Government servants, or even priests, religious mendicants, and the like will be found who do not own some land. The fondness for land investment has undoubtedly increased under British rule. The causes are the increased price of field produce, the diminution of risk from plunder and war, the decline of other investments as in native industries and in advances to chiefs for the support of their retinues and armies, the reduction in the share of the produce taken by the state, and above all the stability of tenure. Before the introduction of British rule it was with great difficulty that a stranger could acquire the advantages of the mir\u00e1s tenure. Now every one can have it, and it is this which induces the professional classes to invest their profits in land. The state demand is certainly reduced. Wherever the state demand was really fixed as in the kam\u00e1l or fully assessed lands the rate undoubtedly was enormously higher than that now exacted, so high that it seldom could be levied in full. There were lands outside of the kam\u00e1l. But these were appropriated by the privileged few to whom the village officers or rent farmers chose to give them. The nominal rate on all land was also subject to numberless enhancements and exactions, by every grade of official from the Government itself down to the village headman. No materials are available from which to frame an accurate estimate of the present sale value of land. In some cases an acre of garden land is said to have fetched as much as \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) and dry-crop land as much as \u00a330 (Rs. 300). The actual price is rarely made public. Landholders hardly ever part with their land except under the pressure of debt. Of late years the moneylending classes have shown a great and a growing desire to take possession of their debtors' lands and secure for themselves the large margin of profit between the Government rental and the actual produce of the land. It is roughly estimated that, though it is not entered in their names in the Government books, about one-third of the arable land has virtually passed into moneylenders' hands. It is doubtful how far this transfer of land has gone, but it is beyond doubt that more land passes in this than in any other way. For some years before the 1876 famine nearly the whole arable area of the district was held for tillage. During and after the famine a considerable area of arable land was thrown up. Most of it has again been taken either by Government for forests or by landholders for tillage.\n\nOrnaments are a universal form of investment. Their security, the ease with which money can be raised on them, and the slight loss with which they can be turned to cash, make ornaments the favourite investment of the poor and middle classes.\n\nThe old form of hoarding by burying cash in an earthen pot or building it into a wall, though less common than in the old unsafe times, continues to an unknown but probably to a large extent. A\nman, who as one of the destitute received relief during the 1876 famine, shortly after the close of the famine charged his wife with digging up and purloining his hoard of several hundred rupees.\\(^1\\)\n\nOf all forms of investment moneylending is the commonest. Moneylending is practised in different degrees by members of almost every class. Sut\u00e1rs and Loh\u00e1rs, even Mh\u00e1rs, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, and Vaddars lend money. Perhaps Shimpis and K\u00e1s\u00e1rs are the two castes which have the largest proportion of unprofessional moneylenders. The leading professional moneylenders are Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, Jains, Ling\u00e1yats, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Few live solely by moneylending. The Br\u00e1hmans are husbandmen, land proprietors, traders, and, to a small extent, pensioned Government servants and pleaders. A few of them have large capital and combine moneylending with trade as their chief calling. In Kar\u00e1d some Br\u00e1hman families are hereditary moneylenders, and draw their profits from moneylending alone. Gujar\u00e1t, Ling\u00e1yat, and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1n\u00ed moneylenders are mostly traders and in some cases landholders. They deal in cloth, groceries, and grain, and have shops both in villages and towns. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis deal chiefly in clarified butter and oil. The Mar\u00e1tha and Kunbi moneylenders are almost all landholders and seldom extend their dealings beyond their villages. A very small portion of them draw part of their income from trade. Some Musalm\u00e1n moneylenders are village shopkeepers.\n\nOf all moneylenders the M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1n\u00ed has the worst name and is harshest and most unscrupulous in his dealings with his debtor. As a rule M\u00e1rv\u00e1r V\u00e1n\u00ed are not permanently settled in the district. Most of them keep up relations with their native country, and withdraw to their native village when they grow old or when they have laid by enough to rest on. A new comer from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r generally begins by serving as the gum\u00e1sta or agent of one of his countrymen. When he has saved enough from his wages to set up business for himself he opens a new shop in his own name, or he enters into partnership with other M\u00e1rv\u00e1ri traders, or if his capital is very small, he trades for a time as a peddler. For trading purposes M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris generally combine to form a firm of two or three and seldom of more than five partners. They have great confidence in each other\u2019s honesty. A M\u00e1rv\u00e1ri often lives in his own country and carries on business at a distance through agents or partners. Few cases occur in which a M\u00e1rv\u00e1ri, however unscrupulous in his dealings with other men, is false to his employer or partner. Next to M\u00e1rv\u00e1ri moneylenders come Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis and local Br\u00e1hmans. Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00ed called Gujars are generally settled in the district, and very few retire to their native country even after accumulating large sums of money. Though they generally charge the same rates of interest as M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris, the Gujars are less unscrupulous and harsh than the M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris in enforcing payment of debts. Among local Br\u00e1hman moneylenders of the Deshasth, Golak, Karh\u00e1da, Kokanasth, and Tirgul subdivisions, the Deshasths and Golaks are the leading moneylenders. The remaining classes Jains, Ling\u00e1-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. A. Shewan, C.S.\nyats, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Musalm\u00e1ns are much kindlier creditors and seldom ruin their debtors. Except M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, the larger moneylenders and landholders to a certain extent from a regard to their good name and from kindly feeling treat their debtors with a certain amount of leniency. A notable exception to this is where a cultivator sees a chance of profitably adding to his own land by pressing a debtor. Few creditors are then harder or more unscrupulous. The smaller lenders cannot afford much kindness and treat their debtors with considerable strictness.\n\nProfessional moneylenders may be roughly arranged under three chief classes large, middle, and small. The first or the substantial banker or s\u00e1vk\u00e1r carries on a considerable business in bills or hundis and is careful to make advances only to persons of substance and on good security. The large landholders are often hopelessly in debt to large moneylenders. The lenders are generally careful to keep their debtors' heads just above water, in some cases from good feeling, but in most because the process is more profitable than foreclosure. Most of the bankers' dealings are with other moneylenders. In days of better credit they are said to have had larger direct dealings with non-moneylending classes. They relied for punctual payment on the justice of their claims and the honesty of their debtors. Such pressure as was required was applied by private bailiffs who sat dharna or fasting at the door of the debtor, and compelled payment through the terrors of religion, by annoyance, and sometimes by force. Since the introduction of civil courts these processes have ceased. Lenders of this class often remit part of a claim rather than face the odium and expense of a civil suit. They are the better able to forego part of their claims because their debtors are generally well enough off to pay a large percentage of the debt. This class of lenders advance large sums on mortgage to the holders of rent-free or quit-rent land, especially to district and village hereditary officers. Many of these families owe debts several generations old, the lender resting content with periodical payments. Few of the better class of these borrowers have complained till of late the law preventing the alienation of hereditary service lands without the sanction of Government has been rigidly enforced. First class lending and trading firms keep the journal or kird, the ledger or khat\u00favni and four bill books, an advice book of bills drawn by the firm, a register of the firm's acceptances in favour of third parties, a register of bills in favour of the firm, and a rough memorandum book.\n\nThe second or middle class of lenders form the greater portion of the most respectable lenders of the present day. They are those who with no great capital lend money in smaller sums and at higher rates than the first class but still carefully and on good security and who are glad to avoid the courts. This class in most cases keep the day book and ledger and have a capital of \u00a31000 to \u00a33000 (Rs. 10,000 - Rs. 30,000).\n\nThe third class of small lenders have little or no capital. They borrow from wealthy firms and lend small sums to poor borrowers at extremely high rates. Lenders of this class keep the most meagre\naccounts. Their transactions are on mortgage, personal security, and pawn. All of their agreements are on the hardest terms as the security is generally doubtful and debtor and creditor are little removed from one another in neediness and dishonesty. The best of this class keep at least the accounts termed pathani or tipane or rough memorandum book and khat\u0101vni or ledger. When they intend to show their accounts in court they make their debtors sign each entry to avoid disputes. This seldom occurs as the accounts are too unsystematic and untrustworthy to be used in judicial inquiries. The lowest lenders of this class and the host of unprofessional lenders keep no record of their transactions except the bonds which are employed on almost every occasion. The debtor is rarely furnished with a receipt. The refusal to give receipts has been made penal. But the lender easily evades the law as he is rarely tendered more than part payment. If the debtor demands a receipt, the lender declines to take anything short of the whole amount due and threatens if the debtor presses for a receipt to take legal proceedings to enforce the whole debt. Thus the debtor is forced either to go without his receipt or to renew his bond on ruinous terms. In private or part private villages it frequently happens that the proprietor or in\u0101md\u0101r manages the moneylending of the village and has all his tenants in his hands. In Government villages one or other of the village officers sometimes holds a similar position, the headman on a large and the accountant on a small scale. Village office-bearers, as a rule, exact nearly as hard terms as professional lenders. They differ from professional lenders in much more rarely taking their debtors into court.\n\nIn fixing the terms of a loan every circumstance in the case has its weight. The urgency of the occasion and the condition and credit of the borrower make a vast difference on the rates charged. Two successive loans from the same capitalist often vary largely in their terms. Attempts to fix rates of interest for the different classes of loans are therefore necessarily little more than rough estimates. According to the returns received, on easily convertible movable property and on good landed security large sums may be borrowed at six to twelve per cent a year. For smaller sums and in ordinary pawn transactions the rate ranges to eighteen per cent. In transactions on personal security a well-to-do borrower may raise a loan as cheaply as nine per cent. On the other hand hardly any limit can be set to what a destitute borrower may have to pay. On unsecured debts a husbandman of scanty credit has generally to pay twenty-four to $37\\frac{1}{2}$ or even forty per cent. The rates of interest paid by husbandmen of good or fair credit are now (1883) the same as they were before the famine of 1876-77. Twenty years ago lenders used to deduct from the sums mentioned in the bonds two to five per cent as manoti or premium, or as nazr\u0101na that is gift. This practice has almost ceased though in some cases it may secretly continue. Cases of the entry of nominal rates of interest in bonds are rare. When they do occur they are little more than provisions to guard the lender against the borrower's failure to act up to\nthe terms of the agreement.\\(^1\\) Mortgages are sometimes charged more heavily than personal bonds. If the borrower can be easily duped or if there is any suspicion of other debts, he will not only be charged a ruinous rate of interest but will be made to mortgage his crops instead of interest and to promise possession to the mortgagee on the first failure of an instalment. At the same time the mortgagor continues to be responsible for the Government assessment and to pay it will have to borrow still further. It is usual to set off interest against the profits of the mortgaged property.\n\nStipendiary Government servants as a class are not large borrowers, still some, mostly of the lower grades, are deep in debt, often of ancestral obligation. District and village hereditary officers are nearly always in debt. In many cases most of their land has been mortgaged for two or three generations. Debt rarely forces village headmen and village clerks to resign their offices. Under former rulers few held office except moneyed men; if a man fell into difficulties some rich member of the family generally took his place. Under the British the hereditary right has been strictly respected. But it is only when it is notorious, that a man's indigence is brought to light and his dismissal enforced. The bulk of the local traders are poor, and have to borrow to renew their stock. Traders whose dealings are on a large scale are almost always also large moneylenders. The stock of a small V\u00e2ni or village shopkeeper amounts to \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and upwards. The terms on which a man of this class raises money to renew his stock are generally strict and the rates of interest high. Middle-class traders renew their stock by pawning ornaments as security and paying ten to eighteen per cent interest a year. As the ornaments are redeemed when the stock is disposed of, the same ornaments may be pledged again and again, any profit being invested in the purchase of more jewels. The stock is not often pledged in advance. When a trader pawns no movable property the money is generally lent on his personal security. The craftsmen of the district are not prosperous. They seldom have capital enough to buy the new material in which they work. Either the person who gives the job supplies the material, or money is borrowed to buy the material, or the material is obtained from the trader at high credit rates. In borrowing to meet marriage and other family expenses craftsmen have generally nothing but personal security to offer and have frequently to pay twenty to thirty per cent or even higher. The country mechanic is frequently an hereditary village servant and lives on dues in land or in kind which are paid him for doing the rough work required by householders and husbandmen who supply the materials. He generally owns land which he tills himself and he differs little in position from a cultivator. Masters generally advance their servants money on easy terms, often free of interest stopping part of their wages for payment. If a master fails to help him a servant has generally resort to the worst class of lenders.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) To illustrate the extent to which the *manoti* that is the premium or bonus system formerly prevailed, Mr. Gul\u00e1b\u00e1s, the sub-judge of Vita, cites a case in which a bond executed in 1859 acknowledged the receipt of \u00a312 (Rs. 120) though only \u00a36 (Rs. 60) were actually paid.\nOf all borrowers, except the labouring classes, husbandmen are the worst off. Husbandmen may be roughly divided into four classes, ten per cent with good credit, twenty-five with fair credit, forty with scanty credit, and twenty-five with little or no credit. The ten per cent of first class husbandmen are well off, and except occasionally to meet extraordinary expenses of marriages and land improvement, they are generally in no want of money. They have good credit, and can borrow up to \u00a350 (Rs. 500) on personal security. To raise loans of more than \u00a350 (Rs. 500) they require to mortgage land, houses, or other immovable property, and the sums lent on mortgage are about three-quarters of the value of the mortgaged property. First class husbandmen also occasionally lend small sums to the poorer husbandmen of their own village.\n\nThe twenty-five per cent of second class husbandmen are fairly off. They are generally in need of no loans either for food or seed, but they often borrow to pay the Government assessment and to meet the extraordinary expenses of marriages and other family events. They have fair credit, and can borrow up to \u00a310 (Rs. 100) on personal security. To raise loans of more than \u00a310 (Rs. 100), they require to mortgage land or houses, and the sums lent on mortgage are one-half to three-quarters of the value of the mortgaged property.\n\nThe forty per cent of third class husbandmen are well off for a few months after harvest. During the rest of the year their condition is indifferent, and they have to borrow for food as well as to pay the Government assessment and to meet the extraordinary expenses of marriages and other family events. In poor seasons their condition is generally miserable. Their credit is scanty, and they cannot raise cash loans without mortgaging land, houses, or cattle. On personal security grain advances are made for food and seed on condition that the advance is paid back at harvest time with an addition or v\u0101dha of one-fourth to one-half of the quantity advanced.\n\nThe twenty-five per cent of the fourth class are badly off during the greater part of the year. Besides tilling small plots of land they work as field labourers. They have generally little or no credit, and live from hand to mouth. As a rule husbandmen do not raise loans in cash to buy seed for sowing. As the quantity of seed required is comparatively small, the first three classes or seventy-five per cent of husbandmen generally hold enough seed to sow the early or kharif crop. Husbandmen sometimes need seed to sow the cold weather or rabi crops, and for this they borrow seed in advance on condition that the advance is paid back at harvest time together with one-fourth to one-half of the quantity advanced.\n\nEspecially in outlying villages few moneylenders do not also lend grain. Most villages have a shopkeeper who combines money-lending with dealing in cloth and grain, as well as in spices, condiments, sugar, and other edible comforts. Of the purchases of spices and other condiments a credit account is kept which is settled not oftener than once or twice a year. From time to time bonds are passed for the amount supposed to be owing, which is often enormously in excess of the amount really due. The customer keeps no account and the shopkeeper takes a corresponding advantage. This arrangement between shopkeepers and customers is less\ncommon in towns than in the rural parts. The system on which grain is usually advanced is known as the *v\u0101dhi-didhi* that is the one and a half increase. Grain advances last only from the beginning of the south-west rains in June to the early harvest in October or November. Formerly bonds were not taken for grain advances. At present a bond is passed in which the quantity of grain lent and the quantity to be repaid are stated at arbitrary prices more or less corresponding to the market rate. The bond is passed as a cash advance to avoid the higher stamp rates which attach to a grain or other transfer in kind. By a mutual understanding the payment is always made in grain. The increase or *v\u0101dha* is generally twenty-five to fifty per cent and sometimes but rarely as much as seventy-five or 100 per cent. This system sometimes presses hard on indigent cultivators as the creditor is careful to take his share of the crop as soon as the harvest is reaped. At the same time it encourages the storage of grain by dealers a practice of the highest usefulness in times of scarcity.\n\nIt is the general opinion in the district that, however much the district may have increased in trade wealth and resources since it came under British rule in 1848, the indebtedness of the landholding classes is not less but greater than it then was. Under the rule of the S\u0101t\u0101ra chiefs land was not liable to sale for debt. The lender had no wish to get the debtor's land; his object was to recover the interest due on the sums advanced. The lenders were fewer in number and men of higher position and of more forbearance than the present lenders. As the means of recovering debt were uncertain care was taken not to make advances without security. Soon after the transfer of the district (1848) the reduction of the state demand which accompanied the introduction of the revenue settlement, a reduction which roughly varied from twenty to thirty and was often as much as fifty per cent, increased the landholders' credit. Their credit was further enhanced by the free powers of disposing of land in mortgage or by sale which were secured to the holders of land under the provisions of the Survey Act I. of 1865. At the same time the landholder's credit was swollen by the abnormal cheapness of money and the high prices of field produce which ruled between 1862 and 1865 the years of the American war. The landholders borrowed recklessly. The enhanced value of the land as a security induced the lenders to encourage the landholders to borrow and introduced a new and lower class of lenders. At the same time the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which was passed in 1877 had increased the ease with which a lender could recover his debts, and the Limitation Act of 1869, though it was passed in the interest of the debtors with the object of relieving them from the burden of old and ancestral debt, was turned by the lenders to their own profit. The debtor at the end of the three years' limitation was forced either to give up land or to sign a fresh bond in which a debt was acknowledged composed of the amount originally borrowed together with compound interest up to the date of renewal. The soreness caused by the working of the Limitation Act was intensified by the decrease in the value of land which accompanied the fall of produce prices in 1873 and 1874. Creditors seeing the value of their security declining pressed their\ndebtors and caused the exasperation which resulted in the agrarian crimes of 1873-74.\n\nIn 1873-74 the second assistant collector noticed the following cases of agrarian crime. In the village of Chincha in T\u00e1sgaon six men who had a long-standing grudge against a Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1ni money-lender entered his house at midnight, murdered him with axes, and severely wounded his aged father, his younger brother, and his sister. Four of the men were hanged and one was transported for life. At Hingangaon in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur four men, whose whole property had been sold by a Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1ni creditor, attacked their persecutor and cut off his ears and the stump of his nose which had escaped on a former occasion. At Vis\u00e9pur in T\u00e1sgaon one \u00c1ppa R\u00e1vji owed money on a bond to Hir\u00e1chand Gujar. Hir\u00e1chand threatened to sell \u00c1ppa R\u00e1vji's land, but promised he would not sell it if \u00c1ppa R\u00e1vji got one \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li to go bail for him. \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li accordingly passed a bond of \u00a320 (Rs. 200) to the Gujar, giving his house and land as security. The agreement was that \u00c1ppa R\u00e1vji should at the same time in consideration of this and other debts pass \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li a bond of \u00a340 (Rs. 400) giving his land as security. This bond was never forthcoming. \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li was put off time after time. Meanwhile the Gujar enforced \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li's bond for \u00a320 (Rs. 200). After all due proceedings in the civil court \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li's lands and house were seized and his land was given to \u00c1ppa R\u00e1vji to cultivate. \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li despairing of redress waylaid Hir\u00e1chand Gujar and murdered him in open daylight in the presence of several witnesses. He confessed every thing and courted the fullest inquiry into his money transactions. \u00c1ppa M\u00e1li was hanged.\n\nThe agrarian riots of 1875 were not so common in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as in Poona and Ahmadnagar. Only one instance came before the Riots Commission. On the tenth of September 1875 a riot took place in the village of Kokrud on the north bank of the V\u00e1rna, some few miles west of Shir\u00e1l\u00e1, a country town about sixty miles south of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Kokrud contained 150 to 200 houses. The riot was against the moneylender of the village, N\u00e1na Gujar, whose dealings extended over many of the surrounding villages. In Kokrud alone 108 persons owed N\u00e1na Gujar \u00a3995 18s. (Rs. 9959) besides grain and in Chinchol some thirty persons had given him bonds to the extent of \u00a3190 3s. (Rs. 1901\u00bd). One of the ringleaders stated that the immediate cause of the outbreak was two attachments which had shortly before been executed by N\u00e1na on the houses and property of two of the villagers. He was also stated to have harassed the people generally. The result was a combination of all castes and professions. About a hundred villagers, who all appeared to be residents of Kokrud, met about nine at night in the temple of Mariamma on the skirts of the village, and from it proceeded to the Gujar's house. The house which was attacked contained the shop. It adjoined but was separate from the Gujar's dwelling house. Bahiru M\u00e1ng took command and divided the rioters into bands. One band of seven or eight were set to break into the shop from the front, and a\n\n---\n\n1 Deccan Riots Commission, Appendix A. 40-41.\n2 Deccan Riots Commission, Appendix C. 10-12.\nsecond band was posted near the back door. The rest were stationed at the various approaches to prevent interference by keeping up a fire of stones. Two Gujar men and three women were in the house at the time of the attack. They were warned of the intended attack and had taken the precaution to get the revenue p\u00e1t\u00edl to sleep with them. This was the only assistance given them by the village officers. The house was broken into by the front door and windows. The Gujars retreated into an inner room, from which the back door opened into the yard. The mob tore up the account books and piled them on the floor. Oil was poured on the heap, torches were brought, the heap was lighted, and the house fired. With the help of the p\u00e1t\u00edl the Gujars escaped to the next house and from it to a neighbour's dwelling. The house and shop were burnt with a loss of cloth and grain estimated by the Gujar at \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000). Thirty-six persons were arrested besides five whom the police sent up as witnesses. Of the accused twenty-four were Kunbis including members of the two families of village headmen, one was a Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r, one a Mh\u00e1r, six were M\u00e1ngs, one a S\u00fat\u00e1r, one a Gurav or priest, one a Nh\u00e1vi or barber, one a Beld\u00e1r or quarryman, four were Khumbh\u00e1rs or potters, and one was an Att\u00e1r or Musalm\u00e1n scent-hawker. Most of the accused admitted their share in the riot. One of the leaders a S\u00e1li or weaver made a full confession, while Bahiru M\u00e1ng and others denied all knowledge of the conspiracy.\n\nNews of the riots in the Poona and Nagar districts had no doubt reached all parts of the country, but there was no evidence to show that the riot was originated by outsiders from other parts of the Deccan. On the report of the Deccan Riots Commission S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was included in the area to which the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act (Act XVII of 1879) has been applied. Under the provisions of this Act no land can be sold in execution of a decree unless specifically pledged, the registration of all lands has been made compulsory, and every transaction has to be investigated independently of the bond. The courts have power to relieve the debtor by decreeing payments by instalments, while arbitration is encouraged by the system of village munsifs and conciliators. The most striking result of the Act has been the extraordinary check to litigation, while the rapid recovery of the district from the loss caused by the 1876-77 famine and the ease with which the revenue has been realised during the four years ending 1882 seem to show that the landholder's power of borrowing has not been unduly curtailed.\n\nSince the 1876-77 famine, except in the eastern sub-divisions of M\u00e1n Khat\u00e1v and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, little land has fallen out of tillage. Though it continues in the former holder's name much land has lately passed from husbandmen to non-cultivating moneylenders, either under civil court decrees or by mortgage. Until the introduction of the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act land was frequently sold under simple money decrees. In such cases the hardship is to some extent softened by the fact that the creditor has often for want of a tenant to let the land to the former holder. The bargain as to the share\n\n---\n\n1 Details of the working of the Act are given in the Poona Statistical Account,\nleft to the tenant is often hard enough on paper, but it is said that\nthe holder's special knowledge helps him to evade the severity of\nthe terms. Since the passing of the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief\nAct in 1879, part of the land mortgaged has been redeemed. Land\nis mortgaged either with or without possession. In mortgages\nwithout possession part of the produce is paid to the moneylender\nas interest till the mortgage is redeemed. In mortgages with\npossession the Maratha or Lingayat moneylender generally\nhimself tills the land; while the Brahman or Gujarati and Marwar\nVani moneylender, as a rule, allows the mortgagor to till the land\nas tenant, generally on condition that the tenant pays the landlord\nhalf to three-fifths of the produce and that the landlord pays the\nGovernment assessment. In some cases in which the possession of\nland has been transferred to them, especially to husbandmen, the new\nholders have invested money in the land and taken steps to improve it.\n\nEspecially in the south and south-east among the Jains, labour\nmortgage prevails to a limited extent among small landholders and\npoor labourers. When pressed for money either for marriages or for\nthe payment of debts men of this class occasionally pledge their\nservices to professional moneylenders or to large and well-to-do\nhusbandmen. The mortgaged services are generally valued at 3s. to\n4s. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 2) a month; a labourer has to serve five years to work\noff a loan of \u00a310 (Rs. 100). The labourer receives the money in\nadvance. In return he is bound to give his whole time to his master\nand has scarcely any leisure during which to make private earnings.\nThe master undertakes to feed the servant and to provide him\nwith a turban, a coarse blanket or kambl, a waistcloth or dhotar,\nand one pair of shoes a year. Unless he takes his meals at the\ncreditor's, the servant generally receives from his master a monthly\nallowance of forty-eight to sixty-four pounds (6-8 paylis) of\ngrain and a small quantity of condiments. The engagement does not\nprovide for any charges for lodging or for marriage or other\nincidental expenses. Though they are not entered in the engagement\na small reward for occasional good service and a present of a turban\nor a waistcloth are given to the servant on marriages or other\nsocial ceremonies in the creditor's family. Though the bondsman's\nservices are entirely at the disposal of the master, the master can-\nnot hand him to another person except for a time and for emergent\nreasons, and with the debtor's consent. Nor does the master's right\nextend to the bondsman's wife and children even though they are\nborn during the term of their father's service. In cases of sickness,\nold age, inability to serve, or death, the servant's wife and children\ngive their services to the master to work off the unliquidated portion\nof his loan. The master cannot inflict corporal punishment on\nthe servant. The course generally adopted to enforce a bondsman's\nservice is to warn him whenever he is found to be remiss or\nnegligent in his duty, and to deduct the number of blank or\nunsatisfactory days from the period of the service. Servants generally\nmanage to work to their masters' satisfaction. When higher rates\nof wages attract him elsewhere, the servant arranges to repay the\nbalance of the debt in cash and then leaves his master's service. If\nhe leaves without making any agreement the taint of broken\nfaith haunts him wherever he goes and makes it difficult for him to find employment. In most cases the servant is faithful to his engagement and will stand tempting offers of increased wages. Except under special circumstances the mortgage of labour does not pass from father to son. The system of domestic slavery or hereditary service which was a marked feature of society under the rule of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chiefs, has almost entirely passed away. In some of the higher Mar\u00e1tha and Br\u00e1hman families there are still male and female servants who are attached to the household and some of whom generally accompany a daughter of the house to her husband's home.\n\nAbout thirty years ago (1853) the wages were very low, about two-thirds of the present wages. The present (1883) rates are for a carpenter 1s. \u00bed. (8\u00bd as.), for a blacksmith 8d. (5\u00bd as.), for a bricklayer 7\u00bdd. (4\u00be as.), for a mason 9\u00bcd. (6\u00bd as.), and for an unskilled workman 2\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (1\u00bd-3 as.). Women are paid two-thirds and children, when they earn anything, one-half of a man's wages. Labourers are paid either in kind or in cash, daily weekly or fortnightly according to circumstances. Of late the tendency has been to change from wages in kind to wages in cash. Field work lasts nearly nine months in the year, from June to February. Between March and May field labourers are generally idle. Some support themselves on their savings if they have any and some live on money or grain borrowed from moneylenders on condition of paying it back during the next working season. Labourers employed at sugarcane mills are paid specially high rates, a skilled labourer earning 9d. to 1s. (6-8 as.), and a common labourer 6d. (4 as.) a day. They are allowed to eat as much molasses or gul as they please, and also each to take home a small quantity of molasses and one sugarcane. Labourers are in rare cases employed by weavers and oilmen to work for them and are paid 6d. (4 as.) and 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) a day with no extra allowance. There are no steam factories in the district. Women employed in spinning cotton are paid 3\u00bed. (2\u00bd as.) a day. They work from eight in the morning to five in the evening with one hour's rest at noon. The local unskilled labourers are chiefly Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, R\u00e1moshis, and others. Good caste Hindus have no objection to employ these labourers out of doors. Landholders do not consider their servants as members of their families. They seldom feed them, clothe them, or help them to bear the expense of marriage or other domestic ceremonies. The labouring classes find more constant and better paid employment than formerly. Those who are not given to liquor generally save enough to be able to enjoy specially good food and to wear specially good clothes on holidays.\n\nYearly price details, which are little more than estimates, are available for the forty-three years ending 1882. During these forty-three years the rupee price of Indian millet, which is the staple grain of the district, varied from seventeen pounds in 1879\n\n---\n\n1 In J\u00e1vli, field workers are sometimes paid only 1\u00bdd. (1\u00bd as.) a day and one daily meal.\nto ninety-three in 1842 and averaged fifty-four pounds. Of the forty-three years, in three the price was below eighty pounds the rupee, ninety-three in 1842, eighty-five in 1850, and eighty-one in 1856; in five it was between eighty and seventy pounds, seventy-seven in 1843 and seventy-four in 1851, 1852, 1853, and 1854; in thirteen it was between seventy and sixty, seventy in 1855, sixty-seven in 1864, sixty-six in 1859 1865 and 1869, sixty-five in 1845, sixty-three in 1849, sixty-two in 1860, 1861, 1862 and 1863, and sixty-one in 1844 and 1848; in nine it was between sixty and fifty, sixty in 1858, fifty-eight in 1840 and 1841, fifty-seven in 1857 and 1866, fifty-three in 1867 1868 and 1870, and fifty-one in 1882; in three it was between fifty and forty, forty-nine in 1881, forty-five in 1847, and forty-four in 1846; in seven it was between thirty and twenty, thirty in 1871 and 1877, twenty-eight in 1872, twenty-six in 1873, twenty-three in 1880, twenty-two in 1875, and twenty-one in 1878; and in three it was between twenty and fifteen, twenty in 1874, nineteen in 1876, and seventeen in 1879. Till 1865, except in 1840, 1841, 1846, 1847, and 1857, the price was below sixty pounds the rupee. Since 1865, except in 1869, the price has been above sixty pounds. The forty-three years may be divided into six periods. Except in 1842 when the price was ninety-three pounds, and in 1846 and 1847 when the prices were forty-four and forty-five pounds respectively, in the first period of ten years ending 1849 the price varied from seventy-seven in 1843 to fifty-eight in 1840 and 1841 and averaged sixty-two pounds. In the second period of seven years ending 1856, the price varied from eighty-five in 1850 to seventy in 1855, and averaged seventy-six pounds. In the third period of nine years ending 1865, the price varied from sixty-seven in 1864 to fifty-seven in 1857 and averaged sixty-three pounds. In the fourth period of five years ending 1870, the price varied from sixty-six in 1869 to fifty-three in 1867 1868 and 1870 and averaged fifty-six pounds. In the fifth period of ten years ending 1880, the price varied from thirty in 1871 and 1877 to seventeen in 1879 and averaged twenty-four pounds. In the sixth period of two years 1881 and 1882 the prices were forty-nine pounds for 1881 and fifty-one for 1882.

These weights are square or round and are made of flint. The table for weighing gold and silver is eight gunjas one masa, twelve masas one tola, twenty-four tol\u00e1s one sher, and forty shers one man. The gunja is the seed of the Abrus precatorius. The masa and tola are either square, round, or cylindrical, and are made of crystal, glass, broken chinaware, lead, brass, or bellmetal. For the tola the Imperial rupee is generally used, which weighs $1\\frac{1}{4}$ masas. Iron, zinc, brass, lead, tin, and other cheaper metals, and cotton are weighed by the table, two ardha-chhataks one chhatak, two chhataks one adpav, two adpavs one pav, two pavs one achher, two achhers one sher, thirteen shers one man, and twenty mans one khandi. The ardha chhatak weighs about two and a half and the sher about seventy-six Imperial rupees. Spices, sugar, molasses, alkali, coffee, and other drugs are weighed by this table, two savasers one adeshri, two adeshris one pasri, two pasris one dhada, four dhaddis one man, and twenty mans one khandi. The savasher weighs thirty Imperial rupees.\n\nRice and other grains and salt are generally sold by measures and rarely by weight. The table is two nilvas one kolva, two kolvas one chipta, two chiptas one mupta, two muptas one sher, two shers one adeshri, two adeshris one payli, sixteen paylis one man, and twenty mans one khandi. These measures are shaped like an hourglass, are made of wood, iron, copper, or brass, and have a Government stamp pressed on them. The nilva of grain weighs about $6\\frac{1}{2}$ and the adeshri about 208 Imperial rupees. Milk, clarified butter, and oil are sold either by weights or measures. The weights are the same as those used in selling copper and sugar. The measures are, two payshers one achher, and two achhers one sher. The paysher weighs twenty Imperial rupees. The measures are either maps made of copper and brass, or lotas made of earthenware. In the eastern sub-divisions of Man, Khatav, Khanapur, and Targaon oil is measured by the ladle or pal, and a set of small metal bowls or lotas which serve as a quarter, a half, and a one sher measure. Perfumed oils and powder are weighed by the weights used in weighing gold and silver. The length measures in use are the gaj and var made of iron, brass, copper, or wood. The gaj is about thirty-five inches, and is divided into twenty-four tasus of a little less than an inch and a half each. The var is about one tasu longer than the gaj. Except silk waistcloths or pitambars, brocade shouldercloths or dupetas, and other costly articles which are sold by weight, cloth and piece-goods are sold by the length.\nBamboo matting or tatty\u00e1s and coarse matting used in protecting walls from rain are sold by the surface. The surface measures are either the English foot and yard, or the Native cubits or h\u00e1ts and spans or vits. The h\u00e1t is the length from the elbow-joint to the end of the middle finger. All masonry work, walls of brick or stone, foundations, plinths, and platforms, are measured by cubic foot. Timber is measured by the cubit or by the gaj. In such earthwork as digging reservoirs and ponds, the unit of measurement is called chavkadi. The cubic contents of a chavkadi which is ten h\u00e1ts long, ten h\u00e1ts broad, and one h\u00e1t deep, are one hundred cubic h\u00e1ts. Earth-works such as mounds of earth, roads, and canal embankments, as also rough-hewn stones and road metal, which are spread and piled in heaps on the ground and used for metalling roads, are measured by the cubic foot. Chips of stones sand and metal are sold by a measure called the khandi. Before the introduction of the revenue survey in 1853, the bigha was used as a land measure. 5\u00bd h\u00e1ts or 8\u00bd feet made one k\u00e1thi, twenty k\u00e1this one p\u00e1nd, and twenty p\u00e1nds one bigha. Since the introduction of the revenue survey, except in a few unsurveyed alienated villages, the bigha measure has given place to the English acre.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\u00b9\n\nIn the days of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s there were two principal routes above the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. One the Poona-Kolhapur and Karn\u00e1tak route ran by the little Bor pass in Poona, the S\u00e1lpa pass at the north-east of Koregaon, the N\u00e1vi pass south-east of Koregaon, and then either by the line of the present S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road through T\u00e1sgaon and Miraj, or by T\u00e1rgaon and Masur to Kar\u00e1d. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra lay slightly off the road to the south-west from the village of Deur. Even as far back as the days of Shiv\u00e1ji the S\u00e1lpa pass is said to have been made practicable for wheel traffic and the old line is still pointed out. It is very steep according to modern notions. The other main line was that east to Pandharpur by the Kaldhon pass. From the earliest times the Mala, North and South Tivra, and Varandha passes were used for pack bullocks to and from the Konkan. While at Shingnapur in M\u00e1n and Diks\u00e1l in Khat\u00e1v there were paths communicating with the Phaltan plain.\n\nForts nearly always marked the old passes. V\u00e1sota and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1gad were near the North Tivra pass; Bhairavgad between the Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed and Mala passes; Mahimadangad near the Amboli pass; Prachitgad near the South Tivra pass; Prat\u00e1pgad near the J\u00e1lvi pass; Kenjalgad and Kamalgad near the W\u00e1i passes. T\u00e1thv\u00e1da and V\u00e1rugad commanded routes into the Phaltan country. A very ancient pilgrim route marked by rest-houses at the principal villages is the Ratn\u00e1giri-Pandharpur route, which passed on the South Tivra pass, thence either by Yelgaon to Kar\u00e1d, Surli, and M\u00e1yni or by Ashta T\u00e1sgaon and Vita into the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division now part of the Pant Pratinidhi\u2019s possessions.\n\nIn\u00b21826 ten routes or lines of traffic ran through the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. Of these ten lines, two went north and south from Poona to Belgaum, two went north-east from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Sirur in Poona and Ahmadnagar, two went east from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Shol\u00e1pur, two went south-west from Kar\u00e1d, one to R\u00e1j\u00e1pur and the other to M\u00e1lvan in Ratn\u00e1giri, and two went west to D\u00e1poli in Ratn\u00e1giri. Of the two lines which ran south from Poona to Belgaum through S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, one line, about 241 miles long, went by the Bor pass through Koregaon, and the other line, about 213 miles long, crossed the Nira near Shirval at thirty miles south.\n\n\u00b9 Compiled from materials supplied by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie C.\u00ba S., Mr. C. Brereton C.

The Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass, also called the Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 or Harali pass, was thirty-six miles south of Poona and twenty-eight miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and was a good road for cattle. Of the two lines which ran north-east from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, one went eighty-seven miles to Sirur in Poona, and the other went 120 miles to Ahmadnagar. For thirty-four miles from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Shirval both these lines followed the Poona-Belgaum line by the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass. Of the two lines which went east from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Shol\u00e1pur by Pandharpur, one line, about 131 miles long, went by Tripuri, Vish\u00e1pur, Khatgun, and Pingli, and south of this, the other line, about 148 miles long, went by Rahimatpur, Puses\u00e1vli, M\u00e1yni, and the Kaldhon pass. The Kaldhon pass, though fit for carts, had a bad ascent. Of the two lines which ran southwest from Kar\u00e1d one line, about 117 miles long, went by the Ankusra or Anaskura pass to R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, and the other line, about 119 miles long, went by Kolh\u00e1pur and the Phonda pass to M\u00e1lvan. Of the 117 miles by the Ankusra pass only thirty-three miles from Kar\u00e1d to Malk\u00e1pur were fit for carts. Though it was much used by Vanj\u00e1ris, the Ankusra pass road had neither rest-houses nor temples. Of the 119 miles by the Phonda pass the seventy-five miles from Kar\u00e1d to the pass were fit for carts, the two miles through the pass were fit for pack bullocks, and the rest was fairly good through thin forest.\n\nThe Phonda pass, one of the easiest routes between the Konkan and the Deccan, was better than the Ankusra pass. Of the two lines which went west to D\u00e1poli in Ratn\u00e1giri, one line from Shol\u00e1pur, about 222 miles long, followed the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Shol\u00e1pur line by the Kaldhon pass to Puses\u00e1vli in Khat\u00e1v at 116 miles from Shol\u00e1pur. From Puses\u00e1vli this line turned south-west by Malh\u00e1rpeth, P\u00e1tan, and the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass. The road from Puses\u00e1vli to the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass and beyond through Ratn\u00e1giri was generally bad and rocky. The other line to D\u00e1poli, about sixty-seven miles long, went west from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by the Amboli pass. For thirty-three miles from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Valvan near the pass the road was fair, the five miles through the pass though passable were difficult to cattle, and the rest through Ratn\u00e1giri was extremely bad. The Amboli pass was steep towards the top and had a circuitous descent.\n\nBefore 1840 cart traffic was almost unknown. The first made road was from Poona to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by the S\u00e1lpa pass. In 1841 the whole of this road was made fit for carts. In 1848, except along the old Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Mah\u00e1baleshvar made roads, the traffic went by pack bullocks. The road from Poona to Belgaum and Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r which then ran by the present N\u00e1vi-Deur and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon line, and the road from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Kolh\u00e1pur which then ran by Masur, Kar\u00e1d, and Kasegaon to the V\u00e1rna, were both partly passable to carts. During the fair season the route from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Poona by the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass was chosen by bullock drivers and\n\n---\n\n1 Road details for 1848 and 1849 are chiefly taken from the late Sir Bartle Frere's Annual Reports.\nhorsemen, but the old Poona road by the S\u00e1lpa pass seems to have been that chiefly used by carts. In 1848, a monthly average of about 3000 carts, including those coming from Pandharpur by Phaltan, went by the S\u00e1lpa pass.\\(^1\\) In 1849, Sir Bartle Frere, then Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, noticed that the direct distance from the sea of the chief S\u00e1t\u00e1ra marts varied from thirty-five to sixty miles, while that of the marts in other Deccan districts and Kh\u00e1ndesh varied from fifty to 125 miles. In spite of this nearness by cart roads the coast was 140 to 200 miles from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and only seventy to 180 miles from the other districts. This was due to the Sahy\u00e1dri barrier between S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the coast. At this time the Sahy\u00e1dri passes within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits were, at the best, fit only for laden cattle, and even these cattle tracks lay fifteen to thirty miles apart. Under British rule three leading S\u00e1t\u00e1ra passes have been made fit for wheels across the Sahy\u00e1dris. In 1857, the opening of the Varandha pass put W\u00e1i within sixty miles of Mah\u00e1d by cart road; in 1864 the opening of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass put Kar\u00e1d within sixty miles of Chiplun; and in 1876 the opening of the FitzGerald pass placed W\u00e1i and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra within fifty miles of Mah\u00e1d. At present these three passes form the chief outlets to the coast.\\(^2\\) With regard to the comparative efficiency of packs and carts as means of transport, Sir Bartle Frere calculated that carts saved two-fifths in cost and one-third in time.\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1848, in the present district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, excluding T\u00e1sgaon, the number of carts was 8119, of which 2937 had wooden wheels with tires, 5603 had stone wheels, and 119 had wheels of solid wood. Of these, carts with wooden wheels were alone used for traffic, as the stone wheel carts drawn by twelve bullocks travelled only two-thirds of the pace of the carts with wooden wheels and tires drawn by three bullocks. The stone wheel carts have now (1883) mostly given place to carts with wooden wheels, spokes, and tires. In 1848 the number of bullocks and cows was 444,512 against 296,902 in 1878. The greater number in 1848 is probably due partly to the large bullock traffic and partly to the large area of waste land. In 1849 between the 1st of January and the 30th of June, 144,664 bullocks that is a daily average of about 1000 went by the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass.\n\n\\(^2\\) The following statement shows the traffic by these passes between December 1877 and June 1878. As this traffic belongs to Kolh\u00e1pur, Miraj, S\u00e1ngli, Phaltan, and Pandharpur, as well as to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the statement does not show the district imports and exports, but the general usefulness of these passes. Besides by these pass roads bullocks find their way to the coast by the North Tivra, South Tivra, and Mala passes:\n\n### S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Sahy\u00e1dri Pass Traffic, December 1877 to June 1878\n\n| Pass               | Loaded | Empty | Total | Loaded | Unloaded |\n|--------------------|--------|-------|-------|--------|----------|\n|                    | Grain  | Other-|       |        |          |\n|                    |        | wise  |       |        |          |\n| Into the Konkan    |        |       |       |        |          |\n| Kumbh\u00e1rli          | 55,845 | 15,046| 826   | 71,717 | 8108     |\n| Varandha           | 798    | 5526  | 225   | 4549   | 1033     |\n| FitzGerald         | 3530   | 1539  | 68    | 5127   | 13,844   |\n| Total              | 60,173 | 20,111| 1109  | 81,393 | 22,985   |\n| From the Konkan    |        |       |       |        |          |\n| Kumbh\u00e1rli          |        | 26,296| 28,927| 55,223 | 4138     |\n| Varandha           |        | 1     | 2377  | 1748   | 4124     |\n| FitzGerald         |        | 1026  | 2044  | 3970   | 7932     |\n| Total              |        | 30,609| 32,727| 63,327 | 11,831   |\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bombay Gazetteer, 196\n\n\\(^2\\) Bombay Gazetteer, 196\nAt present few districts are so well provided with roads as the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. During the four rainy months from June to September, as the ports of Chiplun and Mah\u00e1d are closed, little traffic is carried over any of the roads except the Poona-Belgaum road. At present (1883) the district has fifty-one lines of road running over 956 miles. Of these 206\u00bd miles are metalled, 166 miles murumed that is laid with crumbly trap, 193\u00bd bridged, and 120 partly bridged and drained. Of these, seven lines running over 372\u00be miles are maintained out of Provincial revenues, and are under the charge of the public works department. The remaining forty-four lines running over 583\u00bc miles are maintained from local funds. Of the forty-four local fund lines three are first class lines running over 89\u00bc miles, thirteen are second class lines running over 204 miles, and twenty-eight are third class lines running over 290 miles. The first and second class lines are under the charge of the public works department and the third class lines which are mere fair weather tracks, are under the charge of the revenue department.\n\nThe yearly ordinary charges which have been sanctioned for five years are \u00a315 (Rs. 150) the mile for first class lines, \u00a35 (Rs. 50) for second class lines, and \u00a33 (Rs. 30) for third class lines. Of the total fifty-one lines thirteen are most important. Of these four lines, the Poona-Belgaum, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Lonand or Old Poona, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon, and Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon roads run north and south, and the remaining nine lines Varandha-Dharmapuri, Surul-Mah\u00e1baleshwar and FitzGerald Pass, W\u00e1i-\u0100darki, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Mah\u00e1baleshwar, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur, Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur, Kar\u00e1d-N\u00e1gaj, Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rli and Peth-S\u00e1ngli roads run east and west. Of the four lines which run north and south, the Poona-Belgaum mail road is the chief line of traffic in the district. It is metalled and bridged throughout and runs in the district for 101 miles from the Shirval bridge on the Nira in the north to Kanegaon on the V\u00e1rna in the south. Of these 101 miles 99\u00bd lie within district limits and 1\u00bd miles within Kolhapur limits. The road passes by the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass through the W\u00e1i, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, and V\u00e1lva sub-divisions by the towns of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Umbraj, Kar\u00e1d, Kasegaon, Nerla, Peth, and K\u00e1meri. It is passable by carts throughout the year. The road is bridged on the Nira near Shirval at thirty miles from Poona, on the Krishna near Bhuinj at fifty-six miles, on the Vena near Varya at sixty-seven miles, on the Urmodi near L\u00e1tna at seventy-nine miles, on the T\u00e1rl\u00ed near Umbraj at ninety-one miles, on the Koyna near Kar\u00e1d at 101 miles, and on the V\u00e1rna near Kanegaon at 129 miles. It has six travellers\u2019 bungalows, two at Shirval in W\u00e1i, one at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, two at Atit and Kar\u00e1d in Kar\u00e1d, and one at Nerla in V\u00e1lva, and four district officers\u2019 bungalows at Umbraj and Kar\u00e1d in Kar\u00e1d and at Kasegaon and Kanegaon in V\u00e1lva. This road is crossed by almost all the important roads of the district as feeders. Through the greater part of its course this road is well shaded by road-side trees, chiefly b\u00e1bhuls in the black soil and figs, tamarinds, and mangoes in other parts. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Lonand or Old Poona road, about thirty-four miles long, has been a local fund road since 1863-64 and is now in the first class. It leaves the Poona district at the Nira and runs south-west by the S\u00e1lp\u00e1 pass through part of Khand\u00e1la,\nPhaltan, Koregaon, and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. At Lonand in W\u00e1i this road is crossed by the Mah\u00e1d-Pandharpur road, at Tadvala in Koregaon by the W\u00e1i-\u00c1darki road, and at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra it merges into the Poona Belgaum road. It is murumed, that is laid with crumbly trap, and is bridged throughout except at the V\u00e1sna on the fourteenth mile north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and at one or two other small streams. This road is shaded by magnificent avenues of tamarind and fig trees. Most of the bridging was done after 1818 by the first R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It has a travellers' bungalow at Deur in Koregaon. The road is passable by carts during the fair season, and with difficulty during the rains. Many carts still prefer this road to the Poona-Belgaum metallled road. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon second class local fund road sixty-four miles long runs south-east through the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Koregaon, Khat\u00e1v, and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-divisions by Rahimatpur, Puses\u00e1vli, Kadepur, and V\u00e1ngi, and joins the Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon road near Turchi about five miles north of T\u00e1sgaon. Except for the first eight miles between S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Chinchner, the road is not bridged and at Dh\u00e1mner in Koregaon the Krishna is crossed by a ferry during the rains. On the borders of Koregaon and Khat\u00e1v the road crosses the Nh\u00e1vi hill-pass over which a new line with easy gradients has lately been finished to Puses\u00e1vli. Four miles north of Puses\u00e1vli a branch road leads three miles east to Aundh, the residence of the Pant Pratinidhi. At thirty miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and three miles south of Puses\u00e1vli it crosses the Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur road and at thirty-nine miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and about three miles east of Kadegaon in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur it crosses the Kar\u00e1d-N\u00e1gaj road. The road is fit for carts during the fair season. The traffic on this road is chiefly north of Puses\u00e1vli through Rahimatpur with S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In the fair season it is not inconsiderable and consists chiefly of local produce. At Puses\u00e1vli it has a district bungalow. The Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon first class local fund road 35\u00bd miles long runs south-east through parts of Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, and T\u00e1sgaon by Shenavli, T\u00e1k\u00e1ri, and Kundal. It is murumed, that is laid with crumbly trap, and is passable by carts during the fair season. At K\u00e1rve, about three miles south of Kar\u00e1d, the road crosses the Krishna and at about five miles west of T\u00e1sgaon it crosses the Yerla. Both these rivers are unbridged. For about seven miles between Serch and Kundal the road borders the Krishna canal. This road carries heavy cart traffic, and has lately been much improved by building culverts and road drains. It is fit for carts throughout the year, but the surface is by no means equal to the heavy traffic which passes over it from March to the middle of May. Of the nine lines which run east and west, the Varandha-Dharmapuri second class Provincial road runs eighty-seven miles from Dharmapuri on the border of Shol\u00e1pur and Phaltan to Varandha at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and from Varandha to Mah\u00e1d. The road passes in the north through Phaltan, W\u00e1i, and Bhor. At Lonand on the border of W\u00e1i and Phaltan it crosses the old Poona road and at Shirval it crosses the Poona-Belgaum road. From Lonand to Shirval the road is more or less murumed and the Pant Sachiv has lately been draining and muruming the portion between Shirval and Bhor. For eleven miles from Varandha at the foot to Hirdoshi at the\ntop of the Sahyadris the road is bridged, drained, and metalled. From Hirdoshi the road runs west to the port of Mah\u00e1d. The Varandha-Dharmapuri road is passable to carts during the fair season. The Surul-FitzGerald pass road leaves the Poona-Belgaum road at forty-eight miles from Poona in W\u00e1i, and runs by W\u00e1i and Malcolmpeeth to Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ba. Of the total sixty-one miles from Surul to Mah\u00e1d forty-six are within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits. It is a first class Provincial road, and is metalled and bridged throughout within district limits. About two miles west of W\u00e1i the road passes by the Pasarni pass and about two miles west of Malcolmpeeth by the FitzGerald pass. It is fit for carts throughout the year, and has three travellers' bungalows at P\u00e1nchgani, W\u00e1i, and V\u00e1da near the FitzGerald pass. The W\u00e1i-\u00c1darki pass road is a second class local fund road, about twenty-two miles long. It runs from the Phaltan state to W\u00e1i by the \u00c1darki pass and the Shirgaon gorge, and meets the Surul-FitzGerald pass road at W\u00e1i. Since the 1876 famine the road has been much improved by easing the gradients at the Shirgaon gorge or khind and building revetment walls and drains. It is fit for carts at all seasons. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Malcolmpeeth first class Provincial road, about thirty-three miles long, leaves the Poona-Belgaum road two miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and runs by Medha and the Kelghar pass. The eleven miles from Kelghar to Mah\u00e1baleshvar and the two miles along which its course lies on the Poona-Belgaum mail road are metalled; the rest of the road is murumed. The rivers and larger streams are bridged and the smaller streams are crossed by road dams. The road is fit for carts at all seasons. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road sixty-four miles long is a second class local fund road, but is being gradually brought into the first class. It runs due east through the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Koregaon, Khat\u00e1v, and M\u00e1n subdivisions. Of the Krishna, V\u00e1sna, Yerla, and M\u00e1n, which this road crosses, the V\u00e1sna alone is bridged and the Krishna has a flying bridge at M\u00e1huli about three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Besides these bridges the road has a few culverts and road dams at intervals. It crosses two small hill passes of easy gradients, the Vardhangad pass at eighteen miles and the Mahimangad pass at thirty-three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The road is fit for carts, in parts at all seasons and in parts only during the fair season. The Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur road, about fifty-four miles of which lie within the district, is a second class local fund road. This road starts at Malh\u00e1rpeth about eight miles east of P\u00e1tan on the Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed pass road, and runs to Pandharpur through parts of P\u00e1tan, Kar\u00e1d, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Khat\u00e1v, \u00c1tp\u00e1di, and M\u00e1n by the towns of Umbraj, Masur, M\u00e1yni, Kaldhon, and Diganchi. For eight miles between Malh\u00e1rpeth and Umbraj the road is murumed and bridged, and at all seasons carries heavy traffic. At Umbraj during the rains the Krishna is crossed by a flying bridge and during the fair weather by a heavy sandy crossing. For the remaining forty-six miles from Umbraj the road is a fair weather track, crossing the N\u00e1ndni at twenty-five miles from Malh\u00e1rpeth, the Yerla at about thirty-five miles, and the M\u00e1n at about seventy miles near Diganchi. This road passes over the Ural gorge or khind in P\u00e1tan and over the Sh\u00e1ngaon gorge on the\nborders of Kar\u00e1d and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. Between Umbraj and M\u00e1yni the road has a few culverts and road dams at intervals. The Kar\u00e1d-N\u00e1gaj second class Provincial road, of which fifty-nine miles lie within the district, runs to N\u00e1gaj through Kar\u00e1d and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur by the towns of Kar\u00e1d, Kadegaon, Vita, and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and from N\u00e1gaj to Bij\u00e1pur through the Miraj and Jath states. This road passes over the Sad\u00e1shivgad pass in Kar\u00e1d and crosses the Krishna at Kar\u00e1d, the N\u00e1ndni at Amr\u00e1pur twelve miles from Kar\u00e1d, the Yerla at Hanmant-v\u00e1di nineteen miles, and the \u00c1gr\u00e1ni at Sult\u00e1ngad forty miles. These rivers are unbridged, but some of the smaller streams have road dams. During the 1876-77 famine the road was much improved, and during the fair season is passable to carts. The Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road, a first class Provincial road, runs through Kar\u00e1d and P\u00e1tan by the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass to Chiplun in Ratn\u00e1giri. Of the total length of fifty-eight miles from Kar\u00e1d to Chiplun, forty-six miles are kept in repair by the executive engineer of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; of this thirty-nine lie within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits and seven within Ratn\u00e1giri limits. This road is metalled and bridged throughout and passable to carts throughout the year. It carries to the coast all the exports from the south, south-east, and east of the district. The Peth-S\u00e1ngli road, about twenty miles long, is a first class local fund road. Of the total twenty miles fifteen are murumed and bridged, and the remaining five miles are being completed. This road joins Peth on the Poona-Belgaum road to the S\u00e1ngli state, feeds the Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road, and at all seasons carries considerable traffic.\n\nBesides these thirteen chief lines five notable third class local fund lines are passable to carts during the fair season. Of these the T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u00e1la road, about forty-five miles long, runs south from Phaltan to T\u00e1sgaon by the Mogr\u00e1la pass in M\u00e1n through the sub-divisions of M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and T\u00e1sgaon. The chief towns on this road are Pingli in M\u00e1n, M\u00e1yni in Khat\u00e1v, Vita in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and T\u00e1sgaon. At Pingli the road crosses the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road, at M\u00e1yni the Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur road, and at Vita the Kar\u00e1d-N\u00e1gaj road. The Puses\u00e1vli-Shingn\u00e1pur road, about thirty-four miles long, runs from Puses\u00e1vli on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road through Khat\u00e1v and M\u00e1n by the sub-divisional towns of Vaduj and Dahivadi. The Nh\u00e1vi-Deur road, about twenty-four miles long, runs south through Koregaon from Deur on the old Poona road to Nh\u00e1vi on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road, and joins the old Poona road with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road through Koregaon. The T\u00e1sgaon-Isl\u00e1mpur road, about twenty-four miles long, runs by Bhilavdi to Isl\u00e1mpur on the Peth-S\u00e1ngli road. And the V\u00e1rna valley road, about thirty-six miles long, runs westward along the V\u00e1rna from Peth to the Mala pass, by the towns of Shir\u00e1la, Bil\u00e1si, and Charan.\n\nBesides these, there are two notable bullock tracks. One the Valvan-P\u00e1nchvad runs twenty-one miles from Valvan on the top of the Ambola pass to Medha by B\u00e1mnoli and twelve miles further to P\u00e1nchvad by the Kud\u00e1l gorge which is passable to carts. It joins the Koyna, Yenna, and Kud\u00e1l valleys with the Krishna valley, and brings a great deal of traffic from the Konkan by the Ambola pass,\nThis track is yearly repaired so far as Alev\u00e1di on the P\u00e1nchvad side of the Kud\u00e1l gorge, and it is contemplated to make it passable for carts from Alev\u00e1di to P\u00e1nchvad where it meets the Poona-Belgaum road. The other, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-P\u00e1tan track about twenty-one miles long, runs over two difficult hill passes for seven miles between Vajroshi and P\u00e1tan. At P\u00e1tan this track meets the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road by the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass and saves a round of sixteen miles by the Poona-Belgaum road.\n\nThe Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and their offshoots are crossed by thirteen made passes. Of these five, the Kh\u00e1m\u00e1tki on the Mah\u00e1dev range and the Varandha, Pasarni, FitzGerald, and Kumbh\u00e1rli on the Sahy\u00e1dri range are the most important. The Kh\u00e1m\u00e1tki pass, crossed by the Poona-Belgaum metalled road, begins on the Mah\u00e1dev range near the village of Khand\u00e1la in W\u00e1i at forty miles from Poona, runs up the hill for four miles, and runs down for about two miles to the village of Vela at forty-six miles. The pass was begun in 1856 and completed in 1859 at a cost of \u00a39916 (Rs. 99,160). On the top of the pass is a toll bar which was sold for \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000) for 1882-83. Almost all traffic which before the making of this pass went by the old Poona road, now goes through the Kh\u00e1m\u00e1tki pass. The Varandha pass in the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, which is crossed by the Shol\u00e1pur-Mah\u00e1d or Varandha-Dharmapuri road, begins at the village of Hirdoshi in Bhor at seventy-six road miles from Dharmapuri, runs up the hill for two miles, and enters the Konkan by a descent of about nine miles near the village of M\u00e1njri at eighty-seven road miles from Dharmapuri. The pass was begun in 1851 and completed in 1857 at a cost of \u00a311,106 (Rs. 1,11,060). For about a mile the pass runs over a narrow and precipitous spur almost all in rock-cutting. On one side of the pass the precipice is 200 to 300 feet high and the other side is a sheer descent of 600 to 800 feet. This is one of the most peculiar and striking lines of road on the whole length of the Sahy\u00e1dri range. The pass has two toll bars at Hirdoshi and Varandha. For the year 1882-83 the Hirdoshi toll bar was sold for \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500) and the Varandha toll bar for \u00a3160 (Rs. 1600). The Pasarni pass in the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds crossed by the Surul or Poona-Mah\u00e1baleshvar metalled road, begins in W\u00e1i on the Vair\u00e1tgad spur of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds at fifty-six miles from Poona and runs up the hill for about six miles. The pass was begun in 1850 and completed in 1863 at a cost of \u00a316,910 (Rs. 1,69,100). In 1872-73 it was improved at a further cost of about \u00a39000 (Rs. 90,000). On the top of the pass at the village of Dh\u00e1ndegad there is a toll bar which was sold for \u00a3241 10s. (Rs. 2415) in 1882-83. This is the main route for passengers from Poona to Mah\u00e1baleshvar, and it is crossed by a considerable goods traffic from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Mah\u00e1d. The \u00c1mben\u00e1l\u00e1 or FitzGerald pass road in the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds crossed by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Mah\u00e1baleshvar and the Surul-Mah\u00e1baleshvar roads to Mah\u00e1d runs about twenty miles from the top of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hills to the village of Kapde at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds in the Konkan. The pass was begun in 1871 and completed in 1876 at a cost of \u00a344,452 (Rs. 4,44,520). The FitzGerald pass has been lined with considerable care, and appears to be the best and cheapest route available. The ascent\nis so gradual that ponies have been trotted from the V\u00e1da bungalow at the foot of Prat\u00e1pgad to Mah\u00e1baleshvar without drawing rein. The district traffic to the port of Mah\u00e1d is pretty equally divided between the Varandha and FitzGerald passes. At the village of \u00c1mbenala half-way down the pass there is a good travellers' bungalow and a toll bar which in 1881-82 sold for \u00a341 (Rs. 410). The Kumbh\u00e1rli pass, in the Sahy\u00e1dris, crossed by the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road, begins on the Sahy\u00e1dri main range at the village of Dh\u00e1nkal at thirty-seven miles from Kar\u00e1d and twenty-one miles from Chiplun, runs up for two miles to the village of Khempse on the top of the pass, and runs down for seven miles to the village of Pophli at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dris in Ratn\u00e1giri. The pass has steep gradients and sharp curves. It was begun in 1855 and finished in 1864 at a cost of \u00a330,589 (Rs. 3,05,890). The traffic over this pass is the heaviest pass traffic in the district. At the village of Dh\u00e1nkal at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dris in P\u00e1tan there is a toll bar which in 1882-83 fetched \u00a31650 (Rs. 16,500).\n\nBesides these chief made passes, each sub-division except T\u00e1sgaon has several smaller passes and gorges called khinds. Beginning from the north in the western and central belts, W\u00e1i has nine gorges. Of these three the Harli, V\u00e1h\u00e1gaon, and Ganesh are on the Chandan-Vandan spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range between W\u00e1i and Koregaon; one the G\u00e1da is in the Khand\u00e1l petty division, and five the \u00c1nvad, Kanheri, Korsal, Mandap, and T\u00e1ygh\u00e1t are in the W\u00e1i m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00e1r's division. The Harli, a mere footpath with little traffic, is about eighteen miles east of W\u00e1i and joins the village of Harli in W\u00e1i with the village of Solshi in Koregaon. A little south of Harli, the V\u00e1h\u00e1gaon gorge joins the village of V\u00e1h\u00e1gaon in W\u00e1i with the village of Randulabad in Koregaon. It is not fit for carts. A little south of V\u00e1h\u00e1gaon, the Ganesh, a footpath with little traffic, joins the village of Kholavdi in W\u00e1i with the village of Banv\u00e1di in Koregaon. The G\u00e1da, on the hills between Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 and Bhor, gives a short cut from Bhor to the Poona-Belgaum road at Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 and leads by the Harli gorge to Koregaon. Up the gorge lie the village of Mirja of the Bhor state and the village of Atit of the Khand\u00e1l petty division and down the pass lie the villages of Kanhavdi and Utravli of the Bhor state. In 1882 the track over the gorge, which had been very difficult, was widened and improved at a cost of about \u00a360 (Rs. 600) by one Mainai More of Mirj\u00e1chiv\u00e1di of the Bhor state. Laden animals now cross with ease and empty carts avail themselves of the short cut. The pathway is about ten feet broad and is roughly built with dry stones and covered with murum or crumbly trap. It has no toll. The value of the yearly in and out traffic is roughly estimated at about \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000), chiefly in grain, tobacco, salt, oil, clarified butter, cocoa-kernels, spices, groundnuts, vegetables, dried fish, and native shoes. Formerly the traffic over this gorge was much greater; now the Shol\u00e1pur-Mah\u00e1d road by Bhor draws most of the heavy traffic. The \u00c1nvad gorge, about six miles north of W\u00e1i on the M\u00e1ndhardev hills, gives a short cut from Bhor to W\u00e1i. Across this gorge tracks with good gradients were formerly made, leading from Ving and Shirval in the north to W\u00e1i and Abhepuri in the south. These tracks are now seldom repaired,\nbut they are still passable though bad in places. Though largely used before the making of the present good roads, the tracks now carry little traffic. On the crest of the gorge are a rest-house or dharmash\u00e1ta and three reservoirs built by T\u00e1\u00ed S\u00e1heb Sachiv, the great-grandmother of the present chief of Bh\u00f3r. The rest-house is kept in good repair and has a garden of fruits and flowers. Of the three reservoirs one is used by Br\u00e1hmans, the second by non-Br\u00e1hman Hindus, and the third by Musalm\u00e1ns. The water is good and plentiful and is brought by an under-ground masonry channel from a spring about three-quarters of a mile to the west. The Kanheri gorge, on the hills between Khand\u00e1la and W\u00e1i, is a cattle track of little importance and leads from Kanheri in the north to Loh\u00e1ra and Bopardi in the south. The Kor\u00e1l gorge on the hills between W\u00e1i and Bhor is about ten miles north-west of W\u00e1i and leads from Asra in W\u00e1i to Titeghar in Bhor. During the rains the track across the gorge is impassable but in the fair season it is largely used by pack bullocks, chiefly carrying rice, gram, and grain. About twenty years ago the track was made by the public works department, but has now fallen into disrepair. The Mandap gorge, on the spur dividing the Krishna from the Kud\u00e1l valleys, is a short cut from Vi\u00e1jv\u00e1di in the north to Mhusva in the south. It is a pack-bullock track and is rarely used. The T\u00e1ygh\u00e1t is the old way from Chikli to Bhilar and other villages on the P\u00e1nchgani and Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau. Being steep and out of repair, it is little used. Laden cattle can pass with much difficulty. The track was formerly much used and bears marks of having been built and protected. It was chiefly used as the track for Mah\u00e1baleshvar and was improved by General Phayre. This and the \u00c1nvad pass are often talked of as Phayre's roads.\n\nJ\u00e1vli, which is much covered with hills, has numerous small passes and gorges. Few of them can be used by carts and not many of them by laden cattle. The eight most important are the B\u00e1mnoli, the Gogva, the K\u00e1nd\u00e1t, the Kud\u00e1l, the Mor, the North Tivra, the P\u00e1r, and the Radtod\u00ed. The B\u00e1mnoli road over the spur dividing the Yenna and Koyna rivers runs from Medha in the north to B\u00e1mnoli in the south. It joins the Koyna with the Yenna valleys and gives passage to the Konkan produce which is brought into the Koyna valley along numerous small gorges. The road runs about 4000 feet above sea level and is passable by pack bullocks for about eight months during the fair season. The gradient, though not bad, is too severe for carts and the path is hardly wide enough. It has lately been much improved and is yearly repaired from local funds. The Gogva road, also across the spur dividing the Koyna valley from the Yenna valley, runs from Medha to the village of Gogva on the Solshi which is a feeder of the Koyna and at Mah\u00e1baleshvar is known as the Blue Valley river. It is a fair bridle path with little traffic and severe gradients. The K\u00e1nd\u00e1t road which is a continuation of the B\u00e1mnoli road in the west is a fair bridle path. It winds for about fourteen miles along the K\u00e1nd\u00e1t valley, a feeder of the Koyna, and disappears over the main Sahy\u00e1dri range into the Konkan. The Kud\u00e1l road, over the spur dividing the Yenna valley from the Kud\u00e1l valley, is about fifteen miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and eighteen\nmiles east of Malcolmpeeth. Kud\u00e1l lies about six miles north-east of the gorge and Medha about a mile to the south. From Medha the road zigzags about two miles up the gorge, with a good gradient and comes down the Kud\u00e1l side by a fair gradient. It joins the Yenna valley with the Kud\u00e1l valley. From Kud\u00e1l the track runs east by a short cut to the Poona-Belgaum mail road, and from Medha it runs west to B\u00e1mnoli in the Koyna valley by the B\u00e1mnoli road, and from B\u00e1mnoli further west into the Konkan by the K\u00e1nd\u00e1t gorge. From Medha to Kud\u00e1l it is easily passable by laden carts, but from Kud\u00e1l to the Poona-Belgaum road the cart track is difficult and bad. The value of the yearly in and out traffic across the gorge is estimated at about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000), chiefly in grain, molasses, vegetables, and a small quantity of salt and dried fish. The road has no toll and is yearly repaired from local funds. Though the roadway has lately been much improved, better made roads carry off most of the heavier traffic. The Mor track is another short cut from the Yenna valley to Kud\u00e1l and the Poona-Belgaum mail road. It is a steep and rugged track, fit only for pack bullocks and foot passengers. It has little traffic and is not repaired. The North Tivra road over the main Sahy\u00e1dri range lies about ten miles south of the K\u00e1nd\u00e1t and twenty-five miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Though a mere pack-bullock track, the North Tivra carries a considerable traffic, chiefly grain, molasses, tobacco, chillies, and oil from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Ratn\u00e1giri, and rice, cocoanuts, spices, dates, and salt from Ratn\u00e1giri to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Most of this traffic finds its way direct to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by Kargaon and Parli over the B\u00e1mnoli-Dategad spur by a path formerly well known as the Usurla pass, and part goes north and north-east by B\u00e1mnoli and Medha to the Kud\u00e1l gorge. The value of the yearly traffic is estimated at about \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000). The track is in many parts rough and steep and is not repaired. It has no toll. The P\u00e1r and Radtodi passes, about two miles south of the FitzGerald pass on the main Sahy\u00e1dri range, are two parts of the track which leads from Malcolmpeeth to the Konkan by Pethp\u00e1r. Of this track the P\u00e1r is the lower part and the Radtodi the upper part. It has been superseded by the excellent FitzGerald pass road, and is now rarely used. It was formerly improved at a considerable cost, but it has now fallen into disrepair. It was always too steep for carts.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra has two gorges, the Bogda and the R\u00e1nzan. The Bogda lies close to the city of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the south between the old S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort and Yavteshwar. It is a short cut from the city to the Poona-Belgaum road in the south and also joins the city with the important village of Parli in the west and from Parli with the North Tivra pass on the main Sahy\u00e1dri range. The road across this gorge runs through a tunnel about 100 yards long. The tunnel was first designed in memory of Sh\u00e1hji of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1839-1848) and was afterwards in 1855 much improved by the Bombay Government at a cost of \u00a32900 (Rs. 29,000). The passage through the tunnel is in excellent order. The road for about a mile between the north end of the gorge and the city is repaired by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra municipality and for about three miles between the south end of the gorge and the Poona-Belgaum road it is repaired from local funds. Though carts occasionally find their way to Parli, the seven miles to Parli\nare safe only for laden cattle. The yearly in and out traffic is estimated at about \u00a37500 (Rs. 75,000). A toll in the gorge yields an average yearly revenue of about \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000). The R\u00e1nzan gorge, on the spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range which separates W\u00e1i and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from Koregaon, joins the village of Malgaon in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with the village of \u00c1mb\u00e1vda in Koregaon. It has little traffic and is not often used by carts though they can pass across the gorge.\n\nBesides the Harli, V\u00e1h\u00e1gaon, Ganesh, and R\u00e1nzan, which run into Koregaon from W\u00e1i and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the west, Koregaon has five gorges in the east, on the chief spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range which separates the central from the eastern belts of the district. Beginning from the north the five gorges are the Reda, Ganesh, N\u00e1gn\u00e1thv\u00e1di, Nh\u00e1vi, and \u00c1rvi. The Reda, about sixteen miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and fifteen miles north of Rahimatpur, is a mere footpath with little traffic, and joins the village of Bhadla in Koregaon with the village of Alj\u00e1pur in Phaltan. The Ganesh about six miles south of the Reda, joins the villages of Rui and Nh\u00e1vikhurd in Koregaon with the village of Ner in Khat\u00e1v. It is a little used cart track. The N\u00e1gn\u00e1thv\u00e1di, within a mile south of the Ganesh, joins the village of Borjaiv\u00e1di in Koregaon with L\u00e1lgun in Khat\u00e1v. It is a mere footpath with little traffic. The Nh\u00e1vi about ten miles south of the N\u00e1gn\u00e1thv\u00e1di, joins the village of Nh\u00e1vi-Budruk in Koregaon with the village of V\u00e1di in Khat\u00e1v. It is passable by carts, but has little traffic. This gorge is close to the Nh\u00e1vi made pass across the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road. The \u00c1rvi, about two miles south of the Nh\u00e1vi, is a mere footpath, joining the village of \u00c1rvi in Koregaon with the village of Kurla in the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-division belonging to the Akalkot state.\n\nIn P\u00e1tan two tracks run over small hill passes and gorges. Of these the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-P\u00e1tan track runs by the village of Saduv\u00e1gh\u00e1pur, about a mile north of P\u00e1tan, on the spur which divides the T\u00e1rli from the Kera. The track is passable by pack bullocks and foot passengers and is yearly repaired from local funds. The yearly in and out traffic is estimated at about \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) chiefly in betelnuts, cocoanuts, coriander, dates, groundnut, molasses, oil, turmeric, and salt. There is no toll. The hill track which runs west to Sangameshvar in Ratn\u00e1giri by the Mala pass or the main Sahy\u00e1di range, is about fifteen miles long from Dhenev\u00e1di and eight miles from Morg\u00edri. The track is fit for pack bullocks and carries a considerable traffic, chiefly in chillies, groundnut, myrobalans, oil, and tobacco from P\u00e1tan to Sangameshvar, and in betelnuts, cocoa-kernels, and dates from Ratn\u00e1giri to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nIn Kar\u00e1d the only hill track runs by N\u00e1ndl\u00e1pur in Kar\u00e1d to \u00c1rla in V\u00e1lva. It begins at N\u00e1ndl\u00e1pur about four miles south of Kar\u00e1d and runs by the villages of K\u00e1la, Nandgaon, Ond, Undala, Gayda, L\u00e1lgun, Ghogaon, and Yelgaon. At Yelgaon the track divides into two branches, one running to \u00c1rla by Yell\u00e1pur and Kasegaon, and the other by P\u00e1nchgani. From \u00c1rla in V\u00e1lva it runs into Ratn\u00e1giri by the Kundi and South Tivra passes. The track is fit for carts and pack bullocks within Kar\u00e1d limits. The yearly in and out traffic is estimated at about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) chiefly in wheat, gram, and jv\u00e1ri from Kar\u00e1d to Ratn\u00e1giri, and betelnuts, cocoanuts, rice, and salt from Ratn\u00e1giri to Kar\u00e1d. In V\u00e1lva the Shir\u00e1la-Devh\u00e1ra hill\ntrack, about twenty-seven miles long from Shir\u00e1la, runs along the V\u00e1rna river. From Devh\u00e1ra this track leads into Ratn\u00e1giri by the Kundi and South Tivra passes. For about fifteen miles from Shir\u00e1la the track is fit for carts, and for the rest of its length it is fit for pack-bullocks and foot passengers. The yearly in and out traffic is estimated at about \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) chiefly in wheat, gram, groundnuts, molasses, and tobacco from V\u00e1lva and betelnuts, cocoanuts, sugar, and salt from Ratn\u00e1giri into V\u00e1lva. The track has been much improved from local funds.\n\nIn the eastern belt beginning from the north, M\u00e1n has twenty small passes and gorges or khinds. Of these six are passable by carts, thirteen by pack-bullocks, and one by foot passengers. Besides the Ganesh, N\u00e1gn\u00e1thv\u00e1di and Nh\u00e1vi between Khat\u00e1v and Koregaon, and the Kukudv\u00e1d-Virli between Khat\u00e1v and M\u00e1n, Khat\u00e1v has five gorges within Khat\u00e1v limits, two of them fit for carts and three for foot-passengers. Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur has twenty-nine gorges, eighteen of them in the group of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur hills and eleven in the group of the Kurla hills. The T\u00e1sgaon sub-division, being mostly plain, has no notable gorges or khinds.\n\n1 The six cart tracks are wholly in the M\u00e1n sub-division. They are the Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed between Shingn\u00e1pur and Pimpri, the Dahiv\u00e1di-Nidhal between Shindi and Mahimangad, the K\u00e1tkarh\u00e1tav-Mhasvad between Naravana and Dh\u00e1nni, the Kothla between Thadda and Shingn\u00e1pur and Kothla, the Mhasvad-Varkuta-Malv\u00e1di between Palsavda and Varkuta-Malv\u00e1di, and the T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u00e1la between Pingli-Budruk and Pingli-Khurd. Of the thirteen pack-bullock tracks eleven are within M\u00e1n limits and two between M\u00e1n and Khat\u00e1v and M\u00e1n and \u00c1tp\u00e1di. The eleven within M\u00e1n limits are the Dahiv\u00e1di-Nidhal between Shindi and Mahimangad, the Gondavla-Kaldhon between Naravana and Vad\u00edjil, the Gondava-Tondla between V\u00e1ghmody\u00e1v\u00e1di-V\u00e1di and Keraksal, the Malv\u00e1di-R\u00e1japur between Malv\u00e1di and R\u00e1japur, the Malv\u00e1di-Vardhangad between Malv\u00e1di and Vardhangad, the Mhasvad-Inj\u00e1b\u00e1v between Khadki and Bhalv\u00e1di, the Mogr\u00e1la-Girvi between Mogr\u00e1la and Girvi, the Pimpri-Dh\u00e1nni between Pimpri and Dh\u00e1nni, the Sit\u00e1b\u00e1vi between Kulakj\u00e1vi and V\u00e1ghosh\u00edri, the Tondla between Tondla and Dhumalv\u00e1di, and the Virli-Kaldhon between Virli and Kaldhon. The other two are the Jambhul\u00ed-Shenv\u00e1di between Kalin in M\u00e1n and Limbuda in \u00c1tp\u00e1di, and the Kukudv\u00e1d-Virli between Valai in M\u00e1n and Pachvad in Khat\u00e1v. The one footpath is the Narvana Kukudv\u00e1d between Vadjal and Kirkol.\n\n2 The two cart tracks are J\u00e1ygaon about two miles from Aundh and Pingalj\u00e1i about five miles west of Vaduj between Tadavla and Pingli. The J\u00e1ygaon has little traffic, but the Pingalj\u00e1i is crossed by the T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u00e1la road and carries from Khat\u00e1v to Dahiv\u00e1di and Pandhur grain, chillies, and other field produce to the value of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000). The three footpaths are the Tadul-Khatval between the villages of Tadul and Khatval, the Pedgaon between the villages of Pedgaon and V\u00e1di, and the Umbarmal between the villages of Umbarmal and Vetna.\n\n3 The eighteen about the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur hills are B\u00e1lsingi between Balv\u00e1di and Valvan, the B\u00e1nur between B\u00e1nur and Pachegaon, the Bhivgh\u00e1t between Hirva and Karagani, the Chinch between Pachegaon and Kole-Karangi, the Dargoba between Ghoti-Budruk and Para, the Devi between Devi and Bhikvadi-Budruk, the Dhor\u00e1lv\u00e1di between Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and Lengra, the Hogaldara between Ghoti-Budruk and Padli, the Kacharv\u00e1di between Ghoti-Khurd and Padli, the Kurli between Kurli and Vita, the Menganv\u00e1di between Balv\u00e1di and Chinchali, the N\u00e1goba between Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and Morba, the Palsi between Banur and Palsi, the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t between Kararga and Net-Karangi, the Revangaon between Revangaon and Lingra, the Shimdev\u00e1di between Balv\u00e1di and Bhud, the Tukmal\u00ed between Balv\u00e1di and Kharsundi, and the V\u00e1samba between Renavi and V\u00e1samba. Of these eighteen gorges the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t alone is mostly passable by carts and the rest are used by pack bullocks and foot passengers. The eleven gorges about the Kurla hills are the Dh\u00e1k\u00e1i between Shelgaon and Kurla, the Ganesh between Chinchhi and Olith, the Hanmant between Taldi and Machindragad, the Kival between Shelgaon and Kival, the Nerli between Nerli and Tembu, the Pirachi between Asad and Retra-Harn\u00e1ksa, the Samudreshvar between Devr\u00e1shtra and Tapari, the Shenavli between Sonkira and Shenavli, the Vadgaon between Sansal and Vadgaon, the V\u00e1ghdara between Jadsar and Shirasaon, and V\u00e1gheri between Shelgaon and Nerviv\u00e1di. None of these gorges are passable by carts.\nOf the three systems of railways, the East Deccan or Hotgi-Gadag, the South Deccan or Bel\u00e1ri-Marmagaon, and the West Deccan or Poona-Londa which are being introduced into the Southern Mar\u00e1tha and K\u00e1narese districts of Bombay, the West Deccan or Poona-Londa by Miraj and Belgaum will directly affect S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The beginning of the Poona-Londa railways was sanctioned in December 1883. Of 275 miles, the total length from Poona to Londa, about forty-seven run south-east from Poona through the Poona district, 101 miles through the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district, twenty-one miles through the S\u00e1ngli and Mirj\u00ed states between S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Belgaum, and 106 miles through the Belgaum district. The 101 miles within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits pass south and south-east along almost the whole centre of the district through parts of W\u00e1i and Phaltan, the whole of Koregaon and Kar\u00e1d, and parts of V\u00e1lva and T\u00e1sgaon. The line enters S\u00e1t\u00e1ra at the Nira about forty-seven miles from Poona and leaves S\u00e1t\u00e1ra at the Yerla about 148 miles from Poona.\n\nIn the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra section of 101 miles ten third class stations are proposed, that is an average of one station for every ten miles of line. The ten stations will be Lonand at 52\u00bd miles from Poona, S\u00e1lpa 58 miles, V\u00e1t\u00e1r 68\u00bc miles, Padli 77\u00bc miles, Koregaon 84 miles, Rahimatpur 91\u00be miles, Masur 104\u00be miles, Kar\u00e1d Road 113\u00bd miles, Machundragad 125 miles, and Kundal within state limits at 135 miles. At S\u00e1lpa at fifty-eight miles the line will run through the S\u00e1lpa tunnel, which though difficult is not more than 500 feet long and is estimated to cost \u00a311,400 (Rs. 1,14,000). At Padli at 77\u00bc miles the line enters the rich and fertile valley of the Krishna, and for the remaining seventy-one miles of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra section it continues to run close to the Krishna, being never more than four miles from it. Consequently for about ninety-eight miles the line on the whole slowly falls from Padli till it crosses the Krishna in Belgaum at about 175 miles. To avoid the heavy outlay which would have been incurred by running the line along the western or right side of the Krishna, which would have necessitated the bridging of the Krishna and almost all its chief tributaries the Kud\u00e1li, Vena, Urmodi, T\u00e1rl\u00ed, Koyna, and V\u00e1rna, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra section will run along the eastern or left side of the Krishna, and the district head-quarter station of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the large town of Kar\u00e1d will consequently lie at some distance from the line. For the city of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the nearest station will be Koregaon at eighty-four miles from Poona and twelve miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; and for the town of Kar\u00e1d the nearest station will be Kar\u00e1d Road at 113\u00bd miles from Poona and four miles east of Kar\u00e1d. The line will have a ruling gradient of one in 100 and no curve with a smaller radius than 600 feet. The only large bridge on this section will be over the Yerla at 148 miles from Poona, with five spans of 100 feet girders and an estimated cost of \u00a316,700 (Rs. 1,67,000). Excellent stone and lime are available on the section. The average cost of the line between Poona and Belgaum is estimated at about \u00a39463 (Rs. 94,630) a mile, or a total expenditure within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits of about \u00a3955,763 (Rs. 95,57,630). The Poona-Londa line was begun in January 1884 and is expected to be finished in 1889. Beyond the district\n\n---\n\n1 The position of one or two of the stations is not yet finally fixed.\nwithin S\u00e1ngli and Miraj limits, the eleven miles of line from the Yerla in the extreme south of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra section to Miraj will have two stations at N\u00e1ndreh south of the Yerla at 148 miles and at Miraj at 159 miles, and a bridge across the T\u00e1sgaon river at 154 miles with three spans of 100 feet girders and an estimated cost of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000).\n\nOf the thirty toll bars seventeen are on Provincial and thirteen on local fund roads. Of the seventeen Provincial tolls six are on the Poona-Belgaum road at the Kh\u00e1makti pass in W\u00e1i, at the Nimb and Kodoli gorges with a subsidiary bar at the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra tunnel in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, at V\u00e1h\u00e1gaon and the Koyna bridge in Kar\u00e1d, and at the V\u00e1rna bridge near Kanegaoon in V\u00e1lva with a subsidiary bar at K\u00e1meri; two are on the Shol\u00e1pur-Mah\u00e1d road at the Varandha pass at Hirdoshi and Varandha; two are on the Surul-FitzGerald pass road at the Pasarni pass in W\u00e1i and at Kapde at the foot of the FitzGerald pass; two are on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Mah\u00e1baleshvar road near the Yenna bridge at Ankla in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and at Kelgad in J\u00e1lvi; three on the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road at the Kesha gorge at Sakurdi in Kar\u00e1d, at the Kera bridge in P\u00e1tan and at the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dris; and two are on the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road by N\u00e1gaj at the Surli gorge on the borders of Kar\u00e1d and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and at the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur gorge.

The tolls charged are for every four-wheeled carriage 1s. (8 as.), for every two-wheeled carriage drawn by one animal 3d. (2 as.), for every two-wheeled cart or carriage 6d. (4 as.) if drawn by two animals and laden and 3d. (2 as.) if unladen, 9d. (6 as.) if drawn by four animals and laden and 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) if unladen, 2s. (Re. 1) if drawn by eight animals or more and laden and 1s. (8 as.) if unladen, 2s. (Re. 1) for every elephant, \u00bed.

Except at the Koyna bridge at Kar\u00e1d where 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) is charged for every cart laden or unladen and at the S\u00e1lpa pass on the old Poona road and at the Triputi gorge, Vardhangad, the Gondavla gorge and Dhldev on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road, where 3d. (2 as.) instead of 6d. (4 as.) are charged, for every two-wheeled cart if drawn by two animals and laden, and 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) instead of 3d. (2 as.)\nif unladen, these fees are generally charged at almost all the tolls. In 1881-82 the tolls realized \u00a311,910 (Rs. 1,19,100), of which \u00a310,264 (Rs. 1,02,640) were for Provincial tolls and \u00a31646 (Rs. 16,460) for local fund tolls.\n\nOf the sixteen chief bridges seven are on the Poona-Belgaum road, across the Nira, Krishna, Yenna, Urmodi, T\u00e1rl\u00ed, Koyna, and V\u00e1rna.

During the hot season when the Bombay Government stops at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, letters are carried in pony carts between Surul on the Poona-Belgaum road and Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The post offices are supervised by the superintendent of post offices, Deccan division, who has a yearly salary of \u00a3240 (Rs. 2400).

Of the thirteen trade centres one is in W\u00e1i at W\u00e1i, one in J\u00e1vli at M\u00e1lcolmpeeth, one in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, one in Koregaon at Rahimatpur, one in P\u00e1tan at P\u00e1tan, three in Kar\u00e1d at Kar\u00e1d Ch\u00e1regao and Umbraj, one in V\u00e1lva at Isl\u00e1mpur, one in M\u00e1n at Mhasvad, one in Khat\u00e1v at Puses\u00e1vli, one in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur at V\u00edta, and one in T\u00e1sgaon at T\u00e1sgaon. W\u00e1i in W\u00e1i, on the Krishna, contains about 150 well-to-do traders, mostly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, S\u00e1lis, Koshtis, Telis, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Of these traders, the Br\u00e1hmans and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis are generally moneylenders. Except that the Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis buy from the growers\non cash payment raw sugar or *gul*, rice, turmeric, earthnuts and coriander seed and export them mostly in bullock carts to the port of Mah\u00e1d and to Poona, the chief trade consists in importing articles and selling them on cash payment in the town and neighbouring villages. From Bombay and Poona, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis import Bombay and English piecegoods and twist; from Chiplun, the V\u00e1nis import salt betelnuts dates and groceries; from Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the K\u00e1s\u00e1rs import copper and brass pots; from Nair or Malcolmpeeth, the Musalm\u00e1ns import potatoes and vegetables; and from Bavdh\u00e1n and Surul-Kavtha the S\u00e1lis and Koshtis import small quantities of women's robes or *lugdis*.

Of late, in consequence of the opening of good roads, the growers have begun to take their produce to the port of Mah\u00e1d and sell them to the Mah\u00e1d traders instead of passing them through the hands of the W\u00e1i traders.\n\nMalcolmpeeth in J\u00e1vli, the trade centre of the favourite health resort of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, has independent and well-to-do traders, mostly M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, P\u00e1rsis, Christians, and Musalm\u00e1ns. During the fair season, especially in April and May and again in October and November, Malcolmpeeth is the centre of much traffic and trade. The traders bring rice from the neighbouring villages, and sugar, salt, coconuts, groceries, spirits and wines from Mah\u00e1d, Poona, and Bombay. Excellent potatoes are grown on the hill.

Coarse sugar, earthnuts, chillies, and turmeric are bought from the growers by Br\u00e1hmans and local and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis and sent to Poona, Chiplun, and Mah\u00e1d. Of late years there has been little change in the amount or character of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra trade. Rahimatpur in Koregaon contains about 155 independent and well-to-do traders. They are chiefly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, Shimpis, Sangars, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, Jains, Koshtis, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns.

All of these articles are sold on cash payment. The Musalm\u00e1ns, Sangars, and Koshtis buy twist from the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis which the Musalm\u00e1ns weave into turbans and the Sangars and Koshtis into waistcloths, women's robes or *lugdis*, cotton sheets or *p\u00e1sodis*, and other hand-made piecegoods. These articles are partly sold in the town, and the rest are taken to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Chiplun where they are sold to local traders. P\u00e1tan, at the meeting of the Koyna and Kera on the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road, has about twenty traders, mostly\nBr\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1nis, and Shimpis.

The V\u00e1nis and Telis buy from the growers for cash and send to Chiplun raw sugar or gul, turmeric, chillies, earthnuts, tobacco, and oil, and in exchange bring salt, cocoanuts, dates, spices, and groceries. These imported articles are sold in the town and neighbouring villages. The S\u00e1lis and Musalm\u00e1ns bring twist from Bombay which they weave into turbans, waistcloths, and other hand-made piecegoods. The Koshtis weave p\u00e1sd\u00eds or cotton sheets. These hand-made piecegoods are sold to the people on the spot. Ch\u00e1regaon, in Kar\u00e1d on the river M\u00e1nd on the Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur road, has Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1ni and Teli traders. Since the opening of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass on the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road the Ch\u00e1regaon traders have prospered. They buy from the growers for cash, sesame, earthnut, safflower, and other oil seeds which they press into oil and send in large quantities to Chiplun in exchange for salt and groceries. Umbraj, in Kar\u00e1d at the meeting of the Krishna T\u00e1rl\u00ed and M\u00e1nd on the Poona-Belgaum road, has about twenty-five traders, mostly Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, and Shimpis.

The traders send to Chiplun large quantities of tobacco and raw sugar or gul, and in exchange bring salt, dates, betelnuts, groceries, spices, English and country piecegoods, and metals which they sell at Isl\u00e1mpur and the neighbouring villages. Besides Isl\u00e1mpur, the large village of Shir\u00e1la in V\u00e1lva is famous for its brass lamps or samais which the K\u00e1s\u00e1rs send to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Shol\u00e1pur, and Poona. Mhasvad in M\u00e1n, on the M\u00e1n river on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road, has about sixty independent traders, mostly Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Shimpis, Jains, and Sangars.

The Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur village of Lingra grows g\u00e1nja or smoking hemp, enough to meet the demand of the whole district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. T\u00e1sgaon has about 150 traders, with capitals varying from \u00a310 to \u00a310,000 (Rs. 100 - Rs. 1,00,000), mostly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, Jains, Telis, and Musalm\u00e1ns.

As there are no steam presses, cotton, which is the chief article of export, is loosely packed and loses much in quantity and quality.\n\nThirty-four weekly and half-weekly markets are held, twelve on Mondays, three on Tuesdays, four on Wednesdays, six on Thursdays, two on Fridays, five on Saturdays, and two on Sundays, in twenty-three villages and towns. One is in W\u00e1i at W\u00e1i on Mondays and Tuesdays; two in J\u00e1vl\u00ed, at Medha on Mondays and at Malcolmpeith on every day in the week during the fair season; two in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra on Mondays Thursdays and Saturdays, and at Parli on Mondays; two in Koregaon, at Rahimatpur on Thursdays and Fridays, and at Kumta on Mondays; four in P\u00e1tan, at P\u00e1tan on Mondays, at T\u00e1rla on Saturdays, at Morgiri on Thursdays, and at Dhembev\u00e1di on Tuesdays; five in Kar\u00e1d, at Kar\u00e1d on Sundays and Thursdays, at Vadgaon on Mondays, at Umbraj on Mondays, at Ch\u00e1regaon on Saturdays, and at Belvade on Wednesdays; two in V\u00e1lva, at Isl\u00e1mpur on Saturdays and at Shir\u00e1la on Mondays; one in T\u00e1sgaon, at T\u00e1sgaon on Mondays and Thursdays; one in\nKh\u00e1n\u00e1pur at Vita on Mondays; one in Khat\u00e1v at Puses\u00e1vli on Wednesdays; and two in M\u00e1n, at Dahivadi on Mondays and at Mhasvad on Wednesdays.

Besides peddlers and hawkers who set up booths on the market days and sometimes husbandmen offering their field produce, grain, pulse, raw sugar, fruit, and vegetables, the sellers are shopkeepers and traders generally belonging to the market town. Except where fruit and vegetables are brought early in the morning, these markets fill about two in the afternoon and go on till six. Barter is almost unknown; all sales are by cash payments. Of late years there has been little change in the numbers who attend the markets.\n\nFairs, lasting one to thirty days, with an attendance of 500 to 50,000 people and with a trade worth \u00a312 to \u00a33000 (Rs.120 - Rs.30,000), are held at eighteen places, two in W\u00e1i, two in J\u00e1vli, one in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, two in Koregaon, two in Kar\u00e1d, two in P\u00e1tan, two in V\u00e1lva, one in T\u00e1sgaon, one in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, one in Khat\u00e1v, and two in M\u00e1n. Of these eighteen fairs, two are attended by 50,000, two by 20,000, one by 15,000, eight by 5000 to 8000, and five by 500 to 4000 people. The details are:\n\n| PLACE | Month | Days | Sales | People |\n|-------|-------|------|-------|--------|\n| W\u00e1i   | April | 15   | 25    | 3000   |\n| Ozardi | January | 1   | 60    | 3000   |\n| Mandharderav | | | | |\n| Jevli | March | 1   | 70    | 7000   |\n| Morini | April | 1   | 150   | 4000   |\n| Kud\u00e1l | April | 1   | 150   | 4000   |\n| S\u00e1t\u00e1ra | | | | |\n| Parli | February | 1   | 12    | 6000   |\n| Koregaon | | | | |\n| Rahimatpur | December | 30  | 50    | 8000   |\n| Padali | April | 30  | 35    | 2000   |\n| Kardd | | | | |\n| Pal | January | 5   | 800   | 60,000 |\n| Kole | February | 1   | 300   | 5000   |\n\nThese fairs differ little from the weekly markets, except that they are attended by unusually large numbers. They are chiefly distributing centres. The sellers are generally shopkeepers and traders of the town and neighbouring places, mostly M\u00e1rv\u00e1r Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Halv\u00e1is, T\u00e1bats, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, Sbimpis, S\u00e1lis, Koshtis, Sangars, Att\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Except at Mhasvad where the chief trade consists in selling cows, bulls, buffaloes, ponies, and sheep by Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and Musalm\u00e1ns, the articles sold at these fairs are: By the V\u00e1nis, dates,\ncocoanuts, betelnuts, raw sugar, sugar, spices and groceries; by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, S\u00e1lis, Shimpis and Koshhtis, English and country piecegoods, women's robes, cotton sheets, waistcloths and bodice-cloths; by the T\u00e1mbats copper and brass pots; by the K\u00e1s\u00e1rs copper and brass pots and glass bangles; by the Halv\u00e1is, sweetmeats, parched rice, and pulse; by the Att\u00e1rs, perfumes and fragrant essences; and by the Sangars, blankets, coarse cloth or padam, sacking, and felt or burnus. The buyers are almost all consumers who buy for immediate use.\n\nShopkeepers are found in almost all villages except in the smallest. Village shopkeepers are generally Gujar\u00e1t or Lingayat V\u00e1nis. They deal in all kinds of grain, salt, oil, sugar, raw sugar, spices, and groceries, and buy their stock at the nearest trade centre. The shopkeeper is generally a distributer, except that being often a moneylender he generally supplies his stock of grain from the husbandmen to whom he has advanced money. Except landholders who, having their own stock of grain, buy only sugar, spices, groceries and oil, most of the villagers depend upon the shopkeeper for almost all their supplies. A few buy on cash payment, but most of the villagers have an account with the shopkeeper. Barter is almost unknown.\n\nBelow the village shopkeepers are the peddlers and hawkers who are generally M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and local V\u00e1nis, Telis, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and Shimpis. These men travel from village to village during the six or eight months of the fair season. Spices, groceries, pearls, looking glasses, locks, and other articles are sold by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and local V\u00e1nis, who generally go about with a pony; glass bangles, copper and brass pots are sold by K\u00e1s\u00e1rs who travel with a bullock or a packman; cloth by Shimpis who generally themselves carry the pack; and oil by Telis. Except the Telis who generally, and the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris who rarely, sell their articles to husbandmen in exchange for grain, almost all these peddlers and hawkers sell on cash payment.\n\nThe Lam\u00e1ns, a wandering tribe and the professional carriers of the district, used to carry on pack-bullocks to the coast and to Poona and other centres, cotton, molasses, chillies, tobacco, and other articles of export, and bring salt, grain, spices, and groceries. Since the opening of the cart roads to the Konkan by the Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed pass in 1864 and the FitzGerald pass in 1876, these Lam\u00e1ns have almost disappeared, and exports are carried to Chiplun and Mah\u00e1d by traders in hired, and by husbandmen in their own bullock carts. The Hedes, a class of Vanj\u00e1ris, buy cows, bulls, and other live-stock at Jath, Bij\u00e1pur, and B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t, and sell them in the fair season from village to village for cash.\n\nOf Imports the chief articles are: Of building materials, Malab\u00e1r timber is imported from Poona Bombay and Chiplun by Gujar\u00e1t and local V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, and sometimes also directly by rich house-builders. Timber generally passes through three hands and is used by house-builders carpenters and turners for making beams, girders, planks, doors, shelves, wheels, and chairs. K\u00e1thya or cocoafibre rope is brought by Gujar\u00e1t and local V\u00e1nis from Chiplun, Mah\u00e1d, Poona, and Bombay, and passes through three\nhands. Iron bars, sheets, hinges, and screws are brought from Bombay Poona and Chiplun by Gujar\u00e1t and local V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis and Musalm\u00e1ns, and pass through three hands. Iron bars are made into cart tires, axes, and hatches. As the demand for iron has increased and as the Dhavads of J\u00e1vli and P\u00e1tan have ceased to smelt iron the import of iron has of late increased. Glass-panes used for windows, looking glasses, and lanterns are brought from Poona and Bombay by Bohor\u00e1s and bought by the public works department and the rich. Of house furniture, copper brass and iron sheets are brought from Poona and Bombay by Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis and Musalm\u00e1ns, from whom the local T\u00e1mbats and K\u00e1s\u00e1rs buy and make them into cooking and water pots tapelis, gh\u00e1gars, p\u00e1telis, gh\u00e1ng\u00e1ls, frying-pans, and other vessels. Besides the raw metal sheets, Son\u00e1rs, T\u00e1mbats, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and Telis bring from N\u00e1sik, Poona, Miraj, and S\u00e1ngli ready made cooking pots, gadves or jugs, fulp\u00e1tras or cups with a thick rim, peles or cups on a stand, dishes or tabaks, and attard\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b and gul\u00e1bd\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b or rose-vessels, excellent articles but costly and therefore not in much demand. Carpets, watches, clocks, paintings, chandeliers, and hanging lamps are brought from Bombay and Poona by Bohor\u00e1s and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis for the use of the rich and well-to-do. Of food drink and drugs, salt, cocoanuts, dates, groceries, and spices are brought by local and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis from Bombay, Poona, Chiplun, and Mah\u00e1d. Drugs are chiefly imported by Government dispensaries at the expense of local funds. Of tools and appliances, the Bohor\u00e1s import hammers, anvils, saws, files, razors, knives, scissors, augers, adzes, and chisels from Bombay and Poona. Of articles of dress including ornaments and toys, English and Bombay piecegoods, twist, shawls, silk waistcloths and robes are brought from Bombay and Poona by M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, Br\u00e1hmans, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Twist is bought by S\u00e1l\u00eds and Koshhtis who weave it into hand-made piecegoods. Pearls are brought by Panj\u00e1b\u00eds and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis from Poona and Bombay, and sold to the rich. K\u00e1t\u00e1ris bring from Gok\u00e1k wooden toys, cleverly coloured representations of vegetables and fruit. These toys are bought by the rich and well-to-do to be laid before the goddess Gauri on a day sacred to her in Chaitra or March-April. Gold and silver are brought by M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis and sold to the rich to make ornaments for their women and children.\n\nThe chief Exports are molasses, grain, earthnuts, turmeric, chillies, cotton, timber, and cloth. Since the opening of bridged and well made roads molasses, the chief export of the district, has of late come into increasing demand, and the cultivation of sugarcane has greatly spread. Millet, wheat, chillies, turmeric, and tobacco are sent to Bombay by Chiplun, chiefly from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, and V\u00e1lva, by the local and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis who get these articles from the Kunbi husbandmen either in payment of debts or on cash payment. Cotton is sent from V\u00e1lva and T\u00e1sgaon in bullock carts to Chiplun by Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis who buy unginned cotton from the husbandmen, have it cleared by hand-machines, and pack it in bales, each weighing about 250 pounds (10 mans). As there is less local demand owing to the growing import of European and Bombay piecegoods\nthe growing of cotton has lately fallen off. Teak is sent from J\u00e1vli and P\u00e1tan to Chiplun and other parts by timber-dealers, who buy at departmental sales and fell yearly a certain number of teak trees mostly in Government forests. Coarse cloth, cotton sheets or pasodis, and blankets are chiefly sent to other districts.\n\nThe chief S\u00e1t\u00e1ra crafts are the making of gold and silver ornaments, copper and brass pots and iron tools, stone-cutting, pottery, carpentry, cotton-weaving, dyeing, blanket-weaving, tanning, and shoe-making. Gold and silver workers or Son\u00e1rs are found in almost all towns and large villages. Besides working in gold and silver, a few Son\u00e1rs in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1sgaon, and other large towns are well known for their skill in stone-setting. Except a few who out of their savings buy gold and silver in small quantities and keep a small stock of ornaments for sale in their shops and sometimes at fairs, goldsmiths are not, as a rule, men of capital. People who want ornaments generally buy their gold and silver and give it to the Son\u00e1rs to work into ornaments, paying them Is. 6d. to 2s. (Re. \u00bc - 1) the tola for gold. A few Son\u00e1rs who have a large number of customers employ workmen. The tools used for heating melting and hammering the metal are the blow-pipe, iron tongs for turning the coals, a hammer, an anvil, and the draw-plates called g\u00e1vi and jambh\u00e1chi patti for making gold wire and thread. Son\u00e1rs make gold and silver bangles, armlets, wristlets, necklaces, rings, nose-rings, and anklets, and articles for holding betelnuts betel leaves and other dishes. Son\u00e1rs work from morning to evening and keep twelve holidays during the year. Their work is steady throughout the year and is brisk during the marriage season. The women and children do not help the men in their work. Son\u00e1rs earn \u00a35 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 50-1000) a year. They are a fairly well-to-do class and have no trade organization.\n\nT\u00e1batts and K\u00e1s\u00e1rs or copper and brass smiths are found in almost all towns. Copper and brass pot-making is one of the chief local industries. The metal is brought from Bombay and Poona in sheets and cut into pieces of a suitable size. Except a few men of capital, coppersmiths generally borrow money and invest it in their craft. Of the brassware of the district the best known articles are the brass lamps which are made at Shir\u00e1la in V\u00e1lva. The articles are sold in shops and at fairs, and are also sent to Bombay and Poona. Coppersmiths also tin copper and brass pots at \u00bdd. to 1\u00bdd. (\u00bc to \u00be a.) the pot. They make a stock of vessels during the rains, and during the fair season move from place to place with them. They work from morning to evening and keep all important Hindu holidays. Their women help in blowing the bellows and tinning pots. Their average yearly earnings are \u00a35 to \u00a350 (Rs. 50-500). In ordinary years they are fairly off. They have no trade organization.\n\nBlacksmiths or Loh\u00e1rs, chiefly Hindus and a few Musalm\u00e1ns, are found in almost all towns and large villages. The husbandmen are the Loh\u00e1rs' chief customers. They generally have capital enough to lay in the small store of iron they require to meet the wants of\ntheir craft. They seldom have workmen under them. The blacksmiths, who make and repair cooking vessels and field tools, have enough work throughout the year. During the rains they make nails, pans, and buckets. Their busiest time is at the close of the fair season when the husbandmen are most in want of field tools. Loh\u00e1rs work ten to twelve hours a day. Musalm\u00e1n Loh\u00e1rs keep the usual Musalm\u00e1n holidays and Hindu Loh\u00e1rs keep the chief Hindu holidays. Their women help in blowing the bellows and in the lighter parts of the work. Their yearly earnings vary from \u00a36 to \u00a315 (Rs. 60-150). Besides the Loh\u00e1rs, Gh\u00edsad\u00eds or tinkers are a class of wandering iron-workers. They are less skilful, but much cheaper workmen than the Loh\u00e1rs. Except during the rains when they settle at one place, they move from village to village buying old iron and making and selling new articles.\n\nStonecutters called P\u00e1thavrats or Beld\u00e1rs, Hindus and a few Musalm\u00e1ns, work wherever they find employment. They are paid 14s. to 16s. (Rs. 7-8) a month, to hew and shape stones for house building. If public works or other special demand for masons arises the strength of the local Beld\u00e1rs is increased by wandering families from other parts of the country. Except during the rains when they are generally idle, stonecutters have constant and well-paid employment. The want of work during the rains, and the fact that their women add nothing to the family earnings keep them poor. Another class of stone masons are the Gavand\u00eds. The Gavandi does finer work than the Beld\u00e1r, and often acts as an architect for houses and wells. Some are so highly esteemed for their designing faculties that they are sent for all over the district.\n\nPottery is made in all towns and large villages. The workers are Kumbh\u00e1rs who are one of the twelve bal\u00fat\u00e1s or village servants. The clay of which tiles, bricks, earthen pots, and human and animal figures are made, is dug either from fields, from river beds, or from old village sites. It is mixed with stable refuse and is trodden by men for five or six hours. The kneaded clay is then formed into balls and turned on a wheel into pots of various shapes. The pots are laid in the sun, and when slightly dry are taken and gently hammered with a small flat piece of wood. The pots are then burnt in a kiln. When the ashes have cooled the pots are taken out of the kiln and sold in market towns and at the potters' houses at prices varying from \u00bdd. to 1s. (\u00bc - 8 as.). Khumbh\u00e1rs require little capital. They generally work from morning to evening throughout the year except when rain stops them. They keep the leading Hindu holidays, and are greatly helped by their women. Of late years their craft has undergone little change.\n\nSut\u00e1rs or carpenters, either Hindus or Musalm\u00e1ns, are found in almost all towns and large villages. The carpenters are chiefly employed from morning to evening in making the woodwork of houses and in making carts and other field tools. They are supplied with the raw material, chiefly b\u00e1bhul and j\u00e1mbhul wood which grow all over the district, and teak which is found in J\u00e1vli, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, P\u00e1tan, and V\u00e1lva. Their work is steady in large towns but dull in villages. They keep all important holidays. Their yearly earnings vary\nfrom \u00a37 10s. to \u00a312 (Rs. 75 - 120). Of late years their craft has undergone little change.\n\nCotton Weaving is carried on in almost all towns and large villages by Khatris, Koshtis, and S\u00e1lis among Hindus, and by Momins among Musalm\u00e1ns. The cotton yarn for the rougher cloth is brought by M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris from T\u00e1sgaon, Jath, and Athni; the finer yarn for women\u2019s robes or lugdis generally comes from Bombay. A few have capital and employ labourers, but most borrow money from Gujars and M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris to buy the yarn and pay for it by the articles they weave. Khatris, Koshtis, and S\u00e1lis weave the coarse cloth, waistcloths, women\u2019s robes, and cotton sheets which are worn by all classes, and Momins weave the cheap turbans which are worn by the poorer Kunbis. Though the weavers have work throughout the year, their earnings hardly support them, so keen is the competition of steam-made Bombay and English piecegoods. The weavers work from morning to evening, taking about two hours\u2019 rest at noon. They keep twelve holidays in the year. They are helped by their women in the lighter parts of their work, and earn \u00a36 to \u00a315 (Rs. 60 - 150) a year.\n\nDyers or Rang\u00e1ris, both Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, are found in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, T\u00e1sgaon, W\u00e1i, Rahimatpur, and other large towns. The craft is important as almost all classes of the people wear dyed head-dresses. The chief colours are scarlet, crimson, and blue. Scarlet or kusumba is made from mixing turmeric with p\u00e1padkh\u00e1r or soda lime and the powder of dried kardai or safflower. All the articles required for making scarlet are found in the district. The crimson is made from crimson powder brought from Europe. Dyers do not require much capital. Their work varies with the general prosperity of the people. In ordinary years it is briskest during the wedding season and about the Dasara and Div\u00e1li holidays in September-October. They work six to eight hours a day. The Hindu workers keep the usual Hindu holidays and the Musalm\u00e1n workers the usual Musalm\u00e1n holidays. Their women help them in drying the dyed clothes. They earn little more than a maintenance.\n\nBlanket Weavers or Sangars are found all over the district. Blanket weaving is of most importance to the poor as it supplies cheap and warm clothing. The Sangars are poor and have no capital. To buy wool from the Dhangars they have to borrow. The whole work of blanket-weaving is done by the Sangar\u2019s family without employing outside labour. The wool which is brought in bundles from the Dhangars is first soaked in tamarind-stone water, dried in the open air, and combed. After a second soaking drying and combing, the thread is fit to be taken to the loom. The tools used in weaving the blankets are the y\u00e1v a piece of wood with a pointed end about three feet long and six inches round; the otkul a long piece of wood about four feet long and one inch broad; and the niri a long piece of wood with an indented side. The Sangars have steady work throughout the year, and are busiest in October and November when the sheep are shorn. They work eight to ten hours a day and keep twelve holidays. Their women help them in\nsoaking and drying the thread and in almost all other parts of the work except weaving. Sangars, who earn \u00a35 to \u00a320 (Rs. 50 - 200) a year, sell their blankets mostly to the lower classes at home, in markets and at fairs, at prices varying from 1s. 6d. to 6s. (Rs. \u00bc - 3) the blanket. They are a poor class.\n\nOf the two branches of leather-working tanning was formerly carried on by Dhors and shoe-making by Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs. Of late as the price of tanned leather has greatly risen, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs have also taken to tanning. Dhors and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs are found in almost all towns and large villages. The Dhors, who flay the dead bodies of animals, dry and tan the hides and sell them to Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs or hide-dealers. In making shoes, water-buckets, and water-bags, an employment to which they have only lately taken, Dhors show less skill than Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs. Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs buy the hides from the Dhors and tan them at home. The tanning is done by steeping the hide two or three days in water, by washing it, and soaking it in lime water for nearly fifteen days. The hide is taken out and the hair scraped with the rando or iron knife. It is soaked in a liquid mixture of hirda or myrobalan and b\u00e1bhul bark, and is then fit for use. The articles made by Dhors and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs are shoes, water-buckets, water-bags, leather thongs and ropes, and chapl\u00fas or sandals. These are sold in all markets and fairs, a pair of shoes fetching 1s. 3d. to 4s. (Rs. \u00bc - 2). Leather working requires little capital, and labour is seldom employed. The Dhors and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs have steady employment throughout the year, except during the rains when work is dull. They work eight to ten hours a day and keep the leading Hindu holidays. Their women help in sewing silk borders to shoes and in other light work. Dhors and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs earn \u00a37 10s. to \u00a310 (Rs. 75 - 100) a year. In ordinary years they are fairly off. Besides Dhors and Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, Moch\u00eds make English boots and shoes in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Kar\u00e1d, and other large towns.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThree inscriptions of about 200 B.C., recording gifts of pillars by Kar\u00e1d pilgrims at the Bharhut Stupa near Jabalpur in the Central Provinces, show that Kar\u00e1d or as the inscriptions call it Karah\u00e1kada about fifteen miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is probably the oldest place in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district.\u00b9 That the place named is the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Kar\u00e1d is confirmed by a group of sixty-three early Buddhist caves about three miles south-west of Kar\u00e1d one of which has an inscription of about the first century after Christ.\u00b2 Caves also at Shirval in the extreme north-west of the district and at the holy town of W\u00e1i in J\u00e1vli show that they were old Buddhist settlements.\u00b3\n\nFrom very early times trade routes must have passed by the Varandha and Kumbh\u00e1rli passes to the Konkan seaports of Mah\u00e1d D\u00e1bhol and Chiplun. Much holiness attaches to Mah\u00e1baleshvar at the source of the Krishna river about thirty miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\u2074 No early inscriptions giving the names of kings have been found in the district. But it seems probable that as in the rest of the Bombay Deccan and Konkan the \u00c1ndhrabhritya or Sh\u00e1takarni kings (B.C. 90 - A.D. 300) and probably its Kolh\u00e1pur branch held S\u00e1t\u00e1ra till the third or fourth century after Christ. For the 900 years ending early in the fourteenth century with the Musalm\u00e1n overthrow of the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs no historical information regarding S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is available and the Devn\u00e1gari and K\u00e1narese inscriptions which have been found on old temples have not yet been translated. Still as inscribed stones and copperplates have been found in the neighbouring districts of Ratn\u00e1giri and Belgaum and the state of Kolh\u00e1pur, it is probable that the Early and Western Ch\u00e1lukyas held the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district from about 550 to 760; the R\u00e1shtr\u00e1kutas to 973; the Western Ch\u00e1lukyas and under them to about 1180 by the Kolh\u00e1pur Sil\u00e1har\u00e1s (1050-1220); and the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs till the Musalm\u00e1n conquest of the Deccan about 1300.\n\nThe first Musalm\u00e1n invasion of the Deccan took place in 1294,\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham's Stupa of Bharhut, 135, 136, 139.

From 1318 Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shta began to be ruled by governors appointed from Delhi and stationed at Devgiri. In 1338 the Delhi emperor Muhammed Tughlik (1325-1351) made Devgiri his capital and changed its name to Daulatabad or the Abode of Wealth. In 1341 Musalm\u00e1n exactions caused a general revolt in the Deccan, which, according to Ferishta, was so successful that in 1344 Muhammed had no part of his Deccan territories left him except Daulatabad. In 1346 there was widespread disorder, and the Delhi officers plundered and wasted the country. These cruelties led to the revolt of the Deccan nobles under the able leadership of an Afgh\u00e1n soldier named Hasan Gangu. The nobles were successful, and freed the Deccan from dependence on Northern India.\n\nHasan founded\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, I. 304. In 1294 R\u00e1md\u00e9v the ruling king of Devgiri or Devgad was surprised in his capital by Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji the nephew of the Delhi emperor Jal\u00e1l-ud-din Khilji, and forced to pay tribute. In 1297, R\u00e1md\u00e9v gave shelter to R\u00e1\u00ed Karan the refugee king of Gujar\u00e1t, and neglected to pay tribute for three years (Ditto, I. 365). In 1306 Malik K\u00e1fur Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's general reduced the greater part of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shta, distributed it among his officers, and confirmed R\u00e1md\u00e9v in his allegiance (Ditto, I. 369). In 1309, Malik K\u00e1fur, on his way to Telengan was received with great hospitality at Devgad by R\u00e1md\u00e9v (Ditto, I. 371). In 1310 as R\u00e1md\u00e9v was succeeded by his son Shankardev who was not well affected to the Musalm\u00e1ns, Malik K\u00e1fur on his way to the Karn\u00e1tak left a force at the town of l'aithan on the left bank of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri to overawe the Y\u00e1davs (Ditto, I. 373). In 1312 Malik K\u00e1fur marched a fourth time into the Deccan, seized and put Shankardev to death, wasted Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shta, and fixed his residence at Devgad (Ditto, I. 379), where he remained till Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn in his last illness ordered him to Delhi. During Malik K\u00e1fur's absence at Delhi, Harp\u00e1ld\u00e9v the son-in-law of R\u00e1md\u00e9v stirred the Deccan to arms, drove out many Musalm\u00e1n garrisons, and with the aid of the other Deccan chiefs recovered Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shta. In 1318 Mub\u00e1rik Khilji, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's son and successor, marched to the Deccan to chastise Harp\u00e1ld\u00e9v who fled at the approach of the Musalm\u00e1ns, and was pursued, seized, and flayed alive. Mub\u00e1rik appointed Malik Beg Laki, one of his father's slaves, to command in the Deccan, and returned to Delhi (Ditto, I. 389).\n\n2 Briggs' Ferishta, I. 426-427. This statement seems exaggerated. In 1346 there were Musalm\u00e1n governors at R\u00e1\u00edchur, Mudg\u00e1l, Kulbarga, Bedar, Bij\u00e1pur, Ganjauti, R\u00e1ib\u00e1g, Gilh\u00e1ri, Hukeri, and Ber\u00e1r.

He farmed a small plot of land belonging to a Br\u00e1hman astrologer named Gangu who was in favour with the king of Delhi. Having accidentally found a treasure in his field, Hasan had the honesty to give notice of it to his landlord. The astrologer was so struck with his integrity that he exerted his influence at court to advance Hasan's fortunes. Hasan thus rose to a great station in the Deccan, where his merit marked him out among his equals as their leader in their revolt. He assumed the name of Gangu in gratitude to his benefactor, and from a similar motive added that of Bahmani or Br\u00e1hmani by which his dynasty was afterwards distinguished. Elphinstone's History of India, 666. The Bahmani dynasty consisted of the following eighteen kings, who were supreme for nearly 150 years (1347-1490) and continued in power for about thirty years more:\n\nThe Bahmanis, 1347-1526.\n\n| Name                  | Date     | Name                  | Date     |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Hasan Gangu | 1347-1358| Humayun              | 1457-1461|\n| Muhammed I.           | 1358-1373| Nilz\u00e1m               | 1461-1463|\n| Muj\u00e1hid               | 1375-1378| Muhammed II.          | 1463-1482|\n| D\u00e1\u00fad                  | 1378      | Mahm\u00fad II.            | 1482-1518|\n| Mahm\u00fad I.             | 1378-1397 |                    |          |\n| Gh\u00e1\u00ed\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn         | 1397      | Nominal Kings         |          |\n| Shams-ud-d\u00edn          | 1397      | Ahmad II.             | 1519-1530|\n| F\u00edruz                 | 1397-1429 | Ak\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn III.       | 1520-1522|\n| Ahmad I.              | 1429-1432 | Vall                 | 1522-1526|\n| Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn II.        | 1435-1457 | Kalim                | 1529     |\n\nB 1282-29\na dynasty, which in honour of his patron a Br\u00e1hman he called Bahmani, and which held the command of the Deccan for nearly 150 years. The Bahmani capital was first fixed at Kulbarga about 180 miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and in 1426 was removed to Bedar or Ahmadabad-Bedar about 100 miles further east. By 1351 Al\u00e1-ud-din Hasan Gangu Bahmani, by treating the local chiefs and authorities in a liberal and friendly spirit, had brought under his power every part of the Deccan which had previously been subject to the throne of Delhi. In 1357, Al\u00e1-ud-din divided his kingdom into four provinces or tarafs, over each of which he set a provincial governor or tarafdar. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra formed part of the provinces of Kulbarga which extended from Kulbarga as far west as D\u00e1bhol and south as far as R\u00e1ichur and Mudgal in the Nizam's territory. Al\u00e1-ud-din apparently had control over the whole of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, except the hilly west which with the Konkan was not reduced till a century later. In the later part of the fourteenth century, under the excellent rule of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Bahmani (1358-1375) the banditti which for ages had harassed the trade of the Deccan were broken and scattered, and the people enjoyed peace and good government. This period of prosperity, when the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and many other forts were probably built, was followed by the awful calamity of the Durga Devi famine, when the country is said to have been reduced to a desert by twelve rainless years (1396-1407). In the first years of the famine M\u00e1hmut Sh\u00e1h Bahmani (1378-1397) is said to have kept ten thousand bullocks to bring grain from Gujar\u00e1t to the Deccan, and to have founded seven orphan schools in the leading towns in his dominions.\n\nNo efforts of any rulers could preserve order or life through so long a series of fatal years. Whole districts were left without people, and the strong places fell from the Musalm\u00e1ns into the hands of local chiefs. Before the country could recover it was again wasted by two rainless years in 1421 and 1422. Multitudes of cattle died and the people broke into revolt. In 1429 Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r the governor of Daulatabad, with the hereditary officers or deshmukhs, went through the country restoring order. Their first operations were against some R\u00e1moshis in Khat\u00e1v Desh and a body of banditti that infested the Mah\u00e1dev hills. The army next marched to W\u00e1i and reduced several forts. So entirely had the country fallen waste that the old villages had disappeared and fresh villages had to be formed, which generally included the lands of two or three old villages. Lands were given to all who would till them, free of rent for the first year and for a horse-bag of grain for the second year. This settlement was entrusted to D\u00e1du Narasu K\u00e1le, an experienced Br\u00e1hman, and to a Turkish eunuch of the court. In 1453 Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r, who was ordered to reduce the sea coast or Konkan forts, fixed his head-quarters at Ch\u00e1kan, a small fort eighteen miles north of Poona, and, after reducing several chiefs, laid siege to a fort.\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 291-292; Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 25.\n2 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 325-326.\n3 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 349-350. These seven towns were Cheul, D\u00e1bhol, Elichpur, Daulatabad, Bedar, Kulbarga, and K\u00e1ndh\u00e1r.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 25.\n5 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 405-406.\n6 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 26.\nwhose chief was named Shirke whom he speedily obliged to surrender and to deliver himself and family into his hands. Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r insisted that Shirke should embrace the Muhammadan faith or be put to death. Shirke, on this, assuming an air of great humility, represented that there existed between him and Shankar R\u00e1y of Khelna or Vish\u00e1lgad in Kolh\u00e1pur a family jealousy, and that should he become a Muhammadan, his rival, on Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r's retreat, would taunt him with ignominy and excite his own family and subjects to revolt. He further promised to accept the Muhammadan faith if Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r would reduce his rival, and agreed to guide him and his forces through the woody and very difficult country to Shankar's dominions. Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r marched against the chief of Khelna but was treacherously surrounded and killed in the woods by Shirke. About this time (1453-1480) no references have been traced to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra places except to W\u00e1i and M\u00e1n which are mentioned as military posts, whose troops in 1464 were ordered to join M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n in his Konkan expedition. In 1460, and twelve years later in 1472 and 1473, failure of rain so wasted the country that in 1474 when rain fell scarcely any one was left to till the land. The power and turbulence of their provincial governors was a source of weakness and danger to Bahmani rule. To remove this evil M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n, the very learned and able minister of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h Bahmani II. (1463-1482), framed a scheme under which the Bahmani territories were divided into eight instead of into four provinces. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was included under Bij\u00e1pur, one of the two divisions into which Kulbarga was divided, and was placed under Khw\u00e1ja G\u00e1w\u00e1n himself. In each province only one fort was held in the governor's hands; all other forts were entrusted to captains and garrisons appointed and paid from head-quarters; the pay of the captains was greatly increased and they were strictly compelled to keep their garrisons at their full strength. This scheme for reducing their power brought on the minister the hatred of the leading nobles. They brought false charges of disloyalty against M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n. The king was weak enough to believe them and foolish enough to order the minister's execution, a loss which Bahmani power never recovered.\n\nIn 1481, on the death of M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n, his estate of Bij\u00e1pur including S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was conferred on Yusuf Adil Kh\u00e1n the future founder of the Adil Sh\u00e1hi dynasty of Bij\u00e1pur who was appointed\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 438-439.\n2 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 483.\n3 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 483, 493, 494.\n4 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 503, 504.\n5 Yusuf Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur was a Turk, a son of Amur\u00e1th Sult\u00e1n (1421-1451) of Constantinople. He founded the family of the Adil Sh\u00e1hi rulers of Bij\u00e1pur consisting of nine sovereigns whose rule lasted nearly 200 years. See Bij\u00e1pur Statistical Account. At the same time the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi dynasty under Ahmad Niz\u00e1m was established at Ahmadnagar (1490-1636), the Kutb Sh\u00e1hi dynasty under Sult\u00e1n Kutb-ul-Mulk at Golconda (1512-1609), and the Berid Sh\u00e1hi under K\u00e1sim Berid at Bedar (1492-1609). Though kings, nominally supreme, continued to rule as late as 1526, the supremacy of the Bahmanis may be said to have ceased when the Bij\u00e1pur (1489) and Ahmadnagar (1490) governors threw off their allegiance and established themselves as independent rulers. According to Colonel Meadows Taylor, except Hum\u00e1yun Sh\u00e1h (1457-1461), the Bahmani kings protected their people and governed them justly and well. Among the Deccan Hindus all\ntarafdar or provincial governor, while Daria Kh\u00e1n Fakr-ul-Mulk, Mallu Kh\u00e1n, and most of the Moghal officers attached to him obtained estates in the province. In 1489 Yusuf Adil Kh\u00e1n asserted his independence and proclaimed himself king. He wrested many forts from the governors of Mahmud Sh\u00e1h Bahmani II. (1482-1518) and subdued all the country from the river Bhima to Bij\u00e1pur.\u00b9 In 1551 Saif Ain-ul-Mulk, late commander-in-chief of the Ahmadnagar army who had taken refuge in Ber\u00e1r and who at the request of the Bij\u00e1pur king had come to Bij\u00e1pur was given considerable estates in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In the battle of Shol\u00e1pur against Ahmadnagar in the same year Ibr\u00e1him-Adil-Sh\u00e1h suspected Saif Ain-ul-Mulk of treachery, and he, in consequence, retired to M\u00e1n in east S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, collected the revenues, and divided them among his troops.\u00b2 Ibr\u00e1him Adil Sh\u00e1h sent one of his officers with 5000 horse to expel Ain-ul-Mulk, but the Bij\u00e1pur troops were defeated. Saif Ain-ul-Mulk, growing bolder by success, gathered the revenues of many districts including V\u00e1lva in south S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Ibr\u00e1him next sent against him 10,000 horse and foot under Ni\u00e1z Kuli Beg and Dil\u00e1var Kh\u00e1n Habshi. These troops were also defeated and so many elephants and horses and so great a store of valuable baggage fell into the hands of Ain-ul-Mulk that he levied fresh troops and determined to establish himself as an independent\n\nelements of social union and local government were preserved and strengthened by the Musalm\u00e1ns, who, without interfering with or remodelling local institutions and hereditary offices, turned them to their own use. Persian and Arabic education was extended by village schools attached to mosques and endowed with lands. This tended to the spread of the literature and faith of the rulers, and the effects of this education can still be traced through the Bahmani dominions. A large foreign commerce centred in Bedar, the capital of the Deccan, which was visited by merchants and travellers from all countries. The Bahmani kings made few public works. There were no water works, no roads or bridges, and no public inns or posts. Their chief works were huge castles which after 500 years are as perfect as when they were built. These forts have glacis and counterscarps, covered ways, traverses, flanking bastions with curtains and intermediate towers, broad wet and dry ditches, and in all plain fortresses a faussebraye or rampart-mound with bastions and towers in addition to main rampart. No forcible conversion of masses of Hindus seems to have taken place. A constant stream of foreigners poured in from Persia, Arabia, Tartary, Afghanistan, and Abyssinia. These foreigners, who served chiefly as soldiers, married Hindus and created the new Muhammedan population of the Deccan.\n\nArchitecture of Bij\u00e1pur, 12-13.

Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h took the field in person at the head of 5000 chosen horse, 3000 foot, and a train of artillery. Ain-ul-Mulk encamped on the river M\u00e1n, and the king arrived and halted some days on the opposite bank without attacking him. Saif Ain-ul-Mulk resolved not to quit the country without fighting. For three days he advanced towards the king\u2019s camp as if to engage but as often retired, the royal army remaining under arms on each occasion from dawn till sunset expecting the attack. On the fourth day Ain-ul-Mulk put his troops again in motion; but the king, supposing that his design was only to parade as on the preceding days, neglected to make preparations for his reception, the common guards of the camp only getting under arms. At length, when the enemy\u2019s standard appeared in sight, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h marshalled his troops in great haste and moved out of the camp to give battle. Ain-ul-Mulk averse from engaging the king in person consulted with his friends, observing that it was treason to fight against the royal standard. To this all agreed except Murtaza Kh\u00e1n \u00c1nju who remarked that the standards did not fight, and there was no danger of shedding royal blood. Ain-ul-Mulk satisfied with his casuistry and finding it too late to hesitate, charged the royalists, and attacking the centre where Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h was posted, pressed on it so fiercely that it was thrown into disorder and the king fled. On this his whole line broke and victory declared in favour of Ain-ul-Mulk, who seized the royal canopy, elephants, and artillery, besides all the tents and baggage. Ain-ul-Mulk pursued the king towards Bij\u00e1pur, but was afterwards obliged to fly by the route of M\u00e1n Desh to the Ahmadnagar dominions where he was assassinated.\u00b9 In 1579, the Bij\u00e1pur minister Kishvar Kh\u00e1n falsely accused Ch\u00e1nd Bibi the dowager queen of instigating her brother, Murtaza Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h king of Ahmadnagar, to invade Bij\u00e1pur, and sent her a prisoner to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra after subjecting her to many indignities.\u00b2 On Kishwar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s fall in the same year Ch\u00e1nd Bibi was released from prison and conducted to Bij\u00e1pur.\u00b3 In 1592 Dil\u00e1var Kh\u00e1n the Bij\u00e1pur regent was sent a prisoner to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where he shortly after died.\u2074\n\nUnder the Bij\u00e1pur kings, though perhaps less regularly than afterwards under the Moghals, the country was divided into districts or sark\u00e1rs. The district was distributed among sub-divisions which were generally known by the Persian names pargana, kary\u00e1t, sammat, mah\u00e1l, and t\u00e1luka, and sometimes by the Hindu names of pr\u00e1nt and desh. The hilly west, which was generally managed by Hindu officers, continued to be arranged by valleys with their Hindu names of khora, mura, and m\u00e1val. The collection of the revenue was generally entrusted to farmers, the farms sometimes including only one village. Where the revenue was not farmed, its collection was generally entrusted to Hindu officers. Over the revenue-farmers was a government agent or amil, who, besides collecting the revenue, managed the police and settled civil suits. Civil suits relating to\n\n\u00b9 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 105. \u00b2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 148. \u00b3 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 150. \u2074 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 172-173.\nland were generally referred to juries or panchayats. In money suits the amils or government agents probably passed decisions. One of the amild\u00e1rs, who superintended a considerable division and to whom all other amild\u00e1rs were subordinate, was termed mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r, and it is conjectured that he had some percentage on the revenues. The mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r's office though sometimes continued from father to son was not hereditary. Frequently but not always over the mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r was a subha who, although he took no share in the revenue management and did not live in the district, executed deeds and formal writings of importance. Though the chief power in the country was Muhammadan, Hindus were largely employed in the service of the state. The garrisons of hill forts seem generally to have been Hindus, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kolis, R\u00e1moshis, and Dhangars, a few places of special strength being reserved for Musalm\u00e1n commandants or killed\u00e1rs. Besides the hill forts some parts of the open country were left under loyal Mar\u00e1tha and Br\u00e1hman officers with the titles of estate-holder or j\u00e1gird\u00e1r and of district head or deshmukh. Estates were generally granted on military tenure, the value of the grant being in proportion to the number of troops which the grant-holder maintained. Phaltan, from which in the time of the Peshw\u00e1s 350 horse were required, furnished only fifty to the Bij\u00e1pur government at a very late period of that dynasty, but the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs could procure horsemen at short notice and they were entertained or discharged at pleasure. Family feuds or personal hate, and, in the case of those whose lands lay near the borders of other kingdoms, an intelligent regard for the chances of war, often divided Mar\u00e1tha families and led members of one family to take service under rival Musalm\u00e1n states. Numbers of Hindus were employed in the Bij\u00e1pur armies and those of distinguished service were rewarded with the Hindu titles of r\u00e1ja, n\u00e1ik, and r\u00fav.\n\nThe principal Mar\u00e1tha chiefs in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra under the Bij\u00e1pur government were Chandrar\u00e1v More of J\u00e1vli, about thirty-five miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, R\u00e1v N\u00e1ik Nimb\u00e1lkar of Phaltan about thirty-five miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Junjh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Gh\u00e1tge of Malavdi about twenty-seven miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Daphle of Jath about ninety miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, M\u00e1ne of Mhasv\u00e1d about sixty miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the Ghorpade of K\u00e1psi on the V\u00e1rna about thirty miles south of Karh\u00e1d. A person named More, originally a Karn\u00e1tak chief was appointed in the reign of Yusuf Adil Sh\u00e1h (1490-1510) to the command of a body of 12,000 Hindu infantry sent to reduce the strong tract between the Nira and the V\u00e1rna. Mor\u00e9 was successful. He dispossessed the Shirkes and completely suppressed the depredations of their abettors the chief of whom were Gujar, M\u00e1mulkar, Mohite, and Mah\u00e1d\u00edk. Mor\u00e9 was dignified with the title of Chandrar\u00e1v and his son Yashv\u00e1ntr\u00e1v, having distinguished himself in a battle fought with the troops of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h (1508-1553), in which he captured a green flag, was confirmed in the succession to his father as R\u00e1ja of J\u00e1vli and\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 36-37.\nhad permission to use the banner he had won. Their descendants ruled in the same tract of country for seven generations and under their mild and just management that barren tract became populous. All the successors of the first More assumed the title of Chandrar\u00e1v. The unswerving loyalty of this family induced the Bij\u00e1pur government to exact little more than a nominal tribute from districts producing so little, and which had always been in disorder under Muhammadan governors. R\u00e1v N\u00e1ik Nimb\u00e1lkar or Phaltanr\u00e1v was the N\u00e1ik of Phaltan. His original surname was Pov\u00e1r; he had taken the name of Nimb\u00e1lkar from Nimbal\u00edk or Nimlak where the first Nimb\u00e1lkar lived. The family is considered one of the most ancient in Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra as the Nimb\u00e1lkar was made sardeshmukh of Phaltan before the middle of the seventeenth century by one of the Bij\u00e1pur kings. The deshmukh of Phaltan is said to have become a polygar or independent chief and to have repeatedly withheld the revenues of the district. Vangoji or Jagp\u00e1lr\u00e1v N\u00e1ik Nimb\u00e1lkar who lived in the early part of the seventeenth century was notorious for his restless and predatory habits. Dip\u00e1b\u00e1i the sister of Jagp\u00e1lr\u00e1v was married to M\u00e1loji Bhonsla Shiv\u00e1ji's grandfather who was one of the principal chiefs under the Ahmadnagar kingdom. Jagp\u00e1lr\u00e1v N\u00e1ik seems to have been a man of great influence. It was through his exertions that the marriage of M\u00e1loji's son Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji and Jijib\u00e1i Lukhdev J\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v's daughter was brought about against the wishes of the girl's parents. One of the Phaltan N\u00e1iks was killed in 1620 in a battle between Malik Ambar and the Moghals. Nimb\u00e1lkar never exchanged his ancient title of n\u00e1ik for that of R\u00e1ja. Junjh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Gh\u00e1tge the deshmukh of Malavdi was the head of a powerful family whose founder Kam R\u00e1je Gh\u00e1tge had a small command under the Bahmani kings. His native country Khat\u00e1v was separated from that of the Nimb\u00e1lkar by the Mah\u00e1dev hills. The Gh\u00e1tges were deshmukhs and sardeshmukhs of the pargana of M\u00e1n. In 1626 N\u00e1goji Gh\u00e1tge was given the title of sardeshmukh as an unconditional favour by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h II. together with the title of Junjh\u00e1rr\u00e1v. The head of the M\u00e1ne family was deshmukh of Mhasv\u00e1d, adjoining the district of the Gh\u00e1tges. The M\u00e1nes were distinguished shiled\u00e1rs or self-horsed cavaliers under Bij\u00e1pur, but were nearly as notorious for their revengeful character as the Shirkes. The Ghorpades, who were originally Bhonsles, according to their family legend acquired their present surname during the Bahmani times from having been the first to scale a fort in the Konkan which was deemed impregnable by fastening a cord round the body of a ghorpad or iguana. They were deshmukhs under the Bij\u00e1pur government and were divided into two distinct families, one of K\u00e1pshi near the V\u00e1rna river and the other of Mudhol near the Ghatprabha in the Karn\u00e1tak. Under Bij\u00e1pur the K\u00e1pshikar Ghorpades were known as the navkas or nine-touch Ghorpades and the Mudholkars as the s\u00e1tkas or seven-touch Ghorpades, a distinction which the two families maintain. The head of the Mudholkar Ghorpades is the p\u00e1t\u00edl of a village near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Ghorpades seem to have signalized themselves at a very early period. The high Musalm\u00e1n title of Amir ul-Omra or Chief of the Nobles was conferred on one of the members of the K\u00e1pshi family by the Bij\u00e1pur kings.\nThe first Ghorpade that joined Shiv\u00e1ji was one of the K\u00e1phshikars while the Mudholkars were his bitter enemies. The Daphles were deshmukhs of the pargana of Jath. Their original name was Chavh\u00e1n and they took the surname of Daphle from their village of Daphl\u00e1pur of which they were hereditary p\u00e1t\u00eds. They held a command from the Bij\u00e1pur kings.\n\nIn 1636 the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi dynasty came to an end and in 1637 Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji Bhonsle the son of M\u00e1loji Bhonsle, who had taken a considerable part in Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi affairs during the last years of the dynasty, was allowed to retire into the service of M\u00e1hmud Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur (1626 - 1656). In 1637 besides giving Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji his j\u00e1gir districts in Poona, M\u00e1hmud Adil Sh\u00e1h conferred on Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji a royal grant for the deshmukhi of twenty-two villages in the district of Karh\u00e1d, the right to which had by some means devolved on government. Before the middle of the 17th century, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji's son Shiv\u00e1ji, the founder of the Mar\u00e1tha empire, had begun to establish himself in the hilly parts of Poona in the north where by 1648 he had succeeded in gaining possession of his father's estate of Poona and Supa and of the strong forts of Torna in Bhor about thirty-five miles and Kondh\u00e1na or Sinhgad about ten miles south-west of Poona, of Purandhar about twenty miles south of Poona, and of R\u00e1jgad in Bhor about five miles east of Torna. At this time the south of the Nira, as far east as Shirval and as far south as the range of hills north of the Krishna, was farmed by the hereditary deshmukh of Hardas M\u00e1val, a Mar\u00e1tha named B\u00e1ndal, and the fort of Rohira was committed to his care. He early entertained a jealousy of Shiv\u00e1ji and kept a strong garrison and carefully watched the country round Purandhar. The deshp\u00e1nde of the place was a Prabhu a caste to whom Shiv\u00e1ji was always partial. W\u00e1i was the station of a Bij\u00e1pur mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r or manager who had charge of P\u00e1ndugad, Kamalgad, and several other forts in the neighbourhood. Chandrar\u00e1v More, R\u00e1ja of J\u00e1vli, was in possession of the Gh\u00e1tm\u00e1tha from the Krishna to the V\u00e1rna. The Bij\u00e1pur government being impressed with the idea that it was incited by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, over whom they had complete control, took no active measures to suppress Shiv\u00e1ji's rebellion. In 1649 Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was imprisoned at Bij\u00e1pur and in 1651-52 a feeble attempt to seize Shiv\u00e1ji was made by a Hindu named B\u00e1ji Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1j. Shiv\u00e1ji frequently lived at the town of M\u00e1l\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1b\u00e1 and the party of Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1j, passing through the territory of Chandrar\u00e1v More, lurked about the P\u00e1r pass until an opportunity should offer. Shiv\u00e1ji anticipated the surprise, attacked the party near the bottom of the pass and drove them in great panic to the forests. In 1653, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was released from confinement at Bij\u00e1pur and was bound by a solemn engagement to refrain from molesting the Mudhol chief who had been instrumental in his capture. To induce both parties to forget what had passed, M\u00e1hmud Adil Sh\u00e1h made them exchange their hereditary rights and \u00ednd\u00e1ms as deshmukhs. B\u00e1ji Ghorpade thus obtained from Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji the deshmuki rights of twenty-two villages,\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 38-40.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 55.\n3 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 62.\nin Karh\u00e1d which Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji had acquired in 1637 from Bij\u00e1pur.\\footnote{Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 66.} Disturbances in the Karn\u00e1tak prevented the Bij\u00e1pur government taking active steps against Shiv\u00e1ji, and no sooner was Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji released than Shiv\u00e1ji began to devise new schemes for possessing himself of the whole Gh\u00e1tm\u00e1tha or hilly West Deccan. He had in vain attempted to induce the R\u00e1ja of J\u00e1vli to unite with him against Bij\u00e1pur. Chandrar\u00e1v More, although he carried on no war against Shiv\u00e1ji and received his messengers with civility, refused to join in rebellion against Bij\u00e1pur. The permission granted to Sh\u00e1mraj's party to pass through his country, and the aid which he was said to have given him afforded Shiv\u00e1ji an excuse for hostility; but the R\u00e1ja was too powerful to be openly attacked with any certain prospect of success. He had a strong body of infantry of nearly the same description as Shiv\u00e1ji's M\u00e1valis; his two sons, his brother, and his minister Himmatr\u00e1v were all good soldiers; nor did there appear any means by which Shiv\u00e1ji could create a division among them. Having held his troops in a state of preparation for some time, Shiv\u00e1ji sent two agents a Br\u00e1hman named R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l and a Mar\u00e1tha named Sambh\u00e1ji K\u00e1vji for the purpose of gaining correct intelligence of the situation and strength of the principal places, but ostensibly with the design of contracting a marriage between Shiv\u00e1ji and the daughter of Chandrar\u00e1v. R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l and Sambh\u00e1ji K\u00e1vji proceeded to J\u00e1vli attended by twenty-five M\u00e1valis. They were courteously received and had several interviews with Chandrar\u00e1v, and R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l seeing the R\u00e1ja totally off his guard formed the plan of assassinating him and his brother to which Sambh\u00e1ji K\u00e1vji readily agreed. He wrote to Shiv\u00e1ji communicating his intention which was approved, and, to support it, troops were secretly sent up the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds from the Konkan, where Shiv\u00e1ji, besides the district of Kaly\u00e1n, held the forts of Tala, Ghos\u00e1l\u00e1, and Ra\u00edri in Kol\u00e1ba. Shiv\u00e1ji to avoid suspicion marched from R\u00e1jgad his capital to Purandhar and from Purandhar he made a night march to Mah\u00e1baleshvar at the source of the Krishna where he joined his troops which had assembled in the neighbouring forests. R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l, on finding that the preparations were completed, took an opportunity of demanding a private conference with the R\u00e1ja and his brother, when he stabbed the R\u00e1ja to the heart and his brother was despatched by Sambh\u00e1ji K\u00e1vji. Their attendants being previously ready the assassins instantly fled and darting into the thick forest which everywhere surrounded the place they soon met Shiv\u00e1ji who according to appointment was advancing to their support. Before the consternation caused by the double murder had subsided, J\u00e1vli was attacked on all sides, but the troops, headed by the R\u00e1ja's sons and Himmatr\u00e1v, notwithstanding the surprise, made a brave resistance until Himmatr\u00e1v fell and the sons were made prisoners. Shiv\u00e1ji lost no time in securing the possessions of Chandrar\u00e1v More. The capture of the strong fort of V\u00e1sota, about fifteen miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra called Vajragad by Shiv\u00e1ji, and the submission of the Sevta valley completed the conquest of J\u00e1vli. The sons of Chandrar\u00e1v who remained prisoners were subsequently\n\nChapter VII\nHistory.\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\nAdil Sh\u00e1his,\n1489-1686.\n\nJ\u00e1vli R\u00e1ja's Murder.\ncondemned to death for maintaining a secret correspondence with Bij\u00e1pur. Shiv\u00e1ji followed up his conquest by surprising Rohira which he scaled at night at the head of his M\u00e1valis. B\u00e1ndal, the deshmukh who was in the fort at the time stood to his arms on the first moment of alarm; and although greatly outnumbered his men did not submit until he was killed. At the head of them was B\u00e1ji Prabhu the deshpande; Shiv\u00e1ji treated him with generosity, received him with great kindness, and confirmed him in all his hereditary possessions. He had relations with Shiv\u00e1ji, and afterwards agreed to follow the fortunes of his conqueror; the command of a considerable body of infantry was conferred upon him and he maintained his character for bravery and fidelity to the last. In 1656, to secure access to his possessions on the banks of the Nira and the Koyna and to strengthen the defences of the P\u00e1r pass Shiv\u00e1ji pitched upon a high rock near the source of the Krishna on which he resolved to build another fort. The execution of the design was entrusted to a Deshastha Br\u00e1hman named Moro Trimal Pingle, who shortly before had been appointed to command the fort of Purandhar in Poona. This man, when very young, had accompanied his father, then in the service of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji to the Karn\u00e1tak and returned to the Mar\u00e1tha country about the year 1653 and shortly after joined Shiv\u00e1ji. The able manner in which he executed every thing entrusted to him soon gained him the confidence of his master and the erection of Prat\u00e1pgad, the name given to the new fort, confirmed the favourable opinion entertained of him.\u00b9 In the same year (1656) the Moghals invaded the Bij\u00e1pur territories and Sarjer\u00e1v Gh\u00e1tge, Nimb\u00e1lkar, and other Mar\u00e1tha estate-holders promptly joined Kh\u00e1n Muhammad the Bij\u00e1pur prime minister with their troops.\u00b2\n\nAbout the year 1658 Bij\u00e1pur was distracted by factions among its nobles and the youth of its sovereign Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h II. At last they became sensible of the necessity of making an active effort to subdue Shiv\u00e1ji. For this purpose an army was assembled consisting of 5000 horse and 7000 choice infantry, a good train of artillery or what was considered as such, besides a large supply of rockets, a number of swivels mounted on camels, and abundance of stores. Afzul Kh\u00e1n, an officer of high rank, volunteered to command the expedition, and in his public leave-taking, in the vaunting manner particularly common to Deccan Muhammadans, pompously declared that he should bring back the insignificant rebel and cast him in chains under the footstool of the throne. To avoid impediments which presented themselves on the straight route from Bij\u00e1pur and the heavy rains which seldom subsided in the neighbourhood of the hills till the end of October, the army proceeded in September 1659 from Bij\u00e1pur to Pandharpur and thence marched towards W\u00e1i. Shiv\u00e1ji, on its approach, took up his residence in Prat\u00e1pgad and sent the most humble messages to Afzul Kh\u00e1n. He pretended to have no thought of opposing so great a personage, and seemed only anxious to make his peace with the Bij\u00e1pur government.\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 67-68. \u00b2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 70.\nthrough the Kh\u00e1n's mediation; he affected the utmost sorrow for his conduct, which he could hardly persuade himself would be forgiven by the king, even if the Kh\u00e1n should receive him under the shadow of his protection; and he would surrender the whole of his country to the Kh\u00e1n were it possible to assure himself of his favour. Afzul Kh\u00e1n, who had all the vanity of a Muhammadan noble, had also a thorough contempt for his enemy. At the same time as he had formerly been in charge of the W\u00e1i district he was aware of the exceeding difficulty of an advance through the wild country which he must penetrate. With such considerations and mollified by Shiv\u00e1ji's submission, Afzul Kh\u00e1n in answer to repeated applications despatched a Br\u00e1hman in his own service named Gopin\u00e1thpant with suitable attendants to Prat\u00e1pgad. On his arrival at P\u00e1r a village below the fort, Shiv\u00e1ji came down to meet him. The Br\u00e1hman stated that the Kh\u00e1n his master and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji were intimate friends, that the Kh\u00e1n bore no enmity towards his son, but on the contrary would prove his desire to aid him by interceding for his pardon, and even endeavouring to get him confirmed as j\u00e1gird\u00e1r in part of the territory he had usurped. Shiv\u00e1ji acknowledged his obligation although his reply at the public meeting was not couched in the same humble strain he had used in his messages. He said that if he could obtain a part of the country in j\u00e1gir it would be all he could expect, that he was the king's servant and that he had been of considerable use to his government in reducing several chiefs whose territory would now come under the royal authority. This was the substance of what passed at their first interview. Shiv\u00e1ji provided accommodation for the envoy and his suite, but assigned a place for the Br\u00e1hman at some distance from the rest. In the middle of the night Shiv\u00e1ji secretly introduced himself to Gopin\u00e1thpant. He addressed him as a Br\u00e1hman his superior. He represented that all he had done was for the sake of Hindus and the Hindu faith, that he was called on by the goddess Bhav\u00e1ni herself to protect Br\u00e1hmans and cows, to punish the violaters of their temples and their gods, and to resist the enemies of their religion, that it became Gopin\u00e1thpant as a Br\u00e1hman to aid a course which Bhav\u00e1ni had sanctioned, and that if he did, he should ever after live among his caste and countrymen in comfort and wealth. Shiv\u00e1ji seconded his arguments with presents, and the solemn promise to bestow the village of Hevra on him and his posterity for ever. The Br\u00e1hman envoy could not resist such an appeal seconded by such an inducement and swore fidelity to Shiv\u00e1ji, declared he was his for ever, and called on the goddess to punish him if he swerved from any task Shiv\u00e1ji might impose. They consulted on the fittest means for averting the present danger. The Br\u00e1hman, fully acquainted with Afzul Kh\u00e1n's character, suggested tempting him to a conference and Shiv\u00e1ji at once approved of the scheme. He sent for Krishn\u00e1ji Bh\u00e1skar, a confidential Br\u00e1hman, informed him of what had passed, and of the resolution which he had adopted. After fully consulting on the subject they separated as secretly as they had met. After holding some interviews and discussions for the purpose of masking their design, Krishn\u00e1ji Bh\u00e1skar as Shiv\u00e1ji's agent was despatched with Gopin\u00e1thpant to the camp of Afzul\nKh\u00e1n. Gopin\u00e1thpant represented Shiv\u00e1ji as in great alarm; but if his fears could be overcome by the personal assurances of the Kh\u00e1n, he was convinced that he might easily be prevailed on to give himself up. With a blind confidence Afzul Kh\u00e1n trusted himself to Gopin\u00e1thpant's guidance. An interview was agreed on, and the Bij\u00e1pur troops with great labour moved to J\u00e1vli. Shiv\u00e1ji prepared a place for the meeting below the fort of Prat\u00e1pgad; he cut down the jungle, and cleared a road for the Kh\u00e1n's approach but every other avenue to the place was carefully closed. He ordered Moropant and Net\u00e1ji P\u00e1lkar from the Konkan with many thousands of the M\u00e1vali infantry. He communicated his whole plan to these two and to T\u00e1n\u00e1ji M\u00e1lusre. Net\u00e1ji was stationed in the thickets a little to the east of the fort, where it was expected that part of the Kh\u00e1n's retinue would advance, and Moro Trimal with a body of old and tried men was sent to hide himself in the neighbourhood of the main body of the Bij\u00e1pur troops which as had been agreed remained near J\u00e1vli. The preconcerted signal for Net\u00e1ji was the blast of a horn, and the distant attack by Moro Trimal was to begin on hearing the fire of five guns from Prat\u00e1pgad which were also to announce Shiv\u00e1ji's safety. Fifteen hundred of Afzul Kh\u00e1n's troops accompanied him to within a few hundred yards of Prat\u00e1pgad, where, for fear of alarming Shiv\u00e1ji, at Gopin\u00e1thpant's suggestion they were desired to halt. Afzul Kh\u00e1n, dressed in a thin muslin garment, armed only with his sword, and attended, as had been agreed, by a single armed follower advanced in his palanquin to an open building prepared for the occasion. Shiv\u00e1ji had made preparations for this purpose, not as if conscious that he meditated a criminal and treacherous deed but as if resolved on some meritorious though desperate action. After bathing, he laid his head at his mother's feet and asked her blessing. He took a hasty but affectionate farewell of his friends committing his son Sambh\u00e1ji to their care. He rose, put on a steel chain cap under his turban and chain armour under his cotton gown, hid a crooked dagger or bichva in his right-sleeve, and on the fingers of his left hand he fixed v\u00e1ghnakhs or steel tiger's claw a treacherous weapon well known among Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Thus armed he slowly descended from the fort. The Kh\u00e1n had arrived at the place of meeting before him, and was expressing his impatience at the delay, when Shiv\u00e1ji was seen advancing, apparently unarmed and like the Kh\u00e1n attended by only one armed follower, his tried friend T\u00e1n\u00e1ji M\u00e1lusre. Shiv\u00e1ji in view of Afzul Kh\u00e1n, frequently stopped, which was represented as the effects of alarm, a supposition more likely to be admitted from his diminutive size. Under pretence of assuring Shiv\u00e1ji, the armed, attendant by the contrivance of the Br\u00e1hman stood at a few paces distance. Afzul Kh\u00e1n made no objection to Shiv\u00e1ji's follower although he carried two swords in his waistband, a circumstance which might pass unnoticed, being common amongst Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\n1 In 1826 R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh when chief of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1810-1839) gave the v\u00e1ghnakhs to Mr. Elphinstone. They were most formidable steel hooks, very sharp, and attached to two rings fitting the fingers and lay concealed in the inside of the hand. Colebrooke's Elphinstone, II. 188. See also Scott Waring's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 69.\nadvanced two or three paces to meet Shiv\u00e1ji; they were introduced, and in the midst of the customary embrace Shiv\u00e1ji struck the v\u00e1ghnakhs into the bowels of Afzul Kh\u00e1n, who quickly disengaged himself, clapped his hand on his sword, exclaiming treachery and murder, but Shiv\u00e1ji instantly followed up the blow with his dagger. The Kh\u00e1n had drawn his sword and made a cut at Shiv\u00e1ji, but the concealed armour was proof against the blow; the whole was the work of a moment, and Shiv\u00e1ji was wresting the weapon from the hand of his victim before their attendants could run towards them. Syed Bandu the Kh\u00e1n's follower refused his life on condition of surrender, and against two such swordsmen as Shiv\u00e1ji and his companion, maintained an unequal combat for some time before he fell. The bearers had lifted the Kh\u00e1n into his palanquin during the scuffle, but by the time it was over, Khandu M\u00e1le and some other followers of Shiv\u00e1ji had come up, cut off the head of the dying man, and carried it to Prat\u00e1pgad. The signals agreed on were made; the M\u00e1valis rushed from their concealment and beset the nearest part of the Bij\u00e1pur troops on all sides, few of whom had time to mount their horses or stand to their arms. Net\u00e1ji P\u00e1lkar gave no quarter; but orders were sent to Moropant to spare all who submitted. Shiv\u00e1ji's humanity to his prisoners was conspicuous on this as on most occasions. Many of those that had attempted to escape were brought in several days afterwards in a state of great wretchedness. Their reception and treatment induced many of the Mar\u00e1tha prisoners to enter Shiv\u00e1ji's service. The most distinguished Mar\u00e1tha taken was Junjh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Gh\u00e1tge whose father had been the intimate friend of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, but Shiv\u00e1ji could not induce him to depart from his allegiance to Bij\u00e1pur. At his own request he was allowed to return, and was honourably dismissed with valuable presents. The son and family of Afzul Kh\u00e1n were taken by Khanduji K\u00e1kde one of Shiv\u00e1ji's officers, but on being offered a large bribe he agreed to guide them to a place of safety, and led them by unfrequented paths across the mountains and along the banks of the Koyna, until he safely lodged them in Karh\u00e1d. When this treachery came to Shiv\u00e1ji's knowledge K\u00e1kde was condemned to death and at once executed.\n\nThis success greatly raised the reputation of Shiv\u00e1ji. The immediate fruits were four thousand horse, several elephants, a number of camels, a considerable treasure, and the whole train of\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 76-78. Abdulla Afzul Kh\u00e1n who was a man of great personal prowess secured Shiv\u00e1ji with one of his hands and endeavoured to stab him. Shiv\u00e1ji was indebted for his life to the precaution he had used of wearing armour. Disengaging himself from his grasp, he plunged v\u00e1ghnakhs into his stomach and cut him down with his sword. His secretary Gopin\u00e1thpant endeavoured to avenge the act when Shiv\u00e1ji bade him fly as he should always hold sacred the life of a Br\u00e1hman. The troops now rushed out and not a man, except the fortunate Br\u00e1hman escaped to relate the horrid murder. Scott Waring's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 67-69. Scott Waring in a note adds: This account rests entirely upon the authority of the Mar\u00e1tha manuscripts, and I think them entitled to credit. Had not Abdulla Kh\u00e1n intended the like treachery I should doubt his consenting to an interview with such a man as Shiv\u00e1ji and upon such harsh conditions. For what more could he expect to effect at an interview than could have been effected by his secretary? This intention of Abdulla does not extenuate Shiv\u00e1ji's conduct, for Shiv\u00e1ji had made up his mind from the first to murder the Musalm\u00e1n general. Ditto, 200.\nequipment which had been sent against him. Such of his troops as were wounded, Shiv\u00e1ji on this occasion distinguished by presents of bracelets, necklaces, chains of gold and silver, and clothes. These were presented with much ceremony, and served to stimulate future exertion among his soldiers as well as to give greater fame to his exploit. The sword of Afzul Kh\u00e1n and Shiv\u00e1ji's favourite sword Bhav\u00e1ni passed to the Moghals on the capture of Sambh\u00e1ji in 1690. They were restored by Aurangzeb to Sh\u00e1hu in 1707 and till 1827 remained a valued trophy in the armoury of Shiv\u00e1ji's descendants. Gopin\u00e1thpant received the promised grant in reward for his treachery, and was afterwards promoted to considerable rank in the service.\n\nIn 1659, Shiv\u00e1ji surprised the fort of Vasantgad about seven miles north-west of Karh\u00e1d, levied contributions along the Krishna, and left a th\u00e1na or garrison with a revenue collector in the gadhi or mud fort of Battis Shir\u00e1la. In January 1661, Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h II. disappointed in his hopes of crushing Shiv\u00e1ji, took the field in person and marched to Karh\u00e1d. All the district authorities, some of whom had submitted to Shiv\u00e1ji, attended the royal camp to tender their allegiance. Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h recovered Panh\u00e1la and R\u00e1ngna in Kolh\u00e1pur which had fallen to Shiv\u00e1ji in the previous year.\n\nIn 1661, as Shiv\u00e1ji was unable to visit the famous temple of Bhav\u00e1ni at Tulj\u00e1pur during the rains, he with great solemnity dedicated a temple to her in the fort of Prat\u00e1pagad. His religious observances from this time became exceedingly rigid; he chose the celebrated R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi as his mah\u00e1purush or spiritual guide, and aspired to a high character for sanctity. In 1662 when Shiv\u00e1ji thought of making R\u00e1ygad in Kol\u00e1ba his capital he held the Konkan Gh\u00e1tm\u00e1tha that is the hilly West Deccan from the Bhima to the V\u00e1rna. In 1665, in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Purandhar by which Shiv\u00e1ji ceded to the Moghals the forts which he had taken from them and twenty others taken or built by him in the territory of the late Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi government and obtained the right of levying the chauth and sardeshmukhi over the Bij\u00e1pur dominions and to co-operate with the Moghals to subdue Bij\u00e1pur, Shiv\u00e1ji with a body of 2000 horse and 8000 infantry joined Jaysing and the combined army marched about November. Their first operations were against Baj\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik Nimb\u00e1lkar a relation of Shiv\u00e1ji and a j\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Bij\u00e1pur. Phaltan was reduced and the fort of T\u00e1thvad scaled by Shiv\u00e1ji's M\u00e1valis. All the fortified places in their route were taken. Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h had prepared his troops, but endeavoured to prevent the invasion by promises of settling the demands of the Moghals. But Jaysing continued his advance and met with little opposition until near Mangalvedha in Shol\u00e1pur. In 1668 Shiv\u00e1ji obtained a yearly payment of money from the Bij\u00e1pur government in lieu of a levy of the chauth and sardeshmukhi over the Bij\u00e1pur dominions.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 79.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 82.\n3 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 83.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 85.\n5 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 94-95.\nand in spite of the narrowing of his territory by the Purandhar treaty he still retained the western S\u00e1t\u00e1ra hills.\n\nThe years 1668 and 1669 were of greatest leisure in Shivaji's life. Some of his contemporaries, speculating on the future, supposed from his apparent inactivity that he would sink into insignificance, but he employed this interval in revising and completing the internal management of his government, which with his various institutions are the key to the forms of government afterwards adopted by every Mar\u00e1tha state. Shivaji's regulations were gradually formed and enlarged, but after a certain period underwent no change by the extension of his territory until he assumed the ensigns of royalty. Even then the alterations were rather in matters of form than in rules. The plans of Mar\u00e1tha encroachment which were afterwards pursued so successfully by his nation may be traced from a very early period and nothing is more remarkable in regard to Shivaji than the foresight with which some of his schemes were laid and the fitness of his arrangements for the genius of his countrymen.\n\nThe foundation of his power was his infantry; his occupation of the forts gave him a hold on the country and a place of deposit for his plunder. His cavalry had not yet spread the terror of the Mar\u00e1tha name; but the rules of formation and discipline for his troops, the interior economy of his infantry and cavalry, the regulations for his forts, his revenue and judicial arrangements, and the chief offices through which his government was administered were fully developed. Shivaji's infantry was raised in the West Deccan and Konkan; the men of the West Deccan tract were called M\u00e1valis or westerners, those of the Konkan Hetkaris or southerners. These men brought their own arms and required nothing but ammunition. Their dress, though not uniform, was generally a pair of short drawers coming half-way down the thigh, a strong narrow band of considerable length tightly girt about the loins, a turban, and sometimes a cotton frock. Most of them wore a cloth round the waist, which likewise answered the purposes of a shawl. Their common arms consisted of a sword shield and matchlock. Some of the Hetkaris, especially the infantry of S\u00e1vantv\u00e1di, used a species of firelock, the invention of the lock for the flint having been early received from the Portuguese. Every tenth man, instead of firearms, carried a bow and arrows which were useful in night attacks and surprises when firearms were kept in reserve or forbidden. The Hetkaris excelled as marksmen but they could seldom be brought to the desperate sword-in-hand attacks for which the M\u00e1valis were famous. Both of them had unusual skill in climbing, and could mount a precipice or scale a rock with ease, where men of other countries must have run great risk of being dashed to pieces. Every ten men had an officer called a n\u00e1ik and every fifty a havild\u00e1r. The officer over a hundred was termed juml\u00e1d\u00e1r and the commander of a thousand was styled ek-haz\u00e1ri. There were also officers of five thousand, between whom and the sarnobat or chief commander there was no intermediate step. The cavalry were of two kinds b\u00e1rgirs literally bridlemen or riders who were supplied with horses and shiled\u00e1rs who were self-horsed;\nShiv\u00e1ji's b\u00e1girs were generally mounted on horses, the property of the state. A body of this description was termed p\u00e1gh or household troops, and Shiv\u00e1ji always placed more dependence on them than on the shiled\u00e1rs or any horse furnished on contract by individuals: with both he had a proportion of his p\u00e1gh mixed, to overawe the disobedient and to perfect his system of intelligence which abroad and at home penetrated into a knowledge of the most private circumstances, prevented embezzlement, and frustrated treachery. The Mar\u00e1tha horsemen were commonly dressed in a pair of tight breeches covering the knee, a turban which many of them fastened by passing a fold of it under the chin, a frock of quilted cotton, and a cloth round the waist, with which they generally girded on their swords in preference to securing them with their belts. The horseman was armed with a sword and shield; a proportion in each body carried matchlocks, but the great national weapon was the spear, in the use of which and the management of their horses they showed both grace and skill. The spearmen had generally a sword and sometimes a shield; but the shield was unwieldy, and was carried only in case the spear should be broken.\n\nOver every twenty-five horsemen Shiv\u00e1ji had a havild\u00e1r. To one hundred and twenty-five there was a juml\u00e1d\u00e1r, and to every five juml\u00e1s or six hundred and twenty-five was a subhed\u00e1r. Every subha had an accountant and auditor of accounts appointed by Shiv\u00e1ji, who were liable to be changed and were invariably Br\u00e1hmans or Prabhus. To the command of every ten subh\u00e1s or six thousand two hundred and fifty horse, which were rated at only five thousand, there was a commander styled panch-haz\u00e1ri with whom were also stationed a muzumdd\u00e1r or Br\u00e1hman auditor of accounts and a Prabhu register and accountant who was called amin. These were government agents. Besides these every officer, from the juml\u00e1d\u00e1r upwards, had one or more k\u00e1rkuns or writers paid by himself as well as others in the pay of government. Except the sarnobat or chief no officer was superior to the commander of five thousand. There was one sarnobat for the cavalry and one for the infantry. Every jumla, subha, and panch-haz\u00e1r had an establishment of news-writers and spies besides secret intelligencers. Shiv\u00e1ji's head spy was a Mar\u00e1tha named Bahirji Naik, to whom, some of the Br\u00e1hmans readily admit, he owed many of the discoveries imputed to the goddess Bhav\u00e1ni. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are peculiarly roused from indolence and apathy when charged with responsibility. Shiv\u00e1ji at the beginning of his career personally inspected every man who offered himself, and obtained security from some persons already in his service for the fidelity and good conduct of those with whom he was not acquainted. This system of security must soon have made almost every man answerable for some of his comrades; and although it could have been in most instances but a form, owing to the ease with which the responsibility could be evaded, the demand of security was always a part of Shiv\u00e1ji's instructions to his officers. The M\u00e1valis sometimes enlisted, merely on condition of getting a subsistence... in grain; but the regular pay of the infantry was 6s. to \u00a31 4s. (1-3\npagod\u00e1s) a month; that of the b\u00e1rg\u00edrs or riders was 12s. to \u00a32 (2-5 pagod\u00e1s); and that of the shiled\u00e1rs or self-horsed cavaliers \u00a31 16s. to \u00a34 16s. (6-12 pagod\u00e1s) a month. All plunder as well as prizes was the property of government. It was brought at stated times to Shiv\u00e1ji's darb\u00e1r or place of public audience and individuals formally displayed and delivered their captures. They always received some small proportionate compensation; they were praised, distinguished, and promoted according to their success; and to plunder the enemy is to this day (1827) used by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s to express a victory, of which in their estimation it is the only real proof. The horse, especially at an advanced period of Shiv\u00e1ji's history, were subsisted during the fair season in the enemy's country; during the rains they were generally allowed to rest, and were cantoned in different places near kurans or pasture lands, under the protection of some fort, where the grass of the preceding season was stacked and grain prepared by the time they returned. For this purpose persons were appointed to whom rent-free lands were hereditarily assigned. This system was preserved when many of Shiv\u00e1ji's institutions were neglected, and it proved a great aid to the success of his countrymen.\n\nShiv\u00e1ji kept the Hindu festival of the Dasara with great pomp. It falls in October at the end of the south-west rains, and was particularly convenient for a general muster and review of his troops previous to their taking the field. At this time each horse was examined and an inventory and valuation of each soldier's effects were taken to be compared with what he brought back or eventually to be made good. If a horseman's effects were unavoidably lost, his horse killed, maimed, or destroyed in government service they were on due proof replaced. On the other hand all plunder or articles discovered, of which no satisfactory account could be given, were carried to the credit of government, either by confiscating the article or deducting the amount from the soldier's arrears. It was at the option of the captors to keep almost any articles if fairly brought forward, valued, and paid for. The accounts were closed every year, and balances due by government were paid either in ready money or by bills on the collectors of revenue in favour of the officers, but never by separate orders on villages. The only exceptions to plunder made by Shiv\u00e1ji were in favour of cows, cultivators, and women; these were never to be molested nor were any but rich Muhammadans or Hindus in their service who could pay a ransom to be made prisoners. No soldier in the service of Shiv\u00e1ji was permitted to carry any female followers with him to the field on pain of death. His system of intelligence was the greatest check on every abuse, and his punishments were rigorous. Officers and men who had distinguished themselves, who were wounded, or who had suffered in any way, were always gratified by promotion, honour, or compensation. Shiv\u00e1ji did not approve of the j\u00e1gir or estate system; he confirmed many, but, with the exception of the establishment for his forts, he seldom bestowed new military estates and gave away very few as personal\n\n---\n\n1 A pagoda was equal to from Rs. 3 to Rs. 4.\nassignments. *In\u00e1m* lands were granted by him as well in reward of merit as in conformity with the tenets of his faith; a gift of land, especially to Br\u00e1hmans, being of all charities the most acceptable to the divinity. Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s discipline, which required prompt obedience to superiors in every situation, was particularly strict in his forts. The chief person or *killed\u00e1r* in the command of a fortress was termed *havild\u00e1r* and under him there was one or more *sarnobats*. In large forts there was a *sarnobat* to each face. Every fort had a head clerk and a commissary of grain and stores; the head clerk a Br\u00e1hman was termed *sabnis*; the commissary was commonly of the Prabhu caste and was called *k\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00edis*. The orders regarding ingress and egress, rounds, watches, and patrols, care of water, grain, stores, and ammunition were most minute, and the head of each department was furnished with distinct rules for his guidance from which no deviation was allowed.\n\nA rigid economy characterised all Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s instructions regarding expenditure. The garrison was sometimes partly composed of the common infantry. Independent of them each fort had a separate and complete establishment. It consisted of Br\u00e1hmans, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, R\u00e1moshis, Mh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs; the whole were termed *gadkar\u00eds* or fort-men. They were maintained by permanent assignments of rent-free lands in the neighbourhood of each fort, which with the care of the fort passed from father to son. The R\u00e1moshis and Mh\u00e1rs were employed on outpost duty. They brought intelligence, watched all the paths, misled inquiries, or cut off hostile stragglers. This establishment while new and vigorous was admirably suited to Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s purpose as well as to the genius of the people. The *gadkar\u00eds* described the fort as the mother that fed them, and among other advantages, no plan could better provide for old or deserving soldiers.\n\nShiv\u00e1ji\u2019s revenue arrangements were founded on those of D\u00e1d\u00e1ji Kondad\u00e9v, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s Br\u00e1hman manager, to whom Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s education in Poona was entrusted (1645). The assessments were made on the actual state of the crop, the proportionate division of which is stated to have been three-fifths to the husbandmen and two-fifths to government. As soon as Shiv\u00e1ji got permanent possession of any territory, every species of military contribution was stopped, all farming of revenue ceased, and the collections were made by agents appointed by himself. Every two or three villages were superintended by a *k\u00e1rkun* under the *tarafd\u00e1r* or *t\u00e1lu\u00e9d\u00e1r* who had charge of a small district, and was either a Br\u00e1hman or a Prabhu. A Mar\u00e1tha *havild\u00e1r* was stationed with each of them. Over a considerable tract there was a *subhed\u00e1r* or *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r* who had charge of one or more forts in which his collections both of grain and money were secured. Shiv\u00e1ji never permitted the *deshmukhs* and *deshp\u00e1nd\u00e9s* to interfere in the management of the country; nor did he allow them to collect their dues until their amount had been ascertained, when an order was annually given for the amount. The *p\u00e1tils*, *khots*, and *kulkkarn\u00eds* were strictly superintended, and Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s government though popular with the common cultivators, would have been unpopular with village and district officers, of whom Shiv\u00e1ji was always jealous, had it not been for the resource which all had of entering his military service.\nThe method which the Br\u00e1hman ministers of the Mar\u00e1tha government afterwards adopted, of paying the military and civil servants by permanent assignments on portions of the revenue of villages, is said to have been early proposed to Shiv\u00e1ji. He objected to it, not only from fear of immediate oppression to the husbandmen, but from apprehending that it would in the end cause such a division of power as must weaken his government and encourage the village and district authorities to resist it as they frequently did that of Bij\u00e1pur. With the same view he destroyed all village walls and allowed no fortification in his territory which was not occupied by his troops. Religious establishments were carefully preserved, and temples for which no provision existed had some adequate assignments granted to them, but the Br\u00e1hmans in charge were obliged to account for the expenditure. Shiv\u00e1ji never sequestrated any allowance fixed by the Muhammadan government for the support of tombs, mosques, or saints\u2019 shrines. The revenue regulations of Shiv\u00e1ji were simple and in some respects judicious; but during his life it is impossible they could have been attended with such improvements and increase of population as are ascribed to them by his countrymen. His districts were frequently exposed to great ravages, and he never had sufficient leisure to complete his arrangements by that persevering superintendence which alone can perfect such institutions. The Muhammadan writers, and Fryer a contemporary English traveller describe his country as in the worst possible state, and the former only mention him as a depredator and destroyer. Still those districts taken by him from Bij\u00e1pur which had been under the management of farmers or direct agents of government probably experienced great benefit by the change.\n\nThe judicial system of Shiv\u00e1ji in civil cases was that of panch\u00e1yat or council which had invariably obtained in the country. Disputes among his soldiers were settled by their officers. He drew his criminal law from the Hindu sacred works or Sh\u00e1stras; but as the former rulers were Musalm\u00e1ns they had naturally introduced changes which custom had sanctioned and perpetuated. This accounts for the difference that may be still found between Hindu law and Mar\u00e1tha usage.\n\nTo aid in the conduct of his government, Shiv\u00e1ji established eight principal offices: 1st the Peshwa or head manager whose office was held by Moro Pant or Moreshvar Trimal Pingle; 2nd the Muzumd\u00e1r or general superintendent of finance and auditor general of accounts, whose office was held by \u00c1b\u00e1ji Sondev, subhed\u00e1r of the province of Kaly\u00e1n; 3rd the Surnis or general record-keeper, superintendent of correspondence, examiner of letters: the office was held by Ann\u00e1ji Datto; 4th the V\u00e1nknis or private record-keeper and superintendent of the household troops and establishment: the office was held by Datt\u00e1jipant; 5th the Sarnobat or chief captain of whom there were two Prat\u00e1pr\u00e1v Gujar over the cavalry and Yes\u00e1ji Kank over the infantry; 6th the Dabir or minister for foreign affairs, an office held by Somn\u00e1thpant; 7th the Ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish or superintendent of justice, an office managed by Nir\u00e1ji R\u00e1vji and Gom\u00e1ji Naik; and 8th the Ny\u00e1ya Sh\u00e1sstri or expounder of Hindu law an office held first by Shambhu Up\u00e1dhya and afterwards by Raghus\u00e1thpant.\nThe officers at the head of these civil situations, except the Ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish and Ny\u00e1ya Sh\u00e1stri, held military commands, and frequently had not leisure to superintend their duties. All therefore were aided by deputies called k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ris, who often had power to fix the seal or mark of their principals on public documents. When so empowered they were styled mut\u00e1l\u00edks. Each department and every district establishment had eight subordinate officers under whom were an adequate staff of assistants. These officers were, 1st the K\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri, Mut\u00e1l\u00edk, or Div\u00e1n; 2nd the Muzumddr or auditor and accountant; 3rd the Fadnis or Fadnavis deputy auditor and accountant; 4th the Sabnis or clerk sometimes styled daftard\u00e1r; 5th the K\u00e1rkhh\u00e1nnis or commissary; 6th the Chitnis or correspondence clerk; 7th the J\u00e1mdar or treasurer in charge of all valuables except cash; and 8th the Potnis or cashkeeper. Attached to himself, Shiv\u00e1ji had a treasurer, a correspondence clerk, and an accountant besides a Farisnis or Persian secretary. His clerk was a Prabhu named B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1vji, whose acuteness and intelligence were remarked by the English at Bombay on an occasion when he was sent there on business. B\u00e1lkrishnapant Hanvante, a near relation of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s head manager was Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s accountant. On Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s enthronement at R\u00e1ygad in 1674 the names of such offices as were formerly expressed in Persian were changed to Sanskrit and some were marked by higher sounding titles. There was only one commander-in-chief for the infantry and cavalry and one Ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish or judge.\n\nIn May 1673 a detachment of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s M\u00e1valis surprised Parli about four miles south-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Its capture put the Musalm\u00e1n garrisons on the alert, and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, a fort that had always been kept in good order by the Bij\u00e1pur government, which was next invested, sustained a siege of several months and did not surrender till the beginning of September. It is remarkable that this fort which had long, perhaps before the Adil Sh\u00e1hi dynasty, been used as a state prison, in time became the prison of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s descendants. The forts of Chandan, Vandan, P\u00e1ndugad, N\u00e1ngiri, and T\u00e1thvad all fell into Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s hands before the fair season. In 1675 Shiv\u00e1ji again possessed himself of all the posts between Panh\u00e1la in Kolh\u00e1pur and T\u00e1thvad. As soon as he was occupied in the Konkan and had carried down all the infantry that could be spared, Nimb\u00e1lkar and Gh\u00e1tge, the desmukhs of Phaltan and Malavdi, attacked Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s garrisons, drove out the posts and recovered most of the open country for Bij\u00e1pur.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 100-106.

To prevent future inroads by neighbouring proprietors Shiv\u00e1ji gave orders to connect the two places by a chain of forts, which he named Vardhangad, Bhushangad, Sad\u00e1shivgad, and Machhindragad. Although of no great strength they were well chosen to support his intermediate posts and to protect the highly productive tract within the frontier which they embrace. While engaged in this arrangement Shiv\u00e1ji was overtaken by a severe illness which confined him at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra for several months. During this period he became extravagantly rigid in the observance of religious forms, but he was at the same time planning the most important expedition of his life, the invasion of the Madras Karn\u00e1tak. The discussion of his legal claim to share in half his father's Karn\u00e1tak possessions and the possibility of making this a cloak for more extensive acquisitions in the south was a constant subject of consultation. While Shiv\u00e1ji was in the Karn\u00e1tak a body of horse belonging to Gh\u00e1tge and Nimb\u00e1lkar laid waste Panh\u00e1la in the south and retired plundering towards Karh\u00e1d. A detachment from Shiv\u00e1ji's army under Nil\u00e1ji K\u00e1tkar overtook them at Kurli, attacked and dispersed them, recovering much valuable property, which, as it belonged to his own subjects, Shiv\u00e1ji scrupulously restored.\n\nIn 1679, Shiv\u00e1ji's son Sambh\u00e1ji joined the Moghals. Diler Kh\u00e1n the Moghal general, intent on making Sambh\u00e1ji the head of a party in opposition to his father, sent a detachment of his army from before Bij\u00e1pur which they had invested, accompanied by Sambh\u00e1ji as R\u00e1ja of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and took Bhop\u00e1lga\u1e0d in the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-division Shiv\u00e1ji's easternmost outpost. At the time of his death in 1680, Shiv\u00e1ji, who during the last two years of his life had become an ally of Bij\u00e1pur against the Moghals, possessed that part of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra of which the line of forts built from T\u00e1thvad to Panh\u00e1la distinctly marked the eastern boundary. Shingnapur in the M\u00e1n sub-division in the east with the temple of Mah\u00e1dev was his hereditary in\u00e1m village given by one of the Gh\u00e1tges to his father Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji. R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi, Shiv\u00e1ji's friend and spiritual guide, whose life and conduct seem to have deserved the universal praise of his countrymen, a few days before Shiv\u00e1ji's death wrote Sambh\u00e1ji his elder son from Parli an excellent and judicious letter, advising him for the future rather than upbraiding him for the past, and pointing out the example of his father yet carefully abstaining from personal comparison.\n\nAfter Shiv\u00e1ji's death, R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m his younger son being placed on the Mar\u00e1tha throne at R\u00e1ygad in Kol\u00e1ba, Sambh\u00e1ji the elder son made his escape from Panh\u00e1la, and, having made himself master of his father's dominions, among others, put to death Soyar\u00e1b\u00e1i R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m's mother, and imprisoned R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m. A conspiracy in favour of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m was detected and it was discovered that it was supported by the whole of the Shirke family whose motive\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 120.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 123.\n3 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 127.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 130.\n5 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 133.\n6 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 134.\nwas revenge for the death of Soyar\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed who belonged to their family. Such of the Shirkes as could be found were executed and the rest fled and several of them entered into the Moghal service. Sambh\u00e1ji gave himself up to idleness and pleasure and the system which Shiv\u00e1ji had introduced soon fell into decay. Decay first appeared in the army where Shiv\u00e1ji's discipline and strict orders were neglected. When the horse took the field, stragglers were allowed to join, plunder was secreted, women followers who had been forbidden on pain of death were not only allowed but women were brought off from the enemy's country as an established article of plunder and either kept as concubines or sold as slaves. The booty brought back by the commanders of the horse was too small for the pay of the troops. They took the field in arrears and leave to keep part of the plunder was a natural compensation for the regular pay allowed by Shiv\u00e1ji. Sambh\u00e1ji was prodigal in his expenses and his minister and favourite, Kalusha a North Indian Br\u00e1hman, raised the land-rent by the addition of various cesses. When he came to collect the revenue he found the receipts much less than they had been in the time of Shiv\u00e1ji as the assessments were nominally greater. The managers of districts were in consequence removed for what seemed to him evident peculation. The revenue was farmed, many of the husbandmen fled from their villages, and the approach of a vast army of Moghals under Aurangzeb helped to complete the prospect of ruin to Shiv\u00e1ji's territory. In 1685 during this campaign Sult\u00e1n Muazzam lay at V\u00e1lva, and in the emperor's name took possession of such parts of the country as he could overrun. Deeds still remain in which Muazzam confirmed in his own name grants of lands originally given by Bij\u00e1pur generals. In October a pestilence broke out in his camp, swept off many of his men, and greatly diminished his force. Still on receiving the emperor's orders to reduce the south-west districts above the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, formerly taken by Shiv\u00e1ji from Bij\u00e1pur, he advanced without hesitation for that purpose.\n\nIn October 1686 Bij\u00e1pur fell to Aurangzeb, the Bij\u00e1pur government came to an end, and its territories passed to the Moghals. In the same year Shirze Kh\u00e1n of Bij\u00e1pur, who was sent to invade Sambh\u00e1ji's districts, marched towards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Mar\u00e1tha Mansabd\u00e1rs or men of title who had been in the service of Bij\u00e1pur, sent\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 142.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 147.\n3 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 151. In taking possession of a district the Moghals appointed two officers the fauzd\u00e1r a military and the kh\u00e1lsa div\u00e1n a civil officer. The fauzd\u00e1r, who was in command of a body of troops was charged with the care of the police and the protection of his division. He held, or, according to circumstances assumed, a greater or less degree of power. The regular amount allowed him for the maintenance of the district establishment was about 25 per cent of the government collections. The duties of the div\u00e1n were entirely civil and he was entrusted with the collection of the revenue whether for the exchequer or on account of a j\u00e1gird\u00e1r. The Moghal commander who received land grants or j\u00e1girs from the newly acquired territories seldom had lands permanently made over to them similar to the tenure by which the Mar\u00e1tha mansabd\u00e1rs held their possessions. The usual practice was to grant assignments for a term of years on specified districts for the support of their troops. Thus the fauzd\u00e1rs were more on the footing of feudatories than the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs. The fauzd\u00e1rs in conjunction with the div\u00e1ns farmed out the districts to the deshmukhs or deshtis and the div\u00e1ns realized the amount from them. Ditto, 154.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 151.\nprofessions of duty to the emperor, but showed no readiness to join his standard. Shirje Kh\u00e1n passed as far west as W\u00e1i where he was attacked and defeated by Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s chief captain Hambirr\u00e1v, a victory dearly bought by the death of Hambirr\u00e1v who fell mortally wounded. The advantage which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had gained was not neglected; several detachments pushed forward and occupied a great part of the open country towards Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nSambh\u00e1ji became careless of all general business and spent his time between Panh\u00e1l\u00e1 and Vish\u00e1l\u00edgad in Kolh\u00e1pur at a favourite house and garden in Sangameshvar in Ratn\u00e1giri. The whole power was in the hands of his favourite Kalusha whose time seems to have been more occupied in managing his master\u2019s humours than in attending to the business of the state. The discipline of the Mar\u00e1tha army became looser. Though ruinous to Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s resources as head of an organized state, this increased looseness had a wonderful effect in spreading predatory power. Every lawless man and every disbanded soldier, Muhammadan or Mar\u00e1tha, who could command a horse and a spear, joined the Mar\u00e1tha parties, and such adventurers were often enriched by the plunder of a day. Independent of other causes, a warlike spirit was thus excited among a people fond of money and disposed to predatory habits. The multitude of horsemen nurtured by former wars was already too heavy for the resources of the Mar\u00e1tha state. The proportion of the best troops which was kept in the Imperial service would probably have soon enabled Aurangzeb to suppress the disorder commonly attendant on Indian conquest had not the love of war and pillage been kindled among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. A pride in the conquests of Shiv\u00e1ji, their confidence in the strength of the forts, the skill and bravery of many of the Mar\u00e1tha leaders, the ability and influence of many of the Br\u00e1hmans, and the anger raised among Hindus by the odious poll-tax, excited a ferment which required not only vast means but an entire change of measures to allay.\n\nAurangzeb had great military and financial strength; he had considerable local knowledge, and in the first instance the same power of confirming or withholding hereditary right as his predecessors in conquest. Titles, mansabs, and j\u00e1girs were bestowed, and still more frequently promised with a liberality greater than that of any former conqueror. Still presumption, jealousy, and bigotry deprived him of many of those advantages. He was not fully aware of the strength of predatory power, and instead of crushing it by the aid of the established governments, he pulled down the two leading states of Golkonda and Bij\u00e1pur and raised nothing in their place. He involved himself with enemies on every side; he discharged the soldiery, whom, in addition to his own troops, he could not maintain, and thus sent armies into the field against himself. He supposed that he was not only acquainted with the details of the arrangements necessary in a newly conquered territory, but capable of superintending them. He placed little confidence in his agents, while at the same time he employed Muhammadans in\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 154.\nsituations for which policy and humanity alike advised the choice of Hindus. The confusion and disorder which followed could not be quieted by the emperor's fancied wisdom or by the flattery and praises of his court and countrymen. Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, especially Mar\u00e1thi-speaking Br\u00e1hmans, are less dazzled by show than Muhammadans, and soon found the weak points in their magnificent emperor. The powerful S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chiefs Daphle, Gh\u00e1tge, M\u00e1ne, and Nimb\u00e1lkar, during the siege of Bij\u00e1pur hovered round the imperial camp until the fall of the capital. They then withdrew to their estates, sending their agents with humble professions of duty, and in some cases attending themselves. Still from this time they became unsettled and joined plundering parties of their countrymen or submitted to the Moghals as circumstances invited or forced them. Few of the plunderers were independent of Sambh\u00e1ji's parties or of some of the local chiefs because the Moghal fauzd\u00e1r's troops were always too strong for common banditti. While their envoys were in the imperial camp professing obedience to Aurangzeb, the chiefs often sent parties to plunder the Moghal districts. In case of discovery their Br\u00e1hman agent, who, by bribery had secured the patronage of some great man at the Moghal court was ready to answer for or to excuse the irregular conduct of his master's followers. The Moghal fauzd\u00e1rs were told to please the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs on condition that they agreed to serve the Moghals. The chiefs were negotiating with the fauzd\u00e1r; their agents were intriguing at court; their own villages were secure; and their followers, hid under the vague name of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, were ravaging the country. The Moghal officers who had land assignments in the Deccan soon found that they could raise little revenue. Their corruption was increased by poverty, and the offenders who in the first instance had plundered their districts by purchasing the connivance of the fauzd\u00e1rs, bribed the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs at court with a part of the pillage. The hereditary rights and the family feuds which had before usefully served as an instrument of government, in the general confusion of the period became a cause of increasing disorder. The intricate nature of some of the hereditary claims in dispute and the ingenuity of Br\u00e1hmans who were always the managers made every case so plausible that the officers of government found little difficulty in excusing or at least in palliating many acts of gross injustice to which they scandalously lent themselves. The rightful owners had often reason for complaint; they absented themselves with their troops, joined the plunderers, and when induced or compelled to come in they boldly justified their behaviour by the injustice they had suffered.\n\nWhen an hereditary office was forfeited or became vacant in any way the Moghal government selected a candidate on whom it was conferred; but the established premium of the exchequer was upwards of six and a half year's purchase or precisely 651 per cent on one year's emoluments, one-fourth of which was made payable at the time of delivering the deeds and the remainder by instalments. Besides this tax the clerks exacted an infinite number of fees or perquisites all of which lent encouragement to confiscations and new appointments. The emperor, weighed down by years, was\nsoon overwhelmed with pressing cares; his ministers and their underlings were alike negligent and corrupt; even after deeds and papers were prepared years passed before the orders they contained were carried out. Aurangzeb spent about three years at Bijapur (1686-1689). During this time his arms were everywhere successful. In Sambhaji's Deccan districts nothing but the strong forts remained unsubdued (1689). The Moghal troops had possessed themselves of T\u00e1thvad and the range of forts built by Shiv\u00e1ji between that place and Panhala, and Aurangzeb was now preparing to enter on a regular plan for reducing the whole of the forts, as, in his opinion, this was all that remained to complete the conquest he had so long meditated. His plans were thwarted by the terrible outbreak of plague which forced him to leave Bijapur and pass north to Brahmapuri in Sholapur.\n\nIn 1689 Sambhaji was surprised at Sangameshvar in Ratnagiri. He was carried in triumph to Aurangzeb's camp at Akhuj in Sholapur, and as he refused to become a Musalm\u00e1n and insulted the Prophet Muhammad and Aurangzeb, he was executed at Tulapur in Poona on the Indrayani. So unpopular had Sambhaji become that no attempt was made to rescue him or to avenge his death. At R\u00e1y\u00e1gad, on the news of Sambhaji's death, his younger brother R\u00e1j\u00e1ram was declared regent during the minority of Sambhaji's son Shiv\u00e1ji afterwards known as Sh\u00e1hu. In 1690 R\u00e1y\u00e1gad the Mar\u00e1tha capital fell to the Moghals and young Shiv\u00e1ji and his mother Yesub\u00e1i were made prisoners and taken to the Moghal camp. Shiv\u00e1ji's sword Bhav\u00e1ni and the sword of Afzul Kh\u00e1n were taken by the Moghals. Yesub\u00e1i and her son found a friend in Begam S\u00e1heb the daughter of Aurangzeb, and the emperor himself became partial to the boy whom he named Sh\u00e1hu. R\u00e1j\u00e1ram moved from place to place and afterwards made Ginji about eighty miles south-west of Madras his head-quarters. In a fresh arrangement of state offices made at this time Sant\u00e1ji Ghorpade the oldest representative of the K\u00e1phi family was made senapati or chief captain and dignified with the title of Hindu R\u00e1v Mamlakat Mad\u00e1r. He was also entrusted with a new standard called the jariipatka or Golden Streamer, and in imitation of the imperial officers of the highest rank he was authorized to beat the nobat or large drum and assume various other signs of rank. R\u00e1j\u00e1ram at this time created a new office called Pratinidhi or the king's likeness and conferred it on Pralh\u00e1d-Nir\u00e1ji who at this time was the soul of the Mar\u00e1tha cause.\n\nWhile R\u00e1j\u00e1ram was at Ginji, R\u00e1mchandrapant B\u00e1vdekar one of the principal men of the time was left with the title of Hukmat Panha in charge of all the forts and possessing all the powers of government, and under him was placed Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak who from the humble situation of hereditary kulkarn\u00ed of Kinhai had brought himself into notice and had given proofs of intelligence and spirit. These officers used great exertions in restoring forts and giving spirit and zeal to the garrisons. R\u00e1mchandrapant moved from place to place, but fixed his principal residence at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, where, by the aid of\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 155-158.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 158.\nhis head writer Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Gaudekar, he not only attended to every military disposition, but regulated the revenue and established order. He had raised troops of his own and had cut off several straggling parties of Moghals before Sant\u00e1ji and Dhan\u00e1ji returned from Ginji. When they joined him R\u00e1mchandrapant proposed a plan for surprising the fauzd\u00e1r at W\u00e1i to which Sant\u00e1ji greatly pleased immediately agreed, took the fauzd\u00e1r with all his troops prisoners, and in their stead established a Mar\u00e1tha post. The presence of Sant\u00e1ji and Dhan\u00e1ji inspirited R\u00e1mchandrapant\u2019s men and he stirred his captains to follow their example. He sent them to make their established collections the chauth and sardeshmukhi, as they were termed, from the Moghal territory, and under the encouragement of success his officers added a third contribution for themselves under the head of gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na or forage money. In this manner a new army was raised whose leaders were Pov\u00e1r, Thor\u00e1t, and \u00c1thavle. R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m gave them honorary presents and rewards; the title of Vishr\u00e1sr\u00e1v was conferred on Pov\u00e1r, of Dinkarr\u00e1v on Thor\u00e1t, and of Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur on \u00c1thavle. R\u00e1mchandrapant was particularly partial to the Dhangers or shepherds a great number of whom served among his troops; and many of the ancestors of those who afterwards became great chiefs in the empire began their career under R\u00e1mchandrapant. Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, known as an able officer, received charge of W\u00e1i. Ginji in which R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m was besieged fell to the Moghals in January 1698. But a few days before the fall R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m was allowed to escape and came in safety to Vish\u00e1lga\u1e0d in Kolh\u00e1pur. In 1699 R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m remained for a short time at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra which at the recommendation of R\u00e1mchandrapant he made the seat of government and then passed north with his army plundering. On hearing of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m\u2019s return Aurangzeb marched west from Brahmapuri in Shol\u00e1pur and encamped under the fort of Vasantgad about seven miles north-west of Karh\u00e1d. Batteries were prepared and in three days the garrison surrendered. The emperor named the fort Kalid-i-fateh or the Key of Victory and was much pleased with his success. Aurangzeb marched for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, a movement wholly unexpected by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who, filled with the idea that Panh\u00e1la in Kolh\u00e1pur was about to be besieged, had directed all their preparations towards its defence. The provisions in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort were not enough to stand more than a two months\u2019 siege. This neglect roused the suspicion that R\u00e1mchandrapant had purposely left it unprovided. Of this suspicion Aurangzeb took advantage, and when during the siege, in consequence of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m\u2019s illness, R\u00e1mchandrapant was called to Sinhgad in Poona, Aurangzeb wrote a letter which fell into the hands of Parashur\u00e1m Trimba\u1e45k and widened the breach which had for some time existed between him and R\u00e1mchandrapant. On arriving before S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Aurangzeb pitched his tents to the north of the fort on the site of the present village of Karinja. A\u2019zam Sh\u00e1h was stationed at a village on the west side which has since borne the name of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur. Shirze Kh\u00e1n invested the south side and Tarbiyat Kh\u00e1n occupied the eastern quarter; and chains of posts between\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Du ff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 166.  \n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 171.  \n3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 172.\nthe different camps effectually secured the blockade. The fort which occupies the summit of a very steep hill of moderate height, and whose defences consist of a sheer scarp of over forty feet topped by a stone wall, was defended by Pry\u00e1gji Prabhu Havild\u00e1r, who had been reared in the service of Shiv\u00e1ji. He vigorously opposed the Moghals, and disputed every foot of ground as they pushed forward their advanced posts. As soon as they began to gain any part of the hill he withdrew his troops into the fort and rolled huge stones from the rock above, which did great execution, and, until they threw up cover, were as destructive as artillery. In spite of Pry\u00e1gji's efforts the blockade was completed. All communication with the country round was cut off; and as the small stock of grain was soon exhausted, the besieged must have been forced to surrender had not Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak, who had thrown himself into the fort of Parli, bought the connivance of A'zam Sh\u00e1h and brought provisions to the besieged. The divisions on the west and south faces raised batteries, but the grand attack was directed against the north-east angle, one of the strongest points with a total height of sixty-seven feet of which forty-two were rock and twenty-five were masonry.\n\nTarbiyat Kh\u00e1n undertook to mine this angle, and at the end of four months and a half (1700) completed two mines. So confident of success were the Moghals, that the storming party was ready formed, but concealed as much as possible under the brow of the hill from the view of the garrison. Aurangzeb was invited to view the spectacle, and to draw the garrison towards the bastion the emperor moved off from that side in grand procession, so that when the match was ready, hundreds of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, drawn by his splendid retinue crowded to the rampart. Among them was Pry\u00e1gji the commandant. The first mine was fired. It burst several fissures in the rock, and caused so violent a shock that a great part of the masonry was thrown inwards and crushed many of the garrison in its ruins. The storming party in their eagerness advanced nearer; the match was applied to the train of the second and larger mine, but it was wrongly laid and burst out with a dreadful explosion, destroying, it is said, upwards of 2000 Moghals on the spot. Pry\u00e1gji the Mar\u00e1tha commandant was buried in the ruins caused by the first explosion close to a temple dedicated to the goddess Bhav\u00e1ni, but was afterwards dug out alive. His escape was considered a lucky omen, and under other circumstances might have done much to inspirit the garrison to prolong the defence. But as A'zam Sh\u00e1h could no longer be persuaded to allow grain to pass into the fort, proposals of surrender were made through him, and the honour of the capture which he so ill-deserved was not only assigned to him, but the place received his name and was called by the emperor \u00c1zam T\u00e1ra. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra surrendered about the middle of April 1700. Immediately on the fall of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Parli was invested. The siege lasted till the beginning of June, when, after a good defence, the garrison left the fort. The fort was called by the emperor Nauras T\u00e1ra. As the south-west monsoon burst with great violence, the Moghal army, which was unprepared, suffered much distress and hardship before the camp could be\nmoved from the hills. After much loss both of baggage and of life, the army reached Khav\u00e1spur on the banks of the M\u00e1n in Shol\u00e1pur, where the rains are comparatively light.\\(^1\\)\n\nA raid of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m's against J\u00e1lna about fifty miles east of Aurangabad was met so vigorously by Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, the only Moghal general of whom the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s then stood in fear, that R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m was forced to fly. So hot was the pursuit that though he managed to escape he died of exhaustion at Sinhgad in Poona in the middle of March 1700, a month before the fall of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\\(^2\\) The news of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m's death was received in the emperor's camp at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with great rejoicing. T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m's elder widow, who, with the aid of R\u00e1mc\u00e1ndrapant Am\u00e1tya had immediately assumed the government for her son Shiv\u00e1j\u00ed a boy of ten, raised Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak to the rank of Prat\u00ednidhi, and placed him in general charge of all the forts.

In 1701 besides several other forts in Poona and Kolh\u00e1pur, Chandan Vandan and P\u00e1ndugad surrendered to his officers.\\(^5\\) But these apparently vigorous efforts were unsubstantial; there was motion and bustle without zeal or efficiency. The empire was unwieldy, its system relaxed, and its officers corrupt beyond all example. It was inwardly decayed, and ready to fall to pieces as much by its inherent weakness as by the corroding power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s whom the Muhammadan wars had trained to arms. Though the weakness of the government tempted them to plunder, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had not yet the feeling of conquerors. There was a common sympathy but no common effort; their military spirit was excited by plunder, not by patriotism. Many enjoyed greater advantages under the weak Moghals than they were likely to enjoy under a strong Mar\u00e1tha government, and these were eager that war should not cease. Many Moghal officers in charge of districts were in the pay of both parties, and they also had no wish that the confusion should end. Parties of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the service of the Moghals met, rioted, and feasted with their countrymen, and at parting or when passing within hearing of each other used to mock the Muhammadans by uttering an alhamd\u00e1lil\u00e1h Praise be to Allah, and praying for long life to the glorious Alamgir whose mode of warfare made their life so easy.\n\nSome of the Moghal officers were anxious to negotiate a peace and K\u00e1m Bakhsha the favourite son of the emperor, whose early plans were directed to the establishment of an independent kingdom at Bij\u00e1pur, contrived to obtain the emperor's consent to open a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 174-175.

Overtures were begun by proposals for releasing Sh\u00e1hu the son of Sambh\u00e1ji. The negotiations proceeded and for a few days Aurangzeb had been brought to agree to pay ten per cent of the whole revenue of the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan as sardeshmukhi for which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were to engage to maintain order with a body of horse. On the news of this concession the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who, notwithstanding their predatory character were at all times exceedingly eager to have any right formally recognized, flocked to Dhan\u00e1ji's camp. With their increasing numbers their expectations and their insolence rose. Their tone changed from prayer to demand, they crowded near the camp, and when they required honorary dresses for seventy officers, Aurangzeb suspected treachery, broke off the negotiation, and recalled his ambassador. Soon after he left the Mar\u00e1tha camp the Moghal ambassador was attacked, and as this confirmed the emperor's suspicion of treachery he withdrew to the east.\n\nIn 1705 T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i went to live at Panh\u00e1la in Kolhapur and admitted R\u00e1mchandrapant to a very large share of power. In the following year Vasantgad and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were taken by the Pratinidhi Parshur\u00e1m Trimbak. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was surprised by the artifice of a Br\u00e1hman named Ann\u00e1jipant. This man had escaped from prison at Ginji and assumed the character of a mendicant devotee. He fell in with a party of Moghal infantry marching to relieve the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra garrison, amused them with stories and songs, obtained alms from them, and so ingratiated himself with all that they brought him with them, admitted him into the fort and in reward for his wit allowed him to live there. Ann\u00e1jipant, who had been a writer attached to a body of M\u00e1vali infantry, saw that with the aid of a few of his old friends the place might be surprised. He watched his chance, told Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak of his design, and having introduced a body of M\u00e1valis into the fort the enterprising and remorseless Br\u00e1hman put every man of the garrison to the sword.\n\nAurangzeb died in 1707. By the advice of Zulfiq\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n Aurangzeb's second son, prince A'zam Sh\u00e1h, determined to release Sh\u00e1hu and promised that if he succeeded in establishing his authority and continued steadfast in his allegiance he should receive the tract conquered from Bij\u00e1pur by his grandfather Shiv\u00e1ji. On Sh\u00e1hu's approach T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, unwilling to lose the power she had so long held, pretended to believe him an impostor and determined to oppose him, and chose Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan to defend the western hill country. But Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav was detached from her cause and the Pratinidhi finding he was not supported fled to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Sh\u00e1hu, joined by Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav, advanced and took Chandan Vandan. He seized the families of all who were acting against him and sent an order to Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak to surrender S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Parashur\u00e1m did not obey, but Shaikh Mir\u00e1h a Muhammadan officer who commanded\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 179.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 180.\n3 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 185.\nunder him confined him and gave up the fort. On gaining possession of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Sh\u00e1hu formally seated himself on the throne in March 1708. Gad\u00e1dhar Pralh\u00e1d was appointed Prat\u00ednidhi and Bahiropant Pingle was made Peshwa. Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav was confirmed in his rank of Sen\u00e1pati or chief captain and the right of making collections in several districts was entrusted to him. In the prevailing confusion the revenue was realized on no fixed principle, but was levied as opportunity presented itself in the manner of contribution. The principal writers employed by Dhan\u00e1ji in revenue affairs were \u00c1'b\u00e1ji Purandhare accountant of S\u00e1svad in Poona, and another Br\u00e1hman accountant of Shr\u00edvardhan in Janjira, a village claimed by the Sidi, from which, in consequence of some intrigue connected with the Sidi's enemy, \u00c1ngria, he had fled to S\u00e1svad and had been recommended to Dhan\u00e1ji by \u00c1'b\u00e1ji Purandhare and Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak. The name of the Shr\u00edvardhan accountant, afterwards famous as the founder of the Peshwa's power, was B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th Bhatt. During the rains of 1708, Sh\u00e1hu's army was cantoned at Chandan Vandan and he neglected no preparations to enable him to reduce his rival. Among other expedients he made an unsuccessful application to Sir Nicholas Waite the Governor of Bombay for a supply of guns, ammunition, European soldiers, and money.\n\nAt the opening of the fair season, after holding the Dasara holiday, preparations were made to renew the war against T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i (1709). Panh\u00e1la and Vish\u00e1lga\u1e0d, two of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i's forts, were taken, and Sh\u00e1hu, on the approach of the next rains, retired to Kolhap\u00far where he cantoned his troops. In October 1709, on the opening of the fair season, Sh\u00e1hu intended to renew the war, but about that time an agreement with the Moghals waived the question of hereditary claim and made the reduction of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i less important to Sh\u00e1hu. D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n Panni, whom Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n left as his deputy in the Deccan, settled with such Mar\u00e1tha chiefs as acknowledged Sh\u00e1hu's authority, with certain reservations, to allow them one-fourth of the revenue, at the same time reserving the right of collecting and paying it through his own agents. D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n's intimacy with most of the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs, his connection with Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, and the terms of friendship between Zulfik\u00e1r and Sh\u00e1hu, not only preserved Sh\u00e1hu's ascendancy, but, except in instances where independent plundering bands occasionally appeared, secured a fairly correct observance of the terms of the agreement. At the close of 1709 Sh\u00e1hu returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and married two wives, one from the Mohite and the other from the Shirke family. His other two wives who were married to him while in Aurangzeb's camp were with his mother at Delhi, where one of them the daughter of Sindia shortly afterwards died. Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav, after a long illness, died on his way from Kolhap\u00far on the banks of the V\u00e1rna. His writer B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th had accompanied him on that service, and during his last sickness had the management of all his affairs. This brought on B\u00e1l\u00e1ji the keen jealousy of Dhan\u00e1ji's son Chandrasen J\u00e1dhav, and\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Marath\u00e1s, 185-186.\n2 Bruce's Annals in Grant Duff's Marath\u00e1s, 187.\n3 Grant Duff's Marath\u00e1s, 187.\nof several Br\u0101hmans in his service. In 1710, the army had scarcely returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, when T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, encouraged by the commandant of Panh\u00e1la, marched from M\u00e1lvan in Ratn\u00e1giri reinforced by the troops of Phond S\u00e1vant, and made Panh\u00e1la and the neighbouring town of Kolh\u00e1pur her residence. Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan the Pant Sachiv maintained T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i\u2019s cause and Sh\u00e1hu determined to reduce him instead of renewing his attack on Panh\u00e1la. About this time Sh\u00e1hu thought of moving his capital to Ahmadnagar, but as this gave offence to Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, Sh\u00e1hu at his desire gave up the idea. In 1711 an army marching towards Poona succeeded in gaining R\u00e1jgad, but as most of the Sachiv\u2019s forts were stored with provisions and garrisoned Sh\u00e1hu was relieved from the risk of a defeat in reducing them by the Pant Sachiv\u2019s death, who drowned himself, it was said, from grief that the oath he had taken to T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i forced him to fight against his lawful prince.\n\nIn January 1712 Shiv\u00e1ji the son of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i who was an idiot died of small-pox. R\u00e1mchandrapant seized the opportunity to remove T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i from the administration and to place Sambh\u00e1ji the son of R\u00e1jasb\u00e1i the younger wife of Raj\u00e1ram in her stead, and exerted himself with renewed vigour. Still so long as D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n\u2019s government continued Sh\u00e1hu was secured in the ascendancy. He was surrounded by most of the experienced ministers and was entirely free from the cruelty and love of excess which his enemies gave out he inherited from his father Sambh\u00e1ji. The loss of Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan the Pant Sachiv was a severe blow to the opposite party, and Sh\u00e1hu, with the tact and temper for which he was deservedly applauded, despatched clothes of investiture to Shankr\u00e1ji\u2019s son N\u00e1ro Shankar then a babe of two years. At the same time he confirmed in his situation Shankr\u00e1ji\u2019s mut\u00e1l\u00edk or chief agent. This measure secured to Sh\u00e1hu the support of the Pant Sachiv\u2019s party, who never afterwards departed from their allegiance. Sh\u00e1hu was not equally successful in binding to his interest all the members of the Pratinidhi\u2019s family. In 1713 Sh\u00e1hu released Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak, restored his honours by the removal of Gad\u00e1-dhar Pralh\u00e1d, and confirmed him in his formal charge of Vish\u00e1l\u00edga\u1e0d and its dependencies. The Pratinidhi sent his eldest son Krishn\u00e1ji Bh\u00e1skar to assume the management of the fort and district, but he had no sooner obtained possession than he revolted, tendered his services to Sambh\u00e1ji and was made Pratinidhi at Kolh\u00e1pur. On this defection Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak was again thrown into confinement, and Sh\u00e1hu, under the belief that the revolt had been encouraged by him, intended to have put him to death but was dissuaded from his design. In consequence of changes at the Imperial court, D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n was removed from the government of the Deccan and the agreement between the Moghals and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 188. He performed the jal sam\u00e1dh or water-death a form of death to which Hindu devotees were partial. The victim seated himself on a wooden platform supported in deep water by earthen pots with their mouths turned down. Small holes were bored in the earthen pots and the platform sank.\n\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 189.\nwas dissolved. Chandrasen Jadhav, who on the death of his father Dhanaji Jadhav had been appointed chief captain, was sent from Satara with a considerable army and directed to levy the chauth, sardeshmukhi, and gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na from the Moghal districts. He was attended by his father's writer B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th who was now charged with collecting and appropriating a share of the revenue for Sh\u00e1hu, a situation of control which, under no circumstances, was likely to be favourably viewed by Chandrasen. The old jealousy was increased tenfold, and in a dispute about a deer run down by one of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's horsemen, the suppressed hatred burst forth. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji was forced to flee for his life. He fled first to S\u00e1svad in Poona but the Sachiv's agent at S\u00e1svad did not think it prudent to protect him. With a few followers, amongst whom were his sons B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Chimn\u00e1ji, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji attempted to cross to P\u00e1ndugad a fort in the opposite valley, but Chandrasen's horsemen were already on histrack searching for him everywhere. In this extremity he contrived to hide for a few days until two Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Pil\u00e1ji Jadhav and Dhumal, then common cavaliers in his service, by their influence with their relations, gathered a small troop of horse, and promised at the risk of their lives to carry him and his sons to the m\u00e1chi or village attached to the hill fort of P\u00e1ndugad. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji was so little of a horseman that he required a man on each side to hold him on. In spite of this disadvantage the horsemen fought their way to the fort and B\u00e1l\u00e1ji was protected by Sh\u00e1hu's orders. Chandrasen demanded that B\u00e1l\u00e1ji should be given up, and in case of refusal threatened to renounce his allegiance. Sh\u00e1hu, though not prepared to punish this insolent demand, refused to give up B\u00e1l\u00e1ji and sent orders to Haibatr\u00e1v Nimb\u00e1lkar, Sar Lashkar, then near Ahmadnagar at once to march on Satara. Meanwhile B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th was in P\u00e1ndugad surrounded by the Sen\u00e1pati's troops. Haibatr\u00e1v, who was annoyed that he had not been made Sen\u00e1pati and was incensed at Chandrasen's behaviour, eagerly obeyed the order to march against him. Hearing of Haibatr\u00e1v's arrival at Phaltan Chandrasen quitted P\u00e1ndugad and marched to Devur about fifteen miles to the south-east. The armies met, Chandrasen was defeated, retired to Kolhapur, and from Kolhapur went to meet Chin Kilich Kh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk the Moghal viceroy of the Deccan, by whom he was well received and rewarded. Chandrasen for revenge and Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk who was disposed to favour the cause of Sambh\u00e1ji and desirous of suppressing the ravages of Sh\u00e1hu's officers sent an army against Haibatr\u00e1v. To support him Sh\u00e1hu sent forward a body of troops under B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th whom he now dignified with the title of sena kurt or army agent. A battle was fought near Purandhar in Poona, in which the advantage claimed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s is contradicted by their subsequent retreat to the Salpa pass twenty miles south of Purandhar. A detachment of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from the Moghal army took possession of the Poona district. At length an accommodation was made, hostilities ceased, and the Moghals returned to Aurangabad. When the war was over\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 189-191.\nthe emperor Feroksher appointed Sh\u00e1hu to the command of 10,000 horse. But for seventeen months the policy and vigour of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk greatly controlled the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. During the rains of 1714 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s resumed their depredations. All the deshmukhs and deshp\u00e1ndes in the Moghal districts of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra fortified their villages on pretence of defending themselves, but they frequently joined or aided their countrymen of whatever party in escape, defence, and concealment.\n\nAs Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk favoured the Kolh\u00e1pur party Sambh\u00e1ji\u2019s influence rose and Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s fell. The Ghorpades, both of K\u00e1pshi and Mudhol, joined the Kolh\u00e1pur party. Sidoji Ghorpade, the son of Bahirji and nephew of the famous Sant\u00e1ji also declared for Sambh\u00e1ji, but, along with his ally the Naw\u00e1b of S\u00e1vanur was too intent on his schemes of conquest and plunder to quit the Karn\u00e1tak. Krishnar\u00e1v Khat\u00e1vkar, a Br\u00e1hman, raised to power by the Moghals, took post about the Mah\u00e1dev hills within S\u00e1t\u00e1ra limits, and without joining either S\u00e1t\u00e1ra or Kolh\u00e1pur plundered the country on his own account. Dam\u00e1ji Thor\u00e1t, a lawless ruffian of the Kolh\u00e1pur party who acknowledged no chief but his old patron R\u00e1mchandrapant, levied contributions in Poona. Ud\u00e1ji Chavh\u00e1n, another of R\u00e1mchandra\u2019s officers took the mud fort of Battis Shir\u00e1l\u00e1 about twenty miles south of Karh\u00e1d, and in a short time became so formidable that Sh\u00e1hu was glad to enter into a compromise by conceding the chauth of Shir\u00e1l\u00e1 and Karh\u00e1d, which Ud\u00e1ji long continued to receive as a personal allowance. Several other petty wasters declared for Sambh\u00e1ji. Among these the most formidable was K\u00e1nhoji \u00c1ngria who then held the coast from S\u00e1vantv\u00e1di to Bombay, and was spreading his power over the province of Kaly\u00e1n in Th\u00e1na. So great was the anarchy that, without a sudden change of fortune and greater efficiency in Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s government, his authority over the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s must soon have ceased. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th instilled some vigour into his councils and began to lead in public affairs. He set out to reduce Dam\u00e1ji Thor\u00e1t; but, together with his friend Ab\u00e1ji Purandhare, and his two sons B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Chimn\u00e1ji, he was treacherously seized by Thor\u00e1t and thrown into confinement. After many indignities their ransom was settled and paid by Sh\u00e1hu who now applied to the Sachiv to suppress Thor\u00e1t. The Sachiv and his manager advanced against Thor\u00e1t, but they too were defeated and thrown into confinement. At the same time two other expeditions were prepared at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, one under the Peshwa Bahiropant Pingle which went to guard the Konkan and repel \u00c1ngria and the other commanded by B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th was ordered to suppress Krishnar\u00e1v Khat\u00e1vkar. Krishnar\u00e1v had become so bold that he marched to Aundh about ten miles south of Khat\u00e1v, to meet Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s troops. He was totally defeated principally through the bravery of\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 195.\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 191. Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de who acknowledged Sh\u00e1hu as his chief and had established himself about N\u00e1ndod in Rajpipla committed several robberies at this time in Gujar\u00e1t.\n3 About this time Sidoji gained a great acquisition in the fort of Sondur a place of singular strength within twenty-five miles of Bel\u00e1ri. Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 192.\nShripatrav, the second son of Parashuram Trimbak the Pratinidhi, whose father had urged him to perform some action which might wipe away the misconduct of his elder brother and procure his father's release. Shahu accordingly once more restored the Pratinidhi to liberty and rank. Krishnarav submitted, was pardoned, and received the village of Khatav. This success was of considerable importance, but a like good fortune did not attend the Peshwa's expedition. Bahiropant was defeated and made prisoner by Angria who took Lohogad and Rajmachi in West Poona, and was reported to be marching on Satara. All the force that could be spared was gathered to oppose him. It was placed under Balaji Vishvanath whose former connection with Angria would, it was hoped, lead to some settlement. Balaji's negotiations were successful, and Angria, on condition of large cessions in the Konkan, gave up his Deccan conquests except Rajmachi, renounced Sambhaji, released the Peshwa, and agreed to maintain the cause of Shahu. As Balaji performed this service entirely to Shahu's wishes, on his return to Satara he was received with great distinction, and in consequence of the failure of Bahiropant Pingle, that minister was removed from the dignity of Mukhya Pradhana and Balaji appointed Peshwa in his stead (1714). His friend Abaji Purandhare was confirmed as his chief agent or mutalik and Ramajipant Bhaniu an ancestor of the celebrated Nana Fadnavis as his fadnavis.\n\nAfter the desertion of Chandrasen Jadhav, Manaji More had received clothes of investiture as chief captain or Senapati, but failed to perform the services which were expected of him. He was now ordered, with Haibatrav Nimbalkar, to accompany Balaji into the Poona district to reduce Damaji Thorat. As it was feared that the Sachiv, who was still Thorat's prisoner at Hingangaon in Poona, might be killed if the place were attacked, Yesubai the Pant Sachiv's mother prevailed on Balaji to endeavour to obtain his release before hostilities began. In this Balaji succeeded, and Yesubai in gratitude made over to the Peshwa the Sachiv's rights in the Poona district and gave him the fort of Purandhar as a place of refuge for his family who then lived in Sasvad. Balaji obtained a confirmation of the grant of Purandhar from Shahu who thus unconsciously forged the first link in the chain which fettered his own power and reduced his successors to pageants and prisoners. The force assembled was too powerful for Thorat. His fort was stormed and destroyed and himself made prisoner.\n\nIn 1715 Haibatrav quarrelled with Shahu for not appointing him Senapati, retired to the Godavari, and was never reconciled. The Peshwa induced the Moghal agent in the Poona district, a Maratha named Baji Kadam, to make over the superior authority\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Marathas, 193.

Ditto.}\n\nIn all quarters Mar\u00e1tha affairs began to improve. Still after a period of such confusion, weakness, and anarchy, the rapid expansion of their power is in any view very remarkable and at first sight seems incredible. The influence of B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th continued to increase and no affair of importance was undertaken without his advice. A conciliatory policy was agreeable to Sh\u00e1hu and dictated all B\u00e1j\u00e1ji's measures. The system of Shiv\u00e1ji was the groundwork of their arrangements; but since the time of Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed (1680-1689), the necessity of preserving the R\u00e1ja's supremacy by profusely issuing deeds confirming to every successful Mar\u00e1tha leader the possession of all the territory in which he could establish himself, was ruinous both to their union and their resources as a nation. Still the nature of the tribute which Shiv\u00e1ji's genius had instituted suggested a remedy for the endless divisions which every additional acquisition of territory was likely to create. The expedient adopted, which is given below, although it insured its end only for a time, is the most ingenious as well as the deepest scheme of Br\u00e1hman policy which is to be found unconnected with their religious system.\n\nThe ministry as far as practicable was composed of the old retainers, and the posts of those who adhered to the Kolh\u00e1pur party were conferred on their relations. The details of the ministry in 1715 were:\n\n| Title          | Name                  |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Pratinidhi     | Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak    |\n| The Eight Ministers |                     |\n| Peshwa or Mukhya | B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th, Amb\u00e1r\u00e1v B\u00e1pu Hanvante, N\u00e1ro Shankar |\n| Pradh\u00e1n        |                       |\n| Am\u00e1tya         |                       |\n| Sachiv         |                       |\n\nAbout this time both Parsoji Bhonsla and Haibatr\u00e1v Nimbalkar died. Parsoji's son K\u00e1nhoji was confirmed by Sh\u00e1hu in all his father's possessions and succeeded to his title of Sena S\u00e1heb Subha, but the rank of Sar Lashkar was conferred on Dh\u00e1valshi Somavshi together with the right and honours of the post. Haibatr\u00e1v's son, annoyed at being set aside, quitted Sh\u00e1hu's standard and joined Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. Sh\u00e1hu was not without ability. He was naturally generous, liberal to all religious establishments, observant of the forms enjoined by the Hindu faith, and particularly charitable to Br\u00e1hmans. The hilly west Deccan and the rugged Konkan were his birthright, but as his childhood was pleasantly spent in the pomp and luxury of the Moghal camp his habits were those of a Musalm\u00e1n. He occasionally showed the violence of the Mar\u00e1tha character, and for the time anger overcame his indolence. In general he was satisfied with the respect and homage paid to his person and the\nobedience which his ministers invariably professed to his commands. He was pleased at being free from the drudgery of business and in giving himself up to his fondness for hawking, hunting, and fishing, he did not foresee that he was delegating a power which might supersede his own. As legitimate head of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the importance of that nation was increased by the manner in which he was courted by the Moghals; and the dignities and rights conferred upon him in consequence of his situation gave an influence and respect to the name of Sh\u00e1hu, which under other circumstances he could never have attained. Both the sons of Shiv\u00e1ji, Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed and R\u00e1jar\u00e1m, followed the example of their father from the period when he mounted the throne and always declared their independence. Sh\u00e1hu acknowledged himself a vassal of the throne of Delhi, and while styling himself king of the Hindus, affected, in his transactions with the Moghals, to consider himself merely as a zamind\u00e1r or head deshmukh of the empire.\n\nIn 1715 Feroksher, the emperor of Delhi, becoming jealous of the Syed brothers to whom he owed his elevation, appointed the younger Syed Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n to the viceregency of the Deccan, in the hopes that by separating the brothers he should weaken their power and compass their destruction. In 1716, Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bhd\u00e1de, who had established a line of posts along the Surat-Burh\u00e1npur route and defeated two large Moghal armies, went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, paid his respects to Sh\u00e1hu, and was raised to the rank of Sen\u00e1pati of the empire, M\u00e1n\u00e1ji Mor\u00e9 being removed for inability and misconduct. The Mar\u00e1tha officers encouraged by their success and by the secret overtures of Feroksher now extended their encroachments, and in addition to the chauth which they had agreed to receive from D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n in lieu of all claims, they everywhere levied the sardeshmukhi. Under these circumstances the Deccan government of Syed Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n, distracted by Mar\u00e1tha depredations on one side and court intrigues on the other, had recourse to negotiations with Sh\u00e1hu. Shankr\u00e1ji Malh\u00e1r originally a writer under Shiv\u00e1ji and appointed Sachiv by R\u00e1jar\u00e1m at Ginji, had retired during the siege of that place to Benares. Tired of a life so little in accord with his former habits, although a very old man, Shankr\u00e1ji took service with Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n when he was appointed to the Deccan. He soon gained the confidence of his master, and at an early period entered into a correspondence with his friends at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. He represented to the viceroy that if the Mar\u00e1tha claims were recognized, they would have an interest in the prosperity of the country; that this was the only way to restore tranquillity, and a certain means of gaining powerful allies by whose aid he might rest secure from present intrigues, and eventually defy the avowed hostility of the emperor. Husain Ali approving of these views sent Shankr\u00e1ji Malh\u00e1r to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to arrange an alliance between the Moghals and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. This mission opened a great prospect to the aspiring mind of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th. Besides the chauth and sardeshmukhi\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 194-195.\nof the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan including the Bij\u00e1pur and Haidarabad Karn\u00e1taks, with the tributary states of Maisur Trichinopoli and Tanjor, Sh\u00e1hu demanded the whole of the territory in Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra which had belonged to Shiv\u00e1ji with the exception of his possessions in Kh\u00e1ndesh, and in lieu of Kh\u00e1ndesh territory near the old districts as far east as Pandharpur was to be substituted. The forts of Shivner in Poona and of Trimbak in N\u00e1sik were also to be given up. The old districts in the Karn\u00e1tak were also demanded, and a confirmation of some conquests lately made by K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsla the Sena S\u00e1heb Subha in Gondavan and Ber\u00e1r. Lastly the mother and family of Sh\u00e1hu were to be sent from Delhi as soon as practicable. On these conditions Sh\u00e1hu promised to pay to the imperial treasury, for the old territory a yearly peshkash or tribute of \u00a3100,000 (Rs. 10 l\u00e1khs); for the sardeshmukhi or ten per cent of the whole revenue he bound himself to protect the country, to put down every form of disorder, to bring thieves to punishment or restore the stolen property, and to pay the usual fee of 651 per cent on the annual income for the hereditary right of sardeshmukhi; for the grant of chauth no fee was to be paid, but he agreed to maintain a body of 15,000 horse in the emperor\u2019s service, to be placed at the disposal of the subhed\u00e1rs fauzd\u00e1rs and officers in different districts. The Karn\u00e1tak and the subh\u00e1s of Bij\u00e1pur and Haidarabad which were then overrun by the partizans of Sambh\u00e1i R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur, Sh\u00e1hu promised to clear of plunderers, and to make good every loss sustained by the people of those provinces after the final settlement of the treaty. Shankr\u00e1ji Malh\u00e1r had already sufficiently proved his desire to forward the interests of his countrymen, and Sh\u00e1hu appointed him (1717) to conclude the terms, which, according to the above proposals, were with some exception conceded by Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThe territory and forts not under the viceroy\u2019s control were to be recovered at some season of leisure or in any manner which Sh\u00e1hu might think fit. Meanwhile a body of 10,000 horse were sent to join the viceroy. Sant\u00e1ji and Parsoji Bhonsla relations of the Sena S\u00e1heb Subha, \u00dad\u00e1ji Pov\u00e1r Vishv\u00e1sr\u00e1v and several other commanders were detached in charge of the Mar\u00e1tha troops for this duty. At the same time agents were sent to inquire into the state of the districts and collect the extensive shares of revenue now assigned to them, while the Br\u00e1hman ministers were devising a system for realizing their intricate claims which it was by no means their object or interest to simplify.\n\nThe emperor refused (1718) to ratify the treaty. An unworthy favourite encouraged him in his intrigues for the destruction of the Syeds, he became less guarded in his measures, and as an open rupture seemed inevitable, Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n prepared to march for the capital and solicited aid from Sh\u00e1hu. He also pretended to receive from Sh\u00e1hu a son of Sultan Muhammad Akbar then residing at the Mar\u00e1tha court. Such an opportunity was not neglected. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th and Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de proceeded to join the viceroy with a large body of troops, for which he agreed to pay them a certain sum daily from the date of their crossing the Narbada until their return. Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n further promised\nthat the treaty should be ratified and the family of Sh\u00e1hu released and delivered to his officers. On his departure Sh\u00e1hu instructed B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th to endeavour to obtain the cession of the forts of Daulatabad and Ch\u00e1nda\u00b9 and authority to levy the tribute, which had for some time been imposed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa. The plea on which these extraordinary pretensions to tribute were made was that the chief who had already levied contributions in those provinces would break in and plunder, unless Sh\u00e1hu could receive such an authority as must oblige them to look to him only for what they termed their established contributions, and that under these circumstances Sh\u00e1hu would be responsible for the protection and improvement of their territories. The combined army marched to Delhi where the wretched emperor Ferokhsher after some tumult was confined by the Syeds and put to death. Two princes of the line succeeded and died within seven months. Roshan Ikhtiar the grandson of Sult\u00e1n Muazzam was then raised (1719) to the imperial dignity with the title of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, but the two Syeds held all the power. B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th and his Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s remained at Delhi until the accession of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h (1720). During the tumult which preceded the confinement of Ferokhsher, Sant\u00e1ji Bhonsle and 1500 of his men were killed by the populace in the streets of Delhi. The army was paid by the Syeds, according to agreement, and Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s mother and family were given over to B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th. As both the Peshwa and the Sen\u00e1pati were anxious to return to the Deccan they were allowed to leave, and in accordance with the treaty with Hussain Ali Kh\u00e1n, they received three Imperial grants for the chauth, sardeshmukhi, and sv\u00e1r\u00e1jya.\u00b2 The chauth or one-fourth of the whole revenue of the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan including the Haidarabad and Bij\u00e9pur Karn\u00e1taks and the tributary states of Tanjor, Trichinopoli, and Maisur;\u00b3 the sardeshmukhi or ten per cent over and above the chauth;\u2074 and the sv\u00e1r\u00e1jya literally Own Rule.\n\n\u00b9 Ch\u00e1nda is in the Central Provinces about a hundred miles south of N\u00e1gpur.\n\u00b2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 199. When Grant Duff wrote (1826) the original grants were in the possession of the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1. They were in the name of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, dated in the first year of his reign A. H. 1131 (A. D. 1719). The emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h was not placed on the throne till 1720. During the months that intervened between the dethronement of Ferokhsher and his elevation, two princes had filled the throne whose names were erased from the records.\n\u00b3 The deed for the chauth dated 22nd Rah\u00ed-ul-Akhir A. H. 1131 granted to Sh\u00e1hu the fourth of the revenue of the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan simply on condition that he should maintain 15,000 horse to aid the military governors in keeping order. Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 199 note.\n\u2074 The sardeshmukhi grant is dated 4th Jam\u00e1di-ul-\u00c1val or twelve days after that of the chauth. It does not specify in the body of the deed that it is granted as an hereditary right; but the customary fee on such occasions is stated on the back of the instrument as follows:\n\n| Subh\u00e1s | Revenue |\n|--------|---------|\n| Aurangabad | Rs. 1,28,76,042 11 |\n| Berar | Rs. 1,15,28,508 14 |\n| Bedar | Rs. 74,91,879 12 |\n| Bij\u00e9pur | Rs. 7,85,08,560 14 |\n\n| Subh\u00e1s | Revenue |\n|--------|---------|\n| Haidarabad | Rs. 6,48,67,483 0 0 |\n| Kh\u00e1ndesh | Rs. 57,49,819 0 3 |\n| Total | Rs. 15,05,17,294 4 1 |\n\nThe sardeshmukhi was estimated at Rs. 1,80,51,730. Peshkash or established fee on\nthat is the districts held by Shiv\u00e1ji at the time of his death, which were granted to Sh\u00e1hu, excepting the detached possessions in Kh\u00e1ndesh, the fort of Trimbak with the adjoining district, and the conquests south of the Vardha and the Tungbhadra rivers, which were not ceded. In lieu of such of these claims as lay to the north of the Bhima, districts beyond the line of forts from T\u00e1thvad to Machhindragad in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, as far east as Pandharpur, were wholly ceded to Sh\u00e1hu, and also those districts which Aurangzeb had promised to him at the time of his marriage in that emperor's camp. The country watered by the Yerla, M\u00e1n, and Nira, celebrated for good horses and hardy men, the home of some of the oldest families in Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra, who had not hitherto formally acknowledged the descendants of Shiv\u00e1ji, including the whole of the present district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, was by this cession placed under Sh\u00e1hu's authority.\u00b9 The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s pretended that the conquests of Ber\u00e1r by Pars\u00f3ji and K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle, and their right to tribute in Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa were confirmed at the same time; but though some very indefinite verbal promise may have been given and B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th left an agent for the purpose as is alleged of receiving the sanads, subsequent events prove the falsity of the assertion.\n\nWhen B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th started for Delhi, he left his div\u00e1n \u00c1b\u00e1ji Purandhare as his mut\u00e1l\u00edk or deputy in charge of his seal of office, and the duties of Peshwa continued to be carried on at the Mar\u00e1tha court in B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's name. On B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with the Imperial deed the scheme for collecting and distributing the revenues which all admit to have been projected by B\u00e1l\u00e1ji was examined, and the system which had already been partially introduced was now openly accepted. The sardeshmukhi or ten per cent on the revenues of the subh\u00e1s of the Deccan was first set aside and termed by the ministers the R\u00e1ja's vatan, a gratifying sound to the ears of a Mar\u00e1tha whether prince or peasant. The imposition of the sardeshmukhi reduced to a proportionate degree the actual collections from a country the resources of which were already drained to the utmost, but the nominal revenue continued the same. To have collected even one-fourth of the standard assessment would probably at this period have been impossible but the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in all situations endeavoured to secure, in lieu of their chauth, at least twenty-five per cent of the real balances. Although they seldom could collect it, they always stated the chauth as due upon the tankha or standard assessment, because, even should a day\n\n\u00b9 The following is a list of the sixteen districts included in the grant of svar\u00e1jya: Poona, Supa including B\u00e1r\u00e1mati, Ind\u00e1pur, W\u00e1i, the M\u00e1v\u00e1s, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Karh\u00e1d, Khat\u00e1v, M\u00e1n, Phaltan, Malk\u00e1pur, T\u00e1vla, Panh\u00e1la, A'jra, Junnar, and Kolh\u00e1pur; the parg\u00e1ns north of the Tungbhadra including Kop\u00e1l, Gadag, Haliy\u00e1l, and all the forts which were captured by Shiv\u00e1ji; the Konkan including R\u00e1mnagar, Gandevi, Jawh\u00e1r, Cheul, Bhiwndi, Kaly\u00e1n, R\u00e1jpuri, D\u00e1bhol, J\u00e1vli, R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, Phonda, Ankola, and Kud\u00e1l. Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 200.\nof retribution come the Moghals could make no claim of peshkash or tribute on that head, as none was specified in the deed. In regard to the sardeshmukhi, it suited both their foreign and domestic policy to keep that claim undefined; but their system in practice, that of exacting as much as they could, was as simple as it was invariable. Of the seventy-five per cent which remained to the Moghals, one-third or twenty-five per cent was received according to established usage by the fauzd\u00e1r, and the balance was collected sometimes for the Imperial exchequer, but generally on account of some j\u00e1gird\u00e1r, to whom most of the Moghal conquests in the Deccan were assigned for the support of troops. This general mode of appropriating the revenue explains the seizures, resumptions, and cessions of territory under the name of j\u00e1gir during the later wars in the Deccan between the Niz\u00e1m and the Peshwa. It likewise explains the practice which prevailed in many villages, even up to the British conquests, of bringing fifty per cent of the net revenue to account under the head of j\u00e1gir, for which the kulkarnis in less than a century could assign no reason except the custom of their forefathers. The term sv\u00e1r\u00e1jya or Own Rule, which in the first instance was applied to that part of the territory north of the Tungbhadra possessed by Shivaji at his death, on the return of B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th was extended to the whole of the Mar\u00e1tha claims exclusive of the sardeshmukhi. Of these claims one-fourth or twenty-five per cent was appropriated to the head of the state in addition to the sardeshmukhi. This fourth was known by the name of the R\u00e1ja's b\u00e1bti. The balance was termed mok\u00e1sa. Of the mok\u00e1sa two shares were left at the disposal of the R\u00e1ja; the one was sahotra or six per cent and the other n\u00e1dgaunda or three per cent, both calculated on the whole sv\u00e1r\u00e1jya. The balance of the mok\u00e1sa was sixty-six per cent of the whole of the Mar\u00e1tha claims exclusive of the sardeshmukhi. The sahotra was bestowed by Sh\u00e1hu on the Pant Sachiv as an hereditary assignment; it was collected by the Sachiv's own agents only within the territory wholly possessed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; separate collectors were sent by the R\u00e1ja to realize it in distant districts. The n\u00e1dgaunda was granted to different persons at the R\u00e1ja's pleasure. Independent of salaries from the treasury the Pradh\u00e1ns had many in\u00e1m villages conferred on them. B\u00e1j\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th received several districts near Poona in personal j\u00e1gir, including the fort of Lohogad. The Pratinidhi, the Peshwa, and the Pant Sachiv were charged with the collection of the b\u00e1bti on the R\u00e1ja's account. Thus there were distinct agents for realizing the b\u00e1bti and sardeshmukhi, for the sahotra of the Pant Sachiv, for the n\u00e1dgaunda of the assignee to whom it belonged, and for the mok\u00e1sa to different officers for maintaining troops. The mok\u00e1sa was distributed among a great number of chiefs as military j\u00e1gir, burdened according to the circumstances with dues to the head of the state, both of money and of troops. The districts of old Mar\u00e1tha j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs were freed from the chauth, but they were generally liable to the payment of sardeshmukhi, besides furnishing their quota of horse. Such j\u00e1girs, in a grant of mok\u00e1sa for a large tract were always stated as\ndeductions and long before districts were conquered, formal grants and assignments of their revenue were distributed. Numberless personal j\u00e1girs and in\u00e1ms of lands and of whole villages were alienated by Sh\u00e1hu; the former commonly required the performance of some service but the latter were entirely freehold. The R\u00e1ja's authority was considered necessary to collect the revenues thus conceded, but the authority for which they were constantly petitioning was a mockery. The Br\u00e1hmans soon proved, at least to their own satisfaction, that the R\u00e1ja's sanad was sufficient for levying tribute in districts not specified in the imperial deeds. A district once overrun was said to be under tribute from usage; other districts were plundered by virtue of letters patent.\n\nParticular quarters of the country were assigned to the leading officers, which, as far as they can now be ascertained, were as follows. The Peshwa and Sen\u00e1pati, charged with the command of a great proportion of the R\u00e1ja's personal troops, were ordered to direct their attention to the general protection and defence of the territory. The Peshwa had authority to levy the government dues in Kh\u00e1ndesh and part of the B\u00e1l\u00e9gh\u00e1t to the north-east of Shol\u00e1pur; the Sen\u00e1pati was vested with similar authority in B\u00e1gl\u00e1n and a right to realize the dues established by usage from Gujar\u00e1t. K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle the Sena S\u00e1heb Subha had charge of Ber\u00e1r Payin-gh\u00e1t and was privileged to conquer and exact tribute from Gondvan to the east. The Sar Lashkar had Gangthadi including part of Aurangabad. Fateh Sing Bhonsle was appointed to the Karn\u00e1tak; while the general charge of the old territory from the Nira to the V\u00e1rna, and the collections from Haidarabad and Bedar were left to the Pratinidhi and the immediate agents of the R\u00e1ja. The Chitnis had particular charge of several districts in the Konkan. The Pant Sachiv enjoyed the revenue of the whole sahotra besides his old possessions in j\u00e1gir. The agents for collecting the R\u00e1ja's zamind\u00e1ri dues were styled n\u00e1ib sardeshmukhs. K\u00e1nhoji \u00c1ngria, retaining his districts in the Konkan, levied his chauth, as he termed it, by continuing to plunder the ships of all nations that appeared on the coast. He used to pay a tribute to the R\u00e1ja in guns, muskets, military stores, and ammunition. He also presented frequent nazars in articles from Europe and China; and he was sometimes charged with the very extraordinary duty of executing state criminals.\n\nAll the principal Mar\u00e1tha officers as a further means of preserving intercourse and union had particular claims assigned to them on portions of revenue or on whole villages in the districts of each other. The greatest Mar\u00e1tha commanders or their principal Br\u00e1hman agents were eager to own their native village; but although vested with the control, they were proud to acknowledge themselves of the family of the p\u00e1t\u00edl or kulkarni: and if heirs to a mir\u00eds field, they would sooner have lost wealth and rank than been dispossessed of such a valan or inheritance. Yet on obtaining the absolute sovereignty, they never assumed an authority in the interior village concerns beyond the rights and privileges acquired by birth or purchase, according to the invariable rules of the country. Such\nis a brief outline of the system and arrangements settled by the Mar\u00e1tha ministry on the return of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th; and such was the mode by which a common interest was created, and for a time preserved, among the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs; while the character of Sh\u00e1hu, the influence and power of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th, the abilities of his sons B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Chimn\u00e1ji, and the preponderance of Br\u00e1hman opinion and authority paved the way, though by gradual steps, for the supremacy and usurpation of the Peshw\u00e1s.\n\nIn 1720, Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk the governor of M\u00e1lwa, throwing off his dependence on the Syeds, determined to possess himself of the Deccan. He overran Kh\u00e1ndesh and defeated the Moghal troops under Dil\u00e1war Ali Kh\u00e1n at Burh\u00e1npur slaying their commander. The troops of Sh\u00e1hu under K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle the Sena S\u00e1heb Subha, and Haibatr\u00e1v Nimb\u00e1lkar speedily joined Shankr\u00e1ji Malh\u00e1r who since the departure of Hussain Ali Kh\u00e1n had lived with the deputy viceroy Alam Ali Kh\u00e1n as the envoy of Sh\u00e1hu. Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de who had just returned from Delhi was likewise despatched from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with a body of horse. Alam Ali Kh\u00e1n was defeated at B\u00e1lapur in Ber\u00e1r P\u00e1yingh\u00e1t by the troops of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, and fell surrounded by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s slain in his defence. On this occasion the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s behaved as faithful auxiliaries and fought with bravery. They lost no person of note except Shankr\u00e1ji Malh\u00e1r who was mortally wounded and made prisoner. Soon after events happened at Delhi by which the power of the Syeds was destroyed, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h was freed from their control and Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk confirmed as viceroy of the Deccan. Meanwhile several important changes had taken place at the Mar\u00e1tha court, chiefly owing to the death of three leading ministers Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th, and Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de. Shripatr\u00e1v the second son of the Pratinidhi had succeeded his father Parashur\u00e1m Trimbak before the return of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th from Delhi. The Peshwa's health had suffered from the fatigue of the journey to Delhi and the labour he had bestowed on different arrangements after his return. He obtained leave from Sh\u00e1hu to retire for a short time to S\u00e1svad in Poona where his family resided, but his constitution was exhausted and he survived for only a few days. At the time of his death (October 1720) he left two sons B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Chimn\u00e1ji. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was not formally invested with the dignity of Peshwa for nearly seven months, due perhaps to the absence of the principal officers at the Mar\u00e1tha court, or B\u00e1jir\u00e1v may have joined the army which did not return for some time after the battle of B\u00e1lapur. The troops of Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de behaved with so great bravery on that occasion and one of his officers Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r the ancestor of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1rs of Baroda so particularly distinguished himself that on his return B\u00e1jir\u00e1v recommended him to Sh\u00e1hu in the warmest manner. The R\u00e1ja in consequence appointed him second in command under Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v with the title of Samsher Bah\u00e1-\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 206-207.  \n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 208.\nNeither Dam\u00e1ji nor Khander\u00e1v survived their return above a few months. The son of Khander\u00e1v, Trimbakr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de, was honoured with the dress of Sen\u00e1pati in May 1721, the same month in which B\u00e1jir\u00e1v received his robes as Peshwa. Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r succeeded to his uncle Dam\u00e1ji, and Chimn\u00e1ji the second son of the late Peshwa, who received Supa in j\u00e1g\u00e9r was appointed to a similar command under his brother B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. Ab\u00e1jipant Purandhare their father's chief manager, according to the rule of appointment, was reinvested by Sh\u00e1hu with scrupulous ceremony. During the interval between the death of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th and the appointment of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, Ab\u00e1jipant Purandhare transacted ordinary affairs with the seal of the late Peshwa; but a great part of the business fell into the hands of Khando Ball\u00e1l Chitnis and Shripatr\u00e1v Pratinidhi. Khando Ball\u00e1l gave his attention principally to the \u00c1ngria, the Sidi, and the affairs of the Konkan; while the Pratinidhi aided by Anandr\u00e1v Sumant Pradh\u00e1n conducted important negotiations with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. Anandr\u00e1v's son Maht\u00e1ji was employed as Sh\u00e1hu's agent with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, who while he apprehended an attack from Hussain Ali Kh\u00e1n, conciliated Sh\u00e1hu by promising to give up all that the royal grants conceded. No sooner was he apprised of the ascendancy acquired by his party at Delhi and of the loss the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had sustained in the death of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th than he began to start objections to the establishment of Sh\u00e1hu's collectors, founded on some pretensions set up by Sambh\u00e1ji and Chandrasen J\u00e1dhav. The wise precautions of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th, and the communion of interest which the distribution of the ceded revenue had produced, placed the R\u00e1ja of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in a far more commanding situation than that in which he had stood during the first period of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk's government of the Deccan. The agent remained at Aurangabad where his arrangements would probably have been of little avail, but a vast army of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was assembling in the Gangthadi under the Sar Lashkar, and their appearance had considerable effect in hastening the delivery of orders to allow R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1hu to establish his collectors. A fresh order or farm\u00e1n obtained by the Mar\u00e1tha agent at Delhi from Muhammad Sh\u00e1h opportunely arrived to remove from Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk the appearance of having yielded to menace, and afforded an opportunity of evincing the promptitude with which he obeyed the imperial commands.\n\nB\u00e1jir\u00e1v soon after his appointment as Peshwa (May 1721) set out with an army for Kh\u00e1ndesh where he levied his mok\u00e1sa although not without opposition. From the period of his accession he gave a considerable portion of his attention to extending Mar\u00e1tha conquests to the north, and his aims were early turned to M\u00e1lwa. Circumstances generally obliged him to return yearly to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Poona. During the three expeditions, before the rains of 1724, though he had sent detachments into M\u00e1lwa, it is not ascertained that he crossed the Narbada in person until the end of that year; nor did he remain in M\u00e1lwa for any length of time until upwards of eleven years after his accession as Peshwa. Affairs in the\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 210.\nDeccan required his presence, and with the intrigues of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk and domestic opposition, restrained both his ambition and his enterprise. At different times before the year 1724 B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had defeated the Subhed\u00e1r of Burh\u00e1npur and an officer named D\u00e1ud Kh\u00e1n sent against him by Azim-ulla Kh\u00e1n from M\u00e1lwa. In one of these battles two of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s officers who afterwards rose to high rank first came into notice. One was Mah\u00e1ri Holkar a shiled\u00e1r or self-horsed trooper who commanded a party of his own horse. He was a Mar\u00e1tha Dhangar, a native of the village of Hol on the Nira, of which his father was changula or p\u00e1t\u00edl\u2019s assistant. He had served under Kant\u00e1ji Kadam B\u00e1nde one of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s officers and had gathered a small body of horse. The other officer was R\u00e1noji Sindia descended from a younger branch of the family of Kannairkhed a village fifteen miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Sindi\u00e1s according to local legends have been distinguished horsemen since the time of the Bahmani dynasty. There are two Mar\u00e1tha families or rather clans named Sindia, the one distinguished by their hereditary p\u00e1t\u00edl village of Kanhairkhed and the other by the title of Ravir\u00e1v. Both families claim Rajput descent. Those of Kannairkhed had a mansab under Aurangzeb and Sindia\u2019s daughter, who was given in marriage by that emperor to Sh\u00e1hu, died in captivity at Delhi. Sindia remained faithful to the Moghals, and, as his fate was never known, it is conjectured that he was killed in some distant country possibly with A\u2019zam Sh\u00e1h in the battle of \u00c1gra in 1707. The family had fallen into decay and R\u00e1noji who revived its fame was reduced to a state of abject poverty serving as a barg\u00far or rider first in the troop of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th and afterwards in that of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji\u2019s son. To contrast his original with his subsequent condition, he is said to have carried the Peshwa\u2019s slippers, and to have been marked by B\u00e1jir\u00e1v as fitted for a place of trust by the care he took of his humble charge.\n\nAnother officer who gained fresh honour about this time was Ud\u00e1ji Pov\u00e1r Vishv\u00e1sr\u00e1v. His father was first raised by R\u00e1mchandrapant Am\u00e1tya when he governed the country during the siege of Ginji, and the young man joined Sh\u00e1hu and obtained the command of a considerable body of horse. He was employed on various services and appears to have been an active partizan. Like most contemporary Mar\u00e1tha leaders of experience, such as Kant\u00e1ji Kadam B\u00e1nde, Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle, he calculated on the surest advantage in the most distant ventures where his appearance was least expected. He made incursions into Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa, plundered Gujar\u00e1t as far as Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and found M\u00e1lwa so drained of troops that he was able to remain some time in the country intimating to the R\u00e1ja that if supported, he might collect the chauth and sardeshmukhi in every direction. How long he maintained his station in the country on his first inroads is uncertain, but it is probable that he was obliged to retire from Dh\u00e1r a fortress in the west of M\u00e1lwa where he first established himself, upon the appointment of Girdhar Bah\u00e1dur, whose exertion in the defence of M\u00e1lwa was the chief cause which prevented the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s getting a firm footing in that province for more than ten years after the accession of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v.\nThe progress of Ud\u00e1ji Pov\u00e1r, the successes of Kant\u00e1ji Kadam B\u00e1nde and Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r in Gujar\u00e1t, and the dissensions between Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk and the Imperial court opportunely occurred to favour the Peshwa\u2019s views of spreading Mar\u00e1tha conquests in North India. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v who was early trained by his father to business was bred a soldier as well as a statesman. He united the enterprise, vigour, and hardihood of a Mar\u00e1tha chief with the polish, astuteness, and address of a Konkanasth Br\u00e1hman. He was fully acquainted with his father\u2019s financial schemes and chose the part of the plan which was calculated to direct the predatory hordes of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra in a common effort. The genius of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v enlarged his father\u2019s schemes, and unlike most Br\u00e1hmans he had both the head to plan and the hand to do. To the unceasing industry and minute watchfulness of his caste he added a judgment that taught him the leading points of importance which tended to spread Mar\u00e1tha sway. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s views of spreading Mar\u00e1tha power in Upper India were at first disapproved by Sh\u00e1hu, and from prudence as well as rivalry were opposed by Shripatr\u00e1v the Pratinidhi. Jealousy in public places is a passion which the subtlest Br\u00e1hman can rarely command or hide. The passion is bitterest among Br\u00e1hmans of different tribes. The rivalry between B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the Konkanasth Peshwa and Shripatr\u00e1v the Deshasth Pratinidhi tended to preserve the R\u00e1ja\u2019s ascendancy longer. The Peshwa\u2019s first proposal for exacting what he called the established tribute from M\u00e1lwa and extending Mar\u00e1tha conquests into North India was violently and for a time successfully opposed by the Pratinidhi. Shripatr\u00e1v represented it as rash and imprudent. He held that, though the head of the State might not be called to account for casual inroads, to allow the Peshwa to make raids must draw on the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the whole power of the empire, and precipitate hostilities with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk whose victorious army was still at their gates; that so far from being prepared for resistance there was a total want of regularity even in their arrangements, that they could scarcely quell a common insurrection; and that to enter on a war before they had secured what had been ceded was the extreme of folly and of rashness. The Pratinidhi added that he was a soldier as well as the Peshwa, and when expedient as ready as B\u00e1jir\u00e1v to head an expedition; that after they had established their collectors and arranged other parts of the country it would be advisable, before pursuing their conquests in the north, to reduce the Karn\u00e1tak and to recover the countries conquered by Shiv\u00e1ji; that Fattehsing Bhonsle\u2019s troops could scarcely venture to cross the Krishna, and that the first efforts should be made in that quarter.\n\nThese were probably the real opinions of Shripatr\u00e1v. The wisdom of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was of a higher order. He comprehended the nature of predatory power; he perceived its growth in the turbulence and anarchy for which the system of distributing the revenue was the first remedy; he foresaw that confusion abroad would tend to order at home; that as commander of distant expeditions he should acquire the direction of a larger force than any other chief of the empire; that the resources of the Deccan would not only improve by withdrawing the hordes\nof horse which unprofitably consumed them, but must fall under the control of that person who could most readily procure employment and subsistence for the troops. While Bajirav concealed his private designs and partly admitted the justice of Shripatrav's views, he endeavoured by his commanding eloquence to arouse enthusiasm or ambition in Shahu. He went over the conquests of Shahu's famous grandfather and reminded him of the powerful kings and the mighty emperor with whom Shivaji had successfully contended. He painted the present condition of India, the weakness indolence and imbecility of the Moghals, and the activity energy and enterprise of the Marathas. If, he said, the great Shivaji had been of the same opinion as the Pratinidhi, he would have thought it necessary before venturing into the Karnatak to reduce Bijapur and Golkonda. As to their domestic quarrels beyond the Krishna, it would be time to think of them hereafter; by the Raja's good fortune every desire would be accomplished. Bajirav ended a speech of considerable length, with the words: Now is our time to drive strangers from the land of the Hindus and to gain undying renown. By turning our efforts to North India the Maratha flag shall fly from the Krishna to the Attock. You shall plant it, replied Shahu, in the Kinnar Khand beyond the Himalayas; a noble son of a worthy father. Let us strike, said Bajirav, at the trunk of the withering tree; the branches must fall of themselves.\n\nAt what time Shahu's consent was obtained is not known. The form of obtaining the Raja's consent on all such occasions was rigidly observed by the Peshwas at a stage when their supremacy was far advanced. By virtue of that authority and their station as mukhya pradhans or chief ministers, even when their usurpation became complete, it suited the Brahman character to act as nominal servants and real masters to rule the Maratha chiefs as the delegate of their prince.\u00b9\n\nIn 1725, Hamid Khan, the uncle of Nizam-ul-Mulk, for the aid he gave him against Mubarez Khan, granted the chauth in Gujar\u00e1t to Kantaji Kadam Bande and Pilaji Gaikwar, who proceeded to levy their assignments. The division of the money led to perpetual disputes. Pilaji, as the agent of Dabbhade Senapati considered himself the superior authority in Gujar\u00e1t and Kantaji as an officer of the Raja despised his pretensions. An agreement was signed by which the chauth east of the Mahi was assigned to Pilaji and that to the west to Kantaji.\u00b2 Meanwhile Bajirav took advantage of the confusion caused by Moghal dissensions to carry his arms into Malwa, where, though opposed by Raja Girdhar, he was successful for two seasons in obtaining plunder and contributions. It is probable that Nizam-ul-Mulk against whom the Imperial forces were acting in Gujar\u00e1t, may have connived at his incursions, but there is no proof of any direct communication with the Peshwa. Bajirav, by virtue of the authority vested in him by Shahu, granted deeds to Povar, Holkar, and Sindhia to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi and to keep half the mokasa in payment of their troops. In 1726, the Peshwa with a\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Marathas, 214-215. \u00b2 Grant Duff's Marathas, 216-217.\nlarge army under Fattehsing Bhonsle, marched into the Madras Karn\u00e1tak, plundered the districts, and levied a contribution from Ser-ingapatam. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s lost a number of men without gaining the expected advantages. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had objected to the expedition, and was dissatisfied with the result, and on returning to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra he found more serious reasons of dissatisfaction in the measures pursued by the Pratinidhi. The cause of his displeasure originated in the artful schemes of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, which, but for the penetration and vigour of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, would probably have unlinked the chain by which B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th had joined the interests as well as the inclinations of most of the Hindu chieftains of the Deccan.\n\nIn 1727 Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, though relieved from immediate apprehensions from the Delhi Emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e1h whose power was daily declining, became alarmed at the spreading power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. He beheld in their systematic and persevering encroachments on the divided revenue of the Deccan and the Karn\u00e1tak, the extinction of his own resources as well as those of the empire, and took measures to avert these evils by endeavouring to consolidate his own power and to create divisions among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In these measures he overlooked the ability of his opponent B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and little thought that the pursuit of his own schemes should strengthen the power of the Peshwa. He had fixed on Haidarabad, the ancient capital of the Kutt Sh\u00e1hi kings, as fittest for the seat of his new government, and was anxious on any terms to remove the Mar\u00e1tha collectors from that quarter. Although Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk had confirmed the imperial grant in Sh\u00e1hu's favour, a great deal of what was yielded was not actually given up. Numerous points had remained unadjusted. Sh\u00e1hu's part of the agreement to prevent plundering was not fulfilled and constant discussions were the consequence. A new authority for a part of the old territory was granted by Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, which particularly specified the fixed personal j\u00e1g\u00edrs that Sh\u00e1hu agreed to exempt from sequestration. J\u00e1g\u00edr assignments in the old territory about Poona which the Niz\u00e1m had given to Rambh\u00e1ji Nimb\u00e1lkar one of the disaffected officers who had joined him, were exchanged for new grants to the eastward about Karm\u00e1la, a measure on the part of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk particularly conciliatory to Sh\u00e1hu. After this a settlement was concluded through the Pratinidhi by which Sh\u00e1hu agreed to relinquish the chauth and sardeshmukhi in the neighbourhood of Haidarabad. An equivalent in money was to be paid for the chauth, and for the sardeshmukhi Sh\u00e1hu received some j\u00e1g\u00edr territory near Ind\u00e1pur in Poona of which district he was an hereditary deshmukh, and a j\u00e1g\u00edr in Ber\u00e1r was conferred on the Pratinidhi. Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk had thus effected his first object by negotiation, but the exchange met with the decided disapproval of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v who was ever an enemy to consolidation and disputes ran so high between him and the Pratinidhi that Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, encouraged by appearances and the support and alliance of Chandrasen J\u00e1dhav, R\u00e1v Rambha Nimb\u00e1lkar j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 218.\n2 Half of this deshmukhi was bought by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji Bhonsle the father of Shiv\u00e1ji after he entered the service of M\u00e1nmud Adil Sh\u00e1h., Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 220\nof B\u00e1rsi, and Sambh\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur, resolved to complete the design he had formed. With this view he espoused the cause of Sambh\u00e1ji and endeavoured to create a complete division in the Mar\u00e1tha government by reviving the former feuds between Sh\u00e1hu and Sambh\u00e1ji.\n\nNiz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk began by formally hearing the claims of Sambh\u00e1ji in a demand made for an equal division of the revenue; and, according to a prevalent custom in the Deccan, sequestered the property in dispute by removing the collectors of the sardeshmukhi and displacing the mok\u00e1s\u00e1dd\u00e1rs of Sh\u00e1hu until their respective rights should be adjusted. Assuming this privilege as viceroy he pretended to become the friend and arbiter of both parties. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was not to be duped by the old artifice of engaging the Mar\u00e1tha cousins in an hereditary dispute. He quickly turned the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s weapons to his own advantage, for Sh\u00e1hu, true to the feeling of a Mar\u00e1tha, of whom even among the peasantry the mildest men became violent when a raton is concerned, though for some time he had been reconciled to Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, was at once on hearing of this interference roused to implacable resentment against him, and for the time against all who had vindicated or who dared to justify his conduct. He looked to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v for counsel and for vengeance; for these he would have bartered life, and for these he virtually sold the supremacy of his empire. At first he determined to lead his army, but it was represented that to march in person would place him on an equality with Sambh\u00e1ji of Kolh\u00e1pur; none but the emperor was worthy of contending with the king of the Hindus. Full powers were therefore given to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. The great influence which the Peshwa had gained was shown in the promptness with which many of the most unruly and factious of the Shiled\u00e1r families gathered round the standard of the nation.\n\nNiz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk perceived his mistake, and sought to amend it by writing to Sh\u00e1hu and the Pratimdh\u00ed that he was solely actuated by a wish to benefit the R\u00e1ja in order to prevent the usurpation of the Konkani Br\u00e1hmans by whose creatures every situation was filled; that the mok\u00e1s\u00e1dd\u00e1rs and collectors of the sardeshmukhi had been replaced by others belonging to the R\u00e1ja\u2019s relation, Sambh\u00e1ji, whom he had appointed the R\u00e1ja\u2019s deputy, as Sardeshmukh of the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan; and that the R\u00e1ja when freed from the control of the Konkani Br\u00e1hmans might afterwards appoint agents entirely of his own selection. But the animosity of Sh\u00e1hu, worked to the highest pitch by the Peshwa, was not to be appeased by offers, which, under the colouring given to them by B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, only added insult to injury. Both parties prepared to attack each other as soon as the rains should subside and enable their horse to cross the rivers. In the war that ensued in Gujar\u00e1t and Kh\u00e1ndesh (1728) between Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk aided by Sambh\u00e1ji on one side and the Peshwa on the other the able conduct of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v forced Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk to agree to a negotiation. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v demanded that Sambh\u00e1ji should be sent to his camp; that security should be afforded for the future collection of the Mar\u00e1tha shares of the revenue by giving up several fortified places; and that all arrears not yet realized should be made...\ngood. Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk agreed to all the articles except that of delivering up Sambh\u00e1ji. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v represented that he was a near relation of the R\u00e1ja's and that he should be treated with equal respect. It was at last settled that Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk should guarantee his safe arrival in Panh\u00e1la, when Sh\u00e1hu should be at liberty to take what steps he might think proper for the settlement of their family dispute.\n\nB\u00e1jir\u00e1v was then negotiating with Sar Buland Kh\u00e1n in hopes of obtaining the cession of the chauth and sardeshmukhi of Gujar\u00e1t. After the ratification of the treaty with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, Chimm\u00e1ji \u00c1pa the Peshwa's brother marched with a large army and exacted a heavy contribution from Petl\u00e1d and plundered Dholka, but on promising that if the chauth and sardeshmukhi were yielded the districts should be secured from depredation, Sar Buland Kh\u00e1n agreed to the Peshwa's proposals, and in 1729 granted the sardeshmukhi or ten per cent of the whole revenue both on the land and customs except the port of Surat and the district round it, together with the chauth or one-fourth of the whole collections on the land and customs except Surat, and five per cent on the revenues of the city of Ahmadabad.\n\nWhile B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's presence was necessary in the north to support Chimm\u00e1ji in Gujar\u00e1t, Sambh\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur, instigated by Ud\u00e1ji Chavh\u00e1n refused to listen to overtures made by Sh\u00e1hu and encamped on the north side of the V\u00e1rna with all his baggage women and equipments, and began to plunder the country. The Pratinidhi surprised Sambh\u00e1ji's camp and drove them to Panh\u00e1la with the loss of the whole of their baggage. Many prisoners were taken, among others T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed and her daughter-in-law R\u00e1jasb\u00e1\u00ed the widow of Shiv\u00e1ji of Kolh\u00e1pur. Both these persons were placed in confinement in the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1730). This defeat brought on an immediate accommodation. Except some forts, the Mar\u00e1tha districts and claims in the tract of which the rivers V\u00e1rna and Krishna to the north and the Tungbhadra to the south are the boundaries were wholly ceded. Kop\u00e1l near the Tungbhadra was relinquished by Sh\u00e1hu in exchange for Ratn\u00e1giri, and the territory of the Konkan, extending from S\u00e1lshi to Ankola in North K\u00e1naara was comprehended in the sovereignty of Kolh\u00e1pur. The fort of Vadgaon occupied by Ud\u00e1ji Chavh\u00e1n on the south bank of the V\u00e1rna was destroyed. Miraj, T\u00e1sgaon, Athmi, and several villages along the north bank of the Krishna and some fortified places in Bij\u00e1pur were given to Sh\u00e1hu. This treaty was offensive and defensive and provided for the division of further conquests to the south of the Tungbhadra which, on co-operation, were to be equally shared. Grants of in\u00e1m land or hereditary rights conferred by either party within their respective boundaries were confirmed.\n\nAlthough enemies were not wanting to detract from the reputation of the Peshwa and to extol that of his rivals, the success of the Pratinidhi did not materially affect the ascendancy which B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had attained; but Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk was still bent on opposing him and found a fit instrument for his purpose in Trimbakr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de. Ever since the Peshwa had obtained the deeds from Sar\nBuland Kh\u00e1n, D\u00e1bh\u00e1de had been negotiating with other Mar\u00e1tha-chiefs and assembling troops in Gujar\u00e1t. At length finding himself at the head of 35,000 men he had resolved to march for the Deccan in the next season. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was well aware of the Sen\u00e1pati's enmity, but was not alarmed by his preparations until he discovered that Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk was to support him in the Deccan. On learning their intention he at once determined to anticipate them, though, when joined by all his adherents, his whole army did not amount to more than half that of D\u00e1bh\u00e1de. D\u00e1bh\u00e1de gave out that he was proceeding to protect the R\u00e1ja's authority, and was supported by Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, Kant\u00e1ji and Raghuji Kadam B\u00e1nde, Ud\u00e1ji and \u00c1nandr\u00e1v Pov\u00e1r, Chimm\u00e1ji Pandit a very active marauder, and Kur Bah\u00e1dur with many others. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v proved that D\u00e1bh\u00e1de Sen\u00e1pati was in alliance with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk and declared that he was leagued for the purpose of dividing the Mar\u00e1tha sovereignty with the R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur, a measure inconsistent with sound policy and contrary to the divine ordinances of the Sh\u00e1stras.\n\nThe preparations of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk hastened the march of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, and as his army, though so inferior in number, was composed of the old P\u00e1ga horse or the R\u00e1ja's household troops and some of the best Mar\u00e1tha M\u00e1nkaris, he moved rapidly towards Gujar\u00e1t. At the same time he began negotiating from the day he left Poona and continued until the hour of attack. In the battle which took place (1st April) between Baroda and Dabhoi in Gujar\u00e1t, the death of Trimbakr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de the Sen\u00e1pati and many who commanded under him left complete victory to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v with all but nominal control of the Mar\u00e1tha sovereignty. A treaty was concluded in August and at the close of the monsoon the Peshwa returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. He would have punished Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk's treachery, but the Niz\u00e1m warded off the blow which he could with difficulty have withstood by directing its aim against the head of the empire. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v readily agreed to the Niz\u00e1m's views. It suited his favourite policy, and it gave employment to persons likely to disturb the domestic arrangements he aimed at establishing. Troops were immediately sent towards M\u00e1lwa under his brother Chimm\u00e1ji while he himself remained for a time engaged in the interior arrangements of government at Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Such appear to have been the rise and progress of the events and intrigues which ended in a secret compact between B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk which secured to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v supremacy as Peshwa and to the Niz\u00e1m a kingdom in the Deccan.\n\nThe victory over D\u00e1bh\u00e1de, like the issue of every civil war, left impressions on the minds of many not easily effaced. The Peshwa adopted every means of conciliation in his power. He continued D\u00e1bh\u00e1de's charitable practice called dakshina of feeding thousands of Br\u00e1hmans for several days every year at Poona, and gave sums of money to the assembled Sh\u00e1stris and Vaid\u00edks. Yashvantr\u00e1v the son of Trimbakr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de was raised to the rank of Sen\u00e1pati, but being too young to take the management on himself, his mother\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 225.\nUm\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed became his guardian and Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r their former mut\u00e1l\u00edk or deputy was confirmed in that situation with the title of Sena Kh\u00e1s Khel or Captain of the Sovereign Tribe in addition to his hereditary title of Samsher Bah\u00e1dur. An agreement was drawn up under the authority of Sh\u00e1hu and subscribed by the Peshwa and Sen\u00e1pati, that neither party should enter the boundary of the other in Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa. Within the limits of Gujar\u00e1t the Sen\u00e1pati was to have entire management, but he bound himself to pay one-half of the revenue to government through the Peshwa. All contributions levied from countries not specified in the deeds given under the authority of Sar Buland Kh\u00e1n were to be made over to the R\u00e1ja after deducting expenses.\n\nPerceiving B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's complete ascendancy, the appointment of the Hindu prince Abhayising to supersede Sar Buland Kh\u00e1n, the imbecility of the emperor, and the treachery as well as venality of his courtiers, and knowing also that he had rendered himself in the highest degree obnoxious, Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk had good grounds for apprehending that the Peshwa might be able to obtain the viceroyalty of the Deccan. The plan which under these circumstances he adopted belongs to the higher order of politics. It seems to have been framed for the purpose of diverting the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from destroying the resources of his own country and of making his own power a balance between that of the emperor and the Peshwa. Before invading M\u00e1lwa in person B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had an interview with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk and endeavoured to induce him to advance a subsidy for the aid he was affording, but the Niz\u00e1m considered the inducement sufficiently strong without paying his auxiliaries. The districts in Kh\u00e1ndesh were to be protected by the present agreement of the Peshwa in his passage to and from M\u00e1lwa and nothing more than the usual tribute was to be levied in the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan, a proposal to which B\u00e1jir\u00e1v readily acceded. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v on crossing the Narbada assumed command of the army in M\u00e1lwa and sent his brother and Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav back to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to maintain his influence at court and to concert measures for settling the Konkan which was very disturbed. In Gujar\u00e1t Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, who was assassinated by Abhayising's emissaries, was succeeded by Dam\u00e1ji (1732).\n\nIn 1733, Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Bangash the new governor of M\u00e1lwa having entered Bundelkhand and established himself in the territory of R\u00e1ja Chiturs\u00e1l, the Rajput prince solicited aid from B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. Aid was readily granted. Bangash Kh\u00e1n was reduced to the greatest distress and the province was evacuated by his troops. Chiturs\u00e1l in return for this service conferred on B\u00e1jir\u00e1v a fort and district in the neighbourhood of Jh\u00e1nshi worth \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2\u00bd l\u00e1khs) of yearly revenue, adopted him as his son, and at his death, which happened soon after, bestowed on him one-third of his possessions or an equal share with his two sons the R\u00e1ja of K\u00e1lpi and the R\u00e1ja of Bundelkhand. In 1734, R\u00e1ja Jaysing was appointed to the government of the provinces of \u00c1gra and M\u00e1lwa and nothing\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 226.\ncould be more favourable to the views of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. As Jaysing was situated the honour of the Rajput was at variance with the subsisting arrangement between him and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. This may account for his hesitating to comply with their demands; but he at last came to an agreement with B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and yielded him the government of M\u00e1lwa in the following year, and for the time the emperor, by Jaysing's persuasions, tacitly acquiesced in the arrangement.\n\nDuring the Peshwa's absence K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle, the Sena S\u00e1heb Subha, had been accused of disobedience and confined at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and Raghuji the son of K\u00e1nhoji's cousin Bimb\u00e1ji had been appointed Sena S\u00e1heb Subha in his stead. Raghuji had accompanied Sh\u00e1hu in his excursions and by his boldness and skill as a hunter had ingratiated himself with Sh\u00e1hu and obtained a great ascendancy over him. Sh\u00e1hu married him to the sister of one of his own wives of the Shirke family, which, except their having the same surname, and that possibly they may have been originally relations and rivals for the hereditary right of p\u00e1t\u00edl of their village, is the only connection which can be traced between the Bhonsle families of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and N\u00e1gpur. On receiving the sanads for Ber\u00e1r, Raghuji gave a bond to maintain a body of 5000 horse for the service of the state, to pay yearly a sum of \u00a390,000 (Rs. 9 lakhs), and, exclusive of gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na or forage money, a tribute which since the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m the Sena S\u00e1heb Subha had been allowed to reserve, to pay to the head of the government half of all other tribute, prize property, and contributions. He also bound himself to raise 10,000 horse when required and to accompany the Peshwa or to proceed to any quarter where he might be ordered. This arrangement was effected during the absence of Shripatr\u00e1v Pratinidhi who had been sent into the Konkan by the R\u00e1ja. The Pratinidhi being the friend of K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle endeavoured to obtain some mitigation of his sentence, but failed. K\u00e1nhoji, who was an officer of great enterprise died at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra after having lived there many years a prisoner at large.\n\nWhether Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk had made any preparations in consequence of these dissensions is uncertain; but Chinn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa conceived or affected to believe that he meditated an attack. He therefore pitched his camp about forty miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, leaving Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav with an inconsiderable body of horse, being the only troops at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the immediate interest of the Peshwa. When B\u00e1jir\u00e1v advanced into M\u00e1lwa, it was his design to engage the R\u00e1ja's mind with petty affairs in the Konkan. Divisions of authority, contending factions, and the turbulent disposition of some of its inhabitants afforded ample field within the small tract from Goa to Bombay for engaging and fatiguing attention.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 228.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 230. There is a tradition of their having been rivals in an hereditary dispute which may have been invented to prejudice the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra against the Bhonsles of N\u00e1gpur and to prevent their desire to adopt any member of that family. It is a point of honour to maintain the hereditary difference.\n3 He had made some partial conquests in Gondvan and headed one incursion into Katak.\nS\u00e1vant the principal deshmukh of V\u00e1di occupied his hereditary territory in that quarter but having suffered from K\u00e1nhoji \u00c1ngria\u2019s attacks before the late peace (1730) between the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kolh\u00e1pur he always bore an enmity to Angria\u2019s family. K\u00e1nhoji \u00c1ngria\u2019s death happened in 1728, and all attempts to reduce his power before that time on the part of the English, the Portuguese, and the Dutch had failed. In the quarrels between his sons which followed K\u00e1nhoji\u2019s death, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v helped M\u00e1n\u00e1ji and obtained from him the cession of Kotaligad in Th\u00e1na and R\u00e1jm\u00e1chi in Poona. The Sidi, besides defending against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the districts which had been placed under his charge by Aurangzeb, including Mah\u00e1d, R\u00e1ygad, D\u00e1bhol, and Anjanvel, frequently levied contributions from Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s districts. As force was not likely to prevail, the Pratinidhi, Jiv\u00e1ji Khander\u00e1v Chitnis, and others of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s ministers formed schemes for ruining the Sidi by intrigue. For this purpose the Pratinidhi gained one Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n a daring pirate who possessed the entire confidence of the Sidi. To aid this scheme a force was sent into the Konkan in 1733 under the Pratinidhi, his chief agent Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev, and Ud\u00e1ji Chavh\u00e1n. The intrigues were unsuccessful, and a war ensued in which the Pratinidhi was worsted and the fort of Govalkot in Ratn\u00e1giri though strongly garrisoned was disgracefully surprised and taken. Chinn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa incurred the R\u00e1ja\u2019s displeasure for not sending assistance to Shripatr\u00e1v after repeated orders. Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav was at length despatched, but as none of the other officers at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra would undertake to support the Pratinidhi except on condition of receiving the conquered districts in j\u00e1gir, he was compelled to return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with great loss of reputation. About this time the Sidi died and a quarrel ensued between his sons. Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n immediately embraced the cause of Sidi Rehman one of the sons and called on Sh\u00e1hu for support (1735); but nothing could be done until the return of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, who, after leaving Holkar and Sindia in M\u00e1lwa, returned to the Deccan, and on crossing the God\u00e1vari intimated to the R\u00e1ja that he should march straight to Danda-R\u00e1jpuri. All the disposable infantry were directed to join the Peshwa, and Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav was sent off, reinforced with a body of horse, to support Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Holkar in M\u00e1lwa. Sidi Rehman and Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n joined B\u00e1jir\u00e1v who began operations by attacking some of the forts. Fattehsing Bhonsle and the Pratinidhi proceeded to co-operate, but the only help they gave was to recover Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s capital R\u00e1ygad, the commandant of which had been previously corrupted by Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n. The Peshwa reduced the forts of Tala and Ghos\u00e1la and besieged Janjira but was obliged to listen to overtures made by the besieged, who ceded to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the forts of R\u00e1ygad, Tala, Ghos\u00e1la, Auchitgad, and Birv\u00e1di. After this successful close of hostilities, B\u00e1jirav, with additional power and influence, returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and was appointed Subhed\u00e1r of the late acquisitions. Holkar completely overran M\u00e1lwa and the country south of the Chambal and took possession of several places. Afterwards, on the persuasion of\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 233.\nKant\u00e1ji Kadam B\u00e1nde, he made an incursion into Gujar\u00e1t, and they both levied contributions as far as the Ban\u00e1s and plundered several towns to the north of Ahmadabad including Idar and P\u00e1lanpur.\n\nIn 1736, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, owing to the vast army he had kept up to secure his conquests and to overcome his rivals, had become deeply involved in debt. His troops were in arrears; the bankers to whom he already owed a personal debt of many l\u00e1khs of rupees, refused to make further advances, and he complained bitterly of the constant mutinies and clamours in his camp which occasioned him much vexation and distress. Part of the distress originated in the high rates of interest which he was obliged to pay in order to outbid Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk and secure the best of the Deccan soldiery. He levied the chauth and sardeshmukhi in M\u00e1lwa and applied through R\u00e1ja Jaysing for their formal cession in that province, and likewise for a confirmation of the deeds granted by Sar Buland Kh\u00e1n for Gujar\u00e1t. The Tur\u00e1ni Moghals who formed a considerable party in the ministry were decidedly against a compromise so disgraceful. Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n and the emperor, by whom it had already been tacitly yielded, were disposed by the advice of Jaysing to acknowledge the title in due form; but in the course of the negotiation which ensued between the Imperial minister and the Peshwa both parties went beyond their original intentions and hastened the advancing reconciliation between Muhammad Sh\u00e1h and Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. The emperor in the first instance agreed to relinquish in the form of an assignment \u00a3130,000 (Rs. 13 l\u00e1khs) of the revenue of the districts south of the Chambal for the ensuing (1737) season, payable by three instalments at stated periods; and to grant an authority to the Peshwa to levy a tribute from the Rajput states from Bundi and Kota on the west to Budavar on the east, fixing the annual amount at \u00a3106,000 (Rs. 10,60,000). This concession, Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n probably expected, was more likely to create enmity than establish friendship between the Rajputs and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. This minister imagined himself superior to a Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hman in political artifice and continued to negotiate when he should have had no thought but to chastise. R\u00e1ja Jaysing was the medium through whom Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n sent an envoy of his own named Y\u00e1dgir Kh\u00e1n to treat with B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. The sanads for the chauth and sardeshmukhi were secretly prepared and given to the agent with instructions to reserve them. But Dhondopant Purandhare, the Peshwa\u2019s Vakil residing with Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n, discovered this preliminary admission and apprized B\u00e1jir\u00e1v of the circumstance. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s demands now exceeded all bounds; and after great discussion he succeeded in gaining the sardeshp\u00e1ndegiri of the Deccan a grant similar to the sardeshmukhi but of five per cent instead of ten. This grant was a stroke levelled at Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk by Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 234. I have fallen into that hell of being beset by creditors, and to pacify s\u00e1vk\u00e1rs and shiled\u00e1rs I am falling at their feet till I have rubbed the skin from my forehead. Thus wrote B\u00e1jir\u00e1v to his mah\u00e1purush the Sv\u00e1mi of Dh\u00e1vadshi a village within a few miles of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Sv\u00e1mi was a much venerated person in the country. The Peshwa\u2019s letters to the Sv\u00e1mi detail the actions of his life in a familiar manner without disguise and are invaluable. Ditto, 232.\nthe immediate effect of rousing the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s jealousy, while encouragement from the Moghal faction and pressing invitations from Muhammad Sh\u00e1h to repair to Delhi and save the empire at length induced Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk to think of turning the scale against his predatory allies. In the meantime negotiations produced no cessation of activity on the part of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and his demands were so exorbitant that, after protracted consultations, it was determined to assemble a vast army by the mere display of which it seemed as if they expected to annihilate the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Peshwa on hearing of Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n\u2019s advance deposited his heavy baggage with his ally in Bundelkhand, and advanced to a position on the banks of the Jamna forty miles south of \u00c1gra. He had attacked the R\u00e1ja of Bud\u00e1var for refusing to settle his claims and levied contributions in every direction. Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Holkar, Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav, and Vithoji Bole committed great depredations in the Do\u00e1b until driven across the Jamna by S\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n who marched from Oudh and unexpectedly assailed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. He wrote an exaggerated account of his success to court stating that he had wounded Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Holkar, killed Vithoji Bole, and driven the whole Mar\u00e1tha army across the Chambal; that 2000 were killed and as many were drowned in the Jamna. On S\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n\u2019s arrival at Agra, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v quitted his ground on the banks of the Jamna and moved north-east to a more open country. Nothing was talked of in Delhi but the hero S\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n who had driven the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s back to the Deccan. I was resolved, said B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, to tell the emperor the truth, to prove that I was still in Hindust\u00e1n and to show him flames and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at the gates of his capital. He advanced at the rate of forty miles a day and pitched his camp in the suburbs of Delhi. He inflicted a severe defeat on the Imperial troops at the very gates of Delhi, and upon a promise of obtaining the government of M\u00e1lwa and \u00a3130,000 (Rs. 13 l\u00e1khs), set out on his return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, where he paid his respects to the R\u00e1ja and immediately proceeded into the Konkan to repel an attack of the Portuguese on M\u00e1n\u00e1ji Angria (1737). The Peshwa succeeded and took M\u00e1n\u00e1ji under his protection on condition of his paying a yearly sum of \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000) and presenting annually to the R\u00e1ja foreign articles from Europe or China to the value of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) more. The war with the Portuguese led to the invasion of S\u00e1lsette, and B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, to secure his conquests in Th\u00e1na and maintain the war against the Portuguese, entertained some Arabs and a very large body of infantry principally M\u00e1valis and Hetkaris. News from Delhi obliged him to withdraw part of his forces from the Konkan. Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk was restored to favour and ordered to drive the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v assembled all the troops he could collect and by the time he reached the Narbada found himself at the head of 80,000 men, though Yashvantr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de and Raghuji Bhonsle had not joined him (1738). In the affair at Bhop\u00e1l, the Niz\u00e1m on the 11th February was compelled to sign a convention at Dur\u00e1i Sar\u00e1i near Seronje, promising in his own handwriting to grant to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the whole of M\u00e1lwa and the complete sovereignty of the territory between the Narbada and the Chambal. To obtain a confirmation of this agreement from the emperor, and to use every endeavour to procure\nthe payment of a subsidy of \u00a3500,000 (Rs. 50 l\u0101khs) to defray his expenses,\u00b9 the Peshwa remained for a time levying contributions south of the Chambal and carrying on negotiations at court where the threatened invasion of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h was creating alarm. At the same time the war with the Portuguese was being vigorously carried on by the Peshwa's brother Chimn\u00e1ji and several forts in Th\u00e1na were taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Raghuji Bhonsle made an incursion to the north as far as Allahabad, defeated and slew the Subhed\u00edr Shuja Kh\u00e1n and returned loaded with booty. These expeditions undertaken without regular sanction were highly resented by B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. He marched from Poona for the purpose of punishing Raghuji's misconduct and sent forward \u00c1vj\u00ed K\u00e1vre to plunder in Ber\u00e1r. \u00c1vj\u00ed was defeated by Raghuji in the end of February 1739. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was preparing to avenge his loss when news reached him of the arrival of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, the defeat of the Moghals, the death of Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n, the capture of S\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, and finally that the victorious Persian was dictating the terms of ransom at the gates of Delhi. These accounts exceedingly alarmed B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. The subsequent intelligence which he received at Nasirabad in Kh\u00e1ndesh informing him of the imprisonment of the emperor, the plunder of Delhi, and the dreadful massacre of many of its inhabitants seemed for a time to overwhelm him. Our quarrel with Raghuji Bhonsle is insignificant, said the Peshwa; the war with the Portuguese is as naught; there is but one enemy in Hindust\u00e1n. He appears to have conceived that N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h would establish himself as emperor, but he was not dismayed when he heard reports that a hundred thousand Persians were advancing to the south. Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, said B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, the whole power of the Deccan must assemble, and I shall spread our Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from the Narbada to the Chambal. He called on N\u00e1sir Jang the Niz\u00e1m's second son to arm against the common foe, and Chimn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa was ordered to desist from the Konkan warfare and join him with all speed. Chimn\u00e1ji was now in possession of the whole of S\u00e1lsette and had begun the siege of Bassein. Notwithstanding offers of submission, Chimn\u00e1ji prosecuted the siege and on the 16th of May Bassein fell. Holkar and Sindia as soon as Bassein fell were sent to join B\u00e1jir\u00e1v with all speed, but by that time news arrived of the retreat of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h. N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h restored the throne to its degraded owner and wrote letters to all the princes of India announcing the event. Among others, he addressed a letter to Sh\u00e1hu and one to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. He informed B\u00e1jir\u00e1v that he had reinstated Muhammad Sh\u00e1h and now considered him as a brother; that although B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was an ancient servant possessing a large army, he had not afforded the emperor assistance; but that all must now attend to Muhammad Sh\u00e1h's commands for if they did not he would return with his army and inflict punishment upon the disobedient.\u00b2\n\nShortly after the departure of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h B\u00e1jir\u00e1v sent a letter to the emperor expressive of his submission and obedience, and a\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 239. \u00b2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 243.\nnazar of 101 gold mohars. This was acknowledged in suitable terms and a splendid khillat was sent in return. He was assured by the emperor that the rank, possessions, and inheritance already conferred on him would be confirmed, and that he might depend on finding his interests best promoted by continuing steadfast in his duty to the Imperial government.\n\nAlthough no new subhed\u00e1r nor any deputy of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk was appointed to M\u00e1lwa, no sanad was sent conferring the government on B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. This omission the Peshwa considered a breach of faith on the part of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk; but as the Niz\u00e1m's army was still in Hindust\u00e1n, and as some of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's best officers and troops were in the Konkan he deferred enforcing his claims until a fitter opportunity. In the meantime he was busy arranging the affairs of the province of M\u00e1lwa and strengthening his connection with the Rajput princes in the western quarter along the banks of the Chambal from Kota to Allahabad, but especially with the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bundelkhand.\n\nThese arrangements to secure the northern frontier were preparatory to a war with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk or an expedition into the Karn\u00e1tak. The late success against Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, his departure from the terms of agreement, his great age, the probability of contentions among his sons encouraged or stimulated the Peshwa to attempt the subjugation of the Deccan. The deficiency of his resources was the chief obstacle which deterred him from this undertaking. On the other hand the prospect of contributions and plunder by which he might liquidate his debts and perhaps some secret encouragement from Arkot, where according to Colonel Wilks the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were invited by the Div\u00e1n of Safdar Ali, were strong allurements for venturing into the Karn\u00e1tak. But B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was critically situated, and circumstances compelled him to choose the Deccan as the theatre of his operations. D\u00e1bh\u00e1de's or rather the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's party who possessed very considerable resources was always hostile to the Peshwa; Raghuji Bhonsle was jealous of the Br\u00e1hman ascendancy; he meditated a revolution by getting the R\u00e1ja into his own power; and as Sh\u00e1hu had no prospect of an heir, Raghuji might have contemplated the acquisition of Mar\u00e1tha supremacy by being adopted as his son. Fattehsing Bhonsle, the only Mar\u00e1tha likely to supersede him in the R\u00e1ja's choice, possessed neither ability nor enterprise, and had failed to create power by acquiring popularity among the soldiery. Raghuji had many difficulties to overcome in prosecuting a scheme of the kind. Although a party existed hostile to the Peshwa, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's friends and dependents surrounded the R\u00e1ja and possessed his ear, if not his entire confidence; nor could Raghuji Bhonsle or Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r concert a plan or transact the slightest business without Br\u00e1hman agency. Should B\u00e1jir\u00e1v quit the position which\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.

Ditto footnote.\nhe occupied between the territories of those two, there would be no obstacle to their uniting against him. The subsisting difference between Raghuji and B\u00e1jir\u00e1v arose from Raghuji's having plundered the province of Allahabad and not having joined B\u00e1jir\u00e1v when he was ordered according to the terms on which he held his lands and title. The Peshwa affirmed that Raghuji had no authority to levy contributions north of the Narbada and declared his determination, at the time of marching from Poona in the end of 1738, to enforce restitution not to the owners but to the Mar\u00e1tha state and to punish the aggression. A temporary compromise took place on the arrival of the Persians at Delhi; but the dispute was unsettled and nothing but a sense of injury to their mutual interests prevented an open war.\n\nThis state of affairs laid the foundation of schemes which had a great effect in extending the spreading but unstable power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Though there are few direct proofs to illustrate this part of their history, it is certain that B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Raghuji had a meeting and that they were reconciled, and there is reason to suppose that B\u00e1jir\u00e1v unfolded as much of his schemes to Raghuji as were necessary to engage his co-operation, and the plunder of the Karn\u00e1tak, an eventual addition to his own territories in the Deccan, and a future partition of Bengal and North India may have been urged by the Peshwa to excite Raghuji's ambition and cupidity. In this conference may also be seen the real source from which a host of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were poured into the Karn\u00e1tak.\n\nIn prosecution of his plans of conquest in the Deccan, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v seizing the opportunity afforded by the absence of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk at Delhi, about the end of 1740 began operations against the Niz\u00e1m's son N\u00e1sir Jang. The war proved unprofitable and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s gladly entered on terms of accommodation and a treaty was concluded at Mungi-Paithan by which both parties pledged themselves to maintain peace and mutually to refrain from plundering in the Deccan. Hindia and Kirkaun, districts on the banks of the Narbada, were conferred on B\u00e1jir\u00e1v in j\u00e1gir, and the Peshwa without visiting Poona or S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, in great vexation amounting almost to despair, set off with his army towards North India.\u00b9\n\nIn the meantime M\u00e1n\u00e1ji \u00c1ngria attacked by his brother had applied to the Peshwa's son B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, generally called N\u00e1na S\u00e1heb, who was with the R\u00e1ja in the neighbourhood of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. 500 men were sent to support the garrison and an express despatched to Chimm\u00e1ji \u00c1pa for instructions. Chimm\u00e1ji had ordered his nephew to repair to Kol\u00e1ba in person and applied to the Governor in Council at Bombay with whom he had concluded a treaty and maintained a friendly intercourse since his late campaign in the Konkan to support the garrison at Kol\u00e1ba.

They were concerting plans for the reduction of Revdanda when news reached them of the death of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v which happened on the banks of the Narbada on the 28th of April 1740. On receiving this intelligence Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan was appointed Subhed\u00e1r of the Konkan and Khanduji Mankar was left in command of a body of troops, while Chimn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa and his nephew, after the usual mourning ceremonies, returned to Poona, and shortly after to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v left three sons B\u00e1l\u00e1ji, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, Raghum\u00e1thr\u00e1v afterwards so well known to the English, and Jan\u00e1rdan B\u00e1ba who died in early youth. He also left one illegitimate son by a Muhammadan mother, whom he bred a Musalm\u00e1n and named Samsher Bah\u00e1dur.\n\nThe army which entered the Karn\u00e1tak under the command of Raghuji Bhonsle was composed of troops belonging to the R\u00e1ja, the Peshwa, the Pratinidhi, Fattehsing Bhonsle, and various chiefs of less note. The Ghorpades of Sondur and Guti were invited to join by letters from Sh\u00e1hu and the Peshwa; and Mur\u00e1rr\u00e1v the grand-nephew of the famous Sant\u00e1ji Ghorpade and the adopted son and heir of Mur\u00e1rr\u00e1v of Guti appeared under the national standard for the first time since the death of his distinguished and ill-requited relation. The whole force amounted to 50,000 men. Dost Ali the Naw\u00e1b of the Karn\u00e1tak fell and the Div\u00e1n was made a prisoner. After this the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s began to levy contributions all over the Karn\u00e1tak until bought off by the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s son and heir Safdar Ali, with whom, before retiring, they entered into a secret compact to destroy Chanda S\u00e1heb then in possession of Trichinopoli. While the main body of his army remained encamped on the Shivganga, Raghuji Bhonsle returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and endeavoured to prevent B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s succession as Peshwa by proposing B\u00e1puji N\u00e1ik of B\u00e1r\u00e1mati, a connexion but an enemy of the late Peshwa, for the vacant office. B\u00e1puji N\u00e1ik was possessed of great wealth and his enmity to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v arose from a very common cause that of having lent money which his debtor could not repay. Raghuji\u2019s party used the irritated creditor as their tool and very large sums were offered to Sh\u00e1hu on condition of B\u00e1puji\u2019s being raised to the vacant Peshwaship. The Pratinidhi, although averse from the supremacy of the Peshwa was still more hostile to the pretensions of Raghuji, and as he did not engage in the intrigue, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v aided by his uncle Chimn\u00e1ji was at last invested in August 1740. A more serious cause of uneasiness to B\u00e1l\u00e1ji arose from his being answerable for his father\u2019s debts and B\u00e1puji N\u00e1ik enforced his demand with harassing pertinacity. From this persecution B\u00e1l\u00e1ji was relieved by the influence and credit of his Div\u00e1n Mah\u00e1dad\u00edjpant Purandhare, a service of which the Peshwa ever after retained a grateful recollection. Raghuji, on finding his schemes abortive, carried B\u00e1puji N\u00e1ik with him towards the Karn\u00e1tak and returned to reap the expected harvest at Trichinopoli accompanied by Shripatr\u00e1v the Pratinidhi and Fattehsing Bhonsle. Trichinopoli surrendered on the 26th of March 1741, and Chanda S\u00e1heb was brought a prisoner to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where he remained in the custody of an agent of Raghuji Bhonsle\u2019s till he was set free.\nin 1748. Mur\u00e1rr\u00e1v Ghorpade was left in command of the fort of Trichinopoli, and a part of his garrison was composed of infantry belonging to the Peshwa. Their expenses were defrayed by Sh\u00e1hu, besides which it was settled that \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) of the share of tribute from the province of \u00c1rkot should be annually paid to B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v.\n\nOne of the first acts of the new Peshwa was to forward petitions to Delhi respecting various promises made to his father. These applications were transmitted through Jaysing and Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. A supply of ready money was what B\u00e1l\u00e1ji most earnestly craved and \u00a3150,000 (Rs. 15 l\u00f3khs) as a free gift were granted by the emperor. Proposals for an agreement were then drawn up in the joint names of the Peshwa and Chimm\u00e1ji \u00c1pa in which they asked to have the government of M\u00e1lwa, which, on the death of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, was conferred on Azam-ulla Kh\u00e1n. If the government of M\u00e1lwa was granted they promised to pay their respects to the emperor; to prevent any other Mar\u00e1tha crossing the Narbada; to send a body of 500 horse under an officer of rank to remain in attendance on the emperor\u2019s person; and to ask no more than the gift of money already bestowed. They agreed to send 4000 horse for service who would punish refractory landholders as far as their numbers would enable them, and they promised not to sequestrate the rent-free lands or j\u00e1girs assigned for charitable or religious purposes. No notice seems to have been taken of the application. But B\u00e1l\u00e1ji, whose disposition was conciliatory, was anxious to have the government of M\u00e1lwa conferred as a right according to the treaty with his father. With this object when Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk was marching to the Deccan, in order to suppress his son N\u00e1sir Jang\u2019s revolt, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji paid (1741) him a respectful visit near the Narbada and sent a body of his troops to join him. At this time he sustained a great loss in the death of his uncle Chimm\u00e1ji \u00c1pa which happened in the end of January 1741. Eleven days before this event, Khanduji M\u00e1nkar under Chimm\u00e1ji\u2019s direction had reduced Revdanda the last place remaining to the Portuguese between Goa and Daman. Chimm\u00e1ji \u00c1pa from his successes against the Portuguese has a greater reputation among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s as an officer than he probably deserved.\n\nOn the death of his uncle, the Peshwa returned from the northern districts and spent nearly a year in civil arrangements at Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Continuing to show the greatest respect for the R\u00e1ja, he obtained from Sh\u00e1hu a grant by which the whole territory conquered from the Portuguese was conferred on him, and also, except in Gujar\u00e1t, the exclusive right of collecting the revenues and of levying contributions north of the Narbada. In 1742, Bh\u00e1skarpant the Div\u00e1n of Raghuji Bhonsle of Ber\u00e1r, carried\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 255. Chanda S\u00e1heb or Hussain Dost Kh\u00e1n does not appear to have been confined in the fort nor to have endured a close imprisonment, but merely to have had an attendant guard wherever he went. This supposition is confirmed by the ease with which Duplex appears to have intrigued with him during his term of imprisonment.\n\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 256.\nhis arms eastwards, but the Peshwa eager to establish his power over those territories for which the authority obtained from the R\u00e1ja was as usual assumed as a right, marched though late in the season, towards Hindust\u00e1n and made himself master of Garha and Mundela before the rains set in. He was obliged to encamp on the banks of the Narbada during the rainy season, and probably meditated an expedition into Allahabad when he was called upon to defend his rights in M\u00e1lwa which was invaded by Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and B\u00e1bur\u00e1v Sad\u00e1shiv. This inroad seems to have been instigated by Raghuji to obstruct the Peshwa's progress eastward; and on B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's arrival in M\u00e1lwa the army of Gujar\u00e1t retired. On this occasion \u00c1nandr\u00e1v Pov\u00e1r was confirmed by the Peshwa in the possession of Dh\u00e1r and the surrounding districts, a politic measure which not only secured Pov\u00e1r in his interests, but opposed a barrier on the western side of M\u00e1lwa to incursions from Gujar\u00e1t. Since the Peshwa's arrival at Mundela a negotiation had been going on between him and the emperor through the mediation of R\u00e1ja Jaysing supported by Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. The chauth of the imperial territory was promised and a khillat more splendid than had ever been conferred on his father was transmitted to B\u00e1l\u00e1ji. It does not appear that any deed for collecting this general chauth was ever granted by Muhammad Sh\u00e1h; sums of money and convenient assignments were the mode of payment. The object in the pending treaty was on the Peshwa's part to obtain sanads for the promised government of M\u00e1lwa, and on the part of the court of Delhi to procrastinate and to widen the breach between the Peshwa and Raghuji Bhonsle.\n\nIn the meantime Bh\u00e1skarpant had invaded B\u00e1h\u00e1r. The Mar\u00e1tha army consisted of 10,000 or 12,000 horse and report had swelled their numbers to nearly four times that amount. Bh\u00e1skarpant obtained the possession of the town of Hugli and most of the towns from Katva to the neighbourhood of Mi\u00e1napur fell into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Raghuji also advanced to Bengal. The emperor ordered Safdar Jang the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh to drive out Bh\u00e1skarpant, and at the same time applied to B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v to afford his aid. As inducements to the Peshwa an assignment for the arrears of chauth due from Azimabad was sent to him by the emperor and an assurance of confirming him in the government of M\u00e1lwa. The reward was prized too highly and the service was too desirable to be refused. On B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's approach, Raghuji decamped and retreated towards the hills. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji overtook, attacked, and defeated Raghuji's army. Bh\u00e1skarpant retreated through Orissa and B\u00e1l\u00e1ji returned to M\u00e1lwa in order to secure the long-promised government. The Peshwa's conduct left no reasonable excuse on the part of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h for refusing to perform the engagement; but to save the credit of the imperial name, the feeble palliative of conferring the appointment on the Peshwa as the deputy of Prince Ahmad, the emperor's son, was adopted. The rest of the treaty differs little from the former proposals made in the joint names of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji and his uncle Chimn\u00e1ji, except that instead of 4000, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji promised to furnish 12,000 horse the expense of the additional 8000 being payable by the emperor. Jaysing between whom and\nB\u00e1l\u00e1ji the most friendly intercourse subsisted, was guarantee for the observance of the treaty with Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, and Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1v Holkar, R\u00e1noji Sindia, and Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav declared in due form that should the Peshwa recede from his duties they would quit his service. The Peshwa returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to pay his respects and go through the form of producing his accounts of the revenue. These accounts were made out by the Peshwa as a general in command of a body of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s troops.\n\nIn 1744 Raghuji Bhonsle sent agents to the Peshwa assuring him of his sincere desire of reconciliation and of his conviction that the plans of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v were those best suited to his own and to the real interests of the Mar\u00e1tha nation. He continued the same profession with apparent sincerity, but as he was on full march towards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the Peshwa thought it necessary to be on his guard, particularly as Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r was also approaching. The Pratinidhi had become infirm by sickness, but his mut\u00e1l\u00edk Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev was an active able man, adverse to the Peshwa\u2019s supremacy, and, although not leagued with Raghuji, intimately connected with the faction of D\u00e1bh\u00e1de. Under these circumstances B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had to choose between a war with the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs or the resignation of Bengal to Raghuji. The question did not admit of hesitation; he chose the resignation of Bengal to Raghuji. At the same time as it was understood that the country north of the Mah\u00e1nadi as well as of the Narbada was comprehended in his agreement with the emperor, he made a merit of conceding his right of levying tribute to Raghuji, and a secret compact in which the R\u00e1ja was used as a mediator was finally concluded. The object of the contracting parties seems avowedly to have been not so much an alliance as an agreement to avoid interference with each other. The R\u00e1ja\u2019s authority was in this instance convenient to both. A sanad was given to the Peshwa conferring on him his original mok\u00e1s\u00e1, all the j\u00e1girs bestowed on himself or acquired by his father or grandfather, the governments of the Konkan and M\u00e1lwa, and the shares of revenue or tribute from Allahabad, \u00c1gra, and Ajmir; three sub-divisions in the district of P\u00e1tna, \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) from the province of Arkot, and a few detached villages in Raghuji\u2019s districts. On the other hand, it was settled that the revenues and contributions from Lakhnau, P\u00e1tna, and Lower Bengal including B\u00e1h\u00e1r should be collected by Raghuji who was also vested with the sole authority of levying tribute from the whole territory from Ber\u00e1r to Katak. It was also agreed that Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r should be obliged to account to the Peshwa for the amount of the contributions he had levied in M\u00e1lwa, but nothing was urged at this time respecting the large arrears due by D\u00e1bh\u00e1de to the head of the government. It does not appear that any settlement was concluded but Dam\u00e1ji seems to have remained in the Deccan, although his presence was much required in Gujar\u00e1t. The Peshwa\u2019s southern and eastern boundaries in North India were well defined.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 259. It is a remarkable fact that after the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra had become perfect ciphers in the Mar\u00e1tha government, the Peshwa\u2019s accounts continued to the last to be made out in the manner described. Ditto.\nby the Narbada, the Son, and the Ganges but the sanad delivered on this occasion authorized him to push his conquests to the northward as far as practicable.\n\nRaghuji Bhonsle was intent on reviving his lost footing in Bengal; and the Peshwa in order to excuse himself to the emperor for not acting against Raghuji remained in the Deccan. As soon as the season opened Bhashkarpant was sent with 20,000 horse into Bengal by Raghuji, but along with twenty officers was treacherously murdered by Aliverdi Khan in an entertainment and the army retreated to Berar. Raghuji himself proceeded to the scene of action, and, partially defeated while returning, succeeded in annexing Devgad and Chanda to his territory. Shortly after Raghuji had entered Bengal, Balaji Bajirav went (1745) to Malwa, addressed letters to the emperor full of assurances of perpetual fidelity, but excused himself from paying his respects in the royal presence. He expressed surprise at Aliverdi Khan's inactivity in not repulsing Raghuji, which the emperor in his reply accounted for by charging Balaji with not having stopped the passes in Raghuji's rear as preconcerted. But the agreement which had taken place with Raghuji precluded all interference; the Peshwa evaded the discussion, and on pretence of business in the Deccan, after making his yearly collections speedily returned to Poona.\n\nIn 1746 the Peshwa sent his cousin Sadashiv Chimnaji Bhau accompanied by Sakharam Bapu the writer of Mahadajipant Purandhare on an expedition into the Karnatak to punish some of the deshmukhs who had driven out the posts of the Peshwa's old creditor Bapuji Naik Baramatikar. That person by the interest of Raghuji Bhonsle had obtained the chauth and sardeshmukhi between the Krishna and Tungbhadra in farm from the Raja for the yearly sum of \u00a370,000 (Rs. 7 lakh); but the opposition he experienced and the heavy charges for maintaining the troops totally ruined him in a few years. The expense of the present expedition added to his embarrassment, but he would not, as was proposed to him, agree to give up the contract in favour of Sadashiv Chimnaji. Sadashiv Chimnaji levied contributions as far as the Tungbhadra and reduced Bahadur Benda to which the Marathas had a claim of long standing. On Sadashiv Chimnaji's return from this expedition, he was invested by the Raja with the same rank as had been enjoyed by his father, that is second-in-command under the Peshwa, and being ambitious and bolder than his cousin the Peshwa he began to assume considerable power. He chose as his writers Vasudev Joshi and Raghunath Hari, two able men brought up under Kanhoji Angria. In 1747 the Peshwa himself concluded a new and more specific agreement with the Rajas of Bundelkhand, by which, after deducting the district which had been ceded to the late Peshwa, one-third of the territory estimated at \u00a3165,000 (Rs. 16\u00bd lakh) was made over to Balaji Bajirav besides a like share from the profits of the diamond mines of Panna. During this period of comparative tranquillity\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Marathas, 260.\nthe Peshwa encouraged agriculture, protected the villagers and grain merchants, and improvement was everywhere visible. But about this time events occurred in North India, in the Deccan, and in the Madras Karn\u00e1tak, which were the forerunners of fresh troubles and great revolutions in every part of India.\n\nIn 1749, the Deccan which was completely drained of troops presented an inviting field to the Peshwa, but domestic arrangements of the utmost importance demanded his presence at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1hu had for some years been in a state of mental imbecility brought on, it was said, through grief for the death of his youngest wife Sagun\u00e1b\u00e1i of the Mohite family.\u00b9 As his health declined, Sh\u00e1hu recovered the use of his intellect,\u00b2 and the dependents of the Peshwa about his person urged him to adopt a son. The R\u00e1ja on the loss of his only child, some time before his derangement, contrary to all his former invectives against him had declared that he would adopt Sambh\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur provided he had issue. As Sambh\u00e1ji had no children, it was proposed that an inquiry should be made for some lineal descendant of Vithoji the brother of Mal\u00f3ji the grandfather of the great Shiv\u00e1ji. Search was accordingly made, but none was discovered. It was then suggested that he should take the son of some respectable shiled\u00e1r of the p\u00e1t\u00edl family. This proposal, Sh\u00e1hu said, he had a strong reason for declining. At last he told Mah\u00e1d\u00e1jipant Purandhare and Govindr\u00e1v Chitnis that T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i who was still living in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, had somewhere hid her grandson R\u00e1m the son of the second Shiv\u00e1ji who was born in 1712 after the death of his father. It is not known by what means Sh\u00e1hu became possessed of this secret; and the subject, intricate in itself, had been so studiously involved in mystery as to excite a suspicion that the Peshwa was convinced of the legitimacy of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, and found it necessary for the purpose of rendering him insignificant to invent or at least to connive at the insinuation that the whole was a trick of state. T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i on hearing of the intended adoption of Sambh\u00e1ji of Kolh\u00e1pur was heard to say \u2018I will prevent that,\u2019 and on being closely questioned and encouraged declared the existence of her grandson. The elder surviving wife of Sh\u00e1hu, Sakv\u00e1rb\u00e1i of the Shirke family, on being acquainted with this declaration on the part of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i which deprived her of all chance of power, incited Sambh\u00e1ji to oppose the alleged grandson of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i whom she declared\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 265. Sh\u00e1hu was for some time afflicted with that harmless silly madness which is sometimes ludicrous, even whilst it excites commisseration. It first appeared on an occasion when he had to receive a visit from two Mar\u00e1tha Sard\u00e1rs in full d\u00e1rbar, by his dressing out his favourite dog in gold brocade, covered with jewels and putting his own turban on the dog. He never resumed any covering for his head after he recovered his senses. This dog had once saved his life when hunting a tiger, and amongst other freaks, he issued sanads conferring a jagir upon him, and entitling him to use a palanquin in all which the R\u00e1ja was humoured and the palanquin establishment kept. Ditto, footnote.\n\n\u00b2 Sh\u00e1hu had some wit and his reply to a letter about this time from R\u00e1ja Jaysing of Jaypur shows that he retained it to the last. The R\u00e1ja asked what he had performed for the Hindu faith and what charities he had bestowed. I have, replied Sh\u00e1hu, conquered from the Musalm\u00e1ns the whole country from R\u00e1meshvar to Delhi and I have given it to the Br\u00e1hmans, Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 266 footnote.\nan impostor. She promised to aid Sambh\u00e1ji to her utmost, and engaged Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev in her cause. Jagjivan the younger brother of Shripatrav who had been appointed Pratini-dhi on the death of Shripatrav in 1747, also promised her all the support in his power. Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r gave his assent to the proposal, and emissaries were despatched into the Gh\u00e1tmatha and the Konkan, a tract ever prone to insurrection, to raise men and be prepared for her purpose. B\u00e1la\u00edji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v repaired to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with an army of 35,000 men, but so cautious was he of committing any act which might outrage the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 feeling, already jealous of Br\u00e1hman power, that he did not attempt to separate Sakv\u00e1rb\u00e1i from her husband or to impose any restraint likely to arouse the active enmity of her relations. Although he knew the extent of her plots, and was also aware that Sakv\u00e1rb\u00e1i had a plan to assassinate him, he was at the same time suspicious of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, whose known enmity to B\u00e1la\u00edji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v is indeed the principal evidence in support of her extraordinary story. The pregnancy of Bhav\u00e1n\u00edb\u00e1i the wife of the second Shiv\u00e1ji, was strongly suspected by R\u00e1jasb\u00e1i the younger wife of R\u00e1j\u00e1ram at the time of Shiv\u00e1ji's death, and it required all the care and circumspection of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i to keep the infant from destruction. She found means to convey the child from the fort of Panh\u00e1la and having given him in charge to the sister of Bhav\u00e1n\u00edb\u00e1i he was carried to Tulj\u00e1pur and thence to B\u00e1rsi in Shol\u00e1pur where he was reared in obscurity. The Peshwa was at a loss what to do. During three months spent at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra before Sh\u00e1hu's death, he was alternately swayed by ambition and apprehension. He thought of at once asserting his supremacy by setting aside the R\u00e1ja entirely. But on the whole he considered it most expedient to support the assertion of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i. Yet, though he was scrupulous in every outward form of respect towards the prince whom he acknowledged, he was not afterwards desirous of suppressing a current report at Poona that the whole was fictitious. When the power of the Peshwa was complete, and the end was gained, such a pageant as the R\u00e1ja, in some respects, was inconvenient to the usurper, and to countenance a belief of the imposture was the first step to his being wholly set aside. But the voice of the country was too strong and an heir of the house of Shiv\u00e1ji would have been joined by thousands. Sakv\u00e1rb\u00e1i, to conceal her plot, always gave out that in the event of Sh\u00e1hu's death she would burn with the body. This declaration proved her ruin, for the wily Br\u00e1hman affected to believe it, and took care to circulate the report until it became so general that its non-fulfilment would, in the eyes of the whole country, have been a reflection on the\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 267. The following letter from Sad\u00e1shiv Chimm\u00e1ji to the Peshwa recommends his usurping the power at once. After compliments: It seems impossible to judge of what will be the result of all this. The B\u00e1\u00ed's doings are not to be depended upon; keep continually on your guard. The B\u00e1\u00ed is not a person to blunder in that which she sets about. Let nothing induce you to act contrary to what has hitherto been professed, or let any thing appear respecting your intentions; but in the event of the R\u00e1ja's decease, you must take the upper hand of all.

Although Sakv\u00e1rb\u00e1i seldom quitted the R\u00e1ja, and kept him constantly surrounded by persons in her interest, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji found means to obtain a private interview, at which he induced the R\u00e1ja to give him a deed empowering the Peshwa to manage the whole government of the Mar\u00e1tha empire, on condition of his perpetuating the R\u00e1ja's name and keeping up the dignity of the house of Shiv\u00e1ji through the grandson of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i and his descendants. This paper also directed that the Kolh\u00e1pur state should always be considered an independent sovereignty; that the j\u00e1girs now existing were to be confirmed to the holders, leaving power with the Peshwa to conclude such arrangements with the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs as might be beneficial for extending Hindu power, for protecting the temples of the gods, the cultivators of the fields, and whatsoever was sacred or useful.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja had scarcely ceased to breathe when a body of horse galloped into the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, surrounded and seized the Pratinidhi and his mut\u00e1l\u00edk Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev, placed them in irons, and sent them off strongly escorted to distant hill forts. Every avenue about the town was occupied by troops, and a garrison of the Peshwa's was placed in the fort, while a party was detached to reinforce the escort of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja who had not arrived when Sh\u00e1hu died. Sakv\u00e1rb\u00e1i had not recovered from the first emotions of consternation and rage at finding her whole plans unmasked and defeated, when the Peshwa sent her an insidious message begging that she would not think of burning with the body of her husband for that he and all her servants were ready to obey her commands. Not content with working on the mind of an angry woman to incite her to self-destruction, he sent for her brother Ko\u00e1rji Shirke, represented the dishonour that threatened to attach to his house, and promised him a j\u00e1gir in the Konkan if he persuaded his sister to burn herself, not only for the honour of the family of Shirke, but for the honour of all India under the sway of the late R\u00e1ja. By these arts B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v secured his victim.\u00b9\n\nBefore Sh\u00e1hu's death, orders in his name had been sent to Yashvantr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de and Raghuji Bhonsle requiring their presence at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Yashvantr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de had become totally imbecile from debauchery, and as had probably been foreseen neither D\u00e1bh\u00e1de nor Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r the commander of his army attended. Most of the other j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs were present, but if any were disposed to resist the Peshwa's authority, they remained passive until they should see what part Raghuji Bhonsle would play. Raghuji's ambition was now controlled by the caution of age and the teaching of experience. He was not only intent on directing yearly raids into Bengal, but owing to the absence of his son J\u00e1noji in the Karn\u00e1tak with 10,000 horse and to the number of troops which he\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 268. Those of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's countrymen who knew the secret history of this transaction and whose minds had not been perverted by the calm villainy of a Br\u00e1hman court did not attempt to palliate it as a sacrifice in conformity with their faith: On the contrary they mentioned it with detestation and said that even the ordinary mode of execution would have been more manly and less objectionable. Do.\nwas compelled to leave in his own territories he arrived at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the month of January 1750, with a force of only 12,000 men. His disposition was pacific towards B\u00e1l\u00e1ji but he made some demur in acknowledging R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja. He required, in testimony of his being a Bhonsla and the grandson of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, that T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i should first eat with him in presence of the caste, deposing on the food they ate together that R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja was her grandson. When this was complied with in the most solemn manner, Raghuji declared himself satisfied; and after a long conference with the Peshwa he gave his assent to the propriety of the plans submitted for his consideration. As a proof of the good understanding which subsisted between them, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji took occasion to proceed in advance to Poona, leaving the R\u00e1ja in Raghuji's charge, and requesting that he would accompany him to Poona with the whole of the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, for the purpose of concluding the arrangements made by the will of the late Sh\u00e1hu R\u00e1ja. From this period (1750) Poona took the place of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as the capital of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\nIn the success of his schemes, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji almost overlooked T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, who though upwards of seventy years of age, soon convinced him that it was dangerous to slight a woman of her spirit. On pretence of paying her devotions at her husband's tomb in Sinhgad near Poona she went there and endeavoured to persuade the Pant Sachiv to declare for her as head of the Mar\u00e1tha empire. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji, after much persuasion, induced her to come to Poona, and having flattered her ambition with the hope of a large share in the administration, at last obtained her influence with R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja in confirming the many schemes he had now to carry into effect. Raghuji Bhonsle received new deeds for Ber\u00e1r, Gondvan, and Bengal, and some lands which had belonged to the Pratinidhi adjoining Ber\u00e1r. The title deeds for half of Gujar\u00e1t were sent to Yashvantr\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de, which, as he had never yet accounted for a share of the revenue to the state, gave Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r to understand what he might expect from the growing power of the Peshwa. About this time R\u00e1noji Sindia died and his eldest son Jay\u00e1pa was confirmed in his estates. The whole of M\u00e1lwa estimated at about \u00a315 millions (Rs. 150 l\u00e1khs) of yearly revenue except about \u00a3100,000 (Rs. 10 l\u00e1khs), was divided between Holkar and Sindia, and \u00a3745,000 (Rs. 74\u00bd l\u00e1khs) were conferred on Holkar and \u00a3655,000 (Rs. 65\u00bd l\u00e1khs) on Sindia. The remaining \u00a3100,000 (Rs. 10 l\u00e1khs) were held by various j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs of whom An\u00e1ndr\u00e1v Pov\u00e1r was the most considerable. All of them were subservient to the views of the Peshwa and from them he had no opposition to fear. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, without intending to employ them, confirmed the eight Pradh\u00e1ns, and for a short time nominated Gang\u00e1dhar Shrin\u00edv\u00e1s as Pratinidhi; but on the application of Raghuji Bhonsle and of some other j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, when about to return to their districts, he made them a promise to release Jagjivan Parashur\u00e1m and accordingly restored him to his rank and liberty. As the R\u00e1ja's establishment was to be much reduced, and it was necessary to secure in his interests such of his officers as he could not employ, the Peshwa reserved a great part of the Pratinidhi's lands as j\u00e1girs and assignments to the persons in question, particularly the tract west of Karh\u00e1d.\nbetween the Urmudi and the V\u00e1rna where he apprehended an insurrection supported by the R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur. Fattehsing Bhonsle the adopted son of Sh\u00e1hu was confirmed in the possession of his j\u00e1gir, in various minor claims, in shares of revenue, and in the title of R\u00e1ja of Akalkot, which, except the detached claims alluded to, are still enjoyed by his descendants. An appointment created by Sh\u00e1hu for a relation of the Mantri, and which was termed Aj\u00e1hut Sardeshmukh or general agent for collecting the sardeshmukhi was nominally preserved; but j\u00e1gir lands were assigned in lieu of the right of interference in the collection of the ten per cent on the six subh\u00e1s of the Deccan. The appointment of Sar Lashkar was taken from the family of Somvanshi and given to Nimb\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik Nimb\u00e1lkar. All these changes and appointments were made in the name of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, but it was now well understood that the Peshwa\u2019s authority was supreme in the state and generally admitted without dissatisfaction. Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev, who recovered his liberty at the same time with the Pratinidhi, threw himself into the fort of S\u00e1ngola near Pandharpur where he raised an insurrection and made head against the Peshwa until he was suppressed by the Peshwa\u2019s cousin Sad\u00e1shiv Chimn\u00e1ji. In the measures which have been detailed the Peshwa owed much of his success to his Div\u00e1n Mah\u00e1d\u00e1jipant, who, next to his cousin Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v, possessed the greatest influence over B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1j\u00edr\u00e1v of any of his advisers. Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v on his expedition to S\u00e1ngola was accompanied by R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja for the purpose of giving Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev no excuse for resistance. During their stay at that place, the R\u00e1ja agreed to renounce the entire power and to lend his sanction to whatever measures the Peshwa might pursue, provided a small tract round S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was assigned to his own management, conditions to which B\u00e1l\u00e1ji subscribed but which he never fulfilled. The R\u00e1ja under a strong escort returned from S\u00e1ngola to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Peshwa in order to soothe T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed whose great age did not render her less active and intriguing, inadvertently removed his troops from the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and having placed in it the gadkaris and old retainers who had great respect for the widow of Raj\u00e1ram, gave up the entire management to her. The R\u00e1ja was kept with a separate establishment in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, but perfectly at large, and a splendid provision was assigned to him and his officers, the expense of which amounted to the yearly sum of \u00a3650,000 (Rs. 65 l\u00e1khs).\n\nIn 1751, when the Peshwa left for Aurangabad, to support the claims of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-din the elder son of the Niz\u00e1m to the viceroyalty of the Deccan, T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed sounded R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja in regard to his assuming the control usurped by his servant B\u00e1l\u00e1ji the Peshwa; but not finding him fit for her purpose, she pretended to have had no serious intentions in the proposal. At the same time she sent messengers to Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, representing the unguarded state of the country and recommending his immediate march to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to rescue the R\u00e1ja and the Mar\u00e1tha state from the\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 272.\npower of the Br\u00e1hmans. Dam\u00e1ji at once acted on this request and T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, as soon as certain accounts were received of the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r's approach, invited the R\u00e1ja into the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and made him prisoner. She then reproached him with his want of spirit; regretted that she had ever rescued him from a life of obscurity for which only he could have been destined; declared that he could not be her grandson or the descendant of the great Shiv\u00e1ji; that he was neither a Bhonsle nor a Mohite, but a baseborn Gondhali changed in the house where he had been first conveyed; and that she would make atonement on the banks of the holy Krishna for ever having acknowledged him. She ordered the Havild\u00e1r to fire upon his attendants, most of whom unconscious of what had happened remained near the gate of the fort; and she directed the guns to be pointed at the houses in the town below belonging to the partisans of the Konkani Br\u00e1hmans. Trimbakpant commonly called N\u00e1na Purandhare, Govindr\u00e1v Chitnis, and the officers in the Peshwa's interests at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were at first disposed to ridicule this attempt as that of a mad old woman, but, on hearing of the approach of Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r from Songad, they quitted the town and assembled troops at the village of \u00c1rla on the banks of the Krishna. On the advance of the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r by the S\u00e1lpa pass, although they had 20,000 and their opponent only 15,000 men they made an irresolute attack and retired to Nimb about eight miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where they were followed the next day, attacked, and defeated by the Gujar\u00e1t troops. Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r immediately went to pay his respects to T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, and several forts in the neighbourhood were given to her. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was well stored with provisions, and the Pratinidhi promised to aid T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i's cause. News of these proceedings recalled the Peshwa. Before he returned N\u00e1na Purandhare had redeemed his lost credit by attacking and compelling the army of Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r to retire to the Jod-valley about twenty-five miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where they expected to be joined by the Pratinidhi from Karh\u00e1d and by troops from Gujar\u00e1t. In this hope they were disappointed; and as Shankr\u00e1jipant Subhed\u00e1r of the Konkan was assembling troops in their rear and the Peshwa's army which had marched nearly 400 miles in thirteen days was close upon them, Dam\u00e1ji sent a messenger to treat with B\u00e1l\u00e1ji. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji solemnly agreed to abide by the terms proposed and enticed Dam\u00e1ji to encamp in his neighbourhood, where, as soon as he got him into his power, he demanded the payment of all the arrears due from Gujar\u00e1t, and the cession of a large portion of his territory. Dam\u00e1ji represented that he was but the agent of D\u00e1bh\u00e1de the Sen\u00e1pati, and had no authority to comply with what was required. On this reply the Peshwa sent private orders to seize some of the family of the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r and D\u00e1bh\u00e1de who lived at Talegaon in Poona, and treacherously surrounded, attacked, and plundered the camp of Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r and sent him into confinement at Poona. The Peshwa next tried to induce T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i to give up the fort and the\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 274.

Ditto, footnote.\nR\u00e1ja; but she assembled her garrison and required an oath from every man that he would stand by her to the last. Such of them as chose were allowed the option of quitting the fort. Some of the Peshwa's troops became impressed with an idea that she was a dev or good spirit and others that she was a dairya or evil spirit, but the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were so strongly of opinion that T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i was the rightful regent that B\u00e1l\u00e1ji found there was more to be apprehended from proceeding to extremities than from leaving her unmolested; although to become formidable her party required only a leader of reputation. Perplexing as the affair was T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i's conduct in the end proved advantageous to the Peshwa as it took from him the odium of being the first to confine the R\u00e1ja to the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i did not merely confine R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja to the fort. His prison was a damp stone dungeon and his food was of the coarsest grain. Dam\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r was the only man whom the Peshwa dreaded, but as he was now a close prisoner at Poona, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji proceeded towards Aurangabad in prosecution of his engagements with Gh\u00e1zi-ud-din. R\u00e1ja Raghn\u00e1thd\u00e1s the prime minister of Sal\u00e1bat Jang opened a communication from Ahmadnagar with T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i and Sambh\u00e1ji of Kolh\u00e1pur.\n\nDuring B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's absence at Aurangabad T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i occupied the districts of W\u00e1i and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra aided by 5000 or 6000 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and R\u00e1moshis whom she had entertained in her service. A large force was sent to invest S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and starve her into submission. \u00c1nandr\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav, the commandant of the fort, convinced of the folly of resistance, formed the design of carrying the R\u00e1ja out of her power. When this came to her knowledge she ordered him to be beheaded; a sentence which the garrison executed on their own commander, as well as on several others subsequently implicated in a like scheme. B\u00e1bur\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav, a person unconnected with the late commandant and a relation of the J\u00e1dhavs of Sindkhed was appointed to the command of the fort. In 1753 the Peshwa before leaving for the Karn\u00e1tak endeavoured to pave the way to a compromise with T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i. On his march to the Karn\u00e1tak he sent to assure T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i that if she would submit the control of the R\u00e1ja's person and establishment should remain at her disposal. To this T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i would not listen unless B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v would come to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, acknowledge her authority, and give such personal assurances as would satisfy her. Encouraged by the approach to Poona of J\u00e1noji Bhonsle the son and heir of Raghuji Bhonsle, and on assurances of safety and protection from the Peshwa, T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, leaving the garrison of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the custody of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja's person to B\u00e1bur\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav repaired to the Peshwa's capital accompanied by Bimb\u00e1ji Bhonsle the youngest brother of J\u00e1noji who had attached himself to her party and married one of her relations of the Mohite family. At Poona T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i was received with so much attention and consideration that she agreed to the Peshwa's proposals as formerly made, provided he would promise to accompany her to the temple of Jejuri and there solemnly swear to abide by his present declarations. The Peshwa acquiesced on\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 274-275.  \n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 281.\ncondition that B\u00e1bur\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav should be dismissed to which T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i reluctantly agreed. Taking advantage of her obstinate temper, he gained his end of keeping the R\u00e1ja a prisoner by pretending a great desire to see him released. R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja was a prince deficient in ordinary ability, and the miserable thraldom he underwent during a long confinement broke his spirit and ruined his health.\\(^1\\)\n\nBefore Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s death (1749) little improvement had taken place in the civil administration of the country. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1740-1761) appointed fixed m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs or subhed\u00e1rs each of whom had charge of several districts. The territory between the God\u00e1vari and the Krishna including the greater part of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the best protected and most productive under Mar\u00e1tha rule, was entrusted to the Peshwa\u2019s favourites and courtiers some of whom were his relations. They held absolute charge of the police, the revenue, and the civil and criminal judicature, and in most cases had power of life and death. They were bound to furnish regular accounts, but they always evaded settlement. They governed by deputies and remained at court whether in the capital or in the field in attendance upon the Peshwa. Their districts were in consequence extremely ill managed and in very great disorder; the supplies furnished for the exigencies of the state were tardy, and in comparison with the established revenues insignificant. The beginning of a better system is ascribed to R\u00e1mchandra B\u00e1ba Shenvi and after his death Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v Bh\u00e1u improved on his suggestions. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Peshwa was sensible of the advantage to be gained from bringing the collectors under control. He had not sufficient energy for the undertaking himself, but he supported his cousin\u2019s measures. Panch\u00e1yats the ordinary tribunals of civil justice began to improve, because the supreme power if it did not always examine and uphold their decrees, at least did not interfere to prevent the decisions of the community. Most of the principal Br\u00e1hman families of the Deccan date their rise from the time of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. In short the condition of the whole population was in his time improved and the Mar\u00e1tha peasantry sensible of the comparative comfort which they then enjoyed have ever since blessed the days of N\u00e1na Saheb Peshwa.\n\nIn 1760 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s sustained the crushing defeat of P\u00e1nipat, and Peshwa B\u00e1l\u00e1ji who never recovered from that terrible blow died in 1761. In the end of September 1761, M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v the second son of the Peshwa B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, then in his seventeenth year, went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra accompanied by his uncle Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v and received investiture as Peshwa from the nominal R\u00e1ja, who remained in precisely the same state of imprisonment under the obdurate T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, until her death in the following December at the age of eighty-six. To the last moment she maintained her inveterate hatred against B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v, declaring that she died contented having lived to hear of their misfortunes in the battle of P\u00e1nipat and their death. The R\u00e1ja\u2019s condition was\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 285.\nafterwards so far improved that he was brought from the fort and suffered to live a prisoner at large in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. At a later period, M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v allowed him to appoint agents for the management of his p\u00e1t\u00edl dues in several villages and the collection of his other hereditary claims as deshmukh of Ind\u00e1pur.\n\nIn 1762, Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v, who had assumed chief control over the young Peshwa, displaced Shriniv\u00e1s Gang\u00e1dhar, more commonly known by his original name Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v, who had succeeded his uncle Jagjivan Pratinidhi, and raised his infant son Bh\u00e1skarr\u00e1v to the dignity of Pratinidhi and appointed N\u00e1ro Shankar R\u00e1ja Bah\u00e1dur to the office of mut\u00e1l\u00edk, which was in effect conferring the office of Pratinidhi upon him. In 1763, when this and other acts of Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v had made him unpopular, R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1pvant Vithal Sundar a Yajurvedi Br\u00e1hman the Div\u00e1n of Niz\u00e1m Ali, persuaded his master that he had now an opportunity of completely reducing the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and that his best policy was to overthrow the power of the Konkani Br\u00e1hmans, to depose R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja as unfit to govern, and to appoint J\u00e1noji Bhonsle regent. To this scheme J\u00e1noji readily agreed, but Niz\u00e1m Ali, whose duplicity rendered him true to no plan, while his minister was negotiating, secretly renewed a correspondence with the R\u00e1ja of Kolhapur by which he intended to have an eventual competitor in reserve in case J\u00e1noji's claims should prove inconvenient. Everything seemed to promise success. Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v the dispossessed Pratinidhi and many of the Peshwa's officers joined the Moghals and hostilities were renewed. In the war which followed J\u00e1noji deserted and the Moghals being defeated entered into a treaty with Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v, who was much aided by the young Peshwa. Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v was restored to the rank of Pratinidhi upon the death of Bh\u00e1skarr\u00e1v which happened about the same time. Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v after regaining his power from Raghnathr\u00e1v seized every interval of leisure to improve the civil government of his country. In this laudable object he had to contend with violent prejudices and with general corruption; but the beneficial effects of the reforms he introduced are now universally acknowledged, and his sincere desire to protect his subjects by the equal administration of justice reflects the highest honour on his reign. His endeavours were aided by the celebrated R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1stri Parbhone a native of the village of M\u00e1buli near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. By 1772 the supremacy and gradual usurpation of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja's authority also superseded that of the other Pradh\u00e1ns as well as of the Pratinidhi. Forms of respect instituted with their rank were maintained, but they were only of importance in the state according to the strength and resources of their hereditary j\u00e1girs and of a superior description of soldiery, who, on pay much inferior to what they might elsewhere have obtained, adhered to some of them, with that pride in their chief, which caught the fancies of men in all countries and dignified military vassalage.

Next year (1773) the commandant of R\u00e9ygad in Kol\u00e1ba who was in rebellion against the Peshwa, on being required to surrender replied that he held the fort for the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and would maintain it against the Peshwa until the R\u00e1ja was released. On this an order was caused to be written from R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja to the commandant who then surrendered the fort to the Peshwa.\u00b9 On the murder of N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v in the same year, Amritr\u00e1v the adopted son of Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v attended by Baj\u00e1ba Purandhare was despatched to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra for the robes of office for Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v which were accordingly given.\u00b2 In the troubles which followed, the ministers who had sided with Gang\u00e1b\u00e1i the widow of N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v were on the point of releasing the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as a measure calculated to insure them the aid of many of the Mar\u00e1tha soldiery who were discontented or neutral. But the retreat of Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v caused them to abandon the design. In April 1774 as a son and heir was born to Gang\u00e1b\u00e1i, Sakh\u00e1ram B\u00e1pu and N\u00e1na Fadnavis were deputed by Gang\u00e1b\u00e1i to receive the robes of office for her son which were sent from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by the R\u00e1ja in charge of M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Nilkant Purandhare.\n\n\u00b3 In the reign of M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Ball\u00e1l (1761-1772) T\u00e1sgaon and its neighbourhood were taken from Kolh\u00e1pur and added to the Peshwa\u2019s territory as j\u00e1girs of the Patvardhans. In 1777 they were temporarily recovered for Kolh\u00e1pur but Mah\u00e1dji Sindia succeeded in preventing their permanent loss. At the close of this year (1777) R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja died at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra having previously adopted a son of Trimbakji R\u00e1ja Bhonsle a p\u00e1t\u00edl of the village of V\u00e1vi a descendant of Vithoji the brother of M\u00e1l\u00f3ji the grandfather of the great Shiv\u00e1ji. Trimbakji R\u00e1ja commanded a body of 200 horse with which his son served as a shiled\u00e1r when chosen as heir to a throne and tenant of a prison. He was styled Sh\u00e1hu Mah\u00e1rsj.\u2074 At the same time Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v Pratinidhi died and was succeeded by his son Parashur\u00e1m. In 1788 Baj\u00e1ba Purandhare was confined in Vand\u00e1n by N\u00e1na Fadnavis as one of Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v\u2019s chief adherents. In 1790 Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u was occupied near T\u00e1sgaon raising levies for the Mar\u00e1tha contingent to the army engaged in the first English campaign against Tipu.

W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\n\u2074 During the time of B\u00e1lki B\u00e1jir\u00e1v it had been artfully contrived that there were only a few families old, but of no power with whom the R\u00e1ja of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s could intermarry. Until a long time afterwards the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra would have thought himself degraded by a marriage with the daughter of Nimb\u00e1lkar and J\u00e1dhav although from them Shiv\u00e1ji was descended from the maternal line. This artifice, which may have been managed by bribing the Up\u00e1dhy\u00e1s and Sh\u00e1stris, explains the reason why it was scarcely known that Sh\u00e1hu was married in Aurangzeb\u2019s camp to a daughter of Sindia of Kannairkhed.

They seem to have remained in this neighbourhood some three weeks.\n\nIn 1792 the phantom R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra gave the formality of his permission to the Peshwa to assume the dignity of Vakil-ul-Mutlak bestowed on him by the no less phantom Moghal emperor of Delhi.\n\nThe R\u00e1sti\u00e1s of W\u00e1i seem at this time to have exercised great influence in the court of the Peshwa at Poona where they sided with the Br\u00e1hman ministerial party against the encroachments of Mah\u00e1dji Sindia. In September 1795 Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u, after taking part in the battle of Kharda and the subsequent arrangements, returned to T\u00e1sgaon. Throughout this year, owing to the dread that Mah\u00e1dji Sindia intended to make the R\u00e1ja an instrument for suppressing the Peshwa\u2019s and Br\u00e1hmanical ascendancy, N\u00e1na Fadnav\u00eds almost entirely confined the R\u00e1ja to the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, where not even his relations were allowed to visit him. Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u was also summoned in haste from T\u00e1sgaon to Poona to cope with the difficulties which had arisen over the succession to the suicide Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v. N\u00e1na\u2019s proposal that B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Raghn\u00e1th should succeed occasioned a rupture with Sindia. On the advance of Sindia\u2019s army N\u00e1na Fadnav\u00eds repaired in alarm to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with some idea of restoring the R\u00e1ja to supremacy. But, owing to his recent treatment of him, Sh\u00e1hu had no confidence in N\u00e1na and N\u00e1na retired to W\u00e1i. From W\u00e1i he returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to receive the robes of investiture for Chimn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa the Peshwa set up by Sindia\u2019s general B\u00e1loba T\u00e1tia as a rival to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Raghn\u00e1th, but suspecting designs against him on the part of B\u00e1loba, N\u00e1na remained at W\u00e1i. Chimn\u00e1ji was installed in May and a pretence made at a reconciliation between N\u00e1na and B\u00e1loba. But Haripant the bringer of the message crossed the Nira on his way to W\u00e1i at the head of four or five thousand horse. N\u00e1na took alarm and fled to the Konkan throwing a strong garrison into Prat\u00e1pgad. N\u00e1na\u2019s intrigues were successful in gaining Sindia to his cause, but his partisans in Sindia\u2019s camp betrayed the conspiracy from want of caution and part of them had to take refuge in the hills south of the Nira. The troops met at W\u00e1i and shortly afterwards ten thousand men were gathered in the Sahy\u00e1dis and declared for B\u00e1jir\u00e1v. In October the army was joined by the regular battalions in the Peshwa\u2019s service under Mr. Boyd. B\u00e1loba T\u00e1tia was aided by Sindia and the army marched for Poona with N\u00e1na at its head in B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s interest. The Patvardhan estates near T\u00e1sgaon were attacked by the Kolh\u00e1pur R\u00e1ja at N\u00e1na\u2019s instigation and Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u was made prisoner. Owing to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s treachery this triumph was short-lived and, in 1797, N\u00e1na was confined in Ahmadnagar. The R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra at the same time seized the fort and confined N\u00e1na\u2019s agent. But to the Peshwa\u2019s disgust, when Shivr\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Thatte came to receive charge, the R\u00e1ja, instigated by Sindia refused to give up the fort. M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v R\u00e1stia was sent against the R\u00e1ja but had to retire to M\u00e1legaon. Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u, who was then confined at W\u00e1i was released on promise of quelling the disturbance. He soon assembled a considerable force and\nadvanced to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the height of the rains crossing the Vena by an unknown ford. The R\u00e1ja had only a small force which was overcome after a slight struggle in the suburbs. The R\u00e1ja, who had thrown himself into the fort, surrendered for want of provisions. His brother Chitursing escaped to Kolh\u00e1pur closely pursued by a body of R\u00e1stia\u2019s troops joined by others of the Pratinidhi which encamped near the V\u00e1rna for more than a year. In 1798 they were cut off almost to a man by four hundred horse reinforced from Kolh\u00e1pur. Chitursing next made a raid as far as P\u00e1l and took all the guns and dispersed the whole of a force of over 2000 men collected by R\u00e1stia. He again retreated to the V\u00e1rna and kept 7000 men continually on the move throughout the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territories. The Kolh\u00e1pur forces also attacked and pillaged T\u00e1sgaon the capital of Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u\u2019s j\u00e1gir. Parashur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u was shortly afterwards defeated and mortally wounded in the battle with the Kolh\u00e1pur troops. This only served to concentrate all the forces of the state in the effort to reduce Kolh\u00e1pur which was only saved by distractions at the Peshwa\u2019s court in Poona. The southern part of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra must have formed the principal base of these operations which included the investment of the town of Kolh\u00e1pur by the armies of the Peshwa.\n\nIn 1802, after B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s flight from Yashvantr\u00e1v Holkar, Sh\u00e1hu of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was reluctantly induced by the persuasion of Chitursing to invest Vin\u00e1yakr\u00e1v the nephew of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v as Peshwa. In 1803 when General Wellesley advanced on Poona he was joined by the Patvardhans and P\u00e1tankars among other jagird\u00e1rs of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory.\n\nAfter the war of 1803 the territories of the Peshwa suffered considerably from plundering insurgents and freebooters. The distress was also aggravated by a famine in the Deccan through deficiency of rain which destroyed vast numbers of men and horses, but by the end of 1804 British supremacy had restored order. This year the country of the Patvardhans about T\u00e1sgaon was in a state of considerable disturbance which was not quelled till an arrangement was effected in the interests of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v by Khander\u00e1v R\u00e1stia. In 1805 the district was the scene of ravages by Fattehsing M\u00e1ne a general of Holkar\u2019s with an army of 10,000 men. He was defeated by Balvantr\u00e1v Fadnav\u00eds Mut\u00e1l\u00edk of Kar\u00e1d an ancestor of the Sard\u00e1r N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v Anant Mut\u00e1l\u00edk, aided by Chint\u00e1manr\u00e1v Patvardhan.\n\nThe young Pratinidhi, Parashur\u00e1m Shriniv\u00e1s, was at this time at Karh\u00e1d, under the restraint of his mut\u00e1l\u00edk or deputy whose doings were supported by the mother of the Pratinidhi and connived at by the Peshwa. In 1806 a quarrel ensued, and B\u00e1pu Gokhle the Peshwa\u2019s general was sent with troops to enforce submission, while the Pratinidhi was confined in the mud fort of Masur. Next year the Pratinidhi was rescued by T\u00e1i Telin his mistress the wife of an oil-seller. In 1807 this woman gained possession of the fort of V\u00e1sota in the extreme west of J\u00e1rvi and from it descended on Masur and rescued the Pratinidhi. The Pratinidhi declared for the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and against the Peshwa. Many of the people of the district rose with him but his excesses and inability disgusted\nthem. B\u00e1pu Gokhle again went against him; and a slight engagement ensued near Vasantgad. The Pratinidhi was severely wounded and carried to Poona; and his estates sequestrated. His mistress still held out and B\u00e1pu Gokhle had to take the hill forts one by one advancing by the Koyna valley. He met with no difficulty except at V\u00e1sota which held out under T\u00e1i Telin for eight months. In this year (1810) Sh\u00e1hn the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra died and was succeeded by his son Prat\u00e1psinh. B\u00e1pu Gokhle was allowed by the Peshwa to take all the benefit of these conquests. He levied heavy exactions over the whole district and seized all the Pratinidhi\u2019s jewels and private property. In 1811 the Peshwa demanded back his territory, which, with that usurped by the Patvardhans and R\u00e1sti\u00e1s, was brought under his control by British influence, while R\u00e1stia\u2019s estate was finally sequestrated by him in 1815. The same year Trimbakji Denglia was sent into confinement at Vasantgad for instigating the murder of Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri the Baroda minister, and was then delivered to the custody of the British Government. He afterwards escaped and infested among other places the Mah\u00e1dev hills supported by the M\u00e1ngs and R\u00e1moshis.\n\nIn 1812 the Peshwa had seized Chitursing the younger brother of the late R\u00e1ja. On pretence of rescuing Chitursing a Gos\u00e1vi of the same name took up arms and in 1816 obtained possession of Prachitgad by stratagem. He also took many of the forts, and with the ostensible purpose of setting up the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja, plundered the district without mercy. Next year (1817) occurred the pretended insurrection which was the beginning of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s open hostility to the British Government.\n\nTrimbakji Denglia\u2019s Insurrection, 1817.\n\nTrimbakji Denglia on being given up to the British Government was confined in Th\u00e1na. He escaped and retired to the hills near Shingn\u00e1pur in east S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Early in January 1817 he was at Phaltan, and constantly changing his residence between that place and Pandharpur, extended his range as far as the Mahimangad and T\u00e1thvad forts. On the 29th January he had 500 men near Berad in Phaltan and N\u00e1teputa in M\u00e1lsiras, 300 near Shingn\u00e1pur, 600 near Mahimangad, and 400 near Phaltan, a total of 1800 men almost all foot and the bulk of them M\u00e1ngs and R\u00e1moshis. Up to the 18th of February cavalry and infantry continued to join them near Shingn\u00e1pur while the 18th of March was fixed for the outbreak. Trimbakji\u2019s head-quarters were at Berad in Phaltan, where he used to sleep in the forest guarded by five hundred R\u00e1moshis. In spite of the large number of troops who were collected, the Peshwa denied the existence of any insurrection or gathering of armed men, and though he sent B\u00e1pu Gokhle into the district with troops they professed to hear no news of insurgents. On the 7th of March after the serious messages addressed to the Peshwa by Mr. Elphinstone the troops were partly dispersed. In April the operations of Colonel Smith drove the insurgents from their haunts in Shingn\u00e1pur, and when Colonel Smith left for Poona, a detachment under Major MacDonald prevented their remaining in M\u00e1n or the Jath state. In May P\u00e1ndugad was taken by the so-called rebels. But Mr. Elphinstone suspected collusion on the...\npart of the Peshwa's officers for the purpose of eventually delivering the forts to Trimbakji. The Peshwa made the rising a pretext for gaining Mr. Elphinstone's acquiescence to his taking the forts while his forces assembled near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Peshwa's plan was thought to be to retire to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with his brother, with whom he had effected a reconciliation, and thence to V\u00e1sota or to Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r in the Karn\u00e1tak with a force of 10,000 horse and foot under N\u00e1ropant \u00c1pte. He relied on a successful resort to the old Mar\u00e1tha style of warfare as well as on the improbability, as he believed, of the English proceeding to extremities. In May followed the treaty of Poona and subsequently General Smith's troops were drawn to the North Deccan in operations against the Pendh\u00e1ris. Soon after the Peshwa had an interview with Sir John Malcolm at M\u00e1lhuli at which Sir John misled by the Peshwa's professions advised him to recruit his army. All this time the Peshwa was actively engaged in his schemes against the British Government, and while at M\u00e1lhuli appointed Gokhle leader of all his measures, investing him with full powers of government by a formal writing under his own seal confirmed with an oath. He did this not only in pursuance of his own policy, but also as security to the chiefs who were afraid to stand by him on account of his insincerity and vacillation. To aid his preparations B\u00e1zir\u00e1v gave Gokhle as much as a million sterling, and he made the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra privy to his designs against the English, but from fear of his not co-operating sent him and his family to V\u00e1sota a remote hill fort on the edge of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. The recruiting and arming of forts rapidly proceeded, the Peshwa returned to Poona, and his power was destroyed on the 5th of November in the battle of Kirkee. General Smith arrived at Kirkee on the 13th and took Poona on the 17th. The Peshwa fled towards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. After securing Poona General Smith followed on the 22nd. On the 26th he reached the S\u00e1lpi pass, halted there on the 27th, and on the 28th ascended the pass without opposition. On the top he was attacked by six hundred horse with a few rockets. But the advance soon drove them back with loss. They gathered strength as they retired, and towards the close of the march showed three to five thousand on the front and as many more in the rear. Gallopper guns, that is light field pieces, were opened in the evening with great effect. The second battalion of the 9th Regiment under Major Thacker had the rear guard and masked a gallopper gun under a division of auxiliaries which the enemy were preparing to charge. It opened with grape and did great execution. Throughout the day the enemy lost about one hundred and twenty men while General Smith had only one havild\u00e1r and a sepoy slightly wounded. The next day the enemy was very shy, but in the evening showed about five thousand horse out of range. Taking advantage of a rise in the ground the guns were pushed on within range. They opened with great effect upon the enemy who were ready formed and inflicted a loss of many men and horses. The only difficulties were that the enemy would not fight and that there was a want of cavalry to keep them at a distance, while the grain supplies for the followers ran short, and owing to the close order which had to be kept on the marches which began at two or three in the morning, the camps\ncould not be reached till two or three in the afternoon. General Smith was now close on the Peshwa who till then had remained at M\u0101huli. From M\u0101huli B\u0101jir\u0101v fled to Pandharpur. He had sent for the R\u0101ja of S\u00e1t\u0101ra from V\u00e1sota but had to start before he arrived. It was not till the middle of December that he was joined by the R\u0101ja and four thousand horse under N\u0101ropant \u0100pte which had escorted the R\u0101ja from V\u00e1sota. The Peshwa after going as far north as Junnar again turned south and the R\u0101ja was with the Peshwa at the famous battle of Koregaon on the Bhima river. On the 5th of January 1818 the Peshwa was fleeing towards S\u00e1t\u0101ra and General Pritzler taking up the pursuit marched direct upon M\u0101huli by the S\u0101lp\u012b pass. He caught a body of the enemy on the 8th of January close to S\u00e1t\u0101ra and killed and wounded sixty men, and took thirty horses and six prisoners. On the 12th General Smith was near Phaltan and was moving south-east towards Shingn\u0101pur where he intended to cross the M\u0101n near Marde opposite Mhasvad. Thus he and General Pritzler pursued the Peshwa in hopes of intercepting him if he again turned north. General Smith was just outside the eastern boundary of the district while General Pritzler went by the usual route to T\u0101sgaon. On the 17th of January about ten thousand horse of Gokhle\u2019s army in two divisions attempted a reconnaissance of General Pritzler\u2019s camp. The cavalry under Major Doveton charged them three times and put them to flight, their loss being forty killed and wounded. The day after part of Pritzler\u2019s army was placed under General Smith while Pritzler still moved down the right bank of the Krishna. About the same time the Peshwa turned north and passing Pritzler to the west reached Karh\u0101d on the 23rd. On the 23rd General Smith who had turned northwards after the Peshwa reached Kavta two miles south of T\u0101sgaon. About half-way on the march his rear guard was closely pressed by the whole of the enemy\u2019s light division not less than fifteen thousand strong and commanded by \u00c1ppa Des\u0101i, Trimbakji Denglia, the Vinchurkar, several of the Patvardhans, and Gokhle himself. The ground being confined and intersected by water-courses they took ground and moved out to drive off the enemy. The latter kept their ground firmly for some time behaving with much more spirit than usual. Five six-pounders and a howitzer were kept firing on them for some time and their losses were considerable. Meanwhile the Peshwa had succeeded in passing General Pritzler and his force in the west and on the 23rd was at Karh\u0101d. By the 27th General Smith\u2019s division had reached Puses\u0101vli while the Peshwa was six miles from M\u0101huli. The enemy under Gokhle five thousand strong contented themselves with harassing the troops on the march. General Smith was only six miles from M\u0101huli by sunset the next day. The Peshwa had arrived at noon. He left at one in the morning of the 29th and did not stop till he reached Hanbad six miles from the Nira bridge. Here his advance guard fell in with a force under Captain Boles. He instantly moved on and at 8 p.m. reached Phaltan leaving many tired men and camels at Hanbad. He only stayed two hours at Phaltan and marched again in the direction of Puses\u0101vli. He halted about sixteen miles further on. He had marched about\neighty miles in forty hours and in consequence had got separated from his baggage. He afterwards turned south-east and on the 30th reached N\u00e1teputa. Smith started in pursuit of the Peshwa on the 29th. The light division of Gokhle's force attempted to pass him by the short route by Koregaon in order to join the Peshwa but he managed to intercept them and they had to take a more circuitous route further west, as General Smith neared the Salpi pass. Part of them made another push at a point where the valley is some five or six miles wide, probably not far from Deur. General Smith had just pitched his camp. The enemy was advancing along the opposite side of the valley. The 2nd Cavalry and the Horse Artillery supported by the Grenadiers of the 65th Regiment and part of the Light Infantry were immediately ordered under arms and proceeded with the intention of cutting off this body as they passed between them and the hills. Seeing this the enemy kept close under the hills and upon the advance of the cavalry and horse artillery at a gallop fled in the greatest consternation to avoid the charge. Their rear was driven back by the road by which they were advancing, while the main body pushed on at speed for some miles. A few with part of the baggage which had preceded the horse took refuge in the hills and numbers crawled up to the top by a path which from below appeared almost perpendicular. The grenadiers and part of the Light Battalion went up and took part of what remained, killing such of the armed men as offered resistance. The rest under Gokhle moved by the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass and was joined next day by a body of troops from the eastward below the pass. After waiting at Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 Gokhle again retired above the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass. On the 30th General Smith joined Colonel Boles with his reserve at Lonand. He had marched five hundred and seventy miles in forty days with only three halts. General Pritzler returned by the same route after having been driven as far as Galgala in Bij\u00e1pur, and had marched three hundred miles in eighteen days and altogether twenty-three days without a halt. It was determined to effect a meeting. With this object General Smith again moved south on the 4th of February and reached Rahimatpur on the 6th. Here General Pritzler joined him from the south and on the 8th the united force went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the fort surrendered on the 10th. The British colours were hoisted, but only to be replaced by the Bh\u00e1gva Jhenda or ancient standard of Shiv\u00e1ji.\n\nOn this occasion Mr. Elphinstone who, since the battle of Kirkee had been the chief political officer in the Deccan, published the following manifesto: That in 1796 from the time when B\u00e1jir\u00e1v ascended the throne, his country had been a prey to faction and rebellion and there was no efficient government to protect the people. That in 1802 when B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was driven from Poona he took refuge at Bassein, and entering into an alliance with the British Government, early in 1803 was restored to his full authority and the supremacy of the British in the Deccan ensured peace. In 1803 when B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was restored the country was wasted by war and famine, the people were reduced to misery, and the government drew scarcely any revenue from its lands. From that time, through British protection, in spite of the farming system and the exactions of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's\n\nChapter VII.\nHistory.\nMar\u00e1th\u00e1s,\n1720-1848.\nPursuit of the Peshwa,\n1813.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra surrendered to the British,\n10th Feb., 1813.\n\nMr. Elphinstone's Manifesto.\nofficers, the country had completely recovered, and B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had accumulated those treasures which he was now employing against his benefactors. The British Government not only kept peace within the Peshwa\u2019s possessions but maintained his rights against his enemies abroad. It could not, without injury to the rights of others, restore his authority over the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs, which had expired long before its alliance with him, but it paid the greatest attention to satisfy his admissible demands and in spite of many difficulties succeeded in adjusting some and putting others in a train of settlement. Among these were B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s claims on the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r. The British Government had prevailed on the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r to send his prime minister to settle B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s demands, and they were on the eve of adjustment with great profit to the Peshwa, when Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r\u2019s agent was murdered by Trimbakji Denglia, the Peshwa\u2019s minister, while in actual attendance on his court and during the solemn pilgrimage of Pandharpur. Strong suspicions rested on B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, who was accused by the voice of the whole country, but the British Government unwilling to credit such a charge against a prince and an ally contented itself with demanding the punishment of Trimbakji. This was refused until the British Government had marched an army to support its demands. Yet it made no claim on the Peshwa for its expenses and inflicted no punishment for his protection of a murderer; it simply required the surrender of the criminal, and on B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s compliance it restored him to the undiminished enjoyment of all the benefits of the alliance. Notwithstanding this generosity B\u00e1jir\u00e1v immediately began a new system of intrigues and used every exertion to turn all the power of India against the British Government. At length he gave the signal for disturbances by fomenting an insurrection in his own dominions, and prepared to support the insurgents by open force. The British Government had no remedy but to arm in turn. Its troops entered B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s territories at all points and surrounded him in his capital before any of those with whom he had intrigued had time to stir. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s life was in the hands of the British Government, but that Government, moved by B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s professions of gratitude for past favours and of entire dependence on its moderation, once more resolved to continue him on his throne, after imposing such terms on him as might secure it from his future perfidy. The principal of these terms was a commutation of the contingent which the Peshwa was bound to furnish for money equal to the pay of a similar body of troops. When this was agreed to the British Government restored B\u00e1jir\u00e1v to its friendship and proceeded to settle the Pendh\u00e1ris who had so long been the pest of the peaceable inhabitants of India and of none more than of the Peshwa\u2019s subjects. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v affected to enter with zeal into an enterprise so worthy of a great government. He assembled a large army on pretence of cordially aiding in the contest, but, in the midst of his professions, he spared neither pains nor money to engage the powers of Hindust\u00e1n to combine against the British. No sooner had the British troops marched towards the haunts of the Pendh\u00e1ris, than he seized the opportunity to begin war without a declaration and without even\nan alleged ground of complaint. He attacked and burnt the house of the British Resident, contrary to the laws of nations and the practice of India, plundered and seized peaceable travellers, and put two British officers to an ignominious death. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v himself found the last transaction too barbarous to avow; but, as the perpetrators were still unpunished and kept their command in his army, the guilt remained with him. After the beginning of the war, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v threw off the mask regarding the murder of Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri and avowed his participation in the crime by uniting his cause with that of the murderer. That by these acts of perfidy and violence, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v had compelled the British Government to drive him from power and to conquer his dominions. For this purpose a force had gone in pursuit of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v which would allow him no rest, a second was employed in taking his forts, a third had arrived by way of Ahmadnagar, and the greatest force of all was entering Kh\u00e1ndesh under the personal command of His Excellency Sir Thomas Hislop. A force under General Munro was reducing the Karn\u00e1tak and a force from Bombay was taking the forts in the Konkan and occupying that country. In a short time no trace of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v would remain. The R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, who had always been a prisoner in B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s hands, would be released and placed at the head of an independent state of such an extent as might maintain the R\u00e1ja and his family in comfort and dignity. With this view the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra had been taken, the R\u00e1ja\u2019s flag had been set up in it, and his former ministers had been called into employment. Whatever country was assigned to the R\u00e1ja would be administered by him and he would be bound to establish justice and order. The rest of the country would be held by the Honourable Company. The revenue would be collected for the Government, but all real and personal property would be secured. All vatan and in\u00e1m or hereditary lands, varsh\u00e1sans or yearly stipends, and all religious and charitable establishments would be protected, and all religious sects tolerated and their customs maintained as far as was just and reasonable. The revenue-farming system was abolished. Officers should be forthwith appointed to collect a regular and moderate revenue on the part of the British Government, to administer justice, and to encourage the cultivators of the soil. They would be authorized to allow remissions in consideration of the circumstances of the times. All persons were forbidden paying revenue to B\u00e1jir\u00e1v or his adherents or aiding them in any way. No reduction would be made from the revenue on account of such payments. Vatand\u00e1rs and other holders of land were required to quit his standard and return to their villages within two months. The Jamind\u00e1rs would report the names of those who remained and all who failed to appear in that time would forfeit their lands and would be pursued without remission until they were crushed. All whether belonging to the enemy or otherwise, who might attempt to lay waste the country or to plunder the roads would be put to death whenever they were found.\n\n1R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh was established in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and Captain Grant Duff the author of the History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, was placed with him to\n\nChapter VII.\nHistory.\nMar\u00e1th\u00e1s,\n1720-1848.\nMr. Elphinstone\u2019s Manifesto,\n\nPrat\u00e1psinh Restored,\nMarch 1818.\n\n1 Blacker\u2019s Mar\u00e1tha War, 256.\naid his councils and direct his conduct. The family who, without in any way aiding or proving useful to the British, had been raised from hereditary confinement to power, included, besides Prat\u00e1psinh who was in the prime of life, two brothers Chaturising and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji and their mother. Prat\u00e1psinh was described as dull and unschooled with little knowledge of the world and apparently with no knowledge of Mar\u00e1tha history. His mother, who was more ambitious, made large claims stating that she expected that the family would be re-established on the footing it enjoyed in its time of greatest fortune.\n\nOn the 29th of March 1818 after a twodays' halt part of the reserve marched from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and on the 30th camped at some distance on the high road towards V\u00e1sota which had been Prat\u00e1psinh's prison and where some of his family were still confined. V\u00e1sota stands on one of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills about 3000 feet high on the Konkan side and about 2000 feet above the Deccan plain. Like most Mar\u00e1tha hill-forts it was commanded from neighbouring hills. Its greatest strength lay in its height and in the difficulty of approach. In almost every direction it was surrounded by inaccessible mountains, except a few passes so narrow and rugged as to be easily defended, and extremely difficult though in no way strengthened by art. On the 31st, under Colonel Hewett's command, a detachment of six companies of the European flank battalion, two companies of Rifles, and flank companies of the\n\n---\n\n1 On the 29th of March 1818, Mr. Elphinstone rode with the R\u00e1ja through the lower part of the valley of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Groves of mango trees, clumps of cocca-palms so uncommon above the Sahy\u00e1dris, here and there fine tamarind or pimpal trees throwing their deep shade over a temple by the Krishna, and the picturesque hills that surrounded the whole made this the finest part of the Peshwa's country, if not of India. The R\u00e1ja went into S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with the pomp of a prince and the delight of a schoolboy. Colebrooke's Elphinstone, II. 30.\n\n2 Blacker's Mar\u00e1tha War, 295-298. The force assembled for this service included two corps of Europeans, the flank battalion of the Bombay European regiment, half a battalion of European Rifles, four battalions of Native Infantry of the line, that is the 2nd battalion of the 12th Madras, the 2nd battalion of the 7th, and the 2nd battalion of the 9th Bombay, and an auxiliary battalion from Poona. To this force was attached 700 Poona Auxiliary Horse and four companies of Pioneers. The ordnance included twenty-nine pieces, of which four were iron eighteen-pounders and two were iron twelve-pounders. There were one ten-inch and four eight-inch mortars, two heavy five and a half inch howitzers, and two brass twelve-pounders. The rest were field guns and light howitzers. Colonel Dalrymple of the Madras establishment commanded the artillery of which there were 270 Europeans and 317 Natives of both Presidencies. Captain Nutt of the Bombay establishment was chief engineer.\n\n3 From the camp near Sudoli, twelve miles from V\u00e1sota, Mr. Elphinstone wrote (3rd April): The pass is now a good open road to the top. The scenery was less romantic and the fort less alarming than before. The descent was worse than the ascent. Along the bank of the Koyna, where there was a good road, there were occasionally fine views of the water bordered with trees and surrounded by woody hills. The scenery was romantic. Dr. Coats compared it to Malabar and General Pritzler to St. Domingo. The road to V\u00e1sota lay along a valley between high mountains and was quite secluded, as if no one were within a hundred miles. The hill sides had a variety of summits and ravines. In some places were craggy rocks intermingled with trees; in others appeared smooth summits covered with the richest and greenest foliage; in some the forest was on fire and gusts of smoke drawn through the leafless trees; in others the fire was spent and there remained only the blackened ground and scorched trunks. Towards the west of the valley the bottom and sides of the hills were covered with brushwood or with tall pine-like trees, but all the upper part of the mountain was bare rock or withered grass. The whole was closed by V\u00e1sota. Colebrooke's Elphinstone, II. 31-32.\n2nd battalion of the 12th and 7th Bombay Native Infantry, was sent forward to V\u00e1sota about twenty miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In the afternoon Colonel Hewett's detachment reached Induli a small village within two miles and a half of V\u00e1sota, and drove in an outpost of the garrison. Two companies of the Seventh were left in possession of the fort, and the rest of the force returned to T\u00e1mbia, five miles from V\u00e1sota as there was no nearer place fit for encampment. The investment was put off till the first of April, when three outposts were established, one at old V\u00e1sota distant 700 yards and commanding the place, the second at the same distance and commanding the road to the gateway, and the third to the right of it distant no more than 400 yards from the walls. A summons was sent to the commandant, but it was refused admittance. On the first and second all the Pioneers and litter-bearers were engaged in making a road. On the 3rd, the head-quarters of the division were moved forward to T\u00e1mbia, and with the help of elephants the mortars and howitzers were brought across the hills to the same place. Next day a strong working party was employed on the pathway to old V\u00e1sota to complete the work begun on the first, and some light guns and ammunition were got up. The R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh, some of whose family were prisoners in the fort, arrived in the camp, and a detachment of rifles and auxiliary horse was sent into the forests to search for eighteen elephants which their keepers had carried off from P\u00e1ndugad immediately before that place was reduced. On the fifth the battery from old V\u00e1sota opened with good effect and one of the largest buildings in the fort was fired by the bombardment. The garrison returned a few shots from their large guns, but kept up an unremitting fire from their wall-pieces and small arms and were all day busily employed in improving their defences. The bombardment continued on the 6th. As it was found that the arrangements were insufficient to intimidate the commandant the Pioneers were directed to complete the road from the camp for the advance of the battering guns. This proved unnecessary. On the following morning the garrison surrendered unconditionally and a company of Bombay Native Infantry took possession of the fort. The loss of the enemy amounted to seventeen killed and wounded and that of the British force to only four. Among the prisoners set free were two officers Cornets Morison and Hunter, who were restored to freedom after an almost hopeless confinement. They were the first to meet the party advancing to receive possession of the place, among whom were some intimate friends, but so greatly had their past hardships changed them that they were scarcely recognized. The members of Prat\u00e1psinh's family were also set free and accompanied the chief to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Much importance was attached to the fall of V\u00e1sota which was one of the Peshwa's treasure-houses and one of his strongest forts. The 7th was spent in the removal of the mortars and guns from the batteries back to the park and in preparing to re-cross the mountains. The passage was effected during the two following days and on the 10th the force returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra having reduced the fortress of Parli by detaching a party of infantry under a native officer to whom it surrendered. The detachment of rifles and\nauxiliary horse, which had been sent off a few days before rejoined with the elephants they had gone in search of, after a long and most fatiguing march among the hills. With the usual ceremonies, which the general and the leading officers attended, the Commissioner formally seated Prat\u00e1psinh on the masnad or pillow of state.\n\nOn the 11th of May a halt was called during which visits of ceremony were exchanged with the R\u00e1ja, and on the 12th the force began its return southward by the valley of the upper Krishna to reduce more forts during its progress to join Brigadier-General Munro from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. On the 13th of May the encampment was at Masur, which, as well as the hill fortress of Vasantgad, surrendered in the course of the day. On arriving at Karh\u00e1d on the 14th the garrison of Kole and Sad\u00e1shivgad abandoned those places. At Kopargaon, on the following day, the submissions of Machhindragad, Battis Shir\u00e1la, Isl\u00e1mpur, V\u00e1nghi, and V\u00e1lva, were received. Garrisons were established in all these as well as in other places. From V\u00e1lva the force marched without halt by Isl\u00e1mpur, Ashte, and Siredvar, to Nagar Manoli, General Munro's head-quarters which were reached on the 22nd. Dategad, Makrangad, Prat\u00e1pgad, Bhairavgad, and Jangli J\u00e1rgad, also surrendered. The rapid fall of so many places bore out the truth of the well-known saying that forts quickly fall when there is no army to keep the field. The garrisons seemed to want only a pretence for surrendering.\n\nStrong military forces were stationed at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Karh\u00e1d. Shortly after a conspiracy was discovered for the release of Chitursing, the murder of all Europeans at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Poona, the surprise of some of the principal forts, and the possession of the R\u00e1ja's person. The plot was suppressed and several of the conspirators executed. On the 25th of September 1819 a treaty was concluded under which Prat\u00e1psinh agreed to hold his territory in subordinate co-operation with the British Government. He was neither to increase nor to diminish his military force without its sanction, and as a fundamental condition he was positively forbidden to hold any intercourse with persons not his subjects except through the Resident at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The British Government charged itself with the defence of his territory which was to be managed by a British Agent till the R\u00e1ja had acquainted himself with the business of government.\u00b9 Their lands were restored to the great J\u00e1gi\u00e9d\u00e1rs and in most cases at their own request they were placed under the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. By the treaty of 1819 R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh was formally installed as ruler of a territory which included the whole of the present district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra except the sub-division of T\u00e1sgaon which then formed part of the Patvardhan estates. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief held in addition what are now the sub-divisions of S\u00e1ngola, M\u00e1lsiras, and Pandharpur in Shol\u00e1pur, and part of the Bij\u00e1pur district in the neighbourhood of and including the city of Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nCaptain Grant Duff found Prat\u00e1psinh naturally intelligent and well disposed, but surrounded by profligate men bred among intrigues and ignorant of every thing except court etiquette.\u00b2 All went well so long as Captain Duff remained in sole charge. In\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 682. \u00b2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 678.\n1822 Prat\u00e1psinh was freed from tutelage, and a fresh treaty was concluded in which especial stress was laid on the articles regarding foreign intercourse. For a time things went well. In 1829 Sir John Malcolm admired the condition of the country, the chief's devotion to business, and his promotion of useful works. The chief made a road to Mah\u00e1baleshvar and part of that to Poona by the S\u00e1lpi pass. He also provided funds for the dam and lake at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, and at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra he made the water works by which the town is supplied from springs in the neighbouring hills of Yavteshvar. He built some large public offices and a fine palace and pleasure gardens and arranged that his territory should be surveyed by Captain Adams.\n\nIn 1825 Bishop Heber wrote that the chief was a well disposed young man of good understanding. His country was peaceable, orderly, and as prosperous as could be expected after the famine. He was so ardent a professed lover of peace as almost to bring his sincerity in question.\u00b9 In November 1826 Mr. Elphinstone wrote: He is the most civilized M\u00e1r\u00e1tha I ever met, has his country in excellent order, and everything to his roads and aqueducts in a style that would credit a European. I was more struck with his private sitting room than anything I saw at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It contains a single table covered with green velvet at which the descendant of Shiv\u00e1ji sits in a chair and writes letters as well as a journal of his transactions with his own hand.\u00b2 All this time stirred on by those around him and imbued with an exaggerated idea of his importance Prat\u00e1psinh became impatient of control. General Briggs who succeeded Captain Grant Duff found Prat\u00e1psinh impracticable and retired. Colonel Robertson the next Resident never interfered, and Colonel Lodwick seldom, and when he did with little effect. B\u00e1l\u00e1jipant N\u00e1tu in November 1835 informed Colonel Lodwick that Prat\u00e1psinh was in the habit of talking of the probable fall of the British Government and making other treasonable remarks. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji had also heard rumours of a plot among the chiefs which he thought that Prat\u00e1psinh might be induced to join. Colonel Lodwick regarded these accusations as the result of intrigue and did not report them to Government. According to General Lodwick the R\u00e1ja's feelings were embittered by delay in settling the question of his rights to the lapsed estates of the great J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, and that he was further annoyed by the Governor's refusal to visit him at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. He sent an agent to the Court of Directors, and, contrary to the terms of the 1822 treaty, without the Resident's knowledge. He communicated direct with various Europeans and natives in Bombay. His disloyalty and bad faith went further. His minister Govindr\u00e1v was employed to interview Shaikh Gul\u00e1msing and Gulj\u00e1r Missar two Subhed\u00e1rs of the 23rd Regiment then at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and tempt them from their allegiance. On the 21st of July 1836 one Ant\u00e1jipant took the Subhed\u00e1rs to the minister's house, and they were shown to Prat\u00e1psinh who secretly recognised them. Ten days later Ant\u00e1ji told them that the R\u00e1ja called them to a\n\n\u00b9 Journal, II, 212. \u00b2 Colebrooke's Elphinstone, II. 187-188.\nprivate interview. During August matters went no further. On the 8th of September the Subhed\u00e1rs were summoned in disguise to the R\u00e1ja who told them that the signal for rising was to be disturbances in Bombay and Belgaum, the arrival at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra of an army from Haidarabad, and at the Narbada of an army from Hindust\u00e1n. On the 18th of September Ant\u00e1ji met the Subhed\u00e1rs for the last time and had a long and treasonable conversation with them. Next day Ant\u00e1ji was enticed into the lines and arrested, and when Prat\u00e1psinh was told of the accusations against him the minister was given up. On the 10th of October 1836 a commission consisting of Colonel Ovans, Mr. Willoughby, and the Resident Colonel Lodwick met to inquire into the extent of the conspiracy and of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s connection with it. The Commission fully believed the Subhed\u00e1rs\u2019 statements. They were satisfied that Prat\u00e1psinh secretly recognized the Subhed\u00e1rs and afterwards held private and treasonable conversations with them. That Prat\u00e1psinh was party to a conspiracy was proved beyond doubt. As to the extent of the conspiracy, it appeared that during the interview hints were thrown out of aid from Sindia and of a Moghal emissary. Some attempt also was made to show that Prat\u00e1psinh had been in communication with Mud\u00e1ji Bhonsle the ex-R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1gpur, and that he even thought of corresponding with Russia. The commission rejected the evidence of so widespread a plot as untrustworthy, and held that, though there could be no doubt of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s hostile feelings to the British Government, he had no defined or intelligible plan of action. Much of his disloyal conduct was due to exaggerated notions of his consequence and to the designs of evil men by whom he was surrounded. Of the minister Govindr\u00e1v\u2019s and the Br\u00e1hman Ant\u00e1ji\u2019s guilt there could be no doubt. Both were imprisoned, the minister at Ahmadnagar.\n\nNext year (1837), through his mother Girj\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed, the minister made disclosures which proved that, contrary to the belief of the Commission, Prat\u00e1psinh had communicated both with the Viceroy of Goa and with \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb the ex-R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1gpur. The Goa intrigues had begun as far back as 1826-27 when a certain N\u00e1g\u00f3 Devr\u00e1v was sent to Goa to conduct communications with the Portuguese Viceroy Dom Manoel. In that year a draft treaty was prepared at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Negotiations were continued till 1828-29, and an agent named Erculano Dettora was sent to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to ascertain whether Prat\u00e1psinh acknowledged N\u00e1g\u00f3 Devr\u00e1v as his agent. He returned with presents and satisfactory assurances from Prat\u00e1psinh. The object of the intrigues with Goa was to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance with Portugal against the British Government. The principal conditions of the alliance proposed by Prat\u00e1psinh were: That Portugal was to furnish an army for the recovery of the territories which formerly belonged to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; that Prat\u00e1psinh was to bear the cost of the army, and that when the conquest was completed the Portuguese were to be rewarded in money and territory and a portion of their army was to be subsidised at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The evidence shows that Prat\u00e1psinh hoped to gain possession of the whole territories which had been under the last Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and additional conquests in Southern India. The\nidea was also entertained of uniting France, Russia, and Austria in the alliance against the English. No doubt remained that Prat\u00e1psinh, and probably the agents on his side, believed that their scheme was feasible, and that the Portuguese Viceroy and his agents, besides their feeling of hostility to the English, encouraged and continued the plot for the sake of Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s large disbursements. The last act of this intrigue was a mission of M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Shirke on the departure of Dom Manoel in 1835-36. The whole was disclosed by voluntary information after the seizure of the minister Govindr\u00e1v in the Subhed\u00e1rs\u2019 case. The third intrigue was with \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb ex-R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1gpur. Though he was destitute and under restraint in Jodhpur, the proposal was that \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb should raise \u00a3200,000 (Rs. 20 lalhs) to enable the Portuguese to replace him in power. At S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the intention to link this with the Goa conspiracy was evident, but no direct communications between Goa and Jodhpur were proved.\n\nOne \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb Mah\u00e1d\u00edk of T\u00e1rle took a sword of the Bhonsles to \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb at Jodhpur and brought back a mare and letters. The exchange of letters lasted over about eight years, and the correspondence ceased only with the seizure of the minister Govindr\u00e1v at which time a messenger of \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb was found hid at a village near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In addition undoubtedly genuine letters were discovered from Prat\u00e1psinh to the native soldiery urging them to rise. Though both the Government of India and the Court of Directors held the evidence of Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s guilt complete a long interval of much intrigue both in India and in England passed before Prat\u00e1psinh was called for a final explanation of his conduct. In a vague and unsatisfactory reply, Prat\u00e1psinh made no real attempt to meet the charges which had been brought against him. Sir James Carnac Governor of Bombay (1839-1841) more than once asked him to bind himself strictly and in good faith to act up to the articles of 1819. Prat\u00e1psinh refused to promise even this. To agree, he said, would lower him to the position of a m\u00e1latd\u00e1r. It was felt that the chief had shown such ingratitude and ill-feeling towards the British Government, and that he was so full of absurd ambitions and pretensions that it would be misplaced clemency to overlook his treason and his want of contrition. On the 5th of September 1839 Prat\u00e1psinh was deposed. Lord Auckland the Governor General, proposed that the Company should resume the state. But the Court of Directors decided to give it into the hands of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s younger brother Sh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed as the other brother, the gallant Chitursing, had died in 1821. The R\u00e1ja was sent to Benares and died there in 1847. The chief commander B\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1heb, who was as deeply involved in the intrigues as his master, was also sent to Benares and died on the journey.\n\nIn spite of the clearness and completeness of the evidence against Prat\u00e1psinh every effort was made to discredit the discoveries of the Resident Colonel Ovans. The principal informants, even Colonel Ovans himself, were accused before the Court of Directors of taking bribes to trump up a case against Prat\u00e1psinh, and the chief papers were said to be forgeries. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed the successor to the chiefship hated his brother Prat\u00e1psinh, and Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s advocates declared that many\n\nChapter VII\nHistory.\nMAR\u00c1TH\u00c1S,\n1720-1848.\n\nPrat\u00e1psinh Deposed,\n5th Sept., 1839.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed,\n1839-1848.\nof the accusations brought against their client were due to Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s malice and ambition. Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s case was taken up by a pensioner of the Bombay Government named Mylne, several proprietors of East India Stock, and General Lodwick the former Resident of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The cry reached Parliament. But the explanations of Colonel Ovans and his colleagues in the Commission of 1836 were entirely satisfactory. Nothing came of the agitation except three years\u2019 delay between Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s conviction and his punishment.\n\nTill the end Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s management of the state was excellent. His strength and practical sense as a governor deepen the disgrace of his political crimes. His schemes, however unlikely to succeed, were neither the blind follies of an ignorant tool nor the empty aspirations of a visionary.\n\nAfter his succession to power Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s excellent character and loyalty to the British Government strongly contrasted with Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s family and political crimes. Under a treaty dated the 4th of September 1839 all the provisions of the treaty of 1819 not expressly repealed were confirmed. The chief change was that the great estate-holders or j\u00e1yird\u00e1rs were placed under the direct control of the British Government instead of under the chief of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji built and supported a civil hospital and schools and was liberal in expenditure on roads, bridges, and other public works which were executed out of the balance found in Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s treasury and by savings in the military establishment. He abolished transit duties and introduced the Company\u2019s rupee. The rite of sati or widow-burning had become very common under Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s administration, and in spite of the Resident\u2019s remonstrances, British subjects had been allowed to come to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to perform the rite. On his accession Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji of his own accord abolished sati by proclamation and at a later period interfered to prevent a woman burning herself. During the K\u00e1b\u00fal war (1841-42) Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji offered his troops, and during the 1845 insurrection in Kolh\u00e1pur and S\u00e1vantv\u00e1di he kept his territories in order, sent a detachment of his troops to act against the rebels, and did valuable service by forwarding supplies and keeping open communications. His expenditure on public works including those above named amounted to nearly \u00a3110,000 (Rs.11 l\u00e1khs). Of this, nearly \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2 l\u00e1khs) were for improving the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra water works and another \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2 l\u00e1khs) for two fine bridges across the rivers Vena and Krishna on the Poona road by the S\u00e1lpi pass. He also finished the magnificent court room and buildings known as the New Palace and now used as the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra court of justice. In March 1848, in the midst of his plans of usefulness, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was attacked with serious illness. He for some time had taken under his protection a boy of obscure birth on whom he had conferred the name of Balvantr\u00e1v Bhonsle and the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1dnya. On the 1st of April as his sickness increased Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji sent for the Resident Mr., the late Sir Bartle, Frere, and more than once engaged in long conversations with him regarding the succession. He expressed the wish to make so extravagant a provision for R\u00e1j\u00e1dnya that Mr. Frere formed the idea that he was anxious to adopt him as his son. Mr. Frere remarked that so low-born a child was unsuitable to succeed him, and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji stated that\nhe intended to choose from any branch of the Bhonsle family except those of Kolhapur, as they had married into the less pure family of the Sindias and of V\u00e1vi. Because his brother Prat\u00e1psinh had adopted a boy from their family, he expressed a strong unwillingness to recognise Prat\u00e1psinh's adopted son. He hinted that if he was suddenly overtaken by death he would adopt and trust to the generosity of Government to recognize the adoption. On the 5th of April the Resident left for Mah\u00e1baleshwar. He was brought back by a note telling him that the R\u00e1ja despaired of life and had declared his purpose of adopting a son. The adoption took place in the presence of Dr. Murray the Civil Surgeon of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The lad who was named Venk\u00e1ji, was of the house of Shedgaon which traces its origin to Sherifji the uncle of the great Shiv\u00e1ji. The R\u00e1ja made Dr. Murray write in English, as he spoke in Mar\u00e1thi, a memorandum of his adoption of Venk\u00e1ji whom he named Venk\u00e1ji R\u00e1je after Shiv\u00e1ji's younger brother. There can be no doubt that all through these proceedings Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was anxious to defer to the British Government in every possible way, and that nothing but the near approach of death led him to make an adoption without their sanction.\n\nMr. Frere arrived at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra at ten in the evening. He went straight to the palace and explained to the R\u00e1nis and assembled chieftains that the decision of the Supreme Government must be awaited as to the course of succession; that till then he could not recognise the adoption; and that the government of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory would be conducted by the same agency as before under the Resident's control. All expressed their confidence in and willingness to defer to the wishes of the Supreme Government. On the 12th of April 1848 the Resident wrote to Government, 'No act is so trifling but it has been interpreted in various ways, favourable or unfavourable to the continuance of the state, according to the hopes or fears of the party. Government will not be surprised at this when it is considered that the bread of almost every one in the city depends more or less on this decision. Besides the holders of land and other grants who may feel more or less secure according to the tenure on which they hold, at least 10,000 persons are supported directly by salaries from the court, and most of these have probably many dependents. Few of the people of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, even of those whom the change would not directly affect, would be indifferent to the passing away of Shiv\u00e1ji's dynasty.'\n\nIntrigue was at once opened with Prat\u00e1psinh's family at Benares. Reports were circulated and letters written stating that the late R\u00e1ja had asked the Resident to send for Prat\u00e1psinh's adopted son, that, though this was not the case, Prat\u00e1psinh's choice was nearer by blood to the R\u00e1ja's line than Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji's choice, that B\u00e1b\u00e1jipant forced Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji to adopt Venk\u00e1ji, and that Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was insensible when the adoption took place. The presence of Dr. Murray and the precautions taken by the R\u00e1ja and the Resident in specifying the R\u00e1ja's intentions gave the lie to these reports. The British Government had to decide what was to be done with S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Their decision turned on three leading points: (1) Was Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji's adoption valid without recognition\nby the British Government; (2) If it was not valid was the Bombay Government bound in justice or expediency to recognise it; and (3) What were the claims of Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s adopted son and the members of the house of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji. The opinion was generally accepted that as regarded private estates the adoption was valid without the recognition of Government. Whether the adoption was valid as regarded the political powers conferred by the treaty of 1819 was a point on which opinions differed. All members of the Government both of Bombay and India held that the sanction of the paramount power was required to render an adoption to a principality valid. But Sir George Clerke Governor of Bombay (1847-1848) held that in the case of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the right of sanction could not without injustice be exercised to the extent of forbidding adoption. The other members of the Bombay Government and all the members of the Government of India were of opinion that to confer or to withhold the sanction was at the option of the British Government as the paramount power, and that the only question was one of expediency. On financial, military, and political grounds it was decided that it was expedient to withhold the sanction of Government to the adoption. All agreed that the country would benefit by the annexation of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and that the condition of the Deccan no longer made it necessary to maintain native states like S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as a safety valve for characters who would be discontented under direct British rule.\n\nIt was held that no other members of the family of Shiv\u00e1ji had any claim to the succession. The treaty of 1819 was with Prat\u00e1psinh and his heirs and successors. All his ancestry were passed by, no right was confirmed to them. The other branches of the family could have no pretension to the territorial rights which were created in favour of Prat\u00e1psinh. The arrangement of 1839 especially admitted Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s brother Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji to that settlement, and the adopted son of the last recognised possessor of the throne must have a better right than the adopted son of the deposed chief or of any other claimant. When the discussion was shifted to England certain advocates argued that political powers conferred on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra state differed from the tenure of all those persons to whom the right of adoption to territorial possessions had been refused, and that, as regards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the title of Paramount Power as applied to the British Government was misplaced. That therefore if the adoption were legal according to the usages of the state it was valid independent of British sanction. It was further argued that if British sanction was required it was contrary to the treaty to refuse it; that even if the adoption was invalid for want of sanction or for any other cause, the collaterals had claims under the treaty the terms of which did not necessarily restrict the succession to lineal heirs and that at any rate the claims of collaterals should not be barred without giving them a chance of stating them. The able management of the state by both R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and the loyalty of the second R\u00e1ja, were urged as reasons for showing consideration to Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s wishes. A well governed state it was argued was a source of strength to the British empire. Only five members of the Court of Directors dissented from the annexation of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\nEarly in May the Resident received a letter dated the 1st of May 1849, stating that it had been resolved that from failure of heirs the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory had lapsed to the power which had bestowed it. On the 6th of June following Mr. Frere reported to Government that the notification of the annexation had been received loyally but despondently by the subjects and servants of the late R\u00e1ja. The senior R\u00e1ni protested strongly but showed no active opposition to the decision of Government.\n\nEvery thing went quietly till May 1850 when the decision of Government as to the provision to be made for the family of the late R\u00e1ja was communicated to the R\u00e1nis. They rejected the terms offered, and stipulated for the continuance of the household of the late R\u00e1ja in their service, and intrigued in the hopes of gaining indirectly what they failed to procure by direct means. Finally they withdrew their demands and their affairs were settled in December 1851. Their lands and allowances and the private property left by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, valued at upwards of \u00a3150,000 (Rs. 15 lakhs) were restored and distributed among them in proportions fixed by Government, and separate apartments in the palace were assigned to each of the R\u00e1nis and to their adopted son Venk\u00e1ji R\u00e1j\u00e9. Besides a large amount of jewels, furniture, and equipages, the R\u00e1nis gave to Venk\u00e1ji the whole of their hereditary lands and villages yielding a net yearly revenue of over \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) and added to it portions of their own allowances which raised his income to more than \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000) a year. The parties interested were satisfied and all excitement was allayed. Every individual belonging to the household of the late R\u00e1ja, not retained in the service of their Highnesses: the R\u00e1nis or of Balvantr\u00e1v Bhonsle, the boy whom the late R\u00e1ja had taken under his protection, was pensioned, employed, or discharged with a gratuity. Since the settlement of their affairs their Highnesses the R\u00e1nis abstained from giving further trouble to Government. The final arrangement made may be thus summarised. The late R\u00e1ja\u2019s private debts amounting to \u00a323,545 (Rs. 2,35,450) and the expenses attending his visit to Kolh\u00e1pur amounting to a further sum of \u00a35875 (Rs. 58,750) were discharged by advances from the public treasury. A balance of \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) remaining in the hands of the architect of the new palace was assigned for the improvement of the aqueduct built by Sh\u00e1hu R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and a further balance of \u00a33586 (Rs. 35,860), chiefly savings out of the pay to his late Highness\u2019s cavalry, was also devoted after the manner of the late Government to public works. The yearly life allowance of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) settled on the R\u00e1nis was divided among them in the following proportions: \u00a34500 (Rs. 45,000) to the senior R\u00e1ni, \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) to the second R\u00e1ni, and \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) to the third R\u00e1ni. The private movable and immovable property was unreservedly given up by Government to the R\u00e1nis and they were allowed to keep a life possession of the old and new palaces, which with all other public buildings were declared to be the property of Government. Balvantr\u00e1v Bhonsle was allowed to keep property worth about \u00a314,247 (Rs. 1,42,470) that had been given to him, and in deference to the wishes of His late Highness a further monthly\nallowance of \u00a360 (Rs. 600) was settled on him. Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s widow and adopted son were each allowed monthly pensions of \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) and the widow was also granted a sum of \u00a31200 (Rs. 12,000) to meet the expenses of her journey from Benares to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where the Governor General had allowed her to live. She reached S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in 1854. To Gojr\u00e1s\u00e1heb Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s daughter and only child was assigned a monthly pension of \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) with a monthly remainder of \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) to her male heirs. On her leaving Benares for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in October 1848, the Government of India granted Gojr\u00e1s\u00e1heb \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) to meet the expenses of her journey, as well as several months\u2019 arrears amounting to \u00a3900 (Rs. 9000) on account of herself and followers. On the death of this lady, on the 30th of August 1853, Government granted her family the sum of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) to meet the cost of her funeral rites.\n\nFrom 1849 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was directly under the British Government though the Regulations were not introduced till 1863. No signs of discontent appeared till the disordered state of the country during the 1857 mutinies stirred some members of Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s family to seditious intrigue. No outbreak occurred at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra during the mutiny, but evidence was discovered of a widespread conspiracy only a week before the date fixed for the rising. A R\u00e1moshi named N\u00e1na R\u00e1ghu Chavh\u00e1n, who about 1831 had received \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) from Government for the arrest of the great R\u00e1moshi bandit Um\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik, told a dismissed agent of the Pant Sachiv that a conspiracy was on foot in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Pant Sachiv\u2019s agent told Mr. Rose the District Magistrate on the 10th of June 1857. Inquiry showed that armed Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had gathered at Bagarv\u00e1di a village near Bhor, the Pant Sachiv\u2019s capital, that they had started for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and had arranged for R\u00e1moshis and others to follow them. As there was a large R\u00e1moshi population near Bagarv\u00e1di, thirty of the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Irregular Horse were sent under Lieutenant Kerr, accompanied by the First Assistant Commissioner Lieutenant Sandford, to intercept them. The party marched forty-five miles in sixteen hours over difficult rugged ground, but were seen by some of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s who returned from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the greater number of the men escaped to the hills. Thirteen Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were seized, but of the thirteen only one was a man of consequence. All confessed that they had come together for the purpose of attacking the station at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In consequence of this intelligence the magistrate asked for a detachment of European troops from Poona which arrived towards the end of the month. On the day after the intelligence was received from Bhor a Rajput messenger on the establishment of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Judge\u2019s court was arrested in the lines of the 22nd Regiment N. I. at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, endeavouring to corrupt a Subhed\u00e1r and through him all the Hindust\u00e1ni men of the regiment. The magistrate Mr. Rose was empowered to try him by special commission and he was executed on the 20th of June. On the scaffold he harangued the people present telling them that the English had less hold on the country than when they set foot in it, and urging them as the sons of Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns not to remain quiet. A short time before a gang robbery had taken place\nnear Parli behind the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort. It was then reported that this gang formed a detachment from a considerable body of men who had gathered in the neighbouring forests but had dispersed on the return of the troops from Persia. It was now ascertained that Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s agent Rango B\u00e1puji had been living for six weeks in Parli, and that he had gathered this body of men to act with the band assembled in the Bhor country and with armed men hid in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The plot was mainly directed by Rango B\u00e1puji who had visited England as Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s agent. The intention was at the same time to attack S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Yavateshvar, and Mah\u00e1baleshvar, to massacre all Europeans, and to plunder the treasury and the town. Besides circulating news of the rising in Hindust\u00e1n, Rango B\u00e1puji set on foot absurd but widely believed stories: The Governor of Bombay had commissioned Rango to restore Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s family and had ordered him to seize all Europeans who were to be released if they agreed to the arrangement and if they refused to agree were to be massacred. Meetings of conspirators had begun as far back as January 1857. Matters had failed to come to a head merely for want of concert, and the failure of one or other of the number to bring his contingent at the proper moment. At their last meeting the ringleaders had solemnly sworn over the sweetmeats which they ate together never again to fail. At the time the information was received every thing was ripe for an attack. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the organization was incomplete as at the last the conspirators were short of ammunition. In Bhor were large stores of powder, lead, and cannon balls, and in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra 820 bullets were found ready cast in one house. According to the evidence at the trials, after the last meeting 2000 men were ready for the attack and arrangements had been made for opening the jail and for letting out the 300 convicts. The Pant Sachiv was deeply involved in the plot and the other feudatories were believed to be no less guilty, and members of Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s family who were living at the old palace were proved to be closely implicated. One night the horses of Sh\u00e1hu Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s adopted son and of Durg\u00e1sing the Sen\u00e1pati\u2019s adopted son were saddled that the young Raj\u00e1s might head the attack. Ant\u00e1ji R\u00e1je Shirke, known as B\u00e1v\u00e1s\u00e1heb, the native head of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra police, who was then drawing \u00a360 (Rs. 600) a month, was completely corrupted by the elder R\u00e1ni, and had engaged to keep the local police inactive. It also came out that during the previous year B\u00e1v\u00e1s\u00e1heb had been intriguing to bring 40,000 Rohill\u00e1s to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The inquiry further showed that Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s adopted son Venk\u00e1ji Bhonsle had knowledge of the treasonable designs against the British Government. It was uncertain whether he was under the influence of Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s family or of the great estate-holders. The impression formed by Government was that he was trimming between the two parties, fearing that unless he fell in with their designs, if Prat\u00e1psinh\u2019s party succeeded he would be in a worse position than he was under the British Government. Secret levies were being raised in all parts of the district from Bhor to the furthest part of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. V\u00e1lva, on the line of communication with Kolh\u00e1pur, was the seat of much intrigue. Rango B\u00e1puji used to boast that he could bring over a thousand men from Belgaum and that\nKolhapur would also rise. The event proved that as regarded Kolhapur his boast was well founded. Besides this, if the confessions of Pratapsinh\u2019s adopted son are to be believed, encouraged by Holkar and Rango Bapuji, the R\u00e1nis had been plotting ever since their return from Benares in 1854. The province, as it was then called, of S\u00e1tara was ripe for sedition. With one exception the feudatories were without male issue, and in consequence of the non-recognition of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji\u2019s adoption were afraid that at their deaths their estates would be lost to their families. Government had also decided that alienations made by the last two R\u00e1j\u00e1s without the Resident\u2019s consent were to be resumed on the death of present holders. These sources of discontent had much less influence on the people than a feeling which, since their return to S\u00e1tara in 1854, had sprung up in favour of Pratapsinh\u2019s family.\n\nThe first news of the mutinies in Upper India came to S\u00e1tara in a private letter to an obscure Br\u00e1hman. The Br\u00e1hman took the letter to Pratapsinh\u2019s chief R\u00e1ni and prayed for her favour when she came into power. The letter was read publicly in the native library. The receiver was warned to burn it and the matter was kept a close secret. One of the reasons for a rising on which Rango Bapuji dwelt ever since his return from England was England\u2019s embroilment with Russia. This, he said, gave the best possible chance for gathering levies and raising the people against the British power in India. He said that all the discontented people in the Deccan looked to S\u00e1tara, the ancient seat of the Mar\u00e1tha empire, as the place which should first free itself from the British yoke.\n\nSeveral arrests were made in July including the son of Rango Bapuji in Kolhapur territory. Though a reward of \u00a350 (Rs. 500) was offered for his apprehension Rango Bapuji escaped and has never been heard of. The detachment of Europeans reached S\u00e1tara at the end of June and for about a fortnight all remained quiet. On the 13th of July a desperate attack was made on the office and treasury of the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r of Pandharpur, then in S\u00e1tara, with the further object of raising the eastern districts on the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s border. The attempt was made with only a few men and the attack was successfully repelled by the local police with a loss of four killed including the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r of Pandharpur. Two of the six leaders were killed in the attack, the other four were captured and blown from guns at S\u00e1tara with two of their followers. The rest were transported. On the 27th of August a special commission sat for the trial of seventeen persons concerned in the plot, including the son and another relation of Rango Bapuji. These persons were convicted and executed on the 8th of September. On the 6th of August, by order of Government, Sh\u00e1hu, the adopted son and the two R\u00e1nis of Pratapsinh, the adopted son of B\u00e1las\u00e1heb Sen\u00e1pati, and a cousin of Sh\u00e1hu were removed for confinement to Butcher\u2019s Island in Bombay harbour. This measure was urgently necessary in consequence of the uneasy state of the province owing to the rising at Kolhapur on the 31st of July. Guns were taken to and pointed on the palace in the early morning and the family were removed in closed carriages. Heavy roads made the journey tedious, but it was successful. In the same month\nthe disarming of the district was ordered and begun. All the cannon and wall-pieces in possession of the feudatory chiefs were taken, except two small pieces which they were allowed to keep for occasions of festivity and rejoicing. By the end of June 1858 over 32,000 small arms had been discovered, 130 guns and wall-pieces had been destroyed, and over \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000) taken in fines for concealment of arms. No further disturbance occurred. But the insurrection at Kolhapur in December 1857 necessitated the despatch of small parties of troops. Seventy-five were sent to Ashta then the head-quarters of the V\u00e1lva sub-division and twenty-five to Shir\u00e1la a strong mud fort to check any rising on the southern frontier. These troops were kept at these stations till August 1858 when they were sent to T\u00e1sgaon to join 200 men of the 22nd Native Infantry lately sent there from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to overawe the Southern Mar\u00e1tha chiefs and to check the rising which it was thought might follow the annexation of the Patvardhan chiefs\u2019 territories on his decease without male issue. No disturbance took place and the troops returned at the beginning of the fair season. The political prisoners R\u00e1jasb\u00e1i and Gunv\u00e1nt\u00e1b\u00e1i the widows, and Sh\u00e1hu and Durg\u00e1sing the adopted sons of Prat\u00e1psinh and B\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1heb were kept at Butcher\u2019s Island till March 1857. In December 1857 Mr. Rose went to Butcher\u2019s Island and induced the adopted sons and K\u00e1ka S\u00e1heb a relation of Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s to make confession of their part in the intrigues. In March 1858 they were removed to Kar\u00e1chi in Sind and were kept in residences separate from the R\u00e1n\u00eds, who proved incurable intriguers.\n\nSh\u00e1hu, the adopted son of Prat\u00e1psinh, was allowed to return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where he was joined by his wife \u00c1nandib\u00e1i. Venk\u00e1ji, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed\u2019s adopted son, was removed first to Ahmadabad and then to Ahmadnagar in 1859 and 1860. Monthly allowances of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) were granted to Sh\u00e1hu, of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) to Durg\u00e1sing, and of \u00a33 (Rs. 30) to K\u00e1ka S\u00e1heb; to the R\u00e1ni R\u00e1jasb\u00e1i \u00a310 (Rs. 100) and to Gunv\u00e1nt\u00e1b\u00e1i \u00a34 (Rs. 40). Certain old servants of Prat\u00e1psinh were pensioned at a total monthly cost of \u00a373 (Rs. 730) while others were discharged with gratuities amounting to \u00a3153 (Rs. 1530). Yashv\u00e1nt Malh\u00e1r Chitnis, who induced the young R\u00e1ja and Sen\u00e1pati to make their confessions, received \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) and certain palace servants who aided were given small gratuities. The Subhed\u00e1r who resisted the rebels\u2019 overtures was invested with the third class order of merit, and Sad\u00e1shiv Khand\u00e9rav the Bhor K\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri who conveyed the first information was restored to his office, presented with a dress of honour worth \u00a360 (Rs. 600), and given a village worth \u00a350 (Rs. 500) a year. Venk\u00e1ji died in 1864, and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed\u2019s widow adopted another son M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v, who is at present known as Ab\u00e1s\u00e1heb and has a son named Sh\u00edv\u00e1ji. Since 1859 except for one or two gang robberies the peace of the district has remained unbroken.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE LAND.\u00b9\n\nSECTION I.\u2014ACQUISITION, CHANGES, AND STAFF.\n\nThe earliest British possessions in the present (1883) district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were the sixteen villages in the T\u00e1sgaon sub-division, which were obtained on the overthrow of the Peshwa in 1818. Eleven years later (1829) in exchange for other lands three villages of Malcolmpeeth were ceded by the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The rest of the present (1883) S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district lapsed between 1837 and 1848 on the death of the chiefs who had held it.\u00b2\n\nThe district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra came into existence in 1848 on the death of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It was at first called a province not a collectorate or district, and was placed under a Commissioner and distributed over eleven sub-divisions, Bij\u00e1pur, J\u00e1vli, Kar\u00e1d, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Khat\u00e1v, Koregaon, Pandharpur, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1rgaon, V\u00e1lva, and W\u00e1i. In addition to these sub-divisions, at the revision of the district establishment in 1856, twelve mah\u00e1ls or petty divisions were formed.\u00b3 The villages were redistributed over the eleven sub-divisions and the twelve new petty divisions to manage which twelve mah\u00e1lkaris were appointed. Under Government Resolution 2637 of 7th July 1862 the district establishment was again revised and the eleven sub-divisions and the twelve petty divisions were changed into fourteen sub-divisions and two petty divisions.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Besides the Survey Commissioner Colonel W. C. Anderson's memorandum written in 1880 on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Revenue History, materials for the Land History of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra include Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXV. and XCIV., Survey Commissioner's Office Files regarding Revenue Survey Settlements in the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, and Annual Jam\u00e1bandi, Administration, and Season Reports in Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 16 and 20 of 1856, 17 of 1860, 19 of 1861, 90 of 1861, 13 of 1862-1864, 235 of 1862-1864, 75 of 1866, 57 of 1867, 95 of 1871, and statements in Bom. Gov. Res. Rev. Dept. 6092 of 27th Oct. 1875 and in Bom. Pres. Genl. Adm. Reports from 1872-73 to 1882-83.\n\n\u00b2 Four villages in T\u00e1sgaon on the death of the Chinchni chief in 1837, three villages in T\u00e1sgaon on the death of the chief of the fourth share of the Miraj estate in 1842, eight villages in T\u00e1sgaon on the death of the Soni chief in 1846, and nine villages in T\u00e1sgaon on the death of the T\u00e1sgaon chief, and the whole of the rest of the district on the death of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief in 1848. The old S\u00e1t\u00e1ra state is now divided among the Bij\u00e1pur S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Shol\u00e1pur districts. Before 1848, except forty villages in T\u00e1sgaon and three in Malcolmpeeth, the whole of the present S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district was included in the old S\u00e1t\u00e1ra state.\n\n\u00b3 The petty divisions were Pimpaude in Koregaon, Khand\u00e1la in W\u00e1i, B\u00e1mnoi in J\u00e1vli, Kole in Kar\u00e1d, Shir\u00e1la and Peth in V\u00e1lva, Helv\u00e1k in T\u00e1rgaon, M\u00e1yni in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, N\u00e1teputa and Pusegaon in Khat\u00e1v, and S\u00e1ngola and Bh\u00e1lavni in Pandharpur.\n\n\u2074 The sub-divisions were Bij\u00e1pur, J\u00e1vli, Kar\u00e1d, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Khat\u00e1v, Koregaon, M\u00e1l\u015biras, M\u00e1n, Pandharpur, P\u00e1tan, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1rgaon, V\u00e1lva, and W\u00e1i; and the petty divisions were Khand\u00e1la in W\u00e1i and Shir\u00e1la in V\u00e1lva.\n1862-63 Bij\u00e1pur was transferred to Belgaum and from the 1st of August 1863 T\u00e1sgaon was moved from Belgaum to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1864-65 Pandharpur was made over to Shol\u00e1pur. From the 1st of January 1867 the T\u00e1rgaon sub-division was abolished and its eighty-three villages were distributed among the Kar\u00e1d, Koregaon, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and P\u00e1tan sub-divisions. At the same time sixteen villages from Kar\u00e1d were transferred to V\u00e1lva. From the 1st of August 1875 M\u00e1lsiras was moved to Shol\u00e1pur. At present (1884) the district consists of the eleven sub-divisions of J\u00e1vli, Kar\u00e1d, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Khat\u00e1v, Koregaon, M\u00e1n, P\u00e1tan, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1sgaon, V\u00e1lva, and W\u00e1i, and the petty divisions of Khand\u00e1la in W\u00e1i and Shir\u00e1la in V\u00e1lva.\n\nThe revenue administration of the district is entrusted to an officer styled Collector on a yearly pay of \u00a32790 (Rs. 27,900). This officer, who is also Political Agent of the Jath, \u00c1tp\u00e1di, Aundh, Bhor, and Phaltan states, is chief magistrate and executive head of the district. He is helped in his work of general supervision by a staff of four assistants, of whom two are covenanted and two are uncovenanted servants of Government. The sanctioned yearly salaries of the covenanted assistants range from \u00a3840 (Rs. 8400) to \u00a31080 (Rs. 10,800), and those of the uncovenanted assistants from \u00a3360 (Rs. 3600) to \u00a3720 (Rs. 7200). For fiscal and other administrative purposes the lands under the Collector's charge are distributed over eleven sub-divisions or t\u00e1luk\u00e1s. Of these seven are generally entrusted to the covenanted assistants or assistant collectors, and four to one of the uncovenanted assistants or district deputy collector. As a rule no sub-division is kept by the Collector under his own direct supervision. The other uncovenanted assistant or huzur that is head-quarters deputy collector is entrusted with the charge of the treasury. The covenanted and uncovenanted assistants are also magistrates, and those of them who have revenue charge of portions of the district have, under the presidency of the Collector, the chief management of the different administrative bodies, local fund and municipal committees, within the limits of their revenue charges.\u00b9\n\nUnder the supervision of the Collector and his assistants the revenue charge of each of the eleven sub-divisions is placed in the hands of officers styled m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs. These functionaries who are also entrusted with magisterial powers have yearly salaries varying from \u00a3180 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 1800 - 3000). Two of the eleven sub-divisions, V\u00e1lva and W\u00e1i, contain each a petty division or peta mah\u00e1l, Shir\u00e1la in V\u00e1lva and Khand\u00e1la in W\u00e1i, each placed under the charge of an officer styled mah\u00e1lkari, who, except that he has no treasury to superintend, has the same revenue and magisterial powers as a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. The yearly pay of these mah\u00e1lkaris varies from \u00a360 to \u00a372 (Rs. 600 - 720).\n\nIn revenue and police matters the charge of the Government\n\n\u00b9 Mah\u00e1baleshvar is in charge of a Superintendent who is a commissioned medical officer with second class magisterial powers and P\u00e1nchgani is in charge of a Superintendent who is a non-commissioned medical officer with third class magisterial powers.\nvillages is entrusted to 1300 headmen or p\u0101t\u012bls all of whom are hereditary. Of these 331 perform revenue duties only, 241 attend to matters of police only, while 728 are entrusted with both revenue and police charges. The yearly pay of the headmen depends on the revenue drawn from each village. It varies from 12s. to \u00a317 4s. (Rs. 6 - 172) and averages about \u00a33 (Rs. 30). Besides the headmen, in many villages members of their family are in receipt of land grants from Government amounting in all to a yearly sum of \u00a3591 (Rs. 5910). Of \u00a34538 (Rs. 45,380) the total yearly charge on account of the headmen and their families, \u00a3647 (Rs. 6470) are met by grants of land and \u00a33891 (Rs. 38,910) are paid in cash. To keep the village accounts, to draw up statistics, and to help the village headmen, there is a body of 786 accountants or kulkarnis, 785 of them hereditary and one stipendiary or about thirteen accountants to sixteen villages. Each accountant\u2019s charge contains on an average 980 people and yields an average revenue of about \u00a3183 (Rs. 1830). The yearly salaries of the accountants vary from 10s. to \u00a331 (Rs. 5 - 310) and average about \u00a37 8s. (Rs. 74). Of \u00a35827 (Rs. 58,270) the total yearly charge on account of village accountants, \u00a3151 (Rs. 1510) are met by land grants and \u00a35676 (Rs. 56,760) are paid in cash.\n\nUnder the headmen and accountants are the village servants with a total strength of 3174. They are either Musalm\u00e1ns or Hindus. Of the Hindus a few are Jains and Lingayats, and the rest belong to the Mh\u00e1r, M\u00e1ng, R\u00e1moshi, Dhangar, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1r, Koli, and other depressed castes. These men are liable both for revenue and police duties. The total yearly grant for the support of this establishment amounts to \u00a36304 (Rs. 63,040) being \u00a31 19s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 19 as. 13\u00bd) to each man or a cost to each village of \u00a36 11s. 4d. (Rs. 65 as. 10\u00bd). Of this charge \u00a34472 (Rs. 44,720) are met by grants of land and \u00a31832 (Rs. 18,320) are paid in cash.\n\nThe average yearly cost of village establishments may be thus summarised: Headmen and their families \u00a34538 (Rs. 45,380), accountants \u00a35827 (Rs. 58,270), and servants \u00a36304 (Rs. 63,040), making a total of \u00a316,669 (Rs. 1,66,690), equal to a charge of \u00a317 7s. 3d. (Rs. 173\u00bd) a village or about eleven per cent of the district land revenue.\n\nSECTION II.\u2014TENURES.\u00b9\n\nThe Hindu theory of land tenure seems to have been that the state was the owner of the soil, and granted the right to occupy it to such persons as it pleased on various terms. In some land the state made over to individuals either a part or the whole of its interest. These lands are known as alienated lands. Land whether alienated or kept by the state was held on four tenures, hereditary or mir\u00e1s also called sthalkari or thalkari, casual or upri, crown or sheri, and on lease or ist\u00e1va. Hereditary or mir\u00e1s landholders had a private\n\n\u00b9 Contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C. S.\nright of occupancy on condition of paying the government dues. This right they could sell or mortgage; and though the permission of government may at some time have been necessary to the private sale or mortgage of hereditary land, it was not usual to interfere as the state lost nothing by the transfer. The person who bought the mir\u00e1s right became responsible to government for the assessment. Mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs were of two classes, either vatand\u00e1rs or hereditary residents of one bh\u00e1uband or brotherhood whose land their ancestors were supposed to have brought under tillage, or they were husbandmen who had gained hereditary rights by living in the village for one or more generations, holding the same fields, and steadily paying the regular dues. Government passed no title deeds. But, provided it was not already mir\u00e1s, government could bestow land in mir\u00e1s. The buyers of mir\u00e1s land were admitted to all the rights and privileges of the former occupant. The first and most respectable of these two classes of mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs were styled p\u00e1til vatand\u00e1rs, because they generally enjoyed a portion of the in\u00e1m or rent-free land attaching to the p\u00e1tilship with its accompanying m\u00e1np\u00e1n or rights and honours. The other class were termed thalv\u00e1ik or Kunbi vatand\u00e1rs that is hereditary landholders. As far as the mir\u00e1s right in the land extended, p\u00e1til and sthalv\u00e1ik or thalv\u00e1ik vatand\u00e1rs were on an equality. The mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r had many advantages. He could not be ousted from his field so long as he paid his share of the revenue, and he had a voice in all village affairs. He was often freed from the p\u00e1til's that is village headman's dues and house tax; he had a right to graze on the g\u00e1yr\u00e1n or village common, to a share of the village site, and to any houses built on his share of the village site either by himself or by others. A mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r could contract a marriage with families with which other landholders could not become allied. Should the mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r remain in his village and his field become waste, the other mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs were obliged to pay his rent. But when he left the district, as was generally the case when he became insolvent, the other mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs paid nothing unless they chose to take the field and pay the full assessment, a course which was seldom adopted except among relations. When the field was not taken government could let it on lease. But as the government k\u00e1rkun or clerk had not as much influence as the p\u00e1til, he usually leased the land at something less than the full assessment. If a mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r returned and claimed his field, it was restored him at the end of the lease. Usage established the greatest forbearance in regard to mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs. Where revenue was not paid the right of government to declare mir\u00e1s land forfeited was not disputed. Still no mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r would willingly quit his field, and if it would yield a profitable crop such as might make it an object with government to take possession, the mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r's kinsmen would readily take the land and pay its rent, so that there could be no advantage and consequently no forfeiture unless government disposed of the field to another in mir\u00e1s tenure. This last course seems never to have been taken.1 In 1822, except in Bij\u00e1pur, the\n\n---\n\n1 In Lieut. MacLeod's memorandum it is stated that governments were in the habit of selling mir\u00e1s.\nmir\u00e1s tenure was general throughout the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory. About seventy per cent of the landholders were believed to be mird\u00e1sd\u00e1rs and these landholders were careful not to lose their hereditary rights. Except collecting its rent the officers of government exercised no control over mird\u00e1s land. If a mird\u00e1sd\u00e1r refused to till his field he was threatened with being forced to resign all his privileges. All mird\u00e1s land was fully assessed and the assessment was often more than the land could bear. The heavy rates were endured for the sake of the privileges which attached to the tenure. The average sale value of mird\u00e1s lands seems to have been small, as Captain Grant Duff puts it, at five to seven years\u2019 purchase. This is clearly separated in his mind from the sentimental value which would probably have been much larger. He only intended to show how small a margin of profit these lands yielded to the holder. Some authorities have held that mird\u00e1sd\u00e1rs could not sell their land without the consent of the state. This was not Captain Grant Duff\u2019s opinion. \u2018It does not appear,\u2019 he writes, \u2018that any register of such sales was kept. Usage had rendered an application to government unnecessary. Still applications were sometimes made to m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs for a certificate of sale in order to attest the transaction. In this case a nazar or fee was presented. Mird\u00e1s bills of sale are very particular in guarding against claims by any other member of the seller\u2019s family.\u2019\n\nThe upri or casual tenure was originally the tenure by which people held who belonged to other villages. It was a mere tenancy-at-will terminable at the pleasure of the state, either at the end of the current year or of a term of years if a lease had been granted. Land held under the upri tenure was subject to rates specially agreed on, and these rates were generally much lighter than the standard assessment. At the same time some of the casual or upri land was fully assessed and became known as ch\u00e1l\u00ed jamin. Much of this land was taken by tenants who were the hereditary or mir\u00e1s holders of other lands in the same village, while some was tilled by residents of neighbouring villages and some by new settlers. A casual or upri tenant had none of the privileges of an hereditary tenant or mird\u00e1sd\u00e1r. He might build a house in the village, but he could neither sell nor remove it, and the house became the property of the village or of the mird\u00e1sd\u00e1r on whose share of the village site it was built. Casual holders could not bequeath or sell their land, and could be turned out in favour of a better tenant. Apparently upri land might become mir\u00e1s by long enjoyment at the full rate of assessment. The power of granting lands other than mird\u00e1s at reduced rates seems to have rested with the village head. This was his great inducement to spread cultivation and was a source of power and occasionally of oppression.\n\nSheri or crown lands were those immediately under the management of government. They were supposed to have been originally taken to form gardens or fields to be kept for the use of government.\n\n1 The rate thus paid was known as khand makta that is the agreement or contract rate.\nWhen *sher\u012b* lands ceased to be kept for government use, they were rented direct by the *m\u0101mlatd\u0101rs* to the husbandmen and generally at an easier rate than the lands managed by the village authorities. In 1822 except the chief's *kh\u0101s b\u0101g* or private garden all *sher\u012b* or crown lands were placed under the management of the heads of villages and their rent was included in the village assessment. The easy rates were continued and old landholders were kept on the former terms except where fraudulent leases, obtained by the collusion of former *m\u0101mlatd\u0101rs*, were discovered.\n\nThe *ist\u0101va* or rising lease tenure was granted for bringing waste land under tillage. The usual term of lease was five to seven years and the rent steadily rose until the full assessment was reached. The land then became *ch\u0101li* or fully assessed land, and could be held on *upri* or *mir\u0101s* tenure according to circumstances. Under British management various regulations were made for granting *khand makta* that is fixed and *ist\u0101va* or rising leases. All distinctions of tenure were abolished by the survey Act I of 1865, when every holding was declared to be the occupant's transferable and hereditable property. *Sher\u012b* or crown lands are now everywhere fully assessed. The only lands under the direct management of government are grazing, forest, and waste lands, and lands set apart as quarries or for other public purposes.\n\nIn alienating land the state made over to the grantee the state share in the produce of the land. When villages or lands held in *mir\u0101s* were alienated to third parties the *mir\u0101s* rights were in no way disturbed. Land which was not *mir\u0101s* the alienee might dispose of as he pleased, within the same limits as government disposed of unalienated land, and, in theory at least, subject to the fulfilment of existing promises. When one or more villages or portions of villages were alienated, all previous alienations of land within the village recognized by the state remained untouched. Thus the alienation of land wholly at the disposal of government, as casually held land, crown land, and wasteland, carried with it much fuller powers than when the land which formed the subject of the grant was either in the hands of hereditary holders or of earlier alienees. The alienee of a village stood to its land in the same relation the state had stood to the land before the grant. When the state alienated land wholly at its disposal, the alienee had a *mir\u0101s* right to the land either rent-free or on a quit-rent according to the terms of the grant. The holder of a newly granted village had no authority to charge assessment on older alienated land or to deprive hereditary holders of their *mir\u0101s* rights. The alienee of a village frequently gave out land rent-free, and this land he also called alienated land. But these gifts rested on his pleasure, and it is a question how far on a reversion of the village the state would have been bound by such gifts. It may be assumed that all villages were originally government villages, that is the revenue of all at first came into the government treasury. What was the earliest form of alienation does not appear. Apparently in S\u00e1t\u0101ra the earliest alienation documents refer to hereditary offices, and the assignment of rent-free lands to the village establishment. A copperplate grant\nmentioned by Captain Grant Duff shows that the early Mar\u00e1tha dynasties in Panh\u00e1la granted whole villages, though on what terms does not appear. The Mar\u00e1tha chiefs of pre-Musalm\u00e1n times also made grants for charitable and religious institutions. The Musalm\u00e1ns gave j\u00e1girs or alienations of district and village revenues for the support of troops or in reward for personal service. In Mar\u00e1tha times alienations of every kind were multiplied. The greatest number took place during the reign of Sh\u00e1hu (1708-1749), and in most keenly disputed hereditary office cases deeds of that time are still produced. -The early Peshw\u00e1s and the Pratinidhi conferred not a few grants. In later times (1800-1818) Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v adopted the policy of sequestrating grant estates or j\u00e1girs generally on the plea that the services for which they had been granted were not performed. In 1819 the first of the British-invested R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra tried the same policy, generally by refusing to allow estate-holders to adopt. In both cases these attempts led to disaster. They hastened the overthrow of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v by turning the leading chiefs against him and they were one of the chief causes of complaint with the British against the management of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji familiarly known as Appa S\u00e1heb Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j. The Patvardhans and the R\u00e1stia J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs in T\u00e1sgaon and W\u00e1i were the victims of the Peshwa\u2019s rapacity, while the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was particularly harsh towards the houses of Phaltan, Bhor, and the Pratinidhi. At the end of the Peshwa\u2019s supremacy two main classes of alienations were in use in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra: J\u00e1girs or service grants and in\u00e1ms or perpetual gifts. J\u00e1girs were lands alienated in return either for personal called j\u00e1t or military called saran-j\u00e1m service. In theory these grants were continued only so long as service was required; in practice many of the grants became hereditary. At the same time the word j\u00e1gir was very loosely used and beyond question some hereditary grants were called j\u00e1girs. Such were the grants to the great S\u00e1t\u00e1ra estate-holders or j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, the Pant S\u00e1chiv of Bhor, the Nimb\u00e1lkar of Phaltan, the Pratinidhi of Aundh and \u00c1tp\u00e1di, and the Daphle of Jath. All of these the British Government continued as hereditary grants. The only estate-holder of Musalm\u00e1n origin in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was the Shaikh Mia of W\u00e1i who held the village of Pasarni as a military grant or saran-j\u00e1m.\n\nInd\u00e1ms were gifts in perpetuity either granted by Hindu and Muhammadan governments or by village authorities. In the case of village grants possession was acquired by bhogavta or prescription, the assent of the state being implied by continued acquiescence. Government ind\u00e1ms were generally unattested by deed, the most respected bearing the ruler\u2019s autograph. Village ind\u00e1ms were granted either in reward for services or by special favour. They were often wrung out of the village authorities by Br\u00e1hmans in office. Captain Grant Duff (1822) was satisfied that scrutiny would show that many of the village grants were false and were held by fraudulent collusion with village officers. Captain Grant Duff arranged state and village grants or in\u00e1ms under six classes: Hindu, Musalm\u00e1n, devasth\u00e1n or religious, dharm\u00e1d\u00e1y or charitable, dengis or miscellaneous gifts, and vatans or village staff grants. Hindu in\u00e1ms were of six varieties: to Br\u00e1hmans, to Gos\u00e1vis or religious beggars, to Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for war\nservices, to Bh\u00e1ts or reciters, to Jangams or Ling\u00e9yat priests, and to Fair Flags, as each village used to send a flag to the great fairs or religious gatherings. Musalm\u00e1n perpetual grants or in\u00e1m\u00e1s, all of which were included under the head of charity or khair\u00e1t, were of eight varieties, to Musalm\u00e1ns, to Musalm\u00e1n beggars, to tumblers or Domb\u00e1ris, to bull showmen or Gop\u00e1ls, to bear-men or Darveshis, to eunuchs or Hujres, to picture showmen or Chitrakathis, and to reciters or Dh\u00e1ras. Devasth\u00e1n or religious grants were both Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n. The Hindu religious grants were of three varieties; (1) Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 devasth\u00e1ns made either by rulers or village officers, including grants to famous temples for lights or dips, for food or naivedya, for worship or puja on great festival days or uchch\u00e1vs; (2) g\u00e1on devta to meet the expense of village shrines; and (3) saunsth\u00e1ns, grants to religious teachers made by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs, by the Peshw\u00e1s, and by village officers, the most interesting of which were to Bh\u00e1ngavr\u00e1m B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s teacher and to R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s teacher. Musalm\u00e1n religious grants were of three kinds mosque lands, tomb or darga lands, and prayer-place or idga lands. Dharm\u00e1d\u00e1y or charity lands were held almost entirely by Br\u00e1hmans. Dengis or gifts were miscellaneous grants usually by village officers to m\u00e1ntriks or sorcerers and magicians, devrishis or spirit controllers, bahur\u00fapis or mimes, ghadsh\u00ed vajantris or pipers, shing\u00e1dis or crooked horn-blowers, tut\u00e1rv\u00e1l\u00e1s or long trumpet blowers, pakhv\u00e1jv\u00e1l\u00e1s or drummers, kalvantis or dancing girls, chit\u00e1ris or painters, at\u00e1rs or perfumers, raktu\u00e1ns or ink-makers, patvekars or silk workers, chobd\u00e1rs or macebearers, son\u00e1rs or goldsmiths, shimpis or tailors, sut\u00e1rs or carpenters, gaundis or bricklayers, bhois or fishermen and litter-bearers, vaidy\u00e1s or physicians, k\u00e1s\u00e1rs or bangle makers, p\u00e1nad\u00eds or water-finders, m\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs or beggars, v\u00edrs or heroes who had died in defence of the village, and b\u00e1lp\u00e1rveshi and m\u00e1nparveshi for the children and widows of village martyrs. Vatand\u00e1r grants were for village officers and village establishments.\n\nThe holders of alienated villages are Br\u00e1hmans, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, V\u00e1nis, Jangams, Gos\u00e1vis, Prabhus, Mh\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns.\u00b9 The proprietor as a rule does not live in his village. Many estates are divided into shares and some are enjoyed in turn by the descendants of the original holder. In many cases the estates or shares are mortgaged to creditors and in a few cases they have been sold.\u00b2 There is no notable difference either in the condition of the people or in the character of the tillage in alienated and neighbouring Government villages. As a rule the alienated villages are the\n\n\u00b9 The Collector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, 6263 of 17th October 1883. Of the seventy-two alienated villages in M\u00e1n, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, T\u00e1sgaon, and Khat\u00e1v, Br\u00e1hmans hold fifty, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s fourteen, Gos\u00e1vis two, Prabhus one, Mh\u00e1rs one, Musalm\u00e1ns one, Gujars one, Jangams one, and one is held jointly by a Br\u00e1hman and a Ling\u00e9yat. In Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, and F\u00e1tan also the chief holders are Br\u00e1hmans and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; of these five are Sard\u00e1rs, and the rest are traders, begging Br\u00e1hmans, and husbandmen.\n\n\u00b2 Of the five villages in M\u00e1n, one is in the management of a moneylender or s\u00e1vk\u00e1r; of the twenty-two villages in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, seventeen have been mortgaged, and of the thirteen in T\u00e1sgaon, five. Of the thirty-two villages in Khat\u00e1v, some have been sold and the names of the purchasers have been entered in the Government books and nineteen are in the hands of moneylenders or s\u00e1vk\u00e1rs.\nchoicest villages of the neighbourhood and so are better able to bear without suffering the heavier rates which they have to pay. Alienated villages have two leading classes of tenants, mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs or hereditary tenants and gatkulis or casual tenants. Yearly tenants are also found under mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs and in the proprietor\u2019s private holding. All, except perhaps the under-tenants, pay a fixed rent. In unsurveyed villages the proprietors sometimes attempt to raise the rent especially when the tenancy is for a year or other limited period. But all tenants have a right to hold their lands so long as they do not fail to pay their rents, and can be ousted only in due course of law. The payments are nearly always in cash, though grain rents are paid in a good many P\u00e1tan villages. The ordinary rates in surveyed alienated villages do not differ from those in Government villages; in unsurveyed villages they are generally higher. Proprietors seldom do anything to aid their tenants to improve the land. If the tenancy is for a limited period, they sometimes help the tenant in digging wells or in carrying out improvements. No advances or tag\u00e1n are granted to tenants. If a tenant improves his holding he usually reaps the full benefit of his improvements. The proprietor as a rule will ask no more rent than the former rent. Most alienated villages have waste g\u00e1yr\u00e1n or grazing land for the landholders to graze their cattle on free of charge. In some cases this waste land is set apart as kuran or grass land and the right of grazing is sold yearly or given by contract. The right to cut timber depends on the terms of the proprietor\u2019s sanads or title deeds. Landholders can usually cut trees on their fields, except the kinds set apart as Government trees. The help given to proprietors to recover rents is regulated by sections 86 and 87 of the Land Revenue Code. On application a summary inquiry is made, and if the proprietor appears entitled to help an order is passed to help him. The tenant is given a week, a fortnight, or a month to pay. At the end of the term of grace, under the Collector\u2019s order, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r enforces the usual compulsory process. The proprietor of a surveyed village is aided to recover his dues up to the survey rates. In unsurveyed villages help is given up to what seems fair in each village. When such cases arise average actual collections during the previous five years are generally considered fair.\n\n1 In Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, and P\u00e1tan the ordinary dry-crop acre rate in unsurveyed alienated villages is about 10s. (Rs. 5) and the garden acre rate 14s. (Rs. 7). M\u00e1n has three of its five villages surveyed, and in the other two the drycrop acre rates vary from 2s. to 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 1 - 1\u00bd as.); the revenue is however levied by the proprietors at three-fourths of the full assessment and consequently the actual burden of revenue on the landholders is not much in excess of what falls on Government landholders in neighbouring villages. In the four unsurveyed villages in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur the dry crop acre rates vary from 3s. 10\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 5\u00bd as.), and the acre rates on watered land from 9s. 9d. to 4s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 4\u00bd - 2\u00bd as.); the corresponding rates in the neighbouring Government villages are for dry crop land from 3s. 4\u00bdd. to 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 2 as.) and for watered land 9s. to 5s. (Rs. 4\u00bd - 2\u00bd). In the six unsurveyed villages in T\u00e1sgaon the highest acre rates are for dry crop land 10s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 5\u00bd) and for watered land 17s. 6d. (Rs. 8\u00bd), and the corresponding rates in the neighbouring Government villages are 5s. 6d. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and 13s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 6 as. 12\u00bd). In the eighteen unsurveyed villages in Khat\u00e1v, the acre rates vary for dry-crop land from 6s. to 2s. (Rs. 3 - 1) and for watered land from \u00a31 2s. to 10s. (Rs. 11 - 5); the corresponding rates in the neighbouring Government villages are for dry-crop land 4s. to 3d. (Rs. 2 - as. 2) and for watered land 10s. to 5s. 6d. (Rs. 5 - 2\u00bd).\nSECTION III.\u2014HISTORY.\n\nThe first land measurement and appraisement of which record remains was under the Bij\u00e1pur government, probably during the last years of the 16th century. The accounts were kept in pagod\u00e1s. In some villages the Bij\u00e1pur standard of assessment was continued to the end of the Peshwa's rule (1817), but the accounts are imperfect and no estimates of the rates are available. When Shiv\u00e1ji took the country (1655) he made a new but imperfect measurement. His system was the same as that of Malik Ambar in the North Deccan (1605-1626), who fixed two-fifths of the produce or its equivalent in money as the government share. Shiv\u00e1ji kept his accounts in pagod\u00e1s. The Moghals in the time of Aurangzeb (1686-1707) introduced the system of Todar Mal, which was a permanent assessment of one-third of the average produce or its equivalent in money. In S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the Moghal assessment was fixed not by measurement as in the earlier conquered districts, but by the average of the accounts of the ten previous years. In some cases Aurangzeb raised the rents for some years as high as he could and this amount was ever afterwards entered in the accounts as the kam\u00e1l or rack rental though it was subject to permanent and casual remissions.\n\nBefore the rise of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and during their supremacy, many surveys were made of parts or of the whole of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory apparently with the object of readjusting rather than of altering the assessment, which, under the name of kam\u00e1l or rack rent, had remained the same time out of mind. No accurate account of the Bij\u00e1pur survey remains. The standard of measurement was a k\u00e1thi or pole, said to be about five feet, but probably nearer ten feet long. In the time of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1740-1761) one Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1v Amb\u00e1ji surveyed thirty-one villages in W\u00e1i and Kar\u00e1d of which records remained in 1822. Other villages were surveyed by Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1ma Bhagvant m\u00e1latd\u00e1r of Chandan-Vandan and B\u00e1bu Krishnar\u00e1v of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra but the records were lost. The unit of measure is said to have been six h\u00e1ths or ten feet. Probably none of these surveys extended to the hill lands. In alienated villages, which keep many old practices, the valley lands pay a fixed rent while the uplands are measured year by year. The rates are fixed by the square rod of land actually cultivated. About 1751 parts of Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva,\n\n---\n\n1 Contributed by Mr. J. W. P.

According to Mr. Ogilvy, the mode he adopted was to cause a small medium portion of the crop to be cut for several seasons and then to estimate from this specimen the produce of the entire field. The assessment was fixed on a calculation of the market prices for a series of years. Mr. Ogilvy, Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, 419 of 29th October 1851, Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 23-24.\n3 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 21.\n4 Captain Grant afterwards Grant Duff mentions a stone at Nher in Khat\u00e1v with a measure of five cubits and three hand-breadths. Another mark by its side showed what was supposed to be Shiv\u00e1ji's standard and this was six cubits and three hand-breadths. According to the general opinion Shiv\u00e1ji's measure was five cubits and five hand-breadths or nearly ten feet. East India Papers, IV. 646.\nCaptain Grant, 17th June 1822, East India Papers IV. 646.\nKh\u00e1napur, and Bij\u00e1pur, were measured under the auspices of the Pant Pratinidhi.\\(^1\\) Though surveyed they do not seem to have been assessed.\\(^2\\) About 1821 the Bij\u00e1pur sub-division was surveyed and assessed and every piece of land then received a nominal rent.\\(^3\\)\n\nAbout 1822 the acre rates returned for good land varied from \u00a31 16s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 18 a. \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) to 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)); for mixed land from 18s. \u00bed. (Rs. 9 a. \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)) to 1s. 8\u00bcd. (13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as.); and for upland from 4s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 2 as. 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) to 6\u00bed. (4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as.). The acre rate in garden land varied from \u00a32 16s. 4\u00bed. (Rs. 28 as. 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) to 2s. 3d. (Rs. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)).\\(^4\\) In Captain Grant's opinion these rates were so high that if the whole land had been subject to them no margin would have been left for the landholder's maintenance. In practice the landholder tilled less heavily rented alienated or leasehold land, and even portions of the village lands which nominally were liable to the full rates were let off with short rates or khand makta. The landholders were also helped by the pay which members of most families earned in the chief's retinue or in his army.\n\nThe officers immediately connected with the land management were hereditary. In the village they were the p\u00e1t\u00edl or headman, the kulkarni or clerk, and the chaughula or assistant headman. These offices were of remote antiquity. The word p\u00e1t\u00edl is possibly of Musalm\u00e1n origin,\\(^5\\) but the older words g\u00e1vda and gr\u00e1m\u00e1dhik\u00e1ri prove the antiquity of the office. The ancient name for the kulkarni was gr\u00e9m tekhak or village writer. The p\u00e1t\u00edl was the head of the village and with the kulkarni superintended the collection of the revenue.\\(^6\\) The p\u00e1t\u00edl apportioned the assessment and managed cultivation, the kulkarni kept the accounts and records, and the chaughula helped the p\u00e1t\u00edl. Over the village authorities were the deshmukh or group head and the deshp\u00e1nde or group clerk. As presidents of panch\u00e1its or juries they had special power to settle cases relating to hereditary property. The office of desh-chaughula also existed, but seems to have been a Mar\u00e1tha institution. Deshmukhs and deshp\u00e1ndes are probably as ancient as the village offices. Grant Duff thought they were as ancient as the Bahmani dynasty and probably of far remoter origin, but it is not proved that the offices were hereditary before the Musalm\u00e1ns. No S\u00e1t\u00e1ra records have been traced which give in early Hindu times the grades of officers who held power between the deshmukh and the R\u00e1ja. In Musalm\u00e1n times the revenue was farmed and collected by agents of government named amils. Still the authority of the deshmukhs and deshp\u00e1ndes\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) On this measurement Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, Kh\u00e1napur, and Bij\u00e1pur were assessed in 1851, Bom. Gov. Rev.

They frequently had charge of forts and often farmed the revenue of their districts. The superintendent of amils over a considerable tract of country was termed mok\u00e1sd\u00e1r who was probably paid by a percentage on the revenues. Frequently above the mok\u00e1sd\u00e1r was a subhed\u00e1r who did not live constantly in the district and took no share in the revenue management. The mok\u00e1sd\u00e1r's office was occasionally but not often hereditary. Mokribkh\u00e1n Mok\u00e1sd\u00e9r of Kar\u00e1d and Khat\u00e1v was succeeded by his son and grandson. On the other hand the appointment often lasted only for a year. Mok\u00e1sd\u00e1rs were not always Musalm\u00e1ns. The deshp\u00e1nd\u00e9s and deshmukhs were a source of division in authority and frequently resisted the Bij\u00e1pur government. To reduce their power Shiv\u00e1ji (1668-69), while maintaining the village officers, abolished the interference of the hereditary district officers in the land management, but they continued to have considerable influence as referees in questions relating to hereditary property. At the same time Shiv\u00e1ji established a strict check over the p\u00e1t\u00edls and kulkarn\u00eds in the shape of a staff of district agents styled tarafd\u00e1rs or t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, an upper class of clerks who tested the revenue management of a group of villages and did clerical work. For the active duties there was a hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r for each t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, and a subhed\u00e1r or m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r with a similar charge over a larger area. Highest of all under the Peshw\u00e1s or prime ministers was the mujumd\u00e1r or finance minister and the sabnis or record-keeper.\u00b9 The Peshw\u00e1s continued the same system and M\u00e1hdavr\u00e1v Ball\u00e1l (1761-1772) brought it to considerable efficiency. The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were appointed from year to year, but they were not removed during good behaviour. Government estimated a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's expenditure and receipts at the beginning of the year. He had a salary, a public and private establishment, and a right to a private assessment of about five per cent on the revenue. He had to advance part of the expected revenue to government, receiving a premium of ten per cent and one per cent interest monthly until the period when collections were expected, when the interest ceased. The accounts when closed were carried by the district jadnis or m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's first clerk to Poona and carefully examined. The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were encouraged to live in their districts, and when they could not the affairs of the district were closely examined. This system continued but more laxly till the time of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v II. (1796) when the whole system went to ruin. The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs either themselves became, or were replaced by contractors, who farmed the revenue of the districts and treated the landholders with the greatest harshness. The contractors were usually given civil and criminal jurisdiction and the people had no redress.\n\nThe village and district officers were originally hereditary.\u00b2 They were paid by the grant of lands and by certain dues. The p\u00e1t\u00edls and\n\n\u00b9 To the time of the Peshw\u00e1s belong the expressions n\u00e1dauganda and deshchaughula that is district head and district assistant, sar p\u00e1t\u00edl or head p\u00e1t\u00edl, and the revival of the term mok\u00e1sd\u00e1r with a new signification explained in the section on the revenue system.\n\n\u00b2 Mr. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S. His authorities are Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Letters of June 1822, and information obtained by inquiry into hereditary office cases.\nkulkarnis held rent-free lands and in Mar\u00e1tha times if not earlier enjoyed the mush\u00e1hira or salary, and the tashrif and shirp\u00e1vo or honorary presents of cash and turbans at the yearly revenue settlement. These charges were allowed when the village revenue was collected and the amounts were deducted from the receipts. The alienated land was divided among all the members of the p\u00e1t\u00edl and kulkarni families. But the extras were generally paid only to the officiating p\u00e1t\u00edl or kulkarn\u00ed, though in some villages the relations obtained a share.\u00b9 From the landholders the p\u00e1t\u00edl and kulkarni received presents of grain called ghugris, varying from eight to twelve pounds (4-6 shers) to the bigha of land, or one-tenth, eight pounds in eighty (4 shers in the man), of the grain yield. They also enjoyed other very ancient perquisites termed marks of honour or m\u00e1n-p\u00e1n. The chief of these marks of honour were charm\u00ed joda or a pair of shoes from the village shoemaker; the Dasra sheep allowed from the village expenses; \u00bc anna weight of oil from the oilman on working days; oil and molasses given by merchants on the cattle festival in Ash\u00e1dh or June-July; pieces of cloth, blankets, betel-leaf, or vegetables from the sellers and makers of these articles; a small tax of \u00bc or \u00bd a. (1\u00bd to 3 farthings) a piece on all traders; and to the p\u00e1t\u00edl two-thirds of watching fees of three farthings to a half-penny a head a night on travellers and others. They also helped themselves largely to the s\u00e1d\u00edlv\u00e1r or extra village expenses. These were assessed and their amounts fixed by the village officers and were a source of much complaint on the part of the villagers.\n\nGovernment occasionally exercised careful supervision over these extra village charges. But before British influence became paramount in 1818, the usual practice was to care little for exactations from which the state did not suffer. The policy regarding hereditary officers seems to have been to allow the land to descend by the ordinary rules of Hindu inheritance, but, as far as possible, to forbid or at least to restrict its alienation out of the family. This would have the effect of attaching to the soil a family with a stake and interest in the village, and this was considered the most suitable material from which to choose the officials who dealt immediately with the individual landholders. The special items of remuneration in cash and perquisites were to be given to the actual officiators. The modern law adopts a different view. The land possessed by the whole family is regarded as an equivalent for the remuneration of the officiator, and the whole land both of officiators and of relations is now fully assessed while the officiator alone gets a fixed percentage on the revenue of the village. Under former governments the rent-free lands were necessary to keep the family attached to their villages. In the present day they have not the inducement to leave their homes in search of plunder or of military or court employ, and there is no reason why the state should allow the subordinate members of p\u00e1t\u00edl and kulkarni families to hold rent-free\n\n\u00b9 The officiators paid the members of the family a portion of their dues under the name of sv\u00e1miteva or lord's share.\nlands. In spite of state restrictions much of the lands intended for the support of these officers has been alienated especially in the case of the p\u0101t\u012bls who belong to the improvident Mar\u0101tha caste. The alienations are for the most part of long standing and are left undisturbed because the present system secures sufficient remuneration for officiators without interfering with transactions most of which were in good faith, while the levy of a full rate of assessment from those lands has saved the state from loss. The manner in which these hereditary officers perform their revenue duties seldom gives entire satisfaction. A large percentage are fined and suspended from office every year, while about two per cent are dismissed; and convictions for criminal offences, usually embezzlement among the kulkarnis, are not uncommon. At the same time they do a great deal of indispensable work on a small pay, and it may be doubted whether any other system would succeed as well. In early Mar\u0101tha times the district hereditary officers like the p\u0101t\u012bls were paid in land. Besides this they had the collection of certain dues which were levied from the villagers in the form of cesses. The collection of these dues was an occasion of unlimited extortion and even petty warfare. The levy of these dues continued even when the services of these district officers had been dispensed with. Under the Musalm\u0101n kings they collected these dues themselves. But to check their extortion and centre authority in himself Shiv\u0101j\u012b, wherever his rule was established, stopped these collections. During the time of slack rule which followed Shiv\u0101j\u012b\u2019s death, the practice revived, and it was not finally stopped till the establishment of the British system. Since 1863 the hereditary district officers, instead of dues, have been allowed fixed assignments on the revenue, and in lieu of service they pay a cess of one-fourth of their income from both land and cash assignments. Even to a greater extent than those of p\u0101t\u012bls and kulkarnis the lands of district hereditary officers have been alienated. But the alienations have been seldom interfered with so long as the state receives the one-fourth cess. If the hereditary officer no longer holds the land, the one-fourth cess is generally secured to him from the alienee that he may not have to pay Government for lands which he no longer enjoys.\n\nFrom early times the hereditary village accountant probably kept a general statement in which the whole land was first entered and then the commons, roads, village site, and unarable waste were deducted.\u00b9 The arable land was next shown and all alienations noted. The balance was the land on which the government assessment was levied. There was probably also something like the modern pat\u012bta, a statement of the amount each landholder had to pay. No record remains of what accounts were kept in Musalm\u0101n times, but as their names were Musalm\u0101n, the greater number of the forms in use in 1819 seem to have been handed down from Musalm\u0101n times. In 1822 the kulkarni\u2019s accounts included the jamin jh\u016bda or land register, corresponding to the present Form No. I., a record of the name, quality, and contents of every field in the village,\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u0101thas, 16.\nshowing whether it was alienated or not, to what class, first second or third, its soil belonged, and whether it was garden or dry crop. Except in the J\u00e1vli district where there was no record these details were forthcoming in most villages, but were in general incomplete and unworthy of credit. The old land registers were lost or perhaps quite as often hidden under pretence of being lost or burnt during unsettled times. The land register was intended to form the groundwork of the assessment, but its incompleteness or falsity made it little worthy of trust. The second statement, corresponding to the present Form No. VI., was the l\u00e1vni patrak or rent roll, a general record of the lands held and the revenue due by each landholder. In many villages the sardeshmukhi and other cesses were in addition to the rent of the fields and were not shown in the l\u00e1vni patrak or rent roll. The l\u00e1vni patrak for the past year was the most useful paper in framing the yearly village rent settlement as the only changes which had to be made were for fresh cultivation, exchange of fields among landholders, and frauds and embezzlements of land. Neither of the first two records could be trusted till the land was appraised and measured. The third paper, corresponding to the present Form No. III., was the sowing statement or bi peny\u00e1che patrak. This was a monthly statement of sowings kept very irregularly by the kulkarni and forwarded to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, showing the area of land sown in each village for the early and late crops and specifying the amount of land revenue due from each. The fourth paper was a holding statement called kulghadni, showing the area and character of each cultivator\u2019s holding and its rental including extra cesses. It was made out before the rent roll and contained the same information in greater detail. It was a separate account with each landholder instead of a general statement of every holder in the village. The personal or rayatv\u00e1ri settlement was framed with reference to each man\u2019s holding or kulghadni. The kabul kutb\u00e1s or holders\u2019 agreements and the rayatv\u00e1ri patt\u00e1s or state agreements differed from it only in form. The fifth paper was the shop statement or mohtarf\u00e1chi kulv\u00e1r, a record of all the craftsmen and trades people in the village, with the shares of the mohtarfa or professional tax due from each. The sixth paper was the lease roll or ist\u00e1v\u00e1chi patti, stating all the ist\u00e1va or rising leases with the terms of each. The seventh paper, corresponding to the present day-book, was the tahs\u00e1l\u00ed y\u00e1d, a daily account of the landholder\u2019s payments, showing the date of payment and the payer\u2019s name. The eighth paper, corresponding to the present ledger, was bot-khat khat\u00e1vni, an account current with each landholder, showing the amount of revenue paid and the balance due by each. The ninth paper was the patti vasuli or the accounts forwarded from the villages, with all moneys sent to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s office in payment of revenue, specifying all particulars of the remittance. The tenth was the t\u00e1leband showing the revenues and charges under each head. The eleventh was the sars\u00e1l jam\u00e1kharch showing all payments and receipts in the village with the outstanding balances.\n\n1 Captain Grant, 17th June 1822, East India Papers IV. 665.\nThese accounts were brought to light in the investigations made during the first year after the overthrow of the Peshwa (1818). In 1822, after constant corrections during three years, they were thought to be as correct as was possible until a survey was made. In 1822 they supplied a fair estimate of the assessment and enabled the authorities to decide on complaints of extra exactions, because the *kulghadni* or landholder's detailed statement specified every item of revenue to be levied from each individual, and for which he had passed his *kabul kutba* or agreement paper. Whether regular receipts were granted under the original Mar\u00e1tha government does not appear. After 1818 they were granted in regular rotation by the *p\u00e1t\u00edl* to the *rayat*, by the *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r* to the *p\u00e1t\u00edl*, and by the head-quarter officer to the *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r*. In addition to the above the *kulkarni* of each village had to prepare all the *kabul kutb\u00e1s*, by which the landholders signified their willingness to pay the items of revenue they contained. Their information was contained in each landholder's *patta* or deed, which was the state's authority to the landholders to hold the land on the terms agreed. In Mar\u00e1tha times these accounts were most loosely kept and the new system added seriously to the *kulkarni*'s labours. The *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs* kept statements of their charges, corresponding to the village statements, and of these forwarded three to head-quarters at the close of the year. The *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's* three statements were: The *mah\u00e1lki jhadti* a rough account of all receipts and charges; a statement of the revenue settlement of each village; and receipts from persons having fixed allowances and other papers relating to his expenses.\u00b9 The chief defect of the account system was carelessness in specifying alienations, cesses, and exactions.\n\nFrom early times the general revenue system was at least in theory personal or *rayatv\u00e1r*. It is the current theory, says Mr. Grant Duff, that the original tenure was *mir\u00e1s* that is hereditary subject to the payment of rents fixed by the state. According to the same authority the *deshmukhs*, *deshp\u00e1ndes*, and *j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs* or estate-holders at no time claimed such ownership in the soil as was granted to the district officers and estate-holders in Bengal. There were no large landlords in the modern sense of the term. The earliest mention of revenue farming seems to be under the Musalm\u00e1ns. Under the Bij\u00e1pur dynasty the practice became common and the *deshmukhs* and *deshp\u00e1ndes* often farmed the revenues. The *mok\u00e1sd\u00e1rs* were paid by a percentage on the revenue, but there is nothing to show that they farmed it. As far as he could, Shiv\u00e1ji stuck closely to the personal or *rayatv\u00e1r* system. So also did the early Peshw\u00e1s. It was not till the time of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v II. (1796-1818) that revenue farming became usual. The first Mar\u00e1tha claims to the revenue of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra districts were made by Shiv\u00e1ji. He claimed the *chauth* or one-fourth of the existing revenue and the *sardeshmukhi* or extra one-tenth. In theory, in Shiv\u00e1ji's time, the Bij\u00e1pur government got only three-fourths of the standard assessment, Shiv\u00e1ji got one-fourth, and the landholders had to pay one-tenth beyond the former assessment, which tenth was taken by\n\n\u00b9 East India Papers IV, 633,\nShiv\u00e1ji. In practice Shiv\u00e1ji, besides the fourth and the extra tenth, took as much more as he could. The whole was lodged in his treasury. When under Shiv\u00e1ji's successors the government became weak the Mar\u00e1tha sard\u00e1rs or chiefs exacted all they could as sardeshmukhi and chauth. In 1719 these assignments were granted to the Mar\u00e1tha crown on the revenues due to the Moghals from the six Deccan provinces. The territory west of Pandharpur, including the whole of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, with all its revenue was ceded to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The territory thus ceded was supposed to represent Shiv\u00e1ji's original dominions and as such was called the swarajya or own rule. In it the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in theory continued existing rates; in practice they raised the rents according to their fancy. The chauth was not levied in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra because, as the whole of the revenue belonged to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, there was no occasion for a distinct levy of chauth and the term ceased to be used except when this share of the revenue was assigned by the Mar\u00e1tha government to some third party. The sardeshmukhi or extra tenth continued to be levied. In theory therefore, after 1719, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were entitled to eleven-tenths of the old assessment. The extra tenth or sardeshmukhi went to meet the R\u00e1ja's state expenses. Of the rest one-fourth termed b\u00e1bt\u00ed or cesses went to meet his personal expenses. The balance was termed mok\u00e1sa. From this mok\u00e1sa two deductions were made; the sahotra or six per cent on the whole revenue, and the n\u00e1dgaunda that is district head cess or three per cent on the whole revenue. The sahotra was assigned in perpetuity to the Pant Sachiv of Bhor, and the n\u00e1dgaunda or district head cess of three per cent went in gifts to the hereditary chitnis or secretary and to several dhangar or herdsmen chiefs. The details are:\n\n| THE STATE | To ASSIGNEES |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| Per Cent. | Per Cent.    |\n| Extra Tenth or Sardeshmukhi...10 | Six per cent or Sahotra...6 |\n| One-Fourth or B\u00e1bt\u00ed...25 | District Head or N\u00e1dgaunda...3 |\n| | Military or Saranj\u00e9m...66 |\n\nThat is of the whole 110 parts thirty-five came to the R\u00e1ja and seventy-five were assigned to other parties.\n\nThe system was further complicated by giving the various chiefs and officers assignments in each other's districts. Besides there were numerous alienations of revenue in whole villages or districts.\n\n---\n\n1 The six Deccan Provinces were Aurangabad, Ber\u00e1r, Bedar, Bij\u00e1pur, Haidarabad, and Kh\u00e1ndesh.\n\n2 These proportions are from Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In his letter of 17th June 1822 (East India Papers IV. 653) he puts the proportion of n\u00e1dgaunda at 2 per cent on the mok\u00e1sa or 1\u00bd per cent on the whole revenue, and the sahotra at 6 per cent on the mok\u00e1sa or 4\u00bd per cent on the whole. Thus the amount remaining for saranj\u00e9m would be 69 per cent on the whole revenue and not 66 per cent. Also when a Mar\u00e1tha indind\u00e1r calls himself n\u00e1dgaunda or moksd\u00e1r it means that he was the assignee of those items of revenue in some particular district, not that he was a moksd\u00e1r under Musalm\u00e1n rule or ever held the headship of a group of villages in a K\u00e1narese district.\nAccording to Captain Grant Duff\\(^1\\) these artificial divisions of revenue created union and gave an immediate direction to the predatory power in the Deccan. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s would probably never have spread so far but for this means of at once conciliating and controlling the chiefs. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v I. (1720-1740) had neither leisure nor inclination to attend to detail. Every one interpreted the amount of his own or his master's claims according to his power to enforce them rather than his ability to prove their justice. \u0160iv\u00e1ji's more solid institutions remained among his native hills in West S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Poona, and there alienations except by the sovereign's authority usually came direct into the state treasury. The proportions above quoted soon became little more than theoretical. \u0160ardeshmukhi dues especially were collected in the most arbitrary manner, sometimes at only two per cent over the revenue at other times at ten to twenty per cent.\\(^2\\) Until the time of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v II. (1796-1818) matters continued on this footing. He increased his own revenue but injured the administration beyond hope of recovery by the universal introduction of the farming or contract system both for revenue and for expenditure. Revenue contractors who failed in their contracts were forced to give up all their property and that of their sureties, and if all was insufficient, were thrown into hill-forts and treated with the greatest rigour.\\(^3\\) The system of contracts was indefinitely multiplied; those in contract with government sublet their farms. The contractors frequently failed to pay their contracts to government or to each other. The government put pressure on the government contractor and he on those who had taken the under-contracts. Thus in regular gradation pressure passed on the villagers, the whole generally ending in a promise to pay at a future day. The contractor was often a court favourite. To please B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, and in the hope of making his loss good in some other way, he would offer more for a district or village group than it was worth. The under-contractors took all they could from the heads of villages. If a landholder died and the contractor refused remission the village head added the dead landholder's share to the payments due by the other villagers. If the villagers failed to make good the loss, the headman had either to pay the amount himself, raise it from a moneylender, be imprisoned, or sit in the sun with a stone on his head. Villages used to pay the outgoing contractor a sum called antastor secret payment to persuade the incoming contractor that the villagers' payments in the past year were less than they actually were. Contracts were usually yearly but were sometimes for as long as three years. Before 1819 payments were accepted by assignments on bankers or s\u00e1vk\u00e1rs which in exchange charges, interest, and premium cost the landholders one to four per cent a month on their payments. The result was that most villages were burdened by a heavy debt incurred on the responsibility of the headman and on behalf of the village.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 251.  \n\\(^2\\) Grant Duff, 22nd June 1822.  \n\\(^3\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 624-625.\nMar\u0101tha times village creditors relied partly on the headman\u2019s power of forcing the villagers to pay creditors and partly on the support of government. These village debts, says Captain Grant Duff, were nothing more than an extraordinary and increasing land tax occasioned by the misrule of the former government which the profits on agriculture could never have paid, and which in the end must have fallen on the government with which it originated and by whose measures the whole system was countenanced and supported. Of the greater part of the village debts bankers were not the creditors, but individuals engaged in no trade or business except \u2018multiplying this drain on the country.\u2019 \u2018The great mass of these debts\u2019 says Mr. Chaplin \u2018consists of advances or loans to the late Mar\u0101tha government. Both village and private debts have arisen to a great degree out of the exactions of the farming system.\u2019 The crops of a whole village were often mortgaged to creditors before they were ripe, but it was very difficult to distinguish public from private transactions. In 1822 Captain Grant Duff calculated the village debt at \u00a350,000 to \u00a370,000 (Rs. 5 to 7 l\u0101khs). To clear this great burden Captain Grant Duff proposed in each village to conduct a personal inquiry into the history of the debt in the presence of the creditor and of the villagers. Money which had been paid down must in every case be repaid. Where interest payments already equalled or exceeded the sum advanced, a further payment of twelve per cent was to be made and the bond cancelled. When the paid interest already amounted to 150 per cent on the original debt the debt was to be held cancelled. Where new bonds had been passed including principal and interest only the principal was to be paid. When the amount due from the village was fixed it was to be paid by government and their share recovered by instalments from the different landholders. Captain Grant Duff\u2019s proposals were approved by Mr. Chaplin and seem to have been carried out.\n\nThe first step after the establishment of the S\u00e1t\u0101ra R\u0101ja in 1818 was to abolish the revenue contract system and to revert to a strictly personal or rayatuv\u0101r settlement. One great evil of the contract system was that the headman had great opportunities of profiting by exactions in which he was seconded by the authority of government. In transactions with moneylenders the headman made profits which were ensured by heavier exactions on the landholders. Under the system introduced by Captain Grant Duff the headman could not levy one copper in addition to what\n\n---\n\n1 Letter of 14th February 1822, East India Papers IV. 677.\n2 Report on the Deccan para 362, East India Papers IV. 516.\n3 The proportions of the different items which made this total amount were roughly calculated at balances 25 per cent, penalties 41 per cent, new borrowings to pay old 6 per cent, over-assessment 7 per cent, village bonds as surety for personal debts 4 per cent, advances for tillage 2\u00bd per cent, village land 3 per cent, to pay up thefts 1 per cent, due by village officers 4 per cent, security 1 per cent, due to the m\u00e1mlatd\u0101r who paid the amount 1\u00bd per cent, village bonds extorted 2\u00bd per cent...

The total of the items is 90 per cent, not 100 per cent.\nwas stated in the landholders' accounts nor could he defraud the state by granting alienations or unduly easy leases. By improving the system of accounts and enforcing the improved system the headman's unjust gains and tyranny became impossible and the ruinous dealings between villages and moneylenders ceased.\n\nCaptain Grant Duff thus describes the Mar\u00e1tha revenue settlement of a village in the eighteenth century. The total amount of the nakt b\u00e1b or cash taxes, which were the first item in the account, was first put down. Next came the statement of arable land from which were deducted fallow land, alienations, claimants or hakd\u00e1rs that is village officers' land, village devasth\u00e1n or temple endowments, and baluta or village servants' land. If the headman's and accountant's land was not specified, five bigh\u00e1s the ch\u00e1hur were assigned for both together. To the amount of taxes the assessment on the remaining land was added and the whole completed by the addition of seven cesses or patt\u00eds amounting altogether to thirty-two per cent.\\(^1\\) These cesses together with the taxes and net land revenue formed the total rent settlement or jam\u00e1band\u00ed of the village. When the total rent demand was fixed the village authorities, with or without the help of the government agent, proceeded to divide the assessment among the various members of the community. Besides the regular items extra assessments were levied in the same way as the cesses. They were imposed more or less arbitrarily, and once put on were seldom taken off. There were also remissions, some permanent when the gross rental was found to be above the resources of the village, and some occasional for bad harvests and other excuses. These remissions were often corruptly obtained as a matter of favour. The land was divided in p\u00e1nds or twentieths of a bigha, a bigha equal to about three-fourths of an acre, and ch\u00e1hur equal to 120 bigh\u00e1s or 90 acres. Each ch\u00e1hur was probably at one time divided into tik\u00e1s or thik\u00e1s which depended on the number of vadils or heads of families. Each thika had a managing head who in turn apportioned the rent among his bh\u00e1uband or brotherhood, according to the numbers of rokhars or forty-eighth part shares of the thika each held. The thika varied in size from one-half to one-twentieth of a ch\u00e1hur. They were chiefly used in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, V\u00e1lva, W\u00e1i, and Koregaon. Instead of into thik\u00e1s the lands of villages near the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds were divided into khor\u00e1s or valleys, and the lands of the villages in the district of the upper V\u00e1rna known as the V\u00e1rna taraf, were divided into bodk\u00e1s of ten to fifty fields. Each bodka had its manager, who distributed the land and its revenue among the connections while the individual or rayatv\u00e1r settlement was made by the headman with the head landholder. Probably it was formerly the universal custom for the village head to settle only with the family heads and for the family heads to fix the shares due by the different members of the family. When the settlement had been made with each rayat or family head, each family head signed a paper of assent, specifying the quantity and quality of\n\n\\(^1\\) The details were: Expenses of collection at 5 per cent, sardeshmukhi 10 per cent, deshmukhi 5 per cent, deshp\u00e1nd\u00e9 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent, deschaughula 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per cent, sahoira 6 per cent, and n\u00e1dgaunda 2 per cent.\nthe land and the revenue with all extras. From these papers patt\u00e1s or state-agreements were framed and sent to head-quarters for signature and seal. They were returned to the m\u00e1ml\u00e1td\u00e1rs, who, with the village officers, referred to them as the authority for the levy of the assessment.\n\nUnder the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the assessment was paid in four instalments called the tus\u00e1r or early rain crop in October of twenty per cent, the kharijf or chief rain crop in January of twenty-five per cent, the rabi or cold weather crop in March of thirty per cent, and the akhers\u00e1l or hot weather crop in May of twenty-five per cent. These instalments were continued unchanged till 1863, except that the date of taking the tus\u00e1r or first instalment was postponed from October to November, that the landholder might be able to pay it after disposing of some of his crop. Payment was made in different coins, which led to charges for exchange in which the landholder was always a loser. After 1819 the R\u00e1ja's government collected the revenue at two percent discount, which was the charge made by the former government on the ankushi rupee to bring it up to the malh\u00e1r sh\u00e1hi or standard rupee. One and a half per cent of the whole revenue was collected in the V\u00e1lva sub-division by a rupee called by Captain Grant the menik kokeri. The malh\u00e1r sh\u00e1hi was collected in the Bij\u00e1pur district and formed four per cent of the whole revenue. The remaining 94\u00bd per cent were collected in ankushi rupees. Little compulsion was required in collecting the revenue. Landholders in the same and in neighbouring villages went security for one another and distrant was rarely necessary. If a landholder could not pay his rent he ran away. If he was a casual holder or upri any one could take the land; if he was an hereditary holder or mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r some one took the land under condition that the former holder might oust him if he came back and paid what he owed.\n\nAfter the restoration of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1j\u00e1s the old and very heavy assessment was continued. Between 1821 and 1829 Captain Adams surveyed all the lands of the state. The arable area was divided into numbers or fields and the areas of all holdings and grants or in\u00e1ms were fixed. But as no boundary marks were set up the work of the survey was of little use except in preventing in\u00e1ms from encroaching on government land. No permanent revision of the assessment was introduced. Every village had its old kam\u00e1l or standard assess-\n\n---\n\n1 Colonel W. C. Anderson, Survey Commissioner, 881 of 23rd October 1880. In 1851, Mr. afterwards Colonel Parr thought the assessment absorbed half the produce. Mr. Ogilvy the Commissioner thought that even a larger share was taken. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 23.\n\n2 Captain Adams' bigha contained 4444 square yards or 396 square yards less than the English acre of 4840 square yards. The ancient bigha in Mr. Ogilvy's opinion was originally about the same size as the new. Mr. Ogilvy, Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, 419 of 29th October 1851, Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 22-23.\n\n3 Colonel W. C. Anderson, Survey Commissioner, 881 of 23rd October 1880. Colonel Anderson's account agrees with Mr. Sandford's but differs from Mr. Ogilvy's. According to Mr. Sandford the Assistant Commissioner in charge of Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and Bij\u00e1pur (1851), Captain Adams measured the country but the assessment was not altered; the consequence was that great confusion was occasioned by the old bigh\u00e1s and the measurement bigh\u00e1s as they were severally styled. In all but...\nment fixed, and the total assessment of the occupied area of all the villages made up the total kam\u00e1l or standard assessment of any taluka or sub-division. Each field was supposed to be known, and had its name and area recorded in the accounts in kadim or ancient bigh\u00e1s, which was a measure of valuation and not of area, and in the bigha of Adams' survey which was equal to thirty-six gunth\u00e1s or \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\)ths of the English acre. The kam\u00e1l or standard assessment was also entered against each field. Next, as the standard assessment as a rule was too high to be realized, a certain amount was taken off as tota or permanent remission and the concession of which was supposed to prevent the landholder demanding casual remissions. It was in fact supposed to be an agreement to take bad and good years together and contract to pay a certain sum considerably less than the full legitimate demand. In practice the demand for yearly remissions on the plea of poverty and failure of crops remained much as before.\\(^1\\) Under the R\u00e1j\u00e1s' system, landholders were encouraged to increase garden land by advances for making or repairing wells, and by remitting half of the difference of assessment between that laid on dry and on garden lands, if the holder turned dry land into garden.\\(^2\\) Appa S\u00e1heb or Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, the second chief (1839-1848), conferred on the country the benefit of a uniform standard of weights and measures which was in use in 1851 and bore the state stamp.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn 1818, when the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra state was formed, one of the first steps taken was to abolish revenue farming. The village authorities were maintained in full vigour but their actions were carefully watched. The hereditary district officers were not allowed to take part in the revenue administration. Their influence was considered by Captain Grant to depend on their power and their power on their knowledge of embezzlements in their districts, and to be therefore disadvantageous. Their names and signatures were occasionally required in cases of alienation sales and transfers, and arbitrations were sometimes submitted to them by the consent of parties. At first they were often consulted on general subjects, but as they were found untrustworthy, the practice ceased. In the time of the Peshw\u00e1s S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was divided into fourteen m\u00e1mlats or sub-divisions a number which Captain Grant reduced to ten. The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were paid one per cent on the net revenue of their charge. Each m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\n\n---\n\nthe Bij\u00e1pur sub-division the assessment was on the old bigha while the cultivated area was shown in measurement bigh\u00e1s. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 154. According to Mr. Ogilvy the Commissioner (1851), between 1821 and 1829 Captains Chalan and Adams, in communication with heads of villages and other intelligent natives, surveyed the entire territory of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with the exception of the lands of several indmd\u00e1rs and of a few villages in the Bij\u00e1pur sub-division. They revised the assessment by which they made a trifling increase on the whole revenues. The revised rates were introduced and continued in operation for a few years till it was found that owing to the resistance offered by those whose rents had been raised, added to the loss sustained from those whose rents had been reduced, the revenues declined. On this the R\u00e1ja directed that the old rates should be again levied instead of the new. The change confused the accounts by keeping the new bigha and the old rates. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 22.\n\n\\(^1\\) Colonel W. C. Anderson, Survey Commissioner, 881 of 23rd October 1880. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 155. \\(^3\\) Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 27.\nwas not paid precisely in proportion to the amount of the collections, the highest pay was one hundred and seventy and the lowest one hundred rupees a month. Complaints of exactions or tyranny were rare, but fourteen m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were dismissed within the first three years chiefly for bribery and embezzlement. The post of t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r or shekhd\u00e1r that is group clerk or manager and of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r were continued and regular salaries took the place of irregular gains. The accounts were strictly supervised at head-quarters. Under the British system in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, as elsewhere, the district hereditary officers were without duties or powers. The village system was maintained in purity and efficiency. In spite of the elaboration of the system and the changes made to suit modern financial practices the revenue jurisdiction and duties of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs and officers corresponding to the shekhd\u00e1rs were closely analogous to those of ancient times. The working of the system showed that it was suited to the country, fitted to check extortion, and to ensure the punctual collection of any assessment the landholder could afford to pay.\n\nIn spite of Captain Grant Duff\u2019s efforts to improve the system, it continued in several respects loose and uncertain. The village accounts were kept on loose pieces of paper and were never balanced at the end of the year, and the district officers framed their monthly and yearly cash accounts from equally slovenly records. These accounts showed the receipts only and not the disbursements; for it was the practice to remit monthly to the district officers the sums necessary to meet their charges by the hands of the person who had brought the collections to the state treasury. Waste lands were often entered as cultivated and lands let at reduced rates were recorded as fully assessed. The nominal rent of land free from assessments and receipts from other sources, were so mixed with the land revenues as to make their separation almost impossible. No care seems to have been taken to realize the revenues by instalments at seasons convenient to the payers. If arrears accumulated the landholders were pressed for payment when they should have been left undisturbed in their fields.\n\nLarge yearly remissions were always required. When the crops began to ripen the heads of villages and the shekhd\u00e1rs or group managers examined them and reported their state to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. Where any village was reported to have suffered much loss, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r or one of his head writers went and examined the crops. From these reports and from personal observation the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r made a rough estimate of the required remission. At the time of making the rent settlement the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r submitted this rough estimate to the R\u00e1ja. The amount of remission was then fixed in the same way as if the sale of an estate was the subject of discussion. The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r would ask \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) remission. The R\u00e1ja would offer \u00a32000 Rs. (20,000) and so they haggled until some medium sum such as \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000) was agreed on. Armed with authority to remit this sum the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r and his subordinates would go\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov., Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 25-26.\nthrough the several villages, fixing each landholder's remission by a similar process of bargaining. In the end a list was sent to headquarters with every landholder's name and the remission alleged to have been given him. Several cases of dismissal of revenue servants proved that the alleged remissions were not always given,\u00b9 and if they were given they were not distributed till after one or more seasons.\u00b2 If by the R\u00e1ja's permission any portion of the revenue was left uncollected, it was generally not recorded.\u00b3 It often happened that the alleged remissions were made to cover deficiencies arising from inaccurate entries in the accounts, to meet excesses of village expenditure, or to accommodate persons in favour with those in power. Insufficient sums were allowed to meet contingent village expenses and when, as often happened, these sums were exceeded, the poor were defrauded to make good the deficiency.\u2074\n\nA separate establishment was maintained at the capital for the collection of outstanding balances; and as the local officers were not held answerable for their realization they took no pains to prevent their accumulation and made no exertions for their recovery. The very lax manner in which the accounts were kept rendered it extremely difficult for the department specially appointed for the purpose to know from whom they ought to levy the outstandings. The village accountants were bound to keep records of the details, but their accounts were very imperfect, and it was (1851) probable that only a small portion of the whole amount of the outstanding balances could be recovered.\u2075\n\nUnder the R\u00e1ja's revenue system, yearly advances were required to keep up tillage and yearly remissions to save the landholders from ruin. Rents were kept at so high a standard that large balances accumulated, which enabled the government officers to draw the utmost from the landholders and even to absorb, by harsh and questionable means, any profits they might earn in other pursuits than agriculture. In the opinion of Mr. Ogilvy, who was Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in 1851, the system of revenue management under the chiefs destroyed energy and self-dependence and could never lead to improvement.\u2076\n\nSECTION IV.\u2014THE BRITISH.\n\nOn the introduction of British management in 1848, the Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra made the same use of the hereditary district officers, the deshmukhs, deshchaughul\u00e1s, deshp\u00e1ndes, and n\u00e1dgaudd\u00e1s, as had been done in older British districts. He introduced rules under which the pay of village headmen and accountants was raised to a standard more suited to their duties.

Rec. 22 of 1852, 27-28.\nthey were left untouched; when they were not enough they were raised by a percentage scale on the village revenues. One village accountant had sometimes the care of several villages and when their salaries fell short of the authorized percentage on the revenues of their charge, the salary was raised according to that scale.\\(^1\\) The anomaly of having the old rates entered with the new bigh\u00e1s was stopped and orders were issued to the revenue officers directing them, until the assessment was revised to record the ancient bigh\u00e1s and the ancient rates. Contingent allowances for the supply of stationery for village accountants were fixed at a percentage on the village revenues and directed to be spent under the authority of the p\u00e1t\u00eds and kulkarn\u00eds, and to be detailed in the village day-book. The kulkarn\u00eds were ordered to keep regular village accounts under the system of checks in force in other British districts of sealed and numbered pages, and the local officer's signatures at the end of the volumes. The day-books were directed to be balanced daily and the accounts of individuals yearly. A receipt book was given to each landholder in which their payments were regularly entered. The accounts were (1851) kept so as to show the land and extra receipts with every necessary detail. The system was made to resemble as closely as possible that in use in other British districts. In 1851 Mr. Ogilvy from personal observation was satisfied with its efficient working. Corresponding improvements were introduced into the mode of keeping the district accounts. The day-books were balanced daily and the volumes bore the Commissioner's signature. Samples of the district accounts in use in British districts were obtained from the Revenue Commissioner and distributed to the different m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs. Ordinary payments were made from the local treasuries, extraordinary payments formed the subject of separate references. The instalments of revenue were collected at the seasons most convenient to the landholders, and the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were made responsible for the collections. The collection of outstanding balances for former years was also added to their duties. Fields, whose crops were stated to have wholly or partially failed, were minutely inspected by the village and district officers, whose proceedings were watched and revised by the Commissioner and his assistants, and after careful inquiry remissions were granted. Statements framed at head-quarters, bearing the Commissioner's seal and showing the sums due from each landholder and the remissions allowed, were fixed for general information in a conspicuous part of every village. There was little risk (1851) that the relief failed to reach those for whom it was intended.\\(^2\\) Under the system introduced (1848-1851) by Mr. Frere, every field in which there was any loss was examined by the village officers who prepared a return showing\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The percentage paid to headmen was: On the gross land revenues up to Rs. 500 five per cent, from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1000 \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent, from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 2000 two per cent, from Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000 \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent, from Rs. 3000 to Rs. 4000 one per cent; beyond Rs. 4000 half per cent. Percentage paid to village clerks: On the gross land revenues up to Rs. 1000 five per cent, from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 2000 four per cent, from Rs. 2000 to Rs. 3000 three per cent; from Rs. 3000 to Rs. 4000 two per cent, beyond that one per cent. Bom., Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 28-29.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom., Gov. Rev., Rec. 22 of 1852, 30-33.\nwhat share the crop bore to a full crop. The shekhd\u00e1r or m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s group-clerk came round and entered his opinion of the field. Finally the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r or his shirasted\u00e1r or head k\u00e1rkun examined the field and recorded his opinion. This last estimate unless it greatly differed from that recorded by the village officers was accepted as final. When the difference was striking the officer who made the revenue settlement or jam\u00e1bandi inquired into the matter. The result of the examination of all the fields was embodied in a village abstract, which again was put into a list prepared for each division or th\u00e1na, and the division list was embodied in a memorandum showing the state of the crops for the whole district. A lump remission was fixed as the share of the loss which Government should bear. This lump remission was then divided until each landholder\u2019s name appeared with the amount due and the amount remitted. The village deed or patta which formerly contained collections without showing remissions or expenses was then filled and given to the headman. A memorandum was also prepared showing each landholder\u2019s name, the amount he had to pay, and what remissions were given him. This memorandum was posted in the village office or temple. As a further precaution the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r or one of his clerks went through the sub-division and entered in each landholder\u2019s receipt book the revenue he had to pay and the remission he received. During the first two years of British rule (1847-1849) remissions were given on the old plan and during the next two years they were given on the plan detailed above. The new system worked without complaint.\n\nIn 1850-51 the lands of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra stretched about 160 miles from north to south and 150 miles from east to west. Exclusive of chiefs\u2019 territories it included the eleven sub-divisions of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1rgaon, Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, J\u00e1vli, W\u00e1i, Koregaon, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Khat\u00e1v, Pandharpur, and Bij\u00e1pur. Of 1697 villages 1175 were Government and 522 were alienated. The sub-divisions of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1rgaon, Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, J\u00e1vli, and W\u00e1i, nearest to the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, were the most favoured in soil and climate, the richest, best tilled, and most populous. They were watered by numerous streams fed by abundant and seasonable rain. They were crossed by lofty mountains whose steep sides were often clothed with crops, while their tops were crowned with fields and villages. In these sub-divisions much of the land was alienated on rent-free or service tenure. Of what remained and was assessable, the largest part was mir\u00e1s that is held by hereditary holders who could not be ousted so long as they paid the government rental. The commonness of this favourable tenure kept the west of the district in the highest cultivation. The eastern sub-divisions of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Khat\u00e1v, Pandharpur, and Bij\u00e1pur were less favoured in soil and climate, and, being more liable to invasion and to failure of rain, had been so wasted by war and famine that few hereditary holders were left. The husbandmen had no interest\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 144-148,\n2 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 15.\nin the soil, and as they were not bound to particular fields exerted themselves to exhaust rather than to improve the land. These four eastern sub-divisions were much less highly tilled than those in the west. At the same time they were great pasture-countries, and the cattle of Bij\u00e1pur, owing probably to the tracts of salt laden soil, were highly esteemed. Still they were not numerous enough to meet the demand and numbers of cattle were brought from M\u00e1wa. The buffaloes of Bij\u00e1pur were equally celebrated and their tup or ghi that is clarified butter was said to keep longer fresh than any other ghi. The soils to the west were dark and rich; those to the east were light and poor. Kar\u00e1d was the richest agricultural sub-division in the district and Bij\u00e1pur the poorest. Though the stiff black western soils sometimes required six pairs of bullocks to draw a single plough, and though they were generally highly manured, the heavy and continuous crops they yielded more than repaid the cost of tillage. In the west watered lands yielded four crops and unwatered lands two crops a year. The valleys in and bordering on the Konkan mountains grew rice\\(^1\\) and wheat while the hill sides yielded the inferior grain called n\u00e1chni. In some parts of this tract, especially in the otherwise poor sub-division of J\u00e1vli, the soil was red and rich, and nip\u00e1ni or unwatered sugarcane was grown. Much labour and careful farming was required to grow this cane; but the yield was better than the yield of watered cane.\\(^2\\) During 1850-51 about 7136 acres (9515 bigh\u00e1s) of native and 4151 acres (5535 bigh\u00e1s) of Mauritius sugarcane were grown chiefly for local use. Without much encouragement from the Government, the cultivators had greatly extended the growth of Mauritius cane as they found it pay.\n\nThe west yielded the finest jv\u00e1ri and the east the best b\u00e1jri, the grains most eaten by the people. During 1850-51 about 4413 acres (5884 bigh\u00e1s) of tobacco were grown. It appeared to be of superior quality and it was largely exported though not beyond seas. Mr. Ogilvy wished to introduce Syrian tobacco and to grow some from Nadi\u00e1d seed to compare it with that of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. A small quantity of opium was grown during 1850-51 from \\(5\\frac{1}{2}\\) bigh\u00e1s of poppy in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Koregaon sub-divisions. The district officers were ordered to take the opium from the growers, who, if Government approved, would be paid for the drug at such rate as the opium Agent might determine. At the village of Deur in W\u00e1i, belonging to the R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1gpur, opium was also grown and sold for the benefit of the proprietor. During the same year 11,155 bigh\u00e1s of native cotton were grown. Its production was increasing, but the quantity varied with the state of the foreign market. It was estimated that, under the stimulus of unlimited demand, nearly 40,000 bigh\u00e1s of land or about 36,727 acres might grow cotton. The greater part of the crop was used in the country, the rest found its way to the ports of Chiplun, Khed, and Mah\u00e1d. The best cotton sub-divisions were\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rice was (1850-51) cultivated in those parts of the Kar\u00e1d and V\u00e1lva sub-divisions bordering on the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds where much rain fell. The rice lands in the Bij\u00e1pur sub-division were watered from the magnificent lake of Mamd\u00fapur. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 155.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov., Rev.

San or t\u00e1g that is Bombay hemp was grown to a small extent for making coarse cloth and ropes. Hemp or amb\u00e1di was also grown and used for the same purposes, and g\u00e1y\u00e1l or wild hemp found on the banks of rivers was likewise made into ropes. The produce of various fruit trees growing on Government lands was annually farmed. Mangoes were farmed separately in each village. Tamarind trees, chiefly in Bij\u00e1pur, were farmed in the same manner. Each fruit-bearing jack tree paid 1s. 4\u00bdd. (10\u00bd as.) in Javli and 5\u00bdd. (3\u00bd as.) in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Date trees, mostly near Bij\u00e1pur, were farmed for spirit. In the Koyna valley in T\u00e1rgaon and Javli there was a promising teak forest, and as most of the western hills were capable of yielding teak, b\u00e1bhul, sandal, and other trees, measures had been taken for preserving and improving them.\n\nAn inferior dark and bitter salt was produced in most parts of Bij\u00e1pur and at a few places in Pandharpur and Khat\u00e1v. It was manufactured for limited local consumption only, for sea-borne salt was used throughout the territory. The landholders most of whom were Kunbis were hardworking and skilful husbandmen. They understood the rotation of crops, the value of manures, and the necessity of refreshing some soils by fallows. Individual holdings were small, though probably larger than in some other British districts. Many farms were held by two or more families whose women and children helped in the fields. The following statement shows for eight of the eleven subdivisions the number of landholders and the highest lowest and average rents:\n\n| Sub-Division | Rent. | Landholders | Average Rent. |\n|--------------|-------|-------------|---------------|\n|              | Highest | Lowest | Rs. a. p. |\n| Kar\u00e1d       | 634    | 39      | 9236         | 20 9 6 |\n| V\u00e1lva       | 1848   | 0 14    | 8907         | 25 14 7 |\n| Khad\u00fapur    | 300    | 0 4     | 6333         | 15 0 7 |\n| Bij\u00e1pur     | 399    | 0 4     | 4429         | 19 0 10 |\n| Pandharpur  | 599    | 0 4     | 8132         | 17 7 1 |\n| Khat\u00e1v      | 482    | 0 6     | 7189         | 18 7 1 |\n| Koregaon    | 512    | 1 8\u00bd    | 8516         | 17 0 0 |\n| T\u00e1rgaon     | 587    | 0 2\u00bd    | 5347         | 19 8 3 |\n\nAccording to Captain Adams' measurements in 1822 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra contained 2,683,998 acres (2,923,167 bigh\u00e1s) of arable land. Of these in 1850-51, including alienations but excluding the lands of feudatories, 2,444,459 acres (2,662,283 bigh\u00e1s) were under tillage yielding \u00a3316,079 (Rs. 31,60,790) a year or \u00a335,833 (Rs. 3,58,330) less than the kam\u00e1l or nominal full assessment. Of the rental little more than half came to Government. The arable waste was 239,528 acres.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 38-39. The reference to teak in Javli seems mistaken.

This was probably more than the landholders were able to pay, so that it seemed (1851) that increased cultivation would hardly repay Government for any large and permanent reduction of assessment.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe assessment was in all cases on the land and not on the crop. On watered land the bigha rate averaged about \u00a32 1s. (Rs. 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)), on unwatered land about \u00a31 8s. (Rs. 14), on rice land about \u00a31 14s. (Rs. 17), and on hill side land about 3s. 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (Re. 1 as. 18). In Mr. Ogilvy's opinion these rates were (1851) much heavier than in the surveyed British districts. But as the m\u00e1mul or ancient bigha on which the assessment was based, from time and other causes had probably become somewhat indefinite, there was possibly less difference in the actual incidence. Reduction as well as revision of rates was necessary not only because prices had fallen from the cessation of the court expenditure, but also because the more the country became opened by roads so as to admit the cheaper produce of the neighbouring districts into the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra markets, the more must prices fall and with them the landholder's power to pay high rates. Mr. Ogilvy (1851) had no means of ascertaining when or by whom the assessment was originally fixed or on what principle it was imposed, or whether it was at that time light or heavy. In his opinion the price of produce and the value of the precious metals were liable to so many fluctuations that fixed money rents could never for any length of time represent the same proportion of the crop.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn Kar\u00e1d and V\u00e1lva the dry crop assessment looked startling, being as high as and even higher than the garden rates. This was partly owing to the richness of the soil on the banks of the Krishna and probably still more to the large size of the ancient or kadim bigha on which the rates were charged.\\(^3\\) Garden land was divided into three classes dam-watered or dharan b\u00e1g\u00e1yat, lift-watered or budki b\u00e1g\u00e1yat, and well-watered or vih\u00edr b\u00e1g\u00e1yat. In the dam-watered or dharan b\u00e1g\u00e1yat land, the dam was generally of earth stones and grass. It had to be renewed every year and repaired after every dry weather thunderstorm. The cost of these repairs was nearly equal to the keep of a pair of bullocks. In the lift-watered land or budki b\u00e1g\u00e1yat the water was raised from a stream or pool by bullocks as from a well. In the well-watered or vih\u00edr b\u00e1g\u00e1yat the chief element of cost was the keep of one or more pairs of bullocks. The variety of the soil in the different parts of the district also gave rise to difference in the rates of garden assessment.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe following statement\\(^5\\) shows the highest, average, and lowest bigha rates of assessment on garden, rice, and dry-crop lands in four of the eleven sub-divisions:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Ogilvy, Comr. 419 of 29th Oct. 1851, Bom.

(2 as.) to 2s. (Re. 1). It was a partial tax. In some villages it was levied on shopkeepers and strangers only, in others on landholders also, but never on Br\u00e1hmans and *vatand\u00fars*, and rarely on labourers. Buffalo or *vanchar\u00e1\u00ed* that is grazing tax of one rupee was levied on each buffalo not engaged in cultivation and not belonging to the village headmen. It yielded upwards of \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000). In some parts a tax levied on cattle driven to pasture yielded about \u00a3437 (Rs. 4370). A grazing tax on sheep yielded about \u00a32426 (Rs. 24,260). It was levied at different rates in almost every village and averaged a little over 12s. (Rs. 6) the hundred sheep.\n\nAs S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was so well watered both by large rivers and small streams Mr. Ogilvy thought that \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) a year should be set apart for water works.

The Commissioner in 1849 (37 of 13th April) showed the effect on prices in contiguous sub-divisions caused by the facilities or the impediments to communication. The use of carts instead of pack bullocks would lower the cost of transport in the proportion of 5 to 3 and effect a saving of time in the proportion of 6 to 4.

As the assessment on the land remained unchanged the rental must have pressed with more than double weight on the landholders. A field assessed at 4s. (Rs. 2), yielding Rs. 6 in the time of the Peshwa and 6s. (Rs. 3) in 1852, would leave to the husbandmen 8s. (Rs. 4) in the former period and 2s. (Re. 1) in the latter or only a quarter of his former profits. This showed the pressing need of a revision of the assessment, since rents that might once have been light might now (1852) be ruinous.\\footnote{Mr. Ogilvy, Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, 520 of 26th October 1852, Bom.

Of these Bij\u00e1pur has passed to Bij\u00e1pur and Pandharpur to Shol\u00e1pur; the other nine sub-divisions still belong to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Besides these a group of nineteen villages, eight of the Soni estate or j\u00e1gir which lapsed in 1845 and eleven of the T\u00e1sgaon estate or j\u00e1gir which lapsed in 1848, were in 1848 formed into a sub-division styled T\u00e1sgaon, which was originally given to Belgaum but since, between 1857 and 1864, has belonged to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The survey settlement was introduced into this T\u00e1sgaon sub-division in 1852-53, reported in 1855-56, and sanctioned by Government in 1856-57. In 1857 some villages were handed from T\u00e1sgaon to Athni and some from Athni to T\u00e1sgaon. After T\u00e1sgaon the survey settlement was introduced into Khat\u00e1v and M\u00e1yni in 1858-59; into Koregaon and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur in 1859-60; into W\u00e1i in 1860-61; into S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, J\u00e1vl\u00ed, T\u00e1rgaon, and part of Helv\u00e1k in 1861-62; and into Kar\u00e1d, Helv\u00e1k, and V\u00e1lva in 1862-63. The total number of surveyed and settled villages was 933, and the effect of the survey settlement was a fall in the rental on the tillage area from \u00a3119,538 to \u00a3115,189 (Rs. 11,95,380 to Rs. 11,51,890) or about four per cent. The following statement shows the order in which the different sub-divisions were settled and the effect of the survey settlement in each group:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Works to improve communication were (1851) in active progress under the Civil Engineer, while the Superintendent of Cotton Experiments was engaged in making and distributing carts of a superior description.

In 1848, on the death without heirs of the T\u00e1sgaon chief, his estate or j\u00e1gir came into the hands of Government. The eleven villages near T\u00e1sgaon and Athni were formed into a separate m\u00e1latd\u00e1r\u2019s charge in which were also included eight neighbouring villages which had belonged to the Soni chief\u2019s estate which had lapsed three years before. Most of these nineteen villages enjoyed a fairly certain and sufficient rainfall. Grain was the chief produce and the early or kharif harvest was more important than the late. Some sugarcane was grown in garden lands. The population was 39,061 or 243 to the square mile. Tillage was almost the only industry. In T\u00e1sgaon of 9000 people nearly 400 were weavers and dyers. The chief import and export markets were Athni, S\u00e1ngli, T\u00e1sgaon, and Miraj. Of the nineteen Government villages in T\u00e1sgaon eight had been in the hands of Government since the death of the Soni chief in 1845, and the remaining eleven since the death of the T\u00e1sgaon chief in 1848. In 1855 at the time of the settlement beyond a few doubtful fragments no revenue returns could be found for any of these villages before their lapse to Government. Little was known of the revenue management of the Soni and T\u00e1sgaon chiefs. Captain Anderson believed it fairly represented the average management of Mar\u00e1tha chiefs.\n\nThe kam\u00e1l or rack rent was too high to be ever realised; it was twice to four times the amount actually levied. Though the landholders agreed to till at those excessive rates there was an unspoken understanding that the full rates should not be levied. Regarding the amount to be paid the views of the two parties differed greatly. The landholder was determined to pay the smallest possible amount; the chief or the chief\u2019s agent intended to levy every rupee over what was required to keep the landholder able and willing to till the land during the next season. The chief often took more than this and left the landholder dependent on advances for food and seed. The unpaid balance of the nominal rent was\n\n---\n\n1 Besides these there were two alienated villages. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCV. 4.\nadded to the landholder's outstandings. Some of these outstandings were realised in an unusually good season, and the threat of levying the rest was held over a landholder who either refused to till as much land as the chief wished him to till, or threatened to leave the chief's state. Rather than allow land to remain waste, if no one would till it at the usual nominal rates, it was given for tillage at any procurable rate, the difference between the actual rate and the full assessment being shown as khand tota or loss by agreement. Lands held on these terms were entitled to no remission. Against the great advantage of holding land with this remission in advance, was the fact that the land was held for only one year so that any attempt to improve it was lost labour. With kindly management a fair share of comfort was possible under this system. At the same time no advance was possible under it as the amount levied was based not on the productive power of the land but on the produce.\n\nIn spite of their enormous nominal assessment the T\u00e1sgaon landholders were not very badly off under the native system. They were slaves but their masters were considerate, and seldom tightened their bonds beyond the limits of endurance. They were not allowed to become wealthy; on the other hand they were seldom or never reduced below the level of a fair subsistence. They were the chief's milch cows which he took care no one but himself should touch. The gross produce in a well-managed native district was greater than in unsurveyed British districts, but far short of the gross produce of surveyed British districts where the landholder had learned that he worked for himself, not only for the state. In Captain Anderson's opinion whatever might be the defects of the native system of management, the lapse of a district and the consequent introduction of the British revenue system was by no means a boon to the people. Probably a century or two had passed since the nominal or kam\u00e1l assessment had been fixed. During that time the standards of value had changed. Even had the standards remained unchanged, the rates and apportionment of the assessment and the boundaries of fields had in many cases been forgotten. Under native management this change was of little practical consequence, as the old rates though kept in the accounts were, either by extensive remissions or by special agreement, so far modified as to be bearable. In settling the T\u00e1sgaon villages in 1848-49 Mr. Manson noticed that lands had been granted by the chief to his officials instead of ready-money payments, but the nominal value set opposite these lands was seldom realized. The receivers of these lands who were styled stipendiaries or tain\u00e1t\u00edd\u00e1rs sublet them at rates lower than those shown in the books. In the T\u00e1sgaon villages thirty-one landholders had written agreements with the grantees, and as they had begun to sow and had been at\n\n---\n\n1 Captain W. C.

They were warned that next year the full assessment would be charged. Again in 1850 Mr. Manson writes that a large sum \u00a3638 (Rs. 6380) had been included among remissions under the head of *khand tota* or loss by agreement.\\(^1\\) This loss was on land which the former rulers had let considerably under the nominal assessment. The holders of these lands made no claims to any special right to hold land at less than the regular rates. Still the fact of the agreement was proved and as they had been at expense in bringing the land into order, Mr. Manson felt bound to continue the specially low rates for a year. The holders were warned that at the close of the year the full assessment would be levied.\n\nThe result of levying the full assessment was that much of the land was thrown up. The first English officers, knowing that their position laid them open to fraud, naturally felt that their only safe course was to enforce the full assessment. In this way the adjustments which experience had forced on the former rulers were ignored at the cost of much hardship to the people in the first instance and in the end of serious loss to the state. The fact that the levy of the full assessment was followed by the throwing up of land showed the English officers that in all cases the nominal rates could not safely be enforced and liberal remissions were accordingly granted. Other expedients also helped to relieve the people from the full pressure of the rates. They reduced their holdings, gave up the land bearing the highest assessment, and the district and village officers found it necessary not to look too minutely into encroachments on Government waste. Through shifts and evasions matters at last found their level. But before this state of things was reached, the people's resources were reduced to the lowest ebb.\\(^2\\) The following statement of the chief revenue details of the eight Soni and the eleven T\u00e1sgaon villages shows that the system of adjustment by shifts and evasions was accompanied in the Soni villages by a fall in tillage from about 15,000 acres in 1845-46 to about 10,000 in 1851-52 and in the T\u00e1sgaon villages from 37,625 acres in 1848-49 to 32,693 acres in 1851-52. The details are:\n\n**Soni-T\u00e1sgaon Tillage and Revenue, 1845-1852.**\n\n| Villages | Year | Cultivation | Assessment | Acre Rate | Remissions | Collections |\n|----------|------|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|\n| Soni (8) | 1845-46 | 14,974 | Rs. 35,042 | 2 5 5 | Rs. 10,646 | Rs. 24,496 |\n|          | 1846-47 | 14,250 | Rs. 33,444 | 2 5 7 | Rs. 8116 | Rs. 25,328 |\n|          | 1847-48 | 12,882 | Rs. 34,675 | 2 11 1 | Rs. 4252 | Rs. 30,423 |\n|          | 1848-49 | 11,909 | Rs. 32,394 | 2 8 6 | Rs. 3840 | Rs. 25,548 |\n|          | 1849-50 | 11,784 | Rs. 27,732 | 2 7 7 | Rs. 4689 | Rs. 23,023 |\n|          | 1850-51 | 10,232 | Rs. 27,222 | 2 10 4 | Rs. 1098 | Rs. 26,125 |\n|          | 1851-52 | 10,191 | Rs. 26,667 | 2 9 11 | Rs. 1303 | Rs. 25,334 |\n| T\u00e1sgaon (11) | 1845-49 | 37,625 | Rs. 76,306 | 2 0 5 | Rs. 9055 | Rs. 67,851 |\n|           | 1849-50 | 30,618 | Rs. 59,550 | 1 15 1 | Rs. 4616 | Rs. 54,934 |\n|           | 1850-51 | 26,479 | Rs. 54,916 | 1 14 10 | Rs. 1475 | Rs. 53,441 |\n|           | 1851-52 | 32,693 | Rs. 62,945 | 1 14 10 | Rs. 2059 | Rs. 60,886 |\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Manson, 277 of 4th Nov. 1850 paras 5 and 7, Bom.

Sel., XCIV. 23-26.\nBesides the marked decline in tillage this statement shows that from the first liberal remissions were granted. It also shows that in the first two years the acre rate was lower than in any after years. On acquisition of these villages much land was held by Br\u0101hmans and others on rates lower than the full assessment. In a year or two the full rates were levied on these lands, so that in 1847-48 though the whole tillage had fallen from 14,974 to 12,882 acres in consequence of the levy of full instead of reduced rates the average acre rate rose from 4s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 2 as. 5\u00bd) to 5s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 2 as. 11\u00bd). From 1847-48 till the near approach of the survey in 1850-51 the returns show a steady fall in the average acre rates. This fall was due to the fact that the pressure of the rates forced the better lands out of tillage. In consequence of the T\u0101gaon chief's indebtedness during the last years of his life the T\u0101gaon villages had been very heavily assessed. After their lapse to the British much smaller remissions were granted in the T\u0101gaon than in the Soni villages, and according to local information much larger sums were levied than had been realised by the chief. The result was by 1850-51 the lands of these villages were deeply mortgaged.\n\nIn 1850-51 Mr. Manson, the Assistant Political Agent who was then in charge of this district, estimated that of the \u00a34037 (Rs. 40,370) paid into the treasury on account of the three first revenue instalments of that year, no less than \u00a31931 (Rs. 19,310) were raised by loans from moneylenders. He was satisfied (1850) that the shrinking of tillage and the failing revenue proved that the assessment was too high. In the T\u0101gaon villages the dry crop bigha\u00b3 assessment ranged from 6s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 3 - 10) on the black soils on the Krishna banks. In the village of Palus it was as low as 3s. 3d. (Rs. 1\u00bd).\n\nIn 1855 Colonel Anderson had no doubt that under British rule more revenue was raised from this sub-division than it could afford to pay, and that a material reduction in assessment was required. The new rates of assessment in this sub-division as well as in Athni were fixed in 1852 in conjunction with Captain Wingate. The nineteen villages were distributed among four classes which were charged highest dry crop acre rates varying from 4s. (Rs. 2) to 1s. 9d. (14 as.). In the first class, with a highest dry crop acre rate of 4s. (Rs. 2), were ten villages close to the Krishna with a good climate and good markets. In the second class, with a highest dry crop acre rate of 3s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd), were five villages further inland with a less certain rainfall. In the third class, with a highest dry crop acre rate of 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd), were two villages further inland than the second class, with shorter rainfall and not so well placed for markets. The remaining two villages formed the fourth class and were charged a highest dry crop acre rate of 1s. 9d. (14 as.). Most of the villages had more or less garden land. The chief gardens were at Soni, T\u0101gaon, Yerandoli, Bhosa, and Palus. About one-sixth of the\n\n\u00b9 Letter 7 of 20th Nov. 1851 para 25. \u00b2 Report 277 of 4th Nov. 1850 para 5.\n\u00b3 This bigha is a measure of value, not of area. It ranged from one to six acres and in one case was as much as twelve acres. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCIV, 29.\n\u2074 Bom. Gov. Sel. XCIV. 28-29.\nwhole garden area was given to sugarcane. T\u00e1sgaon and Soni together had between nine and ten acres of betel-leaf. In the remaining gardens wheat, turmeric, and vegetables were the chief crops. The old garden rates varied much in different villages, the highest average assessment in any village being 16s. 5d. (Rs.8 as.3\u00bd) in Besur. Some villages in which the survey officer found garden land had no garden land shown in the old accounts. The land had been held as dry crop, but it was generally highly rated in some cases heavier than the new garden rates. In most villages water was found near the surface. Several streams also ran for a great part of the year and could be dammed at a trifling cost. With these facilities and the fixed survey tenure it was hoped that the area of watered land would rapidly spread. The nature of the well, the quantity of water and its depth from the surface, the crops grown, and the class of soil were the chief data on which the assessment of well-watered garden land or motasthal b\u00e1g\u00e1yat was fixed. In channel-watered or p\u00e1tasthal land, the cost of repairing the channel and the date to which the channel ran had also to be considered. The assessment was fixed by the Survey Superintendent field by field, after considering the whole data mentioned above for each field. The following statement shows the highest, lowest, and average survey garden rates and assessment:\n\n**T\u00e1sgaon Garden Survey Rates, 1852-53.**\n\n| Description | Former | Survey |\n|-------------|--------|--------|\n|             | Area   | Rental | Average Acre Rate | Area | Rental | Average Acre Rate | Highest Acre Rate | Lowest Acre Rate |\n| Well-watered | ...    | ...    | ...               | 893  | 2672   | 3 0 0           | 4 0 1            | 1 8            |\n| Channel-watered | ...    | ...    | ...               | 55   | 115    | 2 1 5           | 4 12             | 0 12           |\n| Both        | ...    | ...    | ...               | 252  | 791    | 3 2 3           | 6 4              | 3 0            |\n| Total       | 1055   | 4321   | 4 1 7             | 1200 | 3578   | 2 15 8          | 6 4              | 0 12           |\n\nThe effect of the new rates was in every class a reduction in the average acre rate of about one-third on the old assessment.

Except about thirty villages in the Phaltan plain below the Mah\u00e1dev hills on the north, Khat\u00e1v was a tableland divided from Pandharpur on the east by a well marked line of hills. On the north Khat\u00e1v was separated from the Phaltan plain by the Mah\u00e1dev range; on the west a third line of hills divided Khat\u00e1v from Koregaon; and to the south the country sloped gradually into Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. Khat\u00e1v was a fairly regular oblong about forty miles from east to west and about twenty-five from north to south. The climate varied greatly. On the east on the Pandharpur boundary the rainfall was scanty and uncertain; the south-west supply became more plentiful towards the west, and in the extreme west was sufficient and certain. Except in the east and south-east the Khat\u00e1v villages were well placed for markets. Phaltan one of the chief local trade centres was six to fifteen miles from the north-western villages and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the other local centre was sixteen to twenty miles from the west villages. The main road from Shol\u00e1pur to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra crossed the group from east to west, and with Phaltan there was ready communication by two roads down the Mah\u00e1dev range. Smaller markets in and near the group were also useful. Except a few scattered cotton and blanket weavers the people lived by tillage. Like Pandharpur, Khat\u00e1v had been part of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chief\u2019s territory. The revenue management of both was the same. In the outlying eastern villages, as in Pandharpur, under the R\u00e1j\u00e1s lavish permanent reductions of revenue had been made. In the closer at hand western villages the rates erred on the side of over rather than of under assessment. The people of the west were better off than those of the east. They had a better climate, the soil was richer, more land was watered, and the markets were better. The very low rates in the east had tempted landholders to take more land than they could properly till. The following statement shows the collections and remissions in the 105 Khat\u00e1v villages during the eleven years ending 1858:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{YEAR} & \\text{OCCUPIED} & \\text{ARABLE WASTE} & \\text{ALIENATED} \\\\\n\\hline\n & \\text{Area.} & \\text{Assessment.} & \\text{Collections.} & \\text{Area.} & \\text{Assessment.} & \\text{Grazing Fees.} & \\text{Area.} & \\text{Assessment.} & \\text{Quit Rent.} \\\\\n\\hline\n1855-56 & 62,169 & 68,283 & 67,188 & 8510 & 3608 & 1082 & 20,015 & 21,010 & 1788 \\\\\n1856-57 & 63,561 & 69,029 & 67,949 & 7129 & 2862 & 1236 & 20,018 & 21,008 & 1907 \\\\\n1857-58 & 65,070 & 96,422 & 69,652 & 5850 & 2594 & 757 & 19,019 & 20,009 & 2001 \\\\\n1858-59 & 67,027 & 70,308 & 69,945 & 4352 & 2281 & 672 & 19,857 & 20,928 & 2529 \\\\\n1859-60 & 67,137 & 70,308 & 69,945 & 4352 & 1777 & 672 & 19,857 & 20,928 & 2493 \\\\\n1860-61 & 67,760 & 70,538 & 70,180 & 3808 & 1611 & 610 & 19,774 & 20,764 & 3164 \\\\\n1861-62 & 69,819 & 71,345 & 70,998 & 2011 & 1068 & 1370 & 19,695 & 20,491 & 5210 \\\\\n1862-63 & 70,383 & 71,540 & 71,199 & 1465 & 890 & 1565 & 19,676 & 20,468 & 5255 \\\\\n1863-64 & 70,826 & 71,699 & 71,359 & 1071 & 760 & 1331 & 19,670 & 20,435 & 5242 \\\\\n1864-65 & 70,763 & 71,575 & 71,473 & 986 & 740 & 1652 & 19,666 & 20,591 & 5693 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\(^3\\) Captain W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. 300 of 27th January 1859.\nThe former survey measurements seem to have been incorrect. The new survey recorded 276,760 acres of occupied Government land and 23,376 acres of arable waste that is upwards of 100,000 acres of occupied land more than were shown in the former accounts. As the former survey showed only 8098 acres of arable waste it followed that it had shown as unarable nearly 100,000 acres of land which had since been occupied. The 105 Khat\u00e1v villages were arranged in six classes with highest dry crop acre rates varying from 3s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00bd) to 2s. (Re.1). One rupee was taken as the highest dry crop acre rate for the villages in the extreme east of Khat\u00e1v bordering on Pandharpur. Then passing west the villages were divided into five more classes with an increasing rate in each class to meet the increasing advantages of climate and markets. The whole group had over 8500 acres of garden land most of which was given to wheat and vegetables. The old garden rates were very variable and on the average were high. The new garden acre rates varied from 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) in the first class to 4s. (Rs. 2) in the sixth class, the average gradually increasing in the intermediate classes. The new garden rates were estimated to effect a reduction of fifteen to twenty per cent. The general estimated result of the new settlement was a survey total or kam\u00e1l of \u00a310,726 (Rs. 1,07,260). Of these, making due deduction for possible unoccupied waste, \u00a310,200 (Rs. 1,02,000) were considered to be realizable against \u00a38826 (Rs. 88,260) the average collections of the five previous years.

The first and second classes show a considerable reduction. In many of these villages the old rates were excessively high, particularly on the garden land whose average acre rate was above 14s. (Rs. 7) in five villages of the first class and in three villages of the second class. The villages of the last four classes showed an increase of revenue under the new rates. These had much poor soil which was not brought to account by the former survey, and was held at rates lower even than the grazing was worth. The same state of things had been found in Pandharpur and in the N\u00e1teputa petty division of Khat\u00e1v where the new rates had greatly increased the revenue without causing dissatisfaction. The survey rates proposed for Khat\u00e1v were sanctioned by Government in February 1859.\n\nIn the same year (1858-59), along with Khat\u00e1v, the survey settlement was introduced into the M\u00e1yni petty division of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. These thirty-seven M\u00e1yni villages lay close to the south of the western half of Khat\u00e1v, with which they corresponded in climate and character. They were fairly placed as regards markets. The large markets of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kar\u00e1d were both easily reached by made roads. Puses\u00e1vli, one of the villages in the group, had a good market and other minor markets were available. During the eleven years ending 1857-58 in the M\u00e1yni petty division tillage fell from 59,153 acres in 1847-48 to 57,809 acres in 1857-58, collections from \u00a34270 (Rs. 42,700) to \u00a33721 (Rs. 37,210), and remissions had risen from \u00a3118 (Rs. 1180) to \u00a3459 (Rs. 4590).

The fifteen eastern villages of M\u00e1yni corresponded with those of the third class in Khat\u00e1v and were assessed at a highest dry-crop acre rate of 2s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00be); the nineteen central villages corresponding with those of the second class were assessed at 3s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bd); and the two western villages corresponding with those of the first class were assessed at 3s. 9d. (Rs. 1\u00be). The first class had only two villages because most of the villages of that part were alienated. The whole group had over 3800 acres of garden land. The average garden acre rates were estimated at 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) in first class villages, 5s. 6d. (Rs. 2\u00be).\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 652 of 22nd February 1859.

It was thought that a fall in garden rates would help to reconcile the people to the rise in the dry crop land assessment.

Koregaon lay to the west of and below the Vardhangad-Machindragad hills which running north and south separate the valley of the Krishna from the valley of the Yerla and its feeders. This line of hills divided Koregaon from Khat\u00e1v which had been settled in the previous year. Koregaon was about thirty miles from north to south, and varied in breadth from eighteen miles in the north to ten in the south. The climate was exceedingly good; the rainfall as a rule was ample and certain, decidedly better than in the sub-divisions beyond its eastern hills. The western villages had probably some small advantage in rain over the eastern villages. In one year the better soils without watering commonly yielded two crops. The produce of Koregaon was the same as is ordinarily found in first class dry crop lands j\u00e9\u00e1ri, b\u00e1jri, wheat, gram, and oil-seeds. Very little cotton was grown; the climate and much of the soil was suitable, but other crops paid better. 3773 acres were under garden tillage watered chiefly by watercourses or p\u00e1ts fed by small streams of which the sub-division was full. The chief garden crops were garden wheat, groundnut, and vegetables. The Koregaon subdivision was exceedingly well placed for markets. In this respect the western villages had an advantage being four to ten miles east of the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra which was an excellent market for every sort of field produce. In the south was the large market town of Rahimatpur in the centre of Koregaon, and in the north Deur. Other smaller markets were in and near the sub-division. The north-western villages were within ten miles of the large market town of W\u00e1i, but a high range of hills prevented cart communication. The sub-division was also exceedingly well supplied with means of communication by excellent well-made roads which were open for traffic at all times of the year. The Belgaum-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road passed by T\u00e1rgaon through the south of the sub-division; the direct road\n\n---\n\n1 This M\u00e1yni survey settlement was sanctioned by Government in Letter 652 of 22nd February 1859. The direct levies (Rs. 940) hitherto collected by the village officers were abolished and absorbed by the survey assessment.\nfrom Belgaum to Poona which connected the Belgaum-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra line with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Poona line avoiding the turn by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, passed nearly north and south through the centre of the sub-division; the Pandharpur-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road passed east and west through the centre of the sub-division; the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Poona road passed through the north-west; and the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-W\u00e1i road passed through the extreme north-western villages. A few weavers both of cotton cloth and of blankets were scattered in the different villages. But the manufactures were of no importance. The Koregaon subdivision had thus an excellent climate, good markets, and abundant means of communication with distant as well as with local centres of trade.\n\nAt the time of the survey settlement the average rates of assessment were decidedly high, and, from their extreme inequality, pressed severely on a large section of the landholders. L\u00e1vni tota or permanent reduction from the standard assessment had been much more sparingly granted in the villages near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra than in the eastern villages. Remissions had been small and given less sparingly in later years than formerly; and the average dry crop rates on the lands of entire villages frequently ran as high as 8s. (Rs. 4). The acre rates on the entire garden lands of some villages averaged as much as 18s. (Rs. 9). It was not surprising that the people were largely in debt. The land revenue could not have been paid entirely from the land. Large numbers of carts were owned in the sub-division, and were engaged in the carrying trade to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and between Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Much money had also come into Koregaon from wages earned in working on the railway in the Poona district. In the opinion of Mr. Price, the Assistant Superintendent of Survey, without these advantages the people instead of taking fresh land must have been forced to part with what they held.\n\nDuring the twelve years ending 1858-59 tillage in Koregaon had fallen from 63,489 acres in 1847-48 to 60,428 acres in 1855-56 and again risen to 62,991 acres in 1858-59; collections had fallen from \u00a314,625 (Rs. 1,46,250) in 1847-48 to \u00a312,617 (Rs. 1,26,170) in 1849-50 and again risen to \u00a314,953 (Rs. 1,49,530) in 1858-59; and remissions had risen from \u00a3643 (Rs. 6430) in 1847-48 to \u00a32625 (Rs. 26,250) in 1849-50 and again fallen to \u00a3362 (Rs. 3620) in 1858-59.

S. Price, Assist. Supt. of Survey, 12th December 1859.\nThe statement shows that a stricter system began to be introduced in 1854-55 under which remissions fell from about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) to about \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000). Under the survey settlement the seventy-three Koregaon villages were arranged in three classes with highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 6s. to 5s. (Rs. 3 - 2\u00bd). The first class villages in the west of the subdivision had some advantage over the rest in climate and in markets; the third class villages in the east and north-east had the worst climate and the poorest markets. The second class villages were intermediate between those of the first and third classes. The rates in the first and second classes were higher than the officers of the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country survey had ever imposed, but the survey had never been introduced in any sub-division with such extraordinary natural and acquired advantages. For garden lands the highest acre rates proposed by the survey were 13s. (Rs. 6\u00bd) for the first class, 12s. (Rs. 6) for the second class, and 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) for the third class. The average garden acre rate was estimated at 8s. (Rs. 4). On the tillage of 1858-59 the survey rates showed a fall from \u00a314,953 (Rs. 1,49,530) to \u00a313,695 (Rs. 1,36,950) or eight per cent.

This group of fifty-six Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur villages lay immediately south of the M\u00e1yni mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur which had been settled in 1858-59. The Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur group was bounded on the south by alienated or private villages mixed with the lands of Athni in Belgaum and T\u00e1sgaon then in Belgaum and now in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. On the west the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-division was separated from Kar\u00e1d and T\u00e1rgaon by the continuation of the line of hills which divided Koregaon from Khat\u00e1v. The Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur group of fifty-six villages covered about forty miles in extreme length from east to west with a breadth from north to south varying from ten to eighteen miles. The rainfall dwindled from west to east and was much more ample and certain in the western villages than in the eastern. The crops\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 395 of 28th January 1860; the Surv. Supt. Capt. W. C. Anderson\u2019s Report 19 of 12th January 1860.\nboth dry and garden were like those of Koregaon. Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur had several small markets within its limits, but the chief mart was the large trading town of Kar\u00e1d about ten miles to the west. The made road from Bij\u00e1pur to the coast, by the lately opened Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed pass, ran east to west through the south of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. The road from Belgaum to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by T\u00e1sgaon also ran through the west of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur survey group from south to north. In roads and markets the western villages had a decided advantage over the rest of the group. A few weavers were scattered through the different villages, but there was no manufacturing town. The bulk of the people seemed fairly off, certainly much freer from debt than in Koregaon.\n\nDuring the twelve years ending 1858-59 Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur tillage had varied little. The area in 1847-48 was 67,253 acres and in 1858-59 67,298 acres, the least was 65,307 acres in 1855-56, and the average was 66,503 acres; collections were \u00a36636 (Rs. 66,360) in 1847-48 and \u00a36739 (Rs. 67,390) in 1858-59, the lowest was \u00a34628 (Rs. 46,280) in 1853-54, and the average \u00a35799 (Rs. 57,990); and remissions had varied from \u00a31985 (Rs. 19,850) in 1849-50 to nothing in 1858-59 and averaged \u00a3824 (Rs. 8240).

The average rates of assessment in many villages were low, and were moderate in all except those in the west. Everywhere great inequalities were common and might be removed to the gain rather than to the loss of revenue. The survey divided the fifty-six Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur villages into four classes according to their distance to the west which carried with it good climate and good markets. The highest dry crop acre rates proposed were 4s., 3s. 6d., 3s. \u00bdd., and 2s. 9d. (Rs. 2, Rs. 1\u00be, Rs. 1\u00bd, and Rs. 1\u00bd). In 4304 acres of garden land the highest rates proposed were 10s. and 9s. (Rs. 5 and Rs. 4\u00bd) for the first and second classes, and 8s. and 7s. 6d. (Rs. 4 and Rs. 3\u00bd) for the third and fourth classes. As much of the garden land was poor the average garden rate was estimated at 5s. 6d. (Rs. 2\u00bd). The effect of the survey was in the seventeen first class villages to lower the assessment on the 1858-59 tillage.\n\n1 Capt. W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. 19 of 12th January 1860.\nfrom \u00a31947 (Rs. 19,470) to \u00a31639 (Rs. 16,390); in the nineteen second class villages the effect was to raise the revenue from \u00a32334 (Rs. 23,340) to \u00a32524 (Rs. 25,240); in the thirteen third class villages to raise the revenue from \u00a31954 (Rs. 19,540) to \u00a32016 (Rs. 20,160); and in the seven fourth class villages to raise the revenue from \u00a3504 (Rs. 5040) to \u00a3564 (Rs. 5640). Over the whole fifty-six villages the effect was a slight increase from \u00a36739 (Rs. 67,390) to \u00a36743 (Rs. 67,430).

W\u00e1i included 103 villages, seventy-four of which were under a m\u00e1latd\u00e1r and twenty-nine under a mah\u00e1lkari. The m\u00e1latd\u00e1r's charge was entirely above the S\u00e1lpi range of hills. It was bounded on the north by the Bhor state, on the east by Koregaon, on the south and south-west by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and J\u00e1lvi, and on the west by the villages under the Superintendent of Mah\u00e1baleshvar which, except in a few cases, came between the W\u00e1i villages and the crest of the hills. The mah\u00e1lkari's villages were in the valley of the Nira in the extreme north. They were divided from Poona by the Nira and from the rest of W\u00e1i by the east and west running S\u00e1lpi or K\u00e1matk\u00ed spur. On the west this group was bounded by the villages of the Pant Sachiv and on the east by the villages of the chief of Phaltan. The two W\u00e1i groups differed much in climate. In the mah\u00e1lkari's eastern villages along the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Poona road between the S\u00e1lpi hills and the Nira bridge the rainfall was light and somewhat uncertain. With almost every mile westwards along the banks of the Nira the rainfall became more favourable, till in the western villages near Shirval on the Poona-Mah\u00e1baleshvar road the fall was ample. There was also much variety in the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r's villages. Those of the main sub-division to the east, south-east, and south of W\u00e1i were considered first class dry crop villages having as good a climate and as certain a rainfall as anywhere. To the west nearer the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hills the rainfall rapidly became heavier, and in the villages close under the hills was too heavy for any but inferior dry crops, and the\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 395 of 28th January 1860; the Surv. Supt. Capt. W. C. Anderson's Report 19 of 12th January 1860.\nhill side villages and hill top villages had little continuous tillage. The inferior grains n\u00e1chn\u00ed s\u00e1va and vari, which formed the staple food of the hill people, were grown on the hill sides without the help of the plough, one spot being cropped for two or perhaps three years and then left fallow to recover for three to eight years. Some rice was grown in W\u00e1i especially close to the hills. In the east jv\u00e1ri b\u00e1jri gram and the other crops common to superior dry crop districts thrived well. Nearer the hills the rainfall became too heavy for superior dry crop tillage and almost the only dry crops grown were the hill grains n\u00e1chn\u00ed, vari, and s\u00e1va. Especially near W\u00e1i the villages in the east and south-east of the m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00e1r\u2019s division had a good deal of garden land. The garden land was partly watered by wells but chiefly by water-courses or p\u00e1ts led from streams or n\u00e1l\u00e1s, many of which ran all the year. A good deal of sugarcane was grown. Its juice was made into gul or raw sugar which was readily sold in the town of W\u00e1i or sent to Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The better soils without the help of water commonly yielded two crops in one year.\n\nThe sub-division was well off for markets. Besides the large town of W\u00e1i in the centre where a daily market was held, within the sub-division were minor markets, and beyond the borders were Phaltan, Bhor, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and Malcolmpeeth or Mah\u00e1baleshvar. A good made road ran from W\u00e1i to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the road from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Poona which ran along the western edge of the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division gave the villages of that part ready communication with large markets. A made road with a good slope but almost too narrow for carts ran from W\u00e1i to Mah\u00e1baleshvar up the Pasarni pass. From W\u00e1i a bullock cart track by the K\u00e1matki pass and Shirval led about forty-five miles to Poona. The western villages of the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division had no made road near them. Except a little scattered hand-loom weaving tillage was the only industry. W\u00e1i, with about 11,000 people, was the only place of importance in the sub-division. It was a favourite residence for Br\u00e1hmans and other men of means and was a good market for local field produce. In the eastern villages the husbandry was decidedly good and the people on the whole were fairly off. Though not uncommon debt was by no means general. In the hill villages the people were as well probably better off than in most hill districts as their produce found a ready sale in the large market of Malcolmpeeth.\n\nCaptain Adams had surveyed the whole subdivision about 1820 and since 1823-24 his areas had formed the basis of the accounts. Still, under the R\u00e1j\u00e1s\u2019 rule and up to the survey settlement, the ancient rates of assessment remained in force. The chief change had been the introduction of l\u00e1vni tota or permanent reductions which were largely granted by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, though less freely in the west near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra than in the east. In W\u00e1i as in Koregaon the average assessment was high and the pressure was aggravated by extreme inequality. It was the R\u00e1j\u00e1s\u2019 principle to exact the last rupee from good soil and well favoured districts and to give poor land and dry districts at an almost nominal assessment. A common result was that good land passed out of tillage and the people were forced to work the poorer soils. In\nmany villages dry crop acre rates of 8s. or 10s. (Rs. 4 or Rs. 5) were common. In garden land the rates were specially high and unequal. In several villages the garden acre rates for the whole village averaged \u00a31 4s. and \u00a31 8s. (Rs. 12 and Rs. 14), and average rates of 14s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 7 - 10) were common. In other villages the average garden acre rate was only 4s. to 10s. (Rs. 2 - 5). As every village had a share of poor garden land so high an average could not be kept up without trenching on legitimate profits. During the thirteen years ending 1859-60 tillage in W\u00e1i had varied from 79,757 acres in 1854-55 to 36,970 in 1859-60 and averaged 83,730; collections from \u00a37814 (Rs. 78,140) in 1853-54 to \u00a310,531 (Rs. 105,310) in 1858-59 and averaged \u00a39334 (Rs. 93,340); and remissions from \u00a3213 (Rs. 2130) in 1858-59 to \u00a32076 (Rs. 20,760) in 1850-51 and averaged \u00a31045 (Rs. 10,450).

The measuring of W\u00e1i was begun in the end of 1855-56 when a spread of tillage set in and continued steadily. This spread in tillage like the fall in remission was apparently chiefly due to a rise in the price of grain. From 1847-48 to 1854-55 the average yearly collections were \u00a38920 (Rs. 89,200), and from 1855-56 to 1859-60 they were \u00a39996 (Rs. 99,960), that is an increase of \u00a31076 (Rs. 10,760) or twelve per cent. In W\u00e1i as in other parts of the district considerable areas were taxed at needlessly light rates. In many cases also the rates were unduly high. The rates wanted levelling rather than lowering.\n\nThe twenty-nine villages in the mah\u00e1lkari's charge were arranged in four classes with highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 4s. 3d. to 2s. 9d. (Rs. 2\u00bd to Rs. 1\u00be). The first class included the extreme\n\n---\n\n1 The acres were obtained by turning Capt. Adams' bigh\u00e1s into acres at 36 gunth\u00e1s to a bigh\u00e1.\n2 Capt. W.

The second\nand third class villages lay between the first and fourth classes.\nThe m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's seventy-four villages were arranged in six classes\nwith highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 6s. to 2s. (Rs. 3 -\nRe. 1). The first class comprised the villages in the east of the\nsub-division which were the best dry-crop villages with ample but\nnot excessive rainfall. The second third and fourth classes pro-\nceeded in regular order westward, the rainfall becoming too heavy\nfor the best dry-crop tillage and the villages more outlying and cut\noff from markets. The fifth and sixth classes comprised villages at\nthe tops of valleys between the spurs of hills and on hill sides and\nhill tops. These hill villages had three kinds of dry-crop land;\njir\u00e1yat steadily tilled year after year, of which many villages had\nlittle or none; t\u00eds\u00e1li land cropped for three years and then fallowed\nfor one to three or four years; and dali or kumri lands cropped two\nor sometimes three years and then left fallow for six to ten years.\nOn the t\u00eds\u00e1li and kumri a scale of rates headed by one rupee was\nproposed, but the highest acre rates actually levied were 4\u00bdd. (3 as.)\nfor kumri and 9d. (6 as.) for t\u00eds\u00e1li land. On the jir\u00e1yat or con-\ntinuously tilled lands of the fifth and sixth classes the highest rates\nproposed were 2s. 3d. and 2s. (Rs. 1\u00bd and Re.1). As in these hill\nvillages the old assessment was shown in the lump on each holding,\nno detailed comparison could be made between the former rates\nand the new rates.\n\nThe reason for the unusual number of groups and rates of assess-\nment was the variety in the tillage of the sub-division from the best\ndry crop to nearly the worst hill land. The following statement\nshows the different groups with their respective rates:\n\n**W\u0101i Survey Rates, 1860-61.**\n\n| Division | Class | Villages | Highest Dry-Crop Acre Rate | Average Garden Rate | Highest Rate | Average Rate |\n|----------|-------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Mah\u0101lkari's Charge. | I | 7 | Rs. a. 2 2 | Rs. a. 3 8 | Rs. a. 3 3 9 |\n| II | 9 | 1 14 | 3 8 | ... | ... |\n| III | 5 | 1 10 | 3 0 | ... | ... |\n| IV | 8 | 1 6 | 2 12 | ... | ... |\n| M\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's Charge. | I | 20 | 3 0 | 5 8 | 10 2 12 5 |\n| II | 10 | 2 10 | 5 0 | 8 | 5 5 7 |\n| III | 4 | 2 6 | 4 0 | 8 | 3 13 10 |\n| IV | 2 | 2 3 | 4 0 | 8 | 4 11 6 |\n| V | 23 | Hill Villages. | ... | 7 | 7 2 12 9 |\n| VI | 0 | ... | ... | 6 | 4 6 3 |\n\nThe effect of the survey was to lower the rental from \u00a310,437\n(Rs. 1,04,370) to \u00a39528 (Rs. 95,280) or about nine per cent. The\ndetails are:\nThe proposed rates were sanctioned by Government in February 1861.\n\nIn 1861-62 the survey settlement was introduced in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division of 101 villages. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was bounded on the west by the great range which runs parallel to the main crest of the Sahy\u00e1dris, separated from it by the Koyna valley; on the north by a range of hills separating it from Koregaon and the Kud\u00e1l valley; on the east by the Krishna; and on the south by a spur which separated it from T\u00e1rgaon. The sub-division consisted of two valleys, that of the Yenna or Vena on the north and that of the Urmodi or Parli river on the south of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort range. Both these rivers were feeders of the Krishna and their valleys merged into the Krishna valley whose course formed the eastern boundary of the sub-division. Throughout the eastern half of the sub-division the climate was exceedingly favourable to agriculture, the supply both of the early and of the later rains was in general ample and certain, and in most seasons all good dry-crop soils yielded two harvests. Towards the west the rainfall became heavier, till in the hill villages at the head of the Parli valley continuous dry-crop tillage almost entirely gave way to n\u00e1chn\u00ed and rice. In the centre and east the dry-crop tillage was excellent. A considerable area of garden land was watered by wells and channels or p\u00e1s in the centre and east and almost exclusively by channels in the west. Most parts of the subdivision were well off for made roads. The road from Belgaum by T\u00e1sgaon, after crossing the Krishna, ran up the Yenna valley to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the road from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Mah\u00e1baleshvar also ran up the Yenna valley. Three other made roads crossed the north of the subdivision, from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to W\u00e1i, to Poona, and to Pandharpur, of which all and especially the Poona road were much used. In the south the Parli valley was crossed by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Kolhapur road. The villages towards the head of the Parli valley were the only villages in the sub-division which were badly off for communications. Still even this tract was in no place more than twelve miles from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in a direct line. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division was exceedingly well off for\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 867 of 20th Feb. 1861; Survey Superintendent, 55 of 22nd January 1861 and 67 of 31st January 1861.\nmarkets. The town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra supplied an unfailing demand for every form of local field produce. There were also minor markets in and near the sub-division. The heavy traffic on the trunk roads created an enormous demand for grain especially for cattle fodder.\n\nOn the whole the people were well-to-do. There was a good deal of debt. Still, even where the rates pressed heaviest, landholders were able to eke out a living by carting or by labour in Bombay during the fair months. During the fourteen years ending 1860-61 tillage\\(^1\\) in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra varied from 40,201 acres in 1852-53 to 46,740 in 1860-61 and averaged 43,643; collections from \u00a37116 (Rs. 71,160) in 1853-54 to \u00a39188 (Rs. 91,880) in 1860-61 and averaged \u00a38577 (Rs. 85,770); and remissions from \u00a3123 (Rs. 1,230) in 1858-59 to \u00a31993 (Rs. 19,930) in 1853-54 and averaged \u00a3672 (Rs. 6,720).

(Rs. 5\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)) in Gojegaon, 7s. 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (Rs. 3\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)) in Nisral, 6s. 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (Rs. 3\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)) in Chinchner, and 7s. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (Rs. 3\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)) in Ang\u00e1pur. All of these villages contained a large proportion of poor soil, so that without some special help these rates could not have been realised. The explanation was that the government lands in these villages had been excessively taxed under the R\u00e1j\u00e1s to make up for the large area of quit-rent or rent-free land which the villages contained. The same practice existed in many Kar\u00e1d villages. In some cases it was stated that no one was allowed to till alienated land unless he held a certain portion of heavily assessed government land. The in\u00e1md\u00fars would be greatly benefited by fixing the assessment of the Government land on a just standard.\\(^2\\) Survey rates correspond-\n\n---\n\n1 The acres were found by turning Capt.

The villages to the east and as far as a little to the west of a north and south line running through S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were placed in the first class. Thence to the west the highest rate decreased as the rainfall became more and more excessive and the villages less accessible. In the hill villages where all tillage was broken by fallows the dry-crop rates were much lower than anywhere else. The plain villages were arranged in five classes and the hill villages in two classes. Of the seven classes, the first included all the eastern or plain portion of the sub-division and nearly all the highly assessed villages. In the remaining villages the existing assessment was generally moderate and sometimes low. Everywhere the existing rates on rich soils were out of proportion heavier than those on poor soils which were often given at nominal rates. The following statement shows the different classes and their highest rates of assessment:\n\n**S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Survey Rates, 1861-62.**\n\n| Class | Villages | Highest Dry-crop Acre Rate | Average Garden Rate | Rice Land |\n|-------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n|       |          | Rs. a.                    | Rs. a.              | Rs. a. p. |\n| I     | 44       | 3 0                       | 5 14                | 3 7 8     |\n| II    | 12       | 2 10                      |                     | 4 4 5     |\n| III   | 10       | 2 6                       | 4 8                 | 4 5 4     |\n| IV    | 7        | 2 2                       |                     | 4 11      |\n| V     | 7        | 1 4                       | 4 0                 | 4 11      |\n| VI    | 11 Hill Villages | 1 0                   | 3 0                 | 4 10      |\n| VII   | 10 Lages |                         |                     |           |\n\nOn the tillage of 1860-61 the survey rates showed a fall from \u00a39188 to \u00a38593 (Rs. 91,880 - Rs. 85,930) or 6\u00b75 per cent.

Instead of two hill classes Government made one class assessed at a highest dry-crop acre rate of 2s. (Re. 1).\n\nIn 1861-62 the survey settlement was introduced into the J\u00e1vli sub-division. J\u00e1vli included three distinct sections: The Kud\u00e1l\n\n---\n\n1 Government Letter 1843 of 8th May 1862; Major W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. 553 of 24th December 1861.\n2 A group of 37 villages settled in 1855-59 and included in Mah\u00e1baleshvar was excluded from this settlement.\nvalley; the Medha valley up which the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Mah\u00e1baleshvar road ran; and the upper Koyna valley and a portion of the tableland on each side of the Koyna river. The Kud\u00e1l and Medha valleys ran from west to east, and the Koyna valley from north to south parallel with the Sahy\u00e1dris. The three J\u00e1vli valleys started from the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau and were separated by spurs branching from it. Near the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau the tablelands on their tops broadened till they held many villages. Every variety of climate occurred within J\u00e1vli limits. In the extreme east of the Kud\u00e1l valley near the W\u00e1i-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road the rains were light enough to admit of first class dry-crop tillage, while in the Mah\u00e1baleshvar villages the fall of rain varied from about 150 to 370 inches. In the Mah\u00e1baleshvar villages nothing could grow but hill grains or rice, and even they failed if planted before the first violence of the monsoon was over. In the eastern villages both of the Medha and of the Kud\u00e1l valleys especially in the Kud\u00e1l villages the rainfall was sufficiently moderate to allow of high dry-crop tillage and the better soils without the help of water yielded two crops in the year. Up the western valleys the better dry-crops such as j\u00e9v\u00e1ri became less common and at last at the head of the valleys and in the hills most of the land was cropped for two or three years and then left fallow for three to six years. N\u00e1chmi, vari, and other hill grains formed the staple dry crops. In the patches of good land capable of continuous tillage a little barley and wheat were raised. Rice was the staple crop in all these villages and in some villages considerable quantities of sugarcane were grown.\n\nAll J\u00e1vli hill villages were well off for markets. The large market of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was within easy reach of the east end of the Medha valley and the large market of W\u00e1i was within easy reach of the Kud\u00e1l valley, and the station of Mah\u00e1baleshvar absorbed all the marketable produce of the hill villages which, excepting the extreme southern villages on the Koyna, were all within twelve or fourteen miles of Malcolmtpeth. These villages were also within a moderate distance of the tidal port of Chiplun in Ratn\u00e1giri from which all sorts of produce went by sea to Bombay. Chiplun was reached by bullock tracks down the Sahy\u00e1dris. The people of the hill villages were therefore much better off than most hill people. They had a ready market for all produce, also for grass, wood, bamboos, and other house building materials. The station of Mah\u00e1baleshvar created a large demand for high paid labour for several months in the year. A considerable bullock traffic between the plains and the port of Mah\u00e1d also moved up the Medha and Kud\u00e1l valleys by the Kelgad and T\u00e1i passes across the Mah\u00e1baleshvar range. This traffic caused a great demand for fodder. Till this survey settlement in all hill villages, even far down the Medha and Kud\u00e1l valleys, the revenue management was very rude. The lands of a village were generally divided among a certain number of persons, originally of one family and bearing one family name. The lands of each sharer were known to himself and to the other villagers, but there was no precise record of the situation of the lands of each in the accounts. Each person was debited with his share of the\nvillage revenue. The landholders whose names were entered in the accounts tilled part of their lands themselves and sublet parts to others on their own terms. In the Medha and Kud\u00e1l valleys where was much superior land the rates in neighbouring villages were very unequal. The villages were generally very small, and people living in one village often tilled in another and thus to some extent the heavy assessment of one village was counteracted by light assessment in a neighbouring village. In the hill villages the assessment was generally moderate. For several years before 1862, the revenue had not increased more than ten per cent while produce prices had nearly doubled. Within the four or five years ending 1862 the state of the people had greatly improved. This rise in prices had enabled the people to do almost entirely without remissions and to bring under tillage all but 923 acres of the arable land.\n\nDuring the fourteen years ending 1860-61 collections in J\u00e1vli had fallen from \u00a33850 (Rs. 38,500) in 1847-48 to \u00a32194 (Rs. 21,940) in 1853-54 and again risen to \u00a34158 (Rs. 41,580) in 1860-61; and remissions had risen from \u00a3233 (Rs. 2330) in 1847-48 to \u00a31695 (Rs. 16,950) in 1853-54 and again fallen to \u00a34 (Rs. 40) in 1860-61. The details are:\n\n| Year | Collections | Remissions | Reductions |\n|------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| 1847-48 | 38,500 | 2,328 | 6,692 |\n| 1848-49 | 36,516 | 4,137 | 9,940 |\n| 1849-50 | 37,644 | 3,157 | 8,686 |\n| 1850-51 | 35,895 | 3,605 | 6,735 |\n| 1851-52 | 38,031 | 1,460 | 6,710 |\n| 1852-53 | 36,990 | 2,133 | 7,231 |\n| 1853-54 | 31,948 | 16,851 | 7,094 |\n| 1854-55 | 36,131 | 3,125 | 7,159 |\n\nAverage | 36,389 | 3,549 | 6,690 |\n\nThe 141 villages were arranged in seven classes with highest dry-crop acre rates varying from 6s. to 2s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 3 - 1\u00bd). The survey rates proposed for J\u00e1vli were almost the same as those proposed for the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division. They began with a three-rupee highest dry-crop acre rate for the villages farthest east in the Kud\u00e1l valley close to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-W\u00e1i road and gradually became smaller towards the western hills. In the sixth and seventh class hill villages the rates both for dry-crop and rice land were slightly in excess over those proposed in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra hill villages, as the nearness of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and of Chiplun gave them a decided advantage as regards markets. Garden land was almost confined to the Kud\u00e1l and Medha valleys. The hill villages and the Koyna valley had very little garden land. For the J\u00e1vli garden lands the same rates were adopted as those proposed for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The following statement shows the number of villages and the survey rates proposed for each class:\n\n1 Survey Superintendent, 76 of 26th March 1862.\nChapter VIII.\n\nThe Land.\n\nSurvey.\n\nJ\u00e1vli, 1861-62.\n\n| Class | Villages | Highest Dry-Crop Acre Rate | Average Garden Rate | Rice Land |\n|-------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| I     | 8        | Rs. a. 3 0                | Rs. a. 5 4          | Rs. a. 9 0 |\n| II    | 6        | 2 10                      | 4 8                 | 5 0       |\n| III   | 14       | 2 6                       |                     |           |\n| IV    | 7        | 2 2                       |                     |           |\n| V     | 14       | 1 14                      |                     |           |\n| VI    | 73       | (a) 1 2                   |                     |           |\n| VII   | 19       | (a) 1 1                   |                     |           |\n\n(a) Hill villages and the Koyna valley.\n\nOn the tillage of 1860-61 the survey rates showed a fall from \u00a34158 to \u00a34002 (Rs. 41,580 - Rs. 40,020) or 3.7 per cent.

The T\u00e1rgaon survey group included fifty-five villages, forty-two in the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s division and thirteen in the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division. In position the T\u00e1rgaon sub-division corresponded with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division, except that it stretched a little farther east and west. It was bounded on the east by the line of hills which separated the Khat\u00e1v and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-divisions from those in the Krishna valley, Koregaon S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kar\u00e1d. On the west T\u00e1rgaon reached the main Sahy\u00e1dri range including the lower part of the Koyna valley, instead of, as was the case with S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, being bounded by the eastern or B\u00e1mnoli-Gher\u00e1d\u00e1tegad range, running parallel with the main crest of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, which formed the eastern boundary of the Koyna valley. The bulk of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs\u2019 villages were in the Krishna valley. Very few were in the side valleys between the spurs of the inner line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and of those which formed the eastern boundary of T\u00e1rgaon. The villages on these spurs to the west and in the valleys between them were nearly all alienated. The P\u00e1tankar alone held forty-three.\n\n---\n\n1 Government Letter 1842 of 8th May 1862; Major W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, 76 of 26th March 1862.\nThe mah\u00e1lkari's division included the lower part of the Koyna valley. The Koyna river ran north and south between the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dris and the parallel range as far as the mah\u00e1lkari's station of Helv\u00e1k where it was crossed by a fine bridge built in 1857. At Helv\u00e1k was a break in the eastern range and the river turned sharply to the east and flowed east to the Krishna at Kar\u00e1d about twelve miles east of the eastern limit of the Helv\u00e1k mah\u00e1lkari's charge. In the Krishna valley the rainfall, as a rule, was sufficient and certain, and the best dry crop cultivation flourished. On the superior soils in many cases two dry crops were grown in the same year. Further to the west the rains steadily became heavier and less favourable for superior dry crops, till, on the western border, the bulk of the dry crops were obtained from broken hill tillage.\n\nThe main road from Kolhapur to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra passed through the centre of the m\u00e1ml\u00e1dd\u00e1r's villages to the west of the Krishna. A parallel line of road from Kar\u00e1d by Masur joined at Masur the Pandharpur and Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road. The Pandharpur road went through Masur and then down the Cherigaon pass by Helv\u00e1k and the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass to Chiplun. Thus the valley of the Krishna and the valley of the Koyna after its easterly turn at Helv\u00e1k were well provided with roads to the large markets of Kar\u00e1d and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and also to the Ratn\u00e1giri port of Chiplun. N\u00e1chmi straw had a very considerable value near all made roads or bullock tracks which passed over the Sahy\u00e1dris at intervals of every few miles. The surplus produce of the Sahy\u00e1di villages went to the Konkan where was a ready market for all kinds of food. For some years before the survey (1857-1862) it had become common for men to leave their villages between the harvest and sowing season and go in search of labour to Bombay or Khand\u00e1l\u00e1. A few even went beyond sea, occasionally, in times of war, to China.\u00b9 The wives and families of absentees were supported in their villages on the produce of the preceding harvest. Even if the whole crop was used by the husbandman and his family without leaving any surplus for sale, the money earned by labour, after paying the assessment, provided what clothing or other articles were required or was spent in clearing debts incurred on marriage ceremonies.\u00b2 The land was well and carefully tilled and the people seemed well-to-do. There was some debt but high produce prices during the past six years and the opening of fresh markets by road-making had lightened the burden of heavy and uneven assessment. During the fourteen years ending 1860-61 tillage in T\u00e1rgaon varied from 50,368 acres in 1851-52 to 54,795 in 1860-61 and averaged 51,995; collections from \u00a37918 (Rs. 79,180) in 1851-52 to \u00a39384 (Rs. 93,840) in 1860-61 and averaged \u00a38660 (Rs. 86,600); and remissions from \u00a348 (Rs. 480) in 1860-61 to \u00a31258 (Rs. 12,580) in 1849-50 and averaged \u00a3590 (Rs. 5900). The details are:\n\n\u00b9 In 1861 Major Anderson, the Survey Superintendent, in one of the most out of the way parts of the Sahy\u00e1dris met a man who told him that for some months he had been in China with the Land Transport and had only left Tien Tsin 3\u00bd months before.\n\u00b2 Major W. C. Anderson, Survey Superintendent, 131 of 26th April 1862.\nThe fifty-five T\u00e1rgaon villages were arranged in six classes and charged highest dry crop acre rates which corresponded very closely with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra rates. The first class comprised all the villages in the centre of the Krishna valley, which were most favourably placed both as regards climate and communications. The second class included the villages immediately under the line of the B\u00e1mnuoli-Gher\u00e1d\u00e1tegad hills, that is the range parallel with the main crest of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. They were somewhat less favourably placed as regards nearness to lines of made road. This class also included the villages immediately to the west of the first class villages. The third fourth and fifth classes included villages further and further to the west, and the sixth class included three hill villages in the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s charge and thirteen hill villages in the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s charge. The reason why so few villages appeared in the second third fourth and fifth classes was that in the centre and west of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s charge most of the villages were private or in\u00e1m. The average garden land rates were a little higher in the first class than in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division because the average quality of the T\u00e1rgaon garden land was somewhat better than in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The highest rice land rates from the second class downwards were a fraction lower than in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The first four classes had only 153 acres of rice land. The assessment both of dry and of wet land in the sixth class or hill villages was considerably lower than that proposed for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and J\u00e1vli. The three hill villages in the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s division were out of the way places, and the thirteen hill villages in the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division were on the second range of hills to the south of the Koyna and the Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed pass road in the next valley to that of the Koyna in an inferior position to either the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra or the J\u00e1vli hill villages. The following statement shows the proposed survey rates for the different classes:\n\n| Class | Villages | Highest Dry-crop Acre Rate | Average Garden Rate | Rice Land |\n|-------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| I     | 24       | Rs. a.                    | Rs. a.              | Rs. a.    |\n| II    | 7        | 2 10                      | 5 0                 | 8 0       |\n| III   | 1        | 2 6                       | 4 8                 | 7 8       |\n| IV    | 2        | 2 2                       | 4 8                 | 7 0       |\n| V     | 5        | 1 14                      | 4 0                 | 7 0       |\n| VI    | 16       | 1 0                       | 2 8                 | 5 0       |\n\nThe survey showed that the former areas were about 20 per cent short of the actual measurements. Still the change in the tillage area from year to year is probably fairly accurate.\nOn the tillage of 1860-61 the survey rates showed a fall from \u00a39334 to \u00a38653 (Rs. 93,340 - Rs. 86,530) or seven per cent. The details are:\n\n| Class | Villages | Former | Survey |\n|-------|----------|--------|--------|\n|       |          | 1860-61 |        |\n| I...  | 24       | Rs. 71,720 | Rs. 64,600 |\n| II... | 7        | 14,233   | 13,093 |\n| III...| 1        | 1401     | 1435   |\n| IV... | 2        | 982      | 814    |\n| V...  | 5        | 1661     | 1875   |\n| VI... | 18       | 3236     | 3011   |\n| Total | 55       | 93,388   | 86,534 |\n\nThe new rates showed a large reduction in the first class villages. In five villages the average existing acre rate on the whole occupied dry crop lands was over 6s. (Rs. 3), and in three villages the average garden acre rate was over \u00a31 (Rs. 10). These excessive assessments could not be removed without some loss of revenue. In the second third fourth and fifth classes the old rates were much more moderate than in the first class, and there was little difference between the estimated gross collections of the existing and the new assessment. In the sixth class or hill villages a rise in the dry crop rates more than made up for a fall in the rice rates. The proposed survey rates for the T\u00e1rgaon villages were sanctioned by Government in May 1862.\n\nIn 1862-63 the survey settlement was introduced into the eighty-eight villages of the Kar\u00e1d subdivision and into the remaining fifty-three villages of the Helv\u00e1k petty division of T\u00e1rgaon the rest of which had been settled in the previous year. Kar\u00e1d was much like T\u00e1rgaon and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It lay immediately to the south of T\u00e1rgaon. On the east a range of hills separated it from Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. The town of Kar\u00e1d, a little to the south-east of the centre of the sub-division, was the sacred meeting of the nearly equal sized Krishna and Koyna. Kar\u00e1d consisted of three valleys; part of the Krishna valley whose main direction was north and south; the lower part of the Koyna valley running east and west; and to the south of the Koyna the entire valley of the Kola which passed west between the high spurs up to the interior range of the Sahy\u00e1dris. Most of the Krishna valley, the lower part of the Koyna valley, and the Kola valley, was the finest alluvial black soil, and the south-west rains were as certain as in T\u00e1rgaon and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Towards the west the rainfall increased, till, in the hill villages at the head of the Kola valley and on the tableland on the top of the\n\n---\n\n1 Government Letter 1841 of 8th May 1862; Major W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, 131 of 26th April 1862.\n2 At the time of the survey settlement these eighty-eight and fifty-three villages did not belong to Kar\u00e1d and Helv\u00e1k. In 1862 (Dec. 30) the Survey Superintendent wrote that though great changes had lately been made in the distribution of villages it was more convenient to deal with the groups by their old names than as parts of the different sub-divisions into which they had lately been redistributed.\nhills which bounded the Kola valley; the regular dry crops gave place to hill grains grown at intervals of three to six years of fallow. The dry crop tillage of the centre of the sub-division was excellent. Nearly all the villages had some garden land, the whole Government garden area amounting to 4684 acres. Sugarcane, tobacco, and other valuable crops were widely grown. The groundnut was also grown to a great extent, as, for some years before 1862, large quantities had been sent to Europe. Chiefly in the western villages were 1911 acres of Government rice land much of which yielded a second crop of wheat or pulse and occasional crops of sugarcane. Except in the Kola valley the Kar\u00e1d villages were well off for roads and markets. The great road from Belgaum and Kolhapur to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra ran through Kar\u00e1d along the right bank of the Krishna. From east to west, also through Kar\u00e1d, the sub-division was crossed by the inland road which passed westward up the left bank of the Koyna by the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass fifty-five miles from Kar\u00e1d to the tidal port of Chiplun in Ratn\u00e1giri. The traffic along these two trunk lines caused a great demand for every kind of fodder. Kar\u00e1d was a very large market and a place of considerable trade and other minor but useful local markets were scattered over the subdivision. Chiefly from the opening of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road and the very high produce prices which had prevailed for eight years before the introduction of the survey, though not without debt, the people were well-to-do. In the Koyna and Krishna valleys the fields were exceedingly well and carefully tilled and the people were prosperous. The people of the upper Kola valley, with excessive rainfall and long distances from markets, were much less well-to-do. During the fifteen years ending 1861-62 tillage in Kar\u00e1d varied from 71,790 acres in 1847-48 to 78,363 in 1860-61 and averaged 74,359; collections from \u00a314,712 (Rs. 1,47,120) in 1852-53 to \u00a318,581 (Rs. 1,85,810) in 1860-61 and averaged \u00a316,903 (Rs. 1,69,030); and remissions from \u00a325 (Rs. 250)\n\n---\n\n1 Kar\u00e1d Survey Report, 466 of 30th Dec. 1862.

During 1855-56 and 1856-57 there was a large local expenditure on public works. Both the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road and the cleared road from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Kolhapur were being made and gave full and well paid employment to the labouring classes. The opening of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road was a great source of wealth to the sub-division.\n\nThough Kar\u00e1d had greatly improved during the six years before the survey settlement, the inequalities of the old assessment pressed heavily both on individual holdings and on entire villages. In many cases the extremely high rates of assessment were in practice less burdensome than they appeared. As in other parts of the district the excessive rates were confined to villages with a large area of alienated land. The rule was enforced that no man should till alienated land who did not hold some over-assessed Government land. By this means the proprietors or alienees of rent-free or quit-rent lands, in order to get their lands tilled, had to content themselves with something less than their natural rental because without this concession the holders of over-assessed Government land could not afford to till the alienated land. By this means some additional revenue was indirectly recovered from the holders of rent-free or quit-rent land.\n\nUnder the survey settlement the eighty-eight Kar\u00e1d villages were arranged in six classes and charged highest dry crop acre rates of 6s. to 2s. (Rs. 3-1). The first class contained the villages in the valley of the Krishna and the lower Koyna and Kola valleys near their meeting with the Krishna. They had a moderate and certain supply of rain and were well placed for roads and markets. The second third and fourth classes included the less accessible Koyna\n\n---\n\n1 Major W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country, 466 of 30th December 1862.\n2 For Kar\u00e1d the Survey Superintendent proposed to adopt a grouping of villages and rates of assessment the same as those adopted for the neighbouring sub-division of T\u00e1rgaon, which were very similar to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra rates and differed little from those of W\u00e1i. He was unwilling to fix a higher basis for the rates because he doubted whether the recent great rise in produce prices would last. Major Anderson, Survey Supt.

The second class also included the villages to the east under and among the spurs of the hills to the east of the Krishna valley. The fifth class included the villages at the head of the Kola valley, and the sixth class the hill villages on the slopes and tops of the hills enclosing the Kola valley.\n\nThe following statement shows the survey rates proposed for the Kar\u00e1d villages:\n\n**Kar\u00e1d Survey Rates, 1862-63.**\n\n| Class | Villages | Highest Dry Crop Acre Rate | Highest Rice and Garden Acre Rate |\n|-------|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| I     | 41       | Rs. 3 0                   | Rs. 9                             |\n| II    | 12       | Rs. 2 10                  | Rs. 8                             |\n| III   | 11       | Rs. 2 6                   | Rs. 7\u00bd                            |\n| IV    | 8        | Rs. 2 2                   | Rs. 7                             |\n| V     | 8        | Rs. 1 14                  | Rs. 7                             |\n| VI    | 8 (a)    | Rs. 1 0                   | Rs. 5                             |\n\n(a) Hill villages.\n\nThe central first class villages were those where the existing assessment ranged highest, and where the practice of over-assessing government land in the occupation of holders of alienated lands had been commonest. In some of these villages the average existing dry-crop acre rate for the whole village was over 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd). On garden land 16s. (Rs. 8) was a common acre rate and in some villages the average acre rate was as high as \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12). In the second class the existing assessment was extremely variable, very high in some villages and very low in others. The general result of the survey rates was a slight increase. In the third class villages most of which were high in the Kola valley the existing rates were little lower than in the Krishna valley villages. Before the days of roads the difference between the value of the lands of these two classes may have been small, under present condition the difference was great. The fourth and fifth classes comprised the villages farther up the Kola valley and the sixth class the hill villages. For the sixth class 2s. (Re. 1) was proposed as the highest dry-crop acre rate but the small area of land which was continuously culturable could alone bear this rate. In pure hill lands whose terms of tillage were separated by five or six years of fallow the survey acre rate ranged from 3\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (2-3 as.). The general result of the whole proposed settlement was a reduction of eleven per cent on the collections of the previous year.\n\nThe details are:\n\n**Kar\u00e1d Survey Settlement, 1862-63.**\n\n| Class | Villages | Former | Survey |\n|-------|----------|--------|--------|\n|       |          | 1861-62 | 1861-62 | Waste | Total |\n| Rs.   | Rs.      | Rs.    | Rs.    | Rs.   |\n| I     | 41       | 1,34,354 | 1,08,326 | 5576 | 1,18,908 |\n| II    | 12       | 22,925  | 26,850  | 1891 | 28,581  |\n| III   | 11       | 18,492  | 14,778  | 1,114 | 15,892  |\n| IV    | 8        | 6886    | 5062    | 351  | 5438    |\n| V     | 8        | 8037    | 7697    | 275  | 7972    |\n| VI    | 8        | 2167    | 2578    | 253  | 2831    |\n| Total | 88       | 1,85,762 | 1,65,297 | 8664 | 1,73,961 |\nIn 1862-63 along with Kar\u00e1d the survey settlement was introduced into the remaining fifty-three villages of the petty division of Helv\u00e1k in T\u00e1rgaon, into the rest of which survey rates had been introduced in the previous year. Most of these fifty-three villages were near the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. They had not been settled in the previous year because their classification could not be completed in time. All were in the Koyna valley or on the hills by which the Koyna valley was bounded. They joined the Kar\u00e1d portion of the Koyna valley. Along the part of the valley, below the sharp bend from south to east which the Koyna takes at Helv\u00e1k, along the Koyna\u2019s left bank ran the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road. The heavy traffic along this road gave the villages of this section a marked advantage over the villages in the upper part of the valley. This survey group had 1171 acres of Government rice land and 190 acres of Government garden land. In most villages the bulk of the tillage was of hill lands which required fallows. The condition of the people was much the same as in Kar\u00e1d. In the lower Koyna villages they were well-to-do, in the upper hill tracts they were poor.\n\nDuring the fifteen years ending 1861-62 tillage in Helv\u00e1k had varied from 31,492 acres in 1855-56 to 32,364 in 1847-48 and averaged 31,951; collections from \u00a3702 (Rs. 7020) in 1853-54 to \u00a31100 (Rs. 11,000) in 1847-48 and averaged \u00a31049 (Rs. 10,490), and remissions from \u00a3402 (Rs. 4020) in 1853-54 to nothing and averaged \u00a358 (Rs. 580).

The Survey Superintendent explained the fall by the fact that under existing arrangements most of the villages being hill villages paid a lump assessment and the villagers distributed the shares among themselves. In this way all the arable area was shown as occupied. Since the opening of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass the condition of the people had greatly improved. The survey rates applied to the T\u00e1rgaon villages settled in the previous year proved suitable to these villages.

As several changes had lately been made in this group of villages the Survey Superintendent dealt with it according to the old boundaries. The V\u00e1lva group of villages lay in the south-west of the district in the corner between the V\u00e1rna and Krishna rivers. It was bounded on the north by Kar\u00e1d, on the north-east and east by the Krishna, and on the south and south-west by the V\u00e1rna. On the western half of the northern boundary V\u00e1lva was separated from Kar\u00e1d by a lofty spur of the Sahy\u00e1dris, which in the fifteen miles in the west reduced V\u00e1lva to a strip of not more than three miles wide. The east, near the meeting of the V\u00e1rna and Krishna, was a rich black plain. Towards the west the country became more hilly, broken by small spurs from the Sahy\u00e1dris, and with tracts of m\u00e1l or stony land. The west of V\u00e1lva was exceedingly hilly; the tract between the\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Res. 693 of 4th March 1863; Major W. C. Anderson, Surv. Supt. 466 of 30th Dec, 1862; and Mr. R. E. H. Light, Asst. Supt, 26th November 1862.\nV\u00e1rna river and the lofty spur on the north was roughened with small spurs and branches. The rainfall varied greatly in different parts. On the Sahy\u00e1dris and for some miles down the V\u00e1rna valley the fall was too heavy for any dry-crop tillage except hill grains. Further east the rainfall became more and more moderate and seasonable, till to the east of the centre of the sub-division the general average of the rains was all that could be wished for the best dry crop tillage. The centre and west had much rice and garden land, the garden land watered both from wells and watercourses, and yielding considerable crops of sugarcane. The soil and climate of some of the eastern villages were excellently suited to cotton. But in the ordinary state of the cotton market grain and fodder paid better than cotton. The acre outturn of New Orleans was at least fifty per cent more valuable than that of local cotton.\\(^1\\) The V\u00e1lva sub-division was crossed from north to south by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Kolh\u00e1pur road and from it a cleared branch of about ten miles passed south-west to Battis-Shir\u00e1la. These were the only made roads in the sub-division. Most of the east and centre was level enough to admit of cart traffic by the ordinary country tracks during nine months of the year. The main lines of export were two, to the east for rice and other hill produce to the great markets of S\u00e1ngli and Miraj, and to the coast with grain and oil seed. Communication with the coast was either by the circuitous route of Kar\u00e1d and the Kumbh\u00e1rl\u00ed pass to Chiplun or by bullock track by Malk\u00e1pur a large trade centre in Kolh\u00e1pur down the \u00c1mba pass to the tidal port at R\u00e9j\u00e1pur, or by a second bullock track which followed the left bank of the V\u00e1rna and descended the T\u00edvra pass to Sangameshvar in Ratn\u00e1giri. The people of V\u00e1lva appeared (1863) on the whole prosperous. Compared with Kar\u00e1d or T\u00e1sgaon the existing assessment was light. These low rates were due to the distance of V\u00e1lva from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Under the former rule in all the sub-divisions near the capital the assessment had been forced to the highest point. In the more distant sub-divisions, such as Bij\u00e1pur and Pandharpur, the old revenue management was very lax. The distance from the capital allowed the district and village officers to settle matters among themselves with much less check or interference on the part of the head-quarters officials than in parts near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nDuring the fifteen years ending 1861-62 tillage in V\u00e1lva had fallen from 110,711 acres in 1847-48 to 108,543 in 1853-54 and again risen to 113,711 in 1861-62; collections had fallen from \u00a321,077 (Rs. 2,10,770) in 1847-48 to \u00a319,178 (Rs. 1,91,780) in 1851-52 and again risen to \u00a323,460 (Rs. 2,34,600) in 1861-62; and remissions had risen from \u00a31303 (Rs. 13,030) in 1847-48 to \u00a33635 (Rs. 36,350) in 1851-52 and again fallen to \u00a3147 (Rs. 1470) in 1861-62. The details are:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1863 (116 of 5th May) Major Anderson the Surv. Supt. wrote to the Collector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra: Should the attempt to introduce New Orleans cotton prove successful a considerable addition to the present supply of cotton may be expected from V\u00e1lva and its neighbourhood. Much land in the Kolh\u00e1pur S\u00e1ngli and Miraj states would yield good New Orleans. Once show the people that New Orleans grows and pays in V\u00e1lva and it will spread to all the neighbouring state and alienated villages. Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXV. 7-8.\nThe very slight increase in the tillage area from 110,711 acres in 1847-48 to 113,711 acres in 1861-62 was remarkable. The returns were of little value as the survey measurements showed that more than one-fourth of the area under tillage had not been brought to account. Of the whole area of 157,129 acres shown by the survey measurements as much as 10,777 acres were excellent garden and rice land. So that the existing acre rate (Re. 1 as. 7\u00bd) could not on the whole be heavy though faulty distribution caused individual hardship. Except in 1857-58 when there was a serious local failure of rain, since the rise of prices which set in about 1855 remissions had greatly decreased. With the prices which ruled during some years before the settlement the rates were very light. Under the survey settlement the 103 V\u00e1lva villages were arranged in six classes with highest dry crop acre rates varying from 5s. 3d. to 2s. (Rs. 2\u00bd - Re. 1). The villages in the first class were close to the Kar\u00e1d sub-division in the Krishna valley. The second class villages included the whole of south-eastern and central V\u00e1lva to a little west of the Kolhapur-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road, and were bordered on the east by some T\u00e1sgaon villages. For these a highest dry crop acre rate of 4s. 9d. (Rs. 2\u00bd) was proposed. For the remaining classes, rates of 4s. 3d., 3s. 9d., 3s. 3d., and 2s. (Rs. 2\u00bd, Rs. 1\u00bd, Rs. 1\u00bd, and Re. 1) were proposed according as the villages lay more towards the west up to the Sahy\u00e1dris. On the tillage of 1861-62 the survey rates showed a rise from \u00a323,460 (Rs. 2,34,600) to \u00a325,349 (Rs. 2,53,490) or eight per cent. The details are:\n\n---\n\n1 The highest dry crop acre rate for T\u00e1sgaon which was settled in 1852-53 was Rs. 2. This, in 1863 when V\u00e1lva was settled, was considered extraordinarily low, as prices had doubled between 1852 and 1863. Besides the climate of central V\u00e1lva was decidedly more certain than that of T\u00e1sgaon. On these grounds the V\u00e1lva survey rate was 9d. (6 as.) higher than the T\u00e1sgaon rate. Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXV. 12.\nA considerable part of the increase of revenue was from the assessment of inferior soils of which there were considerable tracts in the centre of the sub-division. Under former prices the cultivation of these soils would not pay; they were considered unarable, never having been tilled within the memory of man. They were used by the nearest landholder without being brought to account. This to some extent explains the great excess in occupied area shown by the survey. Existing high prices made these poor lands profitable. At the settlement they were often the object of keen competition. Thus the assessable area was very considerably increased. The survey rates proposed for V\u00e1lva were sanctioned by Government in June 1863.\n\nThe available revenue returns show that a marked increase of revenue accompanied and followed the introduction of the revenue survey. The revenue rose from \u00a3113,956 (Rs. 11,82,560) in 1855 when the revenue survey assessment was introduced in seventeen villages to \u00a3136,298 (Rs. 13,62,980) in 1865 when the new rates had been introduced over the whole 981 villages. Since 1864-65 it slowly increased till it reached \u00a3137,278 (Rs. 13,72,780) in 1874-75. In the next seven years it fell to \u00a3135,946 (Rs. 13,59,460) in 1881-82.

The season was also very bad in Kar\u00e1d and V\u00e1lva, but there the landholders were for the most part better off, and could continue to hold their fields in spite of a bad season.\u00b9\n\n1850-51.\n\nIn 1850 much of the early or khar\u00edf crops which were nearly ruined from want of rain were saved by heavy showers at the end of the season. As the crops in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and Bij\u00e1pur were mostly early, larger remissions were given in these two sub-divisions than in Kar\u00e1d and V\u00e1lva, where the late harvest was the most important. The cold weather crops were nearly failing when a very heavy and timely fall of rain in December made the season in Kar\u00e1d and V\u00e1lva one of the best known for years.\u00b2\n\n1851-52.\n\nThe season of 1851 was an average one with a sufficient but ill-timed rainfall. The revenue of 1851-52 showed a decrease of about \u00a35380 (Rs.53,800). The fall was due to the abolition of the exchange tax and to the liberal remissions in the south and east.\u00b3\n\n1855-56.\n\nIn 1855 the early rain was very scanty, and the early crops suffered considerably. The latter rains were abundant and the late harvest was good in all parts of the district except J\u00e1vli, Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and Pandharpur where the early harvest is of most importance.\u2074\n\n1856-57.\n\nIn 1856 the fall in the early part of the monsoon was very scanty, and the early crops suffered in all parts of the district except in V\u00e1lva. The late or rabi crop yielded a good harvest and the season was healthy.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 22 of 1852, 133. This information is for Kar\u00e1d, V\u00e1lva, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and Bij\u00e1pur only. The district annual reports for 1847-48, 1848-49, and 1849-50 are not available.

Rec. 17 of 1860, 143.\nIn 1857-58 rain fell abundantly in easterly showers at the beginning of the south-west monsoon and the prospects of the season appeared favourable throughout the district. Later on the rain failed in the eastern sub-divisions of Khatav, Kh\u00e1napur, Pandharpur and Bij\u00e1pur, and parts of the sub-divisions of V\u00e1lva and W\u00e1i, and the outturn of the early or kharif crops was small. In the remaining sub-divisions the fall of rain was seasonable and the harvest was above the average. Except in Khatav and Bij\u00e1pur and in parts of W\u00e1i the rabi or late crops yielded a good return. The season was healthy. The collections were \u00a3144,813 (Rs. 14,48,130), \u00a39727 (Rs. 97,270) were remitted, and \u00a310 (Rs. 100) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1858-59 the fall in the early part of the south-west rains was scanty and the early crops in light soils suffered. With this exception both the early and late harvests were good. The district was on the whole healthy. The collections rose from \u00a3144,813 to \u00a3152,794 (Rs. 14,48,130 - Rs. 15,27,940), \u00a33384 (Rs. 33,840) were remitted, and \u00a35 (Rs. 50) left outstanding.\n\nThe season of 1859-60 was scarcely an average one. Public health was not good; cholera fever and dysentery prevailed. The collections rose from \u00a3152,794 to \u00a3155,025 (Rs. 15,27,940 - Rs. 15,50,250), \u00a34076 (Rs. 40,760) were remitted, and \u00a34 (Rs. 40) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1860-61 the rainfall was favourable and the early crops yielded a good return except in the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r\u2019s division of V\u00e1lva and in the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division of W\u00e1i, where they suffered from want of rain and from the ravages of insects. In January 1861, except the sh\u00e1l\u00fa or late jv\u00e1ri, which suffered from insects in the Koregaon and Bij\u00e1pur sub-divisions, from excessive heat in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division, and from excessive moisture in the Kar\u00e1d and J\u00e1vli sub-divisions, the late crops promised a good harvest. Disease was slightly prevalent among men and cattle throughout the district. The collections rose from \u00a3155,025 to \u00a3161,556 (Rs. 15,50,250 - Rs. 16,15,560), \u00a31555 (Rs. 15,550) were remitted, and there were no outstandings.\n\nIn 1861-62 the rainfall though sufficient was ill-timed, and, except of rice n\u00e1gli and s\u00e1va, there was an extensive failure of the early crops. Cholera prevailed to some extent and cattle disease was present in a few places. The collections rose from \u00a3161,556 to \u00a3170,793 (Rs. 16,15,560 - Rs. 17,07,930), \u00a32805 (Rs. 28,050) were remitted, and there were no outstandings.\n\nIn 1862-63 the early rains were very short and the early crops to a great extent failed. Later in the season, during September and October, heavy showers improved the prospects and enabled the cultivators to sow with late crops much land in which the early crops had either not been sown or had failed. The return from these late or rabi crops was (March 1863) expected to be sufficient to make good the losses caused by the failure of the early rains. Public health was good. Cholera and in a few places fever and ague appeared, but did not become general. In July and August cattle\nin some of the sub-divisions died from want of fodder. The collections fell from \u00a3170,793 to \u00a3161,685 (Rs. 17,07,930 - Rs. 16,16,850), \u00a33961 (Rs. 39,610) were remitted, and \u00a327 (Rs. 270) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1863-64 in the early part of the monsoon the rainfall was generally scanty and insufficient. Later in the season, except in M\u00e1n, M\u00e1lsiras, and Pandharpur, the fall was more general and satisfactory. With these exceptions the season was on the whole an average one. Cholera prevailed and cattle disease to a trifling extent. The collections rose from \u00a3161,685 to \u00a3184,919 (Rs. 16,16,850 - Rs. 18,49,190), \u00a32641 (Rs. 26,410) were remitted, and \u00a3171 (Rs. 1710) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1864-65 to the end of August the rainfall was seasonable and abundant, but a widespread failure of the September-October rains damaged both the early and the late harvests. Cholera prevailed slightly. The collections fell from \u00a3184,919 to \u00a3174,085 (Rs. 18,49,190 - Rs. 17,40,850), \u00a358 (Rs. 580) were remitted, and \u00a312 (Rs. 120) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1865-66 the rainfall though not seasonable was sufficient and the early or kharif crops were good. The late or rabi crops were (February 1866) also generally good and promised a fair harvest. The season was healthy. The collections fell from \u00a3174,085 to \u00a3172,239 (Rs. 17,40,850 - Rs. 17,22,390), \u00a355 (Rs. 550) were remitted, and \u00a312 (Rs. 120) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1866-67 in the four sub-divisions of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, P\u00e1tan, Kar\u00e1d, and T\u00e1gaon, the early harvest was good. In Koregaon, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, J\u00e1vli, V\u00e1lva, and Shir\u00e1la it was average, and in T\u00e1gaon, W\u00e1i, Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, M\u00e1n, and M\u00e1lsiras it was poor. In all except Khat\u00e1v, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, M\u00e1n, and M\u00e1lsiras, the prospects of the late harvest were (February 1867) good. Fever and cholera prevailed to a slight extent, but on the whole public health was good. The collections fell from \u00a3172,239 to \u00a3172,052 (Rs. 17,22,390 - Rs. 17,20,520), \u00a339 (Rs. 390) were remitted, and \u00a318 (Rs. 180) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1867-68 the season was on the whole good. The early crops yielded a very good harvest especially in the east and the late crops thrived generally and promised a good return. Public health was good though fever was prevalent. The collections fell from \u00a3172,052 to \u00a3171,165 (Rs. 17,20,520 - Rs. 17,11,650), \u00a3152 (Rs. 1520) were remitted, and \u00a316 (Rs. 160) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1868-69 the early fall was general and favourable to the early crops which promised well. But the late rains were short and the late crops were injured to some extent especially in M\u00e1lsiras where the outturn was small. Cholera and fever were widespread but slight. The collections fell from \u00a3171,165 to \u00a3170,256 (Rs. 17,11,650 - Rs. 17,02,560), \u00a348 (Rs. 480) were remitted, and \u00a3211 (Rs. 2110) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1869-70 the rainfall was abundant and seasonable and the early harvest was excellent. In January 1870 the late crops were also thriving and promised a good harvest. Much heavy rain fell\nin November and December. Public health on the whole was good. The collections fell from \u00a3170,256 to \u00a3169,230 (Rs. 17,02,560 - Rs. 16,92,300), \u00a3123 (Rs. 1230) were remitted, and \u00a384 (Rs. 840) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1870-71 the early rains were not seasonable and in some parts of the district sowing was kept back. Later on the fall of rain was so incessant and excessive as to injure the crops. The early crops on the whole yielded an average harvest, and in January 1871 the late crops promised well. During the early part of the season fever was general but seldom fatal, and during August and September there was much cholera. A slight epidemic of cattle disease passed over some of the sub-divisions. The collections fell from \u00a3169,230 to \u00a3168,568 (Rs. 16,92,300 - Rs. 16,85,680), \u00a349 (Rs. 490) were remitted, and \u00a360 (Rs. 600) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1871-72 the rainfall was scanty. In the west the early crops yielded a fair return; in the east from want of rain the early crops were in most parts not sown, and where they were sown the yield was small. The late crops where sown withered for want of late rain which failed almost throughout the whole of the district. Cholera and fever prevailed to a slight extent, and cattle disease appeared in some sub-divisions. The collections fell from \u00a3168,568 to \u00a3166,636 (Rs. 16,85,680 - Rs. 16,66,360), \u00a3286 (Rs. 2860) were remitted, and \u00a32494 (Rs. 24,940) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1872-73 the rainfall was on the whole seasonable. The early harvest was good except in some of the hill villages of Javli, P\u00e1tan, W\u00e1i, and V\u00e1lva. In December 1872 the cold weather crops promised well. Slight fever and cholera prevailed, but the season both for men and for cattle on the whole was healthy. The collections rose from \u00a3166,636 to \u00a3168,810 (Rs. 16,66,360 - Rs. 16,88,100), \u00a3197 (Rs. 1970) were remitted, and \u00a3195 (Rs. 1950) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1873-74 the rainfall was on the whole seasonable and plentiful. Both the early and late harvests were good. Except slight fever and dysentery there was little sickness, and cattle also were healthy except in V\u00e1lva and P\u00e1tan. The tillage area fell from 1,660,362 to 1,658,080 acres and the collections from \u00a3168,810 to \u00a3165,190 (Rs. 16,88,100 - Rs. 16,51,900), \u00a3243 (Rs. 2430) were remitted, and \u00a3281 (Rs. 2810) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1874-75 the rainfall was seasonable and plentiful. All over the district the early harvest was about an average and in December 1874 the late crops were promising. The public health was good. The tillage area fell from 1,658,080 to 1,650,015 acres and the collections from \u00a3165,190 to \u00a3161,456 (Rs. 16,51,900 - Rs. 16,44,560), \u00a3121 (Rs. 1210) were remitted, and \u00a3555 (Rs. 5550) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1875-76 the rainfall was plentiful but unseasonable, heavy at first and scanty in the latter part of the season. The early crops were damaged by excessive rain, and in some places by floods, but the outturn was not below the average. The late harvest was rather below the average owing to want of rain. Cholera prevailed during\npart of the year, but public health on the whole was good. The tillage area fell from 1,650,015 to 1,421,067 acres and the collections from \u00a3164,456 to \u00a3155,794 (Rs. 16,44,560 - Rs. 15,57,940), \u00a392 (Rs. 920) were remitted, and \u00a3414 (Rs. 4140) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1876-77 the rainfall besides being short was very ill-timed and the season over the east of the district was one of famine. The early crops suffered considerably and very little of the late crops were sown. Cattle suffered greatly from the want of fodder. Cholera was general and the mortality high. The tillage area fell from 1,421,067 to 1,418,004 acres and the collections from \u00a3155,794 to \u00a3130,470 (Rs. 15,57,940 - Rs. 13,04,700), \u00a3288 (Rs. 2880) were remitted, and \u00a325,185 (Rs. 2,51,850) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1877-78 the rainfall was favourable and the season was good. Cholera, fever, and small-pox prevailed. The tillage area fell from 1,418,004 to 1,415,242 acres. The collections rose from \u00a3130,470 to \u00a3151,551 (Rs. 13,04,700 - Rs. 15,15,510), \u00a3139 (Rs. 1390) were remitted, and \u00a35080 (Rs. 50,800) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1878-79 in October a very heavy fall of rain did much injury to the early crops. Rats and locusts damaged the cold weather crops, but the harvest was fair. A fatal form of fever prevailed during the cold weather. The tillage area fell from 1,415,242 to 1,410,218 acres and the collections from \u00a3151,551 to \u00a3150,641 (Rs. 15,15,510 - Rs. 15,06,410), \u00a3116 (Rs. 1160) were remitted, and \u00a35574 (Rs. 55,740) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1879-80 early in the season rats threatened to be troublesome, but the heavy rains of July and August freed the district from the pest. Both early and late crops were everywhere good and in parts excellent. The season was healthy. The tillage area fell from 1,410,218 to 1,404,949 acres, and the collections rose from \u00a3150,641 to \u00a3152,006 (Rs. 15,06,410 - Rs. 15,20,060), \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) were remitted, and \u00a33288 (Rs. 32,880) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1880-81 the short rainfall caused a want of water during the hot months. But as the fall was singularly well-timed, the harvest, especially the cold weather harvest, was one of the richest reaped for years. The season was very healthy. The tillage area fell from 1,404,949 to 1,392,916 acres and the collections rose from \u00a3152,006 to \u00a3153,540 (Rs. 15,20,060 - Rs. 15,35,400), \u00a357 (Rs. 570) were remitted, and \u00a31210 (Rs. 12,100) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1881-82 the rainfall was unequally distributed, being in some places above and in others below the average. The July and August falls were scanty, but most of the early crops were saved by good September and October rain. The late crops were generally good. Except in T\u00e1sgaon, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, part of V\u00e1lva, and Khandale, the season was favourable. Cholera prevailed in all the subdivisions and caused 1508 deaths, and guineaworm was common owing to the inferior water-supply. The tillage area fell from 1,392,916 to 1,386,746 acres. The collections rose from \u00a3153,540 to \u00a3154,989 (Rs. 15,35,400 - Rs. 15,49,890), \u00a3178 (Rs. 1780) were remitted, and \u00a3192 (Rs. 1920) left outstanding.\nIn 1882-83 the season was on the whole favourable. Except in Kar\u00e1d, the rainfall was much above the average in all the subdivisions. Partial damage was caused by excess of rain in some sub-divisions. Locusts spread over a large portion of the district, but, except in hill villages in W\u00e1i and J\u00e1vli, did no serious injury. The November rains were very favourable to the late crops. Except that cholera proved fatal in 993 cases, public health was on the whole good. The tillage area fell from 1,386,746 to 1,384,254 acres. The collections rose from \u00a3154,989 to \u00a3155,270 (Rs.15,49,890 - Rs. 15,52,700), \u00a3230 (Rs. 2300) were remitted, and \u00a358 (Rs. 580) left outstanding.\n\nThe following statement shows in tabular form the available yearly statistics of tillage and land revenue during the twenty-six years ending 1882-83:\n\n**S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Tillage and Revenue, 1857-1883.**\n\n| Year | Tillage | Land Revenue |\n|------|---------|--------------|\n|      | Acres   | Remitted    | For Collection | Outstanding | Collected |\n| 1857-58 | ...     | 97,275      | 14,48,227      | 98          | 14,48,129 |\n| 1858-59 | ...     | 33,835      | 15,27,991      | 54          | 15,27,927 |\n| 1859-60 | ...     | 40,762      | 15,50,285      | 38          | 15,50,247 |\n| 1860-61 | ...     | 15,546      | 16,15,585      | ...         | 16,15,585 |\n| 1861-62 | ...     | 29,319      | 17,27,999      | ...         | 17,27,999 |\n| 1862-63 | ...     | 39,613      | 16,17,135      | 270         | 16,16,865 |\n| 1863-64 | ...     | 26,410      | 18,50,901      | 1713        | 18,49,188 |\n| 1864-65 | ...     | 580         | 17,42,968      | 2116        | 17,40,852 |\n| 1865-66 | ...     | 552         | 17,22,510      | 117         | 17,22,393 |\n| 1866-67 | ...     | 388         | 17,20,700      | 183         | 17,20,517 |\n| 1867-68 | ...     | 419         | 17,17,016      | 107         | 17,16,909 |\n| 1868-69 | ...     | 478         | 17,04,470      | 2110        | 17,02,560 |\n| 1869-70 | ...     | 1226        | 16,93,143      | 840         | 16,92,303 |\n| 1870-71 | ...     | 488         | 16,86,282      | 601         | 16,85,681 |\n| 1871-72 | ...     | 2865        | 16,91,307      | 24,945      | 16,66,362 |\n| 1872-73 | ...     | 1,690,362   | 16,90,083      | 1954        | 16,88,098 |\n| 1873-74 | ...     | 1,655,080   | 16,90,083      | 2830        | 16,61,753 |\n| 1874-75 | ...     | 1,450,115   | 1208          | 5550        | 16,44,561 |\n| 1875-76 | ...     | 1,421,087   | 917           | 4141        | 15,57,941 |\n| 1876-77 | ...     | 1,418,004   | 2880          | 2,51,849    | 13,04,697 |\n| 1877-78 | ...     | 1,415,242   | 1388          | 50,796      | 15,15,514 |\n| 1878-79 | ...     | 1,410,218   | 1161          | 55,742      | 15,04,466 |\n| 1879-80 | ...     | 1,392,940   | 15,29,945     | 12,096      | 13,19,849 |\n| 1880-81 | ...     | 1,392,916   | 666           | 12,096      | 13,19,849 |\n| 1881-82 | ...     | 1,386,746   | 1777          | 1917        | 15,49,888 |\n| 1882-83 | ...     | 1,384,254   | 2302          | 588         | 15,52,697 |\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nChapter IX.\n\nJustice.\n\nUnder the Peshw\u00e1s (1749-1818), except in a few large cities which had occasionally exclusive civil courts mostly deciding suits referred by the Peshw\u00e1s, there were no independent civil courts. With little or no control from the central government the office of civil judge was usually combined in the same office with that of political chief, commander of troops, collector of revenue, and police magistrate, and as his military, fiscal, or magisterial duties were more pressing and perhaps more attractive than the hearing and decision of suits, the judicial duties except under special interest or favour were considered subordinate and received little attention. Thus, as there were few independent civil courts in which the people could seek redress as a matter of right, civil justice in rural parts was chiefly administered among husbandmen by the village council or panch\u00e1yat, among traders by the trade or caste guild or mah\u00e1jan, and among the military classes by the military commander. In cases in which the suitor was a poor trader and the party who owed him redress a powerful chief, the suitor often resorted to dharna or tr\u00e1ga to obtain justice, that is he stationed himself at the door of the chief\u2019s house and often underwent severe privations.\n\nOn the establishment of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s government under Prat\u00e1psinh in 1818, though the machinery was little changed, justice was better administered. The chief or in his absence his brother and heir-apparent alone were the final court of appeal. Before he filed a suit the complainant had to submit a written or verbal complaint to the chief. The chief orally examined the complainant as to the grounds of his complaint and the evidence he had to produce in support of it, and sometimes sent for the defendant if at hand and examined him in the same way. The dispute was thus often settled, or the case dismissed as frivolous, without coming to a formal trial. But in doubtful or intricate cases, or where no settlement could be made, the chief gave leave to bring a suit by filing a detailed petition in the court. The suit was then entered for trial in regular course before one of the ordinary tribunals of the country, such as the panch\u00e1yats, the courts of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs, or the R\u00e1ja\u2019s ad\u00e1lat or court where the R\u00e1ja\u2019s brother presided and where the order to any particular officer to try any particular case was registered. This preliminary inquiry by the chief in person, though it showed\n\n---\n\n1 Early justice (1749 - 1849) is compiled from the Reports in 1851-52 of the Commissioner the late Sir Bartle Frere and of his judicial assistant Mr. Coxon.\nthe old Mar\u00e1tha principle that the admission to a court of justice was a favour and not a right, led to the immediate satisfaction of many just claims which would otherwise have been repudiated; other claims were withdrawn or settled by the parties when they saw the view taken of their case as stated by themselves to an unbiased judge; while a regular trial was reserved for cases which from their intricacy or the conflict of evidence required to be formally stated and carefully sifted in a court of law before any decision could be formed as to their merits.\n\nIn 1839, on the accession of Sh\u00e1hn or \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb the judicial courts were remodelled under the advice of Colonel Ovans whose aim it was to make all possible advance towards the system laid down in Regulation IV. of 1827. Petty cases were left to the revenue and magisterial officers. For the trial of more important causes regular judges called amins and ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishs were appointed on fixed salaries. Provision was also made for a regular system of appeal to the chief who exercised a general control over every branch of the judicial administration. In the eleven subdivisions including Pandharpur and Bij\u00e1pur besides the present district of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra except T\u00e1sgaon which then formed part of \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb\u2019s territory, sixteen civil courts, five for amins and eleven for ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishs were established. Of the five amins\u2019 courts, with powers to decide suits of \u00a330 (Rs. 300) and upwards, three were held at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, one at Kar\u00e1d, and one at Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra courts had jurisdiction over six sub-divisions J\u00e1vli, Khat\u00e1v, Koregaon, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, T\u00e1rgaon, and W\u00e1i; the Kar\u00e1d court over two sub-divisions Kar\u00e1d and V\u00e1lva; and the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur court over three sub-divisions Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur Pandharpur and Bij\u00e1pur. Each of the eleven ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishs\u2019 courts was held at the head-quarters of each of the eleven sub-divisions, with powers to decide suits of \u00a32 10s. to \u00a330 (Rs. 25-300). To dispose of claims under \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r in each sub-division held a court of petty requests in which a petition was received and the defendant called upon for his reply. If the defendant admitted the claim, an order to pay was endorsed on the petition; if he disputed the debt, the case was reported to the chief who directed that evidence to the claim should be recorded, or that the claim as prim\u00e1 facie untenable should be thrown out without further inquiry. In the disposal of these cases no powers of award were vested in the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs who, after having taken the evidence on both sides, referred their proceedings for final disposal to the huzur or head-quarter office. Suits of less than \u00a31 (Rs. 10) were usually referred by the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r to the shekhd\u00e1r of the village group within which the cause of action arose or the defendant dwelt. The shekhd\u00e1r investigated and reported the case to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r in the same manner as did the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r to the huzur. Independent of these civil courts subject to revision by the chief, the six guaranteed j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs of Bhor, Phaltan, Aundh, Jath, Daphl\u00e1pur, and Akalkot, held their own courts. Against the decrees of these j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs an appeal lay to the Resident at the R\u00e1ja\u2019s court. Besides these, under grants or sanads received from Appa S\u00e1heb or former Governments, a number of smaller j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs and in\u00e1md\u00e1rs held petty tribunals, with powers to decide suits arising within the limits\nof a particular village group, town, or quarter of town to which the grant referred.\n\nDuring the reign of \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb (1839-1848) civil justice was administered with extreme leniency. Compared with the system given in the Regulation Code, the R\u00e1ja\u2019s system of administering justice differed in seven chief points. Under the Regulation Code no suit, however trifling, was tried before any but the regular judicial tribunals, and with the same formalities as suits of the largest amount. Under the R\u00e1ja\u2019s system all small suits of less than \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) were tried by revenue and magisterial officers styled m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs and shekh\u00e9d\u00e1rs. Appeals were tried by a judge of appeal who went on circuit and sat in each subordinate court from which the causes were appealed. Under the R\u00e1ja\u2019s system the parties to a suit were examined as chief witnesses and other witnesses were not called till all that the parties could depose had been ascertained. Under the Regulations, in disposing of conflicting claims to property attached by any process of court, a separate action at law became necessary to enable the party who held possession before the property was attached to raise the attachment. Under the R\u00e1ja\u2019s system when the process was opposed by another, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, to whom the enforcement of the decree was entrusted, had to make a summary inquiry into the nature of the lien brought into competition with the decree, and report the result to the chief, awaiting further instructions as to proceeding or withdrawing. This practice resembles that of a British Court of Equity without the delays which in practice attend a reference to a Master in Equity. Under the R\u00e1ja\u2019s system, when the insolvency of a trader was clear, a petition from one creditor was generally enough to stop any proceedings on behalf of another creditor against the same insolvent. The insolvent\u2019s principal creditors were called together, and a committee or panch\u00e1y\u00e1t appointed, consisting of members on behalf of both the insolvent and his creditors, with one or more appointed by the court. The accounts of the insolvent were made over to the committee who reported on his debts and assets and often wound up the insolvent\u2019s affairs under the orders of the court. Under the R\u00e1ja\u2019s system panch\u00e1yats were much more employed than in the Regulated Provinces. In complicated cases they were employed to ascertain the exact issues to be decided as well as to decide on the issues themselves. Thus in an intricate mercantile case, a reference to a panch\u00e1y\u00e1t would often be made to ascertain the precise points on which the case hinged, which points might be afterwards tried by the ordinary tribunal. When employed to decide an issue; the proceedings of the panch\u00e1y\u00e1t became a part of the proceedings of the court. While the case was under investigation before the panch\u00e1y\u00e1t, it appeared in the returns as one of those in arrears in the court whence it was referred, and when the panch\u00e1y\u00e1t gave in their award, it became the basis of the final decree, and thus obtained all the force which would have belonged to a decision of the court. In all cases of action to recover balance of a running account or a bond debt, the practice of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s court was much more like that of Bankruptcy Commissioners than of civil courts under Regulation. Whatever might be the\nterms of a bond, the amount of value received was always strictly inquired into, and the award limited to the amount so proved, with legal interest which never exceeded twelve per cent a year, or cent per cent when compound interest at twelve per cent would exceed the principal. Moreover, when an award was given which the party cast could not liquidate at once, but had the means of paying by instalments, the instalments were fixed in the decree. When a debtor's person or property was attached under a decree one attachment was in ordinary cases held to be a sufficient satisfaction, though in the event of the party against whom the attachment issued subsequently acquiring property, the previous attachment was not a sufficient answer to a fresh suit brought to obtain payment of an unliquidated balance.\n\nEach of the eleven sub-divisions of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory under \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb (1839-1848) was in charge of a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r who superintended the collection of revenue and managed the police. Under the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, each sub-division was divided into a number of village groups or th\u00e1n\u00e1s of about seventeen villages, each in charge of a shekhd\u00e1r. Subordinate to the shekhd\u00e1r were village headmen or p\u00e1tils. Under the headman or p\u00e1t\u00edl were his deputy or chaugula and his assistants Mh\u00e1rs and R\u00e1moshis. In his police and revenue duties the headman was aided by the village accountant or kulkarni who kept accounts and wrote all reports, depositions, proceedings, receipts for revenue, and generally all bonds and acknowledgments. On receipt of a report from the headman of a crime having been committed in a village, the shekhd\u00e1r went to the spot, inspected the scene of crime, and examined the witnesses and suspected parties. When murder was suspected, the shekhd\u00e1r held an inquest on the corpse before allowing its obsequies to proceed. The shekhd\u00e1r had no power of deciding cases or of inflicting fine. After making inquiries he sent a report to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r who referred it to the huzur or head-quarter office. At the huzur a police case sent for trial by the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r was received by the faujd\u00e1r munim, whose duty it was to prepare it for final hearing and to call upon the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r for any further evidence that he might consider necessary, or that might have been overlooked by the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. The duties of the faujd\u00e1r munim were very similar to those of a shirasted\u00e1r or head clerk in a magistrate's office. He reported on all petitions from complainants and on representations from the sub-divisional police on matters connected with his particular department, prepared cases for hearing, saw that the witnesses were in attendance, and brought on the trial. The R\u00e1ja was the sole judge of his own court. When sitting in judgment, he was attended by the chief officers of his court, and the procedure was similar to that of a magistrate's office. It differed from that of a sessions court, in no evidence being taken and recorded anew from the mouths of the witnesses. Under \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb the chief\n\n---\n\n1 The office of shekhd\u00e1r has now given way to that of mah\u00e1lkari who was first employed in the Konkan with the status of a deputy-m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, and the system having worked well, was extended first to Poona and then to other districts.\nfeatures of criminal justice were that capital punishment, torture, mutilation, and such punishment as deprived the offender of his caste were avoided; where compensation was offered by the offender, punishment was much lessened; and corporal punishment and public disgrace were freely used. There was no written code of laws, and the only guides were equity, expediency, and the usage of the country and of the caste.\n\nIn 1849, when the territories of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were annexed by the British Government, the judicial staff was reorganized. For the courts of the five amins and eleven ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishs maintained by \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb at a monthly cost of \u00a349 16s. (Rs. 498), eleven civil courts, one of principal sadar amin, one of sadar amin, five of munsifs, and four of ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishs were substituted at an increased monthly cost of \u00a3185 (Rs. 1850). The principal sadar amin, drawing a monthly salary of \u00a350 (Rs. 500), held his court at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with jurisdiction over the sub-divisions of S\u00e1t\u00e9ra and J\u00e1lvi. He had powers to try suits to any amount and, if necessary, appeals up to \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Under the principal sadar amin a ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish, drawing a monthly salary of \u00a35 (Rs. 50), held his court at J\u00e1lvi and tried such suits under \u00a310 (Rs. 100) from the J\u00e1lvi sub-division as the principal sadar amin referred to him. The sadar amin, drawing a monthly salary of \u00a335 (Rs. 350), held his court at Kar\u00e1d for the disposal of suits from the Kar\u00e1d, T\u00e1rgaon, and V\u00e1lva subdivisions. His jurisdiction extended to suits of value not greater than \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). Under the sadar amin two ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhishs, one for T\u00e1rgaon and the other for V\u00e1lva, were employed, each on a monthly salary of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) and with powers to try suits under \u00a310 (Rs. 100). The munsifs of Pandharpur, W\u00e1i, Koregaon, and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, each of whom received a monthly salary of \u00a320 (Rs. 200), were invested with first class powers and the munsifs of Bij\u00e1pur and Khat\u00e1v, each of whom received a monthly salary of \u00a310 (Rs. 100), were invested with second class powers only. The munsifs had powers to try suits up to \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), the suits of greater value being referred to the principal sadar amin. The munsif for W\u00e1i and Koregaon was assisted by a ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish at Koregaon on a monthly salary of \u00a35 (Rs. 50). The law administered was that of the Regulations in a modified form, all interpretations and circular orders of the sadar ad\u00e1lat being sent to the Commissioner as to a District Judge. The powers and responsibilities of the first assistant were those of a District Judge, and his salary was not lower than that of a senior assistant judge for a detached station. The appellate powers which had formerly resided in the sadar ad\u00e1lat were transferred to the Commissioner but he was allowed to use his discretion in submitting for the judgment of the ad\u00e1lat cases of a peculiarly difficult nature. The j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs' courts both those of the greater feudatories and those of inferior j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, possessing judicial powers within their own estates, remained as in \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb's time. The Commissioner in regard to these was invested with authority to hear appeals from decisions of the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs' courts or to refer them to his judicial assistant for trial; in the latter case he was empowered to review the decision of his assistant. All suits regarding possession of land and hereditary offices were, as in the Regulation Provinces, cognizable by the revenue courts.\nAmong the reforms introduced at the time of the annexation was the substitution of stamp duties for the gunheg\u00e1ri or fines that had formerly been levied from unsuccessful suitors. In the R\u00e1ja\u2019s time when the defendant appeared in court the nature of the claim was stated to him, and he was required to give in a written answer. If this contained an admission of the claim, the court passed decree in favour of the plaintiff. If however the claim was disputed, both parties were required, before proceeding further with the suit, to furnish security for what was called hurku gunheg\u00e1ri, that is a fine on the loss of a suit. This in native states represented the stamp duties paid in British districts. In the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja\u2019s courts, the gunheg\u00e1ri amounted to ten per cent of the whole value in suits up to \u00a31,000 (Rs. 10,000), eight per cent in suits for amounts ranging from \u00a31000 to \u00a32000 (Rs. 10,000-Rs. 20,000), and five per cent in suits for more than \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). As in Regulation courts this charge was levied after judgment, where costs were awarded from the party cast in the suit. As the gunheg\u00e1ri system was very complicated and troublesome, \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb partially introduced stamps by requiring that all plaints, besides a variety of other documents, should be prepared on stamped paper. When the state came under British rule gunheg\u00e1ri was at once replaced by the ordinary stamp duties.\n\nAfter the annexation in 1849, the faujd\u00e1r munim or one of his clerks submitted all criminal cases sent by the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r to the third assistant to the Commissioner who had powers similar to those of an assistant magistrate. The third assistant having examined all the witnesses produced by the sub-divisional police officers ordinarily decided the case and forwarded his proceedings to the Commissioner. If however he found that the case was beyond his jurisdiction or that the offence was deserving of a severer punishment than he was competent to inflict, he simply recorded the evidence and sent the accused to the Commissioner for trial, forwarding at the same time to that officer the record of the evidence taken by him.\n\nOn the 4th of October 1854, instead of the Commissioner Mr. Rose was appointed as Collector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and was invested with all the powers political and judicial which had formerly resided in the Commissioner. In criminal matters the powers of the Collector\u2019s judicial assistant were coextensive with those of a Sessions Judge.\n\nOn the 15th of April 1863 the district was brought under the general regulations.\n\nIn 1870 the number of civil courts was ten, the number of suits disposed of was 13,899, and the average duration was 132 days. In 1875 the number of courts was the same as in 1870, the number of suits disposed of fell to 11,448, and the average duration rose to 149 days. In 1880 the number of courts rose to thirteen, the number of suits disposed of fell to 4360, and the average duration rose to 182 days. At present (1883) the district has a District Judge and eleven sub-\n\n---\n\n1 Of hurku gunheg\u00e1ri, hurku means a share of damage gained from hurku to win and gunheg\u00e1ri means a fine.\njudges. Of the eleven sub-judges one has powers of the first class and the rest exercise powers of the second class. In general a sub-judge is appointed for each sub-division, but the two small subdivisions of W\u00e1i and J\u00e1vli have been united under one sub-judge, and in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the most important of the sub-divisions it has been found necessary to appoint two of these officers. Of the two sub-judges at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra one, a first class sub-judge, has special jurisdiction above \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) over the whole district and ordinary jurisdiction over the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division; and the other, a joint second class sub-judge, has ordinary jurisdiction over the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra subdivision. Of the remaining nine second class sub-judges the W\u00e1i and Medha sub-judge has jurisdiction over W\u00e1i and J\u00e1vli, the Rahimatpur sub-judge over Koregaon, the P\u00e1tan sub-judge over P\u00e1tan, the Kar\u00e1d sub-judge over Kar\u00e1d, the Ashta sub-judge over V\u00e1lva, the Dahivadi sub-judge over M\u00e1n, the Khat\u00e1v sub-judge over Khat\u00e1v, the Vita sub-judge over Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and the T\u00e1sgaon sub-judge over T\u00e1sgaon. The average distance of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra court from its furthest six villages is eighty miles as respects its special jurisdiction and fourteen miles as respects ordinary jurisdiction, of the W\u00e1i and Medha court twenty-two miles from W\u00e1i for W\u00e1i and eighteen miles from Medha for J\u00e1vli, of the Rahimatpur court twenty-seven miles, of the P\u00e1tan court fifteen miles, of the Kar\u00e1d court fourteen miles, of the Ashta court sixty miles, of the Dahivadi court twenty-two miles, of the Khat\u00e1v and Vita courts each eighteen miles, and of the T\u00e1sgaon court twenty-one miles.\n\nDuring the thirteen years ending 1882 the yearly number of suits decided varied from 13,899 in 1870 to 3660 in 1881 and averaged 9934. Of the thirteen years, during the seven years ending 1876 the suits varied from 13,899 in 1870 to 11,448 in 1875 and averaged 12,937; during the three years ending 1879 the suits fell by about thirty per cent, varying from 9094 in 1877 to 8289 in 1878 and averaging 8695; and during the next three years ending 1882, owing to the introduction of conciliators and village munsifs under the Deccan Agriculturists\u2019 Relief Act in 1879 the suits further fell by about fifty per cent, varying from 4478 in 1882 to 3660 in 1881 and averaging 4166. Of the total number of suits decided, sixty-seven per cent have on an average been given against the defendant in his absence. During the ten years ending 1879 this percentage shows no marked change, varying from 75\u00b74 in 1870 to 66\u00b74 in 1878; after 1879, owing to the introduction of conciliators and village munsifs under Act XVII. of 1879 the percentage fell to 29\u00b72 in 1880, to 8\u00b79 in 1881, and to 6\u00b77 in 1882.

In 433 or 9\u00b766 per cent of the suits decided in 1882 the decree was executed by putting the plaintiff in possession of the immoveable property claimed. The number of this class of cases varied from 311 out of 4360 in 1880 to 540 out of 12,674 in 1874. In 867 or 19\u00b736 per cent of the 1882 decisions, decrees for money due were executed by the attachment or sale of property, 690 or 15\u00b740 per cent being for immoveable property and 177 or 3\u00b796 per cent for movable property. The number of attachments or sales of immoveable property varied from 650 in 1881 to 9366 in 1873, and of movable property from 177 in 1882 to 2272 in 1879. During the thirteen years ending 1882 the number of decrees executed by the arrest of debtors varied from seventy-four in 1881 to 616 in 1874. During the five years ending 1874 this number varied from 436 in 1871 to 616 in 1874; during the next five years ending 1879 the number fell, varying from 169 in 1877 to 391 in 1875; and during the three years ending 1882 the number further fell, varying from 107 in 1880 to seventy-four in 1881. The following table shows that during the same thirteen years (1870-1882) the number of civil prisoners varied from twenty-five in 1881 to 267 in 1874:\n\n**S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Civil Prisoners, 1870 - 1882.**\n\n| Year | Prisoners | Days | Release |\n|------|-----------|------|---------|\n|      |           |      | Satisfying Decrees | Creditors' Request | No Subsistence | Disclosure of Property | Time Expired |\n| 1870 | 212       | 24   | 22     | 23       | 136          | 14             | 4            |\n| 1871 | 163       | 30   | 28     | 16       | 109          | 9              | 3            |\n| 1872 | 227       | 20   | 15     | 51       | 134          | 6              | 3            |\n| 1873 | 259       | 29   | 12     | 62       | 167          | 2              | 3            |\n| 1874 | 267       | 31   | 11     | 66       | 160          | 19             | 9            |\n| 1875 | 210       | 26   | 15     | 43       | 130          | 9              | 3            |\n| 1876 | 191       | 25   | 18     | 28       | 155          | 7              | 3            |\n| 1877 | 111       | 26   | 15     | 15       | 69           | 4              | 3            |\n| 1878 | 82        | 26   | 11     | 1        | 65           | 4              | 3            |\n| 1879 | 54        | 27   | 8      | 21       | 53           | 6              | 3            |\n| 1880 | 29        | 25   | 3      | 2        | 23           | 1              | 1            |\n| 1881 | 25        | 24   | 3      | 3        | 17           | 2              | 2            |\n| 1882 | 30        | 30   | 2      | 4        | 20           | 4              | 3            |\n\nThe following statement shows in tabular form the working of the district civil courts during the thirteen years ending 1882:\n\n**S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Civil Courts, 1870 - 1882.**\n\n| Year | Suits | Average Value in \u00a3 | Disposed Exparte | Dismissed Exparte | Decreed on Confession | Otherwise | Total |\n|------|-------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-------|\n| 1870 | 13,599| 7\u00b725               | 10,256           | 924               | 506                   | 975       | 12,361|\n| 1871 | 13,239| 7\u00b779               | 9,790            | 203               | 764                   | 811       | 11,579|\n| 1872 | 15,024| 8\u00b786               | 9,544            | 164               | 752                   | 820       | 11,280|\n| 1873 | 18,802| 10\u00b713              | 9,094            | 536               | 688                   | 926       | 12,044|\n| 1874 | 12,674| 9\u00b702               | 8,745            | 496               | 544                   | 1,306     | 11,071|\n| 1875 | 11,448| 7\u00b788               | 7,350            | 767               | 431                   | 1,300     | 9,848 |\n| 1876 | 12,434| 7\u00b725               | 8,200            | 900               | 469                   | 1,010     | 10,645|\n| 1877 | 9,094  | 8\u00b762              | 5,981            | 629               | 495                   | 614       | 7,669 |\n| 1878 | 9,292  | 10\u00b744             | 4,875            | 539               | 531                   | 747       | 6,770 |\n| 1879 | 8,703  | 10\u00b751             | 5,002            | 1,013             | 448                   | 794       | 7,257 |\n| 1880 | 4,880  | 11\u00b773             | 1,038            | 241               | 500                   | 1,258     | 3,122 |\n| 1881 | 3,690  | 16\u00b752             | 277              | 50                | 604                   | 1,332     | 2,323 |\n| 1882 | 4,478  | 14\u00b788             | 211              | 91                | 554                   | 1,386     | 2,242 |\nOn the 13th of August 1877 an arbitration court was established at W\u00e1i, which up to 1883 decided 264 cases or an average of forty-four a year. This court charges a fee of one per cent on suits for less than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) per cent on suits for sums between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 2000), of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent on suits for sums between \u00a3200 and \u00a31000 (Rs. 2000 - Rs. 10,000), and of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) per cent on suits for more than \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). At first this court found considerable favour with the people; but since 1879, owing to the introduction of the conciliation system under the Deccan Agriculturists Relief Act it is not much resorted to.\n\nRegistration has two branches, one under Act III. of 1877 and the other styled village registration under the Deccan Agriculturists\u2019 Relief Act (Act XVII. of 1879). Ordinary registration under Act III. of 1877 employs eleven special or full-time sub-registrars, one being stationed at each subdivisional head-quarters. According to the registration report for 1882-83 the gross receipts for that year under Act III. of 1877 amounted to \u00a3402 (Rs. 4020) and the charges to \u00a3635 (Rs. 6350), thus showing a deficit of \u00a3233 (Rs. 2330). Of 1486, the total number of registrations, 1300 related to immovable property, 149 to movable property, and 37 were wills. Of 1300 documents relating to immovable property 380 were mortgage deeds, 725 deeds of sale, twenty-nine deeds of gift, 128 leases, and thirty-eight miscellaneous deeds. Including \u00a335,634 (Rs. 3,56,340) the value of immovable property transferred, the total value of property affected by registration under Act III. of 1877 amounted to \u00a339,517 (Rs. 3,95,170). Under Act XVII. of 1879, village registration employs fifty-nine village registrars, all of whom are special or full-time officers. In every case a sub-registrar of assurances under Act III. of 1877 is ex-officio a village registrar, and has within the limits of his charge as sub-registrar, a jurisdiction similar to that of other village registrars; he issues registration books to the village registrars of his circle, and embodies in one general form the monthly accounts of the village registrars. In 1882-83 the gross registration receipts under Act XVII. of 1879 amounted to \u00a31072 (Rs. 10,720) and the charges to \u00a31510 (Rs. 15,100), thus leaving a deficit of \u00a3438 (Rs. 4380). Of 36,383, the total number\nof registrations, 23,922 related to immovable property and 12,461 to movable property. Of 23,922 documents relating to immovable property, 11,808 were mortgage deeds, 3347 deeds of sale, eighty-six deeds of gift, 7806 leases, and 875 miscellaneous deeds. Including \u00a3190,680 (Rs. 19,06,800) the value of immovable property transferred, the total value of property affected by registration under Act XVII. of 1879 amounted to \u00a3270,330 (Rs. 27,03,300). Owing to the introduction of village registration under Act XVII. of 1879, registration under Act III. of 1877 has considerably fallen. Compared with the figures of 1879, the year previous to the working of Act XVII. of 1879, the 1882 registration figures under Act III. of 1877 show a fall of 6462 in registered documents, of \u00a31433 (Rs. 14,330) in fees received, and of \u00a3153,879 (Rs. 15,38,790) in the value of property affected by registration. Under Act XVII. of 1879 a special officer styled the inspector of village registry offices examines the village registry offices. Over both branches of registration, in addition to supervision by the Collector as District Registrar, a special scrutiny under the control of the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps is carried on by the divisional inspector.\n\nDuring the calendar year 1883, seventy-seven village registrars appointed under the Deccan Agriculturists\u2019 Relief Act of 1879 registered 20,331 documents; fifty-nine conciliators disposed of 18,198 applications and under sections 44 and 45 of the Act forwarded 3020 agreements to courts; twenty-one village munsifs decided 276 cases; and under chapter II of the Act eleven sub-judges decided 1648 cases.\n\nAt present (1883) thirty-nine officers share the administration of criminal justice. Of these six, including the District Magistrate, are magistrates of the first class and thirty-three are magistrates of the second and third classes. Of the magistrates of the first class three are covenanted civilians and three called deputy collectors are uncovenanted civil officers. The District Magistrate has a general supervision of the whole district, and, except the huzur deputy collector who has charge of the city and station of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, each of the other four first class magistrates has an average charge of 1247 square miles and 265,480 people. In 1883 the District Magistrate decided no original cases but only three appeals, and the other five first class magistrates decided 360 original cases. Besides these, three of the first class magistrates, who are invested with appellate powers, decided seventy-three appeals against the decisions of the second and third class magistrates. Two of these magistrates have also divisional magistrates\u2019 powers. Of the thirty-three second and third class magistrates four are Europeans and twenty-nine Natives. Of these Native magistrates four are honorary magistrates who decided 132 cases, eleven as head-clerks to m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs have no separate charges, and the remaining fourteen, eleven m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs and three mah\u00e1lkaris, have each an average charge of 356 square miles and 75,851 people. In 1883 these magistrates decided 2305 original criminal cases. Besides their magisterial duties these magistrates exercise revenue powers as m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs, mah\u00e1lkaris, and head-clerks of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs. Besides\nChapter IX.\n\nJustice.\n\nthese, of 1356 village headmen who have petty magisterial powers seven under section 15 of the Bombay Village Police Act (Act VIII. of 1867) can in certain cases fine up to 10s. (Rs. 5); the others, under section 14, cannot fine and can imprison for only twenty-four hours.\n\nVillage Police.\n\nThere is no regular village police; the revenue headman or p\u0101t\u012bl as a rule performs the duties of a police headman. His office is generally hereditary and his pay is in proportion to the land revenue of the village under his charge. The headman is assisted by watchmen who are paid either in land or both in land and cash. Besides by Government, watchmen are paid by the people in grain as baluta, and travellers also pay them certain fees for watching their property at night. Of 1344 village watchmen 1138 are Rakhv\u00e1ld\u00e1rs in all the sub-divisions, 157 Sanadis in T\u00e1sgaon, forty-one Shetsandis in V\u00e1lva, and eight M\u00e1ngs in J\u00e1vli and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra has no Mh\u00e1r or J\u00e1glia watchmen. The police headman is directly under the District Magistrate, and his nomination and dismissal rest with the Divisional Commissioner.\n\nCriminal Classes.\n\nThe chief classes given to thieving are R\u00e1moshis and M\u00e1ngs who are found in large numbers in the district. Formerly under the Mar\u00e1tha and Peshwa Government when every Mar\u00e1tha was a freebooter, R\u00e1moshis and M\u00e1ngs were generally in charge of the hill-forts and their depredations were winked at. Latterly under the R\u00e1ja\u2019s rule (1818-1849), to put a stop to their midnight maraudings the able-bodied men among R\u00e1moshis and M\u00e1ngs were made to sleep every night at the village office or ch\u00e1vdi. Under British rule from 1849, instead of making them sleep at night at the village office, R\u00e1moshis and M\u00e1ngs have been mustered thrice every night, allowing all except those who have been convicted, to rest at home.\n\nPolice, 1882.\n\nIn the year 1882 the total strength of the district or regular police force was 953. Of these, under the District Superintendent, two were subordinate officers, 175 inferior subordinate officers, and eighteen mounted and 758 foot constables. The cost of maintaining this force was for the Superintendent a total yearly salary of \u00a3904 14s. (Rs. 9047); for the subordinate officers on yearly salaries of not less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200), and the inferior subordinate officers on yearly salaries of less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200), a total yearly cost of \u00a34328 12s. (Rs. 43,286), and for the foot and mounted constables a cost of \u00a37400 10s. (Rs. 74,005). Besides their pay a total sum of \u00a3270 (Rs. 2700) was yearly allowed for the horse and travelling allowances of the Superintendent; \u00a3443 (Rs. 4430) for the pay and travelling allowance of his establishment; \u00a3217 14s. (Rs. 2177) for the horse and travelling allowances of subordinate officers; and \u00a31556 6s. (Rs. 15,563) a year for contingencies and petty charges. Thus the total yearly cost of maintaining the police force amounted to \u00a315,120 16s. (Rs. 15,1208). For an area of 4792 square miles and a population of 1,062,350 these figures give one constable for every 5.02 square miles and 1113 people, and a cost of \u00a33 3s. (Rs. 31\u00bd) to the square mile or 3\u00bdd. (2\u00bd as.) to each head of the population. Of the total strength of 953 exclusive of the Superintendent, twenty-nine, three officers and twenty-six men, were in 1882 employed as guards at district, central, or subsidiary\njails; seventy-six, twelve of them officers and sixty-four men were engaged as guards over treasuries and lock-ups, or as escorts to prisoners and treasure; 752,143 of them officers and 609 men, were employed on other duties in the district; and ninety-six men were stationed in towns, municipalities, and cantonments. Of the whole number, exclusive of the Superintendent, 597 were provided with firearms and 332 with swords or with swords and batons; and twenty-four were provided with batons only; 808 of whom 107 were officers and 201 men, could read and write; and 127 of whom thirty were officers and ninety-seven men, were under instruction.\n\nExcept the Superintendent who was a European, the members of the police force were all natives of India. Of these fifty-four officers and 185 men were Muhammadans, ten officers and twelve men Brahmins, nine officers and thirteen men Rajputs, one man a Prabhu, 101 officers and 523 men Marathas, two officers and three men Jains and Lingayats, thirty-five men Hindus of other castes, one officer and three men Parsis and Jews, and one officer and one man Christians.\n\nThe returns for the nine years ending 1882 show a total of 162 murders and attempts to murder, twenty-eight culpable homicides, 219 cases of grievous hurt, 355 gang and other robberies, and 41,229 other offences. During these nine years the total number of offences gave a yearly average of 4666 or one offence for every 228 of the population. The returns show that during the famine year of 1877 the total number of offences was large, being 5912 or about twenty-five per cent more than the average. The number of murders varied from thirteen in 1879 to twenty-six in 1882 and averaged eighteen; culpable homicides varied from one in three years to eight in 1878 and averaged three; cases of grievous hurt varied from thirteen in 1878 to thirty-five in 1874 and averaged twenty-four; gang and other robberies varied from sixteen in 1875 to sixty-five in 1877 and averaged thirty-nine; and other offences varied from 3586 in 1874 to 6025 in 1880 and averaged 4581. Of the whole number of persons arrested the convictions varied from thirty-six per cent in 1874 to sixty per cent in 1877 and averaged forty-eight per cent. The percentage of stolen property recovered varied from twenty-five in 1879 to seventy-one in 1881 and averaged forty-three.

The number of convicts in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra jail on the 31st of December 1882 was eighty-four of whom sixty were males and twenty-four females. During the year 1883, 297 convicts of whom 250 were males and forty-seven females, were admitted, and 311, of whom 258 were males and fifty-three females, were discharged. During the year the daily average of prisoners was seventy-eight and at the close of the year the number of convicts was seventy-seven of whom fifty-nine were males and eighteen females. Of the 297 convicts admitted during the year 217 males and thirty-eight females were sentenced for not more than one year, twelve males and three females were for over one year and not more than two years; seven males and three females were for more than two years and not more than five years; and seven males and two females were under sentence of transportation and seven males and one female were sentenced to death. The total yearly cost of diet was \u00a3134 2s. (Rs. 1341) or an average of \u00a31 12s. 9d. (Rs. 16\u00bd) to each prisoner.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nFINANCE.\n\nThe earliest balance-sheet of the district as at present constituted is for 1875-76.\\(^1\\) Exclusive of \u00a375,917 (Rs. 7,59,170) the adjustment on account of alienated lands, the total transactions entered in the district balance-sheet for 1882-83 amounted under receipts to \u00a3337,172 (Rs. 33,71,720) against \u00a3298,563 (Rs. 29,85,680) in 1875-76, and under charges to \u00a3323,092 (Rs. 32,30,920) against \u00a3293,754 (Rs. 29,37,540). Leaving aside departmental miscellaneous receipts and payments in return for services rendered, such as post and telegraph receipts, the revenue for 1882-83 under all heads, Imperial, provincial, local, and municipal, came to \u00a3227,403 (Rs. 22,74,030),\\(^2\\) or on a population of 1,062,350, an individual share of 4s. 3d. (Rs. 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). During the last eight years the following changes have taken place under the chief heads of receipts and charges.\n\nLand revenue receipts which form 72.59 per cent of the entire district revenue, have fallen from \u00a3156,468 (Rs. 15,64,680) to \u00a3154,790 (Rs. 15,47,900), and charges from \u00a332,529 (Rs. 3,25,290) to \u00a327,197 (Rs. 2,71,970). The decrease both in receipts and charges in 1882-83 is chiefly due to the transfer of M\u00e1l\u015biras to Shol\u00e1pur, whose collections and charges from 1st April to 25th July 1875 stand included in those for 1875-76; the decrease in charges is also partly due to the transfer to the police head in 1882-83 of the charges on account of the village officers performing police duties.\\(^3\\)\n\nStamp receipts have fallen from \u00a322,291 (Rs. 2,22,910) to \u00a312,394 (Rs. 1,23,940) and charges from \u00a3683 (Rs. 6830) to \u00a3391 (Rs. 3910).\n\nIn 1882-83 the excise revenue amounted to \u00a36882 (Rs. 68,820) and charges to \u00a3864 (Rs. 8640). Of 108 shops eighteen are licensed to sell Europe liquor, fifty-six to sell country spirit and thirty-four to sell intoxicating drugs. In 1882-83 of the eighteen shops licensed to sell Europe liquor one paid a yearly fee of \u00a310 (Rs. 100), thirteen of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) each, and each of the other four shops temporarily opened at fairs paid a daily fee of 2s. (Rs. 1). In 1882-83 the revenue from this source amounted to \u00a376 14s. (Rs. 767). The yearly import of Europe and other foreign liquor averages 1077 gallons, of which about 855 gallons are locally used. At the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra central distillery built in 1878 at a cost of \u00a32365 12s. (Rs. 23,656) the farmer under Government supervision makes spirit from mahuda or flowers of the Bassia latifolia and supplies it to all district shops. The mahuda flowers are brought from Gujar\u00e1t and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The last territorial change was the transfer of M\u00e1l\u015biras to Shol\u00e1pur in August 1875.\n\n\\(^2\\) This total includes the following items: \u00a3172,971 land revenue, excise, assessed taxes, and forest; \u00a314,237 stamps, justice, and registration; \u00a3904 education and police; \u00a339,291 local and municipal funds; total \u00a3227,403.\n\n\\(^3\\) The land revenue collected in each of the twenty years ending the 31st March 1882, is given above under The Land.\nChapter X. Finance. Excise.\n\nCentral India. In 1882-83 from the central distillery 16,440 gallons of spirit of 25\u00b0 under proof, that is under London proof, were sold, paying a still-head duty of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) a gallon. The highest selling price was 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) a gallon. The revenue from toddy is comparatively small. Of the thirty-four shops licensed to sell intoxicating drugs twenty-nine were for bh\u00e1ng and g\u00e1nja or drinking and smoking hemp; four for m\u00e1jum, that is bh\u00e1ng with sugar and spices formed into cakes; and one for pendha, that is spices mixed with bh\u00e1ng and boiled in clarified butter. In 1882-83 the revenue from this source amounted to \u00a3249 (Rs. 2490). To prevent smuggling the excise management of the five S\u00e1t\u00e1ra states, Bhar, Phaltan, Aundh, Jath, and Daphl\u00e1pur, has been placed in the hands of the Collector, the chiefs receiving yearly compensation at fixed rates. The excise management of these states is conducted on exactly the same principles as that of the district.\n\nLaw and Justice. Receipts, chiefly fines, have fallen from \u00a31382 (Rs. 13,820) to \u00a31034 (Rs. 10,340), and the charges have risen from \u00a319,889 (Rs. 1,98,890) to \u00a320,647 (Rs. 2,06,470). The increase in charges is due to the additional staff sanctioned for the service of judicial processes in subordinate courts.\n\nForest. Forest receipts have risen from \u00a33897 (Rs. 38,970) to \u00a35756 (Rs. 57,560) and charges from \u00a31825 (Rs. 18,250) to \u00a35246 (Rs. 52,460). The increase in charges is due to the increased cost of establishment and to payment of compensation for lands taken for forests.\n\nAssessed Taxes. The following table shows, exclusive of the recoveries from official salaries, the amounts realized from assessed taxes levied from 1860-61 to 1882-83. Owing to the variety of rates and incidence it is difficult to make any satisfactory comparison of the results:\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| Income Tax | \u00a3        |\n| 1860-61 | 13,234 |\n| 1861-62 | 19,515 |\n| 1862-63 | 11,030 |\n| 1863-64 | 7542   |\n| 1864-65 | 1280   |\n| 1865-66 | 1125   |\n| 1866-67 | 3296   |\n\nPost. Post receipts have risen from \u00a33734 (Rs. 37,340) to \u00a37398 (Rs. 73,980), and charges from \u00a37394 (Rs. 73,940) to \u00a328,327 (Rs. 2,83,270). The increase both in receipts and charges is chiefly due to the transfer of the money order business to the postal department.\n\nTelegraph. Telegraph receipts have risen from \u00a3306 (Rs. 3060) to \u00a3779 (Rs. 7790) and charges from \u00a3412 (Rs. 4120) to \u00a3645 (Rs. 6450).\n\nRegistration. Registration receipts have fallen from \u00a34426 (Rs. 44,260) to \u00a3809 (Rs. 8090), and charges have risen from \u00a31185 (Rs. 11,850) to \u00a31548.\n\n1 The alcoholic strength of liquor is denoted by degrees over or under the standard of London proof which is taken at 100 degrees. Thus 25\u00b0 U. P., that is under proof, is equivalent to 75 degrees of strength; 60\u00b0 U. P. is equivalent to 40 degrees of strength; and 25\u00b0 O. P. or over proof, is equivalent to 125 degrees of strength.\n(S. 15,480). Before the 1st of April 1871, the registration receipts and charges were shown under law and justice.\n\nPolice receipts have risen from \u00a369 (Rs. 690) to \u00a3466 (Rs. 4660) and charges from \u00a315,433 (Rs. 1,54,330) to \u00a317,556 (Rs. 1,75,560).\n\nEducation receipts have risen from \u00a3399 (Rs. 3990) to \u00a3438 (Rs. 4380), and charges from \u00a31343 (Rs. 13,430) to \u00a31910 (Rs. 19,100).\n\nTransfer receipts have risen from \u00a392,826 (Rs. 9,28,260) to \u00a3123,945 (Rs. 12,39,450) and owing to a fall in cash remittances charges have fallen from \u00a386,603 (Rs. 8,66,030) to \u00a365,450 (Rs. 6,54,500).\n\nIn the following balance-sheet of 1875-76 and 1882-83, the figures shown in black type on both sides represent book adjustments. On the receipt side the items of \u00a375,260 (Rs. 7,52,600) and \u00a375,917 (Rs. 7,59,170) represent the additional revenue the district would yield had none of its land been alienated.

The local fund revenue is derived from three sources, a special cess of one-sixteenth in addition to the ordinary land-tax, the proceeds of certain subordinate local funds, and certain miscellaneous items. The special land cess, of which two-thirds are set apart as a road fund and the rest as a school fund, yielded in 1882-83 a revenue of \u00a313,244 (Rs. 1,32,440). The subordinate funds including a ferry fund, a toll fund, a travellers\u2019 bungalow fund and a cattle-pound fund yielded \u00a31998 (Rs. 19,980). Government and private contributions amounted to \u00a32388 (Rs. 23,880) and miscellaneous receipts including certain items of land revenue and school fees to \u00a31289 (Rs. 12,890) or a total sum of \u00a318,919 (Rs. 1,89,190). This revenue is administered by committees composed partly of officials and partly of private members. The district committee consists of the Collector, assistant and deputy collectors, the executive engineer and the educational inspector as official and the proprietor of an alienated village, and six landholders as non-official members. The sub-divisional committees consist of an assistant collector, the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r, a public works officer, and the deputy educational inspector as official, and the proprietor of an alienated village and three landholders as non-official members. The sub-divisional committees bring their local requirements to the notice of the district committee who prepare the yearly budget.\n\nFor administrative purposes the local funds of the district are divided into two main sections, one set apart for public works and the other for instruction. During 1882-83 the receipts and disbursements under these two heads were as follows:\n\n**S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Local Funds, 1882-83.**\n\n### PUBLIC WORKS.\n\n| RECEIPTS | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Balance  | \u00a3635   |\n| Two-thirds of Land Cess | 8823 |\n| Ferry    | 208    |\n| Cattle-pounds | 490 |\n| Rest-houses | 47 |\n| Contributions | 439 |\n| Tolls    | 1294   |\n| Miscellaneous | 243 |\n\nTotal | 18,345\n\n| CHARGES | Amount |\n|---------|--------|\n| Establishment | \u00a3710 |\n| Public Works | 4526 |\n| Repairs     | 5958 |\n| Medical     | 646   |\n| Miscellaneous | 2300 |\n| Balance     | 4275 |\n\nTotal | 18,345\n\n### INSTRUCTION.\n\n| RECEIPTS | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Balance  | \u00a3846   |\n| One-third of Land Cess | 4415 |\n| School-fee Fund | 1042 |\n| Contributions | 1776 |\n| Municipal and Private | 174 |\n| Miscellaneous | 4 |\n\nTotal | 11,056\n\n| CHARGES | Amount |\n|---------|--------|\n| School Charges | \u00a36378 |\n| Scholarships | 30 |\n| School-houses | 1642 |\n| Miscellaneous | 126 |\n| Balance | 2850 |\n\nTotal | 11,056\nSince 1863-64 the following local fund works have been carried out: To improve communications, about 620 miles of road have been either made or repaired, bridged, and planted with trees at a cost of about \u00a3132,308 (Rs. 13,28,080) and \u00a346,018 (Rs. 4,60,180) have been paid by the local funds as contributions towards Imperial repairs. To improve the water-supply about 139 wells, seventy-six reservoirs, and five tanks have been either made or repaired at a cost of about \u00a327,420 (Rs. 2,74,200) and sixty-one cattle pounds have been made or repaired. To help village instruction about 222 schools have been either built or repaired at a cost of about \u00a316,359 (Rs. 1,63,590). For the comfort of travellers 263 rest-houses or dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s, 114 village offices or ch\u00e1vdis, and eight travellers' bungalows have been either built or repaired at a cost of about \u00a314,770 (Rs. 1,47,700).\n\nIn 1882-83, of the thirteen municipalities one each was at Ashta, Isl\u00e1mpur, Kar\u00e1d, M\u00e1yni, Malcolmpeith, Mhasvad, Puses\u00e1vli, Rahimatpur, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Shingn\u00e1pur, T\u00e1sgaon, Vita, and W\u00e1i. They were administered by a body of commissioners with the Collector as president and the assistant or deputy collector in charge of the subdivision as vice-president. In 1882-83 the district municipal revenue amounted to \u00a320,372 (Rs. 2,03,720), of which \u00a34560 (Rs. 45,600) were recovered from octroi dues, \u00a31203 (Rs. 12,030) from a house-tax, \u00a3577 (Rs. 5770) from a toll and wheel tax, \u00a3486 (Rs. 4860) from assessed taxes, and \u00a313,543 (Rs. 1,35,460), including \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) on account of a loan raised by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra municipality for the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra water-works, were from other sources.

Of these one was a deputy educational inspector with general charge over all the schools of the district drawing a yearly pay of \u00a3210 (Rs. 2100), one an assistant deputy educational inspector drawing a yearly pay of \u00a360 (Rs. 600), and the rest were masters and assistant masters with yearly salaries ranging from \u00a354 (Rs. 540) to \u00a36 (Rs. 60).\n\nExcluding superintendence and building charges, the total expenditure on account of these schools amounted to \u00a37076 (Rs. 70,760) of which \u00a32448 (Rs. 24,480) were paid by Government and \u00a34628 (Rs. 46,280) by local and other funds.\n\nOf 248, the total number of Government schools, one was a high school teaching English and Sanskrit up to the matriculation standard, four were anglo-veracular schools teaching English and Marathi, and the remaining 243 were vernacular schools, of which 238 were boys schools and five girls schools.\n\nBesides the 248 Government schools sixty-three private schools in the states of Bhor, Phaltan, Aundh, and Jath were under Government inspection. Of these three, one each in Bhor Phaltan and Jath were second grade anglo-veracular schools with ninety-five names on the rolls and an average attendance of forty-nine; fifty-six were boys Marathi schools with 2326 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 2194; and four were girls schools with 133 names on the rolls and an average attendance of seventy-six. Besides these there were three important private schools at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, an English school, an American Mission Marathi school, and a Sanskrit school. The English school was started in 1878-79 by Mr. Bh\u00e1skar Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m Purohit, a matriculated student of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra high school. In 1882 it was attended by about 150 boys. The American Mission school was started in 1834 by Mrs. Graves of the American Mission. From 1834 to 1849 the school was held every year during the fair season at Mah\u00e1baleshvar and during the\nrains it was removed to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Since 1849 when the Reverend William Wood of the American Mission settled permanently at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, the school has been held throughout the year at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1882-83 it was attended by about twenty-two boys and eight girls. In the Sanskrit school which was started about fifty years ago by Bh\u00e1skar Sh\u00e1stri, Sanskrit grammar and literature are taught to Br\u00e1hman boys. In 1882 this school was attended by about twenty-five pupils.\n\nIn 1855-56 there were only twenty-five vernacular and one anglo-vernacular schools in the district with 1834 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 1383 pupils. In 1865-66 the number of schools had risen to 104 with 6100 names and an average attendance of 4917. Of these schools including one for girls 103 were vernacular and one anglo-vernacular schools. In 1875-76 the number had further risen to 223 with 11,511 names and an average attendance of 9069.

The two libraries are at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Mah\u00e1baleshvar. In 1852 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra city had two libraries, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra city library and the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra station library. In February 1866 both these libraries were amalgamated under the name of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra city library. This\nlibrary owns a nice building which was given to it by the widow of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, the last R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1882-83 the number of subscribers was 107 and subscriptions amounted to about \u00a388 (Rs. 880). At present (1883) the library has 1761 English Mar\u00e1thi and Sanskrit books. Including the two English dailies of Bombay, the library takes eighteen English and twelve Mar\u00e1thi papers and pamphlets. The Mah\u00e1baleshvar library is located in a room in the Frere Hall and is supported by European visitors to the station.

In 1882-83 the six reading-rooms were one each at Ashta, Kar\u00e1d, Malcolmpeth, T\u00e1sgaon, V\u00edta, and W\u00e1i. Of these the reading-rooms at Malcolmpeth and V\u00edta have their own buildings built by raising subscriptions. The reading-rooms are all supported by educated natives. In 1882-83 the number of subscribers varied from eleven to thirty-two and the amount of yearly subscriptions varied from \u00a311 6s. (Rs. 113) to \u00a323 10s. (Rs. 235).

The charges incurred on account of prizes and notifications are paid by subscriptions raised from the members of the elocution society.\n\nIn 1882-83, of the three newspapers published in the district the Shubh-Suchak or Good Indicator was started in 1858. It is lithographed and written in Mar\u00e1thi. The other two are the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra Mitra or the Friend of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra started in 1868 and the Bodh Sudh\u00e1kar or the Moon of Knowledge started in 1872. Both are printed generally in Mar\u00e1thi, but they have occasional contributions in English.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe S\u00e1t\u00e1ra climate is a marked change from the moist and relaxing Konkan. It is best suited to the nervous, the simply debilitated and the relaxed, to the dyspeptic, and to those affected with chronic bronchitis. It is liable to aggravate or render more acute fever and head derangements by constricting the surface vessels and forcing inwards an increased flow of blood. The increased flow of blood congests and obstructs the organs which have been weakened by disease or climate. These adverse conditions are limited to the dry season, or at least are considerably modified during the soft mild and damp south-west monsoon. The rains seem specially suited to Europeans. While they last severe disorders are unusual, the prevailing complaints being slight fevers and chest and bowel complaints. Among the natives rheumatic and neuralgic affections are common and obstinate; Europeans are comparatively free from them.\n\nBesides the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra civil hospital and the Mah\u00e1baleshvar convalescent hospital, there were in 1882 seven grants-in-aid dispensaries one each at W\u00e1i, Kar\u00e1d, Isl\u00e1mpur, Puses\u00e1vli, Mhasvad, P\u00e1tan, and T\u00e1sgaon. The total number of patients treated during the year was 41,976 of whom 41,499 were out-patients and 477 in-patients. The total cost was \u00a32498 (Rs. 24,980). The following details are taken from the 1882 report:\n\nThe S\u00e1t\u00e1ra civil hospital was established in 1840 by \u00c1ppa S\u00e1heb the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. For the hospital a separate building has been provided, within whose walls are included for distinct departments, a general hospital for the sick natives who are supported free of charge; a police hospital for the sick members of the district police force; a ward for the treatment of female patients; and a dispensary for out-door patients who are supplied with medicine and advice free of charge. The hospital is under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon who has under him two hospital assistants and two apprentices. In 1874 the vaccine establishment attached to the hospital was removed vaccination being now performed under the supervision of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra municipality. In 1882 the commonest diseases treated were malarious fevers, intestinal worms, skin diseases, stomach and bowel affections, and eye-diseases. In 1882 cholera prevailed to a very considerable extent in the whole district and out of 5433 cases 2374 deaths were reported. 6818 out-patients and 357 in-patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3517 (Rs. 5170).\nAt the Mah\u00e1baleshvar convalescent hospital was opened in 1828. The commonest diseases were parasitic diseases, constipation, ague, scabies, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, and chronic rheumatism.

Of these dhundulna generally attacks young cattle causing excessive purging. The liver of the cattle affected becomes diseased and their dung emits a bad smell. In about eight days the animal dies. Gh\u00e1tia generally attacks strong young cattle. The windpipe becomes choked, the belly swells, and the mouth is inflamed. From the neck to the liver blood becomes watery and the liver is found after death to be full of small holes. In about eight days the animal dies. K\u00e1lidhaveri is a more fatal disease causing death in one day; the liver of the animal attacked with it rots and becomes perforated. In kuli the mouth and feet show rheumatic symptoms and in one or two days the animal dies. Ldl generally attacks weak cattle about January when the east wind sets in. The feet rot, worms are generated in the intestines, and the hoofs fall off. The mouth also rots and a viscous fluid flows from it. The disease lasts about a month. In m\u00e1nmodya the animal tosses its head towards the side attacked; this disease lasts about four days. In m\u0101theusul the animal walks round and round and refuses food; its flesh becomes yellow and watery. In phodya boils as on the human skin appear and blood and flesh seem diseased; the disease lasts from four to eight days. In patki the animal is excessively purged and the stomach becomes diseased. Either the animal dies in one to four days, or it recovers after seven days. In thorla the eye sheds water and the animal trembles, refuses food, and is purged. Either the animal dies in three days or it recovers after one month. Ch\u00e1ndni, palkida, and pashan attack horses only. Haladya only attacks kids who pass urine mixed with blood; through the circulation the skin and every organ become tinged with yellow. In cases of topshya sheep and goats are suddenly attacked and die in one or two days; the stomach becomes diseased.\n\nIn May 1882, of about 250 cattle at P\u00e1nchgani in W\u00e1i sixty-five were attacked by rinderpest, of which fifty died. About this cattle plague the Veterinary Surgeon Mr. H. A. Woodroffe reported as follows:\u00b9 Rinderpest is a contagious fever depending upon a blood poison which has its specific effect upon the membrane lining the alimentary canal, extending from the mouth to the rectum. Unlike foot and mouth disease which affects all animals without any regard to species, rinderpest generally confines its attacks to buffaloes cows and bullocks, and is extremely fatal; but when recovery does take place the animal is rendered insusceptible to another attack. The disease probably originates from bad sanitary arrangements, such as foul air arising from overcrowding animals in dirty little huts without any provision whatever for drainage or ventilation. The first signs of the malady visible to the ordinary observer are dulness, loss of appetite, staring coat accompanied by shivering fits. About the second day there is a discharge from the eyes and nostrils, the former presenting a highly reddened appearance. There is also a slight dry cough, and breathing becomes slightly\n\n\u00b9 Gov. Res. Gen. Dept. 2062 of 3rd June 1882.\noppressed. The mouth on examination will be found intensely hot. The gums, at first red, assume a yellowish or salmon colour, the tongue is covered with an eruption which in the early stages of the disease appears in the form of little red nodules often presenting a bran-like appearance. As the disease progresses, sores appear on the palate and the back of the tongue. At this stage of the disease rumination is generally suspended, and the animal refuses all food, can only drink water with great difficulty and seems greatly distressed, frequently lying down and getting up again, and may be seen anxiously looking round at its flanks. After about the third or fourth day the bowels which have been costive during the early stages, become relaxed, and violent diarrhoea sets in accompanied by copious discharge of mucus frequently tinged with blood. These symptoms cause great suffering and may continue from three to five days. As a general rule the animal dies about the sixth or seventh day after being attacked. As death approaches the breath becomes very offensive and not unfrequently the animal dies in a state of delirium. After death the rumen or first stomach is found to contain a large quantity of undigested food and the membrane lining the fourth or true stomach to be covered with patches of a deep claret colour. The small intestines are very red and inflamed and in the large intestines the same patches may be observed as were found in the fourth stomach. The liver is rather paler than usual and the gall bladder is usually full of bile. There is generally more or less emphysema of the lungs and the membrane lining the windpipe presents a reddened appearance. The disease being of a specific nature must run its course terminating fatally or otherwise according to the intensity of the attack, and medicinal treatment is of no avail. To stamp out the malady six sanitary and preventive measures are suggested. A temporary enclosure should be set apart where all animals on first showing symptoms of the disease must be isolated. Sheds or cow-houses in which the disease has appeared should be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected with ordinary limewash made of freshly burnt lime, each gallon to contain one-fifth of a pint of commercial carbolic acid. All dung and litter which has been in contact with diseased animals must be burnt. Carcasses of animals that have died of the disease should be slashed and buried six feet deep. Animals that have been in close contact with diseased ones should be prevented from mixing with other cattle for nine days. Cattle traffic between infected and noninfected villages should be discouraged and fairs suspended for the time.\n\nThe total number of deaths shown in the Sanitary Commissioner's yearly reports for the eighteen years ending 1883 is 437,832 or an average mortality of 24,324 or, according to the 1881 census, of twenty-three in every thousand of the population. During the famine year of 1877 the total number of deaths was very high, being 52,033 or 114 per cent above the average. Of the average number of deaths 15,821 or 65\u00b704 per cent were returned as due to fevers, 1917 or 7\u00b788 per cent to cholera, 536 or 2\u00b720 per cent to small-pox, 2712 or 11\u00b715 per cent to bowel complaints, 357\nor 1\u00b747 per cent to violence or injury, and 2981 or 12\u00b726 per cent to miscellaneous diseases. An examination of the returns shows that fever, which during the eighteen years ending 1883 caused an average mortality of 15,821 or 65\u00b704 per cent, was below the average in nine years and above the average in the other nine years. During the ten years ending 1875, except in 1872, it was below the average and during the eight years ending 1883 besides in 1872 it was above the average. Of the nine years below the average, two years had less than 10,000 deaths, 8250 in 1867 and 9111 in 1868; three years 1866, 1869, and 1870 had between 10,000 and 11,000; one year 1871 had between 11,000 and 12,000; and three years 1873, 1874 and 1875 had between 14,000 and 15,800. Of the nine years above the average two years 1876 and 1882 had between 16,000 and 17,000 deaths; five years 1872, 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1883 between 17,000 and 18,000; one year 1878 between 27,000 and 28,000; and one year 1877 between 31,000 and 32,000. Of the deaths from cholera which amounted to 34,508 and averaged 1917, 8157 or 23\u00b764 per cent of the total happened in 1869, 6702 or 19\u00b742 per cent in 1877, and 5886 or 15\u00b760 per cent in 1878. The only other years above the average were 1875 with 3666 deaths, 1882 with 2406 deaths, and 1876 with 1938 deaths. Of the twelve years below the average one year 1872 had between 1700 and 1600; two years 1866 and 1883 had between 1200 and 1100 deaths; one year 1881 had between 900 and 800; two years 1868 and 1870 between 660 and 560; one year 1871 between 200 and 100; two years 1867 and 1880 had less than forty; and three years 1873, 1874 and 1879 were free from cholera. Of the deaths from small-pox, which amounted to 9654 and averaged 536, 2518 or 26\u00b708 per cent of the total happened in 1872, 2079 or 21\u00b753 per cent in 1869, and 1896 or 19\u00b764 per cent in 1868. The only other years above the average were 1877 with 950 deaths and 1873 with 594 deaths. Of the thirteen years below the average two years 1867 and 1883 had between 400 and 300 deaths; three years 1870, 1871, and 1876 between 300 and 200; one year 1874 between 100 and seventy; three years 1866, 1875, and 1878 between fifty and twenty; three years 1879, 1880, and 1882 had less than five deaths; and one year 1881 was free from small-pox. Of the deaths from bowel complaints which amounted to 48,814 and averaged 2712, seven years were above the average. The smallest number of deaths from bowel complaints in any one of the eighteen years was 1117 in 1871 and the largest was 7796 in 1877. Injuries with a total of 6426 and an average of 357, varied from 488 in 1877 to 225 in 1868. Other causes with a total mortality of 53,653 and an average of 2981, varied from 4542 in 1877 to 2016 in 1879.\n\nBirth returns are available only for the thirteen years ending 1883. During these thirteen years the number of births averaged 29,337. The yearly totals vary from 41,497 in 1882 to 18,725 in 1878.

It has an area of 419 square miles, a population in 1881 of 63,729 or 152 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a39702 (Rs. 97,020).\n\nOf the 419 square miles, 390 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns 106 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 116,062 acres or 57\u00b785 per cent of arable land, 7612 acres or 3\u00b780 per cent of unarable land, 64,540 acres or 32\u00b717 per cent of forests, and 12,394 acres or 6\u00b718 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 116,062 acres of arable land 21,890 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nJa'vli is full of hills. At Mah\u00e1baleshvar in the north-west the three valleys of the Koyna, the Krishna, and the Vena run to a point where their great dividing spurs, which rise 2500 feet above the valleys, meet the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dria. Though they are alike in general character, of the three valleys the Koyna valley is much the largest and finest. Near the head of the Koyna valley are the grandest hill and forest views in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Even here there is a sameness in the hills as the sides of all rise in layers to a flat-topped wall of rock. And as the valley bottom is high not less than 2000 feet above the sea, the hill sides want the grandeur of those that fall west into the low rugged Konkan. In the Koyna valley, and to a much less extent in the Krishna and Vena valleys where the forest has not been cut and burnt for kumri or wood-ash tillage, the hills are covered with dense coppice ten to fifteen feet high. Elsewhere the hill sides are a succession of bare red patches of what passes for soil and are thickly dotted with stunted trees. The Koyna valley is at all times beautiful. Even in April the blue haze of smoke from the fired tillage plots softens the hot-weather bakedness of the hills. And after the rains the barest rocks are broidered with the soft dazzling green of moss and grass. Every shadow has a hue of its own and the sunlight striking between masses of floating clouds sheds over the universal green endless varieties of light and shade. Throughout the hot weather the Sahy\u00e1dri tops are deliciously cool.\n\n\u00b9 Of this chapter the aspect, climate, water, and soil sections are contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\nFrom June to October the extreme rainfall, over 250 inches at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, and the high winds and constant driving mists make the climate chilly and trying. At the close of the rains excessive damp and excessive vegetation make the valleys feverish. Later, about Christmas, they are chill, sometimes bitterly cold, and even in the hot weather though the days are warm the nights are cool.\n\nAt Malcolmpeth, the highest point of the Sahy\u00e1dris 4710 feet above sea level and about twenty-eight miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from 312 inches in 1861-62 to 156 inches in 1869-70 and averaged 248 inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from 373 inches in 1882-83 to 168 inches in 1877-78 and averaged 262 inches.\n\nAt Medha, which is about sixteen miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and fourteen miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from seventy-nine inches in 1861-62 to fifty-three inches in 1864-65 and averaged sixty-four inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from 111 inches in 1882-83 to forty-eight inches in 1880-81 and averaged seventy-two inches.\n\nThe two chief rivers are the Vena which joins the Krishna at M\u00e1luli in S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1 and the Koyna which meets the Krishna at Kar\u00e1d. The Koyna and the Vena are fed by numberless smaller streams and rills, which dry after the rains, and during the dry weather even the Koyna and the Vena are deep only in occasional moderate-sized pools. Away from the rivers water is scarce and hardly fit to drink.\n\nIn the valleys are patches of fairly deep red-soil on which rice is grown. The rest of the soil is poor and is for two or three years tilled in kumri or wood-ash fashion with n\u00e1chni and other coarse hill grains and then left to a four to twelve years' rest.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included twenty-three riding and 366 load carts, 4581 two-bullock and 837 four-bullock ploughs, 11,949 bullocks and 10,361 cows, 2405 he-buffaloes and 7125 she-buffaloes, 242 horses, 4683 sheep and goats, and sixty-four asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 5838 with an average area of 19\u00b778 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 2360 were of not more than five acres; 834 of five to ten acres; 834 of ten to twenty acres; 618 of twenty to thirty acres; 421 of thirty to forty acres; 217 of forty to fifty acres; 399 of fifty to a hundred acres; 132 of 100 to 200 acres; 17 of 200 to 300 acres; 4 of 300 to 400 acres; and two of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82, of 93,982 acres held for tillage 54,889 or 58\u00b740 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 39,093 acres, 1050 were twice cropped. Of the 40,143 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 34,711 acres or 86\u00b746 per cent, of which 2325 were under spiked millet bajr\u012b Pennicillaria spicata, 6344 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 10,215 under r\u00e1g\u012b or n\u00e1chni Eleusine corocana, 1051 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 9116 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 3097 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa,\n1088 under Italian millet *r\u00e1la* or *k\u00e1ng* Panicum italicum, 11 under maize *makka* Zea mays, 44 under barley *jav* Hordeum hexastichon, 67 under *kodra* or *harik* Paspalum scrobiculatum, and 1353 under other grains of which details are not given.

Oilseeds occupied 2236 acres or 5\u00b757 per cent, of which 1366 were under gingelly seed *til* Sesamum indicum, 42 under linseed *alshi* Linum usitatissimum, and 828 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 65 acres or 0\u00b716 per cent, of which 57 were under Bombay hemp *san* or *t\u00e1g* Crotalaria juncea, and 8 under other fibres. Miscellaneous crops occupied 545 acres or 1\u00b735 per cent, of which 51 were under chillies *mirchi* Capsicum frutescens, 211 under sugarcane *us* Saccharum officinarum, 7 under tobacco *tamb\u00e1ku* Nicotiana tabacum, 5 under coffee *Coffee arabica*, and the remaining 271 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 63,729 people, 61,518 or 96\u00b753 per cent were Hindus, 1981 or 3\u00b710 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 192 or 0\u00b730 per cent Christians, 35 P\u00e1rsis, and 3 Buddhists.

It has an area of 391 square miles, a population in 1881 of 140,920 or 360 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a334,893 (Rs. 3,48,930).\n\nOf the 391 square miles, 355 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns 81 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 148,985 acres or 74\u00b795 per cent of arable land, 7408 acres or 3\u00b773 per cent of unarable land, 993 acres or 0\u00b750 per cent of grass, 29,823 acres or 15\u00b760 per cent of forests, and 11,572 acres or 5\u00b782 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 148,985 acres of arable land 33,783 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\nKar\u00e1d is a portion of the Krishna valley which runs thirty miles from north to south between two parallel chains of hills. The western chain is broken half-way by the Koyna, which, running from the west, joins the Krishna at Kar\u00e1d. Most of Kar\u00e1d is flat sloping to the hills on both sides, the ground growing more broken especially on the west as it nears the hills. There are no forests but many gardens and groves, and in the Krishna for a tract so close to the Sahy\u00e1dris the unusual charm of numbers of pools or rivers reaches several miles long. Much of the land is of extreme richness, covered with green not only during and after the rain but again with cold-weather crops in January and February. A bridle path from the plateau of Kadegaon down to the village of Tembhu to the south of Sad\u00e1shivgad fort has lovely views of the rich Kar\u00e1d plain, stretching, brightened by water and darkened by groves, in garden after garden to the gray-blue of the western hills.\n\nDuring the cold weather, especially near the rivers, the air varies in warmth from $30^\\circ$ to $35^\\circ$ in the twenty-four hours. The days are warm and the nights are bitterly cold. In the hot weather it is one of the warmest parts of the district. But even then the nights are not unpleasant. At Kar\u00e1d, which is about thirty miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and thirty-two miles south of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from thirty-five inches in 1860-61 and 1867-68 to nineteen inches in 1864-65 and averaged twenty-seven inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from fifty inches in 1882-83 to seventeen inches in 1871-72 and averaged twenty-seven inches.\n\nThe rivers are the Krishna which crosses the sub-division from north to south; the T\u00e1rli which joins the Krishna from the north-west at Umbraj; and the Koyna which joins it from the west at Kar\u00e1d. In addition to the ordinary means of watering by wells and rough dams the Krishna canal starts from a dam thrown across the river at Khodshi, about a mile above Kar\u00e1d, and runs about thirty-five miles to the south-east. Elsewhere the water-supply is good except in the south-west, where, in the rocky soil close under the hills, water is very scarce.\n\nThe soil is excellent throughout, except small patches of murum close to the hills. All round the canal, as well as away from it at Masur and in the T\u00e1rli valley are splendid stretches of garden land.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included ninety-seven riding and 2714 load carts, 1409 two-bullock and 2867 four-bullock ploughs, 29,928 bullocks and 16,436 cows, 2817 he-buffaloes and 10,980 she-buffaloes, 1784 horses, 62,711 sheep and goats, and 436 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 25,371 with an average area of 5.84 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 14,708 were of not more than five acres; 6564 of five to ten acres; 3152 of ten to twenty acres; 831 of twenty to thirty acres; 89 of thirty to forty acres; twenty of forty to fifty acres; five of fifty to a hundred acres; and two of 100 to 200 acres.\nIn 1881-82, of 115,510 acres held for tillage 18,961 or 16\u00b784 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 96,549 acres, 4790 were twice cropped. Of the 101,339 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 76,884 acres or 75\u00b786 per cent of which 22,944 were under spiked millet bajri Penicillaria spicata, 43,470 under Indian millet jowari Sorghum vulgare, 2438 under ragi or nachni Eleusine corocana, 693 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 1495 under chenna sava Panicum miliaceum, 726 under rice bhait Oryza sativa, 2740 under Italian millet rale or kang Panicum italicum, 662 under maize makta Zea mays, 221 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 1495 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 14,126 acres or 13\u00b793 per cent, of which 5020 were under gram karbhara Cicer arietinum, 3226 under tur Cajanus indicus, 2442 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 1148 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 541 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 88 under peas vata na Pisum sativum, and 1661 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 4984 acres or 4\u00b791 per cent, of which 27 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum and 4957 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 710 acres or 0\u00b770 per cent, of which 39 were under cotton kapus Gossypium herbaceum, 376 under Bombay hemp san or lag, Crotalaria juncea, and 295 under other fibres. Miscellaneous crops occupied 4635 acres or 4\u00b757 per cent, of which 1530 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 1303 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 1165 under tobacco tambakhru Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 637 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 140,920 people 135,599 or 96\u00b722 per cent were Hindus, 5315 or 3\u00b777 per cent Musalmans, and 6 Christians. The details of the Hindu castes are: 6727 Br\u00e1hmans; 79 K\u00e1yasth Prabhus and 30 P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Prabhus, writers; 1775 Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, 443 Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1nis, 372 Jains, 182 T\u00e1mbolis, 32 M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, 14 Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, and 2 Komtis, traders and merchants; 83,435 Kunbis and 1609 M\u00e1lis, husbandmen; 2340 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 2179 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather-workers; 2140 Koshtis, weavers; 1494 Shimpis, tailors; 1450 Telis, oil-men; 1227 Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters; 1124 Sal\u00eds, weavers; 993 Son\u00e1s, goldsmiths; 739 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle-makers; 633 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 463 Sangars, wool-weavers; 332 Vad\u00e1rs, earth-diggers; 177 Buruds, bamboo-workers; 72 Beld\u00e1rs, quarrymen; 55 K\u00e1ranjkars, saddle-makers; 28 R\u00e1uls, tape-makers; 23 Ot\u00e1ris, casters; 17 Lon\u00e1ris, cement-makers; 10 Rang\u00e1ris, dyers; 3 Ghis\u00e1dis, tinkers; 2 Kanj\u00e1ris, weaving brush-makers; 1437 Guravs, priests; 137 Hol\u00e1rs, labourers; 50 Ghadsis, musicians; 1821 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 1076 Partis, washermen; 3034 Dhangars, cowmen; 46 Gavlis, cow-keepers; 791 Bhois, fishers; 342 Kolis, ferrymen; 103 Pardeshis, petty traders; 82 Th\u00e1kurs, husbandmen; 1673 R\u00e1moshis, watchmen; 38 Vanj\u00e1ris, husbandmen; 10,740 Mh\u00e1rs, village messengers; 2598 M\u00e1ngs, village watchmen; 200 Dhors, tanners; 4 Bhangis, scavengers; 393 Gos\u00e1vis, 381 Jangams, 176 Joshis, 142 Gondhlis, 53 M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs, 39 Uchl\u00e1s, 15 Chitrakathis, 10 Tirm\u00e1lis, 9 Vaidus, and 8 Bh\u00e1ts, beggars.\n\nKh\u00e1napur in the east is bounded on the north by Khat\u00e1v, on the east by the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division of the Pant Pratinidhi, on the\nsouth by T\u00e1sgaon, and on the west by Kar\u00e1d. It has an area of 509 square miles, a population in 1881 of 80,327 or 157 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a316,632 (Rs. 1,66,320).\n\nOf the 509 square miles, 495 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 100 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 209,540 acres or 79\u00b795 per cent of arable land, 12,746 acres or 4\u00b786 per cent of unarable land, 190 acres or 0\u00b708 per cent of grass, 32,340 acres or 12\u00b734 per cent of forests, and 7253 acres or 2\u00b777 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 209,540 acres of arable land 40,172 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nKh\u00e1n\u00e1pur is an upland 200 to 300 feet above the Kar\u00e1d valley on the west and the great plain of the M\u00e1n on the east. It is a fine rolling country but sparingly wooded except near the feeders of the Yerla which crosses the sub-division from north to south on its way to the Krishna. The banks of these streams are shaded with fine clumps of trees. The country, which is about two hundred and fifty feet above the Krishna valley on the west, slopes gently to the Yerla. To the east of the Yerla water-shed is a deeper valley at Vita. Beyond the Vita valley, a rise of one hundred feet leads to the eastern plateau of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur proper. The Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur upland, in which the Agrani river rises, keeps its high level nearly to the Mahimangad-Pan\u00e1la spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range on the eastern limit. Besides these varieties in height from east to west the country following the course of the Yerla slopes slowly south towards T\u00e1sgaon.\n\nThe climate is fairly temperate except for occasional hot winds from March to the middle of May. The rainfall is scanty and uncertain, varying greatly from year to year and in different parts of the sub-division. At Vita, the head-quarters of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, which is about fifty miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dri crest and forty-five miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from thirty-nine inches in 1862-63 to eleven inches in 1866-67 and averaged twenty-one inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from thirty-four inches in 1878-79 to eleven inches in 1876-77 and averaged twenty-four inches.\n\nExcept the Yerla, which as mentioned runs north and south through the centre of the sub-division, and the Agrani, there are no considerable streams. Besides the ordinary means of watering from wells and streams Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur has the Chikhli canal which stretches five miles from a dam thrown across a feeder of the Yerla at the village of Chikhli. It has also the last mile of the M\u00e1yni canal which waters the lands of the village of M\u00e1huli in the north-east. The ordinary water-supply is often scanty in the hot weather, particularly in the east.\n\nThe soil is either black or gray murum with its intermediate varieties. The black soil, which occurs near rivers, yields first rate crops of jv\u00e1ri, gram, and oilseed. Wheat also is grown both on watered and dry land especially on the eastern plateau. The poorer\nsoils grow both bajri and a late autumn jvari called dukhri, which though a hardy crop requires somewhat better soil than bajri.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included eighty riding and 1433 load carts, 711 two-bullock and 2486 four-bullock ploughs, 25,081 bullocks and 15,153 cows, 3453 he-buffaloes and 7200 she-buffaloes, 1525 horses, 53,097 sheep and goats, and 322 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings, including alienated lands in Government villages was 16,335 with an average area of 12\u00b750 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 4245 were of not more than five acres; 3439 were of five to ten acres; 4914 were of ten to twenty acres; 2663 of twenty to thirty acres; 987 of thirty to forty acres; 80 of forty to fifty acres; 4 of fifty to a hundred acres; two of 100 to 200 acres; and one of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 164,577 acres held for tillage, 24,078 or 14\u00b763 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 140,499 acres, 2058 were twice cropped. Of the 142,557 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 99,554 acres or 69\u00b783 per cent of which 39,254 were under spiked millet bajri Pennisetum spicata, 48,073 under Indian millet jvari Sorghum vulgare, 47 under ragi or nachni Eleusine coracana, 6342 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 1559 under chenna sava Panicum miliaceum, 484 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 1080 under Italian millet rala or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 192 under maize makka Zea mays, 42 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 2472 under other grains of which details are not given.

It has an area of 499 square miles, a population in 1881 of 74,027 or 148 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a315,464 (Rs. 1,54,640).\n\nArea.\n\nOf the 499 square miles, 415 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 133 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 192,893 acres or 82-38 per cent of arable land, 20,256 acres or 8-65 per cent of unarable land, 205 acres or 0-09 per cent of grass, 13,063 acres or 5-57 per cent of forests, and 7874 acres or 3-36 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 192,893 acres of arable land, 45,245 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nAspect.\n\nKhat\u00e1v is a continuation to the northward of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur plateau, the northern half being of considerable height. It consists wholly of the Yerla valley, the river rising at the northern point of the sub-division and flowing through it from north to south. The shape of the subdivision is a right-angled triangle with the southern boundary for the base and two lines of hills running, the one due south and the other south-east for the two sides. The western hills are the higher, the eastern range though the descent into the M\u00e1n valley is considerable, rises but little above the Khat\u00e1v upland. With the solitary exception of the singular fort of Bhushangad the south is flat and bare compared with the well-wooded picturesque north.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate of the southern half is like that of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, that of the northern half is damper and cooler. In no part is it unhealthy. The rainfall is scanty and fitful, varying greatly from year to year and during the same year in different parts of the sub-division. At Vaduj, the head-quarters of Khat\u00e1v which is about forty-five miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and thirty miles nearly east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from twenty-four inches in 1860-61 to nine inches in 1866-67 and averaged seventeen inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from thirty-six inches in 1877-78 to seven inches in 1879-80 and averaged twenty-one inches.\n\nWater.\n\nThe Yerla is the only river of importance. Besides from wells and rough fair weather dams the lands of Khat\u00e1v are watered by the Yerla canals drawn from the lake at M\u00e1yni and the stone dam...\nat Khatgaon. The lake at Nher is also completed. Except for this artificial storage the water-supply is scanty and uncertain.\n\nThe soil is black near the Yerla and away from it is murum of various varieties, often mixed with red. The black soil yields jv\u00e1ri, gram, and oilseed and when watered sugarcane. The out-turn of the poorer soils, which is almost all b\u00e1jri, depends entirely on the rainfall. When it succeeds b\u00e1jri is a valuable crop, but as both scanty and untimely rain ruins it, the sub-division is very apt to suffer from famine.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included forty-one riding and 1235 load carts, 288 two-bullock and 2771 four-bullock ploughs, 23,362 bullocks and 12,773 cows, 1446 he-buffaloes and 4351 she-buffaloes, 1476 horses, 50,150 sheep and goats, and 561 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 5095 with an average area of 35\u00b793 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 855 were of not more than five acres; 658 of five to ten acres; 996 of ten to twenty acres; 746 of twenty to thirty acres; 589 of thirty to forty acres; 340 of forty to fifty acres; 629 of fifty to a hundred acres; 225 of 100 to 200 acres; 33 of 200 to 300 acres; 10 of 300 to 400 acres; and 14 of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 140,035 acres held for tillage, 15,919 or 11\u00b736 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 124,116 acres 1779 were twice cropped. Of the 125,895 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 111,854 acres or 88\u00b784 per cent, of which 94,034 were under spiked millet b\u00e1jri Penicillaria spicata, 10,854 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 4387 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 229 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 161 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 560 under maize makka Zea mays, 94 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 1535 under other grains, of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 7400 acres or 5\u00b787 per cent, of which 2587 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 558 under tur Cajanus indicus, 3114 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 149 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 3 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 22 under peas v\u00e1t\u00e1na Pisum sativum, 2 under masur Eryum lens, and 965 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 5045 acres or four per cent, of which 7 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum and 5038 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 9 acres, of which one was under cotton k\u00e1pus Gossypium herbaceum and 8 under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea. Miscellaneous crops occupied 1587 acres or 1\u00b726 per cent, of which 734 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 663 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 135 under tobacco tamb\u00e1khu Nicotiana tabacum, 8 under hemp g\u00e1nja Cannabis sativa, and the remaining 47 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 74,027 people, 71,948 or 97\u00b719 per cent were Hindus, 2072 or 2\u00b779 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and 7 P\u00e1rsis.

It has an area of 340 square miles, a population in 1881 of 81,187 or 238 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a324,396 (Rs. 2,43,960).\n\nArea.\n\nOf the 340 square miles, 327 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 53 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 1,39,241 acres or 75\u00b774 per cent of arable land, 8162 acres or 4\u00b744 per cent of unarable land, 28,036 acres or 15\u00b725 per cent of forests, and 18,897 acres or 4\u00b757 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 139,241 acres of arable land 30,958 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nAspect.\n\nExcept on the south-west where the Krishna bounds it, Koregaon is surrounded by hills which are highest towards the north and north-west. The country is comparatively flat in the south, but everywhere slopes gently towards the hills. A remarkable tongue of hills passes from the north-west into the upper half of the subdivision. The hills are thinly clothed with scrub towards the north, but in the south-east are bare and exchange the abrupt hog and saddle-backed ridges for rounded and detached summits. The valleys and plains of the western half are beautifully studded with clumps of mango trees and the gardens of Kumthe a village close to Koregaon are renowned. The eastern portion is generally raised and barer and more barren.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is generally healthy but the rainfall is precarious. The southern portion of Koregaon is decidedly warm in the hot weather; otherwise the temperature is pleasant. At Koregaon, which is about thirty-two miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and twelve miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the ten years ending 1869-70, the rainfall varied from fifty-six inches in 1861-62 to eighteen inches in 1865-66 and averaged twenty-seven inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83, it varied from thirty-eight inches in 1874-75 to twenty inches in 1872-73 and 1876-77 and averaged twenty-seven inches.\nThe only river of importance besides the Krishna is the V\u00e1sna. There are plenty of wells in the western half of the sub-division as well as the Rev\u00e1di canal which is taken from a dam on the river V\u00e1sna at a village about ten miles above Koregaon. In the east the ground is hard and water difficult to obtain, and wells are scanty.\n\nNear the Krishna and V\u00e1sna the soil is black and rich yielding jv\u00e1ri, gram, and tur and when watered sugarcane, condiments, vegetables, and other garden produce. Near the hills the soil becomes poor and more or less red or gray chiefly yielding b\u00e1jri and the coarser jv\u00e1ri.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 122 riding and 1508 load carts, 1092 two-bullock and 1613 four-bullock ploughs, 19,246 bullocks and 12,188 cows, 2092 he-buffaloes and 4577 she-buffaloes, 1177 horses, 20,715 sheep and goats, and 309 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 7016 with an average area of 19\u00b765 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 1930 were of not more than five acres; 1396 of five to ten acres; 1540 of ten to twenty acres; 852 of twenty to thirty acres; 488 of thirty to forty acres; 266 of forty to fifty acres; 442 of fifty to a hundred acres; eighty-one of 100 to 200 acres; ten of 200 to 300 acres; two of 300 to 400 acres, and nine of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82, of 108,191 acres held for tillage, 9831 or 9\u00b708 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 98,360 acres, 3736 were twice cropped. Of the 102,096 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 77,979 acres or 76\u00b737 per cent, of which 40,829 were under spiked millet b\u00e1jri Pennicaria spicata, 33,215 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 3423 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 21 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 73 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 288 under Italian millet r\u00e1la or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 114 under maize makka Zea mays, and 16 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon. Pulses occupied 17,871 acres or 17\u00b750 per cent, of which 6582 were under kulthi or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 4833 under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 3207 under tur Cajanus indicus, 1516 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 97 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 12 under peas v\u00e1tana Pisum sativum, and 1624 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 4437 acres or 4\u00b734 per cent of which 372 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, and 3865 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 361 acres or 0\u00b735 per cent of which 355 were under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea, and 6 under other fibres. Miscellaneous crops occupied 1448 acres or 1\u00b741 per cent of which 489 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 715 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 84 under tobacco tamb\u00e1khu Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 160 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 81,187 people 78,988 or 97\u00b729 per cent were Hindus, 2196 or 2\u00b770 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns,\n\n---\n\n1 Details of the Rev\u00e1di canal are given above under Irrigation, Chapter IV, p 1282\u201455\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-Divisions.\n\nKoregaon.\n\nPeople, 1881.\n\n2 Christians, and one Jew.

It has an area of 625 square miles, a population in 1881 of 52,111 or 83 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a38420 (Rs. 84,200).\n\nArea.\n\nOf the 625 square miles, 613 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 27 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 282,933 acres or 73\u00b792 per cent of arable land, 47,842 acres or 12\u00b750 per cent of unarable land, 1561 acres or 0\u00b740 per cent of grass, 35,540 acres or 9\u00b730 per cent of forests, and 14,870 acres or 3\u00b788 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 282,933 acres of arable land 47,100 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nAspect.\n\nM\u00e1n is a lower level and on three sides is shut in by low hills. At the best of times it is barren and desolate, sparsely wooded even near the river and rock everywhere staring out from shallow unfruitful soil. The north-west is saved from the general ugliness by fairly high hills at times forming picturesque groups, the tops crowned by the forts of V\u00e1rugad and T\u00e1thv\u00e1da. Except in occasional monsoon floods the beds of the M\u00e1n and its feeders are dry. Only in the fine gorge to the east of Dahivadi on the road to Shign\u00e1pur, which is one of the prettiest spots in the district, do the streams add anything to the landscape.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is decidedly hotter than most of the district and is more like Shol\u00e1pur than S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. From March till June the hot winds prevail and in May dust-storms are frequent. The rains consist chiefly of periodical thunderstorms with intervals of incessant wind and dust tempered with an occasional drizzle. The western rain is seldom heavy. The fall is very uncertain and partial, sometimes less than ten and seldom more than twenty to twenty-five inches. At Dahivadi, the head-quarters of M\u00e1n, which is about fifty-five miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dri crest and forty miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra,\nduring the eight years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from twenty-four inches in 1862-63 to nine inches in 1866-67 and averaged sixteen inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from thirty-three inches in 1874-75 to ten inches in 1876-77 and averaged twenty-one inches.\n\nThe M\u00e1n is the only considerable stream. The ordinary sources of water-supply are wretchedly precarious even for drinking. The R\u00e1j\u00e9v\u00e1di reservoir near Mhasvad will not supply this subdivision, but the lake and canal at Pingli will admit of considerable enlargement.\n\nThe area of black soil is small, and owing to the scanty rain and the want of water-works what black soil there is yields but little. Most of the rest of the soil is murum yielding bajri which is easily spoilt by untimely rain. M\u00e1n is subject to constant droughts and suffered terribly in the 1876-77 famine. Every year large numbers of people are forced to leave in search of work.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included eighty-three riding and 961 load carts, 600 two-bullock and 2610 four-bullock ploughs, 19,568 bullocks and 14,413 cows, 1863 he-buffaloes and 2497 she-buffaloes, 1404 horses, 92,060 sheep and goats, and 414 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 4800 with an average area of 57\u00b706 acres.

Of the remaining 191,073 acres, 6136 were twice cropped. Of the 197,209 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 161,673 acres or 81\u00b798 per cent of which 122,952 were under spiked millet bajri Penicillaria spicata, 25,777 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 1655 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 507 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 229 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 436 under Italian millet r\u00e1la or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 860 under maize makka Zea mays, 451 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 9006 under other grains of which details are not given.

Oilseeds occupied 4361 acres or 2\u00b721 per cent, of which 9 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, and 4352 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 564 acres or 0\u00b728 per cent, of which one was under cotton h\u00e1pus Gossypium herbaceum and 563 under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea. Miscellaneous crops occupied 2404 acres or 1\u00b721 per cent of which 634 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 382 under sugarcane us.\nSaccharum officinarum, 94 under tobacco tamb\u00e1kh\u00fa Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 1294 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 52,111 people 50,984 or 97\u00b783 per cent were Hindus and 1127 or 2\u00b716 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. The details of the Hindu castes are: 1864 Br\u00e1hmans; 39 K\u00e1yasth Prabhus, writers; 673 Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, 225 Jains, 202 T\u00e1mbolis, 173 Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1nis, 22 M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, and 16 Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, traders and merchants; 19,331 Kunbis and 3020 M\u00e1lis, husbandmen; 1438 Lon\u00e1ris, cement makers; 710 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather workers; 502 Sangars, wool weavers; 458 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 440 Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters; 402 Koshtis, weavers; 399 Shimpis, tailors; 312 Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths; 298 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 220 Telis, oilmen; 156 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle makers; 102 S\u00e1lis, weavers; 69 Vad\u00e1rs, earth diggers; 27 K\u00e1ranjkars, saddle makers; 18 P\u00e1tharvats, stone-dressers; 17 Buruds, bamboo workers; and 8 Ot\u00e1ris, casters; 687 Hol\u00e1rs, labourers; 439 Guravs, priests; 167 Ghadsis, musicians; 636 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 303 Parits, washermen; 7160 Dhangars, cowmen; 121 Kolis, ferrymen; 50 Bhois, fishers; 51 Th\u00e1kurs, husbandmen; 38 Pardeshis, petty traders; 3070 R\u00e1moshis, watchmen; 951 Vanj\u00e1ris, husbandmen; 3782 Mh\u00e1rs, village messengers; 1719 M\u00e1ngs, village watchmen; 393 Dhors, tanners; 181 Gos\u00e1vis, 96 Jangams, 29 Gondhlis, and 20 Joshis, beggars.\n\nP\u00e1tan in the south-east is bounded on the north by J\u00e1vli and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, on the east by Kar\u00e1d, on the south by V\u00e1lva, and on the west by Sangameshvar and Chipplun in Ratn\u00e1giri. It has an area of 431 square miles, a population in 1881 of 112,414 or 260 to the square mile and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a315,600 (Rs. 1,56,000).\n\nOf the 431 square miles, 361 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenuesurvey returns, 119 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 117,693 acres or 59\u00b700 percent of arable land, 5124 acres or 2\u00b757 per cent of unarable land, 72,336 acres or 36\u00b727 per cent of forests, and 4315 acres or 2\u00b716 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 117,693 acres of arable land 19,989 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nP\u00e1tan like J\u00e1vli is hilly. The chief feature in the west is the south-running Koyna valley with its lofty flanking hills. As in J\u00e1vli these ranges are full of beautiful hill and forest views though, as in J\u00e1vli over large areas the forests have been bared by kumri tillage. At Helv\u00e1k, about twelve miles west of P\u00e1tan, the course of the Koyna turns suddenly from south to east. On the east the valleys of the Koyna T\u00e1rle and Kole open into the plains of the Krishna, and in appearance and soil the country is like the west of Kar\u00e1d.\n\nThe climate is cool and healthy in the hot weather, but the chilly damp of the rains makes it feverish. The rainfall on the western ridge of the Sahy\u00e1dris is at least as heavy as at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. At P\u00e1tan which is fifteen miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and twenty-two miles nearly south of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the eight years\nending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from eighty-five inches in 1863-64 to forty-two inches in 1867-68 and averaged fifty-eight inches, and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from 102 inches in 1882-83 to thirty-nine inches in 1880-81 and averaged sixty-five inches.\n\nBesides the Koyna the only considerable river is the T\u00e1rle which rises in the north-east of the sub-division above the large village of the same name. These rivers and their feeders furnish abundance of water to the villages on and near their banks. Away from the rivers, both on the tops of the hills and in the valleys, especially during March April and May water is scarce.\n\nThe soil of the eastern valleys is good and yields both early and late crops chiefly jv\u00e1ri and groundnuts and when watered sugarcane. The rest of the soil is red and except in the hollows where rice and sometimes sugarcane are grown, is under wood-ash tillage.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included fifty-seven riding and 1137 load carts, 7864 two-bullock and 2336 four-bullock ploughs, 25,379 bullocks and 19,050 cows, 6163 he-buffaloes and 9459 she-buffaloes, 820 horses, 14,933 sheep and goats, and thirty-three asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 15,021 with an average area of 7\u00b757 acres. Of the whole number 6271 were of not more than five acres; 3084 of five to ten acres; 2621 of ten to twenty acres; 2007 of twenty to thirty acres; 918 of thirty to forty acres; 119 of forty to fifty acres; and one of fifty to a hundred acres.\n\nIn 1881-82, of 85,814 acres held for tillage 38,464, or 44\u00b764 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 47,350 acres, 5498 were twice cropped. Of the 52,848 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 43,154 acres or 81\u00b765 per cent, of which 1423 were under spiked millet bajri Pennicillaria spicata, 11,596 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 16,172 under r\u00e1gi or n\u00e1chni Eleusine corocana, 593 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 84 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 36,036 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 1200 under Italian millet r\u00e1l\u00e1 or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 5530 under maize makka Zea mays, 20 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 1500 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 7563 acres or 14\u00b731 per cent, of which 1182 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 1928 under tur Cajanus indicus, 100 under kulith or kutthi Dolichos biflorus, 3124 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 300 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 100 under peas v\u00e1t\u00e1na Pisum sativum, 125 under masur Ervum lens, and 704 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 505 acres or 0\u00b795 per cent, of which 5 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, and 500 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 97 acres or 0\u00b718 per cent, of which 89 were under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea and 8 under other fibres. Miscellaneous crops occupied 1529 acres or 2\u00b789 per cent, of which 875 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 530 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 13 under\ntobacco *tamb\u00e1khu* Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 111 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 112,414 people 110,788 or 98\u00b755 per cent were Hindus and 1626 or 1\u00b744 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. The details of the Hindu castes are: 2265 Br\u00e1hmans; 29 P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Pr\u00e1bhus, writers; 947 Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, 286 T\u00e1mbolis, 270 Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1nis, 218 Jains, 37 Komt\u00eds, 25 M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, and 9 Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, traders and merchants; 74,615 Kunbis and 193 M\u00e1lis, husbandmen; 1499 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 1230 S\u00fat\u00e1rs, carpenters; 1013 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather workers; 893 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 820 Telis, oilmen; 713 Shimpis, tailors; 597 Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths; 514 S\u00e1lis and 243 Koshtis, weavers; 155 Sangars, wool weavers; 146 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle makers; 101 Buruds, bamboo workers; 94 Vad\u00e1rs, earth diggers; 76 Patvekars, tassel makers; 49 Ghi\u00e1sdis, tinkers; 44 K\u00e1ranjkars, saddle makers; 41 Beld\u00e1rs, quarrymen; 19 R\u00e1uls, tape-makers; 14 Ot\u00e1ris, casters; 9 P\u00e1tharvats, stone dressers; 1310 Gur\u00e1vs, priests; 16 Ghadsis, musicians; 7 H\u00f3l\u00e1rs, labourers; 1315 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 729 Parits, washermen; 4280 Dhangars, cowmen; 1028 Kolis, ferrymen; 195 Bhois, fishers; 32 Pardeshis, petty traders; 18 Th\u00e1kurs, husbandmen; 279 R\u00e1moshis, watchmen; 11,999 Mh\u00e1rs, village messengers; 1860 M\u00e1ngs, village watchmen; 19 Dhors, tanners; 2 Bhangis, scavengers; 191 Jangams, 123 Gos\u00e1vis, 118 Gondhlis, 80 Joshis, and 23 Kolh\u00e1tis, beggars.\n\n**S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.**\n\n*S\u00e1t\u00e1ra* in the centre of the district is bounded on the north by J\u00e1vli and W\u00e1i, on the east by Koregaon and the Krishna, on the south by Kar\u00e1d and P\u00e1tan, and on the west by J\u00e1vli. It has an area of 320 square miles, a population in 1881 of 119,913 or 374 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a324,916 (Rs. 2,49,160).\n\n**Area.**\n\nOf the 320 square miles, 262 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 97 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 108,708 acres or 76\u00b711 per cent of arable land, 5369 acres or 3\u00b776 per cent of unarable land, 22,665 acres or 15\u00b787 per cent of forests and 6090 acres or 4\u00b726 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 108,708 acres of arable land 43,253 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\n**Aspect.**\n\n*S\u00e1t\u00e1ra* consists of the three valleys of the Krishna, Vena, and Urmodi rivers. The two latter run from north-west to south-east and are enclosed by three compact ranges of straight ridged hills running parallel to the rivers and from 1500 to 2000 feet in height. A lower range separates the upper half of this sub-division from that of Koregaon, while the Krishna forms the boundary of the lower half. The valleys are open and slope gently to the very foot of the hills which rise extremely steep and are crowned with fortress-like summits. The hills are bare but the valleys are studded with clumps of mangoes, and *b\u00e1bhuls* grow plentifully on the banks of the Krishna in the south-east.\n\n**Climate.**\n\nThe climate is healthy. During March and April there is considerable heat and glare particularly at the foot of the hills during the day, but the nights are nearly always cooled by the sea breeze.\nDuring the south-west monsoon, though this is probably the least healthy season of the year the temperature is delicious. At S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, which is about twenty miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from forty-six inches in 1861-62 to twenty-nine inches in 1862-63 and averaged thirty-six inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from fifty-eight inches in 1882-83 to twenty-nine inches in 1880-81 and averaged forty inches.\n\nThe rivers are the Krishna and its feeders the Yenna and Urmodi. Water is generally abundant, except in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; the well water is sweet and good. The Kas water works, which are nearly completed, will remove the deficiency of water at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nThe soil of the land bordering on the rivers is black and rich. Towards the east as it nears the hills it becomes shallower and poorer and mixed with murum or gray soil till at last the m\u00e1dr\u00e1n or poorest quality is reached. On the west as it approaches the hill the soil in like manner becomes poorer, but is more mixed with red than with gray soil. The black soil yields the staple ju\u00e1ri, gram, and tur Cajanus indicus. The poorer soils yield the inferior qualities of ju\u00e1ri and b\u00e1jri, while in the west rice is grown at the foot of the hills.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 365 riding, and 1591 load carts, 2577 two-bullock and 1975 four-bullock ploughs, 24,080 bullocks and 15,668 cows, 1960 he-buffaloes and 10,165 she-buffaloes, 1292 horses, 20,571 sheep and goats, and 444 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 7947 with an average area of 13\u00b766 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 3156 were of not more than five acres; 1633 of five to ten acres; 1586 of ten to twenty acres; 133 of twenty to thirty acres; 260 of thirty to forty acres; 748 of forty to fifty acres; 278 of fifty to a hundred acres; 108 of 100 to 200 acres; twenty-two of 200 to 300 acres; seven of 300 to 400 acres; and sixteen of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82, of 67,473 acres held for tillage, 14,041 or 20\u00b780 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 53,432 acres 1677 were twice cropped. Of the 55,109 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 45,062 acres or 81\u00b776 per cent, of which 12,639 were under spiked millet b\u00e1jri Penicillaria spicata, 22,739 under Indian millet ju\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 2022 under r\u00e1gi or n\u00e1chni Eleusine corocana, 1373 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 2893 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 1402 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 1192 under Italian millet r\u00e1l\u00e1 or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, one under maize makka Zea mays, 77 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 724 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 5605 acres or 10\u00b717 per cent, of which 1071 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 1156 under tur Cajanus indicus, 1773 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biforus, 482 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 906 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 16 under peas v\u00e1t\u00e1na Pisum sativum, 15 under masur Ervum lens, and 186 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 2752 acres or 4\u00b799 per cent, of which 21 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum and 2731\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-Divisions.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nPeople, 1881.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 119,913 people 113,985 or 95\u00b705 per cent were Hindus, 5305 or 4\u00b742 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 527 or 0\u00b743 per cent Christians, 48 P\u00e1rsis, 29 Sikhs, 16 Jews, and 3 Buddhists. The details of the Hindu castes are: 9020 Br\u00e1hmans; 91 K\u00e1yasth Prabhus and 42 P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Prabhus, writers; 1082 Ling\u00e1y\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, 472 Jains, 446 Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1nis, 329 T\u00e1mbolis, 80 Komtis, 68 Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, and 34 M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, traders and merchants; 68,853 Kunbis and 2069 M\u00e1lis, husbandmen; 1705 Shimpis, tailors; 1365 Telis, oilmen; 1321 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather workers; 1268 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 1248 Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths; 1001 Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters; 692 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 627 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle-makers; 269 Vad\u00e1rs, earth diggers; 190 Sangars, wool-weavers; 178 Bur\u00fandis, bamboo workers; 176 Lon\u00e1ris, cement makers; 128 Koshtis, weavers; 103 K\u00e1ranjkars, saddle-makers; 84 Ghis\u00e1dis, tinkers; 77 S\u00e1lis, weavers; 70 Patvekars, tassel makers; 25 Ot\u00e1ris, casters; 7 Rang\u00e1ris, dyers; 3 Beld\u00e1rs, quarrymen; 3 R\u00e1uls, tape makers; 1048 Gur\u00e1vs, priests; 154 Hol\u00e1rs, labourers; 68 Ghadsis, musicians; 1377 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 987 Parits, washermen; 2552 Dhangars, cowmen; 158 Gavlis, cowkeepers; 415 Bhois, fishers; 242 Kolis, ferrymen; 315 Pardeshis, petty traders; 1001 R\u00e1m\u00f3shis, watchmen; 6 Kaik\u00e1dis, basket makers; 8240 Mh\u00e1rs, village messengers; 2477 M\u00e1ngs, village watchmen; 292 Dhors, tanners; 31 Bhangis, scavengers; 589 Gos\u00e1vis, 378 Jangams, 122 Gondhlis, 116 Joshis, 112 Bh\u00e1ts, 55 Bhuty\u00e1s, 43 Chitrakathis, 36 Kolh\u00e1tis, 25 V\u00e1sudevs, 11 Tirm\u00e1lis, 9 Gop\u00e1ls, 5 M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs, and 5 Uchl\u00e1s, beggars.\n\nT\u00e1sgaon.\n\nTa'sgaon in the south-east is broken up by many patches of S\u00e1ngli and Miraj. It is bounded on the north by Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, on the east by Jath S\u00e1ngli and Miraj villages, on the south by S\u00e1ngli and Miraj, and on the west by V\u00e1lva. It has an area of 323 square miles, a population in 1881 of 79,704 or 246 to the square mile, and a land revenue in 1882 of \u00a317,437 (Rs. 1,74,370).\n\nArea.\n\nOf the 323 square miles, 320 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 52 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 144,902 acres or 83\u00b752 per cent of arable land, 10,348 acres or 5\u00b797 per cent of unarable land, 516 acres or 0\u00b730 per cent of grass, 11,518 acres or 6\u00b764 per cent of forests, and 6200 acres or 3\u00b757 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 144,902 acres of arable land 25,252 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nAspect.\n\nAll of it is rather low, chiefly the land near the meeting of the Yerla and Krishna. The northern and eastern portions are rocky and barren cut by ranges of low hills which branch from the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur plateau. The west and south-west on and near the great\nrivers form a continuation of the rich plain of the eastern V\u00e1lva, and like it are well wooded with mango and b\u00e1bhul.\n\nThe climate is perhaps somewhat warmer than in the east of the district, though the heat is at no time considered severe and trying nights are rare. Especially in the east the rainfall is variable and precarious. At T\u00e1sgaon, which is about fifty miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dri crest and sixty miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the eight years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from thirty-four inches in 1862-63 to thirteen inches in 1865-66 and averaged twenty-three inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from forty-seven inches in 1882-83 to seven inches in 1876-77 and averaged twenty-six inches.\n\nThe only important rivers are the Krishna forming the western boundary, and the Yerla which enters near the middle of the subdivision from the north. In the west near the rivers the water-supply is good and the means of irrigation are fairly plentiful, while the extreme end of the Krishna canal penetrates into the north-west corner of the sub-division. The eastern portion is very badly off, water being wholly dependent on the uncertain rainfall.\n\nNear the Krishna and Yerla the soil is rich black as fine as any in the district. It bears the usual crops of jv\u00e1ri and gram besides oilseed groundnut and cotton and when watered sugarcane and condiments. Towards the north-east the soil is rocky and barren and as in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur b\u00e1jri and late jv\u00e1ri are grown with wheat in favoured spots.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included twenty-six riding and 2144 load carts, 238 two-bullock and 1232 four-bullock ploughs, 17,544 bullocks and 8700 cows, 2190 he-buffaloes and 7479 she-buffaloes, 1186 horses, 26,554 sheep and goats, and 286 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings including alienated lands in Government villages was 6064 with an average area of 23\u00b715 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 928 were of not more than five acres; 1125 of five to ten acres; 1614 of ten to twenty acres; 1017 of twenty to thirty acres; 520 of thirty to forty acres; 337 of forty to fifty acres; 403 of fifty to a hundred acres; 101 of 100 to 200 acres; ten of 200 to 300 acres; seven of 300 to 400 acres; and two of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 115,234 acres held for tillage, 12,933 or 11\u00b722 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 102,301 acres 177 were twice cropped. Of the 102,478 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 77,517 acres or 75\u00b764 per cent of which 10,843 were under spiked millet b\u00e1jri Penicillaria spicata, 60,524 under Indian millet jv\u00e1ri Sorghum vulgare, 177 under r\u00e1gi or n\u00e1clni Eleusine corocana, 4535 under wheat galhu Triticum aestivum, 169 under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 177 under Italian millet r\u00e1l\u00e1 or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, 954 under maize makka Zea mays, and 188 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon. Pulses occupied 16,243 acres or 15\u00b781 per cent of which 6705 were under gram harbhara\nCicer arietinum, 6017 under tur Cajanus indicus, 2057 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, and 1464 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 3209 acres or 3\u00b718 per cent of which 4 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum and 3205 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 3388 acres or 3\u00b730 per cent of which 3233 were under cotton k\u00e1pus Gossypium herbaceum, 45 under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea, and 110 under other fibres. Miscellaneous crops occupied 2121 acres or 2\u00b706 per cent of which 353 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 560 under surgarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 1006 under tobacco tamb\u00e1kku Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 202 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 79,704 people 75,743 or 95\u00b703 per cent were Hindus, 3955 or 4\u00b796 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and six P\u00e1rsis.

It has an area of 545 square miles, a population in 1881 of 169,408 or 310 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a344,133 (Rs. 4,41,330).\n\nOf the 545 square miles, 502 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 128 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 211,190 acres or 79\u00b706 per cent of arable land, 2968 acres or 1\u00b711 per cent of unarable land, 1491 acres or 0\u00b756 per cent of grass, 31,777 acres or 11\u00b789 per cent of forests, and 19,722 acres or 7\u00b738 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 211,190 acres of arable land 46,312 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\nV\u00e1lva is in two parts, the Krishna and lower V\u00e1rna valley in the east and the upper V\u00e1rna valley in the west. The lower valley is a black soil plain and the upper valley is hilly and in the extreme west has some of the densest forest in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. As in P\u00e1tan and J\u00e1vli the beauty of the western hills and forests is marred by stretches left bare by kumri. Much of the east is one great garden adorned by mango groves and by the long still reaches of the b\u00e1bhul-fringed Krishna.\n\nThe heat is nowhere severe. In the east the climate is about the same as, perhaps a little warmer than, in Kar\u00e1d, while the west is a hill climate, feverish in the rains and delicious in the hot months. The rainfall is much heavier in the west than in the east. At Peth, which is about twenty-five miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and forty-two miles south of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from twenty-seven inches in 1869-70 to twelve inches in 1862-63 and averaged seventeen inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from forty-one inches in 1882-83 to thirteen inches in 1876-77 and averaged twenty-seven inches. At Shir\u00e1la which is about twenty miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and eight miles south-west of Peth, during the seventeen years ending 1882-83 the rainfall varied from fifty-seven inches in 1882-83 to twenty-three inches in 1871-72 and averaged thirty-four inches.\n\nThe only two important rivers are the Krishna flowing south-east and the V\u00e1rna, which, rising in the Sahy\u00e1dris, flows due east and joins the Krishna a few miles beyond the south-east corner of the sub-division. Except near the hills on rocky soils away from rivers the water-supply is fair. The Krishna canal runs through the ten miles to the north-east of the Krishna between Kar\u00e1d and T\u00e1sgaon.\n\nThe Krishna and lower V\u00e1rna valleys have magnificent black soil like that of Kar\u00e1d, growing much the same crops, jv\u00e1ri and gram the staple dry-crops and sugarcane and condiments where watered. Cotton and groundnuts are also grown, while in the hills rice, n\u00e1chni, and other kumri grains are the usual crops.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 227 riding and 2664 load carts, 3368 two-bullock and 3070 four-bullock ploughs, 30,857 bullocks and 15,998 cows, 7318 he-buffaloes and 13,073 she-buffaloes, 1761 horses, 49,384 sheep and goats, and 974 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings, including alienated lands in Government villages, was 7597 with an average area of 26\u00b795 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 1814 were of not more than five acres; 1569 of five to ten acres; 1612 of ten to twenty acres; 929 of twenty to thirty acres; 566 of thirty to forty acres; 359 of forty to fifty acres; 517 of fifty to a hundred acres; 173 of 100 to 200 acres; forty-four of 200 to 300 acres; ten of 300 to 400 acres, and four of over 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82 of 158,553 acres held for tillage, 33,719 or 21\u00b726 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 124,834 acres 7585 were twice cropped. Of the 132,419 acres under tillage grain crops occupied 93,158 acres or 70\u00b735 per cent of which 6893\nwere under spiked millet bajri Penicillaria spicata, 38,279 under Indian millet jvari Sorghum vulgare, 9140 under ragi or nachni Eleocharis erythropoda, 5636 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 4091 under chenna sava Panicum miliaceum, 5139 under rice bhat Oryza sativa, 5455 under Italian millet rala or kango Panicum italicum, 1072 under maize makka Zea mays, 145 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon, and 17,288 under other grains of which details are not given. Pulses occupied 18,531 acres or 13.99 per cent of which 12,584 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 2611 under tur Cajanus indicus, 230 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 1825 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 695 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 95 under peas vataana Pisum sativum, and 491 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 3437 acres or 2.59 per cent of which 17 were under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, and 3420 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 8280 acres or 6.21 per cent of which 7145 were under cotton kapus Gossypium herbaceum, 133 under Bombay hemp san or tag Crotalaria juncea, and 932 under brown hemp ambadi Hibiscus cannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied 9063 acres or 6.84 per cent of which 2531 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 2199 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 3815 under tobacco tambakh Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 518 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 169,408 people 162,105 or 95.68 per cent were Hindus, 7289 or 4.30 per cent Musalmans, and 14 Christians. The details of the Hindu castes are: 6220 Br\u00e4hmans; 51 K\u00e1yasth Prabhus and 30 P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Prabhus, writers; 5990 Jains, 4014 Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, 478 Mar\u00e1tha V\u00e1nis, 225 T\u00e1mbolis, 29 M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis, and 8 Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, traders and merchants; 93,178 Kunbis and 2659 M\u00e1lis, husbandmen; 2850 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather workers; 2180 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 1891 Shimpis, tailors; 1874 Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters; 1352 Koshtis, weavers; 1304 Telis, oilmen; 1212 Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths; 750 S\u00e1lis, weavers; 785 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 668 Vad\u00e1rs, earth diggers; 373 Lon\u00e1ris, cement makers; 220 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle makers; 155 Sangars, wool weavers; 148 Buruds, bamboo workers; 145 Beld\u00e1rs, quarrymen; 122 K\u00e1ranjkars, saddle makers; 84 Ot\u00e1ris, casters; 53 P\u00e1thavarts, stone dressers; 25 R\u00e1uls, tape makers; 7 Rang\u00e1ris, dyers; 1543 Gur\u00e1vs, priests; 83 Ghadsis musicians; 78 Hol\u00e1rs, labourers; 2117 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 1070 Parits, washermen; 5879 Dhangars, cowmen; 19 Gaylis, cowkeepers; 654 Kolis, ferrymen; 255 Bhois, fishers; 216 Pardeshis, petty traders; 48 Th\u00e1kurs, husbandmen; 1622 R\u00e1moshis, watchmen; 66 Vanj\u00e1ris, husbandmen; 14,669 Mh\u00e1rs, village messengers; 3129 M\u00e1ngs, village watchmen; 206 Dhors, tanners; 8 Bhangis, scavengers; 657 Jangams, 323 Gos\u00e1vis, 198 Bh\u00e1ts, 112 Joshis, 47 Gondhlis, 37 Uchl\u00e1is, 23 M\u00e1nbh\u00e1vs, 11 Kolh\u00e1tis, and 5 V\u00e1sudevs, beggars.\n\nW\u00e1\u00ed in the extreme north-west is bounded on the north by Bhar and the Nira and beyond the Nira by M\u00e1val in Poona, on the east by Phaltan and Koregaom, on the south by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and J\u00e1vli, and on the west by Bhar. It has an area of 390 square miles, a population in\n1881 of 88,610 or 227 to the square mile, and in 1882 a land revenue of \u00a319,556 (Rs. 1,95,560).\n\nOf the 390 square miles 340 have been surveyed in detail. According to the revenue survey returns, 82 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The rest contains 130,008 acres or 65\u00b791 per cent of arable land, 13,456 acres or 6\u00b782 per cent of unarable land, 46,077 acres or 23\u00b736 per cent of forests, and 7698 acres or 3\u00b791 per cent of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. From the 130,008 acres of arable land 29,003 acres have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages.\n\nW\u00e1i is surrounded and crossed in a number of directions by spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds while it is divided by the Mah\u00e1dev range into two halves belonging to the valleys of the Krishna and Nira rivers. The Krishna half is decidedly the more fertile and pleasing of the two, the country about the river is well wooded, and the hills in parts are fairly clothed with trees. The other half, termed the Khand\u00e1la petty division, is bare and slopes towards the Nira which divides it from the Poona district.\n\nThe climate of the plains is temperate throughout, though the Khand\u00e1la petty division is warm in the hot weather and subject to frequent droughts, and the rainfall there is very precarious. The climate in the Sahy\u00e1dri parts is very cool and the rainfall heavy as in J\u00e1vli. At W\u00e1i, which is about sixteen miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and twenty miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the ten years ending 1869-70 the rainfall varied from thirty-four inches in 1861-62 to twenty inches in 1865-66 and averaged twenty-seven inches; and during the thirteen years ending 1882-83 it varied from forty-nine inches in 1875-76 to nineteen inches in 1871-72 and averaged thirty-one inches. At Khand\u00e1la, which is about twenty-five miles east of the Sahy\u00e1dris and twenty-six miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, during the sixteen years ending 1882-83 the rainfall varied from twenty-seven inches in 1867-68 to eight inches in 1871-72 and averaged nineteen inches.\n\nThe Krishna and Nira are the only important rivers. The Nira forms the boundary of the Poona district and the Krishna can be traced past holy W\u00e1i almost up to its source above the village of Jor in the extreme west. In the Krishna valley water is abundant but the supply is poor in the Khand\u00e1la petty division. Land is watered both from wells and from streams.\n\nNear the Krishna the soil is good; elsewhere it is poor. Towards the west the hill crops of n\u00e1chni Eleusine corocana, vari Panicum miliare, and rice are grown on red soil, and kumri or wood-ash tillage prevails. In the east the soil is mostly poor black or gray or of the kind called m\u00e1lr\u00e1n, jv\u00e1ri and b\u00e1jri being the staple crops.\n\nAccording to the 1882-83 returns farm stock included 120 riding and 1281 load carts, 9127 two-bullock and 2072 four-bullock ploughs, 19,932 bullocks and 11,900 cows, 893 he-buffaloes and 5805 she-buffaloes, 723 horses, 30,516 sheep and goats, and 541 asses.\n\nIn 1882-83 the number of holdings, including alienated lands in Government villages was 19,074 with an average area of 6\u00b779 acres. Of the whole number of holdings 9763 were of not more than five\nacres; 5025 of five to ten acres; 3011 of ten to twenty acres; 1049 of twenty to thirty acres; 169 of thirty to forty acres; seventeen of forty to fifty acres; thirty-one of fifty to a hundred acres; four of 100 to 200 acres; two of 200 to 300 acres; and three of 300 to 400 acres.\n\nIn 1881-82, of 101,951 acres held for tillage, 19,503 or 19\u00b712 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 82,448 acres, 2469 were twice cropped. Of the 84,917 acres under tillage grain crops occupied 70,076 acres or 82\u00b752 per cent of which 35,500 were under spiked millet bajri Penicillaria spicata, 20,434 under Indian millet jauri Sorghum vulgare, 4846 under ragi or n\u00e1chni Eleusine corocana, 2017 under wheat gahu Triticum aestivum, 3944 under chenna s\u00e1va Panicum miliaceum, 2468 under rice bh\u00e1l Oryza sativa, 793 under Italian millet r\u00e1la or k\u00e1ng Panicum italicum, three under maize makka Zea mays, and 71 under barley jav Hordeum hexastichon. Pulses occupied 11,001 acres or 12\u00b795 per cent of which 1177 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 2035 under tur Cajanus indicus, 4570 under kulith or kulthi Dolichos biflorus, 248 under udid Phaseolus radiatus, 641 under mug Phaseolus mungo, 79 under peas v\u00e1t\u00e1na Pisum sativum, six under masur Ervum lens, and 2245 under other pulses. Oil-seeds occupied 2884 acres or 3\u00b739 per cent of which 459 were under gingelly seed til Sesamum indicum, 105 under linseed alshi Linum usitatissimum, and 2320 under other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 37 acres or 0\u00b704 per cent of which 16 were under Bombay hemp san or t\u00e1g Crotalaria juncea, and 21 under brown hemp amb\u00e1di Hibiscus cannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied 919 acres or 1\u00b708 per cent of which 65 were under chillies mirchi Capsicum frutescens, 393 under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, 12 under tobacco tamb\u00e1kh Nicotiana tabacum, and the remaining 449 under various vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show that of 88,610 people 85,605 or 96\u00b760 per cent were Hindus, 2857 or 3\u00b722 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 145 or 0\u00b716 per cent Christians, and 3 P\u00e1rsis. The details of the Hindu castes are: 6390 Br\u00e1hmans; 11 P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Prabhus, writers; 265 Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, 239 T\u00e1mbolis, 235 Jains, 62 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 V\u00e1nis, 15 M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis and 13 Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, traders and merchants; 45,544 Kunbis and 4796 M\u00e1lis, husbandmen; 1459 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather workers; 978 S\u00fat\u00e1rs, carpenters; 939 Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths; 876 Telis, oilmen; 875 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 683 S\u00e1l\u00eds, weavers; 629 Shimpis, tailors; 308 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle makers; 226 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 162 Sangars, wool weavers; 128 Beld\u00e1rs, quarrymen; 123 Koshtis, weavers; 104 Vad\u00e1rs, earth diggers; 75 Bur\u00fads, bamboo workers; 66 Ghis\u00e1dis, tinkers; 51 K\u00e1ranjkars, saddle makers; 42 Lon\u00e1ris, cement makers; 24 P\u00e1tharvats, stone dressers; 21 R\u00e1uls, tape makers; 19 Ot\u00e1ris, casters; 810 Guravs, priests; 44 Hol\u00e1rs, labourers; 40 Ghadsis, musicians; 1195 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 627 Parits, washermen; 5265 Dhangars, cowmen; 46 Gavlis, cowkeepers; 508 Kolis, ferry-men; 115 Bhois, fishers; 57 Th\u00e1kurs, husbandmen; 27 Pardeshis, petty traders; 1336 R\u00e1mosh\u00eds, watchmen; 8285 Mh\u00e1rs, village messengers; 1086 M\u00e1ngs, village watchmen; 11 Dhors, tanners; 10 Bhang\u00eds, scavengers; 280 Gos\u00e1vis, 179 Gondhlis, 158 Jangams, 129 Joshis, 27 Bh\u00e1ts, 6 Kolh\u00e1tis, and 6 V\u00e1sudev\u00eds, beggars.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPLACES.\u00b9\n\nAkhalkop is a small town of 2910 people four miles north-east of Ashta and eleven miles west of T\u00e1sgaon. The town lies on the right bank of the Krishna at a point where the river takes a bend from west to south. A flying bridge leads across the Krishna to Bhilavdi village on the left bank immediately opposite Akhalkop and a fair weather local fund road leads to T\u00e1sgaon and Ashta. The village is chiefly agricultural and depends for its prosperity on the rich produce of the black soil of the Krishna. Akhalkop has two small temples of Datt\u00e1traya and Mhasoba both in high local repute and the scenes of large fairs. The Datt\u00e1traya temple (6' 6\" \u00d7 4' 9\"\u00d79') is built on rising ground in a grove of trees chiefly nim and consists of a small cut-stone shrine facing east and containing the footprints of Datt\u00e1traya. The shrine was first built by the Deshp\u00e1ndy\u00e1s of Akhalkop and rebuilt about 1860 by Krishnar\u00e1v Trimbak B\u00e1pat then m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r of V\u00e1lva. A flight of steps (12'\u00d76') built from alus obtained by devotees leads up to the entrance gate. The temple enjoys lands valued at \u00a31 3s. 6d. (Rs. 11\u00bc) but the Br\u00e1hman ministrants make about \u00a380 (Rs. 800) during the three fair days, the full-moon of M\u00e1rgshirsh or November-December, the dark fifth of M\u00e1gh or January-February, and the dark twelfth of \u00c1shvin or September-October. On all the three occasions the mask of the god is carried in a palanquin with the honours of the umbrella, peacock fans, maces, and flywhisks as symbols of sovereignty. The second in January-February is the chief fair attended by over 5000 people. A large charitable dinner is given on this day to Br\u00e1hmans and the poor. The traders of Akhalkop and rich merchants from other parts of the district furnish contributions in money and in kind.\n\nThe other temple is of Mhasoba a spirit believed to be an attendant on Ganpati. The temple is a domed stone shrine ten feet long by eight feet broad and including the dome about twelve feet high. According to the Krishn\u00e1-m\u00e1h\u00e1tmya the temple is said to have originally belonged to Ganpati and this seems probable as separate temples of Mhasoba are very rare. Round the shrine are stones representing the attendants of Ganpati and inside a stone for Mhasoba. In front of the temple are three gateways built about 200 years ago by a headman of Akhalkop. A fair is held in April and attended by about 2000 people chiefly low caste Hindus, Dhors M\u00e1ngs and R\u00e1m\u00f3shis, and a few Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who are generally credited\n\n\u00b9 This chapter is contributed by Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C. S.\nwith hatching evil plans for gang robberies and dacoities on the occasion. From one to two thousand goats are offered at the fair to Mhasoba. The heads are all given to the village headman, who usually has a large number of guests whom he either entertains on sheep's head or who buy the heads from him at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\text{d.} \\) (\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\text{a.} \\)) a piece. The rest is eaten by the offerers who first offer the meals to the god by placing it before the temple and then retire to feast on it. No meat-offering is allowed inside the shrine. The temple enjoys rent-free lands assessed at \u00a313 (Rs. 130) a year and worth probably \u00a350 (Rs. 500) a year. The Gurav priests of the temple get about \u00a320 (Rs. 200) more during the fair. A flight of thirty steps (30' x 1' x 1') with four landings all built by devotees leads down from the temple to the river bed.\n\n**Ashta**, in V\u00e1lva with in 1881 a population of 9896, is a municipal town twelve miles south-east of Isl\u00e1mpur. The town lies on a slight rise above the valley of the Krishna river which flows four miles to the east. The Peth-S\u00e1ngli local road passes close to the west. The town is walled and has four gates one on each side. There is a sub-judge's court, a post office, and a vernacular school. The water-supply is chiefly from a well at the north-west corner of the town for drinking purposes and a tank outside the west of the town for washing and cattle-watering. The well is dug in the solid rock and is about forty feet square. In 1880 its supply was in danger of running short when some of the rock was blasted as a last hope that a spring would be discovered. The boring rods were driven into the rock and a fault hit upon. The water shot up as from an artesian well and there has been no difficulty since. But the remotest quarters of the town and the low castes are often in difficulties for water and in dry seasons have to go as far as the Krishna. The 1872 census showed 8874 Hindus and 674 Musalm\u00e1ns or a total of 9548. The 1881 census showed 9270 Hindus and 626 Musalm\u00e1ns. The trade of the town is small, the population being entirely agricultural. In area Ashta is nearly the largest village in the district,\\(^1\\) and yields a land revenue of over \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000), while no other village in the district comes within much more than half this amount. About a quarter of a mile to the west of the town is another large tank formed by a dam said to date from Musalm\u00e1n times. The hollow behind the dam has silted up and the tank now hardly holds water. Some large banian and tamarind trees at its east and south-east edges make good shade for a camp. At the east side is a temple of Bhairav kept by Dhangars. The temple itself is very small, and consists only of an image chamber with a small veranda opening east. But it has a paved courtyard with cloisters about 120 feet square with walls twelve feet high and a gateway surmounted with a drum chamber or nag\u00e1vkh\u00e1na. The worship is entirely conducted by Guravs and Dhangars. The Dhangars meet every evening and on Sunday evenings in large numbers, advancing to the temple in procession with drums and pipes, to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mhasvad and Varkute in M\u00e1n are the only two villages which can compare with Ashta but their lands are all barren m\u00e1l, while those of Ashta are nearly all rich black soil.\ndance and sing before the god, before whom sheep and goats are often sacrificed. Most of the buildings are the work of rich Dhangars and point to a time when the caste had some wealth and influence. The town has a cloth-shop kept by V\u00e1ni members of the community of different castes and occupations on the co-operative principle which is a new feature in the district. It pays its way fairly well and cash payments are strictly adhered to. In 1882-83 the municipality had an income of \u00a3185 (Rs.1850) and an expenditure of \u00a3120 (Rs.1200). It has built a set of public latrines in a useful quarter and is adding to their number in other parts of the town. In 1857 during the insurrection at Kolhapur, a body of seventy-five horse was stationed at Ashta then the head-quarters of the V\u00e1lva sub-division.\n\nAundh village is the residence of the Pant Pratinidhi and forms part of his estate or j\u00e1gir. It is surrounded on all sides by Government territory forming part of the Khat\u00e1v sub-division and lies nine miles south-west of Vaduj, the head-quarters of the Khat\u00e1v sub-division and about twenty-six miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. At the top of the pass by which the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road connects the Khat\u00e1v and Koregaon sub-divisions, a cross road branches due east to Aundh which lies in a basin of small hills entirely sheltered from the north and east. The village has vernacular schools for boys and girls, a native library with a few books and photographs and the chief native newspapers. The dispensary is in charge of a passed medical pupil and has an average daily attendance of about thirty-five patients. The drinking water-supply of the town is mainly from wells. But there are also two large tanks twenty yards apart and each about fifty yards square said to have been built by a V\u00e1ni many hundred years ago. The water is bad and little used even for washing. The Pant\u2019s mansion or v\u00e1da is the chief building in the village and consists of a two-storeyed v\u00e1da in the Mar\u00e1tha style with a quadrangle in the centre. In front is a courtyard flanked with buildings out of which a narrow approach leads at right angles into the main street. The whole building covers a space of about two acres. Next to it in the north of the town is a temple of Yamuna Devi, the patron goddess of the Pant Pratinidhi\u2019s family. In front of the temple on the east is a very fine lamp-pillar or dipm\u00e1l about sixty feet high and not more than about fifteen feet in diameter at the base. It is studded in eight alternate lines with in each line twenty-two projecting stones for mounting by and twenty-two brackets for lamps making a total of 176 lamps and as many steps. To break the monotony of the structure the steps are fixed in a position intermediate between the brackets and vice versa. The moulding of both brackets and steps is plain but graceful and the stone work of the whole finely cut and well put together. The uncommon height and slender tapering of this dipm\u00e1l makes it unusually elegant. Aurangzeb came to the village, it is said, with the intention of breaking open the idol, but he spared the dipm\u00e1l. About two miles south of the town is a bungalow in a plantain garden built as a summer resort. About a mile to the south-west of the town\nis a hill about 800 feet above the plain, the summit of which is crowned by another temple of Yamuna Devi. It is the special resort for worship of the Pant and his family, and has been much enlarged and adorned by the present chief and his ancestors. Except its great local repute for holiness the temple has nothing remarkable about it. The courtyard is about thirty yards square paved with stone and surrounded by ramparts about twelve feet thick and fifteen feet high inside. Outside, the height rises with the hill, and in places is not less than forty feet. There are five bastions one at the south-west and two each at the north-west and north-east corners. The south-east corner is rectangular. On the north-west side is the gateway a pointed arch of the thickness of the wall and on its left is the nag\u0101rkh\u0101na or music chamber. The temple consists of a plainly built mandap about thirty feet by twenty fronting east with a star-shaped cut stone but plain idol-chamber or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra with a greatest length and breadth of about twenty feet and surmounted by a twelve-sided stucco spire. The g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra contains a black stone image of Yamn\u00e1\u00ed. The ascent up the hill is made easy by means of about a hundred steps and an excellent pathway about ten feet broad. There is an alternative route by a second flight of steps up the lower half of the hill and passing a small shrine of Ganpati. On the hill side at the north-west of the temple is a flat ridge with the remains of a mango grove and a stone tank about twenty yards square. The temple and its neighbourhood are the favourite haunt of small very tame monkeys. Twenty acres of land are given as in\u00e1m to the monkeys, and grain is spread for them in the rains when they are believed to be in difficulties for food. Though the temple building is not very notable the ascent gives a fine view about twenty-five miles north-west towards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and on a clear day as far as Shingnapur about thirty miles to the north-east. In 1713 Aundh was the scene of a battle between Krishnar\u00e1v Khat\u00e1vkar a Br\u00e1hman raised by the Moghals and B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th afterwards the first Peshwa and at that time a clerk to Sh\u00e1hu (1708-1749) of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Krishnar\u00e1v was defeated and on submission was pardoned and granted the village of Khat\u00e1v, twenty-five miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nBah\u00e1durv\u00e1di is an alienated village belonging to the S\u00e1nghi state and granted to R\u00e1mdh\u00e1ndrar\u00e1v Mahipatr\u00e1v Ghorpade adopted son of the widows of Mahipatr\u00e1v Ghorpade a junior branch of the Mudhol family. The village lies within the limits of the V\u00e1lva sub-division about twelve miles south-east of Peth, and is easily reached by turning east from the Kolhapur mail road at the village of T\u00e1ndulv\u00e1di which is ten miles south of Peth. Bah\u00e1durv\u00e1di is remarkable for a fort consisting of three enclosures. The first or outer enclosure is round, about 150 yards in diameter, and consists of an earthen embankment about thirty feet high. Inside is another round space about 100 yards in diameter enclosed by a stone and mud wall about four feet thick and twenty feet high, with a shallow ditch about six feet wide. It has nine bastions of which the central bastion is over a fortified gateway of some strength. All the bastions are loopholed for musketry. The third and innermost enclosure is a\nsquare about sixty yards in diameter surrounded by a moat twenty feet wide and thirty feet deep. It is enclosed by walls of stone and mud about thirteen feet thick and surmounted by eight bastions, one at each corner and one at the centre of each side. The bastions facing east are particularly strong and the wall is of rough masonry in mortar. The centre bastion on the east is inhabited and the walls contain store chambers. The walls and bastions are surrounded by a parapet and are loopholed for musketry. Their ramparts formerly held guns and mortars the few remaining of which were taken possession of by Government when the district was disarmed in 1857-58. The inmost enclosure has a mansion forming the residence of the In\u00e1md\u00e1r and a rock-cut well with steps, about fifty feet deep and twenty-five feet wide, and always holding twenty feet of water. The situation of this fort is decidedly striking, crowning as it does the knoll on which the village is built with the temple-crowned hill of Mallik\u00e1rjun to the north, the luxuriant V\u00e1rna valley on the east south and west, and Panh\u00e1la and P\u00e1vangad to the southwest. No remarkable engagement seems to have taken place at the fort and since the death of Mahipatr\u00e1v, who served the last Peshwa in a high office under Hari Pant Phadke, the general in charge of the jay\u00edpatka or standard, the family has not been distinguished. The fort is said to have been built by the fourth Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v (1761 - 1772) as a frontier protection against the attacks of Kolh\u00e1pur.\n\nThe temple of Mah\u00e1dev though not old is worth a visit. It consists of an idol-chamber or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra and a hall or mandap together about fifty feet by twenty. The entrance is by a low irregular-shaped arch, and the walls about twelve feet high are of well dressed black stone. The brick spire is not handsome. The walls have a facade of images in relief and painted in chunam with some grotesque figures of animals and human beings on the roof of the mandap.\n\nB\u00e1gni in V\u00e1lva four miles south-west of Ashta is a large agricultural village alienated to the junior branch of the Mantri family the senior branch of which lives at Isl\u00e1mpur. The 1881 census showed a population of 4707. The village has lofty walls in many places thirty feet high with, all round, a deep moat forty feet broad usually full of water on the west. There is also an inner fort or citadel, entered by a strong gate. A large colony of Musalm\u00e1ns live in the village, and the place was one of the posts or th\u00e1n\u00e1s of the Bij\u00e1pur kings (1489 - 1686). Outside the village about half a mile to the east is a mosque about thirty feet square and fifteen high with a small dome in the centre. There are eight pillars four embedded in the walls and four in the centre. The niches are Saracenic handsomely moulded and decorated in floral patterns. To the east of the mosque is a courtyard about sixty yards square containing a mausoleum of the usual type in honour of K\u00e1dir S\u00e1hib a Pir who received this honour for, among other things, miraculously curing a tumour with which M\u00e1hmud Sh\u00e1h, seventh king of Bij\u00e1pur (1626 - 1656) was afflicted. The tomb inside is covered with a beautiful brocade curtain presented by the Mantris of B\u00e1gni.\nBa'he, five miles north-east of Peth, with in 1881 a population of 2402, is an alienated village chiefly remarkable for temples of Shri-R\u00e1mling, M\u00e1runi, Ganpati, and Shrikrishna, built on an island in the bed of the Krishna. The chief temple of Shri R\u00e1mling was built by one Antoba Naik Bhide about a century and a half ago. It is built of mortared brick throughout on a plinth two feet high. The g\u00e1th\u00e1ra or image-chamber is about ten feet square and ten feet high. The outer chamber has a vaulted roof with four pillars. The side aisles are about eight feet high and the centre about thirteen feet high. The arches are pointed and about six feet wide. The whole chamber is about twenty feet square and is capped as usual by a pinnacle about thirty feet high also in mortared brick. The legend about the temple is that R\u00e1m halted here during a pilgrimage and worshipped the ling. Two fairs are held at the temple one on the last day of Paush or December-January and the other on the bright ninth of Chaitra or March-April in honour of R\u00e1m\u2019s birthday. The temple of M\u00e1runi built in 1814 by a Dhangar Setu Harpu Khot is a poor double building about thirty feet by fifteen. The whole is surrounded by a walled court. The entrance is through a solid masonry arch. In high floods the river flows right up to the dome of the temple and every year surrounds the walled court. Setu Dhangar also presented the R\u00e1mling temple with a curious brass cobra. Besides these temples the village has a Government vernacular school with about forty boys.\n\nBa'he village was originally granted to Yashvantr\u00e1v Thor\u00e1t who flourished in the reign of R\u00e1jar\u00e1m (1689-1700) and his son Shiv\u00e1ji (1700-1708). Yashvantr\u00e1v was killed in the battle of Panh\u00e1la (1706), his adopted son was not present, and his villages were given to Sidduji his nephew. Yashvantr\u00e1v\u2019s mansion in Ba'he was fortified with mud and stone walls bastioned at the corners.\n\nBahule village situated close under the north slope of the Mala-T\u00e1mbve spur three miles south of Mandrud and ten miles east-south-east of P\u00e1tan contains a curious little Hem\u00e1dpanti temple said to have been built in a single night. It stands in the middle of a paved court (78\u2019 \u00d7 64\u2019) sunk four feet in the ground and surrounded by five acres of fine old p\u00edmpal trees. The temple faces east and consists of an image-chamber with stone walls set in mortar (14\u2019 4\u201d \u00d7 18\u2019 8\u201d) and surmounted by a shikhar or spire twenty-nine feet high from the ground. This spire is modern and built during the last century by Parshur\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n Angal a rich banker of Nigadi who built a temple at P\u00e1teshvar near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and many others in the district. The walls are 2\u2019 8\u201d thick and the inner space about eight feet square. In the centre is a ling of Bahuleshvar Mah\u00e1dev in a case or sh\u00e1lunkha fronting north and over a spring the water of which drains through a channel shaped like a cow\u2019s head into a stone basin formed on the north side in the court pavement. In the north-west and south-east corners are two small basins sunk in the floor and there are two niches one in the south and one in the north wall. The entrance to the image-chamber is through a vestibule (7\u2019 4\u201d \u00d7 18\u2019 10\u201d) by a quadrangular doorway two feet broad by 4\u2019 9\u201d high. The vestibule has two solid niches in the north and\nsouth walls. The hall or mandap which is really the only ancient part of the temple is fourteen feet long east to west and 18' 10\" broad north to south. It is, as usual, open at all four sides, supported by twelve pillars in four rows of three each, 5' 8\" apart east to west or three rows of four each 4' 6\" apart north to south. The four west pillars are embedded in the modern vestibule wall; of the rest the four middle form a square in the centre of which is a small stone bull or Nandi, and the remaining four are partly embedded in a stone bench 2' 8\" wide the end of which lies vertically under the eaves, which are broad and turned up at the end. The roof 7' 8\" high from within was originally flat but has been put on a slope with brick and cemented by a modern hand. Behind the bench rises a back about four feet high from the ground. The pillars are all of one pattern. The shafts are of a single block cut in rectangular octagonal and cylindrical concentric divisions but without any carving or ornament. The stone used throughout the mandap is in large blocks or slabs and at the roof is joined to the pillars by brackets branching in four directions. Each compartment has a ceiling in the lozenge pattern, formed by placing slabs diagonally to each other without mortar. About nine feet east of the temple is a bathing tank (15' 11\" x 19') fed from a spring in the south-east corner of the court and joined with it by a drain. Five steps lead down to the water of which there is always three feet depth. The officiating temple priests are some Br\u00e1hmans inhabiting the neighbouring village of Garavde. The temple is connected with Bahule half a mile off by a causeway. Water is very plentiful in this neighbourhood, and advantage has been taken of it in many wells and channels for irrigation purposes, while close by the temple an excellent supply is given to Garavde village by a pipe so constructed as to tap a spring. In fact few villages in the district have such a pure and incorruptible supply of water. Fairs in honour of Bahuleshvar are held on the Mah\u00e1sh\u00edv\u00e1r\u00e1t\u00edra or Great Night of Shiv in February-March and the Mondays of Shr\u00e1van or July-August and attended by from two to three thousand people. The ling is said to have been set up by a cowherd to whom the god appeared and showed the spring flowing with milk.\n\nB\u00e1mnoli village with a population of 494 lies seven miles south-west of Medha. It is connected with Medha by an excellent bullock track, and is the starting point in the Koyna valley for the \u00c1mboli pass connecting it with the Konkan. The village has been a local market from early times and has one or two shops of traders. Like T\u00e1mbi, B\u00e1mnoli was a small administrative centre under the Mar\u00e1tha government.\n\nBanpuri in the V\u00e1ng valley, ten miles south-south-east of P\u00e1tan, is an alienated village belonging to V\u00e1sudev Anant Deshp\u00e1nde of Kolev\u00e1di. To the south of the village on the hill side is a temple of N\u00e1ikba, a form of Shiv. The temple is a solid but poor structure with stone walls and a tiled roof. The ling has a silver mask which is carried in procession on the two fair days, the fifth of Chaitra (March-April) and the tenth of Ashvin (September-October). On the latter occasion the attendance numbers over 7000. The legend is\nthat a cultivator surnamed J\u00e1nugade devotedly worshipped Shiv on this spot until he grew so old and infirm that he could go no longer. Shiv ordered him to go home and promised to follow him if he did not look behind. The old man obeyed till on his way hearing a terrible noise he looked back and saw an enormous boulder fallen from the hill and smashed to pieces. That night he had a dream that the boulder was Shiv who should be worshipped on the spot and styled N\u00e1ikba.\n\nBa\u0301vdh\u00e1n village alienated to R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m Bhonsle, the adopted son of the widows of the late R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1tara, had in 1881 a population of 4095 or an increase of 374 over that of 1872. It is situated three miles due south of W\u00e1i and a mile south of the W\u00e1i-Panchvad road, with which it is connected by a small road leading down to the Krishna river which flows about 1\u00bd miles to the north. To the west of the village is a bare range of hills branching from Pasarni and containing two small caves very difficult of access believed to be Buddhist. On the hill top is a flat plateau with a temple of Devi in charge of a Gos\u00e1vi. In the village is an old temple of Bhairav the whole of which was rebuilt about fifty years ago from village subscriptions. The temple is whitewashed and is a rude stone work with a brick spire and a courtyard. A yearly fair is held on the dark fifth of Ph\u00e1lgun (February-March) and is attended by 500 to 1000 people. A far more interesting structure is the Mah\u00e1dev temple down by the Krishna about a quarter of a mile north of the high road. A paved court has been built on the side which slopes gently down to the river. The temple consists of an image-chamber about twelve feet square apparently old and a modern hall open at the sides, with twelve pillars supporting a flat roof with a parapet and broad eaves. On the north of the image-chamber or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra is a small stone basin into which flows the water thrown over the ling and over a spring believed to be one of the mouths of the Sarasvati. The hall is about twenty feet square and the courtyard in front eighty feet by sixty. The image-chamber is surmounted by a spire or shihhar in the old star shape. Leading from the temple to the river is a flight of stone steps thirty feet wide. The temple was added to and restored by a Peshwa officer surnamed K\u00e1n\u00edtkar. Besides these temples the village contains his large mansion or v\u00e1da with lofty brick walls and a gateway about forty feet high surrounding the court, and another two-storeyed mansion in eight compartments belonging to the Kulkarni family.\n\nBhairavgad Fort twenty miles west south-west of P\u00e1tan and about four miles west of M\u00e1la, from which it is pretty easily accessible by a rough footpath through dense jungle, is a rounded hill situated on the face of the Sahy\u00e1dri range and jutting about a hundred feet into the Konkan. A narrow neck thirty yards long separates it from the cliff on the east, which rises some 300 feet above it. About five acres in area the hill has on the east a temple of Bhairav which gives it its name.\n\nAccording to Grant Duff\u00b9 Bhairavgad was one of the forts built\n\n\u00b9 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 13 note 3.\nby the r\u0101j\u0101s of Panh\u0101la. The garrison in Mar\u0101tha times was furnished by soldiers sent from S\u00e1t\u0101ra. There are no traces of houses and the walls are in ruins. In the last Mar\u0101tha war Bhairavgad was captured by the English on the 23rd of May 1818. A detachment of a hundred rank and file was sent by Lieutenant-Colonel Kennedy under command of Lieutenant Capon from S\u00e1varda in Chiplun in Katn\u00e1giri. They proceeded to Tal\u00e1vda a village at the foot of the hill from which there was an ascent of nearly six miles. But a message brought down the native officer in charge of the fort with a party of the garrison, who promised to surrender next morning on condition that the arms and property of himself and the garrison about a hundred strong, were respected and an escort of sepoys allowed as far as P\u00e1tan. The fort was taken accordingly without resistance.\n\nBhilavdi, 9\u00bd miles south-west of T\u00e1sgaon, is a village on the left bank of the Krishna with in 1881 a population of 6569. The 1872 census showed a total of 6227 of whom 5832 were Hindus and 395 Musalm\u00e1ns; of the 1881 total 6156 were Hindus and 413 Musalm\u00e1ns. The village is almost entirely agricultural, but has some substantial moneylenders. The surrounding land is some of the best black soil of the Krishna valley. The road from T\u00e1sgaon to Ashta passes through this village which is connected by a flying bridge with Akhalkop on the opposite bank. A fine bathing gh\u0101t or flight of steps has been made down to the river. The descent is not more than about five feet and the steps have been so built that a coin placed on any step can be seen from any position of equal height in the rest of the flight. The river bank is very soft and muddy and the foundation for the steps is said to be constructed principally of cattle horns which were collected in great numbers and thrown into the water the action of which it is said caused them to spread and take root like trees. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices Bhilavdi as a village of 550 houses with fifteen shops and a resthouse.\n\nBhop\u00e1lga\u1e0d hill fort lies within the village limits of B\u00e1nur at the extreme south-east of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-division. The easiest approach to it is from Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur eleven miles by the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road to Palshi, whence a rough path passable for ponies leads through a very stony country four miles due east to B\u00e1nur. A small neck of land divides the spur on which the fort and village are situated from the main Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur plateau. The fort is formed by broken walls skirting the edges of an irregular rhomboid raised about sixty feet above the rest of the plateau. A hill in the centre might serve as the b\u00e1la killa or citadel, but it is unfortified and contains a temple of Mah\u00e1dev. The village of B\u00e1nur is situated at the south of the fort just inside the wall. The internal area of the fort is between two and three hundred acres. On the southeast, east and north, it is fairly unapproachable up the precipitous descent of about 700 feet on into the M\u00e1n valley below. On the west and south there is nothing but the small rise of sixty to one hundred feet above mentioned, but to reach this the narrow neck noticed above has to be crossed. The fort, however, is commanded\n\n---\n\n1 Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha War Papers, 345.  \n2 Itinerary, 69.\nfrom hills about half a mile to the west. A broad track was made in ancient times from the village of Jarandi five miles south-east by which stores used to be sent. There is a small tank inside the fort, and close on the south a fine large one with a well adjoining and full of water throughout the year. According to a local legend the fort was built by a king named Bhop\u00e1l. In 1679, Bhop\u00e1lgaad fort as the eastern outpost of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s territories was besieged and taken by a detachment under Sambh\u00e1ji then in rebellion against his father Shiv\u00e1ji and sent by Diler Kh\u00e1n the Moghal general then besieging Bij\u00e1pur.\n\n**Bhose**, a village of 2185 people nine miles south-east of T\u00e1sgaon, is remarkable for a curious cave temple of Dandoba Mah\u00e1dev. The temple is situated in the hills to the south-east of the village about fifty-eight feet from the summit of a point rising about 1200 feet above the level of the spur. The spur on which the hill stands branches due south from the Kh\u00e1n\u00e9pur plateau, and the cave temple on it faces east. The ascent from Bhose is easy by \u201cthe elephant path,\u201d a track cleared by the Patvardhans for their elephants, though there is no made road. A flat platform leads to the temple doorway which is cut rectangularly out of the rock four feet high by three feet broad. There is no door or any framework for one. Immediately inside is a hole made in the rock above which lets light in the whole cave except the image-chamber which is artificially walled off from the rest. The whole excavation is fifty-eight feet long east to west and thirty-six feet broad north to south, and was originally apparently nothing but an oblong cave. A great deal of building has since been done by modern hands. An inscription noticed below shows that a king named Shringan was intimately connected with it. His place of residence is called Kausalyapur. A legendary account gives Kaundanyapur as the place of residence of a r\u0101ja known as Hingandeey, a name a trace of which also remains in the Hingankhadi at Mhasurne and perhaps in the name Shingnapur, where he is said to have performed much devotion. The date in the inscription is said to read Shak 611 (A.D. 689), but this seems wrong and the king is probably the Devgiri Y\u00e1day king Singhan I. or II., who flourished in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It seems possible that he built this temple, more especially as the temples of Kundal and Malkeshvar are referred by Dr. Burgess to a period between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. The chamber roof is quite flat and there are no benches at the sides. Inside the door a space twenty-eight feet wide and thirty feet long has been walled up, leaving recesses between the wall and sides of the cave. At right angles to this is a wall right across the cave, with a door about five feet by four which leads to a hall or mandap. Immediately in front of this door two stone figures of a man and woman called \u201cBahule\u201d with Mar\u00e1thi inscriptions below them are, it is believed, door-keepers or satellites of the gods. One contains the date Shak 1695 (A.D. 1773). The rest is not legible. The other contains the names Shinapa and B\u00e1lapa Tatavte bin (son of) Jay\u00e1pa Tatavte,\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 130.\n2 See below Shingnapur.\n3 Fleet\u2019s K\u00e1narese Dynasties, 72-74.\nresidence Sanik Savemane Rajoji. These letters are modern. Inside the mandap extends the whole width of the cave. Above the centre of the mandap is a masonry structure (14' x 10') forming the image-chamber. A door (7' x 5') leads into the chamber which contains a stone linga on a pedestal about four feet high railed off by a cross bar to prevent worshippers coming too close and overcrowding. A passage is left round the chamber five feet wide at the back and thirteen feet wide at the sides. This is ordinarily used for the holy circuit or pradakshina which is necessary to qualify a worshipper to enter into the image-chamber. The rest of the mandap is taken up with masonry arches made to give a nave and side aisles. The pillars are about a foot in diameter with plain and square shafts and round arches. In front of the door of the image-chamber is a small stone Nandi, and to its right is an eight-handed image of Bhav\u00e1ni about three feet high and a foot in diameter, and close by it is a slab in the middle west pillar which is carved in front with the K\u00e1naresi inscription above mentioned.\n\nNext the north-west pillar is another stone image of Virbhadra, similar in size to the Devi. Upon the summit of the hill and supposed to be directly over the linga is a spire about thirty feet square at the base and of the same height, formed of four concentric square courses each about three feet less in diameter than the other and surmounted by an urn-shaped pinnacle. The lower courses are of stone and the upper courses and pinnacle are of brick. The stone courses are of considerable age, but who built them is not known. The brick courses were added by Chint\u00e1manr\u00e1v \u00c1pa Patvardhan at the beginning of the present century. The god is called Dandoba after the priest mentioned in the inscription. In his honour about 500 people assemble for worship on each Monday in Shr\u00e1van or July-August. The worshippers are chiefly Lingayat V\u00e1nis and Jains.\n\nBhushangad in Khat\u00e1v about eleven miles south-west of Vaduj is a roughly oval solitary hill rising about 600 feet above the surrounding plain. On the north-west half down the slope are a number of houses mostly inhabited by Br\u00e1hmans formerly attached to the fort garrison. The ground above the fort slopes towards the top. Except near the gateway on the north-east the walls are of light masonry. On the top was a very deep tank now filled up. The ascent is easy. Bhushangad is not commanded by any hill within five miles. The fort was built by Shiv\u00e1ji about 1676, and sustained an attack from Fattehsing M\u00e1ne in 1805 then camped at Rahimatpur.\n\nBopardi, with in 1881 a population of 796, is a small village two miles north of W\u00e1i and connected with it by a well cleared track. It contains a modern but well built little temple of Mah\u00e1dev curiously placed in a stone tank, from which four steps lead upwards on to the surrounding court. The temple is nothing but a shrine with a porch the whole measuring twenty feet long by eighteen feet wide. The porch is four feet by eighteen and consists of three small flat-roofed compartments supported on rectangular shafted pillars eighteen inches at the base with brackets at the head. The shrine is surmounted by a very elaborate stucco-decorated brick spire or\nshikhar. In front is a Nandi canopy also with a small spire. The ling is over a rich spring and there is a drain on the north side through which the water is allowed to run. The temple, which though small is for a modern structure very pleasing, was built by one Lakshman Dhonddev Phadnis a dependant of the great R\u00e1stia family who flourished about a hundred years ago. The temple is in great local repute at W\u00e1i.\n\nBorgaon, 5\u00bd miles north-east of Isl\u00e1mpur and five miles north-west of V\u00e1lva, is a large agricultural village situated on the right bank of the Krishna at a sudden bend which it takes northwards. The population in 1881 was 4144. The village has a vernacular school and a temple on the north adjoining the Krishna. The temple is an interesting modern building in a court about 100 feet square with round arched cloisters of brick covered with mortar. The land in the neighbourhood is some of the finest Krishna valley black soil.\n\nChandan and Vand\u00e1n forts are situated some ten miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and stand out prominently from the range of hills running nearly south from Har\u00e1li the massive hill immediately east of the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass and terminating with Jaranda nearly due east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Vand\u00e1n the higher, larger, and more prominent of the two, 3841 feet above sea level, is approached most easily from Jaranda a hamlet of Kikli. The path, which bears evidence of having been at one time a broad roughly-paved causeway with here and there some rude steps, ascends steeply the northern slope of the fort until it reaches the saddle between Vand\u00e1n and Chandan, then it doubles back along the eastern slope immediately under the lower of the two scarps for some distance almost level. About midway along the eastern side of the hill it again doubles back and the ascent is by a steep flight of rough steps to the first gate which looks nearly due south. The gateway is in fair order but the curtain behind it has fallen down and is completely ruinous. A sharp zigzag leads to the second gate which looks more ancient than the first gate and is nearly blocked up with stones. There is an inscription in Persian characters over the gateway and within are several rooms for the accommodation of the guard. A covered way leads on from the gate to a point whence a very steep winding flight of stones leads direct to the top of the scarp or a more gradual gradient gives access to the top by walking round to the northern side. The lower scarp is a very perfect one and the only possible approach to the top is by the gateway first mentioned. Once within this gateway, now that the curtain has fallen down, the top can be reached by either route.\n\nThe area on the top is considerable and bears the appearance of having held a large garrison. The ruins and foundations of houses are very numerous up and in the south-east corner where there is a regular street. This quarter is pointed out as the Br\u00e1hman \u00e1li. Immediately above it, approached by a broad flight of steps, are the ruins of the sark\u00e1rv\u00e1da overshadowed by a large banian tree. Close by is a second large banian and above a large shivri tree.\n\n1 Contributed by Mr. H. R. Cooke, C.S.\nThese trees form conspicuous objects on the hill top from considerable distances around. Near the v\u0101da is a large room divided into three compartments and still completely roofed. More to the west is a mosque still in fair preservation, but chiefly used as a cattle stall and at the extreme west corner is a considerable Musalm\u00e1n bathing place with two roofed and walled tombs. A ministrant with a small patch of in\u0101m land still attends to them and the tombs themselves are covered with cloths. There are several large water reservoirs on the hill top, noticeably one close below the sark\u0101rv\u0101da, and another, near the Musalm\u00e1n burying place, which is still confined by masonry in fairly good order. Near the south-west corner there evidently was a large tank formed by excavation, the earth being thrown up near the edge of the precipice so as to form a dam. But the dam has been pierced evidently on purpose and the tank can hold no water now. The whole of the hill top is not level. An eminence rises with steep slopes on its southern half to a height of some 100 feet above the level of the sark\u0101rv\u0101da. This eminence is surmounted with the ruins of a considerable building, the object of which, unless it were a pleasure-house, is not evident.\n\nThe whole of the hill top is not walled. There are masonry walls at all the weak points and bastions at the angles. Captain Rose visited the fort in 1857 the mutiny year to burst the cannon none of which now remain. He probably also destroyed the dam. There used to be a Subhed\u00e1r on the hill. Some 200 Gadkaris were attached to the fort and lived in the various hamlets around chiefly to the north.\n\nChandan, separated from Vandan only by the saddleback scarcely half a mile across, is a slightly lower hill and wants the eminence on the top of Vandan. The gate is at the south-east corner and the easiest ascent is from the north crossing the north-east slope of the hill. If visited from Vandan, difficult footpaths lead from the saddle either along the north-west or north slopes or along the south slope to the south-east angle where they join the regular approach near the gateway. The gateway is no way remarkable, and once within, there is no further difficulty beyond a steep ascent to gain the level top. There is no second gate, but, after passing an old temple to Mah\u00e1dev and a fine banian tree, a flight of fairly broad steps leads to the top of the hill between two curiously built pillars. They consist each of four huge unhewn stones piled one on another. It is said they were placed there when the fort was built about 1600 by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adilsh\u00e1h II. (1580-1626) the sixth Bij\u00e1pur king.\u00b9 A local legend explains how the stones were erected. A huge stone was first made firm, then it was surrounded by earth, and up the back thus formed a second huge stone was rolled and pushed and fastened on the former. This operation was repeated again and again and finally the earth cleared away leaving the present pillars of huge stone rising to a height of some fifteen to twenty feet. There is not much else of interest in the fort. There are evidences of the existence at one time of a very considerable population and traces remain of a fine sark\u0101rv\u0101da and a room. The tank is now empty, the\n\n\u00b9 According to Grant Duff Chandan and Vandan were among the fifteen forts built by one of the Panh\u00e1la kings about 1190.

A Subhed\u00e1r formerly resided on the fort with villages from the present Koregaon sub-division in his charge. As in the case of Vandan only the broken points were defended by masonry walls and the angles by bastions. In 1673 Chandan Vandan were among the forts which fell into Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s hand.\\(^1\\) They were taken by Aurangzeb\u2019s officers in 1701 but were recaptured by Sh\u00e1hu after his release in 1708.\\(^2\\) During the civil war between T\u00e1r\u00e1bh\u00e1i and Sh\u00e1hu, Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s army was encamped at Chandan Vandan in the rains of 1708.\\(^3\\) In a revenue statement of about 1790 \u2018Candanwanden\u2019 are mentioned as the head-quarters of a pargana in the Bij\u00e1pur subha with a revenue of \u00a32164 8s. (Rs. 21,644).\\(^4\\) They fell without resistance in 1818.\n\nCh\u00e1phal an alienated village with in 1881 a population of 1953 being an increase of 38 over that in 1872, lies on the M\u00e1nd a tributary of the Krishna six miles west of Umbraj. It is reached by a first class local fund road as far as Charegaon three miles south-west of Umbraj from where a track reaches Ch\u00e1phal by Majgaon. The village is prettily placed in a narrow part of the valley and is surrounded by fertile black soil lands and teak-covered hills. The water-supply for drinking and irrigation is plentiful. The proprietor is Lakshmanr\u00e1v R\u00e1mchandra Sv\u00e1mi the descendant of the famous R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi the contemporary and spiritual adviser of Shiv\u00e1ji. The representative of this family takes rank first among the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra native chiefs above the Pratinidhi and the Sachiv and the chiefs of Phaltan and Jath; and divides his residence between Ch\u00e1phal and the fort of Parli. Eight villages of the head M\u00e1n valley are alienated to him, besides others in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra near Parli fort. Ch\u00e1phal village is distributed over both sides of the river. On the left bank is the main street inhabited by several well-to-do traders where a weekly market is held. A foot bridge connects it with the right bank where are the vernacular school in a good Government building; a few cultivators\u2019 houses, and the temple and mansion of the Sv\u00e1mi. They are built on a hill within the same paved court and are reached by a causeway surmounted by a flight of fifty steps and an archway with a nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1ma or drum-chamber on the top. The dwelling houses line the sides of the court and in the middle is the temple dedicated to R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi and to his tutelary deity the god M\u00e1ruti. The temple court steps are all of fine trap masonry and in excellent repair but, apart from solidity and good plain workmanship, are in no way remarkable. The temple faces east and has an open hall on wooden pillars and a stone image-chamber with a tower of brick and cement. The temple was completed in 1776, at an estimated cost of over \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000), by B\u00e1l\u00e1ji M\u00e1ndavgane a rich Br\u00e1hman who built many others in the district. The north side faces the river whose banks here are about sixty feet high of crumbling black soil and kept together by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 116.\n\\(^2\\) Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 177, 185.\n\\(^3\\) Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 187.\n\\(^4\\) Waring\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.

The temple is enriched by many offerings and is a favourite place of pilgrimage. A fair attended by 2000 to 3000 pilgrims is held on the ninth of Chaitra or March-April.\n\nCharegaon, with in 1881 a population of 3175 being an increase of 104 over that in 1872 is a large village four miles west of Umbraj on the Umbraj-Malharpeth road which crosses the M\u00e1nd river by a bridge close to the south-west of the town. Charegaon has a good vernacular school and a large population of V\u00e1nis who conduct a carrying and export trade with Chiplun. From early times pack bullocks from this village crossed the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass in numbers. Their place is now taken by carts the payments of which form a large portion of the proceeds of the Urul toll on the Malharpeth road.\n\nChikurde, a village of 3894 people, lies in the V\u00e1rna valley between nine and ten miles south-south-west of Peth and six miles west of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Kolhapur road. It is one of the most thriving villages in the district with broad streets and good houses. The land surrounding it is excellent yielding rich crops of sugarcane and pepper. The Deshmukhs of Chikurde are an affluent Br\u00e1hman family of local repute and importance and have held the office since the days of the Bij\u00e1pur kings. Besides their own mansion which is a fine specimen of the modern Mar\u00e1tha mansion or v\u00e9d\u00e1, the Deshmukhs, especially the present representative and his father, have done much in endowing and enlarging a modern but handsome temple of Mah\u00e1dev, which lies about a mile north-west of the village at the edge of a bare plain of m\u00e1dr\u00e1n. The temple (50' \u00d7 30') has an image-chamber, a stone hall or mandap, and a brick tower. In front is a large paved courtyard 120 feet square surrounded by a stone wall, and outside a large masonry tank about eighty feet square. The temple has considerable endowments bestowed by the Deshmukhs for the maintenance of the worship and for reading Pur\u00e1ns. Chikurde has a vernacular school and a village post office.\n\nChimangaon, a village of 1966 people, on the left bank of a stream about four miles north-west of Koregaon, has a ruined Hem\u00e1dpanti temple of Mah\u00e1dev. The sanctuary is modern but the hall with its sixteen pillars is old. The centre course in each pillar is well carved. The facade of the roof is of stone slabs with the usual broad eaves curved and turned-up margins. The carving in the pillars, the frieze of the plinth, and facing of the roof, is good and in a floral pattern with knots and balls. The brackets supporting the pillars are also well carved. Chimangaon was the head-quarters of B\u00e1pu Gokhle in an attack on Vardhangad fort when in 1807 he was returning to Poona after the action below Vasantgad in which the Pant Pratinidhi was taken prisoner.\u00b9\n\nDahivadi, 17\u00b0 42' north latitude and 74\u00b0 36' east longitude the head-quarters of the M\u00e1n sub-division, with a population in 1881 of 2049 being 508 less than in 1872, lies on the right bank of the M\u00e1n on the Puses\u00e1vli-Shingn\u00e1pur road, forty miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 616.\nabout four miles from the junction of the above mentioned road with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road. The river banks are low and the village is spread along the sides for about a quarter of a mile. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices, Dahivadi has a sub-judge's court, a vernacular school, a post office, and a weekly market. The revenue and police offices are in an old native mansion.\n\nDa'tegad, or Sundargad, about 2000 feet above the plain, lies three miles north-west of P\u00e9tan. It is one of the highest points for many miles and not commanded by any neighbouring hill. The ascent is about three miles by a very steep bridle path leading on to a plateau whence there is a steep ascent to the fort. The scarp is about thirty feet high, but owing to scattered boulders is in places easy to climb. About 600 feet long by 180 feet broad, the fort is oblong in shape and has an area of about three acres. The entrance is about the centre of the west face. A passage about seven feet broad is cut about twenty feet down from the top of the scarp. This passage contained a gateway of a single-pointed arch ten feet high which has now fallen in. About twenty rock-cut steps lead out on the top turning south halfway up. In the corner of the angle is a red image of M\u00e1ruti still worshipped. The walls are now in ruins and consisted originally of large laterite blocks, well cut, and put together without mortar. These must be the original structures though there are many modern additions. The wall originally had a loopholed parapet about four feet high. On the east a little more than half-way up is a curious dungeon. Some steps lead down about eight feet into the rock in which a room apparently about thirty feet by twelve and eight high has been made. It is fearfully dark and two small holes are perforated for light and air. This room, it is said, was used as an oubliette or dungeon. There is also a very curious well 100 feet deep cut twenty feet square out of the solid rock, and with a flight of sixty-four rock-cut steps twelve feet wide. The water is approached through a sort of gateway made by leaving unhewn a portion of the rock joining the two sides of the passage. The water is always good fresh and abundant. The story is that the well belongs to the Koyna river and that a leaf thrown into that river at the right place will be found floating in this well. There are two large tanks thirty feet square and a smaller one all said to be for the storage of grain. This seems doubtful; they were more probably used to store water drawn from the big well. On the south of the fort are the remains of four buildings and facing north and adjoining the rock is the kacheri building or court-house. The fort had a permanent garrison of 150 and lands were assigned for its maintenance in the neighbouring villages. Administrative orders were frequently sent for execution by the Mar\u00e1tha government to the officer in charge of this fort. Though the usual native tradition ascribes its building to Shiv\u00e1ji, documents show that the Muhammadans had possession of this fort. Its appearance makes it likely that it is older than either and the well is ascribed to mythological seers or Rishis. On the east face is a tank made in the side of the hill at the foot of the scarp and cut out of the rock in the form of a cow's mouth. It has been proposed to use this spring for a drinking and irrigation\nsupply to the town of P\u00e1tan, but the Irrigation Department have found the scheme impracticable. After the establishment of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja in 1818, Captain Grant obtained the surrender of D\u00e1tegad about May in exchange for five horses of the fort commandant which had been captured by the local militia, and promising to allow the garrison their arms and property.\n\nDeur, on a feeder of the V\u00e1rna, about ten miles north-west of Koregaon and fourteen miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is a large village with a vernacular school and a travellers' bungalow. The village lies about a mile above the junction of the old Poona and Deur-S\u00e1p roads and had, in 1881, a population of 1614 or 354 over that of 1872.\n\nIn 1713 Deur was the scene of a battle between Chandrasen J\u00e1dhav and Haibatr\u00e1v Nimb\u00e1lkar chiefly on the question of the surrender of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th, afterwards the great Peshwa, but then only in a subordinate station attached to J\u00e1dhav and deputed to superintend revenue collections for the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja. This was resented by J\u00e1dhav and B\u00e1l\u00e1ji fled for his life to P\u00e1ndugad. J\u00e1dhav demanded his surrender from Sh\u00e1hu R\u00e1ja who replied by ordering up Haibatr\u00e1v. J\u00e1dhav was defeated and retired to Kolh\u00e1pur, where he was received and given a j\u00e1gir.\u00b9\n\nDevra'shta in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, a village of 2040 people about twelve miles south-west of Vita, has a curious cluster of temples and ancient monkish cells. These lie about a couple of miles north-west of the village and a good roadway made and planted with trees by the devotees of the place leads to the bare round-topped hills near which the village lies. The temples lie in a hollow about half-way down a small gently sloping but rocky pass through an opening in the hills which forms the communication between the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and V\u00e1lva sub-divisions. They are perhaps more easily accessible from Takari village in the V\u00e1lva sub-division which has an Irrigation bungalow good to serve as a starting point. A walk north-east of about one mile along a path running between the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road and the range of hills which runs parallel to it leads to a ravine opening to the north up which the path turns. The rocks on each side are bare and rugged and the ground much broken by deep stream beds. A little scrub grows here and there. A mile of this and the ravine closes in. The path begins to ascend slightly, and after a rise of about fifty feet reaches the hollow where are the temples. The hollow is about sixty yards square and quite shut in by low rocky hills and broken ground, but contains no less than forty-three temples large and small nearly all of the same pattern, a square shrine with vestibule and a spire of brick, and all in honour of Mah\u00e1dev and containing no image but the ling. The chief temple is in the centre, and, though modernised by restoration, is apparently older than the rest. It is dedicated to Samudreshvar Mah\u00e1dev or Mah\u00e1dev of the Sea and the antiquity and sanctity of the place is derived from this temple and its accompanying cells. Entering from the south in a row on the left or west\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 189-190.\nare three temples and on the right or east are the cells, seven in a row running from west to east and then, at right angles, seven more running from south to north. These buildings are undoubtedly old and are said to have been inhabited by seers or Rishis. As there is no inscription it is difficult to fix their exact date. But legends connect the place with a R\u00e1ja of Kundal,\\(^1\\) where are a large number of Br\u00e1hmanical caves, and these cells, therefore, are probably of about the same age. They look as if they were an unfinished part of a cloistered quadrangle for a temple. The position of the temple of Samudreshvar to the north of the end of the cells would not suit with this theory, but there is a small shrine now made into a modern temple in a place almost corresponding to the centre of the quadrangle. The cells are each six feet long and four feet broad and about 5' 8\" high. They have pillars with shafts at each corner and square dome-like tops closed in with rough flat slabs. The cells all open inwards and are separated by stone partitions a foot thick, which gives some support to the quadrangle theory. They are closed at the back by a solid stone wall about two feet thick and about seven feet high including a slightly raised coping. This gives a fall for the centre roof which slopes inwards down to the broad eaves in the old Hem\u00e1dpanti style. These eaves are one foot seven inches broad, curved, and turn up at the front margin. They are kept in their places by the heavy roof slabs which overlap them some six inches. The rest of the roof is made in the same fashion, the upper slabs overlapping the lower. The coping stones at the top are about five feet long and one foot ten inches wide with wedge-shaped incisions apparently for the insertion of dovetailing blocks to hold them together. Each roof slab, where it overlaps the one below, and the eaves, is faced with mouldings and crochets. No mortar is used throughout the structure, which is of large blocks of trap finely cut. Old slabs mouldings and shafts of various fashions are scattered about different parts of the place and are worked here and there into the new temple buildings.\n\nImmediately in front of the seven cells running north are five temples in a row opening west. In a line with these cells are three more temples or rather modern chambers opening west and turning west of them are four more opening south. Facing the east row of cells are four temples in a row opening east, a dharmsh\u00e1la or rest-house and then another temple. In the centre is a small temple above alluded to, north of it another, and north of this last the temple of Samudreshvar. It has a mandap with the old style of pillars and a brick spire but no signs of antiquity. Twenty yards north of it are three masonry tanks about ten feet long and six feet broad, one below the other for different castes, always full of beautiful clear water with about nine small temples surrounding them. East of these is the road leading up to Devr\u00e1shta and beyond the road the sacred tank generally dry but when filled with water used for ablution. Its waters are supposed to have miraculous powers\n\n\\(^1\\) See below Kundal.\nand to have originally cured the R\u00e1ja of Kundal who built the cells. The legend is that a sage named Sut told the great sage Vy\u00e1s that he had been to all sacred places and yet had not been satisfied. Vy\u00e1s then informed all the Rishis that there was a sacred spot named Samudreshvar which would become known in the days of R\u00e1ja Sheteshvar. R\u00e1ja Sheteshvar once went to hunt in the Ambika country. He shot an arrow at his quarry but missed and in following it arrived at the forest of Nibid. He was in great difficulty for water and came to where the sage Sumitra was sitting. He asked him for water. But the sage was rapt in divine contemplation and would not answer him. The R\u00e1ja then got in a rage and threw some lice which were on the ground at the sage. At that moment the sage awoke from his trance, saw Sheteshvar and visited him with the curse that vermin would come out all over his body. The R\u00e1ja begged for mercy, on which the sage said the plague should occur only at night and disappear in the day, and after twelve years the sanctuary of Samudreshvar would be discovered, and his sins be cleansed there by the devoted worship of his wife. The R\u00e1ja went home and his wife passed the appointed time praying for him and cleansing him day by day of the vermin that appeared on him at night. He then went to hunt in the same part of the country and was again in difficulties for water, when he saw a small rill trickling from a rock in the Sahy\u00e1dris. Its water he took in his hand, washed with it his eyes and mouth and when he got home his wife noticed at night that his hand eyes and mouth were free from the vermin plague. The wife then suggested that he should go to the spring wherewith he had washed. He made a large tank where the rill had appeared, and washed his whole body, when the vermin entirely disappeared. On inquiring for the origin of this sacred water he was told by K\u00e1rtik Sv\u00e1mi that it came from the head of Shankar. The reason of its appearance and the name Samudreshvar are thus explained: Shankar killed a gigantic sea demon called Jalandar. The sea or Samudra, delighted at this, worshipped Shankar and asked him to manifest himself at some spot where Samudra would put up the ling in his honour. Shankar consented and out of his head sprang a branch of the Ganges which was the rill Sheteshvar found and hence the name Samudreshvar. Shankar promised to favour this spot as he did Benares itself. The legends contain no account of how the cells were built. The other shrines here were built in honour of various manifestations of Shankar and kindred deities. A prince named Bil R\u00e1ja erected one and Somn\u00e1th of Sorath, a name which seems to have some reference to the celebrated K\u00e1thi\u00e1war temple destroyed by Muhammad of Gazni, is another. Another prince mentioned is Giri R\u00e1ja, but there seem to be no historical personages corresponding to these names. The cells are said to have been built by Hingandev, the king who is said to have built the well at Mhasurne or Hingankhadi in Khat\u00e1v; while the village of Hingangad close by in the Kh\u00e1napur sub-division is perhaps named after him. His place of residence is said to have been Kaundanyapur which is said to be the same as Kundal, the Pant Pratinidhi\u2019s village about four miles to the south-east.\nDha'vadshi village about six miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is interesting as the head-quarters or sansth\u00e1n and afterwards as the burial place or sam\u00e1dhi of Bh\u00e1rgavr\u00e1m the spiritual teacher or mah\u00e1purush of B\u00e1j\u00edr\u00e1v the second Peshwa, and his son B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1j\u00edr\u00e1v or N\u00e1na S\u00e1heb, the third Peshwa. B\u00e1j\u00edr\u00e1v and his son reported all their proceedings to Bh\u00e1rgavr\u00e1m. Their letters are valuable historical records.\n\nDivashi Khurd village in P\u00e1tan, alienated to N\u00e1g\u00f3jir\u00e1v P\u00e1tankar, contains a curious cave and spring sacred to Dv\u00e1reshvar Mah\u00e1dev and R\u00e1mchandra. The cave lies seven miles north-west of P\u00e1tan on a platform of rock on the east side of the spur ending at D\u00e1tegad, and about 700 feet above the plain. Two hundred feet higher is the large mura or ledge generally found on the sides of these hills and 100 feet above this the rocky ridge or hogback which crowns this spur throughout. The worshippers are chiefly unmarried Jangams or Ling\u00e1yat priests. The cave is about 200 feet long, thirty-five feet deep, and six to eight feet high. In the centre is the Mah\u00e1dev shrine and twenty yards to the north a shrine of R\u00e1mchandra. The Jangams have maths or cells all along the cave leaving spaces for the temples about twenty feet square. They make themselves and their cattle fairly comfortable by blocking up the rock with mud partitions and doorways. The water drips from a spring in the solid rock above the Mah\u00e1dev cave. The Mah\u00e1dev cave has a little wood ornamentation put up by a member of the P\u00e1tankar family about eighty years ago, but except its size and curious nature the cave has nothing very remarkable. Great holiness attaches to the place and it is visited by pilgrims from the Karn\u00e1tak and elsewhere. Jatr\u00e1s or fairs are held in honour of Mah\u00e1dev on the first day of M\u00e1rghshirsh or November-December and in honour of R\u00e1mchandra on the first of Chaatra or March-April and are attended by about 500 people from the neighbouring villages.\n\nDhom village lies on the north bank of the Krishna about five miles north-west of W\u00e1i with which it is connected by a broad cleared track maintained in fair repair from Local Funds. The population consists mainly of the Br\u00e1hman worshippers at the temples which form the only objects of interest in the village. The chief temple is between the village and the river and is dedicated to Mah\u00e1dev. It consists of a shrine and a veranda, and in front of these small Saracenic scollopped arches supported on pillars about six feet high and a foot thick. The arches and the inside walls are of highly polished basalt. The shrine is fifteen feet long and fourteen feet broad and the veranda fifteen feet broad and eighteen feet long projecting two feet on each side of the shrine making the length of the whole structure thirty-eight feet. The veranda arches are covered with leaves and what appear to be cones. Beyond the arches, on each side of the facade, is a broad band of wall carved in arabesques. The height of the building including the spire is probably not more than forty feet, and, except the spire which is of brick, it is all made of basalt. The spire in two twelve-sided tiers with\n\n---\n\n1 Captain Grant Duff in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Records. See above p. 278.\nan urn-shaped pinnacle on the top. The urn rests on a sort of basin the edges of which are carved in a lotus leaf pattern. There are similar small pinnacles at the corners of the shrine and the mandap. The whole building is raised from the ground on a plinth about two feet high. Four feet in front is the sacred bull Nandi well carved of polished basalt and under a canopy surmounted by a dome. It is seated upon the back of a turtle represented as in the act of swimming and surrounded by a stone basin by filling which it is intended to complete the illusion. The canopy is octagonal supported on scollopped arches similar to those in the shrine. The bull is in the usual reclining attitude with the point of the right foot resting on the tortoise and the right knee bent as if about to rise. The usual trappings, necklace bells, and saddle cloth are carved in stone. The tortoise is circular with feet and head stretching out from under the shell and very roughly done. It rests on a circular basement and has a diameter of about fifteen feet. The sides and margin of the basement are tastefully cut so as to represent the fringe of the lotus flower. The canopy is surmounted by a small octagonal spire or shikhar eight feet high, and profusely decorated in stucco. The basin in which this structure rests is circular, about two feet deep and twenty feet in diameter and is simply sunk into the pavement of the court with a small turned back lip or margin. Round this chief temple are four others dedicated to Narsinh, Ganpati, Lakshmi, and Vishnu which contain yellow marble images of those divinities said to have been brought from Agra. One temple which stands outside by itself represents the Shiv Panchayatan. Four heads look to the four cardinal points of the compass and the fifth heavenwards.\n\nOf the other four temples the Narsinh temple deserves mention for its curious hideosity. It has a circular basement on an octagonal plinth about six feet high and surmounted by a hideous structure made of mixed stucco and wood and supposed to represent an umbrella. All these buildings are in a paved court 100 feet by 120 with brick walls about twelve feet high. There is an entrance consisting of a stone pointed archway which by itself is not unimposing, but the walls are very much out of keeping. These temples were all built by Mah\u00e1dev Shivram a Poona moneylender who flourished about 1780 A.D. A side door from the temple courtyard leads to a flight of steps built about the same time by one Narayanav Vaidya. On the right is a small temple to Ram attributed to the last Peshwa Bajirav II. (1796-1817). Its conical spire has been broken off by the fall of a tree. Below this and facing the river is a sort of cloister containing an image of Ganpati. The arches are pointed and the date of the building is probably about 1780 A.D. About half a mile up the river is a small temple to Mah\u00e1dev built by Shahu (1708-1749) who came to Dhom to bathe in the river. The place is held in great veneration and the Mah\u00e1dev ling is said to have been first set up by a Rishi named Dhaumya said to have come from the source of the Krishna at Mah\u00e1baleshwar. A fair or jatra in honour of Mah\u00e1dev takes place on the full-moon of Vaishakh or April-May and one in honour of Narsinh on the bright fourteenth of Vaishakh.\nGunvantgad or Morgiri Fort, six miles south-west of P\u00e1tan, is a steep oblong hill about 1000 feet above the plain. The walls have fallen in. There is a well but no marks of habitation and no gateways remain. The hill is the end of a lofty spur branching in a south-east direction from the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dris at Mala. The fort is completely commanded from this spur with which it is connected by a narrow neck of land a quarter of a mile long. The north-east corner of the fort is the highest point and the ground slopes irregularly to the south-west. The form is not unlike a lion couchant, which is the supposed meaning of the word morgiri. Part of the village of Morgiri lies close below the south-east side of the fort, while there is another hamlet similarly situated on a shoulder of the hill to the north-west.\n\nThe fort has no signs of age. In the eighteenth century it appears to have maintained a garrison of the Peshwa's soldiery when D\u00e1tegad held people attached to the Pant Pratinidhi and the authorities of the two forts seem to have thrown difficulties in the way of executing orders issued by the governments they opposed. In the Mar\u00e1tha war of 1818 the fort surrendered to the British without resistance.\n\nHelv\u00e1k is a village of 376 people on the north of the Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road, thirteen miles west of P\u00e1tan, at the point where the Koyna river turns at right angles from its southerly to an easterly course. From the west flows a small stream up the valley of which the Kumbh\u00e1rli road climbs till the edge of the Sahy\u00e1dris. The ascent is not more than 300 feet in four miles and the incline moderate. At the village of Mendheghar just opposite Helv\u00e1k is a small Public Works bungalow which serves well for a resting place. Carts on their way to and from Chiplun usually halt here and during the busy season the number of carts is the same as at P\u00e1tan. In the angle formed by the Koyna river is a large flat space given up in the rains to rice fields and in the fair weather to a camping ground for carts, when temporary shops for grain and other necessaries are formed under booths, and the scene is one of constant bustle and activity. The cultivators of the neighbouring hill villages bring down bundles of firewood usually k\u00e1rv\u00ed which they sell to the cartmen partly for their own use, but also in considerable and increasing amounts to the return cartmen who take them as far as Kar\u00e1d or even further and sell them for ten times what they give in Helv\u00e1k, which is about $\\frac{3}{4}d.$ to $2\\frac{1}{4}d.$ (as. $\\frac{1}{2}$-1$\\frac{1}{2}$) per load according to size and weight. The cultivators above Helv\u00e1k also bring down rafters and poles on rafts to Kar\u00e1d. About six men accompany each raft. The river Koyna is a succession of pools and by a little portage over the intervening shingles the people are able in the earlier part of the dry season, as far as January, to bring down the wood to Kar\u00e1d in about ten days. This traffic is increasing but is at present only confined to alienated villages, no extensive cuttings except in one recent case having yet been made in Government forests. The wood was sold at Helv\u00e1k by auction and probably much besides is taken east either by return\n\n1 Ascertained from papers produced during an enquiry into a hereditary office case.\ncarts or by water. At Nechla village three miles west of Helv\u00e1k is a fine stretch of virgin forest worth a visit. At Khemse on the edge of the Sahy\u00e1dris is another small bungalow but not kept in good order. Its windows give a fine view down to Chiplun, but the line of the Sahy\u00e1dris is not well seen from here as projections shut out the more distant hills. The Kumbh\u00e1rli hills are strikingly abrupt and bold and alone worth looking at. The view northwards of the Koyna valley is most beautiful at this point. Mahsir fishing is to be had, and Helv\u00e1k is an excellent starting point for big game shooting expeditions in every direction, bear and chital to the north, bison at Mala to the south, sambhar always and tigers occasionally on all sides.\n\nJakhinva\u2019di. See Kar\u00e1d.\n\nJangli Jaygad hill fort, about six miles north-west of Helv\u00e1k, lies on a spur projecting from the main line of the Sahy\u00e1dris into the Konkan from the village of Navje in P\u00e1tan. Perhaps the easiest way to get to the fort is to climb the hill 2000 feet or more or about three miles to Torne as far as which the ascent is easy. There is a passable footpath along the top of the hill for another three miles, where the old path from Navje village used for the fort guns is hit. This is in fine perennial forest. A mile over dead leaves and slippery but clear walking brings one to the edge of the Sahy\u00e1dris and nearly all the rest of the way is through dense bamboo forest and undergrowth through which it may be necessary to hack the way. At last the edge of the prominence is reached and the fort is seen about a hundred yards off and as many feet lower. To reach it a narrow neck of unsafe land has to be crossed through a thick growth of k\u00e1rv\u00ed bush. A most unpleasant scramble leads to the gate on the north entirely in ruins. The fort is oblong and about 180 yards long and about 150 wide. A good many ruined buildings and one or two large and a good many small tanks inside the fort show that it was permanently garrisoned. Outside underneath the scarp about fifty feet high are several cave tanks with excellent water. At the western end the drop is very sudden for about a hundred feet, and the rest of the descent to the Konkan is very steep and impracticable. The forest once cleared, however, the difficulties of approach from Navje are not insurmountable. Though very rarely visited on account of the thick forest to be passed, the magnificent view of the line of the Sahy\u00e1dris right up to the saddleback hill or Makrandgad makes it well worth a visit. According to a local story T\u00e1i Telin the mistress of the Pant Pratinidhi held possession of this fort in 1810 and B\u00e1pu Gokhle drove her out of it. It surrendered to a British force under Col. Hewett in May 1818.\n\nJa\u2019vli, with in 1881 a population of 206, is a small village situated on a ravine about two miles east of Prat\u00e1pgad and about three miles north-west of Malcolmpeith as the crow flies, but down a tremendously steep descent. The village is of great interest as giving its name to the large mountainous tract extending probably as far as the V\u00e1rna river which was one of the earliest Mar\u00e1tha states since Muhamadan times. It was formerly under some chieftains named Shirke of whose family a representative still exists in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra enjoying alienated villages in the south of the\ndistrict. The Shirkes possessed this tract till towards the end of the fifteenth century, when Chandrar\u00e1v More was given 12,000 Hindu infantry by the first Bij\u00e1pur king Yusuf Adil Sh\u00e1h (1489-1510) to undertake their conquest. In this Chandrar\u00e1v was successful, dispossessing the Shirkes and stopping the depredations of their abettors the Gujars, Manulkars, Mah\u00e1diks of T\u00e1rle in P\u00e1tan, and Mohites. More was given the title of Chandrar\u00e1v, and his son Yashvantr\u00e1v, distinguishing himself in a battle near Purandhar with the Ahmadnagar forces of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1msh\u00e1h (1508-1553) by capturing a standard, was confirmed in succession to his father. He retained the title of Chandrar\u00e1v and for seven generations the family administered the district with mildness and efficiency. In consideration of their unalterable fidelity the Muhamma\u0111an government allowed them to hold these barren regions at a nominal tribute. This they continued till in 1655 Shiv\u00e1ji attempted to corrupt the ruling chief. He still remained faithful. He had given passage to Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1j an emissary of the Bij\u00e1pur government sent to seize Shiv\u00e1ji, who therefore determined to regard him as an enemy. But the hillmen then had the character they have now, and formed as good infantry as Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s own, while the R\u00e1ja\u2019s son brother and minister Himmatr\u00e1v were all thought good soldiers. Shiv\u00e1ji then had recourse to stratagem and sent two agents R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l a Br\u00e1hman and Sambh\u00e1ji K\u00e1vji a Mar\u00e1tha ostensibly to arrange a marriage between Shiv\u00e1ji and the daughter of Chandrar\u00e1v. They came to J\u00e1vl\u00ed with twenty-five M\u00e1vl\u00eds, and R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l and Sambh\u00e1ji then formed the design of assassinating Chandrar\u00e1v. It was approved by Shiv\u00e1ji who secretly advanced to Mah\u00e1baleshvar through the forests with troops. R\u00e1gho Ball\u00e1l then asked a private interview with the R\u00e1ja and his brother, assassinated them both with the help of Sambh\u00e1ji, and escaped into the forests to Shiv\u00e1ji. The latter thereon attacked J\u00e1vl\u00ed which fell after a brave resistance. Himmatr\u00e1v was killed and the R\u00e1ja\u2019s sons made prisoners. Since then the tract had been in the hands of the descendants of Shiv\u00e1ji and the Peshwa government until reduced by the English. Though it was evidently the residence of the Mores, there are no remains to show that it was a place of note.\n\nKadegaon is a village of 2608 people or 103 more than in 1872, on the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road about a mile and a half west of Kadepur and eleven miles east of Kar\u00e1d. It is well situated on the bank of a stream forming part of the catchment of the Chikli canal, with on its west a fine mango grove which is one of the favourite camps in the district. The town is walled as usual with mud and stones. In the centre is a tower situated on a knoll and rising above the rest of the village. There are gates on all four sides flanked with bastions. All these are now in ruins. A small mosque a K\u00e1zi and a Musalm\u00e1n population remain to show that the village was held in force by the Musalm\u00e1ns. Most of the leading local\n\n---\n\n1 See above p.233.\nmoneylenders and traders reside here, and the town has a small local trade. The village has a vernacular school in a good building.\n\n**Kadepur** thirteen miles east of Kar\u00e1d is a village of 1330 people or 299 more than in 1872 situated at the junction of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon and Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur roads. The village is remarkable only for an old temple which stands on a hill to the southwest and the spire of which is a conspicuous object for miles round.\n\n**Ka'le** nine miles south of Kar\u00e1d is a large agricultural village with in 1881 a population of 5169. The people are unusually enterprising and have an unusually flourishing school attended by about 150 boys.\n\n**Kam\u00e1lgad Fort**, 4511 feet above sea level, is situated about ten miles due west of W\u00e1i. The hill divides the head of the Krishna valley. To the north of it flows the V\u00e1lki, and to the south the Krishna proper, the two streams meeting at its eastern base. The top of the hill is approached by unfrequented footpaths from Asgaon to the east, from Vasole to the north, and from Partavdi to the south. The top of the hill consists of an area of only three or four acres quite flat and surrounded by a low scarp and can now be reached only by arduously scaling the scarp. Formerly the approach was by an artificial funnel or tunnel leading upwards from the base of the scarp and issuing on the top. This funnel is now blocked by a large boulder which has fallen into it. There are now no traces of any buildings on the top nor of any walls or gateway. There is only a hole which is said to be the remains of a deep well sunk right through the rocky layer constituting the scarp and penetrating to the soil below which seems still to be full of water. The hole is now only eighteen to twenty feet deep though the well was thirty or forty. The sides of the well which were formed of the natural rock are said to have contained recesses in which criminals were placed to choose between starvation and throwing themselves down into the water. No traces of the recesses now remain. No one lives on the hill, its sides are covered with thick scrub and water is found only at the base of the scarp. The lands belong to the village of Asgaon. There are no Gadkaris in connection with the fort. To the west of the base of the scarp is a rude temple dedicated to Gorakhn\u00e1th. The builder of the fort is unknown, but it is probably very old. In April 1818 Kam\u00e1lgad surrendered after a slight resistance to a British detachment under Major Thatcher.\n\n**Kanerkhed** in Koregaon with 894 people or 194 less than in 1872 is an insignificant village only remarkable as the birthplace of the founder of the Sindia family. They were p\u00e1t\u00edls or headmen of Kanerkhed and the present officiators are deputies appointed by the Gwalior family. The village can be easily reached by taking the S\u00e1p road for six miles from Koregaon and then turning east where the road meets Nigadi village.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. H. R. Cooke, C.S.\nKara'd, properly Karh\u00e1d, 17\u00b017' north latitude 74\u00b013' east longitude, at the junction of the Krishna and the Koyna thirty-one miles south of S\u00e1t\u00e9ra, is a very old town, the head-quarters of the Kar\u00e1d sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 10,778. Approaching Kar\u00e1d from any side two tall minarets, like chimneys rising out of what appears a dead level plain, strike the eye. Coming close the town appears situated at the junction of the Krishna and Koyna rivers, the Koyna having turned almost north and the Krishna running about south-east. On joining the two rivers flow eastward for a couple of miles, when the course again turns south. Thus the banks on which Kar\u00e1d is situated form a right angle against the apex of which the Krishna rushes at full tilt. The north-west side of the town is in places from eighty to a hundred feet high above the Koyna, overhung with bushes and prickly pear. The northern side is rather lower and less steep, the slope being broken by the steps or gh\u00e1ts bending down to the river. Six miles to the north-west is the fort of Vasantgad hidden by the ends of the spur which branch out beyond it to within three miles of the town. Four miles north-east the flat-topped hill of Sad\u00e1shivgad is in full view, while the same distance to the south-east is the peak of Ag\u00e1shiv about 1200 feet above the plain which crowns the north-west arm, honeycombed with Buddhist caves, of the spur which forms the south-west wall of the Kole valley. These hills are more or less bare, though green is struggling up the hollow. But the soil below is some of the most fertile in the district and green with crops to the end of February. The high red banks of the Koyna, the broad rocky bed and scarcely less lofty banks of the Krishna with broad pools of water at the very hottest season fringed with b\u00e1bhuls or overhung by the irregular buildings of the town, the hills filling up the distance on every side, with a clear atmosphere and the morning and evening lights make up an interesting view. The Koyna is crossed by a lofty bridge which is best seen from the north-west angle of the town where it is viewed obliquely, and, at a little distance, the irregular Ag\u00e1shiv spur gives a good back ground. No less than five roads, the Poona-Belgaum, Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun, Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon, Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur, and Kar\u00e1d-Masur, meet at Kar\u00e1d. The Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur and Kar\u00e1d-Masur roads enter the town from the left and the others from the right bank of the Krishna. The town covers an area of about half a mile square and is surrounded, except where the rivers bound it, by rich black soil lands. It is therefore crowded and, except on the south-east, has little room for extension. At the north-west angle is the mud fort originally Muhammadan if not earlier, and subsequently the palace of the Pant Pratinidhi until his power was wrested from him by the Peshw\u00e1s in 1807. Next to the fort are the set of steps or gh\u00e1ts and temples at the junction of the two rivers, the eddies of which have accumulated a huge bed of gravel and sand. To withstand their force a large masonry revetment was built in ancient times remains of which still exist. In this the north-west quarter live the chief Br\u00e1hman families, and here are the sub-divisional revenue and police offices and a large anglo-veracular school. This quarter is bounded on the west and south by two streets one running north and another east. At their junction is the municipal office and immediately\nsouth of it is a mosque and minarets. Following the east street known as the Peth two Musalm\u00e1n tombs of some pretensions and the municipal garden are passed on the right. Walking south about 600 yards and turning east are reached the post office and sub-judge's court. Another 150 yards lead to the dispensary on the right and a hundred more to the travellers' bungalow on the left of the road. The street running north and south contains the houses and shops of the chief traders, and a weekly market is held here on Sunday. About a hundred yards south of the mosque is a turn east which leads to the market place, an open square with a small slightly raised space in the centre where the people sit and sell vegetables and other small ware on market days. Here live a considerable colony of Musalm\u00e1ns, some of whom reside round about the mosque and others, among whom is the descendant of the K\u00e1z\u00eds originally appointed by the Bij\u00e1pur kings, in the south-west angle of the town. The Mh\u00e1rs and other outcastes live in the south and the bulk of the Kunbi population in the north-east. The weavers and Shimpis occupy the rest of the south-west part of the town. The chief streets are about twenty feet broad, the others are less so, and carts find it difficult to pass each other as the already narrow roadway is still further cramped by the deep open gutters on each side, which serve more to accumulate than to clear away filth. The chief streets are kept fairly clean and water is supplied to part of the town by an iron pipe. Three quarters of a mile to the south-east lies the old Musalm\u00e1n burial ground with a large idga or place of prayer and about 200 yards to the west of the travellers' bungalow is a large iron-roofed rest-house and the Executive Engineer's bungalow.\n\nThere are in all fifty-two chief temples in Kar\u00e1d, none of them of much antiquity or beauty. The largest are those of Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1i Devi and K\u00e1shivishveshvar on the Krishna gh\u00e1t and Kamaleshvar Mah\u00e1dev half a mile further down the river. They mostly consist of the usual mandap or hall and g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra or sanctuary with brick shikhars or spires adorned with rough figures in stucco. The gh\u00e1ts consist of three chief flights one bending from the Br\u00e1hman quarter and another from the north end of the principal street. These have been built chiefly by voluntary contributions from the inhabitants. Much has been done by the Pant Pratinidhi and a good deal by devotees, rich tradesmen, and others, while a handsome addition was lately made by N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v Anant Mut\u00e1l\u00edk, the descendant of the hereditary chief officer of the Pratinidhis. A third flight is the end of a roadway brought eastward from the municipal garden. It is built by the municipality and made of excellent masonry. Although the temples singly are of no great beauty, yet the groups of them at the gh\u00e1ts look very picturesque. The ground is terraced and adorned with fine old trees chiefly tamarind and p\u00edmpal. On Fridays when the women of the town assemble in their holiday dress to do honor to Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1i Devi, their graceful figures dotted about the temples lend much life and colour to the scene.\n\nThe mud fort of the Pratinidhi occupies a space of about a hundred\nyards square at the north-east angle of the town. Its frontage is to the east and towards the chief street from which it is entered by a broad flight of steps. The steps pass through two gateways crowned with music chambers or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00e1s and flanked by two large bastions. Inside are a number of buildings the chief of which is the v\u0101da or mansion of the Pant Pratinidhi. It is a two-storeyed building in the usual open court Mar\u00e1tha style. The only remarkable thing about it is an extra quadrangle on the south side of which is a fine hall of audience measuring eighty-three feet by thirty-one feet and about fifteen feet high. It consists of a central nave fourteen feet wide and two side aisles. The east end contains a canopy for Bhav\u00e1ni Devi, in whose honor the hall was built. The ceiling is of teakwood and ornamented with a lace work of wood and iron painted black. It was built about 1800 by K\u00e1shib\u00e1i mother of Parshur\u00e1m Shriniv\u00e1s Pratinidhi. The rest of the quadrangle was completed in much the same style by the present Pratinidhi\u2019s father. The most remarkable object in the fort is its step well. It lies near the west end of the fort which overhangs the Koyna river some eighty to a hundred feet, and is dug right down to the level of the river with which it communicates by a pipe. The opening at the top is 136 feet long. The west end of it is thirty-six feet square with the north-east corner rounded off for the purposes of a water-lift. The other 100 feet are for a magnificent flight of eighty steps leading down to the water level. The well must have been dug in softish material probably murum, and, to prevent it falling in, it has been lined with excellent trap masonry in mortar, the sides slightly sloping from bottom outwards, each line of stones slightly protruding beyond the line above. At the end of each twenty steps is a landing about three times the width of each step. The flight of steps and the main shaft of the well are separated by two massive ogee archways, which, together with the mortar used in the masonry, seem to show that the work is Muhammadan. These archways are connected with each side of the well and form a massive block between the steps and shaft with the archways cut in them. The block is about seventy feet high and twelve feet thick, while the archways are about thirty feet and twenty feet high, the solid masonry above each of them being about ten feet in height. The sides also have their peculiar longitudinal rectangular grooves on a level with the three landings with ten semicircular transverse cuttings at regular intervals. The object of this, it is said, was to insert flooring along the grooves to be supported by transverse beams thrust into the cuttings, and thus convert the well into a three-storeyed underground building with communications between each story by the flight of steps and between the shaft and step sections by the archways. What can have been the use of such a building it is difficult to imagine. According to one story it was for ambuscade in case the fort was taken. But it looks more like an attempt to use the well, which was not often wanted for water-supply, for storage purposes. There is nothing else remarkable in the fort. It has twelve bastions two about the centre and one at each corner of its four sides which form nearly a rhombus with the\nacute angle at the north-east. The walls all vary according to the level of the ground inside from twenty to eight feet in height including a mud parapet six feet high and loopholed obliquely. The lower parts are of loose rubble and mud fully eight feet thick. But for the bastions the top level is uniform. Outside the height varies with the ground from forty to nearly 100 feet at the highest point above the Koyna river. A huge retaining wall of mortared trap was formerly built at the west side round the north-west angle, mostly, it is said, in Musalm\u00e1n times. The greater part of it however has been swept away, the last and worst damage within memory being done at the great flood of 1875. So tremendous is the force of the flood waters at the junction of the Krishna and the Koyna that it is a wonder the work has stood so long. Every year the river is damaging the west side and it is to be feared the curious step well may fall in as the damage increases. A small entrance leads from between two bastions to the Krishna and the small temple of Sangameshvar Mah\u00e1dev probably the oldest at Kar\u00e1d. The mosque and minarets of Kar\u00e1d are scarcely inferior in interest to the fort. Inscriptions show the date of its foundation and the builder to be one Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in the time of the fifth Bij\u00e1pur king Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h I. (1557-1580). The minarets, 106 ft. high, are plain and cylindrical slightly tapering with an urn-like top. They rest on a massive ogee archway of plain masonry about thirty feet by fifteen feet with chambers in the sides and entered by a small low door which leads to an open space. On the left or north is a plain square building for the shelter of travellers and mendicants and the bath or ham\u00e1mkh\u00e1na and on the right or south is the mosque. This is a building open to the east about forty-one feet by eighty-two and thirty feet high. But for the usual dome in the centre and eight pinnacles one at each corner and one at the centre of each side, it is flat-roofed outside. The outside is of plain smooth cut masonry with broad slabs for eaves supported by handsomely carved brackets. The east front consists of three ogee arches supported by square pillars, the two side ones plain and the centre one ornamented with frills and knobs. The roof rests from within on two more pillars, thus making six compartments the roofing of each ornamented and slightly domed with vaulting sections. Between the pillars are four transverse arches similar to the longitudinal ones. The two central compartments are richly sculptured with floral and bead decorations and Arabic texts. In the centre of the west wall is a niche something like a recess with a long inscription in Arabic on black stone. There are in all nine inscriptions and texts on various parts of the walls:\n\nOne on a pillar records \"Ibra'h\u00edm Kha'n bin Kamil Kha'n bin Isma'el Kha'n servant in the house of God;\" the second round a pillar records \"When the assistance of God shall come and the victory, and they shall see the people enter into the religion of God by troops, celebrate the praise of thy Lord and ask pardon of him, for he is inclined to forgive;\" the third \"During the time of Sh\u00e1'h Ali Adil Sha'h, the shelter of all the people and the shadow of the favour of God\u2014may he continue faithful and enjoy health and Khilat (or grant) to Ibra'h\u00edm Ka'mil Kha'n a friend of the family;\" the fourth on another pillar records \"The beggarly powerless and dust-like Pehelwa'n Ali bin Ahmad Ispahani, a servant of God in this house of God, Sunah 983 titled (?) Tuzyet Kha'n. Completed on this date. Pray for the welfare of the builder of this mosque;\" the fifth an Arabic inscription on a pillar\nrecords \"May God forgive its builder for the sake of Muhammad and his descendants;\" the sixth also an Arabic inscription on the top of an arch records \"I bear witness that there is certainly no God but God, that he is only one and that he has no sharers and I bear witness that Muhammad is certainly his servant and prophet;\" the seventh is at the foot of an arch in Kufic characters, which cannot be made out. On the top are the two remaining inscriptions recording \"O Ali there is nobody young but Ali. There is no sword but the Zul Fikr.1 God send blessing to Muhammad the chosen (of God), Ali the approved, Hassan the elect (of God), Hussain who became a martyr at Kerbalah, Zainul'Abidin Muhammad, Bakar, Ja'far Sa'dik, Musa-ul-Ka'zim, Muhammad Taki Ali Naki, Hasan Ashkari, Muhammad Madhi. The most high and glorious God hath said: But he only shall visit the temples of God who believeth in God and the last day, and is constant at prayer, and payeth the legal alms, and feareth God alone. These perhaps may become of the number of those who are rightly directed.\" And \"Do ye reckon the giving drink to the pilgrims and the visiting of the holy temple to be actions as meritorious as those performed by him who believeth in God and the last day and fighteth for the religion of God? The most high and glorious God hath said\u2014regularly perform thy prayer at the setting of the sun, and at the first darkness of the night and the prayer of daybreak, for the prayer of daybreak is borne witness unto by the angels, and watch some part of the night in the same exercise as a work of supererogation, for peradventure, the Lord will raise thee to an honourable station. And say, O Lord cause me to enter with a favourable entry and cause me to come forth with a favourable coming forth; and grant me from thee an assisting power.\"2\n\nThe mosque has a mulla attached. The tombs adjoining the municipal gardens are in honor of Musalm\u00e1n saints. One of them has a curious canopy on the top of its dome, and is not unhandsome. There are also two large masonry darg\u00e1hs or mausoleums in the Guruv\u00e1r Peth built in 1350 and 1391 (H. 752 and 793) in honour of two Musalm\u00e1n saints. The idga or prayer place is a wall about 250 feet long by thirty feet high, with a platform built about twenty-five feet off the ground for preaching purposes. The wall is built of stone below and brick for the last six feet above. It is about nine feet thick at the base and four feet thick at the top. Round the idga is the old Musalm\u00e1n burial ground.\n\nThe trade of Kar\u00e1d is nearly all in the carrying and money-lending line. There are about 400 traders, mostly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Telis, Sangars, Koshtis, Shimpis, and Musalm\u00e1ns, and the town contains branches of the largest moneylending and exchange houses in the district. It also contains several correspondents of houses elsewhere engaged in the export and import traffic with Chiplun. But except for the local supply there is but little stationary trade at Kar\u00e1d. A gigantic through traffic passes over the Kar\u00e1d-Chiplun road which is fed almost wholly from the south and south-east by the Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon and Kolh\u00e1pur roads. The Koyna bridge toll which is only one-fourth of the ordinary rate sold for \u00a3550 (Rs. 5500) in 1884-85, and in the busy season from the middle of February to the middle of May, it was found that about eight hundred carts passed through every day. The local market consists of grain, cloth, piecegoods, household pottery and utensils but sparingly of cattle which are usually bought and sold at Bhilavdi. Kar\u00e1d has no local manufacture of importance.\n\n---\n\n1 The Zul Fikr is the famous two-edged sword of Ali which Muhammad said he had received from the angel Gabriel.  \n2 Dr. Burgess' Antiquarian Lists, 60-61.\nKar\u00e1d suffered severely in a heavy Krishna flood in 1844. A large part of the retaining wall at the north-west of the town was swept away and the water rose to within twenty feet of the top of the fort wall. The chief streets were flooded and the houses in front of the Pant's fort were all swept away. Much injury was done to the gh\u00e1ts and temples on the river bank. A small stone temple of M\u00e1ruti in the centre of the stream said to have been covered with the rain water year after year for two centuries was injured for the first time.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a population of 11,410 of whom 9845 were Hindus and 1565 Musalm\u00e1ns. The 1881 census showed a fall of 632 or 10,778 of whom 9281 were Hindus, 1495 Musalm\u00e1ns, and two Christians. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices Kar\u00e1d has a municipality, sub-judge's court, dispensary, traveller's bungalow, and six schools. The municipality which was established in 1855 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a31045 (Rs.10,450) and an expenditure of \u00a3429 (Rs.4290). The dispensary treated in 1883 in-patients eleven and out-patients 5852 at a cost of \u00a3100 (Rs.1000). When the West Deccan Railway is furnished Kar\u00e1d will have a station called Kar\u00e1d Road four miles on its east. Of the six schools one is an anglo-vernacular school, three Mar\u00e1thi, one Hindust\u00e1ni, and one a girl's school.\n\nThe Buddhist caves, which form the chief object of antiquarian interest in Kar\u00e1d, are in the hills to the south-west of the town the nearest being about two and a half miles from the town, in the northern face of one of the spurs of the Ag\u00e1shiv hill, looking towards the Koyna valley; the most distant group are in the southern face of another spur to the west of Jakhinv\u00e1di village, and from three to four miles from Kar\u00e1d.\n\nThe caves were first described by Sir Bartle Frere in 1849, and arranged into three series: the southern group of twenty-three caves, near the village of Jakhinv\u00e1di; nineteen caves, in the southeast face of the northern spur; and twenty-two scattered caves facing the Koyna valley. Besides these sixty-three caves there are many small excavations of no note and numerous water-cisterns, often two to a single cave.\n\nThe absence of pillars in the larger halls, the smallness of many of the excavations, the frequency of stone-benches for beds in the cells, the primitive forms of the chaityas, and the almost entire absence of sculpture in these caves, combine to show their early age. Unfortunately they are cut in a very coarse, soft, amygdaloid rock, on which inscriptions could not be expected to remain legible for long ages, if many of them ever existed; and only a portion of one has been found, with the faintest trace of another. The letters are rudely cut, but appear to belong to the same period as most of the K\u00e1rl\u00e9 inscriptions of about the first or second century after Christ. From all such indications these caves may be placed approximately about the same age as those of Shel\u00e1rv\u00e1di or G\u00e1rodi.\n\n---\n\n1 Fergusson and Burgess' Cave Temples of India, 213-217.\nin Poona and Kuda and P\u00e1l in Kol\u00e1ba, and not far from the age of the Junnar and N\u00e1sik caves.\\(^1\\)\n\nThey are mostly so small and uninteresting that they need not be described in detail, and only a few of the more noteworthy and characteristic may be noticed. In the first group, the most westerly cave I. has had a veranda, perhaps with two pillars and corresponding pilasters; but it has been walled up by a modern mendicant. Beyond this is a hall (22' x 11' x 7') with a bench along the back and ends; and at the back of this, again, are two cells with stone-benches. Cave II. has a hall about thirty-four feet square, and its veranda has been supported by two square pillars.\n\nCave V. is a chaitya or chapel facing south-west, and is of the same style as one of the Junnar caves, but still plainer. It has a semicircular apse at the back and arched roof but no side aisles, and in place of the later arched window over the door it has only a square window. At each side of the entrance is a pilaster, of which the lower portions are now destroyed, but which has the N\u00e1sik style of capital crowned by three square flat members supporting, the one a wheel or chakra the emblem of the Buddhist doctrine or law, and the other a lion or sinha a cognizance of Buddha himself who is frequently called Sh\u00e1kya Sinha. The dome of the relic shrine or d\u00e1gghoba inside is about two-thirds of a circle in section and supports a massive plain capital. The umbrella is hollowed into the roof over it and has been connected with the capital by a stone shaft now broken.\n\nCave VI. has had a veranda supported by two plain octagonal pillars with capitals of the N\u00e1sik Kuda and P\u00e1l type. The hall is 16' 10\" wide by 13' 5\" deep with an oblong room at each end, the left room with a bench at the inner end and the right room with a small cell. At the back is a room twelve feet wide by eighteen 'deep, containing a d\u00e1gghoba nearly seven feet in diameter, in the front of which an image of Vithoba has been carved by a mendicant.\n\nCave XI. is a rectangular chaitya or chapel about fourteen feet wide by 28' 9\" long with a flat roof. The d\u00e1gghoba is much destroyed below; its capital is merely a square block supporting the shaft of the umbrella carved on the roof. Cave XVI. is another chapel. The veranda is supported by two perfectly plain square pillars without base or capital; the hall (20' 8\" x 11' 4\") is lighted by the door and two windows, and has a recess fifteen feet square at the back containing a d\u00e1gghoba similar to that in cave XI. but in better preservation.\n\nNos. IV. IX. and XX. are the largest of the other vih\u00e1rs or dwelling caves, and have all cells with stone-beds in them.\n\nThe second group of twenty-two caves begins from the head of the ravine. The first cave is XXIV. a vih\u00e1r or dwelling cave facing east-north-east, 21' wide by 23' deep and 7' 10\" high, with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare Bombay Gazetteer, XI. 332-342, 345-348, XVI, 541-639, and XVIII. chapter xiv. G\u00e1rodi and Junnar.\na veranda originally supported by two plain square pillars. Carved on the south end wall of the veranda, near the roof, are four small chaitya or horseshoe arches, with a belt of rail-pattern above and below and a fretted torus in the spaces between the arches. Below this the wall has been divided into panels by small pilasters, which were carved, perhaps, with figures now worn away. On the north wall were three horseshoe arches, the central one being the largest, and apparently contained a dagoba in low relief as at Kond\u00e1ne in Th\u00e1na. Below this is a long recess as for a bed, now partially fallen into the water-cistern beneath. From the hall four cells open to the right, three to the back, and one to the left, each, except the centre one in the back, with a stone lattice window close to the roof and about 1' 3\" square. No. XXIX., originally two caves, of which the dividing wall has been broken through, has similar windows in four cells.\n\nCave XXX. is a ruined vih\u00e1r or dwelling cave (36' 6\" by 19') with eleven cells round the hall and a twelfth entered from one of these. From this cave about three-quarters of a mile lead to the next excavations, caves XXXI. to XXXV. of which are no ways noteworthy. Cave XXXVI. about 100 yards west of cave XXXV. consists of an outer hall about 17' by 13', with a cell in each side wall, and through it a second hall (9' 4\" \u00d7 12' 7\" \u00d7 6' 9\") is entered which has six cells and two bench-bed recesses.\n\nThe third series of twenty-two caves is divided into two groups the first facing northwards and the second in a ravine further west and facing westwards. It consists of caves XLII. to LXIII. the first five containing nothing of note. Cave XLVII. consists of a room (15' \u00d7 11' \u00d7 7' 6\") with a bench in each end, an unfinished cell at the back, and two at the left end, on the wall of one of which is the only inscription, of which any letters are traceable, recording 'The meritorious gift of a cave by Sanghamitra, the son of Gop\u00e1l(?)'. A few indistinct letters are just traceable also on the right hand side of the entrance, and near them is the faintest trace of the Buddhist rail-pattern.\n\nCave XLVIII. is a range of five cells with a veranda in front, supported on three square pillars and pilasters, the central cell (27' \u00d7 11' 3\") containing a relic shrine still entire, the upper edge of the drum and the box of the capital, which has no projecting slabs over it, being carved with the rail-pattern. The umbrella is carved on the roof and attached to the box by a shaft. In front of this, against the right-hand wall, is the only figure sculpture in these caves, and, though much defaced, appears to have consisted of three human figures, the left a man with high turban and front knob, similar to some of the figures at K\u00e1rle and on the capitals at Bedsa, holding some objects in each hand. He wears a cloth round his neck and another round his loins, which falls down in folds between the legs. His right hand is bent upwards towards his chin, and over the arm hangs a portion of the dress. He also wears armlets and bracelets. To his left a slightly smaller figure appears to be\n\n---\n\n1 Compare Bombay Gazetteer, XIV. 208-209.\napproaching him with some offering. Above this latter is a third,\u2014perhaps a woman. At the right end of this excavation is another cell approached from outside. The remaining caves in this group ending with cave LV. are small and uninteresting. The cells are not so frequently with stone-beds as in the caves previously described. From No. LV. about a mile and a half leads to LVI. which has a veranda (25' 4\" x 11' 9\") with two plain square pillars in front. The hall is about twenty-four feet square with ten cells, three in each side; and four at the back, several of them unfinished. Cave LX. is almost choked with earth, but is 38' long by 13' 10\" wide, with a semicircular apse at the extreme end and arched roof similar to the Bedsa dwelling cave II. Outside and above the front, however, are traces of a horizontal row of chaitya-window ornaments, so that, though there is no apparent trace at present of a chaitya having occupied the apse, the cave may have been a primitive form of Chaitya-cave with a structural relic shrine or d\u0101ghoba.\n\nThe first mention of Kar\u0101d appears in inscriptions of about 200 B.C. to 100 A.D. recording gifts by Kar\u0101d pilgrims at the Bharhut Stupa near Jabalpur in the Central Provinces and at Kuda thirty miles south of Alibag in Kol\u0101ba. These inscriptions show that Kar\u0101d, or, as the inscriptions call it Karah\u0101kada, is probably the oldest place in S\u0101t\u0101ra. That the place named is the S\u0101t\u0101ra Kar\u0101d is confirmed by the sixty-three early Buddhist caves about three miles south-west of Kar\u0101d one of which has an inscription of about the first century after Christ. In 1637 the seventh Bij\u0101pur king M\u0101hmud Adilsh\u0101h (1626-1656) conferred on Sh\u0101h\u0101j\u012b the father of Shiv\u0101j\u012b a royal grant for the deshmukhi of twenty-two villages in the district of Kar\u0101d. In 1653 the deshmukhi right was transferred to B\u00e1ji Ghorpade of Mudhol. In 1659, after the murder of Atzul-kh\u0101n, his wife and son, who were taken by Khanduji K\u0101kde one of Shiv\u0101j\u012b's officers, were on payment of a large bribe safely conducted and lodged by him in Kar\u0101d. In January 1661 the eighth Bij\u0101pur king Ali Adil Sh\u0101h II. (1656-1672) disappointed in his hopes of crushing Shiv\u0101j\u012b took the field in person and encamped at Kar\u0101d where all the district officers assembled to tender him their homage. In a revenue statement of about 1790 Kar\u0101d appears as the head of a pargana in the R\u0101ybagh sark\u0101r with a revenue of \u00a336,255 (Rs. 3,62,550). About 1805 the young Pratinidhi Parshur\u0101m Shr\u012bnivas fled from Poona to Kar\u0101d his j\u0101gir town to escape a plan for seizing him made by B\u0101jir\u0101v Peshwa assisted by Sindia. During his flight B\u0101jir\u0101v stopped at Kar\u0101d on the 23rd of January 1818. In 1827 Captain Clunes describes 'Kurarh' as the chief town and residence of the Pant Pratinidhi with 2500 houses including 200 weavers 100 oil-pressers twenty-five blanket-weavers and thirty paper-makers.\n\nKa'segaon in V\u00e1lva close to the S\u0101t\u0101ra-Kol\u0101pur mail road, eleven miles south of Kar\u0101d and four miles north of Peth, is one of\n\n---\n\n1 Compare Bombay Gazetteer, XVIII. chapter xiv.

The population in 1881 was 4325. The village is inhabited by several well-to-do merchants who traffic with the coast in the local produce, which consists largely of tobacco, pepper, and sugarcane. The village has a vernacular school in a good Government building. About a quarter of a mile to the south of the village is a district officers' bungalow, about the nicest in the district, in a large enclosure partly planted with young trees. The inhabitants have an unenviable character for crime and litigiousness, mischief to crops cattle-poisoning and arson having been very frequent for many years.\n\nKenjalgad or Ghera Khelanja Fort, 4269 feet above sea level, is situated on the M\u00e1ndhardev spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range eleven miles north-west of W\u00e1i. It is a flat-topped hill of an irregular oval shape, about 250 yards long and one hundred yards wide at the extremes, looking remarkably strong both from afar and near. But on ascending it is found to be commanded by the Yeruli Asre and Doichiv\u00e1di plateaus about two miles to the east which are easily ascended from the W\u00e1i side, and the J\u00e1mbl\u00ed hills about a mile to the west. The fort forms a village in itself but has to be ascended from the villages of Asre or Khavli which lie at its foot on the W\u00e1i side. The ascent is by about two miles of a very steep climb or the Asre-Titeghar bridle path can be followed for two miles when a tolerably easy path leads due west from the pass another mile on to the fort. The fort is a black scarp rising vertically from the main ridge which is hogbacked. The scarp is one of the highest in any of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forts and reaches in places eighty to a hundred feet. The only entrance is on the north side up a set of a hundred steps running parallel to the line of the scarp till within four or seven feet of the top, when they turn at right angles to it and cut straight into a passage leading on to the top. The steps are peculiarly imposing and differ from any others in the district. Thus on entering the scarp is on the left and there is nothing on the right till the passage is reached, and invaders ascending would be liable to be hurled back over the cliff. At the foot of the steps is a bastion which evidently flanked a gateway. There are remains of six large and three small buildings all modern. The head-quarters or kacheri is now only marked by a large fig tree. The only building thoroughly recognizable is the powder magazine on the west which is about thirty feet square with strong stone walls three feet thick and seven feet high and three feet of brick on the top. The walls of the fort were originally of large square cut blocks of unmortared stone, but were afterwards added to in many places. They are in most places fully four feet thick and including the rampart about eight feet thick. There was a parapet of lighter work mostly ruined. The fort has three large water tanks about forty feet square and six small ones for storage of water and grain. But there is no living spring inside the fort. The largest tank is in the southern face and is quite thirty feet deep. The tanks were emptied when the fort was dismantled by blowing up the outer sides which were formed by the ramparts and letting the water empty itself down the hill side. On the west is a sort of nose\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nKenjalgad or Ghera Khelanja Fort.\n\nprojecting beyond and a little lower than the main ridge of the fort, also strongly fortified. There is a narrow promenade on the ridge at the foot of the scarp and on the north side is a large cave with excellent water and partly used for storage purposes. The village lies about 300 feet below on a ledge of the northern hill slope. To its immediate west is a dense temple grove of jambhul and anjan. The village of Voholi, the one Government village on the north side of this range the inhabitants of which were part of the hereditary garrison, is in a hollow to the north-west. Khelanja fort is said to have been built by the Bhoj R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Panh\u00e1la who flourished in the twelfth century. Its remarkable strength is noticed by Mr. Elphinstone who says it could scarcely be taken if resolutely defended. It was one of the few S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forts which fired before surrendering to the detachment sent by General Pritzler up the W\u00e1i valley about the 26th of March 1818.\n\nKh\u00e1napur.\n\nKha'na'pur about ten miles east of Vita is a town of 4909 inhabitants or 298 more than in 1872. It gives its name to the Kh\u00e1napur sub-division and from its greater proximity to the fort of Bhop\u00e1lged was probably in early times the administrative head-quarters of the surrounding country. The town has stone and mud walls now much decayed, and gates at the north-west and east flanked with bastions. There is a large market street and several smaller branch streets and more than one large native mansion. The Kh\u00e1napur plateau produces in the western half a considerable amount of good unirrigated wheat. The land is even higher than the rest of the sub-division, the whole of which is on an average quite 250 feet above the Krishna valley. About two miles east of Vita the ground again rises more than one hundred feet. This second plateau extends from Palshi in the south-east to Balavdi and Revangaon in the north-west. There is a drop of about 500 feet into the M\u00e1n valley in the eastern side and the rest is a straggling outline of hills in the south-west and west and forming shallow valleys and ravines. This plateau is better off for rain than almost any other part of the sub-division and to this are due the regular and good wheat crops. Towards the south-east, however, the soil is wretchedly bare and rocky and the country very wild while subsistence becomes as difficult as in the worst parts of M\u00e1n. To the south of the town is a small stream which joins the Agarni a feeder of the Krishna about a mile to the east. The supply of water is limited and precarious and a camp in the tempting mango grove to the west of the town by the edge of the stream is sure to be infested by clouds of mosquitoes which swarm like midges in England on a summer's evening. Kh\u00e1napur has a vernacular school.\n\nKhata'v.\n\nKhata'v village, eight miles north-west of Vaduj the sub-divisional head-quarters, gives its name to the Khat\u00e1v sub-division and had in 1881 a population of 2710 or 262 less than in 1872. Under the Mar\u00e1tha government (1760-1818) Khat\u00e1v was the chief town in the pargana called after it, which corresponded pretty closely to the present sub-division. The town is walled and has two gates at the east and west ends of its market street, with two or three large mansions belonging to families of importance under the Mar\u00e1tha rule.\nKhat\u00e1v has a post office, a civil court established since the introduction of the Relief Act, a native library, and a vernacular school.\n\nTo the north-west of the town in an open space is an old Hem\u00e1dpanti temple of Mah\u00e1dev, now almost entirely deserted. It consists of an image chamber and vestibule (17' \u00d7 15') shaped in the old cruciform plan. The image chamber is square inside and contains a linga. East of the image chamber is the hall open only at the front, and the side walls are four feet thick at the centre from which they narrow to the front and back. The same style of wall is found at Parli in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and M\u00e1lhuli in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur. In front is an open space thirteen feet broad, partly blocked by a balustrade three feet high and four feet broad. In addition to the side walls the roof is supported on sixteen pillars eight of which on the sides are embedded in the walls, and eight in the centre are free. The pillars are of the usual type, a shaft of a single block cut into different courses, rectangular basement, and the rest cylindrical octagonal or again rectangular with a capital consisting of a bracket branching in four directions. In the centre of the mandap is a round slab on which the Nandi usually rests. The compartment formed by its four pillars has a well-carved roof slightly domed. The others are of the lozenge pattern, three rows of slabs disposed one on the top of the other so as to form three concentric squares the diagonals of the upper touching the centre of the side of the lower square. The front of the balustrade is most beautifully carved in a sort of rail pattern as at Parli, M\u00e1lhuli, and other Hem\u00e1dpanti temples. The whole structure is of large blocks of unmortared stone. The roof above is flat and has traces of a spire apparently pyramidal. The usual broad eaves remain but they are probably restorations as the slabs are small and mortar is used. Close to the north of this is a small canopy of still larger blocks of stone and containing a M\u00e1ru. About fifty yards west is a modern Mah\u00e1dev temple (60' \u00d7 20') with a brick spire and image chamber and a long stone mandap. It is surrounded by rude cloisters lining a court yard (100' \u00d7 50'). A fair is held at the temple in July-August or Shr\u00e1van. In the town itself, in a street branching from about the centre of the chief street which runs north and south is another old temple of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan restored almost beyond recognition. There is also about a quarter of a mile north of the town a Musalm\u00e1n idga or place of prayer, and a family of K\u00e1zis still live in Khat\u00e1v. The earliest mention of Khat\u00e1v is in 1429 when the Durg\u00e1devi famine having laid waste the country and the chief places of strength having fallen into the hands of local chiefs, Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r the Bahmani governor of Daulatabad with the hereditary officers or deshmukhs went through the country restoring order, and their first operations were directed against some R\u00e1moshis in Khat\u00e1v Desh.\u00b9 When (1688-1689) the Moghals invaded the country, Krishnar\u00e1v Khat\u00e1vkar was actively assisting them and was made by them a leading Deshmukh.\u00b2\n\nKh\u00e1tgun in Khat\u00e1v is a small village on the right bank of the Yerla eleven miles north of Vaduj. It has an irrigation bungalow and not far from the village is the weir whence start the two original\n\n\u00b9 Grant, Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 26,\n\u00b2 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 178 note, 192.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nKh\u00e1tgun.\n\nYerla canals now connected with the Nher storage tank.\\(^1\\) In the south-west corner of the village is the shrine of a Musalm\u00e1n saint or *pir*, a small mosque but with an inner chamber much like a Hindu shrine or *g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra*, which contains the tomb of the saint. The saint lived and died at Vadgaon thirteen miles south-west of Vaduj and a hybrid mosque temple at Khat\u00e1v was built in his honour by his Hindu disciple. A fair in honour of the saint is held at Kh\u00e1tgun in March when about 15,000 Musalm\u00e1ns Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and lower castes attend.\n\nKikli.\n\nKikli a small village twelve miles south-east of W\u00e1i and about three miles east of the junction of the Poona and W\u00e1i-Panchvad roads is remarkable for a group of ancient temples. The village is about a mile west of the Chandan Vandan forts and is easily reached on foot or on horseback from Panchvad a favourite camp on the Poona mail road three miles west. The temples are situated in an enclosure about 120 feet square. Two are in complete ruins, the one razed to its foundations and the other a mere heap of stones. The third is evidently built largely from the stones of the second on the plan of the first. It faces east and consists of an outer hall or *mandap* eighteen feet square, flat roofed and open at the sides, leading by a door in the west into an inner hall twenty-three feet square. This hall leads into three shrines each six feet square in the north-west and south. Thus the plan of the whole temple is cruciform. Each of the shrines is connected with the inner hall by a vestibule and while the inside is square, on the outside the courses of masonry overlap each other so that the plan of each shrine is also cruciform. There is no sign of any ancient spire or tower. The roof outside has lately been sloped with mortar and brick and mounted with a small urn or *kalas*. The *mandaps* are supported each by sixteen pillars in four rows of four each. The central four form a large square of twelve feet in the inner *mandap* and of ten feet in the outer leaving side passages \\(5\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet wide respectively. The walls of the inner *mandap* and shrines are here less than four feet thick and the height from ten to twelve feet. The outer *mandap* has in place of walls the usual balustrade forming the back of a stone bench. There is nothing remarkable in the decoration of the outer *mandap*. The pillars are of the usual Hindu type in plainly dressed rectangular cylindrical and octagonal courses. An exception is one of the four central pillars which is carved like those of the inner *mandap*. The decoration of the inner *mandap* is elaborate. The four centre pillars are elaborately carved in floral and arabesque patterns. The centre rectangular course is panelled with figures in relief representing on the two northern pillars the exploits of Krishna and on the southern those of M\u00e1ruti. The basements are supported by figures of satellites male and female. The portals of the shrine vestibules have a wainscoting of figures similarly sculptured in relief. The execution is in all cases superior to anything elsewhere to be found in the district. All this carving comes from the ruined temples. Each shrine contains a *ling* with a case or *sh\u00e1lunkha*, the northern also containing an\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Details of the Yerla canals and the Nher storage reservoir are given above p. 152.\nimage of Bhairav. In the centre square of the outer mandap is a mutilated stone Nandi or sacred bull. On the plinth in front of the outer shrine are a few almost unreadable letters said to be the words Shingandev Raja to whom the building of this temple is ascribed. To its north is the old and probably original temple exactly similar in plan and dimensions with the present one in which only three lings now remain. To its east is the other old temple whose walls remain but the roof has fallen in and the mandap is a shapeless heap of stones. In the south-west corner of the enclosure is an ancient well about twenty feet square and thirty deep but now choked up. All the images in the new temple including the Nandi have their noses broken off, it is said by the emperor Aurangzeb. The stones of the original temple are also said to have been taken to Wai by the Bijapur general Afzulkhan when leading the expedition which terminated in his murder by Shivaji. A small fair is held in honour of Bhairav on Dasara the bright tenth of Ashvin or September-October.\n\nKinhai seven miles almost due north of Koregaon is a village belonging to the Pant Pratinidhi. Kinhai is best reached from Koregaon by following the Pandharpur road for a mile and then taking a track which branches off due north and passes by Chinchli village on to a made road built by the Pant Pratinidhi. The village lies on either bank of a feeder of the Vasna which always holds water. The soil is good and the country round thickly studded with mangoes. To the north and north-west is a spur of steep hills at the end of which rises the ancient fort of Nandgiri (3537). On the south-east are two small hills divided by a gorge to the east of which is the temple of Yamnai Devi the patron goddess of the family. This temple has a fortified appearance and with its battlements and towers is visible for many miles on all sides throughout the Koregaon sub-division. The village consists of a broad street running north-west and south-east and crossing the stream into the Peth or market quarters and thence continuing to the road above mentioned up towards the temple and on through the small gorge between the two hills to Koregaon. The Pratinidhi has a handsome mansion or vada in the village, the lower part of stone and the upper part of brick with an enclosure or court surrounded by strong walls. The mansion contains some reception rooms of handsome size and proportions in the native style. Usually one of the wives and a son of the Pratinidhi reside here. The village has also a vernacular school. On the right bank of the stream behind the Pant\u2019s mansion is a small temple of Mahadev about thirty feet by fifteen with a flight of steps leading down to the stream. It consists of an open sided mandap and an image-chamber with a spire. The pillars are imitations of the early Hindu style. The spire is of brick with stone ornamentation. The temple of Yamnai Devi lies on the summit of a somewhat pointed hill about 350 to 400 feet above the plain. The way up to it is by the road before mentioned which close to the gorge is left on the right for a flight of 300 steps with a stone balustrade on each side. The steps are made of slabs quarried from the surrounding rock and are in excellent repair. Numbers of people may be seen ascending and descending the steps on Tuesday and\nFriday, the holy days of the goddess. The temple court irregular and nearly oval is entered from the west by a pointed archway with a music chamber or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na on the top. The rock is fenced with a solid masonry wall about twelve feet high from inside, and outside in places from thirty to forty feet high. At the eastern end is a small entrance from a path communicating with a spring half-way down the south slope of the hill. There are cloisters with a terrace on the left or south side of this entrance and on the north a large solid but plain lamp pillar or dipm\u00e1d. The pillar was broken a few years ago by lightning and as this is said to be the third time of its being struck, it is thought ominous to repair it. The temple is a plain structure about forty feet by twenty with a flat roofed hall or mandap supported on three rows of four pillars about eighteen inches square at the base and plain imitations of the early Hindu style. The image-chamber or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra is square and contains an image of devi in black stone ornamented with jewels and embroidered apparel and displayed to Europeans with much pomp by means of a mirror casting light upon it from outside. The courtyard is paved and immediately in front of the mandap is a stone embedded in the pavement and containing vents made to receive coins to be laid in them for presentation to the goddess.\n\nThe Pratinidhi family are hereditary kulkarnis or accountants of Kinhai and several of the neighbouring villages and it was from that position that Parshuram Trimbak raised himself till he was appointed the third Pratinidhi in 1700, since which time the office has remained hereditary in his family.\n\nKole in the V\u00e1ng valley about eight miles west-south-west of Kar\u00e1d is a village of 1953 people lining both banks of a stream which joins the V\u00e1ng at its northern end. The village was originally the head-quarters of a petty division or mah\u00e1l comprising the V\u00e1ng valley and the starting point of much of the carrying trade over the Mala pass by Dhebev\u00e1di. It is now nothing more than an agricultural village with a few well-to-do traders. A large fair attended by about five thousand people is held on the bright fifth of M\u00e1gh (January-February) in honour of a Hindu ascetic named Ghadge Bova a devotee of Vithoba who flourished about three generations ago. His disciple Kushraba has built a small temple in honour of the god which is much resorted to by people from the surrounding villages.\n\nKoregaon, north latitude 17\u00b0 42\u2032 and east longitude 74\u00b0 12\u2032, is the head-quarters of the Koregaon sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 2730 or 124 more than in 1872. The village has a large street passing east and west and another passing north and south. In the latter are situated the sub-divisional revenue and police offices in a mansion or v\u00e1da utilised for the purpose, and the vernacular school in an excellent building with a garden. The Pandharpur road runs east on the north side of the town and the Deur road from the other side of the stream on the west. At the same point joins in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road which crosses the Vasna by a good stone bridge about three-quarters of a mile south. The S\u00e1p road runs round the east of the town. Koregaon lies on a stream known as the...\nM\u00e1nganga which holds water throughout the year and forms the water-supply of the town. Its banks are well studded with mango and other trees. There is a good rest-house on the north of the Ind\u00e1pur road. A tolerable camp is formed in the mangoes to the south of the town, but a much better one is an excellent grove on the left bank of the M\u00e1nganga about a mile up the stream and north of Koregaon within the boundaries of the fertile village of Kumta.\n\nKundal is a village belonging to the Pant Pratinidhi but with two others adjoining it is almost surrounded by British territory belonging to the V\u00e1lva Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur and T\u00e1sgaon sub-divisions. It lies about five miles north of V\u00e1lva, about a mile from the end of the long spur which shoots off from the Mah\u00e1dev range thirty miles north at Mol in Khat\u00e1v, and will have a station on the West Deccan Railway about twenty-two miles south-east of Kar\u00e1d. The village is said to be the same as Kaundanyapur mentioned in Pur\u00e1nic legends and to have been the residence of R\u00e1ja Hingand\u00e9v, probably the same as the Devgiri Y\u00e1dav king Singhan I. (1179) or Singhan II. (1209-1247). The walls of the town are in fair repair, but show no signs of great age. The chief object of interest about the village is a set of Br\u00e1hmanical caves in the spur above mentioned. The face of the spur is generally north-east and south-west, but at the end it is splayed into two branches which form a widemouthed crescent facing east. In the southern arm of this crescent facing north-east is the chief set of thirteen caves and on the south face are three more. The first thirteen are all in a ledge of the hill about three hundred feet above the plain. Of these the first five face approximately north, the next three north-east, and the remaining five due east. They are approached by a flight of steps leading up through an archway six feet broad and deep, fourteen feet high, and girt by side walls nine feet wide. Two hundred and fifteen paces further on is the second gateway twenty-two feet broad, sixteen feet high and six feet deep, and crowned by a music chamber or nag\u00e1r-kh\u00e1na eighteen feet long, eight feet high, and sixteen feet broad. Eighteen steps further on is the third gateway nearly on a level with the caves. This gateway is twenty-four feet wide, ten feet high, and five feet deep. This leads on to a paved terrace built upon the rock and supported by a solid masonry wall about fifteen feet high following the line of the crescent. About twenty-six feet further on is a large hall supported on twenty-four pillars in four parallel rows making three aisles. The pillars are of brick, one foot in diameter and eight feet high. Except in the aisle formed by the third and fourth rows to the southward, where it is vaulted, the roof is flat. A door from this hall leads into what now must be termed the chief cave (30' \u00d7 20' \u00d7 8') a temple of Virbhadra a demon produced by Mah\u00e1dev. The entrance is only by a small rock-cut door two feet wide. The chamber inside is eight feet square and six feet high and is walled in. On each side of the centre door is another small door leading to the holy circuit or pradakshina which is 14' to the back of the cave, 19' 6\" across leaving a passage six feet wide behind the image, 14' 6\" wide on the east and 7' wide on the west. In the centre of the image chamber is a three feet high image\nof Virbhadra. It is of white stone apparently rough trap. In the right hand is a sword and in the left a bow. In the west wall of the hall is a very small door leading into the second cave (20' \u00d7 11' \u00d7 7') which is dedicated to the goddess D\u00e1lima. Immediately in front of it is a small built temple of Mah\u00e1dev 12' square and 8' high. To the east of the Virbhadra cave are two tanks about six feet square with water leading into one another. East of the tank is cave V. (14' \u00d7 10' \u00d7 6') with a small opening. To the west of the D\u00e1lima temple is cave VI. (16' \u00d7 9' \u00d7 7') best known as the cooking cave; close by it is cave VII. (16' \u00d7 11' \u00d7 7') next which is cave VIII. (24' \u00d7 18' \u00d7 8') known as the kacheri or court. These three caves are in the angle of the crescent, face north-east, and are entered each by separate small doors. Next it and facing north is cave IX. a small excavation containing two small tanks full of water and adjoining these is the washing or sn\u00e1n cave X. (13' \u00d7 8' \u00d7 7'). North of it is cave XI. known as the bhand\u00e1rghar or dining cave (27' \u00d7 21' \u00d7 6') a double hall with three pillars and a tank adjoining it. The next two caves XII. (12' \u00d7 7' \u00d7 6') and XIII. (14' \u00d7 13' \u00d7 6') are devoted to no special purpose. All the caves seem to have been cut out with the chisel and none of them seem natural excavations. The rock inside is soft and of dark brown colour. The outside walls and partitions dividing caves from tanks are very thin and crumbling away. The hall gateways and terraces as also the temple of Mah\u00e1dev are all modern. Except perhaps that of D\u00e1lima the images do not look old. The hall and chief gateway were made by one Basappa Limpne a V\u00e1ni of Kundal about 1870 at a cost of \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000). A fair attended by about one thousand people is held on the no-moon of K\u00e1rtik or October-November. The three caves on the south can be reached by following the ledge round the east end of the cliff for about half a mile. On turning the corner a small terrace is reached in which is one of the caves. From the plain only the small door of one of the caves can be seen about three hundred feet up the hill. It is reached direct by a very steep path the last thirty feet cut into steps leading on to a terrace very lately built. The more easterly of the two caves is entered by a small door about four feet high by two wide. It is twenty feet by sixteen and seven high and has at the back an open recess (7' \u00d7 6' \u00d7 7'). In the back are figures of R\u00e1m Sit\u00e1b\u00e1i and Lakshman rudely sculptured in relief. R\u00e1m is six feet high and Sit\u00e1b\u00e1i and Lakshman on each side of him are each four feet high. Parallel with the recess is a small tank sunk in the floor and off the rest of the cave is a small cell six feet square. It is about four feet higher than the main cave and communicates with it by a small door and some steps. The western cave about ten paces distant is a cell with a temple and measures twenty-five feet by twelve wide. Inside it is built a small modern hall resting on seventeen pillars six of them attached to the walls. This inner hall measures thirteen feet by ten by six high and has a roof four feet lower than the cave roof. The remaining space on the west of this hall is a cell with a tank at the north-west end. At the back of\n\n---\n\n1 Six feet given as the height of both the caves are average heights as the roofs slope a good deal.\nthe hall are images of Shiv with P\u00e1rvati and Ganga one on each side, each about 3' high by 2' wide, also very rudely sculptured in relief. In this set the eastern caves are Vaishnav and the western Shaiv.\n\nKusrud, a small village about six miles due south of P\u00e1tan, has near it a curious cave temple. The cave is on the north slope of a hill spur about a quarter of a mile south of the village and three hundred feet above the plain. A red spot in the slope marks its existence and a scramble up shows it to be a natural cave about fifty feet long and thirty-eight deep with a stream from the hill top pouring over the edge of the rock. The cave contains a large stone image of Ganpati painted red and about four feet high and four feet wide. Behind it on a crescent is a row of rude life-size sculptures made of mud and cowdung. The figures are of men and women and are represented standing in various attitudes. Some of the men have the large headdresses given to kings and gods in the old representations and the women have wooden bangles on their wrists and the arms above the elbow. A passage about five feet wide behind the row of figures leads to a chamber about ten feet square in which is a Mah\u00e1dev ling. There is another chamber at the north-west corner of the large cave. These chambers are hewn out of the rock, but the large cave is natural. The Ganpati sculptures are probably not very old. The execution is fair in some but the people of the place ascribe them an untold antiquity. To guard against their being injured by wild animals the front of the cave has been blocked up within the last twenty years by a mud and stone wall about ten feet from the edge of the cave thus having a veranda formed by the overshadowing rock.\n\nLoh\u00e1re. See W\u00e1i.\n\nMachhindragad, the most southern of the chain hill forts built in 1676 by Shiv\u00e1ji, is a solitary round-topped hill ten miles south-east of Kar\u00e1d. The hill lies close to the west of the Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon road which runs through the gorge dividing the fort hill from the main range which stretches from Mol in Khat\u00e1v to Kundal in T\u00e1sgaon. The fort has few features of interest. The ascent is by a steep but well kept path on the north from a hamlet lying close under the hill side. The hill is about 800 feet above the plain and the ascent which is by sharp zigzags occupies about twenty minutes. The last third of the ascent is by steps cut in the rock. The top is waving and surrounded by walls but with scarcely any scarp. The walls are of loose small dry stone about eight to twelve feet high on the outside and six inside and about six feet thick at the foot with a two feet parapet. The entrance is by a rough-pointed arched gateway now broken down. There are remains of a few buildings, and on the south is a small temple of Machhindran\u00e1th. A devotee of this god came from the village of K\u00e1le five miles south of Kar\u00e1d about 1830 and revived the worship of the god. His descendants still reside on the hill and attend to the temple. Near the temple are several tombs of ascetics and sati monuments with stone facsimiles of hand and foot prints. On the north about fifty yards south-west of the gate is a large pit.\n\n1 Compare Dr. Burgess' Lists, 59.\nor tank dug out of the rock which generally holds dirty water. It was made at the same time as the fort. There is another spring on the south which is used by the Gosav\u00eds living on the hill and by the people chiefly from the neighbouring village who frequent a yearly fair. The path up is kept in repair for this fair and the approaches to the temple on the top are lined with trees also planted and maintained out of the fair receipts. The fort was garrisoned by the Pratinidhi till it was taken by B\u00e1pu Gokhale about 1810. It was then managed by Gokhale for the Peshwa till May 1818 when it was surrendered without resistance to a British force under Colonel Hewitt. Machhindragad will have a station on the West Deccan railway twelve miles south-east of Kar\u00e1d Road the station for Kar\u00e1d.\n\nMah\u00e1baleshvar, 17\u00b0 51\u2032 north latitude and 73\u00b0 30\u2032 east longitude, in J\u00e1vli about eighteen miles north-west of Medha, twenty miles west of W\u00e1i, and about thirty-three miles north-west of Sat\u00e1ra, is the chief sanitarium of the Bombay Presidency situated on one of the Sahy\u00e1dri spurs. The height averages 4500 feet above the sea, and at Sindola ridge the highest point reaches 4710. Several spurs standing out from the north and west of the main body of the hill form promontories that command magnificent views of the precipitous slopes of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills and of the valleys below. At the heads of the ravines that run between these points the streams, issuing from springs in the higher part of the hill, fall over ledges of trap rock in cascades, one of which is about 2000 feet from the lip of the fall to the bottom of the valley.\n\nExcept in the east and extreme north the top of the hill is wooded to the very edge of the scarp, and though only in a few sheltered glades are there trees of any great size, the wood is so dense that it forms one vast waving stretch of rich foliage, broken by the chimneys and roofs of the higher houses, and by the varieties of shade from the olive leaf of the p\u00edsa to the blue-green of the jambhul and other fruit-bearing trees. The deep-cut roads and paths, bordered by a thick undergrowth of bracken and shaded by moss-covered trees, are like the views in a highland hill side. But the resemblance ceases with the sudden ending of road and shade at one of the numerous points that overlook the ravines, perhaps 2000 feet deep, bounded on the opposite side by the steep bare wall of one of the flat-topped Deccan ridges or by the low castellated outline of a Mar\u00e1tha hill fort.\n\nThe hills to the south-west differ considerably from those to the south and east. To the south-west the outlines are bolder and irregular and their sides are fairly clothed with trees and brushwood. To the south and east with a lighter rainfall the sides are utterly bare, and the forms, worn only by the sun and rain, are flat-topped and monotonous. The pressure of population on the\n\n---\n\n1 See above page 207.\n2 Contributed by Dr. McConaghy, formerly Superintendent of Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Besides by the name Mah\u00e1baleshvar or the Very Mighty God, which it takes from a famous temple of Shiv of that name, the station is called Nahar by the lower classes.\narable land has driven tillage up the sides of some of the less precipitous hills, where the wearing of the soil can be stopped by low terraces resting on stone walls, which lend somewhat of a Rhenish or Italian character to the view. In clear air before or after rain, often parts, and in rare cases, the whole of a fifty miles range of sea, shows extending from about the Sh\u00e1stri in Ratn\u00e1giri to a little south of Janjira. But the coast line cannot be traced except near the S\u00e1vitri river. The distance to the sea along this range of view varies as the river from thirty to fifty miles.\n\nThe beauties of the hill vary much at different seasons. Most persons probably think it at its best in October immediately after the cessation of the south-west monsoon. Many spots are then carpeted with wild flowers. The wild arrowroot lily fills every glade and in numberless spots are found wild rose and sweet pea. The ferns of which there are seventeen varieties are then in leaf. The less frequented paths and open spots are soft with turf. Every bank and stone, the rugged cliffs of the hills themselves, are dazzlingly green with moss and grass. The streams are at the fullest. A fall of rain of tropical violence probably occurs and the Yenna falls become imposing, while the faces of the cliffs are lighted with innumerable silver rills and dazzling sprays. At this time are to be seen the most distant views. The hills stand out against the sky in wonderful relief. In the mornings the ravines are filled with fleecy rolls of mist or with a wealth of dark blue shadow. In the evenings great clouds gather and impart endless variety of light and shade to the landscape and of glorious colour to the rays of the setting sun. Few lights are more majestic than that of the great thunderstorm of this season sweeping the adjacent valleys or over the distant sea. The breezes though strong are sweet and the bracing cold of the evenings is met with a cheerful fire.\n\nBut the favourite season for visiting is from March to June. The reason of course is the escape thereby afforded from the heat of the plains. But the grass wild flowers and ferns are now gone and the streams and waterfalls are dry. Haze obstructs the view and the eye is fatigued by glare. Still then too the hill has its peculiar beauties. The evergreen forests are renewing their foliage and impart a fresh verdure to the landscape. There is the tawny bracken not unlovely and the mighty heights of the Gh\u00e1ts are perhaps more imposing than when delicately clothed as in October at many of their most rugged portions.\n\nTowards the end of May the mists begin to creep up and thunderstorms lay the dust and cool the air. Few scenes are more fairy-like than the valleys on a May morning filled with mist, the fragments of which as it rises gild and throw into relief the finest of the surrounding peaks. At this time too the strawberry is in full fruit and the gardens are brilliant with heliotrope, geranium and fuchsias, and roses, where cared for, do well.\n\nAt all times the hill is most attractive, and not its least attractions are the excellent drives as well as walks which give access to all its parts. In this it contrasts happily with most hill stations, Ootacamund always excepted.\nThe station, called Malcolm Peth after Sir John Malcolm, includes all lands within a radius of five miles from the Frere Hall. Most of this land is reserved for forest and is called the Five Mile Reserve. It includes the lands of sixty-five villages, fifty-six from the Javli and nine from the Wai sub-divisions of Satara. These villages are usually from four to twenty huts surrounded by a few fields. Each village has a certain amount of land set apart for tillage and grazing, the rest being covered with thick evergreen forest.\n\nMahabaleshwar is reached by three chief roads, the Poona road from the east branching off from the Poona-Satara road at Surul, the Satara and Kelghar road from the south-east, and the Fitz-Gerald pass road from the west. In travelling to Mahabaleshwar from Surul the Poona road begins to rise almost immediately after leaving Wai and climbs along the north face of a steep and barren range of hills almost as far as Panchgani, a distance of about eight miles. Frequent turns open fine views of the upper Krishna valley and of the hills that face Mahabaleshwar, which are nearly as barren as those up which the road winds. One or two points give a glimpse of the peaks of Torna (4605) and Rajgad (3992), and, at the highest point of one steep rise, the wood-encircled temple and village of Mahabaleshwar is seen, but again lost when the curve of the road turns to the south-west. Except along the banks of the Krishna and its tributaries there is little vegetation. The sides of the hills are terraced in a few places for the growth of coarse grain, but the rest is utterly bare.\n\nAt the top of this ascent the little settlement of Panchgani breaks pleasantly on the view with its long lines of casuarina trees and bamboos in which are bedded a number of substantial little houses and a market. Until Panchgani is passed there is no view to the south or south-east, but about a mile further the road to Mahabaleshwar strikes along the edge of a deep valley that opens on the southern plains with Yavteshwar and the Satara fort (3307) in the background. The hills round Panchgani are flat-topped and, except close to the station, untilled. In the valleys below, the streams, so long as they keep running, are used to water small patches of wheat or vegetables, but the bulk of the crops, consisting of rice or nachni, is harvested soon after the end of the rains and only stubble is left to mark the patches of tillage. A little beyond Panchgani the road rises with several ups and downs to Mahabaleshwar, passing along the tableland which forms the top of this spur of the Mahabaleshwar system of hills. About half-way between the two stations signs of a heavy rainfall appear in the richness of the bracken and other ferns and in the numbers of bulbous plants which flourish nowhere but near the western crest of the Sahyadris. The valley of the Yenna is soon reached, along the north-eastern side of which the road is carried to the embankment of the lake immediately below the station. The Yenna falls are not visible though the rocks near them can be made out. Unlike the Panchgani spur the south-western side of the valley up which the road to Satara winds is clothed with scrub jungle. The gardens, begun by the Chinese convicts and continued by local workmen whom they have taught, are seen on both banks of the upper Yenna, on the south-west of\nwhich close to Mah\u00e1baleshvar, the view is bounded by the ridge of Sindola the highest point of the hill. From the lake the road winds round one or two small valleys to the Frere Hall, from which all distances are calculated.\n\nFor those who have time a better route is from Bombay by the FitzGerald pass with travellers' bungalows at Pol\u00e1dpur and D\u00e1sgaon in Kol\u00e1ba, and at V\u00e1da at the foot of the FitzGerald pass. Coasting steamers touch B\u00e1nkot at the mouth of the S\u00e1vitri and from B\u00e1nkot small steamers or boats ply twenty-four miles up to D\u00e1sgaon. Leaving Pol\u00e1dpur eighteen miles from D\u00e1sgaon, the line goes by the old Kineshvar road for five and a half miles. It then branches to the left, gradually climbing round the western and northern shoulders of Prat\u00e1pgad for sixteen miles to the V\u00e1da bungalow on the first plateau. From V\u00e1da the road winds ten miles more, round the valleys between Bombay and Sidney Points, and passing close under Bombay Point, rises easily from the east of it into the Bombay Point road by the Terraces. The scenery along this route is very fine, but it is very dusty below the hill in the hot weather.\n\nThe geology of the hills is simple, trap overlaid by a light capping of iron clay. The trap shows in most ravines and in horizontal belts on the sides of the hill, which are more numerous and much less deep than the trap scarps in the range further north. The Mah\u00e1baleshvar trap is often columnar and accompanied by crystallised quartz, apophyllite, stillbite, and scolecite found in cavities. The iron clay contains a variable proportion of peroxide of iron which used to be extracted by a class of men called Dhavads. But recent orders restricting the use of charcoal have put a stop to the manufacture of iron. The laterite ends on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road 6\u00bd miles from the Frere Hall, on the Poona road 13\u00bd miles, and on the Mah\u00e1d road 2\u00bd miles.\n\nAs the laterite capping is nowhere very thick, the substratum of water-bearing trap is soon reached, and a well sunk to a moderate depth, say from thirty to fifty feet, will yield a certain supply of water. In this respect the station presents a most favourable contrast to M\u00e1ther\u00e1n. A lake, with an area of about twenty-eight acres and an average depth of ten feet, made by the late R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and fed by perennial springs, not only adds to the beauty of the hill-top, but both directly and indirectly aids in watering a line of small gardens that stretch to a considerable distance below. It helps directly by means of a stream that issues from the lake and ultimately grows into the Yenna river; and it helps indirectly by raising the general spring level in the gardens, so that a sufficient supply of water can be drawn from a shallow dip well, by means of a bucket and bamboo pole weighted with a large stone and worked by a single labourer. The little streams that flow from the upper parts of the hill into the larger streams are, so long as they last, used in cultivation by means of artificial water-courses. The drinking water is generally excellent.\n\nFrom early October to June the climate is bracing and healthy, suiting most constitutions except those suffering from such chronic complaints as liver or heart disease. Some rain usually falls in October and the place is a little damp and the evenings misty; the\naverage mean temperature is 66\u00b78\u00b0. In November December and January the climate is dry with occasionally strong easterly winds cold enough to make a fire in the evenings almost necessary; the average mean temperature of these months is 63\u00b74\u00b0. From February the temperature gradually rises to a mean of 67\u00b0, and the cold season ends about the middle of the month. The hottest time of the year is generally from about the 12th of March to the middle of April, when, during the day, the temperature rises to a little over 90\u00b0. About the 20th April the wind changes to the west, and cool, moist, and invigorating sea breezes set in and gather strength as the season passes. In May there are occasional showers and thunderstorms; the air grows moister and clouds and mist often fill the valleys. On most hot weather mornings the hill sides are covered with white clouds which completely veil the Konkan, but these disappear as the day advances. The rainy season usually begins early in June, but a number of visitors remain on the hill till the middle of the month. As the different houses are emptied the owners cover them round with rain screens made of kolamb and other grass so as to protect the walls against the heavy rains. Most of the dealers and hawkers leave the baz\u00e1r at the end of the season, but a number of V\u00e1nis and the poorer classes remain. They completely surround their houses with screens, leaving only a small opening on the side furthest from the prevailing wind. The V\u00e1nis carry on their trade to a limited extent as the Dhavads and others who inhabit the hill and surrounding villages are too poor to lay in sufficient supplies for the monsoon. During these months it is generally very cloudy and misty, and the rain, though not incessant, falls for the greater part of the time. It is usually heaviest in July, and twelve inches or more are occasionally registered in a day. Every spring becomes a torrent and much damage is done to roads and gardens.\n\nDuring the twenty-four years ending 1884 the rainfall varied from 167\u00b763 inches in 1877 to 374\u00b749 inches in 1882 and averaged 263\u00b782 inches.\u00b9\n\nWith abundant water and plentiful street sweepings and other manure gardening is carried on with great success. English vegetables are grown along the banks of the Yenna and other streams, where there are also beds of strawberries and other fruit. The excessive rainfall prevents the cultivation of most European fruit trees, though they flourish at P\u00e1nchgani about ten miles east. Potatoes are largely grown and highly esteemed in the Poona and Bombay markets. In a sheltered locality, three miles from the\n\n\u00b9 The rainfall details are:\n\nMah\u00e1baleshvar Rainfall, 1861-1884.\n\n| Year | Inches |\n|------|--------|\n| 1861 | 316    |\n| 1862 | 243    |\n| 1863 | 254    |\n| 1864 | 261    |\n| 1865 | 265    |\n| 1866 | 279    |\n| 1867 | 215    |\n| 1868 | 189    |\n| 1869 | 175    |\n| 1870 | 175    |\n| 1871 | 171    |\n| 1872 | 187    |\n| 1873 | 271    |\n| 1874 | 235    |\n| 1875 | 187    |\n| 1876 | 260    |\n| 1877 | 202    |\n| 1878 | 268    |\n| 1879 | 278    |\n| 1880 | 240    |\n| 1881 | 240    |\n| 1882 | 243    |\n| 1883 | 243    |\n| 1884 | 255    |\n\n| Year | Inches |\n|------|--------|\n| 1861 | 316    |\n| 1862 | 243    |\n| 1863 | 254    |\n| 1864 | 261    |\n| 1865 | 265    |\n| 1866 | 279    |\n| 1867 | 215    |\n| 1868 | 189    |\n| 1869 | 175    |\n| 1870 | 175    |\n| 1871 | 171    |\n| 1872 | 187    |\n| 1873 | 271    |\n| 1874 | 235    |\n| 1875 | 187    |\n| 1876 | 260    |\n| 1877 | 202    |\n| 1878 | 268    |\n| 1879 | 278    |\n| 1880 | 240    |\n| 1881 | 240    |\n| 1882 | 243    |\n| 1883 | 243    |\n| 1884 | 255    |\nstation, a coffee plantation has recently been started by a Goanese merchant and has already defrayed almost the whole of the outlay.\n\nAmong exotics may be mentioned a few oak trees, grown from acorns brought by the late Rev. J. Wilson, D.D. Though scarcely thoroughly acclimatised they have reached a considerable size. Two of the best are to be seen in Sindola property directly facing the bungalow. The field crops are chiefly wheat, n\u00e1chni or n\u00e1gli, s\u00e1va, vari, coarse rice, and a little barley. Sugarcane is found only in a few spots which have a plentiful supply of water. As a rule the crops are harvested in the early season, so that the cultivators, unable to occupy themselves with cold weather sowings, have to seek other means of subsistence during the rest of the year. Except near water-courses, the soil is barren, and, as a rule, yields scanty crops. The local grain is always poor and is seldom used by any but the growers and a few low class servants.\n\nThe principal birds are the bulbul, spurfowl, junglefowl, bird of paradise, blackbird, and golden oriel sometimes called the mango bird. A number of venomous snakes are found, of which the n\u00e1g (Naja tripudians), phursa (Echis carinata), ghonas, and many\u00e1r are the commonest. Phurs\u00e1s are found in great numbers, and though small are very poisonous. The destruction of venomous snakes is encouraged by a reward of 3d. (2 as.) for each cobra and 1\u00bdd. (1 a.) for each of the other sorts. Of the larger wild animals tigers, panthers, and leopards, and of the smaller, spotted and four-horned deer and hog, are occasionally seen on the hill and in the surrounding villages. S\u00e1mbar are also found, and a few years ago a bull bison was shot.\n\nAccording to the 1881 census, the permanent population of Malcolm Peth numbered 3248. The original inhabitants are Kolis, Kulv\u00e1dis or Kunbis, Dhangars, and Dhavads. These four tribes differ considerably in appearance and language. The Kolis are the most intelligent and are usually well made, with broad chests and strong muscular frames, but their expression is coarse and unprepossessing. Their usual employments are fishing and hunting. The Kulv\u00e1dis are also well developed physically and have a pleasanter expression. They devote their time to agricultural pursuits. The Dhangars are milder tempered and less muscular and hardy than the Kulv\u00e1dis; their occupation is that of herdsmen; they do not keep sheep or goats, as they cannot stand the heavy rains of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hills. It is considered a disgrace in a Dhangar to own no cattle, but two are sufficient to entitle him to respect and to enable him to marry. The Dhangars have a belief that when buffaloes scent a tiger or panther they range themselves in a circle round their keeper. The Dhavads or iron-smelters are supposed to have come from Kar\u00e1d in S\u00e1tar\u00e1 nearly three-quarters of a century ago. They are a hardy race, distinguished from the other tribes by their high cheek bones, beard, large lips, and small eyes; their principal occupation until lately was iron-smelting. Besides a\n\n---\n\n1 A list of the principal Mah\u00e1baleshvar plants is given in Appendix B.\nnumber who live in Malcolm Peth they inhabit four hamlets in the forest.\n\nThe home speech of the first three castes is Marathi with a rather peculiar pronunciation difficult to be understood by other classes. The language of the Dhavads is Marathi with a large admixture of Hindustani. The huts of all the tribes are built generally on an uniform plan with thatched roofs and a framework of rough wood, the walls being invariably formed of karvi stems in the usual wattle and daub fashion. The Kolis and Kulvadis build on the level plateaus close to springs; the Dhangars and Dhavads are less particular, provided water is near. Both classes are to a great extent nomadic in their habits and squat whenever they can get food for their cattle. The dress of the men of all the castes is much alike and usually scanty, consisting of a waistband, a waistcloth, and occasionally a turban. The Kolis and Dhavads are fond of intoxicating drinks. The first three profess the Hindu religion and all have their gram-devta or village deity, as well as their tutelary god or goddess, both of whom are faithfully adored. They have also van-devtas or wood deities which are equally sacred in their eyes, together with numerous other minor spirits. They have temple servants, who take the offerings made to the gods as their perquisites, and a set of men known as Devrushis or mediums in whom they have extraordinary faith, as they are supposed to reveal the wishes of the gods, and are consequently held in universal esteem and referred to on all occasions of sickness or other misfortune. The household gods are kept on a raised shrine and are worshipped with devotion. The castes do not intermarry though they will associate and eat together, provided the food is prepared by a member of a higher tribe; they are believed to live to an old age and have sometimes large families. The religion of the Dhavads is a mixture of Hinduism and Muhammadanism. All eat mutton and game when they can get them, but their usual diet is such coarse hill grains as n\u00e1chni, vari, s\u00e1va, and occasionally butter, with forest roots and fruits, the chief of which are the jambhul, toran, harvand, and phanas or jack.\n\nThe demarcation in 1853 of the forest of the Five Mile Ring has caused considerable change in the habits of the population. The demarcation was made on the following principles: The lower part of the valleys lying below the hills were marked off for cultivation. All the upper ground in the villages, except spots allotted for cultivation by the superintendent, were kept as forest. Formerly the whole hill side was subject to cultivation in some form or other of the wood-ash system. The effect of the demarcation was to restrict all cultivation to one-third of the whole area. The average of cultivated land was reduced to two and a half acres a head and of this one-seventh of an acre only was rice or irrigated land. This meant that the greater part of the population would have a severe struggle for existence had they to subsist on cultivation alone. But owing to special means of livelihood the condition of the\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C. S.\npopulation round Mah\u00e1baleshvar is certainly no worse than any other group of Gh\u00e1t villages. The public works in and about Malcolm Peth give employment every year to numbers of labourers, while coolies for miscellaneous work are constantly wanted and handsomely paid. The demand for forest products is a still better source of profit. The demand for grass both as food for cattle and for thatching houses is always great, so also for firewood. Bamboos, fruits such as jack, mangoes, karvand berries, and miscellaneous articles such as honeycombs, ferns, orchids and moss, all find a market, and the prices paid are so good that the attraction is felt well beyond the Five Mile Radius. All these products may be gathered free except bamboos for which the forest department charge a nominal fee. There can be no doubt that the harvest thus reaped makes up for the deficiency of land for cultivation. But the change in 1853 certainly caused considerable hardship to a population then purely agricultural until the development of the station provided a substitute for their previous means of livelihood. This substitute namely manual labour while more precarious demanded more continuous and severe exertion than agriculture. It involved a loss of social position carrying with it feelings of degradation only to be removed in process of time. In the forest demarcation and settlement recently sanctioned by Government the area to be finally included in forest was fixed at 4339 acres or 64 per cent of the whole. All their former privileges as regards forest products were allowed to the villagers.\n\nAbout three years after the station was started, a jail was established for Chinese and Malay convicts, as it was found that the climate of Poona and Th\u00e1na was injurious to their health. The jail, which was constructed to contain about 120 prisoners, is thus described by Dr. Winchester in 1830: The jail is built in a quadrangular form with an inner paved court. The front or entrance side contains rooms for the guard of sepoys, offices for the jail authorities, and two rooms used as solitary cells, or as places for prisoners when too sick to walk to hospital or requiring quiet and separate attendance; the other three sides of the jail are composed of long, lofty, and very airy apartments entered only from the inner quadrangle. Two of these sides were generally occupied by the prisoners, while the third was used as a store and work-room. The jail stood on the ground at present occupied by the Engineer\u2019s store. From the reports of different Superintendents it appears that the prisoners, though convicted of such grave crimes as murder piracy and robbery, were quiet and amenable to discipline. Each convict received a daily ration of $2\\frac{1}{2}d.$ ($1\\frac{1}{2}as.$). During working hours, from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., they were required to work for Government. With few exceptions they were shut up at six in the evening, though lights were allowed till eight or nine o\u2019clock, and during this time the majority of the prisoners occupied themselves in different kinds of in-door work. During their leisure hours they were allowed to visit the bazar and get provisions. A number availed themselves of this liberty to plant potatoes and other English vegetables in the adjoining fields which could be easily irrigated, and they were allowed to enjoy the profit derived from their sale. A few convicts\nof good character were occasionally allowed the privilege of working all day in their potato fields and of sleeping in them during the night; on condition that substitutes were provided for the Government work; the privilege was seldom abused. The principal labour in which the prisoners were employed was the construction of station roads. They were also frequently employed in preparing arrowroot for the Commissariat Department; as much as 3500 pounds were supplied in one cold season. The Chinese greatly improved the station gardens, and it is owing in great measure to their industry that potatoes and English vegetables have been so great a success. They also taught the inhabitants to make cane baskets and chairs.\n\nWhen the jail was abolished in 1864 the majority of the prisoners obtained tickets-of-leave, and some of these were permitted to remain on the hill on condition of presenting themselves on the first of every month at the Superintendent's office. Misconduct renders them liable to forfeit their liberty and be sent to the Poona jail. At present there are only four Chinamen on the hill; one of these has a good garden near the lake which yields a large supply of vegetables.\n\nThe village of Malcolm Peth covers an area of 2111\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) acres of which 2006\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) acres are unarable and 105\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) acres arable. Of the unarable land 1204 acres are forest and 793 acres house sites; and of the arable land sixty-two acres are tilled, twenty-three are waste, and about twenty acres private or in\u00e1m. The cultivated land is chiefly in the north and south, close to watercourses, and the banks of the Yenna and T\u00e1mb rivers. Ten acres and four-fortieths are a permanent endowment to the Mah\u00e1baleshvar temple, and seven acres and six-fortieths were assigned for Bhav\u00e1ni of Pr\u00e1t\u00e1pgad, the tutelary goddess of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra family. Both of these pay one-fourth of the full rental. The rest is land held for obsolete services no longer required. When the village of Malcolm Peth was started a large tract of land was obtained for village purposes from the proprietors of Talemetha, Haroshi, and Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Land was similarly obtained from the Government villages of Sindola and Birv\u00e1di. The levy of assessment according to survey rates is restricted to arable ground which realizes an annual revenue of \u00a319 (Rs. 190); the land under occupation of bungalows is subjected to special rates of assessment which vary from 2s. to 10s. (Rs. 1 - 5) the acre. Leases are granted for twenty-one years. Since 1882 an uniform rate of 10s. (Rs. 5) the acre has been charged by Government on all properties whose leases have been renewed. The revenue for 1882-83, including the Local Fund sixteenth, amounted to about \u00a3174 (Rs. 1740), a considerable reduction compared with the returns of some years back. The fall is due to the conversion of leaschold into freehold properties, and to the exemption of Bella Vista from land rent, as, since 1877, it has become Government property. The forest area, about 1204 acres, known as the Five Mile Reserve, is chiefly covered with brushwood. In 1883-84, exclusive of hirda, it yielded a revenue of \u00a3290 (Rs. 2900). The revenue from cultivated land and from the forests is credited to Government, and the ground rent from buildings is credited as a state grant to the station funds.\nThe discoverer and first visitor of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hills, for change of climate, was the late General P. Lodwick, who, being stationed with his regiment at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra during the hot season of 1824, determined on exploring these mountains. He was the very first European who ever set foot on the since celebrated promontory of Sidney Point, which has now been officially called after him. He made his way, with a walking stick in hand, through the dense and tigerish forest, to the edge of that grand precipice, without any encounter with the wild beasts that then infested the place in numbers; but a day or two after his dog, when close to him, was carried off by a panther. He was also the first to bring the subject before the public through the medium of newspapers. He was followed by the late General Briggs, Resident of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, who in 1826 built a cottage and prevailed on the R\u00e1ja to construct an excellent carriage road from his capital to the present station. Little further was done till Sir J. Malcolm, Governor of Bombay (1827-1830), zealously took up the matter, established an experimental convalescent hospital for European soldiers, and, by his personal residence at the hills in the hot season of 1828, attracted a crowd of visitors. In the same season Colonel Robertson, the successor of General Briggs, built a house at the station. In November 1828, Sir J. Malcolm returned to the hills, bringing with him Dr. Williamson specially appointed to the duty of reporting on the climate and fitness of the locality for a sanitarium. Sites were now selected for some public buildings; the Governor's residence on Mount Charlotte, called after Lady Malcolm, was commenced; and a proclamation was soon afterwards issued by the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, inviting settlers to his newly founded village of Malcolm Peth or 'Malcolm-Ville'. His Highness also undertook to continue the high road onward over the hill and down the Radtondy or Rotunda pass to the boundary of the British territory in the Konkan, from which point the English Government agreed to construct a similar road down the P\u00e1r pass through Mah\u00e1d to D\u00e1sgaon in Kol\u00e1ba, the most convenient harbour on the S\u00e1vitri or B\u00e1nkot river. These works were completed in 1830. Next season P\u00e1rsi shopkeepers made their appearance, and Government employed a number of Chinese convicts in cultivating an extensive garden whence supplies of the finest vegetables, especially potatoes, were speedily drawn. The convicts, about twelve in number, came from the English settlements to the East and after working out their time in chains remained at the place, married, and improved their condition, with the proverbial frugality and industry of their race. A public subscription was raised to make bridle roads to the most picturesque points, and in a few years the station reached the flourishing condition in which it now is. Mah\u00e1baleshvar was ceded in 1828 by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja in exchange for the village of Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 in W\u00e1i, and in 1848 was incorporated in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra collectorate on the lapse of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra state to the British Government.\n\nFrom 1827 to 1866 the management of the station was carried on by a committee. During this time it was chiefly maintained\n\n---\n\n1 Murray's Bombay Handbook (2nd Edition), 198-199.\nfrom imperial revenues which constituted the station fund. In January 1865, to raise a revenue for the improvement of the station, a municipality was organised, and in May 1866 its limits were extended to include the whole of the station. The committee was dissolved in April 1867, and the management transferred to a town municipality. The income is limited, and Government still continue to contribute from the public revenues. In 1883-84 the revenue amounted to \u00a31399 (Rs. 13,990) of which \u00a31038 (Rs. 10,380) were derived from Government grants and \u00a3361 (Rs. 3610) were from municipal receipts. The expenditure in the same year chiefly on establishment and public works was \u00a31160 (Rs. 11,600). The Post Office is open throughout the year, and the telegraph office from 1st October to 15th June. The station has a good vernacular school at which teaching is conducted up to the fourth standard. The municipality does not contribute towards its support.\n\nThe baz\u00e1r or general market is in a central position on a waving slope that stretches from the high ground on which the church stands, with a gradual descent towards the south, thus affording a good natural drainage. The area of the baz\u00e1r is twenty-three acres and 1075 yards, and the population varies from about 1400 during the rains to between 2500 and 3000 in the hot months. The baz\u00e1r contains a considerable number of shops where supplies of every description can be obtained at reasonable prices, a number of itinerant hawkers from Poona, Bombay, and elsewhere visiting the station during the season with a variety of goods. The shopkeepers are Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, K\u00e1m\u00e1this originally from Telingan, Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis who form the bulk of the trading class, Goanese, P\u00e1rsis, and Bohor\u00e1s. Several of these deal exclusively in potatoes honey and wax which form the staple trade of the place and are sent in large quantities to Poona and Bombay. Mah\u00e1baleshvar honey is in great repute and from \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1000 - 1500) worth of it is sold in the baz\u00e1r every year. It is gathered from the Sahy\u00e1dri forests chiefly by Kolis. The shops are arranged on either side of the main road. In the centre of the baz\u00e1r is the vegetable market, which in 1880 was thoroughly repaired and roofed with iron. It consists of seventeen compartments which are annually rented and afford sufficient accommodation for the sale of vegetables. The mutton and beef markets are removed some distance from the main street and are ample for the requirements of the station. There are two stands or add\u00e1s at convenient places to the south and west of the baz\u00e1r where imported grain, building materials, and sundry other commodities are daily exposed for sale. On the extreme west is the Government firewood store, where the Forest Department retails firewood collected from the reserves. Here also are the mail contractor\u2019s stables where carriages and pony carts are generally available. The Roman Catholic Chapel, Native Library, and School are on the same side. The dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1, constructed by Mr. Fr\u00e1mji Nasarw\u00e1n\u00edji Patel of Bombay, is on the eastern side, and the Chinamen\u2019s burial ground is towards the south. The houses in the back streets on the southern side are generally the dwellings of traders and working people; those of the Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and other menial classes are on the extreme south. Dhavads,\nCh\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs or shoemakers, and Buruds or basket-makers, chiefly live on the same side but a little to the north; Br\u00e1hmans, Kunbis, and Muhammadans live in the centre. In a few retired spots are Hindu temples dedicated to Shiv, Ganpati, M\u00e1ruti, and Vithoba; they are supported by private gifts without any help from Government. There is a mosque on the north. Firewood is cheap and grass plentiful, the best grass coming from P\u00e1nchgani. Timber and building materials are easily procured, and the principal working classes are well represented. The baz\u00e1r is conveniently situated as regards drainage, but the houses are rather close to each other, and to prevent overcrowding all applications for vacant sites in the immediate vicinity are disallowed. The Malcolm Peth market draws its chief supplies of native fruit from D\u00e1poli, W\u00e1i, and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. During the greater part of the year, potatoes, which are extensively grown, form the chief food of the working classes.\n\nThe public buildings are the Frere Hall, sanitarium, church, hospital, rest-house, and Government bungalows. The Frere Hall, built in 1864, contains a large reading room and library with a large and well chosen supply of books. It is a great acquisition to the station. The sanitarium is an excellent building, originally built by Government but transferred to the station in 1861. It contains eight sets of good well ventilated rooms, furnished for the accommodation of bachelors. In 1882 an excellent club house was built on the debenture principle on the ground lying between the Frere Hall and the sanitarium, and with the sanction of Government the management of both these institutions was handed over to the club committee on condition that the general public whether members of the club or not should still have access to the Frere Hall and library on payment of the usual subscription and that sick officers going to the hill should still obtain accommodation to a limited extent in the club chambers (old sanitarium) on payment of the regulated fees. For the use of the sanitarium the club pays the station Rs. 800 a year, this amount being the average yearly income derived by the station from the sanitarium for the five years previous to the opening of the club. The eight rooms forming the old sanitarium being insufficient to meet the requirements of the members of the club, six additional bedrooms have been erected on the rising ground between the Frere Hall and the Post Office. In 1879 an excellent permanent badminton shed containing four courts was constructed near the Frere Hall and has proved, especially during inclement weather, a source of great enjoyment to visitors. This badminton shed and lawn tennis courts at Sassoon Point have now become the property of the club, and thus all public amusements are regulated by the club committee. The church called Christ Church, 91 feet long from east to west and 37\u00bd feet broad from north to south, is built on rising ground a little to the north of the baz\u00e1r. It was consecrated by Bishop Carr in 1842, but was almost completely rebuilt in 1867. It contains 210 sittings and is in charge of the chaplain of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, who makes Mah\u00e1baleshvar his head-quarters during the hot season of the year.\u00b9 About sixty\n\n\u00b9 Dr. J. Davidson, Superintendent of Mah\u00e1baleshvar.\nyards to the west of the church is the Beckwith monument 4558 feet above sea level and reached by a bad stony path. It is a plain obelisk about thirty feet high and was erected from public subscription at a cost of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000). Sir Sidney Beckwith died here in 1831 while commander-in-chief. The subscribers put up an inscription and Lady Beckwith sent out another on a marble tablet. The influence of weather on marble rendered the second inscription almost illegible as early as 1843; the first inscription remains comparatively uninjured though the writing is much obliterated and blackened and can only be read with the greatest difficulty. For several years the monument has been regarded as sacred by the poorer classes, who resort to it for the purpose of obtaining answers to prayers. The first inscription on the west face runs:\n\n\"**Sacred to the Memory of Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Sidney Beckwith, K.C.B., Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bombay, and Colonel of His Majesty's Rifle Brigade; who, after a long course of distinguished service, expired at his Residence on these Hills, on the 15th day of January 1831, aged 60 years.\n\nErected by a small circle of his friends in testimony of their admiration for his noble character, and to perpetuate the memory of so good and amiable a man.\"**\n\nThe other inscription on the east face runs:\n\n\"This Tablet is placed by Mary, Lady Beckwith, daughter of the late Sir William Douglas, of Kilhead, Bart., as a memorial of the most devoted affection for her lamented husband, by whose sudden death she has been deprived of a most attached partner and friend and guide, in whom was combined every amiable quality by which the Christian character is adorned, and the intercourse of domestic life is endeared\u2014a loss which can only be alleviated by the hope that looks beyond the grave. The sympathizing friends who erected this monument have kindly permitted a sorrowing widow to add her heartfelt tribute to theirs.\"\n\nAbout 700 yards south-east of the obelisk on the left of the road leading to Lodwick Point is the cemetery canopied with the shade of many trees. It is well kept and contains several notable monuments.\n\nThere are about a hundred bungalows on the hill within a radius of about three or four miles. Almost all are occupied in the hot season. The majority have thatched roofs, but as, owing to the excessive rainfall, the thatch has to be renewed every two years, iron roofing is becoming more common, as it can be maintained in good repair at a trifling expense. The cost of building these houses varied from \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) to \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000). Their number has increased from seven in 1840 to forty-eight in 1860 and ninety-eight in 1884. Of the ninety-eight in 1884 eight were Government and the rest private. Of the ninety private bungalows thirty-four are owned by Europeans, eighteen by Hindus, twenty-two by Parsis,\n\n---\n\n1 Here are buried Lieutenant Hinde of the 4th Dragoons who was killed on these hills by a bison on the 19th of April 1834; Dr. James Fraser Heddle some time master of the Mint at Bombay, a man of great scientific acquirements, and founder of the Bombay Geographical Society; Captain Thomas John Newbold of the 23rd Regiment Madras Army, Assistant Resident at Haidarabad, who died May 29th, 1850. A pillar supporting an urn on a very large base is the monument of Major William Miller, Judge Advocate General of the Bombay Army. Murray's Bombay Handbook, 201.\nten by Musalm\u00e1ns, and the remaining six by Jews and others. For the cold season, that is from October to the middle of February, the highest rent is \u00a330 (Rs. 300) and the lowest \u00a312 (Rs. 120). If the bungalows are hired at this time by the month the rent varies from \u00a33 to \u00a315 (Rs. 30 - 150). In the hot season, from the first of March to the rains, they are not let by the month, the highest rent for this period being \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500) and the lowest \u00a325 (Rs. 250). In the cold season the number of visitors is comparatively small, chiefly Europeans and a few rich natives. As a rule in the hot season all the houses are occupied, the greater number of visitors being Europeans. Of the materials used in building these houses the teak came from Bombay, Ratn\u00e1giri, Poona, and K\u00e1nara, other timber from the neighbouring districts, the lime from W\u00e1i in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and the corrugated iron from Bombay. The properties on the hill are generally held on lease; in a few cases the Government rent has been redeemed. The roads, which extend to about forty miles, are nearly all metalled and kept in thorough repair.\n\nThe principal points are Arthur\u2019s Seat (4421), Elphinstone (4184), Sidney or Lodwick (4067), Bombay, Carnac, Falkland, Sassoon, and Babington (4245) on the Konkan face and Kate\u2019s on the Deccan face.\n\nElphinstone Point is a seven-mile drive from Frere Hall. Two miles more lead to Arthur\u2019s Seat. The cliffs at these points are higher than at any of the nearer eminences. These rise from the Konkan which is some two thousand five hundred feet below the level of the Koyna valley. The ravine between Elphinstone Point and Arthur\u2019s Seat is the rise of the S\u00e1vitra river, and the height of the cliff at the point where the stream reaches its base is not less probably than 3000 feet. There is a small bungalow at Elphinstone Point but without furniture or special accommodation for visitors. The road which passes the Mah\u00e1baleshvar temple is passable for light vehicles, but is unbridged and abounds in steep inclines and sharp curves. From Elphinstone Point to Arthur\u2019s Seat it runs close to the edge of the cliffs from which a small stone parapet only divides it. Great care should be taken in driving this portion. Arthur\u2019s Seat, so called after Mr. Arthur Malet who first built a house here, is the highest point of the range in the neighbourhood, being 4421 feet above sea level. The view is of immense extent in all directions. North-west over a ridge about five hundred feet lower is seen the Jor valley dense with forest and concealing the head waters of the Krishna. R\u00e1jgad (3992) and Torna (4605) in the Bhor state, and K\u00e1ngori (2457) in Kol\u00e1ba are all visible from this point. During the hot weather the haze usually obstructs the view, but in October and November these and other hills in the Bhor territory are seen to fine advantage. They form masses of huge rocks rugged beyond description and apparently unscalable. In most places the vegetation has been cleared or burnt off them. This adds to the wildness of the scene. But notwithstanding its grandeur the eye would gladly find some relief from the universal bareness, and turns with enjoyment to the masses of foliage on the\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\nsouthern side. About half a mile from Arthur's Seat itself is a small path, which, by a scramble, leads down to a spring 200 feet below called the Wishing Well. The path follows the line of the cliffs and mounting up meets the carriage road at the little cleared spot which constitutes Arthur's Seat. A very steep and rather unsafe path over the eminence enables a good climber to get down to a small ledge known as the window. It is about 200 feet below the Seat and once reached gives a magnificent view of the extraordinary drop on into the valley below. The ledge is so low that the visitor can lean over it and gaze securely into the depths below without endangering his balance by straining in any way. Another circuitous path starts northwards from the Seat and is a safer way of reaching the window. Beyond the window a long spur projects into the Konkan, and by the path above mentioned the people habitually pass the range, sometimes even with heavy burdens. Considerable time is usually necessary for seeing Elphinstone Point and Arthur's Seat. The best plan is to send out provisions and make a long morning of it.\n\nThe way to Sidney or Lodwick Point, which is nearly three miles north-west of the bazar, is to follow the Mahad road and take the second turning to the right. One more turning is met and the right hand should again be chosen. The road, though steep, is well adapted for carriages. It follows the northern slope of the spur through dense though small forest and opens on to a space at the base of a sort of promontory two hundred yards long. The carriage way extends to the top of a rise in the promontory on which the Lodwick monument has been placed. Beyond this again is the extreme end of the Point known as the Nose 4067 feet above sea level. This must be reached on foot, as it is connected with the rest of the spur by a narrow ridge not more than five or six feet wide with a deep drop on each side. This should be crossed with caution. The nose or end of the point is only twelve feet wide and the sides have a drop of over 2500 feet to the Koyna valley below. Many persons consider Sidney Point the most beautiful on the hill. The view is less extensive on either side than from several other points. But Pratapgad and Elphinstone point crags are seen thence in their very best. There is a fine rebent of prospect north-west over the Konkan, while the height and ruggedness of the surrounding hills is nowhere more fully brought home to the mind than from this almost isolated rock rearing its colossal height between two deep ravines crowned with rugged cliffs.\n\nSidney or Lodwick Point was formerly called Sidney after Sir Sidney Beckwith. A few years ago, by order of Government, the name was changed to Lodwick Point, in honour of General Lodwick who was the first English officer that climbed the hill. By permission of Government a column has lately been erected on the point by General Lodwick's son. The column is about twenty-five feet high from the ground to the top of the urn which surmounts the pillar. On the west of the base of the monument is the head of the General, sculptured in alto-relievo in white marble, protected by stout tin wire in an iron frame. The iron has rusted and stained the face, which is scratched but not disfigured. On the south side is written:\nS\u00c1T\u00c1RA.\n\n\"In memory of\nGeneral Peter Lodwick,\nSecond son of John Lodwick, Esq., S. Shoebury, Essex,\nwho entered the Hon. E. I Co.'s service in 1799,\nand died at Bagn\u00e8res de Bigorre, France,\nAugust 28th, 1873,\naged 90.\nSenior Officer of H. M.'s Forces in India\n\nOn the east side is written:\nIn 1803-04, he saw service as a Subaltern in connection with the operations of the Army under Sir Arthur Wellesley. He was Brigade Major of Captain Ford's Subsidiary Force at the Battle of Kirkee, November 5th, 1817, when 2800 British Troops defeated the Peishwa's Army, and was present at the taking of Purandhar and other hill forts. He commanded a Regiment at Kittur in 1824; he subsequently became Town Major of Bombay; and closed his career in India as Resident of Sa'ta'ras.\n\nThe first European who set foot on these hills, he made known the salubrity of the climate, and led to the establishment of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar Sanitarium, thus conferring an inestimable benefit on the Bombay Presidency.\n\nOn the north side is written:\nThis Point, now by order of Government designated Lodwick Point in honour of his name, he reached alone in 1827, after hours of toil through the dense forest. Here, therefore, as the most appropriate spot this monument has, with the permission of Government, been erected by his only son, R. W. Lodwick, of Her Majesty's Bombay Civil Service, Accountant General of Madras, in 1874.\n\nBombay Point, so called apparently because of its being on the old road to Bombay, is one of the earliest known in Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The view from it is perhaps the most extensive on the hill. It comprehends on the right or north-west Prat\u00e1pgad and on the southwest the saddle-back and the set of hills between them, of the most varied and beautiful forms to be seen in the immediate neighbourhood. This also is the point from which to see the sunset over the sea. It is the most frequented rendezvous on the hill. A large space has been cleared for carriages and a platform made for a band. The point is reached by two roads. For both the Mah\u00e1d road must be followed for a full mile to a spot where three roads meet. The shorter way to the point is straight on. One portion is rather steep but the saving in distance is very great, and the gradients have lately been improved. The whole road from the turning runs through thick woods. The turn to the right is the longer road, which gives a much easier gradient but a mile more driving. The Mah\u00e1d road is followed for three quarters of a mile when a turn to the left leads to the point. Many fine glimpses of Sidney Point are obtained from this road.\n\nCarnac and Falkland Points called after the Governors of those names are within a quarter and half a mile respectively of Bombay point. The views are very similar. The saddle-back hill is seen to greater advantage from these two than from Bombay Point, but the sunset view is somewhat obstructed by the shoulder of Bombay Point itself. Falkland Point however has a large space for carriages and is a very favourable resort. The cliffs of Babington Point are exceedingly well viewed from this point. These heights while exceedingly abrupt are specially well clothed with vegetation. The lines of the mosses and passes are specially attractive in October.\n\nChapter XIV.\nPlaces.\nMah\u00e1baleshvar Points.\nLodwick Monument.\n\n1 Compare Lady Falkland's Chow Chow, I. 147.\nand in the cold weather the ravine is filled with the intense blue shadow characteristic of these hills.\n\nClosely adjoining Falkland Point is the glade, an open space cleared in the forest a charming specimen of the beautiful interiors of these small light woods. There is a direct road to Falkland point by the left hand turning of the three mentioned above. It is broad and drivable but very steep in parts, and not much used for carriages.\n\nSassoon Point about half-way on the road to Babington Point has the Lawn Tennis Courts of the station. There are now six of them well furnished and in good order.\n\nBabington Point is about two miles almost due south of the Frere Hall. The road is an excellent one. It passes through the bazar past Sassoon Point on the right and on for another half a mile by gentle gradients. The last half mile where it turns a little to the west is very steep and leads on the point a fine open space. This is the point of view for the Koyna valley and the saddle-back.\n\nKate's Point, unlike all the others, affords a view to the Deccan side. The hills here have less variety and grandeur. But the valley of the Krishna has beauties of its own in a winding river and patches of cultivation. Kamalgad P\u00e1ndugad and M\u00e1ndhardev, three fine heights, are prominent objects in the landscape. W\u00e1i unfortunately is shut out from view by a shoulder of the hill called T\u00e1\u00ed Gh\u00e1t. The road to the point has recently been made easily passable for light carriages. It turns off from the Poona high road about a mile and a half east of the lake and from here it is another mile and half to the point. It is a spur jutting out into the Krishna valley. At the extremity is a huge piece of rock a hundred feet high which appears to have become detached from the main scarp. A few smaller boulders wedged between this rock and the face of the cliff form a connecting link not more than six feet wide requiring steadiness to cross. The rock and scarp with the connecting boulders form a curious natural arch. The road to Kate's Point forms part of the old path to Malcolm Peth known as General Phayre's road. It follows the northern slope of P\u00e1nchgani from the village of Dahiy\u00e1t and emerges on the plateau about a mile east of Kate's Point. This path was at no time made passable for wheels and is now completely out of repair.\n\nThere are three chief waterfalls on and near the hill, the Yenna falls in the Yenna valley near Lingmalla, the Dhobis' fall almost midway between Lodwick Point and the bazar, and the Chinamen's fall near the gardens formerly cultivated by the Chinese ticket-of-leave men. These are well worth a visit, especially in the cold weather when the volume of water is considerable.\n\nThe Yenna falls are reached by two different routes. One is by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road which has to be followed for about 2\u00bd miles from the Frere Hall, when a mile more along a branch road to the left will lead to the falls. Carriages cannot approach within a quarter of a mile and the branch road is narrow and steep everywhere. A turn to the right about three quarters of a mile from\nthe road shows the path leading to the falls which are excellently viewed from several of its angles. The stream is here precipitated over the face of a steep cliff with a sheer descent of some 500 feet, unbroken when the torrent is swollen by rain, but ordinarily divided by projecting rocks, about one-third of the way down, and scattered below into thin white streaks and spray, which are often circled by rainbows from the oblique rays of the sun. A strong eddy of air created by the fall blows back on to the top the spray and light objects thrown over the fall. The headlong rush and roar of the falling river; the many other streams lining with silver the steep dark sides of the chasm, as they hasten to join the foaming torrent, which far below is dashing on through masses of rock; the grandeur of the scenery, now wreathed in floating mists now bright in sunshine, combine to form a scene of the most absorbing beauty.\u00b9\n\nBy means of an arduous scramble the very edge of the fall can be reached, though usually at the expense of a wetting. The forest bungalow of Lingmallia is close by. This bungalow and the falls can be reached by another carriage route along the Poonah road from which the road to the bungalow branches off to the right a few hundred yards east of the Kate's Point road.\n\nA most beautiful view of the Soihi valley can be obtained by passing from what is known as the Blue Valley road\u00b2 which connects Babington Point and the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road. The turn to the left from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road is about a mile and half distant from Frere Hall and cannot be mistaken. The road is passable for light carriages but careful driving is required.\n\nThe Dhobis' or washermen's waterfall is on a bridle path connecting the Sidney Point with the Elphinstone Point and the old Mah\u00e1baleshvar road. The fall is insignificant but situated in a lovely sequestered nook and looking straight at the south side of Elphinstone Point ravine. The rocks on either side are abrupt and lofty, while there is abundance of foliage and forest to add to the beauty of the scene.\n\nAn excellent round of the hill can be made on foot or horseback by starting along the Mah\u00e1baleshvar road taking the left turn to the Dhobis' waterfall and on to Sidney Point. Thence another bridle path starts south, known as From Dan to Bersheba. It crosses the Mah\u00e1d road and eventually reaches Bombay Point. From Bombay Point the carriage road is followed to Falkland Point, whence again the Tiger Path strikes off following the head of the Babington Point ravine and past the Chinamen's fall till Babington Point is reached. From Babington Point it passes by the Blue Valley road to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road. The distance covered will be about twelve miles and most of the best views will have been seen.\n\nIt should not be omitted to notice that the Albert road, a loop branching southwards from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road about half a mile from the Frere Hall and close to the pillar post, gives perhaps the finest panorama of the landscape west of Prat\u00e1pgad to be seen on the hill.\n\n\u00b9 Murray's Bombay Handbook, 199.\n\u00b2 The Blue Valley takes its name from the blue haze and shadow for which it is notable.\nIt includes the whole of the Blue Valley and the saddleback range as far as Prat\u00e1pgad.\n\nNear the Yenna falls at Lingmalla about three miles east of the baz\u00e1r is the site of a cinchona plantation. The land belongs to the temple of Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The portion taken for the plantation is on the right bank of the river about a quarter of a mile above the falls and contains about ninety-five acres. Before the formation of the plantation about two acres of the land had been bought by Government for \u00a385 (Rs. 850). The rest was obtained from the proprietor on a thirty years' lease renewable at the option of the lessee from the 1st of August 1865 to the 31st of July 1895. The terms of the lease were that \u00a330 (Rs. 300) should be paid annually in half-yearly instalments.\n\nTwo dams were built at a cost of \u00a3619 (Rs. 6190), one a short distance below the Yenna lake, the other across a stream nearer Lingmalla to direct the water towards the plantation. Owing to the scarcity of water in the hot season a channel from the Yenna lake to the plantation, a distance of more than two miles, was made in 1869 at a cost of upwards of \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000). As this did not supply sufficient water a further sanction for \u00a387 (Rs. 870) was obtained for a new dam. But this, though of ample elevation, did not answer, as, owing to the porous nature of the laterite, the water ceased to run in the end of January or the beginning of February.\n\nAn establishment at a monthly cost of \u00a356 (Rs. 560) was sanctioned in February 1865 on condition that all receipts should be credited to the general revenues. In April 1865 Government sanctioned an allowance of \u00a327 (Rs. 270) a month for the Assistant Superintendent and gardeners. In 1867 the establishment was increased and an additional sum of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) monthly was granted, and in 1868, in consideration of the zeal displayed by the Assistant Superintendent in the management of the plantation, an annual increase to his salary of \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25) monthly, till it reached a maximum of \u00a320 (Rs. 200), was sanctioned. When the plantation proved unremunerative, reductions took place from time to time, and when in 1875 it was transferred to the Forest Department the members of the establishment were dismissed and only a messenger was left in charge of the Superintendent's house.\n\nThe first attempts to raise cinchona from seed were unsuccessful. Subsequently about 20,000 young plants were brought from the Nilgiris and an experienced superintendent was appointed. The plants flourished for four years, then canker made its appearance and destroyed more than three-fourths of the plants, and a few years later scarcely a plant remained. When the plantation seemed likely to prove a failure, the Superintendent of the Nilgiri Cinchona Plantation was asked to visit Mah\u00e1baleshvar and report on the condition of the plants. He was of opinion that the project would never pay and attributed the decay of the plants to the long dry weather followed by excessive rain. The Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens at Ganesh Khind requested to be allowed to try precautions for the canker. A year was granted for his experiments but all failed. The project was abandoned in 1875 and the\nland made over to the Forest Department. A sum of \u00a36400 (Rs. 64,000) had been spent, and the return was nominal.\n\nThe places in the neighbourhood of the hill to which excursions are occasionally made are Prat\u00e1pgad, Makrandgad or Saddleback, P\u00e1rut, B\u00e1mnoli, Chanda, Kam\u00e1lgad, Shin Shin Gali or the Robbers' Caves, and the Mah\u00e1baleshvar temples.\n\nPrat\u00e1pgad, 3543 feet above sea level, is famous in Mar\u00e1tha history. Early in his career it was the seat of Shiv\u00e1ji the founder of the Mar\u00e1tha empire, and here in 1659 he treacherously murdered Afzul Kh\u00e1n the commander of the Bij\u00e1pur army. The fort was designed by Shiv\u00e1ji in 1656 and built by Moro Trimal Pingle. For many years it was a great Mar\u00e1tha stronghold, but is now a ruin. Inside is the temple of Bhav\u00e1ni, Shiv\u00e1ji's family goddess. The tomb, a short distance outside of the fort, marks the spot where Afzul Kh\u00e1n's head was buried. Prat\u00e1pgad has been made much easier of access by a good road which runs nearly the whole way, and a travellers' bungalow at V\u00e1da or Ambenali at the bottom of the pass where refreshments can be had and arrangements made for carrying those who find it difficult to climb the hill. The V\u00e1da bungalow is within forty minutes' walk of the fort. Fifteen villages, yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a3335 (Rs. 3350), have been granted for the maintenance of the temple of Bhav\u00e1ni.\n\nMakrandgad, perhaps the sweet or pleasant hill, and known to Europeans as the Saddleback, stands on the left of Prat\u00e1pgad in the village of Ghonaspur, about five miles south-west of Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The hill, which is sparsely covered with timber, is 4054 feet above sea level or 500 feet higher than Prat\u00e1pgad. It is unfortified and has on the top a good spring of water and the ruins of an old temple. The chief attraction is its wide view, which on a clear day includes much of the Konkan and a long stretch of sea coast. The paths up the hill are steep, and here and there narrow and bordered by precipices.\n\nP\u00e1rut in the Koyna Valley, five or six miles beyond Babington Point, is reached by an excellent footpath and has a good supply of pig, deer, peafowl, junglefowl, and spurfowl. About ten miles further at a place called B\u00e1mnoli, or at T\u00e1mbi five miles beyond, bear and s\u00e1mbar are found. In going to B\u00e1mnoli it is usual to drive to Medha and then ride over the hill about seven miles along a good bridle path. Arrangements should be made two or three days before.\n\nChanda, a small hill in the direction of Prat\u00e1pgad and about five miles from the baz\u00e1r, is occasionally visited by sportsmen. It is surrounded by a dense forest, which generally contains some of the larger wild animals.\n\nKam\u00e1lgad, a small hill north of Kate's Point on the opposite side of the Krishna valley, 4511 feet above sea level, can be reached either by a pony-cart or on horseback as far as Kate's Point and thence on foot. A good walker can reach the top of the hill in about two hours. Pig are generally plentiful in April and May, and small deer and spurfowl are abundant at all seasons. About twenty-\n\n---\n\n1 Details of Prat\u00e1pgad are given below under Prat\u00e1pgad.\n2 Details of Makrandgad are given below under Makrandgad.\nfive beaters are required. It is best to send some one who knows the place a day in advance to make ready booths or m\u00e1ndavas, and to find out from the villagers what game is about and where it is to be found.\n\nAnother place occasionally visited is Shin Shin Gali or the Robbers' Cave, about four miles south-east of the station. The best way to get to it is to ride or drive about a mile beyond Babington Point, taking the left hand road. After this a footpath, chiefly used by the Dhavads of M\u00e1lusre, leads to a rocky plain on one side of which is the cave. There are many stories about this cave. Some Hindus consider it an ancient abode of the giants, while others assert that it was made as a chapel by the Rishis or seers. Others again say that the cave is the work of Dhavads who dug it to get the laterite stones they used in making iron. The objection to this last story is that as laterite is found on the surface it is difficult to see what the Dhavads gained by mining. The length of the cave is about 150 feet, the mouth about ten feet wide and high enough for a man to enter without stooping. In the middle it becomes considerably lower. A few years ago the cave is said to have been a tunnel about 500 feet long. It is gradually being filled by clay left by the rainy season floods. The cave is seldom or never entered by the villagers, as the thick forest round is infested by wild animals which, no doubt, frequently resort to the cave. The natives call it Shin Shin Gali or the Shin Shin passage. What Shin Shin means is not known.\n\nAt the upper part of a small wooded ravine about midway between the Sindola range and the road leading to Kate's Point from the P\u00e1nchgani road is another Robbers' cave smaller than the above but better known and more often visited.\u00b9\n\nAbout Arthur's seat s\u00e1mbar are found during the greater part of the cold and hot seasons. Owing to the thick undergrowth, principally k\u00e1rvi, it is most difficult to beat them out. One hundred beaters are necessary, and even then the s\u00e1mbar often break back. Small deer and spurfowl are plentiful here as on most parts of the hill.\n\nDuring March and April there is some bush quail shooting about four miles from the station on the P\u00e1nchgani road and on the S\u00e1tara road from Lingmalla onwards.\n\nThe temple of Mah\u00e1baleshvar which gives its name to the station is situated 4385 feet above sea level in a small village two and a half miles north of the baz\u00e1r. Near the main temple of Mah\u00e1baleshvar are two other temples, one dedicated to Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1i or the river Krishna, and another to Atibaleshvar or Vishnu. Mah\u00e1baleshvar and Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1i are held in more esteem than Vishnu and their temples are more costly.\n\nThe temple of Mah\u00e1baleshvar is surrounded by a stone wall about five feet high. In the centre the temple, built of black trap and supported on stone pillars, consists of two apartments, a small inner room for the god and a larger outer room for the worshippers.\n\n\u00b9 Sir Bartle Frere probably refers to this cave in his introduction (p. x.) to Pandurang Hari who lays one of his scenes in such a cave.\nThe temple of Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed, which is also of trap, is larger than the temple of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and of a different shape. It consists of khans or arches on three sides with an open space in the centre, the whole somewhat resembling a theatre. The fourth or northern side is formed by a high stone wall, at the base of which, about three feet apart, are five holes out of which water flows; these are supposed to be the five rivers Krishna, Koyna, Yenna, G\u00e1yatri, and S\u00e1vitri, which, after running for about ten feet, unite and fall through the mouth of a carved stone cow into a cistern, and overflowing the cistern fill a second reservoir. The upper cistern is used for bathing by Hindus of the higher castes and the second by Hindus of the lower classes. There is no written information regarding the building and cost of these temples. But from local inquiries, it appears that they have been in existence from remote times, and that about 150 years ago they were rebuilt and thoroughly repaired by the wealthy S\u00e1t\u00e1ra banker Parshur\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Angal. Repairs at a cost of about \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000) were carried out in 1875, when a corrugated iron roof was placed over the temple of Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed by the Chief of Jamkhandi.\n\nThe village is regarded by Hindus as a tirth or sacred pool, and as all classes of Hindus come to it to perform religious rites the Br\u00e1hman priests and temple servants who form the bulk of the inhabitants enjoy a considerable revenue. The god Shiv has an endowment granted by the late R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, which is administered by an agent appointed for the purpose. Besides frequent gatherings on all religious festivals, yearly fairs are held in honour of the two chief deities, and are largely attended by all classes of Hindus.\n\nThe traditional origin of these temples is that two r\u00e1kshas or demon brothers named Mah\u00e1b\u00e1l and Atib\u00e1l, bitter enemies of the Br\u00e1hmans and their gods, were so powerful and warlike that they disturbed the devotions of the Br\u00e1hmans and harassed the people. The Br\u00e1hmans appealed to Vishnu who came and killed the younger brother Atib\u00e1l. Enraged at the death of his brother, Mah\u00e1b\u00e1l challenged the god to single combat. They fought so long that Vishnu became exhausted and sought the help of the goddess of enchantment. She cast a spell over the giant so that he ceased fighting and promised to grant any favour the god should ask of him. The favour asked by the god was the death of Mah\u00e1b\u00e1l. As Mah\u00e1b\u00e1l had pledged his word this favour had to be granted, and the gods began to cut the giant in pieces without his offering any resistance. Struck with admiration Shiv offered to fulfil any of his dying wishes. Several requests were made and granted, the chief being that Shiv and Vishnu should take the names of the giant and his brother, and that in memory of their fight their temples should be called Mah\u00e1baleshvar and Atibaleshvar.\n\nThere are three yearly festivals or utsavs at the temples, Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s and Navr\u00e1tra in honour of the river Krishna,\n\n---\n\n1 According to a local story Parshur\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Angal was a S\u00e1t\u00e1ra beggar who suddenly discovering a large treasure became a banker and spent his money in building temples, rest-houses, and wells in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. Lady Falkland\u2019s Chow Chow, II. 31. See below P\u00e1teshvar.\nand Shivr\u00e1tra in honour of Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed's fair begins on the first day of the bright half of Ph\u00e1lgun (February-March) and lasts for five days; the Navr\u00e1tra begins on the first day of the bright half of \u00c1shv\u00edn (September-October) and lasts for ten days; and Shivr\u00e1tra begins on the twelfth day of the dark half of M\u00e1gh (February-March) and lasts for seven days. To meet the cost of these fairs and to entertain daily about 500 Br\u00e1hmans, the sum of \u00a315 (Rs. 150) is sanctioned from the revenue of the endowed village of Kashri. The amount falls short of the outlay, and about \u00a320 (Rs. 200) are yearly collected by private contributions. The Navr\u00e1tra festival is of secondary importance, its festivities costing about \u00a37 (Rs. 70), which is wholly met by the proprietor. While these fairs last, from \u00a320 to \u00a330 (Rs. 200-300) are spent on the observance of such religious rites as prayojan, pur\u00e1n, and kirtan or katha. The amount sanctioned for the performance of these rites is about \u00a317 10s. (Rs. 175), and the excess is met from funds raised on the occasion.\n\nAt the Navr\u00e1tra there are scarcely any strangers. On the two other occasions from about 1000 to 1500 Br\u00e1hmans, Prabhus, V\u00e1n\u00edes, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Son\u00e1rs, Shimpis, and others gather from the neighbouring villages in the Javli and W\u00e1i sub-divisions of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and from the nearer villages of the Mah\u00e1d sub-division of Kol\u00e1ba. People from Poona and N\u00e1sik and from the more distant parts of the Deccan and of Northern India, especially Bair\u00e1g\u00eds and Fakirs, may also sometimes be seen. And occasionally P\u00e1rs\u00eds and Musalm\u00e1ns are attracted for the sake of amusement or from curiosity. Of these visitors those who live close at hand return the same evening, and those who dwell farther off remain till the close of the fair. These are accommodated either in Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed's shrine or in the houses of priests, most of whom hold papers from the ancestors of the pilgrims appointing them their hereditary religious guides. The only rites performed by the pilgrims are bathing in the sacred waters of the Panchganga and worshipping the principal images. Rich pilgrims sometimes give feasts and dinners to Br\u00e1hmans. The privilege of bathing in the sacred waters is not enjoyed by all. People of low caste are forbidden to touch the water in the holy pond. But the temple Kohis serve out water which they carry from the spot, and use it at some distance from the shrine. Except the petty shopkeepers and M\u00e1l\u00eds of Malcolm Peth few traders open stalls at these fairs. The articles offered for sale are of the commonest sort, glass bangles, earthen toys, dry dates, cocoanuts, potatoes, guavas, plantains, and other ordinary fruit, and raw sugar and sweetmeats. Their aggregate value is about \u00a324 (Rs. 240) and they are sold to the pilgrims for cash for immediate use.\n\nThese feasts and fairs are a source of profit to the temple priests and servants. The income depends chiefly on the number and position of the pilgrims and is in no case trifling. A Br\u00e1hman on an average can lay by from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a34 (Rs. 25-40), though\n\n---\n\n1 The amount originally estimated by the late R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra for the purpose was about \u00a34 6s. (Rs. 43); but the prices of provisions have since risen, and the original grant is inadequate.\nhe may often complain. The Guravs or ministers appropriate the money offered by the pilgrims to all the images except to Murlidhar in Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed's temple, whose offerings belong exclusively to Koli temple servants.\n\nBesides these presents and offerings the priests and temple servants receive yearly allotments in cash or in kind from the land assigned to the temples. The revenue of the villages of Kashri and G\u00e1nje, estimated at \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and paid chiefly in kind, goes wholly to the priests. The Guravs, in addition to their income from the yield of in\u00e1m land in Jor and J\u00e1vli, enjoy a yearly cash payment of \u00a32 (Rs. 20) and of two khandis and three mans of rice in husk from the proprietor. They have, besides, the privilege of using the articles of food supplied for the god by the in\u00e1md\u00e1r. Unlike either the priest or the Gurav the Koli has no land. He receives from the proprietor a yearly allowance of 4s. (Rs. 2) and of four khandis of rice in husk. The villages which were assigned by the late R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and continued by the British Government, yield a yearly revenue of from \u00a3110 to \u00a3120 (Rs. 1100 - 1200).\n\nMahimandangad in J\u00e1vli is a small fort on the top of a hill rising about 600 feet above the valley, and situated in the small village of Shindi eleven miles west of B\u00e1mnoli and close to the south of the \u00c1mboli pass bullock track. The fort is easy of ascent from Shindi. It is not more than about ten acres in extent and was but little used as it is commanded on all sides by other hills. Except some light broken down walls and a pond little of the fort remains.\n\nMahimangad Fort in M\u00e1n lies within the village limits of Shindi Budruk about five and a half miles west of Dahivadi. The easiest way to it is by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road to a point about half a mile west of the pass descending into the lower parts of the M\u00e1n sub-division. From this point a broad track branches off northwards to the fort which lies not more than half a mile from the road. There are three hamlets close on the north of the fort which towers about 250 feet above them. It consists of a flat nearly triangular table land with the apex to the east surmounting a perpendicular scarp of black trap below which are steep slopes of short grass with a little soil. The sides are overgrown in places with prickly pear especially on the north-west corner. The ascent should be made from the second hamlet which will be encountered on approaching the Pandharpur road from the north-west. A path about five feet\n\n---\n\n1 There were formerly about seventy-five families. About fifty have lately left. The income of those that remain must be considerable.\n2 There are twelve Gurav families dependent on the temple. The representative of each family worships the idols in turn, and enjoys during his time the right of using the food offered to the god.\n3 The produce of these lands was formerly worth about Rs. 82\u00bd. But as much of it has been included in the Five Mile Forest Reserve the income of the Guravs has greatly fallen off.\n4 The articles set apart as food for the god are for one day, rice one sher; wheat 1\u00bd shers; pulse \u00bc sher; split gram \u00bc sher; clarified butter, sugar, and molasses, each three takas; cocoa-kernel two takas; and other condiments and spices 2\u00bd shers. Besides these half an anna was allowed as a present or dakshina. The rice and other articles are cooked, the dishes are set before the image, and when the worship is over the food is eaten by the Gurav and his family.\nwide is still kept in good order with rude steps at intervals of almost every yard. A steep walk of about five minutes leads up to the gateway, the immediate approach to which is in places almost block- ed by prickly pear. The path which leads up the side in a south- east direction here takes a turn at nearly right angles to the south- west. But before entering the visitor will probably go some fifteen yards further to see a small tank cut in the rock, the site of an excellent spring always full of water and furnishing the neighbour- ing hamlets with their hot weather supply. The gateway has been cut in the scarp about thirty feet below the summit. The passage cut is about six feet wide but the gateway narrows to about five feet. It consisted as usual of a single pointed arch about seven feet high of well cut masonry the top of which has fallen in. Inside are twenty-two rock-cut steps which wind through a right angle and lead to the top facing east. The inner side of the curve is as usual protected and the way up the steps proportionately narrowed by a curtain of solid masonry. On emerging on the top and proceeding east along the north face of the fort on the right hand is a small hillock on which stood the office or kacheri now in ruins. A little further on is a water tank thirty feet square, originally built of well cut masonry, but now a great deal fallen in. Near it are two small tanks lined with cement for the storage either of grain or water, and to the south of these is a large pit rough hewn out of the rock, perhaps intended for prisoners as in Varugad. About fifty yards further east is a turret of considerable size the masonry of which is still solid and on which a gun was planted. This turret stretches right across the fort but underneath it on the southern side is an archway about four feet high by two broad. By creeping through it is reached the eastern end which tapers off nearly to a point. The fort is about a hundred yards long by forty wide. The walls are at present about five or six feet high and the masonry, except the top layer, is in fair preservation. At the east end is one, and at the west end are two bastions at the north-west and south-west angles. Originally all three were crowned with guns and there are still remains of parapets on them. On the east bastion is a small stone placed erect for a ling and worshipped as the image of the god Jajarnath Mahadev. A small fair is held in honour of the god and the existence of this shrine explains how the path up to the fort is in good order. There is also a ruined building of loose stones near the south-west bastion in honor of some Muhammadan saint or pir.\n\nMahimangad is expressly mentioned as one of the chain forts built by Shivaji to guard his eastern frontier. But some of the natives declare that the fort existed in Musalm\u00e1n times and point to the pir shrine as evidence. This shrine however proves nothing since there are many such unfortified hills. The masonry is characteristic of the later built forts of Maratha times consisting of small, almost or altogether, uncut stones bound together by mortar usually poor but, at the bastions and entrance, of good sound quality. On the same spur about a hundred yards east of the fort is a hill which barely com- mands it and is connected with it by a neck of the spur. The ham- lets at the foot are not walled or protected in any way so that the\napproach within 250 feet of the top must have been easy enough. To escalade it however must have been difficult though at the southeast corner by no means impossible. The hereditary garrison consisted of about seventy-five R\u00e1moshis and Mh\u00e1rs who hold the gadkari in\u00e1m lands. The fort had lands assigned for it. The hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r or former commander of the garrison is now the p\u00e1til and the sabnis or accountant is the kulkarni of the lands which are for purposes of administration as a distinct village called by the name of the fort.\n\nMa'huli, a small village of 1097 people in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, ten miles north of Vita with which it is joined by a local fund road, has a remarkable Hem\u00e1dpanti temple of Kadamba Devi. The temple is in the centre of the village, though not easy to find out. It is about forty feet long by about twenty broad and consists of a hall or mandap with a shrine and vestibule, but without a spire. It is built of gray trap on a mound about ten feet above the average level of the village streets. It is closely surrounded by mud houses and therefore seen to less advantage than many of these old temples which are usually found in vacant spaces and often outside the villages. It is raised on a stone plinth about three feet high, the face of which is cut in a lozenge pattern. The walls are different from the usual type of Hem\u00e1dpanti temples in the district being elaborately carved externally, especially the shrine wall. The hall or mandap is twenty feet square and the walls reach to the roof not as usual left solely for support to the pillars. The line of the front or east wall is straight and contains a square entrance. But it is in bad repair, the carved work nearly defaced and everywhere blocked up with mud and stones put in to prop it up. The side walls, which also contain two square entrances, are as usual rather wider at the centre, the outline slightly resembling the cruciform. The stones are pointed in beaded and tooth work and floral decorations are faintly carved on them. The vestibule to the shrine is about five feet by nineteen. The shrine is star-shaped and about fifteen feet by twenty at the widest part. At the west north and south sides are flat faces connected by zigzags showing five corners. These walls are carved in much the same way as the hall or mandap walls but far more elaborately. The faces contain niches with images of deities fairly well executed. The image in the north niche is Mahish\u00e1suri Devi riding on a buffalo and holding the child Parshu-r\u00e1m in her lap; the image on the west is of Narsinh the man-lion; and the image on the south is Ganpati and Shad\u00e1nan or K\u00e1rtikeya. The roof has heavy eaves of carved stone but scarcely projecting and a modern brick parapet. The hall or mandap inside has four pillars in the centre carved in the usual pattern. The shafts are of a single block and about seven feet high. The basement is square and the rest of the rock is cut into cylindrical square and other sections all carved in floral and beaded patterns. Under these four pillars is the round slab called rangshila for religious dancing and the like. Embedded in the walls are twelve other semi-detached pillars of the same pattern connected with the roof by crochets of a scroll pattern. The roof is divided by cross beams into nine compartments cut in the lozenge pattern. But the\nmost noteworthy thing in the interior is the sort of screen which divides the shrine or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra vestibule from the mandap. It is of pierced stone work very elaborately cut in lozenges of a sort of tooth pattern exceedingly elegant and striking. The shrine is a plain square chamber and contains nothing but two projecting slabs or stone symbols of Devi with the ling and sh\u00e1lunkha of Mah\u00e1dev in front. Though so small inside the carving of the temple is superior to anything in the district, except perhaps some at Shingu\u00e1pur and the old temple at Parli. The temple is said to have been built by a K\u00e1s\u00e1r or bangle-maker more than a thousand years ago. A branch of the K\u00e1s\u00e1r\u2019s family is said to reside at present in Kolh\u00e1pur without any connection with M\u00e1huli.\n\nM\u00e1huli, 17\u00b0 42' north latitude and 74\u00b0 6' east longitude, also called Sangam M\u00e1huli from its position at the meeting of the Krishna and the Yenna, is a holy town of 2916 people in great local note about three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The town is divided into two parts Kshetra M\u00e1huli in British territory on the east bank of the Krishna\\(^1\\) with 1630 people and Vasti M\u00e1huli on the west bank of the Krishna with 1286 people, the property of the Pant Pratinidhi by whose family most of the M\u00e1huli temples were built in the eighteenth century. These temples,\\(^2\\) which form the chief objects of interest at M\u00e1huli, are ten in number and are built almost on or about the river banks. Descending the river the first is the temple of R\u00e1dh\u00e1shankar on the east bank of the Krishna in the limits of Kshetra M\u00e1huli. The temple stands on the Giri Gh\u00e1t a long and handsome stone platform built by one B\u00e1pu Bhat Govind Bhat about 1780. The temple is built of basalt and consists of a shrine and a vestibule which may here be described as a veranda supported by three small horse-shoe scollopped arches. The dome is of brick and almost conical in shape. It is broken up into gradually lessening rows of stucco ornamentation in which are niches filled with images. On each side of the entrance is a lamp-pillar or dipm\u00e1l. The temple was built about 1825 by T\u00e1i Saheb Sachiv the great-grandmother of the present Pant Sachiv of Bhar.\n\nThe second, also on the east bank of the Krishna, is the temple of Bilveshvar built about 1742 by Shripratr\u00e1v Pant Pratinidhi. The temple consists of a vestibule (18' \u00d7 18' \u00d7 11') and a shrine (10'9\" \u00d7 10'6\" \u00d7 13'). The vestibule has no opening but a low door close to which is the Nandi. The roof is supported by a few pillars each of which is in alternate courses square round or octagonal. The front is plain and about thirty feet long. The sides gradually contract by a series of offsets which run up nearly to the top of the dome so that the back wall is only five or six feet long. Except the upper part of the dome which is of brick covered and ornamented with stucco, the temple is built of gray stone and bears a very solid appearance. Over the bull near the vestibule door is a square\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Krishna is crossed near M\u00e1huli by a flying bridge and the steep descent on its east bank is obviated by a good winding pavement or gh\u00e1t.\n\n\\(^2\\) The temple accounts are from the MSS. of the late Mr. E. H. Little, C.S., formerly First Assistant Collector, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Compare Chesson and Woodhall's Bombay Miscellany, I. 303-304.\nstone canopy apparently later than the temple and supported on each side by a broad low pointed arch. In front of the temple are a few tombs of ascetics and further beyond is the gh\u00e1t or winding pavement and flights of steps leading to the river built in 1738 by \u00c1nandr\u00e1v Bhivr\u00e1v Deshmukh Angapurkar. The third, also on the east bank of the Krishna but at some distance from the first two as also from M\u00e1lhuli village, is a large temple dedicated to R\u00e1meshvar and built about A.D. 1700 by Parshur\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Angal of Dehgaon. Looking at it from the opposite or west bank the chief objects of note are the very fine flights of thirty-five steps leading up to it from the river-bed. One flight with its broad platform was begun by the last Peshwa Bajir\u00e1v II. (1796-1817), but never finished. Though forming part of the whole structure, it would lead, if finished, rather to the side of the temple than to the temple itself. The other flight begins nearly where the first leaves off, and at an angle to it, and is said to be the work of Parshur\u00e1m Angal. Half-way up it on either side is a small cloister of two arches, which would be perfectly circular but for a small niche in the keystone. The roof is domed and formed by concentric layers of stone, each projecting over the one below and so diminishing in circumference till only a small hole is left enough to admit one stone. At the top of the steps are two lamp-pillars one on either side and on the right is a small shrine with a three-faced image of Datt\u00e1traya. In front is a bull with his face towards the door of the vestibule. He is very richly ornamented with chains and bells. Between his feet is a small ling overshadowed by the cobra with two worshipping women. The canopy is supported at the corners by pillars which are square and round or octagonal in alternative courses. Above is a low octagonal dome on two courses, the lower plain, the upper with a few figures. Above this again is a representation of the lotus, but the stucco has fallen off. The doorway consists of a stone porch supported on half pillars. The vestibule is very small and is entered by a low door. There are three domes, the lowest is over the vestibule, the next comes a little higher, and the third adjoining it is the highest. All the domes are of brick and stucco surmounted by a representation of the lotus. Behind the temple is a cloister of five arches. A small door leads into the shrine with five small figures in black basalt. The central figures are Shiv and P\u00e1rvati. At one end is an upright Hanum\u00e1n with hands clasped together.\n\nThe fourth temple of Sangameshvar Mah\u00e1dev is, as its name shows, close to the sangam or junction of the two rivers, on the west bank of the Krishna and the north bank of the Yenna and nearly opposite the Bilveshvar temple. From the bank of the Krishna, two flights of steps lead up to the courtyard wall in which is a small door opening into the quadrangular court in which lies the temple. It consists of a small open veranda with a roughly executed painting of Lakshmi and a vestibule and shrine. In front is the sacred bull under a canopy resting on four pillars. The breadth at the back is gradually diminished by a series of offsets which are carried up into the dome. The architecture is pure Hindu. The pillars are round or octagonal and square in alternate courses, and the roof is formed of long stones which\nstretch diagonally from pillar to pillar so as to form a series of lozenge or diamond-shaped spaces, filled in with square stones of less size. There are good flying buttresses to the platform of the sacred bull and the top of the dome. Like Bilveshvar the body of the building is of basalt and the dome of brick and stucco. It is said to have been built by Shripatrav Pant Pratinidhi about 1740. Just below this temple and at the actual junction of the rivers is a triangular plot of ground occupied by tombs built over the burial places of an ascetic named Banshapuri and his disciples. The largest, under which the ascetic himself is said to be buried, is an octagonal building of gray basalt, surmounted by a low dome. The sides are open, and the triangular heads of the openings are scolloped and richly carved above; a broad ledge is carried round supported on elegant scrolls. Inside is a ling and sacred bull. The next in size is square with a horse-shoe opening about six feet high and carved pilasters on each side. The dome is of brick plastered and fluted. Inside are a ling and bull. The third is a mere canopy with fluted dome and supported on square pillars over the ling and bull.\n\nThe fifth, the largest of the M\u00e4huli temples on the south bank of the Yenna at its meeting with the Krishna is dedicated to Vishveshvar Mah\u00e1dev and is said to have been built by Shripatrav Pant Pratinidhi about 1735. It is of basalt and enclosed by an irregular-shaped court-yard open on the river side, from which it is approached by a flight of steps. The high platform on which it is raised, the low colonnade which runs round the greater part of it, the short thick pillars in alternate courses of round octagonal and square, the lozenge-figured stone roof, the breadth increasing from the front by offsets and then decreasing in a similar way behind, all show that it is a building purely Hindu in architecture. The length from back to front is about fifty feet, and the breadth varies from twenty feet to five feet. The interior consists of a vestibule with images of Ganpati and Lakshmi and a marble shrine. The dome is of brick and stucco. The squareness of the form in this and other domes of this time contrasts with the round domes of a later period. Animals are carved in the capitals of the pillars and the cornices. The sacred bull is on the usual platform surmounted by a canopy and octagonal dome, the niches of which are filled with mythological figures, and are divided from each other by figures of men on elephants. On two sides of the court-yard are cloisters with broad low pointed arches and square pillars; they are either meant to serve for cooking purposes or are hostelries for visitors. On another side is a similar unfinished building with narrower and more pointed arches. At the entrance of the vestibule is a fine bell apparently with no writing but the date 1744 in English figures. The bell was probably taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from some Portuguese church in the Konkan after the capture of Bassein in 1739. At the back of the Vishveshvar temple and very inferior to it in every respect is a basalt temple of R\u00e1mchandra said to have been built in 1772 by Trimbak Vishvan\u00e1th Pethe usually called M\u00e1ma a distinguished general under the fourth Peshwa.\nM\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v (1761-1772) and the maternal uncle of Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v Bh\u00e1u. It is very small and consists merely of a veranda and a shrine with brass figures of R\u00e1m, Lakshman, and Sita. The wall behind them is panelled with broad low arches and painted with flowers. The dome consists of only two polygonal courses. There are five other small temples in M\u00e1lhuli. The temple of Vithoba was built by Jotipant Bh\u00e1gvat of Chinchner about A.D. 1730. It originally consisted of a small veranda with carved wooden pillars opening into the shrine by a low Muhammadan arch. A hall or vestibule with wooden pillars and door all round was added about 1860. The roof is hung with lamps. Bhairavdev\u2019s is a small temple consisting of a shrine and open vestibule or veranda with three small arches. It was built about 1770 by one Krishnambhat T\u00e1lke and a hall with wooden pillars, as in the temple of Vithoba, has been recently added to it. The other three temples are one of Krishn\u00e1b\u00e1i and another of Krishneshvar Mah\u00e1dev built in 1754 and 1790 by Krishna Dikshit Chipunkar; and a temple on the right of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road with a handsome flight of steps begun by one of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1nis in 1865. Besides these temples M\u00e1lhuli has on each side of the road leading to the ferry several tombs or cenotaphs to members of the late royal family of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and others. One or two of these have some simple but handsome stone carving.\n\nM\u00e1lhuli was the birthplace of R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1stri Parbhone the famous spiritual and political adviser of the fourth Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v (1761-1772). M\u00e1lhuli was the scene of an interview between the last Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1796-1817) and Sir John Malcolm just before war was declared against him and during his wandering he constantly returned to M\u00e1lhuli.\n\nMakrandgad, 4054 feet above sea level, well known to Mah\u00e1baleshvar visitors as the Saddleback, is a hill fort situated as the crow flies seven miles south-west of Malcolm Peth. It is well named the Saddleback and consists of two flattened humps with a ridge between them. From almost any part of the western face of the hill between Bombay and Babington points it forms a fine object in the magnificent pile of hills varied in form and colour which form the south-west group. It is perhaps best seen from Sassoon Point where several peaks and ridges in the background serve for contrast and throw it into strong relief. It is about 650 feet lower than the Mah\u00e1baleshvar plateau, but to reach the summit it is necessary to walk from ten to twelve miles and descend about 1800 feet into the\n\n---\n\n1 The illustrious dead from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the neighbouring villages are brought for cremation to M\u00e1lhuli.\n2 One tomb with the figure of a sitting dog is said to mark the burial place of a favourite dog of R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1hu (1708-1749) called Ved\u00e1 R\u00e1ja or the Mad King from his eccentricities. It was a black greyhound and saved Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s life by its furious barking, which called the king\u2019s attention to a tiger which was in the act of springing on him. On one occasion Sh\u00e1hu dressed him in gold brocade covered with jewels and put his own turban on his head when he was about to receive two Mar\u00e1tha chiefs in full court. A palanquin establishment was kept up for him.

The easiest way is to take a path beyond Babington Point which descends by Devli village whence after crossing the Koyna a fairly gradual ascent leads to the village of Ghonaspur lying on a shoulder of the hill at the south-east corner of the scarp. The line of the ridge is north-west south-east. The south-east hump is scalable but the north-west very difficult to climb if possible. On the south-east hump is a temple of Mallik\u00e1rjun built by Shiv\u00e1ji and an unused spring. The fort walls are broken down and appear not to have been very strong at any time. The local story about this as about other S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forts is that it was built by Shiv\u00e1ji probably about 1656 at the same time as Prat\u00e1pgad. It was a fort of minor importance as it commanded none of the important passes, but it served as a link in the chain between V\u00e1sota and Prat\u00e1pgad. It was surrendered by private negotiation on 14th May 1818 at the same time as Prat\u00e1pgad.\n\nMala, a small village sixteen miles south-west of P\u00e1tan on a plateau at the very edge of the Sahy\u00e1dris, gives its name to a very favourite bullock pass which connects the port of Sangameshvar in Ratn\u00e1giri with the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. The road from P\u00e1tan is by the Kumbh\u00e1rli metalled road as far as the Yerad ferry, then by Morgiri on to Kokisri, whence by an easy ascent is climbed a long spur ten miles of a level path along which leads to Mala. The path crosses a small ridge about a mile from Mala and the camping ground adjoins a temple situated in a shallow basin of rice and flat lands surrounded by the rounded tops of the neighbouring hills. A mile\u2019s walk over nearly dead level ground leads to the edge of the pass from where on clear days a fine view as far as the sea is obtainable. There are a few bison and s\u00e1mbhar in this neighbourhood, but to beat the forest a very large number of men and two or three guns are required. In October, and, if the monsoon is late, after the first fall of thundershowers, there is a fair chance of falling in with game by stalking in the early morning. The Mala forests are not good for bear, but tigers not unfrequently roam in the neighbourhood. The climate in the hot weather is delicious and the ascent at Kokisri once made easy a fair weather track for carts and rough carriages would easily be maintained. The bullock traffic is chiefly along another spur from Dhebev\u00e1di a village in the V\u00e1ng valley. The ascent is not much steeper than at Kokisri and the ten miles of track along the ridge by P\u00e1n\u00e9ri and Humbarni are equally easy. These two villages as well as P\u00e1nchgani on the other route are good places for bear and s\u00e1mbhar shooting. There is also a track to Helv\u00e1k but this is less used and the ascent at N\u00e1v is exceedingly steep.\n\nMa'la'vdi, near the head of the M\u00e1n river, is a village of 1363 people in the M\u00e1n sub-division, seven miles north-west of Dahivadi. There is some tolerable land near the village and river, but low rocky hills close the village in on three sides, and at a very little distance from the village the ground is very broken and the country rugged and wild. The village has walls with gates flanked with bastions on the north and south between which is the market street lined.\n\n---\n\n1 Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha War Papers, 343.\nwith shops. There is now only a small local traffic, but in Mar\u00e1tha times M\u00e1l\u00e1vdi was the home of the Gh\u00e1tges one of the most influential Mar\u00e1tha families. The Gh\u00e1tges were Deshmukhs and Sardeshmukhs of M\u00e1n and their chief had a mansab or command of horse or some equivalent dignity under the Bahmani dynasty. The title of Sardeshmukh was given them in 1626 when it was bestowed on N\u00e1goji Gh\u00e1tge as an unconditional favour by the sixth Bij\u00e1pur king Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h (1580-1626), together with the title of Jhunj\u00e1r R\u00e1v. The great ancestor of the family was R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja Gh\u00e1tge who had a small mansab under the Bahmanis. From that period the Gh\u00e1tges have been notorious for their family feuds. They held in\u00e1m and j\u00e1gir lands under the Bij\u00e1pur government immediately subject to the control of the mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r or district administrator and served it with a body of horse.\u00b9 In 1657 when Aurangzeb attacked Bij\u00e1pur Sarjer\u00e1v Gh\u00e1tge joined the Bij\u00e1pur general Kh\u00e1n Muhammad with his troops.\u00b2 About 1680 the Deshmukhi claims of M\u00e1l\u00e1vdi were given by the Moghals to the Br\u00e1hman Deshmukhs of Khat\u00e1v. When returned to the Gh\u00e1tges on their submission they were placed under the Br\u00e1hmans\u2019 surveillance. The Gh\u00e1tges were plundering without stint over the whole district up to Malk\u00e1pur near Panh\u00e1la, although Aurangzeb\u2019s army was within forty miles of them. The present representative of the family, enjoying a yearly revenue of about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000), is Shiv\u00e1ji bin Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed Gh\u00e1tge who resides both at M\u00e1l\u00e1vdi and Budle.\n\nMallika\u0301rjun Hill in V\u00e1lva, about 1000 feet above the plain, is a point in the range of hills which breaks off from the Kandur spur at Yeupe about twelve miles south-west of Kar\u00e1d and with a break at the joint boundaries of the villages of Itkare and Yede Nip\u00e1ni runs as far as Pokharni and Bavachi close to Ashta. The hill is more or less conical in shape with a flat plateau of about ten acres on the top. The ascent can be made from M\u00e1lev\u00e1di on the south or from Yede or Gotkhindi on the north from two to three miles either way. On the flat plateau at the summit are three large tombs of Musalm\u00e1n saints or p\u00edrs and several smaller ones much resorted to by devout Musalm\u00e1ns. The chief mausoleum is of Ch\u00e1nd, a native of Bokh\u00e1ra in Tartary who is said to have lived here as a devotee and died some three or four centuries ago. A hundred years later one G\u00e1vri built him the mausoleum which is a whitewashed stone building with a small dome about twenty feet square and twenty feet high. Another follower Badrud-din of Baghd\u00e1d in Turkey in Asia came some seventy years ago and his disciple one Satu a Mar\u00e1tha from S\u00e1ngli built his mausoleum. Ann\u00e1ji, son of Satu, built another to his father\u2019s memory adjoining Badrud-d\u00edn\u2019s and Ann\u00e1ji\u2019s son N\u00e1ikji is still alive and lives in attendance at the mosque. This is a living instance of a Mar\u00e1tha family becoming hereditary disciples of Musalm\u00e1n saints without breaking with their own religion. N\u00e1ikji has built a Hindu temple to his father Ann\u00e1ji which lies on the south-east while ascending the northern slope from Gotkhindi. The temple of Mallik\u00e1rjun lies about 700 feet off the plain. At less than\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 39. \u00b2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 71.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nMallik\u00e1rjun Hill.\n\na third of the way or about 200 feet from the plain is the P\u00e1t\u00e1l Ganga spring. From here a path with steps leads about 400 feet higher up to the first terrace which was built on to the side of the hill in mortared masonry by one Shid\u00e1ppa Gogre of Panh\u00e1la about 1830. About seventy-five feet higher is another and the chief terrace also built by Gogre about sixty feet long by twenty broad and on a level with some caves which are now dedicated to Mallik\u00e1rjun. Round the north-east and west sides up to the various buildings is a parapet. The entrance is up some steps a little east of the centre. A little west of the centre and in the middle of the terrace are two lamp pillars or dipm\u00e1ls with a basil platform between, evidently modern.\n\nCaves.\n\nBeginning from the east the first is a modern cave-like structure of two masonry arches and a flat roof built forty years ago by Lingappa, a V\u00e1ni of Botkh\u00e1l in S\u00e1ngli. Close to it on the west is an old cave twenty-five feet long by nine deep and six feet high with two arches and a partition in the centre forming a double cell. The roof is flat and the arched entrance modern. The third close by is a small temple of K\u00e1lbhairav with a conical tower also modern. Adjoining this to the west is a large cave twenty feet long by eighteen feet deep with two arches at the face. An open space of four feet is followed by a masonry veranda of three arched divisions and evidently modern twenty-one feet long and ten feet broad. In a line with this is another veranda of four divisions a pillar supporting each. The veranda is not more than six feet high, about twenty-one feet long and eight feet broad, built of masonry and against the face of the rock in which a small door about five feet high by two feet broad is cut. Inside is the main temple, a flat roofed chamber (21' \u00d7 16' \u00d7 5' 10\"), the roof supported on four squat pillars in three courses two rectangular with a cylindrical one between them. The space between the pillars from east to west is about ten feet and between the two southern pillars a vestibule sixteen feet by ten is made leading to a small door four feet by two which opens into the shrine or g\u00e1th\u00e1ra. The shrine is about ten feet by eight and contains a ling of Somn\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev. Westward from the outer division of the mandap is a chamber (10' 7\" \u00d7 8' \u00d7 9') containing the ling of Mallik\u00e1rjun Mah\u00e1dev. The roof here is very thin and a conical spire has been built upon the rock by some modern restorer. To the west of this again is a small stone basin. To the north and in a line with the veranda of the mandap is the Nandi chamber also dug in the rock which projects here beyond the entrance of the mandap. Again upon the terrace and in front of this is another modern Nandi chamber surmounted with a drum-chamber or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na built about fifty years ago by a V\u00e1ni of Nard in the \u00c1lta petty division of Kolh\u00e1pur. He also built the veranda in front of the chief mandap. A little above and adjoining the pond next the Nandi cave is a double flat-roofed cave seventeen feet long east to west by twelve deep and six high and to the west of these are two more modern masonry cells built by Sakhoba a V\u00e1ni of Shir\u00e1la in V\u00e1lva. The path to M\u00e1lev\u00e1di leads past a small spring in a stone basin the water of which however is not used. Further on on the south side is another spring constantly used about 220 yards from Mallik\u00e1rjun's temple and about thirty more from the Musalm\u00e1n tombs above.\nNothing is known of the maker of the caves which are admitted to be ancient though artificial. The sage Agastya mentioned in the Karvir Mahatmya as the devotee of Mallikarjun is generally accredited with being the builder. Somnath is said to be the older form of the deity. Its position would make it probable that it is the chief one but the only fair held here is in honour of Mallikarjun on the first and last Mondays of Shravan or July-August, when about 500 people assemble and the god\u2019s palanquin or palkhi is carried in procession. The temple is a favourite spot of worship with the Jains and Lingayat Vanis. Shidappa Gogre the Vani of Panhala lately made extensive repairs and built the very fine terraces and his sons set aside a portion of their earnings for this purpose year by year. The pillars of the mandap are very curious and are sharply cut, while the roof and wall doors are the same. Except a little moulding the doors have no carving. There are no signs in any of the caves of stone benches or beds and the set is classed by Dr. Burgess as Brahmanical the pillars being of about the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\nMandhardev is a point in the Mahadev range lying six miles north of Wai from which a spur branches northward to Ving. It crowns a long plateau which is easily reached by the bridle path known as Phayre\u2019s road from Wai on the south whence the ascent is eight miles, from Shirval on the north whence the ascent is about thirteen, or from the west by Baleghar about ten miles by a road made from the top of the Khamatki pass. All these roads were made at about the same time when it was intended to make Mandhardev a health resort for troops. This plateau is about twelve miles long and generally about half a mile wide looking down some 2000 feet on the north and west to the Bhor territory and the Khandala petty division and about 1500 on the south towards Wai. A small dip on the west contains a rest-house, garden, and an excellent water cistern built by Tai Sahib Sachiv the great grandmother of the present prince of Bhor. To the west again of the dip is the plateau of Yeruli similar to Mandhardev and about four miles long. The height above sea-level of the Mandhardev peak is 4510. There are still traces of the road made by Government when the health resort was under consideration and to the west are the remains of a travellers\u2019 bungalow. The hill is very bare, the slopes on all sides for about a hundred feet down being under cultivation. The only exception is an Anjan grove which surrounds a temple of Devi. The temple is said to be 300 years old. It was built in honour of Kalubai or Kaleshwari Devi the patron goddess of the village. The idol has two silver masks and some garments. About 1850 a spire was added to the temple. The temple enjoys about 47\u00be acres of rent-free land assessed at \u00a31 3s. (Rs. 11\u00bd). The grant is entered in the name both of Mandeshvar and Kaleshwari. The masks are carried in procession. The Guravs perform worship by turns for a fortnight and the offerings go to each during his turn. A yearly fair lasting for a day and night and attended by about 5000 people takes place on the full-moon of Paush or December-January. The offerings are estimated at \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Above the temple is a small flat\n\n---\n\n1 Cave Temples of India, 427-428.\nspace on the hill top where the people who assemble at the yearly fair usually camp. The spot commands an extensive view on all sides and Purandhar in Poona stands out with a special boldness to the north.\n\n**Masur.**\n\nMasur in Kar\u00e1d is a village of 4530 inhabitants, lying on the left bank of a stream at the junction of the Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1rgaon and Umbraj-Pandharpur roads four miles east of Umbraj and eight miles north of Kar\u00e1d. The village obtains a copious water-supply from the stream on which it lies. The surrounding land is most of it excellent black soil with unusual facilities for irrigation by water-lifts and small dams yielding some of the best wheat crops in the Kar\u00e1d subdivision. Masur has a vernacular school with over a hundred boys and a village post office. The village has one main street running west to east with an open space at the west end which serves for a market. To the north of this market is a large building with the remains of a wall about twenty feet high with corner bastions. The walls enclose a space of about two acres and contain a large mansion in the native style with a two-storeyed building in the east, a quadrangle in the middle centre, and stabling in the west. This was formerly the head-quarters office of the T\u00e1rgaon sub-division which reached as far west as Helv\u00e1k. Before this Masur was a mud fort under the Pratinidhi, and in 1806 the Pant Pratinidhi Parshur\u00e1m Shriniv\u00e1s was confined here, shut up by the last Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v and his mother who was backed up by Balvantr\u00e1v Phadnis the mut\u00e1l\u00edk or deputy. B\u00e1pu Gokhale was sent to enforce submission, and for a time the country was quiet, but shortly afterwards T\u00e1i Telin an oilwoman mistress of the Pratinidhi collected a force in V\u00e1sota, descended on Masur, carried it, and released the Pratinidhi prisoner.\u00b9\n\n**M\u00e1yni.**\n\nM\u00e1yni, 17\u00b027' north latitude and 74\u00b034' east longitude, a municipal town with in 1881 a population of 2997 or nineteen more than in 1872, lies thirteen miles south-east of Vaduj at the junction of the T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u00e1la and Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur roads. It has a vernacular school, a village post office, and to the north a lake built by the Irrigation Department in 1875-76 with a small irrigation bungalow about a mile east of the town.\u00b2 The town is walled and entered by gates on the west and east. A tolerable water-supply is obtained from a stream which runs by the north-east of the town and falls into the Yerla five miles south-west. The canal and most of the good soil lie to the south of the town. In places where the level of the land is too high for water to be obtained direct from the canal, it is raised by water-lifts attached to small wells dug near the canal banks and supplied by sluices from the canal.\n\nThe municipality which was established in 1854 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a343 (Rs. 430) and an expenditure of \u00a338 12s. (Rs. 386). In a revenue statement of about 1790 M\u00e1yni appears as the head-\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 615-616.\n\u00b2 Details of the M\u00e1yni lake are given above p.154.\nquarters of a sub-division in the R\u00e1ybag sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a31312 (Rs. 13,120). In 1827 Captain Clunes notices M\u00e1yni as a kasba or market town with 600 houses, thirty shops, and a water-course.\n\nMedha, 17\u00b0 46' north latitude and 73\u00b0 56' east longitude, about fourteen miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is the head-quarters of the J\u00e1lvi sub-division with in 1881 a population of 1407 or 215 more than in 1872. Medha lies about a hundred yards from the left bank of the Yenna which is crossed about a few hundred yards above by a foot-bridge and has an excellent water supply in some cisterns or stone basins filled from a pipe fed by a spring in the range of hills to the north of the town. The Medha-B\u00e1mnoli and Medha-Gogva bullock tracks leading to the Koyna and Solshi valleys start from Medha. A well built fair weather track passes through a gorge about ten miles north-north-east to Kud\u00e1l and a perennial road joins Medha with S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Malcolm Peth. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices, Medha has a Monday market, a school, a post office, a travellers' bungalow, and, since the passing of the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act, a sub-judge's court. The sub-divisional offices are located in a native building where in 1880 a large number of Government records were destroyed by fire.\n\nMhasvad, 17\u00b0 38' north latitude and 74\u00b0 55' east longitude in M\u00e1n, seventeen miles south-east of Dahivadi and about fifty-three miles east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is a municipal town, and in its village extent the largest in the M\u00e1n sub-division. It lies on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road on the left bank of the M\u00e1n and had in 1891 a population of 5581 or 740 less than in 1872, the fall being chiefly due to the 1877 famine which was very severe in the M\u00e1n sub-division. The 1872 census showed 6058 Hindus and 263 Musalm\u00e1ns and the 1881 census showed 5354 Hindus and 227 Musalm\u00e1ns. The municipality which was established in 1857 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3238 4s. (Rs. 2382) and an expenditure of \u00a3182 10s. (Rs. 1825). Mhasvad is enclosed by a ruined mud wall with corner bastions. The town has one main street running from east to west and leading to the Pandharpur road which runs round the north of the town. It is about half a mile long and thirty feet broad with on each side grain and cloth shops. A weekly market is held on Wednesday. It is an important trade centre with about sixty traders mostly Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Shimpis, Jains, and Sangars. Bombay and English piece-goods are brought in large quantities by Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis and Shimpis from Bombay and Poona. The V\u00e1nis and Jains buy from the growers spiked millet raw sugar wheat and earthnuts and send them in cart-loads to Shol\u00e1pur and Pandharpur in the east and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Mah\u00e1d and Chiplun in the west, and from Chiplun bring salt coconuts and spices. The Sangars buy sheep's wool-twist from the Dhangars, weave it into blankets or k\u00e1mlis, and send them to Chiplun, Mah\u00e1d, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Pandharpur, and Shol\u00e1pur. To the north-east of the town is\n\n---\n\n1 Waring's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.\n2 Itinerary, 62.\nthe dispensary in charge of a hospital assistant which was established in 1871 and in 1883 treated thirty-two in-patients and 4121 out-patients at a cost of \u00a359 4s. (Rs. 592). Besides the dispensary the town has a post office and two schools.\n\nNear the west entrance of the town in the north side of the street is the temple of Shidn\u00e1th usually called N\u00e1th. The original structure is evidently ancient and recoursed. The g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra or image-chamber, with an internal area of 20' by 20' but outside about 30' by 30' is of the star shape and built of gray basalt. It contains images of N\u00e1th and his wife Jog\u00e1i in human form. The walls are ten feet high. The original unmortared blocks have been replaced by smaller ones in mortar but the old shape has been retained. The spire thirty feet high is of brick and lime with a series of octagonal concentric storeys. The mandap has a vestibule about 6' by 6' the walls of which are in black basalt and have a wainscot of carved stone figures. This leads into a mandap now an oblong structure (30'\u00d720') with a roof ten feet high. In the centre are four of the ancient pillars in the usual octagonal cylindrical and rectangular courses excellently carved and moulded. The whole is on a plinth four feet high. Outside this is a modern court about fifty feet square enclosed on three sides by rude verandas of stone and mud with wooden pillars. On the wall of the western veranda is imbedded a large black stone on which is a very plainly written K\u00e1narese inscription. Every evening Pur\u00e1ns are read here by a Br\u00e1hman. On the fourth or southern side is a detached hall on wooden pillars about 50' by 30' and beyond this again an uncovered court. Just outside the southern end of the hall is a large black stone elephant about 5' high and 4' broad with the right foot raised and trunk curled. A legend explains that N\u00e1th rescued from drowning in the Ganges the elephant of which this is the image. It is much venerated and many offerings are presented to it. Attached to the right foot is a small chain and the story goes that rheumatism can be cured by waving the chain over the shoulders; also that if any one fail while visiting the temple to give a suitable offering to the elephant, the chain will be discovered next day in his field, and he will have to return it to the temple under pain of severe calamities arising from the displeasure of N\u00e1th. The court also contains at the south-east corner a fine lamp-pillar. Two archways lead into the street of which the inner about thirty feet high is a little higher than the outer archway. Who built the original temple is not known, as the inscription has not been made out. The courts, archways, lamp-pillar and restorations are mostly about 200 years old, the work of B\u00e1j\u00e1ji D\u00e1b\u00e1l a member of the Kar\u00e1d Deschaughula family. A yearly fair is held on the bright first of M\u00e1rghshirsh or November-December, when the masks of the images are driven in a car. Besides the usual articles of trade this fair, which is attended by about 20,000 people and lasts for about fifteen days, has a special traffic in horses and cattle. The number of cattle and horses sheep and goats exhibited reaches about 3000, and as much as \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) are estimated to change hands. Six miles south-east of Mhasvad at\nR\u00e1jev\u00e1di in the \u00c1tp\u00e1di territory is the great Mhasvad irrigation lake which when full covers an area of six square miles.\\(^1\\)\n\nMhasvad was the home of the M\u00e1ne family who were its Deshmukhs. The M\u00e1nes were distinguished Shiled\u00e1rs under the Bij\u00e1pur government but nearly as notorious for their revengeful character as the Shirkes.\\(^2\\) In 1827 Captain Clunes notices Mhasvad as a kasba or market town with 735 houses, sixty shops, and a bi-weekly market.\\(^3\\)\n\n**Nandgiri** or **Kalya'ngad Fort**, 3537 feet above sea level, stands at the end of a spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range running south-west from the villages of Vikhle and Bh\u00e1dle, eight miles north of Koregaon and about fourteen miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It is separated from the rest of the spur by a small gorge or *khind* and stands on a lower hill than the Chandan Vandan range close to its north-west. It forms therefore a less conspicuous object from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra than the Chandan Vandan twins, though from the south it comes prominently in view as it forms the southern extremity of the spur dividing the V\u00e1ngna and V\u00e1sna valleys. The hill sides are very steep and rugged and the scarp is very perfect. There is no regular approach and the ascent is made by very tortuous and precipitous footpaths from Dhum\u00e1lv\u00e1di the village immediately at the foot of the hill to the east to the first gate directly above the village and facing north. Though easy at first, the ascent becomes very steep afterwards and much blocked by prickly pear. Halfway up in a ravine is a good spring and pond known as the Kh\u00e1m pond with near it some large tamarind and *pipal* trees. The pond is hollowed out of the rock in three divisions and the roof is supported by pillars. The water is good and abundant.\\(^4\\) The fort has two gateways the one below the other connected by steps. The first gate faces north, the path turning abruptly as it is reached. Within is a hollow used formerly for stores. From the inside facing east is another cave pond called the Gavi also full of good water. The entrance to it is protected by a wall and there is a drain apparently to furnish water to people outside saving them the trouble to go in and fetch it. This cave pond is now very difficult of access, the way being thickly blocked with prickly pear. The second gateway of mortared stone leads out into the plateau, which is about two hundred yards high by one hundred broad with many ruined buildings, and four chief ponds inside the second gate. The first pond is about ninety feet by forty in area and twenty feet deep, its sides made of large blocks of masonry. Another smaller one is near the eastern face; a third is in a hollow stopped with an earthen dam; and the fourth is a small one near the south wall.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Details of the Mhasvad irrigation lake are given above pp. 156-157.\n\n\\(^2\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e9s, 39.\n\n\\(^3\\) Itinerary, 64.\n\n\\(^4\\) Mr. H. R. Cooke, C. S., found that perhaps the most remarkable feature on the hill was its water-supply. Immediately after entering the lower gate a steep footpath descends within the western wall into a hollow at the bottom of the scarp. The hollow is about forty or fifty feet deep. When the bottom is reached the entrance to a huge cavern is seen which can only be reached by stooping. The cavern is full of water but very dark. Outside the gate and to the north there evidently were huge caverns but these have been built up with rough masonry.\nHere was situated the head-quarters office or kacheri, the stone plinth and brick walls of which still remain. Near it are the remains of the houses of the garrison and a small mosque and mausoleum in honour of Abdul Karim a Musalm\u00e1n saint. The tomb is still visited and, though the roof has fallen in, a cloth still covers the tomb. Immediately behind the tomb is a large banian tree forming a conspicuous object for many miles around. All the building remains except a few tombs to the north end. The south end is entirely open and probably formed a place for amusement or parade. The hill-top is fairly level and surrounded by a wall of large blocks of unmortared stone very massive and ancient. There were two guns on the fort which were taken away at the Mutiny. According to the grandsons of a former m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r and a k\u00e1rkun of the fort establishment, the fort was the head-quarters of an administrative sub-division with a treasury and had an establishment of a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, fadnis, sabnis, havald\u00e1r and daff\u00e9d\u00e1r, two k\u00e1rkuns, three n\u00e1iks, and one hundred and sixty sepoys. According to tradition the fort was built by the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra king Bhoj II. of Panh\u00e1la. In 1673 with other S\u00e1t\u00e1ra forts it surrendered to Shiv\u00e1ji. The Pratinidhi administered it till his struggle with B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the second Peshwa (1720 - 1740). In 1791 Major Price describes it as looking like the hull of a ship of war with opposite it another hill with on its summit some places of devotion. In the last Mar\u00e1tha war it fell to the army of General Pritzler in April 1818 without firing a shot. In 1862 it is described as a dismantled and uninhabited fort with a steep approach and a strong gateway but no water and no supplies.\n\nNerla in V\u00e1lva is a large village of 680 inhabitants, two miles north of Peth on the east of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Kolhapur mail road, with a travellers' bungalow and a vernacular school. A quarter of a mile south of the town close to the west of the mail road is a market place, with shops chiefly of grain dealers and wheelwrights lining three sides of a square. Carts generally stop here on their way to and from Chiplun. The village has also a much frequented market for cattle and grain. Since the establishment in 1855 of a municipality at Isl\u00e1mpur or Urun about five miles to the south-east with its consequent octroi much of the trade has shifted to Nerla. The village is often in difficulties for water, as a pond on the west contains a supply, which though constant is of a very bad quality. Nerla had a municipality under the old Act which was abolished in 1873. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices Nerla as a post runner's station with 400 houses, one shop, a water-course, and wells.\n\nNher village in Khat\u00e1v on the right bank of the Yerla, fourteen miles north-west of Vaduj and a mile north of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road, gives its name to a large storage lake built by the Irrigation department between 1876 and 1881. In its land to the north is the P\u00e1lu M\u00e1l a stretch of rocky ground interesting on\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 13 note 3.  \n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 116.  \n3 Memoirs of a Field Officer, 261.  \n4 Bombay Courier, 11th and 18th April 1818.  \n5 Government List of Civil Forts, 1862.  \n6 Itinerary, 34.  \n7 Details of the Nher storage reservoir are given above p. 152.\naccount of its having had a standing camp of the Moghals for twelve years.\n\nNigdi village on the right bank of the Krishna eleven miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and four miles south-west of Rahimatpur has the tomb or sam\u00e1dh of a famous religious teacher or mah\u00e1purush named Raghn\u00e1thsv\u00e1mi. In 1791 Major Price notices it as being in possession of a fraternity of Gos\u00e1vis to whom it was originally granted by Shiv\u00e1ji.\u00b9\n\nNimb is a flourishing market town about eight miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with in 1831 a population of 3968. It is alienated to R\u00e1j\u00e1ram Bhonsla the adopted son of the late S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1nis. The neighbourhood of Nimb is noted in the district for its fruit especially mangoes though not of a very superior variety. Grapes also are occasionally grown. In 1751 Nimb was the scene of a victory by Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikv\u00e1d who was advancing to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the interests of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i against the Peshwa's faction. He was opposed by 20,000 men being 5000 more than his own force at the S\u00e1lpi pass. He drove them back to Nimb where he defeated them and caused several of the forts to be given up to T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i.\u00b2\n\nNimsod in Khat\u00e1v, about ten miles south of Vaduj, is mentioned in a revenue statement of about 1790 as the head-quarters of a pargana in the R\u00e1ybag sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a32625 (Rs. 26,250).\u00b3 In 1827 Captain Clunes notices it as a market town or kasba with 225 houses, fifteen shops, a water-course, and wells.\u2074\n\nP\u00e1l village, originally called R\u00e1japur, lies on both banks of the T\u00e1rla about twenty miles north-west of Kar\u00e1d, and had in 1881 a population of 3617. The village is chiefly remarkable for a temple of Khandoba where a yearly fair attended by about 50,000 people is held in December-January.\n\nOn the right bank of the river is the market street containing the shops of the chief grain dealers, moneylenders, and merchants, and most of the dwellings. On the left bank is the noted temple of Khandoba and the houses of the worshippers priests and a few others. The temple lies on the site of a legendary appearance by the god Khandoba to a favourite devotee, a milkmaid named P\u00e1lai in whose honour the village name was changed from R\u00e1japur to P\u00e1l. The temple was built about 400 years ago by a V\u00e1ni named \u00c1ba bin Sheti Padhode. It is a very favourite resort with all classes and has been added to in many ways. The original structure consists of a stone shrine or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra and a porch thirty-five feet by twenty-eight from outside. The porch is enclosed by four pillars very plain but of the old pattern, the shaft being cut in rectangular octagonal and cylindrical blocks, but in mortar which shows that the temple is not older than the thirteenth century. The image-chamber sixteen feet square inside contains on a pedestal two lings with brass masks representing Khandoba and his consort Mh\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1i. On the right hand is a black stone image of\n\n\u00b9 Memoirs of a Field Officer, 260.\n\u00b2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 274.\n\u00b3 Waring's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.\n\u2074 Itinerary, 62.\nB\u00e1nub\u00e1i another wife of Khandoba, and behind are brass figures on horseback representing Khandoba's chief minister Hegadi Pendh\u00e1ri and his wife. The porch holds in niches on the north the image of Ganpati and on the south the image of Siddhav\u00e1sini. On the north is the drain for water poured on the images, covered with a canopy and flanked by stone horses. To these buildings Dhan\u00e1ji bin Sambh\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav, the well known Mar\u00e1tha general who flourished in the reigns of Shiv\u00e1ji (1627-1689) and R\u00e1jar\u00e1m (1689-1708) and died in 1709, added a hall or mandap twenty-one feet square with open sides. It is supported on twelve pillars about two feet high and similar to those in the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra porch and surrounded by a bench with a carved back. The roof has the usual broad carved eaves and parapet. The whole is of stone but the pillars are disfigured by whitewash and painting. Several of them are coated with brass and have a little poor carving. At each corner of the mandap is a small pinnacle and in the centre a small arched spire or shikhar. Over the porch of the shrine is a rather large spire and over the shrine itself is the main spire about fifty feet high off the ground, and tapering from the base which is as large as the shrine roof. All the spires are of brick and more or less ornamented in stucco with niches painted with mythological designs and images of gods and goddesses. The ornamentation is neither good nor elaborate. But the parts of the building are in good proportion which makes it look massive and imposing without being heavy.\n\nThe temple occupies the centre of a fine square court paved throughout and measuring one hundred and forty feet east to west by eighty feet north to south. The court also contains at the north-west corner a small shrine of Omk\u00e1reshvar Mah\u00e1dev, and in the southwest corner one of Hegadi. In front that is east of the mandap is the canopy with the image of the sacred bull Nandi covered with brass. On each side are two carved stone lamp-pillars or dipm\u00e1ls about fifteen feet high. The bases are supported by grotesque stone images of elephants and bulls. Still further east is another rather larger canopy containing a brass-coated stone elephant, about one-third of life-size and rather well carved. To the south of the Nandi canopy is a small temple to Shiv\u00e1ji and to its north is a platform for the tulsi or basil plant. The wall of the court is about twenty feet high, and the west, the north-west, half of the south, and north half of the east side are all cloistered, the former in ogee arches and fine masonry, the work of His Highness Sindia, and the latter with flat roof resting on plain pillars of the old pattern built by Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav. The outer roof of these cloisters is flat and serves as a terrace and promenade. Compartments of the cloisters are walled up at irregular intervals and used as lodgings for devotees and permanent worshippers and for stabling the horses attached to the god's establishment. In the pavement of the court are embedded stone tortoises, while between the Nandi canopy and the mandap is a large tortoise coated with brass. The court-yard has three entrances. The eastern is a small doorway six and a half feet wide flanked inside by two large stone lamp-pillars thirty feet high with twelve sets of brackets for lamps handsomely carved and by far the finest lamp-pillars in the court.\nThis gate and lamp-pillars were built by Gam\u00e1ji Chavh\u00e1n, a p\u00e1t\u00edl of Nher in the Khat\u00e1v sub-division. The northern entrance is another small doorway built by the Sindi\u00e1s in their cloisters. The southern about twelve feet high by five feet wide is the chief and the finest gateway to the south of Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav\u2019s cloisters. Inside it is flanked by two cloistered chambers, the western chamber forming the end of Dhan\u00e1ji\u2019s cloisters and containing an image of M\u00e1ru; the eastern consisting of two cloisters and containing a smaller image of Ganpati was built by the Ghorpades of Mudhol. On the top is an ornamental music-chamber or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na in brick and mortar which with the archway of the gate was the work of the M\u00e1nes of Rahimatpur. Outside the court is an outer yard also paved with stone. The east side has a rough wall with some ruined cloisters; the south side contains a rectangular stone building originally built with a dome and eaves supported by carved brackets, of which the latter raised by Dhan\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav still remain. The rest of the south side and most of the west is taken up by buildings, but in the west is another very large gateway thirty feet high twenty feet broad and two feet thick, with a massive stone pointed archway about six feet broad inside. This was erected by Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev the founder of the Kar\u00e1d Mut\u00e1l\u00edk family. The number of prominent historical families in the Deccan who have bestowed gifts on this temple shows the great veneration in which it is held. Besides lands assigned for the maintenance of its establishment the temple enjoys a Government yearly cash grant of \u00a330 (Rs. 300). The offerings at the great December-January fair are estimated at about \u00a360 (Rs. 600), while many offerings are made throughout the year. Every pilgrim entering the temple at the fair time has to pay a toll of \u00bdd. (\u00bc anna) and an equal shop tax is levied without official authority on every trader. A clerk superintends the finances of the establishment and carries the metal masks of the god in procession. The worshippers and priests are Guravs and Br\u00e1hmans and, connected with the temple, as at Jejuri, are many Murlis or female devotees mostly women of easy virtue.\n\nThe great yearly fair held in the month of Paush or December-January is attended by about 50,000 people from all parts of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the neighbouring districts. The pilgrims usually camp in the bed of the T\u00e1rla which at this time forms a large dry beach. The fair proper lasts three or four days, being the days during which the marriage ceremony of the god Khandoba is supposed to proceed. The days vary slightly with some conjunction of stars. The traders linger some time longer. Copper and brass pots, bangles, piece-goods, silk-cloth, country blankets, and other small articles are sold at the fair, the sales amounting to more than \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000). Sanitary arrangements are superintended by the village officers and the district police who keep water free from pollution and dig trenches for latrine purposes. Cholera once broke out during the 1869 fair when forty-three out of sixty-one reported cases proved fatal. A municipality at P\u00e1l was established under the old Act, but was abolished in 1872-73, as the committee took no active part in superintending the fair arrangements and the only\nwork of improvement was a general superintendence of the village cleanliness and sanitation and repair of the chief street.\n\nIn Mar\u00e1tha times P\u00e1l was a kasba or market town of some note on the main road from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to Kar\u00e1d. P\u00e1l village and temple are closely connected with a celebrated exploit of Chitursing in February 1799 in revenge for the defeat of his brother Sh\u00e1hu the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja. He had heard that R\u00e1stia was encamped near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort with a force of 2000 or 3000 men on behalf of the Peshwa. He accordingly led 600 infantry through the hills and valleys till opposite P\u00e1l where he remained concealed till night. He then repaired to the celebrated temple, performed the usual worship, and the whole party having solemnly invoked the deity, stained their clothes with yellow dye, rubbed their hands and faces with turmeric in token of a vow to win or die, and issued forth to the attack. The enemy was not unprepared but had only time to fire a few rounds when they were furiously charged sword in hand, their guns taken, and the whole body dispersed in a few minutes. Chitursing then retreated to Kolh\u00e1pur so quickly that he could not be overtaken.\u00b9\n\nPalshi, a small village to the north of the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road seven miles south-east of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, has to the extreme east a curious fort called Kuldrug about one hundred and ten acres in area. The fort lies on a plateau between two streams descending down a steep rocky hill into the M\u00e1n valley which lies about 700 feet below. There are remains of a wall and four bastions on the south-west side; all the rest has no defences except the great natural steepness of the hill side. Inside are the plinths of several buildings and the whole is said to be of great antiquity, the work of a Koli R\u00e1ja who endeavoured to head an insurrection against the Bhoj R\u00e1ja of Panh\u00e1la. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices Palshi as a small village on the V\u00e1sna with twenty-five houses.\u00b2\n\nP\u00e1lus is a large village of 4771 inhabitants on the Kar\u00e1d-T\u00e1sgaon road about ten miles north-west of T\u00e1sgaon. The village consists of one broad market street and a few small lanes. The Krishna Canal ends in the lands of this village. The soil is rich and sugarcane is abundantly grown in irrigated and a good deal of cotton in the unirrigated soils. The village has a vernacular school.\n\nP\u00e1nchgani\u00b3 in W\u00e1i, about ten miles west of W\u00e1i and about eleven miles east of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, is a small health-resort on the Surul-Mah\u00e1baleshvar road 4378 feet above sea level. The village, which, according to the 1881 census, had a population of 636, lies with five others on a Sahy\u00e1dri spar which juts out at Mah\u00e1baleshvar and terminates about a mile from W\u00e1i. Situated to the lee of Mah\u00e1baleshvar and about 200 feet lower, it escapes the heavy rain and fog of the outer range which are carried away into the valleys to the north and south. It is also happily shielded from the east wind by being built under a large extent of tableland. The magnificent\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 546. \u00b2 Itinerary, 32.\n\u00b3 Contributed by the Rev. Mr. Burgess, Headmaster P\u00e1nchgani High School.\nscenery of the Krishna valley extending for many miles from east to west with its numerous hamlets, highly cultivated fields, and picturesque river, can be seen along the whole northern ridge of the mountain. Though less extensive, the southern aspect is even more beautiful. The geological formation of P\u00e1nchgani is volcanic as is the rest of the Deccan. While all along the road up the hills from W\u00e1i to Dh\u00e1ndheghar two miles from P\u00e1nchgani trap is found, the soil on the hill top has a large admixture of oxide of iron which reddens the stratum into laterite. At the base of the scarp of the tableland are to be found bubbles thrown up in the rapid cooling of molten rock of preadamite days. The water-supply is from springs on the south-west of the hill all of which except three are on private grounds. Of the three public springs the most important and the chief source of the station water-supply lies on the north of the village and much below it in elevation. It has been built round and is known as the Mar\u00e1tha well. It has been very recently improved by Government at a cost of \u00a335 6s. (Rs. 353).\n\nConsidered as a sanitarium, P\u00e1nchgani stands almost unrivalled. With a temperature like that of Mah\u00e1baleshvar it has the eminent advantage over that charming health resort of being comfortably habitable throughout the year. The climate is cool salubrious and comparatively dry. It is excellently adapted for both adults and children but for children especially it is unsurpassed in India. The average rainfall is fifty-six inches\\(^1\\) or about a fifth of that of Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The temperature varied in 1883-84 from 55\u00b0 at 6 a.m. in December 1883 to 96\u00b0 at 2 p.m. in March 1884. The mean temperature at noon is 71\u00b0 and the mean daily range only 6\u00b0.\n\nThe European settlement was founded by private enterprise, chiefly through the energy and zeal of the late Mr. John Chesson, who, in 1854, began farming here on a small scale. After careful observations extending over many years,\\(^2\\) Mr. Chesson was satisfied that the climate and soil of P\u00e1nchgani were suitable for the cultivation of most of the fruits of the temperate zone, besides making it a cheap health resort for Europeans. By 1862 there were six substantial houses built by Europeans and a yearly grant of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000) was made to the station by Government in that year. Mr. Chesson was appointed Honorary Superintendent and Magistrate by Sir Bartle Frere. The great drawback to P\u00e1nchgani is its isolation; but the opening in 1886 of the West Deccan Railway will greatly benefit the station. If, as is probable, a branch line will be carried to W\u00e1i, this would bring P\u00e1nchgani within ten miles of the line of rail.\n\nThe 1881 census showed a population of 636 of whom 555 were Natives and eighty-one Europeans. The number of Europeans varies from 140 in the summer to about seventy-five through the rest of the year. The station is managed by a Superintendent with second class magisterial powers, and has, besides his office, a well-appointed travellers' bungalow, a rest-house, a post office, a market, a Government\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The rainfall in 1883 during the five rainy months June to October was 58 inches 11 cents.\n\n\\(^2\\) Chesson and Woodhall's Bombay Miscellany, IV. 336.\nvernacular school for natives and an aided high school for Europeans and Eurasians, a dispensary, and thirty residences three of them belonging to Government. The travellers' bungalow, which is about sixty-four feet long and 33\u00bd feet broad, has a cook-house, servant's and messman's rooms, and stables. It is much used by visitors on their way to Mah\u00e1baleshwar. The high school, which is managed by a committee in connection with the Diocesan Board of Education, was originally opened in 1876 and reopened in 1880 by the Bishop of Bombay. In 1884 it had an average of thirty-two pupils including day scholars and boarders. A neat and substantial school room (40' \u00d7 18') was added in 1884 at a cost of \u00a3260 (Rs. 2600). It is used for church services on Sundays. This school is the only one of its sort permanently located in the hills for European boarders and offers special advantages to those parents who, unable or unwilling to send their children to Europe, are yet anxious to remove them early from the injurious effects of the climate and surroundings of a life on the plains. In 1883-84 the dispensary treated 5163 out-patients. This is an increase in numbers not due to increased sickness in the neighbourhood, but to the continued presence of skilled medical officers who attract natives even from considerable distances, from as far as Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ba and Pandharpur in Shol\u00e1pur. The station funds, including a yearly Government contribution of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000), amounted in 1883-84 to \u00a3334 14s. (Rs. 3347) and the expenditure to \u00a3195 2s. (Rs. 1951).\n\nNurseries are attached to the station where experiments have been made in planting exotic and other trees and shrubs and in cultivating English potatoes, which with peaches, the pear, and the blackberry thrive in the mild climate. The coffee of P\u00e1nchgani has been favourably reported on by London brokers. Here too the sweet heliotrope and myrtle grow in wild profusion. The sweet briar, so rarely met with in India, flowers here; and the eye of the traveller from the dusty plains below is gladdened with the sight of lanes bordered with hedge-roses which festoon overhead entwined with honeysuckle. A single cluster of sixty or seventy roses is not an unusual sight. P\u00e1nchgani, always beautiful, is at its best in August and September when the fairy pimpernel the buttercup and the wild sweetpea cover the hillside while the springy turf of the tablelands is thickly carpeted with the velvety bluebonnet and the more delicate stargrass.\n\nP\u00e1ndavva\u2019di, a hamlet of Bhogaon village about three miles west of W\u00e1i, is apparently named like P\u00e1ndavgad from the legendary P\u00e1ndav princes. It is celebrated as the place where in 1673 died the great Mar\u00e1tha poet V\u00e1man Pandit a contemporary of Shiv\u00e1ji Tuk\u00e1r\u00e1m and R\u00e1md\u00e1s. V\u00e1man was a Rigvedi Deshashth Br\u00e1hman originally an astrologer of Koregaon. He studied the Sh\u00e1stras at Benares. His two great works are in the ovi metre a commentary on the Bhagvadgita and a metaphysical work called the Nigams\u00e1r.\u00b9\n\nP\u00e1ndavgad or P\u00e1ndugad Fort, 4177 feet above sea level, lies four miles north-west of W\u00e1i. The fort is conspicuous over a low spur branching east from its southern angle. A path to the\n\n\u00b9 Navanita (New Edition), 80-81.\nhamlet of Shel\u00e1rv\u00e1di leads on to a small break in the above mentioned spur and from this break the path continues by a shoulder of the hill, on which are a few huts belonging to Kolis formerly connected with the fort and now charged with attendance on the temples remaining there. The ascent from the Koli huts is steepish and for the last two hundred yards is in steps roughly cut in the sides of the hill. The fort is about six acres in extent and nearly square. Its defences consist of a scarp generally from forty to sixty feet high, more than usually precipitous and in many places actually overhanging and surmounted by a wall with masonry ramparts. The original materials of enormous blocks of dry stone have nearly all disappeared and except the northern end where the gateway and wall are of the huge masonry of the old forts, what remains is very light work. On the south is a modern bastion in tolerable repair. The entrance consisted of a single archway with apparently no door. On the top which is nearly level is a large pond one hundred feet by sixty now quite empty and silted up. The water apparently was first let out by blowing up the scarp and wall which form the outer side. The fort has fourteen other ponds and cisterns almost all empty and useless except two still used by the Kolis, and two small temples of Pandj\u00e1\u00ed Devi and M\u00e1ru\u00ed. The fort is completely commanded from the Yreul\u00ed plateau about two thousand yards distant and led up to by easy bullock paths from the north by Ving and M\u00e1ndhardev or from the south from W\u00e1i. The W\u00e1i path, however, would be commanded from the fort.\n\nThe fort is said to have been built by the Kolh\u00e1pur Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra chief Bhoja II. (1178-1193) of Panh\u00e1la. About 1648 it is mentioned as being in the charge of a Bij\u00e1pur mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r stationed at W\u00e1i. In 1673 it was taken by Shiv\u00e1ji. In 1701 P\u00e1ndavgad surrendered with Chandan Vandan to Aurangzeb's officers. In 1713 during his flight from Chandrasen J\u00e1dhav the Mar\u00e1tha captain or Sen\u00e1pati, B\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed Vishvan\u00e1th afterwards the first Peshwa, being refused shelter by the Sachiv's agent at S\u00e1svad attempted to cross to P\u00e1ndavgad in the opposite valley. Closely pursued he contrived to conceal himself until two Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s Pil\u00e1j\u00ed J\u00e1dhav and Dhum\u00e1l then common cavaliers in his service, gathered a small troop of horse and carried him with great difficulty to P\u00e1ndavgad where he was protected by Sh\u00e1hu's orders. Chandrasen demanded that B\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed should be given up and in case of refusal threatened to renounce his allegiance. Sh\u00e1hu refused to give up B\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed and sent orders to Haibatr\u00e1v Nimb\u00e1lkar Sarlashkar then at Ahmadnagar to march on at once to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Meanwhile B\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed was in P\u00e1ndavgad surrounded by Chandrasen's troops. But hearing of Haibatr\u00e1v's arrival at Phaltan about forty miles east, Chandrasen quitted P\u00e1ndavgad and marched to Deur about fifteen miles to the south-east. During Trimbakji Denglia's insurrection in 1817 P\u00e1ndavgad was taken by the insurgents. It surrendered in April 1818 to a detachment of the 9th Native Infantry Regiment under Major Thatcher.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 62.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 116.\n3 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 177.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 189-190.\n5 Bombay Courier, 18th April 1818.\nThe P\u00e1ndavgad caves are situated on a small south-east projection of P\u00e1ndavgad fort within the limits of Dh\u00e1vdi village. On taking the path to P\u00e1ndavgad and reaching the opening in the hills instead of turning up the shoulder of the hill to ascend the fort, the way to the caves goes straight on towards Dh\u00e1vdi by a well defined footpath which skirts the face of the hill. The small spur with the caves is found at about a distance of 300 yards. The angle it makes with the main spur should be made for and about 200 feet up are the caves. The first is a flat roofed chapel or chaitya about twenty-one feet by seven and about twelve to fourteen feet high. An arched entrance blocked up with mud and stones leads to a relic shrine or d\u00e1gghoba four and a half feet in diameter and six feet high. Its capital is lost. Close by is another cave seven feet square, also flat roofed with an arched entrance and containing a mutilated stone instead of the d\u00e1gghoba and locally said to be a ling. It looks more like a d\u00e1gghoba, being fully three feet in diameter at the base and scarcely a foot at the top. East of Cave II. is an eight-celled dwelling cave or vih\u00e1r about thirty-five feet square and five feet high. The floor has been much silted up with earth brought in by rain water. The original height, as seen from the outside, was probably eight feet. The roof is flat and the rock overhangs four feet making a veranda with an entrance in its back wall about eight feet wide. The cells are two each on the east and west and four on the north, and there is a bed shelf all round. Five yards to the west is a rock-cut cistern six feet deep and nine feet wide holding no water.\n\nParli or Sajjangad\u00b9 Fort, about 1045 feet above the plain and 1824 yards in circumference, lies on a detached Sahy\u00e1dri spur about six miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Inspection reports of 1850 and 1881 describe the fort as surrounded and commanded by three hills, Yavteshyar about 3500 yards to the north, Old S\u00e1t\u00e1ra about 2500 yards to the south, and N\u00e1nka within 1100 yards to the southwest. The road from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is fairly good, unmetalled after about two miles but running over rock or gravel and passable by infantry cavalry and mountain guns at all times. At about five miles the road crosses the Urmodi by a rocky ford which is rather difficult for carts and becomes unsuitable for wheeled carriages when it reaches the hill on which the fort stands. Another more difficult path leads from Parli village to the fort gates.\n\nThe only entrance to the fort is by two gateways at the southeast angle and by a partly blocked up sallyport at the south-west angle. Both the gateways are in good order strongly built of cut-stone and flanked by towers and a parapet along the rock. The lower gateway which is partly under the rock is completely hidden from the approach and commanded by the upper gateway.\n\nThe defences consist of a scarp of perpendicular black rock varying in height from about 100 feet along the faces to about\n\n\u00b9 The name Sajjangad that is the fort of good men or sajjan is locally said to be derived from the number of good men who visited it after it became the residence of R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi the spiritual adviser of Shiv\u00e1ji.\nfifty feet at the south-west angle of the fort. The scarp is built up in places, but, except near the gateway and at the south-west angle which appears to have been strongly fortified, little of the old parapet remains. The south-west angle is the only place practicable for an escalade as in other places the rock is too high and the hill below it too steep to allow ladders to be placed against it, while there is no cover from the fire of the fort.\n\nThe fort contains a partly ruined mosque and three temples, one of which situated about the middle of the fort and dedicated to R\u00e1m is a handsome cut-stone building capable of defence. In the village around are about thirty-five buildings of various kinds with about 200 inhabitants chiefly Br\u00e1hmans and V\u00e1nis. Just outside the gate is a small hamlet inhabited by about sixty Parv\u00e1ris. The water-supply of the fort is from ponds, of which there are several but only two hold water throughout the year. Of these two, one to the north of R\u00e1m\u2019s temple holds good water.\n\nParli village lies about 1200 yards by a path to the north of the fort. It contains about 130 houses, some of which and several temples in the neighbourhood are built of cut-stone or have thick mud walls, which, with their situation, render them capable of defence. A weekly market is held at the village on Monday at which forage and vegetables are obtainable. The water-supply of the village is from wells and from the Urmodi which flows to the north. All round the base of the hill on which the fort stands are several small hamlets, some of them consisting of not more than three or four huts. Parli was the favourite residence of R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi (1608 - 1681) the famous spiritual guide or guru of Shiv\u00e1ji (1627 - 1680) who gave it to the Sv\u00e1mi in in\u00e1m. The local tradition is that if Shiv\u00e1ji in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra required counsel from R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi, R\u00e1md\u00e1s reached S\u00e1t\u00e1ra through the air in a single stride. The temple of R\u00e1md\u00e1s is in the middle of the village surrounded by the dwellings of his disciples. The temple of basalt with a brick and mortar dome was built by Ak\u00e1b\u00e1i and Div\u00e1k\u00e1r Gos\u00e1vi, two disciples of the Sv\u00e1mi. It was repaired and ornamented in 1800 and 1830 by Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u of Shirgaon village eight miles south-east of W\u00e1i. The spire is in octagonal tiers and about seventy feet high with handsome stucco decoration. The veranda was built by one Vajn\u00e1th Bh\u00e1gvat of Yavteshvar. A yearly fair attended by about 6000 people is held in February.\n\nOn the north-west of Parli village about a few yards outside are two old Hem\u00e1dpanti temples facing east. The southern temple now deserted looks like the older of the two; and some of its best carvings have been transferred to the northern temple. It is about forty by twenty feet, including the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra or shrine which is of the old star shape. Of the shrine the walls alone remain. They are about six feet high and built of enormous blocks of unmortared stone. The shrine has a pyramidal roof of huge slabs diminishing in size from the bottom upwards. The shrine portal is most beautifully carved in relief in a pattern similar to the carving of the balustrade and pillars in the northern temple.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 See below p. 538.\nThe northern temple of about the same size as the southern temple is complete, but the immense stones show signs of falling. The hall or mandap is about twenty-four feet square with four rows of four pillars each, seven feet apart, supporting with brackets a flat roof ten feet high. The central one over the round slab in which the Nandi is placed has a canopied top. Each of the other compartments formed by four pillars has a ceiling of the lozenge pattern. Outside in an unenclosed court is the Nandi canopy. The pillars supporting it are specially rich, the carving pattern differing in each. Its ceiling is domed and about the same height as the rest of the temple. It is well paved and elaborately carved, every available bit of space being filled with decorative moulding of some kind. A small vestibule also beautifully worked leads to the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra or shrine which is square inside but star-shaped outside. The sides are walled in at an early but comparatively modern time with mortared stone. At the entrance is a balustrade very elaborately carved. The pillars in the mandap are plainer than is usual in the oldest Hem\u00e1dpanti temples. Some are giving way and rude props have been erected between them. Slabs belonging to the broad eaves of the old temple roof have been used to make a pedestal for a lamp-stand. The balustrade and Nandi canopy probably belong to the northern temple, the rest is very likely a building of Shiv\u00e1ji's time or perhaps even later after the Moghals took Parli (1700). It is not known who first desecrated the old shrine, but either the Bij\u00e1pur Musalm\u00e1ns or the Moghals must have done so, and the new temple was a feeble copy of the old raised after their departure. To the north of the entrance is a tablet bearing a very indistinct inscription. Fifty yards north of these temples is a pond about forty yards square and ten feet deep. It is of the old pattern, the lower stones projecting beyond the upper ones. The existence of these two old temples and ponds makes it probable that Parli fort was in existence before Musalm\u00e1n times. It was subsequently occupied by them and surprised by a detachment of Shiv\u00e1ji's M\u00e1valis in May 1673.\u00b9 A few days before his death in 1681 R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi addressed from Parli a judicious letter to Sambh\u00e1ji, advising him for the future rather than upbraiding him for the past and pointing out the example of his father yet carefully abstaining from personal comparison.\u00b2 In 1699, when the Moghals were besieging S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Parshur\u00e1m Trimbak Pratinidhi prolonged the siege by furnishing supplies from Parli. After the capture of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in April 1700 the Moghal army besieged Parli. The siege lasted till the beginning of June, when, after a good defence of a month and a half, the garrison evacuated. Aurangzeb called the fort Naurast\u00e1ra.\u00b3 In a revenue statement of about 1790 Peraly appears as the head-quarters of a pargana in the Nahisdurg sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a32250 (Rs. 22,500).\u2074 In 1818 Parli was taken by a British regiment, and a detachment of native infantry under a native officer was kept here.

It was found that the ex-R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh's agent Rango B\u00e1puji had been living for six weeks in Parli, and that he had gathered the gang to act with the bad assembled in Bhor territory and with armed men hid in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nPa'r Pa'r or P\u00e1r proper and Peth P\u00e1r or the market of P\u00e1r are two villages five miles west of Malcolmtpeth and immediately south of Prat\u00e1pgad. They give their name to and mark the old route into the Konkan called the P\u00e1r pass which goes straight over the hill below Bombay Point and winds at a very steep incline with so many curves that it was named by the British the Corkscrew pass. Passing through the two P\u00e1rs the further line of the Sahy\u00e1dris is descended by an equally steep path to the village of P\u00e1rgh\u00e1t in the Kol\u00e1ba district. This route was maintained practicable for cattle and the guns of the period from very early times and had chauk\u00eds or toll stations for transit duties and defence at various points. The rulers of J\u00e1lvi and Shiv\u00e1ji who generally resided at Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ba must have used this route. B\u00e1ji Sh\u00e1mr\u00e1j, sent by the Bij\u00e1pur government to seize Shiv\u00e1ji, lurked about this pass till he was surprised at its foot and driven in panic to seek safety in the forest. In 1659 P\u00e1r village was the scene of an interview between Shiv\u00e1ji and Gopin\u00e1thpant sent by Afzulkh\u00e1n to stipulate with him. Afzul-kh\u00e1n brought his forces by the same P\u00e1r pass route to the famous interview at Prat\u00e1pgad where he was murdered by Shiv\u00e1ji. In 1796 N\u00e1na Phadnavis fled down this pass to Mah\u00e1d and took measures for his safety by blocking it and throwing a strong garrison into Prat\u00e1pgad. Until the building of the Kumbh\u00e1rli road in 1864 and the Fitzgerald pass road in 1876 the P\u00e1r pass was the only highway leading into the Konkan. The line now taken by the Fitzgerald pass gives a splendid view of Elphinstone Point and Arthur's Seat, cliffs which the P\u00e1r pass misses. But the abrupt descent from P\u00e1r westwards is very fine.\n\nPa'tan, 17\u00b0 22' north latitude and 73\u00b0 38' east longitude, on the Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rli road at the junction of the Koyna and Kera rivers about twenty-five miles south-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is a subdivisional head-quarters, with in 1881 a population of 3548. The town consists of two parts the upper town containing the sub-divisional and post offices, a school, a market, and the mansion of the in\u00e1md\u00e1r N\u00e1g\u00f3jir\u00e1v P\u00e1tankar a second class Sard\u00e1r and honorary magistrate with civil jurisdiction in his own villages. The other part consists of a beautifully wooded suburb called R\u00e1m\u00e1pur on the left bank of the Koyna. A specially fine grove of mango and jack trees lies at its south-east corner. A broad market street and a number of artisans' and traders' shops complete the village. The P\u00e1tankar family was originally in two branches, of which the elder branch alone has flourished. The younger branch represented by Hanmantr\u00e1v\n\n---\n\n1 See above pp. 316-317.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 65-66.\n3 Details are given above, p. 235.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 76, 77.\n5 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 525.\nnow living was located in R\u00e1m\u00e1pur. His mansion a fine large house was completely destroyed by fire in 1874. The sub-divisional office built on a knoll after the standard model has a square courtanda massive arched gateway with rooms over it in which the subordinate Civil Court lately instituted under the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act is held. The houses of the Br\u00e1hmans and better classes are down below near the Ker\u00e1. Several of them are substantial but exceedingly damp. On a hill immediately adjoining the subdivisional office and about one hundred yards to the south is the dispensary an excellent stone building. The dispensary was established in 1873 and in 1883 treated ten in-patients and 4362 out-patients at a cost of \u00a3163 (Rs.1630). Next to it on the south is the mansion of N\u00e1g\u00f3jir\u00e1v with strong high stone walls and ramparts and a gateway flanked by bastions. A rose and plantain garden has been made close to it by the in\u00e1md\u00e1r. A market is held here in the town proper every Monday and numerously attended from the hill villages. Blacksmiths wheelwrights and bullock farriers come in considerable numbers during the carting season. There are no special traders at P\u00e1tan, but there are several considerable moneylenders who deal with the cultivators almost entirely in grain. Rice goes from P\u00e1tan and T\u00e1rla ten miles to the north-east to Kar\u00e1d and Chiplun and from Chiplun are brought salt cocoanuts and groceries. The water-supply is taken from both the Kera and Koyna rivers. The Koyna is muddy being polluted by the thousands of cart drivers and bullocks of the carts which throng the camping ground, some eight hundred passing every night during the busy season. There are two wells sunk in the Kera which give fair water to the better quarters of the town proper. The main street of the town is kept clean, but the bye-lanes are very dirty. The P\u00e1tankars were the Deshmukhs under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of the whole surrounding district and had charge of D\u00e1tegad fort three miles to the north-west. During the struggles between the Peshw\u00e1s and the Pratinidhis they did pretty much what they pleased. The elder branch is one of the few prosperous Mar\u00e1tha families in the district; all the younger branches are sunk in debt. There is no historical mention of P\u00e1tan. But title deeds show that the Bij\u00e1pur kings had a well established rule here. The district was assigned to the Pratinidhi by R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja but was wrested from him by the Peshwa after the rebellion of Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev Mut\u00e1l\u00edk in 1750. It was not finally secured to the Peshwa till the time of Gokhale and throughout the eighteenth century both authorities would issue contradictory orders, the carrying out of which rested very much on the will of the P\u00e1tankars alone. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices P\u00e1tan as a market town with 350 houses and twenty-five shops.\n\nP\u00e1'teshvar, a peaked hill rising above the rest of the range about seven miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, has on its north-west face close to the junction of the villages of Degaon Nigdi and Bharatgaon and within the limits of Degaon a series of cave temples. The easiest way for a visit-on foot or horseback is to take the track to Degaon\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 271.  \n2 Itinerary, 63.\nwhich branches from the tank in the village of Godoli south and east of the cantonment. From Degaon a path strikes to the southeast and winds up to a khind or gorge from which by steps in places it proceeds at a very gentle incline for about three quarters of a mile along the hill side till the temples are reached. Another way is to drive to Bharatgaon on the Kolhapur road whence a two-mile walk leads to the khind by the south side. Halfway up the path the steps on the right lead to a large image of Ganpati coloured red. At the end of the path is a hollow in which is a masonry pond measuring fifty-five feet by eighty with steps leading down to it from the middle of the north side. The hill slope runs close down to it at the north-west corner in which is a small cave ten feet square much choked up and containing a small image called the Margal Mhas of a lying buffalo with a ling on its back. To the east of the pond are some houses and a math belonging to the resident Gos\u00e1vi. From the south-east end of the pond a series of thirty-five low steps lead up a slight incline to a temple of Mah\u00e1dev. The temple stands in a courtyard one hundred and thirty-five feet east to west by sixty-five north to south, partly if not entirely cut out of the hill side to a depth of ten feet. The entrance is on the north from the steps above mentioned and is flanked by four chambers each ten feet square. The chambers next the doorway are empty and the further ones contain images, the east chamber of the god Rodkoba and the west chamber of the man-eagle Garud. The doorway is a small pointed arch about six feet by three. Immediately opposite the doorway is the Nandi canopy, ten feet square and twenty-seven high, facing the temple which fronts east. The latter is a modest structure, forty-eight feet long, consisting of an image-chamber and a hall. The hall is twenty-six broad and the shrine eighteen feet broad, the sides of the mandap projecting about five feet on each side beyond those of the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra or shrine. The front is a plain balustrade about five feet high and six feet broad, on each side of a three feet passage for entrance. The walls on each side are 5' 6\" thick. The roof is of the lozenge pattern and supported by four pillars in the centre, a plain imitation of the Hem\u00e1dpanti style. The whole is raised on a plinth three feet high. The wall to the roof is thirteen feet high with a three feet parapet. Over the image-chamber is the octagonal spire or shikhar of brick and stucco thirty-eight feet from the roof, and with a total height of fifty-four feet from the ground. The image-chamber ten feet square is entered by a low doorway with a stone tortoise in front. In the centre is the ling of P\u00e1teshvar. Behind in the west wall are images of P\u00e1rvati and a goddess, and at the north-east corner is the water drain. In the centre of the north side are images of Ganpati and D\u00e1sm\u00e1ruti both facing south, and on the south side facing north are images of J\u00e1t\u00e1shankar and Sheshsh\u00e1yi or Vishnu reclining upon the serpent Shesh. On either side of the east end of the temple are small shrines of an eight-handed Devi on the south and of Bhairav on the north. Behind the Nandi shrine to the north-east is the tulsi or basil platform and to the east two temples\n\n1 Compare Fergusson and Burgess\u2019 Cave Temples, 427.\neach eighteen feet high. The whole temple and courtyard is of good stone work but all modern, the work of Parshur\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Angal the great banker and temple-builder who lived in the time of Sh\u00e1hu (1708-1749). In this group the only object of any age would seem to be the Margal Mhas cave. Passing about a hundred yards east four caves are reached all about ten feet square and facing about north-west. They have flat roofs about ten feet high and no signs of building in them. A number of lings are scattered about without any order. A little east of these is a small modern temple of Balibhadra or Agni with a curious image of which the body from the neck back is a bull, tail and all. The face from the mouth upwards is human, the chin that of a bull. It has four horns growing out of the head, four hands on the right and three on the left, and three legs, two of a man and one of a bull. This image is typical of Agni or the god of fire who is represented in the Sh\u00e1stras as having three legs, seven hands, two mouths, and four horns. On an oblong stone near the image are some well carved figures in relief of men and women. Next to Agni\u2019s temple on the east is a temple of Satv\u00e1i Devi containing two small images of goddesses. Both the temples are modern. Five hundred paces east is a curious cave or group of caves known as the Var\u00fadghar. The southern side has a shrine about ten feet square. In the three sides are arched niches prettily sculptured with bead decorations. The southern niche contains a ling three feet high. The eastern niche has some figures of Rishis, and in the western niche is a long shaped stone with eight figures in relief though what the figures represent cannot be made out. Two pillars support the roof, one with a club figured on it in relief, the other with some indistinct letters of which va sa and ha can be made out. The part which opens west contains only a ling. Much of the original cave remains. It is about thirty-five feet deep, but too dark and impenetrable for taking exact measurements. A little to the east of this group is a small pond known as the Bhim Kund. The caves are plain flat-roofed cells without benches and originally without pillars. All the building here is done by Angal, the only remaining representative of whose family is Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m the great-great-grandson of Parshur\u00e1m and aged ninety.\n\nPeth, 17\u00b0 3' north latitude and 74\u00b0 17' east longitude, about forty-five miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is the head-quarters of the V\u00e1lva sub-division, with in 1872 a population of 4971 and in 1881 of 5672. The town lies close to the junction of the provincial Poona-Kolh\u00e1pur and local fund Peth-S\u00e1ngli roads, and besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices has a post office. The 1872 census showed 4799 Hindus and 172 Musalm\u00e1ns, and the 1881 census 5433 Hindus and 239 Musalm\u00e1ns. There was a municipality under the old Act which was abolished in 1872-73. As its name indicates the town is one of the local trade centres, the chief articles of trade being grain and cattle. The chief traders are well-to-do Gujars who deal chiefly in raw sugar and tobacco, which they buy from the cultivators and export through Chiplun in Ratn\u00e1giri.\n\n---\n\n1 See above p. 511 note 1.\nA yearly fair attended by about 5000 people is held in the village in February. The fair is chiefly noteworthy in the eyes of the people for the yearly occurrence of a miracle, the breaking of an iron chain by an aged M\u00e1ng who is endowed with the necessary strength by the spirit of the deity which enters into him after much loud supplication. The performance of the miracle, however, is but poor. The chain is very old and rusty and is fastened to a ring in the pavement of the courtyard. A decrepit M\u00e1ng advances to the gate of the courtyard surrounded by others of his caste who sing or rather yell an invocation to the god. The old M\u00e1ng tugs at the chain banging it down on a sharp stone till it is worn through. The demeanour of the crowd hardly betrays the smallest belief in the miraculous nature of the performance which falls far below the level of the commonest juggling.\n\n**Pimpoda Budrukh**, a small village about sixteen miles north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and sixteen miles east of W\u00e1i, was in 1830 the scene of the death of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Pov\u00e1r a cultivator who at the age of nine became famous by his art in catching venomous snakes. It was given out that he was an incarnation of the deity N\u00e1r\u00e1yan who was to rid the country of the English. Thousands flocked to see the new deity. The sick came to be healed and prophecies were found out about him. After six months the boy died of the bite of a serpent. He was expected to rise again, and besides in the Deccan the belief caused much excitement both in Bombay and Kol\u00e1ba and Ratn\u00e1giri.\u00b9\n\n**Pingli**, a village of 661 people, lies four miles south-west of Dahivadi at the junction of the Puses\u00e1vli-Shingn\u00e1pur and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur roads, while from the former the T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u00e1la road branches off a mile north. Pingli is the site of an irrigation pond on a small feeder of the M\u00e1n three miles above the head works of the Gondoli canal. About half a mile from the village along the Shingn\u00e1pur road is a very fair camp. A little snipe and duck shooting is to be had and rock grouse are abundant.\n\n**Prachitgad** in V\u00e1lva, about forty miles north-west of Peth, is a hill fort projecting westwards from the edge of the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dris with the Konkan on three of its sides and joined to the Deccan on the fourth side by a narrow strip. The fort is in a very inaccessible situation at the junction of the village of Rundhiv in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with Nairi and Shring\u00e1rpur in the Ratn\u00e1-\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Oriental Christian Spectator, I. (1830) 246-247, 279-281. The Rev. Mr. Nesbit wrote (Or. Chr. Spec. V. 185-186) of the boy's tomb in 1834: The boy is buried at the spot where he first received divine worship. His little coat is spread over the slightly elevated mound that surmounts his ashes; his shoes are placed at the lower end of it; and a piece of shining metal is put at the head to represent his face. The sticks he used to bear in his hand lie at the sides of the tomb; and thousands of toys, with which he was presented by his worshippers, are ranged at some distance behind him. Two Br\u00e1hmans and a shepherd who has turned a devotee wait upon him continually with music singing and incense burning. A regular house is built over his tomb and a shopkeeper has built another close by where he disposes of such articles as may be required by those who come to make offerings or fulfil vows to the deceased god. Compare Jour. Roy. As. Soc. VII. (Old Series) 109-112.\ngiri district. The paths to the fort pass over the crest of the Sahy\u00e1dris through thick forest or over sheet rock and unite at a point about a mile from the fort. It is about four miles either from Rundhiv or J\u00e1vli the nearest villages. J\u00e1vli is four miles from Peth Lond the favourite halting place on the east side of the south Tivra pass which there joins the V\u00e1sna valley track. The path to J\u00e1vli runs north-west from Peth Lond and seems to have been the one most used in former days. Rundhiv is four miles south-east of Mala\u00b9 the village at the top of the Mala pass. From the junction of the two paths it is about a mile to the edge of the Sahy\u00e1dris and from here a winding path leads on to a small neck or gorge about thirty yards long and about two hundred feet below, crossing which the gate is reached. A narrow ledge runs at the level of the gate right round the fort and at the western end communicates with a steep path leading down to the Konkan. Above this ledge is a scarp varying in height from thirty to sixty feet and crowned with towers on the east and west and a wall all round loopholed for musketry. The wall is in parts composed of enormous boulders unmortared, in others of smaller stones to which mortar has been applied. On the west is a sort of prominence fortified by a tower capable of mounting several guns. The top is undulating and in area not more than three or four acres at the outside, the extreme length being not more than two hundred and the breadth not more than one hundred yards. Under the scarp on the south side are some cave ponds filled with excellent water. On the top on the west is a large pond and one or two smaller ones with a less certain supply. There are ruins of buildings all over the fort. The head-quarters apparently were near the centre on the east side. There is nothing to show what the other buildings were. Who built Prachitgad is not known, but the character of some of its masonry points to a considerable age, perhaps anterior to the Musalm\u00e1n rule. In 1862 Prachitgad is mentioned as a dismantled and ruinous fort with ample water. It was said to have contained a garrison of 300 men but was then deserted and not garrisoned.\n\nPrachitgad was never the scene of any notable event until 1817 when it was seized by a Gos\u00e1vi named Chitursing who gave himself out to be the younger brother of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1hu. The real Chitursing was, by his gallantry, an object of much interest at the time, and being considered dangerously hostile to the Peshwa, Trimbakji Denglia seduced him to a conference and imprisoned him in the fort of K\u00e1ngori in Kol\u00e1ba where he eventually died. The pretended Chitursing however gave out that he had escaped to Prachitgad. He got possession of the fort by a daring enterprise suggested by a traditional account of Shiv\u00e1ji's exploits. From before the time of Shiv\u00e1ji it was usual for villagers to supply leaves and grass for thatching the fort houses. The insurgents having corrupted one or two persons in the garrison a party of them each loaded with a bundle of grass, with his arms concealed in it, appeared at the fort gate in\n\n\u00b9 See above Mala p. 520.\nthe dress of villagers to deposit, as they pretended, the annual supply. Admittance being thus gained they surprised the garrison and possessed themselves of the fort. From Prachitgad as his head-quarters, the pretended Chitursing plundered the surrounding country until the fort was taken by Colonel Cunningham on the 10th of June 1818. He encamped as near as the forest would permit and shortly afterwards occupied a high hill which immediately commanded the place. The commandant was sent to with a demand for surrender but without effect. Captain Spiller was admitted under a flag of truce and did all he could to induce the garrison to surrender. They promised to do so. But Colonel Cunningham, not relying on their promises, sent back during the night for one of the guns which had been brought the previous day to the top of the adjoining south Tivra pass. By the exertions of the detachment and assistance sent from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the gun was mounted by two in the morning. The commandant was warned of the consequences if the fort was not immediately surrendered. No satisfactory answer was received and the shelling began. The first two shells caused considerable alarm, but the cover was so good that the garrison could not be reached and finding this out they defied the British force. Captain Spiller then proposed to blow up the gate with musketry and Assistant Surgeon Redford volunteered to accompany him. Fifty men of the 6th Regiment and a party of the auxiliary force were then formed and advanced to the gateway on the opposite side of the tower. A heavy fire prevented the besieged suspecting what was going on at the gate. A hole was blown through the gate sufficient to admit Captain Spiller, but a grenadier stuck owing to his cartridge box. Captain Spiller returned and enlarged the hole enough to get every one through. Colonel Cunningham and Surgeon Redford had by this time joined the party. They all got through one by one and concealed themselves in the gateway till the whole party had entered. They then rushed upon the garrison who were completely surprised and fled panic-stricken in all directions. The fort was taken without the loss of a man. The enemy had five men killed and the fort subhed\u00e1r wounded, and Chitursing and family were taken prisoners.\n\nPrata'pgad Fort in J\u00e1vli, 3543 feet above sea level, twenty miles north-west of Medha and by road eight miles west of Mah\u00e1baleshvar, is built on a range which forms a spur of the Mah\u00e1baleshvar hills and separates the villages of P\u00e1r and Kineshvar commanding the road between them. The fort from a distance looks like a round-topped hill, the walls of the lower fort forming a sort of bend or crown round the brow. It can be visited with great ease from Malcolm Peth. An hour\u2019s drive down by the excellent Fitzgerald pass road brings the visitor to the pretty travellers\u2019 bungalow at V\u00e1da or Ambenali a small hamlet within the limits of Bheroshi village.

On passing the gateways the outwork of Abdulla\u2019s tower lies to the right while the path to the upper fort is on the left. The temple of Bhav\u00e1ni is on the eastern side of the lower fort. It consists of a hall and shrine, the hall with wooden pillars about 50' long 30' broad and 12' high. The shrine is of stone. It contains a black stone image of Bhav\u00e1ni with some fine clothes belonging to it. The roof of the temple is flat inside. Outside is a leaden covering put up by the S\u00e1tara Raja Prat\u00e1psinh (1818-1839) and over the shrine is a small spire or shikhar. The temple is in good repair but unattractive and only worth a visit on account of its historical associations. The western and northern sides of the fort are gigantic cliffs with an almost vertical drop in many places of seven or eight hundred feet. The towers and bastions on the south and east are often thirty to forty feet high, while there is in most places a scarp of naked black rock not much lower.\n\nIn an inspection report of 1842 Prat\u00e1pgad is described as occupying the highest point of the range with a full and commanding view of the surrounding country. The west and north sides were very steep and inaccessible, both covered with huge masses and a vast precipice of trap rock. On the east and south the hills were more sloping and covered with a dense wood in contrast with the rocky west and north, and gradually descended to the valleys separating Mah\u00e1baleshvar and the Kineshvar range on the east and the Konkan valley on the west. It consisted of two forts, an upper fort built on the crest of the hill and a lower fort immediately below on the south and east, both overlooking the surrounding country and guarding the passage to the hill on almost all sides. One approach, however, was not so strongly guarded as others, which, passing over an easy ground fit for a mortar battery, led to a tower locally known as Abdulla\u2019s tower. From the tower the ascent ran up a steep and rugged pathway along the south of the outwork and completely defended by it. The pathway led to the entrance between two strong towers through two narrow and well built gates. From the lower to the upper fort were two entrances one of them on the north-east corner. It was a mere opening without a gateway between two towers very weak but for a precipice outside. The fort walls varied in height according to the nature of the ground. The parapet wall was very slight and the rampart only three feet broad. The upper fort, built upon the crest of the hill, was 200 yards long by 200 broad and contained several permanent buildings for residence and a temple of Mah\u00e1dev. A remarkable tree stood on the highest part of the fort; from this tree and the northward was a steep and rugged descent to the wall on the north, below which was a large pond and a good stone well with never failing water. The lower fort, 350 yards long by 120 broad, was on the eastern and southern side of the hill. The southern side was rocky and precipitous, while the eastern side had a strong outwork ending in the tower above mentioned which commanded the approach to the place. The outwork was\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\nsaid to have been added by Shiv\u00e1ji after the murder of the Bij\u00e1pur general Abdulla properly Afzul, whose head is buried beneath the tower which bears his name. At the end of this outwork, where it joins the lower fort, appears to have been a gateway now destroyed. The entrance to the fort lay on the south of the outwork, but the approach to it was completely commanded by the walls of the outwork which overlooked the path the whole way up to the entrance. The entrance was well protected and very strong, the space between the towers on each side not exceeding four feet, the pathway very steep and rugged, and a double gate or doorway forming the actual entrance. The only buildings in the lower fort were a few ruined huts, some houses of Br\u00e1hmans, and a well furnished temple of Bhav\u00e1ni. There were two ponds, one east below the steep descent leading from the upper fort, the other south on a point of rock. Both contained an unfailing supply of excellent water. In 1862 Prat\u00e1pgad is noted as a strong fort with ample water-supply and provisions. It was garrisoned by ten of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra police.\n\nPrat\u00e1pgad was built in 1656 by the famous Br\u00e1hman minister More T\u00edrmal Pingle at the command of Shiv\u00e1ji, who pitched upon this high rock near the source of the Krishna, thereby securing access to his possessions on the banks of the Nira and the Koyna, and strengthening the defences of the P\u00e1r pass. In 1659 the foot of the hill was the scene of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s famous interview with the Bij\u00e1pur general Afzulkh\u00e1n and of Afzulkh\u00e1n\u2019s treacherous murder. In the rains of 1661, Shiv\u00e1ji, unable to visit the famous temple of Bhav\u00e1ni at Tulj\u00e1pur, dedicated with great solemnity a temple to Bhav\u00e1ni on Prat\u00e1pgad fort. In 1778 Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m B\u00e1pu, a famous Poon\u00e1 minister, was confined by his rival N\u00e1na Fadnavis in Prat\u00e1pgad and from here secretly removed from fort to fort until he perished miserably in R\u00e1ygad. In 1796 N\u00e1na Fadnavis, flying from the intrigues of Daulatr\u00e1v Sindia and his minister B\u00e1loba to W\u00e1i and the Konkan, threw a strong garrison into Prat\u00e1pgad and went to Mah\u00e1d. In the Mar\u00e1tha war of 1818 Prat\u00e1pgad surrendered by private negotiation, though it was an important stronghold, had a large garrison, and could much annoy the country round W\u00e1i.\n\nPuses\u00e1vli in Khat\u00e1v, twelve miles south-west of Vaduj, is a municipal town, with in 1872 a population of 2456 and in 1881 of 2569. The municipality was established in 1854 and had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) and an expenditure of \u00a3101 (Rs. 1010). Besides the municipality Puses\u00e1vli has a dispensary, a Collector\u2019s bungalow, a post office, and a weekly market on Wednesday. The dispensary was founded in 1871, and in 1883 treated ten in-patients.\n\n---\n\n1 Government Lists of Civil Forts (1862).\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 67.\n3 Details of the interview and murder are given above pp. 234-237.\n4 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 83.\n5 It is a suggestive irony of fate that Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m B\u00e1pu, a descendant of Gopin\u00e1th-pant Bokil, who decoyed his master Afzulkh\u00e1n to the treacherous interview and murder in 1659 should, 120 years after this event, have to look down, with the tremendous abyss of 4000 feet of black rugged rock on his west, on the eastern side where his ancestor Gopin\u00e1th-pant pledged to Shiv\u00e1ji the treacherous oath which betrayed his master to the stab of the murderer.

Puses\u00e1vli is a small trade centre with about 120 traders, mostly Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar\u00e1t and local V\u00e1nis, Telis, and Kosht\u00eds. In 1818, while pursuing B\u00e9jir\u00e1v, General Smith\u2019s division reached Puses\u00e1vli on the 27th of January.\u00b9\n\nIn 1827 Captain Clunes notices it as a kasba or market town with 380 houses, twenty shops, and wells.\u00b2\n\nRahimatpur in Koregaon, 17\u00b0 35\u2019 north latitude and 74\u00b0 17\u2019 east longitude, is a municipal town of 6082 people on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road, seventeen miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, seven miles south of Koregaon, and about three miles beyond the flying bridge on the Krishna at Dh\u00e1mner. Besides the municipality Rahimatpur has a sub-judge\u2019s court and a post office. The 1872 census showed a total population of 7168 of whom 6678 were Hindus and 490 Musalm\u00e1ns. The 1881 census showed a fall of 1086 or 6082 of whom 5590 were Hindus and 492 Musalm\u00e1ns. The municipality was established in 1853 and had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3649 (Rs. 6490) and an expenditure of \u00a3704 (Rs. 7040). A weekly market is held on Thursday and Friday. Rahimatpur is a pretty large trade centre with about 155 well-to-do traders chiefly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, Shimpis, Sangars, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, Jains, Kosht\u00eds, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Of these traders the Br\u00e1hmans are generally moneylenders. Bombay and English piece-goods twist and silk are brought by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis from Poona and Bombay; the V\u00e1nis Jains and Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis buy from the growers raw sugar, turmeric, earthnuts, and coriander seed, send them in bullock carts to the ports of Chiplun, R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, and Mah\u00e1d, and bring from those ports salt, cocoanuts, dates, and spices. The Musalm\u00e1ns Sangars and Kosht\u00eds buy twist from the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis which the Musalm\u00e1ns weave into turbans and the Sangars and Kosht\u00eds into waistcloths, women\u2019s robes or lugdis, cotton sheets or p\u00e1sod\u00eds, and other hand-made piece-goods. There are three schools, one of them Hindustani. The chief object of interest in the town is a mosque and mausoleum, which, with the name, show that Rahimatpur was a head-quarter town under Muham-madan rule. The mosque is about forty feet long by twenty feet broad and opens to the east. The inner roof is divided into six vaulted divisions made by two lines of Saracenic arches running from north to south and two from east to west. There is a good deal of ornamental work about the arches and walls. The shafts of the pillars supporting the arches are in a single rectangular course. The roof above is flat with a small parapet and projecting eaves supported by brackets at intervals. East of this is a raised stone platform forty-five feet square and three feet high with a projecting margin, and in the centre a pipe for a fountain. To the east of this again is a domed mausoleum about thirty feet square. The usual tomb inside the spring of the dome is about twenty feet off the ground and the whole about forty feet high. In the centre of each side is a small door about two feet by five broad. The mausoleum seems to have been built in honour of Randull\u00e1khn\u00e1n, a distinguished Bij\u00e1pur officer who flourished in the reign of the seventh Bij\u00e1pur king M\u00e1hmud (1626-1656). He\n\n\u00b9 Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha War Papers, 200, 209. \u00b2 Itinerary, 32, 62.\ndied about 1650 (H. 1053 or 1059). The mosque has four inscriptions one on each side. The east side inscription runs:\n\nOn the death of Randulla'kha'n Sa'hib Baha'dur he went to heaven on account of his merits. He was reckoned as one of the brave in the world. He died while speaking. The date of his death is 1053. Nothing like this ever happened. There was a saying in heaven that this man was one of the lords of the world. He obtained a place in the heaven of heavens near the gods. This is a wonderful occurrence.\n\nThe west side inscription runs:\n\nThis Randulla'kha'n was highly praised by people for his good acts, and because he assisted the kings' throne he was given the rank of minister. This chief got the victory over many forts strong and fine in appearance. He was charitable, kind, strong, and at the same time learned; thus this man was known throughout his life for these qualities and his fame was spread throughout the world. This famous Vazir died with all his pomp, in the year 1059.\n\nThe north side inscription runs:\n\nThis is the wonderful 'Ghumat' of the holy Randulla'kha'n which is famous throughout the world. The air of this Ghumat is excellent like heaven, and the Ghumat being wide looks beautiful. The chief friendly to Randulla'kha'n, ordered this inscription to be written. While they were writing there was a word from God. There is no Ghumat like this Ghumat. Randulla'kha'n Sa'hib whose body was like the sun, rested peacefully in this Ghumat in 1059.\n\nThe south side inscription runs:\n\nBy the grace of God this man was blessed in his life as he was in a former state of existence. His body was handsome. He became victorious in every war and was very skilful in assaults and battles. Being inventive he had need of no one. He confided in no one and did every thing for himself. He conquered every famous place. He was the most valorous in the world this Randulla'kha'n Sa'hib.\n\nAbout a hundred yards south-east of the mosque, on the south of the road, is a tower about fifty feet high with a slope bending down to the ground on the west. This is an elephant water-lift which supplied power for the mosque fountain. At Brahmapuri on the Krishna, three miles south-west of the town, is a Hindu temple of Vithoba, in whose honor a yearly fair lasting for a month is held in M\u0101rgshirsh or November-December and is attended by about 8000 people. The cultivators in the neighbourhood of Rahimatpur are considered to be some of the most prosperous in the district, the burden of debt and land assessment being unusually light. In April 1791 Major Price notices Rahimatpur as a considerable town marked by a mosque with a swelling dome. While pursuing Bajirav General Smith reached Rahimatpur on the 6th of February 1818 and here he was joined on the 7th by General Pritzler and the combined force went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1827 Captain Clunes describes Rahimatpur as a market town belonging to the Patvardhans with 500 houses, 110 shops, a water-course, and wells.\n\nRen\u00e1vi, about five miles east of Vita, is a small village on the east of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur plateau. It is celebrated for an old temple of Revan Siddh a local saint said to have been under the special favour of the god Datt\u00e1traya and a great favourite with the Ling\u00e1yats. Among other fabulous exploits he is related,\n\n---\n\n1 Memoirs of a Field Officer, 260.\n2 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 659; Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha War Papers, 213.\n3 Itinerary, 32.\nwhen staying at the house of a Br\u00e1hman in Vita who had lost his seven children, to have ordered the wife to cut the last child into seven pieces from which he created seven new children. He is said to have attained immortality and is believed still to hover about the locality. The temple consists of an image-chamber with a mandap, all walled in but without a spire, the whole about thirty feet by thirty. It is a conspicuous object on the south side of the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road as soon as the plateau is reached. A yearly fair attended by about 500 people is held at the temple in February.\n\nR\u00e1jpuri Caves.\n\nRa'jpuri\u00b9 in J\u00e1vli has a group of caves, situated, as the crow flies, about five miles south-west of W\u00e1i and about midway between B\u00e1rdhan and P\u00e1nchgani. The caves which are almost wholly natural, are formed by the removal of the soft material below the rock scarp of the hill. The hard rock has also here and there been worked away to improve appearance and shape. The excavations form one whole although there are four or five separate entrances. They face nearly due east and are picturesquely situated about 100 feet below the little village of R\u00e1jpuri and about 4000 feet above sea level. The scarp is about fifty feet high, forms the corner of a small ravine, and slightly overhangs the entrance to the caves. From above some fine creepers hang gracefully, below the ground shelves steeply away and is studded with some fine mango trees, one or two ch\u00e1mph\u00e1s, and a j\u00e1mbhul. The most northerly entrance leads into a cave temple dedicated to K\u00e1rtiksv\u00e1mi. The cave is small in size, but penetrates deep into the hillside at its north-west corner. From this cave it is possible to gain access to all the others without again going outside, but the communication between the fourth and fifth caves is by a mere hole through which it is possible to creep only with difficulty. These four caves are full of carved stones, some in good preservation and some much worn with age. Sit\u00e1b\u00e1i's arm, with the pustule on the palm of the hand, figures conspicuously on several of these stones. The fifth cave is the most curious of all. Almost the whole area is occupied by a couple of small ponds cut in the solid rock, each about eight feet square and three or four feet deep. Beyond these, in the innermost recess, is the figure of Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i to whom the cave is dedicated. The ponds are filled by a spring which issues beyond the caves to the south and is introduced by a small channel into the southern corner of the southernmost cave. It is then led into the back of the figure of a bull and passing through the animal's body it issues in a strong stream from its mouth. The figure is of stone, but has been carved elsewhere and merely placed in its present situation. Outside, in front of the caves, is a figure of the bull or Nandi under a canopy. Beneath its mouth is the figure of a man represented as feeding it with oil-cake. Resting against the outer wall of the caves is a stone tablet bearing an inscription in old indistinct characters apparently Mar\u00e1thi. Towards the northern extremity the mouth of the caves has been built up to support the rock above which threatens to fall in. A fair, chiefly attended by Br\u00e1hmans, is held at the cave every third year in K\u00e1rtik or October-November. A Gurav living in R\u00e1jpuri looks after the caves.\n\n\u00b9 Mr. H. R. Cooke, C.S.\nSada'shivgad, four miles north-east of Kar\u00e1d, is one of the chain forts built by Shiv\u00e1ji. Its defences consist of a low scarp of black rock with some light walls originally nine feet high now nearly in ruins. The ascent is by a very steep little frequented path from the north from a hamlet on the south of the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road. The top is about twenty-three acres in extent and uninhabited. On the north side is a high gateway fallen into a well and there were four high bastions which fell fifty years ago. The fort has also some ponds dug on the soil but not built in with masonry and some cave ponds all empty. On the hill top is a small temple of Mah\u00e1dev at which a fair is held on the dark fourteenth of M\u00e1gh or February-March. In 1862 Sad\u00e1shivgad is noted as a dismantled and ruinous fort. It had no garrison and had no water or supplies.\n\nSangam M\u00e1luli. See M\u00e1huli.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra, north latitude 17\u00b0 31' and east longitude 74\u00b0 3', so called from the seventeen or satara walls towers and gates which the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort was supposed to possess, is the head-quarters of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district and sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 29,028. With a height of 2320 feet above sea level, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is about sixty miles from the coast, sixty-nine miles south of Poona, and seventy-six miles north of Kolh\u00e1pur. The 1881 census showed that S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is the twelfth city in the Bombay Presidency with a town site of 526 acres and a population of 29,028 or fifty-five to the square acre. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town is bounded on the north by the new Poona-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road, on the west by the Yavteshvar hill, on the south by the fort, and on the east by an offshoot of the fort hill. Its greatest length from east to west is about two miles and from north to south about one and a half miles. Seen from a distance of nearly three miles on the new Poona-S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road, the town is situated at the base of the fort, and in a semicircular recess on the south-western border of the valley formed by the fort and the Yavteshvar hill. It is built on the slope below a range of hills which form the end of a spur running down from the Sahy\u00e1dris near the hill station of Mah\u00e1baleshvar which is twenty-nine miles to the north-west. This high situation has given a great advantage in health since all drainage goes to the Yenna on the north by means of many small brooks rising from the hills on its three sides. The tableland, which stretches along the summit of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills as far as Mah\u00e1baleshvar, varies very much in width; at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra it ends in a rock the highest peak of which is about 1500 feet above the town. Close under the peak is the small but sacred temple of Yavteshvar. From the peak the range slopes rapidly down to the south-west corner of the town where it has been tunnelled to form a roadway. Continuing its course to the south-east it rises again 900 feet above the plain and forms the steep flat-topped hill known as Manglai Devi or the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort. This dominates the south of the town. A bold spur jutting northward from Yavteshvar and a small shoulder\n\n---\n\n1 Government List of Civil Forts (1862).\n2 This account has been mainly contributed by Mr. C. W. Richardson, Huzur Deputy Collector, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\nprojecting similarly from the fort form partial enclosures on the east west and south. The best view of the town and neighbourhood is from the fort. Immediately below, the town is seen well wooded and partly sheltered on the north-west by a spur of the Yavteshvar range and completely so on the west and south by the connecting saddle-backed ridge and the fort. The different spurs running from the Sahyadris in a south-easterly direction stand out like giant buttresses enclosing between them rich valleys along the centre of which rivers, fed by the springs along the high land and by the rain falling on the neighbouring hills, run a rapid course and are discharged into the Krishna. On the north-east, at a distance of about twelve or fifteen miles, is a spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range of hills among which the hill forts of Chandan Vandan (3841) and Nandgiri (3537) stand out conspicuously; whilst the huge hill of Jaranda, sacred to Hanum\u00e1n, is seen raising its vast crest, about seven miles to the east of the town.\n\nA visitor from Poona will probably enter the municipal limits by the village of Karanja. He may note just west of that village, north of the road, the small pillar which marks the site of Aurangzeb\u2019s encampment in 1700. Passing the race course on the right, and leaving the main road a mile further on, he will continue his course to the travellers\u2019 bungalow. Thence meeting the old Poona road he will start due south up the hill, till he again joins the mail road at the post office, passing the treasury and head-quarter offices on his right. From the post office he will have choice of two roads for entering the town. Taking the lower which runs due west he will pass between the jail on the left and the Police head-quarters on the right. A quarter of a mile further are the livestock and grain markets in an open space on the left and the vegetable and meat markets on the right. The street here turns south-west and meets the main thoroughfare of the city in the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth. Turning again west, of the sixty yards, passing between the city post office and the chief constable\u2019s office, he will find himself in a square. The western side is lined with the old and new palaces of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s Pr\u00e1t\u00e1psinh and \u00c1pa S\u00e1heb, now the High School and District Judge\u2019s Court. Its south-west corner contains the stables of the R\u00e1ja, and the north-west the road leading to the Jalmandir or water pavilion. Having seen these he will return to the square, and, taking the road past the south wall of the High School, will pass Shupakar\u2019s Tank, and continuing west out of the city to the storage reservoirs. Returning again to the square and driving east he will go by the main thoroughfare past the Civil Hospital and the principal mosque of Amina Naikin and meet the upper road which started from the post office junction. Turning up this to the right he will pass successively the Rangmah\u00e1l or private palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the old Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da or public offices on the left, the M\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s offices down a small street to the right and the Sachiv\u2019s and Daflekar\u2019s mansions. Passing this road, and keeping to the left, he will reach the tunnel by driving through which a fine view is obtained of Parli and the Urmodi valley. In this manner most of the objects of interest will have been passed. The southern part of the town is most of it on a slope, some of it rather steep being the lower\ndeclivities of the fort hill. The centre of the town is fairly level and remarkably well wooded, but a good deal cut up by the streamlets which run through it. The chief stream is the Krishneshvar which runs from Yavteshvar and the headsprings of which form the mainstay of the present water-supply. The main street is a broad thoroughfare while the lower road is also wide. But the buildings in both are of small pretensions and there is little either picturesque or attractive in the streets, apart from the people and shops which impart plenty of life and variety. The square containing the old and new palaces is fairly large and the effect of the large buildings on its west is not unimposing though it is disfigured by the mean buildings on the eastern side. Altogether the town, though pleasing when viewed from the fort and beautifully situated, hardly gains on acquaintance with the interior.\n\nThe climate of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is one of the best in Western India and is said to be particularly good for Europeans. The hot season generally sets in about the beginning of March. Its beginning is sometimes sudden and well marked, but more frequently gradual; and the heat of the weather increases pretty steadily during the month. The indoor thermometer reaches considerable elevation at an early period of the day not beginning to decline until eight in the evening. In ordinary years the heat reaches its maximum in April. In the early part of May the temperature somewhat declines; and after the middle of the month, westerly winds become more prevalent, and the air is cooled by the clouds which then begin to form on the neighbouring mountains. Throughout the hot season the early mornings are calm and serene and the air is cool and pleasant until about seven. After eight in the morning the heat rapidly increases. The early part of the day is generally still, or there is a light air veering from east to north. The exceptions to this generally occur in March, particularly about the period of the equinox (21st March), at which time a high hot land wind occasionally blows throughout the day. Soon after midday a strong westerly breeze sets in with a sudden gust, and continues to blow during the remainder of the day. This constitutes the hot wind of this part of the Deccan. It begins during March, between twelve and two at noon, and generally by midday in April and the first half of May, after which it is usually the prevailing wind throughout the twenty-four hours. It blows with considerable strength, and is hot, dry, and disagreeable until sunset, when it becomes milder and less gusty, and towards dusk it gradually gets soft, cool, and refreshing. When it does not set in, till after two, it generally continues warm and unpleasant until late in the evening. In the early part of May it rarely retains its warmth beyond five in the evening, after which hour it is comparatively pleasant, and in the latter half of the month it gains a pleasant degree of wetness and an invigorating freshness, in its passages through the mists, fogs, and clouds which at that time gather on the summits of the Sahy\u00e1dris. In the early part of the season the westerly wind usually blows till eight or nine in the evening when it shifts to the northward, and is occasionally followed by a close night; but during April and May the sea breeze generally blows with greater or less strength until morning and thereby ensures cool nights. April is both thermometrically and to\nthe feelings the hottest month, March is thermometrically the coolest, but the climate of May is more pleasant to the feelings than either of the other two months. Two or three heavy thunder-showers from the eastward generally fall towards the end of May and occasionally one or two showers in April. Though always preceded by a close atmosphere, these showers are generally followed by a considerable abatement of the hot winds. The heat of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra then is neither immoderate nor protracted. It is rarely very oppressive to the feelings, nor does the climate in the hot season prove so relaxing or exhausting to the system as might be expected from its abstract temperature. This arises partly from the dryness of the atmosphere, but chiefly from its rarefaction and from the regularity and strength of the sea breezes. In a substantial thatched house, with the doors shut and the windows closed and screened between the hours of from seven to nine in the morning and five in the evening, the temperature in the hottest month of the season usually ranges between $76^\\circ$ and $84^\\circ$. Tattis are neither absolutely necessary nor do they do much good. A single tatti put up in the afternoon is useful as a means of renewing the inner air, rather than of cooling the apartment, its effect being to elevate rather than to depress the thermometer, in consequence probably of the wind blowing at that time from the seaward. In the outer air the wind is felt to be unpleasantly hot, but the reflected heat is by no means so great as might be expected, or as it is found to be in less elevated and more inland parts of the Presidency. The parched and brown appearance of the surrounding country is agreeably relieved by the fresh foliage of the surrounding trees.\n\nDuring the first half of June a gradual change is felt from the dry and unpleasant heat of the hot season to the soft and refreshing temperature of the monsoon. On some days there is a genial softness of the air with westerly breezes; on others, and these perhaps the most numerous, the atmosphere is close and hot in the early part of the day; soon after noon clouds begin to form on the eastern horizon, and the day closes in with a heavy thunder-shower from the same quarters. These thunder-showers vary much both in frequency and severity in different years. The date at which the south-west monsoon sets in varies in different years, but it generally begins between the tenth and twentieth of June. For one or two days the characteristic initiatory monsoon clouds are observed to cap the summits of the surrounding hills accompanied by a delicious freshness of the air, and at length the monsoon begins usually during the day, either with dense drizzling showers or with steady heavy rain continued for an entire day. The climate now gains the coolness characteristic of the Deccan monsoon; vegetation, which had partially sprung up under the influence of the preceding thunder-showers, now increases with astonishing rapidity, and in a few days the fields and surrounding hills assume the freshness and verdure of a northern spring. The weather throughout the remainder of June, and during the month of July and greater part of August, presents the same general character, modified to a certain extent by the relative quantity of rain. For about a fortnight in July the rain falls heavily. But during the rest of the monsoon there are two or three heavy falls of a week or ten days\neach. The weather during these falls gets chilly and damp. The temperature is cool, equable, and very agreeable to the feelings, being alike removed from sultriness on the one hand and from unpleasant chilliness on the other; there is a pleasant alternation of dense dark gray sky with partial sunshine; a fresh breeze blows with scarcely any interruption from west-south-west and the rain chiefly falls in short though frequent showers, in the intervals of which exercise in the open air is very agreeable. The station is protected by the adjoining hills from the full violence of the rains and of the boisterous winds which prevail on the summits of these hills, and in a less degree on the narrow tract of country from their base to the sea-coast, while it is exempted from the scanty and uncertain falls and the frequent droughts of the inland country, only a few miles to the eastward. Although the occurrence of short and drizzling showers in the afternoon, which are generally most frequent in the scantiest monsoons, interferes with the evening exercise, no excessive dampness of the air is ever experienced indoors. Towards the end of August or beginning of September the showers become lighter, more partial, and of shorter duration; the air is sensibly drier and warmer but still pleasant, and the wind begins to shift at times to the northward of west, while clouds are again observed to rest on the tops of the higher hills, and occasionally in the morning to trail along their sides; and during the day elevated white fleecy clouds with large intervening patches of blue sky take the place of the darker and denser rain clouds of the previous months. During the latter half of the month the air is at times close and sultry, but in general it is pleasantly moist and agreeable to the feelings. The winds are now light and variable, veering from north-west round by north to east. From the latter quarter proceed the thunder-showers that mark the close, as they usher in the beginning, of the monsoon. Hailstorms too are occasionally experienced at this time.\n\nThe climate of the four monsoon months, which, but for the opportune fall of the periodical rains would prove the hottest part of the year, is in this part of the Deccan more agreeable than that of the cold season. The temperature in a house during three months of this period ranges generally from $72^\\circ$ to $75^\\circ$; the atmospheric moisture is moderate, and exercise in the open air during the day may be indulged in with pleasure and greater impunity than during the months of the cold season. During the twenty-four years ending 1883 the rainfall varied at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from thirty inches in 1866 to fifty-eight inches in 1875 and averaged $41\\cdot52$. The rainfall at the civil hospital situated in the town usually exceeds that in the station situated a mile north-east by six or eight inches. The month of October connects the rainy and cold seasons. During the first part of the month the sky is usually chequered with clouds; there are occasional short heavy showers, with or without thunder, from the eastward; the winds are light and changing, and the air is soft and occasionally close, though by no means unpleasantly warm. The atmosphere is without the bracing freshness so characteristic of\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given above pp. 22-24.\nthe mountain air at this time; but, on the other hand, it does not partake of the oppressiveness which is felt on the coast. But when there is a deficiency of the late rains, a hot dry easterly wind sometimes prevails, succeeded by close nights. In the latter part of the month the sky is clear, and the air becomes dry and warm at midday. In the evening there is generally a light westerly wind and a heavy dew at night. The cold season usually begins in the first week of November, after which, and during the two following months, the climate maintains a tolerably uniform and steady character. The mornings are still and cool, and frequently cold; and during November, but rarely afterwards, a smoky fog generally rests over the beds of the Yenna and the Krishna rivers until seven or eight. In the early part of the day an easterly or north-easterly wind springs up, and blows with varying degrees of strength, but in general very moderately, until three or four in the afternoon, when it either subsides into a light easterly air, or draws to the southward, and is succeeded by a still night. In clear weather, during the early part of the season, there is a pretty copious deposit of dew. Towards the end of January the wind begins to draw westward in the evening, and in February the sea breeze generally sets in with great regularity between eleven and one and blows through the rest of the day, rendering the climate more agreeable than in the colder and drier months that precede it. Such is the prevailing character of the weather of the cold season. But there are frequent intervals of cloudy weather, which lasts for a week or ten days. The coldest weather is always experienced when the sky is perfectly clear, and the wind is either due east, or one or two points to the northward of east.\n\nA few showers of rain generally fall in the course of the cold months, but they are less frequent and less heavy at this station than in the district to the east. They occur most frequently in November, though occasionally at other times. A plentiful fall of the late autumnal rain is not less beneficial to the climate than it is to the crops of the cold season, and tends more particularly to temper the dryness and freshness of the east winds. The mean temperature in the four winter months, excluding October, usually averages from $68^\\circ$ to $76^\\circ$, but though this is the coolest period of the year, the weather is not so pleasant as the monsoon climate. The air is often unpleasantly dry, particularly when the wind blows uninterruptedly from the east for several days in succession, without drawing round to the southward or westward. In the cold season the temperature sometimes varies as much as $40^\\circ$ in twenty-four hours.\n\nThe hills in the neighbourhood are composed of trap, capped in some places, as at Yavteshvar, with laterite. At S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the soil varies in depth from two or three feet to perhaps fifteen or twenty and consists of a soft, spongy, easily friable murum overlying the hard trap-rock.\n\nIts situation on a hill-slope gives S\u00e1t\u00e1ra excellent natural facilities for drainage. The slope is generally from south-west to north-east and the stormwater is carried off from the west by the large Krineshvar streamlet which rises in the hills beyond the Mah\u00e1dara springs.\nin the curve formed by the Yavteshvar range, whilst that from the steep precipitous sides on the north of the fort is conveyed by six streamlets which flow through the town and, like the Krineshvar, eventually discharge themselves into the Yenna. All these streams dry up after the rainy season is over.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra was first formally divided into seven divisions which are supposed to date from the reign of Sh\u00e1hu I. (1708-1749) who is reputed to have done much for the improvement of the town. The names were Raviv\u00e1r or \u00c1ditv\u00e1r, Somv\u00e1r, Mangalv\u00e1r, Budhv\u00e1r, Guruv\u00e1r, Shukrav\u00e1r, and Shanv\u00e1r, after the days of the week. There was also an independent division known as the M\u00e1chi close under the fort.\u00b9 The village of Karanja on the north and the suburb of Raghun\u00e1thpura at its south-west corner; the quarter called Basappa\u2019s Peth between Karanja and the town, the village of Godoli three quarters of a mile east, and the Sadar Baz\u00e1r within the station have also been included within municipal limits. The western and southern divisions, that is the M\u00e1chi and the Mangalv\u00e1r and Shukrav\u00e1r Peths, are the oldest parts of the town proper, and probably all that existed up to the time when (1660) Shiv\u00e1ji the Great took up his residence in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and made it the seat of government. Each of the above divisions, though of unequal size, was compact and had tolerably regular boundaries. But they contained blocks or sub-divisions with distinct names. These blocks have since become separate divisions, and when such is the case the old names cling only to the remainder of the original divisions from which these blocks were formed. Hence the irregular shape and size of the present divisions of the town, which number twenty-two and vary in extent from two to 132 acres.\n\nOf the eight original divisions or Peths, Raviv\u00e1r Peth was the most easterly and was almost square, running through the whole length of the town. Next on its western side came a narrow strip, the Guruv\u00e1r, then another narrow strip divided into two parts, that is the Budhv\u00e1r or northern and the Shanv\u00e1r or southern. West of the Budhv\u00e1r division lay the Shukrav\u00e1r division of irregular shape and west of the Shanv\u00e1r the Somv\u00e1r division, another strip, and beyond it again, the Mangalv\u00e1r division of irregular shape. To the south of the Mangalv\u00e1r Somv\u00e1r and Shanv\u00e1r divisions was the M\u00e1chi.\n\nThe old Raviv\u00e1r division contains the following blocks: In the north centre Pant\u00e1cha got or Pant\u2019s shed, so called because it contained the residence of the Pant Pratinidhi. It has an area of ten acres, seventy houses, and a population of 230 mostly Government servants. The water-supply is from two wells a small unbuilt pond and two cisterns of Yavteshvar water. In the north-west the Malh\u00e1r Peth has an area of ten acres, 122 houses, and a population of 872 mostly oil-pressers or Telis. The water-supply is from four wells one tank and two cisterns. The cisterns in front of the Police head-quarters were built in 1872 at a cost of \u00a340 (Rs. 400); in front of the jail is a native rest-house. In the centre are R\u00e1jaspura and Durga Peth. R\u00e1jaspura has an area of sixteen acres, thirty-three\n\n\u00b9 M\u00e1chi is the common name for hamlets attached to forts.\nhouses, and a population of 152 mostly Musalm\u00e1ns. **Durga Peth** is the most thickly populated in the town. It has an area of two acres, sixty houses, and a population of 250 mostly M\u00e1ngs of the late R\u00e1ja\u2019s artillery. It has one small native rest-house. The south-west corner is named **Kesharkar\u2019s Peth** and includes parts of the fort slopes. It has an area of twenty-seven acres, 112 houses, and a population of 522 one-fourth of which are Musalm\u00e1ns. The last three blocks have no wells or cisterns, but depend for their water-supply on the neighbouring sub-divisions. There remains the present Raviv\u00e1r division with an area of sixty-one acres, eighty-nine houses, and a population of 409 mostly lime-burners. The water-supply is from two reservoirs one within the rest-house enclosure, the other opposite the treasury. It has a large rest-house adjoining the Poona-Kolh\u00e1pur road.\n\nThe **Guruv\u00e1r Peth** contains no separately named blocks. With an area of twenty-seven acres, it has 579 houses, and a population of 2916 mostly silk-dyers and spinners. The water-supply is from twenty-three wells, one of them municipal.\n\nThe **Shanv\u00e1r Peth** contains no separate block. With an area of ninety-four acres, it has 777 houses and a population of 3785 about a fourth of whom are Br\u00e1hmans. Its water-supply is from fifty-two wells, one of them municipal. It has two schools, one Government branch vernacular and the other an American Mission school.\n\nThe **Budhv\u00e1r Peth** contains two blocks. The **Prat\u00e1pganj**, on the north-west, called after R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh (1818-1839), has an area of twelve acres, 127 houses, and a population of 737 mostly tailors basket-makers and coppersmiths. It has two private anglo-veracular schools. **Sad\u00e1shiv Peth** on the south has an area of ten acres, 193 houses, and a population of 706 mostly Musalm\u00e1ns and Br\u00e1hmans. The water-supply is from fourteen wells and a reservoir. It contains the meat and vegetable markets. There remains the present **Budhv\u00e1r Peth** with an area of thirty-four acres, 214 houses, and a population of 932 mostly Musalm\u00e1ns and Sangars or wool traders. The water-supply is from fourteen wells and a reservoir. It has two private Mar\u00e1thi schools and a native rest-house built by the municipality in 1874 at a cost of \u00a3122 (Rs. 1220).\n\nThe **Somv\u00e1r Peth** contains the Y\u00e1do Gop\u00e1l block, a narrow strip cut off from its south-west corner. It has an area of forty-seven acres, 193 houses, and a population of 1084 one-fourth of them Br\u00e1hmans. The water-supply is from thirty wells, one of which is municipal. The remainder or present **Shanv\u00e1r Peth** has an area of twenty-six acres, 355 houses, and a population of 1811 mostly brass and copper smiths and dancing-girls. The water-supply is from fifteen wells and a large reservoir. It has two vernacular schools one Government and the other private, and one rest-house built in 1858.\n\nThe **Shukrav\u00e1r Peth** contained a block at its south-east corner, the present **Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed Peth**, which contains the old and new palaces and principal square of the city. It has an area of thirty-four acres, 167 houses, and a population of 1137 mostly traders and shopkeepers. The water-supply is from nineteen wells, two reservoirs, and one fountain. This is the busiest of all the Peths and contains the High\nSchool, District and Subordinate Judge's courts, head-quarter offices of the Assistant and Deputy Collectors and Magistrates, and the principal shops and banks of the town. The present Shukrav\u00e1r Peth has an area of 132 acres, 182 houses, and 941 people mostly the poorer classes. Water is supplied from two reservoirs, a large pond and twenty-eight wells one of them municipal. This division contains the Jalmandir or water-pavilion and some schools.\n\nThe west portion of this Peth was separately named K\u00e1nupura but has not become a distinct division. The western and larger half of the old Mangalv\u00e1r Peth contained the following blocks now separate divisions: Vyankatpura, including a small block called Dhavalpura, has an area of twenty-six acres, 130 houses, and a population of 963 one-half of whom are well-to-do Br\u00e1hmans. Water is supplied from thirty wells and two reservoirs, one of the Mar\u00e1tha government and the other municipal built in 1862 at a cost of \u00a367 (Rs. 670). There are two vernacular schools, one private and the other Government. South of Vyankatpura lies Chimanpura with an area of sixty-five acres, 85 houses, and a population of 520 more than half of whom are Br\u00e1hmans. Water is supplied from two reservoirs, one for low castes, and twenty-one private wells. East of Chimanpura lies R\u00e1m\u00e1cha Got with an area of forty-two acres, 208 houses, and a population of 1250 mostly Gujar\u00e1ti money-lenders, jewellers, and lime-burners. Water is supplied from twenty-three private wells, and there is one Government vernacular school. There remains the present Mangalv\u00e1r Division with an area of eighty-six acres, 423 houses, and a population of 2530 one-third of whom are well-to-do Br\u00e1hmans mostly moneylenders. Water is supplied from two large ponds and sixty-nine wells, three of them municipal. There are two rest-houses in this division, one of them municipal and one private.\n\nThe M\u00e1chi Peth contains no separate blocks. It has an area of twenty-seven acres, fifty-seven houses, and a population of 250 mostly labourers. The water-supply is from six wells and seven reservoirs.\n\nBasappa's Peth is a detached sub-division about two hundred yards north of the Guruvar Peth. It has an area of two acres, forty-five houses, and a population of 195 mostly coppersmiths.\n\nRaghun\u00e1thpura, the south-west corner of Karanja, has an area of eleven acres, ninety-five houses, and a population of 444 mostly gardeners, tanners, and hide-dealers.\n\nKaranja Village, with an area of about half a square mile, has 206 houses, a school, and a population of 2261 principally cultivators. It is the site of Aurangzeb's camp when he besieged S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort in 1700. To the village is attached a hamlet inhabited by washermen.\n\nGodoli Village, with an area of about half a square mile, has 181 houses and a population of 1217.\n\nThe Sadar Baz\u00e1r, which belongs to the station but is under the Municipality, has an area of twenty-eight acres, 343 houses, and a population of 1954 mostly P\u00e1rsis Musalm\u00e1ns and Mh\u00e1rs. Water is supplied from seven wells. There are four private rest-houses and four schools three of them private and one Mission.\nThe 1872 census showed for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra a population of 25,603 of whom 21,824 or 85\u00b724 per cent were Hindus, 3176 or 12\u00b740 per cent were Musalm\u00e1ns, 549 Christians, and 54 Others. The 1881 census showed an increase of 3425 or 29,028 of whom 24,809 or 85\u00b747 per cent were Hindus, 3596 or 12\u00b738 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 527 Christians, forty-eight P\u00e1rsis, and forty-eight Others.\n\nA large portion of the town was originally laid out by the late Major-General Briggs a former Resident at the court of the late R\u00e1ja, and broad roads running from south to north and east to west were constructed as the principal thoroughfares. Twenty-six miles of made roads are kept out of municipal funds.\n\nThe principal outlets from the town are, one at the post office where a large rest-house is situated on the Poona-Belgaum mail road, and whence branch roads, to Pandharpur by M\u00e1huli and Koregaon, to T\u00e1sgaon by Rahimatpur the old Poona road, another by the tunnel at the south-west angle of the town which communicates with Parli fort and by a cross road with the Belgaum road further south; and a third by the road running north from the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth which joins the new Poona and Mah\u00e1baleshvar roads about a mile from the town. From the post office a large street runs west to the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth and another along the south of the town to the tunnel. From this another street branches west to the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth. This is the broadest street in the town and contains the principal shops. Another large street runs parallel to this a little further south but has not much traffic. There are two principal streets running from south to north, the one from the Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da to the last street mentioned and so on through the length of the town, the other from the tunnel turning to the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth. From the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth also branch two main streets, the one northwards to the Poona road and the other westwards through the Mangalv\u00e1r and Vyankatpura divisions.\n\nThe tunnel is cut through the base of an offshoot of the hill to the south of the town for securing communication with the roads leading to Kar\u00e1d in the south-east and to the fort of Parli in the south-west, the burial place of R\u00e1md\u00e1s Sv\u00e1mi the spiritual guide of Shiv\u00e1ji. It was built in 1855 soon after the death of the last R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, under the direction of Captain P. L. Hart. A tablet built at the entrance shows that the tunnel was completed in 1855 at a cost of \u00a32900 (Rs. 29,000) when Mr. Ogilvy was Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nThe city has 4084 houses of which ninety-eight are of the better sort and 3986 of the poorer sort. The better class of houses are, as a general rule, built upon a plinth of well chiselled cut-stones with a superstructure of burnt bricks and roofed with good seasoned wood sometimes with an upper storey. The outer walls of the principal houses of this class are strongly built with a gateway leading into an open court-yard with a veranda running all round the main building. The rooms and the upper stories have generally windows facing the court-yard. The roofs of the houses are invariably covered with the flat brick tiles.\n\n1 Distribution details of the city population are given above pp. 557-559.\nmade in the town. The front storeys have in some cases balconies facing the roads which add to the appearance of the building.\n\nThe houses of the poorer sort have generally a coarse rubble plinth and are built with sun-dried bricks, the walls being in many cases plastered with mud. They have only one groundfloor, and when they have an upper storey or loft it is generally set apart as a lumber room. They have the doors generally opening into the streets, and in some instances a row of small windows. The ventilation of these houses is very defective as it is only from the low doorway opening into the street by which air finds admittance into the house in the daytime, while during the night the door being closed, ventilation is obstructed. All these buildings are also covered with tiles. The internal arrangement of these houses is generally regulated according to the social position, means, and the religious prejudices of the owners. Houses of the better sort, belonging to well-to-do Br\u00e1hmans Prabhus and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, contain generally a separate god-room, cook-room, sleeping room, store-room, and a hall, the hall being generally more spacious and open to light than the other apartments. The rooms for the female members of the family and bathing rooms are also provided for in the rear of the building. Privies cattle-sheds and stables are detached from the main building. Poor houses cannot afford such conveniences, but when the owner of such a house happens to be a Br\u00e1hman these objects are attained by the use of reed or bamboo partition walls plastered with mud. If however the house is sufficiently large, mud walls are built to form the requisite number of rooms for accommodation. Some of the newly built houses have been provided with means of ventilation and the old practice of carving the figures of animals or any mythological characters on the wood work of the building is dying out. Except the figures of such mythological characters as are considered both devotional and virtuous, coloured paintings on the walls are replaced by yellow blue and pink paints.\n\nThe houses of Muhammadans have the halls and the female apartments more spacious and well ventilated, the rest of the internal arrangements of the buildings being the same as observed in Hindu houses. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds, who form but a very small portion of the community have their houses built entirely after European fashion.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra is throughout the year the seat of the judge and civil surgeon, and during the rains of the Collector, the assistant and deputy collectors, the police superintendent, district forest officer and district engineers for irrigation and public works. It is also the head-quarters of the chief revenue and police offices of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division and is provided with a municipality, church, jail, courthouse, civil hospital, high school, civil jail, post and telegraph offices, the offices of the staff officer, and of the deputy commissary and the barrack serjeant, a travellers\u2019 bungalow, and a fort.\n\nOn the 1st of August 1853 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was constituted a municipality, in 1875 declared a town municipality under Act VI. of 1873, and a city municipality since March 1884. To the east and north-east of the town are the residency and civil station in which European and\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nNative troops are quartered whilst the Sadar Baz\u00e1r of the station forms the district municipal quarters or peth.\n\nIn 1882-83, besides a credit balance of \u00a32589 (Rs. 25,890) and a loan of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) taken during the year, the municipality had a net income of \u00a35127 (Rs. 51,270) or a taxation of about 3s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 1\u00bd) a head. This income is chiefly drawn from octroi. During the same year the expenditure amounted to \u00a39308 (Rs. 93,080) of which \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) were spent on buildings for the city water-supply.\n\nWater Supply.\n\nThe water-supply of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is chiefly derived from three sources Yavteshvar, Mah\u00e1rdara, and wells. The first is from the summit of the Yavteshvar hill where an intercepting masonry channel was made during the Mar\u00e1tha rule along the northern ridge which catches the water from about thirty springs as they issue along the verge of the hill. The channel passes along the eastern face and that of the dividing ridge and over the tunnel along the side of the fort and is distributed from the highest point of the town near the Rang Mah\u00e1l. It supplies eighty-seven public fountains and dipping wells and ten private cisterns. The water is extremely pure, but runs short during the hot weather (March-May) when it is most needed.\n\nThe second is known as the Mah\u00e1rdara and is taken from three masonry ponds in the valley of the Krishneshvar stream in the Yavteshvar recesses. The water is let out by sluices into a channel to the large pond in the Mangalv\u00e1r Peth known as Shripatr\u00e1v Pratinidhi's Tank and built by the Pant Pratinidhi of that name about 1730. From this pond the water is raised by a Persian wheel usually worked by two bullocks and supplied by channels to the western quarters of the town, the Jalmandir or water pavilion and the old and new palace reservoirs, and a dipping well close to the town library. It is estimated that the Yavteshvar and Mah\u00e1rdara supplies together yield about twenty gallons a head, except in April May and June when they sink down to three or four gallons a head or even less. The public dipping wells are raised stone cisterns about three or four feet deep and are divided into compartments for the exclusive use of different castes of Hindus and for Musalm\u00e1ns. The Mh\u00e1s and M\u00e1ngs are not allowed to enter the enclosures where high caste Hindus draw water; and in some quarters of the town until lately no provision was made by which they could obtain it. Now at certain fountains men are employed by the municipality to distribute the water to the low caste people outside the enclosure and at other places separate cisterns outside have been provided for their use. Besides the above there are 425 wells which however nearly all run dry in the hot weather and seven ponds the water of which is mostly undrinkable. Of the various ponds and wells the following are worth special mention. The dipping well adjoining the civil hospital in the Guruv\u00e1r Peth is a fine bit of work and the principal source of supply of the Yavteshvar water. One of the ponds in the Budhv\u00e1r Peth known as the Div\u00e1n's Tank is of good masonry, 100 feet long and 10 feet deep with a broad flight of steps. It was built by the father of the\npresent T\u00e1tya S\u00e1heb Div\u00e1n. To the east of Shukrav\u00e1r Peth is B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s well, a fine bit of masonry built by B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the second Peshwa (1720-1740). It has a flight of sixty steps and is eighty feet deep and about forty feet in diameter. The Bad\u00e1mi well in the same division behind the Jalmandir or water pavilion is a curious structure so called from its almond-like shape. In the middle of the Shanv\u00e1r Peth is a large pond called the Im\u00e1mpuri. It was originally hewn out as a quarry which was afterwards abandoned and when water collected in it used as a pond. A parapet has been erected and its sides have been repaired from time to time. But it usually runs dry in the hot weather.\n\nNightsoil is removed from the town under the superintendence of two inspectors. There are two iron and eight wooden night-soil carts for its removal and they make seven trips during the night. The filth is taken to the Genda Mal, an open space to the north, where it is stored in 330 pits each ten feet long by seven broad and six deep dug in the ground. Here are also removed and buried all dead animals.\n\nThere are two open market-places and two market buildings. The Monday market is held in the southern half of the Bhav\u00e1ni square. On Thursdays and Saturdays it is held in a square to the south of the lower road about a quarter of a mile west of the jail. At all these markets grain, and at the Thursday and Saturday baz\u00e1rs livestock, are brought for sale. On Tuesday mornings a small rice market is held in the Bhav\u00e1ni square.\n\nThe permanent markets are in Sad\u00e1shiv Peth and consist of three parallel ranges of buildings. They are on the right or north of the lower road about 150 yards beyond the second open market place. There are two rows of shops running east to west about 450 feet long separated by wooden partitions. They are flanked by two smaller rows running north to south about a hundred feet long.\n\nIn the middle of the space are two plinths, one covered, about 150 feet long and divided lengthwise by partition walls running east and west. On these the vegetable sellers sit and the shops are rented from the municipality by traders of various kinds but principally in grain cloth and hardware. To the north is a large open space of about 1200 square yards usually occupied by Dhangars with sheep for sale. Fifty yards north-west of these markets is the meat market, a space of about 27 yards by 14 enclosed with buildings opening inwards and divided into two sections by an open passage six yards wide running east and west. This contains the meat stalls. All stalls and shops are rented from the municipality. The buildings are all plain brick with tiled roofs and raised on stone plinths about five feet high and are without any architectural pretensions.\n\nMost of the vegetable and fruit gardens are to the north of the Budhv\u00e1r Peth between S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Karanja and are worked by the M\u00e1lis of Raghun\u00e1thpura. Behind the old and new palaces is the Shikhri B\u00e1gh, a palm and plantain garden in former days used by the Zenana people of the Mar\u00e1tha R\u00e1j\u00e1s and now belonging to \u00c1b\u00e1 S\u00e1heb Bhonsle. There are other private gardens formerly\nbelonging to the R\u00e9j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and now to Ab\u00e1 S\u00e1heb at Khed two miles north-east and at Khondiye two miles north-west.\n\nThe station has a fair collection of roses and other plants at the recreation ground, while there is also a Government recreation ground garden supported partly by voluntary subscriptions whence plants and European vegetables are obtainable. The supply greatly varies owing chiefly to unsteadiness of demand and frequent change in the management.\n\nAs above explained most of the ancient town was under the fort walls. According to tradition Shiv\u00e1ji used to reside principally in the fort. He and his successors used the old Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da as a court for the transaction of business. The Peshw\u00e1s afterwards appropriated it entirely to their own use. The Rang Mah\u00e1l was used as a pleasure house and on the shoulder of the fort was the R\u00e1nis\u2019 pleasure house, principally used by them for witnessing the Dasara processions. Neither these nor any other of the old buildings seem to have been remarkable for elaborate carving or for architectural decorations. The rooms were low and the court-yards the reverse of spacious. Nothing of an imposing nature seems to have been attempted till R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh built the old palace in 1824.\n\nThe Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da is situated at the base of the fort walls not far from the post office junction on the road to the tunnel. Its plinth is about ten feet high on the outside and was so built in order to obtain a level basement as the slope of the hill is considerable. The gateway is plain; a flight of a dozen steps leads to the court which is as usual rectangular about 50 feet square surrounded by buildings, mostly inhabited only in the upper storeys, the lower being long verandas opening on to the courts. Behind this is a solid block of buildings. The whole covers about 225 feet by 160. The civil courts were held in this building till the new palace was appropriated by Government in 1876.\n\nThe Rang Mah\u00e1l, about 220 yards east of the Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da, was originally a rectangular building facing north about 100 feet long and 50 feet wide on an enclosure 150 feet wide. It was burnt in 1874 when the high school which had been held in it since 1849 was transferred to the old palace. Sh\u00e1hu the first died at the Rang Mah\u00e1l which therefore must date from at least as early as his reign. Directly in front of it is a large enclosure known as the mansion of the Sen\u00e1pati or commander-in-chief. The walls have all been pulled down since its confiscation at the banishment of the Sen\u00e1pati with the R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh. The enclosure was nearly 350 feet square.\n\nNorth of this is a rectangular building with two wings which used to be the elephant stable in the days when a number were required for state purposes. North of this again is the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s kach\u00e9ri or office. It consists of the eastern half of a mansion which originally belonged to the Shirkes, one of the most ancient Mar\u00e1tha families, and was confiscated by Government after the mutiny in 1857 on proof of the complicity of the elder Shirke.\n\nAbout 220 yards east of the Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da and about forty yards down the first turn to the right, on the left hand side of the street is the Sachiv\u2019s mansion. The block of buildings occupies about 150\nfeet square. There is a garden with a few plantains at the back but there is little remarkable in the mansion.\n\nAbout a hundred and twenty yards beyond the turn to the Sachiv\u2019s mansion is that of the Daphle another of the principal feudatories and chief of Jath. It is of about the same size as the Sachiv\u2019s mansion and has a plantain and palm garden to the north. The chief of late has been residing pretty constantly in this mansion. About eighty yards north of the Sachiv\u2019s mansion along the same street is N\u00e1tu\u2019s mansion, now belonging to the descendants of Balvantr\u00e1v N\u00e1tu, one of the principal adherents of the R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji, who was principally concerned in unmasking the plots of the R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh against the British Government from whom he received handsome rewards for his loyalty. This mansion is noteworthy as being much used in former days by the Peshw\u00e1s as their private residence.\n\nThe Pant Pratinidhi\u2019s mansion is situated in the Pant\u2019s Got, and is not in any way remarkable. Adjoining it in the south is a large set of stables. The treasury and account offices with those of the permanent head-quarter Magistrate and Deputy Collector are situated in a block of buildings known as the Hajiri bungalow. They are north of the Poona road close to the post office junction. The treasury is in a two-storeyed block in the centre. The other offices are in buildings lining the sides of the enclosure. A broad causeway leads on to the large open space forming the present race course. The name of this set of buildings is taken from the fact that it was the head-quarters and muster or haj\u00edri ground of the army in Mar\u00e1tha times. The buildings occupy a space of about 200 feet square. The present buildings were erected by Davlat Kh\u00e1n, the commandant of the cavalry or ris\u00e1la under the last two R\u00e1j\u00e1s, out of savings accumulated from the sale of stable manure.\n\nThe present police head-quarters are in a block of buildings directly opposite the jail and about equal in size to the Hajiri bungalow. They were originally the head-quarters of the cavalry belonging to the last two R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nOn a shoulder of the fort-hill was situated a small palace used by the R\u00e1nis as a pleasure-house, and principally for viewing the Dasara sports. These sports were one of the principal institutions under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule. They are held in honour of the slaughter of a demon named Mahish\u00e1sur, by the devi who was created by Shiv at the intercession of the minor deities on account of the devastations caused by the demon. This demon had the form of a buffalo centaur. The ceremonies therefore commenced with the slaughter of a buffalo before the shrine of Bhav\u00e1ni, the patron goddess of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the fatal blow being given by the R\u00e1ja himself. But first the buffalo is taken in procession round the city very much in the character of the Jewish scapegoat as a victim to carry away the sins and evils bodily or spiritual of the city. His slaughter is an act of merit, though no Hindu will eat his flesh which is given to the outcastes. On the same day an unlimited number of sheep and goats are also sacrificed in honour of Bhav\u00e1ni. Great veneration is paid to horses who are decorated in fantastic fashion and also form a principal\npart of the procession. The forehead of every horse was anointed with the blood of the sheep or goat, and after that the flesh was eaten by the grooms or horsekeepers. The next ceremony after the slaughter of the buffalo, which took place generally towards evening, used to be the great procession headed by the R\u00e1ja and followed by all his nobles. In this procession it was a point of honour that the nobles should bear all their insignia and come in the highest state for which they were entitled. For instance, a noble entitled to sit in a p\u00e1lkhi would be bound so to appear, and his appearance on horseback would be disrespectful. About the neighbourhood of the Hajir\u00ed Bungalow were planted numerous apta trees typical again of the demon who was slain on the day. The procession over, the R\u00e1ja struck the first tree and his followers the rest. The leaves of the tree were then gathered by the populace as the spoil of the demon. They were considered typical of gold pieces, and were afterwards given to friends as complimentary presents and wishes of good luck. The day terminated with the chief darb\u00e1r or state assemblage of the year on which offerings were made to the reigning prince who in his turn bestowed dresses of honour titles and rewards.\u00b9 The only other buildings of Mar\u00e1tha times worth mentioning are the Far\u00e1s Kh\u00e1na or store-house of camp equipage and the p\u00e1ga or R\u00e1ja's stables both adjoining the large square.\n\nIn the Shukrav\u00e1r Peth are two water pavilions or jalmandirs, the old and the new. The old pavilion, which was laid out by R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh in 1824-25, is a plain one-storeyed building and had one room of which the walls and ceilings were covered with looking-glass. It is now occupied by the local municipality by whom the building and the pleasant garden attached to it have been repaired at some outlay. A pretty little pond between the municipal office and the garden adds to the attraction of the place. The new water pavilion owned by \u00c1ba S\u00e1heb Bhonsle was laid out by R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh's brother much about the same time as the old building. It has a large and beautiful garden divided into two parts, the upper or western and the lower or eastern. The upper part contains the water pavilion, which is two-storeyed and built on a pavement in the centre of a small tank. It has also a mirror-room of two apartments, one containing pictures of native and Anglo-Indian celebrities by native artists. The walls and ceiling of the other are completely covered with mirrors. The garden contains a large number of cocoa and betel palms and other fruit trees besides a good number of flower plants. It is intersected with parallel paths paved with well chiselled stones. The lower or eastern portion of the garden contains a pleasure-house. The buildings and gardens are up to the present time well taken care of and are frequented by people of all classes. The large open ground to the south of the garden, but within the enclosure of the jalmandir, is used during the rainy and cold seasons for foot races and athletic sports, a favourite amusement with the surviving Mar\u00e1tha nobles and retainers. These sports attract many wrestlers from N\u00e1gpur Baroda and Gwalior.\n\n\u00b9 Details are given below in Appendix D.\nThe palace in the Bhav\u00e1ni Peth, which is a good specimen of native architecture, is a four-cornered block of buildings, occupying several acres of ground and the large open space in front admits of its being seen to advantage. There is nothing very imposing about the facade, the white plastered surface of which is only broken by numerous large windows and their wooden frame-work. A low veranda on wooden pillars runs along the ground floor. There is some carving about the wood-work, but it is too minute to produce any general effect on the building. The palace is in two blocks, one block called the old and another called the new. The old palace built in 1824 by R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh can be seen to advantage from a distance of more than a mile in the east, while its terrace at the top fifty feet from the ground commands a full and extensive view of the whole town up to the base of the surrounding hills. Its right wing contains a large cistern for the use of the inmates of the palace. The front hall has two balconies on either side of the gateway from which the chiefs and the royal family used to look at the sports in the large open space below. This palace is now occupied by the local high school and was used as a relief house during the 1876-77 famine. The other block of the building that is the new palace is an improvement upon the old one and was built by R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji in 1838 to supersede the Rang Mah\u00e1l, a building of less pretensions immediately under the fort. A large portion of the building containing fifty-two rooms consisted of women's quarters. The most distinguishing feature of the building is its solid structure. A gateway leads into a court-yard surrounded by a broad colonnade. The walls are covered with paintings of mythological subjects and hunting scenes. The audience hall at the upper end on the western side of the courtyard dedicated to Bhav\u00e1ni, the patron goddess of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, was built by R\u00e1ja Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji in 1844. The hall is eighty-three feet long forty-five broad and twenty-five high. The roof is supported on two parallel longitudinal rows of teak beams, sixteen in each row with scolloped horse-shoe arches between the pillars. The pillars during the R\u00e1ja's time were covered with tapestry consisting of rich brocade with profuse gold embroidery and spangles, while the sides of the hall were hung with costly materials of brilliant coloured Ghazni silk. The hall is surrounded on three sides by rows of fountains, which when in play throw up jets of water nearly twenty-five feet high. In a small but richly carved room opening from the colonnade was the royal throne. Near the throne-room is another in which Bhav\u00e1ni, the far-famed sword of Shiv\u00e1ji, was kept. In the time of the late R\u00e1ja, during the Navr\u00e1tra holidays in Ashvin (September-October), the shrine of Bhav\u00e1ni in the palace was much thronged with visitors from the town and the district especially by the relatives, dependents, and retainers of the Mar\u00e1tha nobles. In 1876 the palace was taken possession of by the British Government and the audience hall, together with a part of the colonnade on either side, is now occupied by the courts of the district and subordinate judges and of the higher district officers. The hall is still used as an audience and reception hall on occasions of grand state ceremonies.\n\nThe charitable institution called the Frere Annachhatra or Almshouse was founded on the 17th of September 1854 under\nGovernment authority to commemorate the services rendered by the late Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere when Commissioner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra between 1848 and 1850. A fund was raised by voluntary contributions by the estate-holders bankers Government servants and pensioners. The amount to the credit of the fund stood on 1st January 1884 at \u00a31106 2s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 11,661 as. 3). Out of the interest of the fund, which amounted in 1883 to \u00a344 3s. 8d. (Rs. 441 as. 13\u00bd), grain of the value of 4s. (Rs. 2) is distributed every Sunday Tuesday and Thursday morning among the blind, the lame, and the helpless. At a place to the east of the town and north of the Pavai N\u00e1ka is the tree near which the charity distribution takes place. The tree has a stone-work or p\u00e1r round it bearing a Mar\u00e1thi and an English inscription. The English inscription runs:\n\n\"This Testimonial in conjunction with a charitable Institution has been erected in the year 1865 by subscription of J\u00e9girdars and others as a respectful tribute of gratitude and memory of His late Highness Sha'ha'ji Ra'ja of Sa'ta'ra and of H. B. E. Frere Esquire, the British Commissioner, Sa'ta'ra.\"\n\nThe number of persons receiving grain every Sunday Tuesday and Thursday varies from seventy-five to a hundred.\n\nA large building in Shanv\u00e1r Peth, built originally for a jail by the late R\u00e1ja, was used for that purpose till 1864. Owing to its defective arrangements a new jail covering ten acres of land was built in 1864 in Malh\u00e1r Peth on the site occupied by the late R\u00e1ja's arsenals, opposite the police head-quarters. The jail buildings were built by a gang of nearly 150 Chinese convicts. It is a fourth class jail, accommodating 125 persons or one prisoner to 648 cubic feet of space. The jail is more or less overcrowded the number of prisoners in ordinary times amounting to 400. Large numbers have recently been employed on extramural work, thereby decreasing the pressure on the central jail. There are two barracks for male prisoners running from south to north and facing each other capable of holding thirty prisoners each. The female ward, which is a detached building, provides accommodation for fourteen prisoners though the number often varies from thirty to forty. In addition to these are fifteen cells, each capable of holding nearly ten prisoners if necessary. There is a small detached building in the jail used as a hospital with beds for fifteen patients under the charge of a second class hospital assistant. Within the jail is one cistern supplied with cooking and drinking water from the Mah\u00e1rdara reservoir and an unbuilt pond which serves as a reservoir for rain and spring water ordinarily used for watering the jail garden, and in the hot season when the supply at the cistern is generally scanty, for cooking and washing. The pond is the result of quarrying for the outer jail walls. Within the walls is a small garden where country and European vegetables are grown, the former for the use of the prisoners and the latter for the station. The other buildings are the office of the jail superintendent who is the civil surgeon and the manufactory. Among the articles turned out by convict labour are tapes, ropes, trouser cloth, towels, napkins, tablecloth, blankets,\n\n---\n\n1 Of the fifteen cells four are for under-trial prisoners, four for condemned prisoners, two for Europeans, four for boys, and one for other purposes.\nand cane work. The number of convicts in the jail on the 31st of December 1882 was eighty-four. During the year 1883, 297 convicts were admitted and 311 were discharged. The construction of a new jail has been sanctioned by Government.\n\nThe Civil Hospital is situated in the Durga Peth on the south of the large thoroughfare connecting Bhav\u00e1ni Peth with the tunnel road. The enclosure covers some 2000 square yards and contains an in-patients' ward and dispensing room on the south, hospital assistants' quarters on the eastern and women's ward on the northern side. Besides the Civil Surgeon who attends daily there is a resident hospital assistant. The hospital was established in 1840 and in 1883 treated 438 in-patients and 9047 out patients at a cost of \u00a31219 4s. (Rs. 12,192).\n\nThe Municipal Office is on the north-east corner of the new palace, and consists of the old Jalmandir. It is conveniently situated adjoining the most busy quarters of the town. The library is at the south-east corner of the Bhav\u00e1ni square. It has 1761 English Mar\u00e1thi and Sanskrit books and subscribes to the daily papers vernacular and Anglo-Indian and is much used as a reading room by educated natives. Several leading English periodicals and weeklies are also taken. This institution also serves as a circulating library to the Europeans of the station who subscribe pretty generally.\n\nThe High School is situated in the old palace and is attended by among others the sons of the Pant Pratinidhi and Pant Sachiv. There are nine other schools eight of them Mar\u00e1thi and one Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed. Of the eight Mar\u00e1thi schools one is for girls. These ten schools had, in 1882-83, 1523 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 1241. Since 1874-75 the High School has passed, on an average, five pupils at the matriculation examination. Besides these ten Government schools, the city has an aided and inspected school with 102 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 82 pupils.\n\nOf the ninety-seven temples, built some by the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra chiefs and some by private persons, forty-four are in four divisions, thirteen in the Shanv\u00e1r Peth, twelve in the Manglv\u00e1r Peth, eleven in the Guruv\u00e1r Peth, and eight in Vyankatpura. The remaining fifty-three are distributed in the other divisions except Durga and R\u00e1jaspura which contain no temples. The two oldest temples of M\u00e1ru\u1e6di in the Guruv\u00e1r Peth and of Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i in the Mangalv\u00e1r Peth are two hundred years old. None of these temple buildings are of any beauty or antiquity.\u00b9 The most patronised is the Krishneshvar temple in the extreme west of the city in Shukrav\u00e1r division. It consists of a plain stone shrine and vestibule with a hall on wooden pillars and a rectangular court lined with cloisters. There are regular services and expositions of the sacred books and the daily attendance is considerable. The temples of Bhuleshvar and Ganpati in the Mangalv\u00e1r Peth near\n\n\u00b9 The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra city temples are so poor because M\u00e1luli three miles to the east is the place of devotion for S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and contains all the best temples. Details are given above under M\u00e1luli pp. 516 - 519.\nthe large pond and of R\u00e1ni further south are also large and much patronised. On the first day and full-moon of every month, on the Mondays and especially the last Monday of Shr\u00e1van or July-August troops of people are seen on the road to M\u00e1huli. Many also pass this way up a Saturday on their way to the sacred hill of Jaranda seven miles distant. To M\u00e1huli also are carried the dead of all who can afford it in order that the bodies may be burnt near the sacred Krishna and the ashes carried away by the stream. Of the ninety-seven temples twenty-nine receive from the British Government yearly cash allowances varying from 2s. to \u00a321 (Rs. 1 - 210).\n\nOf the nineteen mosques six are found each in Guruv\u00e1r and Shanv\u00e1r Peths and the remaining seven in the Mangalv\u00e1r, Raviv\u00e1r, and Malh\u00e1r Peths and in the R\u00e1m\u00e1ch\u00e1got Rajaspra and Durga Peth. The costliest of these mosques is in the Durga built at a cost of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) by the late R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh at the request of Amina a dancing girl. It is a plain domed whitewashed building about fifty feet by forty and fifteen feet high. The building fronts east with four Saracenic arches, another row running down the centre of the building. The arches are ornamented in floral patterns of tolerable workmanship.\n\nImmediately behind the southern block of market shops in the Sad\u00e1shiv Peth is the American Mission church. Regular services and preaching are held in the church and open air daily and on Sundays. The mission has a school about fifty yards north of the post office.\n\nThe station, immediately east of the town, has an area of three and a half square miles. It is situated very pleasingly on high ground about a mile from the right bank of the Yenna at the point where the stream reaches the more open vale of the Krishna into which it falls two miles lower down at M\u00e1huli. Owing to the less confined position of the station, the amphitheatre of hills rising from the borders of the two rivers are seen to much greater advantage than from the town. Some of the hills in question, among which Chandan Vaudan, Jaranda, Yavteshvar, and the hill fort of S\u00edt\u00e1ra stand prominent, show in their most striking forms the distinctive features of the secondary trap formation and give a character of peculiar beauty to the scenery of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra valley. These hills form most striking objects in the landscape from their boldness and variety in shape and colour. They environ the station on the north, south, and west in distances varying from two to eight or nine miles and reach heights approximately from 1000 to 1300 feet above the plain, the forms most general in them being table-shaped and hog-backed.\n\nThe surface of the station is well wooded and contains a large extent of grazing ground cut by several natural streamlets carrying the drainage into the Yenna. The soil immediately round is very shallow and consists chiefly of a light friable yellowish red murum formed from the decomposed trap with very little alluvial soil. But the black mould gradually deepens as it approaches the Yenna. From the rapidity with which the porous substratum of the soil soaks moisture and from the sloping nature of the ground\nthe surface very soon dries after the heaviest monsoon rains. There is very little watered land around and the neighbourhood is free from malarious influences. The station is most excellently provided with roads which intersect it in all directions and in many places are beautifully shaded. The old Poona road over the Nira bridge skirts the camp limits on the north-west and the road to Kolhapur, which is part of the Poona-Belgaum road, skirts its southern boundary above which lies Godoli village which is included in the camp limits. The road to Rahimatpur, which is part of the Satara-Belgaum road, runs south-west through the station, while that to Mahuli which is part of the Satara-Pandharpur road, passes nearly due east through its upper part. In the hot weather the aspect of the station is bare and brown as is inevitable. But the abundant rainfall in the monsoon clothes the surrounding hills and large open spaces with brilliant green and gives a park-like appearance to the whole landscape. There are few who will not be struck with the unusual verdure of Satara during the rains as compared with most Indian stations. This lasts usually well over October and seldom entirely fades till late in November, when occasionally it is restored by a late fall of rain. The surrounding country is not good riding and there is but little game. But the drives are excellent. Few views are more beautiful than those of the Krishna at Mahuli and Vaduth, and of the Urmodi valley looking either south or south-west from the khind, a small opening in the hills three miles south along the Poona road.\n\nThe magnificent avenues of trees on the old Poona road are a sight in themselves, and delightful views of the hills are to be had up the Yenna valley by driving either along the Mahabaleshwar road as far as the shoulder which runs out to the north-east of the town or along the new Poona road to the Yenna bridge. The race course too is a fine open space whence the country round is excellently viewed.\n\nThe station water-supply is nearly all from wells. It runs very low in the hot weather. Daulatkhan's Tank near the travellers' bungalow and the new well in the Godoli pond last the longest. The best drinking water is to be had from the cistern near the Hajiri bungalow which contains Yavteshwar water. The military cantonment of Satara was transferred to the civil authorities and the municipality in 1867 when it became a civil station. The troops at present quartered consist of two companies of Her Majesty's European Regiment and a Native Infantry Regiment.\n\nProceeding down the Mahuli road from the post office junction the first building is the Executive Engineer's office on the right. Two hundred and fifty yards further on, also on the right hand, is the Collector's bungalow and offices known as the Residency. Immediately east of the Residency enclosure are several blocks of barracks and in the north is a separate block conspicuous from its corrugated iron roof. Just before reaching the Residency gate a turn north is reached; a hundred and fifty yards down this road are the public gardens, the recreation ground of the European officers and their families. Another 150 yards lead to the European hospital, a low thatched building. The same distance further on is the mess\nalso thatched and easily recognizable from its size as compared with the neighbouring bungalows. The native lines are situated about 200 yards to the north-east of the mess, and between the lines and the mess is the parade ground. The Sadar baz\u00e1r lies immediately to the north of the lines. Opposite the mess another road turns almost due west following which for 250 yards is reached the church on the right hand side of the road. About a hundred yards south-west of the church and in full view is the arsenal surrounded by a slight earthwork and a ditch.\n\nThe church of St. Thomas was opened in 1850. It is sixty-three feet from east to west and sixteen feet from north to south. At the east end is a handsome stained glass window and a carved teak screen. The Gothic roof is of teak and the pulpit of polished gray stone. The old colours of the 6th Native Infantry are crossed over the west entrance.\u00b9 The station has two Roman Catholic chapels one under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bombay and the other under the jurisdiction of His Grace the Archbishop of Goa. The chapel under the Bishop of Bombay is in the Military Lines. It was built in 1863 by the Reverend De Souza, military chaplain of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, partly from a Government contribution but chiefly at his own expense. The chapel under the jurisdiction of His Grace the Archbishop of Goa was built in 1846 by public subscription and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the invocation of Nossa Senhora De Saude. Near the chapel, surrounded by a burnt brick wall repaired in 1866 by the Portuguese community, is a cemetery. The chaplain is paid by the Goa government. About half a mile north-east of the European barracks is the cemetery planted with flowers and cypresses and other fine trees. It contains a remarkable tomb with a white marble cross, to the wife of Thomas H. Leach, who died August 1870, and to her husband who died January 31st, 1875, when out with the police after a criminal and shot accidentally by one of his own police men. At the south-east corner is the grave, unmarked by a stone, of the wife of a sub-judge shot by her husband by accident. A little off to the right of the road leading to the fort is the old cemetery now closed where the oldest tomb is to Major Bromley who died July 15th, 1852.\u00b2\n\nThe chief places of interest within easy reach of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra are Parli, P\u00e1teshvar, Yavteshvar,\u00b3 and the fort. The steep-sided and flat-topped hill fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra lies to the south of the town and at the end of one of the many Sahy\u00e1dri spurs jutting south-east along the Yenna valley. It rises rather abruptly to the height of about 900 feet and commands the town and the view of a most extensive and superb panorama of hills among them Chandan and Vandan and the lofty ridge of Jaranda on the east, Yavteshvar and other hills on the west, and Parli to the south-west. It stretches for about 1100 yards from east to west and 600 yards from north to south.\n\n\u00b9 Murray's Bombay Handbook, 270. \u00b2 Murray's Bombay Handbook, 270. \u00b3 Details are given above under Parli and P\u00e1teshvar and below under Yavteshvar.\nIts summit is shaped like a triangle, the eastern portion of the rampart with a strong tower in the north stretching from the north-eastern to the south-eastern angle forming its base. It is defended by a steep perpendicular precipice of black rock about forty feet high surmounted by a masonry stone work and breastworks with loopholes for defence. There are only two gates one in the north 150 yards from the north-west angle and the other a mere sallyport on the south side, the same distance from the south-east angle. The approach to the last is almost inaccessible from steepness. That to the other is by an excellent path from the station. This path is about eight feet wide. It is about two miles long and starting from Godoli village strikes the shoulder of the fort hill on which the R\u00e1inis' palace is situated about half a mile from that village. It crosses the shoulder about half a mile further on and at a gentle gradient follows the northern slope of the hill till within about 250 feet of the top and directly under the western angle. It then turns sharp round to the east and becoming steeper runs up to within fifty feet of the northern gate, where it again turns south. Outside the gate is a small hamlet. Bastions at the western angle and at an angle a hundred yards north-east of the gate command this path on two sides. The old paths connecting the fort with the town are very steep and zigzag to the gate where they join the present path, the one from the junction of the tunnel road with the street which runs to Bhav\u00e1ni Peth and the other about a hundred yards east of the Ad\u00e1lat v\u00e1da. The path up to the gateway is within the range of gunshot from the rampart above, and the nearer it approaches the gateway the more vertical to the base of the rampart are the loopholes till within but a few yards of the entrance door where the way is exposed to fire from the bastion in the north-east. The walls are of various materials from the huge boulders of pre-Muhammadan times to the small masonry of the later Mar\u00e1tha. They are generally not less than ten feet thick with a parapet two or three feet thick and much the same in height.\n\nThe remains on the top are no less than nine ponds, a palace built by the last Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1v (1796-1817) and other buildings. In the north-eastern angle just on the brow of the strong tower is a temple of Mangl\u00e1i Devi the guardian deity of the fort. Two of the ponds situated close to the north wall about 200 and 500 yards from the gateway are of well built masonry. Their dimensions are about 80 yards square and 40 by 60 yards with a depth of 20 to 30 feet. Another pond of about the same size as the second of the above is situated 100 yards south of it and a fourth 150 yards south of the third. These ponds are merely cut out of the rock. All have plenty of water and are stocked with fish, some of a large size. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's palace is an insignificant oblong building two stories high. It faces north and is situated midway between the first two ponds on nearly the highest point in the fort. It has served as barracks for European troops who used to be quartered in the fort and since then has been used occasionally by officers of the station as a residence during the hot weather. After the mutiny it was thought necessary to garrison the fort with a small number of European troops, but now for many years this has been discontinued. For the last two years a small\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nFort.\n\nguard of native infantry has been kept in the fort which was recently surveyed for the purpose of considering its value as a defensive position. The nearest hill commanding it is that of Yavteshwar within 3500 yards. All the slopes within 2000 yards are to be cleared of forest and the slopes on the south and north-east, which belong to Aba S\u00e1heb Bhonsle, will be purchased for that purpose.\n\nAbout 1190 the fort is said to have been built by the Kolhapur Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra chief Bhoj II. (1178 - 1193), better known as Bhoj R\u00e1ja of Panh\u00e1la in Kolhapur; and at the time of its building two Mh\u00e1rs, one a boy and the other a girl, are said to have been offered to the place-spirit and buried alive at the west gates. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort was always kept in excellent order by the Bij\u00e1pur government and used as a state prison. Here were imprisoned Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1bibi widow of Ali Adilsh\u00e1h I. (1557 - 1580) in 1580 and Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n a Bij\u00e1pur nobleman in 1592. Shiv\u00e1ji captured it after a three months' siege in September 1673. It was besieged by Aurangzeb and taken after five months' siege in April 1700, but retaken in 1706 by a stratagem. Chand\u00e1s\u00e1heb, son of the Naw\u00e1b of Arkot, was confined here on his capture by the Mar\u00e1tha force which invaded the Madras Karn\u00e1tak in 1747. Since 1749 it was used as a prison for the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra when under the dominion of the Peshw\u00e1s. Once only did the R\u00e1ja rise in 1798 and used the fort as a stronghold, but finding it destitute of provisions he surrendered to Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u Patvardhan who took possession of it. The Peshw\u00e1s occupied it till the 7th February 1818 when it surrendered to General Smith after scarcely any resistance.\n\nHistory.\n\nThe earliest mention of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra appears to be in the reign of the fourth Bahmani king Muhammad Sh\u00e1h (1358 - 1375) when with other forts S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort is said to have probably been built. In 1579 the Bij\u00e1pur minister Kishwar Kh\u00e1n falsely accused Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1bibi, the dowager queen, of instigating her brother Murtaza Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h king of Ahmadnagar, to invade Bij\u00e1pur, and sent her a prisoner to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra after subjecting her to many indignities. But in the same year on Kishwar Kh\u00e1n's fall Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1bibi was released. In 1592 Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, the Bij\u00e1pur regent, was sent a prisoner to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where shortly after he died. In 1673 after the capture of Parli Shiv\u00e1ji laid siege to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort which had been kept in good order by the Bij\u00e1pur government, and took it after a siege of several months. In 1686 Shirze Kh\u00e1n of Bij\u00e1pur, who was sent by Aurangzeb to invade Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed's districts marched towards S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1692 R\u00e1mchandrapant B\u00e1vdekar, one of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m's high officers, fixed his residence at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where by the aid of his head writer Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan he not only attended to every military disposition but regulated the revenue and established order. In 1699, at the recommendation of R\u00e1mchandrapant, R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m made S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the seat of the Mar\u00e1tha government. In 1700, while the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were directing all their preparations towards the defence of Panh\u00e1la in Kolhapur, Aurangzeb appeared suddenly before the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and pitched his tents to the north on the site of Karanja village.\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Ferishta, II. 325 - 326.\n2 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 148.\n3 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 150.\n4 Briggs' Ferishta, III. 172-173.\n5 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 116.\n6 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 151.\n7 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 166.\n8 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 172.\n\u00c1zam Sh\u00e1h, Aurangzeb\u2019s son, was stationed at a village on the west side which has since borne the name of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur. Shirze Kh\u00e1n invested the south side and Tarbiyat Kh\u00e1n occupied the eastern quarter; and chains of posts between the different camps effectually secured the blockade. The fort, with provisions hardly enough to stand a two months\u2019 siege, was defended by Pry\u00e1gji Prabhu Hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r who had been reared in Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s service. He vigorously opposed the Moghals and disputed every foot of ground as they pushed forward their advanced posts. As soon as they began to gain any part of the hill he withdrew his troops into the fort and rolled huge stones from the rock above which did great execution and, until they threw up cover, were as destructive as artillery. In spite of Pry\u00e1gji\u2019s efforts the blockade was completed, all communication with the country round was cut off, and as the small stock of grain was soon exhausted, the besieged must have been forced to surrender had not Parshur\u00e1m Trimbak Pratinidhi, who had thrown himself into the fort of Parli, bought the connivance of \u00c1zam Sh\u00e1h and brought provisions to the besieged. The grand attack was directed against the north-east angle one of the strongest points with a total height of sixty-seven feet of which forty-two were rock and twenty-five masonry. Tarbiyat Kh\u00e1n undertook to mine this angle and at the end of four months and a half completed two mines. The besieging party was so confident of success that Aurangzeb was invited to view the spectacle, who marched from that side in such a grand procession that when the match was ready, hundreds of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and among them Pry\u00e1gji, drawn by the splendid retinue, crowded to the rampart. The first mine was fired. It burst several fissures in the rock and caused so violent a shock that a great part of the masonry was thrown inwards and crushed many of the garrison in the ruin with Pry\u00e1gji the commandant, who was afterwards dug out alive. The storming party in their eagerness advanced nearer when the match was applied to the train of the second and larger mine, but it was wrongly laid and burst out with a dreadful explosion destroying about 2000 Moghals on the spot. Pry\u00e1gji\u2019s escape was considered a lucky omen, and under other circumstances might have done much to inspirit the garrison to prolong the defence. But as \u00c1zam Sh\u00e1h could no longer be persuaded to allow grain to pass into the fort, proposals of surrender were made through him, and the honour of the capture, which he so ill deserved, was not only assigned to him but the place received his name and was called by the emperor \u00c1zam T\u00e1ra.\u00b9 About this time the news of Raj\u00e1r\u00e1m\u2019s death, which happened a month before the fall of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, was received in the emperor\u2019s camp with great rejoicing.\u00b2 In 1706 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was surprised and re-taken from the Moghals by Parshur\u00e1m Trimbak Pratinidhi by the artifice of a Br\u00e1hman named Ann\u00e1jipant. This man, who had escaped from prison at Ginji in Tanjore and assumed the character of a mendicant devotee, fell in with a party of Moghal infantry marching to relieve the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra garrison. He amused them with stories and songs, obtained alms from them\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 174-175; Elliot and Dowson, VII. 367-368.\n\u00b2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 175.\nand so ingratiated himself with all that they brought him with them, admitted him into the fort, and, in reward for his wit, allowed him to live there. Ann\u00e1jipant who had been a writer attached to a body of M\u00e1vli infantry saw that, with the aid of a few of his old friends, the place might be surprised. He watched his chance, told Parshur\u00e1m Trimbak of his design, and having introduced a body of M\u00e1vlis into the fort the enterprising and remorseless Br\u00e1hman put every man of the garrison to the sword. In the confusion which followed the release of Sh\u00e1hu in 1708 the Pratinidhi took possession of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fort. Sh\u00e1hu, joined by Dhan\u00e1ji his general, sent an order to Parshur\u00e1m Trimbak to surrender S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Parshur\u00e1m disobeyed but Shaikh Mir\u00e1h, a subordinate Muhammadan officer, confined him and gave up the fort. On gaining possession of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Sh\u00e1hu formally seated himself on the throne in March 1708. In the end of 1709 Sh\u00e1hu, who had been out to renew the war, returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and married two wives one from the Mohite and the other from the Shirke family. In 1713 an expedition under the Peshwa Bahiropant Pingle sent from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by Sh\u00e1hu against \u00c1ngria failed. Bahiropant was defeated and taken prisoner by Angria who threatened to march on S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. All the force that could be spared was gathered to oppose him and placed under B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Vishvan\u00e1th whose former connection with \u00c1ngria would, it was hoped, lead to some settlement. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji's negotiations were successful and on his return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in reward for his services he was appointed Peshwa. In 1716 Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v D\u00e1bh\u00e1de defeated two large Moghal armies, went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, paid his respects to Sh\u00e1hu, and was raised to the rank of Sen\u00e1pati or general of the Mar\u00e1tha empire. About 1730 Sambh\u00e1ji R\u00e1ja of Kolh\u00e1pur encamped on the north side of the V\u00e1rna with his baggage, women, and equipments and began to plunder the country. The Pratinidhi surprised Sambh\u00e1ji's camp and took many prisoners, among others T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed, R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m's widow, and her daughter-in-law R\u00e1j\u00e1sb\u00e1\u00ed, the widow of Shiv\u00e1ji of Kolh\u00e1pur who were both placed in confinement in the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1732 B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the second Peshwa assumed the command of the army in M\u00e1lwa, and sent back his brother Chimn\u00e1ji and Pil\u00e1ji J\u00e1dhav to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to maintain his influence at court and to concert measures for settling the Konkan which was in a very disturbed state.\n\nDuring the Peshwa's absence K\u00e1nhoji Bhonsle, the Sena Saheb Subha, was accused of disobedience and confined at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Shripatr\u00e1v Pratinidhi, who was a friend of K\u00e1nhoji, endeavoured to obtain some mitigation of his sentence, but failed, and the brave K\u00e1nhoji died, after having lived there many years a prisoner at large. In 1735 after B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's successful return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra from his campaign against the Sid\u00eds of Janjira, he was appointed Subhed\u00e1r of the late acquisitions. On receiving the news of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's death in 1740 Chimn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa and his nephew, who were in the Konkan, returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra after the usual mourning.

Raghuj\u00ed offered large sums to Sh\u00e1hu on condition of B\u00e1puji's being raised to the vacant Peshwaship. The Pratinidhi, although averse from the supremacy of the Peshwa, was still more hostile to the pretensions of Raghuj\u00ed and, as he did not engage in the intrigue, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v aided by his uncle Chimn\u00e1ji was at last invested in August 1740. On the 26th of March Trichinopoly was taken by Raghuj\u00ed and Chanda S\u00e1heb the well known aspirant to the Madras Karn\u00e1tak Naw\u00e1bship, was brought a prisoner to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where he remained in the custody of an agent of Raghuj\u00ed Bhonsle till he was set free in 1748. On the death of his uncle Chimn\u00e1ji \u00c1pa, which happened in the end of January 1741, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji Peshwa returned from the northern districts and spent nearly a year in civil arrangements at Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and obtained from Sh\u00e1hu a large grant of territory and revenues. In 1743 after his Bengal campaign B\u00e1l\u00e1ji returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, paid his respects to Sh\u00e1hu and went through the form of producing his accounts of the revenue which were made up by himself as a general in command of a body of the R\u00e1ja's troops. In 1749 Sh\u00e1hu died but not without a great trouble about his succession and the grant of a deed to B\u00e1l\u00e1ji empowering him to manage the whole government of the Mar\u00e1tha empire. Scarcely had Sh\u00e1hu ceased to breathe when a body of horse galloped into the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, surrounded and seized the Pratinidhi and his deputy Yam\u00e1ji Shivdev, placed them in irons, and sent them off strongly escorted to distant hill forts. Every avenue about the town was occupied by troops and a garrison of the Peshwa's was placed in the fort, while a party was selected to reinforce the escort of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja who had not arrived when Sh\u00e1hu died. After making arrangements at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, B\u00e1l\u00e1ji left (1750) for Poona and henceforward S\u00e1t\u00e1ra ceased to be the capital of the Mar\u00e1tha empire. R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja who had accompanied Bh\u00e1u, the Peshwa's cousin, to S\u00e1ngola in Shol\u00e1pur, agreed to renounce the entire power and to lend his sanction to whatever measures the Peshwa might pursue provided a small tract round S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was assigned to his own management, conditions to which B\u00e1l\u00e1ji subscribed but never fulfilled. The R\u00e1ja under a strong escort returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The Peshwa in order to conciliate T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m's grandmother, whose great age did not render her less active and intriguing, incautiously removed his troops from the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and having placed in it the gadkaris and old retainers, who had great respect for T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, gave up the entire management to her. The R\u00e1ja was kept with a separate establishment in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, but perfectly at large and a splendid provision was assigned to him and his officers, the expense of which amounted to the yearly sum of 65 l\u00e1lks of rupees.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 255. Chanda S\u00e1heb was better known in the Deccan by his less familiar name of Husain Dost Kh\u00e1n. He does not appear to have been confined in the fort nor to have endured a close confinement.

On the back of a hill was a fine fortress with walls that looked like a hill as the rocks were used as a wall. On this wall of rock worked with the chisel was raised a wall of stone nine yards high. The fort had rich springs. It was taken by Aurangzeb but went back to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\nIn 1751 after the Peshwa left for Aurangabad T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i finding R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja unfit for her purpose sent messengers to Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r to march to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to rescue the R\u00e1ja and the Mar\u00e1tha state from the Br\u00e1hmans. Dam\u00e1ji at once acted on this request, and T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, as soon as certain accounts were received of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s approach, invited the R\u00e1ja into the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and made him prisoner. Trimbakpant Purandhare, Govindr\u00e1v Chitnis, and other of the Peshwa\u2019s officers at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra were at first disposed to ridicule this attempt of T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i as that of a mad old woman. But on hearing of Dam\u00e1ji\u2019s approach from Songad fort on the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r-Kh\u00e1ndesh frontier they quitted the town and collected troops at the village of Arle seven miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The next day they were defeated by Dam\u00e1ji who went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to pay his respects to T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i and several forts in the neighbourhood were given to her. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was well stored with provisions and the Pratinidhi promised to aid T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i\u2019s cause. News of these proceedings recalled B\u00e1l\u00e1ji. In the meantime Dam\u00e1ji was totally defeated and sent a messenger to treat with B\u00e1l\u00e1ji. B\u00e1l\u00e1ji solemnly agreed to abide by the terms proposed by Dam\u00e1ji and enticed him to encamp in the neighbourhood. As soon as B\u00e1l\u00e1ji got him into his power, he took him a prisoner and sent him to Poona. The Peshwa then tried to induce T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i to give up the fort and the R\u00e1ja. Some of the Peshwa\u2019s troops were impressed with the idea that T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i was a dev or good spirit and others that she was a daitya or evil spirit, but the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s thought that she was a rightful regent. Under these circumstances B\u00e1l\u00e1ji thought it safe to leave her unmolested. T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i confined R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja in the fort in a damp stone dungeon giving him food of the coarsest grain. During the absence of B\u00e1l\u00e1ji in Aurangabad T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i occupied the districts of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and W\u00e1i and a large force was sent to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to starve her into submission. Anandr\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav, the commandant of the fort, convinced of the folly of resistance formed the design of carrying the R\u00e1ja out of her power. On learning this she ordered him to be beheaded and appointed one B\u00e1bur\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav, a person unconnected with the late commandant, to the command of the fort. In 1753 the Peshwa on his march to the Karn\u00e1tak sent to assure T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i that, if she would submit, the control of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s person and establishment should remain at her disposal. To this T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i would not listen unless B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v would come to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, acknowledge her authority, and give such personal assurances as would satisfy her, but on assurances of safety and protection from the Peshwa she left the garrison of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the custody of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja\u2019s person to B\u00e1bur\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav and repaired to Poona. In 1772\n\n---\n\n1 Description Historique et Geographique de l\u2019Inde, I, 487.\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 274.\n3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 275.\nafter M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v's death, his younger brother N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v repaired to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra where he was invested as Peshwa by the R\u00e1ja. But in the same year N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v was murdered and Amritr\u00e1v the adopted son of Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v attended by Baj\u00e1ba Purandhare was sent to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra for the robes of office for Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v, which were accordingly given.\\(^1\\) In 1774, after the birth of a son and heir to Gang\u00e1b\u00e1i widow of N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja sent the robes of the Peshwa's office for her son in charge of M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Nilkant from whom they were received by Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m B\u00e1pu and N\u00e1na Fadnavis who were deputed by Gang\u00e1b\u00e1i for that purpose.\\(^2\\) At the close of 1777 R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja died at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra having previously adopted a son of Trimbakji R\u00e1ja Bhonsle a p\u00e1t\u00edl and a descendant of Vithoji the brother of M\u00e1l\u00f3ji, the grandfather of the great Shiv\u00e1ji. In a revenue statement of about 1790 S\u00e1t\u00e1ra appears as the head-quarters of a pargana in the Nahisdurg sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000).\\(^3\\) During the whole of 1792, owing to the dread that Mah\u00e1dji Sindia intended to make the R\u00e1ja an instrument for suppressing the Peshw\u00e1s and Br\u00e1hmanical ascendancy, N\u00e1na Fadnavis almost entirely confined the R\u00e1ja to the fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, where not even his relations were allowed to visit him. After M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v II.'s suicide in 1795 disorder prevailed in Poona for a time and Daulatr\u00e1v Sindia advanced with an army.\\(^4\\) N\u00e1na Fadnavis repaired in alarm to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with some idea of restoring the R\u00e1ja to supremacy. But owing to his recent treatment of him, Sh\u00e1hu had no confidence in N\u00e1na and N\u00e1na retired to W\u00e1i. From W\u00e1i he returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra to receive the robes of investiture for Chinn\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1pa the Peshwa set up by Sindia's general B\u00e1loba T\u00e1tya as a rival to Baj\u00edr\u00e1v Raghn\u00e1th, but suspecting designs against him on the part of B\u00e1loba he remained at W\u00e1i.\\(^5\\) In 1798 Sh\u00e1hu rose and used the fort as a stronghold, but finding it destitute of provisions he surrendered to Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u Patvardhan of T\u00e1sgaon. In the last Mar\u00e1tha war on the 8th of March 1818 the united army of General Smith and General Pritzler went to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the fort surrendered on the 10th. The British colours were hoisted but only to be replaced by the Bhagya Jhenda or ochre-coloured standard of Shiv\u00e1ji. In accordance with Mr. Elphinstone's manifesto R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh was established in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Captain Grant Duff, the author of the History of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, was placed with him to aid his councils and direct his conduct. On the 29th of March Mr. Elphinstone rode with the R\u00e1ja through the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra valley to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, which Prat\u00e1psinh entered with the pomp of a prince and the delight of a school-boy.\\(^6\\) After taking V\u00e1sota the British army returned to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, having on their way reduced the fort of Parli. Strong military forces were stationed at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kar\u00e1d. Shortly after a conspiracy was discovered for the release of Chatursing, the murder of all Europeans at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Poona, the surprise of some of the principal forts, and the possession of the R\u00e1ja's person. The plot was suppressed and some of the conspirators executed. A treaty was made on the 25th of September 1819 under the terms of which Prat\u00e1psinh\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 359, 362.\n\n\\(^2\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 368.\n\n\\(^3\\) Waring's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 240.\n\n\\(^4\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 521.\n\n\\(^5\\) Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 524.\n\n\\(^6\\) Colebrooke's Elphinstone, II, 30.\nwas formally installed ruler. He supplied the city with Yavteshvar water and built some large public offices and a fine palace and pleasure grounds. On the 5th September 1839 R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1psinh was deposed for treason against the British Government. His younger brother Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji was appointed his successor. He built and supported a civil hospital and schools and was liberal in expenditure on roads bridges and other public works, especially the city water-works. He also finished the magnificent court-room and buildings known as the New Palace. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji died in April 1848 without issue and on financial military and political grounds it was decided to annex the state.\n\nDuring the 1857 mutinies no outbreak occurred at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra but evidence was discovered of a widespread conspiracy only a week before the date fixed for the rising. Prompt measures were taken against any attempt at rising and on the 6th of August 1857, by order of Government, Sh\u00e1hu the adopted son, the two R\u00e1n\u00eds of Prat\u00e1psinh, the adopted son of B\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1h\u0113b Sen\u00e1pati, and a cousin of Sh\u00e1hu were removed for confinement to Butcher's Island in Bombay Harbour. Guns were taken to and pointed on the palace in the early morning and the family were removed in closed carriages. Sh\u00e1hu was afterwards allowed to return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nShingn\u00e1pur, north latitude 17\u00b0 50' and east longitude 74\u00b0 42', in M\u00e1n thirteen miles north-east of Dahivadi the sub-divisional headquarters, is a famous place of pilgrimage situated in a nook of the Shikhar Shingn\u00e1pur hills. The hill, crowned by a temple of Mah\u00e1dev to which the village owes its celebrity, appears at a distance like the point of a very obtuse-angled cone. It is the highest point for many miles and can be seen all the way from Dahivadi and from other parts of the M\u00e1n sub-division. It is reached by a poor local fund road unbridged and undrained. But the main difficulties, namely the negotiation of the precipitous sides of the two valleys of the M\u00e1n and one of its tributaries, are made surmountable by passes, though not of the best, and the surface is passable for tong\u00e1s or pony carts and country carts. The rains too are so light and intermittent in this part of the district that little difficulty would be experienced in visiting Shingn\u00e1pur even during the monsoon, after reaching the irrigation bungalow of Gondvale three miles south-east of Dahivadi. Nine miles north-east on the Shingn\u00e1pur road will be met the village of V\u00e1varhira in one of the M\u00e1n ravines and here may be visited a curious old temple of Mah\u00e1dev on the right as the eastern pass is ascended. The temple on the site of a fine spring is very rude but probably old. Six miles further north-east is Shingn\u00e1pur. The tower and lamp-pillar of the great temple stand out distinct flashing against the glory sky. The hills look hopelessly bare and wretched. A mile from the village the road takes a turn to the south-east and then again resuming its north-east course runs through an opening of what now turns out to be a cluster of hills into a space opposite the municipal bungalow. The road turns again at right angles to the westward and makes for the temple steps and a very pleasant camp is reached opposite a municipal rest-house.\n\n---\n\n1 Details are given above pp. 311-314.  \n2 Details are given above pp. 316-319.\nneighbourhood is studded with tamarinds on all sides, and consists of a basin of land, shut in with low round-topped hills except at the south-east where is an opening, occupied by the village itself and some more mango and tamarind trees. At the foot of the eastern hills and the lowest point of this basin lies a great pond, T-shaped, the cross stretching north and south, and the stem, which is very short, to the west. Except where there are openings the pond is completely enclosed by walls. The walls are highest and strongest at the opening before mentioned where they constitute a masonry dam to the streams which would otherwise pour their waters away from these hills in a south-easterly direction. The depth of water in the pond in January 1884 was said to be eight feet. The wall at this part was quite ten feet out of the water and therefore probably twenty feet high at least. Its breadth here, as everywhere else, is about five feet, while nowhere does the masonry appear to have given way. The flood-mark of the water appears at four feet from the wall top; but the leakage from the pond is very great. On the south where lies the village is a set of bathing gh\u00e2ts or steps. These, with the solid and square built houses of the village which give it almost a fortified appearance, have a very picturesque aspect viewed from the north end of the pond. The wall is everywhere studded with projecting stones to enable bathers or others to climb up and down. At the east end is a sluice through which water is let out to garden lands; while in the north-east corner and at the centre of the north bank are two water-lifts by which water is drawn from wells dug in the sides of the pond. The pond covers an area of about forty acres, and were it made properly water-tight would apparently hold a good deal of water. This is curious as the catchment area is very small indeed, and the rainfall light and capricious. There is also no side of the pond left open letting in rain torrents. Any such waters must either filter in under the wall or get in through the small openings which are placed haphazard and at intervals for the entrance of bathers and the like. Thus the pond would seem to have been formed merely to retain whatever water fell immediately over it, and from that point of view it certainly holds a surprising amount. Soil has accumulated behind the walls which block the chief water-courses and thence are formed the plots on the north and north-east irrigated by the water-lifts, while on the west is a similar accumulation of soil which produces excellent grass till late in the hot weather. To reach the temple the way passes west of the camp along the municipal road. After about two hundred yards, the first hundred of them on a rude pavement, begin the steps very rough and varying in breadth. After the first thirty steps comes a small temple of Mah\u00e1dev standing right in the centre of the causeway. It is a small modern temple about fifteen feet long by six feet broad and ornamented with a small tower. A little further on is a small shrine of Khadkeshvar Mah\u00e1dev and from here an ascent of one hundred and fifteen steps, the last few of them rather steep, leads to the first gateway. This gateway was built about a hundred and fifty years ago by a Dhangar of N\u00e1jhra village ten miles southwest of S\u00e1ngola in Shol\u00e1pur, and consists of a rectangular building forty-two feet high, forty-one feet two inches broad, and fifteen feet nine inches thick,\nwith a single pointed arch about thirty-two feet high and fourteen feet ten inches cut through it. The building has a flat wide roof and stone eaves, about two feet broad and resting on twenty-two brackets, project horizontally from it. In the side walls of the arch are chambers seven feet square and about six feet high vaulted and with sides open to the west and to the interior of the large archway. Each contains the image of an elephant roughly worked in stone, and from each staircases lead up to the roof. Two-thirds of the way up are arched windows looking east. The threshold is a foot high from the ground, and at the centre is a cylindrical block girded with a coil of ornamental chain work raised in relief. This seems intended to receive the bolts of folding doors which should have been fitted to the archway. On each side of this block are two rough bits of carving which may be intended for the satyr-like masks usually placed at the entrance of temples and public buildings. Water is always poured on the centre block by worshippers. On the outer or eastern side are two platforms or plinths one on each side of the entrance eleven feet two inches long and thirteen feet eight inches broad and three feet nine inches high. The whole building is made of small rectangular blocks of stone roughly cut and set in mortar. Immediately inside the arch on the left hand is a small niche containing a rough slab of black stone which is an image of M\u00e1ngoba the god of the M\u00e1ngs, who are supposed to approach the great temple only so far. The causeway now passes up between lines of houses. The steps for some sixty yards are very broad and the rise is scarcely felt. It then steepens for about another 150 steps till the second gateway is reached which forms the entrance to the court-yard of the great temple. This gateway the court-yard and the temple itself were built by the great Shiv\u00e1ji (1627-1680). The lower gateway is rather larger than this but a mere copy of it. This gateway is thirty-four feet wide, thirty-eight feet high, and thirteen feet thick. The arch is pointed as on the lower gateway and is about twenty-six feet high by fourteen feet two inches broad. There are windows in the front and eaves to the roof as in the lower gateway. The eaves rest on twenty brackets. On the front, about twenty feet from the ground, four lotus-like ornaments are cut in relief, two on each side of the arch. The inside ornaments are on the left wall a relief of three knotted cobras and on the right one of Krishna riding on a five-headed cobra. As in the lower gateway there are vaulted chambers on the sides with stone elephants, one of which is evidently an object of worship. There is also in the centre the raised threshold with a cylindrical block decorated with chain work and flanked with mask-like ornaments. Eleven more steps lead to the terrace on which the temple court is built. About ten yards to the right of these is a chamber built in the terrace which contains the footprints of Mah\u00e1dev, and forms the limit to which Mh\u00e1rs are allowed to approach. The terrace is ascended by about twenty steps cut in the masonry the rise of each step being about one foot. The walls on each side of this entrance are over eight feet above the level of the courtyard and were evidently intended to support another arch which however was never built. On the left of this entrance is a projection with five small lamp-pillars or dipm\u00e1s. These steps lead on to the south-east end of the court.\nImmediately on the right is the largest and finest lamp-pillar, not less than forty feet high. It is made of cut-stone well set together and the innumerable branches for holding the small lights are shaped each with a graceful curve upwards, while the small base and fine tapering of the column gives it a light and elegant appearance, which contrasts finely with the other clumsy structures round it.\n\nThe court is about thirty-seven yards long east to west by twenty-seven yards broad and paved throughout with large rectangular slabs of trap. Its walls vary in height from six to eight feet. There are four entrances, one noticed above at the south-east, another from the north at the north-west corner, a third from the west and overlooking the edge of the hills rather north of the middle of the western side, and the fourth from the south at the middle of the southern side of the court. The second of these is a mere rectangular opening in the terrace wall, not more than five feet high. It communicates directly with the temple of Bali Mah\u00e1dev.\u00b9\n\nThe third is an archway similar to Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s archway outside the eastern entrance, and communicates with a basil altar and two small temples at the very edge of the cliff where the marriage ceremony of the god is celebrated during the fair. The courtyard wall on each side of this gateway has been made into small cloisters with a promenade on the top. The horses belonging to the god are kept in these, and other parts are used for dwelling and storing purposes by the temple establishment. The southern entrance is about ten feet broad and communicates with the tombs of R\u00e1ja Sambh\u00e1ji and two other celebrities and a group of buildings situated on the southern end of the ridge on which the temple stands. There is no archway here but a small rest-house has been built on the right just outside this entrance; while on the left is a well about twenty feet in diameter and twenty feet deep surrounded with a wretched plaster parapet. This entrance is flanked by two large and rather ugly lamp-pillars. Between this and the eastern entrance in the south-east corner of the court-yard is the music-chamber or nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na where the daily service of pipes and drums is performed.\n\nIn the centre is situated the great temple itself. In front of it is a canopy with four pillars and a flat roof about six feet square and ten feet high in which, upon a plinth three feet high, is a stone Nandi. Two bells, with the date 1720 in Roman letters engraved on them and probably brought from some Portuguese church in the Konkan, hang from the roof. A special interest may be said to attach to this temple, at least to the whole of its stone work, as although built by the great Shiv\u00e1ji and therefore not much more than three centuries old, the ancient Hem\u00e1dpanti style has been adhered to throughout its structure and it seems likely from a comparison with the remains of the original temple which this was intended to replace, that this temple must have been in great part a restoration, though perhaps an enlarged one, of the original structure. The style seems to be exactly the cut-corner Ch\u00e1lukyan both in the centre hall or mandap and shrine or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra and matches closely with that of the temple of Bali Mah\u00e1dev which is both said\n\n\u00b9 See below p. 586.\nto be and evidently is Hem\u00e1dpanti. The remains alluded to lie just inside the southern entrance on the way to Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed\u2019s tomb. There are parts of the eaves of the pillars, brackets, the cross beams, all enormous slabs of stone evidently put together without mortar. The pillars and brackets show carvings of exactly the same pattern and in some cases decidedly superior in workmanship to that of the pillars belonging to the present structure. The designs of the eaves and roofing were evidently exactly the same. The modern workmanship however is unusually good, and very different from the imitations of Hem\u00e1dpanti work in other parts of the district. The work was carried out by a banker named Balvantr\u00e1v to whom Shiv\u00e1j\u00ed furnished the funds. The mandap is nearer cruciform than anything else, while the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra is almost star-shaped. The whole pile stands on a solid stone plinth with overhanging rims. The plinth projects everywhere three feet beyond the rest of the building and is three feet high. The roof of the mandap is not supported by walls, but by pillars originally eighteen, though now, owing to the numerous cracks in the roof, many small pillars of the poorest workmanship have been put up as additional props. The roof overhangs the outer pillars by some three feet with heavy stone eaves. The pillars, including the capital brackets, are nine feet six inches high. But the sides are partly filled up by a sort of balustrade five feet two inches high. Three feet from the ground on the inside of this is a seat two feet wide and running round the mandap. The inside of the balustrade is curved so as to form a comfortable lean-back, while the whole arrangement is in solid stone. But the only support given to the roof in all this comes from the embedding of the lowest three feet of fourteen out of the eighteen pillars in the stone work of the bench. The other four pillars form a square in the middle of the mandap under which are placed three Nandis covered with brass and copper and of poor workmanship. The pillars are remarkably handsome. Excluding the brackets which support the roof the shafts are seven feet nine inches high each made out of a single block of stone. This is cut in five sections, the first section or basement being rectangular, two feet square by one and a half high. On this is another rectangular block one foot eight inches square and two feet two inches high. The third is an octagon one foot eight inches in diameter and one foot five inches high. Upon this is another rectangular block, base two feet square and height one foot three inches. Upon this is a cylinder, one foot eight inches in diameter and one foot five inches high. The carving on the fourth section consists of figures in bas relief representing a variety of subjects, dancing, eating, duelling, a great deal of hunting and fighting, but little if any of mythological subjects. In one women are represented tiger hunting. Generally the animals hunted are the boar, tiger, rhinoceros, and the animal used for hunting the dog. The favourite weapon in fighting and hunting is the spear though in several the bow appears. In one fighting picture a man is shown using a gun. The other sections are carved with floral and bead patterns. Here and there the work is pierced, and all is beautifully defined and clear cut. The brackets rest on the upper section of the shaft and branch out on four sides about two feet out from the centre. They are solid blocks of stone, shaped like\nfemale torsos. The faces are fairly well carved, but without particular expression in the features. The brackets support horizontal stone beams, on which the roof consisting of flat stone slabs is placed. Inside the space between the centre pillars has been carved into a flat dome. In the spaces between the other pillars the roofing is cut into a favourite pattern made by three slabs one below the other. Each side of the rectangular space formed by the beams is bisected by the corners of a lozenge cut out of the centre of the first slab, while the second slab has a square cut out of its centre similarly inscribed in the lozenge of the first. The third or top slab is ornamented with a disc in the centre florally carved in relief. The mandap roof is flat on the top and surrounded by a plain parapet about a foot high. It has four small shikhars or spires one in the centre about six feet high of plain stone and pyramidal in shape. The other spires are of about the same height canopy-shaped and made of painted stucco, elaborately ornamented, and situated one on each outer side and one on the front wing of the mandap. The g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra is surmounted by the great spire of the temple which is about sixty feet high. It is a twelve-sided pyramid, with the usual kalash or urn-shaped ornament at the top, now much broken down and a great disfigurement. It is in eight storeys, gradually lessening in size, and giving the effect of steps up the sides. At the four sides are a sort of arms which run up as far as the kalash. Their summits are pointed and curve inwards towards the tower, suggesting the idea of four cobras erect with their faces inward. The spire is made of brick covered with stucco. The whole is elaborately carved and painted especially in front where the structure is brought on to the roof of the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra vestibule. The twelve faces of the first two storeys contain niches mostly containing images of Hindu deities in relief. Above this the remainder is nearly all ornament mostly of a sort of rail pattern with various fanciful decorations. The style of the whole resembles that of the towers which crown the southern gopurs,\u00b9 and it was very probably like the rest of the temple a copy of something more ancient.\n\nTo the south of the temple, about a hundred yards along the edge of the hill, lies a block of buildings which includes three mausoleums. They are in a line facing southwards and on the east and west sides the building projects beyond the edge of the hill and is built up by strong masonry walls in places over thirty feet high. The centre mausoleum is of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji the father of Shiv\u00e1ji. It consists of three divisions separated by plain pillars with pointed arches in front. It is eighteen feet six inches long thirty feet broad and about eight feet high. On the west is the mausoleum of Shiv\u00e1ji and Hir\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed of Kolh\u00e1pur nine feet long by twenty-five feet broad and seven feet nine inches high with similar pillars. To the east is the chief mausoleum, of Sambh\u00e1ji the son of Shiv\u00e1ji, nearly fifty feet long by thirty-six feet broad. The mandap is divided by ten pillars into five divisions and leads to a shrine with a ling in its case or sh\u00e1lunkha. The court is flanked on the east by cloisters in\n\n\u00b9 The gopur is a large and lofty gateway. Compare the Gadag gopur in Bombay Gazetteer, XXII. 716.\neight pointed arches fifty-eight feet long by eight feet deep and about seven feet high. Deep windows are pierced in the walls, which are over four feet thick. Sambhaji was executed by Aurangzeb in August 1689, and this mausoleum was afterwards set up to him by Shahu.\n\nNext to the great temple, or perhaps even greater in interest, is the temple of Amriteshvar, known as Bali Mahadev. It is reached direct by a road which turns off to the right from the steps about a hundred feet below the great temple; or it can be reached from the great temple by the south-east gateway. About twenty yards further on a turn to the right leads down twenty small steps to the chief gateway, an archway of the ogee pattern about twenty-five feet high and otherwise similar to the main gateways of the great temple. The temple is in a courtyard eight feet below the level of the gateway and more or less in a pit. It may be described as a miniature of the great temple, though of far ruder and plainer workmanship. The walls of the courtyard are very large blocks of stone, here and there repaired with mortar. The central hall or mandap, with the shrine vestibule, forms a rectangle from which there are three porches on the west north and east. The g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra or shrine is on the south. The sides of the mandap are open and the roof is supported by the pillars, which, including the outer pillars of the porches, are sixteen in number and form thus three divisions or khans. The southern division is the vestibule to the shrine and is closed up all but a narrow door in the centre. The pillars are shaped as those in the great temple and the roofing inside is of the same pattern. The carving though well executed is much less elaborated. Affixed to the vestibule by a closed passage is the shrine or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra star-shaped and much as in the great temple. The mandap and vestibule are about forty-two feet long by thirty-two feet broad, and the extreme length and breadth of the g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra about twenty-three feet. The spire is modern and covered with stucco work in apparent imitation of the main temple though it is locally believed to be of the same age with the temple. This pattern of ornament is a sort of rail and tooth work. The tower is ten-storeyed and about forty feet high. As in the larger temple there are also arms at the four sides bending over the top of the tower like erect cobras. There is a small pyramidal stone turret in the centre of the mandap which is disfigured by an ugly urn or kalash with which it is surmounted. The towers of this temple are grossly disfigured by whitewashing, and the stucco painting has entirely faded. The roof and eaves are of stone slabs, adorned and worked as in the larger temple. There are special festivities during the festival of Shivrditra in February-March. The great fair or jatra is held from the bright fifth to the full-moon of Chaitra in March-April. The attendance varies sometimes reaching 50,000. In 1876 it was probably not much less as the municipal pilgrim tax was farmed for \u00a3220 (Rs. 2200) which implies an estimated attendance of over 35,000. During the fair the masks of the god are paraded in procession. The offerings at the fair are almost solely in money. Some of them are made for the benefit of the temple. These are administered by a committee appointed by Government. The\nworship, however, is conducted by Badve Br\u00e1hmans and Guravs who receive many private contributions from the visitors. The permanent income of the temple from alienated villages and other sources is \u00a3269 5s. 6d. (Rs. 2692\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)) and this is all spent in establishment and the Shiv\u00e1tra festivities.\n\nGreat care is taken as to the sanitary arrangements during the great fair. Government provides a hospital assistant at the expense of the municipality. Sweepers and trenches are provided for latrine purposes and care is taken to prevent the water from pollution. Some excellent wells have been dug in various parts of the locality, notably one the gift of Ahaly\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed Holkar the great temple-building princess of Indore (1735-1795). The usual small merchandise is sold at the fair. The transactions are valued at about \u00a35000 (Rs.50,000).\n\nThe municipality, which was established in 1857, had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3460 (Rs. 4600) and an expenditure of \u00a3228 (Rs. 2280). The name Shingn\u00e1pur would seem, almost certainly, to have been derived from the Devgiri Y\u00e1dav king Singh\u00e1n whose name so often occurs in the district.\\(^1\\) The village was subsequently conferred as a hereditary possession by one of the Gh\u00e1tges on Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji Bhonsle, father of Shiv\u00e1ji the great (1627-1680),\\(^2\\) whose devotion in building the Mah\u00e1dev temple is thus explained. The neighbourhood is some of the wildest part of the Mah\u00e1dev range, named no doubt from this temple, and has been the resort of turbulent characters from the earliest times. In January 1817, after having effected his escape from the Th\u00e1na jail where he was confined, Trimbakji Denglia retired to the Shingn\u00e1pur hills and collected 1800 men in the neighbourhood. But in April 1818 the operations of General Smith\u2019s force drove the insurgents from their haunts in Shingn\u00e1pur.\\(^3\\)\n\nShir\u00e1la, \\(16^\\circ 59' \\text{ north latitude and } 74^\\circ 11' \\text{ east longitude, in V\u00e1lva is a petty divisional head-quarters about nine miles south-west of Peth. The town lies on the V\u00e1rna valley local fund road on a stream which flows into the Morna a tributary of the V\u00e1rna about a mile lower down. On three sides are bare hills with broken and undulating ground in the neighbourhood. Besides the petty divisional revenue and police offices Shir\u00e1la has a branch post office and a vernacular school. A weekly market is held on Monday. About three quarters of a mile south-east of the town and reached by a good causeway lined with trees is a grove called Gorakhn\u00e1th or more correctly Gorakshn\u00e1th after the presiding deity an incarnation of Shiv. The grove is chiefly of fine old tamarinds and is frequented in large numbers by peacocks, whose lives are carefully respected and which are fed with grain thrown them by the Gos\u00e1vi devotees who reside in the math or monastic house in the grove. The image of the presiding deity is a large stone, like a millstone, placed on the north side of a gigantic old tamarind of the species known as Gorakh \u00c1mli. A remarkable property is attributed to this tree. Its bark is scored everywhere in every direction by natural lines and cracks. These are supposed to be characters written by the deity in an unknown tongue and every K\u00e1nph\u00e1ta devotee coming to worship there gets his name\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See above pp. 455, 465, 487.\n\n\\(^2\\) Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 133 and note 2.\n\n\\(^3\\) Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 631, 633.

A fair in great local repute is held in the month of Chaitra or March-April and is attended by many Lingayat V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and other people. Shir\u00e1l\u00e1 is famous for its brass lamps or samais, and except being the residence of a very large capitalist named Shinde, who has most of the old landholding families of the neighbourhood in his debt, has but little trade. The town is surrounded by mud walls and was in Mar\u00e1tha times a fort of some strength and not unfrequently attacked during the wars on the Kolh\u00e1pur frontier. A hereditary officer of some dignity was always stationed at Shir\u00e1l\u00e1 for the administration of the surrounding tract and custody of records. The petty divisional office is a strong building of stone with gates flanked with small bastions.\n\nShirval\\(^1\\) on the north-west border of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district in the territory of the Paut Sachiv, fourteen miles north of W\u00e1i, has a group of fifteen early Buddhist caves. The caves are from two to three miles south-west of the Shirval travellers' bungalow at the head of a short narrow valley on the eastern slope of a spur from the M\u00e1ndhardev range of hills which bound the Nira valley on the south.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe caves face north-east and are of the same severely plain type as all the earliest caves. Six of them on the south side of the ravine are small excavations filled up with rubbish. Of the remaining nine the first is a small chapel cave, 20' 3\" deep by 14' wide and square at the back with, 3' 3\" in front of the back wall and 4' 6\" from the sides, a plain relic-shrine 5' 3\" in diameter, surmounted by a plain capital of four three-inch fillets, the uppermost 2' 6\" square. The door is 5' wide, but the whole floor is so silted up that no part of the interior is more than 5' 6\" high. The second excavation, perhaps the most imposing of the series, has been a dwelling cave or vih\u00e1r of which the whole front has disappeared with one of the cells on the right side. It has been about 26' square with three cells on each side and in the back.\\(^3\\) Round the hall runs a bench up to the level of the top of which the floor is filled with dry mud. Of the nine cells which vary from 6' to 7' in depth and from 5' 9\" to 6' 3\" in width and are about 6' 6\" in height, seven have the usual stone benches and four have small window openings, a foot square with a counter-sunk margin on the outer side. The rock in which this cave has been cut is somewhat softer than the rest and the partitions are here and there broken down, more especially near the mouth of the cave. The third is apparently a natural irregular cavern 17' deep and only about 3' 6\" high. The remaining four caves in the lower tier and two in the upper are more or less irregular apartments much ruined by the decay of the rock. One of them has at its back two cells with benches.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Fergusson and Burgess' Cave Temples of India, 212; Major Lee's MS.

See above M\u00e1ndhardev, p. 523.\n\n\\(^3\\) The floor of the centre of the hall is lower than the cell floor and the 2' 6\" passage in front of them. This central part is filled with clay silt but it is locally believed to have been originally a cistern. Major H.

A very steep scrambling ascent of about a quarter of a mile especially the last fifty feet, with a few steps made here and there, leads to a platform of rock, twenty yards east of which is the cave. Conspicuous from a long distance is the whitewashed temple of Kamalbhairi which blocks up the southeast end. The cave, most of it a natural excavation about forty feet long by thirty feet deep, contains an oblong pond (11' x 10') of good water with steps leading down at its east end. West of the cave is a small artificial-looking chamber evidently used as a temple of Mah\u00e1dev with a linga. About ten feet further on is another small pond. The temple is a modern structure, measuring about twenty-five feet by ten feet. The temple consists of a small hall and a shrine, the hall with six feet high pillars in three courses, rectangular cylindrical and octagonal, supporting a stone roof. The shrine is a square chamber with a stone roof on which is reared a conical mortared superstructure of brick and mortar with a kalash or urn on the top. The temple is said to have been built about 1730 by R\u00e1mr\u00e1v Bhagyant of Chander near Chikodi in Belgaum. A fair attended by from 1000 to 2000 people and lasting for three days is held on the dark fourteenth of M\u00e1gh or February-March. The image of Kamalbhairi is carried in a p\u00e1lkhi or litter procession all through the fair night. T\u00e1k\u00e1ri has an irrigation bungalow.\n\nTa'mbi village lies on the right bank of the Koyna about sixteen miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra with which it is connected by the \u00c1mba pass an old pack-bullock path over the lofty D\u00e1tegad spur which forms the eastern wall of the valley. It is on the main bullock track from Helv\u00e1k up the Koyna valley to Mah\u00e1baleshvar and has been a market village from early times. It formed the head-quarters of a small petty division or administrative centre, probably connected with V\u00e1sota fort.\n\nTamkane, a small hill village three miles north-west of P\u00e1tan, has, in a hill to the west, two small Buddhist caves, a chapel, and a dwelling cave. The village is easily reached by the bullock-path from P\u00e1tan up the Kera valley. A climb of a quarter of a mile up the bed of the chief stream leads to the two caves which are on either side of it. Both the caves are of the plainest type and entered from the east. The chapel or chaitya 16' long by 12' broad and 8' high contains at the west end a relic-shrine or d\u00e1gghoba 9' in circumference and surmounted by an umbrella capital. Almost adjoining the chapel, on the other side of the stream, is the dwelling cave or vih\u00e1r 19' long by 17' broad and 9' high. At the north-west and south-west corners are two small chambers five feet square. Adjoining the south-west chamber is a bench two feet high. The caves would appear to be of the same period as the early Buddhist caves at Kar\u00e1d, but there are no sculptures or inscriptions giving any clue as to their probable date.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Compare Fergusson and Burgess' Cave Temples of India, 212.\nTa'rgaon village, with in 1881 a population of 2687 or an increase of 375 over that in 1872, lies on the left bank of the Krishna seven miles south of Rahimatpur. A cleared local fund track connects T\u00e1rgaon with Masur and Kar\u00e1d, and T\u00e1rgaon is one of the proposed stations on the West Deccan Railway thirteen miles south of Koregaon. It was formerly a place of some importance being a kasba or market town, and the head-quarters of a revenue sub-division. It is now nothing more than a well-to-do agricultural village with a vernacular school.\n\nT\u00e1rla, about ten miles north-east of P\u00e1tan is an alienated village with in 1881 a population of 4117. It is the chief village in the valley of the T\u00e1rl\u00ed and has one or two traders of considerable capital dealing chiefly with Chiplun. A good local fund bullock track connects it with P\u00e1tan. There is another short cut to Helv\u00e1k passable for bullocks and ponies passing by Nivkane, Karvat, and Vajegaon. The T\u00e1rl\u00ed valley grows a great deal of sugarcane and groundnut most of which comes to the T\u00e1rla market before export to Chiplun. A weekly market is held on Saturday. The village has a vernacular school in an excellent building. The water-supply of the town is taken from an excellent spring in a small tributary of the T\u00e1rl\u00ed, over which a temple of Mah\u00e1dev has been built. The temple is neither old nor noteworthy, but the spring is very good. The water is collected in small stone tanks to which sullage drains are attached.\n\nThe village is alienated to the Mah\u00e1d\u00edk family, a Mar\u00e1tha house of distinction and one of the branches of which was connected by marriage with the line of Shiv\u00e1ji. During the 1857 mutinies a member of the Mah\u00e1d\u00edk family was concerned in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra plot, and his share in the family possessions was confiscated. The neighbourhood of T\u00e1rla has been considered a fit site for one of the large irrigation schemes. It is proposed to make here a storage pond which will increase the supply for the Krishna canal and give enough water for another canal on the right bank.\n\nT\u00e1sgaon, 17\u00b0 2' north latitude and 74\u00b0 40' east longitude, the head-quarters of the T\u00e1sgaon sub-division, is a municipal town of 10,206 people sixty-four miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra by the direct S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road. A far more convenient route is by Kar\u00e1d only two miles longer. Travellers' bungalow accommodation and a metalled road are to be had as far as Kar\u00e1d sixty-two miles, and from Kar\u00e1d thirty-four miles of a first class local fund murum road. Sixteen miles along the road is the irrigation bungalow at T\u00e1k\u00e1ri. The town is on a slight rising ground on the north bank of a stream which flows into the Yerla about four miles to the south-west. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-T\u00e1sgaon road crosses the Yerla three miles west of T\u00e1sgaon. Except during the rains its bed is perfectly dry. In the rains the floods last but a short time, but are very sudden. The water-supply of the town is taken from the stream above mentioned and from private wells. The wells are liable to pollution by soakage, but the water of the stream is good and tolerably abundant at all seasons. The 1872 census showed a population of 10,528 of whom 9644 were Hindus and 884 Musalm\u00e1ns. The 1881 census showed a decrease of 322 or 10,206 of whom 9282 were Hindus, 920 Musalm\u00e1ns, and\nfour P\u00e1rsis. T\u00e1sgaon has about 150 traders mostly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rv\u00e1r Guj\u00e1rat and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, Jains, Telis, and Musalm\u00e1ns. The traders buy from the growers cotton, tobacco, raw sugar or gul, and earthnuts, and send them to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Shol\u00e1pur, Poona, and Chiplun, and from Chiplun bring in exchange salt, piece-goods, dates, silks, sugar, metals, and spices. As there are no steam-presses, cotton, which is the chief article of export, is loosely packed, and loses much in quantity and quality. Besides the subdivisional revenue and police offices T\u00e1sgaon has a sub-judge's court, a municipality, and a dispensary. The revenue and police offices to the east of the town in a good grove of b\u00e1dhul trees with a small garden and good well are held in an excellent set of buildings built on the government standard plan. The court is held in a native building in the centre of the town. The dispensary, which is in charge of a hospital assistant, was founded in 1876 and treated in 1883 three inpatients and 2867 outpatients at a cost of \u00a393 (Rs.930). The most common diseases were malarious fevers, rheumatic respiratory and skin affections. Cholera occurred in the town and vicinity in April and May 1882 with thirty-eight cases and sixteen deaths. The attendance of patients at this dispensary is remarkably small in proportion to the large population. The municipality contribute \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and Government an equal sum. The municipality founded in 1867 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3439 (Rs. 4390) and an expenditure of \u00a3342 (Rs. 3420). There are four schools, one anglo-veracular, one Mar\u00e1thi, one Hindust\u00e1ni, and one for girls with an attendance respectively of 143, 111, 83, and 87. The municipality contribute \u00a31 (Rs. 10) a month to the English class. There is a native library with most of the vernacular prints, to which the municipality contribute 12s. (Rs.6) a year. Conservancy arrangements are carried out by sweepers and the sweepings deposited in dust-bins and conveyed outside the town for burial.\n\nThe town was originally surrounded by walls the remains of which are still seen. There are four gates of which the Bhilavdi gate is the entrance on the west of the town from the T\u00e1sgaon-Bhilavdi and Ashta local fund track. Pursuing the road at a turn on the right is the dispensary. Another fifty yards on is the school on the left or north side of the road. On the south side is the large mansion of the T\u00e1sgaon Patvardhan family. A street crosses this road at right angles close by the school. This is the Somv\u00e1r Peth and contains the Somv\u00e1r gate, similar to the Bhilavdi gate. Turning south through a winding continuation of the Somv\u00e1r street is reached the great temple of Ganpati. Here again the road turns east, passing through a large gateway crowned with the nag\u00e1rkh\u00e1na or drum-chamber, and having on its north side in a house built for it the triumphal car of the god. After about a hundred yards east through a broad street lined with shops, comes another cross street the Guruv\u00e1r Peth. It runs from north to south, and, a quarter of a mile up it, a turn to the east leads to the subdivisional office. The streets of T\u00e1sgaon, more especially the Guruv\u00e1r Peth and the hundred yards east from Ganpati's temple, are unusually broad and the whole town is better off for space than native towns usually are. One of the largest capitalists in the district has a house here, with corresponding establishments in Poona. The great\ntrade of the town is cotton which is warehoused here for exportation by Chiplun. There is also a considerable grain trade. The chief buildings are the Patvardhan's mansion and the temple of Ganpati also built by the Patvardhans. The mansion of the Patvardhan family is a set of buildings of the ordinary native type, with front and back courts and the private dwelling house between with several verandas. It is situated in an enclosure about 360 feet square surrounded by mud and stone walls from twenty-two to thirty feet high on the outside, twenty feet on the inside, and ten feet broad all round. There are three chief gates, a small one about thirty feet from the north-west corner and two large ones at the centre of the north and east corners. They are lofty archways fortified on each side. The northern gate was built by the greatest of the Patvardhans, Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u, who flourished at the end of the eighteenth century, and is often mentioned in his Indian Despatches by General Arthur Wellesley afterwards the Duke of Wellington. He left by this gate to his last battle (1799) where he was defeated and slain. In grief at his loss the gate was blocked up and remains so still. The stabling ran along the inside of the north wall. The most strongly fortified is the eastern gate which is flanked by thick walls, and commanded by three towers on the southern side. The four corners of the enclosure and the centre of its southern side are surmounted by bastions. A small temple is near the north-west gate, and a well near the centre of the western side. The temple of Ganpati was begun in 1779 by Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u and finished in 1799 by his son Appa. It consists of an image-chamber and a hall of plain but finely worked stone. The image-chamber is thirty-one feet by twenty-nine feet and the hall forty-five feet by thirty-four. The image-chamber has a spire thirty-four feet high from the ground, flanked by two smaller ones eight feet shorter. These are all of brick and rather tastefully decorated stucco. The hall consists of a nave with two aisles made by two rows of pillars with plain rectangular shafts. In front of the temple, with a ten feet space between them, are shrines of the bull Nandi and the man-eagle Garud twenty-one feet high including the pinnacles. They consist of open canopies six feet square and crowned by pinnacles eight feet high. The courtyard is paved with drains and gutters and has a wall ten feet high with a promenade on the top. Part of the pavement is interrupted by tree and flower beds. The entrance to this courtyard contains the most striking object in the building, a gateway formed by a masonry arch surmounted by a tower of the form so frequent in Southern India and known as the Gopur.\u00b9 It is seven-storeyed, gradually tapering till the top storey is a mere ridge. The outer ends curve towards one another like the hoods of the cobra; while at the centre is a pointed urn or kalash. The lowest storey measures thirty-seven feet two inches from north to south, and twenty-nine feet from east to west. The whole is ninety-five feet five inches high, and the kalash and curved arms are seven inches higher. The lowest storey is of stone and the rest of brick\n\n\u00b9 See above p. 585 and note 1.\ncovered with coloured stucco carved into images of gods and goddesses. On each side are stairs for ascending the gopur with openings in the centre of each storey. The top storey gives a capital bird's-eye view of the surrounding country and of T\u00e1sgaon itself. East of the gopur is another lower gateway about thirty feet high with a nag\u00e1rv\u00e1h\u00e1na or drum-chamber on the top, and on the north side is the triumphal car of the god used on festival days. Walking away east from this gateway and looking back the gopur appears to rise gradually behind the gateway, and looks much like a huge snake rearing its head above the entrance to the town.\n\nIn 1730 T\u00e1sgaon is mentioned as one of the villages which were ceded by Sambhaji R\u00e1ja of Kolhapur to Sh\u00e1hu of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1708-1749). About 1758 the French scholar Anquetil du Perron notices T\u00e1sgaon as a great walled town protected by towers and a ditch. The country round was pretty and tilled. In the reign of the fourth Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v (1761-1772) T\u00e1sgaon and its neighbourhood were taken from Kolhapur and added to the Peshwa's territory as j\u00e1girs of the Patvardhans. In 1777 they were temporarily recovered by Kolhapur, but Mah\u00e1dji Sindia succeeded in preventing their permanent loss. In June 1790 Major Price notices T\u00e1sgaon as having recently risen to importance. The palace was a respectable if not a handsome structure, and Parshur\u00e1m was trying to beautify the town. Near the palace was a neat temple of Ganpati. In 1799 the Kolhapur forces attacked and pillaged T\u00e1sgaon, then the capital of Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u's j\u00e1gir and burnt his palace. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices T\u00e1sgaon as belonging to the Patvardhans with 1610 houses 266 shops and wells. During the 1857 mutinies, to overcome the Southern Mar\u00e1tha chiefs and to check the rising which it was thought might follow the annexation of the Patvardhan chief's territories on his decease without male issue, troops were stationed at T\u00e1sgaon. No disturbance occurred and the troops returned at the beginning of the fair season of 1858.\n\nTa'tha'vade or Santoshgad hill fort lies in the north-west corner of the M\u00e1n sub-division, about twenty miles north-west of Dahivadi the sub-divisional head-quarters. The way lies through hills and broken country unsuitable for travelling and care should be taken in attempting to visit it from any part of M\u00e1n above the Mah\u00e1dev range. The fort lies barely twelve miles south-west of Phaltan, and can be easily approached from any part of that state or the small corner of M\u00e1n below the Mah\u00e1dev hills. From S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the easiest way is twenty miles to Pusegaon village on the Pandharpur road and thence a ride of eleven miles north-west through the villages of L\u00e1lgun and Diks\u00e1l over a barren and stony but easily traversable country to the edge of the Mah\u00e1dev range. There is a well defined track all the way, manageable by a tonga or pony cart in the fair season. From Diks\u00e1l the road makes for a detached hill on the north-west a few hundred yards beyond which is the edge of the gh\u00e1ts which support the table land of the Khat\u00e1v sub-division about a thousand feet above the plain. These gh\u00e1ts stretch from north-west to south-east and San-\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 224.\n2 Zend Avesta, I. ccxxv.\n3 Memoirs of a Field Officer, 193.\n4 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 547.\n5 Itinerary, 33.\ntoshgad fort stands on a hill about half a mile from the main range but connected with it by a neck of hill about 500 feet high which meets in its turn a spur three or four hundred feet higher. The ascent to the fort is in two ways, either by the main track down to T\u00e1th\u00e1vade village at the foot of the fort riding the whole way; or, to save much climbing, the main track can be left for a small path leading to the spur above mentioned. A rough path down a ravine north of this spur runs along the face of the hill on to the neck above mentioned, and faces the south-west angle of the fort. This path continues in a northerly direction and under the walls of the fort right up to the main entrance which is on the northern side. The fort is roughly triangular in shape. The hill on which it stands is a little lower than the main range. The apices of the triangle are north-west north-east and south-east making it nearly equilateral. At the foot on the northern side lies the village of T\u00e1th\u00e1vade with 787 people nearly all cultivators mostly Kunbis with a few Br\u00e1hmans. The traders and most of the R\u00e1moshis have left the place since the abandonment of the fort about 1849. The defences consist of three walls, the top wall going all round the hill and forming what may be called the citadel. It surmounts a perpendicular scarp of black rock about thirty feet high, and is itself about fifteen feet higher. In thickness it is quite twenty feet and had originally a parapet about six feet high and three thick, all of which has broken down. It is made of laterite blocks from one to two cubic feet each, and solidly set in mortar, lined with small stones and mud. It is carefully provided at intervals with secret escape doors for the garrison should the fort be successfully taken. It is especially strong at the three angles from which project triangular outworks about sixty feet lower than the citadel. The outworks are of unequal size, but built of the same materials and more strongly even than the citadel. The sides of the south-west outwork are not more than thirty yards long but it is perhaps the most solid of the three; the sides of the north-east outwork are about fifty yards, and those of the north-west outwork about seventy yards long. The first two outworks communicated with the citadel by a small door not more than two feet wide built through the walls, which led on to the steps cut in the scarp. The citadel wall has a gap at the north-west angle which formed the communication with the north-west outwork. On the north-east side of this was the main gateway about five feet wide, also made of laterite, of beautifully cut massive masonry. It faced east and was sheltered by a projecting bastion. This the north side of the hill was partly protected for about a hundred feet by two lower walls or terraces the one below the other with bastions at intervals. They are of much lighter workmanship than the citadel and its outworks, the face being of small rectangular trap blocks in rough mortar and the lining of uncut stones and mud. These walls both run east and west along the entire length of the northern face of the hill. They then turn through an angle of over 90 degrees, and are taken up the hill to meet the walls above them. The upper of the two is broken by a gateway of trap facing east, like the upper gateway, similarly sheltered, and otherwise like it, but of far less strength and of much rougher workmanship. The lowest\nwall is divided by a gap of full thirty feet in the centre flanked by two strong bastions, but no gateway. The ascent between these three entrances and from the north-west outwork on to the citadel is by a winding path with steps at intervals where, not unfrequently, the naked scarp of the rock has to be surmounted. The steps are nearly everywhere broken down and the way generally blocked with prickly pear. The above description will show that the hill was unprotected below the citadel and its outworks on the south-west and south-east sides, and that elaborate care was taken to protect the north side. There seems to be no especial reason for this difference except that the entrance and therefore the weakest point of the citadel was on the north side. By making the two gateways face east and protecting them with projections of the wall their assault was impeded while it was impossible to hit them directly with cannon shot from the plain below, which, according to tradition, was a special point in the fortification of the day. In sieges it was apparently the fashion to direct a cannonade first against the gate and to provide a force to rush through if the besiegers succeeded in bursting it. The difficulties of elsewhere penetrating or escalading hill forts such as these were probably and not wrongly thought insuperable, bribery and stratagem apart.\n\nThe citadel is not more than about 600 yards round and its area not much more than twenty acres. There were originally but few buildings. The head-quarters or sadar was a building about fifty feet by thirty feet including its two ot\u00e1s or verandas. It opened to the north and besides accommodating the treasury was used as a sort of court-house for the subhed\u00e1r in charge of the fort. Next to it on the west was a stone building about forty feet by twenty with walls three feet thick, and a roof on the south side made of brick coated with cement. It contained three chambers for storage of grain treasure and gunpowder. The east chamber still remains. Immediately south of the east chamber is the great pond cut some sixty to seventy feet down into the rock, and the sides smoothed off with great care. It holds a tolerable supply of water, but is fed by no spring. It is about twenty-five to thirty feet square and has steps on the eastern side leading down to the water's edge. Halfway down at a landing and turn of the steps is a small temple of T\u00e1toba Mah\u00e1dev from whom the fort takes its name. This large pond is apparently the only source of the water-supply of the citadel. It has been much choked with silt, and is said to hold much less water than before, much probably leaking down through the laterite. The rest of the citadel is so blocked with prickly pear that no other buildings can be distinguished. The hill top has room only for very few. One is a mosque for Musalm\u00e1n sepoys. Its north-east walls have fallen from disrepair and the south-west walls partly by the same cause, and partly when hit by the shells of the English. The north-east outwork has some buildings while, inside the two lower walls, are others all in ruins. Outside the lowest entrance is pointed out the side of the elephant-house fit for not more than two beasts. On the saddleback between the southern angle and the main range of hills has been cut a gap with remains of buildings said to have been the grass stacks.\nof the fort. The grass was supplied chiefly from lands on the plateau above the Mah\u00e1dev range and brought for storage to this spot. It is more than two hundred yards from the fort and is hardly more convenient than the village itself which is at least as accessible as the fort. Immediately inside and directly facing the lowest entrance is a large cave pond. Its mouth has been almost wholly blocked with rubbish. A descent of some six feet is therefore necessary to reach the water. The excavation is partly natural but evidently enlarged artificially. The water is exquisitely sweet and clear. The exact size cannot be made out but the depth of water is at least six or seven feet and the extent of excavation not less than thirty to forty feet square. Three massive pillars appear supporting the roof. The rock is laterite and hence no doubt the abundant supply of excellent water which filters from above. The upper fort is nearly all made of laterite with no traces of quarrying about. It seems therefore not improbable that the ponds were excavated by the fort builders and the stone used for the fort walls. There are four other similar ponds completely blocked up. Their stone and that of the big pond on the top would amply suffice for the external work considerable as it is. The mildew of this laterite is used by the people as a tonic for women after childbirth. It probably contains some principle of iron. It is a belief in the village that the large pond in the citadel and this cave are connected by a passage now choked up, and that a lemon thrown into the water of the one used in former times to appear on the surface of the other. These ponds show that the hill internally is made of laterite with an outer coating of trap, thin at the sides but on the top some forty feet thick. The name of this village is traditionally derived from T\u00e1toba, a sage who took up his abode on the fort hill. The cave pond is said to have been made by him, and the small temple of Mah\u00e1dev in the big pond is named after him. The local tradition is that this fort was built by Shiv\u00e1ji the Great (1627-1680). In 1666 it was in the hands of Baj\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik Nimb\u00e1lkar an ancestor of the present chief of Phaltan and an estate-holder of the Bij\u00e1pur government. In the same year Shiv\u00e1ji after the treaty of Purandhar served under Jaysing the Rajput general of Aurangzeb\u2019s army against Bij\u00e1pur and with his M\u00e1vl\u00ed escaladed T\u00e1th\u00e1vade.\u00b9 The Bij\u00e1pur government again apparently got it back from the Moghals probably by treaty. Shiv\u00e1ji retook it for himself in 1673 and apparently held it ever afterwards though twice in 1675 and 1676 he had to retake the open country in its neighbourhood, the estate-holders of which were always ready to rebel against him.\u00b2 The fort was taken by the Moghals in 1689\u00b3 but was ceded to Sh\u00e1hu in 1720 in the Imperial grants made to him in that year.\u2074 In a revenue statement of about 1790 T\u00e1thora appears as the head of a sub-division in the Nahisdurg sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a3112 (Rs. 1120).\u2075 The fort remained in the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s till 1818 when it was shelled by a detachment of General Pritzler\u2019s army from the plateau and a spur\n\n\u00b9 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 94. \u00b2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 116, 119-120.\n\u00b3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 158. \u2074 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 200.\n\u2075 Waring\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.\nnow pointed out about half a mile to the west. A good many of the buildings and part of the walls are said to have been injured at the shelling. The commandant fled at the first few shots, the garrison followed, and the fort was entered without resistance. Its elaborate design and considerable strength for the times in which it was built may be explained by the fact that it was close to the Niz\u00e1m Shahi frontier and of some importance therefore to the Bij\u00e1pur government while the constant disturbances in the neighbourhood in Shivaji's time would amply account for any additions he made to it. A story goes that the famous dacoit Um\u00e1ji Naik (1827) was resting at a spring in the ravine which leads down to the fort from the plateau, and that a Br\u00e1hman on his way to T\u00e1thvad passed by with a little grain given him in charity. Um\u00e1ji called on him to stand and give up what he had; but when he learnt that it was only grain sent him off in peace, entreated his blessing, and gave him twenty-five rupees.\n\nUmbraj village, with in 1881 a population of 3164, lies on the Poona-Belgaum mail road ten miles north-west of Kar\u00e1d and twenty-four miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra on the right bank of the Krishna just below its junction with the T\u00e1rl\u00ed which is bridged at this point. The M\u00e1nd also flows into the Krishna at this point, and from here a first class local fund road branches to Malh\u00e1r Peth in P\u00e1tan where it meets the provincial road to Chiplun. This continues east to Pandharpur by the Sh\u00e1mgao gorge M\u00e1yni and Kaldhun pass through the \u00c1tp\u00e1di state. East of Umbraj the road is a third class track, carrying only a small local traffic. Umbraj has a large market street flanked with shops running east to west, and one of the oldest and chief banking houses in the district. It was formerly a place of some trade, little of which now remains. There are about twenty-five traders mostly Br\u00e1hmans, Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e1yat V\u00e1nis, and Shimpis. Of these traders the Br\u00e1hmans are generally money-lenders. The V\u00e1nis buy chillies earthnuts and rice from the growers of P\u00e1tan, T\u00e1rla, and Morgiri and send them either to S\u00e1ngli, Miraj or Chiplun, and bring salt dates and groceries in exchange from Chiplun. The Shimpis buy women's robes or lugdis and bodice-cloths or khans at P\u00e1l and T\u00e1rla. The weekly market is held on Monday. The village has a vernacular school and a post office and a thatched bungalow belonging to the engineering department. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices it as a kasba or market town with 150 houses and thirty-two shops.\u00b9\n\nUrun-Isla'mpur, 17\u00b0 2' north latitude and 74\u00b0 20' east longitude, is a double name given to what are really two different quarters of one large municipal village in V\u00e1lva, three miles east of Peth the present sub-divisional head-quarters. It is situated on a very slight rise of hard gravelly ground protruding from the black-soil plain of the Krishna valley. It is the most central place in the sub-division and new offices are being built here for the sub-divisional head-quarters which are to be transferred here from Peth. The 1881 census showed a population of 8949. The Musalm\u00e1n\n\n\u00b9 Itinerary, 34.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces.\n\nURUN-ISL\u00c1MPUR.\n\npercentage is larger than in most S\u00e1t\u00e1ra towns and the name Isl\u00e1mpur shows the fact which is undoubted that the town was at one time a Musalm\u00e1n colony. Urun the Hindu and older quarter is on the east and contains little of note except the shrine or darg\u00e1h of Shambhuappa Koshti. Shambhuappa was a Hindu devotee of the weaver caste, but took for his spiritual director a Musalm\u00e1n saint named B\u00e1va Ph\u00e1n who lived at M\u00e1lgaon in Miraj twenty-eight miles south-east of Isl\u00e1mpur. Shambhuappa used to travel this distance every night for eight years, at the end of which he broke down. The saint touched at his devotion offered to return with him; and Shambhu\u00e1ppa then built the darg\u00e1h in honour of B\u00e1va Ph\u00e1n when he died, and continued to perform devotions at his shrine till his own reputation for sanctity increased. Several miracles are said to have been performed by Shambhuappa. One day, while sitting rapt in religious contemplation, he suddenly informed the bystanders that he had been invoked by a merchant to save his ship, that he had been in the spirit to the ship, and had saved it. As a proof he produced salt water from his bosom. Another trader journeying over the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds met with a tiger but on his invoking Shambhuappa the tiger fled. It is further related that the Musalm\u00e1ns objected to Shambhuappa a Hindu becoming the disciple of their Pir. They met together and challenged him to prove his mission by reading the Kur\u00e1n. He called for some blank paper and off it read the whole Kur\u00e1n. After this test the Musalm\u00e1ns troubled him no more. He was then tested by the Hindus. A covered pot containing flesh was placed as an offering with the view of tempting him to eat the flesh and thereby violate the chief title to sanctity among Hindus. But when he ordered the vessel to be opened the flesh had vanished and Jasminum zambac or mogra flowers blossomed in its stead. This test was not deemed sufficient. Some Jog\u00eds or religious beggars getting jealous of him threatened to carry him off by force if he did not satisfy on the spot their unexpressed desires. He immediately produced two hundred mangoes with rice bread which turned out to be exactly what they had desired, and this notwithstanding that it was the dark twelfth of M\u00e1gh (February-March), nearly two months before the mango season (April-May) commenced. In honour of this exploit a charity dinner is given on that day to all comers. A fair also is held from the tenth to the fifteenth of K\u00e1rtik or October-November and a fine mandap or hall is arranged in the courtyard of the darg\u00e1h, the covering of which is a gorgeous cloth woven and decorated by the various weaver castes of the town. The darg\u00e1h is a square building with a dome and four of the usual small cupolas and contains the tomb of B\u00e1va Ph\u00e1n. Isl\u00e1mpur contains the residence of Sard\u00e1r Anandr\u00e1v Mantri. The residence is in the usual Mar\u00e1tha mansion style but of no special size. It overlooks a pond and is surrounded by a brick wall and moat which probably formed the original Musalm\u00e1n fort of Isl\u00e1mpur. The rest of the town is straggling and poorly built and is badly situated for water. The town has one large moneylending firm and a good many smaller grain and cloth merchants and a large class of weavers. There are about thirty traders mostly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t and Ling\u00e9yat V\u00e1nis, and Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis.\nLarge quantities of tobacco and raw sugar or *gul* are sent to Chiplun and in exchange salt, dates, betelnut, groceries, spices, English and country piece-goods and metals are brought and sold at Isl\u00e1mpur and the neighbouring villages. The weaving industry had formerly several wealthy members but it has now greatly sunk down. The town has always been in difficulties for water which used to be supplied by the large ponds, one on the north side of Urun, a hollow dug in the soil without the aid of masonry, a large well on the outstreets between the two quarters and a stone pond within the fort. All these were originally dependent for their supply on scanty and precarious rainfall, to remedy which, during the 1876 famine, a large dam was built partly out of municipal and partly out of local funds under the supervision of the irrigation department. The municipality, which was established in 1855, had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3318 (Rs. 3180) chiefly from octroi duties and an expenditure of \u00a3339 (Rs. 3390). The dispensary which was established in 1867 treated in 1883 twenty-seven in-patients and 5515 out-patients at a cost of \u00a379 (Rs. 790).\n\nA market is held every Saturday, the chief articles of commerce being cattle and grain. The town, however, is surrounded by large villages which hold similar markets, and the octroi has had the effect of driving the trade away from Isl\u00e1mpur. Notwithstanding this attempts to abolish octroi and replace it by a house tax are obstinately resisted by the municipality.\n\nThe founder of the Mantri family was N\u00e1ror\u00e1m Rangr\u00e1v a native of Kochre in Vengurla in Ratn\u00e1giri. In 1691 he became minister to Dhan\u00e1jir\u00e1v J\u00e1dhav the commander-in-chief of the Mar\u00e1tha army; Seventeen years later (1708) Sh\u00e1hu was making his return to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i, who was then in power, ordered the Sen\u00e1pati to oppose him. Dhan\u00e1ji met him at Kh\u00e9d on the Bhima in Poona. Sh\u00e1hu had but a small following and Dhan\u00e1ji a numerous and well appointed army which Sh\u00e1hu felt there was no chance of passing. He accordingly negotiated with N\u00e1ror\u00e1m the Div\u00e1n to offer a night interview and actually entered Dhan\u00e1ji\u2019s camp in disguise. The Div\u00e1n penetrated the disguise, but instead of betraying his prince he sent him back to his own camp and engaged to exert his influence with Dhan\u00e1jir\u00e1v to prevent a battle. On hearing the exhortations of his Div\u00e1n, who announced that Sh\u00e1hu was the rightful sovereign, Dhan\u00e1ji was anxious to give way but for an oath which T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i had made him swear solemnly on rice and milk. The Div\u00e1n admitted that a battle must be fought, but suggested as a way out of the difficulty to have a sham fight and to fire off the muskets and cannons with blank cartridge. This satisfied the scruples of Dhan\u00e1ji who fought his sham battle, met Sh\u00e1hu, and was confirmed by him as Sen\u00e1pati. The news of this reached T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1i who, thereon, fled to Kolh\u00e1pur, and Sh\u00e1hu took possession of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. After this enmity arose between Dhan\u00e1ji and Sh\u00e1hu and in 1755 Dhan\u00e1ji went south with the army. But N\u00e1ror\u00e1m Rangr\u00e1v stayed behind and adhered to the R\u00e1ja, who rewarded him with the title of R\u00e1jadnya and a yearly allowance of \u00a3400 (10,000 huns). Four years afterwards, in 1759, he was invested as mantri and was given some districts with the administration or mutlak of the sardeshmukhi, and j\u00e1girs, and vatans;\nthe whole of the revenue in\u00e1m quit-rents and sardeshmukhi in Shegaon in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Asangaon and Pangad in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and in the W\u00e1i sub-division the N\u00e1dgaundi claims over the following sammats or sub-divisions Nimb, V\u00e1ghote, Koregaon, Jokhora, and J\u00e1mbulkhora consisting of two per cent of the revenue and two bigh\u00e1s per ch\u00e1hur of land, and on iz\u00e1fat or service tenure the village of Menavli, including the sv\u00e1r\u00e1j and in\u00e1m quit-rents, and the in\u00e1m quit-rents in the following forts, Santoshgad, Vardhangad, Mohangad, Kaly\u00e1ngad, Kam\u00e1lgad, Chandangad, Vandangad, and Vair\u00e1tgad; as saranj\u00e1mt the hukeri contribution from B\u00e1gni in Pandi T\u00e1sgaon, and assignments of mok\u00e1sa, kitta &c. in many other villages. This ancestor was a very religious man who founded in 1769 a religious establishment in honour of Palkeshvar Mah\u00e1dev at Sid\u00e1pur in Kar\u00e1d, as well as at Asangaon in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in honour of Kamaleshvar and Bhim\u00e1shankar at W\u00e1i, and built temples at his native village of Kochre, and gave much land to Br\u00e1hmans. The R\u00e1ja's records were full of testimonies to his success. He died in 1747. His son Ghanashy\u00e1m was then invested as Mantri and Trimbakr\u00e1v was given the sardeshmukhi and dues in Tulj\u00e1pur and the B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t enjoyed by his father. His descendants now live in B\u00e1gni. Ghanashy\u00e1m had his in\u00e1ms confirmed by the Peshwa B\u00e1j\u00e1ji B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, and in 1779 he built a temple at Bhilavdi in T\u00e1sgaon and made a pilgrimage to Benares, performing many charities and building temples and rest-houses. He then became a sany\u00e1s\u00ed or recluse and retired to Benares dying in 1786. His son Raghus\u00e1tr\u00e1v succeeded him. He was born in 1743 and after many good deeds died in 1789. Jayvantr\u00e1v his son succeeded him and died in 1832. B\u00e1jir\u00e1v the last Peshwa unjustly resumed much of his possessions. Raghus\u00e1tr\u00e1v Jayvant, father of the present Mantri, was born in 1806 and was invested as Mantri by Prat\u00e1psinh Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j in 1832. His possessions were curtailed by the invalidation of his title to three villages in Belgaum by the In\u00e1m commission. He bore a high reputation for justice, courage, and good service as Mantri and died at Isl\u00e1mpur in 1874. The present representative of the house \u00c1'andr\u00e1v Raghus\u00e1th is forty-two years old and was made a second class Sard\u00e1r in 1874. He enjoys a gross yearly income of about \u00a31810 (Rs. 18,100).\n\nVaduj, 17\u00b0 34' north latitude and 74\u00b0 31' east longitude, on the Puses\u00e1vli-Shingn\u00e1pur road, thirty-one miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is the head-quarters of the Khat\u00e1v sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 3363. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices on the standard Government plan, Vaduj has a post office and a vernacular school in a good Government building. There is little trade and the place does not seem to have been very important at any time. The Yerla runs close to the south-west corner of the town, and gives an unfailing supply of good water. About a mile north-west of the town is a pleasant camp. In a revenue statement of about 1790 Varuja appears as the head of a pargana in the R\u00e1yb\u00e1g sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a33750 (Rs. 37,500).\n\n---\n\n1 In 1827 Captain Clunes mentions Urun-Isl\u00e1mpur as a post-runner's station with 1500 houses, fifteen shops, and twenty wells. Itinerary, 34.\n2 Details of Camps are given below in Appendix C.\n3 Waring's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.\nVair\u00e1tgad Fort in J\u00e1vli, 3989 feet above sea level, lies nine miles north-east of Medha and six miles south-east of W\u00e1i, on a spur of the main Sahy\u00e1dri range which branches nearly due east for about twenty miles from Malcolm Peth by P\u00e1nchgani. It is a prominent object east of W\u00e1i between the Kh\u00e1matki pass and the gorge by which the mail road passes into the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division. The villages of Vy\u00e1jv\u00e1di and J\u00e1mbulne on the north and Mhasve on the south all touch the fort, the greater part of which is in Vy\u00e1jv\u00e1di. The ascent can be made either from Mhasve village or B\u00e1vdhan. The easiest way is to climb by the gorge separating Mhasve and B\u00e1vdhan up the west face of the hill, along the northern ridge of J\u00e1mbulne village till the hamlet of Vy\u00e1jv\u00e1di is reached lying close beneath the fort gate. The fort is about 1000 feet above the plain and the ascent is about two miles. It would be about half a mile less, but much steeper direct from Mhasve. The fort has a vertical scarp of black rock, thirty feet high, surrounded by about seven feet of wall loopholed for musketry. The lower parts of the wall are of large rectangular unmortared stones. The upper part is mortared and of smaller material. There are remains of the head-quarters buildings and some quarters for sepoys, all modern. Inside the fort are five stone ponds none of them more than forty feet in diameter, and outside is one cave pond. The fort is one of those said to have been built by Bhoj R\u00e1ja the Kolh\u00e1pur Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra chief Bhoja II. (1178 - 1193) of Panh\u00e1la, and its name is locally derived from the Vair\u00e1ts, a wild tribe supposed to have dwelt in this neighbourhood, who were subdued by the P\u00e1ndavs. The fort is partly commanded by the heights of B\u00e1vdhan three miles to the west. The view on all sides is very fine and extends on the west to Malcolm Peth.\n\nAt the foot of Vair\u00e1tgad within the limits of Mhasve village are two banian trees, the larger of them shading an area of three quarters of an acre. The space covered by it is a very symmetrical oval. There is no brushwood underneath, nor aught to impede the view save the stems of the shoots from the parent tree which has decayed.\u00b9\n\nVa\u0301lva, 17\u00b0 2\u2032 north latitude and 74\u00b0 27\u2032 east longitude, a village of 4466 inhabitants formerly the head-quarters of the V\u00e1lva subdivision, lies on the right bank of the Krishna eleven miles south-east of Peth and seven miles east of Isl\u00e1mpur. A feeder flows into the Krishna at this point and on its banks and between it and the Krishna is some rocky rising ground on\n\n\u00b9 Murray's Bombay Handbook, 195; the late Mr. E. H. Little, C.S., First Assistant Collector, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; Bombay Literary Magazine, 292-293. Lady Falkland writes (Chow Chow, I. 206-207): The shade was so complete, I could sit in the middle of the day without any covering on my head. The tree was of such a size, that separate picnic parties might take place under it, and not interfere with each other. There were countless avenues, or rather aisles, like those of a church, the pale gray stems being the columns, which, as the sun fell on them, glistened in parts like silver; and here and there were little recesses like chapels, where the roots from the boughs formed themselves into delicate clustering pillars, up and down which little squirrels were chasing each other, while large monkeys were jumping from bough to bough, the boughs cracking and creaking as if both monkeys and boughs would fall on my head.\nwhich the village is built. But the eastern portion close to the river is much subject to flooding, as also sometimes the western which is on the banks of the stream, of which a backwater runs when the Krishna is in flood. A new village site, a quarter of a mile west of the present site, was accordingly granted to this village about 1876 after the great Krishna floods of 1875. The people, however, have taken little advantage of the concession owing to the distance of the new site from the Krishna their sole source of water-supply. A well was sunk at the new site but the supply was found to be of poor quality and precarious in quantity. V\u00e1lva has a vernacular school in a good Government building of the old type, consisting of one single room with a veranda on all four sides. A municipality was established at V\u00e1lva but abolished in 1873 owing to the smallness of its income. Except the mansion of the Thor\u00e1t family of Deshmukhs the village has no remarkable buildings. The family first came into notice under Sh\u00e1hu (1708-1749) and was confirmed in the deshmukhi of villages extending up to Shir\u00e1la, besides receiving saranj\u00e1ms or military grants of several large and productive villages. The deshmukhi dates from the Musalm\u00e1ns. This family must not be confounded with that of the great Dhan\u00e1jir\u00e1v with which it is but distantly connected.\n\nIn October 1659 Shiv\u00e1ji took V\u00e1lva after capturing Shir\u00e1la. The Muhammadans had so depopulated it that a donkey sprang over the walls. The first Pratinidhi and R\u00e1nchandra Pant Am\u00e1tya repopulated it about 1690, when Am\u00e1tya was given the command of Vish\u00e1l\u00edgad and Panh\u00e1la. In 1684 the district was occupied during the monsoon by a Moghal army under Sultan Mu\u00e1zzim who cantoned on the banks of the Krishna. It was then annexed by Sambh\u00e1ji to Kolh\u00e1pur and suffered greatly from the ravages of Ud\u00e1ji Chavh\u00e1n. The Pant Pratinidhi surprised the camp of Sambh\u00e1ji and Chavh\u00e1n, Yashvantr\u00e1v Thor\u00e1t was killed in the engagement, and they were driven to Panh\u00e1la with the loss of all their baggage. This first occasioned the cession to the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra king of the V\u00e1lva district north of the V\u00e1rna and Sh\u00e1hu then placed V\u00e1lva under a th\u00e1na at Isl\u00e1mpur, and gave charge of it to one Kus\u00e1ji Bhonsle. The first noteworthy Thor\u00e1t was Bhonsle\u2019s sarnobat. The charge of the district was given over to him by B\u00e1l\u00e1ji B\u00e1jjir\u00e1v the third Peshwa (1740-1761) and continued in the Thor\u00e1t family till the British annexation in 1818. In a revenue statement of about 1790 V\u00e1lva appears as the head of a pargana in the R\u00e1ybag sark\u00e1r with a revenue of \u00a37500 (Rs. 75,000).\n\nVardhangad hill fort lies on the Bh\u00e1dle-Kundal spur of the Mah\u00e1dev range at a point of it on the boundary between the Koregaon and Khat\u00e1v sub-divisions, seven miles north-east of Koregaon and nineteen miles north-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. It is a round-topped hill rising about 900 feet above the plain below on the west or Koregaon side and about 700 feet on the east or Khat\u00e1v side. The ascent to the fort is from a mdehi or hamlet at its foot on the Khat\u00e1v side. This is easily reached from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road, which winds up\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 225.  \n2 Waring\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 244.\nthe southern slope of the fort hill to a hill close to which on the north lies the fort hamlet. Two large ponds attributed to the Musalm\u00e1ns lie about two hundred yards off to the south of the road. The path from the hamlet takes about half an hour to ascend with ease and goes diagonally up the south slope, till it reaches the middle of the south side where is the only gateway reached by a turn to the south-west. The wall on each side juts out so that the gateway can be sighted only through a very narrow passage from the north-east. It consists of a pointed arch and wooden doorway close outside which is shown the mark of a cannon shot fired when the fort was attacked by Fattehsing M\u00e1ne (1805). The fort is sloping all round from the sides to the top, is round at the summit, and covers about twenty acres. On the east is a hollow, where are two ponds and the site of the garrison\u2019s quarters, now thickly covered with prickly pear, and the buildings in ruins. Only two small guns remain among the rubbish. They were sold for old iron by Government at the annexation, but the purchaser never found it worth while to take them away. His family, it is said, are extinct, and the people firmly believe because he bid for the old guns. The fort has but little scarp, the wall crowning a ridge of black rock protruding abruptly from the sides of the hill which though steep are covered with loose shallow soil. The walls with parapet vary from ten to fifteen feet on the outside, and follow the contour of the ridge, the hollows being filled up with strong masonry. They are about sixteen and a half feet thick with a parapet two feet high on the inside. The height is generally about six feet from the ground close under them. The ground rises so abruptly behind them that at any distance they would give no shelter, and the fort is commanded on the north from a hill in L\u00e1gun, and on the south from the hill of R\u00e1meshvar, each about 2000 yards distant, with perfectly possible ascents at any side. The masonry of the walls is mostly small and put together with mortar only in a few places. The gate and its neighbourhood are the strongest points. Except on the north-west, where it has fallen down considerably, the wall is in fair repair. On the north side was a pond now empty. The east is the only side where water is constantly found, but that in small quantities.\n\nThe fort was built by Shiv\u00e1ji in 1673, and finished in 1674 as an outpost guarding the east frontier of his newly acquired territory. In 1800 the fort, then in the hands of the Pratinidhi, was invested by Mah\u00e1dji Sindia\u2019s force with 25,000 men. The R\u00e1mosh\u00eds in the south-west m\u00e1chi were attacked and killed the horse of Muzaf-farkh\u00e1n one of Sindia\u2019s generals. The m\u00e1ch\u00eds were then sacked and burnt. Further havoc was stopped by the influence of the Sarnobat Ghorpad\u00e9\u2019s wife who was sister to the wife of Sindia. In 1803 Balvantr\u00e1v Bakshi the commandant of the fort fought here a battle with Yes\u00e1i S\u00e1heb Firangi. The fort was shelled, the m\u00e1ch\u00eds sacked, and a contribution of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) levied. In 1805 the fort was attacked by Fattehsing M\u00e1ne. The K\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00ed\u015b and other officers were killed and Fattehsing took many horses in the neighbourhood. In 1806 after the battle of Vasantgad, B\u00e1pu Gokhale brought\nthe Pant Pratinidhi to Chimangaon, a Koregaon village close to the north of the fort, and the fort was then surrendered to him. He administered it for five years till 1811 when the Peshwa took charge of it.\\(^1\\) It appears to have surrendered in 1818 without resistance.\n\n**Va'rugad Fort** in M\u00e1n lies, as the crow flies, about twelve miles north-west of Dahivadi, within the limits of Panvan village. The best way to it is to camp at Pingli Budrukh four miles south-west of Dahivadi and to travel thence by the very rough T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u00e1l road for about ten miles to J\u00e1dhavv\u00e1di, a hamlet of Bijvadi village lying almost a quarter of a mile east and within sight of the road; from here a well marked track due west goes to the village of Tondle, and from Tondle a path leads direct to the fort over rough ground broken but perfectly passable by a pony, and skirting the northern base of the long plateau of Panvan. The direction of the path is generally a little north of west and it crosses innumerable small ravines and water-courses which lead through rough hill tracts to the edge of the plateau of which the M\u00e1n sub-division chiefly consists. These streams pour down the bare sides of the main hill range, here some 1000 to 1500 feet high, on to the plain of Girvi adjoining the Phaltan state. The country all the way from Pingli is terribly bare and rocky. Here the stony hills and ravines are interrupted by fairly level plateaus with tolerable soil and good sites for cultivation and grazing. A few small deer and chinkh\u00e1ra will probably be seen, while cattle are everywhere browsing in considerable numbers. Three hamlets, one of them known as Ghod\u00e1v\u00e1di, are reached, and some well-to-do cultivators will probably meet the visitor and turn out to be Gadkaris or descendants of the ancient hereditary fort garrison. The hamlet is situated on a projection between the two ravines, and has been built on a hill of a truncated conical shape. The hill rises about 250 feet above the level of the plateau, which itself constitutes the summit of the Mah\u00e1dev range at this point. The cone with the walls on it is seen from a great distance and appears very small indeed. But on near approach it is seen to be but the inner citadel of a place of considerable size and strength for the times in which it was built. On the south-west the outer wall or enceinte is entered by a rude gateway of a single pointed arch about eight feet high and five feet broad. As usual there is a curtain of solid masonry inside. The gate lies about 150 yards east of the edge of the plateau, which there terminates in an almost unbroken vertical precipice of several hundred feet in height and receding in a north-easterly direction. No wall was built along about three hundred yards of this part which is absolutely unscalable, but for the rest of the way the walling is continued along the edge of the cliff in a north-east direction for about another three hundred yards. Here it turns still following the cliff to the south-east for another seven hundred yards, and then gradually rounds to the westward covering four hundred and fifty yards more till it meets the gateway. But for the break of the inaccessible precipice this outer wall would form a nearly equilateral\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Papers in possession of the fort Sabnis.\ntriangle with the corners rounded off, the side being of some six hundred and fifty yards. Facing nearly north, about fifty yards from the north-east angle, is a gateway with a couple of curtains in solid masonry. This entrance is cut in the sides of the cliff about twenty feet below the top which is reached by some dozen steps. It consisted as usual of a pointed arch, the top fallen in, about ten feet high by five broad. It leads out to the path down to Girvi a village in the plains below and it probably formed the communication with Phaltan. This road winds down the face of the range for some five hundred feet till it hits the shoulder of a spur which it then follows to the base. The walling on the south side, from the edge of the cliff to some hundred yards east of the southern gate, is not more than a couple of feet in thickness and consists of ill-fitting stones unmortared. The rest is massive and well-mortared and still fairly preserved. The average height is from seven to ten feet. In the south-east angle is a rude temple of Bhairavnath and a few houses with the remains of many more. On the right side of the southern gate is a well preserved stone pond about thirty yards square with steps leading down to it. Next to and on the north of Bhairavnath\u2019s temple is another pond. The way up to the fort proper or upper and lower citadels is from the north side. The path up the hill side, which is steep but with grass and soil left in many places, is almost destroyed. About 150 feet up is the outer citadel built on a sort of shoulder of the hill and facing almost due west. It contains two massive bastions of excellent masonry looking north-west and south-west so that guns planted on them could command respectively the north and south gateways. This citadel was connected with the main wall by a cross wall running across the whole breadth of the fort from east to west. Its entrance lies close below that to the upper citadel. A masonry curtain projects so as to hide the arch itself, which is not more than seven feet high by three broad, and has to be entered from due east. On the south side the walls are carried right up to the scarp of the upper citadel and are some ten feet high, so that to take the lower citadel in rear or flank must have been difficult. The upper citadel is above a vertical scarp some thirty feet high. The entrance to it lies some thirty feet above that to the lower citadel, and is cut in the rock about eight feet wide. There is a gateway of a pointed arch with the top fallen in and twenty odd steps leading up to it and ten more cut out of the rock, and winding up past the inside curtain on to the top. The walls of this upper citadel are still in tolerable preservation. They were originally about ten feet high and built of fair masonry. There is a large turret on the south-west corner, evidently meant to command the southern gate. About ten yards to the east of this turret is a new looking building which was the head-quarters or sadar. Immediately east of this and below it is a great pit about thirty feet square and equally deep roughly cut in the rock and said by the people to be a dungeon. Next it on the south is a small pond evenly cut and lined with mortar used for storing water. There are some remains of sepoys\u2019 houses, and, near the turret, a small stone wheel said to belong to a gun.\nThe outer walls east of the gates have bastions at every turn of the cliffs, and the masonry here is particularly strong and well preserved. It would appear that attacks were dreaded chiefly from the plain below. The assailants could either come up the spur towards the north entrance or they might attempt the spurs on the other side of the eastern ravine and attack the southern gateway. Hence apparently the reason for strengthening the walls of the enceinte on this side. After passing the southern gateway the assailants would be commanded from the lower citadel. They would then be encountered by the cross wall. If that obstacle was overcome the besieged would run round the east side and into the two citadels. The appearance from the fort of the plain in the north is most formidable. It would however be easily captured now. The Panvan plateau completely commands and indeed almost overhangs it. The fort is believed to have been built by Shiv\u00e1ji to resist the Moghals whose attacks he must have dreaded from the plain below. The K\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00ed or Superintendent of the fort was a Prabhu and his descendant a fine strong young man still lives on lands held by him in the neighbourhood: The fort garrison consisted of 200 R\u00e1moshis, Mh\u00e1s, and other hereditary Gadkaris besides sepoys. It was surrendered in 1818 to Viththal Pant Phadnis of the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra left in charge of the town. He detached 200 men to take possession, being part of a force then raised to protect the town from the enterprizes of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v\u2019s garrisons then in the neighbourhood.\n\nV\u00e1sota hill fort in J\u00e1vli is situated five miles west-north-west of T\u00e1mbi, at the head of a small valley which branches west from the Koyna. At the mouth of the valley is a village named V\u00e1sota, but the fort is within the limits of Met Indoli village, and on the very edge of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. It is a flat-topped hill nearly oval in shape and about 800 feet above the valley. The height on the other or Konkan side is probably some 3700 feet. The first clear drop is perhaps 1500 feet, which, Arthur\u2019s Seat excepted, is one of the sheerest on the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. The ascent is made from Met Indoli village. The first half is through dense forest apparently primeval, a block specially preserved to increase the difficulties of approaching the fort. Emerging from this by the path which is here and there cut into steps and gets steeper every yard there is a k\u00e1rv\u00ed grove which is nasty to get through, but quite commanded from the fort. Further on is a perfectly bare piece of rock with rude steps cut in it. This leads to the double gateway at the northern end of the eastern face along a causeway made for about twenty yards on a ridge below the scarp. To enter this the path, here much blocked up with fallen debris, turns right round to the south, and by some fifty steps cut in the rock emerges on to the plateau above. There are three massive masonry arches set in mortar and apparently of Musalm\u00e1n type. The space on the top is some fifteen acres in extent. On reaching the top and turning to the north close by is the temple of Chandk\u00e1i a small plain stone structure. Fifty yards further is a large pond forty feet square and fifty feet\n\n---\n\n1 Elphinstone in Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha War Papers, 245.\ndeep. Beside this is another pond holding good water. It is built of large blocks of dry stone, each block projecting about two inches below the one above, a very ancient type. Further on is a temple of Mah\u00e1dev with an image-chamber and a small hall completely modernised. It has a small whitewashed spire with an urn-like top. There are remains of the head-quarters or sadar a building about fifty feet square with walls about fifteen feet high and three feet thick, modern but of finely hewn stone. The plinth and first three feet of the walls are partly of large dry stone blocks and may be much older. To this building is attached an inner dwelling house or m\u00e1jghar with a court about thirty feet square, on the west of which is the powder magazine. The defences consist of a vertical scarp varying in height from thirty to sixty feet, crowned by a wall and parapet from six to eight feet high and loopholed at intervals. The principal portion of this wall is of huge boulders of dry stone, but it was added to by different masters of the fort, who mostly used mortar and smaller masonry. To the north is a small detached head, used apparently as an outpost. It is connected with the fort by a narrow neck which dips some thirty feet below the general level of the fort. This has been filled up with immensely strong mortared masonry, while the walls of this head, though mostly modern, are in very good condition. The rest are much fallen in.\n\nOn the south of the fort is a gorge, on the other side of which rises what is known as the old fort. This is about 300 yards distant, and, like the hills to the north about 1000 yards distant, completely commands the present fort. Remains of the batteries of the British attacking force are still seen on the brow of the old fort. But there are no other buildings or trace of fortifications on it, nor is any reason given why it is so named. The cliff to the west of the gorge has a sheer drop of 1500 feet if not more. It is known as the B\u00e1bukh\u00e1da and was used as a place of execution for criminals or offenders who used to be hurled down the cliff. The west face of the fort is only a degree less abrupt, and a loose block or boulder of the old wall, if tumbled down the cliff, may be seen bounding from ledge to ledge with increasing violence and speed for an extraordinary distance. The face of the cliff to the south is in three concave stretches and a shout or whistle gives three or sometimes four beautifully distinct echoes. The view to the north is fine, including Makrandgad or the Saddleback and the fine group of steep hills about K\u00e1nd\u00e1t and the P\u00e1r pass. The view south is shut out by the B\u00e1bukh\u00e1da, but the west gives an extensive prospect over the rugged Konkan down to the sea.\n\nThe fort of V\u00e1sota is the most ancient in the hill districts. It is attributed to the Kolh\u00e1pur Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra chief Bhoja II. (1178 - 1193) of Panh\u00e1la and, from the Cyclopean blocks of unmortared trap which form the pond and older portions of the wall, appears undoubtedly to be of great antiquity. The gateway looks Musalm\u00e1n, but it is doubtful whether any Muhammadan ever came so far. The Shirkes and Mores possessed the fort till it was taken by Shiv\u00e1ji in 1655 after the murder and conquest of the J\u00e1vli chief. Shiv\u00e1ji named the fort Vajragad which name it has not retained. Since then it was chiefly used as a state prison. Early after his defeat at Kirkee (5th November\n1817) B\u00e1jir\u00e1v sent the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja and his family into confinement at V\u00e1sota, but before the end of the month the princes were brought away and sent to join his camp on march from Pandharpur to the Junnar hills. The wives and families with him remained till the following April. About the same time Cornets Hunter and Morrison of the Madras establishment, on their way from Haidarabad to Poona with a small escort, were captured by the Peshwa\u2019s forces at Uruli about fifteen miles east of Poona after a manful resistance, sent first to K\u00e1ngori fort in Kol\u00e1ba\u00b9 where they were severely treated and thence to V\u00e1sota. At V\u00e1sota they were lodged in a single room in the head-quarter buildings. A man named Mh\u00e1t\u00e1riji K\u00e1nhoji Chavh\u00e1n looked after them and was rewarded by the British Government for his attentions. Their humane treatment was due to the special orders of B\u00e1pu Gokhale. The British force advanced from Medha by B\u00e1mnoli and T\u00e1mbi, driving in outposts at V\u00e1sota and met at Indoli. Negotiations were opened with the commandant one Bh\u00e1skar Pant, but he obstinately refused to surrender. The British forces then advanced a detachment under cover of the thick forest before mentioned to positions in the k\u00e1rvi grove where they dug shelters for themselves in the hill side. A battery was set up on the old fort. The local story is that negotiations proceeded seven days, when at last it was decided to bombard. The first shot fell over in the Konkan, the next in the powder magazine which it blew up, the third in the temple of Chandk\u00e1i, and the fourth in the middle of the head-quarter on which the commandant surrendered. This is the native account but evidently not true, as, according to Grant Duff, the bombardment lasted twenty hours.\u00b2 The prize property amounted to about \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2 l\u00e1khs) and the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1ja recovered family jewels worth \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3 l\u00e1khs).\u00b3\n\nV\u00e1tegaon in V\u00e1lva is an alienated village of about 2800 people on the banks of a stream called the Bhog\u00e1vati Ganga six miles north-west of Peth. The village lies on both banks of the river and is in charge of a Br\u00e1hman kandv\u00e1sd\u00e1r under the Kurundv\u00e1d chief to whom it belongs. The village has an indigenous school and a liquor shop under the British Government. The streets and roads are better than is usual in villages of its size and there are two or three well off merchants trading in tobacco, raw sugar, and other agricultural produce. On the left bank of the stream, in the west half of the village, are two temples of Lakshmin\u00e1r\u00e1yan and V\u00e1teshvar Mah\u00e1dev. The original portions of the structures are of finely hewn stone and consist of an inner shrine or g\u00e1bh\u00e1ra about ten feet square and dome-roofed. The entrance is by an arch three feet wide and built like the walls three feet thick. There is a cross passage two feet wide and another similar door leading by one step into the outer hall, the vestibule or mandap, which is about fourteen feet square with the corners cut off by oblique canopy-like arches. The roof is also dome-shaped and about thirty feet high all of large stone. Two more steps lead into another mandap with\n\n\u00b9 Compare Bom. Gazetteer, XI. 323, 471-472. \u00b2 Details given above pp. 306-307. \u00b3 Bombay Courier, 18th April 1818.\ngalleries of rough work used for sermons or kirtans and religious stories or pur\u0101ns. The images of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47 and Lakshmi are on a curious stand, consisting of five upright blocks or slabs of highly polished stone each one broader than and ranged behind the other, the broadest behind. The outer corners of each slab are decorated with a carved pendant shaped like a ram\u2019s head. Outside over the g\u0101bh\u0101ra is the usual pyramidal sort of pinnacle about forty feet high from the ground decorated with figures of gods and goddesses but in cut stone instead of as usual in brick. The four corners of the g\u0101bh\u0101ra and inner mandap have smaller pinnacles to match and there is also a central pinnacle to the inner mandap. The court is insignificant but for a fine bit of masonry wall built on the side of a stream. A noteworthy feature of this temple is the use of stone throughout, particularly for the internal dome roofs and pinnacles. The effect internally is striking and the situation on the stream most picturesque.\n\nThe original structure was built by one R\u0101ghopant Joshi a native of V\u0101tegaon village who served as minister or k\u0101rbh\u0101ri to one of the subordinate chiefs of the Nimb\u0101lkar family in the time of N\u0101na Fadnavis (1764 - 1800).\n\nThe V\u0101teshvar temple is a small insignificant building of rough trap and mortar, but it has a strictly pyramidal tower about forty feet high. The court-yard is a hundred feet square and surrounded by ruined cloisters. The walls are of masonry, quite four feet thick, of roughly cut rectangular blocks of trap, each corner flanked with a small bastion. A winding pavement with steps here and there leads up to the entrance which is by an insignificant archway. The temple is beautifully situated at a sudden bend in the stream, and behind it is a magnificent grove of tamarinds perhaps finer than any of their kind in the district. The temple is said to be old but who built it is not known.\n\nVita, 17\u00b0 16' north latitude and 74\u00b0 35' east longitude, forty-seven miles south-east of S\u00e1t\u0101ra, with in 1881 a population of 4477, is the head-quarters of the Kh\u00e1n\u0101pur sub-division, with a municipality, a post office, a sub-judge\u2019s court, and a vernacular school. It is situated at the junction of the T\u00e1sgaon-Mogr\u0101la and Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur roads twenty-six miles east of Kar\u00e1d and eighteen miles north of T\u00e1sgaon with the Yerla river seven miles to the west. The town lies in a slight depression, a bit of rolling ground dividing the valley of the Vita river from the Yerla. Two miles east is a rather more abrupt rise of about 200 feet on to the Kh\u00e1n\u0101pur plateau. The Vita is a small stream which flows into the Yerla at Bh\u00e1lavni seven miles to the south-west. It runs very dry in the hot weather and barely suffices for the water-supply of the town. On its banks are some fine mango trees about the irrigated lands which make a good camping ground. The municipality established in 1854 had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a393 (Rs. 930) and an expenditure of \u00a348 (Rs. 480). It is intended to provide Vita with a dispensary, the only difficulty being about the building. The town has a wall about twenty feet high, of stone for the lower ten feet and the upper ten mud, with gates on the east and west flanked by bastions. The sub-divisional offices are in an old native mansion built against the east wall with a gateway flanked by a strong\nwall. The deshmukhs who live here used to be connected with Bhop\u00e1lgad fort twenty-four miles to the east.\n\nW\u00e1i, 17\u00b0 58' north latitude and 73\u00b0 58' east longitude, on the left bank of the Krishna, twenty-one miles north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, is a holy town, the head-quarters of the W\u00e1i sub-division, with in 1881 a population of 11,626. The town lies fifty-six miles south-east of Poona with which it is connected by a metalled road which branches off from the Southern Mar\u00e1tha Country mail road at Surul seven miles east of W\u00e1i and forty-eight miles south of Poona. W\u00e1i is one of the most sacred places on the Krishna, and has a large Br\u00e1hman population. At the west end of the town the river forms a pool partly by the aid of a stone weir built from the steps about fifty yards above a large temple of Ganpati. The face of the river for half a mile is lined with steps, and for an hour after dawn and before sunset people are incessantly engaged in their ablutions and clothes-washing. The river banks are low and overhung with grass and trees. The country round is beautifully wooded with mangoes, and the Pasarni and P\u00e1ndavgad ranges form a noble background to the smiling valley viewed either from north or south, while to the west the Sahy\u00e1dri range rises blue in the distance, and south the Krishna winds on ever-widening and deepening, its banks clothed with fertility and verdure. The 1872 census showed a population of 11,062 of whom 10,126 were Hindus and 936 Musalm\u00e1ns. The 1881 census showed an increase of 614 or 11,676 of whom 10,698 were Hindus 963 Musalm\u00e1ns and fifteen Christians. Besides the sub-divisional revenue and police offices, W\u00e1i has a municipality, sub-judge's court, dispensary, post office, travellers' bungalow, and about twenty temples. The municipality, which was established in 1855, had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3649 (Rs. 6490) excluding a balance of \u00a3263 (Rs. 2630) and an expenditure of \u00a3704 (Rs. 7040). The dispensary, which was established in 1864, treated in 1883 twenty-one in-patients and 6724 out-patients at a cost of \u00a3117 (Rs. 1170). W\u00e1i is a large trade centre containing about 150 well-to-do traders mostly Br\u00e1hmans, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1tha Kunbis, S\u00e1lis, Koshtis, Telis, K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, and Musalm\u00e1ns. From Bombay and Poona M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis import Bombay and English piecegoods and twist; from Chiplun the V\u00e1nis import salt, betelnuts, dates, and groceries; from Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra the K\u00e1s\u00e1rs import copper and brass pots; from Nahar or Malcolmpeith the Musalm\u00e1ns import potatoes and vegetables; and from B\u00e1vdhan and Surul-Kavtha the S\u00e1lis and Koshtis import small quantities of women's robes or lugdis. Besides importing women's robes from B\u00e1vdhan and Surul-Kartha the S\u00e1lis and Koshtis prepare women's robes, waistcloths, bodicecloths or khans, and other hand-made goods from the twist which they buy from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r V\u00e1nis and sell them to consumers in their houses.\n\nBeginning\u00b9 from above, the first group of buildings is on the north bank of the Krishna, and consists of a gh\u00e1t or steps, a v\u00e1da\n\n\u00b9 The temple accounts are from the MS. papers of the late Mr. E. H. Little, C.S.\nor mansion, and a temple. The gh\u00e1t goes by the name of Gan\u00e1puri and is a flight of twelve steps. The first portion 200 feet long was built of cut-stone by Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1stia in 1789. To this one Bh\u00e1u Joshi added seventy-six feet and B\u00e1jir\u00e1v II. (1796-1817) eighty feet, making now an unbroken length of 356 feet. At the back of the steps is a plain brick wall through which a door opens into the street with the Gan\u00e1puri v\u00e1da now the sub-judge\u2019s court on the left and the temple of Um\u00e1maheshvar Panch\u00e1yatan on the right. The temple on the right like the gh\u00e1t was built by Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1stia in 1784. It consists of a vestibule and shrine and is about forty feet high. It has all the Muhammadan forms of architecture common at the period. In the four corners are separate shrines dedicated to Vishnu, Lakshmi, Ganpati, and Surya. Vishnu\u2019s shrine is on the left on entering and has a wooden hall or mandap, the back wall of which is covered with figures as are also the outer walls. The great cluster of river temples begins at some distance nearly opposite the travellers\u2019 bungalow. The first on a low gh\u00e1t seventy-five feet long is a domed shrine containing a marble Nandi and the image of Dh\u00e1kleshvar Mah\u00e1dev. In a line with it, but near the bank on an upper ledge of the same gh\u00e1t, is the temple of Gang\u00e1-r\u00e1meshvar Mah\u00e1dev built by Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1stia about 1780. It is built of basalt and consists of an open veranda with three scolloped arches and a shrine. The breadth in front is thirty-two feet and the length from front to back about twenty-six feet; while the height, including the dome of brick and stucco with blank panels, is not less than forty feet. In front is Nandi under a plain canopy. The next is a temple of Ganpati built by Ganpatr\u00e1v Bhik\u00e1ji R\u00e1stia in 1762 at a cost of \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000) near a gh\u00e1t 163 feet long built by Ganpatr\u00e1v\u2019s brother \u00c1nandr\u00e1v Bhik\u00e1ji. Besides the usual veranda and shrine, in which is a huge black basalt image of Ganpati painted red, the temple has a covered court or mandap (60\u2019\u00d730\u2019). The roof is flat and composed of square cut-stones cemented with mortar. The walls have the unusual thickness of four feet which gives considerable dignity to the small arches five on a side and three at the end with which they are pierced. Except the dome which is pyramidal or conical and of brick covered with white plaster and fluted, the material used is gray basalt. The total height is over seventy feet.\n\nAscending the bank but hidden from view by the huge Ganpati temple is the K\u00e1shivishveshvar temple perhaps the best group of buildings in W\u00e1i. Surrounded by a wall, the temple stands in a quadrangular court 216\u2019 by 95\u2019. It was built in 1757 by \u00c1nandr\u00e1v Bhik\u00e1ji R\u00e1stia and consists of a shrine and a vestibule with a total length from front to back of forty-nine feet and a facade of about twenty-eight feet from side to side. A notable part of the building is a covered court called kund mandap at the east entrance with a lamp-pillar or dipmal on each side. The mandap is about forty feet square, and its flat roof is of square stone cemented with mortar and supported on sixteen lofty pillars in four rows of four each with neat semicircular moulded arches between them. The pillars about 1\u2019 6\u201d in diameter and about 15\u2019 high, make three parallel arches whether looked at from north to south or from east to west. In the\nstyle Muhammadan forms largely prevail. The spire is twelve-sided with, like the Lakshmi tower, three tiers with rows of figures and a Muhammadan dome; the temple mandap is domed and there are four pinnacles at the corners. The large bull or Nandi in front, under a plain canopy with plain scolloped arches, is carved out of a magnificent piece of black basalt. The bells and flowers with which it is adorned are very beautifully cut. The whole temple structure is of basalt and the pillars originally black are polished to the brightness of a mirror. There is a little ornamentation at the spring of the arches and on the facade but none elsewhere. But the exquisite fineness of the stone work and material and its general lightness make the building the best sight in Wai. The next, away from the river on the east side of the market, is a temple of Mahalakshmi built in 1778 by Anandav Bhikaji Rastia at a cost of \u00a327,563 (Rs. 2,75,630). The temple, about seventy feet high, consists of a vestibule and shrine, which together measure about seventy feet from back to front. The facade is about forty feet from side to side. The vestibule is open in front with two pillars and pilasters in antis. The corners at the top are rounded off by scolloped work. In the floor is a trap door and the roof is formed of large slabs stretching from lintel to lintel. The mandap has two doors on each side, five pillars in depth with two in width, and on a lower step an additional range over a stylobate approached by three steps. The whole looks heavy and dark. The beauty of the Lakshmi temple is its gracefully tapering spire which has a square base with a handsome frieze above which are five dodecagonal tiers surmounted by an urn or kalas. The whole is about fifty-six feet high.\n\nOff the west side of the street leading to the market, in a garden (200' x 100') enclosed by a high stone wall, is the temple of Vishnu built in 1774 by Anandav Bhikaji Rastia at a cost of \u00a321,625 (Rs. 2,16,250). A covered court or mandap (48' x 18') of five round arches, supported by square-based massive pillars five feet thick with a cut-stone roof without intermediate support, leads to a raised veranda with three small Muhammadan Saracenic arches behind which is the shrine. The walls are very thick, with five scolloped arches on each side and three in front. The roof facade is worked in arabesques. The spire is poor, and consists of three octagonal tiers. The whole about fifteen feet high is of beautifully cut gray stone and excepting the spire very handsome. The mandap or hall is the best in Wai. There are ten other temples on the river bank of no special note, eight of them dedicated to Mahadev, one to Dattatraya, and one to Vithoba. The eight Mahadev temples built by various private individuals vary in date from 1740 to 1854. The temple of Dattatraya was built in 1861 by a mendicant named Vyankoba Bava on a gh\u00e1t or landing made in 1785 by Anandav Rastia. The temple of Vithoba was built by Tai Sahib the great-grandmother of the Bhor chief.\n\n1 The pillars supporting the arches are of plated work in beautifully polished black stone.\n2 The temple dates are 1740, 1744, 1760, 1760, 1760, 1808, and 1854. The date of one is not known.\nBesides the temples the chief objects of interest in and about the town are R\u00e1stia\u2019s v\u0101d\u0101s or mansions, an old Peshwa bridge, and Buddhist caves in Loh\u0101re village about four miles to the north. Of R\u00e1stia\u2019s mansions there are several in and about the town. The chief of them is the Moti B\u0101gh in a large garden with water tower and fountains about a mile and a half west of W\u0101i. The mansion was built about 1789 by \u0100nandr\u0101v Bhik\u0101ji R\u00e1stia at a cost of \u00a310,200 (Rs. 1,02,000). The interior walls are covered with paintings whose colour is fast fading away.\n\nThe Peshwa\u2019s bridge is to the south of the town about a hundred yards below the new Krishna bridge. It is said to have been built in the time of the Br\u0101hman government, and the oldest inhabitants of W\u0101i know from hearsay that wayfarers used to cross the river on planks fixed between the piers. There are eight piers remaining but the original number would seem to have been ten. The piers are irregular in size and shape and situated at irregular intervals. They stand on the rock of the river and are mostly nine feet high. They are formed by a wall of rough masonry and excellent mortar built in the shape of an oval. This was filled in with whitewash and stones and plastered over with cement. The piers vary in girth from fifty-six to sixty-nine feet and the short diameters average thirteen feet. The intervals vary from fourteen to nineteen feet. So far as known the bridge was merely built to join W\u0101i with the opposite river bank, and it did not form part of any particular line of communication.\u00b9\n\nFour\u00b2 miles north of W\u0101i, in the village of Loh\u0101re and near Sult\u0101npur, is a group of eight excavations cut in soft trap rock, running from south-east to north-west and facing south-west. The first from the south-east is a plain dwelling cave or vih\u0101ra about 27\u2019 by 21\u2019 with three cells and a pond near it. The second and chief cave has a hall 31\u2019 by 29\u2019 6\u201d and 8\u2019 6\u201d high with a bench along the left side and along parts of the front and back; four cells on the right side with bench-beds and small windows; while in the back are two more similar cells with a d\u0101ghoba shrine between them. The shrine 16\u2019 square had originally a door and two windows to admit light. The capital of the d\u0101ghoba or relic-shrine has been destroyed to convert it into a huge ling 6\u2019 4\u201d high and 8\u2019 in diameter called Palkeshvar or Palkoba. To the left of this chief cave is a much ruined excavation. Two hundred yards north-west of this is another dwelling cave or vih\u0101ra of which the hall is about the same size as the hall of the chief cave and has a bench round the sides and back and four cells in the back and one on the left side, also an entrance made in the right wall running up to what may have been intended for a chamber over the roof of the cave but never finished. The roof is supported by six octagonal pillars in two rows from front to back with a stone joist running through the\n\n\u00b9 Mr. H. R. Cooke, C.S.\n\u00b2 Fergusson and Burgess\u2019 Cave Temples of India, 212-213. The caves were first described by the late Sir Bartle Frere about 1850 when Commissioner of S\u00e4tt\u0101ra, Journal Bomb. Branch Roy. As. Soc. III. Part II. 55.\nheads of each row, but only fragments of them are left. On the right hand wall near the back are the remains of some human figures, apparently two standing females and two seated males, all now headless and otherwise mutilated. The other caves are smaller and not of much interest.\n\nIts position on the Krishna in a beautiful valley and the Buddhist caves in its neighbourhood show W\u00e1i to have been a holy town and an old Buddhist settlement. W\u00e1i is locally believed to be Vir\u00e1tnagari, the scene of the thirteenth year exile of the P\u00e1ndavs. Nothing further is known of W\u00e1i until Musalm\u00e1n times. In 1429 Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r, the Bahmani governor of Daulatabad, after subduing the R\u00e1moshis and other banditti of Khat\u00e1v and the Mah\u00e1dev hills, marched to W\u00e1i. Between 1453 and 1480 W\u00e1i is mentioned as a military post of the Bahmanis from where troops were ordered in 1464 to join the Bahmani minister M\u00e1hmud G\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00edn his Konkan expedition. About 1648 W\u00e1i was the head-quarters of a Bij\u00e1pur mok\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00e1r or manager. When Shiv\u00e1ji rebelled, he took possession of W\u00e1i, and before his murder at Prat\u00e1pgad in 1659 W\u00e1i was the scene of the last halt of Afzulkh\u00e1n and his ill-fated expedition. From this time W\u00e1i passed to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In 1687 it was attacked by the Bij\u00e1pur general Shirjokh\u00e1n who suffered here a defeat at the hands of the able Mar\u00e1tha general Hamb\u00edrr\u00e1v Mohit\u00e9 who however was killed on the occasion. This victory enabled the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s to occupy much of the open country they had previously lost to the Moghals. The latter got possession of W\u00e1i again in 1690 in the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m (1689-1700), but it was regained for the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the same reign by Sant\u00e1ji Ghorpade the oldest representative of the K\u00e1psi Ghorpade family. R\u00e1mchandrapant, one of the chief men of the time, and afterwards made minister or am\u00e1tya, proposed a stratagem whereby Sant\u00e1ji managed to completely surprise the faujd\u00e1r of W\u00e1i, took him prisoner with all his troops, and established a Maratha post or thona in the town. On its capture the W\u00e1i district was given in charge of Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan a clerk of R\u00e1mchandrapant who retook from the Moghals the important fortress of R\u00e1jgad in the Bhor state. W\u00e1i then fell into the hands of the Peshw\u00e1s, but in 1753 was occupied by R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m\u2019s widow T\u00e1r\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed with the aid of 5000 R\u00e1moshis and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. About 1774 R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1stri, the spiritual and legal adviser at the Poona court, retired from the government in disgust to a sequestered place near W\u00e1i on hearing that Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v finally connived at the murder of his nephew N\u00e1r\u00e1yanr\u00e1v Peshwa. About 1790 the R\u00e1stia family of W\u00e1i first began to rise to influence at the Peshwa\u2019s court at Poona where they sided with the ministerial party against the encroachments of Mah\u00e1di Sind\u00eda.

The town was locally believed to be the scene of the exploits of the P\u00e1ndav brothers, one of whom slew in battle the giant Kichak and dragged the body to the summit of the eminence hard by now named Pandavgad and the toe of the giant was so large that, in tearing it along, it ploughed up the very deep ravine which terminates near the entrance of the town from the eastward. The large tumulus on the hill north-east of W\u00e1i, with a temple on its top, was said to be formed of the body of the monster and three of his companions burnt to ashes by the conqueror. In 1796 when N\u00e1na Fadnavis found B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Peshwa siding with Sindia to compass his ruin he retired to W\u00e1i. The next year Haripant Phadke the Peshwa general was sent to bring N\u00e1na back to Poona. But as he advanced with 4000 horse N\u00e1na took alarm and fled to the Konkan. In 1798 Parshur\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u Patvardhan of T\u00e1sgaon was confined at W\u00e1i, but soon released on quelling some disturbances in the neighbourhood. In 1827 Captain Clunes notices W\u00e1i as a town with a large Br\u00e1hman population, formerly belonging to the R\u00e1sti\u00e1s and still their residence. About 1850 Lady Falkland (1848-1854) writes of W\u00e1i, \u2018I know nowhere a more lovely spot than W\u00e1i, and although I often visited it during my stay in India, I saw new beauties every time. Here there is grand scenery, as well as pleasing quiet spots and charming bits. The view from the travellers\u2019 bungalow is perfectly beautiful. Behind the city rise hills of all the shapes which are peculiar to the mountains in the Deccan. There are round, peaked, flat-topped hills; some covered with rocks, looking at a distance like forts and castles.\u2019\n\nYavteshvar is a small village on the plateau to the north-west of the summit of the Yavteshvar hill, about two miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The plateau is reached by a good bridle path branching off from the tunnel at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra or by the steps which climb straight up the hill side. It is 1100 feet above the plain and pleasantly cool at all times of the year, though a little hot wind is sometimes felt. During the hot weather it is not unfrequently used as a health-resort for the civil and military officers of the station of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The village contains a temple of Yavteshvar and close to the south further up the slope are the remains of two bungalows.\n\nYelur in V\u00e1lva, nine miles south-east of Peth and four miles west of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Kolhapur mail road, is a large village with in 1881 a population of 2808. It is the residence of several well-to-do capitalists and large agriculturists, with an export traffic to Chiplun in pepper sugarcane tobacco and kardai oilseed. At its weekly market on Saturday, besides the articles above mentioned, cattle horses sheep and goats are largely bought and sold. The village was originally\n\n---\n\n1 Memoirs, 275-276.\n2 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 523, 525.\n3 Grant Duff\u2019s Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 535.\n4 Itinerary, 32.\n5 Chow Chow, I, 188; Murray\u2019s Bombay Handbook, 194-195.\nwalled, remains of which may be still seen. About a mile east of the village is an excellent grove of mangoes for a camp.\n\nYerad village, with in 1881 a population of 705, lies close to the Kar\u00e1d-Kumbh\u00e1rli pass road three miles south-west of P\u00e1tan. Close to the south of the road on the river bank, conspicuous from afar, is a fine grove of mango trees. In the middle of this grove is a small stone temple with a tiled roof and a ling said to be Yedoba, an incarnation of Shiv. Silver masks of the god are carried in procession on the fair day, namely the full-moon of Chaitra or March-April. Some 10,000 people assemble every year, this being the favourite fair of the hill cultivators who come from very long distances to visit it. They stay three days and camp in every direction. Special police parties are detached for sanitary arrangements, notwithstanding which the nuisance and pollution of the Koyna river is great. On this account Yerad, though a favourite camp, should not be visited between the fair and the monsoon following. In the pools near the village mahsur can be caught trolling or with the spoon bait.\nSTATES.\n\nOf the six S\u00e1t\u00e1ra j\u00e1girs or feudatories which became tributaries to the British Government on the lapse of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory in 1849, four, Bhor Phaltan Aundh and Jath, within 1883 an area of 3026 square miles, 318,687 people, and a gross revenue of \u00a3178,186 (Rs. 17,81,860), are under the supervision of the Collector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as Political Agent. Of these Bhor lies in the north-west, Phaltan in the north, Aundh in the east, and Jath in the extreme south-east. Besides these four large j\u00e1girdars or states, a group of six villages belonging to the j\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Daphl\u00e1pur is under the Collector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra as Political Agent. Under British rule the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs were continued in all their former rights and privileges, except the powers of life and death and of settling some of the more serious criminal cases. Their administration is now conducted on the principles of British law. Criminal and civil justice is administered by the chiefs themselves with the aid of subordinate courts. In civil suits special appeals from the decisions of the chiefs lie to the Political Agent. In criminal cases heinous offences requiring capital punishment or transportation for life, are tried by the Political Agent aided by two assessors, the preliminary proceedings being conducted by the chiefs. Criminal appeals from their decisions also lie to the Political Agent.\n\nBhor begins from the north-west corner of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra on the north of the Mah\u00e1dev hills. From the Mah\u00e1dev hills, with a breadth varying from thirty-five miles in the south to fifteen miles in the north, Bhor stretches north-west over the rough Sahy\u00e1dri lands in south-west Poona and in east Kol\u00e1ba, as far as within six miles of the line of the Bhor pass in Poona and seven miles of Pen in Kol\u00e1ba. It has an estimated area of about 1491 square miles, a population in 1881 of 145,876 or ninety-eight to the square mile, and in 1883 a gross revenue of \u00a352,318 (Rs. 5,23,180). It is bounded on the north-west and north by Kol\u00e1ba, on the north-east by the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, on the east by Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, on the south by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and on the west by Kol\u00e1ba. Except one-fourth which is flat, the country is hilly. The climate of the part of the state which is above the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds is like that of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and in the part below the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds is like that of Kol\u00e1ba. In 1883 the rainfall varied from 26\u00b78 inches at Vichitragad to 139\u00b744 inches at Sudh\u00e1gad. Intermittent and remittent fever and guineaworm are very prevalent, and cholera appears every two or three years. Of natural resources the chief are agriculture and forests. Iron-smelting which was once of some importance has been given up, and in industries the state is poor. Except a few cotton and wool weavers the bulk of the people are husbandmen mostly Mar\u00e1thi-speaking Hindus. The chief Hindu castes are Br\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1nis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, R\u00e1moshis, Mh\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, and Ch\u00e1mb\u00e1hrs. About three-fourths of the soil is red and about\none-fourth is black and gray. Scarcely any of the land is watered; what there is is watered from wells and fair weather dams. Of rivers above the Sahy\u00e1dris the Mutha runs in the north and the Nira in the south, and below the Sahy\u00e1dris the Amba runs south-west. Of roads above the Sahy\u00e1dris the Pandharpur-Mah\u00e1d made cart-road runs east and west by the Varandha pass and Bhor to Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ba; and the Poona-Belgaum mail road runs north and south by the Kh\u00e1matki pass; and below the Sahy\u00e1dris the Poona-Panvel road by the Bhor pass runs a little above its northern boundary. The state is at present under survey, but no one sub-division has been finally settled. In 1882-83 it had three civil and seven criminal courts. Besides thirty horsemen in the huzur p\u00e1g\u00e1 or head-quarter guard who aid as mounted police, the police were 184 strong. There is no municipality, but a committee of five officers supervise sanitary arrangements on which \u00a3164 (Rs.1640) were spent in 1882. In 1882-83 the actual revenue was returned at \u00a349,500 (Rs. 4,95,000) and the expenditure at \u00a348,800 (Rs. 4,88,000). The local funds collections amounted to \u00a33100 (Rs. 31,000), which are said to have been spent on local objects; 1045 patients were treated at the Bhor dispensary and 2267 persons were vaccinated. There are twenty-seven schools with 923 pupils.\n\nIn 1697 R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, the son of Shiv\u00e1ji, appointed Shankr\u00e1ji N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Pant Sachiv for his able services. He was given an estate or j\u00e1gir and other vatans or rent-free lands. In 1707, Shankr\u00e1ji died at \u00c1mbev\u00e1di and was succeeded by his son N\u00e1ro. On his death in March 1737, N\u00e1ro was succeeded by his nephew Chimm\u00e1ji who had three sons Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v, \u00c1nandr\u00e1v, and Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v. In 1757, on the death of Chimm\u00e1ji, his eldest son Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v became Pant Sachiv. In 1787, on his death Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v was succeeded by his youngest brother Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v. On Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v\u2019s death in 1791, his son Shankarr\u00e1v became Pant Sachiv. He had no male issue and adopted Chimm\u00e1ji who succeeded him in 1798. Till their downfall in 1818, Chimm\u00e1ji continued in the service of the Peshw\u00e1s. On his death in 1827, Chimm\u00e1ji was succeeded by his adopted son Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v; for this adoption a nazar\u00e1na or present of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000) was paid to the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1836 Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v, being without legitimate male issue, adopted Chimm\u00e1ji who succeeded him in 1839. On the 12th of February 1871, on his death Chimm\u00e1ji was succeeded by his son Shankarr\u00e1v, the present chief. During the chief\u2019s minority a k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri or manager was appointed by the British Government to look after his affairs. In 1874 at the age of twenty-one, Shankarr\u00e1v assumed the charge of his state. The Pant Sachiv ranks as first class sard\u00e1r. He is a Br\u00e1hman by caste and his head-quarters are at Bhor. He pays a yearly tribute of \u00a3523 10s. (Rs. 5235) to the British Government, nominally on account of pilkh\u00e1na or elephant stables.\n\n---\n\n1 The pant sachiv was one of the titles given to his eight ministers by Shiv\u00e1ji at the time of his crowning in 1674. The eight titles were the peshwa or prime minister, pant am\u00e1tya or councillor, pant sachiv or minister, mantr\u00ed or general councillor, sumant or foreign minister, ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhist or judge, and panditr\u00e1v or the learned. In 1698 a ninth title of pant prat\u00ednidhi or viceroy, ranking higher than the other eight, was created by R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m.\nPhaltan lies to the north of the Mah\u00e1dev range which drains north to the Nira. It has an estimated area of about 397 square miles, a population in 1881 of 58,402 or 147 to the square mile, and in 1883 a gross revenue of \u00a356,763 (Rs. 5,67,630). It is bounded on the north by the Nira and beyond the Nira by Bhimthadi in Poona, on the east by M\u00e1lsiras in Shol\u00e1pur, on the south by M\u00e1n Khat\u00e1v and Koregaon in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and on the west by Koregaon and Khand\u00e1l\u00e1 in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The country is chiefly flat; lines of small stony hills divide it from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district. The climate is hot and the rainfall scanty and uncertain. Intermittent and remittent fevers are very prevalent, also guineaworm, boils, and itches, and sometimes cholera and small-pox. Of natural resources the chief are building timber, extensive sheep-grazing lands, and salt. The chief Hindu castes are Br\u00e1hmans, Ling\u00e1yats, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, R\u00e1moshis, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, Mh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs. The prevailing soil is black and the rest is red. About 9000 acres of garden land are watered mostly from wells. Of rivers the Nira runs in the north of the state. Of roads the Pandharpur-Mah\u00e1d made cart-road runs east and west by Phaltan to Mah\u00e1d and by the \u00c1darki pass a road runs south-west to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The chief industries are the weaving of cotton and silk goods and the carving of stone idols. In the town of Phaltan a number of Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00eds carry on a brisk trade in importing and exporting between the coast and the interior. Yearly fairs are held at Phaltan and J\u00e1vli.\n\nThe state was surveyed in 1869-70. It suffered severely during the 1876-77 famine, and a good deal of arable land fell waste and has not again been brought under tillage, partly from the numbers who left and died, and partly from the want of cattle. In 1882-83 the state had three civil courts besides criminal and sessions courts under Joint Administrators. Besides forty-three rakhv\u00e1ld\u00e1rs or watchmen, who guard the public buildings in Phaltan and generally aid the police, the regular police are fifty-two strong. The municipality of Phaltan was established in 1868, and the income is levied by a graduated tax as well as by a sixteenth of the pay of the state servants. In 1882 the municipality had a revenue of \u00a3580 (Rs. 5800), of which \u00a3480 (Rs. 4800) were spent on scavenging, roadside trees, and sinking a well. The streets are well kept and clean, and the road round the town is well shaded by trees. The taxation is 3d. (2 as.) a head. In 1882 the gross revenue of the state was returned at \u00a320,900 (Rs. 2,09,000), and the expenditure at \u00a318,300 (Rs. 1,83,000). The excise and salt arrangements are in the hands of the British Government. A toll has been put on the \u00c1darki pass, on which the state had previously spent over \u00a31700 (Rs. 17,000). There are sixteen schools with 719 pupils. English is taught at Phaltan.\n\nThe chief of Phaltan is a Mar\u00e1tha of the Pov\u00e1r clan. According to the state records, in 1327 one Podakla Jagdev entered the service of Muhammad Tughlik (1325-1351), the emperor of Delhi, who was then warring in the Deccan. Podakla was killed in battle, and the Emperor granted his son Nimbr\u00e1j a j\u00e1gir together with some in\u00e1m lands and the title of n\u00e1ik. Nimbr\u00e1j founded the present town of Phaltan and died in 1349. He was succeeded by his son Vanag who was put to death in 1374. In 1390 Vanag's son Vangp\u00e1l retook\nPhaltan and died in 1394. Between 1394 and 1630 nine chiefs ruled at Phaltan, about whom little but their names is known.\\(^1\\) In 1644 the ruling chief Mudhoji (1630-1644) was killed by the king of Bij\u00e1pur, and his son Ban\u00e1ji was taken prisoner to Bij\u00e1pur. In 1651 Ban\u00e1ji was restored to his father's estate. He had four sons Mah\u00e1d\u00e9ji, Gorkhoji, Vangoji, and Mudhoji. In 1676, on the death of Ban\u00e1ji his third son Vangoji succeeded, but died without issue in 1693, and was succeeded by his nephew J\u00e1noji. J\u00e1noji was deposed by his step-brother Ban\u00e1ji, and was afterwards restored by Sh\u00e1hu of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1708-1749). In 1748, on his death J\u00e1noji was succeeded by his son Mudhoji. In 1765, on the death of Mudhoji, his wife Sagun\u00e1b\u00e1i administered the state for a short time, but was deposed by Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Ball\u00e1l and one Soyr\u00e1ji raised to the chiefship. In 1774 Sagun\u00e1b\u00e1i adopted a son M\u00e1l\u00f3ji, and with the aid of Peshwa M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v N\u00e1r\u00e1yan regained control of the state. In 1777, on his death M\u00e1l\u00f3ji was succeeded by his adopted son J\u00e1nr\u00e1v. J\u00e1nr\u00e1v continued in the service of the Peshw\u00e1s till their fall in 1818. On the 1st of January 1825, on J\u00e1nr\u00e1v's death the state was attached by the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, but on the 3rd of September 1827 Ban\u00e1ji was allowed to succeed on payment of a nazar\u00e1na or succession fee of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000). On the 17th of May 1828, on Ban\u00e1ji's death the state was again attached by the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. On the 3rd of December 1841, on payment of a nazar\u00e1na or succession fee of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000), Jib\u00e1i \u00c1i S\u00e1heb the wife of Ban\u00e1ji was allowed to adopt the present chief Mudhojir\u00e1v. During Mudhojir\u00e1v's minority \u00c1i S\u00e1heb acted as regent till her death on the 17th of November 1853. After her death the British Government managed the state till the 10th of February 1860, when Mudhojir\u00e1v was put in sole charge of the state. The chief of Phaltan styled Nimb\u00e1lk\u00e1r, is a Mar\u00e1tha by caste and ranks as first class s\u00e1rd\u00e1r. His headquarters are at Phaltan, and he pays the British Government a yearly tribute of \u00a3960 (Rs. 9600) on account of sv\u00e1rs or horsemen. The family holds a patent allowing adoption. In matters of succession they do not follow the custom of primogeniture. Of late, as he was deeply involved in debt, Mudhojir\u00e1v applied to Government for a loan and offered to resign the management of the state till the debt was paid and the affairs of the state were put in order. In December 1882 the offer was accepted and joint administrators were appointed, one the son of the chief and the other a revenue officer of the British Government. The debts which amounted to \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2\u00bd l\u00e1khs) will be discharged by a yearly instalment of about \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000) and the state is expected to be free from debt in thirteen or fourteen years. Under the joint administration many of the departments have been reorganized, the pay of the police has been raised, and the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act has been introduced to give the cultivators the same protection as in Poona or S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The joint administration has also resumed the civil, criminal, and revenue charge of the R\u00e1m-Sansth\u00e1n group of six villages, which have a\n\n\\(^1\\) The nine chiefs were: Vangoji (1394-1409), M\u00e1l\u00f3ji (1409-1420), B\u00e1ji (1420-1445), Jova (1445-1470), B\u00e1ji (1470-1512), Mudhoji (1512-1527), B\u00e1jid\u00e1r (1527-1560), M\u00e1l\u00f3ji (1560-1570), and Vangoji (1570-1630).\nyearly revenue of over \u00a34700 (Rs. 47,000) and which Mudhojirav gave in grant to a temple.\n\nAundh is partly scattered within the limits of the M\u00e1n, Koregaon, Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, Kar\u00e1d, and T\u00e1sgaon sub-divisions of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and partly forms a considerable block of the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division to the north-east of Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur which drains north-east into the M\u00e1n. It has an estimated area of about 447 square miles, a population in 1881 of 58,916 or 131 to the square mile, and in 1883 an estimated gross revenue of \u00a339,960 (Rs. 3,99,600). The \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division, with an area of about 300 square miles, is bounded on the north by M\u00e1n in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and M\u00e1lsiras in Shol\u00e1pur, on the east by S\u00e1ngola in Shol\u00e1pur, on the south by Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and on the west by Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur Khat\u00e1v and M\u00e1n. The country belonging to Aundh is for the most part flat. The climate of the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division is hot and the rainfall scanty and uncertain. In 1883, the rainfall varied in different parts from sixteen to thirty inches. The prevalent diseases are remittent fevers, severe colds, and guineaworm. Cholera and small-pox occur every two or three years. The bulk of the people are Hind\u00fas and Musalm\u00e1ns, who speak Mar\u00e1thi K\u00e1narese and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed. The chief Hindu castes are Br\u00e1hmans, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, R\u00e1mshis, Mh\u00e1rs, Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs. In the \u00c1tp\u00e1di subdivision about half the soil is black, one-fourth gray, and the remaining fourth red. In other parts about two-thirds of the soil is black and one-third gray. The garden land is almost all watered from wells. Of rivers the M\u00e1n runs north and south in the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division. Of roads the Malh\u00e1rpeth-Pandharpur made cart-road runs through the \u00c1tp\u00e1di sub-division by the Kaldhon pass. In 1882-83 the state had one appellate and six subordinate civil courts and thirteen criminal courts. Besides village watchmen, the strength of the police is fifty-two men and 170 shetsandis or militia. In 1882-83, at the Aundh dispensary 2460 patients were treated and 1085 children vaccinated. There are nineteen schools with 736 scholars.\n\nThe family of the Pant Pratinidhi is descended from Trimbak Krishna, the accountant of the village of Kinhai in the Koregaon sub-division of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1690, R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, the youngest son of Shiv\u00e1ji, raised Trimbak\u2019s son, Parashur\u00e1m Pant, who was in the service of R\u00e1mchandra Pant Am\u00e1tya, to the rank of sard\u00e1r. He became a great favourite of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m\u2019s, and in 1698 was made pratinidhi or viceroy. In 1699, his predecessor Tim\u00e1ji Hannmant, who had been taken prisoner by the Moghals, was set free and re-appointed Pratinidhi, and Parashur\u00e1m Pant received the office of Peshwa or prime minister. In 1700, on the death of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, his widow T\u00e1r\u00e1-b\u00e1i again appointed Parashur\u00e1m Pratinidhi. In the civil war which followed the death of R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m, Parashur\u00e1m was T\u00e1r\u00e1-b\u00e1i\u2019s chief general, and in 1707 was defeated and taken prisoner by Sh\u00e1hu the grandson of Shiv\u00e1ji. Parashur\u00e1m lost his appointment, and in 1710 the office of Pratinidhi was given to Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r Pralh\u00e1d. On Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r\u2019s death in the same year, Parashur\u00e1m was set free and restored, but in 1711 the office was again taken from him and given to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Pralh\u00e1d. In 1713 Parashur\u00e1m Pant was again restored and the office of Pratinidhi was made hereditary in his family.\n1717 on his death Parashur\u00e1m was succeeded by his second son Shriniv\u00e1s, as his eldest son Krishn\u00e1ji was Pratinidhi of Vish\u00e1lga\u1e0d in the Kolh\u00e1pur state. Shriniv\u00e1s also called Shripatr\u00e1v was during all his lifetime Sh\u00e1hu\u2019s chief adviser. In 1746 he died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother Jagjivan, commonly called D\u00e1doba, whom Sh\u00e1hu appointed to his brother\u2019s post of chief minister. In 1750, when, on the death of Sh\u00e1hu, the Peshwa became supreme, D\u00e1doba was deposed and in 1751 was succeeded by Shriniv\u00e1s Gang\u00e1dh\u00e1r, also called Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v and grandson of D\u00e1doba\u2019s elder brother Krishn\u00e1ji Parashur\u00e1m. In 1752, D\u00e1doba was restored to the office, with Shriniv\u00e1s as his assistant. On D\u00e1doba\u2019s death without issue, the office was given to Shriniv\u00e1s. In 1762, R\u00e1ghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v deposed Shriniv\u00e1s and gave the office to his own son Bh\u00e1skarr\u00e1v. Bh\u00e1skarr\u00e1v died four months after getting the office which was then given to N\u00e1ro Shankar. In 1763 Shriniv\u00e1s also called Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v intrigued with the Niz\u00e1m and Raghoji Bhonsla of N\u00e1gpur and was restored. In 1765 he was again deposed by the Peshwa for disobedience, and his office was given to his cousin Bhagvantr\u00e1v Trimbak. Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v then went to Poona where he lived for about four years, receiving \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) a year from the Peshwa. In 1768, Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v was given a saranj\u00e1m or military grant of the yearly value of \u00a350,000 (Rs. 5 l\u0101hhs). He waged constant war with the Pratinidhi Bhagvantr\u00e1v till Bhagvantr\u00e1v died in 1775. In 1777 Bhav\u00e1nr\u00e1v died and was succeeded by his son Parashur\u00e1m. Parashur\u00e1m was born the day after his father\u2019s death, and was at once installed as Pratinidhi by N\u00e1na Fadnavis, who was a great friend of his father. In 1795 at the age of eighteen Parashur\u00e1m Pant took charge of his estate or j\u00e1gir. He is said to have had great valour. He died in 1848 and was succeeded by the present chief Shriniv\u00e1sr\u00e1v, who had been adopted in 1847 with the permission of the British Government and the late R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nA nazar\u00e1na or succession fee was paid at the time of adoption. During the government of Sir Bartle Frere (1862-1867) Shriniv\u00e1sr\u00e1v was a member of the Legislative Council of Bombay. The Pratinidhi is a Br\u00e1hman by caste and ranks as first class sard\u00e1r. He lives at Aundh, an isolated village in the Khat\u00e1v sub-division. He pays no tribute to Government.\n\nJath stretches east and then north to the M\u00e1n and Bhima about twenty miles south-east of Pandharpur. It has an estimated area of 885 square miles, a population in 1881 of 49,486 or fifty-six to the square mile, and in 1883 a gross revenue returned at \u00a328,000 (Rs. 2,80,000). It is bounded on the north by S\u00e1ngola in Shol\u00e1pur and Mangalvedha in S\u00e1ngli, on the east by Indi and Bij\u00e1pur, on the south by Athni in Belgaum, and on the west by S\u00e1ngli and Miraj. Except a number of small hills near the town of Jath, the country is flat. The land is poor and thinly peopled, and is specially suited for cattle breeding. The climate is hot and the rainfall is about the same as at Bij\u00e1pur. The south-west monsoon begins and ends with heavy thunder showers. The Madras or north-east monsoon sometimes extends to Jath in December. During the autumnal months intermittent fevers are common. From May to September cholera appears almost every year. The bulk of the\npeople are Hindus who speak Marathi Kanarese and Hindustani. The chief Hindu castes are Brahmins, Lingayats, Jains, Marathas, Ramaoshis, Vadars, Berads, Mhars, Mangs, and Chambhars. About one-sixth of the soil is black, one-sixth red, and the remaining two-thirds stony and gravelly. Most garden lands are watered from wells. Of the rivers small feeders of the Man and Bhima run through the state. Of the roads the chief is the Karad-Bijapur road running north-west and south from Bijapur to Karad by Jath. The survey was introduced in 1878, and has been of great benefit to the people by sweeping away a number of arbitrary cesses. The rates are moderate and there is a large area of arable waste. In 1882 about 3000 acres were taken for tillage, and a large part has been reserved for forest. The forest reserves amount to about 38,400 acres. In 1882-83 the state had four criminal courts. The police were sixty-one strong. In 1882 the gross revenue was returned as amounting to about \u00a327,500 (Rs. 2,75,000), besides \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000) collected as local funds, and the expenditure was about \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000) including \u00a32200 (Rs. 22,000) paid for debts, and excluding \u00a3460 (Rs. 4600) spent on local fund objects, chiefly on education. At Jath a municipal fund is raised by a tax on the sale of cattle at the weekly market, and the proceeds are spent in maintaining the roads and trees, and on lighting the town. The Jath dispensary, which was closed for some years of financial embarrassment, was re-opened towards the close of 1882. The state has seventeen schools with 682 pupils.\n\nThe family of the Jath chief claim descent from Lakhmaji bin Eldaji Chavhan, headman of the village of Daphlapur. Lakhmaji had two sons Satvajirav and Dhondjirav. In 1680 Satvajirav, who had entered the service of Ali Adil Shah, king of Bijapur, on paying a succession fee or nazarana, was appointed Deshmukh of the sub-divisions of Jath, Karajgi, Bardol, and Vanvad; Satvajirav continued one of the leading Bijapur nobles till the state was overthrown by Aurangzeb in 1686. He assumed independence for a few days, but finally submitted to Aurangzeb, receiving Jath and Karajgi in jagir, and Jath, Karajgi, Vanvad, and Bardol as vataans. Satvajirav's two sons, Babaji and Khanaaji, died about 1700 before their father. On Satvaji's death without heirs, Esubai, the wife of his eldest son Bavaji, succeeded. On her death in 1754 Esubai was succeeded by her nephew Yashvantrav. In 1759 Yashvantrav died and was succeeded by his son Amritrav. Amritrav was succeeded by his son Khanaajirav, who had two wives Renukabai and Salubai. In 1818 Renukabai made a treaty with the English under which all her possessions were confirmed to her. In 1823 Renukabai died and was succeeded by Salubai who administered the state for ten months and died without leaving male issue. The state was then attached by the Raja of Satara, but in 1824 it was granted to Ramrav bin Narayanrav a member of the same family. In 1835 Ramrav died leaving no male issue. The Raja of Satara again attached the state and managed it till 1841, when it was granted to Bhagirithibai the widow of Ramrav. In 1841, with the permission of the Satara government, Bhagirithibai\nadopted Bhimr\u00e1v bin Bhagvantr\u00e1v. Bhimr\u00e1v on his adoption took the name of Amritr\u00e1v. During Amritr\u00e1v's minority the state was managed by Bh\u00e1girthib\u00e1i till her death in 1845. On Bh\u00e1girthib\u00e1i's death Sakhojir\u00e1v S\u00e1vant was appointed k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri or manager, and remained in office till Amritr\u00e1v came of age in 1855. In 1872 owing to numerous complaints of oppression on the part of Amritr\u00e1v, the Government of Bombay ordered Captain, now Lieutenant Colonel, West to make inquiries into the alleged grievances. The result of these inquiries was that both the civil and the criminal administration was taken out of the chief's hands. The chief of Jath, who is styled Deshmukh, is a Mar\u00e1tha by caste and ranks as first class sard\u00e1n. Besides small sums on account of rights in other districts, the chief pays to the British Government a yearly tribute of \u00a3473 18s. (Rs. 4739) on account of sardeshmukhi rights in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district and of \u00a3640 (Rs. 6400) in lieu of furnishing sv\u00e1rs or horsemen. At present (1884) the chief has no jurisdiction. A k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri or manager has been appointed with the powers of a first class subordinate judge in civil cases, and of a first class magistrate in criminal cases.\n\nThe small state of Daphla'pur consisting of six villages, lies in the west of Jath. It is at present managed by a lady, the B\u00e1is\u00e1heb Lakshmib\u00e1i Daphli, who exercises the powers of a magistrate of the first class and in civil matters of a first class subordinate judge. Daphl\u00e1pur has an estimated area of forty square miles, a population in 1881 of 6007 or 150 to the square mile, and in 1883 a gross revenue of \u00a31160 (Rs. 11,600). In 1882 the survey of the state was completed and the assessment raised from \u00a3900 to \u00a31300 (Rs. 9000 - 13,000). There are three schools in the state.\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nThe following notes on the botany of the district are contributed by Major H. H. Lee, R.E.:\n\nThe S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district affords an interesting field for the botanist, comprising as it does so great a variety of soil and climate. The plains and bare hills of the eastern districts may be readily exhausted but the observer will have his hands full when he approaches the Western Gh\u00e1ts crosses the Koyna valley, and traverses the boundary line between S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the Konkan. The grassy slopes of the Gh\u00e1ts teem with luxuriant growth in the latter part of September, when the heavy rains are over, and a visitor to Mah\u00e1baleshwar on a fine day at this season is well repaid by the varied colouring of the wild flowers. Later on in October and November the western spurs are brightened by the vivid yellows of Composites and the pink of strong-growing Balsams, whilst pretty Smithias and hosts of other species of the pea-tribe carpet the forest side.\n\nThere are few better spots for botanising than the re-entering angle of the FitzGerald Pass below Elphinstone Cottage, early in November and even later. The traveller will admire too the pretty mauve balsams that grow out of his reach, clinging to the rock under the big waterfall higher up. The sheltered portions of the Koyna valley are well wooded and would be more so had kumri or wood ash cultivation never been allowed. No very large amount of useful timber is however to be found anywhere, and apparently the teak does not attain any large size. The plains are for the most part destitute of trees; the avenues which mark snake-like the great highways alone telling of what might be, were arboriculture more practised by the tiller of the soil.\n\nThe following is a list of the chief plants to be met with in the district.\n\nRANUNCULACE\u00c6.\n\n*Clematis vightiana.*\n\n*Gouriana.*\n\nCommon climbers on the hills; the popular names of the English Clematis, \"Traveller's joy\" and \"Old Man's Beard,\" are well known.\n\nDILLENIACE\u00c6.\n\n*Dillenia pentagyna*\u2014\n\nFlowers in March; forest tree with large strongly veined leaves and a yellow fruit the size of a gooseberry; flowers yellow in clusters; at Helv\u00e1k.\n\nMAGNOLIACE\u00c6.\n\n*Michelia champaca*\u2014One of the Champas.\n\nA fine umbrageous tree with very sweet yellow flowers; found in temple groves on the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds.\n\nANONACE\u00c6.\n\n*Polycelthia cerasoides.*\n\nA tree found in the Koyna valley.\n\nMENISPERMAC\u00c6.\n\n*Tinospora cordifolia.*\n\nA woody climber.

Attempts have been made to introduce the Cinchona plant at Lingmall\u2014a Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The attempt, however, has been a failure, either through the site being too exposed or the soil unfavourable. The use of the cinchona bark from which quinine is made was first introduced into Europe by the Jesuits after the conquest of Peru, and it was known for a long time as Jesuit's bark. Coffee is grown at Panchgani, but apparently not very successfully.

Sufficient notes, however, have not been taken to catalogue the genera and species fully. The garden \"Stephanotis\" belongs to this order.\n\n2 The order of Gentian worts is characterised by the uniform bitter secretions of every part, root, leaves, flowers, and fruit. The well-known Indian bitter and febrifuge Chiretta consists of the stems and leaves of \"Swertia chirayta,\" a native of Nepaul.\n\n3 The plant whose leaves are generally used in 'cups' in India is not a Borage at all, but a Labiate, Coleus aromaticus. The \"prickly Comfrey\" about which so much was written as a fodder plant some years ago, is a Borage \"Symphytum officinale.\"\nAppendix A.\n\n**Botany.**\n\n*Evolulus hirsutus.*\n\nA very small herbaceous plant with tiny flowers of a beautiful deep blue.

A plant like the \"Cape gooseberry.\"\n\n*Datura fastuosa.*\n\nFlowers large white. This is a well known plant and much used when insensibility to outward things is required.\n\nThe order Solanaceae whilst it comprises many extremely poisonous plants such as Henbane and deadly nightshade, comprises also useful and nutritious ones such as the Potato, Tomato, Egg-plant or \"Brinjal,\" Capsicum, and the Cape-gooseberry with its pleasant subacid fruit enveloped when ripe in a yellow calyx. Tobacco should not be omitted in the list of useful plants.\n\nThe potato is extensively cultivated at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, and at one time produced tubers quite equal to the European; but, owing to the carelessness of cultivators in not selecting the best for reproduction, the potato is not what it was, or should be. The Tomato grows most luxuriantly at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The \"L\u00e1l Mirch\u00ed\" (Capsicum frutescens) is extensively cultivated in the plains, the bright red fruit showing out pleasantly from amid the dark green leaves. The yellow pepper (C. nepalensis) does well at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nThe Brinjal (Solanum melongena) is to be met with everywhere in the plains near villages as a cold weather crop. The variety of tobacco chiefly cultivated is believed to be Nicotianum tabacum.\n\n**SCROPHULARINE\u00c6.**\n\n*Celsia coronandelliana.*\n\nCommon; plains.

Flowers yellowish. \u201cThe inner part of Lagetta linteraria, a shrub belonging to this order is the beautiful Lace bark,\u201d so called because when macerated and stretched laterally it assumes the appearance of coarse lace, twisted and knotted; it was formerly employed in making the slave whips used by negro drivers (Lind., Veg. King.)\n\nLAURACE\u00c6.\n\nLitsea fuscata\u2014Pisa.\nA small tree; leaves narrow-pointed, lighter beneath. Berries bright red when ripe. The commonest tree at Mah\u00e1baleshvar after the j\u00e1mbul.\nThe species of this order are all more or less aromatic and fragrant. Foremost among them are Cinnamon and Cassia. Some species yield an abundance of camphor, especially in the roots of \u201cCinnamomum.\u201d The camphor of commerce is obtained from the wood, branches, and leaves of Camphora officinarum, by means of dry distillation. It is chiefly produced in Formosa and is called Chinese camphor.\u201d (Lind., Veg. King.)\n\nSANTALACE\u00c6.\nThe sandalwood tree, Santalum album, is fairly common in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra compounds. It never grows to any size, or large enough to produce the well-known scented wood.\n\nELAEAGNACE\u00c6.\n\nElaeagnus latifolia\u2014Ambul.\nA large, climbing shrub; leaves silvery and shining beneath. Fruit size of an olive; edible; common on the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds.\n\nEUPHORBIACE\u00c6.\u00b2\n\nEuphorbia nivula.\nMah\u00e1baleshvar. Common; the so-called cactus.\n\nEuphorbia neriifolia\u2014Thor.\nThe milkbush, commonly used as a hedge plant on the plains. It grows to a good height.\n\nEuphorbia acaulis.\nStemless. Leaves spotted as if with blood. P\u00e1nchgani.\n\n\u00b9 The poplar and aspen belong to this order. \u201cA crystallizable principle called salicine has been obtained from Salix helis, which, according to Majindie, arrests the progress of fever with the same power as sulphate of quinine\u201d (Lindley, Veg. King.). A crystal of salicine is a beautiful sight under the Polariscop\u00e9. Excellent cricket bats are made from the wood of Salix alba.\n\n\u00b2 The above is a very scanty list of Euphorbiaceae of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. This order contains a very great number of species most of which are harmful. They generally secrete an acrid milky juice. The croton oil, a most violent drastic, is prepared from the seeds of Croton tiglium. A species of croton is commonly used as a hedge plant around and near villages, and many of our ornamental pot plants belong to the same genus. The \u201cPoinsettia,\u201d the Tallow tree, the Tapioca plant, the Indian Bottle tree (Siphonia elastica), and Cascarailla, belong to this order.\nEuphorbia rothiana.\nA smooth herbaceous plant common at Mah\u00e1baleshvar in cold weather.\n\nEuphorbia hirta.\nAnnual; hairy; a weed; S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nEuphorbia parviflora.\nAnnual, smooth; a weed; S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; in rains.\n\nAcalypha indica.\nA weed; flowers collected in a cup-shaped, toothed involucre; S\u00e1t\u00e1ra fields. Rains.\n\nHomnoia riparia.\nA willow-like shrub; spikes of flowers red. Common in beds of rivers along with the Tamarisk. Helv\u00e1k. Hot weather.\n\nCrozophora plicata.\nA hoary erect plant, common near river banks; cold weather. Plains. \u201cBark very tough.\u201d Dalz.\n\nEmbleca officinalis\u2014Avla.\nA tree. Leaves numerous, very small, giving it the appearance of an acacia. Fruit about the size of a large cherry; yellowish. The wood is hard and durable particularly under water; the bark is strongly astringent and is employed in the cure of diarrhoea. The fruit is made into pickles.\u201d (D. & G.)\n\nRicinus communis\u2014Erandi.\nThe castor-oil plant, cultivated in the plains. A handsome red-stemmed variety is often to be seen forming a fringe to sugarcane fields. The smaller variety Tiki; the ordinary one appears to yield the most oil.\n\nPhyllanthus lanceolarius.\nA tree, wood hard and durable. Gh\u00e1ts.\n\nURTICACE\u00c6.\n\nTrema Wightii\u2014Ghol.\nA small tree with graceful foliage at the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dris. Panchgani Gh\u00e1t.\n\nTo this order belong the Vad, Pimpal, and Pimpri, and N\u00e1ndruk, so much used in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra districts for avenue trees.\n\nThe Vad or Banian is Ficus bengalense; Pimpal Ficus religiosum; Pipri Ficus pseudotjela; N\u00e1ndruk Ficus retusa. This last is a very umbrageous thickly-leaved tree, more suitable than the others for avenues.\n\nTo this order belong also the Fig and the Mulberry; the former fruit apparently does not do well in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district; the mulberry is chiefly to be found as an occasional arboreous shrub near bungalows. All the species secrete a milky fluid. The India rubber of India is furnished by \u201cFicus elastica.\u201d\n\nARTOCARPACE\u00c6.\n\nThis order gives the Jack-fruit tree, Artocarpus integrifolia. It is found on and near the Gh\u00e1ts, but does not flourish inland. The wood is excellent; it was at one time greatly used for making furniture, but it has been completely superseded by blackwood. The Bread-fruit tree is \u201cArtocarpus incisa.\u201d\n\nSMILACE\u00c6.\n\nSmilax ovalifolia.\nMah\u00e1baleshwar; common after the rains. A creeper with sharp-prickles, large 5-7 ribbed leaves, and umbels of red smooth berries. The natives make a decoction from the roots.\n\nLORANTHACE\u00c6.\n\nThe Loranthas, which are parasites or epiphytical plants like the mistletoe only having showy flowers and generally larger leaves, are fairly well represented on the Sahy\u00e1dris. L. cuneatus and L. obtusatus are met with at Mah\u00e1baleshwar.\nENDOGENS.\n\nLILIACE\u00c6.\n\nAsparagopsis sarmentosa.\nFlowers white; berries red, something like an exaggerated asparagus in full growth. Hills.\n\nUropetalum montanum.\nPanchgani. Flowers snow-drop like; sweet-scented. September.\n\nMethonica superba.\nPlains. Kolhapur Khind. A very handsome orange-flowered plant.\n\nLedebouria maculata.\nSatara. Flowers like those of a tiny hyacinth. Leaves spotted. Rains.\n\nAt least two varieties of Aloes are commonly grown in the district which are serviceable as hedges and also valuable as a source of fibre. Aloe fibre is becoming more appreciated yearly and considerable quantities are sent to Bombay.\n\nCOMMELYNACE\u00c6.\n\nSeveral small plants of this order appear in the rains on the plains, chiefly of the genus Cyanotis. The beautiful blue of the long-coloured petals, and the hairy stamens of some are noteworthy. Cyanotis cristata is very common. C. tuberosa is also to be met with.\n\nAROID\u00c6.\n\nTo this order belongs the snake-lily of Mahabaleshwar \"Arissaema murraya.\" In gardens varieties of Caladiums do well in the rains. At Mahabaleshwar there is a very caladium-like plant found growing on the stems or in the hollows of trees, the Remusatia vivipara.\n\nORCHIDACE\u00c6.\u00b9\n\nMany species are represented on the ghats, among them Eridies crispa and E. lindleyana, the latter with its pallidly purple flowers appearing just before the rains. The following are also met with:\n\nDendrobium barbatulum.\nCold weather. Flowers cream or nankin-coloured. Very common about Helv\u00e1k. It is leafless when flower-bearing.\n\nEria braccata.\nFlowers large, white in June; the pseudo bulbs are enclosed in a net-like sack. Branches of trees; leaves 2.\n\nHabenaria rotundifolia.\nLittle white ground orchid. June. A pretty little plant; leaf solitary. It is also common in the plains later on. The tubercles are said to be the source of a common kind of S\u0101lam misri a highly nutritious substance.\n\nHabenaria longicalcarata.\nHendoshi. September; 2-3 feet high. Handsome flowers: white.\n\nPlatanthera brachyphylla.\nFlowers small greenish white; leaves 2. Mahabaleshwar.\n\nPlatanthera Susanna.\nThe giant orchis. Flowers very large, white. Koyna valley. Rains. This orchis is 3 to 4 feet high.\n\nMUSACE\u00c6.\n\nMusa ornata.\nThe wild plantain. Sides of rocky hills on the Ghats. This is one of the first plants to show fresh growth after the burning of grass in the hot weather. The cultivated plantain, of which there are many varieties, is M. sapientum.\n\n\u00b9 Vanilla is the dry food of an orchid \"Vanilla planiflora.\" The plant is a Mexican one.\nZINGIBERACE\u00c6.\n\nGlobba marantina.\nFlowers slender bright, yellow. Mah\u00e1baleshvar. Rains.\n\nZinziber macrostachyum.\nFlowers white; middle lobe-marked with purple lines. Mah\u00e1baleshvar. (Graham).\n\nCurcuma caulina.\nCorne white. Flowers yellow (a white variety also). One of the commonest under-plants at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. The leaves appear above ground just before the rains. From the tubers a kind of arrowroot is made, samples of which can be purchased from the Chinamen at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, where at one time it was hoped to have popularised the manufacture. The arrowroot of commerce is made from the tubers of a West Indian plant \"Maranta arundinacea\" a plant belonging to another Order Marantace\u00e6 which includes the Cannas or Indian shot plants of Indian gardens. The making of arrowroot from the tubers of the various Indian Curcum\u00e6 should be taught the hill people extensively.\n\nIn the late famine, the tubers, of which there is an inexhaustible supply, would have furnished food for thousands. Mr. East, First Assistant Collector, made some attempt to develop the manufacture.\n\nThe order of Ginger-worts provides many valuable aromatic and stimulating products such as Ginger from the roots of Zingiber officinale, Galangale from 'Alpinia galanga' Halad or turmeric, the spice that gives such flavour to curries and cardamoms, the seeds of various Ellettarias. Turmeric is grown in garden land in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra districts.\n\nAMARYLLIDACE\u00c6.\n\nCrinum Roxburghii.\nFlowers large, white. Mah\u00e1baleshvar. June. \"The Mah\u00e1baleshvar Lily.\"\n\nHYDROCHARIDACE\u00c6.\n\nOttalia indica.\nFlowers white. Tanks near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra; floating plant.\n\nPALMACE\u00c6.\n\nThere are not many plants of this tribe in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra upland district. However, the \"Caryota urens\" is to be seen in most of the Koyna valley forests. It is a large tree and produces a good quantity of toddy. \"Phoenix acauris\" is to be met along with the wild plantain on the hill sides. The date is the dried fruit of Phoenix dactylifera. In the Helv\u00e1k forests the cane Calamus rotang is to be met with, whilst in garden land the cocoanut and arecanut palms are fairly common, more however as ornamental trees than useful ones. These require a softer air; the cocoanut indeed never flourishes away from the immediate vicinity of the sea.\n\nPANDANACE\u00c6.\n\nScrew-pine hedges are to be seen near villages in the district, but are not very common; probably the plant is Pandanus furcatus. The fruit is something like the pine-apple.\n\nCYPERACE\u00c6 AND GRAMINE\u00c6.\n\nOf these two Orders no list can be given for want of sufficient notes. The well-known Hary\u00e1li or Durva is Cynodon dactylon. The bamboo which is but a gigantic grass grows on the Gh\u00e1ts; Bambusa arundo is probably the one most met with.\nDISTRICTS.\n\nFILICES.\n\nAs many as thirty different ferns are said to be found at Mah\u00e1baleshwar, where the commonest kinds are the Bracken (Pteris aquilina), identical with the English plant; the Silver Fern (Cheilanthes farrinosa); the Osmunda on the banks of the Yenna. Various \"Aspleniums,\" \"Aspidiums,\" Adder's tongues, Golden and Parsley ferns, and many others.\n\nOn the fort at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Indian maiden hair (Adiantum lunulatum), Hare's foot and the Palm fern (Asplenium radiatum) are common. In river beds near the eastern spurs of the Gh\u00e1ts the European maiden hair (Adiantum capillus veneris) is to be found.\n\nClub mosses are common on the Sahy\u00e1dris in the rains, and Lichens and Mosses offer a large field for investigation.\n\nButton mushrooms are found near S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the rains.\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nLIST OF THE PRINCIPAL MAH\u00c1BALESHVAR PLANTS.\u00b9\n\nWith the exception of orchids and ferns, the list comprises the plants on the hill only. \"The hill\" has been considered to extend as far as the seventieth mile on the P\u00e1nchgani road, the thirtieth mile on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra road, and the seventy-third mile on the road to D\u00e1sgaon. Lingmalla, Elphinstone Point, and Arthur's Seat are included. As orchids and ferns from the Koyna valley are constantly offered for sale at Mah\u00e1baleshvar, the list of these plants includes those of the Koyna valley:\n\n1.

Supplies the myrobalans of commerce. |\n\n\u00b9 Supplied by Dr. T. Cooke, Principal of the Poona College of Science.\n\n\u00b2 The myrobalan tree is found throughout the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra district, but in special abundance in the Mah\u00e1baleshvar forests, the hill soil apparently being well suited to its growth. The fruit, the chebulic myrobalan of commerce, is about the size of a damson, though more pointed at one end, of a deep green colour, and contains a hard seed; when dry it becomes blackish and very hard and shrivelled. It is not edible in its natural state, but when mixed with the Beheda and Avla the powder is taken as a stomachic and mild aperient. The fruit is much valued in tanning and dyeing and finds a good market in Bombay for export to Europe. It is also used in outlying districts in making an ink which is stronger and more lasting than the usual country ink. The best is prepared in the following manner: Six pints of clear water are added to two pounds of the nuts coarsely powdered, and allowed to macerate for two days in a closed iron vessel which should occasionally be shaken. On the third day the contents are pressed and filtered, four pints of water are added to the filtrate, and the whole is warmed by a gentle heat, stirring all the time. When ebullition sets in, four t\u00f3lds of sulphate of iron are added and the boiling is continued till the surface becomes light blue and the whole is reduced to between three and four pints exclusive of the precipitate. It should now be gradually cooled stirring all the time, strained through a clean piece of calico, and put into stoppered bottles. During the six following days the bottles should be placed daily in the sun for about four hours; on the sixth day two or three ounces of dilute gum are added to give it a proper consistency. Ink thus prepared is more suitable for European pens than for the reed pen used in native writing. Up to the year 1877 the Hirda nuts in the Mah\u00e1baleshvar forest were left to the people who gathered and brought them for sale to a few dealers at Mah\u00e1baleshvar. After this it was considered that the villagers would be as much benefited by giving the produce of the whole reserve to a contractor, who, in his own interest, would pay them a fair price for the quantity brought in and also prevent other dealers from interfering. In 1877 the contract fetched \u00a386 (Rs. 860) and in 1878 \u00a361 (Rs. 610). In 1879 the nuts were bought by the Forest Department and\n### DISTRICTS.\n\n#### Appendix B.\n**Mahabaleshvar Plants.**\n\n| Botanical Name          | Native Name | Remarks                                      |\n|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Trees\u2014continued.**    |             |                                              |\n| Eugenia jambolana       | J\u00e1mb\u00fal      | The commonest tree on the hill.               |\n| Eugenia caryophylla     | \u00c1njan       | Not common.

The quantity bought at two places within the Mahabaleshwar forests was seventy-two tons (74 khandis 14 mans and 18 patlis) and the cost \u00a3149 (Rs. 1490). At first the nuts were bought at 1\u00bdd. for nine pounds (\u00a3 6 per patli). When they became rather scarce and somewhat dry the rate was raised to 1\u00bdd. (one anna); and towards the end of the season, when the nuts were dry and hard, 1\u00bdd. (1\u00bd anna) was given.

For\nmany years the Chinese ticket-of-leave men sold it to the Commissariat and to the Parsis who use arrowroot largely. Judging from the market value, five to six pounds to the rupee, it is very inferior to West Indian arrowroot which is the produce of a different plant. In 1876-77, when the famine pressed heavily on the surrounding villages, a few of the poorer classes were induced to try arrowroot but they raised objections and never took it so long as any other food was procurable. In 1878 from 500 to 600 pounds were prepared by a European resident at a cost of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ pounds for the rupee. Samples were sent for analysis to Messrs. Treacher and Co., Phillips and Co., and Kemp and Co. The colour and taste were pronounced good, but it was found deficient in nutritive properties, and in the end the owner was obliged to sell it at eight pounds the rupee.\n\nThe preparation is simple. A labourer can gather from four to five large basketsful in a day at a cost of $1\\frac{1}{3}d.$ (1 anna) the basket. The root is scraped, washed, and reduced to a pulp by rubbing on a grater. Pounding in a mortar has been tried but found to smash the globules of which the root is composed. After being reduced to a pulp the arrowroot is washed in large flat basins or half barrels which must be well cleaned so as not to give any taste. To clean it thoroughly twelve to fifteen washings are necessary. The sediment should be stirred each time fresh water is added. During the first washing the water is muddy, and a dark scum settles on the top of the sediment. This scum gradually disappears with each washing, but the washing must be continued until the sediment is pure white and the water is not discoloured. Care should be taken when emptying the water not to disturb the sediment. When the washing is complete, the arrowroot dries into a hard cake, which is easily removed and afterwards pounded into powder. Each basket yields from three to four pounds of pure arrowroot.\nAPPENDIX C.\n\nCamps.\n\nThe district has 105 camps of which four are in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division, nine in Koregaon, nine in W\u00e1i, ten in J\u00e1vli, twelve in Kar\u00e1d, thirteen in V\u00e1lva, twenty-four in P\u00e1tan, five in T\u00e1sgaon, seven in Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur, seven in Khat\u00e1v, and five in M\u00e1n.\n\nIn the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra sub-division T\u00e1sgaon, eight miles south-east near the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Rahimatpur road, is a good camp. Parli, five miles west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, has a tolerable camp close to the village. Shendre four miles south-west adjoining the mail road, and Vaduth five miles north-east on the old Poona road, are excellent camps.\n\nIn Koregaon itself the best is Kumtha an excellent camp in hard soil two miles north. Lh\u00e1surne, two miles west, is a magnificent grove of mangoes and palms and in beauty yields to none in the district, but has the drawback of being on black soil. It is a good starting point for Jalandar hill. Kinhal, the village of the Pant Pritinidhi, is an excellent camp and starting point for visiting fort Nandgiri and the north-east of the sub-division. Deur, twelve miles north of Koregaon, has a travellers' bungalow and a mile north of the village a large mango grove forming an excellent camp. For the north of the sub-division Pimpoda Budrukh is a tolerable camp close to the W\u00e1i-\u00c1darki pass road; a better camp but less accessible is Sonke, a mile north of the road. Chavneshvar, three miles west of Sonke, is a pleasant resort in the hot weather, south of the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass. Udtare ten miles, and Panchvad eight miles south-east of W\u00e1i, are fair camps. Vair\u00e1gad and the big tree at Mhasve can be conveniently visited from Panchvad.\n\nAt W\u00e1i are a fair camp and a travellers' bungalow. The situation of the camp on the river is picturesque but there is some danger of fever in the cold season. The western part of the sub-division is hilly and carts run as far as Asre nine miles north-west up the valley. Tolerable shade can be had here for small hill tents. It is a good starting point for a visit to Kenjalgad fort three miles north-west, and Kam\u00e1lgad fort four miles north-east. Up the Jor valley there is a tolerable little camp at Part\u00e1vdi thirteen miles west. P\u00e1nchgani the hill-station has an excellent travellers' bungalow. Five miles south-east of W\u00e1i is a beautiful mango grove at Kavtha, the best camp for visiting the south-east of the sub-division. North of the Kh\u00e1matk\u00ed pass in the Khand\u00e1la petty division the best camps are, for Khand\u00e1la itself Ajnuj two miles west. The east of the petty division is badly off for camps. At Ahire four miles east of Khand\u00e1la is a good grove but very near the village. In the west there is an excellent camp at Lohom seven miles west of Khand\u00e1la and Shirval camp ten miles north cannot be surpassed.\n\nAt Medha the head-quarters is a decent travellers' bangalow. For the Kud\u00e1l valley the large banian tree at Mhasve ten miles north-east of Medha forms an excellent camp. For the Gh\u00e1ts in the neighbourhood of Malcolm Peth, Moleshvar five miles south-east, and Avk\u00e1l\u00ed five miles east, are the best. For Prat\u00e1pgad and the western Koyna valley the V\u00e1da\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. J. W. P. Muir-Mackenzie, C.S.\nor Ambenali bungalow is excellent. Going down the Koyna, for Makrandgad or the Saddleback, Kasrud is a capital grove three miles south-west. From thence eighteen miles south-east is B\u00e1mnoli a fair camp only and five miles south of B\u00e1mnoli is T\u00e1mbi with a tolerably big tree giving shade to hill tents and the best starting point for V\u00e1sota fort. Dare two miles west of B\u00e1mnoli, is a fair camp for the \u00c1mboli pass; Kolghar four miles north-east of B\u00e1mnoli, is an excellent grove in the shoulder of the hill between B\u00e1mnoli and Medha, and K\u00e1s five miles south-east of B\u00e1mnoli with its new tank and irrigation bungalow, is a delightful resort in the hot weather.\n\nIn the north twenty miles north of Kar\u00e1d is Atit with a travellers\u2019 bungalow. Umbraj, ten miles north-west of Kar\u00e1d, has a pleasant bungalow belonging to the Public Works Department. The adjoining village of Shevde has an excellent dense grove of mangoes but in rather a breezeless situation and damp in the cold weather. Belavde taraf Haveli has a nice grove six miles north of Kar\u00e1d and a quarter of a mile south of the mail road. Talbid a mile north, and close under, Vasantgad has a magnificent mango grove which however is difficult to reach, the mile of cross country track being very rough. Kar\u00e1d itself has a camp on the west bank of the Koyna river. The shade is thin and the camp not desirable. The travellers\u2019 bungalow is also unfortunately very dusty. A convenient camp for Kar\u00e1d is Jakhinv\u00e1di, four miles south, with good shade, and adjoining the chief Buddhist caves. For the V\u00e1ng valley Kolev\u00e1di, nine miles west-south-west of Kar\u00e1d, is a perfect camp and for K\u00e1le and its neighbourhood Vond, though small, is a first rate camp. At the extreme south good shade can be found at M\u00e1lkhed on the mail road nine miles from Kar\u00e1d. On the left bank of the Krishna there is an excellent camp at Masur for the north-east and Shenoli ten miles south-east of Kar\u00e1d for the south-east of the sub-division. Shenoli is a good starting point for a visit to Machhindragad fort one mile south.\n\nAt the extreme north of the V\u00e1lva sub-division is K\u00e1segaon with an excellent Assistant Collector\u2019s bungalow. Nerla, three miles south-east of K\u00e1segaon, has a travellers\u2019 bungalow and a tolerable camp. Peth has, half a mile south of the town, a pleasant shady but rather small camp. Isl\u00e1mpur, four miles south-east of Peth, has, close by the road but well outside the town, an excellent mango grove. Ashta, twelve miles south-east of Isl\u00e1mpur, has good shade but a very dusty camp which should be avoided. Convenient for work at Ashta is B\u00e1gni four miles south-west with an excellent grove. For the south of the sub-division Yelur, nine miles south of Peth and a mile west of the Kolh\u00e1pur road, has a very good camp. For the Shir\u00e1la petty division Biur, about two miles south-west of Shir\u00e1la, has a nice little camp and Kokrud, ten miles further up the V\u00e1rna valley on the Kolh\u00e1pur frontier, has an excellent shade. For the hills Arle and Peth Lond and Rundhiv (the old village site) and Shivdeshvar have good camps.\n\nFor the T\u00e1rl\u00ed valley Nune, one mile east of T\u00e1rl\u00ed, has a small but shady grove. Up the valley shade can be had for a small tent at Murudh about six miles north-west of T\u00e1rl\u00ed as far as which carts can penetrate with difficulty. The Ch\u00e1phal valley is badly off. The usual camp is at Ch\u00e1phal six miles east of P\u00e1tan but it is not good. Upon the hills above the T\u00e1rl\u00ed valley, Jalu six miles west, and Pabulv\u00e1di hamlet in the village of Vajroshi and on the T\u00e1rl\u00ed-P\u00e1tan road, are decidedly good camps. For the Koyna valley, the first camp is Malh\u00e1rpeth with good shade on the banks of the Koyna well situated. At P\u00e1tan itself is excellent shade but the camp has a drawback in the proximity of the hundreds of carts which rest here on their way to Chiplun.\nAppendix C.\n\nThree miles south-west is a fine grove at Yerad charmingly situated. But this camp should be avoided after April when the yearly fair takes place to the poisoning of the air and water in the neighbourhood. Helv\u00e1k, thirteen miles west of P\u00e1tan, has a bungalow belonging to the Public Works Department. The accommodation for tents is poor, and better can perhaps be found at Ras\u00e1ti a village half a mile north. Proceeding up the Koyna valley good shade is found at Mirgaon four miles and at Devgad eight miles north of Helv\u00e1k. Devgad is within easy reach of T\u00e1mbi in the J\u00e1vli sub-division. North-west of P\u00e1tan, for the Kera valley, Nivkhane, eight miles north-west of P\u00e1tan is a delightful camp in a sacred grove on a ledge of the hill side. People usually direct officers to the groves in the valley below. Inquiry therefore should be made for the sacred grove or ban to the south of the village. On the corresponding ledge of the western slope is fair shade at Gojegaon. Good hill camps are at Karvat six miles west-north-west of P\u00e1tan and Gh\u00e1nbi three miles north of Karvat. On the hills west of Helv\u00e1k Torna, three miles north-west, contains a capital little grove deliciously high and cool. In the south of the sub-division Mala has a fair camp on the ridge of the Sahy\u00e1dris. P\u00e1nchgani, eight miles south-west of P\u00e1tan on the way to Mala, is a capital camp. From Mala twelve miles east lead to Palshi a fine camp at the head of the V\u00e1ng valley. Paneri, three miles south-east of Palshi, is a fair camp. A delightful march of twelve miles south-east along the hill plateau brings to Nivi, a small but pleasant camp. Five miles more over roughish country lead to a sacred grove in a hamlet of K\u00e1lgaon village. This grove makes a nice camp but is inaccessible. For the V\u00e1ng valley Gudhe or Kutre, from four to eight miles north of K\u00e1lgaon, give the best shade.\n\nT\u00e1sgaon.\n\nT\u00e1sgaon itself has very fair shade in a grove immediately to the south of the town. There are fair camps also at Vis\u00e1pur six miles north, Palus nine miles north-west, Akhalkop nine miles north, Bhose nine miles south-east, and N\u00e1gaj, for the extreme east of the sub-division about thirty miles north-east.\n\nKh\u00e1ndapur.\n\nFor the north-west of the Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur sub-division there is an excellent camp at Up\u00e1le about twelve miles north-west of Vita to be distinguished from the neighbouring village of Up\u00e1le Khurd. For the west, Kadegaon on the Kar\u00e1d-Bij\u00e1pur road, about twelve miles west of Vita, is an excellent camp. About six miles south-east of Kadegaon, V\u00e1ngi has a small bungalow. Vadgaon, four miles south-west of V\u00e1ngi, has a fine camp within easy hail of the interesting temples of Devr\u00e1shta. Vita itself is well provided with shade; the spot to choose is not the tempting grove just outside the eastern gate, but a long line of lofty mangoes further distant. Kh\u00e1n\u00e1pur village, twelve miles east of Vita, has a good shade in a grove a quarter of a mile west; but the place is sometimes infested with mosquitos. Immediately north of the town, adjoining a well, is a more desirable spot. Seven miles north-east of Vita, Lengre has a fair camp, the only tolerable one in the north-east of the sub-division.\n\nKhat\u00e1v.\n\nKhat\u00e1v has plenty of good camps. In the west Pusegaon, on the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra-Pandharpur road, is fair and close to Vardhangad fort and the large Nher irrigation tank. Khat\u00e1gun, three miles east of Pusegaon, has an irrigation bungalow. In the north Budh, about twenty miles north-west of Vaduj, and Diks\u00e1l, three miles north-west of Budh, have excellent groves. Diks\u00e1l is the best point from which to visit the fort of T\u00e1th\u00e1vade six miles to the north-east. Vaduj the head-quarter station has a very pleasant camp. In the south-east the M\u00e1yni irrigation bungalow is almost the only tolerable piedaterre. In the south-west Puses\u00e1vli about fifteen\nmiles south-west of Vaduj has a small bungalow and a good grove for tents.\n\nM\u00e1n is very badly off for trees. Pingli, four miles south-east of Dahivadi, has a fair camp. The shade is good but the adjacent sugar-cane cultivation and a stream-bed close by are sometimes unpleasant. Shingnapur in the north-east, thirteen miles north-east of Dahivadi, is one of the places best worth a visit in the district. The camp is excellent but the place is off the line of march for district officers. Mhasvad has only a few straggling mangoes. Varkute in the south-west has one large tree under which a tent can go and is the best camp for that part of the sub-division. Palshi, five miles east of Dahivadi, has a tolerable shady ground for tents. There are no good camps elsewhere, a fact that greatly adds to the unpleasantness of this sub-division, the only really disagreeable part of the district.\nAPPENDIX D.\n\nDASARA PROCESSION.\n\nThe great feature of the Dasara festival at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra during the times of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra was the procession on the tenth or great day of the month of \u00c1shvin or September-October. For nine days prior to this, religious ceremonies in honour of Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i, the goddess of Tulj\u00e1pur, were performed day and night, with but a few hours' intermission, in a large wooden booth, being a permanent erection in the inner quadrangle of the Rang Mah\u00e1l or residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. This deity seems to have been one of the favourite objects of devotion of the Bhonsle family, and enjoyed the monopoly of the Dasara ceremonies. The utsav or celebration commenced daily by singing from nine in the morning till noon. Then, for the space of an hour daily, the Bahurupis, a troop of male actors, danced and amused the devotees by appearing in a variety of characters and dresses. Following this came dances performed by troops of dancing girls or N\u00e1khins. Then, towards night, sacred sermons or kirtans in honour of the deity were repeated and explanations of them given by learned Sh\u00e1stras or divines; and when these ceased, somewhere about the hour of midnight, the praises of the deity were sung until early dawn. During these nine days also numbers of Br\u00e1hmans, as many as would come, were fed in the Rang Mah\u00e1l, and a distribution of uncooked food was made to persons of other castes at the R\u00e1ja's storehouses and at other convenient places.\n\nAll these ceremonies and festivities, however, culminated on the tenth day with the grand procession of the R\u00e1ja and his chiefs and followers. Immediately before setting out on this the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, with his own hand, killed, or rather struck the first blow at the Dasara buffalo, a sacrifice to Amb\u00e1b\u00e1i. This procession in which in the time of Prat\u00e1psinh, the last R\u00e1ja but one (1818-1839), as many as seventy-five elephants often appeared, left the Rang Mah\u00e1l so soon as the heat of the day had passed, and proceeded at a slow pace along the upper road, which now leads nearly direct from the subsequently erected palaces to the post-office, to the Poyi-che N\u00e1ke, immediately above the present post-office, the road on either side being lined with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's troops. The procession was headed by the so-called Dh\u00e1kta Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji or Appa S\u00e1heb, the younger brother of Prat\u00e1psinh, who, in contradistinction, was known as the Thorla Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j and his followers, next to him came the Thorla Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j himself and his followers, then the Pritinidni, then the Akalkotkar, then the Sachiv, then the Nimb\u00e1lkar, then the Daphlekar, and finally Shaikh Miri of W\u00e1\u00ed. Besides the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's own suite and the private suites of each of these chiefs, the majority of them were bound to furnish a contingent of cavalry sv\u00e1rs to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. The Akalkotkar furnished 100 of these sv\u00e1rs, the Nimb\u00e1lkar seventy-five, the Daphlekar fifty, and Shaikh Miri twenty, and all of these sv\u00e1rs took part in the procession. In the rear of all these chiefs and their suites followed the principal citizens according to their rank and privileges on elephants and horses, in carriages or litters and with or without an umbrella or torch-bearer; and these so swelled the length of the procession that its head often reached the Poyi-che N\u00e1ke, a distance of nearly two miles, before\nthe rear had started the spur running east from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra hill fort, the whole being crowded with the general mass of sightseers who had no right to take part in the procession. As the royal party passed slowly on, the troops who had lined the road filed off, and, by a quick march, the majority reached the neighbourhood of the Pohi-che N\u00e1ke before the royal party, who proceeded by a lower road, and were there drawn up in line in readiness for its reception. Meantime, elephants and an escort had been sent on to the Residency, and, as the royal procession reached the Pohi-che N\u00e1ke, the Resident on his elephant and attended by his escort also arrived at the spot. Then followed an exchange of salutes, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's troops saluting first, twenty-one guns and five volleys, the British troops, also drawn up on the spot, responding. After this, there was a brief exchange of courtesies, followed by a fresh exchange of salutes, and then the Resident and his party turned homewards, while the procession proceeded to encircle the maid\u00e1n below, where, according to a custom of the day a large branch of the \u00e1pta or Bauhinia racemosa and of the shami or Prosopis spicegera had been set up. These trees are still worshipped and then felled, and all who desire take small twigs and distribute the leaves to their friends, saying in so doing \"This is gold.\" Having performed this ceremony, which indeed formed the real object of the procession, it proceeded homeward and, as darkness came on, torches were lighted, and the weirdness of the scene intensified. After the return, it was customary for the chiefs and all other loyal citizens to present n\u00e1jars to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, his brother, and his wife. The first class s\u00e1rd\u00e1rs usually presented a n\u00e1jar of five gold mohars to the elder Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, and a similar gift to his wife, and a single gold mohar to the younger Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, and the crowd usually tendered a n\u00e1jar of 2s. (Re. 1) each but never a smaller coin. All were expected to offer something to the elder Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, but only their particular followers tendered n\u00e1jars to the R\u00e1ni and the younger Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j; all the sums thus tendered were credited to the private accounts of the recipients. In return for these gifts posk\u00e1k or dress of honour was distributed, either on the same day or previously. The dress of honour given to first class s\u00e1rd\u00e1rs consisted of five articles, including a turban or p\u00e1goti, a scarf or dupeta, a piece of satin or brocade, and two pieces of fine linen. The dress of honour given to second class s\u00e1rd\u00e1rs consisted of three and a half articles including a turban, a scarf, a piece of fine linen and half a piece of brocade. Other persons only got two articles, a turban and a scarf, others again received the dress of honour on alternate years or every third year. Servants and menial dependants received usually only a turban. A dress of honour was also sent at this festival to the Resident, and through him to the Governor of Bombay, and in return the Resident sent similar presents to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja at Christmas. After the receipt of the n\u00e1jars, all attended the ceremonies at the booth, and the festival was wound up by a general distribution of cocoanuts. In the days of Prat\u00e1psinh all the residences of the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs and s\u00e1rd\u00e1rs were situated at the bottom of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra hill fort along the road now leading from the post-office to the tunnel. From the east first came the residence of the Akalkotkar, next the Rang Mah\u00e1l where the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja himself lived, then the old ad\u00e1lat which was the Peshwa's residence until the time of Sh\u00e1hu's reign, then the Sachiv's mansion or v\u00e1da, beyond that came the Daphle's p\u00e1ga and to the extreme west the v\u00e1da of the Pratinidhi of which now no trace remains. The Nimb\u00e1lkar never had a residence at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's guns and his Mogl\u00e1\u00ed cavalry were quartered near the site of the present jail. His body-guard consisting of 200 cavalry were\naccommodated in the present ris\u00e1la, the head-quarters of the mounted police and the infantry were quartered near the Rang Mah\u00e1l. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1ji or Appa S\u00e1heb removed the troops to the Genda Mah\u00e1l.\n\nIn the days referred to the greater portion of the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra including all that part to the north of the present upper road to the palaces was mostly open country.
