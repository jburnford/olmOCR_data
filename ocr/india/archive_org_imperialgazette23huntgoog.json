Area, 5691 square miles; pop. (1872), 431,069 persons. Bounded on the north by the Districts of Henzada and Tharawadi, on the east by Shwe-gyeng, and on the west by Thun-khwa. On the first formation of Rangoon District it included Bhaw-n\u00ed, a strip of country extending along the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yoma Hills from the Bhaw-n\u00ed-ga-le stream to Toung-ng\u00fa. In 1864, Bhaw-n\u00ed was added to Toung-ng\u00fa, and in 1866, transferred to Shwe-gyeng. Smaller circles have also been transferred from the District, or added to it, from time to time. The headquarters of the District are at RANGOON CITY.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Rangoon District consists of a vast plain extending along the sea-coast, and gradually rising towards the north, where it is broken about the centre by the lower slopes of the Pegu Yomas. South of the Pegu river, in the greater portion of the Hlaing valley, and for some distance above Rangoon city, the country is intersected by numerous tidal creeks, many of which are navigable by large boats. The chief of these are\u2014the BHAW-LAY, with its branch, the Pa-kwon, communicating with the Irawadi, and practicable during the rains for river steamers; the PAN-HLAING, which leaves the Irawadi at Gnyoung-d\u00fan and joins the Hlaing a few miles above Rangoon city, forming in the rains the usual route of river steamers from Rangoon; the Tha-khwot-peng (popularly 'BASSEIN CREEK'), which connects the Rangoon river with the To or China Bakir, and is navigable at all seasons, river steamers using it in the dry season when the Pan-hlaing is closed.\n\nThe Pegu Yomas attain their highest elevation, viz. 2000 feet, in the\nextreme north of Rangoon District, and, a few miles lower down, divide into two main branches with many subsidiary spurs. The western branch, which has a general south-south-west direction, separates the valleys of the Hlaing and Pu-zwon-doung rivers. After rising into the irregularly shaped limestone hill called Toung-gnyo, a little south of lat. 17\u00b0 N., and forming the laterite hills round the great Shwe-Dagon pagoda, and beyond the Pegu river, it merges into the alluvial plains of the delta, being last traceable in the rocks in the Hmaw-won stream. The eastern branch of the Pegu Yomas has a south-south-east direction, and finally disappears south of the Pegu river. The slopes of the main range are, as a rule, steep, and the valleys sharply excavated.\n\nThe principal river in the District is the Hlaing, which rises near Prome as the Zay, and, entering Rangoon in about lat. 17\u00b0 30' N., flows south-south-east, falling into the sea, in about lat. 16\u00b0 30' N., under the name of the Rangoon river. It is navigable at all seasons by the largest sea-going vessels as far as Rangoon city. Its chief tributaries are the Uk-kan, Ma-ga-ri, Hmaw-bhi, and Lien-gun. On the west, the Bhaw-lay, Pan-hlaing, and other tidal creeks connect it with the Irawadi. The Pu-zwon-doung rises in the southern spurs of the Pegu Yomas, and falls into the Pegu river at the city of Rangoon, after a south-easterly course of 53 miles through a valley rich in valuable timber, and well cultivated towards the south. The Pegu River rises in the eastern slopes of the main range, and falls into the Rangoon river at Rangoon city; it is navigable during the rains by river steamers up to Pegu, and the tide is felt for some miles above that town. It is connected with the Tsit-toung by a canal with locks.\n\nThe principal trees found in the District are the mangrove, largely used for fuel; pyeng-ma (Lagerstroemia regin\u00e6); ka-gnyeng (Dipterocarpus alatus); eng (Dipterocarpus tuberculatus); pyeng-ka-do (Xylia dolabriformis), etc. There are two small teak 'reserves'\u2014one on the western slopes of the Yomas, in the valley of the Ma-ga-ri, and another on the right bank of the Pegu river, near its source.\n\nHistory.\u2014Local legends, said to be confirmed by Telugu and Tamil traditions, state that in some unknown century before Christ, the inhabitants of Telingana or Northern Madras colonized the coast of Burma, finding there a M\u00fcn (Moon) population, by which designation the Peguans still call themselves, whilst Telingana appears in the modern word Talaing. The Palm-leaf Records assert that the Shwe-Dagon pagoda was founded by two brothers, who had met and conversed with Gautama Buddha in India. But the first notice of the country that can be considered as historical, is given in the Singhalese Mahanwanso, which mentions the mission of Sono and Uttaro, sent by the third Buddhist Council (244 B.C.) to Suvarna-bhumi ('Aurea Regio') to spread the Buddhist faith. It seems clear that the delta of the Irawadi did not\nescape from the contest between the followers of the Br\u00e1hmanical and Buddhist faiths, which lasted for hundreds of years, until about the end of the 8th century the victory eventually passed to the one body in India, and to the other in Burma. One of the results of these religious differences was the foundation of the city of Pegu in 573 A.D. by Tha-ma-la and Wi-ma-la, sons of the King of Tha-ht\u00fan by a mother of N\u00e1ga descent, who were excluded from the throne of their father. Tha-ma-la was anointed King, and would seem to have extended his dominions considerably to the eastward, as he is said to have built Martaban. He was succeeded by his brother Wi-ma-la, who founded Tsit-toung, and during whose reign the country was unsuccessfully invaded (in 590 A.D.) by the King of Bij-ja-na-ga-ran. Thirteen kings are said to follow between this period and 746 A.D.; and by the latter time the kingdom included the whole country of Rama-gnya, from the Arakan Mountains on the west to the Salw\u00edn river on the east, including the former capital, Tha-ht\u00fan, which had much declined in importance.\n\nEven at this time, Buddhism was not generally accepted in the country; and the tenth king of Pegu, P\u00fan-na-r\u00ed-ka (Br\u00e1hman heart), and more especially his son and successor, Tek-tha, appear to have at least inclined towards Hindu traditions. With the death of Tek-tha ended the third dynasty of Pegu, for the succession had been more than once disturbed by usurpers. The length of time during which these three dynasties occupied the throne is doubtful, and it is by no means clear when Tek-tha died. A gap now occurs, owing to the unwillingness of Talaing historians to disclose the religious revolutions in their country during the 9th and 10th centuries, and its conquest by A-naw-ra-hta, King of Pagan in 1050. After this date, it remained subject to the Burmese for two centuries. The gradual disintegration of the Burmese kingdom, the capture of its capital by the Chinese army of the Mongol Emperor, Kublai Kh\u00e1n (1283\u201384 A.D.), and the flight of the king to Bassein, were taken advantage of by the Talaings, who rose in rebellion. A man named Wa-r\u00ed-y\u00fa killed the Burmese Governor of Martaban, and made himself master of that town and the surrounding country. A-kham-won, who had headed a rising in Pegu, now leagued himself with Wa-r\u00ed-y\u00fa, and their united army defeated the forces of the King of Burma, and pursued them as far as Pa-doung, a few miles below Prome. The Talaings then retired to Pegu; but disputes ensued, which ended in the death of A-kham-won or Ta-ra-bya, and in his rival being declared ruler of the entire country. Shortly after this, Wa-r\u00ed-y\u00fa was killed by two sons of A-kham-won, and was succeeded in 1306 by his brother, who only reigned four years.\n\nFrom 1385 to 1421, Raza-dhie-rit was on the throne. He repelled a formidable invasion of the Burmese, and in 1388 regained possession of Martaban and the country to the eastward, which had been lost in a\nprevious reign. The history of Rangoon District during this period is nothing but a series of internecine struggles and wars with the Burmese. It was probably during the reign of Raza-dhie-rit that the country was first visited by Europeans. Nicholas Conti was in Pegu, 'a very populous city, the circumference of which is 12 miles,' in 1430. Antonio Correa made a treaty at Martaban in 1519 with Bya-gnya-ran, the tenth monarch after Raza-dhie-rit; and from this time onwards, there was considerable intercourse between European soldiers of fortune and the kings of Pegu, who sought their aid. For the local history of Rangoon town, see the next article.\n\nIn the 16th century (circa 1538), Pegu was conquered by Ta-beng-shwe-ht\u00ed, King of Toung-ng\u00fa, and thus ended the dynasty founded by Wa-r\u00ed-y\u00fa. Ta-beng-shwe-ht\u00ed took Martaban, and, returning to Pegu, was crowned king; and to mark his assumption of that rank, placed new 'umbrellas' on the Shwe-hmaw-daw and Shwe-Dagon pagodas. Later on, he gained possession of the country as far as Lower Pagan; in 1549, he defeated the Siamese army, and forced the King of Siam to pay tribute. But in 1550, Ta-beng-shwe-ht\u00ed was assassinated by the Governor of Tsit-toung, who proclaimed himself king. After some disturbance, Bh\u00fareng Noung, the heir-apparent, obtained his rights. He took Toung-ng\u00fa, and in 1554 declared war against Burma, and in March 1555 captured Ava. His dominions extended from Tenasserim to Arakan, and from the sea-coast northwards to the Shan States. Bh\u00fareng Noung died suddenly in 1581. He was more than a great warrior; he enlarged his capital and strengthened its walls, and in the neighbourhood he founded another town of which the massive remains still exist. He was observant of religious rites, and obtained from one of the kings of Ceylon a relic of Gautama, which he enshrined in a pagoda. Bh\u00fareng Noung also abolished the annual sacrifices to the Nat or spirits. He was succeeded by his son Nanda Bh\u00fareng, to whom all neighbouring rulers did homage, with the exception of the Burmese monarch, against whom Nanda Bh\u00fareng advanced up the Irawadi in 1584-85, and forced him to escape into China. Meanwhile, the King of Siam revolted; and four expeditions, all equally unsuccessful, were despatched against him in 1585, 1587, 1590, and 1593. These failures seem to have embittered Nanda Bh\u00fareng, and to have rendered him wantonly cruel. The Talaing Buddhist monks especially incurred his enmity, and numbers were put to death or forced to flee the country. The delta became depopulated, and utter anarchy ensued. The Arakanese seized Syriam; in 1599, Pegu was taken, and Nanda Bh\u00fareng sent captive to Toung-ng\u00fa. The kingdom was for a while left without a ruler. In 1600, Philip de Brito, then in the service of the Arakanese sovereign, was commanded to hold Syriam. He, however, proved faithless, and sided with the Portuguese\nviceroy at Goa. Being accepted by the Talaing inhabitants, he declared himself master of Pegu, of which he took possession in the name of the King of Portugal. He erected a fort and church at Syriam, and laid out a new city. The forces of the kings of Toung-ng\u00fa and Arakan were routed, and the commander made prisoner. Philip de Brito now entered into treaties with his former enemy, the King of Toung-ng\u00fa, and also with the ruler of Martaban; but having treacherously attacked the former, was himself captured by the King of Burma in 1612, and impaled. The Portuguese power in Pegu was thus finally destroyed. Pegu remained subject to Burma till 1740 A.D.; and it was during this period that the English commenced trading with Rangoon. In 1695, application was made for permission to establish a factory at Syriam; and from 1709 to 1743, English traders were settled there. But the Burmese Government, owing partly to invasions from the north, and partly to internal dissensions, was falling to pieces; and in 1740, the Peguans rose in open rebellion. Syriam was twice seized, and in 1743, in consequence of English aid being refused, our factories were burnt down. Ava was in the hands of the Peguans for a short time; but in 1753, Moung-oung-zaya, Myo-th\u00fa-gyi of M\u00fat-tsho-bo, regained the capital, and proclaimed himself king under the title of Aloung-bh\u00fara (or Alompra), thus founding the dynasty now reigning. Within four years he had conquered Pegu, Tavoy, and Mergui, and had advanced into Siam. The British sided with neither party; but, unfortunately, some of our officers were suspected by Aloung-bh\u00fara of having favoured the Peguans. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war broke out, and a British force entered the river, and took Rangoon. At the close of the campaign, the British restored Pegu to the King of Burma, but retained possession of Arakan and Tenasserim. Disputes on matters of trade led to the renewal of war in 1852, when Rangoon and Pegu were captured after severe fighting, and the lower portions of the Irawadi and Tsit-toung rivers annexed to the British dominions.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The continual wars between the Burmese, the Peguans, and the Siamese, together with internal dissensions, almost depopulated the once flourishing Talaing kingdom, of which this District formed part. Nanda Bh\u00fbreng, who reigned over Pegu and Ava from 1581 to 1599, by his cruelties forced numbers to abandon the country, and the delta became utterly deserted. The Burmese, after the conquest in 1757, set themselves steadily to extirpate the Talaing language; and after the first Burmese war, they drove thousands into the neighbouring British Provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim. In 1855, the total number of inhabitants was returned at 137,130; in 1872, at 431,069, inclusive of 98,745, the population of Rangoon city. Classified according to race, there were in 1872\u2014Burmese, 349,712; Hindus, 16,218;\nMuhammadans, 10,126; Talaings, 12,394; Karengs, 27,830; Shans, 6396; Arakanese, 302; Chinese, 3718; Europeans, Eurasians, and Americans, 2384; 'others,' 1989. Classified according to sex, there were, exclusive of Rangoon city\u2014males, 176,404; females, 155,920; total, 332,324. The percentage of males in the total population was 53.08%, being higher than in any other District of British Burma, except Akyab. Classified according to age, there were in 1872, under 12 years\u2014males, 63,821; females, 56,071; above 12\u2014males, 112,583; females, 99,849. The number of Talaings seems small, but it is probable that many shown in the returns as Burmese are really pure Talaings, and still more of mixed Burmese and Talaing blood. The Karengs belong to the Pwo and Sgaw families, and are industrious agriculturists. Many have been converted to Christianity, and the remainder profess Buddhism. The Shans are immigrants from the north, and are settled in colonies. In the Than-lyeng township are several villages occupied by the descendants of captives brought from Zeng-mai by Aloung-bh\u00fara after his invasion of that country, about 125 years ago. The number of male agriculturists over 20 years was 41,180, or rather more than one-third of the whole male adult population. The chief towns are\u2014Rangoon, the modern capital, situated on the river of the same name, with a population in 1872 of 98,745; Pegu, situated on the Pegu river, and once the capital of a flourishing kingdom, but now merely a large village, with 4948 inhabitants; Twan-te, once an important place, but now an insignificant hamlet; Syriam or Than-lyeng, on the eastern bank of the Pegu river, opposite Rangoon, the scene of the capture of De Brito by the King of Burma, in 1612. Of towns and villages there were in 1872\u20141080 with less than 200 inhabitants; 68 with from 500 to 1000; 8 with from 1000 to 2000; 1 with from 5000 to 10,000, and 1 (Rangoon) with more than 50,000.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014The principal pagodas in the District are\u2014the Shwe-Dagon, the Bo-ta-htoung, and the Ts\u00fa-lai, in Rangoon; the Kyaik-houk at Syriam; the Shwe-hmaw-daw at Pegu; and the Tshan-daw at Twan-te. The Shwe-Dagon is the most celebrated object of worship in all the Indo-Chinese countries, as enshrining several hairs of Gautama Buddha. The Shwe-hmaw-daw is the great pagoda of the Talaings. Both are fully described under separate articles. Meng-ga-la-d\u00fan, Hmaw-bh\u00ed, Hlaing, and Ht\u00e1n-bh\u00fa are sites of ancient towns.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The District is said to have once been highly cultivated; but the continual wars with the Siamese on the one hand, and with the Burmese on the other, the cruel persecutions by Nanda Bh\u00fareng at the end of the 16th century, and the measures adopted by the Burmese conquerors, depopulated the land. The British annexation gave a new stimulus, and the area under rice (the exportation of which had been prohibited some time before the second Anglo-Burmese war)\nRANGOON DISTRICT.\n\ncommenced at once to increase. The richest rice tract is in the Angyi township, which lies west of the Rangoon river and south of the Pan-hlaing, and in the lower portions of the valley of the Pegu river. In some places, the out-turn is 80 baskets of rice, or 1 ton 3 cwts., per acre; and in others, as much as 112 baskets, or 1 ton 12 cwts. Towards the north, the soil becomes much poorer, and in parts even 33 baskets, or 966 lbs., are considered a good yield. The country to the south and south-east is annually covered with so much water that cultivation can only be carried on in patches. Considerable damage was caused in former times by the leasing out of tidal streams as fisheries, the lessees having erected weirs and embankments which caused the channels to silt up, and thus become unable to carry off the rainfall. This leasing is now prohibited. The embankments in this District along the Irawadi and other rivers have not as yet been very effectual, and at times disastrous floods occur. In 1876-77, the total area under rice was 669,313 acres; of garden land, 19,208; under miscellaneous crops (on which revenue was payable), 3718. The gardens and orchards are found principally near Rangoon. Mangoes, jacks, plantains, and mayan (a kind of acid plum) are grown in abundance. At Twan-te is a small grove of Sapodilla plum-trees, producing the royal fruit of the Talaings. In 1868, a pair of buffaloes or plough bullocks cost \u00a310; by 1877-78, the price had doubled. The average holding of an agriculturist is larger in Rangoon than anywhere else in the Province; in 1852, it was found to be about 10 acres, and in 1872, according to the Census, 11'47 acres. The latest returns state the average to be 19 acres. In 1877, there were 54 revenue-free holdings, covering an area of 66,160 acres. Every owner of upwards of 8 acres hires labourers, who are paid by the season, and live with the farmer. The engagement includes ploughing, sowing, reaping, thrashing, and garnering, and the rate of payment per harvest is usually 150 baskets (2 tons 3 cwts. 14 lbs.) of rice, worth from \u00a310 to \u00a315, according to market prices. Coolies are now engaged in gangs, varying in number from 20 to 100, and are paid from \u00a35 to \u00a38 for an area yielding about 1000 baskets of rice. In the neighbourhood of Rangoon city, the rate rises as high as \u00a315. The hirer has to supply the labourers with rice, oil, and tamarinds. The annual expenditure of a family of six persons owning 10 acres of land has been calculated at \u00a348. Such a holding will produce rice to the value of about \u00a360, and the profit should thus be about \u00a312.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014West of the Hlaing river, from the north to a little south of the Pan-hlaing, and especially in the Aing-ka-loung and Bhaw-lay circles, the country is liable to inundation. The embankments along the west bank of the Irawadi and Nga-won, which protect large areas of good land in the Henzada, Thun-khwa, and Bassein Districts, cause the floods\u2014which formerly spread west and east\u2014to\nflow eastward to a far greater extent than before. The flood water enters by the numerous creeks connecting the Irawadi with the Hlaing, and, passing down the Pan-hlaing, forces back the Hlaing, causing much mischief. In 1876-77, the crops were ruined over no less than 171,000 acres, entailing much suffering on the people, serious remissions of land revenue, and an extensive emigration. Again, in 1877-78, 65,339 acres of rice land were irretrievably damaged by inundation.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The principal articles manufactured in Rangoon District are salt, pottery, nga-pi or fish-paste, mats, and silk and cotton cloth. The pottery and fish-paste alone are exported. Salt is made during the hot weather at various places along the sea-coast, and in the Syriam and An-gyi townships, partly by solar evaporation and partly by boiling in iron or earthen pots. The boiling season lasts for about two months, and the average out-turn from each pot may be taken at 250 viss, or about 8 cwts., which would sell for \u00a31, 16s. or \u00a31, 18s. The quantity manufactured is decreasing year by year, owing to the cheapness of the imported English salt. Pots for salt-boiling are made at Kwon-khyan-gun, and in the adjoining village of Taw-pa-lwai in the An-gyi township. The price per hundred varies from \u00a34, 10s. to \u00a39. A party of four good workmen will turn out from 100 to 125 pots per diem. The cost of 100 baskets of sand is 16s.; of earth, 5s. The mixer gets 2s. a day; the wheel-turner, fashioner, and finisher, each get 6s. per 100 pots. The expenditure during a season for manufacturing 1250 pots is estimated at \u00a350, and the net profit at \u00a325. Ordinary cooking pots cost from 12s. to 16s. per 100 in the cold season, and 10s. in the rains. A water-pot costs 3d. in Rangoon city. At Twan-te are made large water or oil vessels, glazed outside with a mixture of galena and rice-water, and commonly known as 'Pegu jars.' Nga-pi and coarse mats, used for ships' holds, are made chiefly in An-gyi. Silk-worms are reared in the Hlaing township, and silk and cotton cloth are woven in almost every house. The trade of the District centres in RANGOON CITY. Communication is carried on mainly by the numerous tidal creeks of the District. The total length of water-way is 505 miles. A new canal has recently been cut from Kha-ra-tshu on the Paing-kyun creek to Myit-kyo on the Tsit-toung. The principal roads are one from Rangoon city towards Prome, now taken up by the Irawadi Valley State Railway; the Rangoon and Toung-ngu road from Htouk-kyan to Pegu, crossing the Pegu river by a wooden bridge, and proceeding northwards along the eastern foot of the Pegu Yomas. The Rangoon and Irawadi Valley State Railway runs nearly due north for 60\u00bd miles to the Mi-neng river, with stations at Tha-maing (about to be removed to Pouk-taw, near Engt-sien), Hlaw-ga, Hmaw-bhi, Taik-gyi, and Ukkan. The line is single, with a gauge of 3'281833 feet.\n\nThe only institution in the District is the Rangoon Literary Society,\nwith 143 members on the 31st of March 1878. There are eight printing presses in the city of Rangoon, at which six newspapers and five other periodicals are published. The mails are carried daily by railway from Rangoon northwards, and once a week by mail-cart from Rangoon via Htouk-kyan to Pegu. There are also postal lines from the capital to Kyok-tan, Twan-te, and Taw-la-tai on the Hlaing river.\n\nRevenue.\u2014No records exist showing the exact revenue raised in the District before British annexation. The amounts were fixed in vis (3\u00b765 lbs.) of Rwek-ni silver, each of which is equivalent to about \u00a313. The total sum paid by the people under Burmese rule has been estimated at about \u00a3114,560. In 1853-54, the net revenue was \u00a354,509; in 1855-56, \u00a396,040. The gross revenue in 1877-78, excluding sea customs, but including the imperial revenue of Rangoon city and the income derived from local funds (exclusive of Rangoon town), was \u00a3323,251. The imperial revenue of Rangoon city in 1877-78 was \u00a373,582. The land, capitation tax, fisheries, and sea customs yield the largest portion of the income. The fisheries are leased out for a term of five years, and only bona fide fishermen living near can bid. Under Burmese rule, Rangoon District consisted of several townships, each under an officer, and the whole was controlled by a governor with the power of life and death, who was in direct communication with the Government at Ava. When the British took possession of the country, the local jurisdictions were to a great extent retained; a Deputy Commissioner was placed in charge of the District, and a myo-uk appointed to each township with limited judicial, fiscal, and police powers, with thugyis in charge of circles, and goungs under them in charge of villages. Since then little alteration has been made in the general principles of administration, with four exceptions\u2014(1) the formation in 1861-62 of a regular police; (2) a few years later, of an independent prison department; (3) later still, of an educational department; (4) and recently, the almost entire separation of Rangoon city from the District. Rangoon District now comprises 3 Subdivisions, each containing 2 townships. The number of revenue circles is 53. There are 10 courts in the District, presided over by officers exercising civil, criminal, and revenue powers. The Deputy Commissioner, as District judge, hears all civil appeals. No village is more than 44 miles from any court, and the average distance is 26 miles. Gang-robberies, which were very frequent for several years after the annexation, are now of rare occurrence. The police force consists of a superintendent, with 46 subordinate officers and 503 men; total, 550. The total cost in 1877 was \u00a312,304. The central prison is situated in Rangoon city. Schools were opened many years ago by both Roman Catholic and Baptist missionaries; but for long they were confined to the city, the education of the rural classes being left\nentirely in the hands of the Buddhist monks. In 1867, there were 54 village mission schools aided by Government, chiefly for Karengs. In 1873, a cess school was established in Pegu. Rangoon city contains a high school, St. John's College, and a diocesan school.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate is generally depressing, though December and January are cool bracing months, with little rain. The rains last from about the beginning of May till the middle of November, and are usually accompanied by considerable electrical disturbance. The average annual rainfall is returned at 98.24 inches. Fever, rheumatism, and pulmonary complaints are prevalent. The dispensary and hospital are situated in Rangoon city.\n\nRangoon.\u2014The capital of the Province of British Burma, and administrative headquarters of Rangoon District, is situated in lat. 16\u00b0 46' 40\" N., and long. 96\u00b0 13' 15\" E., on the left bank of the Hlaing river, at its junction with the Pegu and P\u00fa-zwon-doung streams, 21 miles from the sea. According to Talaing tradition, the first village on the site of the modern Rangoon was founded about 585 B.C. by two brothers, P\u00fa and Ta-paw, who had received some of Gautama's hairs from Buddha himself, and, acting on his instructions, enshrined them in the famous Shwe-Dagon pagoda. P\u00fan-na-ri-ka, who reigned in Pegu from 746 to 761 A.D., is said to have re-founded the town, and called it Aramana. Afterwards, it regained its name of Dagon. The Talaing records relate how it was occupied by the Burmese in 1413; how Bya-gnya-keng, the son of Raza-dhie-rit, was appointed its governor; and how Sheng-tsaw-b\u00fa, his sister, in whose memory a national festival is celebrated every year, built herself a palace here in 1460. The town gradually sank into a collection of huts. Dala, now an unimportant suburb on the right bank of the Hlaing, and Syriam, on the opposite side of the Pegu river, are repeatedly noticed; but of Dagon little or nothing is said. Gaspar Balbi, who came to Pegu in 1579-80, thus wrote of Dagon: 'After we were landed, we began to goe on the right hand in a large street about 50 paces broad, in which we saw wooden houses gilded and adorned with delicate gardens after their custom, wherein their Talapoins, which are their Friers, dwell and look to the Pagod or Varella of Dogon. The left side is furnished with portals and shops, . . . and by this street they go the Varella for a good mile straight forward, either under paint houses or in the open street, which is free to walk in.' The English, Portuguese, Dutch, and French, had factories at Than-lyeng, better known as Syriam, on the other side of the river; and the officers in charge communicated with the Talaing court at Pegu through the governor of Dagon, who was eventually promoted to the highest rank in the kingdom, in order to suppress the quarrels between the European factors, each of whom strove to oust the rest for the benefit of his own\nnation. In the wars between the sovereigns of Burma and Pegu, Dagon frequently changed hands; and when, in 1763, Aloung-bh\u00fara, or Alompra, drove out the Talaing garrison of Ava (then the Burmese capital), and eventually conquered the Talaing dominions, he came down to Dagon, and repaired the great pagoda. Aloung-bh\u00fara for the most part rebuilt the town, gave it the name of Ran-k\u00fan (lit. 'the end of the war') or Rangoon, which it has ever since borne, and made it the seat of a viceroyalty. Rangoon, however, remained little more than a group of hovels, just above the level of low tides. Until 1790, it was the scene of incessant struggles between the Burmese and Peguans. In that year the place was captured by the latter, but the rising was speedily quelled by Meng-tara-gyi or Bho-daw Bh\u00fara, the Burmese monarch. The more general aspects of the native history of Rangoon have been dealt with under RANGOON District.\n\nAbout this period, the English obtained leave to establish a factory in Rangoon, and the British colours were hoisted over it. In 1794, differences arose in Arakan and Chittagong between the East India Company and the Burmese Government, and Colonel Symes was sent on an embassy to Ava, one of the results of his mission being the appointment of a British Resident at Rangoon in 1798. Symes thus described Rangoon as he saw it: 'It stretches along the bank of the river about a mile, and is not more than a third of a mile in breadth. The city or myo is a square, surrounded by a high stockade, and on the north side it is further strengthened by an indifferent fosse, across which a wooden bridge is thrown; in this face there are two gates, in each of the others only one. On the south side, towards the river, . . . there are a number of huts and three wharves, with cranes for landing goods. A battery of 12 cannon, six and nine pounders, raised on the bank, commands the river, but the guns and carriages are in such a wretched condition that they could do but little execution. . . . The streets of the town are narrow, and much inferior to those of Pegu, but clean and well paved; there are numerous channels to carry off the rain, over which strong planks are placed to prevent an interruption to intercourse. The houses are raised on posts from the ground. . . . All the officers of Government, the most opulent merchants, and persons of consideration live within the fort; shipwrights and people of inferior rank inhabit the suburbs. . . . Swine are suffered to roam about the town at large; . . . they are servants of the public, common scavengers. . . . The Burmese are also fond of dogs, numbers of which infest the streets.'\n\nDuring the first Anglo-Burmese war (1825), Rangoon was taken by the British and held till 1827; it was evacuated in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Yandab\u00fa (Yendaboo). In 1840, the appearance of Rangoon was described as suggestive of meanness and\npoverty, quite dispelling the interest excited by the narratives of travellers. In 1841, King K\u00fan-boung-meng, better known as Prince Tharawadi, ordered the town and stockade to be removed about a mile and a quarter inland to the site of Uk-ka-la-bha, and to be called by that name. The royal order was to a certain extent obeyed; the principal buildings and Government offices were placed in the new town, and were there when the British force landed at and captured Rangoon in April 1852, on the outbreak of the second Anglo-Burmese war. From this time, the place has remained in possession of the English. Within six months, steps were taken for laying out regular streets, for raising the general level, and for keeping out the river. The work of improvement has gone on steadily, and the Rangoon of to-day has practically been created since 1852. A raised strand road runs along the southern reach of the Hlaing, and the space between it and the old ditch is divided into square blocks by broad and regular streets.\n\nTo the north is the military cantonment, and within its limits stands the great Shwe-Dagon pagoda, the terraced hill from which it rises being now fortified. A little to the east of this edifice is the 'Great Royal Lake,' a fine sheet of water, with a carriage-road all round. The Rangoon and Irawadi State Railway has a station in the centre of the city, which is divided into 11 quarters. The main portion, or Rangoon Proper, contains the public buildings, the principal of which are the law courts, town hall, telegraph office, Bank of Bengal, Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, custom-house, etc. The point of junction of the P\u00fa-zwon-doung and Hlaing rivers in the east, known as Monkey Point, is crowned by a battery; along the bank of the former stream are the chief rice-husking steam mills, and on the Hlaing are numerous saw-mills. The other buildings of note in Rangoon are\u2014the lunatic asylum; the jail, which is the main central prison for the Province, and contained 1835 prisoners in 1877; the hospital and charitable dispensary, east of the Agri-Horticultural Society's Gardens, with the Phayre Museum; the high school; St. John's College; the Diocesan school; the Theological College for Karengs, etc. In 1878, the garrison consisted of two batteries of artillery, one battalion of European and one of Native infantry, with a detail of Sappers, all belonging to the Madras army. The judicial work of the town is entrusted to a Recorder and subordinate magistrates. In certain cases, such as confirming sentences of death, the Recorder and the Judicial Commissioner of the Province, who otherwise has no jurisdiction in Rangoon, sit together as the 'special court.' The police in 1877 numbered 244 officers and men. The revenue of Rangoon, which is a municipality, was, in 1877-78, \u00a373,582. The municipal committee have erected fine markets, supplied the town with good water from the 'Royal Lakes,' and lighted the streets with\nkerosene lamps. The strand bank, with its wharves and moorings, is under the management of a special body.\n\nIn 1795, the population of Rangoon was estimated at 25,000; in 1812, at 8250. In 1852, the number of inhabitants was returned at about the same as in 1795. Long previous to 1795, Rangoon was the asylum of insolvent debtors and of foreigners of desperate fortunes, and apart from these, was inhabited by persons of almost every nationality. The Census of 1872 returned the population at 89,897, inclusive of the shipping and travellers. Burmese numbered 56,918; Hindus, 15,261; Talaings, 7451; Europeans and Eurasians (including Americans and Australians), 4016; Chinese, 3181; Shans, 1217; Karengs, 525; and 'others,' 1328, including Muhammadans of different nationalities, Armenians, Arakanese, Kathays, Malays, Jews, Parsis, and Siamese. In 1878, the population was estimated to have increased to 110,700, dwelling in 13,389 houses.\n\nTrade.\u2014When Arakan and Tenasserim were ceded to the English after the first war, the commerce of Pegu found an outlet at Maulmain, and rapidly raised that town to a large commercial port. But when Pegu was annexed in 1853, trade began to advance with gigantic strides. Not only was the whole customs system changed, and numerous restrictions removed, but the country in the interior was gradually developed. Rangoon now ranks as the fourth, if not the third, port in India. In early days, the largest business was done with Calcutta, owing to the great demand in that market for teak, and the facility with which the Burmese were thence supplied with British and Indian piece-goods. No direct trade existed between Burma or Pegu and any European country. The nature of the land on the banks of the river, the accessibility of the town from the sea, the great rise and fall of the tide, the low rates of wages, and, as it seemed, the inexhaustible supply of teak timber gave Rangoon great advantages for shipbuilding. The European principles of construction appear to have come from the French. No information regarding vessels constructed before 1786 is available, but in that year two vessels, one of 680 tons, were launched. For some time before the commencement of hostilities this industry was checked, and when war actually broke out it ceased entirely, but was resumed soon after the signing of the treaty of Yandab\u00fa (1826), until war was again declared in 1852. During this interval 24 vessels, with a total tonnage of 5625, were built. The total number of vessels that cleared out annually from Rangoon to all ports for many years prior to 1811 was from 18 to 25; from 1811 to 1817, 36; from 1817 to 1822, 46; and from 1822 to 1825, 56. In 1822, it was calculated that the maximum tonnage likely to find employment between Calcutta and Rangoon was 5400. In the three years 1820-21 to 1822-23, 22 vessels, aggregating 9404\ntons, entered the port of Calcutta from Rangoon, and 5 vessels, aggregating 630 tons, the port of Madras. Under Burmese rule, the port charges were always high; and up to 1813 the dues and presents for the principal officials claimed from all masters, without distinction, amounted to \u00a3126. The cost of clearing was about \u00a3175. In 1813, certain changes were effected; in 1820, the demands for a ship of 420 tons amounted to \u00a3196. A new ship built in the river was exempt from charges on her first voyage. Commanders on landing had to go first to the custom-house to be searched, then to the port officer, after this to the place for delivery of the manifest of all cargo, fire-arms, ammunition, etc., then to the governor, and lastly to the Re-won. Up to a few years before 1824-25, all square-rigged vessels were obliged to unship their rudders and land their guns, etc.; ultimately, they were relieved from this humiliation on paying a sum of \u00a34 to the local authorities. At this period, the duty charged on all imports was 12 per cent.; on all exports (except timber), 5 per cent.; and on timber, 1 per cent. Ships' stores paid half-duty. The exportation of rice and precious metals was strictly prohibited, and it was only by adroit smuggling that the latter were carried away. In 1805, exclusive of treasure, the imports were valued at \u00a324,523; the exports, at \u00a365,360.\n\nIn 1821, the total value of the imports, also exclusive of treasure, into Rangoon was \u00a39544; of the exports, \u00a319,744. The chief imports from Calcutta were piece-goods, raw silk, cotton, indigo, saltpetre, sugar, rice, pepper, and opium. From 1826 to 1852, the average annual number of arrivals and departures was \u2014 English vessels from 100 to 1000 tons, 20; Chulia vessels (or those owned and navigated by natives) from 200 to 600 tons, 25; coasting schooners bound westward, 60; Chinese junks and small boats, 20; total, 125. A royal present of one piece of cambric, one piece of Palampur, and a Pulicat handkerchief was made by the master of each ship arriving. The port charges had been reduced, and varied, according to the tonnage of the ship, from \u00a31 to \u00a350. These went into the coffers of the local government, while the anchorage dues were assigned to one of the queens. The amount remitted annually to the capital on account of custom dues was about \u00a321,000.\n\nAfter British annexation, in 1858-59, the imports amounted to \u00a31,274,374, and the exports, \u00a3856,681; total, \u00a32,131,055. By 1868-69, the value of imports had risen to \u00a32,346,460, and of exports to \u00a31,954,055; total, \u00a34,300,515. In 1877-78, the imports rose still further to \u00a33,777,724, and the exports to \u00a34,414,301; total, \u00a38,192,025. In this year, the chief imports were cotton twist, yarn, and piece-goods, jute manufactures, provisions, silk goods, spices, tobacco, coals, machinery, metals, apparel, salt, seeds, and woollen goods. The principal exports were rice, timber, raw cotton, hides and\nhorns, gums and resins, mineral oil, stone (jade), lac, ivory, precious stones, and drugs. In 1877-78, the total value of customs duties levied on exports and imports was \u00a3291,773; the gross tonnage of vessels entering the port was 559,051; of vessels clearing out, 540,904; total, 1,099,955 tons.\n\nThe price of unhulled rice or paddy in the Rangoon market in 1819 was about R. 1, or 2s., for 10 baskets (bushels). In 1855-56, it was three times, and that of husked rice twice, what it was just before the annexation. Since 1855-56, the increase in the supply, great as it has been, has not kept pace with the demand, and prices have again doubled. The rice season commences about January and ends in May. The prices of rice in the husk at the mills in Rangoon in 1878 were, per 100 baskets\u2014in January, Rs. 93, or \u00a39, 6s.; in April, Rs. 130, or \u00a313; in July, Rs. 124, or \u00a312, 8s.; and in October, Rs. 125, or \u00a312, 10s. Each firm has one or more brokers and several buyers, the former as a rule residing on the mill premises. At the beginning of the season, the firm advances money to the buyer, and takes a mortgage on his boat, the broker also standing as security. The buyer then purchases grain in the country as cheaply as he can, and sells it to the millowner at current rates, receiving cash payment. Towards the end of the season, the advances are gradually called in by the 'short payment' system\u2014that is, the buyer is paid for a portion only of his cargo, the rest being taken as against the advance. Many of the cultivators, however, bring down the grain themselves, and sell it to brokers in the Pegu and Rangoon rivers, and the cargoes are delivered at the mills on the banks of the P\u00fa-zwon-doung. The brokers are paid by a percentage on every basket. The rice is measured at the wharves, and then taken to the mills, where it is winnowed, carried to the top stores, passed between two stones which revolve at a distance just sufficient to grind off the outer husk. It is then re-winnowed (a blast carrying away the loosened husk) and shot into bags\u2014all by steam machinery. Perfectly cleaned rice will not stand the long voyage to England, and the grain as exported has still on it an inner pellicle, and is mixed with about 20 per cent. of unhulled rice, known technically as 'cargo rice.' Since the opening of the Suez Canal, the quantity of cleaned rice exported to England has increased considerably. As competition is keen, and as each firm has only a limited extent of the river bank on which to discharge, a practice has sprung up of taking delivery in cargo boats in the Pegu river. This has led to the employment of steam launches for towing purposes; and, probably, before long small light-draught steamers will be used to go up the Pegu and meet the rice boats coming down.\n\nRangoon River.\u2014The name usually given to the lower portion of the Hlaing River (q.v.), Pegu, British Burma.\nRangpur.\u2014A British District, occupying the central portion of the R\u00e1jsh\u00e1hi and Kuch Behar Division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. It lies between $25^\\circ 2' 50''$ and $26^\\circ 18' 45''$ N. lat., and between $88^\\circ 47'$ and $89^\\circ 55' 30''$ E. long. Bounded on the north by Jalp\u00e1iguri District and Kuch Behar State; on the east by the Brahmaputra, separating it from Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra and Maimansinh; on the south by Bogra; and on the west by Din\u00e1jpur and Jalp\u00e1iguri. Area, 3476 square miles; population (according to the Census of 1872), 2,149,972. The administrative headquarters are at RANGPUR TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is one vast plain, without natural elevations of any kind. The rivers dominate over the topography of the country. Towards the east, the wide valley of the Brahmaputra is annually laid under water during the rainy season; and the remainder of the District is traversed by a network of streams, which frequently break through their sandy banks, and plough for themselves new channels over the fields. These river changes have left their traces in the numerous stagnant pools or marshes which dot the whole face of the country, but do not spread into wide expanses as in the lower delta. Under such circumstances, agricultural industry has taken full advantage of the natural fertility of the soil, which is composed of a sandy loam. Three-fourths of the total area are under continuous cultivation, the staple crops being rice, jute, oil-seeds and tobacco; and even the patches of waste land yield a valuable tribute of reeds and cane.\n\nThe river system is constituted by the BRAHMAPUTRA and its tributaries. The Brahmaputra itself only skirts the eastern frontier; but its mighty stream exercises a great influence over the District, by the fertilizing effect of its inundations, and also by its diluviating action. The chief tributaries are the T\u00edsta, Dharla, Sankos, and Dudhkumar, of which the T\u00edsta is by far the most important. This river, indeed, owing to the extreme variations which have occurred in its course, has more than once modified the entire hydrography of Northern Bengal. At the time of Major Rennell\u2019s Survey in the third quarter of the last century, the T\u00edsta flowed due south and finally fell into the Ganges by what is now the channel of the Atral. But in 1787, a season of excessive rainfall caused the river to break away in a south-easterly direction, and discharge itself into the Brahmaputra. Old channels and offshoots of the T\u00edsta abound throughout the District, the largest of which are known as the Kar\u00e1ttoy\u00e1, Gh\u00e1gh\u00e1t, Man\u00e1s, and Guj\u00e1ri\u00e1. These all afford valuable water communications during the rainy season. There are no embankments or artificial canals in the District, nor does the alluvial soil supply any mineral products.\n\nHistory.\u2014In the earliest days of which tradition preserves any record, Rangpur formed the western outpost of the ancient Hindu kingdom of K\u00e1mr\u00fap. The capital was situated far away in the Assam\nvalley; but the great R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhagadatt\u00e1, whose defeat is recorded in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, had a country residence at Rangpur, locally interpreted to mean 'the abode of pleasure.' Apart from these legends, which are the common property of Hinduism, genuine local traditions have preserved the names of three dynasties that ruled over this tract of country prior to the 15th century A.D. The earliest of these is associated with Prithu R\u00e1j\u00e1, the extensive ruins of whose capital are still pointed out in the present District of Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed. Next came a dynasty of four kings, whose family name of P\u00e1l recurs in other parts of Bengal and also in Assam. The founder, Dharm\u00e1 P\u00e1l, has left the remains of a fortified city, which also lie within the limits of Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhav\u00e1 Chandra, the third of this P\u00e1l dynasty, and his minister, are the heroes of the Hindu nursery version of the wise men of Gotham, and are renowned far and wide throughout Bengal. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his minister were bereft of common sense by the curse of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's favourite goddess, whom he offended by visiting her temple at a forbidden time. They did nothing like other people\u2014slept by day, and kept awake throughout the night. The minister took up his abode in a box, and only emerged from his retreat when called upon by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to deliberate with him on some hard matter. One or two of these judgments may be noted. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his minister, in the plenitude of their wisdom, sentenced the potters to compensate the merchants for loss by wreck, on the ground that the high mounds raised by the former brought the clouds which had caused the storm. On another occasion, the people brought a fine wild hog to them, that they might decide what strange animal it was; and, after deep cogitation on the knotty point, they concluded that it must either be an overgrown rat or an elephant gone into a consumption. But their last judgment gives the climax to their fame. Two travellers were discovered one afternoon digging a cooking-place in the ground by the side of a tank, for the preparation of their evening meal. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, who discovered them, at once concluded that the men were engaged in effecting a burglarious entry in order to steal the tank, and he sentenced them to be impaled as robbers. The poor travellers, driven to desperation, made each of them seemingly frantic endeavours to be impaled on the taller of the two poles; and when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 inquired the reason of their extraordinary rivalry, they informed him that they had learned, by the power of their enchantments, that whoever was impaled on the taller pole would in the next birth become the sovereign of the whole world, while the other would be his minister. Bhav\u00e1 Chandra, thinking that it would be far from consistent with justice that such low people should acquire supreme dignity, forthwith had himself impaled on the coveted pole, and his faithful minister followed his master, and expired on the shorter one. Bhav\u00e1 Chandra's successor, P\u00e1la, was the last of the line.\n\nVOL. VIII.\nThe third dynasty had three kings, Nil\u00e1dw\u00e1j, Chakradw\u00e1j, and Nfl\u00e1mdbh\u00e1r. The first of these founded Kam\u00e1t\u00e1pur, the ruins of which, situated in Kuch Behar territory, are 19 miles in circumference. All these successive capitals were built upon the same principle\u2014enclosure within enclosure, the royal palace occupying the centre of the whole. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Nfl\u00e1mdbh\u00e1r is said to have been a very great monarch; but unfortunately he was brought into collision with the Afgh\u00e1n king of Gaur, who captured his capital by stratagem, and carried him away prisoner in an iron cage. This Afgh\u00e1n conqueror is identified with Hus\u00e1i\u00edn Sh\u00e1h, who reigned from 1499 to 1520. But the Muhammadans did not retain their hold upon the country. A period of anarchy ensued; and among the wild tribes from the hills of Assam that overran Rangpur, the Koch came to the front and founded the dynasty which still exists at Kuch Behar. The first R\u00e1j\u00e1, Visu, was a conqueror who extended his arms eastwards up the Assam valley, and southwards over Rangpur. On his death, however, the kingdom was divided; and as soon as the Mughal Emperors had established their supremacy in Bengal, their viceroys began to push their north-eastern frontier across the Brahmaputra. By 1603, the Muhammadans were firmly established at R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra, which continued to form their outpost against the incursions of the Ahams. Rangpur proper was not annexed till 1687 by the generals of Aurangzeb. In the extreme north, the Kuch Behar R\u00e1j\u00e1s were able to offer such a resolute resistance, that in 1711 they obtained a favourable compromise, in accordance with which they paid tribute as zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs for the parg\u00e1ns of Bod\u00e1, P\u00e1tgr\u00e1m, and Purubbh\u00e1g, but retained their independence in Kuch Behar proper.\n\nThis was the condition of things when the East India Company received possession of the diw\u00e1n\u00ed of Bengal in 1765. At first, the British continued the Muhamadan practice of farming out the land revenue to contractors. But in 1783, the exactions of a notorious farmer, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Deb\u00ed Sinh of Din\u00e1jpur, drove the Rangpur cultivators into open rebellion; and the Government was induced to invite the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs to enter into direct engagements for the revenue. In 1772, the banditti, increased by disbanded troops from the native armies, and by peasants ruined in the famine of 1770, were plundering and burning villages \u2018in bodies of 50,000 men.\u2019 Rangpur was then a frontier District, bordering on Nep\u00e1l, Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, Kuch Behar, and Assam. The enormous area of the jurisdiction, and the weakness of the administrative staff, prevented the Collector from preserving order in the remote corners of his District, which thus became the secure refuges of banditti. The early records of Rangpur and neighbouring parts of Bengal are full of complaints on this head, and of encounters between detachments of sepoys and armed bands of dak\u00e1its and saniyds\u00eds. A\nsmall British force sent against them received a check; in 1773, Captain Thomas, the leader of another party, was cut off, and four battalions had to be employed. In the year 1789, the Collector conducted a regular campaign against these disturbers of the peace. They had fled to the great forest of Baikunthpur, within which he blockaded them with a force of 200 barkandass. At last they were compelled to surrender; and within a single year no less than 549 robbers were brought to trial.\n\nIn recent times, Rangpur has had no history, beyond the mere recital of administrative changes. The entire tract east of the Brahmaputra has been formed into the independent District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra, and annexed to the Province of Assam. The three northern pargands now constitute part of the new District of Jalp\u00e1gur; and a considerable portion in the south has been transferred to Bogr\u00e1, over the whole of which District the Judge of Rangpur continues to exercise civil jurisdiction. Of the area of the present District, about 300 square miles, which pay revenue into the Rangpur treasury, are under the criminal supervision of the Magistrate of Maimansinh.\n\nPeople.\u2014In the beginning of the present century, Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, in the course of his statistical inquiries, arrived at a most elaborate estimate for the population of Rangpur. Making allowance for the reduced area of the District, his calculations show 1,268,000 Muhammadans, and 816,000 Hindus; total, 2,084,000 souls. These figures, both in the aggregate and in their classification, approximate marvellously to the results of the late Census; but it seems incredible that the population should have remained stationary during the long intervening period of prosperity. The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 2,149,972 persons, residing in 4206 mauz\u00e1s or villages and in 331,079 houses. The area was taken at 3476 square miles, which gives the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 619; villages per square mile, 1\u00b721; houses per square mile, 95. The average number of persons per village was 511; of persons per house, 6\u00b75. Classified according to sex, there were 1,095,1026 males and 1,054,946 females; proportion of males, 50\u00b783 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 391,424, and females, 304,506; total, 695,930, or 32\u00b74 per cent of the total population. The occupation returns are not trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that the total number of male adults connected with agriculture is given as 548,997, as against 154,605 male adult non-agriculturists. The ethnical division of the people includes\u201428 Europeans; 12 Eurasians; 1 Armenian, and 1 Nep\u00e1l\u00ed; 1109 aborigines; 492,149 semi-aboriginal tribes; 339,983 Hindus, subdivided according to caste; 25,171 persons of Hindu origin not recognising caste; 1,291,465 Muhammadans. There can be no doubt that in Rangpur, as in the rest of Eastern Bengal, the great bulk\nof the people are of aboriginal descent; and that the majority became willing converts to the conquering faith of Isl\u00e1m, in preference to remaining out-castes beyond the pale of exclusive Hinduism. This latter fact is attested by local tradition. The only circumstance that might excite surprise, is that the Musalm\u00e1ns should have exercised so great a proselytizing influence during the brief hundred years of their rule in Rangpur. The tribes now ranked as aboriginal are very poorly represented; the most numerous being the Telang\u00e1, a wandering race of gipsies, who number only 671. The semi-Hinduized aborigines of the Census Report, who are considerably more numerous than the Hindus proper, mainly consist of the cognate tribes of Koch, Pali, and R\u00e1jbansi, whose home is in the adjoining State of Kuch Behar, and who are known to be still more largely represented in the general Muhammadan population. These three tribes number collectively 407,658 persons. Next come the Chand\u00e1ls (36,148) and the Khyens (20,013). Among Hindus proper, the Br\u00e1hmans number 10,623, mostly belonging to the two clans called Mithila and K\u00e1mr\u00fap\u00ed Vaidik, whose settlement in Rangpur is known to have taken place in historic times. The R\u00e1jputs number only 2404; the K\u00e1yasths 10,387, including apparently many Kol\u00edt\u00e1s from Assam. By far the most numerous caste is that of the Tiors (fishermen), 141,213; next come the Kaibarttas, 35,396. Emigration from the District is unknown. Classified according to religion, the population is composed of\u2014Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes), 857,298, or 39'9 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1ns, 1,291,465, or 60 per cent. The remainder is made up of 73 Christians, including 32 native converts; 61 Buddhists, and 1075 \u2018others.\u2019 Among the Hindus are included a few members of the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j, who are to be found at Rangpur town and K\u00e1nkina; and a yet smaller number of Jain merchants from the north-west, who have also settled in the civil station. The Vaishnavs are returned at 24,451; the Tantr\u00e1-n\u00e1ths, 420; the Saniy\u00e1s\u00eds, 268. The Muhammadans almost entirely belong to the cultivating class, and engage little in trade. Of recent years, the reforming Far\u00e1iz\u00ed spirit has manifested itself chiefly among the higher classes; but the Far\u00e1iz\u00eds, or Sh\u00e1r\u00e1s, as they are here called, do not display any active intolerance.\n\nThe entire population is absolutely rural. The only town returned in the Census Report as containing more than 5000 inhabitants is Rangpur itself, with 14,845; but the municipality of Rangpur includes three agricultural villages. The people display no tendency towards urban life, but rather the reverse. Out of a total of 4206 villages, as many as 3085 each contain fewer than 500 inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Rice constitutes the staple crop throughout the District. Of the total food supply, the \u00e1man or winter crop, grown on low lands and usually transplanted, affords from 70 to 85 per cent.; the\nRANGPUR DISTRICT.\n\nremainder is furnished by the dus or autumn crop, which is generally grown on high lands. Elaborate agricultural statistics have recently been collected in Rangpur, through the agency of a native Deputy Collector. Out of a total area of 2,360,294 acres, he estimates that 1,737,950 acres, or 73 per cent., are actually under cultivation. Rice occupies 1,263,000 acres; fibres, 117,000; oil-seeds, 68,000; tobacco, 66,000; wheat, 31,000; inferior food grains, 44,000; vegetables, 15,000; indigo and sugar-cane, 11,000 acres each. Less than one-eighth of the total area is capable of producing two crops in the year. The staples grown for export are rice, jute, tobacco, and oil-seeds. Indigo cultivation is no longer conducted under European supervision, but native planters have taken over the deserted factories. Among miscellaneous crops may be mentioned pan or betel leaf, supari or betel-nut, and mulberry for silk-worms. Jute is grown in all parts of the District, but thrives best on the banks and islands of the larger rivers; the annual out-turn is more than 700,000 cwts. Tobacco is principally cultivated in the high-lying northern tracts; the leaf is bought up by Maghs from Chittagong, for the purpose of being manufactured in Burma. Manure, in the form of cow-dung or oil-cake, is applied only to the more valuable crops. It is also a common practice to burn stubble or jungle on the fields in order to renovate the soil. Land is occasionally permitted to lie fallow; and it is known that certain crops cannot be raised in two successive years. Artificial irrigation is nowhere required. Spare land, capable of cultivation, can hardly be said to exist. The average produce of an acre of good rice lands renting at 9s., is 15 cwts., valued at \u00a31, 4s. Land yielding two crops, and renting at 18s., may produce as much as 9 cwts. of dus rice, together with a second crop of pulses, oil-seeds, or tobacco, the whole valued at from \u00a32, 10s. to \u00a36. The Deputy Collector above referred to has estimated the total annual out-turn of all the crops in Rangpur District as worth \u00a34,000,000 sterling. The rate of rent paid for rice land varies from 1s. 4d. to 11s. an acre; land suited for tobacco or sugar-cane pays from 11s. to 14s.; and pan gardens as much as \u00a32 or \u00a33 an acre. There is little that is peculiar in the land tenures of the District, except the large degree to which the superior landlords have parted with their rights in favour of intermediate tenure-holders. Among such intermediate tenures may be mentioned the upanchaki, which was originally granted for charitable or religious purposes at a quit-rent, and the mazkuri. It is also noteworthy that the term jotdar, in this part of the country, is applied to a substantial middle-man, who holds for a term, but does not cultivate with his own hands. Very few of the actual cultivators have won for themselves rights of occupancy by a continuous holding of over twelve years; the majority are mere tenants-at-will.\n\nOrdinary rates of wages have approximately doubled within the\npast ten years. In 1871, an agricultural day-labourer received about 3d. a day; blacksmiths and carpenters, about 16s. a month. The prices of food grains do not seem to have risen in equal proportion. Common rice fetched 1s. 6d. per cwt. in 1786; 4s. in 1860; 5s. 5d. in 1870; and 4s. 2\u00bdd. in 1872. The highest price reached in 1866, the year of the Orissa famine, was 12s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nRangpur is not specially liable to either of the calamities of flood or drought. It is common for the crops in certain tracts to be injured by the overflow of the rivers; but on only one occasion in history, in 1787-88, has the inundation been so excessive as to affect the general harvest of the District. In that memorable year, when the river Tista was borne in a torrent across the arable fields, one-sixth of the population are estimated to have perished from want, disease, or drowning. In 1873, the insufficiency of local rainfall was such as to demand the institution of relief operations by Government. The completion of the railway has now saved the District from any danger of isolation. If the price of rice were to rise in January as high as 13s. 6d. per cwt., that should be regarded as a sign of approaching distress.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014There are few special industries in Rangpur. Paper is manufactured from jute in certain villages. Other products are\u2014satr\u00e1njis or striped cotton carpets; silk cloth woven from the cocoon of a worm fed on the castor-oil plant; baskets and mats; brass-ware; ornaments carved in ivory and buffalo horn. Silk culture is confined to the south of the District, whence about 300 cwts. of cocoons and 50 cwts. of raw silk are annually exported.\n\nRiver traffic is brisk in all parts of the District. Agricultural produce is brought from the interior and stored in warehouses on the river banks until the rising of the streams in the rainy season. The chief exports are rice, jute, and tobacco; the imports are cotton cloth, salt, hardware, and miscellaneous goods. From the north are received timber, ponies, blankets, and gh\u00ee. The centres of trade are\u2014Mah\u00edganj, a suburb of the civil station; Gor\u00e1m\u00e1ra and K\u00e1nkina on the Tista; Nisbetganj on the Gh\u00e1g\u00e1t; and K\u00e1l\u00edganj, a stopping-place for steamers on the Brahmaputra. The registration returns of river traffic for 1876-77 show a total export from the District valued at \u00a3932,442, against imports valued at \u00a3480,046. It is probable that other imports pass by road unregistered, but there remains a considerable balance of trade in favour of the District. The chief exports were\u2014jute, 1,155,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3346,560 (placing Rangpur second to Maimansinh in the list of jute-producing Districts); tobacco, 557,400 maunds, valued at \u00a3278,700; rice, 145,900 maunds, and paddy, 45,000 maunds, valued together at \u00a337,392; hides, 93,000 in number, valued at \u00a318,591. The imports comprised\u2014European piece-goods, \u00a3162,970 (almost entirely received by steamer at K\u00e1l\u00edganj); salt, 190,500 maunds, valued\nat \u00a399,750; raw cotton, 58,400 maunds, valued at \u00a387,600 (chiefly received at Chilm\u00e1ri from Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District and the Garo Hills). The chief centre of registered trade was Gor\u00e1m\u00e1ra, where the exports were valued at \u00a3163,932, chiefly jute (246,000 maunds) and tobacco (148,500 maunds); the imports were valued at \u00a344,113, chiefly salt (54,900 maunds). Next in order came K\u00e1l\u00eddaha, with an export of 151,100 maunds of tobacco, and J\u00e1tr\u00e1pur with 123,000 maunds of jute.\n\nThe Northern Bengal State Railway, which has lately been opened, cuts through the western half of the District from south to north; and it is intended ultimately to construct a short branch to Rangpur town. In 1871, the total length of the District roads was returned at 240 miles, maintained at a cost of \u00a31550; but many new roads and bridges have been constructed since that date. In the same year, there were 118 ferries, at which \u00a32193 was collected in tolls.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1875-76, the gross revenue of Rangpur District was returned at \u00a3144,159, towards which the land tax contributed \u00a3100,008, or 70 per cent.; the total cost of officials and police of all kinds amounted to \u00a324,994, or little more than one-sixth of the revenue. At the time of the Permanent Settlement, when the area of the District was considerably larger than at present, the land revenue was fixed at \u00a383,866. In 1870, there were 3 covenanted civil servants stationed in the District, and 5 magisterial and 14 civil and revenue courts open. For police purposes, Rangpur is divided into 16 th\u00e1nds or police circles. In 1872, the regular police force numbered 415 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a37771. In addition there was a municipal police of 59 men, and a rural police or village watch of 5268 men. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 5742 officers and men, giving 1 policeman to every 0'60 square mile of the area or to every 374 persons in the population. The estimated total cost was \u00a316,774, averaging \u00a34, 16s. 6d. per square mile and 1\u00bdd. per head of the population. In the same year, the total number of persons in Rangpur District convicted of any offence, great or small, was 1442, being 1 person to every 1490 of the population. By far the greater proportion of the convictions were for petty offences. The District contains one jail at Rangpur town, and one Subdivisional lock-up. In 1872, the average daily number of prisoners was 256, of whom only 1 was a female; the labouring convicts averaged 214. These figures show 1 person in jail to every 8382 of the population. The total cost amounted to \u00a31256, or \u00a34, 18s. per prisoner; there was no money profit realized from the jail manufactures. The death-rate was 35'9 per thousand, against 53'4 for Bengal generally; but, as a rule, the mortality in the Rangpur jail is deplorably high. In 1874, it rose to 176'8 per thousand.\n\nEducation has widely spread of recent years, owing to the changes\nby which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules has been extended, first to\nthe vernacular middle-class schools, and finally to the village schools or\np\u0101ths\u0101l\u0101s. In 1856, there were only 21 schools in the District, attended\nby 971 pupils. In 1870, these numbers had risen to 230 schools, and\n5361 pupils; and by 1875, the schools had still further increased to\n525, and the pupils to 11,090, showing 1 school for every 6\u00b76 square\nmiles, and 5 pupils for every thousand of the population. In 1872, the\ntotal expenditure on education was \u00a35265, towards which Government\ncontributed \u00a33255. There were 3 higher-class English schools in the\nDistrict, with a total of 260 pupils. The Normal school at Rangpur\ntown was attended by 62 pupils.\n\nThe District is divided into 4 administrative Subdivisions and 16\npolice circles. There are 61 parganas or Fiscal Divisions, with an\naggregate of 563 revenue-paying estates. In 1876, there were 12 civil\njudges and 10 stipendiary magistrates; the maximum distance of any\nvillage from the nearest court was 25 miles, the average distance 10 miles.\nRangpur town, with a population of 14,845 souls, is the only munici-\npality in the District. According to the Census Report of 1872, the\ngross municipal income was \u00a3644, the average rate of taxation being\n10\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Rangpur does not differ materially\nfrom that common to all Lower Bengal. Diseases of a malarious origin\nare prevalent in the rainy season and winter, but during the re-\nmainder of the year the atmosphere is clear and dry. The average\nannual rainfall is 88\u00b745 inches. In 1870, the mean annual temperature\nwas returned at 81\u00b75\u00b0 F.\n\nThe endemic diseases include fever, cholera, and elephantiasis. The\ntwo former sometimes exhibit epidemic outbreaks of great severity.\nThe fevers are lingering, being usually attended with spleen and liver\ncomplications. In the two years 1871 and 1872, the total number of\ndeaths from cholera reported to the police was 2767; and there was\nonly one month in the twenty-four entirely free. The vital statistics for\nselected areas show a death-rate, during 1875, of 40\u00b710 per thousand in\nthe rural area, and 39\u00b733 in the urban area, which is conterminous\nwith the municipality of Rangpur. There were, in 1872, six charitable\ndispensaries in the District, at which 199 in-door and 18,459 out-door\npatients were treated during the year; the total expenditure was \u00a3745,\ntowards which Government contributed \u00a3235.\n\nRangpur.\u2014Sadr or headquarters Subdivision of Rangpur District,\nBengal; situated between 25\u00b0 18' and 26\u00b0 18' 45\" N. lat., and between\n88\u00b0 47' and 89\u00b0 33' 45\" E. long. Area, 2687 square miles; villages,\n2970; houses, 256,527. Pop. (1872), 1,718,226, of whom 994,320, or\n57\u00b78 per cent., are Muhammadans; 723,076, or 42\u00b71 per cent., Hindus;\n50 Buddhists; 71 Christians; 709 'others.' Proportion of males in\ntotal population, 50\u00b79 per cent.; average density of population, 639 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 1\u00b71; persons per village, 579; houses per square mile, 95; persons per house, 6\u00b77. This Subdivision comprises the 12 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Mah\u00edganj, Nisbetganj, Darw\u00e1ni, Jaldh\u00e1k\u00e1, Diml\u00e1, Phuranb\u00e1ri, Barab\u00e1ri, N\u00e1g\u00e9swar\u00ed, Al\u00edpur, Kum\u00e1rganj, Mal\u00e1ng\u00e1, and P\u00edrganj. In 1870-71, it contained 12 magisterial and revenue courts, a regular police force of 337 men, and a rural constabulary of 4326 men.\n\n**Rangpur.**\u2014Administrative headquarters and principal civil station of Rangpur District, Bengal; situated on the north bank of the Ghagh\u00e1t river, in lat. 25\u00b0 44' 55\" N., and long. 89\u00b0 17' 40\" E. Pop. (1872), 14,845, viz. 8060 Muhammadans, 6663 Hindus, 52 Christians, and 50 'others.' Rangpur is a municipality, and consists, besides the civil station, of the hamlets of Mah\u00edganj, Dh\u00e1p, and Naw\u00e1bganj. Municipal revenue (1876), \u00a31009; rate of taxation, 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of population. The town contains the District jail and a dispensary. The name of Rangpur\u2014'the abode of bliss'\u2014is said to be derived from the legend that R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhagadatt\u00e1, who took part in the war of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, possessed a country residence here. Rangpur was captured by the Afgh\u00e1n king, Hus\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, who ruled at Gaur from 1497 to 1521 A.D.\u2014See RANGPUR DISTRICT.\n\n**Rangpur.**\u2014Ruins in S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam, immediately south of S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r town, marking the site of the residence of the Aham kings during the 17th century. The palace and the neighbouring temple of J\u00e1is\u00e1g\u00e1r are both said to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rudra Sinh about 1698. They are now buried in deep jungle; and the walls remain firm, though the roof has fallen in. Before Rangpur, GARHGAON, in the immediate neighbourhood, was the Aham capital; and after 1784, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gaurin\u00e1th moved his residence from Rangpur to Jorh\u00e1t.\n\n**Rang\u00fan (Ran-k\u00fan).**\u2014District and town in British Burma.\u2014See RANGOON.\n\n**R\u00e1ma.**\u2014Town in S\u00edrsa District, Punjab.

Chiefly noted as the seat of a branch of the Bhatti family of Hiss\u00e1r. Little trade; manufacture of leather-work and coarse cloth. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3135, or 6\u00bdd. per head of population (4918) within municipal limits.\n\n**R\u00e1nibennur.**\u2014Chief town of the R\u00e1nibennur Subdivision of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay; situated on the high road from Poona to Madras, via Shol\u00e1pur and Hubli, about 80 miles south-east of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town, in lat. 14\u00b0 37' 10\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 40' 20\" E.

This Subdivision comprises the 3 police circles of R\u00e1n\u00edganj, K\u00e1ks\u00e1, and Ni\u00e1matpur. In 1870-71, it contained one court, a regular police force of 157, and a village police of 2524 men; the cost of Subdivisional administration was returned at \u00a35138, 14s.\n\nR\u00e1n\u00edganj.\u2014Municipal town and headquarters of R\u00e1n\u00edganj Subdivision, Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; situated on the north bank of the D\u00e1modar river, in lat. 23\u00b0 36' 30\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 8' 30\" E. Pop. (1872), 19,578 (inclusive of several small villages within municipal limits), viz. 17,927 Hindus, 1473 Muhammadans, 178 Christians. R\u00e1n\u00edganj itself contains only 6638 inhabitants. This town is the centre of the R\u00e1n\u00edganj coal industry; and its prosperity dates from the discovery and working of the mines, and also from the time when it was made a station on the East Indian Railway, 121 miles from Howrah. It is now one of the principal seats of the District trade. Municipal revenue (1876-77), \u00a3932; rate of taxation, 2s. 9d. per head of population. Dispensary.\n\nR\u00e1n\u00edganj.\u2014Coal-field in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 35' to 23\u00b0 45' N., long. 86\u00b0 40' to 87\u00b0 15' E.; area, about 500 square miles. Situated at a distance of from 120 to 160 miles north-west of Calcutta, and extending a few miles east of R\u00e1n\u00edganj town to several miles west of the Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r river; the greatest length from east to west being about 39 miles, and the greatest breadth from north to south, 18 miles. The greater portion of the coal-bearing strata is enclosed between the D\u00e1modar and the Ajai, the former river receiving the principal drainage. The surface is undulating, and the dense jungle which formerly covered it has now been cleared nearly throughout. The soil is generally clay, in some parts alluvial, but in others formed from the decomposition of rocks. South of Mangalpur, in the Sing\u00e1ran valley, are the mines of Harishpur and B\u00e1busol, where the seam is 25 feet thick, with 16 feet of excellent quality. The coal of the R\u00e1n\u00edganj field, like most Indian coals, is a non-coking bituminous coal,\ncomposed of distinct lamin\u00e6 of a bright jetty coal, and of a dull, earthy rock, with a large proportion of volatile matter and ash, the amount of the latter averaging about 15 per cent. (as against 24 per cent. in English coal), and ranging from 8 to 25 per cent. A sample of a very pure coal from the Si\u00e1rsol mine gave the following results:\u2014Volatile, 40 per cent.; fixed carbon, 57.5 per cent.; ash, 2.5 per cent. Mr. Blandford, in his report on the geological survey, 1858-60, states that in the R\u00e1niganj bed nine seams (perhaps eleven), with an aggregate thickness of 120 feet, are worked in the eastern portion; in the western, eleven, with an aggregate thickness of about 100 feet; and in the Lower D\u00e1modar section of the field, four seams, with an aggregate thickness of 69 feet. But more extensive underground explorations are necessary in order to fix the absolute thickness of the coal seams in this tract. The principal drawbacks to the extended employment of R\u00e1niganj coal in India, and the reasons why the expensive English coal is still generally employed, especially by sea-going steamers on long voyages, are the following:\u20141st. The non-coking property of R\u00e1niganj coal: 2nd. The small proportion of fixed carbon, upon which the value of coal for heating purposes depends: 3rd. The large proportion of ash; a larger quantity of R\u00e1niganj coal is therefore required to perform the same duty as good English coal: 4th. Its liability to spontaneous ignition, which is mainly due to the large quantity of iron pyrites in the coal; but this disadvantage may to a certain extent be avoided by shipping direct from the mine, without exposing the coal to any lengthened action of moisture. Dr. Oldham, in his report on 'The Coal Resources and Production of India' (1867), states that 'the very best coal of Indian fields only touches the average of English coal.' Practical results also attest the inferiority of the former. The two most heavily-worked lines of railway in India, viz. the East Indian (Bengal) and the Great Indian Peninsula (Bombay), use respectively Indian and English coal; and their relative consumption is 150 tons per mile in the former, as compared with 75 tons in the latter. The price of R\u00e1niganj coal varies from \u00a31, 2s. 3d. to \u00a31, 5s. 7d. a ton in Calcutta.\n\n'The R\u00e1niganj coal-field is the largest and most important of the areas in which coal is worked in India. Its proximity to the main line of railway, and also to the port of Calcutta, tends to give it pre-eminence over other less favourably situated localities. In the year 1774, coal was known to occur there, and so long ago as 1777 was actually worked. In 1830, several collieries of considerable extent had been opened out, and were, we have reason to believe, in a flourishing condition. The total area of coal-bearing rocks which is exposed is about 500 square miles; but it is possible that the real area may be even double that, since on the east the rocks dip under and are completely concealed by\nalluvium. Throughout this area a central zone includes the principal mines, and the chimneys which dot this tract constitute it the black country of India. At the present time (1879), there are about six principal European companies engaged in the extraction of coal, while many minor firms and native associations contribute to swell the total amount raised.\n\nFormerly a large proportion of the coal was obtained by open workings and quarries; but at the present day most of the seams which were accessible in this way have been exhausted, and regular mining is now carried on with more or less system. The miners are, however, individually, in some cases, allowed a degree of freedom, or rather licence, which would never be permitted in European mines. They chiefly belong to two races, the Bauris and the Santals; the former using the pick, while the latter cannot be induced to work with any other tool than a crowbar, with which they produce an altogether disproportionate amount of small coal and dust. The pillar and stall is generally practised in preference to the long wall system of \"getting\" the coal. None of the mines are of great depth; and a perfect freedom from fire and choke-damp renders it possible to carry on the work without its being necessary to adopt the precautions which in England only too often fail to secure the object aimed at. Many of the seams are of considerable thickness; one which is worked contains nearly 40 feet of coal. As a rule, however, the thick seams, especially those in the lower measures, do not contain the best coal. Compared with ordinary English coal, the R\u00e1niganj coals, and Indian coals generally, are very much inferior in working power; still they are capable of generating steam in both locomotive and other engines.'\n\nThe latest official return gives the average annual out-turn of 36 out of the 43 mines in the Bardw\u00e1n District (R\u00e1niganj coalfield), for the three years previous to 1878, at 475,587 tons; the out-put in 1878 being 523,008 tons. For 6 mines no returns were given, and no information was available.\n\nR\u00e1niganj.\u2014Small municipal town in Purniah District, Bengal; on the river Kaml\u00e1, in lat. 25\u00b0 51' 40\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 57' 55\" E., 16 miles due west of Basantpur. Pop. (1872), 1498; inclusive of hamlets within the municipal limits, 6144. Municipal income (1876-77), \u00a3106; average incidence of taxation, 4\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits; municipal police, 12 men, besides 13 maintained for the protection of the surrounding country. Seat of trade in rice, indigo, jute, tobacco, etc. R\u00e1niganj contains a primary school, attended by 50 boys.\n\nR\u00e1nigat (or 'Queen's Rock'), ancient fortress in Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab, identified with the Aornos of Alexander's historians. In 1848, General Cunningham suggested that the 'vast hill fortress of R\u00e1nigat,\nsituated immediately below the small village of Nogr\u00e1m, about 16 miles north by west of Nogr\u00e1m, corresponded in all essential particulars with the description of Aornos, as given by Arrian, Strabo, and Diodorus, excepting in its elevation, the height of R\u00e1n\u00edgat not being more than 1000 feet, which is, however, a very great elevation for so large a fortress.' In 1854, General James Abbott suggested the Mah\u00e1ban hill as the true identification; and in 1863, Mr. Loewenthal brought forward the claims of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Hod\u00ed's fort, opposite Attock, a site first suggested by General Court. After a full reconsideration of the whole case, General Cunningham has again urged the identification of R\u00e1n\u00edgat with Aornos. The 'Queen's Rock' is a huge upright block on the north edge of the fort, on which R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vara's r\u00e1n\u00ed is said to have seated herself daily. The chief objection to the identification is the difference in height,\u2014R\u00e1n\u00edgat being only about 1000 feet high, while the Aornus of Arrian was said to be 6674. For a complete statement of the case, see General Cunningham's Ancient Geography of India, pp. 58-78 (1871).\n\nR\u00e1n\u00edkhet.\u2014Military sanatorium in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 39' 50\" N., long. 79\u00b0 33' E. R\u00e1n\u00edkhet has of late grown into importance as a sanatorium for European troops. It has several advantages over the other Him\u00e1layan sanitaria, as regards level land for building purposes, and accessibility from the plains. Some years ago it was proposed to move the military headquarters of the Indian army from Simla to R\u00e1n\u00edkhet, and barracks have been erected, or are in process of construction. If the water supply and other questions connected with the accommodation of Europeans are satisfactorily solved, R\u00e1n\u00edkhet may yet become one of the most important of our Indian hill stations. Its elevation is sufficient to render it a most salubrious retreat from the plains.\n\nR\u00e1n\u00ed-n\u00far ('The Queen's Palace').\u2014Rock cave in Khandgiri Hill, Puri District, Orissa. One of the most modern of a series of cave-temples with which Khandgiri and the neighbouring hill of Udayagiri are honeycombed. The earliest of these excavations exhibit what are believed to be the oldest memorials of Buddhism, and the first human dwellings yet discovered in India. The R\u00e1n\u00ed-n\u00far is the latest and most elaborate of these excavations, to which dates have been variously ascribed from 200 B.C. to 1000 A.D. It consists of two rows of cells, one above the other, shaded by pillared verandahs, with a court-yard cut out of the hillside. Two stalwart figures, in coats of mail down to the knees, stand forth from the wall as guards. One of them wears boots half-way up the knee; the other seems to have on greaves, the feet being naked, but the legs encased in armour. The court-yard opens towards the south, and is lined on the other three sides with rows of chambers. On the right and left appear to be the cooking-room and common dining-hall. The verandahs are commodious, and the rock brackets, which extend from\nthe pillars to support the intervening roof, are finely sculptured. The upper storey contains four large cells, each 14 feet long by 7 broad, and 3 feet 9 inches high. The verandah outside is about 60 feet long by 10 broad, and 7 in height. Each cell has two doors, and at either end is a lion, hewn out of the rock.\n\nThe upper verandah of the Queen's Palace is adorned with a sculptured biography of its founder. The first tableau, worn almost level with the rock, seems to represent the sending of presents, which preceded the matrimonial alliances of the ancient dynasties of India. A running figure stands dimly out, apparently carrying a tray of fruit. The second appears to be the arrival of the suitor. It delineates the meeting of the elephants, and a number of confused human forms, one of whom rides on a lion. From the third tableau the biography becomes more distinct. It represents the courtship. The prince is introduced by an old lady to the princess, who sits cross-legged on a high seat, with her eyes averted, and her arms round the neck of one of her maidens below. The fourth is the fight. The prince and princess, each armed with swords and oblong shields, engage in combat. The fifth is the abduction, depicting the princess defeated and carried off in the prince's arms, her sword lost, but her shield still grasped in her hand. The prince holds his sword drawn, and is amply clothed. The princess is scantily draped, and her hair knotted in a perpendicular chignon, rising from the top of her head, and a long tress falling over her bosom to her waist. She wears heavy anklets. The sixth is the hunt. A tree forms the centre of the piece, on one side of which the prince and princess are shooting at a bounding antelope; while a led horse stands near, and attendants armed with clubs. The prince draws his bow in the perpendicular fashion of English archers. It is about two-thirds his own height. A lady looks down upon the chase from the tree. A court scene follows, in which the prince sits on a throne on the left, with attendants holding fans on either side. Dancing girls and musicians are grouped in front, and the princess appears on a throne on the extreme right. The eighth and ninth tableaux are effaced. Three scenes of dalliance between the prince and the princess follow, and the series in the upper storey ends in a mysterious running figure with a snake twisted round him. The lower verandah exhibits the sequel. A convent scene discloses the princess retired from the vanities of life, sitting at her cell door in the upper storey of a sculptured monastery, with her ladies, also turned ascetics, sitting at separate doors in the lower one. The remaining tableaux, four in number, represent the prince, princess, and courtiers as hermits, with their hands on their breasts in an attitude of abstraction, freed from human passion, and wrapped in contemplation of the Deity. Throughout, the prince is generally fully dressed, with a cotton garment falling from his girdle,\nbut leaving the leg bare from the knee. The lady wears a head-dress something like the Prince of Wales' feathers, with her hair done up in a towering chignon. A scroll of birds and beasts and leaves runs the whole way along. The battle and hunting scenes are given with much spirit, the animals being very different from the conventional creatures of modern Hindu art. The sculptured legend of the princess is now much worn by climatic action, and its episodes are to a large extent conjectural.\n\nR\u00e1nipet.\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras; situated on the north bank of the Pal\u00e1r river, in lat. 12\u00b0 56' N., and long. 79\u00b0 23' 20\" E. Pop. (1872), 2838, inhabiting 911 houses. R\u00e1nipet comprises the European quarter of Arcot town, near the Arcot railway station. It is also the headquarters of the covenanted divisional officer, and was formerly a large cavalry station, now abandoned. The barracks, however, are in good preservation, and are occupied as a hospital, and as quarters for the families of sepoys on foreign service. The 'Nine L\u00e1kh Garden,' an extensive grove of mangoes, is near R\u00e1nipet. About 30 per cent of the population are Musalm\u00e1ns, consisting largely of sepoys and their families. The European and Eurasian residents number about 130.\n\nR\u00e1nipur.\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the Jh\u00e1nsi and Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on) road, 5 miles west of Mau (Mhow), with which it forms a municipal union. Lat. 25\u00b0 14' 40\" N., long. 79\u00b0 10' 45\" E.; pop. (1872), 6695, consisting of 6323 Hindus and 372 Muhammadans. Considerable manufacture of khar\u00eda cloth, dyed red with the root of the \u00e1l (Morinda citrifolia). The chief inhabitants are Jains, who compose the wealthy merchant class, and have a very handsome temple, with two high steeples and numerous cupolas. Fine b\u00e1d\u00e1r, with old and picturesque stone-built houses, and two small but pretty Jain shrines. Founded in 1678 by R\u00e1n\u00ed Hira Deva, widow of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r Sinh of Orchha. Police station, post office. (For municipal statistics, see Mau.)\n\nR\u00e1nipur.\u2014Town in Khairpur State, Sind; situated on the main road from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) to Rohri, 45 miles south-west of Rohri, and 15 due west of Diji fort. Lat. 27\u00b0 17' N., long. 68\u00b0 31' 30\" E.; pop. (1872), 6310, chiefly Muhammadans. The place is said to derive its name from the circumstance of the R\u00e1n\u00ed or queen of J\u00e1m Daria Kh\u00e1n, a prince who reigned at Tatta, in Lower Sind, having fled hither after her husband had been killed in battle. R\u00e1nipur was once the seat of a considerable manufacture of cotton cloth.\n\nRanjit, Great.\u2014River of Bengal, which rises in Independent Sikkim and enters D\u00e1rjiling District from the west, forming part of the northern boundary. After a short course from west to east, it falls into the Tista (lat. 27\u00b0 6' N., long. 88\u00b0 29' E.). Its affluents above the point of\njunction are the Rangu, the Chhota or Little Ranj\u00edt, and the Ram\u00e1n. This river, although not navigable, being purely a mountain stream, is not fordable within D\u00e1rjf\u00edling at any time of the year. It has shelving banks, generally clothed with forest, but with patches of cultivation at intervals; the bed is stony and sandy.\n\n**Ranj\u00edt, Little.**\u2014River of Bengal, rising in the Sing\u00e1l\u00edl\u00e1 range, on the borders of Sikkim and Nep\u00e1l. It flows generally in a north-easterly direction, and falls into the Great Ranj\u00edt on its right bank. In the dry and cold months it is everywhere fordable. The principal tributaries of the Little Ranj\u00edt are the K\u00e1hel, the Hospital Jh\u00f3rd, the Rilling, and the Serjang.\n\n**Ran-khyoung.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Mro-houng township of Akyab District, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 2531; gross revenue, \u00a3709.\n\n**Ranpur.**\u2014Town in Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 22' N., and long. 71\u00b0 45' E. Pop. (1872), 5796. Post office.\n\n**Ranpur.**\u2014Native State of Orissa, in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal; lying between lat. 19\u00b0 52' 45\" and 20\u00b0 12' N., and between long. 85\u00b0 9' 15\" and 85\u00b0 29' 15\" E. Area, 203 square miles. Bounded on the north, east, and south by Pur\u00ed District; and on the west by Nay\u00e1gahr State. The south-west part of Ranpur is a region of hills, forest-clad and almost entirely uninhabited, which wall in its whole western side, except at a single point where a pass leads into the adjoining State of Nay\u00e1gahr. The only town is the R\u00e1j\u00e1's place of residence, situated in lat. 20\u00b0 3' 55\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 23' 26\" E., which consists of one long and wide street, containing about 600 houses. The country products are here bartered at markets twice a week for iron, cotton, blankets, cotton cloth, silk, wheat, and clarified butter, brought from Khandp\u00e1ra; and for fish from the Chilk\u00e1 Lake. Population (1872), 27,306, consisting of 24,995 Hindus, 148 Muhammadans, and 2163 'others,' principally aboriginal Kandhs; total number of villages, 280, of which only one contained as many as from 3000 to 4000 inhabitants. The revenue of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is estimated at \u00a3696; the tribute paid to the British Government is \u00a3140. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's militia consists of 8, and the police force of 94 men. Forty-one schools are scattered through Ranpur. Tradition affirms that this State was founded 3600 years ago by a hunter called B\u00e1sara B\u00e1suk; its name is said to be derived from a giant Ran\u00e1sur.\n\n**Ran-wa.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Mro-houng township of Akyab District, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 2020; gross revenue, \u00a3989.\n\n**R\u00e1oj\u00e1n.**\u2014Village and police station in the headquarters Subdivision of Chittagong District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 32' N., long. 91\u00b0 57' 50\" E.; pop. under 5000.\n\n**R\u00e1pri.**\u2014Village and ruins in M\u00e1inpuri District, North-Western\nProvinces. Pop. (1872), 903. Lies among the wild ravines on the left bank of the Jumna, about 44 miles south-west of M\u0101inpuri. Numerous remains of Hindu and Muhammedan times exist in the neighbourhood. Local tradition ascribes the foundation of the ancient city to R\u00e1o Zor\u00e1war Sinh, also known as R\u00e1par Sen, whose descendant fell in battle against Muhammad Ghori in 1194 A.D. Mosques, tombs, wells, and reservoirs mark its former greatness; and several inscriptions found among the ruins have thrown much light upon the local history. The most important of these dates from the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilj\u00ed.\n\nR\u00e1pti.\u2014River of Oudh and the North-Western Provinces. It rises among the outer Him\u00e1layan ranges of Nep\u00e1l, in lat. 28\u00b0 19' N., and long. 82\u00b0 53' E., and flowing round a long spur of mountains, first southerly for 40 miles, and then north-westerly for 45 miles, enters British territory in Bahr\u00e1ich District, Oudh, in lat. 28\u00b0 3' N., and long. 81\u00b0 55' E. It then traverses the plains for 90 miles, passing through Bahr\u00e1ich and Gonda Districts, till it reaches the North-Western Provinces in Basti District. Thenceforth its course becomes extremely tortuous, winding at its will through the soft alluvial soil. Throughout, it possesses two channels, the older lying to the north and remaining dry except in the rainy season. It is also liable to frequent changes of its bed. Numerous lakes in Basti District communicate with the R\u00e1pti, the chief being the T\u00e1l Bakhira, T\u00e1l Pathra, and Chaur T\u00e1l. It then enters Gorakhpur District, flows beside the town of Gorakhpur, and finally joins the Gogra (Ghagra) in lat. 26\u00b0 15' N., and long. 83\u00b0 42' E., after a total course of 400 miles. The last 85 miles, below Gorakhpur, are navigable for large boats, and considerable quantities of grain and timber are sent down to the Ganges ports. In the rains, the stream has a breadth of a quarter of a mile, and flows at the rate of 5 miles an hour; but during the hot weather it shrinks to 150 yards, with a velocity of only 2 miles an hour. The current often cuts away large pieces of land and transfers them from one village to another. Its principal tributary is the Burh\u00e1 R\u00e1pti, which joins it on its left bank in Gorakhpur District.\n\nR\u00e1san.\u2014Village in B\u00e1nida District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 2707. Distant from B\u00e1nida town 29 miles south-east, from K\u00e1l\u00ednjar 7 miles north-east. Situated at the foot of an isolated hill, crowned by the ruins of an old fort. An ancient temple, probably of Chandel date, and now disused, stands in the centre of the enclosure. Mounds surround the village, pointed out by tradition as the remains of a large town called R\u00e1jbansi. Local legends affirm that about the 15th century Ballabh Deo Ju fought against the Delhi troops on this spot, and that the imperialists, being victorious, plundered and burnt the old town, which has remained in ruins ever since. One R\u00e1m Krishna then founded the present village of R\u00e1san near the deserted town and\nfort of R\u00e1jbansi, and his descendants are still zamind\u00e1rs in the village. Headquarters of a pargan\u00e1 under Akbar.\n\n**Rasandah.**\u2014Tahsil of Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces, lying in the upland portion of the District, above the modern alluvial Gangetic valley. Area, 335 square miles, of which 217 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 187,766 souls; land revenue, \u00a318,798; total Government revenue, \u00a320,611; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a341,297.\n\n**Rasuli.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh; situated 4 miles east of the civil station of Naw\u00e1bganj, on the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) road. A Musalm\u00e1n settlement of some antiquity. Pop. (1869), 3431, viz. Muhammadans, 1727, and Hindus, 1704.\n\n**R\u00e1sipur.**\u2014Town in Salem District, Madras; situated on the Salem-N\u00e1makal road, in lat. 11\u00b0 27' 30\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 13' 47\" E. Pop. (1871), 8006, residing in 1501 houses. The station of a sub-magistrate. Principal industries\u2014silk-weaving, iron-smelting, and sugar-boiling.\n\n**Ras Mu\u00e1ri** (or Cape Monze, Ras Movari, etc.; called Ras Jil by the Baluch\u00eds).\u2014The frontier promontory between Sind and Baluchist\u00e1n, at the south-eastern extremity of the estuary of the H\u00e1b River. Lat. 24\u00b0 50' N., long. 66\u00b0 43' E. This headland, well known to mariners, forms the extreme southern offshoot of the hills which, under the name of Brahuik, H\u00e1la, etc., separate Sind from Baluchist\u00e1n. Pottinger speaks of it as \u2018springing abruptly to a conspicuous height and grandeur out of the sea.\u2019 As a matter of fact, it rises as a gradually sloping bluff, with a low, rocky point, to a height of 1200 feet. The Hab river washes its eastern base; and on the Baluch\u00ed or western side of the Hab estuary, rise the Jebel Pabb Mountains, with peaks as high as 2500 feet. A rocky bank projects about 2\u00bd miles into the sea from Cape Monze to the south and south-west, with from 3 to 5 fathoms of water. Cape Monze, with the Jebel Pabb on the Baluch\u00ed or western side of the river, form well-known landmarks for making Kar\u00e1chi during the south-west monsoon. No vessel should, however, round Ras Mu\u00e1ri in less than 15 fathoms, as there are shoals, not yet thoroughly surveyed, deposited by the silt brought down by the Hab and by the deltaic distributaries of the Indus.\n\n**Rasra.**\u2014Town in Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 25\u00b0 51' 20\" N., long. 83\u00b0 53' 55\" E.; pop. (1872), 7261, consisting of 4662 Hindus and 2599 Muhammadans. Distant from Gh\u00e1zipur town 28 miles north-east, from Ballia 22 miles north-west. Trade in spices, cloth, and sugar.\n\n**R\u00e1ssa.**\u2014Village in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal. Noted as the residence of the descendants of the Mysore princes. Central prison for female convicts.\n\n**Rastam.**\u2014Village in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind; 9 miles north-east of Shik\u00e1rpur town. Contains a police station, travellers\u2019 bungalow, and\nRASULABAD\u2014RATANPUR.\n\ndharm\u015bl\u00e1. Pop. (1872), 1114, of whom 653 were Muhammadans and 461 Hindus. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture. Lat. 27\u00b0 58' N., long. 68\u00b0 51' 30\" E.\n\nR\u00e1s\u00falab\u00e1d.\u2014Central western tahsil of Cawnpore District, North-Western Provinces, lying in the middle of the Do\u00e1b uplands. Lat. 26\u00b0 41' 15\" N., long. 79\u00b0 49' 15\" E.; area, 223 square miles, of which 108 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 98,505; land revenue, \u00a319,155; total Government revenue, \u00a321,091; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a332,455; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2s. 8\u00bdd.\n\nRas\u00falab\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; situated 14 miles north of Unao town, in lat. 26\u00b0 50' N., and long. 80\u00b0 30' E. Pop. (1869), 3443, viz. Hindus, 2740, and Musalm\u00e1ns, 703. Four mosques, 5 Hindu temples, 2 weekly markets. Has some reputation for goldsmiths' and jewellers' work.\n\nR\u00e1s\u00falpur.\u2014River of Bengal, the only tributary of the H\u00fagl\u00ed within Midnapur District. It rises in the south-west of that District, under the name of the B\u00e1gd\u00e1, and flows eastwards and south-eastwards till it falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed below Cowcolly lighthouse, a short distance above the embouchure of that river into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nRas\u00falpur.\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; situated on the bank of the Gogra river, 4 miles from T\u00e1nda. Pop. (1869), 3691, viz. 2225 Hindus and 1466 Muhammadans, including 9 Shias.\n\nRatanm\u00e1l.\u2014One of the petty States in the Bhil Agency, under the Central India Agency. The present Th\u00e1kur, named Abai Sinh, was born about 1845. Estimated revenue (1875), \u00a360. The State receives no allowances from, nor does it pay any tribute to, the British Government. The population is entirely Bhil.\n\nRatanpur.\u2014Town in Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces, 12 miles north of Bil\u00e1spur town; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 16' 30\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 11' E., in a hollow surrounded by the Kend\u00e1 offshoots of the Vindhy\u00e1n range. Ratanpur was the capital of the Haihai Bans\u00ed kings of Chhat\u00eds-garh. Since the death of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bimb\u00e1j\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1, in 1787, the town has steadily decayed, though the crumbling arches of the old fort, the broken walls of the ancient palace, and the half-filled up moat which surrounded the city, recall its former grandeur. The population, 6910 in 1866, had by 1872 been reduced to 5111. Among them are many traders, who deal in lac, cloth, spices, and metals with M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, and also a large section of lettered Br\u00e1hmans, the hereditary holders of rent-free villages, who are the interpreters of the sacred writings, and the ministers of religious rites over a great portion of Chhat\u00edsgarh. The town covers 15 square miles, and contains within its limits a perfect forest of mango-trees, with numerous tanks and temples scattered amid their shade. Mixed up with the temples, great blocks of masonry of uniform shape commemorate distinguished satis. The most promi-\nment of these is near the old fort, where a large building, gracefully adorned on all sides with arches and minarets, records that there, two hundred and forty years ago, 20 R\u00e1n\u00eds of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Lakshman Sah\u00ed devoutly fulfilled the duty of self-immolation.\n\n**Ratanpur Dhamanka.** \u2014 One of the petty States of Gohelw\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 3 villages, with 3 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue (1876), \u00a3585; tribute of \u00a375 is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a315 to the N\u00e1wab of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\n**Ratesh.** \u2014 Petty State in the Punjab, subordinate to Keunth\u00e1l. Area, 3 square miles; estimated pop. 437; estimated revenue, \u00a320. The chief is styled Th\u00e1kur.\n\n**R\u00e1th.** \u2014 North-western tahsil of Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a level plain, lying along the rivers Dh\u00e1s\u00e1n and Betw\u00e1. Area, 381 square miles, of which 251 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 102,499; land revenue, \u00a321,038; total Government revenue, \u00a322,414; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a334,864; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 1s. 8\u00bdd.\n\n**R\u00e1th.** \u2014 Ancient but decaying town in Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of R\u00e1th tahsil. Lat. 25\u00b0 35' 35\" N., long. 79\u00b0 36' 55\" E.; pop. (1872), 14,515, consisting of 10,402 Hindus and 4,113 Muhammadans. Probably derives its name from the Rahtor clan of R\u00e1jputs. Said to have been refounded in 1210 A.D. by Sharaf-ud-d\u00edn, who called it Sharaft\u00e1b\u00e1d after himself. Formerly of considerable importance, but now declining through its remoteness from modern trade routes. Several mosques, temples, and tanks. Remains of ancient Chandel buildings south of the town. Ruins of two forts, built by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaitpur and Charkh\u00e1ri during the last century. Mosque and well bear inscriptions of Aurangzeb's reign. Tomb of Bar\u00e1 P\u00edr, west of town, built over a sacred brick brought from Bagdad from the shrine of Shaikh Abd-ul-K\u00e1dir Jil\u00e1ni. Handsome b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Trade in grain, cotton, and molasses. Manufacture of country cloth, dyes, and saltpetre. Tahsili, police station, post office, dispensary, school, two good sard\u00eds. During the Mutiny of 1857, the tahsild\u00e1r and the kan\u00fango were killed, but not by the people of R\u00e1th, who bear an excellent character as orderly and well-disposed subjects. A municipality was established in 1867, but abolished two years later.\n\n**Ra-thai.** \u2014 Revenue circle in Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 3117; gross revenue, \u00a3739.\n\n**Ra-thai-doung.** \u2014 Township in Akyab District, Arakan Division, British Burma. The cultivated area is mainly on the banks of the Ma-y\u00fa river, which traverses the tract in a general northerly and southerly direction. Pop. (1876), 55,189; gross revenue, \u00a318,112. Headquarters at Ra-thai-doung village; pop. 639.\n\n**Ra-thai-myo.** \u2014 Ancient capital of the kingdom of Prome, British\nBurma. Known also as Tha-re-khettra; about 8 miles west of Prome town, on the main road northwards to Mye-dai. The ruins of massive pagodas, and of an extensive embankment, mark the site, now overgrown with jungle, except where cleared for rice cultivation.\n\nRatia.\u2014Town in Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab; distant from Hiss\u00e1r town 40 miles north-west. Pop. (1868), 2745. Now scarcely more than a J\u00e1t village, but bearing marks of former importance, like so many other places in the desolated tract once watered by the Ghaggar and Saraswati (Sarsuti). Originally held by Tu\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, then conquered by the Path\u00e1n invaders. Devastated by the great Chalisa famine in 1783-84, and colonized since British occupation by its present J\u00e1t inhabitants. Small trade in grain.\n\nRatl\u00e1m.\u2014Native State in the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency, under the Central India Agency. Area, about 1200 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 100,000. The revenue from all sources was, in the same year, estimated at \u00a3130,000, of which more than half is alienated in j\u00e1girs and other grants. The N\u00edmach State Railway connecting Indore with N\u00edmach and Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nuseerabad) passes by Ratl\u00e1m town.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratl\u00e1m, who is descended from a younger branch of the Jodhpur family, ranks as the first R\u00e1jput chief in Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1. One of his ancestors, Ratan Sinh, having displayed conspicuous courage in Delhi, received a grant of territory in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 from the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The State is held as tributary to Sindhia; but in 1819 an arrangement was made by which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratl\u00e1m agreed to pay an annual tribute of Sal\u00edm Shahi Rs. 84,000 (or about \u00a36600), while Sindhia engaged never to send any troops into the country or interfere with the internal administration. This tribute was assigned, by the treaty of 1844 between the British Government and Sindhia, in part payment of the Gwalior Contingent. It is now paid to the British Government. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Jaswant Sinh, a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, was born about 1860. He was placed on the gadi when only three years old. During his minority, the State has been managed by Shaikh Sh\u00e1hamat Al\u00ed as Political Agent. Education has much advanced of late years; there are (1875) 23 schools, with 1510 pupils. Jail; good roads. A steam engine has been imported to work a saw-mill and a grinding-mill; the introduction of a cotton-mill is in contemplation, and experiments are being made with the view to supplying the capital with water-works. In 1875, 9962 patients were treated at the Ratl\u00e1m Dispensary. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratl\u00e1m has a personal salute of 13 guns. His military establishment consists of 5 field guns, 58 artillerymen, 35 cavalry, and 300 infantry.\n\nRatl\u00e1m.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name, M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Central India. Lat. 23\u00b0 21' N., long. 75\u00b0 7' E.; 1577 feet above sea level. Good b\u00e1z\u00e1rs. One of the principal seats of the opium trade of M\u00e1lw\u00e1.\nRatn\u00e1giri.\u2014A British District in the Konkan Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between lat. 15\u00b0 43' and 18\u00b0 5' N., and between long. 73\u00b0 3' 36\" and 74\u00b0 2' E. Area, 3789 square miles; pop. (1872), 1,019,136. Bounded on the north by the District of Kol\u00e1ba; on the east by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Belg\u00e1um, and the Native State of Kolh\u00e1pur; on the south by the Portuguese possessions of Goa; and on the west by the Arabian Sea.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District may be described generally as rocky and rugged. Near the coast, it consists of bare elevated plateaux, intersected by numerous creeks and navigable rivers, flowing between steep and lofty hills. Ten miles or so inland, the country becomes more open; but advancing a little farther, it is occupied by spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills. This range itself forms the continuous eastern boundary, running parallel to the coast. It varies in height from 2000 to 3000 feet, though some of the peaks attain an altitude of 5000 feet. While the banks of the rivers produce splendid crops of rice in the rains, and pulse in the cold weather, and some of the inland valleys exhibit the utmost fertility, the soil is, as a rule, poor and barren, and supports with difficulty its dense population. The coast, about 150 miles in length, is almost uniformly rocky and dangerous. It consists of a series of small bays and coves shut in between jutting headlands, and edged with sand of dazzling whiteness. At places the hills recede a little, leaving at their base a rich tract of rice-fields, with generally a strip of cocoa-nut gardens between them and the beach. At intervals of about 10 miles, a river or bay opens, sufficiently large to form a secure harbour for native craft; and the promontories at the river mouths are almost invariably crowned with the ruins of an old fort. The larger rivers and creeks are practicable for 20 or 30 miles from the coast; and many of the most important towns are situated at their farthest navigable point, for in so rough a country the rivers form the best highways of trade and communication. The wells of the coast villages supply a brackish but not unwholesome water. The mineral wealth of Ratn\u00e1giri is small, its rocks yielding nothing but building and road materials. The principal product is fish, of which a considerable quantity is exported through the passes of the Sahy\u00e1dri range into the Deccan. It is very imperfectly cured and salted, being often merely soaked in a briny mud and then dried in the sun. Sardines swarm on the coast at certain seasons in such abundance as to be used for manure. Many sharks are taken, and their fins and tails dried and exported to Bombay for the China trade. Tigers, leopards, bears, bison, wild boar, s\u00e1mbhar deer, and hy\u00e6nas are found in the forests on the slopes and near the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills. Ratn\u00e1giri formed part of the dominions of the Peshw\u00e1, and was annexed by the British Government in 1818, on the overthrow of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o.\nPopulation.\u2014The Census returns of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,019,136 persons, residing in 1,290 villages and 224,790 houses; density of population, 268 per square mile; houses per square mile, 59; persons per village, 790; persons per house, 4\u00b753. Classified according to sex, there were 491,116 males and 528,020 females; proportion of males, 48\u00b719 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 203,995, and females, 191,514; total children, 395,509, or 38\u00b780 per cent. of the population. Classified according to religion, 940,849 were Hindus, 74,834 Musalm\u00e1ns, 9 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and 3244 Christians.\n\nThe sailors and fishermen, who are either Musalm\u00e1ns or Hindus of the Bhand\u00e1ri, Koli, and Gabit castes, are distinguished by independence of mind and manner, and are also in much better circumstances than the agricultural population. The agricultural castes are Marhatt\u00e1s, Kumbis, and Mh\u00e1rs, who, except for their great poverty, do not differ materially from those of the Deccan. They are a quiet and inoffensive race, crimes of violence being almost unknown among them. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns, the most noticeable are those known in Bombay under the general name of Konkani Musalm\u00e1ns, whose headquarters are at B\u00e1nkot. They hold a few rich villages on the S\u00e1vitri river, and say that they are descendants of Arab settlers at Dabul, Chaul, and other towns in the Konkan. Some of them can give particulars of the immigration of their forefathers, and the features of many have a distinctly Arab cast. Many native Christians are to be found at Harnay, M\u00e1wan, Vingorla, and other coast towns, with names strangely combined from European and native elements. From the time that the British Government began to raise Sepoy regiments, the Southern Konkan has always been the great recruiting ground of the Bombay Presidency. In Ratn\u00e1giri alone, there are at present not less than 12,000 pensioners, Mh\u00e1rs mustering very strongly. The people of this District also flock to Bombay in great numbers, supplying its labour market. The Census of 1872 showed 56,879 labourers from Ratn\u00e1giri in Bombay city. But the majority, who are occasional workmen, return to their villages for the rainy season. About the year 1864, before Bombay offered so large a market for labour, numbers went from Ratn\u00e1giri to the Mauritius, but of late years this emigration has almost entirely ceased.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture supports 743,217 persons, or 72\u00b792 per cent. of the total population. As the District has not been entirely brought under the operations of the Survey, the exact area of the total Government cultivable land is not known. Of 1,003,782 acres under actual cultivation in 1876-77, of which 15,976 acres were twice cropped, grains occupied over 946,000 acres, or over 93 per cent.; pulses, 26,962, or 2\u00b768 per cent.; oil-seeds, 24,852, or 2\u00b747 per cent.; fibres, 6,379, or 0\u00b763 per cent.; and miscellaneous crops, 14,924, or 1\u00b748 per cent. Hemp is grown by the fisherman for their nets. The fertile land is found along\nthe banks of the rivers or salt-water creeks in the neighbourhood of the sea; but the soil is generally poor, consisting in great measure of a stiff ferruginous clay, often mixed with gravel. There are several cocoa-nut plantations in the District. In 1876-77, rice occupied 143,636 acres. The better kinds of rice land produce also sugar-cane and second crops of some description of pulse or vegetable. By far the greater proportion of the food crops consist of inferior grains, called warkas. The warkas land may be divided into the more level parts, where the plough can be used; and the steeper slopes admitting only of cultivation by manual labour. The best of the poorer soils bear crops for five or six successive years, and then require a fallow of nearly equal duration.\n\nThe land tenures of the District differ from that of Bombay generally, in that there is a class of large landholders, called khots, in the position of middle-men between Government and the actual cultivators. Considerable areas on the coast and along the banks of the larger creeks have been granted on reclamation leases. The years 1792, 1802, and 1877, are remembered as terrible seasons of famine in this District. The poverty of the overcrowded peasants on the sterile uplands of Ratn\u00e1giri has attracted much attention of late; and the local tenures have furnished a most difficult problem to the Bombay Courts and the Government.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014From beyond the line of the Sahy\u00e1dis, grain, cotton, and sugar are brought down to the sea-coast for exportation, and the carts and bullocks thus engaged generally take back cocoa-nuts, salt, and dried fish. The total value of the sea-borne trade of the seventeen ports in the District amounted in 1876 to \u00a32,410,611, of which \u00a31,004,547 represented the exports, and \u00a31,406,064 imports. The manufactures of Ratn\u00e1giri are unimportant. In 1852, Captain (now Sir George) Wingate wrote: \u2018There are not even bullock-paths from many villages to the nearest market towns, and the whole of the produce sent there for sale is taken upon men\u2019s heads. Carts are unknown.\u2019 But of late years, many improvements have been made. Two good cart-roads now cross the Sahy\u00e1di Hills, and also a trunk road, with branches from one end of the District to the other. There are at present 500 miles of road in the District. Labourers earn 5\u00bdd. a day; bricklayers and carpenters, 1s. a day. The current prices of the chief articles of food in 1876 were, for a rupee\u2014rice, 27 lbs.; nd\u00e1gli, 41 lbs.; d\u00e1l (split-peas), 21 lbs.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue in 1876-77 under all heads, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3133,955; the incidence of taxation per head being 2s. 7\u00bdd. The land tax forms the principal source of income, yielding \u00a390,882. The District local funds, created since 1863, yielded a total of \u00a313,404. There are four municipalities, containing an aggregate population of 35,348 persons. Their receipts\nwere returned at \u00a32286, and the incidence of taxation varied from \u00bdd. to 1s. 1d. per head of population. The District is administered by a Collector and 4 Assistants. It is provided with a District Judge's court, and 9 civil courts. The total strength of the regular police in 1876-77 consisted of 765 officers and men, giving 1 policeman to every 1332 of the population and to every 4.95 square miles of the area. The total cost was \u00a310,886, equal to \u00a32, 17s. 5\u00bdd. per square mile of area and 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The District contains one jail. Education has widely spread of late years. In 1855-56, there were only 20 schools, attended by 2403 pupils. In 1876-77, there were 147 schools, with 8776 pupils, or an average of 1 school for every 8 villages. Four newspapers were published in 1876-77.\n\nClimate.\u2014The annual rainfall during the five years ending 1876 averaged 105 inches. The prevailing diseases are intermittent fevers and leprosy. There are 3 dispensaries in the District, and a hospital for lepers.\n\nRatn\u00e1giri.\u2014Chief town of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 59' 37\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 19' 50\" N., 136 miles south by east of Bombay. Pop. (1872), 10,614. The town is open, and faces the sea; the fort stands on a rock between two small bays, but these afford neither shelter nor good anchorage, as they are completely exposed and have a rocky bottom. With any breeze from the west, a heavy surf breaks on the bar, and boats can only enter at high tide. The water supply is entirely derived from wells, which are for the most part never-failing. One object of interest connected with Ratn\u00e1giri is the t\u00e1rli or sardine fishery, which usually takes place in the months of January and February, when fleets of canoes may be seen engaged in this occupation. A single net-caster will fill his canoe in the course of a morning. The fishing ground is just outside the breakers. The industry can be carried on only when the water is sufficiently clear to admit of the fish being readily seen. The salt-water creek to the south of the fort is only practicable for country craft of under 20 tons burden. The average annual value of the trade of Ratn\u00e1giri port for the five years ending 1873-74 is returned at \u00a3308,646, viz. imports, \u00a342,576, and exports, \u00a3266,070. The chief imports are salt, timber, catechu, and grain; exports\u2014fuel, fish, and bamboos. Besides being the headquarters of the District officers, Ratn\u00e1giri has a sub-judge's court, civil hospital, and post office. The lighthouse was erected in 1867. The elevation of the lantern above high water is 250 feet, and the height of the building, from base to vane, 37 feet. It exhibits a single, red, fixed dioptric light, of order 3, which is visible at 18 miles' distance.\n\nRato Dero.\u2014T\u00e1luk of L\u00e1rk\u00e1na Sub-District, Shik\u00e1rpur Collectorate, Sind. Area, 228 square miles; pop. (1872), 35,896. Gross revenue in 1873-74, \u00a3972c.\nRato Dero.\u2014Chief town of Rato Dero taluk, in L\u00e1rk\u00e1na Sub-District, Shik\u00e1rpur, Sind; 18 miles north-east by north from L\u00e1rk\u00e1na. Headquarters of a mukhi\u00e1rd\u00e1r, and tappad\u00e1r, and contains the usual public buildings. Municipal revenue in 1873-74, \u00a3341. Pop. (1872), 3057, of whom 1646 were Muhammadans and 1411 Hindus. Local trade in grain. Rato Dero was formerly the encampment of a chief of the Jalb\u00e1ni tribe called Rato.\n\nRat-thit.\u2014Revenue circle in the Shwe-lay township of Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. In the north, the country is hilly and covered with dense forest, abounding in teak, pyeng-ga-do, and sha. Pop. (1876-77), 4329; gross revenue, \u00a3744.\n\nRau Karna.\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; situated 7 miles from Unao town, on the road to Safipur. Pop. (1869), 2273, of whom only 78 are Muhammadans. Small market, twice a week.\n\nR\u00e1ver.\u2014Town in the Sonda Subdivision of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay. Lat. 21\u00b0 15' N., long. 76\u00b0 4' 30\" E.; pop. (1872), 6558. Station on the north-east line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 297 miles north-east of Bombay. R\u00e1ver has a local reputation for its manufactures of gold thread and articles of native apparel. It was ceded by the Niz\u00e1m to the Peshw\u00e1 in 1763, and by the latter bestowed on Holkar's family. Post office.\n\nR\u00e1ver.\u2014Town in Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces; on the Nerbudda (Narbada) river, 40 miles from Khandwa. It contains the cenotaph of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, who died at R\u00e1ver in 1740, when about to invade Northern India for the second time. The monument is built of variegated sandstone, enclosed in a spacious dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la of strong masonry. A handsome gh\u00e1t, opposite the platform in the centre of the river, where the funeral rites were performed, has been much injured by floods. R\u00e1ver lies a short distance from the Barw\u00e1i or Dhang\u00e1on travellers' bungalow, and is also accessible from Barw\u00e1i by boat.\n\nR\u00e1vi.\u2014River in the Punjab (Panj\u00e1b); one of the five great streams from which the Province derives its name. The Hydraotes of Arrian, and the Iravati of Sanskrit authors. Rises in Kullu, K\u00e1ngra District, and immediately passes into Chamba State. Strikes upon British territory again on the borders of Gurd\u00e1spur District, opposite Bas\u00e1oli in Jamu, and forms the boundary of our dominions for 25 miles, with a general south-westerly course. Leaves the hills on the southern bank at Sh\u00e1hpur, but still flows between high cliffs, while on the Jamu side the mountains descend to its very brink. At Madhupur, the head-works of the Bari Doab Canal draw off a large portion of its waters. Thenceforward, the banks sink in height, and the river assumes the usual character of the Punjab streams, flowing in the centre of an alluvial valley, with outer banks at some distance from the present bed.\nIn 1870, it carried away the Tali Sahib shrine near Der\u00e1 N\u00e1nak, a place of great sanctity with the Sikhs, and still threatens the town. The R\u00e1vi next passes between Si\u00e1lkot and Amritsar Districts, preserving the general south-westerly direction which it has taken since leaving the mountains. The depth is here not more than a foot in March and April, swelling in June and September to 18 or 20 feet. Entering the District of Lahore, it runs within 1 mile of Lahore city, and throws out several branches, which soon, however, rejoin the parent stream. A bridge of boats conveys across the Lahore and Peshawar road. After entering Montgomery District, it receives its chief tributary, the Degh, on its north-western bank, and then passes into M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) District. Finally, it falls into the Chen\u00e1b (Chin\u00e1b) (lat. 30\u00b0 31' N., long. 71\u00b0 51' 20\" E.), after a total length of about 450 miles. Throughout its course in the plains, it flows everywhere in a comparatively narrow valley, often only a couple of miles in width, with a very tortuous channel. Few islands are formed, but the bed shifts occasionally from place to place. Its floods only fertilize a fringe of 1 or 2 miles on either side; and it is little employed for purposes of direct irrigation, though it supplies water both to the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b and H\u00e1sl\u00ed Canals. Navigation is difficult, but grain is shipped from Lahore in considerable quantities. Deod\u00e1r timber, floated down in rafts from the Chamba forests, only finds its way to Lahore in seasons of heavy flood. In former times, the R\u00e1vi did not join the Chen\u00e1b until a point below M\u00falt\u00e1n city, and its ancient bed may still be traced. Even now, at times of high flood, the water finds its way to M\u00falt\u00e1n by the old channel.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014A British Division or Commissionership in the Punjab, comprising the four Districts of R\u00e1wal Pindi, Jhelum, Gujrat, and Shahpur, each of which see separately. Area of R\u00e1wal Pindi Division, 16,724 square miles; pop. (1868), 2,197,387 souls.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 33\u00b0 and 34\u00b0 N. lat, and between 71\u00b0 46' and 73\u00b0 41' E. long.; with an area of 6218 square miles, and a population in 1868 of 711,256 souls. Bounded on the north by Haz\u00e1ra District, on the east by the river Jhelum, on the south by Jhelum District, and on the west by the Indus. The administrative headquarters are at the town of R\u00e1wal Pindi.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of R\u00e1wal Pindi forms a portion of the rugged and broken Himalayan spur which projects irregularly into the northern angle of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b. Its surface is cut up in every direction by mountain ranges entering it from either side, while the intermediate valleys are intersected by minor heights, whose confused and irregular masses crop out in picturesque diversity, to the despair of the systematic geographer. So far as these fantastic bosses\ncan be reduced to any order, they naturally divide themselves into two characteristic regions, on the east and west of an imaginary central line. The eastern range, running along the side of the Jhelum river, is known by the name of the Murree (Marri) Hills, from the sanatorium perched upon its northern extremity. It is composed of sandstone slopes, the direct outliers of the Himalayas, and is clothed with magnificent forest trees and a rich undergrowth of brushwood. Near the summer station of Murree (Marri), the spur attains a height of 8000 feet, and stretching thence into the District of Hazara, loses itself at last in the snowy ranges of Kashmir. The view from the sanatorium embraces the white cloud-like summits of the Kashmir Mountains, with a rich and varied foreground of wooded hillside and cultivated dale. Southward, the hills decrease in height, growing more diversified and angular, but gaining in picturesqueness what they lose in sublimity. Villages appear on every jutting ledge, half hidden amid the foliage of lilacs and mulberries, overtopped by a graceful mosque, and threatened from above by some frowning fortress of Sikh or Ghakkar chieftain. At length, on the southern frontier, the hills slowly subside into a comparatively level country, only divided from the valley of the Jhelum by a narrow barrier of sandstone. The western half of the District presents a very different appearance. Its mountains belong to the trans-Indus system, which is here severed by the deeply cut channel of the great river, so as to give off a series of isolated ridges, cutting up the opposite bank into wild mazes of limestone hills. The soil here is dry and barren; the vegetation is scanty and stunted; the valleys are mere water-worn ravines or beds of flooded torrents; and the population is crowded into large villages, which lie scattered at great distances among the inhospitable rocks. The chief range of these western mountains is known as the Chitta Pahar, from the whiteness of its exposed nummulitic beds. To the north lies the fertile valley of Chach, one of the rare oases which relieve the wildness of this savage waste. A minor range ends in the black cliffs of Attock, an important ferry and fortress on the Indus, now held by a strong European force, including a battery of artillery. Smaller lines of hills cover the remainder of the area, in too great numbers for special description. Of the rivers, the Indus claims first rank, and bounds the District along its whole western edge. After entering in a narrow channel from Hazara, it suddenly expands to a breadth of more than a mile, and embraces many wooded islets in its placid stream. At Attock it contracts once more, as it rushes under the dark rocks of Jalalia and Kamalia; while below, it again becomes a broad blue lake at Bagh Nilab, and yet again narrows to pass through the beetling gorge of the Mokhad Hills. At Mokhad it becomes navigable for steamers, and immediately passes beyond the borders of Rawal Pindi. The Jhelum on the eastern frontier (the Hydaspes of Greek and Roman\nwriters) is equally picturesque, though less important for navigation. The other chief rivers are the Sohan and the Haroh, both tributaries of the Indus. They run in a south-westerly course, and are fordable at ordinary seasons, though they become dangerous and seething torrents after continued rain.\n\nHistory.\u2014Few Districts in India can claim so long a period of authentic history as Rawal Pindi; for although it does not share in the mythical glories of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, it contains many of the towns connected with the great events of Alexander's Punjab campaign, and is accordingly enshrined in the more trustworthy pages of Arrian and Pliny. Its earliest inhabitants appear to have been the Takkas, a Turanian race who held the greater part of the Sind S\u0101gar Do\u00e1b, and gave their name to the town of Taksh\u0101sila (the Taxila of Greek geographers). Alexander found it 'a rich and populous city, the largest between the Indus and Hydaspes;' and its site has been identified in the ruins of Dera Shahan or Shah Deri, which lie to the north of the Margala Pass in this District. Fifty years after Alexander's invasion, the people of Taxila were subject to the King of Magadha; and a rebellion on their part was put down by prince Asoka, afterwards the famous Buddhist Emperor of Upper India. The notes of the two great Buddhist pilgrims from China during the middle ages show us that Taxila remained a place of peculiar sanctity until the period of Muhammadan conquest. Many relics of ancient temples are still to be found in the District, and legend connects their sites in several cases with important events in the life of Buddha himself. But when the Musalm\u00e1n invasions first draw the veil which hangs over Indian history from the era of Alexander down to the 11th century, we find the country around Taxila in possession of the Ghakkars, a non-Aryan tribe, who are described by Ferishta as mere savages, addicted to the grossest forms of polyandry and infanticide. In 1008, Mahm\u016bd of Ghazn\u012b was met on the plains of Chach by the forces of the R\u0101jput confederacy under Prithwi R\u0101j\u0101, and his victory was almost averted through the impetuous attack of 30,000 Ghakkars. But the battle ended in the total defeat of the R\u0101jputs, and all upper India lay helpless at the feet of the Musalm\u00e1n conqueror. Mahm\u016bd, however, appears to have left the Ghakkars in quiet possession of their mountain home, and to have pressed on to the occupation of more fertile regions. We next hear of the tribe in 1205, when the reverses of Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn Ghori in Kharizm encouraged them to rise in revolt against their Muhammadan suzerain, and to ravage the Punjab up to the very gates of Lahore. But the Sult\u0101n returned unexpectedly to India, defeated the rebellious Ghakkars with great slaughter, and compelled them to embrace the faith of Isl\u0101m. Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn did not live to profit by their conversion; for on his way home to his western dominions he was surprised on the farther bank of the Indus by a\nGhakkar detachment, who swam the river and murdered him at night in his tent. Under subsequent rulers, the country maintained its character for turbulence, being always ready for revolt whenever the misfortunes of the reigning prince afforded a favourable opportunity. B\u00e1bar attacked the Ghakkar capital of Pharw\u00e1la, and he gives an interesting account of its capture in his autobiography. It was strongly situated in the hills, and was defended with great bravery by its chief H\u00e1ti Kh\u00e1n, who escaped from one gate as the Mughal army marched in at the other. H\u00e1ti Kh\u00e1n died by poison in 1525, and his cousin and murderer, Sult\u00e1n S\u00e1rang, made submission to B\u00e1bar, who conferred upon him in return the Putw\u00e1r country. Thenceforth the Ghakkar chieftains became firm allies of the Mughal dynasty, whom they were able to aid efficiently in their struggle with the house of Sher Sh\u00e1h. During the flourishing period of the Delhi Empire, the family of S\u00e1rang retained their territorial possessions and high social status in the Punjab; but with the decay of the central power they fell a prey, like so many of their neighbours, to the aggressive rule of the Sikh marauders. In 1765, during the total paralysis of the Delhi government, Sard\u00e1r Guj\u00e1r Sinh Bhangi, a powerful Sikh chieftain, marched from Lahore against the last independent Ghakkar prince, Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n, whom he defeated outside the walls of Gujr\u00e1t. Mukarrab retired beyond the Jhelum, where he was soon treacherously murdered by his own tribesmen; but the traitors forthwith quarrelled over their spoil, and fell one by one before Sard\u00e1r Guj\u00e1r Sinh. The Sikhs ruled R\u00e1wal Pindi with their usual rapacity, exacting as revenue the last \u00e1nn\u00e1 that could be wrung from the proprietors, who were often glad to admit their tenants as joint-sharers, in order to lighten the incidence of the revenue. Guj\u00e1r Sinh held the District throughout his life, and left it on his death to his son, S\u00e1hib Sinh, who fell in 1810 before the power of the great Ranjit. Another Sikh Sard\u00e1r, Milka Sinh, fixed upon the site of R\u00e1wal Pindi, then occupied by an insignificant village, for his headquarters, and conquered the surrounding country on his own account. His estates were confirmed to his son by Ranjit Sinh, until his death in 1814, when they were annexed to the general territory of Lahore. The Murree (Marri) Hills long retained their independence under their Ghakkar chieftains; but in 1830, the Sikhs succeeded in reducing them after a bloody struggle, by which the population was almost decimated, and the country reduced to a desert.\n\nIn 1849, R\u00e1wal Pindi passed with the rest of the Sikh dominions under British rule; and though tranquillity was disturbed by an insurrection four years later, its administration was generally peaceful until the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857. The long anarchy and internecine strife of Sikh and Ghakkar could not be forgotten, especially in a wild and lonely region, where British organization extends with difficulty to\nthe remote gorges and scattered hamlets of a rocky labyrinth. The events of 1857 offered an outlet for the smouldering passions of ancestral feud, and the Murree (Marri) Hills became the scene of an attempted insurrection. The authorities received information from a faithful native of a projected attack upon the station in time to concert measures for defence. The ladies, who were present in large numbers, were placed in safety; the Europeans and police were drawn up in a cordon around the station; and when the enemy arrived, expecting no resistance, they met with a hot reception, which caused them to withdraw in disorder, and shortly after to disband themselves. The District has since experienced no serious commotion; but crimes of violence are frequent.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In a District so extensive and so rugged as R\u00e1wal Pindi, it is naturally difficult to conduct an enumeration of the people with minute accuracy, and there are grounds for doubting the correctness of all statistics prior to the Census of 1868. An enumeration in 1855 returned the total population as 553,750. In 1868, the total number was ascertained to be 711,256, showing an increase for the thirteen years of 157,506 persons, or 28 per cent. of the former population. Though the long period of peace and prosperity which R\u00e1wal Pindi has enjoyed since the British occupation would suffice to account for a large augmentation of numbers, it is probable that some part of this apparent increase must be set down to under-statement on the first occasion. The total area of the District is 6218 square miles, containing, in 1868, 1658 villages or townships, and 175,579 houses. From these figures the following averages may be obtained:\u2014Persons per square mile, 114; villages or townships per square mile, 0\u00b727; persons per village, 428; houses per square mile, 28\u00b724; persons per house, 4\u00b706. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 384,286; females, 326,970: proportion of males, 54\u00b703 per cent. These figures exhibit the usual preponderance of the stronger sex, which doubtless points to the former prevalence of female infanticide. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 144,346; females, 124,175; total children, 268,521, or 37\u00b775 per cent. of the population. In religion, R\u00e1wal Pindi is a stronghold of Muhammadanism, as many as 621,169, or 87\u00b733 per cent. of the inhabitants, being returned as adherents of Isl\u00e1m. The Hindus are scantily represented by 60,720 persons, or 8\u00b754 per cent. of the inhabitants; while the once dominant Sikhs number no more than 24,355 persons, yielding a meagre percentage of 3\u00b742. The remaining 5012 are returned as 'others.' As regards the ethnical divisions of the people, the Br\u00e1hmans of R\u00e1wal Pindi number 20,259 persons; but in this extreme northern corner, surrounded by an overwhelming Musalm\u00e1n element, and engaged in commerce or agriculture, the Br\u00e1hmans find little scope for\ntheir priestly character, and indulge in many practices which would greatly scandalize their stricter brethren in the south. Yet they are quite as minutely subdivided as elsewhere into minor clans, each of which has its acknowledged rank in the social scale, and refuses to eat or intermarry with the inferior classes. The Rajputs are the strongest body numerically, having a total of 105,741 souls: their customs, however, require no special notice, and they are almost exclusively Muhammadans in creed. The principal trading classes are the Kshatriyas or Khatris (42,716) and the Aroras (8912), both retaining the old Hindu faith, and with their co-religionists the Brahmins, monopolizing the commerce of the District. They replace the Banias of Hindustan proper, and are considered quite their equals in capacity and cunning. The Jats number 65,729, almost all Muhammadans, and keep up their usual reputation as careful and industrious agriculturists. In the eastern half of the District, they form the principal labouring population. The Ghakkars, whose history has been already detailed, now amount to only 10,153 persons. They are a fine and spirited race, gentlemen in ancestry and bearing, and clinging under all reverses to the traditions of noble blood. Though reduced to poverty in many cases by the Sikhs, they are still respected in the District as a native aristocracy, and would come to the front, for good or for evil, in any period of general disturbance. The other principal tribes are the Gujars (33,369), Pathans (29,115), Kashmiris (21,691), Sayyids (16,122), Dhunds (13,509), and Satis (11,498). The most ordinary social distinction is that of sahu or gentleman, and samindar or labourer: the Ghakkars, Rajputs, and Sayyids are considered as belonging to the former class; the Jats may be looked upon as typifying the latter. The native aristocracy are passionately addicted to sport, especially in the form of hawking. With reference to occupation, the Census returns give the following results:\u2014Agriculturists, 473,778; non-agriculturists, 237,478. There were only 3 towns in 1868 with a population exceeding 5000, namely\u2014RAWAL PINDI, 19,228; HAZRO, 7280; and PINDI GHAB, 8223; total 34,731 persons, or an urban population of only 48 per cent. The main body of the inhabitants are scattered in tiny hamlets over the face of the country. The station of Murree (Marri) has a permanent population of only 2346 souls; but during the height of the summer season, this is swelled by visitors to 12 or 13 thousand. Panjabi is the language in common use, though the educated classes understand Urdu. In Chach and Mokhad, Pushtu is spoken by the Pathan population.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple spring crop of the District is wheat, while bajra forms the mainstay of the autumn harvest. The inferior grains are now falling into disfavour, and their place has been taken by more valuable cereals, and by cotton and potatoes. The cultivation of tea has\nbeen introduced and sedulously fostered, but the results hitherto attained have not been encouraging. The area under the principal crops in 1871-72 was as follows:\u2014Wheat, 309,846 acres; gram, 14,508; barley, 56,233; oil-seeds, 59,904; jodr, 57,436; bajra, 177,913; cotton, 26,873; moth, 44,787; mung, 19,826. As almost every field in the District is more or less on an incline, the rain-water rapidly drains away, without benefiting the soil; and it has been necessary in most cases to retard its escape by a rude system of terraces, embanked at their lower extremity. A more ambitious work, requiring the co-operation of villages and expenditure of capital, is the embankment of ravines, which is practised to some extent both here and in the neighbouring District of Jhelum. Irrigation by any other mode is little employed. The best lands are sown for three consecutive harvests with wheat and bajra alternately, and lie fallow for the fourth; inferior soils bear two crops in the same year, and then recruit during the following twelve months. Rotation of crops in any higher form is unknown. The average produce per acre is given in the Government returns for 1871-72 as follows:\u2014Rice, 732 lbs.; cotton, 168 lbs.; wheat, 516 lbs.; inferior grains, 315 lbs.; oil-seeds, 342 lbs. The peasantry are in comfortable circumstances; their houses are neatly furnished and scrupulously clean, and they are rapidly extricating themselves from the clutches of the village money-lender. Under Sikh rule, it is calculated that 50 per cent. of the cultivators were in debt; at present, only 10 per cent. are believed to be so involved.\n\nThe tenures of the District are very varied, from the ancestral zamindari, or common undivided holding with division of profits, to the modern occupancy right of tenants who can show twelve years of uninterrupted cultivation. Rents vary according to the nature of the soil and the caste of the tenant. They are sometimes paid in grain, by fractions of the produce. Where cash rates prevail, they rule as follows:\u2014Rice lands, from 6s. to 14s. per acre; wheat lands, from 3s. to 6s.; oil-seed lands, from 2s. to 6s. Wages have increased from 50 to 75 per cent. since the Sikh rule. In towns they are paid in cash; but the agricultural labourer generally receives his wages in kind. Prices were returned as follows in January 1871:\u2014Wheat, 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.; jodr, 32 sers per rupee, or 3s. 6d. per cwt.; bajra, 26 sers per rupee, or 4s. 3\u00bdd. per cwt. These rates are considerably higher than those which ruled up to 1867.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In 1843-44, during the Sikh supremacy, Rawal Pindi was devastated by an incursion of locusts, which overran the whole country in enormous swarms, and for a while almost succeeded in depopulating the District. They appeared just in time to devour the whole autumn crop of 1843; they remained for the succeeding spring crops; and at last they took their departure after utterly destroying the autumn harvest of 1844. Rawal Pindi is still suffering from the\nremote effects of this terrible visitation. The Sikh authorities insisted upon realizing the utmost farthing of their revenue from the starving cultivators, who were obliged to have recourse to the trading classes; and so commenced a system of chronic indebtedness, which has not even yet entirely passed away. The tenures of land were completely revolutionized, to the great disadvantage of the proprietary class, as the Sikhs admitted tenants to share the burdens and privileges of the landowners, in order the more readily to collect their exorbitant imposts. The British courts are still flooded with litigation, arising from the disorganization of this unhappy period.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014So rugged a District as Rawal Pindi has naturally but little commerce, and that little is concentrated at the headquarters town and at Hazro. The imports comprise sugar, spices, cotton goods (European and native), and salt. The exports are confined to the raw materials of agriculture. The only manufacture of importance is that of cotton-weaving, which employed 13,078 looms in 1871-72; the annual out-turn is valued at 7 lakhs of rupees, or \u00a370,000. The wealth resulting from long and settled peace finds its way into the hands of the cultivating classes, and is chiefly hoarded in the form of jewellery. A great horse-fair is held annually at Rawal Pindi, at which Government prizes are distributed, and animals from all parts of the Punjab are exhibited and sold. The Grand Trunk Road is the principal means of communication, having just 100 miles of metalled line within the District. There are 28 miles of other metalled highway, and 1133 miles of unmetalled roads in Rawal Pindi. The Indus is navigable here throughout its whole course by native craft, and becomes practicable for steamers below Mokhad. Two telegraph lines traverse the District, namely, the main wire from Lahore to Peshawar, and a branch from Rawal Pindi to the summer station at Murree (Marri). The Punjab Northern State Railway will also run through the whole length of the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary administrative staff of this extensive District comprises a Deputy Commissioner, 3 Assistant and 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 Cantonment Magistrate, and 7 tahsildars, besides the ordinary medical and constabulary officers. There are military establishments at Rawal Pindi, Murree (Marri), Attock, and Campbellpur. The total revenue in 1872-73 amounted to \u00a389,226, of which sum \u00a368,659, or more than three-fourths of the whole, was due to the land tax. The other principal items were stamps, local rates, excise, and opium. In the same year the District contained 15 first-class and 7 second-class police stations, and the regular police numbered 801 men of all ranks, being 1 constable to every 887 inhabitants and to every 7.75 square miles. The total number of persons brought to trial in 1871, for all offences great or small, was 7911, or 1 in every 89 inhabitants.\nCrimes of violence are still unhappily common; human life is lightly regarded by the wild tribes of the western gorges, and the ancestral blood-feuds are only lulled for a while by the severity of English law. Murders prompted by conjugal jealousies are also of frequent occurrence. There is a Divisional jail at R\u00e1wal Pindi, the total number of prisoners in which was 2148 in 1872; but some of these were offenders from neighbouring Districts. The average daily strength was 1009. Education is making satisfactory progress. The total number of pupils on the rolls in 1873 was 10,382, and the expenditure from public funds amounted to \u00a34329. Female education, especially, has made rapid strides of late years, through the benevolent exertions of Bedi Khem Sinh, a native gentleman of Kall\u00e1r, who has established 32 girls' schools in this District, besides others in Jhelum (Jhflam); they are chiefly attended by Hindu children, though there is also a fair sprinkling of Muhammadans. The Lawrence Memorial Asylum at Murree (Marri) is devoted to the education of the children of European soldiers, and enjoys an income amounting in 1873 to \u00a33447. There is also a school for the benefit of residents at Murree (Marri) in the hot season, which is transferred to R\u00e1wal Pindi during the winter. The normal school for training teachers at the last-named town had 39 students in 1873. The District is subdivided into 7 tahsils, and 38 il\u00e1kas. There are municipalities at R\u00e1wal Pindi, Murree (Marri), Attock, and H\u00e1zo; but a municipal income is also realized at seven other towns or villages. The total revenue of these 11 places during the year 1871-72 amounted to \u00a38642, being at the rate of 2s. 6\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi has two rainy seasons, the first from January to March, and the second from July to August. During the winter, the weather is cold and even severe, but in summer the heat cannot be exceeded in any part of India. The climate of the Murree (Marri) Hills is said to be peculiarly adapted to the English constitution. The mean temperature in the shade at R\u00e1wal Pindi in 1871-72 is recorded as follows:\u2014May, 86\u00b05 F.; July, 89\u00b05; December, 54\u00b05. The maximum heat was 118\u00b02; and the minimum 28\u00b05. The total rainfall was 16\u00bd inches in 1867-68; 38\u00bd inches in 1868-69; 16\u00bd inches in 1869-70; 36\u00bd inches in 1870-71; and 32\u00bd inches in 1871-72. The principal disease of the District is fever, which exists in an endemic form. The total number of reported deaths from all causes was 18,192 in 1870; 16,104 in 1871; and 12,453 in 1872; or 26, 23, and 18 per thousand respectively. Of these deaths, as many as 14,758, 10,889, and 8221, or 21, 15, and 11 per thousand respectively, were assigned to fever alone. Cattle diseases are very prevalent, and carry off a large number of the live-stock.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014Tahsil of R\u00e1wal Pindi District Punjab, lying along the foot of the Murree (Marri) Hills.\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014Municipal city and administrative headquarters of R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab. Lat. 33\u00b0 37' N., long. 73\u00b0 6' E.; pop. (1868), 19,228, consisting of 6490 Hindus, 10,218 Muhammadans, 2197 Sikhs, 44 Christians, and 279 'others.' The present town is of quite modern origin, but General Cunningham has identified certain ruins on the site of the cantonments with the ancient city of Gajipur, the capital of the Bhatti tribe in the ages preceding the Christian era. Greek and other early coins, as well as broken bricks, occur over an area of 2 square miles. Known within historical times as Fatehpur Baori, it fell into decay during one of the Mughal invasions in the 14th century. Jhanda Kh\u00e1n, a Ghakkar chief, restored the town, and gave it the present name of R\u00e1wal Pindi. Sard\u00e1r Milka Sinh, a Sikh adventurer, occupied it in 1765, and invited traders from the neighbouring commercial centres of Jhelum and Sh\u00e1hpur to settle in his territory. Thenceforward R\u00e1wal Pindi grew rapidly, and, on the introduction of British rule, became the site of an important cantonment. The modern town is well built, and has an air of considerable prosperity, with broad and handsome streets, and many brick houses. The inhabitants consist of Ghakkars, Bhattis, Aw\u00e1ns, Kashmiris, Kshattriyas, and Br\u00e1hmans, the last two castes having a monopoly of trade. Court-houses, treasury, jail, police office, dispensary, 2 sar\u00e1\u00eds, tahs\u00edl, and numerous other public buildings.

Post office.\n\nRewah.\u2014The principal Native State in B\u00e1ghelkhand, under the political superintendence of the B\u00e1ghelkhand and Central India Agencies, lying between 22\u00b0 39' and 25\u00b0 12' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 46' and 82\u00b0 51' E. long. Estimated area, 13,000 square miles; estimated pop. 2,035,000. Bounded on the north by the British Districts of Banda, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by part of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District and by Native States in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; on the south by the British Districts of Chhatisgarh, Mandla, and Jubbulpore (Jabalpur), in the Central Provinces; and on the west by Maihar, Nagode, Soh\u00e1wal, and Kothi, Native States in B\u00e1ghelkhand.\n\nThe western and north-western portions of the State are occupied by mountains, rising in three successive plateaux, or vast terraces, from the valley of the Ganges. Of these, the one lying to the north-east, and styled by Franklin the 'Bindh\u00e1chal,' or First Range, is the lowest, having an average elevation of only 500 feet above the sea; it is formed of horizontal strata of sandstone, the upper surface presenting an expanse of very great sterility. Little of this plateau, however, is included within the limits of Rewah, the boundary of which on this side coincides nearly with the base of the second range, or Panna Hills. The elevation of these mountains is from 900 to 1200 feet above the sea. They consist of sandstone intermixed with schist and quartz, and, to the west, overlaid with limestone. Above this plateau, nearly parallel to the brow, but more to the south-east, rises the K\u00e1imur range. The Tons (south-eastern) and its tributaries, which drain the second plateau, descend to the lower levels in cascades, varying in height from that of Bilohi with 400 feet to that of Chach\u00e1i with 200. About a third of the country lying south-east of the K\u00e1imur Hills constitutes part of the basin of the S\u00f3n, a tract as yet almost unexplored. That great river, rising in the extreme south of Rewah, flows through the State in a north and north-easterly direction, crossing the north-eastern frontier into the District of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur. Its principal tributary is the Mah\u00e1nadi, joining it on the left side, in lat. 24\u00b0 5' N., and long. 81\u00b0 6' E. The\nTons, running north-east from Maihar, first touches the State in lat. $24^\\circ 25'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 55'$ E., and draining the highlands, receives the Beher, the Biland, and several minor torrents. It holds a course generally north-easterly, and passes in lat. $25^\\circ 1'$ N., and long. $81^\\circ 51'$ E., into the British District of Allahabad, its length in Rewah being 80 miles. None of the rivers is navigable.'\u2014Condensed from Thornton.\n\nThe State is rich in minerals and forest produce. The prevailing classes of soil are mair, sengawan, domat, and bhata. Mair is a black soil, which retains water and moisture well, and needs no irrigation. It produces valuable crops of wheat and other grain. Sengawan is a whitish clay, suitable for crops of any kind. Domat (literally two soils) is mair and sengawan mixed, and it produces the crops of both varieties. Bhata, red dry soil, is the worst class, producing only inferior crops. Tanks are, as a rule, seldom constructed for irrigation. Owing to the want of embankments, many miles of undulating and cultivable land lie untilled.\n\nAccording to the family history kept in the Court Records, it appears that the original founder of this principality was Bilagar Deo or Bi\u00e1g Deo (hence the name B\u00e1ghel), who, leaving his own country in Guzerat in 580 A.D., ostensibly on a religious pilgrimage, but in reality to seize whatever undefended territory he could, first made himself master of the fort of Murpha, and eventually of most of the country from K\u00e1lpi to Chandalgarh, and married the daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pirhaw\u00e1n. Bilagar Deo was succeeded by his son, Kurun Deo, in 615, who added to his possessions a large portion of what at present constitutes Rewah, and called it B\u00e1ghelkhand. He married the daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandla, and obtained in dower the famous fort of Bandogarh, to which he removed his court. The chiefship descended from father to son for many generations, with varying fortunes. In the time of Birbhan R\u00e1o, the 19th R\u00e1j\u00e1, who succeeded in 1601, the family of Hum\u00e1yun Sh\u00e1h, Emperor of Delhi, being forced by Sher Sh\u00e1h to flee from Delhi, found shelter in Rewah territory. In 1618, Vikram\u00e1ditya succeeded and made Rewah his capital, building the fort and town. Abd\u00fat Sinh, the 27th R\u00e1j\u00e1, was only six months old when his father died; and Hard\u00ed Sah, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of Panna, taking advantage of his infancy, invaded Rewah, and took possession of the capital. The young chief and his mother fled to Part\u00e1bgarh, and after a time, with the assistance of the Emperor of Delhi, expelled Hard\u00ed Sah. Abd\u00fat Sinh was succeeded by Ajit Sinh, and he in turn by J\u00e1i Sinh Deo, in 1809. It was during his rule that British influence was established in B\u00e1ghelkhand, and the first formal treaty between the British Government and Rewah was made with J\u00e1i Sinh Deo in 1812. In that year, a body of Pind\u00e1ri marauders invaded M\u00edrz\u00e1pur through Rewah State. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was believed to have abetted this enter-\nprise, was required to accede to a treaty by which he was acknowledged as ruler of his dominions, and was brought under the protection of the British Government, to whose arbitration he bound himself to refer all disputes with neighbouring chiefs, and engaged to allow British troops to march through, or be stationed in, his territories. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, however, failed to fulfil his obligations; and when a military post was established in his territory, he attempted to starve out the detachment. Troops were sent to enforce the execution of the engagements, and in June 1813 a second treaty was made confirming the first, and defining more clearly the relations of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 with the British Government. J\u00e1i Sinh Deo abdicated in favour of his son, Bishn\u00e1th Sinh, who was succeeded in 1834 by his son, Raghr\u00e1j Sinh, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, who was born in 1824. The ruling family are B\u00e1ghel R\u00e1jputs. In 1847, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 abolished sati throughout his dominions. For his services during the Mutiny of 1857, the tracts of Soh\u00e1gpur and Amarkantak were conferred in sovereignty on Raghr\u00e1j Sinh, who has also received the distinction of Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India. He holds a sanad of adoption, and is allowed a personal salute of 19 guns.\n\nThe population of Rewah was estimated in 1875 at 2,035,000 souls. The principal landholders are Br\u00e1hmans, Th\u00e1kurs, Kurmis, and Gonds, and the two latter are generally both proprietors and cultivators. Rent is generally paid in kind, and varies from one-sixth to one-tenth of the gross produce. The revenue of the State was estimated in 1875 at 25 lakhs of rupees (say \u00a3250,000), of which at least one-half is alienated in jagirs and other grants; but the actual income which reached the State treasury in that year was found to be only Rs. 720,159 (say \u00a372,015). The chief maintains a force of 900 cavalry, 12,600 infantry, 6 field and 50 other guns, and 100 artillerymen.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at Rewah for the three years ending 1875-76 was 59 inches.\n\nRewah.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in B\u00e1ghelkhand, Central India. Lat. 24\u00b0 31' 30\" N., long. 81\u00b0 20' E.; 131 miles southwest of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 182 north-east of S\u00e1gar.

The soil is naturally sandy; but the\nindustry of the Ahir inhabitants, and the copious well irrigation, have turned it into a singularly prosperous and fruitful country. Numerous streams flow through it from the Jaipur Hills.\n\nRewari.\u2014Municipal town in Gurgaon District, Punjab, and headquarters of the tahsil. Lat. 28\u00b0 12' N., long. 70\u00b0 40' E.; pop. (1868), 24,503. Rewari is situated on the Delhi and Jaipur (Jeypore) road, 34 miles south-east of Gurgaon town. Ancient town, owing its present commercial importance to British rule. The d\u00e9bris of an earlier city covers a site known as Budhi Rewari, east of the modern walls. Local tradition attributes its foundation to Raja Karm Pal, of unknown date. Even the present town has considerable antiquity, having been founded about 1000 A.D. by Raja Rawath. The native Rajas seem to have maintained a partial independence under the Mughal Empire, renting their pargana at a fixed revenue. They also built the fort of Gokalgarh, near the town, now in ruins, but exhibiting marks of great strength. They coined their own money, one of the most cherished prerogatives of independent sovereignty in India, and their currency bore the name of Gokal Sikka. On the collapse of the Mughal Empire, Rewari fell first to the Marhattas and afterwards to the Jat Rajas of Bhartpur, who retained it till the cession of the Delhi territory in 1803. In 1805, the pargana was brought under direct British rule, and the town became for some time the headquarters of a District. A military cantonment was established near the civil station. The security of British rule attracted large numbers of traders from the neighbouring Native States, for which Rewari now forms a central emporium. Imports of iron from Ulwur (Alwar), employed in the manufactures of the town, and exported to Bhawani, to the Punjab generally, and to the North-Western Provinces; of ghi, oil, ginger, and cloth from Bhawani; of molasses, rice, and sugar from the south for exportation to Ulwur; and of salt from the Sambhar Lake, which, with iron, forms the chief return trade to the North-Western Provinces. Manufacture of hardware, made of mixed metal, and valued at \u00a320,000 per annum. Handsome town hall; new city gates; Government offices; police station; school-house; dispensary. The surplus revenues of the municipality are devoted to improving and embellishing the town. Municipal income in 1875-76, \u00a32903, or 2s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population (25,237) within municipal limits. The fort of Gokalgarh, in the vicinity of the town, was built by the native Rajas during Mughal times. Though now in ruins, it was of considerable strength.\n\nRewas.\u2014Port in the Alibagh Subdivision of Kolaba District, Bombay.

Thornton states that the fort crowns a conical rock, south of the town, and consists of a rectangular enclosure, whose lofty stone walls rose sheer from the steeply escarped sides of the hills, with a bomb-proof tower at each angle. Two large tanks supply the garrison with water. A deep ravine separates the fort from a sandstone eminence of equal height, about a mile distant.\n\nRidhpur.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar.\u2014See R\u00edtpur.\n\nRikheswar.\u2014Cantonment in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces. See Lohaghat.\n\nRintimb\u00far.\u2014Fort in J\u00e1ipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 26\u00b0 2' N., long. 76\u00b0 30' E.; situated on an isolated rock, the summit of which is surrounded by a massive stone wall, strengthened by towers and bastions. Within the enclosure, says Thornton, are an ancient palace, the residence of the Governor; a mosque, with the tomb of a reputed Muhammadan saint; and barracks for the garrison. East of the fortress is the town, connected with it by a long flight of steps. Rintimb\u00far was besieged without success in 1291 by Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, the Khilji King of Delhi; in 1299, by the Waz\u00edr of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; and shortly afterwards captured by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, who put the garrison, with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his family, to the sword. The fort was subsequently wrested from the sovereign of Delhi; and in 1516, is mentioned as belonging to M\u00e1lw\u00e1. After the expulsion of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h from Delhi by Hum\u00e1y\u00fan in 1553, it surrendered to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bund\u00ed, who transferred it later on to Akbar. It probably fell into the hands of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00e1ipur on the decay of the Empire, in the middle of the 17th century.\n\nRioti.\u2014Town in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 7700. Stands on an upland plain, 6 miles south of the Gogra, and 16 miles north-east of Ballia. Agricultural centre.\n\nRiotipur.\u2014Town in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 25\u00b0 50' 15\" N., long. 84\u00b0 25' E.; pop. (1872), 9323. Lies on the alluvial lowlands, 1 mile south of the southern branch of the Ganges, and 8 miles east of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur town.\n\nR\u00edpu.\u2014One of the Dw\u00e1rs or lowland tracts forming the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs Subdivision of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, Assam. Area, 242 square miles; pop. (1870), 2645; forest area, 65\u00b705 square miles; area under cultivation, 3\u00b742 square miles. In 1870, the land was settled with the cultivators direct for a term of seven years.\n\nRishikund.\u2014Hot spring in Monghyr District, Bengal. It has been made a place of worship; and a reservoir has been built to collect the water into one pool, which is about 140 feet square, and, on the side most remote from the sources, overgrown with aquatic plants. The\nbottom of the pool is partly sandy, partly rocky; and the air-bubbles rise from the surface over a space of about 30 feet wide and 140 feet long. Where the air-bubbles issue from among sand, they form a small cavity like a crater. When Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton visited this spring he found, in the month of April, that the thermometer in the air stood at $72^\\circ$ F.; in the water where it issued from the crevice of a rock, it rose to $110^\\circ$; and in one of the craters, to $114^\\circ$. A fair is held at Rishikund once in three years. It is of no great importance, there being seldom more than 2000 people present.\n\n**Risod.**\u2014Chief town of a *pargan\u00e1* in Bas\u00edm District, Berar; originally known as *Rishi-wut-kshetr*, or \u2018The place of all the Rishis.\u2019 Lat. $19^\\circ 58' 30''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 51'$ E.; pop. (1867), 4716. Place of some commercial activity. In 1858-59, a plundering party of Rohill\u00e1s, being brought to bay by a detachment of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) Contingent at the walled village of Chichamba, near Risod, resisted an infantry attack. This was the last fight of the kind in Berar.\n\n**Ritpur.**\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar; 20 miles east of Ellichpur town. Lat. $21^\\circ 14'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 52'$ E.; pop. (1867), 2450. Once a place of importance, having been the *tankha j\u00e1gir* of Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n. The stone wall which surrounded the town fifty years ago has almost entirely disappeared. It is said to have then had 12,000 inhabitants, many of whom deserted it owing to the oppression of Bisenchand *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r* in the time of N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n. Ritpur is the chief seat of the sect known as M\u00e1nbh\u00e1n, founded by Kishen Bhat about two hundred years ago. He married out of his caste, and his four sons formed a new order, into which any person might enter. Its members are professed celibates, but this rule is by no means rigidly observed. Both men and women shave all hair from the head, and wear a black waistcloth, forming a kind of skirt, to show that, having devoted themselves to religion, they in their worldly conduct no longer recognise any distinction as to sex. They bury their dead. Krishna Bhat, the founder of this sect, is said to have obtained a magic cap, by wearing which he assumed the likeness of Krishna. This cap was at last forcibly taken from him, and burnt. The principal buildings of interest are R\u00e1mchandra\u2019s temple, the M\u00e1nbh\u00e1n building, called R\u00e1j Math, and the Government school. Good water is scarce at Ritpur, the people obtaining their drinking water from Lal\u00e1\u2019s well.\n\n**Rewari.**\u2014Tahsil and town in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab.\u2014See Rewari.\n\n**Robartsganj.**\u2014Southern tahsil of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of the Son valley, with the Singrauli plateau, and comprising the most varied and picturesque scenery in the District. Area, 2632 square miles, of which 1973 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 173,540; land revenue, \u00a36820; total Government revenue, \u00a37368; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a322,837.\nRohilkhand.\u2014A Division or Commissionership in the North-Western Provinces, comprising the six Districts of Bijnaur (Bijnor), Moradabad, Budaun, Bareli (Bareilly), Shahjahanpur, and the Tarai, each of which see separately; the Division being, according to the arrangement of this work, dealt with under the Districts. Area of Rohilkhand Division, 11,805 square miles; pop. (1872), 5,436,314. Lat. 27\u00b0 35' to 30\u00b0 1' N., long. 78\u00b0 1' to 80\u00b0 26' E.\u2014For the history of Rohilkhand, the country of the Rohill\u00e1 Afgh\u00e1ns, see Bareli (Bareilly) and Moradabad Districts.\n\nRohisala.\u2014One of the petty States of Unds\u00e1rviya, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay. It consists of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3310; tribute of \u00a310 is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\nRohna.\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 20\u00b0 32' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 25' E.; 23 miles west by north of Wardh\u00e1 town. Pop. (1870), 2565, chiefly cultivators. The stream by the town has been embanked to avert floods, and a well-attended market is held every Tuesday in the dry bed and on the bank. A considerable fair also takes place yearly at the end of January. The fort was built about a century ago by Krishnaji Sindhia, who held the town rent free from the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bhonsl\u00e1 Governments, in consideration of maintaining 200 horsemen. Rohna has a village school, and in the neighbourhood are gardens of opium, sugar-cane, and spices.\n\nRohri (or, as written by the natives, Lohri).\u2014A Sub-District forming part of Shik\u00e1rpur Collectorate, Sind, lying between 27\u00b0 7' and 28\u00b0 32' N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 52' and 70\u00b0 15' E. long. Area, 4258 square miles; population (1872), 217,515 souls. Bounded on the north and west by the Indus, on the north-east and east by the States of Bah\u00e1walpur and J\u00e1salm\u00edr (Jeysulmere), and on the south by Khairpur. Headquarters at Rohri Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Sub-District consists mainly of a desert known as the Reg\u00edst\u00e1n, constituting a portion of the vast plain of Shik\u00e1rpur. It is broken by sandhills, which are often bold in outline, and fairly wooded. A small limestone range in the south-west of the Sub-District runs from near Rohri town due north and south into Khairpur. The Indus is supposed to have once flowed past these hills near the ancient town of Aror, and to have been diverted into its present channel through the Bakhar Hills by some great natural convulsion. The Ren N\u00e1l\u00e1, said to be the bed of an old branch of the Indus, is found in the Reg\u00edst\u00e1n. The principal canals in Rohri are\u2014the Eastern Nara, 13 miles long and 156 feet wide at its mouth, with strong sluice-gates, but in its course towards the south cut up into numerous small streams, and abounding in quagmires and quicksands: the L\u00fandi, 16 miles long; Aror, 16 miles; Dahr, 26 miles; Mas\u00fa, 32\nmiles; Kor\u00e1\u00ed, 23 miles; Mah\u00e1ro, 37 miles; Dengro, 16 miles. There are 57 zamind\u00e1ri canals, offshoots of the Government works. The dandhs are\u2014the Dahri, 20 miles long; the Garwar, 10 miles; the Kadirpur, 12 miles; the Changhan, 20 miles. The forests of Rohri cover an area of 90 square miles; the most important trees are the pipal, nim, ber, siras, tali, bahan, and kandi. The bush jungle consists for the most part of tamarisk. Game is abundant.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The total population of Rohri Sub-District in 1872 was returned at 217,515, of whom 176,789 were Muhammadans, 37,917 Hindus, 1853 Bhils, 134 Sikhs, and 822 \u2018others.\u2019 The number of persons per square mile is 51. The inhabitants of the Reg\u00edst\u00e1n are a strong, active, and temperate race. The chief towns are Rohri and Ghotki. Eight fairs are held in the Sub-District, 5 in the Rohri, and 3 in the Ghotki taluk, with an attendance varying from 400 to 20,000 people. The towns of Rohri, Ghotki, Mirpur, and Ubauro contain travellers\u2019 bungalows. The principal antiquities are the ruined town and fort of Aror, and the old stronghold of Mathelo, which is situated on rising ground about 45 miles north-east of Rohri, and is said to have been founded by a Rajput about 1400 years ago. About 2\u00bd miles from Rohri are the ruins of an ancient town called Hakrah, built on the extremity of a rocky hill, which appears to have been gradually covered by the mud from the flood-waters of the Indus, that even now flow over the spot.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Two crops are raised in Rohri, viz.\u2014the khartf, sown between March and July, and reaped between July and December, which includes cotton, jo\u00e1r, bajra, indigo, rice, oil-seeds, vegetables, etc.; and the rab\u00ed, sown between November and March, and reaped in March and April, comprising wheat, gram, dhaniya (coriander), tobacco, and barley. Jo\u00e1r and bajra form the staple articles of food. Of the total area of the Sub-District, in 1872, 194,824 acres were under cultivation. Fruits and vegetables are extensively grown. Irrigation is carried on by means of canals, which have already been enumerated. The floods, or l\u00fats, as they are called, during the inundation of the Indus are also a source of fertility; but when excessive, they cause great destruction to land and crops. Protective embankments have been erected in several villages. The fiscal settlement of the Sub-District was begun in 1856-57, but not completed till 1871-72. The average rate per acre assessed on cultivable land is R. 1. 12. (or 3s. 6d.) in the Rohri and Mirpur taluks, Rs. 2. 4. (or 4s. 6d.) in both Saidpur and Ubauro, and Rs. 2. 10. (or 3s. 3d.) in Ghotki. The principal tenure is the maurusi, by which the tenants possess a right of occupancy. The zamind\u00e1ri system also prevails to some extent. Land is held in j\u00e1gir in every taluk, but the largest area is found in that of Rohri, viz. 31,000 acres. In connection with the j\u00e1girs must be mentioned the\nROHRI SUB-DISTRICT.\n\nSayyids of Bakhar and Rohri, who have held lands in gift in this Sub-District from about 1290 A.D. Grants of land were also made to them in 1712, by Jah\u00e1ndar Sh\u00e1h. The conditions on which the Sayyids held their territory seem to have been (1) to pray for their imperial masters, and (2) to guard the country from marauders. The privileges of the Sayyids were confirmed by the Kalhora sovereigns, but Mfr Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lpur altered their land assessments and remissions into a fourth share of the revenue alienated to the grantees. Since 1854, no changes have been made in the general condition of the Sayyids, who in 1872 numbered about twelve persons.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014Pottery, coarse cloth, lime, salt, and saltpetre are the chief manufactures of the Sub-District. The annual quantity of lime made is estimated at 100,000 maunds, or about 3660 tons. The annual out-turn of saltpetre at Aror is 1300 maunds, or about 47 tons. The towns of Ghotki and Khairpur Dharki are noted for their manufacture of pipe-bowls, scissors, and cooking-pots. The most important exports from Rohri are grain, fuller's earth, salt, lime, oil, wool, fruits, silk cloth, and indigo. The imports are wheat, sugar, tobacco, ghi, metals, cotton cloth, and shoes. The Sub-District also carries on a considerable transit trade in grain, sugar, molasses, wool, wine, iron bars and pots, and cotton. The total length of roads is 400 miles. The main trunk road is that which connects Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d with M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan). There are 21 ferries in Rohri Sub-District, of which 13 are on the Indus and 8 on the N\u00e1r\u00e1. The main postal line runs from Rohri and Ubauro to Sabzalkot in Bah\u00e1walpur and thence to M\u00falt\u00e1n, 204 miles distant.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The imperial revenue in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a337,966, of which \u00a333,827 was derived from the land tax, \u00a3929 from excise, \u00a31092 from stamps, \u00a3481 from salt, \u00a3325 from fines and fees, and \u00a3593 from miscellaneous sources. The local revenue was \u00a33915, furnished by cesses on land and sayer revenue, fisheries, cattle pound and ferry funds. The gross revenue was therefore \u00a341,881. There is no special civil officer in the Sub-District, but the civil jurisdiction of the subordinate court of Sukkur extends over the 5 taluks of Rohri. The Sub-District is administered by a Deputy Collector with full magisterial powers. The total number of police is 270, or 1 policeman to every 806 of the population. In 1873-74, there were 28 Government schools, with 1491 pupils. There is one school for girls, viz. at Rohri town. The Sub-District contains two municipalities, Rohri and Ghotki; their aggregate receipts in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a31781, and their expenditure to \u00a31434.\n\nClimate.\u2014The transition from the hot to the cold season is very sudden in Rohri. The rainfall registered in 1874 was 14.62 inches. The prevalent diseases are fevers, ague, rheumatism, and dysentery.\nRohri.\u2014Town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 42'$ N., and long. $68^\\circ 56'$ E., upon the right bank of the Indus, on a rocky eminence of limestone interspersed with flints. It is said to have been founded by Sayyid Rukandin Sh\u00e1h in 1297. The rocky site of Rohri is terminated abruptly on the western side by a precipice 40 feet high, rising from the bank of the river, which during the inundation season attains a height of about 16 feet above its lowest level. On the northern side of the town is the mouth of the Nara (Eastern) channel (q.v.), 156 feet wide, which is provided with powerful sluice-gates to regulate the supply of water, as required, from the Indus. Rohri, when seen from a little distance, has a striking and pleasing appearance, the houses being lofty, frequently four and five storeys high, with flat roofs surrounded by balustrades; some are of burnt brick, erected many years ago by wealthy merchants belonging to the place. But the streets are in several parts very narrow, and the air close and unwholesome. Rohri has road communication with M\u00edrpur, Kand\u00e1r, and Sangr\u00e1r, and the main trunk road from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to M\u00falt\u00e1n also passes through it. The chief public buildings of the place are the mukht\u00ed\u00e1rk\u00e1r's court, municipal commissioner's office, dispensary, police station, travellers' rest-house, Government schools, post office, and cattle pound. The police force for the protection of the town numbers 31 men, of whom 23 are foot, rural and District police, and the remainder mounted on either horses or camels. Rohri has a large number of Muhammadan places of worship. One, known as the Jam\u00e1 Masj\u00edd, was built in 1564 by Fateh Kh\u00e1n, a lieutenant of the Emperor Akbar; it is a massive but gloomy pile of red brick, covered with three domes, and coated with glazed porcelain tiles. The other, the Idgah Masj\u00edd, was erected in 1593 by M\u00edr Musan Sh\u00e1h. The War Mub\u00e1rak, a building about 25 feet square, situated to the north of the town, was erected about 1545 by M\u00edr Mu\u1e25ammad, the reigning Kalhora prince, for the reception of a hair from the beard of Mu\u1e25ammad. This hair, to which miraculous properties are ascribed by the faithful, is set in amber, which again is enclosed in a gold case studded with rubies and emeralds, the gift of M\u00edr Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d of Khairpur. The relic is exposed to view every March, when the hair is made by some mechanical process to rise and fall, a fact which the devotees are led to believe proceeds from supernatural agency. Rohri possesses a municipality, established in 1855, and the town has, in consequence, been greatly improved both as regards health and appearance. The population, according to the Census of 1872, was found to be 8580, of whom 4766 were Hindus, and the remainder Musalm\u00e1ns. The former, who are mostly of the Bania caste, are engaged in trade, banking and money-brokering, while the Muhammadans are chiefly of the K\u00e1zi, Sayyid, Bhuta, Kori, Patoli, Muh\u00e1na, Khati, Memon, Shaikh,\nand Shik\u00e1ri tribes. The trade is principally in grain, oil, ghi, salt, fuller's earth, lime, and fruits. Tasar silk is manufactured, as well as gold and silver bracelets, and other ornaments. Paper of an indifferent quality is also made here, but, as a whole, the manufactures are unimportant. Opposite to Rohri on the Indus is the small island of Khw\u00e1ja Khizr, containing the shrine of a saint who is reverenced alike by Muhammadans and Hindus.\n\nRohtak.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between $28^\\circ 19'$ and $29^\\circ 17'$ N. lat., and between $76^\\circ 17'$ and $77^\\circ 30'$ E. long. Area (1868), 1823 square miles, but according to the Parliamentary Abstract (1878), 1811 square miles; population in 1868, 536,959. Rohtak is a District of the Hiss\u00e1r Division. It is bounded on the north by Karn\u00e1l, on the east by the Native State of Duj\u00e1na and by Delhi District, on the south by Gurg\u00e1on, and on the west by Hiss\u00e1r and the Native State of Jind (Jh\u00ednd). The administrative headquarters are at the town of Rohtak, on the main road from Delhi to Hiss\u00e1r.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Rohtak lies in the midst of the level table-land separating the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and Sutlej (Satlaj) valleys, and is one of the few Punjab Districts which nowhere abuts on any one of the great rivers. Its surface is one unbroken plain, consisting of a hard clay, copiously interspersed with light yellow sand, and covered in its wild state by a jungle of scrubby brushwood. Towards the south-west, the proportion of sand increases as the plain approaches the confines of the desert; but in the remainder of the District, cultivation has probably reached its utmost limit. Eastward, the land falls gradually towards the Delhi frontier, becoming low and swampy in the neighbourhood of the Najafgarh jhil, a marshy lake which forms the only natural reservoir for the drainage of the District. The jhil itself lies within the boundaries of Delhi, but the Sahibi, a little ndla flowing from the Ajmere (Ajm\u00edr) Hills, traverses a corner of Rohtak, and is the solitary stream of which the District can boast. During the rainy season, it throws off numerous smaller water-courses, which irrigate and occasionally flood the surrounding country. The Rohtak and But\u00e1na branches of the Western Jumna Canal supply water to the northern pargands, but the greater portion of the central plain is entirely dependent upon the uncertain rainfall. So absolutely level is the surface, that rain sinks in as it falls; and it is only by artificial means that the water can be enticed into the tanks which have been rudely excavated in the neighbourhood of every village. Their origin is of immemorial antiquity, and their pleasant fringe of trees and brushwood forms a characteristic feature in the otherwise monotonous landscape. The only exception to the general flatness is to be found on a part of the Gurg\u00e1on boundary, where a few low slaty\nhills crop up above the barren and sandy levels of the south-western angle. Game is plentiful, including wild pig, deer, and hare. Pea-fowl, partridge, and small birds are to be met with throughout the year; and during the cold season, wild geese, bustards, and flamingoes swell the list. Wolves are still common, and a stray leopard is occasionally killed.\n\n**History.**\u2014Rohtak was formerly included within the undefined boundaries of the region which bore the name of Hari\u00e1na. The town of Mah\u00edm appears to have been its most important centre in early years, and is said to have been destroyed by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, but restored in 1266. Little can be ascertained, however, with reference to its annals before the year 1718, when the whole of Hari\u00e1na was granted by the Emperor Farrukhsiy\u00e1r to his minister, Rukhan-ud-daul\u00e1. The courtier made over his title in turn to a Baluch noble, Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, who was created Naw\u00e1b of Farrukhnagar in 1732. The Naw\u00e1b's dominions embraced the present Districts of Hiss\u00e1r and Rohtak, besides part of Gurg\u00e1o and a considerable region since annexed by the S\u00edkh chieftains of J\u00ednd and Pati\u00e1la. Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n handed down his possessions to his son, who held them with varying fortunes till his death in 1760. That date coincides with the final collapse of the decaying empire, being the year in which Alamg\u00edr was murdered, and the titular Emperor Sh\u00e1h Alam ascended the throne of Delhi. His rule hardly extended beyond the city walls, and a period of anarchy set in. The next year saw the crushing defeat of the Marhatt\u00e1s at P\u00e1n\u00edpat, after which the S\u00edkh adventurers began to change their policy from mere predatory incursions to conquest and settlement. The new Naw\u00e1b of Farrukhnagar found his title from the first purely nominal; and in 1762, he was driven from his capital by the J\u00e1t leader, Jaw\u00e1har Sinh of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore). For the next twenty years, Hari\u00e1na passed through the usual vicissitudes of Upper India in this anarchic time: now the Naw\u00e1b recovered for a time his hereditary dominions; now Najaf Kh\u00e1n bestowed them on one of his followers; and now again the husband of Begam Sumru of Sardh\u00e1na (Walter Reinhardt) held part of them in fief. The Marhatt\u00e1s in 1785 put a stop for a while to these disorders; but even Sindhia was not able to repel the S\u00edkh invasions, and in the end he was compelled to settle large portions of Hari\u00e1na on the S\u00edkh rulers of Kaithal and J\u00ednd. Meanwhile, the military adventurer George Thomas had carved out a principality for himself from the remainder, and fortified his position in two strongholds at Georgegarh near Jhajjar, and H\u00e1nsi in the District of Hiss\u00e1r. In 1802, the Marhatt\u00e1s, under their French generals, succeeded in ousting Thomas; but the conquests of Lord Lake, a year later, laid the whole country, up to the Sulej and the Siw\u00e1liks, at the feet of the British Government. In fact, however, the supremacy of the Marhatt\u00e1s west of the Jumna, in its upper course, had been little more than nominal; and some\ntime elapsed before any practical measures were taken in the cis-Sutlej and Hari\u00e1na regions. The northern parg\u00e1ns of Rohtak were held by the Sikh chiefs of Jind and Kaithal, while the south was claimed by the Path\u00e1n Naw\u00e1b of Jhajjar. All these petty princes were confirmed in their holdings, and only the central portion of the modern District was directly retained by the British Government. This was for a while entrusted to the native Governors (N\u00e1zims) of Hari\u00e1na; but the frequent incursions of Sikh and Bhatti marauders compelled the despatch of an English officer in 1810, to bring the region into better organization. The few parg\u00e1ns thus subjected to British rule formed the nucleus of the present District. Other fringes of territory became escheated on the deaths of the Kaithal R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1818, and the chieftain of Jind in 1820. In the last-named year, Hiss\u00e1r and Sirsa were separated from Rohtak; and in 1824, the District of P\u00e1n\u00edpat (now Karn\u00e1l) was erected into a separate charge. Up to the year 1832, Rohtak was administered by a Political Agent under the Resident at Delhi; but it was then brought under the General Regulations, and annexed to the North-Western Provinces. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857, Rohtak was for a time completely lost to the British Government. The Muhammadan tribes united with their brethren in Gurgaon and Hiss\u00e1r, and began a wild predatory movement under the Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukhnagar, Jhajjar, and Bah\u00e1dargarh, and the Bhatti chieftains of Sirsa and Hiss\u00e1r. They attacked and plundered the civil station at Rohtak, destroying every record of administration. But before the fall of Delhi, a force of Punjab levies was brought across the Sutlej, and order was restored with little difficulty. The rebel Naw\u00e1bs of Jhajjar and Bah\u00e1dargarh were captured and tried. The former was executed at Delhi, while his neighbour and relative escaped with a sentence of exile to Lahore. Their estates were confiscated, part of them being temporarily erected into a new District of Jhajjar, while other portions were assigned to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jind, Pati\u00e1la, and N\u00e1bha, as rewards for their services during the Mutiny. Rohtak District was transferred to the Punjab Government; and in 1860, Jhajjar was broken up, part of it being added to the territory of the loyal R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and the remainder united with Rohtak.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The territorial changes which followed so fast during the middle of the present century, make it impossible to give any accurate comparative statement of the population at different periods; but by adding and subtracting the official returns for the various fluctuating parg\u00e1ns at either date, I find an increase on the constant portion, between 1846 and 1868, amounting to 61 per cent. So great an advance in little more than twenty years is scarcely credible; yet we must allow a very rapid rate of growth, as the more accurate figures of the enumerations taken in 1853 and 1868 show an increase of 20 per\ncent. in fifteen years, which may be accepted as approximately correct. The only Census, however, which gives the actual number of inhabitants in the District as at present constituted is that of 1868, which disclosed a total population of 536,959 persons, inhabiting 504 villages or townships and 138,717 houses, spread over an area of 1823.21 square miles. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 294; villages per square mile, 0.28; houses per square mile, 76.08; persons per village, 1065; persons per house, 3.87. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 292,389; females, 244,570: proportion of males in total population, 54.45 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 99,440; females, 82,733; total children, 182,173, or 33.92 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, Rohtak is essentially a Hindu District, as many as 456,229 persons, or 84.97 per cent., being adherents of the ancestral faith. The Muhammadans here sink to 71,118 persons, or 13.24 per cent. Only 257 Sikhs are recorded, belonging chiefly to the ruling families. The residue of 9355 are returned as \u2018others,\u2019 the vast majority of them being Jains, who are more numerous in Rohtak than in any other District of the Punjab; they yield in the aggregate a proportion of 1.74 per cent. As regards ethnical distinctions, the Br\u00e1hmans number 55,206 persons, most of whom are engaged in agriculture, an occupation which they follow with much indolence and thriftlessness. The R\u00e1jputs amount to 7212 Hindus and 17,302 Musalm\u00e1ns. Like their neighbours, the Bhattis of Hiss\u00e1r and Sirsa, they still retain somewhat of the cattle-lifting reputation which they earned during the long anarchy of the Sikh and Marhatt\u00e1 struggle. The trading classes are represented by 30,831 Banias, a large number of whom profess the Jain creed. The majority of the people belong to the inferior castes, amongst which the J\u00e1ts rank by far the first, forming more than one-third of the whole population. They are returned at 186,046 Hindus, and 1458 converted to Isl\u00e1m. The J\u00e1ts keep up their usual reputation for painstaking agriculture; they are divided into two principal clans, which entertain towards one another a singular animosity. There is also a considerable sprinkling of Gujars (2909), Path\u00e1ns (5521), and Baluchis (2225). The District is noticeable for the very small number of minor villages, and the large proportion of towns with a population exceeding 5000. In 1868, there were 13 so returned\u2014namely, Rohtak (14,153), Jhajjar (12,617), Beri (9723), Majra (7908), Bahadurgarh (7259), Gohana (7124), Mahim (6768), Butana (6197), Kalanaur (5646), Baroda (5124), Sanghi (5117), Mandlana (5109), and Sisrana (5051). These figures show a total of 97,796 persons, or 18.21 per cent. of the inhabitants; but they cannot be considered to represent the urban as opposed to the rural popula-\ntion, since many of the above-named places are rather overgrown villages than towns strictly so called. As there were also 152 villages containing a population of more than 1000, the tendency for the agricultural body to aggregate in considerable clusters is very marked, and may perhaps be set down to the general insecurity of the country during the century which preceded the British occupation. In 1868, 290,184 persons were returned as engaged in agriculture, and 246,775 as otherwise employed. Urdu and Hindi are the languages in common use.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Almost all the available land in the District is already under cultivation, the returns in 1869 showing a total of 905,600 acres of tillage, with a narrow margin of 139,942 acres of cultivable waste. In the central and southern parganas, where the peasant is entirely dependent upon the rainfall for his water supply, barley and gram form the staple spring crops, while jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, and cotton are the mainstays of the autumn harvest; but in the canal-irrigated villages to the north and east, wheat is added to the list in spring, and rice or sugar-cane in autumn. The total area under each crop in 1872-73 was as follows:\u2014Rabi\u2014wheat, 126,252 acres; barley, 112,241 acres; gram, 122,057 acres; Khartf\u2014jo\u00e1r, 251,231 acres; b\u00e1jra, 216,995 acres; cotton, 49,412 acres; and sugar-cane, 10,927 acres. Irrigation is chiefly confined to the canal system, the depth of water below the surface being generally too great to permit the profitable working of wells. The total area irrigated in 1868-69 amounted to 146,993 acres, of which 122,038 were supplied from Government works and 24,955 from private sources. The use of manure is on the increase, and the villagers are beginning to appreciate the value of a rotation of crops. Yet the District authorities are of opinion that cultivation has almost reached its highest point, and the land is reported to be in a condition of gradual impoverishment. The growth of cotton and hemp is increasing; and in the central parganas, rice is pushing b\u00e1jra out of the field. The average out-turn per acre is as follows:\u2014Wheat, 905 lbs.; inferior grains, 400 lbs.; cotton, 126 lbs.; rice, 583 lbs. The mode of tenure known as bh\u00e1ydch\u00e1ra, or brotherhood, is the most common. In parts of the District, several villages are banded together by custom into an organized cluster (or tappa), owning the supremacy of one chief (or tappad\u00e1ri) village. The tappa includes all the communities immediately surrounding the central and supreme village, without distinction of race or caste; and the league is thus in all probability a relic of some defensive arrangement, concerted during the period of Sikh and Bhatti incursions. In many villages, local custom subjects the non-cultivating classes to a tax (called kamini) in favour of the proprietors. By far the greater part of the soil is cultivated by tenants-at-will. Rents rule as follows, according to the nature of the crop which the soil is fitted to\nproduce:\u2014Cotton lands, from 6s. to \u00a31 per acre; sugar-cane lands, from 8s. 9d. to \u00a32 per acre; wheat lands, irrigated, from 4s. to \u00a31; dry, from 2s. to 10s. per acre; other grains, dry land, from 1s. to 6s. per acre.\n\nWages have risen of late years, the change being attributed to the emigration of labourers (principally Cham\u00e1rs), to find employment on the railway and the Sirhind Canal. Skilled workmen in towns are paid at the rate of 7\u00bdd. per diem, and unskilled workmen receive from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. Agricultural labourers are generally paid in cash; as much as 4\u00bdd. per diem, with food, is sometimes given at harvest-time. In canal villages, labourers take their wages in kind, receiving one-third of the crop. Prices of food grains ruled as follows in 1873:\u2014Wheat, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; gram, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; j\u00f3r, 33 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4\u00bdd. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 29 sers per rupee, or 3s. 10\u00bdd. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Rohtak, like its neighbour Hiss\u00e1r, suffers greatly from drought. Two-thirds of its area is entirely dependent on the rainfall, and scarcity from this cause pressed upon the District in 1824, 1830, 1832, and 1837. The severe famine of 1860-61 taxed the people to their utmost endurance; and the season of 1868-69 was one of the most disastrous on record. Two successive crops, both of grain and fodder, had failed in the dry southern plain, and distress began to show itself early in 1868. Relief measures were at once adopted, and the total number of persons who received gratuitous assistance during the month of January 1869 amounted to 150,102. Famine works were also undertaken, and continued until August. Fears were at one time entertained for the succeeding autumn and spring harvests, but rain happily fell in time to save the District from such an aggravation of its misfortunes. The loss of cattle added to the misfortunes of the cultivating classes. Out of 350,100 head in the District, as many as 88,300, or more than 25 per cent., perished from starvation or disease.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014Rohtak is a purely agricultural District, whose produce hardly more than suffices for its home consumption. A small surplus of grain, cotton, and other raw materials is exported to Delhi, Meerut, and Saharanpur; while piece-goods, spices, iron, sugar, salt, and timber are imported in exchange. Trade is carried on both at permanent markets and religious fairs. There are no manufactures of more than local importance, with the exception of ornamental turbans at Rohtak and saddlery at Kal\u00e1naur. Pretty pottery is made at Jhajjar, and cotton cloth for home use is woven in large quantities. The District had 52 miles of metalled and 507\u00bd miles of unmetalled road in 1873, but it has no other means of communication; there is no railway, and the canal is not navigable in this part of its course.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The imperial revenue from the District amounted in 1872-73 to \u00a393,310, of which \u00a389,184, or 95 per cent., was derived\nfrom the land tax. There was also a local revenue of \u00a37438, besides certain provincial dues which are not collected by separate Districts. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 4 tahsildars, and their subordinates. There were 11 civil and revenue courts in Rohtak in 1872-73. The imperial police numbered 383 men of all grades in 1871-72, besides 124 municipal constables, and 15 special policemen in two punitive posts. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 522 men, or 1 policeman to every 3'49 square miles of the area and to every 1028 of the population. The necessity for a special village watch is superseded in this District by a local custom, in accordance with which all the able-bodied men of each community take their turn as watchmen by lot. The watch is relieved at midnight, and the duty is efficiently performed without expense to the villagers. The total number of persons brought to trial upon all charges in 1872 amounted to 1849. There is only one jail in the District, the average daily number of prisoners in which amounted to 188 in 1872; the total jail population being 586. Education is slowly progressing. In 1872-73, there were 2852 children receiving instruction, at a total cost to Government of \u00a31701. The District is subdivided into 4 tahsils, with an aggregate of 501 villages and 74,032 proprietors or shareholders. There are 3 municipalities, viz. Rohtak, Beri, and Jhajjar; but a municipal income is also realized at Bahadargarh, Kharhoda, Goh\u00e1na, Mahim, Asoda, and Mandhoti. The aggregate revenue of the first five of these towns amounted in 1871-72 to \u00a32400, being at the rate of 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The climate of Rohtak is considered healthy, except in the northern portions, where percolation from the canal produces malaria, and generates the same fevers and spleen complaints that are so common under similar circumstances in the adjoining District of Karn\u00e1l. Small-pox also exists in an endemic form. The total number of deaths from all causes reported in 1872 was 7883, or 15 per thousand of the population; but these figures are doubtless considerably below the truth. The total rainfall in the District was 13'2 inches in 1866-67, 24'3 inches in 1867-68, 10'2 inches in 1868-69 (the year of scarcity), 18'7 inches in 1869-70, 15'7 inches in 1870-71, 15'5 inches in 1871-72, and 26'4 inches in 1872-73.\n\nRohtak.\u2014Western tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab; consisting of a sandy and almost waterless plain. Pop. (1868), 162,244; persons per square mile, 276.\n\nRohtak.\u2014Municipal town in Rohtak District, Punjab, and headquarters of the District and tahsil. Lat. 28\u00b0 54' N., long. 76\u00b0 38' E.; pop. (1868), 14,153, consisting of 8208 Hindus, 5808 Muhammadans, 116 Sikhs, and 21 Christians. Lies 42 miles north-west of Delhi, on\nthe Hiss\u00e1r road. Dates from a remote antiquity, but little can now be recovered of its early history. The ancient site, known as Khokra-kot, lies a small distance north of the modern town. Rebuilt, according to one tradition, in the time of Prithwi R\u00e1j (1160 A.D.); according to another, as early as the middle of the 4th century. During the stormy period which succeeded the decay of the Mughal Empire, Rohtak fell into the hands of one chieftain after another. Became in 1824 the headquarters of a British District. Centre of local trade; small commercial importance outside its own neighbourhood. Manufacture of cloth turbans. Court-house, police station, tahsili, church, d\u00e1k bungalow, post office, school-house, dispensary, public gardens. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3522, or 8\u00bdd. per head of the population (15,025) within municipal limits.\n\nRohtang.\u2014Pass in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, over the Him\u00e1layan ranges. Lat. 32\u00b0 22' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 17' 20\" E. The pass lies between Koks\u00e1r in Lah\u00fal and Palch\u00e1n in Kullu. A made road runs over it, practicable for laden mules and ponies. The crest has an elevation of only 13,000 feet above the sea\u2014very much lower than that of most neighbouring passes. The range on either side rises to a height of 16,000 feet, while several peaks within 12 miles exceed 20,000 feet. The main road from Sult\u00e1npur and K\u00e1ngra to Leh and Y\u00e1rkand crosses this pass, and then proceeds by the valley of the Bh\u00e1ga to the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha, whence it descends into Lad\u00e1kh. The Rohtang has been crossed in December, but becomes dangerous from the beginning of October.\n\nRoht\u00e1sgarh.\u2014Hill fort in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 37' 30\" N., long. 83\u00b0 55' 50\" E. The principal place of interest in the District from an antiquarian point of view; deriving its name from Rohit\u00e1swa, son of Harischandra, a Hindu king of the Solar dynasty, whose image was worshipped on this spot till destroyed by Aurangzeb. Little is known concerning the persons who held the fort from Harischandra's time until 1539, the year of its capture by Sher Sh\u00e1h, who immediately began to strengthen the works, but soon after selected a more favourable site at Shergarh. M\u00e1n Sinh, Akbar's Viceroy of Bengal and Behar, at the end of the 16th century, chose Roht\u00e1s as his stronghold; and two inscriptions in Sanskrit and Persian attribute to him all the buildings now existing. The remains of the fortress occupy a part of the tableland of Roht\u00e1sgarh, about 4 miles from east to west and 5 miles from north to south, with a circumference of nearly 28 miles. In 1848, Dr. Hooker ascertained its precise elevation to be 1490 feet. Much of the area is bare rock, but there is also a large quantity of red soil. The hill is accessible by 83 paths, of which four are called the great gh\u00e1ts, and the rest gh\u00e1tis. The principal antiquities of Roht\u00e1sgarh are\u2014two temples, said to have been built by M\u00e1n Sinh, one of which is\ncovered by a dome surpassing in lightness all the Hindu works that Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton had ever seen; a small mosque, ascribed to Aurangzeb; the palace or mah\u00e1l sar\u00e1\u00ed, with the building known as the bar\u00e1 dw\u00e1ri or twelve gates, where business was transacted. All these edifices are fully described in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xii. pp. 209-212. There is another famous Rohtas fort on the skirts of the Salt Range, in the Punjab. (See under ROTAS, the spelling fixed by the Punjab Government.)\n\n**Rojhan.**\u2014Municipal town in Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab.

Famous fort, built by Sher Sh\u00e1h, the Afgh\u00e1n prince who successfully opposed the Mughal dynasty, as a check on the Ghakkar tribes. Situated in the Salt Range, on a hill overlooking the gorge of the Kuh\u00e1n Nadi, 11 miles north-west of Jhelum town. The walls extend for 3 miles, and encircle the rocks which command the entrance of the pass. Some parts have a thickness of from 30 to 40 feet. The total area enclosed by the fortifications amounts to 260 acres. One gateway still remains in excellent preservation; the rest has fallen into ruins, which form a most striking and picturesque group.\n\nRouk-thwa.\u2014A stream which rises in the Poung-loung range in Toung-ng\u00fa District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. After a south-westerly course of about 30 miles, it falls into the Tsit-toung about 6 miles north of M\u00fan, a village in Shwe-gyeng District. Navigable in the rains by boats 30 feet long as far as Eng-bhek, but during the dry season only as far as Rouk-thwa-wa village.

The bordering lands are more or less inundated by the spring tides in April and May, which leave behind destructive impregnations of salt, rendering them unfit for cultivation unless small defensive works are thrown up round the fields every year to keep the water out. Grass and h\u00f3gl\u00e1 reeds are the ordinary produce, except in years when the rains set in and close early, when a late rice crop can be planted in September. The R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan is navigable throughout the year by native boats of 4 tons burden as far as Gh\u00e1t\u00e1l village, in Midnapur District.

With a rapid current, it is, even in dry weather, navigable only with difficulty;\nand when swollen by the rains, and dashing against the rocks which impede its course, it becomes impracticable even for rafts. It derives its name from the fact of its running through a country once inhabited by the tribe of Rwon Shan, which was overrun and annexed by Aloung-bh\u00fara in the latter half of the 18th century. Many of the people were brought away captive, and settled in a tract south-east of Syriam, now known as the Rwon circle.\n\nSa\u00e1datganj.\u2014Town in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh; situated 14 miles north-east of B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki town.

The villages constituting the State are much separated, some of them being surrounded by British territory, and others by portions of Baroda State. Sach\u00edn may, however, roughly speaking, be said to lie within the limits of the British District of Surat. It occupies an area of about 300 square miles, with a population (1872) of 18,061. Irrigation is carried on from tanks and wells. The climate is healthy, and the usual cereals are cultivated, as well as cotton and sugar-cane. Yarn and coarse cloth are manufactured.\n\nThe Naw\u00e1b of Sach\u00edn is by descent a Habshi or Abyssinian. When his ancestors first came to India is doubtful; but they were long known on the western coast as the Sidis of Dauda, R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, and Janjira. They were also the admirals of the fleets of the kings of Ahmednagar and Bij\u00e1pur, in the Deccan, whilst those dynasties lasted, and subse-\nquently of the Mughal Emperors; being appointed to that office by Aurangzeb about the year 1660, with an annual assignment of \u00a330,000 on the Surat revenues for their maintenance. On the decline of the Mughal Empire the Janjira Sidis became notorious pirates, plundering the ships of all nations, except the English, whose friendship they appear to have early cultivated. The Muhammadan admirals, who had their headquarters at the island of Janjira, remained chiefs of that place during the wars between Sivaji and the Mughals, also during the war between the Peshw\u00e1 and the British Government. During these wars different members of the family were alternately supported by either party as best suited its own interests. Towards the end of the last century, B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 Sidi, the heir to the throne of Janjir\u00e1 and to the other possessions of the Sid\u00eds, had been expelled from his dominions by a younger branch of the family (1784-91). He appealed for aid to the Marhatt\u00e1s and British. The Peshw\u00e1, being desirous of obtaining Janjir\u00e1, an arrangement was come to in 1791, by which B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 ceded to the Peshw\u00e1 Janjir\u00e1 in return for Sach\u00edn. B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 duly got possession of his new State of Sach\u00edn; but when the Peshw\u00e1 claimed Janjir\u00e1 the Sid\u00eds who held it refused to give it up, and succeeded in maintaining their independence. Sach\u00edn remained in the hands of B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 and his descendants; while Janjir\u00e1 has been, and is still, held by the younger branch of the family who had ousted B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1, the Peshw\u00e1 never having been able to establish his influence. Janjir\u00e1 is reckoned a maiden fortress to this day. A full account of the transactions between the British, the Peshw\u00e1, and the rival sides of Janjir\u00e1 and Sach\u00edn, will be found in Aitchison's Treaties, vol. iv. pp. 324 et seq., ed. 1876. The present (1876-77) chief of Sach\u00edn is Naw\u00e1b Sidi Abdul K\u00e1dar Mu\u1e25ammad V\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n, a Sunni Musalm\u00e1n, aged twelve years. During his minority the affairs of the State are administered by a British officer. The chief is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent, his own subjects only. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a315,983, and maintains a force of 62 men. The family of the chief hold a title authorizing adoption, and succession follows the rule of primogeniture. There are 6 schools in the State, with a total of 238 pupils.\n\nSach\u00edn.\u2014Capital of Sach\u00edn State, Bombay; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 3' 40\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 59' E., 9 miles south of Surat city.\n\nSadalg\u00ed.\u2014Town in Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay; situated 51 miles north of Belg\u00e1um town, and 25 south-east of Kolh\u00e1pur, in lat. 16\u00b0 33' N., and long. 74\u00b0 33' E.

Pop. (1868), 11,198, consisting of 4831 Hindus, 5938 Muhammadans, and 429 Sikhs. A town of great antiquity, dating back as far as the time of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, but now of no political importance. Yearly fair at shrine of Sh\u00e1h Komez, a Muhammadan saint, attended by about 20,000 persons. Manufacture of coarse cloth; local trade in country produce. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3352, or 7\u00bdd. per head of population (11,179) within municipal limits.\n\nSadiy\u00e1.\u2014The name formerly given to a tract of country stretching along the north bank of the Brahmaputra, on the extreme north-east frontier of Assam. The administrative headquarters were at the village of Sadiya. The present th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle of Sadiy\u00e1, forming part of the Subdivision of Dibrugarh, in Lakhimpur District, has an area of 178 square miles; pop. (1872), 6021.\n\nSadiy\u00e1.\u2014Village in Lakhimpur District, Assam; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 49' 45\" N., and long. 95\u00b0 41' 35\" E., on the right or north bank of the main stream of the Brahmaputra, about 100 miles above Dibrugarh. Sadiy\u00e1 is the extreme north-east frontier outpost of British India, and has always been a place of much political importance. It is supposed to have been one of the first places occupied by the Ahams, when they invaded Assam from the direction of Burma. In later times, the Government of the surrounding country was administered by a viceroy of the Aham kings, with the title of Sadiy\u00e1 Kho\u00e1. When the Burmese occupied Assam, this title was conferred on a chief of the aboriginal tribe of Kh\u00e1mt\u00eds, whose office was confirmed on the annexation of Assam by the British in 1826. The Sadiy\u00e1 Kho\u00e1 furnished a military contingent of 100 men, and supported himself by forced contributions. At the same time a British garrison was stationed at Sadiy\u00e1; and subsequently, in 1835, when the exactions of the Kh\u00e1mt\u00ed chief became intolerable, the civil administration was placed in the hands of the officer commanding the troops. In 1839, the Kh\u00e1mt\u00eds rose in rebellion. They cut off the outpost at\nSadiy\u00e1, and killed Major White, the commandant and Political Agent, together with the detachment of Sepoys. At this time, Sadiy\u00e1 was described as an important place, with a population of 4000 souls. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r at the present time does not contain more than 20 houses. The garrison consists of 1 European officer and 122 men of the 44th Assam Native Infantry. In order to promote friendly relations with the neighbouring hill tribes of Kh\u00e1m\u00edts, Mishm\u00eds, and Singghos, a fair is held annually at the time of full moon in the beginning of February. The hillmen bring down caoutchouc, wax, musk, cloth, mats, d\u00e1sos or hill-knives, and ivory, which they exchange for cotton cloth, salt, metal utensils, silver ear-rings, beads, brass wire, and opium. In 1876, the attendance of hillmen was estimated at 3000; the value of the articles they sold at \u00a34910, and the value of those they bought at \u00a34447. The Deputy Commissioner of Lakhimpur is generally present at this fair, and advantage is taken of the occasion to distribute presents among the chiefs. During the rainy season, steamers can proceed up the Brahmaputra as far as Sadiy\u00e1; and it is hoped that this place may at some future day become the starting-point of a through trade between Assam and China. It is almost certain that such a trade existed in the beginning of the last century.\n\n**Sadr.**\u2014South-western tahsil of Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a level and arid plain, lying along the west bank of the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Area, 286 square miles, of which 236 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 201,674; land revenue, \u00a321,322; total Government revenue, \u00a323,987; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a338,073.\n\n**Sadras** (correctly Satranja-patana).\u2014Town in Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras; situated in lat. 12\u00b0 31' 25\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 12' E. Pop. (1871), 1144, inhabiting 207 houses. Sadras first became a trading settlement by the Dutch in 1647, and was long famous for the fineness of the muslin produced by its looms. The Dutch erected, close to the shore, a brick fort of considerable extent and pretensions to strength. The ruins still remain. There are also the remains of the houses of the officials, one of which has long been in use as a halting-place for European travellers. The old Dutch cemetery is within the fort, and is still maintained in decency and order under treaty. Many of the tombstones are curious specimens of the sculptor's art. The date of the oldest is 1695. There is a Dutch church on the esplanade opposite the fort, and the Wesleyan Mission have also a small settlement here. The once bustling importance of the place has long departed. There are still a few looms, but the cunning which produced the once famous fabrics is lost. The English captured Sadras in 1795, and although it was temporarily restored to the Dutch, it has been an English possession since 1824. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r river, which debouches on the sea a few miles to the south\nof Sadras, has silted up, and its bar cannot be crossed by large sea-going ships. Sadras is now a petty place on the coast, with the open sea outside, and has long ceased to be a resort of maritime commerce.\n\n**Sadpur.**\u2014*Pargan\u00e1* in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Bisw\u00e1n *tahsil*, on the east by South Kundri *pargan\u00e1*, on the south by B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, and on the west by Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d *pargan\u00e1*. Area, 108 square miles, or 69,087 acres, of which 50,268 acres are cultivated, 9743 cultivable, 133 rent-free, and 8943 uncultivable waste. The incidence of the land revenue demand is at the rate of 2s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivation, 2s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 10\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Pop. (1869), 54,477, namely, 47,095 Hindus and 7,382 Muhammadians. The 160 villages comprising the *pargan\u00e1* have been constituted into 114 demarcated *maurds*, of which 81 are held under *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed* and 33 under *zamind\u00e1r\u00ed* tenure. Muhammadians form the principal proprietary body, owning 119 villages, Raikw\u00e1rs hold 11, Seths 5, Janw\u00e1r Kshattriy\u00e1s 4, Panw\u00e1rs 4, Kashm\u00edr\u00ed Brahmans 4. The remaining 23 are chiefly held by K\u00e1yasths. The *pargan\u00e1* is a poor one, with only 2 villages containing upwards of 2000 inhabitants. No roads, no large *b\u00e1dz\u00e1rs*, and no fairs.\n\n**Sadpur.**\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh, and headquarters of Sadpur *pargan\u00e1*; situated 30 miles south-east of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town, but with no road or river communication with any other place. An insignificant town of (1869) 2109 inhabitants. Village school; market twice a week.\n\n**Sadull\u00e1nagar.**\u2014*Pargan\u00e1* in Gonda District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Utraula *pargan\u00e1*, from which it is separated by the Kuw\u00e1na river; on the east by Burh\u00e1p\u00e1ra *pargan\u00e1*; on the south by Manik\u00e1pur *pargan\u00e1*, the Bisuhi river marking the boundary line; and on the west by Gonda *pargan\u00e1*. The boundary rivers are fordable every few miles, except during the rains, by men and cattle, and the more important tracks are furnished with rough bridges. Along the banks of both the rivers runs a fringe of forest, varying from 3 miles to a few hundred yards in breadth, but containing little good timber. The *s\u00e1l* trees, stunted by excessive crowding, never attain sufficient size to make them of any great value; and, except the *jam\u00fan*, which is plentiful and attains a fair growth, and is of use both for building and burning, the only other tree of consequence is the *mahua*, whose flowers and fruit are leased out for the manufacture of spirits and oil, and the wood of which is largely employed in roofing the huts of the neighbouring villages. Game is not particularly plentiful. The centre of the *pargan\u00e1* is a flat ugly plain, underwooded and covered with fair cultivation, alternating with tracts of the long *khar* grass. The soil is of a light dry loam. Water may be found almost anywhere at a depth of from 15 to\n20 feet from the surface, and irrigation is very common both from wells and small tanks. Area, 103 square miles; cultivated area, 37,406 acres, or rather more than 56 per cent. of the whole. Of this, 22,040 acres are under kharif, 24,675 under rabi, and 12,025 under both crops, the balance being fallow. Owing to the extent of jungle, the population is, for Oudh, sparse, numbering (1869) 35,152, or 341 to the square mile. Hindus numbered 28,221, and Musalmans 6931.\n\nUntil quite lately, the greater part of the pargana was under dense jungle, the home of predatory bands of nomadic tribes; and most of the present tillage commenced with the purchase of parcels of land in birt from the later R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Utraula. Some idea of the scantiness of the agricultural population at the commencement of the present century, when the practice of selling birt rights became for the first time common, may be gathered from the fact that in 1815 A.D. the Government revenue was only \u00a369. From that time the advance becomes rapid and steady. In 1819, the demand had risen to \u00a31331, and ten years later it reached \u00a32406. With a few trifling variations, it remained at this amount till R\u00e1ja Darsh\u00e1n Sinh in 1838 raised it to \u00a33512, a figure which was never again attained under the Native Government. Shortly before annexation, it had fallen to little over \u00a32000; and when we took over the District, Sadull\u00e1nagar was assessed on the principle of half-profits at \u00a32408. The progress of population and agriculture since that period has been incredibly rapid, and in 1872, by a revised assessment, the Government land revenue was raised to \u00a35607, with \u00a3152 on account of cesses. In consideration of the largeness of the enhancement, and in view of the fact that much of the recently broken land was held on long leases at progressive rents, the rise has been distributed over a period of ten years, and it is not proposed to take the full demand till 1883 A.D. Of the 112 villages comprising the pargana, 50 are held by talukd\u00e1rs, paying a revenue of \u00a32924; while 62 villages, assessed at \u00a32835, are settled with zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs.\n\nSadull\u00e1nagar.\u2014Village in Gonda District, Oudh, and headquarters of Sadull\u00e1nagar pargana; situated 28 miles north-east of Gonda town. Lat. 27\u00b0 5' 45\" N., long. 82\u00b0 24' 51\" E.; pop. (1869), 706. Founded in 1786 by R\u00e1ja Sadull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n of the Utraula family.\n\nSadull\u00e1pur.\u2014Village in Maldah District, Bengal. The chief descent or gh\u00e1t to the holy stream of the Bhagir\u00e1thi is at this place, to which the dead bodies of Hindus are brought from great distances to be burned. Market and small annual fair held in March, chiefly for religious purposes.\n\nThere is another village of this name, Sadull\u00e1pur, on the right bank of the Chenab, in the Punjab, the scene of an indecisive action between our troops, under Thackwell, and the Sikh general Sher Sinh, in January 1849. (Col. Yule.)\nSafed Koh (S\u00fafd Koh, Safaid Koh).\u2014Range of mountains in Afghanistan, thus described by Colonel C. M. MacGregor:\n\n'The range commences to the east of the Allah-koh ridge, between Kabul and Ghazni, and then follows $34^\\circ$ of latitude for about 75 miles to longitude $70^\\circ 35'$, when it splits into two main ridges, one going north-east to the Khaibar and the Kabul river; the other, after a short turn to the east, continuing due east to the junction of the Kabul river with the Indus. During the first portion of its course, this range drains on the north into the Kabul river and on the south into the Kuram; and it continues to do this after its separation into two branches, though not with the same regularity, some of the easternmost drainage going direct into the Indus.\n\n'It is often of course quite arbitrary to say where one range commences and another ends, but I think in this case it will be best to say the Safed Koh commences from a few miles west of the Shutargardan Pass, between Kuram and Logar. This being the case, the first spur which it throws out to the north is that which forms the east watershed of the Logar river, and, dividing it from the Kh\u00fard Kabul river, ends at Bh\u00fatkh\u00e1k.\n\n'The next spur is that between the Kh\u00fard Kabul and the Tez\u00edn rivers, over which are the Haft Kot\u00e1l and Lataband Passes. This Wood calls the Karkacha range, or rather he confounds two distinct spurs in one under this name; but it may be doubted whether it would not more aptly be termed the Haft Kot\u00e1l spur. Wood says that the ridge he calls the Karkacha, drains on the west into the Logar and east into the S\u00farkhab; but from Garden's surveys we now know this to be a mistake, there being two rivers\u2014the Kh\u00fard Kabul and Tez\u00edn\u2014between the Logar and S\u00farkhab, which drain into the Kabul river, and which rise in the Safed Koh. Consequently it is quite an error to consider the mass of mountains between the Logar and S\u00farkhab one spur. After the spur between the Kh\u00fard Kabul river and Tez\u00edn, another spur comes out from the main range, and after running north for about 30 miles to the north of Jagdalak, it then turns to the east, and, running parallel with the Kabul river, ends at the junction of the S\u00farkhab with that river. This spur drains into the Tez\u00edn on the west and the S\u00farkhab on the east, and, after its eastward bend, into the Kabul river on the north and the S\u00farkhab on the south.\n\n'The other north spurs of the Safed Koh to the east are not of so marked a character, but they run between the streams which, flowing down from it, join the S\u00farkhab or the Kabul river; of these the principal are, commencing from the west, the Gandamak, K\u00e1ras\u00fa, Chiprial, Hisarak, Kote, and Mohmand.\n\n'The spurs on the south of this range are not of such importance as those on the north. The first is the one which runs out from the\nShutargardan Pass, and drains on the north and east into the Haz\u00e1r-darakh and Harl\u00e1b streams; on the south, into another source of the Kuram. The second is the Peiw\u00e1r ridge, which comes out from the S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Peak and ends at the Kuram, draining into the Ker\u00ed and Hari\u00e1b rivers on the west and the Peiw\u00e1r on the east. Then again, to the east there are numerous short spurs, which shoot down to the south but do not reach the river, save in the form of detritus. These need not be mentioned further, and the only other spur requiring notice is the one which, coming out somewhat to the east of longitude 70\u00b0 30', runs between the Kirm\u00e1n D\u00e1ra and the Kirm\u00e1n stream.\n\nWood places the west limit of the Safed Koh at long. 69\u00b0 36' E., thus regarding its commencement as at very nearly the same point as I do\u2014viz. just east of the Altim\u00far Pass over the Allah-koh range, in long. 69\u00b0 30' E.\n\nJudging from the accounts of Wood, Bellew, and Walker, the scenery would seem to be equal in grandeur and beauty on both sides of the range; and Wood in his description of the northern side falls into an error, when he says that looking towards the summit there are successive ranges, for the main range runs east and west, and throws its spurs to the north and south. Wood says the farthest peaks are bare and irregular, the nearest covered with pine-trees, and this tallies with the graphic description given by Bellew of its south aspect.\n\nCol. Walker says of the range\u2014\"Its highest point is the S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Mountain, 15,622 feet above the sea, whence the range preserves a tolerably uniform level, perhaps nowhere less than 12,500 feet, until it again culminates in a double-peak mountain, whose summits average 14,800 feet. I have been unable to learn the local names of these peaks, or whether, like the S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Mountain, they tell of a remote antiquity, when the country was ruled by Hindus long anterior to the origin of Muhammadanism. The offshoots of this range (i.e. the branches east of long. 70\u00b0 30' E.) have usually an east and west direction, and are remarkable for their parallelism with each other and with the parent range. The most important, though not the highest, of these stretches away to Attock, and is the southern boundary of the Peshawar valley, dividing it from the system of valleys of which Koh\u00e1t District is composed. Before entering British territory, it forms the southern barrier of the T\u00edrah valley.\"\n\nCol. MacGregor says the low hills of Jalal\u00e1b\u00e1d (ends of the north spurs of the Safed Koh) are extremely barren, but the lofty ranges of Kund, Karkacha, and Safed Koh are richly clad with pine, almond, and other trees. The appearance, he continues, of the valleys of the Safed Koh is a mixture of orchard, field, and garden. They abound in mulberry, pomegranate, and other fruit-trees; while the banks of their streams are edged with a fine sward, enamelled with a profusion of wild flowers, and fringed by rows of weeping willows.\nIt is worthy of note that the Safed Koh presents in its south aspect the same glacis slopes of shingle which were observed by Griffiths on the south slopes of the spurs of the Hindu Kush, and which may also be noticed on parts of the hills north of the Peshawar valley. No mention is made by any authority of this peculiarity existing on the north of this range, or, I believe, of any other range.\n\nSafipur.\u2014Coal-measure in Sibsagar District, Assam, extending along the foot of the Naga Hills to the Dikhu river. The coal is hard and of good quality, but the difficulties of transport have hitherto proved insuperable. The total supply is estimated at 10 million tons.\n\nSafipur.\u2014Tahsil or Subdivision of Unao District, Oudh, lying between 26\u00b0 37' and 27\u00b0 2' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 6' and 80\u00b0 30' E. long. Bounded on the north by Bilgram and Sandila tahsils of Hardoi District, on the east by Mohan tahsil of Unao, on the south by Unao tahsil, and on the west by Cawnpore District in the North-Western Provinces. Area, 395 square miles, of which 231 are cultivated; pop., according to the Census of 1869, 203,626, of whom 179,748 are Hindus and 23,878 Muhammadans. Number of males, 106,435; of females, 97,191; number of villages or towns, 371; average density of population, 515 per square mile. This tahsil comprises the three parganas of Safipur, Fatehpur Chaurasi, and Bangarmau.\n\nSafipur.\u2014Pargana of Unao District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Sandila pargana of Hardoi District, from which it is separated by the Sai river; on the east by Aswan Rasulabad; on the south by Pariar; and on the east by Fatehpur Chaurasi. A well-wooded country. Area, 132 square miles, or 84,530 acres, divided into 137 townships. Soil, chiefly loam and clay; staple crop, barley. Government revenue, \u00a310,836, at an average rate of 2s. 6\u00bdd. per acre. Pop. (1869), 72,319, viz. 62,179 Hindus and 10,140 Muhammadans. The extent of land held under the different varieties of tenure is as follows:\u2014Talukdar, 4249 acres; pukhtaddari, 240 acres; pattidari, 37,168 acres; zamindari, 36,181 acres; bhayachara, 5531 acres; and Government villages, 1158 acres. Four large annual fairs, at one of which 15,000 persons assemble.\n\nSafipur (or Saipur).\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 44' 10\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 23' 15\" E., 17 miles north-west of Unao town, on the road leading thence to Hardoi. A flourishing, well-built town, containing 89 masonry houses, 14 mosques, and 6 Hindu temples. Pop. (1869), 7286, namely, 4336 Hindus and 2950 Musalmans. The headquarters of the Safipur tahsil and pargana. Daily market, with sales averaging \u00a35500 a year. Flourishing school; police station. The town is said to have been originally founded by Sai Sukal, a Brahman, and is generally called after him, Saipur. A religious mendicant subsequently came to the town, and was buried there, and the\nname was changed to Safipur in commemoration of the holy man. S\u00e1\u00ed Sukal is said to have been defeated and killed in 1389 by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur, who put his lieutenants in charge of the town, and whose descendants are the principal proprietors at the present day.\n\nS\u00e1gar (Saugor).\u2014A British District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between $23^\\circ 4'$ and $24^\\circ 27'$ N. lat, and between $78^\\circ 6'$ and $79^\\circ 12'$ E. long. Area, 4005 square miles; population in 1872, 527,725 persons. Bounded on the north by L\u00e1l\u00edtpur District of the North-Western Provinces and the Native States of Bij\u00e1war, Pann\u00e1, and Charkh\u00e1ri; on the east by Pann\u00e1 and Damoh District; on the south and west by Narsinhpur District and the Native States of Bhop\u00e1l and Gwalior. The administrative headquarters are at SAGAR TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of S\u00e1gar occupies, with that of Damoh, the high Vindhy\u00e1n tableland which stretches out in the north-west corner of the Central Provinces. The scarp of the Bh\u00e1nrer range, rising abruptly from the valley of the Narbada (Nerbudda), forms a natural boundary line, from which the District extends northwards in a vast plain broken here and there by hills, with a general slope towards the north-east. So, too, east of S\u00e1gar town the boundary is marked by a clear escarpment, but to the north and west no salient physical feature indicates the limits of the District. The country is for the most part covered with trap; but on the north, the Vindhy\u00e1n sandstone runs down, broadening out opposite Kur\u00e1i and gradually disappearing southwards; and on the east, the sandstone occupies a tract about 20 miles long and 5 broad, reaching from Garh\u00e1kota to beyond Surkh\u00ed. Garh\u00e1kota itself and a narrow strip of country as far south as Rehl\u00ed rest on limestone. The form of the trap hills distinguishes them at once from the inlying hills of sandstone; their vegetation is also distinct, and the teak saplings which flourish on the trap rarely grow on the sandstone. The soil in the north and east of the District is a reddish-brown alluvium. The south and centre are covered with black soil, on which wheat is grown in large quantities. But the cultivated plains are broken up by hills, rising singly or in groups, and by small ranges and plateaux, some of them covered with jungle, others stony and barren. The principal streams, the Sun\u00e1r, Beas (Bi\u00e1s), Dh\u00fap\u00e1n, and B\u00edn\u00e1, all flow in a northerly direction towards the valley of the Ganges. S\u00e1gar, however, contains no river of importance. Though several densely wooded tracts exist in the District, they yield no great quantity of the finer sorts of timber. The largest forest, the Ramn\u00e1, a preserve to the north-east of Garh\u00e1kota, covering 8 square miles, produces teak and s\u00e1j. Smaller forests to the south of the District, as Mohl\u00ed near Rehl\u00ed, and Tarh\u00e1 K\u00edsl\u00ed near Deori, supply teak, s\u00e1j, and bamboos. Towards the north, in Sh\u00e1hgarh, lie large tracts of wooded country, comprising mahua and s\u00e1j, with some\nteak, and bamboos in abundance. About 2 square miles of this region form the Tigor\u00e1 reserve. The mineral wealth of the District is insignificant; but iron-ore, of excellent quality, found near H\u00edr\u00e1pur, a small village in the extreme north-east, affords occupation to a few smelting furnaces of the rudest character. In many parts, also, sandstone, well suited for building purposes, abounds.\n\n**History.**\u2014The formation of S\u00e1g\u00e1r into a District rests on no historical considerations. Until quite recent times, semi-independent rulers of small tracts have co-existed at various places; and while the southern half has been governed from Rehl\u00ed, the northern half has been subject to Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed or Sh\u00e1hgarh. Rehl\u00ed, a village situated on elevated ground about 28 miles south-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town, appears to have been originally held by the Gonds, to whom succeeded a race of shepherds, known as Baladeos. The Baladeos first settled at Khamaria, a village a mile off, but in time they removed to Rehl\u00ed, where they built a fort. The place next passed into the hands of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatar S\u00e1l, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of Pann\u00e1, who made it over to B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1, in return for assistance in a war with the Sub\u00e1h of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Peshw\u00e1 built the fort which now exists. The town of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, after a similar history, at this time formed part of the dominions of Chhatar S\u00e1l. That chieftain died in 1735; and in addition to his previous gift to the Peshw\u00e1, left him one-third of his kingdom, including S\u00e1g\u00e1r town and a considerable portion of the present District. The territory thus acquired continued to be managed by agents of the Peshw\u00e1 until 1818, when, on the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1's government, the southern part of S\u00e1g\u00e1r District came under British rule. The country to the north appears to have belonged to the great Gond kingdom of Mandla; and Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, about 29 miles north of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town, owes its origin to a scion of that line, named Surat S\u00e1. About the end of the 16th century, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barsinh Deva, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of the neighbouring State of Orchh\u00e1, defeated Surat S\u00e1; and made Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed the capital, from which he ruled the northern part of the District. His son Pah\u00e1r Sinh continued in power till 1619, when the country became a portion of the Delhi Empire. During the eighty years of Muhammadan rule which followed, Garola, Kur\u00e1i, and Khiml\u00e1sa became places of importance. A succession of five governors from Delhi administered Northern S\u00e1g\u00e1r, until about 1700, at the time of the decline of the Mughal Empire, the last of them, Naw\u00e1b Gh\u00e1irat Kh\u00e1n, was defeated by Chhatar S\u00e1l, who thus for a short time united nearly the whole of the District under one rule. Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed remained under his descendants until 1802, when Umr\u00e1o Sinh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the neighbouring village of Patan, gained the fort by treachery. Six months, however, had not passed when he was himself defeated by the army of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, who annexed the country. In 1818, after the flight of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed\nwas taken by a British force under General Marshall. Though Sh\u00e1hgarh, about 40 miles north-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, came under British rule at a later period, its history is similar to that of Dh\u00e1moni. Originally part of the Gond kingdom of Mandla, Sh\u00e1hgarh also was seized by a Bundel\u00e1 chieftain, Sh\u00e1hman by name, who about 1650 defeated and killed Chint\u00e1man, the last Gond ruler. The line of Sh\u00e1hman ended in 1798, when his descendant Kh\u00e1nj\u00fa was defeated by Mardan Sinh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1kota. In 1842, the son of Mardan Sinh was succeeded by a nephew named Bakht Bal\u00ed. This year was signalized by the outbreak known as the Bundel\u00e1 insurrection. Jaw\u00e1hir Sinh of Chandrapur being sued on account of decrees of the Civil Court, broke into open rebellion, and burned and plundered the towns of Khiml\u00e1sa, Kur\u00e1i, Naraol\u00ed, Dh\u00e1moni, and Bin\u00e1\u00edk\u00e1. On hearing this, Delan S\u00e1, a Gond chief living in the south of the District, also rose, and plundered Deorf and the surrounding country. The insurrection was quelled in the following year, chiefly through the efforts of Captain Hamilton; and Lord Ellenborough broke up the administration of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbada territories, and reorganized it on an entirely new footing. In 1857 occurred the great rebellion, which led to the downfall of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sh\u00e1hgarh. In June, when the Mutiny began, the regiments stationed at S\u00e1g\u00e1r were the 31st Native Infantry, commanded by Major Hampden, and the 42nd, commanded by Colonel Dalzell, with the 3rd Irregular Cavalry, and a few European gunners. The entire force was under the command of Brigadier Sage. On the 27th June, the officers, with the European artillery and residents of the station, by order of the Brigadier moved into the fort, taking all the arms they could collect, and the treasure from the District office. Shortly afterwards, the 42nd and the cavalry mutinied, and burned a good many houses, besides seizing all the treasure that had been left. The 31st, however, remained loyal, and made a demonstration against the mutineers, many of whom made off towards Sh\u00e1hgarh. When the news of the rising got abroad, Mardan Sinh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1npur, took possession of the present Subdivision of Kur\u00e1i; Bakht Bal\u00ed, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh, seized Band\u00e1, Rehl\u00ed, and Garh\u00e1kota; and Adil Muhammad, Naw\u00e1b of Garh\u00ed Am\u00e1pan\u00ed, occupied R\u00e1hatgarh. In fact, these three divided the whole District between them. For eight months, affairs remained in this state; and while the fort and town of S\u00e1g\u00e1r were held by the Europeans, the whole surrounding country was in possession of the rebels. The latter never attacked the fort, and three engagements with the English forces at S\u00e1g\u00e1r proved indecisive. At length, in February 1858, Sir Hugh Rose arrived with the Central India Field Force at R\u00e1hatgarh, where, after totally defeating Adil Muhammad, he took and partially destroyed the fort. He next defeated the troops of Mardan Sinh at Barodi\u00e1 Naunagar, and having cleared the country round R\u00e1hatgarh and Kur\u00e1i, marched to S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Sir\nHugh Rose then advanced to Garh\u00e1kota, where he routed the followers of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh, and seized the fort, in which the rebels had left a large quantity of treasure. Soon after, he met the remainder of Bakht Bali's forces at Madanpur, and defeated them with great slaughter. By the beginning of March 1858, order was re-established throughout the District. The dominions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh were confiscated, and a portion of them added to the District of S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Bakht Bal\u00ed gave himself up, under the amnesty, at Maraur\u00e1, and was sent as a State prisoner to Lahore.\n\n**Population.**\u2014A rough enumeration in 1866 returned the population of S\u00e1g\u00e1r at 498,642. The more careful Census of 1872 disclosed 527,725. The latest estimate of 1877 indicates a total of 554,644. The Census of 1872 still remains, however, the only basis for a detailed examination of the people. It disclosed a population of 527,725 persons, on an area of 4005 square miles, residing in 1858 villages or townships and 98,777 houses; persons per square mile, 131\u00b777; villages per square mile, 0\u00b746; houses per square mile, 24\u00b766; persons per village, 284\u00b703; persons per house, 5\u00b735. Classified according to sex\u2014males, 278,351, and females, 249,374. According to age, the male children in 1877 numbered 99,486; the female children, 88,583. Ethnical division, 1877\u2014Europeans, 891; Eurasians, 100; aboriginal tribes, 25,699; Hindus, 486,080; Muhammadans, 24,742; Buddhists and Jains, 16,739. Thus the aboriginal tribes constitute only 4\u00b763 per cent. of the total population, a proportion smaller than in any other District of the Central Provinces. They consist almost entirely of Gonds, 24,217 in 1872. Among the Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans in that year numbered 43,787; the mass of the Hindu population consisting of Cham\u00e1rs (58,851), Lodh\u00eds (42,542), Kachn\u00eds (40,156), Ah\u00edrs or Gaulis (34,545), Kurmis (23,640), and other cultivating or inferior castes. Native Christians in 1877, 393. The best cultivators are the Kurm\u00eds, who immigrated from the Do\u00e1b about the beginning of the 17th century, and the Lodh\u00eds, who made their way to the Vindhya tableland during the time of Aurangzeb. Though not tall, the inhabitants of S\u00e1g\u00e1r are for the most part a sturdy race. The simple white cloth made in the country forms the dress in the hot season of the poorer classes. In the cold weather, they wear a thick cotton-padded coat, reaching below the knees. The favourite colour is the green mah\u00fad, more particularly in the north of the District bordering on Bundelkhand, where green is regarded as the national colour. Cloth dyed with dl or madder is also much worn, especially by females. In the south, the population are peaceful and tractable; but towards the north, their character undergoes a change for the worse; and the Kohris, a small caste dwelling on the borders near Native States, where they find protection if pressed by the police, share with another caste called Khangars a notoriety for\ncrime. The increase of the population between 1866 and 1872 is partly due to immigration from Damoh, which followed the famine of 1869. No explanation, however, can be given of the fact that S\u00e1gar contains nearly as many Buddhists and Jains as all the rest of the Central Provinces together. The prevailing language is Hind\u00ed, but Urdu is also spoken. There are only 2 towns in S\u00e1gar District with a population exceeding 5000, viz. SAGAR, the headquarters of the District (pop. 45,655), and GARHAKOTA, 9085. Townships with from 1000 to 5000 inhabitants number 57; from 200 to 1000 inhabitants, 705; villages with fewer than 200 inhabitants, 1094. Of the municipalities, SAGAR (pop. within municipal limits, 48,461) had an income during the year 1876-77 of \u00a33233, of which \u00a32883 was derived from taxation, being 1s. 2d. per head; and Garh\u00e1kota (9640) had an income of \u00a3948, of which \u00a3387 was derived from taxation, being 9\u00bdd. per head. The smaller municipalities of KURAI, REHLI, and DEORI, with a total population of 14,178, had an aggregate income of \u00a31560, of which \u00a31113 was derived from taxation.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4005 square miles, only 1222 are cultivated, and of the portion lying waste, 1554 are returned as cultivable; 4507 acres are irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. The Government assessment is at the rate of 1s. 1\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated land, or 7\u00bdd. on the cultivable land. Wheat forms the staple crop of the District, and was grown in 1876 on 441,002 acres. Other food grains occupied 209,109 acres; while 64,265 were devoted to oil-seeds, 28,384 to cotton, 15,772 to rice, and 4052 to sugar-cane. Cattle and buffaloes are bred to a large extent in the District, both for draught and carriage, and also for dairy purposes, especially the manufacture of ghi; and lately some bulls have been imported from Hiss\u00e1r and Mysore, to improve the indigenous breed. The stock of sheep is small, and insufficient even for home consumption. The Cham\u00e1rs and Gonds eat flesh when they can get it, and are not particular about its condition. Wheat, barley, and d\u00e1l form the food of the richer inhabitants; the poorer classes content themselves with b\u00e1jra, kodo, kutki, and often in seasons of scarcity subsist on the mahua and other jungle fruits. The Census of 1872 showed a total of 6927 proprietors, of whom 2783 were classed as \u2018inferior.\u2019 The tenants numbered 51,862, of whom 17,423 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while 34,439 were tenants-at-will. The rent rates per acre for the different qualities of land in 1876 are returned as follows:\u2014Land suited for wheat, 3s.; inferior grain, 1s. 6d.; oil-seeds, 2s. 1\u00bdd.; cotton, 2s. 9d.; rice, 4s.; sugar-cane, 8s. 3d. The ordinary prices of produce per cwt. were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 4s. 3d.; linseed, 7s. 8d.; cotton, 46s.; rice, 7s.; sugar (g\u00far), 13s. 4d. The wages per diem for skilled labour averaged 9d.; for unskilled labour, 3d.\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014S\u00e1gar is not the seat of any important manufacture. Large cattle fairs are held weekly at Kur\u00e1i, and once a year at Garh\u00e1kota. The other principal fairs take place at Bh\u00e1pel, Pandalpur, and Rang\u00edr. The iron-ore, smelted near H\u00edr\u00e1pur, goes principally to Cawnpore; but the chief export of the District consists of grain supplied to the markets of Bhop\u00e1l, Gwalior, and Bundelkhand. Principal imports\u2014sugar and kir\u00e1na, or grocery, from M\u00edrz\u00e1pur; and English cloth and piece-goods from M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, and from Bombay by way of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. The town of S\u00e1gar is the entrep\u00f4t of the salt trade with R\u00e1jputana. The salt is brought by Banj\u00e1ras from the Pachbhadra salt marshes in Jodhpur and from the salt lake at Sambhar, and is exported by the S\u00e1gar merchants to Jabalpur, Rewah, Narsinhpur, and Bundelkhand. In 1877, 50 miles of made roads within the District were returned as of the \u2018first\u2019 class, 63 of the \u2018second,\u2019 and 21 of the \u2018third\u2019 class. The main lines of communication are\u2014the road from Jabalpur to S\u00e1gar, and thence via R\u00e1hatgarh towards Indore, with travellers\u2019 bungalows at S\u00e1gar and R\u00e1hatgarh; the road from Gwalior via Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed and L\u00e1litpur to S\u00e1gar, and thence towards Narsinhpur, with a travellers\u2019 bungalow at M\u00e1lthon; the road from S\u00e1gar in a north-easterly direction towards Cawnpore, with a travellers\u2019 bungalow at Sh\u00e1hgarh; and the road from S\u00e1gar in a north-westerly direction to Sironj in Sindhi\u00e1\u2019s territory, and Mhow via Kur\u00e1i. None of these roads is bridged and metalled throughout. A road to connect S\u00e1gar with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, having Karel\u00ed as its terminus, and crossing the Narbada (Nerbudda) at the Birm\u00e1n Ghat, is still under construction. The District has no means of communication by water.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, S\u00e1gar was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1876-77, \u00a369,196, of which the land yielded \u00a344,060. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a36416: number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 9; magistrates, 16: maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 28 miles; average distance, 26 miles: number of police, 598, being 1 policeman to every 5\u00b74 square miles and every 706 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1876 was 183, of which 23 were females. The total cost of the jails in that year was \u00a31052. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 88, attended by 4657 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Through the greater part of the District the climate is considered moderate. Average temperature in the shade in 1876 at the civil station\u2014May, highest reading 110\u00b0 F., lowest, 76\u00b0 F.; July, highest 103\u00b0 F., lowest 69\u00b0 F.; December, highest 83\u00b0 F., lowest 51\u00b0 F. The rainfall was an average one, between 49 and 50 inches.\nStorms are rarely of such severity as to injure the crops. The prevalent disease of the District is an intermittent fever, which comes on after the rains, especially during the month of October. Bowel complaints also cause many deaths. In 1876, nine charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 30,247 in-door and out-door patients. The reported death-rate amounted to 33\u00b759 per thousand of the population.\n\n**S\u00e1gar (Saugor).** \u2014 The central tahsil or Subdivision of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 5' and 23\u00b0 56' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 37' and 79\u00b0 21' E. long. Pop. (1872), 190,980; area, 1067 square miles; number of villages or townships, 501, and of houses, 34,748.\n\n**S\u00e1gar (Saugor).** \u2014 Principal town and headquarters of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Lat. 23\u00b0 49' 50\" N., long. 78\u00b0 48' 45\" E.; pop. (1872), 45,655. S\u00e1gar stands 1940 feet above sea level, on the N.W. borders of a fine lake nearly a mile broad, from which it derives its name. The lake is said to be an ancient Banj\u00e1ra work, but the present city is only about two centuries old, and owes its rise to a Bundel\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, who built a small fort on the site of the present structure in 1660 A.D., and founded a village called Parkot\u00e1, now a quarter of the modern town. S\u00e1gar was next held by Chhatar S\u00e1l, and formed part of the territory left by him on his death to his ally the Peshw\u00e1. Govind Pandit was appointed by the Peshw\u00e1 to administer the country; and his descendants continued to manage it till shortly before it was ceded to the British Government by Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o in 1818. During this period, the town was twice plundered by the Naw\u00e1b of Tonk and his army, and again by Sindhia in 1804. During the Mutiny of 1857, the town and fort were held by the English for eight months, during which the whole of the surrounding country was in possession of the rebels, until the arrival of Sir Hugh Rose. The town is well built, with wide streets; and the large bathing gh\u00e1ts on the banks of the lake, for the most part surrounded with Hindu temples, add much to its appearance. S\u00e1gar is the entrep\u00f4t of the salt trade with R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and carries on a large trade with M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, importing sugar and kird\u00e1na, or grocery, besides English cloth. The existing fort was completed by the Marhatt\u00e1s about a century ago. It stands on a height north-west of the lake, commanding the whole of the city and surrounding country, and consists of 20 round towers, varying from 20 to 40 feet in height, connected by thick curtain walls. It encloses a space of 6 acres, for the most part covered with old Marhatt\u00e1 buildings two storeys high. The British Government have constructed a magazine, a large building now used for medical stores, and a barrack for the European guard. The only entrance is on the east side. In 1820, a large building was erected for a mint, about a mile east of the lake, where 400 men were employed in coining; but after ten or twelve years, the business was\ntransferred to Calcutta. The building is now used as the office of the Customs Department. Other edifices of importance are a large castellated jail, capable of containing 500 prisoners, situated about half a mile east of the lake, and built in 1846 at a cost of \u00a35000; the Deputy Commissioner's Court, on a hill overlooking the city and lake, built about 1820; the Sessions Court-house, a little to the north, built in 1863 at a cost of \u00a3500; and the city kotw\u00e1li or station-house, under the western walls of the fort, built in 1856. S\u00e1g\u00e1r has a high school, now affiliated to the Calcutta University, established about 1828 by Captain James Paton, of the Bengal Artillery, with the assistance of R\u00e1o Krishna R\u00e1o, a Marhatt\u00e1 gentleman, and a vernacular middle-class school; several indigenous schools, and a girls' school. In 1862, an unhealthy swamp lying north-east of the lake, which cut off the quarter called Gop\u00e1lganj from the rest of the city, was converted into a large garden, with numerous drives and a piece of ornamental water, at a cost of \u00a33000. The civil station begins with the mint, about a mile east of the lake, and extends northwards for a mile, till joined by the military cantonments, which extend in a north-easterly direction for 2\u00bd miles, with the church in the centre. Before the Mutiny, the cantonments were exclusively garrisoned by Native troops, with a detail of European artillery. Since then, however, a European regiment and two batteries of European artillery, with a Native regiment of cavalry and one of infantry, have been stationed at S\u00e1g\u00e1r. The fort contains a large magazine, and depot of medical stores.\n\nS\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor).\u2014Island at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, Bengal. Lat. 21\u00b0 35' 30\" to 21\u00b0 56' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 4' 30\" to 88\u00b0 14' E. A great fair is held on the island in the beginning of January, to which an immense gathering of pilgrims from all parts of India, but especially from Bengal, resort to wash away their sins in the waters of the holy stream. The religious ceremonies last for three days, but the fair is continued for a longer period; and an extensive trade is carried on in articles brought from Calcutta, mats from Eastern Bengal, and stoneware platters and cups principally from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. At other times the island is very sparsely inhabited, though it is said to have been once well peopled. A writer in the Calcutta Review even asserts that 'two years before the foundation of Calcutta it contained a population of 200,000 persons, who in one night, in 1688, were swept away by an inundation.' S\u00e1g\u00e1r Island is now covered with dense jungle, and infested by tigers and other wild beasts. Many attempts have been made to cultivate it, but with small success. The Board of Revenue tried in 1813 to lease it to natives, but the attempt failed, and the island was subsequently taken over by an association composed of Europeans and natives, rent free for thirty years, and at a quit-rent of 1s. 6d. per acre thereafter. Previous to this, the island had been surveyed (1812) and\nfound to contain 143,265 acres of dry land. Sub-leases were afterwards granted to several persons, but their efforts to clear the land were ineffectual. Salt manufacture was conducted on the island for some time, but has been discontinued. The only building of any importance in S\u00e1gar Island\u2014except the temple dedicated to Kapilmuni, to which the pilgrims repair on the occasion of the great bathing festival\u2014is the lighthouse, which was commenced in 1808. The Meteorological Department has an observatory at the telegraph station on the south-west extremity of the island. The telegraph station lies below high-water mark, and is protected by a strong dike. The average rainfall for the four years ending 1871 was 87'61 inches. The cyclone of 1864 caused enormous destruction and loss of life on S\u00e1gar Island. The storm wave, 11 feet above the level of the land, swept over the island with resistless force. At first it was reported that 90 per cent. of the population had perished, but it was afterwards ascertained that 1488 persons survived on the island out of a population, before the cyclone, of 5625.\n\nS\u00e1gar.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Shimoga District, Mysore. Area, 621 square miles, of which 47 are cultivated; pop. (1871), 60,231, of whom 54,917 were Hindus, 1671 Muhammadans, 3542 Jains, and 101 Christians. Land revenue (1874-75), \u00a314,800, or 10s. 2d. per cultivated acre. This t\u00e1luk occupies the most westerly portion of Mysore, broken by the spurs of the Gh\u00e1ts, and in parts only 8 miles distant from the sea. A great part of the area is overgrown with heavy timber-trees, interspersed with grassy glades, amid which wander herds of bison and wild elephant. Products\u2014areca-nut, rice, pepper, and cardamoms.\n\nS\u00e1gar.\u2014Municipal town in Shimoga District, Mysore; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 9' 50\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 4' 20\" E., on the left bank of the Varada river, 40 miles west-north-west of Shimoga town. Headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name. Pop. (1871), 1740; municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a3328; rate of taxation, 3s. 9d. per head. A centre of the areca-nut trade, and the residence of some wealthy merchants. Areca-nut, pepper, sandal-wood, and products of the highlands are exchanged for cotton cloth and other articles from the seaboard.\n\nSagri.\u2014Tahsil of Azamgarh District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the south bank of the river Gogra.

(1872), 249,552; land revenue, \u00a324,946; total Government revenue, \u00a327,457; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a363,807.\n\nSagrwha.\u2014Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Pop. (1872), 5643.\n\nSah\u00e1r\u00e1npur.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 29\u00b0 34' 45\" and 30\u00b0 21' 20\" N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 9' and 78\u00b0 14' 45\" E. long. Area, 2219\nsquare miles; population in 1872, 884,017 souls. Saharanpur is a District in the Meerut (Mirath) Division. It is bounded on the north by the Siwalik Hills, which separate it from Dehra Dun; on the east by the Ganges; on the south by the District of Muzaffarnagar; and on the west by the river Jumna (Jamuna). The administrative headquarters are at Saharanpur City.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Saharanpur forms the most northerly portion of the Do\u00e1b or alluvial tableland which stretches between the valleys of the Ganges and the Jumna. The Siwalik Hills rise above it on the northern frontier. Their slopes are rugged and abrupt, pierced by numerous passes, many of whose gorges have never yet been explored, and crowned by jagged summits which often assume the most fantastic shapes. At their base stretches a wild submontane tract, overgrown with forest or jungle, and intersected by innumerable mountain torrents, which leap foaming down from the hills on their way to join the great channels of the Jumna and the Ganges. The two main arterial streams themselves descend into the plain through wild and magnificent ravines, which rapidly give way to high banks of clay, as the rivers pass from the mountain region into the level tableland below. South of the intermediate forest belt lies the general plain of the Do\u00e1b, an elevated upland tract, in whose friable soil the great rivers have cut themselves wide and shifting courses, at a depth of some 60 feet below the general surface. The broad valleys thus excavated are naturally well watered and fertile; but the great central plateau lies high and dry, with a general elevation of 900 feet above the sea, while numberless small ravines drain off its scanty moisture towards the low land on either side. The highest cultivation has, nevertheless, been rendered possible throughout the District by two splendid engineering achievements, the Ganges and the Eastern Jumna Canals (qq. v.), both of which take their origin within the boundaries of Saharanpur. The latter work was originally planned and in part executed by Ali Mardan Khan, the celebrated minister of Shah Jah\u00e1n, but it was not finally completed till the year 1830. The difficulties attending the upper part seem to have been beyond the resources of Musalm\u00e1n engineering, and the canal is believed to have never flowed beyond one season until its reconstruction by the British under Sir P. Cautley, R.E. Colonel Colvin believes that 'the task of maintaining the passage across the mountain torrents at its head was found to be so great, that the canal was abandoned (by its native projectors) almost as soon as formed, and that the repeated attempts at reparation afterwards were only efficient for a season, and were overcome by the increasing difficulties.' The Eastern Jumna canal, as it now exists, is entirely a work of British engineering. The Ganges Canal was opened in 1855. Both these canals run through the whole length of the District, from north to south, and have\nconverted large portions of its central plateau into stretches of unbroken cultivation. The District is everywhere thickly studded with flourishing villages and populous towns. The waste lands are small in amount, except in the hilly northern region; and cultivation is spreading on every side, under the fostering influence of peaceful Government, and the successful issue of the irrigation schemes. The general aspect of the country is indicative of steady progress and comparative wealth, though the land is still capable of bearing a considerable increase of population without undue pressure on its resources.\n\nHistory.\u2014The portion of the Do\u00e1b in which Sah\u00e1ranpur is situated was probably one of the first regions of Upper India occupied by the Aryan colonists as they spread eastward from their original settlement in the Punjab. But the legends of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata centre around the city of Hast\u00ednapur, in the neighbouring District of Meerut; and it is not till the 14th century of our era that we learn any historical details with regard to Sah\u00e1ranpur itself. The town was founded in the reign of Muhammad Tughlak, about the year 1340 A.D., and derived its name from a Musalm\u00e1n saint, Sh\u00e1h Haran Chishti, whose shrine is still an object of attraction to Muhamadan devotees. At the close of the century, we learn that the surrounding country was exposed to the ravages of Timur, who passed through it on his return from the sack of Delhi, and subjected the Hindu inhabitants to all the usual horrors of a Mughal invasion. In the year 1414, the tract was conferred by Sult\u00e1n Sayyid Khizr Kh\u00e1n on Sayyid Salim; and in 1526, B\u00e1bar marched across it on his way to P\u00e1nipat. A few Mughal colonies still trace their origin to his followers. A year later, the town of Gangoh was founded by the zealous missionary Abdul Kadd\u00fas, whose efforts were the means of converting to the faith of Isl\u00e1m many of his R\u00e1jput and Guj\u00e1r neighbours. His descendants ruled the District until the reign of Akbar, and were very influential in strengthening the Musalm\u00e1n element by their constant zeal in proselytizing. During the Augustan age of the Mughal Empire, Sah\u00e1ranpur was a favourite summer resort of the court and the nobles, who were attracted alike by the coolness of its climate and the facilities which it offered for sport. The famous empress N\u00far Mah\u00e1l, the consort of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, had a palace in the village which still perpetuates her memory by its name of N\u00farnagar; and under Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, the royal hunting seat of B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Mah\u00e1l was erected by Al\u00ed Mardan Kh\u00e1n, the projector of the Eastern Jumna Canal. Unhappily the canal was permitted to fall into disuse during the long and disastrous decline of the Mughal power, and it was never of much practical utility until the establishment of British rule. After the death of Aurangzeb, this region suffered, like the rest of Upper India, from the constant inroads of warlike tribes and the domestic feuds of its own princes. The first\nincursion of the Sikhs took place in 1709, under the weakening hold of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h; and for eight successive years their wild hordes kept pouring ceaselessly into the Do\u00e1b, repulsed time after time, yet ever returning in greater numbers, to massacre the hated Muhammadans and turn their territory into a wilderness. The Sikhs did not even confine their barbarities to their Musalm\u00e1n foes, but murdered and pillaged the Hindu community with equal violence. In 1716, however, the Mughal court mustered strength enough to repel the invaders for a time; and it was not until the utter decay of all authority that the Sikhs once more appeared upon the scene. Meanwhile the Upper Do\u00e1b passed into the hands of the Sayyid brothers of B\u00e1rha, whose rule was more intimately connected with the neighbouring District of MUZAFFARNAGAR. On their fall in 1721, their possessions were conferred upon various favourites in turn, until in 1754 they were granted by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni to Najib Kh\u00e1n, a Rohill\u00e1 leader, as a reward for his services at the battle of Kotila. This energetic ruler made the best of his advantages, and before his death (1770), had extended his dominions to the north of the Siwaliks on one side, and as far south as Meerut on the other. But the end of his rule was disturbed by incursions of the two great aggressive races from opposite quarters, the Sikhs and the Marhatt\u00e1s. Najib Kh\u00e1n handed down his authority to his son, Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n, who at first revolted from the feeble court of Delhi; but on being conquered by Marhatt\u00e1 aid, was glad to receive back his fief through the kind offices of his former enemies, then supreme in the councils of the Empire. During the remainder of his life, Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n was continually engaged in repelling the attacks of the Sikhs, who could never forgive him for his reconciliation with the imperial party. Under his son, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir (1785), the District enjoyed comparative tranquillity. The Sikhs were firmly held in check, and a strong government was established over the native chieftains. But upon the death of its last Rohill\u00e1 prince, who was mutilated and killed by Sindhia in 1788, the country fell into the hands of the Marhatt\u00e1s, and remained in their possession until the British conquest. Their rule was very precarious, owing to the perpetual raids made by the Sikhs; and they were at one time compelled to call in the aid of George Thomas, the daring military adventurer who afterwards established an independent government in Hari\u00e1na. Indeed, the internal quarrels of this confused period are too complicated for brief narration, and it must suffice to say that the country remained practically in the hands of the Sikhs, who levied black-mail under the pretence of collecting revenue. After the fall of ALIGARH and the capture of Delhi (1803), a British force was despatched to reduce Sah\u00e1ranpur. Here, for a time, a double warfare was kept up against the Marhatt\u00e1s on one side and the Sikhs on the other. The latter were defeated in the indecisive battle of Char\u00e1on (24th November\nbut still continued their irregular raids for some years. Organization, however, was quietly pushed forward, and the District enjoyed a short season of comparative tranquillity, until the death of the largest landowner, R\u00e1m D\u00e1yal Sinh, in 1813. The resumption of his immense estates gave rise to a Guj\u00e1r revolt, which was put down before it had assumed very serious dimensions. A more dangerous disturbance took place in 1824; a confederacy on a large scale was planned among the native chiefs, and a rising of the whole Do\u00e1b might have occurred had not the premature eagerness of the rebels disclosed their design. As it was, the revolt was only suppressed by a sanguinary battle, which ended in the total defeat of the insurgents and the fall of their ringleaders.\n\nFrom that period till the Mutiny, no events of importance disturbed the quiet course of civil administration in Sah\u00e1ranpur. News of the rising at Meerut was received early in May 1857, and the European women and children were immediately despatched to the hills. Measures were taken for the defence of the officers, and a garrison of European civil servants established themselves in the Magistrate's house. The District soon broke out into irregular rebellion; but the turbulent spirit was shown rather in the form of internecine quarrels amongst the native leaders than of any settled opposition to British government. Old feuds sprang up anew; villages returned to their ancient enmities; bankers were robbed, and money-lenders pillaged; yet the local officers continued to exercise many of their functions, and to punish the chief offenders by ordinary legal process. On the 2nd of June, a portion of the Native infantry at Sah\u00e1ranpur mutinied and fired upon their officers, but without effect. Shortly after, a small body of G\u00farkhas arrived, by whose assistance order was partially restored. As early as December 1857, it was found practicable to proceed with the regular assessment of the District, and the natives appeared to be civil and respectful. In fact, the mutiny in Sah\u00e1ranpur was merely an outbreak of the old predatory anarchy, which had not yet been extirpated by our industrial r\u00e9gime, and there was little indication of any popular aversion to British rule.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The earliest Census, which gives the population of the District with its present area, was that of 1853; the number of inhabitants then amounted to 801,325, or 370 to the square mile. By 1865, the population had increased to 869,176, or 389 to the square mile. In 1872, the enumeration disclosed a further increase to 884,017 persons, or 399 to the square mile. At the same date, there were 1736 villages, or an average of 0\u00b78 village to the square mile and 509 inhabitants to each village. The native population was thus classified according to sex\u2014males, 484,508; females, 399,274: proportion of males, 54\u00b78 per cent. The preponderance of males is chiefly due to the former prevalence of infanticide, a practice which all the vigilance of\nthe Government has not yet been able entirely to check. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males, 200,078; females, 154,103; total children, 354,181, or 42.3% per cent. In the religious division of the people, 604,422 were returned as Hindus, and 279,015 as Musalm\u00e1ns; there is thus about one Muhammadan to every two Hindus, the exact percentages being 31.6 and 68.4 respectively; Christians and \u2018others\u2019 numbered 345. Amongst the Hindus, the Census of 1872 returns 45,148 as Br\u00e1hmans. The R\u00e1jputs are reckoned at 27,420, of whom only 10,564 are females. They are suspected of infanticide, and in many villages the provisions of the Infanticide Act are strictly enforced. In physique, the R\u00e1jputs are a fine hardy race, but their lawless and turbulent spirit has given much trouble. The Banias or trading classes were returned at 36,694, amongst whom the Agarw\u00e1las form by far the largest subdivision. But the great mass of the population belongs to the classes enumerated in the Census returns as \u2018other castes.\u2019 Of these, there were 495,160 persons in 1872. The most numerous of them were the Cham\u00e1rs, reckoned at 158,859. Next in number come the G\u00fajars, a race of supposed Tartar origin, almost peculiar to the northern Do\u00e1b, who are returned at 53,576. They are a turbulent race, addicted to cattle-lifting. The Musalm\u00e1ns are partly descendants of the various early invaders, partly native converts from Hinduism. Amongst the former, the Sayyids, Mughals, and Path\u00e1ns are the most numerous. Those of Hindu origin still retain many of their old practices and prejudices, while their trade-classes are assuming the rigid character of castes. The religious opinions of the people have been much shaken by the influences of civilisation, but Christianity has made little progress amongst them, nor does the faith of Isl\u00e1m now gain many converts. There were 9 towns at the last Census with a population (1872) exceeding 5000, namely\u2014Landhaura, 5118; Ambahta, 6336; Rurki, 7588; Rampur, 8464; Jawalapur, 9665; Manglaur, 10,206; Gangoh, 10,899; Deoband, 21,714; and Saharanpur, 44,119. The total urban population accordingly amounted in 1872 to 124,099. Hardwar, on the Ganges, is a place of great sanctity, and is largely frequented for the bathing festivals. In 1872, 312,846 persons were returned as engaged in agriculture, and 570,936 as otherwise employed. The language in ordinary use is Urdu.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The rabi or spring harvest is sown in October, and reaped in March; and the khartf or rain harvest is sown in June, and gathered in October. The chief spring products are wheat and barley (284,309 acres in 1872), pulses (59,055 acres), and oil-seeds (49,064 acres). The staples of the rain crops are rice (86,731 acres), jo\u00e1r and bajra (71,447 acres), and vegetables. The cultivation of cotton was carried on very largely during the prevalence of high prices caused by\nthe American war; but in 1872, the area under cotton had shrunk to 46,178 acres. Indigo, on the contrary, has been grown in greater quantities since the introduction of canal irrigation has rendered its out-turn less precarious than formerly. Cereals are, however, the principal products of the total cultivated area. The irrigation system of the District is very fully developed, chiefly through the agency of the two great canals. In 1870, out of a total cultivated area amounting to 736,873 acres, 162,317 acres were irrigated; and of these, 84,404 acres, or more than one-half, were watered from canals alone. The condition of the peasantry is comfortable; but many of the Musalm\u00e1n proprietors, in their disdain of personal toil, have carried subdivision of shares to such an excess that they have sunk into a position more impecunious than that of the labouring class. Until lately, the non-proprietary cultivators held their lands by customary tenure, at low fixed rates, which were not liable to enhancement; but the zamindars have now begun to exercise their legal right of raising the rent, and the labourers are fast losing their customary privileges. Rents are still to a great extent payable in kind; in 1870, 66 per cent. of the tenants paid in cash. The best lands bring in from 10s. 6d. to 12s. an acre, the poorest are let at from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 6d.; average rates, from 7s. 6d. to 9s. Many estates have been transferred to new proprietors since the Mutiny; and, unfortunately, in a large number of cases they have fallen into the hands of money-lenders, who are usually absenteees, and make very indifferent landlords. Wages have risen about 60 per cent. during the past ten years, owing to the large demand for labour on the canals and railway and at the R\u00farki workshops. In 1874, bricklayers and carpenters received from 7\u00bdd. to 9d. per diem; blacksmiths, 7\u00bdd.; common labourers, from 2\u00bdd. to 3d. The ordinary prices of food grains in 1870 were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 17 sers the rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 25 sers the rupee, or 4s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt.; jodr, 30 sers the rupee, or 3s. 8\u00bdd. per cwt.; gram, 20\u00bd sers the rupee, or 5s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The capricious rainfall in the mountain tract to the north often causes sudden floods on the Ganges and the Jumna, yet inundations of importance seldom occur. Villages, however, are sometimes transferred from one bank to the other by shifting of the channel, as many as 330 being liable to fluvial action in some one or other of its forms. Drought visits the District with great severity; famines due to this cause having occurred in 1837, in 1860, and in 1868-69. On the last occasion, almost all the autumn crops were lost, except in the irrigated region, the area of which exceptionally increased by 40,995 acres. In July and August 1869, the price of jodr and bajra rose as high as 8 sers the rupee, or 14s. per cwt. Relief measures were undertaken early in that year, and for 77 days an average of 2948 persons were employed upon famine works, while 161 persons received\ngratuitous aid at poorhouses. These figures show that the distress was not nearly so severe as in neighbouring Districts. The opening of the Sind Punjab and Delhi Railway, during the scarcity, contributed to allay the danger of starvation. The spread of irrigation has done much to secure Sah\u00e1ranpur from the extremity of famine in future years; while, as regards communications, it compares favourably with any District in the North-Western Provinces.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commerce of Sah\u00e1ranpur is chiefly confined to its raw materials, and especially to food grains, in which it possesses a thriving and increasing trade. Its manufactures consist of coarse cloth, jewellery, and sweetmeats. The R\u00farki workshops, under Government control, employ 1069 hands, and brought in a net revenue of \u00a35960 in 1870. Among the articles produced are steam-engines, pumps, printing presses, lathes, and mathematical instruments. Besides its direct value as a source of income, this establishment is of great importance as a training school for native artisans. The Thomason Civil Engineering College, also situated at R\u00farki, is a most useful institution; in 1871, no fewer than 112 students qualified for the public service. A botanical garden was established at the town of Sah\u00e1ranpur in 1817, and has proved eminently successful, both from a scientific point of view and in the practical work of naturalizing useful plants and trees, especially tea and cinchona. The District is well supplied with means of communication. The grand trunk line of the Delhi and Punjab Railway runs for a distance of 41 miles within its boundaries, with stations at Deoband, Sah\u00e1ranpur, and 'Sars\u00e1wa. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway will form a junction with the Punjab line at Sah\u00e1ranpur. There are also several excellent metalled roads, one of which leads by a tunnelled passage to Dehra. Much traffic passes by the Ganges Canal. The Thomason College contains an English printing press, and there is one native lithographic press in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1806, the land revenue amounted to \u00a333,522; in 1850, it had risen to \u00a3105,844; and in 1872, it had reached the sum of \u00a3117,295. The increase is due in part to the benefits derived from canal irrigation. The other principal items of revenue are stamps, excise, income tax, and canal dues. The District is under the civil jurisdiction of the munstfs of Sah\u00e1ranpur and Deoband, from both of whom appeals lie to the Judge of Sah\u00e1ranpur. In 1874, there were 10 stipendiary and 3 honorary magistrates, most of whom were also charged with fiscal duties. The District contained 10 civil and 4 magisterial courts in 1870. The regular police in 1873 numbered 843 officers and men, or 1 policeman to every 2\u00b764 square miles and every 1048 inhabitants. The cost was \u00a39537, of which sum \u00a37139 were defrayed from provincial revenue. The regular force was supplemented by 1624 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), or 1 to every 447 inhabitants.\nIn the same year, 1483 persons were convicted for all offences, being 1 person in every 595 of the population. Saharanpur contains one jail, the average daily number of prisoners in which was 216 in 1870, or 0.025 per cent. of the population. The Muhammadan prisoners numbered 231, and the Hindus, 447. The cost per inmate was \u00a34, 12s. 5\u00bdd., and the average earnings of each prisoner were 14s. 2\u00bdd. Education has been spreading slowly of late years. In 1860, there were 399 schools, with 5639 pupils, taught at a cost of \u00a31559. In 1871, the number of schools had fallen to 381; but these had a total roll of 7934 children, while the sum expended on education had risen to \u00a33674. There is an excellent school in connection with the American Presbyterian Mission, and the towns of Deoband and Saharanpur are noted for their superior Arabic and Persian schools.\n\nThe District is divided into 4 tahsils and 15 parganas, which contained 1916 estates in 1872, owned by 3875 registered proprietors or coparceners. Each estate paid an average revenue of \u00a361, 4s., and each proprietor an average of \u00a330, 4s. The District contains three municipalities, Saharanpur, Deoband, and Hardwar Union. In 1875-76, their aggregate revenue amounted to \u00a310,648, and their expenditure to \u00a39584. The average incidence of municipal taxation was 1s. 8\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Saharanpur is the same as that of the Do\u00e1b generally, modified by its northern position and the cool breezes from the neighbouring hill country. The cold weather arrives earlier and lasts longer than in the lower Districts, but the summer months are tropical in their excessive heat. The mean temperature in 1872 was as follows:\u2014January, 57\u00b0 F.; February, 59\u00b0 F.; March, 73\u00b0 F.; April, 81\u00b0; May, 88\u00b0 F.; June, 90\u00b0 F.; July, 83\u00b0 F.; August, 83\u00b0 F.; September, 81\u00b0 F.; October, 75\u00b0 F.; November, 66\u00b0 F.; December, 59\u00b0 F. The total rainfall was 49.4 inches in 1867-68; 20.2 inches in 1868-69 (the year of scarcity); 21.6 in 1869-70; and 40.1 in 1870-71. Fever and small-pox are the principal diseases of the District. The reported death-rate in 1873 was 23.81 per thousand.\n\nSaharanpur.\u2014North-western tahsil of Saharanpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying between the Siw\u00e1lik Hills and the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1); watered by the Eastern Jumna Canal, and traversed by the Sind Punjab and Delhi Railway. Area, 618 square miles, of which 328 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 253,371; land revenue, \u00a333,151; total Government revenue, \u00a336,565; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a353,924.\n\nSaharanpur.\u2014Municipal city and administrative headquarters of Saharanpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 58' 15\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 35' 15\" E., on a low site on both sides of the Damaula Nadi. Pop. (1872), 43,844, consisting of 19,528 Hindus,\n24,296 Muhammadans, and 20 Christians and 'others.' Station on the Sind Punjab and Delhi Railway. Well-built town, with many brick houses. The principal market-place is a busy spot. Mission of the American Presbyterian Church. Important Government botanical gardens, which have proved useful in promoting the acclimatization of valuable plants. Dispensary, schools, post office, telegraph office, jail, police station. Headquarters of Jumna Canal establishment. Old Rohill\u00e1 fort, used as a court-house. Handsome new mosque, lately erected by the Muhammadan community, who form a very influential body, and include several Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. English church, consecrated 1858. Hotel and travellers' bungalow near the railway station. Point of departure from rail for passengers to Mussooree (Mas\u00far\u00ed), who crowd the town at the beginning and end of the hot season. Principal station in the trigonometrical survey of the Him\u00e1layas. Elevation above sea level, 902 feet. Malarious diseases prevail, owing to the neighbourhood of a swamp; but draining operations conducted in 1870 have greatly lessened the evil. Considerable trade in grain, sugar, molasses, and country cloth. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a35486; from taxes, \u00a34867, or 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population (45,051) within municipal limits.\n\n**Sah\u00e1spur (Sahispur).**\u2014Town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 7' 40\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 40' 15\" E., on the Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Hardw\u00e1r road, 28 miles south-east of Bijnaur town. Pop. (1872), 6309.\n\n**Sah\u00e1sw\u00e1n.\u2014Tahsil** and town in Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Sah\u00edswan.\n\n**Sah\u00e1war.**\u2014Town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 5156, consisting of 2579 Hindus and 2577 Muhammadans. Police station, school, post office. Founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Naurang Deb, a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput, who called it Naurang\u00e1b\u00e1d after his own name. On being attacked by the Musalm\u00e1ns, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 fled to Sirhpura, and the inhabitants who remained were forcibly converted to Isl\u00e1m. Shortly after, Naurang, assisted by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and people of Sirhpura, expelled the Musalm\u00e1ns, and changed the name of the town to Sah\u00e1war. The place is now far from flourishing; small local b\u00e1z\u00e1r, bad communications. Tomb of Faj-ud-d\u00edn, a fak\u00edr, forms the only object of interest. Local income in 1873-74, \u00a395.\n\n**Sahet Mahe\u1e6d (or Sr\u00e1vasti).**\u2014A vast collection of ruins in Gonda District, Oudh; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 31' N., and long. 82\u00b0 5' E., on the south bank of the R\u00e1pti river, 10 miles from Balr\u00e1mpur, and 6 from Ikauna. These ruins have been identified by General Cunningham as the remains of the ancient city of Sr\u00e1vasti, whose site had been conjecturally fixed by Lassen within a few miles of the spot, but on the opposite bank of the river. The following account of these\ninteresting ruins is quoted from an account by Mr. W. C. Benett, C.S., in the Oudh Gazetteer, pp. 281-286. It is not necessary to agree with all Mr. Benett's dates and statements, in order to appreciate his work. See also General Cunningham's Geography of Ancient India, pp. 407-414 (ed. 1871).\n\nThe foundation of the city is attributed to Sr\u00e1vasta, an old king of the Solar race, the ninth in descent from Manu, at a time beside which the most ancient myths are comparatively modern. From him was derived the name Sr\u00e1vasti, which appears in the Pr\u00e1krit forms S\u00e1wattha, S\u00e1wanta, and Shr\u00e1vanta, and has since been corrupted into Sahet. Though the words do not at first look alike, it is probable that the names of the river and the town, Sahet Mahet and R\u00e1pti, were once the same, viz. Shar\u00e1vati, and derived from Savitri, the sun-god. At the mythical era of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, Sr\u00e1vasti was the capital of Uttar Kus\u00e1la, the northern province of R\u00e1ma's empire, which, on the division of the kingdom at the death of that hero, fell to the share of his son Lava. At the commencement of the historical age, in the 6th century before Christ, we find it still one of the six principal kingdoms of Madhyadesa or Central Hindust\u00e1n. It was then bounded on the south by Saketa, or Ajodhya, and on the east by Vaishali, the modern Behar and Benares; so it probably contained at least the present Districts of Bahr\u00e1ich, Gonda, Basti, and Gorakhpur. The king, Parasen\u00e1ditya, who is given in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1na as great-grandson of Buddha, and who was very probably connected in race with the princely prophet, was an early convert to the new faith, and invited its founder to the Kalandaka Vih\u00e1ra in the Venuvana at Sr\u00e1vasti. Here, or in Ajodhya, Buddha spent the greater number of the rainy seasons, during which he used to rest from his missionary labours; nor did he finally leave the place till he started on that journey to Bengal which ended in his attainment of nirv\u00e1na. During his lifetime, Sudatta, the prime minister, built the Jetavana, a magnificent monastery, whose ruins lie to the south-west of the capital. On the death of Parasen\u00e1ditya, his son Virudh\u00e1ka succeeded, and showed himself a bitter enemy to the faith; he crowned many acts of oppression by including 500 Buddhist virgins in his harem. For this it was predicted that on the seventh day he should be consumed by fire. To falsify the prophecy, he and his court spent the day in boats on the pond to the south of the city; but the waters fled back, the earth yawned, and the guilty monarch disappeared in a supernatural flame.\n\nFrom this time, Sr\u00e1vasti remained one of the principal seats of Buddhist learning; and 12 centuries afterwards, the Chinese pilgrim collected with reverence the traditions of his faith which lingered round the sacred city. At the end of the 2nd century B.C., Rahulata, the sixteenth of the Buddhist patriarchs, died here after having imparted his\nsecret lore to the king's son, Sanghananadi; and at the fourth Buddhist Synod, convened by the so-called Emperor Kanishka, the Jetavana furnished one of the three principal sects of Sthaviras or Buddhist doctors.\n\n'The greatest political importance ever reached by this State was in the reign of Vikram\u00e1ditya, who, in the middle of the 2nd century A.D., overthrew the mightiest king in India, the Ghav\u00e1hana of Kashmir; and as ruler of a vast dominion stretching from Pesh\u00e1war to M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and from M\u00e1lw\u00e1 to Bengal, assumed with some show of right the title of Emperor of Jambudirpa or the Indian continent. Contrary to the traditions of his capital, he was a bigoted adherent of the Br\u00e1hmanical religion; and the legends connected with his rebuilding of the sacred places at Ajodhya and Debi P\u00e1tan show how low the fortunes of that creed had fallen in these parts when he lent it his powerful support. Both were a complete jungle, and he restored the localities of the birth of R\u00e1ma and of his passage to heaven by measurements from the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. His identifications probably are the base of the topography of the present day. The remains of this monarch's tank and temple still exist at Debi P\u00e1tan. His death appears to have been followed by open disputes between the rival faiths; and the story that a distinguished Buddhist, Vasubandhu, worsted the Br\u00e1hmans in argument, may refer to a more material victory, especially as we find that his still more distinguished predecessor, Man or Nita, had been worsted in argument by the Br\u00e1hmans under the Br\u00e1hman Vikram\u00e1ditya.\n\n'The Ajodhya tradition,' says Mr. Benett, 'preserves the correct story of the fall of this dynasty. It relates that after a glorious reign of eighty years, Vikram\u00e1ditya was visited by a Jogi, Samudra P\u00e1l, who, after exhibiting several remarkable miracles, induced the monarch to allow his spirit to be temporarily transferred to a corpse. The royal body was no sooner vacant than Samudra P\u00e1l projected his own spirit into it, and refused to evacuate. By this disreputable trick, he obtained the throne of Ajodhya and Sr\u00e1vasti, which he and his descendants retained for 17 generations. The fact contained in this singular legend is that Samudra Gupta, who reigned for the first forty years of the 3rd century A.D., overthrew the local dynasty and himself reigned in their stead. The period of eighty years, as the duration of the rule of Vikram\u00e1ditya and his descendants, is exceedingly probable; and it is singular, though much weight cannot be attached to the coincidence, that from Samudra Gupta to Gay\u00e1ditya, the last of the Aditya monarchs of Kanauj, there are exactly seventeen names of the great Vaisya Emperors who governed Northern India.\n\n'The Chinese pilgrims did not, of course, omit to visit so sacred a city. Fa-Hian in the commencement of the 5th century found it inhabited by 200 poor families, and the grand building in decay; and\n150 years later, when Hiouen Thsang arrived, the desolation was complete, and only a few monks haunted the ruins.\n\nIt was destined, however, to recover for a while before it finally disappeared from history; and it is here that I must refer to its connection with the origin of a third religion, that of the Jains. The third of their Tirthank\u00e1ras, Shambh\u00fa N\u00e1th, was born at S\u00e1watthi; both his immediate predecessors and both successors were born at the neighbouring city of Ajodhya. There is still a small Jain temple dedicated to Sobh\u00e1 N\u00e1th. I have no doubt that Sobh\u00e1 N\u00e1th and Shambh\u00fa N\u00e1th, S\u00e1watthi and Sr\u00e1vasti, are the same, and that this was the birthplace of the third Tirthank\u00e1ra. The eighth of these supernatural beings was born at Chandripur, and this place is always identified in local tradition with Sahet Mahet, as I shall have occasion to remark when I come to the Mah\u00e1bhdrata legend. Since the best authorities differ by about 1500 years as to the probable date of these patriarchs, and their very existence is a fair subject for doubt, I shall not venture to conjecture on their connection with the rise of a strong Jain kingdom in the 9th and 10th centuries. Of this dynasty little more is known than of that of Vikram\u00e1ditya; one great victory throws them into the full light of history, and an interesting legend accounts for their downfall. Local tradition gives the following list of names:\u2014(1) M\u00e1yura Dhw\u00e1ja; (2) Hansa Dhw\u00e1ja; (3) Makara Dhw\u00e1ja; (4) Sudhanya Dhw\u00e1ja; (5) Suhiral or Suhel Deo or Dal. These are diversely reputed to have been either Th\u00e1rus, or of some R\u00e1jput house. Considering the almost certain origin of the modern R\u00e1jputs, the two accounts may both be true; but, as they were Jains, some confusion about their caste is easily intelligible. What is utterly baffling is that the second and fourth are the heroes of one of the episodes of the Drigvij\u00e1ya section of the Mah\u00e1bhdrata. The only monarch who is really historical is the last, whose capital was at Sr\u00e1vasti, and who had a fort at Asokpur or Hat\u00edla or Raza, about half-way on the road between Gonda and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The tradition connecting him with Dumhria Dih is clearly transferred from the recollections of the subsequent Dom dynasty. When S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad crossed the Gogra, he met Suhel Dal at Hat\u00edla, and the Jains were apparently defeated, though the place is still reverenced as the scene of the martyrdom of a distinguished Muhammadan officer. The invaders pushed to the north, and, if tradition is to be believed, fought another great battle under the walls of Sahet Mahet, which contains the tomb of another martyr. Finally, after a long occupation of the country, the decisive battle was fought at Bahr\u00e1\u00edch, where the Musalm\u00e1ns were completely exterminated. In the indecisive conflicts and prolonged encampment in a hostile country, in all, in fact, but its denouement, the story bears a strong resemblance to that of the Path\u00e1n conquest of Utraula in the time of Sult\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h S\u00far. It is said that only about forty years after this victory the\nJain house fell. The last king, whose name is not given, was passionately devoted to the chase, and returned one evening just as the sun was setting. It would have been a sin to eat after sunset, and the queen, in order to secure the royal supper, sent up to the roof the exceedingly beautiful wife of his younger brother. The experiment succeeded, and the sun stayed to enjoy the sight as long as she stood there. When the feast was over, she descended, and the sun at once disappeared. The astonished king inquired the cause, and was determined to see with his own eyes the wonder-working beauty. His incestuous passion was punished by the ruin of his State, and amidst a terrific storm the whole city was turned bottom upwards. The modern name Sahet Mahet, says the legend, is descriptive of this inversion. This story is valuable as putting beyond reasonable doubt the first religion to which these kings belonged\u2014the inability to eat after sunset, which is the point on which the whole turns, being derived from the Jain reluctance to sacrifice insect life.\n\n'The chronology is also not without its value, and I have no doubt points to the conquest of the country by the first of the great Rahtor kings of Kanauj, Sri Chandradeva. In the last half of the 11th century, he made a pilgrimage to Ajodhya and Kusala (i.e. Gonda); and with a Kshattriya prince, pilgrimage is often another word for military expedition\u2014'na Kshattriya ka bhagat na musal ka dhanuk'\u2014'you cannot make a saint of a Kshattriya, or a bow of a rice pestle.' An inscription of his descendant, the ill-starred Jai Chandra, has been found at Ajodhya.\n\n'With the Ghori conquest of India, the history of Sahet Mahet comes absolutely to an end, and it only remains for me to notice one more local legend. Everywhere in the neighbourhood, it is told that the real name of the city before its overthrow was Chandrikapuri or Chandripur; and that it was here that Hansa Dhwaja reigned, and Arjuna gained his very unheroic victory over the brave and beautiful Sudhania.\n\n'All that now remains of this once famous city is the great fortress on the banks of the Rapti, with a smaller ruin to the south-west, a lofty mound due south on the Balrampur and Bahrach roads, and numerous small piles of bricks, probably the remains of ancient stupas, scattered here and there within a distance of 2 miles of the main city. The fortress is in shape a semicircular crescent, with the concave side facing the river, and is completely surrounded by solid brick walls, the highest remains being to the west, where the ruins of the river bastion are still 50 feet in height. The ordinary walls vary from a greatest elevation of 40 feet on the western front to a lowest of 20 feet along the east and south-east. The interior is covered with jungle, so dense in parts as hardly to admit of the passage of an elephant,\nand broken into undulations by the remains of temples and palaces underneath. All the principal buildings were in the western half, and it is there that the undergrowth is the thickest, only ceasing along two or three broad streets which have been left bare, and indicate the chief features of the old city. The main street runs right through the centre, and is built so as to command a view of the great mound Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r from one end to the other. To the south it debouches by one of the principal gateways; and at the north it ends in a small square, containing among other lofty remains the two principal mounds, which may be identified with the Sudatt\u00e1s house and the Angulimati, a stupa mentioned by Hiouen Thsang. The dense brushwood, and the possibility that the city which he saw may have been considerably altered by the later Jain dynasty, renders the application of that traveller's descriptions a difficult and hazardous task; but I am inclined to conjecture that his palace of Parasen\u00e1ditya was situated among the mounds of the south-eastern corner, where now stands the small Jain temple. The next principal building mentioned by him, both in his Life and in the Si-yu-ki, is the Hall of the Law built by that monarch for Buddha, which would have been situated between the palace and the main street, while Prajapati's Vih\u00e1ra would have formed the whole or part of the long and even line of buildings which face the west of the street. The north-west corner of the ruin contains a large open space with a small pond in its centre, and a nearly straight road running from it to another southern gateway, and converging with the main street on the Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r. The eastern half has no very important remains, though the surface is broken everywhere with the d\u00e9bris of houses, and it was here probably that the common people had their quarters. The walls are pierced with numerous gateways, the principal being at either end of the main street and the north-eastern bastion, and in the middle and southern corner of the west wall. At the distance of half a mile from the south-west gate, and separated from the main town by swamps, which probably mark the course of the old moat, is another considerable ruin, identified by Hiouen Thsang with the old Jet\u00e1vana, one of the most famous monasteries in India. It is a singular fact that this feature is exactly reproduced in the remains of R\u00e1ngi in R\u00e1i Bareli, where a similar oblong ruin lies at the same distance and direction from the main town. The remainder of the Chinese pilgrim's measurements seem to have been taken from this point; but it is difficult to select among the numerous mounds the remains of the great Vih\u00e1ra and its rival the idol temple. Nearly a mile to the east of the Jet\u00e1vana is the high congeries of bricks known, as is the Mani Parbat at Ajodhya, by the name Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r or \"basket shakings,\" and supposed to be the place where R\u00e1ma's labourers emptied out their baskets of earth. This is identified with\nsome probability by General Cunningham with the Purvavarama built by the lady Vaisakha in honour of Buddha. The top is protected by the tombs of two Muhammadan saints, but General Cunningham cleared one of the sides, and found four pilasters of an exceedingly ancient style of architecture. From the fact that two of the chief thoroughfares of the city so converge as to command a view of this mound, I should conjecture that it was more ancient than the plan of the present remains, and consequently one of the oldest monuments left in the neighbourhood. As yet very little is known of this very interesting ruin, which must contain relics that would do much to elucidate some of the darkest and most interesting periods of Indian history. I was once able to spend a few days in excavating, and dug more than 20 feet deep into the crown of the Angulimata stupa; but beyond disclosing a square building of 24 feet each way, with a partition wall down the centre, and a second wall running all round the building at a distance of 4 feet, I discovered nothing of interest. It is somewhat difficult to get labourers, as the neighbouring villagers have a superstitious dread of interfering with the old city, and will not even enter it after sunset. A storm of thunder and lightning, which came on when I encamped there on a second occasion, was interpreted as a manifest token of the demons' displeasure with the man who had violated their haunts.\n\nSahibganj.\u2014Town in the Santal Parganas District, Bengal; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 14' 30\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 40' 3\" E., on the deep channel of the Ganges, which at all seasons runs close under the town, and contiguous to the station on the loop-line of the East Indian Railway. Owing to its favourable position, Sahibganj has become of late years a great depot for the exchange of traffic between the river and the rail, and has attracted to itself trade before localised at Bhagalpur, Pirpainti, Rajmahal, and other marts of less note. In 1876-77, the total registered trade of Sahibganj was valued at more than \u00a3450,000, including exports, imports, and in many cases re-exportations. Local produce is received by river from the trans-Gangetic tracts of North Maldah, Purniah, and Bhagalpur; while European goods come up by rail from Calcutta, to be distributed in the same Districts. In 1876-77, the principal items under the former head were\u2014indigo, \u00a336,000; oil-seeds, \u00a338,000; rice, \u00a328,000; hides and stone, \u00a327,000; wheat, \u00a317,000; and under the latter head\u2014cotton piece-goods, \u00a338,000; salt, \u00a312,000.\n\nA registration station was first established at Sahibganj in 1872, to ascertain the amount of river traffic passing along the Ganges between Lower Bengal on the one hand, and Behar and the Upper Provinces on the other. During the three years 1872-74, the average number of laden cargo boats passing Sahibganj both ways was about 33,000; the total weight of the cargoes amounted to about 10 million maunds, or\nsay 360,000 tons a year. The down-stream traffic is by far the larger of the two, especially during the latter half of the year, when the river is in flood. Nearly half the down-stream traffic consisted of the single item of oil-seeds, which amounted to nearly 100,000 tons a year, sent chiefly from the Behar marts of Revelganj and Patn\u00e1. Next came wheat, pulses and gram, sugar and saltpetre; but none of these exceeded 20,000 tons a year. The up-stream traffic predominates during the first half of the year, the boats being often towed up by rope from the bank, assisted by sails. The chief cargoes were rice, about 100,000 tons a year; and salt, 40,000 tons. In 1876-77, the total number of boats that passed the registration station was 43,020, thus classified\u2014up-stream, 12,379 laden and 9179 empty; down-stream, 18,419 laden and 3043 empty.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Civil station of Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 47' 58\" N., long. 85\u00b0 2' 45\" E. Adjoins Gaya Town, of which it forms a part. Total population of Gay\u00e1 with S\u00e1hibganj (1872), 66,843.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Village in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated on the river Bay\u00e1, a spill channel of the Gandak, from which it is about 4 miles distant, 30 miles north-west of Muzaffarpur town. Large b\u00e1d\u00e1srs, with trade in oil-seeds, wheat, pulses, and salt, exported by means of the Gandak; chief manufacture, shoes. Two schools. Roads to Motih\u00e1r\u00ed, Mot\u00edpur, and L\u00e1lganj.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Village and produce d\u00e9p\u00f4t in Rangpur District, Bengal. Trade in rice and mustard-seed.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Village and police station in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 26' 20\" N., long. 87\u00b0 52' 45\" E.; pop. (1872), under 5000.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Village on the river of the same name in B\u00e1karganj District, Bengal. Exports of rice, molasses, and sundri wood; imports of salt, oil, tobacco, cloth, and pulses.\n\nS\u00e1hibi (Sabi).\u2014Hill stream in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab; rises in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na near the S\u00e1mbhar Lake, flows through the Riw\u00e1ri tract, and empties itself into the Najafgarh jh\u00edl or lake on the borders of Delhi District. It frequently submerges the land near the foot of the hills, which thus becomes extremely rich and fertile. The water is utilized by means of numerous dams, which force it to spread over the face of the country, and check the violence of its course near the hills.\n\nSahispur.\u2014Town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Sahaspur.\n\nSahiswan.\u2014Tahst\u00edl of Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, stretching inward from the north bank of the Ganges. Area, 473 square miles, of which 328 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 203,206; land revenue, \u00a321,284; total Government revenue, \u00a323,423; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a344,530.\nSahisw\u00e1n.\u2014Municipal town in Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of the tahsil of the same name. Pop. (1872), 17,063, consisting of 8,245 Hindus, 8,814 Muhammadans, and 4 'others.' Munst\u00ed, distillery, good sar\u00e1i, Government charitable dispensary, school-house. A large mound marks the site of an ancient fort, said to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sahasra B\u00e1bu. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a31,131; from taxes, \u00a3656, or 9\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. Lat. 28\u00b0 4' 20\" N., long. 78\u00b0 47' 20\" E.\n\nSahiw\u00e1l.\u2014Municipal town in Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab, and former capital of a native chief. Pop. (1868), 8,900, consisting of 4,870 Hindus, 3,887 Muhammadans, 5 Sikhs, and 138 'others.' Situated in lat. 31\u00b0 58' N., and long. 72\u00b0 22' E., on the left bank of the Jhelum (Jhilam), 20 miles south of Sh\u00e1hpur town. Founded, according to tradition, by G\u00fal Bahlak, one of the ancestors of the Baluch chiefs who held the neighbouring country until the time of Ranjit Sinh. Badly built, and surrounded by a mass of stagnant water, which gives rise to much malaria; but strenuous efforts have been taken to abate this evil. Brisk trade in cotton, grain, and ghi with M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) and Sukkur (Sakkar). The merchants act as bankers and money-lenders for the cultivating classes, while many of them farm estates on their own account. Manufacture of hardware and of turnery in wood and ivory. Town hall, dispensary, police station, school-house, sardi. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3577, or 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nSah\u00faka.\u2014One of the petty States in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3265, of which \u00a351 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a36 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSahuw\u00e1l\u00e1.\u2014Tahsil of S\u00edrs\u00e1 District, Punjab. Population (1868), 57,520 persons.\n\nSahy\u00e1dri.\u2014Mountain range in Bombay. The term Sahy\u00e1dri is applied to the entire system of the Western Ghats (q.v.) from the T\u00e1pti river to Cape Comorin, but more especially to the ranges in the coast Districts of the Deccan. The Sahy\u00e1dri hills in this sense commence in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, and they run south and south-west, as far as Goa, with scattered continuations to the P\u00e1l Gh\u00e1t. Ratn\u00e1giri may be taken as an example of the coast Districts. The range here forms the continuous eastern boundary, running parallel to the coast. It varies in height from 2000 to 3000 feet, though some of the peaks attain an altitude of 5000 feet. While the banks of the streams produce splendid crops of rice in the rains, with pulse in the cold weather, and some of the inland valleys exhibit a high fertility, the soil is, as a rule, poor and barren, and supports with difficulty its overcrowded population. The coast is rocky and dangerous. It consists of a series\nof small bays and coves shut in between jutting headlands, and edged with sand of a dazzling whiteness. At places the hills recede a little, leaving at their base a rich tract of rice fields, with an evergreen strip of cocoa-nut gardens between them and the beach. At intervals of about ten miles a river or bay opens, sufficiently large to form a secure harbour for native craft; and the promontories at the river mouths are almost invariably crowned with the ruins of an old fort. The larger rivers and creeks are navigable for twenty or thirty miles from the coast; and many of the most important towns are situated at their farthest navigable point, for in so rough a country the rivers form the best highways of trade and communication. The wells of the coast villages supply a brackish but not unwholesome water.\n\nThe Sahy\u00e1dri hills in their geological relations have a wider application, and include, as stated above, the whole Western Gh\u00e1ts from the T\u00e1pti to Cape Comorin in the extreme south of the peninsula. The authors of the official Geology of India (Messrs. Medlicott and Blanford) have described the Sahy\u00e1dri hills in this sense as follows:\u2014'The Sahy\u00e1dri range consists to the northward of horizontal or nearly horizontal strata of basalt and similar rocks, cut into a steep scarp on the western side by denudation, and similarly eroded, though less abruptly, to the eastward. The highest summits, such as Mah\u00e1baleshwar, 4717 feet, are perfectly flat-topped, and are clearly undenuded remnants of a great elevated plain. South of about 16\u00b0 N. lat., the horizontal igneous rocks disappear, and the range is composed of ancient metamorphic strata; and here there is in some places a distinct connection between the strike of the foliation and the direction of the hills; but still the connection is only local, and the dividing range consists either of the western scarp of the Mysore plateau, or of isolated hill groups, owing their form apparently to denudation. Where the rocks are so ancient as those are that form all the southern portion of the Sahy\u00e1dri, it is almost impossible to say how far the original direction of the range is due to axes of disturbance; but the fact that all the principal elevations, such as the Nilgiris, Palnis, etc., some peaks on which rise to over 8000 feet, are plateaus and not ridges, tends to show that denudation has played the principal share in determining their contour. The southern portion of the Sahy\u00e1dri range is entirely separated by a broad gap (the Palghat, q.v.), through which the railway from Madras to Beypur passes.' See also the article Ghats (Western).\n\nSai.\u2014River of Oudh, rising in Hardoi District in lat. 27\u00b0 10' N., and long. 80\u00b0 32' E. (Thornton), between the Gumti and the Ganges. It flows in a tortuous south-easterly direction through Oudh, passing R\u00e1i Bareli and Part\u00e1bgarh towns, enters the North-West Provinces in the Jaunpur District, and falls into the Gumti on its right or south bank a few miles below Jaunpur town. Navigable in the rains for country\nboats of 10 tons burden as far as R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town. Captain Wilford mentioned that this river 'is called Samb\u00fa and Sukti, and in the spoken dialects, Sye, because it abounds with small shells. This is really the case, as I have repeatedly observed whilst surveying or travelling along its banks. They are all fossil, small, and embedded in its banks, and appear here and there when laid bare by the encroachments of the river; they consist chiefly of cockles and periwinkles.' Wilford identifies the Sai with 'the Sambus of Megasthenes;' but the Sambus is mentioned by Arrian as a tributary of the Jumna. Arrowsmith's old map of India, '50 kos to the degree,' compiled chiefly from military sources, showed a cross communication between the Sai and the Gumti some distance above Lucknow. This does not appear in later maps.\n\n**Said\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Tahsil in Muttra District, North-Western Provinces.**\n\n*See S\u00e1yy\u00edd\u00e1b\u00e1d.*\n\n**Said\u00e1pet (Sydapet).\u2014Headquarters of the Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras, and a station on the South Indian Railway; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 1' 32\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 15' 40\" E., 5 miles from Madras city. Pop. (1871), 2989, inhabiting 411 houses. A large salt depot, and site of the Government model farm. This model farm was established in 1865, under the Governorship of Sir William Denison. From the first, it was fortunate in the appointment of Mr. Robertson as its superintendent, under whose care many series of agricultural experiments have been conducted with an intelligence and continuity seldom combined in India. Among the results are\u2014the quantitative determination of the value of manure, of irrigation, and of deep ploughing; the acclimatization of many foreign plants; the adaptability of European implements to Indian agriculture; and above all, the growth of green crops for fodder at all seasons of the year. The manures which have been applied with profit comprise lime, saltpetre, oilcake, and poudrette, none of which enters into the native system of rural economy. The most remunerative green crops are *cholam* (Sorghum vulgare), guinea grass (*Panicum jumentorum*), and horse-gram (*Dolichos uniflorus*). Paddy and sugar-cane also give good fodder, when cut green. In order to extend the practical utility of these experiments, a school of agriculture was opened in connection with the farm in 1876. A full class of 30 pupils joined in the first year, of whom no fewer than 9 came from the Bombay Presidency. It is proposed to build a chemical laboratory, agricultural museum, and veterinary hospital. For some years past, the workshop attached to the farm has turned implements for distribution throughout the country. The following is an outline of the financial working of the institution for 1877-78:\u2014Income\u2014provincial grant, \u00a32000; surplus pound fund, \u00a33820; receipts from farm, \u00a3233; receipts from workshop, \u00a3185; total income, \u00a36238: Expenditure\u2014\ngeneral supervision, \u00a31925; farm, \u00a31100; workshops, \u00a3203; school of agriculture, \u00a31941; estate improvements, \u00a31036; allowance for medical charge, \u00a336; total expenditure, \u00a36241.\n\n**Saidnagar.**\u2014Town in Jal\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SAVVIDNAGAR.\n\n**Saidpur.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind.\u2014See SAVVIDPUR.\n\n**Saidpur.**\u2014Town in Far\u00eddpur District, Bengal.\u2014See SAVVIDPUR.\n\n**Saidpur.**\u2014Tahsil and village in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SAVVIDPUR.\n\n**Saidw\u00e1l\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Montgomery District, Punjab.\u2014See SAVVIDWALA.\n\n**S\u00e1ifganj.**\u2014Town in Purniah District, Bengal; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 32' N., and long. 87\u00b0 37' 36\" E., 20 miles distant from Purniah town. The population of S\u00e1ifganj itself is only (1872) 1200, but it is closely surrounded by suburban villages, which bring up the total number of inhabitants to about 10,000. The town contains a vernacular school, police outpost, and Government distillery; there are also 3 Muhammadan mosques, and a Hindu math or temple built in 1822, and two old tanks excavated in 1807 and 1822 respectively. The value of rice annually exported from S\u00e1ifganj is estimated at \u00a325,000, and that of mustard at \u00a35000; the number of blankets annually manufactured is valued at \u00a3600. S\u00e1ifganj was founded about 150 years ago by the Naw\u00e1b S\u00e1if Kh\u00e1n, and is now one of the most populous places in Purniah.\n\n**S\u00e1ifganj Pirwaha.**\u2014Village in Purniah District, Bengal.

Area, about 500 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), about 27,000; estimated revenue, \u00a322,140. This State originally formed a part of Ratlam. On the death of Kesari Sinh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratlam, in 1709, his eldest son, M\u00e1n Sinh, succeeded to the lands forming the present State of Ratlam, and J\u00e1i Sinh, his second son, to Sail\u00e1na. An annual tribute of \u00a33300 was formerly paid to Sindhia, but is now assigned to the British Government in part payment of the Gwalior contingent, under the same conditions as the tribute of Ratlam. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sail\u00e1na, D\u00fala Sinh, is a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, and was born about 1838. He receives a salute of 11 guns. The military force of the State consists of 3 field guns, 18 artillerymen, 50 horse, and 120 foot. Sail\u00e1na (Sill\u00e1na), the chief town of the State, lies in lat. 23\u00b0 30' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 0' 45\" E.\n\n**Sallu.**\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces.\u2014See SELU.\n\n**S\u00e1in.**\u2014Mountain range in S\u00edrm\u00far State, Punjab, lying between\nSAINT GEORGE, FORT\u2014SAINT THOMAS MOUNT. 119\n\n30\u00b0 37' and 30\u00b0 51' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 15' and 77\u00b0 29' E. long.

Lat. 13\u00b0 0' 18\" N., long. 80\u00b0 14' 11\" E.; pop. (1871), 15,480, inhabiting 2364 houses. The town possesses a fine church, several chapels, numerous military buildings, including a handsome artillery mess-house, post office, and cantonment magistrate's court. It is a pretty place, and well kept. The bazaar and native huts are hidden away to the eastward, which adds to the favourable impression made on the visitor who sees it for the first time. The church, standing at the southern end of the parade-ground, is one of the best-looking edifices of its kind in the country. It is seated for 500 men and 80 officers and their families. There are, besides, a Wesleyan chapel at the foot of the mount steps, a Roman Catholic chapel for the European troops, and another small Roman Catholic church, 74 feet long by 25 wide, built in 1764 by the boatmen of Madras, and dedicated to the 'Presentation of the Blessed Virgin.' The total population of Saint Thomas' Mount was in 1871, 15,480, of whom 918 were Europeans and 447 East Indians. The other principal castes and nationalities were Musalmans (1928), Pariahs (3700), Vell\u00e1lars (2549), and Pallis (1802). The soil is gravelly, and the health of the station is exceptionally good, epidemic cholera being of rare occurrence. The 'Mount' itself is a granite and syenite rock, about 220 feet above sea level, overlooking the cantonment. On its summit stands the curious old Portuguese church of The Expectation of the Blessed Virgin. This is built over the spot where the Portuguese in 1547 discovered the celebrated Mount Cross, attributed to the legendary evangelism of Saint Thomas. Lucena gives the following account of the finding of the Cross:\u2014\"It was met with on digging for the foundations of a hermitage amid the ruins which marked (?) the spot of the martyrdom of the Apostle Saint Thomas. On one face of the slab was a cross in relief, with a bird like a dove over it, with its wings expanded as the Holy Ghost is usually represented when descending on our Lord at His baptism, or on our Lady at her annunciation. This cross was erected over the altar at the chapel which was built on the new sanctuary.\" Dr. Burnell (Indian Antiquary, 1874, p. 313) says: 'This account is, no doubt, accurate, for the Portuguese first visiting the mount found the Christian church in ruins, and occupied by a native fakir. The description of the slab is also\naccurate. It does not appear what cause had destroyed the Christian community there, but it probably was owing to the political disturbances attending the war between the Muhammadans of the north and the Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar.' Referring to an Italian account (in the 17th century) of the Cross and the Mount festival, Dr. Burnell continues: 'The cross is built into the wall behind the altar in a church on the Great Mount, which is served by a native priest under the Goa jurisdiction. An annual festival is held here, which brings a large assemblage of native Christians to the spot, and causes an amount of disorder which the European Catholic clergy of Madras have in vain tried to put down.' In Anglo-Indian history, and notably in the wars of the Karnatic, Saint Thomas' Mount was a place of great importance. The battle fought here on the 7th February 1759 was one of the fiercest struggles of the Franco-British wars in India. It is thus described by Mr. Crole:\u2014'Colonel Calliaud had been summoned from the south to assist in raising the siege of Madras. He took post at the Mount, with his right at a deserted little temple at the north-east of the present parade-ground, and his left supported by a house called Carvalho's garden, where he posted four pieces of cannon. His troops included the contingent brought by the Company's partisan Muhammad Isaf, and consisted of 2200 horse, 2500 foot, and 6 cannons. Of these, however, only 1500 natives, 80 Europeans, and 12 artillerymen were possessed of the slightest discipline. Lally's forces aggregated 2600, half of whom were Europeans, and all disciplined. He had, besides, 8 guns, possessing a great superiority in weight of metal. The fight lasted from early morning till five p.m., when the enemy, to Colonel Calliaud's intense relief, retreated. The latter had ammunition sufficient to have lasted for about a couple of minutes more.' 'On the 20th March 1769, Haidar Ali, who had marched within 5 miles of Madras, met Mr. Dupr\u00e9, the senior member of council, and here the disgraceful treaty of the 2nd April was signed. In 1774, at the suggestion of Colonel James, the Mount was established as the headquarters of the artillery. The garrison of the Mount formed the major part of the force (under Sir Hector Munro) that ought to have saved Baillie in 1780. During its absence, only five companies of Sepoys and 4 guns had been left for the protection of the Mount, and a temporary earthwork was raised to strengthen the place against attack. This has long been levelled, but a slight depression crossing the plain midway between Palavaram and the Mount indicates the position of what went by the name of the Marhatt\u00e1 Ditch.'\u2014Chengalpat Distr. Man. p. 73. According to Dr. Burnell, the date of the cross tablet and its Pehlevi inscription is probably about the 8th century.\n\nSaint Thome (Maldipur, Mylapore).\u2014Suburb of MADRAS CITY (q.v.).

The shrine crowns the high bank of a hill stream, at the foot of the Sulaim\u00e1n range, in the midst of arid desert scenery, 'well adapted for the residence of those who desire to mortify the flesh.' Founded in honour of Saidi Ahmad, afterwards known as Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r, the son of an immigrant from B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d, who settled at Sialkot, 12 miles east of M\u00falt\u00e1n, in the year 1220. Saidi Ahmad became a devotee, and having performed a very remarkable series of miracles, was presented by the Delhi Emperor with four mule-loads of money, with which the Sakhi-Sarw\u00e1r shrine was erected. A handsome flight of steps leads from the bed of the stream to the building, constructed at the expense of two Hindu merchants of Lahore. The buildings include\u2014the mausoleum of Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r himself; a monument of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak; the tomb of Massam\u00e1t B\u00edb\u00ed Bh\u00e1i, wife of Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r; and a thak\u00fardw\u00e1ra. They thus comprise a curious mixture of Hindu and Muhammadan architecture, and are frequented by devotees of all religions. The guardians of the shrine are the descendants of Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r's three servants always miraculously limited to the number of 1650, among whom the revenues accruing from the offerings are equally divided. Throughout the year, the shrine forms the resort of numerous mendicants, Hindu and Muhammadan.\n\n**Sakit.\u2014** Ancient and decaying town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 26' 10\" N., long. 78\u00b0 49' 15\" E.; pop. (1872), 5415, consisting of 3739 Hindus and 1676 Muhammadans. Sakit stands on a very isolated site, 12 miles south-east of Etah town. Its hill was once crowned by a fort; but now only the remains of a large and\nancient mosque, erected in the 13th century, testify to the former supremacy of the Muhammadan element. On the highest part of the existing town rises a half-finished modern temple, remarkable for its Saracenic arches, supported on slender pillars of richly carved Agra stone,\u2014an ambitious work commenced by a commissariat servant (who enriched himself during the Sikh war), but died before its completion. The town clusters around this temple, which, from its conspicuous position, forms a landmark for many miles around. The principal road enters Sakit by a fine new bridge over a ravine, constructed out of the foundations of the old fort. Handsome bazar, lined by good shops with flat and pointed ornamental fronts. Trees line the roadway and afford a pleasant shade. The sarii is now in ruins; the roof of the old mosque is broken down; and the water of the handsome well has become brackish. New brick-built police station on the site of the old fort; post office, school-house. Small trade in cotton, grain, and indigo seed. Numerous inscriptions on mosques.

In Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh, it has a drainage basin of 810 square miles, and being the central stream in a low well-cultivated valley, it receives from all sides numerous feeders. It has a distinct water system, and preserves its own name while it passes through Gay\u00e1 and Patn\u00e1 Districts on its way to join the Ganges in Monghyr. Throughout its course it is much used for irrigation.\n\n**Sakt\u00ed.**\u2014Native State, at the eastern limit of Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces, to which it is now attached. Pop.

Density of population, 73 persons per square mile. Sakt\u00ed was originally one of the Garhj\u00e1t States attached to Sambalpur District. It consists of a curved strip of level country, partly open, partly covered with forest, skirting the base of a range known as the Gunji Hills. Chief products\u2014rice, wheat, oil-seeds, and cotton, besides a small quantity of forest produce, consisting of lac, resin, gum, and mahua fruit. The chief is a R\u00e1j-Gond, and pays a tribute of \u00a335. At present, however (1877), the State is under direct British administration. Total revenue for 1876-77, \u00a3843, of which \u00a3397 was derived from land revenue; expenditure, \u00a3959. In 1872, only 22 persons were returned as able to read and write, or as being under instruction.

The manufactured article bears the general name of Sal\u00e1mbha salt, but is produced in ten separate places within this region. It is made by the evaporation of brine drawn from wells, together with the washings of saline earth, and is of very inferior quality, containing large amounts of other ingredients besides the pure chloride. The total quantity manufactured in 1871-72 was 203,182 maunds.\n\n**S\u00e1landi** (properly S\u00e1lnad\u00ed).\u2014River of Bengal, so called from the s\u00e1l forests which it traverses. It rises in the southern slope of the Megh\u00e1sani Mountain in Morbanj State, and in its upper course is a black-water river with high banks and a bottom of muddy sand. For miles the S\u00e1landi flows through one continuous grove of palms and bamboos; it is navigable for country boats as high as 6 miles\nfrom its junction with the Baitarani. Its lower course bifurcates into a network of streams interlaced with those of the Mat\u00e1i, a river bringing down the drainage of the country between the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns and the S\u00e1landi, and after a tortuous course falling into the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 near its mouth. The area of the catchment basin of the S\u00e1landi is 250 square miles; the maximum discharge in flood time, 60,000 cubic feet; and the average cold-weather discharge, 260 cubic feet.\n\n**Sal\u00e1ya.\u2014Port in Naw\u00e1nagar State, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay.**\n\n**Salb\u00e1i (Salbye).\u2014Village in Gwalior State, Central India; situated 32 miles south-east of the fort of Gwalior, in lat. 25\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 19' E. Celebrated for the treaty concluded here in 1782 between the British Government and the Marhatt\u00e1 Confederacy, at the close of the struggle for the Peshw\u00e1ship which took place after the death of Madho R\u00e1o Ballal. That treaty provided for the surrender to the Peshw\u00e1 of Bassein and other territory captured by the British during the war; and the cession to the British of Salsette, Elephanta, Karanj, and Hog islands off Bombay. Under the third article of the treaty, the right of the British to the town and pargan\u00e1 of Broach was fully recognised, but these were conferred by Government upon Sindhia in consideration of his services, but upon the condition that British trade should be free and unmolested. (See Aitchison's Treaties and Engagements, vols. iii. and iv., ed. 1876.)**\n\n**S\u00e1lbaldi.\u2014Village and hill on the M\u00e1r\u00fa river; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 26' N., and long. 77\u00b0 59' E., 5 miles north of Morsi, partly in Ellichpur District, Berar, and partly in Bet\u00fal District, Central Provinces. Celebrated on account of two springs, one very cold, the other warm. When S\u00edt\u00e1 was deserted by R\u00e1ma, she is said by local tradition to have come to S\u00e1lbaldi, and to have given birth here to two sons, Kusa and Lava. This tradition would identify S\u00e1lbaldi as the scene of the hermitage of Valmiki, whither S\u00edt\u00e1, when pregnant, was banished by R\u00e1ma.**\n\n**S\u00e1lbet (Shialbet, Scarbet, Shalbet).\u2014Island situated about 2 miles from the coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay, in lat. (centre) 20\u00b0 54' 30\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 33' 30\" E., 8 miles east-north-east of Jafar\u00e1bd and 17 miles from Mowah Point. It is about three-quarters of a mile long on its sea-face, and a little more than half a mile broad. Old fortifications stand on its north-west and south points, the latter being strongly constructed. The island is of sandstone, and is included within the State of JAFARABAD. A well in the centre supplies good water. Salbet was formerly a famous piratical stronghold, and might, according to Taylor (Sailing Directory, p. 360), be made a safe harbour. Such a refuge is much wanted along the south coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.**\n\n**Salem (Selam).\u2014A British District in the Madras Presidency, lying between 11\u00b0 2' and 12\u00b0 54' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 33' and 79\u00b0 6' E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1878, 7483 square**\nSALEM DISTRICT.\n\nmiles; population, according to the Census of 1871, 1,966,995 persons. It is bounded north by Mysore (Maisur) and North Arcot, east by Trichinopoli and South and North Arcot, south by portions of Coimbatore and Trichinopoli, and west by Coimbatore and Mysore. The administrative headquarters are at Salem Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Except towards the south, the District is hilly, with large plains lying between the several ranges. The chief of these ranges are the Shevaroys (highest point, 5410), the Kalrayans (about 4000), the Melagiris (4580), the Kollimalais (4663), the Pachamalais (about 4000), the Yelagiris (4441), the Jevadis (3840), the Vatthalamalais (about 4000), the Eriv\u00e1inis and Valasaimalais (about 3800), the Bodamalais (4019), the Thop\u00far Hills, the Thalaimalais. There are also innumerable detached peaks and smaller ranges. The District has been described as comprising 'three distinct tracts of country, known as the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t, the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, and the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t divisions. The Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t division, as its name implies, is situated below the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts on the level of the Karnatic generally, and in soil and climate differs but little from the neighbouring Districts of Trichinopoli and South Arcot. The B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l division includes the whole Salem face of the Gh\u00e1ts and a wide tract of country at their base; and the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t is situated above the Gh\u00e1ts, on the tableland of Mysore.' Of the Os\u00far taluk, only one-half to the north is really B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, the southern half lying considerably below the level of the Mysore plateau. Os\u00far itself is about 3000 feet above the sea. Dharmapuri is about 1500 feet, and Krishnagiri from 1500 to 2000 feet above sea level. Tirupat\u00far and Uttankarai lie in one basin, and average slightly over 1350 feet above sea level. At Salem there is a considerable drop, the town of that name being only 947 feet above the sea. The climate is generally dry, and in the northern portions cooler than in the south; the climate of Os\u00far being as temperate as that of Bangalore.\n\nThe chief river of the District is the Kaveri (Cauvery), from the left bank of which a large area in Tiruchengod and N\u00e1makal is irrigated. The Pal\u00e1r only flows through a few miles of the northern corner of the Tirupat\u00far taluk, where it does nearly as much harm as good, as comparatively little use is made of the water, and the town of V\u00e1n\u00edambadi lies at its mercy. In 1874, a considerable portion of this town was washed away, and it is only a question of time when the remainder, hitherto preserved at considerable cost, will follow. The Pennar, rising in Mysore territory, flows through Os\u00far and Krishnagiri to Uttankarai, where, near the South Arcot frontier, it is joined from north and south by the P\u00e1mb\u00e1r and V\u00e1ni\u00e1r, minor streams. The Sanathkumaranadi traverses Os\u00far and Dharmapuri, in the latter taluk, near Marandahalli, being tapped with profit to rayats and Government. The fertility of the At\u00far taluk is chiefly due to the Vasishtanadi and\nSwethanadi, which flow eastward into South Arcot. There are, besides these, numerous tributaries of the K\u00e1veri. A small traffic is carried on the K\u00e1veri in basket boats, and timber is occasionally floated down. The water of these rivers is utilized either by anicuts thrown across their beds or by channels which tap the banks. The channel system is very extensively worked in the Paramathi Division of the N\u00e1makal t\u00e1luk. The fisheries of the District, although they make a considerable total, are individually insignificant, consisting of the right of fishing in the different Government tanks, which is purchased for sums varying from 10s. to more than \u00a320.\n\nThe District forests are of considerable value, but there is some reason to fear that they have been overworked, with a view to immediate profit rather than ultimate revenue. The Jev\u00e1di and Yelagiri Hills still contain some valuable timber, and a large portion of the Shevaroys is clothed with middling-sized jungle. Sandal-wood is found. The most valuable forest is the belt of vengai (Pterocarpus marsupium) on the hilly tracts which fringe the K\u00e1veri in the south of the Os\u00far t\u00e1luk and towards Pennagaram. Reserves and plantations have been formed for the supply of fuel to the railway, but at the present stage the experiment is not sufficiently advanced to admit of an accurate estimate being formed of its utility. Jungle produce, such as honey, bees-wax, barks for tanning and dyeing, soap-nut, fibres, medicinal roots, etc., are collected by the Malay\u00e1lis and other jungle tribes; in some cases this right is rented out. Lac is found in the Os\u00far jungles, and both in the hills and on the plains the tamarind is a fertile source of revenue.\n\nWild animals are daily diminishing in numbers, as each hillman carries a gun and shoots for food everything that comes in his way, regardless of sex, age, or season of the year. Bison and even elephants are occasionally seen on the Jev\u00e1dis. Leopards and bears are to be found in most of the hilly tracts. S\u00e1mbhar deer may be found towards Pennagaram, and in a few places in the Os\u00far t\u00e1luk. Hy\u00e6nas, antelope, deer of several kinds, wild pig, a species of armadillo, and a few wolves complete the catalogue. Pea and jungle fowl, duck, teal, snipe, florican, etc., can be had in season.\n\nThe geology has been only partially examined. The formation is mostly gneissic, granite and trap dikes cropping up occasionally. The principal varieties of rock belonging to the gneiss which occur in the eastern part are, in the order of their importance and extent of development\u2014(1) Hornblendic schists and rocks; (2) Quartzo-felspathic gneiss, massive or schistose; (3) Talcose and chloritic rocks (generally schistose, rarely massive); (4) Magnetic iron beds; (5) Crystalline limestones. Magnesite veins occur chiefly at the Chalk Hills (so miscalled) near the foot of the Shevaroys. Pot-stone is found in\nseveral places. *(Vide* Vol. iv., Part 2, *Mem. Geo. Surv. of India.)* Magnetic iron occurs in practically inexhaustible quantities. Corundum and chromate of iron are also obtainable. The washings of some rivers yield gold, notably the Penn\u00e1r (more correctly Ponni\u00e1r, so named on account of its golden sands). It is probable that gold may exist in the Os\u00far taluk, where it borders on Mysore. There is no coal. Lime is available in sufficient quantities to serve as a flux in iron-smelting.\n\n**History.** \u2014 The history of Salem, or rather of Salem with the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l as one District, may be said to begin not very long before the middle of last century. Until 1600 A.D., most of the present District, or at all events the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l and B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t portions, were probably jungle and desert, with here and there a highland chief\u2014half p\u00e1l\u00e9d\u00e1r; half robber\u2014holding his state in rocky keep or mountain castle, owning perhaps some ill-defined allegiance to the distant R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vij\u00e1yanagar. The south and south-west taluks no doubt belonged to Chera, and were absorbed in the rising power of Mysore during the 17th century, before the close of which the victorious arms of Chik Deo R\u00e1j had brought the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l under the same authority. The chief interest in its later history centres in the fate of the fortresses of the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l; and although the District has no connected history, there are few parts of Southern India that contain more spots of interest for English students.\n\nSalem, as at present composed, was acquired by the treaties known as the Treaty of Peace with Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n in 1792, and the Partition Treaty of Mysore (1799). By the former treaty, the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t and B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l were ceded; and by the latter the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, or what is now the Os\u00far taluk, came into the hands of the British. The District contains 9 taluks; of which two are directly under the Collector, three under the Sub-Collector, two form the Head Assistant's charge, and two are in charge of the general Deputy Collector. Its limits are now identical with those of 1799, except that the Kangundi zamind\u00e1ri, north of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, was finally transferred to North Arcot in 1808.\n\n**Administrative History.** \u2014 Immediately on the acquisition of the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t and B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, Colonel (then Captain) Read was placed in charge, with Captains Graham, MacLeod, and Munro (afterwards Governor of Madras) as his assistants. He at once addressed himself to the survey of the District, and to the introduction of a uniform revenue system, which was fairly launched throughout this portion of the District in 1796, as a *rayatw\u00e1rdi* system to be confirmed for ever. This, however, met with no favour at headquarters, where the idea of leases on the *zamind\u00e1ri* system had been resolved on. The *zamind\u00e1ri* system was formerly unknown in Salem, but the Government ordered it to be introduced. In 1799, Read, with Munro as his secretary,\nfollowed the tide of war into Mysore, and never returned to the District. A new administrator succeeded them, and so faithfully carried out orders, that by 1805 the *samindari* system was in full force everywhere, except in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, which escaped owing to its being a recent acquisition, and, after being leased out for two years to two natives, was finally surveyed in 1804, since which time it has prospered. Great losses followed on the overthrow of Read's settlement. The 205 estates existing and paying 16 *lakhs* of rupees (say \u00a3160,000) in 1805, had by 1821 been so reduced in value that they only paid 8 *lakhs*, which in 1836 fell to 5 *lakhs*, and in 1850 to 4\u00bd *lakhs*, or say \u00a345,000. Various causes, into which it is needless to enter here, were at work to bring about this result; and a series of remedies, unsuccessful because they did not go to the root of the mischief, were tried. Of one thing, however, there can be no doubt, viz. that notwithstanding all Read's care and zeal, he had in many cases over-assessed the soil. The *samindars* had, before 1813, to some extent given satisfactory evidence that this was so, by reducing rates on 'wet' lands throughout by one-sixth, and on 'dry' land from one-eighth to one-fifth. The end soon came. Before the *samindari* system had been in existence for five years, those in authority began to hesitate. Their first step in retreat from the false position which had been taken up was made in 1809, when, failing bidders for estates sold for arrears, the Collector was empowered to bring them under his own management, a policy extended in 1813 by permission to buy in such estates at auction on behalf of Government. This politic step was afterwards modified by a restriction of the bid to the amount of the arrears.\n\nOn such estates coming under Government management, the District officers had opportunities for more closely studying the causes which led their owners into bankruptcy, consequent on which the conviction became fixed that, to insure stability of revenue, a reduction in the demand was needed. This, however, was only done in a hesitating and partial manner. Thus, in 1816, the assessment in the southern part of the District was reduced generally by 10 per cent.; and in 1818, the Collector was empowered to make a discretional reduction not exceeding 30 per cent. These benefits touched the *rayatwadi* lands only, and rightly so; for, apart from the fact that a reversion to the State as the direct landlord is the most important factor in securing prosperity to the tenantry of the District, the *samindars* were even on equitable, much less on legal, grounds entitled to no consideration whatever, as, in fixing the *peshkash* (revenue) payable by them, the cultivated land alone had been taken into account, all the waste being made over free and for ever. In the present day it is hard, with telegraphic communication, and Salem within half a night's journey from Madras,\nto realize the darkness in which the authorities formerly were as to\nthe state of the District. Even Munro, when Governor of Madras,\nthan whom no one then living took more interest in the District, was\nignorant of important changes which had been introduced into the\nrevenue system. The one thing plainly perceptible at Madras was that\nthe revenue was diminishing and uncertain; the causes were unknown,\nor if known, wrong deductions were drawn from the facts. To stimu-\nlate the extension of cultivation, the suicidal panacea of the kaul\ntenure was resorted to in 1822. Kaul, ordinarily signifying an agree-\nment of any kind, in the sense in which it is here used, indicates a\ntenancy under which the rayat, taking up fresh lands, pays no assess-\nment for the first year, half rates for the second, and full rates for\nthe third year. The terms of the tenancy may vary from this, but\nthe principle is the same. The result was a foregone conclusion.\nRayats already holding over-assessed or fully-assessed lands snapped\ngreedily at the bait, and for the first two years or more, as the case\nmight be, all went on prosperously; but in the year when Government\nshould have reaped the full benefit of their concession, the rayats\nturned round and relinquished their new holdings. Many were the\nrecipes devised to avert the necessary consequence of the measure.\nThe kaul tenure was prohibited unless the patt\u00e1 land was retained; the\nrayats should only resign good and bad lands in equal proportions,\nand might not cling to the one and despise the other. The system\nwas doomed from its birth, and received its death-blow in 1850. As\nregards the over-assessed lands, the percentage reductions of 1816 to\n1818, above referred to, affected the whole tract rateably, but had no\noperation towards effecting a reduction in cases where individual\nfields or holdings were over-taxed. Further reductions, but still only\nin the nature of a percentage reduction, were made in 1858 and 1859,\nand in respect of garden lands in 1864. But it was not until 1869 to\n1874, when the settlement now in force was introduced, that the\nGovernment demand was universally fixed on equitable and scientific\nprinciples. Under this revision, the area under cultivation has risen\nfrom 1,050,000 acres, assessed at \u00a3173,000, to 1,210,000 acres,\nassessed at \u00a3180,000.\n\nTenures.\u2014The District contains three p\u00e1laiyams or zamind\u00e1rs of\nimportance,\u2014Sulagiri, B\u00e1gal\u00far, and Berik\u00e1i, all in the Os\u00far t\u00e1luk.\nThere are 133 mitt\u00e1s and a few j\u00e1g\u00edrs. But the predominant tenure is\nrayatw\u00e1rt, the tenant being liable to ejectment by the Government\nonly in case of failure to pay his revenue. Every year he has the option\nof throwing up his holding or any field in it, and his assessment is fixed\nfor thirty years. A mitt\u00e1dd\u00e1r has the right of collecting the paim\u00e1ish\ntirv\u00e1\u00ed or settled rent, a share of which he pays to Government as\npeshkash. The tenure cannot be reconverted into rayatw\u00e1rt, if the\nmitt\u00e1d\u00e1r is in arrears. His right to collect the tirvai can be sold by Government, which does not itself enter the market as a buyer. The mitt\u00e1d\u00e1rs are addicted to leasing their villages, often selling them in shares, and the lessees again sub-letting; the Hindu system of undivided families multiplies the mitt\u00e1d\u00e1rs, their middlemen, etc.; the latter and the sub-lessees often get into debt, their rights in the villages being sold by the civil courts; Musalm\u00e1n inheritance so works in a couple of generations as to produce, instead of one original mitt\u00e1d\u00e1r, twenty or thirty such, all owning different shares in the village, according to sex and relationship;\u2014these and other causes all combined often render the rayat uncertain as to who his landlord is. Perhaps two or three persons will at one and the same time, under colourable rights, distrain or attempt to distrain his property. For these reasons, the position of the rayat in mitt\u00e1 villages is unenviable.\n\nAdded to this, he neither shares in the equitable revision of assessment which takes place in Government lands each thirty years, nor in the annual jam\u00e1band\u00ed remissions, granted by Government, when drought, flood, excess of rain, blight, or other accidents impoverish their tenants. If the decision of the civil courts is rightly interpreted to mean that rayats in mitt\u00e1s are liable to ejectment from year to year, this is not known to the landlords, or if they know it, they do not act on it.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The only Census of the District, from which safe deductions can be made, is that of 1871, though it is probable that for rough calculations the earlier enumerations were sufficiently near the mark. In 1800, the population was returned at 612,871; in 1835, at 905,190; in 1850, at 1,195,367. Since that time quinquennial Censuses have been taken; and in 1871, the regular Census showed a population of 1,966,995, or an average of 5 persons to each house. The males numbered 975,505, and the females, 991,490. Hindus predominated, numbering in all 1,901,060, or 96\u00b76 per cent. of the population. Of Musalm\u00e1ns, there were 52,312, or only 2\u00b77 per cent.; and of Christians, 13,333, or 0\u00b77 per cent. Amongst Hindus, the Sivaites outnumber the Vishnuvites by about 2 to 1, the other sects being only fractionally represented. Of Musalm\u00e1ns, the great majority are Sunnis. Emigration is not considerable, but a few coolies go to Ceylon, the French colonies, and Burma. There is no immigration to speak of. More than half of the population is engaged in cultivation.\n\nSalem, the capital, is situated on the Tirumanimutt\u00e1r, about 6 miles from the foot of the Shevaroys. It is a municipality, with a revenue of \u00a33701 in 1876\u201377, and a population of 49,681. There are 11 other towns with a population of over 5000, of which Tirupatur (12,837) and Shendamangalam (11,783) are the most important.\nReading rooms or literary associations have been established at Salem, Yercaud (Yerk\u00e1d), Os\u00far, and Tirupat\u00edr. The chief source of charity is the Thopur Chatram Fund, from which sar\u00e1\u00eds (native inns), etc. are being provided all over the District. Those at Salem, Thopur, Jollarp\u00e9t, At\u00far, and Tirupat\u00edr are amongst the best. Besides the hospital and dispensary at headquarters, there are 9 dispensaries scattered over the District, and scarcely a large village is without its own cleaning and sanitary staff. Salem contains no shrine to compare in magnificence with those of Madura, Tanjore, or Sr\u00edrangam; but pilgrims crowd to the sacred springs on the T\u00edrthamalai, to Hanumat\u00edrtham on the Penn\u00e1r, to the pagoda at Os\u00far, to the Adipadinettu at the falls of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery), and to the festivals at Dharmapuri, Mecheri, and other places. The chief shrines where the Malay\u00e1lis worship are on the Shevaroys and the Chitterimalai Hills near Har\u00far. There are printing presses in the Collector's office and in the central jail, but no local newspaper is published, English or vernacular.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of the District, about 3,777,060 acres are occupied by Government villages, the remainder being in mitt\u00e1 or p\u00e1layam villages. The total number of villages in the District is 3594, with 2870 hamlets, excluding those uninhabited, which number 427 and 151 respectively. According to the last quinquennial return, the cultivable area belonging to Government, exclusive of land reserved for public purposes, was 1,623,735 acres, assessed at \u00a3224,383. Holdings occupied 1,205,633 acres, assessed at \u00a3179,352. The number of registered rayats was 190,173, with 245,055 sub-tenants, making a total of 435,228. The patt\u00e1s numbered 206,015, of which 139,768 were single and 66,247 joint. The staple crops are rice and r\u00e1gi (Elusine coracana), the latter being almost exclusively the food of the labouring class. The yield is assumed, for purposes of assessment, to be 641 Madras measures of paddy or unhusked rice, and 347 Madras measures of the other three staples for the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t tal\u00faks, the out-turn in the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l and B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t tal\u00faks being the same for paddy, but somewhat less on the average for dry grains. R\u00e1gi grows to perfection in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and above the average in the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l. Kambu or spiked millet (Panicum spicatum) is about the same as in the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t; but gram, though remarkably fine, is an uncertain crop, and yields little more than half as much as the other staple grains. The greater portion (82 per cent.) of the classified area of the District consists of red soil, the regar or black cotton-soil occupying 16 per cent. (in the northern tal\u00faks, 20 per cent.), and exceptional or permanently improved land, 2 per cent. On a holding of 2 acres of 'wet' and 3 acres of 'dry' land, the net profit would not probably exceed \u00a36 per annum, or about 10s. a month. The mass of the peasantry are in debt. The habit of indebtedness is so\ningrained in their nature, that if they all started fair to-morrow, 50 per cent. would be in debt again in a year.\n\nOne man is held to be sufficient for the ordinary daily labour on a farm of 3 acres of 'wet,' or 6 acres of 'dry' land, if assisted in the heavy work of planting, weeding, reaping, and threshing. His wages would be 480 measures of grain per annum = \u00a31, 5s., plus an annual money payment of 6s. (the wages in the northern being lower than in the southern taluks). Twenty-seven measures of seed are required for an acre of 'wet,' and 6 measures for an acre of 'dry' land. Irrigated crops are weeded twice if sown broadcast, but once only if transplanted. 'Dry' crops are weeded only once. Manure is applied, as a rule, by treading in leaves on 'wet,' and penning out sheep on 'dry' land. For 'wet' lands, the average is 120 bundles of wild indigo or other leaves per acre, and this is supplied annually to all fields thought worth manuring. Eight pens of 200 sheep each, at a cost of 4 measures of grain per diem, is the usual allowance per acre for 'dry' lands. The highest Government 'wet' rate in the District is \u00a31, 8s. per acre, and the lowest is \u00a31, 3s. 1\u00bdd., exclusive of local cesses, the highest for 'dry' lands being 10s., and the lowest 6d. The cost of cultivating an acre of good black loam is about 18s. on irrigated, and 7s. 6d. on unirrigated lands in the northern taluks, the rates in the Talaghat being somewhat higher, or 18s. 6d. and 9s. 6d. respectively. The customary rates of wages for unskilled labour are\u2014for men, 3d.; for women, 2\u00bdd.; for children (male or female), 1\u00bcd. The Wadder or navvy caste get twice as much, but they generally do task-work, by which they gain more than by daily wages. The wages of a working goldsmith vary with the value of the materials, but may be taken on an average at 1s. per diem. A blacksmith gets 1s.; a carpenter from 1s. to 1s. 3d.; bricklayers from 9d. to 1s. 3d.. During the ten years ending 1874, the prices at Salem town per garce of 9360 lbs. avoirdupois, in February and March, when the rayats sell, averaged \u00a310, 6s. for rice, and \u00a311, 10s. for cholam or great millet (Sorghum vulgare).\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In May 1872, and again in May 1874, the District suffered from cyclones which, though they did not, owing to absence of cultivation in those months, do much damage to crops, caused terrible mortality among cattle, and breached several tanks. In the autumn of 1874, heavy floods occurred, notably in the Pal\u00e1r and the basin between the Pal\u00e1r and the Yelagiri Hills. Many tanks were breached, and much property was damaged. The railway line was carried away in several places, and a considerable portion of the town of Vaniambadi was swept away.\n\nBlight are not uncommon in Salem, and locusts, caterpillars, and other insects devour the crops. Floods on a large scale are unknown. The Pal\u00e1r, when in flood, occasionally causes loss to the river-side\nlandholders; and breached tanks, especially when a chain of tanks gives way together, cause damage, but more generally to property than to life. The severest famine of early years was that of 1833, when prices rose 71 per cent.; 1845-46 was a year of high prices, as also was 1857-58. In the famine of 1866, the following prices were reached between September and December:\u2014Rice, 15s. to 17s. 6d. per cwt.; cholam, 8s. 6d. to 12s. per cwt. Works and relief houses were provided by Government for the needy. But this and all previous famines on record are dwarfed by the terrible calamity of 1877-78. There had been signs and warnings by which this might have been foreseen. The north-east monsoon failed both in 1873 and 1874. In 1875, the north-east monsoon was almost a total failure, especially the latter part of it; and in 1876, the south-west and north-east monsoons, on both of which the District depends for its water supply, failed almost completely. The pinch began to be felt in October 1876, but people still hoped. By November, the failure of the monsoon became an established fact; grain dealers took alarm, and prices rose at a bound. In August 1877, inferior rice had risen to a rupee for 11 lbs., and other grains when procurable were nearly the same price: as in ordinary years the price is from 20 lbs. to 30 lbs. for a rupee, the keen distress may be realized. During the first thirteen months of famine the mortality was 180,000, the average death-rate in other years being 50,000. It is estimated that altogether the District lost 10 per cent. of its population. Distress may be said to set in when normal prices are doubled, any rise beyond that rate involving famine. One result of the late famine has been, that attention was called to the neglected means of storing water. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r and K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) might be utilized to a far greater extent than at present, and the Penn\u00e1r (Ponniy\u00e1r) carries untold wealth into the Bay of Bengal. In so far as the increased wealth of the population gives them more reserve to draw upon in time of scarcity, improved irrigation might do much for the District; but it cannot render certain a capricious rainfall, on which the majority of the tanks depend, and it cannot secure grass for cattle. The neglect of forestry is probably responsible for much. In the middle of the 16th century, the whole District was more or less a forest; it is not now easy in many places to find shade for a noon-day halt. Were it not for the railway, this last famine would probably have carried off a half of the population, instead of the 204,590 who perished from insufficient food, and the subsequent diseases consequent thereon.\n\nIndustries and Trade.\u2014The chief industry of the District is weaving, which is carried on in almost every large town or village, and the weavers of Salem and Gh\u00e1zipur are especially noted. Carpets of great beauty and superior workmanship are made in the Salem jail. Good\niron and steel are made, but only on a small scale; an attempt to utilize the mineral wealth of the District by European capital having failed owing to the cost of charcoal. In Salem there are several cutlers whose wares are famed for temper and finish throughout India. Sugar, cotton, hides, indigo, saltpetre, salt, grains, betel, areca-nut, coir, jungle produce, etc., pass freely in and out of the District, but there is no trustworthy source of information regarding imports and exports.\n\nCommunications.\u2014There are about 1386 miles of road in the District, on which the expenditure in 1875 was \u00a315,590; but the state of the roads is not satisfactory. The length of railway line within the District is 134 miles. The principal passes are\u2014the Chengama Pass, by which South Arcot is reached from Sing\u0101rapet; the Mor\u016brpatti Gh\u0101t, which lies between the Shevaroys and the Thopur Hills; the Thopur and Mukan\u016br Gh\u0101ts, through which traffic reaches Dharmapuri from the south-east and east; the R\u0101yakottai Pass, which gives access from Krishnagiri to the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t; the Manjanadi and Kott\u0101ipatti Passes, by which Uttankarai is accessible from Salem and At\u016br respectively, on the south; the Anchittai Gh\u0101t, almost impracticable, by which the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t portion of the Os\u016br taluk communicates with the valley of the K\u0101veri.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The imperial revenue of the District for 1874-75 was \u00a3294,318, of which land revenue contributed \u00a3227,507. Excise came next with \u00a336,682; and stamps, \u00a318,859. The other items of receipt are small, the forests being credited with only \u00a35405. The total revenue in 1805-06 is returned at \u00a3191,786, of which the land yielded \u00a3182,348; in 1850-51, the total revenue was \u00a3196,693, and the land revenue, \u00a3177,535; in 1870-71, the total revenue was \u00a3302,091, and the land revenue, \u00a3232,191.\n\nThere are at present 24 magistrates' courts and 13 civil courts, including those of the revenue officers, covenanted and uncovenanted, empowered to hear rent suits. The number of covenanted officers is 6, including the two Assistant Collectors who have no separate charge. Exclusive of village watchmen, the District police in 1876 consisted of 2 officers, 20 inspectors and 1095 constables, or 1 policeman to every 6\u00b786 square miles and every 1761 of the population. The cost of this force was \u00a314,778, equal to about 1\u00bdd. per head of the population. The value of their services as a preventive force, when compared with the old police organization (dating before 1858), may be gauged from the fact that in 1875 there were only 2 gang robberies in the District against 212 in 1858. The District has 1 central and 16 subsidiary jails, containing (in 1875) 1598 prisoners, and costing Government \u00a33493, or \u00a32, 4s. per prisoner.\n\nThe education of the masses is chiefly got at the payal schools, where elementary teaching is given after a time-honoured but unscientific\nfashion. In 1871, according to Census returns, there were only 190 schools in the District; but this cannot be supposed to include the payal schools. The Local Fund Act, passed in 1871, gave a stimulus to popular education by providing the funds for its extension; and in 1874-75 there were 230 schools, either belonging to Government or aided, which were attended by 7140 pupils. In addition to this, it is estimated that about 7200 children receive elementary education from unaided payal schools. Only 2\u00b78 per cent. of the whole population could read and write in 1871, and of these only 276 were females. This is no fair indication of the present state of things, as the last ten years have been marked by extension of educational facilities. Regarding missionary effort, the field is divided between the London Mission, the French priests under the Vicar Apostolic of Pondicherri, and, to a small extent, the Lutheran Evangelistic Mission. The Roman Catholics outnumber the rest.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014On the lower hill ranges, fever prevails for a great part of the year. Strangers, especially if they drink the water, are most liable to attack, though the anaemic faces and enlarged spleens of the acclimatized population show that they have by no means an immunity from the scourge. In the plains, during the rainy season, large tracts are liable to a peculiarly weakening sort of fever, which in some years causes considerable mortality. The cause of this is not exactly known, as the fever does not always appear under given conditions; and occasionally one particular locality, noted for fever, may be free, while another, reputed for healthiness, may become the scene of an epidemic. Cholera rages through the District at times. The last outbreak commenced in August 1875, and the disease has not yet (January 1878) disappeared. The virulence of the disease may be estimated from one example. In the village of Kanakampatti, in three days 52 died out of a population of 200. The deaths from cholera, in 1875-76, were 15,487; in 1876-77, 45,162; and in 1877, from July to November, 8002. Small-pox has to a great extent been stamped out, though during the famine, when the population was peculiarly predisposed to disease, exceptional mortality occurred. Dengue was prevalent in the latter part of 1872. Leprosy is not common. Cattle-disease is rarely absent, rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease being the most common forms.\n\nSalem (Selam).\u2014Chief town of Salem District, Madras, and a municipality, with the courts of the District Judge, Magistrate and munshi; a central jail, 2 churches, memorial hall, schools, hospital, etc. Lat. 11\u00b0 39' 10\" N., long. 78\u00b0 11' 47\" E.; pop. (1871), 49,681, dwelling in 7922 houses. Ninety per cent. of the population are Hindus. The river Tirumanimut\u00e1r divides the native town into two quarters. The Europeans live in a suburb named Hastanpet. The railway station lies in another suburb, Suramangalam, 3\u00bd miles distant. Salem is a busy\ntrading place, with a considerable weaving industry. The town is clean, and well cared for. Its old notoriety for endemic fever and cholera has disappeared before the sanitary improvements of the municipality. The town is prettily situated, 900 feet above sea level, in a long valley with the Shevaroy Hills towering above. These hills are only 6 miles distant, and the ascent to the plateau is only 7 miles. Though never a place of any military strength, its position in a much contested District has made it the scene of frequent fighting. It was first captured by Captain Wood in 1768. The municipal income of Salem in 1876-77 was \u00a33701; incidence of taxation, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of population (50,012) within municipal limits.\n\n**Salem (Chinna Salem, or Little Salem).**\u2014Village in South Arcot District, Madras. Lat. 11\u00b0 38' N., long. 78\u00b0 55' 30\" E.; pop. (1871), 5303, dwelling in 761 houses.\n\n**S\u00e1letekri.**\u2014Chiefship in B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t District, Central Provinces; comprising 71 villages; area, 284 square miles, chiefly hilly. This chiefship was probably one of the grants made for guarding the passes of the hill country, and has remained in the same family for many generations. The principal village is 50 miles south-east of B\u00farha. The country produces bamboos of the finest kind.\n\n**Salim\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Village and police station in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 4' 50\" N., long. 88\u00b0 2' 45\" E.; pop. (1872), under 5000.\n\n**Sal\u00edmpur.**\u2014Town in Lucknow District, Oudh; situated 20 miles from Lucknow city, on the road to Sult\u00e1npur. Pop. (1869), 2365, including some adjacent hamlets. Picturesquely situated on broken and high ground overlooking the Gumti river, the approach to it lying across a ravine spanned by a long bridge built since British annexation. Small Government school.\n\n**S\u00e1lkh\u00eda.**\u2014Northern suburb of Howrah, the chief town of H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Inhabitants largely engaged in river traffic. Permanent market.\n\n**S\u00e1ln\u00e1di.**\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See Salandi.\n\n**Salon.**\u2014Tahsil or Subdivision of R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh, lying between 25\u00b0 49' and 26\u00b0 19' N. lat., and between 81\u00b0 16' and 81\u00b0 39' E. long. Bounded on the north by Digbij\u00e1iganj tahsil, on the east by R\u00e1ipur and Part\u00e1bgarh tahsils, on the south by Fatehpur District in the North-Western Provinces, and on the west by the R\u00e1i Bareli tahsil. Area, 434 square miles, of which 209 are cultivated. Pop. (according to the Census of 1869, but allowing for recent transfers), 238,025, namely, 211,063 Hindus and 26,962 Muhammadans. Number of males, 119,084; of females, 118,941; number of villages or towns, 457; average density of population, 548 per square mile. This tahsil comprises the three parg\u00e1ns of Salon, Parsh\u00e1depur, and Rokh\u00e1 J\u00e1is.\n\n**Salon.**\u2014Parg\u00e1nd in R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; recently transferred\nfrom Part\u00e1bgarh District. A picturesque and interesting tract, bounded on the south by the Ganges and on the north by Parsh\u00e1depur pargan\u00e1. It is also watered by the S\u00e1i river, and is covered with jungle, in which the N\u00e1in idlukd\u00e1rs and other freebooters in the time of native rule built their forts. Wild cattle are found in large numbers. The banks of the river are steep and covered with brushwood. Area, 226 square miles, of which 110 are cultivated; pop. (1869), 120,545, viz. 109,630 Hindus and 10,915 Muhammadans. Of the Hindu population, 12,252 are Br\u00e1hmans, 6137 Kshattriyas, 15,940 Ah\u00edrs, 12,150 Cham\u00e1rs, and 12,118 Kurmis. Of the Kshattriyas, 4099 belong to the Kanhpuria clan, who are the principal landholders, owning 98 out of the 287 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1; Muhammadans own 78 villages. The Government land revenue falls at the rate of 3s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivable acre.\n\nSalon.\u2014Town in R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh, and headquarters of Salon tahsil and pargan\u00e1; situated on the road from Part\u00e1bgarh to R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town, in lat. 26\u00b0 1' 40\" N., and long. 81\u00b0 29' 50\" E. Pleasantly situated amid groves of mango and palm trees. Formerly a flourishing place, but now much reduced. Pop. (1869), 5155, viz. 2971 Muhammadans and 2184 Hindus, residing in 1026 mud-built and 85 masonry houses. Ten mosques; one Hindu temple. Government school. Average annual b\u00e1z\u00e1r sales, \u00a31000.\n\nSalsette.\u2014Large island to the north of Bombay, extending 16 miles from Bhand\u00e1ra northwards to the Bassein inlet. Lat. 19\u00b0 2' 30\" to 19\u00b0 18' 30\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 51' 30\" to 73\u00b0 3' E.; area, 150 square miles. Connected with Bombay Island by bridge and causeway. The sea-face is fringed with islands, and is distinguished by several remarkable peaks. The central and highest, Th\u00e1na (Tanna) Peak, is a flat-topped hill, 1530 feet high; on the north is another detached, sharp peak, 1500 feet above the sea. This beautiful island is rich in rice-fields, diversified by jungles and studded with hills. The ruins of Portuguese churches, convents, and villas attest its former importance, and its antiquities at Keneri still form a subject of interest. Seized by the Portuguese early in the 16th century, it should have passed to the English, together with Bombay Island, as part of the marriage portion of the queen of Charles II. The Portuguese in 1662, however, contested its alleged transfer under the marriage treaty, and it was not till more than a century afterwards that we obtained possession. The Marhatt\u00e1s took it from the declining Portuguese in 1739. The English captured it from the Marhatt\u00e1s in December 1774, and it was formally annexed to the East India Company's dominions in 1782 by the treaty of Salb\u00e1\u00ed. Salsette affords a deeply interesting field for the geologist and natural historian, and it occupies several paragraphs in the official Manual of the Geology of India. It will ever be associated with the name of Victor Jacquemont,\nas it formed the scene of his last labours; and from its jungles the brilliant Frenchman carried away the fever of which he shortly afterwards died at Bombay. The cave architecture of Salsette deserves notice. The great chaitya at Keneri, however, is pronounced by Fergusson to be merely a bad copy of the Karli cave. It belongs to the beginning of the 5th century, but 9 of its vih\u0101ras seem to be of earlier date. Salsette had, however, a sanctity of its own early in the 4th century as containing a tooth of Buddha; at the period, says Fergusson, 'when these relics were revolutionizing the Buddhist world\u2014at least at two diametrically opposite points of the coast of India, at Puri, and in this island. It may have been in consequence of the visit of this relic that the island became holy; and it may have been because it was an island that it remained undisturbed by the troubles of the mainland, and that the practice of excavating caves lasted longer here than in any series above described. Be this as it may, the caves here go straggling on till they fade by almost imperceptible degrees into those of the Hindu religion. The Hindu caves of Montpezir, Kanduti, and Amboli are so like them, and the change takes place so gradually, that it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between the two religions.'\n\nSalt Range.\u2014Hill system in Jhelum (Jhilam), Sh\u0101hpur, and Bannu (Bunnoo) Districts, Punjab, deriving its name from its extensive deposits of rock-salt. Lat. $32^\\circ 41'$ to $32^\\circ 56'$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 42'$ to $73^\\circ$ E. The main chain commences in the lofty hill of Chel, 3701 feet above the sea, which is formed by the convergence of three spurs cropping up from the Jhelum river, and divided from the Him\u0101layan outliers only by the interposition of the river valley. The most northern of these spurs rises abruptly from the river bank at Sult\u00e1npur, and runs nearly parallel with the Jhelum at a distance of 25 miles, till it joins the main chain after a course of 40 miles. It bears the local name of the N\u012bli Hills. The second spur, known as the Rot\u00e1s range, runs half-way between the N\u012bli Hills and the river, parallel with both. It contains the famous fort of Rot\u00e1s, and the hill of Tilla, the sanatorium of Jhelum District, with an elevation of 3242 feet above sea level. The third or Pabbi spur rises south of the Jhelum river, dips for a while on approaching the river valley, and rises once more on the northern bank, till it finally unites with the two other chains in the central peak of Chel. Thence the united range runs westward in two parallel ridges, till it culminates in the mountain of Sakeswar, in Sh\u0101hpur, which has an elevation of 4994 feet above sea level. Between these lines of hills, and topped by their highest summits, lies an elevated and fertile table-land, picturesquely intersected by ravines and peaks. In its midst nestles the beautiful lake of Kala Kah\u00e1r. The streams which take their rise in the tableland, however, become brackish before reaching the lowlands. The beds of salt, from which the range derives its name,\noccur in the shape of solid rock on the slopes of this tableland, and form the largest known deposits in the world. The mineral is quarried at the Mayo Mines, and at some other spots. Coal also occurs both in oolitic and tertiary strata; the former at K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh, employed as a fuel for the Indus steamers, and the latter between Jal\u00e1lpur and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n. It is of inferior quality, however, consisting of a brown lignite, difficult to set on fire, and yielding a very large proportion of ash. From Jhelum District, the Salt Range stretches into Sh\u00e1hpur and Bannu. The long spur which projects into the former District terminates in the hill of Sakeswar, and comprises a number of separate rock-bound alluvial basins, the largest of which, the S\u00fan and Khabbakki valleys, occupy the northern half, while the south consists of a broken country, cut up into tiny glens and ravines by a network of limestone ridges and connecting spurs. In the northern portion of the range, the drainage gathers into small lakes, and trees stud the face of the country; but southward, the streams flow through barren and stony gorges, interspersed with detached masses of rock, and covered with the stunted alkaline plants which grow on soil impregnated with salt. The Bannu portion of the range runs north-westward toward the Indus, which it meets at M\u00e1ri, opposite Kalabagh, and rising again on the western side, is continued in the Khattak-Maidani Hills. The scenery throughout the Range is rugged and often sublime, but wanting in softness and beauty. In many parts it becomes simply barren and uninviting. Besides salt and coal, many other valuable minerals occur in these hills.\n\nSalt-Water Lake (or Dh\u00e1pa).\u2014Lake in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated about 5 miles east of Calcutta, between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and Bidy\u00e1dhari rivers, and covering an area of about 30 square miles. Lat. $22^\\circ 28'$ to $22^\\circ 36'$ N., and long. $88^\\circ 25' 30\"$ to $88^\\circ 30' 30\"$ E. It contains a section of the Inner Sundarbans Passage for boats bound to Calcutta via B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1ta. The vicinity of the Salt-Water Lake is intersected by innumerable water-courses and rivers, which flood the country at spring-tides. A part of the lake is now in course of reclamation, by the sewage of Calcutta being deposited in it.\n\nS\u00e1l\u00far.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1l\u00far tdluk, Vizagapatam District, Madras. Lat. $18^\\circ 30' 40\"$ N., long. $83^\\circ 14' 50\"$ E.; pop. (1871), 10,633, inhabiting 2383 houses. Sub-magistrate's court, post office, dispensary, and good school. S\u00e1l\u00far is the residence of the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r, whose ancestors were feudatory to J\u00e1ipur (Jeypore), and afterwards to Vizian\u00e1garam. The latter power confiscated the estate in 1774, but the Company restored it to the old family twenty years later. The estate contains 177 villages, 20,870 houses, and (1871) 96,537 inhabitants, and pays a peshkash or fixed revenue of \u00a33600.\n\nSalw\u00edn (Salween).\u2014River of Tenasserim, British Burma, with a\ngeneral north and south course. The source of this river has never been explored; but the best authorities agree in stating that it is in proximity to the source of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy), far up in the snowy range which lies eastward of Assam in lat. 28\u00b0 N., and forms part of the Him\u00e1layan system of mountains. After traversing Yunan, a Chinese Province, and the Shan and Kareng-n\u00ed States lying south of it, the Salw\u00edn enters British Burma at its extreme north-eastern corner, and for some distance, as far as the Thoung-yeng river, marks the eastern limits of the Province. In this part of its course, the Salw\u00edn is a broad, swift stream, navigable by boats, and flowing between high, densely wooded mountains. Farther south, these gorges become narrower; and near the mouth of the Thoung-yeng, the breadth of the stream contracts so much that at places its bed does not occupy more than 30 yards. A few miles lower down, and about 100 miles from the sea, are the great rapids, formed by a bar of rocks stretching completely across the river, and impassable even by canoes during the dry season. In the rains, when the Salw\u00edn is swollen by the vast volume of water brought down from the extensive tract of country which it and its tributaries drain, the current is so strong, and the violence of its efforts to pass the rocky ledge so great, that even massive logs of timber are dashed to pieces. Farther south are other but less formidable rapids, impassable in the rains. Below, there are numerous islands and shoals covered during the floods, when the water rises 30 feet. A few miles lower down, after the Salw\u00edn has received the Rwon-za-leng from the west, the hills on the eastern bank recede, and those on the western diminish considerably in altitude; and the river traverses a more open and level country, with outcrops of limestone on both banks, rising abruptly out of the plain into lofty serrated ridges.\n\nAt Maulmain, the Salw\u00edn receives from the eastward the Gyaing, formed by the junction of the Hlaing-bhwai and the Houng-tharaw, and the Attaran, which joins the Gyaing at its mouth. Here the Salw\u00edn splits into two mouths\u2014the northern, flowing between Bhi-l\u00fa-gywon and the old town of Martaban, is unnavigable now by reason of sandbanks, but some centuries ago was the principal entrance. The southern branch flows past Maulmain, and falls into the sea at Amherst by a mouth 7 miles wide. By this channel vessels of the largest size can reach Maulmain, but navigation is rendered difficult by the shifting of the sands.\n\nVast quantities of teak from British and foreign forests are annually floated down the Salw\u00edn, and shipped at Maulmain for export. The timber is dragged into the forest streams by elephants, marked, and then washed in the rains into the Salw\u00edn, by which it is carried down in whirling masses until checked by a rope stretched across the river at Kyo-dan, about 56 miles above Maulmain. Large numbers of salvors\nassemble here in the season, and raft as many logs as they can, to be claimed by the owners, who pay salvage.\n\nThe area of the Salw\u00edn basin is 62,700 square miles; it is 800 miles in length, but seldom more than 100 miles in breadth. The upper part is conterminous on the east with that of the Me-kong or Cambodia river; lower down, it is bounded by the Meinam river, which belongs to Siam. The length of the main stream of the Salw\u00edn is estimated at 750 miles.\n\nSalw\u00edn Hill Tracts.\u2014A British District in Tenasserim Division, British Burma; extending from the northern frontier southwards to Kaw-ka-rit on the Salw\u00edn river, and occupying the whole of the country between that river on the east and the Poun-loung Mountains on the west. On the north it is bounded by Kareng-n\u00ed (Kareng-nee), on the east by Zeng-mai, on the south by Amherst and Shwe-gyeng, and on the west by Shwe-gyeng and Toung-ng\u00fa (Toung-ngoo). Estimated area, 4646 square miles; population (1872), 26,117 souls. From the annexation of Pegu until 1872, the Hill Tracts formed a Subdivision of Shwe-gyeng District, but in that year they were erected into a separate jurisdiction. The administrative headquarters are at PA-PWON.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The whole country is a wilderness of mountains. Even the valley of the Rwon-za-leng, the principal river after the Salw\u00edn, is, strictly speaking, only a long winding gorge. The direction of the mountains, of which there are three principal ranges, is generally north-north-west and south-south-east, but the spurs from the main system appear to be thrown in bewildering eccentric masses. The slopes are so precipitous, and so densely wooded, that the passage by laden animals is in many places impossible, and that of travellers on foot difficult and fatiguing in the extreme. It is through these hills that Shan caravans come down annually to Rangoon and Maulmain; and with the exception of the routes used by them, there are no roads over which laden bullocks can pass, baggage being carried on men's backs. The country is drained by three principal rivers\u2014the Salw\u00edn, the RWON-ZA-LENG, and the BHI-LENG (Bhee-leng)\u2014fed by numerous mountain torrents rushing down narrow ravines, over rocks and boulders, on their way to the larger streams, which partake of the nature of their impetuous tributaries, and dash themselves in foam over masses of rock, or whirl in wild eddies through ravines shut in by beetling crags and gigantic forest trees, covered with brilliant flowers or creepers. When these rivers emerge into the low country they entirely lose their picturesqueness, and sink into muddy streams, with no trace left of their former state but the rapidity of their currents. The Rwon-za-leng is navigable in the dry season as far as Pa-pwon. Within the limits of this District, the Bh\u00ed-leng is impracticable, except for rafts and small boats. The Salw\u00edn is impeded by impassable rapids.\nThe chief crops are rice and betel-nuts. The cultivation is almost entirely carried on in toungyas or nomadic clearings in the hills, except near Pa-pwon, and in the betel-gardens, which are permanent. The area under toungya cultivation in 1877 was 12,526 acres.\n\nThe population in 1872 was returned at 26,117; in 1877, at 26,649. The inhabitants are almost entirely Karengs; a few Shans are settled in the neighbourhood of Pa-pwon. The eastern portion of the Hill Tracts was formerly inhabited by Rwon Shans, whence the name Rwon-za-leng; but the larger number of these were brought away by Aloung-bhura to what is now the Syriam township of Rangoon.\n\nThe revenue is raised almost entirely from the land and capitation taxes. In 1876-77, the receipts amounted to only \u00a32491.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by an Assistant Commissioner, stationed at Pa-pwon, on the Rwon-za-leng. Under him are an extra-Assistant Commissioner and the th\u00fagy\u00ed (Thoogyee) of the six circles of Pa-pwon, Kaw-l\u00fa-do (Kaw-loo-do), Kaw-ka-rit, Kha-daing-ti (Kha-daing-tee), Mai-waing, and Weng-hpyaing. For some years after the country became British territory, it was in a very unsettled state, but the risings were speedily quelled. In 1867, fresh and more serious disturbances broke out. A chief named D\u00edpa attacked and plundered our villages, and threatened Pa-pwon; and from that time dacoities or gang robberies became frequent. This District forms the basis of operations of those who have purchased the right to fell timber in the vast teak tracts beyond the Salw\u00edn river. These foresters come up with large sums in cash, which they require for the payment of their workmen, or for dues to the various chiefs; and in consequence, the whole of the neighbouring country beyond our borders has become the haunt of men who acknowledge no fixed authority, but collect in bodies under some daring leader, fall upon the foresters, and attack our villages. In order to remedy this, the Salwin Hill Tracts were separated from Shwe-gyeng in 1872, and formed into a distinct administration, and the police were considerably strengthened. The Superintendent of the Tracts is ex officio Superintendent of Police, and in 1877 had a force under him of 17 subordinate officers and 227 men, of whom 12 were river police; of these, 158 were Karengs, who work well but will not serve for long. The constabulary is quartered at Kaw-l\u00fa-do, at Kyok-gnyat, and Dha-kweng on the Salw\u00edn, with a strong reserve at Pa-pwon.\n\nSamadiala Chabaria.\u2014One of the petty States in Gohelw\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 2 villages, with 5 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3650; \u00a3189 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a338 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gah.\n\nSamadiala Charan.\u2014One of the petty States of North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a380; no tribute is paid.\nSamadrala.\u2014One of the petty States of Undsarviya, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3800; \u00a351 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nS\u00e1maguting.\u2014Outpost and former headquarters of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District, Assam; situated in lat. $25^\\circ 45' 30''$ N., and long. $93^\\circ 46' E.$, on a tributary of the Dhaneswari river, 2477 feet above sea level, about 67 miles south of Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t in S\u00edb\u00e1s\u00e1g\u00e1r District. Estimated pop. 746. S\u00e1maguting was chosen as a British station in 1867, but abandoned in favour of Kohima in 1878. Information of the change reached me only in 1880, too late to insert Kohima in its proper place in Volume V. Kohima is better situated for the supervision of the N\u00e1gas; the site is healthy; the water-supply secured by an aqueduct; and the garrison strongly stockaded. There were the usual civil offices at S\u00e1maguting, a charitable dispensary, and a police outpost at the foot of the hill on which the station is built. A few M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri traders settled there. The country round is inhabited by the K\u00e1ch\u00e1 tribe of N\u00e1g\u00e1s. Rainfall, 63 inches.\n\nS\u00e1malkot.\u2014See SAMULKOTA.\n\nS\u00e1markha.\u2014Town in Kaira District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $22^\\circ 36' N.$, long. $73^\\circ 2' E.$; pop. (1872), 5231.\n\nSambalpur.\u2014A British District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 2'$ and $21^\\circ 57'$ N. lat., and between $83^\\circ 16'$ and $84^\\circ 21'$ E. long. Area (exclusive of the petty Native States attached to the District), 4407 square miles; pop. in 1872, 523,034. Inclusive of the attached Native States, Sambalpur is bounded on the north by Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; on the east and south by Cuttack District, Bengal; and on the west by Bil\u00e1spur and R\u00e1ipur Districts. The administrative headquarters are at SAMBALPUR TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Though included in the Chhat\u00edsgarh Division, Sambalpur forms no part of Chhat\u00edsgarh proper, either geographically or historically. The kh\u00e1lisa or Government portion of the District lies along the valley of the Mah\u00e1nadi, and constitutes a centre round which are clustered the feudatory States and chiefships of BAMRA, KAROND, PATNA, RAIGARH, RAIRAKHOL, SARANGARH, and SONPUR, which are noticed in their respective alphabetical places. This tract spreads out in an undulating plain, with ranges of rugged hills rising in every direction. The largest of these is the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, a mountain chain which covers 350 square miles, and attains at Debr\u00edgarh a height of 2267 feet above the plain. The main portion of this network of hills is situated in a bend of the Mah\u00e1nadi, by which river it is almost surrounded on three sides; but to the south-west an outlying ridge projects about 30 miles, as far as Singhora Gh\u00e1t or Pass, where the road from R\u00e1ipur to Sambalpur winds through it. From this point the hills continue\nin a southerly direction through Phuljhar, when they turn off abruptly to the westward. Singhora Pass has been the scene of many an action between the predatory Gonds of Phuljhar and their more civilised assailants from the Chhatisgarh country; and in 1857, our troops under Captain Wood, under Major Shakespear, and under Lieut. Rybot, had successively to fight their way through, when marching to the relief of Sambalpur. Another important range is that of Jargh\u00e1ti, which crosses the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur road 20 miles north of Sambalpur town. This also afforded a stronghold to the rebels. Its highest point is 1693 feet above the plain. To the southward a succession of broken ranges run parallel with the Mah\u00e1nadi for about 30 miles, the highest points being Mandhar, 1563 feet, and Bod\u00e1p\u00e1li, 2331 feet. Of the isolated hills and small ranges scattered over the District, the loftiest are\u2014Sun\u00e1ri, 1549 feet; Chel\u00e1, 1450 feet; and Rosor\u00e1, 1646 feet. The only important river is the Mah\u00e1nadi, which rises in R\u00e1ipur District, and, after entering Sambalpur, flows east and south-east for about 65 miles, passing Chandrapur and Padmapur, till it reaches the town of Sambalpur. It then rolls on towards the south for 45 miles, as far as Sonpur, where it bends to the east, finally falling into the sea in Orissa. As far as Chandrapur, its bed is fairly free from obstructions, but from that point to beyond Bod, boulders, jhd\u00fa jungle, and even trees impede its current. The principal affluents in Sambalpur are the Ib, Kel\u00fa, and Jhir\u00e1. The District is well cultivated, especially west of the Mah\u00e1nadi, where, with the exception of the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r tract, the jungle and forest have been completely cleared, nothing being left but mango, mahua, and other fruit-trees, and here and there a small patch of s\u00e1l. Nearly every village has its tank, often large and deep, but nowhere faced with stone. The Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r Hills are covered with dense jungle; but scattered here and there, small villages, with a fringe of cultivation, nestle in the valleys. The kh\u00e1lsa, however, yields but little valuable timber. The chiefships contain tracts of s\u00e1l, s\u00e1j, dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, bije-s\u00e1l, and ebony; and in the Garjh\u00e1t States of Phuljhar and R\u00e1irakhol spread vast forests of s\u00e1l. In Sambalpur, the soil is generally light and sandy. Crystalline metamorphic rocks occupy the greater part of the District; but part of the north-west corner is composed of the sandstone, limestone, and shale, which cover so large an area in Chhatisgarh. In the north occur outlying patches of soft sandstone. Iron-ore is found in most of the chiefships and Garjh\u00e1t or Hill States, the finest quality being supplied by R\u00e1irakhol. Sambalpur has excellent sandstone for building purposes. Limestone also abounds; and the Mah\u00e1nadi, near Padmapur, contains large masses of this rock of a purity resembling marble. Gold dust is yielded by the Mah\u00e1nadi and the Ib; and diamonds are occasionally found at the junction of these rivers, near an island called H\u00edrakhud\u00e1 or the Diamond Isle. In\nneither case, however, is the supply such as to make the business of collecting remunerative.\n\n**History.**\u2014According to tradition, the first R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Samb\u00e1lpur was Balr\u00e1n Deva, a brother of Narsinh Deva, the 12th Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Patn\u00e1, then the head of the Garhj\u00e1t States. *(See Patna State.)* Balr\u00e1n Deva obtained from his brother a grant of the jungle country lying beyond the Ung, a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nadi, and gradually acquired a considerable territory by conquest from the neighbouring chiefs of Sarguj\u00e1, G\u00e1ngpur, Bonai, and B\u00e1mr\u00e1. His eldest son, Har\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Deva, who followed in 1493, settled the country now called Sonpur on his second son, Madan Gop\u00e1l, whose descendants still hold it. During the next two centuries the power of Sambalpur steadily increased, while that of Patn\u00e1 continued to decline. When Ubhaya Sinh succeeded, in 1732, these aggressive chiefs first came in contact with the spreading power of the Marhatt\u00e1s. Some guns of large calibre were passing from Cuttack up the Mah\u00e1nadi, in order to be transported to N\u00e1gpur. Akbar R\u00e1ya, the minister, caused the boatmen to scuttle the boats in deep water, and many Marhatt\u00e1 artillerymen were drowned. Akbar R\u00e1ya subsequently recovered the guns, and had them mounted on the Sambalpur fort. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur sent a strong detachment to avenge the insult and regain the guns, but it was repulsed with slaughter. About 1797, in the reign of Jeth Sinh, successor to Ubhaya Sinh, another quarrel with the Marhatt\u00e1s arose. N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, a relation of the N\u00e1gpur R\u00e1j\u00e1, with a large party, was making a pilgrimage to Jagann\u00e1th, when he was treacherously attacked by the people of S\u00e1ran-garh and Sambalpur, as well as of Sonpur and Bod. He pushed on, however, to Cuttack, where he found some Marhatt\u00e1 troops. Returning with these, after some severe fighting, he took prisoner the Bod chief and Pr\u00edthwi Sinh, the chief of Sonpur. As soon as the rains were over, he appeared before Sambalpur, and regularly invested the town. Jeth Sinh, however, had meantime strengthened the fort, and it was only after a five months\u2019 siege that the N\u00e1n\u00e1 succeeded in crossing the moat and forcing the Saml\u00e1\u00ed gate. After a fierce contest, the Marhatt\u00e1s captured the fort, and carried off Jeth Sinh and his son Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1 as prisoners to N\u00e1gpur. Bh\u00fap Sinh, a Marhatt\u00e1 jam\u00e1dd\u00e1r, was left to administer Sambalpur on behalf of the N\u00e1gpur Government. Soon, however, he assumed an independent position; and when a large force was sent from N\u00e1gpur to compel his obedience, he called in the aid of the R\u00e1igarh and S\u00e1rangarh people, and routed the Marhatt\u00e1s at the Singhora Pass. A second force was sent from N\u00e1gpur, and, assisted by Chamr\u00e1 G\u00e1onthiy\u00e1, whose enmity Bh\u00fap Sinh had provoked by plundering his village, seized the pass, and almost annihilated Bh\u00fap Sinh\u2019s army. The conquered chief fled to Sambalpur, and, taking with him the R\u00e1n\u00eds of Jeth Sinh, made his way\n\nVOL. VIII.\nto Kol\u00e1bir\u00e1. While there, he implored the help of the British on behalf of the R\u00e1n\u00eds; and Captain Roughsedge, with a portion of the R\u00e1mgarh local battalion, was sent to Sambalpur in 1804. Raghoj\u00e1 Bhonsl\u00e1, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, however, remonstrated with the British Government for thus interfering with a country he had fairly conquered, and the British restored Sambalpur to him. For some years, the District continued under Marhatt\u00e1 rule, while Jeth Sinh and his son remained in confinement at Ch\u00e1nda; but Major Roughsedge pleaded their cause so energetically, that in 1817 Jeth Sinh was restored to power. He died in the following year. After some months, during which the British Government held the country, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1, his son, was made R\u00e1j\u00e1, though without the feudal superiority of his predecessors over the other chiefships; while Major Roughsedge was established at Sambalpur as Assistant Agent. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j S\u00e1 died in 1827, and his widow, R\u00e1n\u00ed Mohan Kum\u00e1ri, succeeded. Immediately disturbances broke out, the most prominent of the rebels being Surendra S\u00e1 and Govind Sinh, both Chauh\u00e1ns and pretenders to the chiefship. Villages were plundered to within a few miles of Sambalpur; and though Lieutenant Higgins drove off the rebels, it became necessary for the Agent, Captain Wilkinson, to proceed from Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh to Sambalpur. After hanging some of the insurgents, Captain Wilkin-son deposed the R\u00e1n\u00ed, and set up in her place N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Sinh, a descendant by a woman of inferior caste from Bali\u00e1r Sinh, third R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Sinh accepted his elevation very unwillingly, foreseeing the difficulties which followed immediately on the withdrawal of the British troops. Balabhadra S\u00e1, the Gond chief of Lakhapur, was the first to rise, but at length he was killed at his refuge in the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r Hills. In 1839, Major Guseley became Assistant Agent at Sambalpur; and in the same year, great disturbances occurred, caused chiefly by Surendra S\u00e1, who claimed the throne as being descended from Madhukar S\u00e1, fourth R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur. In 1840, he and two of his relations murdered the son and father of Dary\u00e1o Sinh, chief of R\u00e1mpur, and were sent as life prisoners to the jail of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. In 1849, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Sinh died without male issue, and Sambalpur lapsed to the British Government. The first acts of the new rule were to raise the revenue assessments by one-fourth; and to resume the land grants, religious or otherwise. The Br\u00e1hmans, a powerful community in Sambalpur, went up in a body to R\u00e1nch\u00ed to appeal, but gained no redress. In 1854, a second land settlement again raised the assessments everywhere by one-fourth. Such a system of exaction and confiscation produced its natural results. When the Mutiny broke out three years later, the sepoys released Surendra S\u00e1 and his brother from jail, who immediately proceeded to Sambalpur. Nearly all the chiefs at once joined them, though Govind Sinh, the rival pretender\nof 1827, held aloof. Surendra S\u00e1 established himself with a large force in the ruins of the old fort, but was induced to give himself up to Captain Leigh. Soon afterwards, however, he escaped, and joined the rebels in the hills. From that time to 1862, the British troops in vain endeavoured to hunt him down. The most daring atrocities were committed by his band: villages friendly to the Government were plundered and burnt; Dr. Moore, a European officer, was murdered; and Lieutenant Woodbridge was killed in a fight on the Rar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, and his head carried off. The proclamation of amnesty failed to win the submission of the rebels. In 1861, Major Impey was placed in charge at Sambalpur, and adopted a conciliatory policy. By lavish rewards to the chiefs who gave themselves up, he succeeded in dispersing the rebel band, and procuring the surrender in May 1862 of Surendra S\u00e1 himself. The next year, however, the disturbances recommenced. Sambalpur had recently been incorporated with the Central Provinces, and the opportunity was seized of the first visit of Mr. Temple, the Chief Commissioner, to present a petition praying for the restoration of native rule in the person of Surendra S\u00e1. This was followed by the rising of Kamal Sinh, one of Surendra S\u00e1\u2019s captains during the rebellion, and by the recurrence of aggravated outrages. At length, on 23rd January 1864, Surendra S\u00e1 was finally arrested. No legal proof of his complicity with the rebels was forthcoming; but he was placed in confinement with some of his relations and adherents as a dangerous political offender, and since then profound peace has reigned throughout the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Native States attached to Sambalpur District are elsewhere noticed in their respective places. (See Karond, Sonpur, Rairakhol, Raigarh, Bamra, Patna, and Saranggarh.) The following statistics will therefore be confined to the kh\u00e1lisa country\u2014the British District. A rough enumeration of the population was taken in 1866, but its results cannot be relied on in this District. The more careful Census of 1872 disclosed a population of 523,034 persons. Although the latest estimate (1877) indicates a total of 549,714, the Census of 1872 still remains the only basis for a detailed examination of the people. It showed, as already stated, a population of 523,034 persons, residing on an area of 4407 square miles, in 1710 villages or townships and 98,166 houses. Persons per square mile, 118\u00b768; villages per square mile, 0\u00b739; houses per square mile, 22\u00b727; persons per village, 305\u00b787; persons per house, 5\u00b732. Classified according to sex\u2014males, 264,847; females, 258,187. According to age, the male children in 1877 numbered 98,954, the female children 96,542. Ethnical division in 1877\u2014Europeans, 9; Eurasians, 12; aboriginal tribes, 184,715; Hindus, 362,739; Muhammadans, 2255. There are no Buddhists or Jains, and the Muhammadans constitute\nless than 0.5 per cent. of the population, a proportion smaller than in any other District of the Central Provinces. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes are the Savars (53,603 in 1872) and the Gonds (43,687), the remainder consisting of Kols, Bhils, Binjwals, Khonds, etc. Among the Hindus, in 1872, Br\u0101hmans numbered 17,552; the mass of the Hindu population consisting of Gaurs (60,026), Gandas (57,425), Koltas (54,258), Keuts (22,233), Telis (15,350), and other cultivating or inferior castes. Native Christians in 1877, 4. No town in Sambalpur District has a population exceeding 5000, with the exception of Sambalpur, the administrative headquarters (pop. in 1872, 11,020). Number of townships with from 1000 to 5000 inhabitants, 90; with from 200 to 1000, 655; villages with fewer than 200 inhabitants, 964. Sambalpur, the only municipality, had in 1876-77 a population within municipal limits of 11,695. The income for that year amounted to \u00a3480, of which \u00a3353 was derived from taxation, being 6\u00bdd. per head; the expenditure was \u00a3506.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4407 square miles, only 2089 are cultivated; and of the portion lying waste, 746 are returned as cultivable. None of the land is irrigated. The Government assessment is at the rate of 4d. per acre of cultivated land, and 1\u00bdd. per acre of cultivable land. Rice forms the staple crop, and in 1876 occupied 990,590 acres. No wheat was grown, but other food grains were produced on 212,250 acres; while 67,100 acres were devoted to oil-seeds, 56,500 to cotton, and 10,520 to sugar-cane. The Census of 1872 showed a total of 2241 proprietors, of whom 1706 were classed as 'inferior' ones. The tenants numbered 47,522, of whom 44,381 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while only 3141 were tenants-at-will. The rent rates per acre for the different qualities of land were returned as follows in 1876:\u2014Land suited for rice, 1s.; for inferior grain, cotton, oil-seeds, or sugar-cane, 3d. The ordinary prices of produce per cwt. were\u2014rice, 3s. 8d.; gram, 3s. 5d.; cotton, 27s. 4d. The wages per diem for skilled labour averaged 7\u00bdd.; for unskilled labour, 3d.\n\nTrade and Commerce.\u2014The manufactures of Sambalpur are few and unimportant. The Koshtfs, however, weave tasar silk cloth of an even texture and unfading lustre; and the K\u00e1nw\u00e1rs manufacture vessels of brass and bell metal. Nearly every village also contains weavers of coarse cotton cloth, and the Son\u00e1rs make rude ornaments of gold and silver. The principal exports from the District are rice, oil-seeds, raw sugar, stick-lac, tasar silk, cotton, and iron. Principal imports\u2014salt, refined sugar, European piece-goods, cocoa-nuts, muslins, fine cloths of native make, and metals. The chief trade is with Cuttack and Mirzapur. In the Orissa famine of 1866-67, no less than 30,178 maunds (about 1100 tons) of rice, valued at \u00a310,171, were exported to Cuttack. None of the roads in Sambalpur is bridged or metalled. The chief\nlines of communication are the roads from Sambalpur town to R\u00e1ipur via S\u00e1nkra on the Jonk river; and to Cuttack via Rair\u00e1khol and Ang\u00fal. Tracks also lead from Sambalpur to the Bil\u00e1spur frontier, by Padmapur and Chandrapur, to B\u00ednka, and towards R\u00e1nch\u00ed. The Mah\u00e1nadi affords means of communication by water for 90 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Sambalpur was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsil-d\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1876-77, \u00a319,560, of which the land yielded \u00a38869. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a310,921; number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 6; magistrates, 8. Maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 60 miles; average distance, 25 miles. Number of police, 335, costing \u00a35404; being 1 policeman to about every 12 miles and every 1398 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1876 was 98, of whom 9 were females. The total cost of the jails in that year was \u00a3582. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 276, attended by 12,348 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average temperature in the shade at the civil station during 1876 is returned as follows:\u2014May, highest reading 114\u00b05' F., lowest 44\u00b0 F.; July, highest 108\u00b05' F., lowest 73\u00b0 F.; December, highest 92\u00b0 F., lowest 42\u00b0 F. The rainfall for that year amounted to 61\u00b057 inches, the average being 55\u00b076 inches. The climate of Sambalpur is considered very unhealthy. The prevailing disease is fever, especially from September to November. It proves most fatal to new-comers, natives as well as Europeans. Bowel complaints are also common and deadly, and cholera appears nearly every hot season, owing to the gatherings at the temple of Jagann\u00e1th at Purl. In 1876, two charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 11,055 in-door and out-door patients. The death-rate per thousand was returned at 25\u00b018, the mean of the previous five years being 20\u00b076, but these figures cannot be trusted.\n\nSambalpur.\u2014Tahsil or Subdivision of Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. Area, 1684 square miles; pop. (1872), 224,576, residing in 624 villages or townships and 41,431 houses.\n\nSambalpur.\u2014Principal town and administrative headquarters of Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. Pop. (1872), 11,020. The town is situated in lat. 21\u00b0 27' 10\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 1' E., on the north bank of the Mah\u00e1nadi, which, during the rainy season, becomes nearly a mile broad, but at other times flows in a small stream 50 yards in width. Opposite the town and station, the river bed is a mass of rocks covered with thick jh\u00e1\u00fa jungle; on each side the banks are richly wooded with mango and other groves, while to the south rises a stately background\nof lofty hills. The town proper has been much improved since 1864, when a cart could only with great difficulty pass through the main street. To the north-west lie the ruins of the fort\u2014a crumbling stone wall on the river face, and a few mouldering bastions. The moat can still be traced; but no gateway remains except that of Saml\u00e1i, near the temple of the goddess of that name, who was apparently the tutelary divinity of Sambalpur. Within the fort stand several other temples, the principal of which are those of Padmeswari Devi, Bar\u00e1 Jagann\u00e1th, and Anant Sajj\u00e1, all built during the 16th century. They are of uniform design, and remarkable neither for elegance nor solidity.\n\nBeyond the fort extends the Bar\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r, originally a mere market-place, but now a populous suburb. Besides the Government court-house and the Subdivisional office on the river bank, the principal buildings are the Commissioner's circuit-house, post office, a jail lately built on the standard plan, and 2 sardis, as well as a handsome terrace-roofed market-place. A native gentleman has lately built a dispensary with female wards, and a District schoolhouse. Till recently, cholera visited the town almost every year, owing chiefly to the influx of pilgrims returning from Jagann\u00e1th. Of late, however, sanitary precautions have done much to prevent the epidemic, and the increase of vaccination is gradually restraining the ravages of small-pox. Municipal revenue in 1876-77, \u00a3480; incidence of taxation, 7\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Sambhal.**\u2014Tahsil of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, lying in the plain country between the Sot and the Ganges. Area, 463 square miles, of which 344 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 227,011; land revenue, \u00a329,119; total Government revenue, \u00a329,623; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a362,502; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 1s. 11\u00bdd.\n\n**Sambhal.**\u2014Municipal town in Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of the tahsil. Pop. (1872), 46,974, consisting of 18,417 Hindus and 28,547 Muhammadans. Stands in lat. 28\u00b0 35' 5\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 36' 30\" E., on the Al\u00edgarh road, 22 miles southwest of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d town, and 4 miles west of the Sot river, in the midst of a cultivated and well-wooded plain. The modern town covers the summit of an extensive mound, composed of remains and d\u00e9bris of the ancient city. Two heaps of ruins, known as Bhaleswar and Bikteswar, mark the old bastions of the city wall. Headquarters of the Musalm\u00e1n Government from the earliest period of Muhammandan supremacy. Capital of a sark\u00e1r under Akbar. Centre of local grain trade. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a32138; from taxes, \u00a31662, or 11\u00bdd. per head of population (34,871) within municipal limits.\n\n**Sambhar.**\u2014Lake in J\u00e1ipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. It lies between 26\u00b0 52' and 27\u00b0 2' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 57' and 75\u00b0 16' E. long., and is situated on the joint border of the J\u00e1ipur and Jodhpur\nStates, east of the Aravalli range of hills. The surrounding country is arid and sterile, being composed of rocks abounding in limestone and salt, and belonging to the Permian system; and it is supposed that the salt of the lake is derived from the washings of these rocks. The bottom consists of a tenacious black mud, resting on loose sand. When full, the lake forms a sheet of water measuring about 20 miles in length, from 1\u00bd to 7\u00bd miles in breadth, and from 1 to 4 feet in depth. After the rains, in August and September, the waters of the lake begin to evaporate, and this process goes on almost uninterruptedly from October to June. During the ten years, 1835 to 1844, the Government of India, in order to repay itself a portion of the expenses incurred in repelling the predatory incursions of the R\u00e1jputs into British territory, took the salt-making into its own hands; but with this exception, the lake has been owned and worked jointly by the J\u00e1ipur and Jodhpur Governments from the 17th century to 1870, when the British Government became lessees under separate treaties concluded with the J\u00e1ipur and Jodhpur chiefs. The average yearly out-turn of salt is 900,000 maunds (between 3000 and 4000 tons), and the cost of storage and extraction about 6 p\u00eeas (three farthings) a maund (82\u00bd lbs. av.). As soon as the salt is formed, native labourers of both sexes, belonging chiefly to the Barr\u00e1r caste, wade out to it through the mud, and placing their hands under the salt crust, lift it off in good-sized cakes into baskets. A man brings to shore in this way about half a ton of salt a day. The salt is of three colours, blue, white, and red, the varieties being said to be due to the presence of microscopic algae. The bluish grey salt is commonest, and is much esteemed, particularly in the North-Western Provinces, whither it is largely exported. The white salt is most valued in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, particularly in J\u00e1ipur; while in the Muhammadan State of Tonk, the red is the favourite colour. The lake supplies nearly the whole of the chief salt marts of the Punjab, North-Western Provinces, and Central India. According to travellers in the early part of this century, the dimensions of the lake were larger than they are at present, and reached as much as 50 miles in length by 10 in breadth during periods of heavy rain.\n\nSambhuganj.\u2014Town in Maimansinh District, Bengal; 3 miles east of Nasr\u00e1b\u00e1d. Pop. (1872), 2257. One of the busiest marts in the District for country produce of all kinds; large exports of jute. In 1876-77, the registered exports from Sambhuganj included 72,000 maunds of jute (mostly sent direct to Calcutta), 31,000 maunds of rice, and 9500 maunds of mustard seed. Seat of the court of the subordinate judge of M\u00e1d\u00e1rganj.\n\nSameswari (Someswari, or Sams\u00e1ng).\u2014River in the G\u00e1ro Hills, Assam. Rising near the station of Tur\u00e1, it flows first in an easterly direction along the north of the Tur\u00e1 range, and then turns south\nthrough a picturesque gorge and finds its way into the plains in the Bengal District of Maimansinh. It finally empties itself into the Kanks river in pargan\u00e1 Sus\u00e1ng. Both in size and utility, the Sameswari is the most important river in the G\u00e1ro Hills. It is navigable upwards as high as Siju, about 20 miles within the hills. Here its channel is interrupted by a bed of granite rocks and rapids. In several other portions of its course it again becomes navigable for canoes. Valuable outcrops of coal have been discovered and surveyed in the Sameswari valley, but none has yet been worked. Limestone of good quality abounds on the river banks, and there are some curious caverns in the limestone formation. In its upper course are several magnificent gorges, with rocky cliffs, clothed in tropical vegetation. The water swarms with fish, including the excellent m\u00e1hsir; and the G\u00e1ros are enthusiastic fishermen.\n\nSami.\u2014Town in R\u00e1dhanpur State, Bombay; situated on the river Saraswat\u00ed, in lat. $23^\\circ 41' 15''$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 50' E.$ Pop.

Area, 175 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 108,000; estimated revenue, \u00a340,000. S\u00e1mthar is bounded on the north and west by Gwalior; on the south-west, south, and south-east by the British District of Jh\u00e1nsi; and on the east by Jal\u00e1un District. The State of S\u00e1mthar was separated from Datiya only one generation previous to the British occupation of Bundelkhand. When the British first entered the Province, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Sinh requested to be taken into the friendship and under the protection of the British Government; but nothing definite was done till 1817, when a treaty\nwas concluded with him. The chief is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. He has received the right of adoption. The military forces of the State are 300 cavalry and 2000 infantry, with 35 guns and 150 gunners.\n\n**S\u00e1nthar.**\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1nthar State, Bundelkhand. Lat. 25\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 55' E.\n\n**S\u00e1mulkota** (Ch\u00e1marlakota).\u2014Town in God\u00e1vari District, Madras; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 3' 10\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 12' 50\" E., 7 miles north of Coconada. Pop. (1871), 5535, inhabiting 1782 houses. It was formerly a military station, but was abandoned in January 1869. The barracks, first built in 1786, still remain. S\u00e1mulkota is connected by canals with R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (Rajahmundry) and Coconada.\n\n**Sanala.**\u2014One of the petty States of Undsarviya, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3270; \u00a330 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 30s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**S\u00e1nand.**\u2014Chief town of the S\u00e1nand Subdivision of Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay; situated 16 miles west of Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d city, in lat. 22\u00b0 59' N., and long. 72\u00b0 25' 30\" E.

Post office and dispensary.\n\n**San\u00e1wan.**\u2014Northern tahsil of Muzaffargarh District, Punjab; consisting of a high central upland, almost barren, known as the thal, together with two strips of lowland along the banks of the Indus and the Chen\u00e1b. Area, 1330 square miles; pop. (1868), 75,172; persons per square mile, 56.\n\n**San\u00e1war.**\u2014Plot of land in Simla District, Punjab. Made over by the British Government in 1852 as the site of the Lawrence Military Asylum. That building stands in lat. 30\u00b0 54' 35\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 2' 10\" E., on a hill facing Kasauli, from which it is 3 miles distant.\n\n**S\u00e1nchi.**\u2014Village in the Native State of Bhop\u00e1l; situated on the left bank of the Betwa river, about 5\u00bd miles south-west of Bhilsa, and 20 miles north-east of the city of Bhop\u00e1l. S\u00e1nchi is famous as the site of some of the most extensive and remarkable Buddhist remains in India, the centre of the great group described by General Cunningham under the name of 'The Bhilsa Topes.'\n\nThe present village of S\u00e1nchi is situated on a low ridge of sandstone, the general direction of which is from north to south, the whole summit of the hill being covered with ruins. The hill is flat-topped and isolated, with a steep cliff to the eastward, and to the westward an easy slope, covered with jungle at the foot, and near the top broken into steps by horizontal ledges of rock.\n\nThe principal buildings which now remain occupy only the middle part of the level top, and a narrow belt leading down the hill to the\nwestward. They consist of one great stupa or tope, with its railing and other adjuncts; about ten smaller stupas, some now showing nothing more than the foundations; a stone bowl, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in diameter and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet deep, supposed to have once contained Buddha's holy nettle, and other objects of antiquarian interest. The summit of the hill, on which these remains are found, has a gentle slope in the same direction as the dip of the strata; and the level of the court of the great stupa is some 12 or 15 feet below that of a ruined vih\u0101ra and temple on the eastern edge of the precipice. The hill, which is about 300 feet in height, is formed of a light red sandstone, hard and compact in texture, but subject to split. This stone has been used for all the topes and other buildings where mere hardness and durability were required; but for the colonnades and sculptured gateways, a fine-grained white sandstone was brought from the Udayagiri Hill, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to the northward. The village is now very small; but the numerous ruins scattered over the hill between S\u00e1nchi and K\u00e1nakhera show that there once was a large town on this site.\n\nFergusson (History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, 1876, page 61) thus writes of this group of remains:\n\n'The principal of these, known as the Great Tope at S\u00e1nchi, has been frequently described, the smaller ones are known from General Cunningham's descriptions only; but altogether they have excited so much attention that they are perhaps better known than any group in India. We are not, however, perhaps justified in assuming, from the greater extent of this group as now existing, that it possessed the same pre-eminence in Buddhist times. If we could now see the topes that once adorned any of the great Buddhist sites in the Do\u00e1b or Behar, the Bhilsa group might sink into insignificance. It may only be that, situated in a remote and thinly peopled part of India, they have not been exposed to the destructive energy of opposing sects of the Hindu religion, and the bigoted Moslem has not wanted their materials for the erection of his mosques. They consequently remain to us, while it may be that nobler and more extensive groups of monuments have been swept from the face of the earth.\n\n'Notwithstanding all that has been written about them, we know very little that is certain regarding their object and their history. Our usual guides, the Chinese Pilgrims, fail us here. Fa-Hian never was within some hundreds of miles of the place; and if Hiouen Thsang ever was there, it was after leaving Ballabhi (Valabhi), when his journal becomes so wild and curt that it is difficult, sometimes impossible, to follow him. He has, at all events, left no description by which we can now identify the place, and nothing to tell us for what purpose the Great Tope or any of the smaller ones were erected. The Mah\u00e1wanso, it is true, helps us a little in our difficulties. It is there narrated\nthat Asoka when on his way to Ujjain, of which place he had been nominated governor, tarried some time at Ch\u00e9tyagiri, or, as it is elsewhere called, Wessanagara, the modern B\u00edsnagar, close to S\u00e1nchi. He there married Devi, the daughter of the chief, and by her had twin sons, Ujjenio and Mahindo, and afterwards a daughter, Sanghamitta. The two last-named entered the priesthood, and played a most important part in the introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon. Before setting out on this mission, Mahindo visited his royal mother at Ch\u00e9tyagiri, and was lodged in \"a superb vih\u00e1ra,\" which had been erected by herself. In all this there is no mention of the Great Tope, which may have existed before that time; but till some building is found in India which can be proved to have existed before that age, it will be safe to assume that this is one of the 84,000 topes said to have been erected by Asoka. Had S\u00e1nchi been one of the eight cities which obtained relics of Buddha at the funeral pyre, the case might have been different; but it has been dug into, and found to be a stupa, and not a daghoba. It consequently was erected to mark some sacred spot or to commemorate some event, and we have no reason to believe that this was done anywhere before Asoka's time.\n\nOn the other hand, two smaller topes on the same platform contained relics of an undoubted historical character. That called No. 2 Tope contained those of ten Buddhist teachers who took part in the third great convocation held under Asoka, and some of whom were sent on missions to foreign countries, to disseminate the doctrines then settled; and No. 3 Tope contained two relic caskets. One of these enclosed relics of Maha Moggalana, the other of Sariputra, friends and companions of Buddha himself, and usually called his right and left hand disciples. It does not of course follow that this daghoba is as old as the time of Buddha; on the contrary, some centuries must elapse before a bone or rag belonging to any mortal becomes so precious that a dome is erected to enshrine it. The great probability seems to be that these relics were deposited there by Asoka himself, in close proximity to the sacred spot, which the Great Tope was erected to commemorate. The tope containing relics of his contemporaries must of course be much more modern, probably contemporary with the gateways, which are subsequent to the Christian era.'\n\nS\u00e1ndi.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north and west by pargan\u00e1s B\u00e1wan, Barw\u00e1n, and Kati\u00e1ri; on the south-west and south by the Ganges and pargan\u00e1 B\u00edlgr\u00e1m; and on the east by pargan\u00e1 Bangar. The pargan\u00e1 is intersected by the Garra river from north to south, and the R\u00e1mganga flows irregularly along or near its western and south-western border. It is divided into two distinct portions by an irregular sandy ridge, which, running from north to south immediately to the east of S\u00e1ndi town, marks the bank of an ancient\nchannel of the Ganges, long since abandoned by the river in its gradual westward recession. All the villages on and to the east of this ridge are poor, uneven, and sandy. Irrigation is scanty and difficult. On the other hand, all the country to the west of the ridge, or about four-fifths of the total area of the pargan\u00e1, is a distinctly alluvial tract, levelled and enriched by the floods of three Him\u00e1layan rivers, the Garra, R\u00e1m-ganga, and the Ganges, and by minor streams such as the Sendha. All this tract is tardi; that is to say, it has been scooped by fluvial action out of the adjacent bangar or original plateau; and in it the water level is always so near the surface that in the dry months percolation largely supplies the want of irrigation, while in the rainy season it is more or less completely flooded. It constitutes, in fact, the flood basin of the three rivers named above. In heavy floods such as those of 1871, a sea of waters spread from S\u00e1ndi to Fatehgarh, 20 miles west. The rivers bring down a rich alluvial deposit locally called sev, which fertilizes the submerged fields and makes manuring unnecessary. The silt brought down by the R\u00e1mganga in heavy floods is sometimes spread 2 feet thick over the fields. Area, 168 square miles, of which 107 square miles are cultivated. Chief products\u2014wheat, barley, rice, bajra, gram, jo\u00e1r, and arhar. Pop. (1869), 69,751, namely, 64,252 Hindus and 5499 Muhammadans. Of the 141 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 80\u00bd are held by Kshattriyas, 26 by Muhammadans, 11\u00bd by Br\u00e1hmans, 5\u00bd by Lodhs, 4 by K\u00e1yasths, 1\u00bd by Ah\u00edrs, and 12 by Government. T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rt tenure prevails in 30\u00bd villages, samind\u00e1rt in 61\u00bd, and pattid\u00e1rt in 49. Government land revenue, \u00a312,721; equal to an average of 3s. 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre, or 2s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of total area.\n\nS\u00e1ndi.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh, and headquarters of S\u00e1ndi pargan\u00e1; situated on the left bank of the Garra river, on the old route from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur via Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d to Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0 17' 15\" N., long. 79\u00b0 59' 45\" E. A considerable town, with a population (1869) of 11,123. It has a local reputation for the manufacture of a description of cotton carpets (kalim). Station of the opium department. Numerous handsome mosques and tombs of Muhammadan saints. A fine sar\u00e1di or travellers' rest-house is situated in the market in the Naw\u00e1bganj quarter of the town.\n\nSandila.\u2014Tahsil or Subdivision of Hardoi District, Oudh, lying between 26\u00b0 53' and 27\u00b0 21' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 18' and 80\u00b0 52' E. long. Bounded on the north by Hardoi and Misrikh, on the east by Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the south by Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d and Moh\u00e1n, and on the west by B\u00edlgr\u00e1m tahsils. Area, 557 square miles, of which 317 are cultivated; pop. (1869), 230,300, namely, Hindus, 204,438, and Muhammadans, 25,862. Number of males, 121,340; of females, 108,960; number of villages or towns, 416; average density of population, 413.\nThis tahsil comprises the four parganas of Sandila, Kalyanmal, Balamau, and Gundwa.\n\n**Sandila.**\u2014Pargana of Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Gopamau; on the east by Gundwa and Kalyanmal; on the south and south-west by Mohan, Auras, Safipur, and Bangarmau; on the west by Balamau and Mallanwan parganas. A poorly wooded tract, with a large area of barren and sandy soil. Area, 329 square miles, of which 170 square miles are cultivated. Chief products\u2014barley, wheat, bajra, gram, arhar, mash, and joar. At the time of the survey, barley occupied a fourth of the cultivated area; wheat a fifth; bajra and gram together, rather more than a fifth; while another fifth was cropped with arhar, mash, joar, and rice. Other crops\u2014cotton, sugar-cane, poppy, tobacco, and indigo. Pop. (1869), 137,275, viz. Hindus, 117,371, and Muhammadans, 19,904. Of the 213 villages comprising the pargana, 82 are held by Kshatriyas, 81 by Muhammadans, 41 by Kayasths, 5 by Brahmins, 2 by Kurmis, and 1 each by Kalwars and Lodhs. Talukdari tenure obtains in 114 villages, 70 are samindari, 26 imperfect pattidari, and 3 bhayachara. Government land revenue, \u00a319,255; equal to an average of 3s. 6\u00bdd. per cultivated acre, or 1s. 9\u00bdd. per acre of total area. The principal land-holding families are Sayyid Musalmans.\n\n**Sandila.**\u2014Town in Hardoi District, and headquarters of Sandila tahsil and pargana; situated 32 miles north-west of Lucknow, and 34 miles south-east of Hardoi town. Lat. 27\u00b0 4' 15\" N., long. 80\u00b0 33' 20\" E. The sixth largest town in Oudh, and the second largest in Hardoi District; pop. (1869), 15,786, viz. Hindus, 7629, and Muhammadans 8157, residing in 1114 masonry and 3986 mud-built houses. The town contains the usual Subdivisional civil and criminal courts, police station, dispensary, and Anglo-veracular school. No buildings of special interest or antiquity. The bara kambha or hall of twelve pillars, a stone building, was erected about 150 years ago. Markets are held twice a week, at which pan and ghil are sold for export in considerable quantities. Station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand line of railway. During the Sepoy Mutiny, two severe actions were fought at Sandila on the 6th and 7th October 1858.\n\n**Sandoway (Than-dwai).**\u2014A British District in the Arakan Division, British Burma. Area, 3667 square miles; pop. (1872), 54,725 souls. Bounded on the north by the Ma-i river, separating it from Kyok-hpyu District; on the east by the Arakan Mountains; on the south by the Khwa river; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal. Its extreme length is 136 miles; its breadth in the north 48, and in the south 24 miles. The administrative headquarters are at Sandoway Town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Sandoway District is a mountainous country, the Arakan range sending out spurs which reach down to the coast. These\nin their turn give off numerous sub-spurs, running for the most part parallel to the main chain. Not more than one-eighteenth of the area can be called plain; and except in this plain, and on the hillsides, where clearings are made for toungya or nomadic cultivation, the District is covered with dense forest. From the mouth of the Sandoway river northwards, the coast is indented with navigable and intercommunicating tidal creeks, by means of which communication can be kept up without going out to sea. Southwards, it presents a rugged and rocky barrier to the ocean, and has few available harbours. The rivers draining the District are but mountain torrents to within a few miles of the coast. The principal of these are\u2014the Ma-l and the Tan-lwai, falling into the arm of the sea which divides Ramri (Ramree) island from the mainland; the Toung-g\u00fap (Toung-goop), which enters the Bay of Bengal by several mouths, between lat. $18^\\circ 44'$ and $18^\\circ 50'$ N.; the Sandoway, a tidal river, navigable by the largest boats as far as Sandoway town; the Khwa, which falls into the sea in about lat. $17^\\circ 36'$ N., forming a good anchorage for steamers and vessels drawing from 9 to 10 feet of water, though the entrance is rendered difficult by rocks and a sandy bar. The main range of the Arakan Yomas has in the north a direction south-east by south, but it gradually curves towards the west, and, at the source of the Khwa, runs nearly due north and south. In the north, some of the peaks attain an elevation of little less than 5000 feet, which falls to 3200 feet at Shouk-beng, where the Toung-g\u00fap road crosses the range. South of lat. $18^\\circ 21' 26''$ N., the height rapidly diminishes, and at the sources of the Khwa is only about 890 feet. The chief pass is that from Toung-g\u00fap to Pa-doung on the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) in Prome District, a route followed by the main body of the Burmese in their invasion of Arakan in 1784, but found impracticable for troops or laden cattle in 1825-26. Since then, the road has been considerably widened, and rendered fit for the passage of an armed force. It is now mostly used by traders from Pegu, and the telegraph line to Calcutta is carried along it. Another pass connects Khwa with Le-myet-hna in Bassein. The three most important timber-trees found in the District are\u2014pyeng-gado, used in house-building and for railway sleepers; eng and ka-gwyeng, from which are extracted resin and oil respectively. Pyeng-ma, theng-gan, ka-gnyoung, and many other trees abound. The low ground within tidal limits is covered with dense mangrove jungle. Owing to the wild and inaccessible character of the greater portion of Sandoway District, its geological structure has received very cursory examination. The existence of cretaceous rocks was first established in 1872. Mr. Theobald says that they extend down from Kyok-hpy\u00fa District, in lat. $29^\\circ 30'$ N., certainly as far as Kyien-ta-l\u00ed in Sandoway, a distance of 94 miles. Limestone occurs about 4 miles south-south-west of Ma-l, where it is quarried.\nand burnt for local use. The rock is argillaceous, very homogeneous in grain, and occasionally seamed with calcite. Other outcrops, also belonging to the cretaceous age, are found in various parts of the District. Limestone, intermixed with the tertiary clays and sands of the lower lands, is abundant and very pure; yielding on analysis carbonate of lime (with traces of iron), 93.6 per cent.; insoluble clay, 6.4. Veins of steatite and white fibrous quartz also occur in the District.\n\nHistory.\u2014According to the palm-leaf chronicles, there reigned in Baranathi (Benares), at a time when the duration of human life was 90 millions of years, a descendant of the first Buddha of the present epoch, who had sixteen sons; to the eldest of whom, Tha-m\u00fa-ti-de-wa, was allotted the country now forming Sandoway District. For him the spirits or Nats built a city, Dwa-ra-wad-d\u00ed, near the modern Sandoway. Many ages later, Tsek-kya-wad-d\u00ed, the embryo Gautama Buddha, was King of Baranathi; and to his son, Kan-myeng, he gave all the lands inhabited by the Burmese, Shan, and Malay races. Kan-myeng came to Dwa-ra-wad-d\u00ed; dispossessed the descendant of Tha-m\u00fa-ti-de-wa, and was succeeded by kings of his own line, who ruled for a period represented by a unit followed by 140 ciphers. During the reign of Na-rien-da, the last of these monarchs, the country was attacked by the grandsons of a king who ruled in Mo-goung. The legend runs thus:\u2014Arriving at the mouth of the Than-dwai (Sandoway) river, they failed in their attempts to find the city, owing to the devices of its guardian Bh\u00ed-l\u00fa-ma, or, as some say, to its miraculous power of soaring above the earth in times of danger. At length, the guardian, being propitiated, withdrew her protection, and the ten brothers then bound the city to the earth with an iron chain, and divided their conquest into ten shares, making Than-dwai ('iron-bound') their capital. But the eight younger brothers were slain in combat with the people, who appear to have risen against them, and the two elder fled. Henceforth Sandoway appears only as a province of the Arakan kingdom, ravaged alternately by the Burmese and Talangs until the conquest of Arakan by the Burmese in 1784. It was then formed into a governorship, and its wun was one of the commanders of the Burmese army which invaded Bengal at the commencement of the first Anglo-Burmese war. The country was ceded to the British by the treaty of Yandab\u00fa (Yendaboo), in 1826; and on the withdrawal of General Morrison's army, one regiment of Native infantry was left at Sandoway. A few years later, the military headquarters were transferred to Kyouk-hpy\u00fa, and subsequently the small detachment of two companies was also withdrawn.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014On the hills close to Sandoway are three small white-washed pagodas, the An-daw, Nan-daw, and Tshan-daw. The An-daw\nis said to have been erected in 761 A.D. by King Meng-tsek-khy\u00fap, to cover a tooth of Gautama. The building is 242 feet in circumference and 63 feet high. The Nan-daw stands on a hill, and is 480 feet above the level of the plain, and 38 feet high; it is said to have been built in 763 A.D. by Meng-bra, to enshrine a rib of Gautama. The Tshan-daw is assigned to Meng-gnyo-kheng (784 A.D.), and covers a hair of Gautama brought from Ceylon. Three times a year, pilgrims resort to these pagodas, remaining one day at each temple on each occasion. Two stones inscribed in Sanskrit of the 8th century have been found near the Sandoway river. Silver coins struck by ancient kings of Arakan are occasionally met with, some of which have the dates and names in Burmese characters, whilst others bear Persian or N\u00e1gari inscriptions. Celts or stone implements are abundant.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Mountainous and forest-clad, the District seems to have been always sparsely inhabited, but the increase of population since the British occupation has, on the whole, been proportionately larger than in other parts of Arakan. In 1828, the number of inhabitants was 19,538; by 1852, it had risen to 42,886; and in 1872, the Census year, to 54,725, including 19,188 Burmese, 28,339 Arakanese, 2021 Muhammadans, 4731 Khyengs, 24 Shans, 171 Karengs, 86 Hindus, 16 Europeans, and 149 'others.' The number of travellers and sojourners was given at 3413, not included in the returns. The population in 1877 was returned at 56,782, of whom 29,256 were males and 27,526 females. There are no towns in the District with more than 2000 inhabitants, and by far the greater number of villages have fewer than 200; 62 only having from 200 to 400, and 4 from 500 to 1000 inhabitants. These are nearly all situated in the country between the sea-coast and the slopes of the Arakan Yomas. The chief places in the District are\u2014SANDOWAY, the administrative headquarters, situated on the river of the same name, and containing the usual public buildings; pop. (1877), 1617: TOUNG-GUP (Toung-goop), on the Toung-gup river, and headquarters of a township; pop. (1877), 1551: KHWA, a small trading village, with a population of 1029; KYEN-TA-LI, a small village at the mouth of the river of the same name.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Of the total area of the District, viz. 3667 square miles, only 135 square miles are returned as cultivable, and about 72 as under actual cultivation. The chief crops are rice, sesamum, tobacco, cotton, pepper, sugar-cane, dhani palms, and yams. In 1877-78, the area under the various crops was as follows:\u2014Rice, 34,468 acres; oil-seeds, 924; sugar-cane, 264; cotton, 522; vegetables, 629; dhani palms, 1862; other trees, 1428; and tobacco, 1876. Land suited for rice yields on an average 940 lbs. per acre. Sesamum and cotton are grown principally with rice in toungya or hill gardens. The cultivation of tobacco is extending; the best is grown on the alluvial soil deposited\nduring the south-west monsoon by the torrents of the Yoma range in their short course to the sea. The Cuba plant was introduced by Captain (now Sir A. P.) Phayre and Captain (now Lieutenant-General) Fytche, and thrives well; but it is considered by the natives inferior in flavour to their own tobacco, which is said to have been originally brought from China. Madder is produced near the Khwa, and the cultivation is very profitable; it is exported to Bassein. As an almost universal rule, the land in the plains is held by small proprietors directly from the State; the average size of the holdings is 5 acres. Land is not often mortgaged, but very high interest is charged for loans. If a large amount is required, the land is generally made over to the mortgagee for several years for the payment of a lump sum, on which no other interest is charged. Labourers engaged for ploughing receive 2 rupees, or 4s., per acre and their food; and when hired for transplanting or reaping, a bushel of grain per diem. When land is leased out, the rent is almost invariably paid in kind, and averages one-third of the yield. In 1877-78, the average price of cotton per maund of 80 lbs. was 12s.; rice, 3s.; sugar, 19s. 9d.; salt, 2s. 3d.; tobacco, \u00a31, 16s.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The most important manufacture is thatch from the leaves of the N\u00edpa palm, which is in great demand in Akyab and Kyouk-hpy\u00fa, as well as locally. Cotton cloth and silk dresses are woven by the women in almost every house. The silk used is obtained from the southern township, where silk-worms are bred, and from the valley of the Irawadi. There is a large export trade with Akyab, Kyouk-hpy\u00fa, and Bassein in rice, tobacco, sesamum, plantains, salt, salt-fish, nga-pi or fish paste, and boats. The imports consist of piece-goods, cotton twist, betel-nuts, crockery, and hardware. The total length of water communication in Sandoway District is 130 miles; of roads, 13\u00bd miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014During the Burmese rule, the only regular revenue was derived from transit dues and a tax on land. Five baskets (each holding 40 lbs.) of grain in the husk were taken for each pair of buffaloes used, and half a basket was claimed by the keeper of the royal granary as \u2018wastage.\u2019 But there was no fixed rate, and the governors often exacted more. In 1828, it was calculated that every head of a family paid \u00a31, 15s. a year to the Government, whilst the annual cost of living for four persons was only \u00a34, 4s. In 1851, the revenue amounted to \u00a38362; in 1871, to \u00a311,744, including local funds. In 1877-78, the imperial revenue was \u00a314,423; the local revenue, \u00a3580. The incidence of taxation of all kinds was 3s. 0\u00bdd. per head. In Burmese times, the country was administered by a won or governor, under whom were the tsit-ke, myo-uk th\u00fcgyt, and other subordinates. It appears from the records at Sandoway vol. viii.\nthat the *th\u00fagyi* generally levied their demands thus:\u2014(1) From married people, well off, with families, bond servants, cattle, etc., \u00a31, 14s.; married people not so well off, \u00a31, 10s.; married people dependent upon their own labour, or too old for work, and newly married people with means, 18s.; newly married people with little or no substance, 7s.\n\n*Hp\u00fangyi*, the maimed and infirm, Government servants, and bachelors, were exempt from taxation. For some time after the British occupation, the country was in a disturbed state. It has now settled down into a peaceful District, administered by a Deputy Commissioner with extensive judicial powers, and the chief revenue authority under the Commissioner of the Division. Under him are the extra-Assistant Commissioners. The regular police consisted in 1877 of 226 officers and men, or about 1 policeman to every 18 square miles or every 267 inhabitants. There is a jail at Sandoway; the number of prisoners in 1877 was 164. The total cost was \u00a31732, and the work done by prisoners realized \u00a3173. The hospital and civil dispensary are also at the headquarters town, and gave relief in 1876 to 85 in-door and 1873 out-door patients. Little education has, till lately, been given except by the Buddhist monks. The Census of 1872 showed that only 7'45 per cent. of the males under 12 years, 13'33 of those between 12 and 20, and 33'22 per cent. of those above 20 could read or write, while not a single girl or woman acknowledged this small amount of instruction. The Muhammadans were still more backward, as only 7'53 per cent. of the males under 12 and 11'11 per cent. of those over 20 were taught the merest rudiments of learning. In towns the children are better instructed, and in some cases learn both Arabic and Hindust\u00e1ni. A middle-class school was opened in 1876, and had 44 pupils on the rolls at the end of the year.\n\n**Climate.**\u2014From November to February the dews are exceedingly heavy, and the nights very chilly, the terrestrial radiation thermometer often recording only 38\u00b0 F. From February to May, dense fogs rise during the evenings, and the wind blows from the west. Towards the middle of May, storms of thunder and lightning are of frequent occurrence. The total rainfall registered in 1877 was 250'91 inches. The maximum temperature was 90\u00b0 F., and the minimum 74\u00b0 F. The town of Sandoway is considered by some to be the healthiest place in Arakan. The prevalent diseases of the District are agues and fevers.\n\n**Sandoway.**\u2014Chief town and headquarters of Sandoway District; Arakan Division, British Burma; situated in lat. 18\u00b0 27' 35\" N., and long. 94\u00b0 24' 36\" E., on the Sandoway river, about 15 miles from its mouth, but only 4\u00bd miles from the sea in a direct line. The town lies in a basin about 12 miles long by 1 broad, well cultivated with rice, and surrounded by hills, the only outlets being those through which the river flows. The larger portion of the town, which is laid\nout regularly, lies on the left bank of the river; whilst on the right side is a long straggling suburb, buried in trees, and presenting the appearance of an independent village. It contains the court-houses, police station, market, jail, hospital, dispensary, and a circuit-house. Sandoway is a very ancient town, and is often mentioned in Arakanese history as the capital of a kingdom, or more probably a petty chieftainship. Its original name was Dwa-ra-wad-di; but according to a current legend it was called Than-dwai (by which appellation it is now known to the Burmese and Arakanese, Sandoway being an English corruption), from its having been miraculously fastened to the earth by iron chains.\n\nAfter the capture of Arakan town in 1824, a force was sent southwards to attack Ramri (Ramree) and Sandoway. General MacBean reached Sandoway on the 30th of April, and occupied the town without resistance. After the cessation of the war, it remained for some years the headquarters of the troops garrisoning Arakan. The garrison has now been altogether withdrawn. When the British first took this town the number of inhabitants was found to be 4500. In 1877-78, the population was returned at 1617. Sandoway carries on a small coasting trade in rice, vegetables, etc., and an overland traffic in silk and other piece-goods with Prome and Bassein over the Arakan Mountains valued at \u00a32000 per annum. Owing to the numerous creeks intersecting the coast, boats can get as far as Akyab without entering the open sea. In the neighbourhood of Sandoway are the three pagodas of An-daw, Nan-daw, and Tshan-daw, to which pilgrims resort three times a year, spending one day on each occasion at each shrine.\n\n**Sandoway.**\u2014River in Sandoway District, Arakan Division, British Burma. It rises in the Arakan Hills, and, flowing west-north-west, falls into the sea in about lat. 18\u00b0 31' N. About 15 miles up the river is Sandoway town, which can be reached by large boats. The anchorage inside the mouth is from 5 to 6 fathoms; the tide is felt for a short distance above Sandoway town. About 50 miles from the entrance is a sulphuretted hydrogen spring in the bed of the river, the water of which attains a heat of 110\u00b0 F.\n\n**Sandoway Myoma.**\u2014Township in Sandoway District, British Burma, sometimes called the central township. Bounded on the west by the Bay of Bengal. It comprises 14 revenue circles; chief town, Sandoway, on the river of the same name. In 1875, the cultivated area was 14,612 acres; products\u2014rice, tobacco, sesamum, cotton, pepper, sugar-cane, cocoa-nuts, hemp, and miscellaneous garden stuff. Exports, agricultural produce; imports\u2014European cotton and woollen goods, silk goods from Prome and Bassein, and earth-oil and lacquered ware from the latter District. Good communication by boat. The population are mainly engaged in husbandry, fishing, and weaving.\nSandoway Myoma.\u2014Revenue circle in the township of the same name, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 2809; gross revenue, \u00a32588, inclusive of Sandoway town. Products\u2014rice, cotton, tobacco, sugar, and indigo.\n\nSandru.\u2014Pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, across the Himalayan range in Kunawar. Lat. 31\u00b0 24' N., long. 78\u00b0 2' E. (Thornton). Said to be open during only two months of the year. Elevation above sea level, about 16,000 feet.\n\nSandur (Sundoor, Sandhur?).\u2014Native State within the British District of Bellary, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 58' and 15\u00b0 12' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 28' and 76\u00b0 43' E. long. Area, about 140 square miles, of which a large proportion is hill jungle. The State is bounded on the south by the Kudligi taluk, and on all other sides by the Hospet taluk of Bellary District. The tract is elliptical in shape, stretching from north-west to south-east, and is almost entirely shut in by hills, which completely isolate it from the neighbouring country. The population of the State, not including the hill sanatorium of Ramandrug, is, according to the Madras Administration Report for 1877-78, 14,999 souls; the annual revenue from all sources somewhat exceeds \u00a34500.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014One chain of hills on the western limits of the State is known as the Sandur range (q.v.); and from the north, the Timmappa Hills run down to form its eastern boundary. These are crossed by three principal passes. On the east, the Yettinhalli or Bhimagundi ghdt connects the State with Bellary; on the south-west, through the Oblagundi gorge, runs an excellent cart-road for through traffic. The Ramangundi valley between the two main converging ranges is the northern entrance, and has a good road to Hospet. The other principal elevations are the Ramandrug, Kumaraswami and Kombatharavu plateaux. All these attain an elevation of about 3000 feet. The sides of the hills are in most places forest-clad, but indiscriminate felling and charcoal-burning have done much to keep down the more valuable timbers.\n\nSeveral streams water the State. These, for the most part, find outlet in the Sandur river or Nuri Nala through the Yettinhalli gorge, and feed the Daroji tank in Hospet. On the hills, tigers, leopards, pigs, porcupines, bears, sambhar deer, and jungle sheep are found. The prevailing rock is a chloritic slate, often highly impregnated with oxide of iron, and crested in many places with mural ridges of ferruginous quartz rock, tinted with a variety of colours, from a steel-grey to a deep liver-brown. This rock often forms whole hills, always, however, overlying the slate. On the ranges generally, iron-ore is obtained. It is often of a rich quality, easily got at, and usually of a friable description. On Ramandrug, various coloured clays are procurable without difficulty. The prevailing soil in the valley is a rich heavy loam, interspersed here\nand there with patches of black cotton-soil. In various parts, lime is obtained near the surface, chiefly in nodular form. The ascent to the Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi pagoda passes over an extensive bed of lava conglomerate; and the same feature characterises part of the R\u00e1mandrug range.\n\nHistory.\u2014The founder of the Sand\u00far family was Malaj\u00ed R\u00e1o Ghorpare, an officer in the army of the Bij\u00e1pur King, whose son Bir\u00e1j\u00ed entered the service of Sivaj\u00ed the Great. The State had been previously held by a Bedar Polig\u00e1r, but Bir\u00e1j\u00ed's son Sidaj\u00ed took Sand\u00far from the Bedars, and his conquest was confirmed to him and his heirs by Sambhaj\u00ed, the successor of Sivaj\u00ed. Sidaj\u00ed died in 1715, and was succeeded in Sand\u00far by his second son, Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1o, whose fate is involved in obscurity. All that is known is, that Sand\u00far was taken by Haidar Al\u00ed some time after his capture of Gooty (Guti) in 1779; that he began, and Tip\u00fa completed, the fort; and that Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1o's son, Siva R\u00e1o, was killed in battle in 1785, in a vain attempt to recover his patrimony. In 1790, Siva R\u00e1o's brother, Venkat R\u00e1o, acting on behalf of his nephew Sidaj\u00ed, expelled Tip\u00fa's garrison, but did not attempt to occupy Sand\u00far till the fall of Seringapatam. The Peshw\u00e1 then claimed the State as his own, and presented it to Yaswant R\u00e1o Ghorpare, a distinguished officer of Sindhia's army, who belonged to the same family as the former holders. Yaswant R\u00e1o did not enter into possession; and the widow of Sidaj\u00ed, who died in 1796, adopted Siva R\u00e1o, a son of Khandi R\u00e1o, the younger brother of Yaswant R\u00e1o. The Peshw\u00e1 made an unsuccessful attempt upon Sand\u00far in 1815; and at his request in 1817, the British Government, in conformity with the provisions of the treaty of Bassein, sent a force under Sir Thomas Munro to reduce it. In October of that year, the fort and State were surrendered. On Sir Thomas Munro's recommendation, Siva R\u00e1o received as compensation a j\u00e1g\u00edr of \u00a31000. In 1818, however, after the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1's Government, Siva R\u00e1o was restored to his State; and in 1826, he received a sanad from Government confirming the lands of Sand\u00far to him and his heirs free of any pecuniary demands. Siva R\u00e1o was succeeded in 1840 by a nephew named Venkat R\u00e1o, who died in 1861. His eldest son, Siva Shan Mukha R\u00e1o, the present chief, being then a minor, did not receive the sanad till 1863. On the 24th January 1876, Lord Northbrook, then Governor-General, conferred on him the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, as a hereditary distinction to be assumed by his successors on formal recognition of their succession. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 has the entire management of the revenue and police of his State, and the duty of administering civil justice. In the administration of criminal justice, he is required to refer all cases calling for capital punishment for the orders of the Madras Government. The Collector of Bellary acts as Government Agent. The\nchief holds a sanad conferring rights of adoption, granted by the British Government.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Sandur State in 1865 was 12,962. At the Census of 1871 it was returned as 14,994; and the Madras Administration Report for 1877-78 gives the number as 14,999. Of these, 12,800, or nearly 86 per cent., are Hindus; and 2153, or 14 per cent., Muhammadans. Of a male working adult population of 4849, nearly 70 per cent. (3231) are cultivators and labourers. In caste and race, the people are identical with those of the surrounding District of Bellary. On the plateaux, there is a hill tribe of hunters, called Bedars, divided into two clans. They are a healthy and industrious people; and although possessing peculiar customs, they are probably Dravidian-Hindus, and in no way connected with the aboriginal tribes, such as Malayalis, etc.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\u2014The two places of most interest in the State are the important sanatorium of Ramanmalai, situated 3150 feet above the sea, and used chiefly as a convalescent depot for troops; and the temple of Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi, of which Newbold gives the following description:\u2014\n\n'It is situated near the basin of a ravine, not far from the summit of the south-west part of the range of hills that enclose the valley; and after an ascent of 4 miles. The temple is neither large nor magnificent, but has an air of antiquity, of which its whitewashed exterior and gilded cupola cannot entirely divest it. The gopuram faces the east; on the left of the entrance is the shrine of the goddess P\u00e1rvati, consort of Siva; to the west is the image of her son Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi, the presiding genius of the place; and to the right stands the shrine of the destroyer Siva. In front is a square pool called \"Aguste Tirtha.\" In front of the gopuram is a small octangular column of hewn stone, at the foot of which lie three trunkless stone heads. The largest is that of the giant Tarakasam, slain by Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi. The great festival occurs triennially, and at this the number of pilgrims has latterly amounted to 25,000 or 30,000; the temple revenue averages from 15,000 to 20,000 rupees (say \u00a31500 to \u00a32000) annually. A Shasanam in old Kanarese is still preserved, which grants the endowment of the temple. It was given in S. 615 (713 A.D.) by a king of the Marala dynasty, named Bijala N\u00e1yak.' The climate of Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi is described as very agreeable, although, owing to its easterly position, it is not so cool as that of R\u00e1mandrug.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The revenue of the State is about \u00a34500, of which \u00a32400 is derived from land. The land revenue includes grants of land to dependants and service lands; and in all, lands to the annual value of \u00a31250 are alienated. It has been the policy of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 to increase the security of the land tenures, and render them permanent. The rayats may cut wood for all agricultural pur-\nposes free of payment; nor are they liable to be charged for firewood which they themselves carry home. The poorer classes are permitted to cut firewood and grass in the jungles, and to sell it in the b\u0101z\u0101r free of tax.\n\n**Sandur** *(Sundoor, Sandhur?).*\u2014Hills in Bellary District, Madras. A range of hills about 15 miles long, running from south-east to north-west, ending abruptly near Hospet. This range forms the greater part of the western boundary of the native State of Sandur, dividing it from the Hospet t\u0101luk. R\u0101mandrug, 3150 feet above the sea, is the principal hill, and was selected as far back as 1846 for the sanatorium of Ramanamalai. The range consists of gneiss much weathered. The upper part of R\u0101mandrug is clay ironstone, and the slopes consist of a variety of schistose rocks containing manganese and antimony. Tigers are found in these hills, and much useful wood comes from them.\n\n**Sandwip** *(Sundeep).*\u2014Island in the Bay of Bengal; situated off the coast of Chittagong and Noakhali, and part of the latter District, though under the civil jurisdiction of the Judge of Chittagong. Lat. $22^\\circ 24'$ to $22^\\circ 37'$ N.; long. $91^\\circ 22'$ to $91^\\circ 35'$ E. The largest of many chars formed by the Meghna as it enters the sea. For long, a process of diluvion went on in the south of Sandwip, but the soil re-formed and reappeared in 1865 as the K\u0101l\u012b char, many miles long, lying parallel with the south face of the island, at a distance of about 2 or 3 miles. This char already acts as a bar to protect Sandwip from further diluvion, and will eventually, in all probability, become attached to it by the silting up of the intermediate channel. Sandwip early attracted the notice of travellers. C\u00e6sar Frederick, the Venetian traveller, in 1565 described the inhabitants of Sandwip as 'Moors;' and stated that the island was one of the most fertile places in the country, densely populated, and well cultivated. He mentions the extraordinary cheapness of provisions here; and adds that 200 ships were laden yearly with salt, and that such was the abundance of materials for shipbuilding in this country, that the Sultan of Constantinople found it cheaper to have his vessels built here than at Alexandria. Purchas *(circa* 1620) states that most of the inhabitants near the shore were Muhammadans; and there are several mosques on Sandwip Island two hundred years old. Sir Thomas Herbert *(circa* 1625) bears testimony to the fertility of the island, which he describes as one of the fairest and most fruitful spots in all India. The cocoa-nut palm flourishes in Sandwip, and the nuts are exported to Chittagong and Akyab. Sugar-cane is also cultivated to a great extent.\n\nThe island of Sandwip figured conspicuously in the contests of the 17th century between the Arakanese, Muhammadans, and Portuguese *(see Chittagong District)*, and during that period numerous forts were erected. In one of these, the Muhammadan troops took refuge in\nMarch 1609, when the Portuguese landed on the island. But the fort was besieged and captured, and the defenders put to the sword. In 1616, Sandwip was taken from the Portuguese by the Arakanese. In 1665, Sh\u00e1ist\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the Muhammadan Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, determined to reconquer the island. An interesting account of his expedition, by the French traveller Bernier, was translated in the Calcutta Review for 1871, and is quoted in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. vi. pp. 243-246.\n\nUntil 1822, the island formed part of Chittagong, but in that year it was made over to the newly formed District of No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed. It had, from the time when it came under British administration (1760), formed a constant source of disquiet. It afforded an asylum for the refuse of the river Districts from Dacca southwards, and had a mixed population of Hindus, Muhammadans, and Maghs, who formed on the island agricultural colonies, fishing settlements, piratical villages, and robber communities. The subordinate tenants kept up a bitter quarrel with the landholder-in-chief, and every class seemed to have a grudge against the rest, and some complaint to make to Government. But the firm administration of the British officials gradually produced its effect. A Commissioner was appointed to measure and partition the island. His appearance, however, was at first only the signal for new disorders. On the one hand, he complained of 'obstructions and difficulties' thrown in the way of executing his duty; on the other hand, the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs forwarded a bitter petition and lament. An enterprising native gentleman proposed, in May 1785, to relieve the officials of further difficulty by taking Sandwip in farm. But the Government was resolved to have the work thoroughly done, and rejected his offer. Accordingly, the troublesome island was placed under the direct management of the Collector, who was ordered to conduct a land settlement. The administration of justice in Sandwip was formerly under the authority of an officer called a faujd\u00e1r, resident in the island. But from a report (dated September 1779) by Mr. Duncan, specially deputed to Sandwip, it appears that when Government ceased to maintain a fortress on the island, the faujd\u00e1r was no longer retained, and justice was administered by an inferior officer with the title of d\u00e1rog\u00e1. This official had not, however, uncontrolled jurisdiction. From the year 1760, if not from an earlier date, he was entirely under the authority of the nd\u00edb ahad-d\u00e1r. It was the duty of the d\u00e1rog\u00e1 and his assistants to prepare cases for hearing; and on fixed days in each week the nd\u00edb ahad-d\u00e1r would sit in his court of justice, attended by the d\u00e1rog\u00e1s, k\u00e1n\u00fangos, and sam\u00ednnd\u00e1rs, to dispose of all cases brought before him. 'This court,' writes Mr. Duncan, 'took cognizance of all matters, civil and criminal\u2014its jurisdiction being only restrained as\nto matters of revenue, the cognizance of which rested with the ahad-dar in his separate capacity. In matters of debt, the court retained the fourth part of the sum in litigation, and enacted discretionary fines for theft, gang-robbery (d\u0101k\u0101t\u012b), fornication, assaults, and the like.'\n\nAmong the miscellaneous inquiries conducted by Mr. Duncan in 1779, was one relating to complaints of slaves, or persons reported to be slaves, against their masters. 'This unfortunate race of mankind,' says Mr. Duncan, 'bears in Sandwip a larger proportion to the other inhabitants than perhaps in any other District in the Province; there is hardly a householder, however indigent, who has not at least one slave, and the majority have many in their families. Their number also very soon increases by marriage, in which they are encouraged by their masters, the custom of the country being such that a free woman, on marrying a male slave, reduces herself and her family to be the perpetual slaves of her husband's master, who continues ever after to retain them in the same bondage.' One man alone was said to possess more than 1500 slaves. The principal cause assigned by Mr. Duncan for the great extent to which slavery prevailed in Sandwip, was 'the extreme cheapness and abundance of grain in the island, so that as often as there is any scarcity in Dacca District, it attracts people to Sandwip, where it has been common for many of them to sell themselves and their posterity for maintenance.' Although Mr. Duncan in 1779 set only 15 slaves and their families at liberty, yet none of his proceedings created more general apprehension than his taking cognizance of this particular grievance, because all the principal people were immediately interested.\n\nFrom its low-lying position, Sandwip is peculiarly exposed to inundation from storm waves, and suffered severely in loss of life and property by the cyclones of 1864 and 1876. The calamity of the latter year was the severest on record. The following account of the inundation is quoted from a report by Mr. Pellew, the Magistrate of No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed:\u2014'The people in the villages on the south-western coast stated that the inundation commenced with a wave at least 6 feet high, which burst over the land from the south-east. Very shortly afterwards, another wave, 6 feet higher, came from the south-west. These waves came suddenly, just like the bore, mounting up and curling over. The second wave is described as lifting the roofs of the houses, and whirling the contents\u2014human beings, furniture, etc.\u2014violently outside. The mat walls, with their wooden posts, were swept away, the latter being either broken off short or wrested out of the ground. All this was done suddenly; people described it as occurring in one second of time. Behind each wave the water did not fall again, but remained, so that after the second wave there was 12 feet of water over the land.\nIn the centre of the island the water came up less suddenly. The Government Pleader at Harishpur was taking refuge from the storm in his new office. Suddenly an alarm was raised that the water was coming. He got on the wooden dais, but the water immediately covered this. He then went up to his neck in water, along a raised path, to the bank of his tank, which is about 12 feet high. He told me that the rising of the water did not take longer than two minutes from first to last, and that he was only just in time. The bank of the tank was not more than 10 yards from his office.\n\nIn many villages whole families were swept away, and in some of the chars the entire population was destroyed. 'In the village of Ney\u00e1mast\u00ed,' writes Mr. Pellew, 'one man was the sole survivor of thirteen; four men were the survivors of a household of twenty-five. The women have perished in immense numbers. Most of the men who remain are wifeless. In Kang\u00e1l\u00ed Char, the Sub-Inspector of Police found nothing but two wild buffaloes alive, and the corpses of men, cows, and buffaloes. In Char Maulavi, out of 177 people, 137 died.'\n\nFor the first few days after this cyclone of 1876, there were several attempts at plundering, and demoralization prevailed among the low Muhammadan population. Men, in gangs and singly, armed with cudgels, bills, and hatchets, were, the Magistrate reported, wandering about the inundated tracts, and breaking open and looting all they could lay their hands upon, whether under the care of owners or not. This lawlessness was, however, rapidly suppressed; and the people soon returned to the sites of their former houses, and busied themselves in drying their grain and in saving what they could of their property. 'Throughout the devastated tracts, 'the demeanour of those who really bore the brunt of the storm was,' Sir Richard Temple states, 'marked by that enduring fortitude under suffering which distinguishes the native character.'\n\nThe number of deaths was officially estimated at 40,000, out of a total population of 87,016. Cholera set in soon after the cyclone had passed over. Although a large medical staff was immediately despatched to the District, the epidemic continued to rage to such an extent, that when Mr. Pellew visited the Sandwip islands, the mortality from the plague threatened in some places to exceed that from the storm itself. The returns for thirty-three police-beats in South Sandwip, with a population of 10,855 souls, gave the deaths by drowning as 1063, whereas those from cholera in the same tract had by December 1876 amounted to 764. The pollution of the tanks and water-courses, both by the salt-water inundation and by the corpses of men and the carcases of cattle, added to the other evils resulting from the cyclone; while the stench from the dead tainting the air throughout the inun-\ndated tract aggravated the plague of cholera. Nearly all the scavenger animals\u2014jackals, dogs, and even vultures\u2014perished by the storm and the wave; and for weeks after the inundation the land was covered with the dead bodies of men and cattle, preserved by the salt-water from rapid decomposition.\n\nS\u00e1ngala.\u2014Ruins in Jhang District, Punjab; standing on a small rocky hill, upon the border of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District; now known as S\u00e1nglaw\u00e1la Tiba, and identified by General Cunningham with the S\u00e1kala of the Br\u00e1hmans, the S\u00e1gal of Buddhism, and the S\u00e1ngala of Alexander's historians. The hill rises to a height of 215 feet above the surrounding plain on its north side, and slopes southward till it ends in an abrupt bank only 32 feet in height, crowned in early times by a brick wall, traces of which still exist. The whole intervening area is strewn with large antique bricks, great quantities of which have been removed during the last fifteen years. An extensive swamp covers the approach on the south and east, the least defensible quarters, with a general depth of 3 feet in the rains, but dry during the summer. This must have been a large lake in the days of Alexander, which has since silted up by washings from the hill above. On the north-east side of the hill, General Cunningham found the remains of two considerable buildings, with bricks of enormous size. Close by, stands an old well, lately cleared out by wandering tribes. On the north-west side, about 1000 feet distant, rises a low ridge of rock, known as Munda-ka-pura, 30 feet in height, also covered by brick remains. The earliest notice of the locality occurs in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, where S\u00e1kala figures as the capital of the M\u00e1dr\u00e1s, situated upon the Ap\u00e1ga rivulet, west of the Ir\u00e1vati or R\u00e1vi, and approached from the east by pleasant paths through the Pilu forest. The neighbourhood bears the name of M\u00e1dr-des to the present day. In Buddhist legends, the city reappears as S\u00e1gal, whither seven kings made their way to carry off Prabh\u00e1vati, the wife of King Kusa. That monarch, however, met them outside the gates, mounted upon an elephant, and shouted with so loud a voice that his words were heard over the whole world, and the seven kings fled away in terror. Arrian, Curtius, and Diodorus all notice S\u00e1ngala, 'a great city, defended not only by a wall, but by a swamp,' which was deep enough to drown several of the inhabitants who attempted to swim across. Alexander seems to have turned out of his direct line of march to punish the Katheceans of S\u00e1ngala, who had withheld their allegiance. He stormed the outpost of Munda-ka-pura, crowded with fugitives from other cities, and then, breaching the walls by means of a mine, captured the town by assault. Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, who visited S\u00e1kala in 630 A.D., found the fortifications in ruins, but traced their foundations for a circuit of 3\u00bd miles. In the midst of the\nremains, a small portion of the ancient city, 1 mile in circuit, was still inhabited, and contained a Buddhist monastery and two stupas, one of them founded by the famous Emperor Asoka. The accurate details of the Chinese traveller have been principally instrumental in settling the identity of S\u00e1nglaw\u00e1la Tiba with the historical site.\n\n**Sangamner.** \u2014 Chief town of the Sangamner Subdivision of Ahmednagar District, Bombay; situated 49 miles north-west of Ahmednagar city, in lat. $19^\\circ 34' 36''$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 16' 10''$ E.

Sub-judge's court, post office, and dispensary.\n\n**Sangarh.** \u2014 Northern tahsil of Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab; consisting of a narrow strip of land between the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Mountains and the Indus. Area, 668 square miles; pop. (1868), 39,246; persons per square mile, 58; number of villages, 76; area under cultivation, 107,900 acres.\n\n**S\u00e1ngarhi.** \u2014 Town in Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $20^\\circ 58' N.$, long. $80^\\circ E.$, 24 miles south-east of Bhand\u00e1ra town, and 3 miles south of the Seoni Lake (vide Seoniband). Pop. (1866), 4367. Local industries\u2014the manufacture of cotton cloth, which is largely exported, and silk-spinning. S\u00e1ngarhi derives its name from the ruined Afgh\u00e1n fort which commands it. The town stands on a gravelly soil, but is unhealthy, owing to the brackishness of the water supply from most of the wells. Police post, and flourishing Government school.\n\n**Sanghi.** \u2014 Agricultural village in Rohtak District, Punjab. Lat. $29^\\circ 1' N.$, long. $76^\\circ 37' E.$; pop. (1868), 5117, consisting of 4541 Hindus, 570 Muhammadans, and 6 Sikhs.\n\n**S\u00e1ngli.** \u2014 Native State in the Political Agency of the Southern Marhatt\u00e1 Country, Bombay; consisting of six separate divisions\u2014a group of villages near the valley of the Kistna; a second group between the Kolh\u00e1pur territory on the west and J\u00e1mkh\u00e1ndi State; a third group in Shol\u00e1pur District, near the junction of the M\u00e1n and Bh\u00edma rivers; a fourth in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District; a fifth just north of the town of Belg\u00e1um; and the last to the south of the river Malprabha and to the north-east of Kitt\u00far in Belg\u00e1um. The State contains a total area of 896 square miles, and a population (1872) of 223,663 persons. The portion watered by the Kistna is flat, and the soil particularly rich. The remaining divisions of the State are plains surrounded by undulating lands, and occasionally intersected by ridges of hills. The prevailing soil is black. Irrigation is carried on from rivers, wells, and tanks. The climate is the same as that of the Deccan generally, the air being very dry, especially when east winds prevail. The most common diseases are cholera, smallpox, and fever. The chief products of the State are millet, rice, wheat, gram, and cotton; and the principal manufactures are coarse\ncotton cloth, and native articles of apparel. The chief of S\u00e1ngli is a member of the Patwardhan family, whose founder Haribhat, a Konkan Br\u00e1hman, rose to military command under the first Peshw\u00e1, and received grants of land on condition of military service. In 1772, Miraj descended to Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o, grandson of Govind R\u00e1o Hari, the original grantee. Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o being a child of six years, the State was managed during his minority by his uncle Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1o. When the minor came of age, he quarrelled with his uncle, who attempted to keep him out of his rights. Eventually the estate was divided between them, the uncle retaining Miraj, and Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o taking S\u00e1ngli. The revenue of S\u00e1ngli was \u00a363,518, and of Miraj, \u00a347,980; the estates being respectively subject to a service of 1920 and 1219 horse. Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o, the father of the present chief of S\u00e1ngli, became a feudatory of the British Government on the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1 in 1818-19. In 1846, the East India Company presented him with a sword in testimony of their respect for his high character, and in acknowledgment of his fidelity and attachment to the British Government. Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o died in 1851. The chief of S\u00e1ngli does not now pay any contribution on account of military service, having given up lands of the annual value of \u00a313,500 in lieu thereof. The family hold a title authorizing adoption. The present chief is Dhundi R\u00e1o Chint\u00e1man, a Hindu of the Br\u00e1hman caste. He ranks as a 'first-class' Sard\u00e1r in the Southern Marhatt\u00e1 Country, and has power to try for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent. This power, however, applies to his own subjects only. He enjoys an estimated net revenue of \u00a377,295, and maintains a military force of 822 men. There are in the State 42 schools, with a total of 1762 pupils. In consequence of abuses in administration, a British officer has recently been appointed to exercise direct control.\n\nS\u00e1ngli.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1ngli State, Bombay; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 51' 35\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 36' 20\" E., on the river Kistna, a little north of the confluence of the W\u00e1rna, and north-east of Kolhapur. Pop. (1872), 12,961.\n\nS\u00e1ngola.\u2014Chief town of the S\u00e1ngola Subdivision of Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay; situated 19 miles south-west of Pandharpur, in lat. 17\u00b0 26' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 14' 15\" E. Pop. (1872), 5111. S\u00e1ngola is a municipality, with an annual revenue of \u00a3115. Sub-judge's court and post office.\n\nSangr\u00e1mpur.\u2014Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 28' 38\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 44' E., on the river Gandak. Pop. (1872), 6181.\n\nSangri.\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States. Area, 16 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 700. It is situated south of the river Sutlej (Satlaj), and formerly belonged to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kullu, whose main\npossessions lay north of that river. Sangri was seized by the G\u00farkhas, but they were expelled by the British in 1815, and the estate was restored to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kullu. The Kullu territories north of the Sutlej were, however, conquered by the S\u00edkhs, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 took refuge in Sangri, where he died childless in 1841. On the country falling under British power after the first S\u00edkh war, his nephew was recognised, in 1847, as chief of Sangri. The present (1876) Mi\u00e1h of Sangri is Hira Sinh, a R\u00e1jput. He enjoys a supposed gross revenue of \u00a3100. The chief products of the State are opium and grain.\n\nSangu.\u2014Subdivision of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal, formed in March 1867. It comprises the tract of country between the rivers Sangu and M\u00e1t\u00e1muri. Owing to the manner in which the Census of 1872 was taken in this backward District, no separate details of population, etc. are available.\n\nSangu.\u2014River of Chittagong, Bengal; rises in the range of hills dividing Arakan from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, near the hill of Kud\u00e1ng. After a circuitous course of about 125 miles, generally northerly, over a rocky bed, it reaches Band\u00e1rban, from which town it takes a tortuous westerly direction through Chittagong District, and finally empties itself into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. 22\u00b0 6' N., and long. 91\u00b0 53' E., about 10 miles south of the Karnaphuli. The Sangu is tidal as far as Band\u00e1rban; its bed here is sandy. Though shallow in ordinary times, during the rains this river becomes deep, dangerous, and rapid. In its upper reaches, the Sangu is called by the hillmen the Rigray Khyoung; midway, before entering the plains, it is known as the Sab\u00e1k Khyoung. It is navigable by large cargo boats for a distance of 30 miles throughout the year. The principal tributary is the Dolu.\n\nSanivarsante.\u2014K\u00e1sb\u00e1 or administrative headquarters of Yelusa-virashime t\u00e9luk, in the territory of Coorg. The name of the village is derived from a weekly fair held on Saturday.\n\nSanj\u00e1n.\u2014Small village in Th\u00e1n\u00e1 (Tanna) District, Bombay; believed to have been formerly a large town, and the place where the P\u00e1rsis first landed in India. Known to the Portuguese, and long after their time, as \u2018St. John.\u2019\n\nSanjeli.\u2014One of the petty States of Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Bombay. Area, 33\u00bd square miles; estimated revenue in 1875, \u00a3510. No tribute is paid. The chief is named Th\u00e1kur Part\u00e1b Sinhji.\n\nSankaridrug (Sanka-giri Durgam).\u2014Village in Salem District, Madras. Lat. 11\u00b0 28' 52\" N., long. 77\u00b0 55' 40\" E.; pop. (1871), 1711, dwelling in 374 houses. Sub-magistrate\u2019s court, railway station, and telegraph office. The village is situated at the foot of the Durgam or Drug, a square mass of gneiss rising 1000 feet above the plain, completely terraced with fortifications, while half-way up, like a pearl set\nin emeralds, a white mosque nestles amongst the rich foliage which still covers part of the hill. On the summit is a small plateau, with a good supply of water stored in the rock. Viewed from below, the hill is a source of interest to the geologist, from the very fine specimens of granite veins piercing the gneiss, which have been exposed in the course of ages.\n\nThe Drug was a place of great strength, and was not attempted by Colonel Wood in 1768, when he captured all the surrounding forts. The fortifications on the summit show traces of European engineering.\n\n**Sankarkati.**\u2014Village in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal. Noted for its large and numerously attended fair held during the Durg\u00e1-p\u00faj\u00e1, Dol, and Rath J\u00e1tr\u00e1 festivals.

Pop. (1871), 11,632, dwelling in 2793 houses. A large, well-built town, with fine temple and tanks; and the headquarters of a taluk of the same name.\n\n**Sankarpur.**\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 38' N., and long. 79\u00b0 34' E., 16 miles north-north-east of Chim\u00e1r. Contains a modern fort of earth and brick, and has Government schools for boys and girls. Under the Marhatt\u00e1s, a cannon foundry was worked at Sankarpur, and some half-finished guns yet remain...\n\n**Sankeswar.**\u2014Town in Belgaum District, Bombay; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 15' N., and long. 74\u00b0 31' 30\" E., 27 miles north by west of Belgaum town. Pop. (1872), 8905. Post office.\n\n**Sankh.**\u2014River of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; rises in the west of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, and after a tortuous course of 120 miles, first south-westerly and then south-easterly, joins the South Koel in Gangpur State. The united stream, under the name of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, enters the sea in the north of Orissa. The confluence of the South Koel and the Sankh is the most picturesque spot in Gangpur. Local tradition asserts it to be the scene of the amour of the Sage Par\u00e1suram with the fisherman's daughter Matsya Gandh\u00e1, the offspring of which was Vy\u00e1sa, the reputed compiler of the Veda and the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata.\n\n**Sankhatra.**\u2014Municipal town in Si\u00e1lkot (Sealkote) District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 13' N., long. 74\u00b0 58' E.; pop. (1876-77), 2391; municipal revenue (1876-77), \u00a375; incidence of taxation, 7\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Sankhund.**\u2014Spring in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; so called from the monster sankh or shell Panchajanya, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, the sound of which filled the breasts of the enemy with dismay. This shell is said to have rested beneath the waters of the spring, and its impression on the bank\u2014three feet in length by a foot and a half wide\u2014is still shown.\n\n**Sankisa.**\u2014Village and ruins in Etah District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces; identified by General Cunningham with the great city of the same name, which formed the capital of a considerable kingdom in the 5th century B.C. Distant from Etah town 43 miles south-east. Visited by Fa-Hian, about 415 A.D., and by Hiouen Thsang in 636 A.D., when it was a celebrated place of Buddhist pilgrimage, being the spot where Buddha descended again upon earth by three staircases of gold, silver, and crystal, after a residence of three months in the Triyastrinshas' heaven, preaching the law to his mother, M\u00e1ya. King Asoka afterwards erected a pillar to commemorate the event, but no remains of it can now with certainty be discovered. The existing village is perched upon a mound of ruins, known as the kil\u00e1 or fort, 41 feet in height, with a superficial extent of 1500 feet by 1000. A quarter of a mile southward is another mound, composed of solid brick-work, and surmounted by a temple to Bis\u00e1ri Devi. North of the temple mound, at a distance of 400 feet, lies the capital of an ancient pillar, bearing an erect figure of an elephant, wanting the trunk and tail. The capital has the well-known bell-shape, reeded perpendicularly with a honeysuckle abacus, as in the pillar at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; and it evidently belongs to the same period, the 3d century B.C. Hence General Cunningham considers it identical with Asoka's monument, mentioned by the Chinese Pilgrims, although the latter was said to be crowned by the figure of a lion\u2014a discrepancy which the learned archaeologist explains away by supposing that the trunk was already broken off in the 5th century A.D., and that the animal could no longer be distinguished at a height of 50 feet above the ground. South of the temple of Bis\u00e1ri Devi, again, at a distance of 200 feet, occurs a third small mound of ruins, apparently the remains of a stupa; while 600 feet due east is a fourth mound, 600 feet by 500, known as Nivi-kakot, which seems to contain the remains of some large enclosed building like a Buddhist monastery. The fort and the various mounds which surround the temple form a mass of ruins 3000 feet in length by 2000 in breadth, or nearly 2 miles in circuit; but this space appears only to enclose the citadel and the religious edifices which gathered round the three holy staircases by which Buddha descended upon the earth. The city itself, which surrounded the central holy enclosure, was girt by an earthen rampart upwards of 3\u00bd miles in circumference, and still distinctly traceable in the shape of an irregular dodecagon. Three openings which occur in the rampart are traditionally pointed out as the gates of the ancient city. South-east of the Sankisa ruins lies the tank of the N\u00e1ga, known as Karewar, and identified with a 'dragon tank' described by Fa-Hian. The city was probably destroyed during the wars between Prithwi R\u00e1j of Delhi and J\u00e1i Chand of Kanauj. Other interesting ruins occur in the neighbouring village of Sarai-Aghat, \u00be mile distant north-west.\nSankos (or Suvarnakos; so called from its golden sands).\u2014River of North-Eastern Bengal, flowing through that low tract of country between the Him\u00e1layas and the Brahmaputra, where no river preserves its identity amid the frequent fluvial changes that take place year by year. It can only be affirmed that the name is given, in different parts of its course, to a river that flows southward from the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, and ultimately joins the Brahmaputra, in lat. 25\u00b0 52' N., and long. 89\u00b0 52' E. The main channel of this river forms the boundary between the Eastern and Western Dw\u00e1rs, thus separating Bengal from Assam. Its chief tributaries are the K\u00e1lj\u00e1n\u00ed and R\u00e1idhak on the right bank, and the Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r on the left. The name of the Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r is commonly applied to the united stream.\n\nSann.\u2014Town in the M\u00e1njh\u00e1nd t\u00e1luk of Sehw\u00e1n Deputy Collectorate, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 N., and long. 68\u00b0 8' E., close to the western bank of the Indus, at the mouth of a torrent that issues from the Laki Hills; on the main road from Kotri to Sehw\u00e1n, being 11 miles north of M\u00e1njh\u00e1nd, and 11 south of Amri. To the south-west of Sann is the vast but ruined fort of R\u00e1n\u00ed-ka-kot, said to have been constructed by two of the T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs early in the present century, at a cost of 12 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a3120,000). Originally the river flowed near the walls, but when its course changed, the fort was abandoned. Sann is the headquarters of a tappad\u00e1r; it also contains a post office, school, dharms\u00e1l\u00e1, and a small police post. Pop. (1872), 1798, viz. 1362 Muhammadans and 436 Hindus.\n\nSansara.\u2014One of the petty States of North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 3 villages, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3403, of which \u00a318 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a35 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\nSansar Dh\u00e1ra.\u2014Grotto and place of pilgrimage in Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 30\u00b0 21' N., long. 78\u00b0 6' E. A waterfall gushes from a cleft in the rock, with a grotto behind it, in which stalactites are formed. The Hindus consider it sacred to Mah\u00e1deva, and visit it in considerable numbers. Distant from Mussooree (Mas\u00far\u00ed) about 12 miles.\n\nSant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, The.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 48' and 25\u00b0 19' N. lat., and between 86\u00b0 30' and 87\u00b0 58' E. long. Area, 5488 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1872, 1,259,287 souls. The Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s form the southern portion of the Bh\u00e1galpur Division. They are bounded on the north by the Districts of Bh\u00e1galpur and Purniah; on the east by Maldah, Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, and B\u00edrbh\u00fam; on the south by Bardw\u00e1n and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam; and on the west by Haz\u00e1ribagh and Bh\u00e1galpur. The administrative headquarters are at Naya Dumk\u00e1.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Three distinct types of country are represented\nin the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. In the east of the District a belt of hills stretches for about a hundred miles from the Ganges to the Naubil river. West of this is a rolling tract of long ridges with intervening depressions, covering an area of about 2500 square miles. The third type is exemplified by a narrow, almost continuous, strip of flat alluvial land about 170 miles in length, lying for the most part along the loop-line of the East Indian Railway. The total area of this alluvial tract is about 650 square miles. The undulating upland tract, which includes the entire Sub-District of Deoghar, with Pabbi\u00e1 and the southern portion of Godd\u00e1, is in many parts overgrown with jungle; and the gneiss, which forms the geological basis of the District generally, is here overlaid by the carboniferous shales and sandstones that form the Deoghar coal-field. The Rajmahal Hills, which abruptly rise from the valley of the Ganges, were, until very recently, regarded as a continuation of the Vindhya range of Central India. It has been found, however, that not only are they physically quite detached from the Vindhya hill system, but geologically there is nothing in common between the two. The Rajmahal Hills occupy an area of 1366 square miles; they nowhere rise higher than 2000 feet above the sea, their average elevation being considerably less. The principal peaks are Mor\u00ed and Sendgarsa, each about 2000 feet above the sea. The other hill ranges of the District are the Mahuasarhi, R\u00e1mgarh, Belp\u00e1ta, Kumr\u00e1b\u00e1d, Lakshanpur, Salch\u00e1la, and Sankara. Singanm\u00e1t, a peak in the last-named range, is well known as a landmark for all the country round. Most of these hills are covered almost to their summits with dense jungle, and are difficult of access. There are, however, numerous passes through the successive ranges, along which good roads might without difficulty be made. The Ganges forms the northern and a large part of the eastern boundary of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, and all the rivers of the District eventually flow either into it or into the Bh\u00e1girathi. The chief of these rivers are the Gum\u00e1n\u00ed, the Moral, the B\u00e1nsloi, the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, the Mor or Mor\u00e1kh\u00ed with its tributary the Naubil, the Ajai, and the Bar\u00e1khar. None of them is navigable throughout the year. Picturesque waterfalls are formed near the villages of Kuskir\u00e1, Sinhpur, and Mahar\u00e1jpur, and there are several mineral springs in the District. Game, large and small, is common throughout the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s.\n\nHistory.\u2014The administrative history of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s is the history of the gradual withdrawal of the territory now comprised in the District from the operation of the general regulations, that withdrawal being throughout dictated by a regard for the peculiar national character of the two races of Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s and Sant\u00e1ls. The policy was in the first instance set on foot by Mr. Augustus Cleveland, Collector of Bh\u00e1galpur, in the rules which he proposed for the management of the\nPah\u00e1ri\u00e1s between 1780 and 1784. These rules, which are referred to in the article on Bhagalpur District, were incorporated in Regulation I of 1796, so that Cleveland has a fair claim to be considered the author of the non-regulation system. It followed, however, from confirming the Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s in possession of the hills, that disputes arose between them and the Hindu samind\u00e1rs of the plains as to the right of grazing cattle and cutting timber along the lower slopes. Accordingly, in 1832, two Government officials were deputed to demarcate with solid masonry pillars the present area of the D\u00e1man-i-koh or 'skirts of the hills.' The permission to Sant\u00e1ls to settle in the valleys and on the lower slopes of the D\u00e1man stimulated Sant\u00e1l immigration to an enormous extent; and it might be supposed that the natural consequence of that immigration would have been the admission of the Sant\u00e1ls to the exceptional privileges which the Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s already enjoyed. But this measure, although more than once proposed, was not approved by Government; and the next phase in the history of the District is the Sant\u00e1l rebellion of 1855-56. The story of that rebellion, and the causes which led to it, would occupy more space than can here be given, but the reader will find an exhaustive account of it in my Annals of Rural Bengal, and a shorter sketch under article India (ante, Vol. iv.). The Sant\u00e1ls, starting with the desire to revenge themselves on the Hindu money-lenders who had taken advantage of their simplicity and improvidence, found themselves arrayed in arms against the British Government. The insurrection was not repressed without bloodshed, but it led to the establishment of a form of administration congenial to the Sant\u00e1l immigrants; and a land settlement has recently been carried out on conditions favourable to the occupants of the soil.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No estimate of the population of the entire District exists previous to the Census of 1872. That enumeration disclosed a total of 1,259,287 persons, inhabiting 9872 villages and 230,504 houses; average density of the population, 229 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 1.8; houses per square mile, 42; persons per village, 128; persons per house, 5.4. The most thickly peopled portion of the District is the samind\u00e1ri tract, where the average density is 241 persons to the square mile, varying from 160 to 392. Taking the D\u00e1man-i-koh as a whole, there is a general average of 193 persons to the square mile, the greatest density recorded being 212 in that portion of the D\u00e1man attached to Godd\u00e1, and the least being 161 in the D\u00e1man of Nay\u00e1 Dumk\u00e1. Classified according to sex, the number of males is 629,716, and of females, 629,571, the proportion of males being thus exactly 50 per cent. of the whole population. Classified according to age, there are, under 12 years\u2014males, 269,751, and females, 242,836; total children, 512,587, or 40.7 per cent. of the population: above 12 years old\u2014males, 359,965,\nand females, 386,735; total adults, 746,700. The excess of male over female children is explained by the fact that here, as elsewhere in India, the natives consider that a girl reaches womanhood at an earlier age than a boy arrives at manhood, and many girls are consequently returned as women. The abnormally large proportion of children\u201440.7 per cent. of the District population\u2014is probably due to the fact that the aboriginal races are unusually prolific. The ethnical division of the population gives the following results:\u2014Non-Asiatics, 120 (of whom 106 were British); mixed races (Eurasians), 92; and Asiatics, 1,259,075. Of the natives of India, 390,612 are returned as Hindus, besides 7076 persons of Hindu origin not recognising caste; and 79,786 as Muhammadans. Of the Hindus, 76,848 belong to the superior castes (Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Gh\u00e1t\u00e1ws). The Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, cowherds and milkmen (of whom there are 74,529), form by far the most numerous caste in the District; the artisan castes number altogether 83,722 persons, of whom 27,954 are Tel\u00eds (oilmen). The total number of persons belonging to aboriginal tribes is 557,277, of whom the great majority (455,513) consist of Sant\u00e1ls. The Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s number 68,336. The other principal aboriginal tribes represented in the District are Naiy\u00e1s (9179), Kols (8894), and Mals (8820). The total number of Sant\u00e1ls throughout the whole of the Bengal Provinces is returned in the Census Report of 1872 at 923,532, of whom just one-half are found in the District of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. M\u00e1nbh\u00fam comes next with 132,445; Midnapur has 96,921; the Native States of Orissa, 76,548; Singbh\u00fam, 51,132; Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh, 35,306. The Sant\u00e1ls form 3 per cent., or more than one-third of the total number of the aboriginal races under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and they are certainly the best known to Europeans. The history of this interesting tribe, so far as it is ascertained, together with a description of their physical appearance, habits, and mode of life, will be found in Colonel Dalton's Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal. The same work also contains an account of the Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s, their customs, language, etc. Divided according to religion, the population of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s is made up in almost equal proportions of Hindus, who number 650,210, or 51.6 per cent., and hill people professing aboriginal faiths, who form 42 per cent. The remainder consists of Muhammadans (79,786, or 6.4 per cent.), and a very small sprinkling (392, or 0.03 per cent.) of Christians. Nearly all the converts to Christianity are obtained from the aboriginal races, who are engaged in agriculture; little effect has been produced upon the pure Hindus, or on the more civilised inhabitants of the towns. Two missions are at work in the District, one affiliated to the Church Missionary Society, with stations at P\u00e1ljh\u00e1ri, Hir\u00e1mpur, and Godd\u00e1; and the Sant\u00e1l Home Mission, which has its headquarters at Benag\u00e1ria. The population is almost altogether rural; only 6 towns contain from\n2000 to 4000 inhabitants. Deoghar, the only municipality in the District, has a population (1872) of 4861.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice forms the staple food grain of the District. J\u00e1r\u00e1n or \u00e1man, the winter crop of the year, is of two kinds\u2014b\u00e1o, which is sown broadcast; and rop\u00e1 dh\u00e1n, which is transplanted; of these, forty varieties are named. In the alluvial strip of country which runs along the eastern boundary of the District, rice is largely cultivated; and the lower slopes of the ridges in the undulating tract, as well as the swampy ground between those ridges, are also sown with rice. Level terraces are cut out of the hillsides, which thus present the appearance of a series of steps varying from one to five feet in height. These rice terraces are flooded as soon as possible after the rains set in, small banks being left round the edge of each plot to hold the water. Among the other crops of the District are millets, wheat, barley, maize, various pulses and oil-seeds, jute, flax, sugar-cane (of which four varieties are distinguished), cotton, and indigo. There are two seasons for sowing indigo: the spring sowings are put in the ground in March, and reaped in June; and the autumn or October sowings are also cut in June. No accurate statistics are available showing the area under different crops; and it is evident from what has been said regarding the physical aspects of the District, and the mode of rice cultivation in the undulating tract, that there would be considerable difficulty in estimating the aggregate area under rice. The food-grain crops grown in the District are, (1) rice, (2) janir\u00e1 or maize, and (3) other grains, such as millet and pulses. Of this food-grain supply locally produced, rice forms eleven-sixteenths; janir\u00e1 three-sixteenths.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Blight of a serious kind is not known in the Sant\u00e1l Parganas. Owing to the completeness of the natural drainage, floods are almost impossible over a large area; on the rare occasions on which the crops in the alluvial tract have been injured by flood, the loss thus caused was more than compensated by the increased yield of the high lands. Drought caused considerable distress in the Sant\u00e1l Parganas in 1866, and again in 1874. In the former year the price of rice rose in July to $7\\frac{1}{2}$ sers, and in August to $6\\frac{1}{2}$ sers for the rupee; in the latter year the highest price was $10$ sers. The fact of rice rising to $10$ or $14$ sers, or paddy to $20$ or $25$ sers, would indicate the approach of famine, and relief measures would become necessary. It has been remarked that abundant crops of wild fruit are usually concomitants of famine years; and this was the case both in 1866 and in 1874. The mah\u00fad tree, which is very common in the Sant\u00e1l highlands, yielded in 1874 a bounteous crop of edible blossoms and seeds; and the mango was plentiful, and formed a sensible addition to the food supply of the people, who live much on wild fruits and herbs. In 1866, the people in this District, as in\nother parts of Behar, were forced by want to eat the mangoes while still unripe, and thousands of deaths by cholera were the result. In 1874, relief was afforded on such a scale that the fruit was allowed to ripen before being plucked, and there was no outbreak of disease.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District is carried on by means of permanent markets. The chief exports are rice, Indian corn, oil-seeds, tasar-silk cocoons, lac, small-sized timber, hill bamboos, and stone. The imports include European piece-goods, salt, and brass or bell-metal utensils for household use. The principal mart, both for railway and river trade, is Sahibganj, on the Ganges. This place is most favourably situated on the deep channel of the river, which flows at all seasons close under the town; and the railway station is quite near. All the river traffic which passes Sahibganj is registered. Rajmahal, on the loop-line of the East Indian Railway, is another important mart. Both Sahibganj and Rajmahal mainly depend upon their through traffic. They are, in fact, dep\u00f4ts, where the agricultural produce of the trans-Gangetic Districts of Maldah, Purniah, and Bhagalpur is collected for transmission by rail to Calcutta. The manufactures of the District are insignificant. Iron is roughly smelted; coarse cloth is woven, a few bell-metal utensils are made, and indigo is manufactured on a small scale. There are altogether 260 miles of road in the Santal Parganas; and the District is traversed on the east by the loop-line, and on the west by the chord-line of the East Indian Railway\u2014the total length of both lines, including a portion of the small branch connecting Madhupur with the Karharb\u00e2ri collieries, being about 130 miles. Coal is found in the District, but of such inferior quality that all attempts made to work it have failed. Stone is quarried by an English firm under leases from Government and the zamindars, and exported down the Ganges to Calcutta for use as road-metal. In 1876-77, the total registered exports of stone amounted to 628,600 maunds, valued at \u00a3125,720.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860-61, the total revenue of the Santal Parganas amounted to \u00a322,680, and the expenditure to \u00a316,845. In 1870-71, the revenue was \u00a338,901, and the expenditure \u00a314,391. It appears, therefore, that there has been a considerable increase in the District revenue, and a trifling decrease in the expenditure. As, however, no detailed returns are available for the earlier year, it is impossible to state to what causes these changes are due. The land tax forms the most important item of revenue, yielding \u00a311,153 in 1870-71. The next largest item was excise, \u00a310,707. There was no increase in the number of courts between 1860 and 1870; there were in each year 10 magisterial, civil, and revenue courts in the District. For police purposes, the Santal Parganas are divided into 7 police circles (th\u00e2nas). In 1872, the regular police force\nnumbered 299 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34333. There was also a municipal police of 11 men, costing \u00a380, and a rural police or village watch of 1326 men, costing in actual contributions from the villagers (exclusive of rent-free grants) an estimated sum of \u00a3478. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 1636 men of all ranks, giving 1 man to every 3'35 square miles of area or to every 770 of the population. The total estimated cost (exclusive of rent-free grants of land) was \u00a34891, equal to an average of 17s. 10d. per square mile and nearly 1d. per head of population. In the same year, the police conducted 5834 cases of all kinds, the percentage of final convictions to persons brought to trial being 46'2 per cent. D\u00e1kdiit or gang-robbery is very uncommon, the explanation being that the people of the District are so poor that there is no inducement to the crime. Fifteen murders were committed in 1872, and no fewer than 190 true cases of cattle-lifting occurred. This offence has become more frequent of late in consequence of the rise in the price of hides. There were 2 jails and 4 lock-ups in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s in 1872. The average daily population of the Nay\u00e1 Dumk\u00e1 jail in that year was 63'86, and in the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l jail, 118 prisoners. The cost of the jails, including police guard, amounted to \u00a31822. Education has made rapid strides in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s during the last few years. In 1864, there was not a single Government school in the District; in 1870-71, there were only 47; and in 1871-72, 42 Government and aided schools. In 1872-73, owing to the admission of village pathsd\u00edas to the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules, the number of Government and aided schools had risen to 101. The number of pupils in the State schools in 1870-71 was 832; in 1871-72, 1169; and in 1872-73, 2206. There were also in the last-named year 15 private unaided schools, with 101 pupils. For administrative purposes, the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s are divided into 4 Sub-Districts, namely, (1) Nay\u00e1 Dumk\u00e1, (2) R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, (3) Deoghar, and (4) Godd\u00e1. There are 32 fiscal divisions (pargan\u00e1s) in the District. The gross municipal income of Deoghar (the only municipality in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s) amounted in 1871 to \u00a3188, 14s., and the municipal expenditure to \u00a3144, 12s.; rate of municipal taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s varies in the different tracts which have been referred to in describing the physical features of the District. The alluvial strip of land has the damp heat and moist soil characteristic of Bengal; while the undulating and hilly portions are swept by the hot westerly winds of Behar, and resemble in their rapid drainage and dry subsoil the lower plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. In this undulating tract the winter months are very cool, but the hot season is correspondingly trying. The average annual rainfall is over 50 inches. The prevailing endemic diseases of the\nDistrict are fevers of the ordinary type, bowel complaints, and skin diseases. The hill tracts of R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l are very malarious. Epidemics of cholera and small-pox break out from time to time, but have been for the most part confined to the town of Deoghar. The death-rate in two selected urban districts in 1873 was 35\u00b778 per thousand of the population; and in two rural areas, 18\u00b746 per thousand. There are 4 charitable dispensaries in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s.\n\nS\u00e1ntalpur-with-Ch\u00e1dchat.\u2014Native State in the Political Superintendency of P\u00e1lanpur, Bombay. The two Subdivisions of S\u00e1ntalpur and Ch\u00e1dchat together form an estate ruled by a number of petty chieftains. Bounded on the north by the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ra and Sing\u00e1m estates, on the east by the States of W\u00e1r\u00e1hi and R\u00e1dhanpur, and on the south and west by the Rann of Cutch. The two estates measure together about 37 miles in length, and 17 miles in breadth. Area, 440 square miles; pop. (1872), 18,193; estimated yearly revenue, \u00a33500. The country is flat and open. Ghasid or self-produced salt is found in large quantities. There are no rivers, but many ponds exist, which in normal seasons retain water till March, when the inhabitants have to depend upon wells for their supply of water. Fever is common. The holders of this State are J\u00e4reja R\u00e1jputs, kinsmen of the R\u00e1o of Cutch, by whom the country was conquered about 400 years ago. The ruling family hold no sanad authorizing adoption. In matters of succession they follow the rule of primogeniture.\n\nSantapilly (Sentapilli).\u2014Village and lighthouse in Vizagapatam District, Madras.\u2014See CHANTAPILL.\n\nS\u00e1ntipur.\u2014The most populous town in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the river H\u00fagli, in lat. 23\u00b0 14' 24\" N., and long. 88\u00b0 29' 6\" E.

S\u00e1ntipur is famous for its cloth manufactures, which were at first spread throughout the whole District, but afterwards became centralized in this town, owing to its being the site of a commercial residency and the centre of large factories under the East India Company. Considerable trade in local exports and imports. The R\u00e1s-j\u00e1tr\u00e1 festival, in honour of Krishna, is celebrated at S\u00e1ntipur on the day of the full moon in K\u00e1rtik (October or November). The fair is visited by about 25,000 or 26,000 persons, and continues for three days, on the last of which there is a procession along the high-road. S\u00e1ntipur is also a celebrated bathing-place.\n\nS\u00e1oli.\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 5' N., and long. 79\u00b0 50' E., 7 miles east of M\u00fal.

Owes its administrative importance to its healthy position, the neighbourhood being free from jungle.\n\n**Sarahan.**\u2014Town in Bashahr State, Punjab; situated in lat. 31\u00b0 30' N., and long. 77\u00b0 50' E., in a wooded amphitheatre, 3 miles from the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), and backed up by the snow-clad summits of the Kullu Mountains. Thornton describes it as the summer residence of the Bashahr Raja. Tasteful houses in Thibetan style, with pent-roofs, balconies, and intricate carved woodwork. Handsome temple dedicated to the goddess Kali. Northern limit of the Brahmins, none of whom reside to the north of the town. Elevation above sea level, 7246 feet.\n\n**Sarai Aghat.**\u2014Town and ruins in Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 3276.

Bazar of well-built houses, leading to a central market-place. Police station, school-house. Trade in cotton, grain, and indigo seed. Founded toward the close of the 17th century by three Afghan leaders, who came from Farrukhabad District, and built the Sarai Abdur Rasul and a mosque. West of the village stands a lofty and extensive mound, 40 feet in height and about half a mile in diameter, the northern portion being built over with brick houses. It bears the name of Aghat, derived from Muni Agastiya, the mythical regenerator of the Deccan. The houses on the top have been built of bricks from the mound, part of which has been honeycombed by excavations in search of building materials. Images of Buddha, together with gold, silver, and copper coins of all ages, frequently occur. In 1843, about \u00a32000 worth were found among the ruins. Aghat probably formed part of the ancient city of Sankisa.\n\n**Saraikal\u00e1.**\u2014Political estate in Singbh\u00fam District, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 33' and 22\u00b0 54' 30\" N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 53' and 86\u00b0 13' E. long.

Lat. 30\u00b0 35' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 1' E.\n\nSaran.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 40' and 26\u00b0 38' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 58' and 85\u00b0 14' E. long. Area (according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879), 2654 square miles; population (according to the Census of 1872), 2,063,860 souls. Saran forms one of the north-western Districts of the Patna Division. It is bounded on the north by the District of Gorakhpur in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by the Bengal Districts of Champaran and Muzaffarpur, the boundary line being formed by the river Gandak; on the south by the Ganges, which separates it from Shahabad and Patna Districts; on the south-west by the District of Azimgarh in the North-Western Provinces, the Gandak again forming the boundary line; and on the west by Gorakhpur District. The administrative headquarters are at Chhapra, which is also the most populous town of the District.\n\nJurisdiction.\u2014Saran formerly constituted one District with Champaran. The revenue areas of the two Districts were not finally separated until 1866; but the magisterial jurisdictions were first divided in 1837. The Judge of Saran still holds sessions at Motihari in Champaran. The subdivision of Sewan was opened in 1848, and a second subdivision at Gopalganj was sanctioned in 1875.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Saran forms a vast alluvial plain, bounded on three sides by the great rivers Gandak, Gogra (Ghagra), and Ganges, and intersected by numerous nadis or water-channels, which flow in a south-easterly direction, and carry off the drainage of the District. The rivers run on a higher level than the adjacent country, which is therefore liable to inundation when they overtop their banks. Beneath these high banks, lie the basins in which the surface drainage primarily collects, to be discharged into the running channels at a lower stage in their course. The District has the shape of an isosceles triangle. The base, which is very irregular, lies to the north-west; one of the equal sides is formed by the Gandak, and the other by the Gogra and the Ganges; while the apex is at the south-east corner, where the\nGandak and the Ganges join at Sonpur. From this spot, the levels slope very gently up towards the western parts of the District. Kochai Kot, in the north-west corner, is 222 feet above mean sea level, while Sonpur is only 168 feet. The whole District is beautifully wooded, and mango-groves are very numerous. The lower levels are but sparingly used for rice cultivation; high rice lands predominate, and on these indigo, opium, wheat, barley, and several kinds of pulse are also grown. The soil is in many places saliferous, and saltpetre is extracted by the N\u00faniy\u00e1s, a poor and hardy caste. There are no hills in S\u00e1ran. The only rivers which are navigable all the year round are the three great streams already mentioned\u2014the Ganges, Gandak, and Gogra. Among the smaller n\u00e1dis, many of which dry up altogether in the hot weather, are the Sund\u00ed or D\u00e1h\u00e1, the Jhar\u00e1h\u00ed, the Gandak\u00ed, the Gangr\u00ed, the Dhan\u00e1i, and the Khats\u00e1, all of which ultimately fall into the Gogra or the Ganges. The drainage of the District is from north-west to south-east, and is carried off by the many small n\u00e1dis into the larger streams. When the rainfall is unusually heavy, these n\u00e1dis are unable to contain all the water, and large tracts of cultivated ground are inundated. The consequences are specially disastrous when the mouths of the n\u00e1dis are stopped by high floods in the great rivers into which they flow. There is very little jungle in S\u00e1ran, and large game is not met with, although both tigers and leopards are said to have been at one time very common in the District. Among the game birds found are quail, wild duck, snipe, plover, partridge, ortolans, and green pigeons. Snakes are very numerous.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Several early estimates were made of the population of S\u00e1ran. In 1800, a calculation based on an enumeration of the houses gave 1,104,000 as the number of inhabitants; but this included the present District of Champ\u00e1ran, which was not separated from S\u00e1ran until 1837. Estimates based on similar enumerations were made in 1843, 1847, 1854, 1855, and 1860, the earliest giving a population of 1,376,215, and the latest 1,271,729. The first accurate Census was that taken in 1872, which disclosed a total population of 2,063,860 persons, inhabiting 4350 villages and 293,524 houses. The area over which the Census was taken being 2654 square miles, the following averages are obtained:\u2014Number of villages per square mile, 1\u00b764; houses per square mile, 111; persons per village, 474; persons per house, 7; persons per square mile, 778. The density of population is greater than in any other District of Lower Bengal, except the metropolitan Districts of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s and H\u00fagl\u00ed. In the s\u00e1dr or headquarters Subdivision, the density rises to 859, while in three th\u00e1nds of that Subdivision (Dighw\u00e1ra, M\u00e1njh\u00ed, and Mashrak) the average exceeds 900. Even in the two th\u00e1nds where population is least dense, viz. Barag\u00e1on and Barauli, the rates per square mile\nare 605 and 620 respectively. Classified according to sex, the population is divided into 996,683 males and 1,067,177 females; percentage of males, 48.3. This low proportion is explained by the fact that a large number of the men leave the District for service or as soldiers. Previous to the Mutiny, it is said that as many as 10,000 sepoys were natives of this District. Classified according to age, there are, under 12 years\u2014boys, 389,786, and girls, 353,524; total, 743,310: over 12\u2014males, 606,897, and females, 713,653; total, 1,320,550. The ethnical division of the people gives the following results:\u2014Europeans number 95, of whom 88 are British; of mixed race (Eurasians) there are 29; and the remainder, 2,063,736, are Asiatics, including 16 Nep\u00e1lis. The number of Hindus is 1,577,914; persons of Hindu origin not recognising caste, 22,952; Muhammadans, 241,590; aboriginal tribes, 7796; semi-Hinduized aborigines, 213,468. The chief aboriginal tribe in S\u00e1ran is that of the Bhars, who number 7647; while of the semi-Hinduized aborigines, the most numerous tribes are the Cham\u00e1rs, or workers in leather (94,844), the Dos\u00e1dhs (73,046), and the Binds (18,429). Superior Hindu castes are largely represented, the Br\u00e1hmans numbering 158,109 and the R\u00e1jputs 225,873. The most numerous caste in S\u00e1ran is that of the Go\u00e1las (or Ah\u00edrs), the herdsmen of the country. They bear a bad character for turbulence and dishonesty, and figure largely in the jail returns. Other numerous castes are\u2014the Koeris (141,209), who are the best cultivators in the District, holding most of the opium lands, from which they raise first-rate crops; and the Kurmis (100,790), also an agricultural caste. Of the 22,952 persons described in the Census Report as being of Hindu origin, but not recognising caste, the large majority, 18,612, are Atiths, a sect of Sivaites who are in theory celibates. Vaishnavs number 3777. The Muhammadans are divided into 430,030 Shaikhs, 11,420 Path\u00e1ns, 3710 Sayyids, and 369 Mughals, while 183,061 are \u2018unspecified,\u2019 making a total of 241,590. Classified on the basis of religion, the population of S\u00e1ran consists of\u20141,822,048 Hindus, or 88.3 per cent. of the total population; 241,590 Muhammadans, or 11.3 per cent.; 207 Christians, and 16 \u2018others.\u2019 The population is entirely agricultural, the so-called towns being, with the exception of the three municipalities of Chhapra, Sewan, and Revelganj, merely large villages or collections of hamlets in the midst of which are conducted all the operations of rural life. No fewer than 71 of these \u2018towns\u2019 contain between 2000 and 5000 persons; 2 have from 5000 to 6000; 2 from 10,000 to 15,000; and 1 nearly 50,000. Of towns proper the five most populous are\u2014Chhapra, pop. (1872) 46,287; Revelganj, 13,415; Aliganj Sewan, 11,099; Panapur, 5871; and Manjh\u00ed, 5747. Of these, the first three are municipalities, with a total income in 1872 of \u00a33383.\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is, perhaps, the most important crop grown in S\u00e1ran; though the area under rice is largely exceeded by the collective area under such inferior grains as makai, kodo, and marud. It consists of two great harvests\u2014the bhadai or autumn harvest, and the agh\u00e1ni or winter harvest, the latter being by far the larger of the two. The bhadai is generally sown broadcast on high ground in June, and reaped in September. Its chief varieties are, (1) sathi, (2) sarha, (3) katki or munga, and (4) karh\u00e1ni. Agh\u00e1ni rice is sown on low ground. In June, after rain has fallen, a nursery is selected, and ploughed three or four times before the seed is sown. It is afterwards transplanted, and is harvested in December or January. The 33 principal varieties of this rice are as follows:\u2014(1) Bhoinsloti, (2) kanug\u00e1, (3) kh\u00e1h\u00e1, (4) j\u00e1gar, (5) senegra, (6) jasari\u00e1, (7) thanom\u00ed, (8) s\u00e1ro, (9) ser\u00e1, (10) salld, (11) shakhjir\u00e1, (12) kalunj\u00ed, (13) s\u00e1tul, (14) sel\u00e1, (15) l\u00e1nj\u00ed, (16) batar\u00e1ni, (17) k\u00e1jri, (18) l\u00e1lld\u00e1na, (19) umath, (20) rathgoli, (21) dachni, (22) bellaur, (23) baharn\u00ed, (24) b\u00e1nsmati, (25) s\u00e1mjir\u00e1, (26) j\u00e1gar, (27) khera, (28) r\u00e1s, (29) pah\u00e1ri\u00e1, (30) singh\u00e1r, (31) sy\u00e1msundar, (32) karanga, and (33) gajpatta. Other cereals cultivated are wheat, barley, and Indian corn. Green crops comprise matar or peas, khesari, gram, arhar, mug, urid, beans, sweet potatoes, mustard-seed, etc. Cotton, hemp, and flax are also grown. P\u00e1n or betel-leaf is generally cultivated on high land situated near a well or tank, in the vicinity of the homestead. Special crops comprise tobacco, sugar-cane, indigo, and opium; the latter being cultivated only under Government licence. The total area under indigo is estimated at 45,000 acres, yielding an average out-turn of 8000 cwt., valued at \u00a3280,000. The total area under poppy is about 50,000 acres, with a yield of 900,000 lbs. Manure is used whenever it can be procured, and irrigation is largely practised for the cold-weather crops. The poorer class of cultivators are, as a rule, deeply in debt. Rents are high, the following being returned as the average rates throughout the District: Transplanted rice, 9s. 6\u00bdd. per acre; broadcast rice, 6s. 9d.; Indian corn, wheat, marud, arhar, and cotton, 11s. 3d.; kodo, barley, and pulse, 9s. 5\u00bdd.; poppy, 15s. 8d.; indigo, 10s. 4\u00bdd.; and sugar-cane, 9s. 11d. It is very common to find Br\u00e1hmans, B\u00e1bhans, R\u00e1jputs, and other high castes holding the best lands in a village at rates varying from 50 to 75 per cent. below what a low-caste man pays for inferior land. Rents are now almost invariably paid in money, instead of in kind, as was formerly common. As a general rule, the cultivators claim to hold under a right of occupancy, but such tenures are rarely transferable, except with permission of the landlord. Tenants holding their lands without liability to enhancement do not number more than 5 per cent. of the whole. Wages have increased about 30 per cent of late years. The rates for ordinary day-labourers vary from 2\u00bdd. to 3d. per\nday, according as they are employed in the country or the town; women and boys receive from 1\u00bdd. to 2\u00bdd. per day. Bricklayers and blacksmiths get from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. a day; sawyers, 4\u00bdd.; and carpenters, from 3\u00bdd. to 6d. a day. Prices of food grains have also risen in like proportion. In 1871-72, which may be taken as an ordinary year, 40 lbs. of common rice could be obtained for the rupee. In 1877-78, when scarcity prevailed owing to an ill-distributed rainfall and excessive exportation to Southern India, only 27 lbs. of rice were to be got for the same money. Ancient records show that in 1790 the price was 150 lbs. for the rupee.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is subject to blight, flood, and drought. The most common kind of blight is called hind\u00e1, a mildew which attacks wheat and barley. Insects do considerable damage; and also hailstorms in the cold weather. S\u00e1ran District, being bounded on two sides by large rivers, which flow on ridges and carry enormous volumes of water, is peculiarly exposed to inundation. The northern side of the District is now, however, completely protected by the Gandak embankment. Towards the south, along the banks of the Ganges and Gogra, protective works are still required, as large tracts are inundated nearly every year. The old records are full of complaints about these inundations, which in many cases rendered a remission of revenue necessary. The most noteworthy floods of late years occurred in 1871 and 1874. Droughts have occurred several times, the worst known having taken place in 1866 and 1874, both of which were caused by the failure of the local rains. During the scarcity of 1874, relief works on an extensive scale were undertaken by Government, and in the first fortnight of June a daily average of 229,885 persons were employed in road-making. Advances of grain were made to the extent of 324,831 maunds. Prices were kept down, however, by Government importations, and the highest rate reached for common rice in 1874 was 12s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt., as against \u00a31, 1s. 10d. per cwt. in 1866. To remedy this liability to drought, a scheme of irrigation was commenced in 1878, by which the waters of the Gandak will be led through the centre of the District. The total cost is estimated at only \u00a350,000, on which sum a few planters and zamind\u00e1rs have guaranteed interest at the rate of 4\u00bd per cent. The total area to be irrigated is estimated at 140,000 acres.\n\nMeans of Communication, Trade, etc. \u2014 The District possesses a total length of 890 miles of made road, but there are no railways or canals. The principal manufactures are indigo, sugar, brass-work, pottery, saltpetre, and cloth. The chief exports from the District are oil-seeds, indigo, saltpetre, sugar, grain of all sorts, except rice; the principal articles of import being rice, salt, and European piece-goods. The great trading mart of the District is Revelganj. In 1876-77, the\ntotal registered river traffic of S\u00e1ran District, including both imports and exports, amounted to just two millions sterling. A great portion of this total is merely through traffic, which comes down from Oudh and the North-Western Provinces, and changes boat at Revelganj and Semuria, on its way to Patna or Calcutta. Revelganj is perhaps the largest mart for oilseeds (chiefly linseed) in all India. In 1876-77, the total registered import of oilseeds into the District was valued at \u00a3265,000; the total export was \u00a3370,000, thus leaving a balance of more than \u00a3100,000 for the local produce. As regards food grains, however, the figures show decisively that S\u00e1ran is unable to supply its own dense population. In 1876-77, the imports of food grains of all kinds were valued at \u00a3326,000, as compared with exports valued at only \u00a3118,000. The other principal items of export were indigo (\u00a3179,000), and saltpetre and other saline substances (\u00a367,000). Salt was imported to the value of \u00a3143,000.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1794, the net revenue of the District (which then included Champ\u00e1ran) amounted to \u00a3195,254, with a civil expenditure of \u00a327,496; in 1850-51, the revenue (including Champ\u00e1ran) was \u00a3230,567, with an expenditure of \u00a324,131; in 1870-71 (after the separation of Champ\u00e1ran), the net revenue of S\u00e1ran was \u00a3185,072, with a civil expenditure of \u00a343,826. The land tax, here as elsewhere, forms by far the greatest proportion of the District revenue, and amounted in 1870-71 to \u00a3122,344, paid by 3400 separate estates. For police purposes the District is divided into 10 circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s). The regular police force in 1872 consisted of 408 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a36990, or an average of 1 policeman to every 6\u00b75 square miles of the District area and to every 5058 of the population. The municipal force in the towns consisted of 173 men of all ranks, maintained at a cost to municipal funds of \u00a31322. The village watch or rural police numbered 6067 men, maintained, either by the samind\u00e1rs or by service lands held rent free, at an estimated total cost of \u00a35522 a year. Each village watchman has charge of 41 houses on an average, and receives an average pay in money or lands of 12 \u00e1nn\u00e1s a month, or 18s. a year. Including the regular police, municipal police, and the village watch, the total machinery for protecting person and property in S\u00e1ran District consisted, at the end of 1872, of 6648 men of all ranks; equal to an average of 1 man to every 0\u00b739 of a square mile of the District area, or to every 310 of the population. The estimated cost from all sources of maintaining this force, including value of rent-free lands, amounted in 1872 to \u00a313,834; equal to a charge of \u00a35, 4s. 3d. per square mile of the area, or about 1\u00bdd. per head of the population. There are 2 jails in the District, at Chhapr\u00e1 and Sew\u00e1n towns, with a daily average prison population in 1870 of 311, the total admissions being 1422.\nAverage cost of maintenance per prisoner, \u00a36, 6s. 8d.; average earnings per prisoner, \u00a31, 13s. 11d. Serious crime is not very prevalent; the principal criminal classes being the Dos\u00e1dhs, Ah\u00edrs, and Maghya Doms. Education has rapidly progressed since the introduction of Sir George Campbell's educational reforms in 1872. In 1870-71, there were only 9 Government or aided schools in the District, attended by 585 pupils. At the close of the year 1873-74, the inspected schools numbered 326, with 7066 pupils; equal to an average of 1 school for every 8 square miles of the District area, and 3\u00b74 pupils to every thousand of the population. For administrative and fiscal purposes, S\u00e1ran is divided into 2 Subdivisions and 17 parg\u00e1nas.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The seasons in S\u00e1ran are very similar to those of Tirhut, but perhaps a little hotter. The hot weather begins about the end of March; and in a fortnight afterwards, hot westerly winds begin to blow during the day. At night, the wind comes generally from the east, and the temperature is comparatively cool, being lowered by occasional thunderstorms. The rains set in about the middle of June, and continue, with intermissions, till about the end of September or the middle of October. September is by far the most trying month of the year; the air is damp and steamy, while the sun's rays are extremely strong. The cold weather begins about the middle of October, and continues till the beginning of March. Average annual rainfall, 45\u00b727 inches. The prevailing diseases are cholera, smallpox, fever, and dysentery. The civil surgeon states that it is doubtful if cholera is ever really absent from the District; and it commits great ravages towards the end of the hot and beginning of the rainy season. Small-pox comes next in intensity, but the people are beginning to avail themselves of vaccination. Both diseases are said to be now on the decrease, owing to the improved habits of the people and the high state of cultivation. The people who live in the neighbourhood of low rice lands suffer a good deal from fever. Dysentery, the result of bad water and insufficient clothing, is sometimes very severe. Six Government charitable dispensaries afford medical relief at Chhapr\u00e1, Sew\u00e1n, Hatw\u00e1, Bhori, Gop\u00e1lganj, and Revelganj. Cattle-disease exists in the form of guti or rinderpest, and kurh\u00e1 or foot-and-mouth disease.\n\nS\u00e1rand\u00e1.\u2014Hill range in the extreme south-west corner of Singbh\u00fam District, bordering on Gangpur State, Bengal. Consists of a grand mass of mountains, rising to the height of 3500 feet, known as 'S\u00e1rand\u00e1 of the seven hundred hills.' The population inhabiting this region is scattered over a few poor hamlets nestling in deep valleys, and belongs for the most part to one of the least reclaimed tribes of Kols.\n\nS\u00e1rand\u00e1.\u2014One of the pirs or groups of villages of the Kolh\u00e1n, in vol. viii.\nSingh\u00fam District, Bengal. According to the Survey of 1868, the p\u00edr contains 43 villages. Lat. $22^\\circ 1' 15''$ to $22^\\circ 30' N.$; long. $85^\\circ 2' to 85^\\circ 28' E.$\n\nS\u00e1rang\u00e1rh.\u2014Native State attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces, formerly one of the Ath\u00e1ra Garhj\u00e1t or \u2018Eighteen Forts,\u2019 lying between $21^\\circ 21'$ and $21^\\circ 45' 0''$ N. lat., and between $82^\\circ 59'$ and $83^\\circ 31' E.$ long. Bounded on the north by the Chandrapur chiefship and R\u00e1igarh State, on the east by Sambalpur District, on the south by the Phuljhar chiefship, and on the west by Bil\u00e1sipur District. Pop. (1872), 37,091 (of whom 25,438 were Hindus), residing in 364 villages and 7632 houses. Area, 540 square miles, of which 320 were cultivated in 1877, while of the portion lying waste 80 square miles were returned as cultivable. Density of population, 68\u00b768 persons per square mile. The country is generally level, but in the south and east rise two considerable ranges of hills. The Mah\u00e1nadi flows to the north of the State; the only other river worth mention is the L\u00e1th. Though no large forests remain, patches of st\u00e1j, dh\u00e1urd, tend\u00fa, etc. are met with here and there. The wild buffaloes, formerly numerous, have abandoned the State; but tigers, bears, and leopards still range the hills and jungle. The soil is for the most part light and friable, with a strong admixture of sand. Rice forms the staple crop; but pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, cotton, and a little wheat are also produced. The only manufactures are tas\u00e1r-silk cloth and coarse cotton cloth; and though iron-ore abounds, no mines are worked. The main road between Sambalpur and R\u00e1ipur runs along part of the southern boundary, and the Mah\u00e1nadi supplies means of communication by water for 50 miles. The Chhat\u00edsgarh dialect is the spoken language of the State, and the Hind\u00ed character is used for writing. The chief is a Gond, and traces his origin through 54 generations up to Jagdeva S\u00e1, a son of Narendra S\u00e1, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1nji in Bhand\u00e1ra about 91 A.D. In return for military assistance, Narsinh Deva, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanpur, presented Jagdeva S\u00e1 with a khilat or personal mark of distinction, and conferred on him the title of d\u00edv\u00e1n, together with 84 villages in the S\u00e1rang\u00e1rh tract. Forty-two generations later, when Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 was d\u00edv\u00e1n, Raghoji Bhonsl\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur was stopped on his way to Cuttack by the Phuljhar people, who held the S\u00ednghora Pass against him. Raghoji applied to Banoj\u00ed, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanpur, who directed Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 to clear the pass. For this service, Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 received the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, with the right to carry a standard. The title was confirmed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatra S\u00e1 of Sambalpur, when S\u00e1rang\u00e1rh became a dependency of his kingdom; and by their military assistance from time to time to the Sambalpur princes, succeeding R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1rang\u00e1rh gained further grants of villages and parg\u00e1ns, and gradually made S\u00e1rang\u00e1rh a State of some importance. The only\nremarkable building in the State is the temple of Samleswar Deva, erected in 1748 by Aditya S\u00e1 D\u00edw\u00e1n. Sangr\u00e1m Sinh, the late R\u00e1j\u00e1, established a good school at his chief town, and there are also indigenous schools in other parts. In 1872, 303 boys under twelve, and 564 males above that age, were returned as able to read and write, or as being under instruction. During the minority of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Bhaw\u00e1ni Prat\u00e1b Sinh, his mother, has administered the State. The tribute is \u00a3135; and the estimated gross revenue, \u00a3800. The climate is unhealthy, and fever prevails widely from September to November.\n\nSaraswati (Sarsuti).\u2014Sacred river of the Punjab, famous in the early Br\u00e1hmanical annals. Rises in lat. 30\u00b0 23' N., long. 77\u00b0 19' E., just beyond the British border, in the low hills of S\u00edrm\u00far State; emerges upon the plain at Zadh Budri in Amb\u00e1l\u00e1, a place esteemed sacred by all Hindus; flows in a general south-westerly direction, and loses itself more than once in the sands, but reappears again with little diminished volume; passes by the holy town of Thanesar and the numerous shrines of the Kurukshetra, a tract celebrated as a centre of pilgrimages; enters Karn\u00e1l District and Pati\u00e1la State, and finally joins the Ghaggar in S\u00edrsa District (lat. 29\u00b0 51' N., long. 76\u00b0 5' E.).\n\nIn ancient times, the united stream below the point of junction appears to have borne the name of Sarsuti, and, undiminished by irrigation near the hills, to have flowed across the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na plains, debouching into the Indus below its confluence with the Punjab rivers. The deserted bed can still be traced as far as Mirgarh in Bah\u00e1walpur; but the water now penetrates no farther than Bhatner in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, where its trickling streams finally lose themselves in the sandy plain. The numerous dams across the hill torrents at the foot of the mountains probably account for the drying up of the ancient channel. The name of Saraswati, 'the river of pools,' sufficiently describes the character of the stream in its upper portion, where it dries up partially in the early months of the year, becoming a mere succession of separate ponds. To each of these is attached a legend and a shrine, visited by thousands of pilgrims every year. According to Hindu legend, the disappearance of the Saraswati in the sands is accounted for as follows:\u2014Saraswat\u00ed was the daughter of Mah\u00e1deo; but her father one day, in a drunken fit, approaching her with the intention of violating her modesty, the Hindu Arethusa fled, and dived underground whenever she saw her pursuer gaining upon her; and the river, which sprang up in her track, still disappears underground at the self-same spots. By devout Hindus the Saraswati is supposed to flow in a subterranean course till it joins the Ganges and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) at Allahabad, where the moisture on the walls of the crypt in the temple of the Undying Banian tree forms a conclusive proof of its existence in the eyes of the faithful. The real direction of the Saraswati basin, however, lies towards the Indus below\nMith\u00e1nkot. Some of the earliest Aryan settlements in India were on the banks of the Saraswat\u00ed, and the surrounding country has from almost Vedic times been held in high veneration. The Hindus identify the river with Saraswat\u00ed, the Sanskrit Goddess of Speech. See Muir's Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. i., many passages (ed. 1868); General Cunningham's Anc. Geog. Ind. pp. 331-33 (ed. 1871); Prof. Dowson's Dict. Hindu Mythol. p. 284 (ed. 1879); and article INDIA, ante, Vol. iv.\n\nSaraswat\u00ed.\u2014River of H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Formerly the main stream of the Ganges, and navigable by large vessels as far as SATGAON, the royal port of Bengal in the 16th century. The Saraswat\u00ed has now silted up, and become a foul shallow creek, branching south-west from the H\u00fagl\u00ed near Tribeni, lat. 22\u00b0 59' N., long. 88\u00b0 26' 45\" E. An offshoot of the ancient stream debouches into the D\u00e1modar, near Ampt\u00e1, the main channel falling into the H\u00fagl\u00ed a short distance below the Calcutta Botanical Gardens. The remains of large ships are frequently discovered many feet deep in the ground, which now covers the bed of the Saraswat\u00ed.\n\nSaraswat\u00ed.\u2014River of Western India, rising in Mount Abu, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Flowing through the P\u00e1lanpur and R\u00e1dhanpur States of the Mahi K\u00e1nth\u00e1 Agency, and through the Patan Subdivision of Baroda State, the Saraswat\u00ed, after a south-westerly course of over 100 miles, enters the Rann of Cutch to the east of the State of that name. In the vicinity of Sidhpur and Patan towns, by which the river passes, the Saraswat\u00ed is said to have a subterraneous course of several miles, reappearing before it enters the R\u00e1dhanpur territory. The river is fordable almost everywhere; its banks and bed are generally sandy; it is nowhere navigable. The only importance of the Saraswat\u00ed consists in its sanctity. It is visited by Hindus, especially those who have lost their mothers; Sidhpur on this river being considered the appropriate place to perform rites in honour of a deceased mother, as Gay\u00e1 in Behar is assigned for ceremonies in honour of a deceased father.\n\nS\u00e1rath\u00e1.\u2014Port on the river of the same name in Balasor District, Bengal. Lat. 21\u00b0 34' 45\" N., long. 87\u00b0 8' 16\" E. Frequented by native rice sloops, the river being navigable as far as Nalitagarh, 8 miles from the sea. The sister port of S\u00e1rath\u00e1 is Chhanuya.\n\nSarath Deogarh.\u2014Sub-District and town in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.\u2014See DEOGARH.\n\nSar\u00e1yan.\u2014River of Oudh. Rising in Kheri District in lat. 27\u00b0 46' N., and long. 80\u00b0 32' E., after a course of 49 miles in a south-easterly direction it enters S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, where it receives the Jamw\u00e1ri on its left bank, in lat. 27\u00b0 32' N., and long. 80\u00b0 47' E. Thence it flows for about 3 miles in a north-westerly course, and, resuming its previous direction, joins the Gumti in lat. 27\u00b0 9' N., and long. 80\u00b0 55' E. Total length, about 95 miles. It causes destructive floods in some\nyears, as it drains a considerable area of country with its numerous affluents.\n\n**S\u00e1rd\u00e1.**\u2014River of North-Western India and Oudh, which takes its rise in the loftier ranges of the Him\u00e1layas, which separate Kum\u00e1un from Thibet, at an altitude of 18,000 feet. It debouches from the hills at Barmdeo, 148 miles from its source, in lat. 29\u00b0 6' N., and long. 80\u00b0 13' E., at an altitude of 847 feet above sea level. The river is here 450 feet broad, with a minimum discharge of 5600 cubic feet per second. Shortly after leaving Barmdeo, it divides into several channels, which reunite 9 miles farther down at Banb\u00e1sa, but again separate, and finally join at Mandi\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, 168 miles from its source, where the last rapids occur, and the stream becomes an ordinary river of the plains. Eleven miles lower down, it touches British territory in Khairigarh parg\u00e1n\u00e1, Oudh; and 11 miles farther on, or 190 miles from its source, it joins the CHAUKA near Mothia Gh\u00e1t. From this point the united stream takes the name of the Chauka, till it falls into the GOGRA on its right bank, in lat. 27\u00b0 9' N., and long. 81\u00b0 30' E.\n\n**Sardh\u00e1na.**\u2014Tahsil of Meerut (M\u00edrath) District, North-Western Provinces, lying on either side of the Hindan river, and watered by the Ganges and Eastern Jumna Canals. Area, 251 square miles, of which 184 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 147,398; land revenue, \u00a330,043; total Government revenue, \u00a333,051; rental paid by the cultivators, \u00a355,455.\n\n**Sardh\u00e1na.**\u2014Town in Meerut (M\u00edrath) District, North-Western Provinces, and former capital of the famous Begam Samru. Lat. 29\u00b0 9' 6\" N., long. 77\u00b0 39' 26\" E.; pop. (1872), 12,466, consisting of 6471 Hindus, 5641 Muhammadans, and 354 Christians. Stands on a low site, near the Ganges Canal, 12 miles north-west of Meerut city. The town has a poor and decayed appearance, being in a decadent condition since the death of the famous Begam Samru. Northward lies Lashk\u00e1rganj, founded by the Begam as a camp, and the old fort; next succeeds a wide parade-ground; and southward stands the town itself. Local tradition assigns the foundation of Sardh\u00e1na to one R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sarkat at a period anterior to the Muhammadan conquest. Its modern history is interesting from its connection with the well-known adventurers Walter Reinhard and George Thomas. The following sketch is condensed from an account given in the official Gazetteer of Meerut. Walter Reinhard, a soldier of fortune, better known by the name of Samru or Sombre, was a butcher by profession, and a native of Luxemburg. He came to India as a soldier in the French army, and deserting that service, took employment with the British, where he attained to the rank of sergeant. Deserting again, he rejoined the French service at Chandernagore, and on the surrender of that settlement accompanied M. Law in his wanderings throughout India from 1757 to 1760. In the latter year, Law's party joined the army of Sh\u00e1h Alam in Bengal,\nand remained with the emperor until his defeat in 1760 at Gaya by Colonel Carnac, in his attempt to reconquer Bengal from the Nawab. Samru next entered the service of M\u00edr K\u00e1sim, by whom he was employed to murder the English prisoners at Patna (PATNA DISTRICT, q.v.) in October 1763. He succeeded in escaping into Oudh, and afterwards entered the service of several native chiefs, until in 1777 he entered the service of M\u00edrza Najf-Kh\u00e1n, the general and minister of Sh\u00e1h Alam II., and received the pargan\u00e1 of Sardh\u00e1na in fief, as an assignment for the support of his battalions. He died here in the following year, and was succeeded by his widow, the well-known Begam Samru, who continued to keep the military force. This remarkable woman, the illegitimate daughter of a Musalm\u00e1n of Arab descent, and the mistress of Reinhard before becoming his wife, assumed the entire management of the estate, and the personal command of the troops, which numbered 5 battalions of sepoys, about 300 European officers and gunners, with 50 pieces of cannon, and a body of irregular horse. In 1781 the Begam was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, under the name of Johanna. Her troops rendered excellent service to the emperor in the battle of Gokalgarh in 1788, where a charge of Sardh\u00e1na troops, personally led by the Begam and the celebrated adventurer George Thomas, saved the fortunes of the day at a critical moment. In 1792, the Begam married Levassoult, a Frenchman in command of her artillery. In 1795, her European officers became disaffected, and an illegitimate son of Reinhard, known as Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, put himself at their head. The Begam and her husband were forced to fly. In the flight the Begam's palanquin was overtaken by the rebels, and she stabbed herself to save herself from falling into their hands; and thereupon Levassoult shot himself, in pursuance of a vow that if one of them was killed the other would commit suicide. The Begam's wound, however, was but a slight one, and she was brought back to Sardh\u00e1na. Another account of this incident is that the Begam had become tired of her husband, and that it was all a plot on her own part to get rid of him. However, all her power passed temporarily into the hands of Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, and she was treated with great personal indignity, till she was restored to power some months later by her old general George Thomas, and remained in undisturbed possession of her estates till her death in 1836.\n\nAfter the battle of Delhi, and the British conquest of the Upper Do\u00e1b, the Begam submitted to the new rulers, and ever after remained distinguished for her loyalty. Her possessions were numerous, and included several considerable towns, such as Sardh\u00e1na, Baraut, Barn\u00e1wa, and Dankaur, besides lying in the immediate neighbourhood of great marts like Meerut, Delhi, Kh\u00farja, and B\u00e1gp\u00e1t. Her income from her estates in Meerut District alone amounted to \u00a356,721 per annum. She kept\nup a considerable army, and had places of residence at Khirwa, Jal\u00e1lpur, Meerut, and Delhi, besides her palace at Sardh\u00e1na. She endowed with large sums the Catholic churches of Madras, Calcutta, Agra, and Bombay, the Sardh\u00e1na Cathedral, the Sardh\u00e1na poorhouse, St. John's Roman Catholic College, and the Meerut Catholic Chapel. She also made over a lakh of Sonat rupees to the Bishop of Calcutta for charitable purposes, and subscribed liberally to Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n institutions. Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, the son of Samru, died in 1802, and left one daughter, whom the Begam married to Mr. Dyce, an officer in her service. David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, the issue of this marriage, died in Paris, July 1851, and the Sardh\u00e1na estates passed to his widow, the Hon. Mary Anne Forester, daughter of Viscount St. Vincent. The Begam's residence, on the east side of the town, is a fine modern house, with a grand flight of steps at the entrance and extensive grounds. It is well furnished, and contains some good pictures. The Roman Catholic Cathedral, built in 1822, stands south of the town, and is an imposing building, surrounded by an ornamental wall. St. John's College, for training priests, occupies a low masonry house, once the Begam's private residence. Two excellent papers on the Sardh\u00e1na estate, and a biography of George Thomas, in the Calcutta Review for January and April 1880, by Mr. H. G. Keane, B.C.S., differ in some unimportant degrees from the history of the estate as given above. Four Jain temples. Schools. Tahs\u00edli, police station, post office. Old fort at Lashkarganj in ruins. Insufficient drainage causes malarious fevers, but local funds are being applied to remedy this evil. Essentially an agricultural town, with little trade and no manufactures.\n\nSareni.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Khiron, on the east by D\u00e1lmau, on the south by the Ganges, and on the west by Daundia Khera. Area, 114 square miles, of which 61 are cultivated. Pop. (1869), 60,825, namely, 59,471 Hindus and 1354 Muhammadans. Of the 169 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 157 are held under idlukd\u00e1ri tenure, Bais Kshattriyas being the chief proprietary body. Government land revenue, \u00a319,100, equal to an average of 5s. 2\u00bdd. per acre.\n\nSarg\u00faja.\u2014The largest of the Native States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; lies between 22\u00b0 37' 30\" and 24\u00b0 6' 30\" N. lat., and between 82\u00b0 32' 5\" and 84\u00b0 7' E. long. Area, 6103 square miles; population in 1872, 182,831. Bounded on the north by Mirz\u00e1pur, a District of the North-Western Provinces, and the State of Rewah; on the east by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District; on the south by Jashpur, Ud\u00e1ipur, and the District of Bil\u00e1spur in the Central Provinces; and on the west by Kore\u00e1.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Sarg\u00faja may be described in general terms as a secluded basin, walled in on the north-east and south by massive hill-barriers, and protected from approach on the west by the forest-\nclad tract of Kore\u00e1. The eastern portion of the State consists of an undulating tableland about 2500 feet above the sea, continuous with, but slightly higher than, the adjoining plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper. From this again isolated hill ranges, and p\u0101ts or plateaux, capped with a horizontal stratum of trap rock, rise to an elevation of 3500 and 4000 feet, forming on the north the boundary of Pal\u00e1mau, and blending in the south with the northern Jashpur Hills. The two most prominent physical features of Sarg\u00faja are the M\u00e1inp\u00e1t, a magnificent tableland 18 miles long, from 6 to 8 broad, and 3781 feet above sea level; and the Jam\u00edr\u00e1p\u00e1t, a long winding ridge about 2 miles wide. The M\u00e1inp\u00e1t is well wooded and watered throughout, and supplies extensive grazing fields during the summer months; the pasturage dues of this tract alone are estimated at \u00a3250 per annum. The chief peaks in the State are Mail\u00e1n, 4024 feet; J\u00e1m, 3827; and Partagharsa, 3804. The principal rivers are the Kanhar, Rehr, and M\u00e1h\u00e1n, which flow northwards into the S\u00f3n; and the Sankh, a tributary of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed. None of these streams is navigable. Coal is found in Central Sarg\u00faja, in the BISRAMPUR field. There is a group of hot springs at Tat\u00e1pan\u00ed, in the north of the State; their maximum temperature is 184\u00b0 F. S\u00e1l timber abounds everywhere.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of Sarg\u00faja is extremely obscure. Authentic records date from 1758, when a Marhatt\u00e1 army in progress to the Ganges overran the State, and compelled its chief to acknowledge himself a tributary of the Berar Government. In consequence of the chief having aided a rebellion in Pal\u00e1mau against the British at the end of the last century, an expedition entered Sarg\u00faja under the command of Colonel Jones. Order was restored, and a treaty was concluded between the British Government and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, which, however, proved inoperative. As soon as the British force retired, fresh disputes broke out between the ruling chief and his relations; and in 1813, Major Roughsedge, the Political Agent, went to Sarg\u00faja and endeavoured to settle the affairs of the State. The young R\u00e1j\u00e1 being imbecile, a d\u00edv\u00e1n was appointed to carry on the government; but this officer was soon afterwards killed, and an attempt to seize the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his two R\u00e1n\u00eds was only frustrated by the gallantry of a small guard of British Sepoys who had been left in Sarg\u00faja for their protection. Until 1818, the State continued to be the scene of constant lawlessness; but in that year it was ceded to the British Government under a provisional agreement concluded with Madhoji Bhonsl\u00e1 (Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib), and order was soon restored. In 1826, the chief received the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of 182,831 persons (1872), inhabiting 1295 villages and 36,463 houses, consisted of 91,291 males and 91,540 females; proportion of males in total population, 49'9 per cent.\nThe Dravidian aborigines (of whom the Gonds and Uraons form by far the most numerous section of the population) numbered 73,256, or 40.1 per cent.; the Kolarian tribes, 39,416, or 21.5 per cent.; Hindus, 68,789, or 37.6 per cent.; Muhammadans, 1370, or 0.8 per cent. of the total population. Average density of population, 30 per square mile; villages per square mile, 0.21; persons per village, 141; houses per square mile, 6; persons per house, 5. The residence of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 is at Bisr\u00e1mpur; but the manager lives at Prat\u00e1ppur farther north, which village is virtually the capital of the State. It contains a court-house, jail, and school. Only two villages in Sarg\u00faja have a population of from 1000 to 2000 souls. The chief objects of interest are Ramgarh Hill, the remains of several temples, the deserted fortress of J\u00fab\u00e1, and numerous images. (For a full account of these antiquities and of the aboriginal tribes of Sarg\u00faja, see Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 231-240).\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The staple crops are cereals, oil-seeds, and cotton. On an average, the rent varies from 1s. 1\u00bdd. to 1s. 6d. per acre. Cesses, however, are levied, which equal, and sometimes exceed, the actual rent; and every cultivator is bound to work for his landlord fifteen days in the year, exclusive of the time spent in going to the work. This system of forced labour is at present the chief drawback to cultivation in Sarg\u00faja. The passes into the State are impracticable for wheeled traffic. The manufactures are pottery, coarse cloth, and rough ironwork. Weekly markets are held at Prat\u00e1ppur, Bisr\u00e1mpur, and Jhilmil\u00ed. Exports\u2014food grains, oil-seeds, ghi, lac, resin, and cocoons of tasar silk; imports\u2014brass and pewter vessels, ornaments, piece-goods, and salt.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The State yields its R\u00e1j\u00e1 an annual income of about \u00a33000, and pays a tribute to Government of \u00a3189, 3s. 4d. In 1877-78, when Sarg\u00faja was under the supervision of the Commissioner of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, the actual revenue was ascertained to be \u00a33199, and the expenditure \u00a32565. Police duties are performed by the principal feudal sub-proprietors, styled n\u00e1kad\u00e1rs, each being responsible for the public peace within his borders. Sarg\u00faja is divided into 11 police circles, three of which are kept up by the State.\n\nSarg\u00far.\u2014Town in Mysore District, Mysore.\u2014See Saragur.\n\nSarh Salimpur.\u2014Easternmost tahsil of Cawnpore District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a fertile plain, lying along the south bank of the Ganges, and traversed by the East Indian Railway. Area, 208 square miles, of which 129 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 99,303; land revenue, \u00a323,598; total Government revenue, \u00a325,958; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a337,065.\n\nSarila.\u2014One of the petty States of Bundelkhand under the political superintendence of the Bundelkhand Agency and the Central India Agency. It lies within pargan\u00e1 Jal\u00e1lpur of Ham\u00edrpur District, and is\nsurrounded on all sides by British territory. Area, 35 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 6000; estimated revenue, \u00a33000. On the division of his estates by Pahar Sinh, son of Jagatr\u00e1j, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaitpur, M\u00e1n Sinh, his second son, obtained Sarila. His successor, Tej Sinh, was expelled by Alf Bah\u00e1dur, but eventually recovered a portion of his territories through the assistance of Himmat Bah\u00e1dur. At the time of the British occupation of Bundelkhand, he was in possession of the fort and village of Sarila. In consideration of his voluntary submission and influence in the District, he was granted 11 villages by sanad in 1807. The present (1876) chief is R\u00e1j\u00e1 Khalak Sinh, during whose minority the State is managed by his mother. The military force of the State consists of 4 guns, 40 cavalry, and 200 infantry and police.\n\n**Sarishpur** (or Siddheswar).\u2014Hill range in the south of Assam, forming the boundary between C\u00e1char District on the east and Sylhet on the west. The height varies from 600 to 2000 feet above sea level.\n\n**Sarjapur.**\u2014Municipal village in Bangalore District, Mysore. Lat. 12\u00b0 52' N., long. 77\u00b0 49' 5\" E.; pop. (1871), 3051; municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a318; rate of taxation, \u00bdd. per head. Considerable manufacture of cotton cloth, carpets, and tape. Muslims of fine quality are no longer made. Weekly fair on Fridays.\n\n**Sarju.**\u2014River in the North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Gogra.\n\n**Sarmastipur.**\u2014Trading village in Darbhanga District, Bengal.\u2014See Somastipur.\n\n**S\u00e1r\u0144\u00e1th** (probably a corruption of S\u00e1ranggan\u00e1th, \u2018Lord of Deer,\u2019 referring to a legend of Buddha).\u2014Buddhist ruins in Benares District, North-Western Provinces, distant 3\u00bd miles north of Benares city; Sakya Muni first preached his doctrines here, and some of the ruins probably date from his time (543 B.C.). The remains form a mound of brick and stone d\u00e9bris about half a mile long by a quarter of a mile broad, out of which still emerge the remains of two great stupas, and a third is in the vicinity. The most remarkable, specially known as the Dhamek, is a solid dome 93 feet in diameter, and 110 feet above the plain. The plinth, 43 feet high, is of solid stone cramped with iron, and richly sculptured on the exterior. The upper part consists of dilapidated brickwork. The second stupa was excavated for bricks in 1794. The third, now called Chaukandi, is 800 yards south of Dhamek, and consists of a lofty ruined mound of brickwork, 74 feet in height, crowned by an octagonal building, commemorating the Emperor Humay\u00fan\u2019s visit in 1531. The remains of many other buildings have been excavated in the vicinity. The Dhamek tower probably is, if not the same, on the site of that erected by Asoka to mark the spot where Buddha first preached his doctrine. Thenameisa corrupt form of Dharma, \u2018The Law.\u2019 Both Dhamek and Chaukandi stupas appear to be mentioned by Hiouen Thsang. See also General Cunningham\u2019s *Anc. Geog. Ind.* pp. 437\u2013438 (ed. 1871).\nSaromannagar.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d; on the east by B\u00e1wan; on the south-east and south by the Sukheta river, which separates it from Barw\u00e1n; and on the west by the Gara river, separating it from P\u00e1li pargan\u00e1. Area, 35 square miles, of which 21 are cultivated; pop. (1869), 15,624, namely, 15,331 Hindus and 293 Muhammadans. Government land revenue, \u00a32229, equal to an average of 3s. 3\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 1s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Of the 42 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 20 are held by Sombans\u00eds, and 15 by Cham\u00e1r Gaurs. Thirty villages are held in imperfect pattid\u00e1ri and 12 in zamind\u00e1ri tenure. The country was originally occupied by Thatheras, who were driven out of many of their villages by Gaur R\u00e1jputs in the middle of the 12th century; and their total expulsion by the Sombans\u00eds occurred shortly afterwards. The pargan\u00e1 was first constituted in 1803 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Parsh\u00e1d of Muhamdi, out of villages previously belonging to the neighbouring pargan\u00e1s of P\u00e1li and S\u00e1r\u00e1.\n\nSaromannagar.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, and headquarters of Saromannagar pargan\u00e1; situated 6 miles south of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 15 miles north-west of Hardoi town. Pop. (1869), 1452, namely, 1303 Hindus and 149 Muhammadans. Village school. Bi-weekly market.\n\nS\u00e1rsa.\u2014Town in Kaira District, Bombay; situated 28 miles east by south of Kaira town, in lat. 22\u00b0 33' N., and long. 73\u00b0 7' E. Pop. (1872), 5218.\n\nSarsaganj.\u2014Trading village in M\u00e1inpuri District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 3' N., long. 78\u00b0 43' 50\" E.; pop. in 1872 (including Sarsa), 5496. Lies on the Et\u00e1wah road, 6 miles north of Bhadan station, East Indian Railway, and 27 miles south-west of M\u00e1inpuri town. The village of Sarsa (pop. 3922) is a mere agricultural hamlet, containing a large fortified brick house, belonging to a family of Kir\u00e1r Th\u00e1kurs; but the real importance of the place centres in the neighbouring b\u00e1z\u00e1r of Sarsaganj, the principal trading market of the District, and the only one which carries on business with surrounding towns. Fine marketplace, known as Raikes-ganj; bi-weekly fair; large trade in cotton. Wealthy merchants, chiefly Jains; several Jain temples; very handsome little mosque of peculiar architecture. Large cattle market. Police station, post office, village school. House tax in 1873-74 yielded a revenue of \u00a386.\n\nSarsawa.\u2014Ancient town in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 3433. Distant from Sah\u00e1ranpur town 10 miles west, upon the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) road. Small trade to and from the Punjab. Chiefly remarkable for its historical associations, being identified by General Cunningham with Sharwa or Sharash\u00e1raha, the city of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chand, sacked by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed in 1019 A.D. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 fled to the hills after the fall of his fort; but Mahm\u00fad followed up the\nfugitives, defeated them in the midst of a forest, and captured an enormous booty in gold, silver, precious stones, and slaves. Police station, post office, village school.\n\n**Sarsuti.** \u2014 River in the North-Western Provinces, Punjab.\u2014See Saraswati.\n\n**S\u00e1ru.** \u2014 The loftiest hill in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; situated in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, west of R\u00e1nch\u00ed town; 3615 feet in height. Lat. 23\u00b0 30' N., long. 84\u00b0 30' 45\" E.\n\n**Sarvepalli.** \u2014 Town in Nellore District, Madras. Lat. 14\u00b0 17' 30\" N., long. 80\u00b0 0' 40\" E.; pop. (1871), 5101, inhabiting 912 houses. Sarvepalli contains the ruins of an old Rohill\u00e1 fort and a fine stone tank.\n\n**Sarw\u00e1n.** \u2014 Village in Unao District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 36' N., and long. 80\u00b0 56' E., 6 miles north-east of Purw\u00e1, and 26 miles east of Unao town. Pop. (1869), 2183, viz. 2067 Hindus and 116 Musalm\u00e1ns. A very ancient village, with a noted Sivaite temple. Concerning this temple, Mr. C. A. Elliott narrates the following tradition in his *Chronicles of Unao*, pp. 5, 6:\u2014\u2018To worship at this temple, and to shoot and hunt in the wild forest country around, came R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dasaratha from Ajodhya, the father of R\u00e1mchandra, the 57th R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ajodhya. He was encamped at Sarw\u00e1ra on the edge of a tank. By night came Sarw\u00e1n, a holy Rishi from Chaunsa (near Ajodhya), by caste a Bania. He was going on pilgrimage, and was carrying his blind father and mother in a pair of baskets, slung over his shoulders. Reaching the tank, he put his burden down and stopped to drink. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dasaratha heard a rustling noise, and thinking it was some wild beast, took up his bow and shot an arrow, which struck Sarw\u00e1n, and he died. Then his blind parents in their misery lifted up their voices and cursed the man who had done the thing. They prayed that as he had slain the son who was the light of their hearts, so he might have trouble and sorrow from his own children, and might die of grief even as they were dying. Having so said, they gave up the ghost; and from that day to this no Kshattriya has lived in the town which is founded on the spot, and is called Sarw\u00e1n. Many have tried it, but evil has overtaken them in one way or another. The tank remains to this day, and by it lies under a tree the body of Sarw\u00e1n, a figure of stone; and as he died with his thirst unquenched, so if water is poured into the navel of the figure, the hole can never be filled up, but is inexhaustible in its demand.\u2019\n\n**Sary\u00e1.** \u2014 Indigo factory in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated 18 miles south-west of Muzaffarpur town, on the banks of the Bay\u00e1 river, which is here crossed by the Chhapr\u00e1 road on a fine three-arched bridge. A short distance from Sary\u00e1 is a monolith called Bh\u00edm Sinh\u2019s l\u00e1t\u00ed or club, supporting a lion carved in stone. It consists of a plain cylinder about 24 feet high, on the top of which is a pedestal with the lion. The cylinder is in one piece, the height of the whole being about 30 feet.\nIts depth below ground is unknown, but it must be very great, as some persons once dug down several feet, and failed to reach the foundation. The stone is covered with names, many of them English, some of which date from 1793. It stands in the courtyard of a Br\u00e1hman's house, but no religious meetings take place here. Close at hand is a well or deep excavation; and the Br\u00e1hman who owns the land on which the monolith stands affirms that a large amount of treasure is believed to lie concealed beneath, and that this excavation was made to try and recover it.\n\nS\u00e1sni (S\u00e1sani).\u2014Town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 42' 12\" N., long. 78\u00b0 8' 5\" E.; pop. (1802), 4208. Distant from Al\u00edgarh town 14 miles south on the Agra road, from H\u00e1thras 7 miles north. Steadily declining in importance. Remains of ancient fort, which held out under its rebel chief against Lord Lake in 1803, when it was captured not without considerable loss. Monuments in memory of the officers killed in the attack. Indigo factories, built from the materials of the fort. Police station, post office, encamping ground for troops.\n\nS\u00e1sser\u00e1m.\u2014Subdivision of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 31' and 25\u00b0 22' 30\" N. lat, and between 83\u00b0 33' and 84\u00b0 30' E. long. Area, 1757 square miles; villages, 1668; houses, 65,981. Pop.

Proportion of males in total population, 49.4 per cent.; persons per square mile, 253; villages per square mile, 0.95; persons per village, 266; houses per square mile, 38; persons per house, 6.7. This Subdivision consists of the 3 police circles of Dhangaon, Nokha, and S\u00e1sser\u00e1m. In 1870-71, it contained 3 magisterial and revenue courts, a regular police force of 176, and a village watch of 2115 men; the cost of Subdivisional administration was returned at \u00a36671.\n\nS\u00e1sser\u00e1m.\u2014Headquarters town of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m Subdivision, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 60 miles south of Arrah, in lat. 24\u00b0 56' 59\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 3' 7\" E. Pop. (1872), 21,023. Municipal revenue, \u00a3942, 6s.; rate of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head of population. The name S\u00e1sser\u00e1m or Sahsr\u00e1m signifies one thousand toys, because a certain Asur or infidel who lived here had a thousand arms, each holding a separate plaything. The town, now fast declining in importance, is noted as containing the tomb of the Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h, who conquered Hum\u00e1yun, and subsequently became Emperor of Delhi. His mausoleum is at the west end of the town, within a large tank, the excavated earth of which has been thrown into unshapely banks some distance off. The tomb itself consists of an octagonal hall surrounded by an arcade, which forms a gallery; the roof is supported by four gothic arches; the ornaments are in the very worst taste. (For full details respecting this monument, see Statistical Account\nof Bengal, vol. xii. pp. 205-208.) In 1872-73, the imports of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m were returned at \u00a319,855, the exports at \u00a36660.\n\nS\u00e1su.\u2014River in the south of Lakhimpur District, Assam, which rises in a marsh near the village of B\u00e1jaltali, and flowing south-west in a very circuitous course, empties itself into the Bur\u00ed Dihing near its junction with the Brahmaputra. During the rainy season, the S\u00e1su is navigable by canoes for about 200 miles.\n\nS\u00e1swad (Sasar).\u2014Chief town of the Purandhar Subdivision of Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay; situated on the left bank of the river K\u00e1rha 16 miles south-east of Poona city, in lat. 18\u00b0 20' 20\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 4' 20\" E. Pop. (1872), 6414. S\u00e1swad is a municipal town, with an annual income of \u00a3280. Post office and dispensary. Beyond the town, and across the river K\u00e1rha, there is an old palace of the Peshw\u00e1, now used for the Collector's office. Near the junction of the K\u00e1rha and one of its minor tributaries, is a walled building, the palace of the great Br\u00e1hman family Purandhare of Purandhar, whose fortunes for upwards of a century were so closely connected with those of the Peshw\u00e1s. This latter palace was formerly strongly fortified, and in 1818 was garrisoned and held out for ten days against a detachment of British troops.\n\nSata.\u2014Channel of the Indus in Sind. The most important eastern branch of the river, that to the west being known as the BAGHAR. The Sata sends off, on the left or eastern side, two branches, the Mal and the Matni, both of which are now only shallow streams. Before the great earthquake that occurred in Cutch (Kachchh) in 1819, vessels from seaward entered the Richal mouth, the only accessible entrance, and passed into the Haj\u00e1mro through what was then the Khedew\u00e1ri creek, and thence into the Mal to Sh\u00e1hbandar, an important naval station under the Kalhora princes. This passage was closed by the earthquake, and a new mouth opened, viz. the Kukaiw\u00e1ri, which in 1867 was found to be completely choked by sand. The Khedew\u00e1ri was described by Lieutenant Carless in 1837 as having a depth of from 16 to 18 feet, but since 1845 the Haj\u00e1mro had taken its place as the main channel.\n\nSatanones.\u2014One of the petty States in Undsarviya, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a395; of which \u00a310 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 12s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSatanw\u00e1ri.\u2014Fort in Bhop\u00e1l State, Central India; situated in lat. 23\u00b0 36' N., and long. 77\u00b0 10' E., 30 miles north-west of Bhop\u00e1l town, close to the Gwalior frontier. Satanw\u00e1ri appears, says Thornton, to have been granted with other possessions in 1818 by the British Government to the Naw\u00e1b of Bhop\u00e1l, 'in order to mark its approbation of his conduct, and to enable him to maintain the stipulated contingent.'\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\u2014A British District in the Deccan Division of the Bombay\nSATARA DISTRICT.\n\nPresidency, lying between 16\u00b0 51' and 18\u00b0 10' 30\" N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 37' and 74\u00b0 58' E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879, 5378 square miles; population in 1872, 1,116,050. It is bounded on the north by the States of Bhor and Phaltan, and the Nir river separating it from Poona; on the east by Sholapur District and the estates of the Panth Pratinidhi and the chief of J\u00e1t; on the south by the river V\u00e1rna, separating it from Kolhapur and Sangli States, and by a few villages of Belgaum District; and on the west by the Sahy\u00e1dri range of hills, separating it from the Konkan Districts of Kolaba and Ratnagiri. The administrative headquarters are at SATARA TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014From Mah\u00e1baleshwar in the north-west corner of the District, 4717 feet above the sea, start two hill ranges of equal height and nearly at right angles to each other\u2014one the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dri, running towards the south and forming the western boundary of the District, and the other the Mah\u00e1deo range of hills, which, going first in an easterly and then in a south-easterly direction, extends towards the eastern boundary, where it sinks gradually into the plain. These hills throw out numerous spurs over the District, forming the valleys of the several streams which make up the head-waters of the Kistna, one of the largest rivers in Western India. Except near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, and in the valley of the Koina, the hills of the District are very low, and have a strikingly bare and rugged aspect. The Mah\u00e1deo range, even in the rainy season, is but scantily covered with verdure. The hills are bold and abrupt, presenting in many cases bare scarps, of black rock, and looking at a distance like so many hill fortresses. They consist of trap, intersected by strata of basalt and topped with laterite. Of the different soils on the plains, the commonest is the black loamy clay containing carbonate of lime. This is a very fertile soil, and when well watered is capable of yielding heavy crops. Red clay is found near the foot of the hills. Besides many soils of a light and dark brown colour, white nodules of pure lime, and also light brown loam with a large proportion of lime, are often met with in the east. The water supply, especially in the western parts, is tolerably plentiful; but in the east, during the hot weather, there is great scarcity. The supply comes partly from rivers and partly from numerous ponds and wells. Almost all the rivers rising near Mah\u00e1baleshwar on the Sahy\u00e1dri range, or in the Mah\u00e1deo Hills, flow directly or indirectly into the Kistna. Some of these hold water only for a short time after the rains; but by throwing temporary dams across them and leading their water into canals, they are much utilized for irrigation. During the hot season, most of the ponds and wells become dry. The city of SATARA receives its supply through pipes from a reservoir on the Enteshwar Hill, built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1p Sinh. Scarcity of water is, how-\never, felt in the city during the hot season, and steps are being taken to increase the supply by improving some of the reservoirs. Irrigation works are in progress on the Kistna near Kar\u00e1d, on the Yerla at Khatg\u00e1on, on the Nira near M\u00e1lshiras, and on the M\u00e1n. At Kar\u00e1d, the irrigation dam has been completed, and a channel cut 32 miles in length on the left bank of the river.\n\nIron and copper ore, found in abundance on the Mah\u00e1baleshwar and Mah\u00e1deo Hills, were formerly worked by the Musalm\u00e1n tribe of Dh\u00e1vd\u00e1s. Owing, however, to the fall in the value of iron and the rise in the price of fuel, smelting is now no longer carried on.\n\nThe forests of the western Subdivisions have a large store of timber and firewood. J\u00e1mbul (Syzygium jambolanum), gela (Vangueria spinosa), and pesha (Cylicodaphne wightiana) grow on the main ridge of the Sahy\u00e1dris, and small teak on the eastern slopes. Sandal-wood is occasionally found, and the mango, jack, and guava are often grown for their fruit. Patches of bamboo sometimes occur. The cinchona plantation, established in Lingmala near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, has proved a failure.\n\nOf wild animals, tigers, bears, hy\u00e6nas, bison, wild boar, and s\u00e1mbhar deer are found only in the western hills, and hares and jackals throughout the District. The once famous breed of horses in the Nira valley has degenerated, and Government efforts to improve it have so far met with little success.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census returns of 1872 showed a total population of 1,116,050 persons living in 1428 towns and villages and in 142,687 houses. Density of population on Census area, 207\u00b752 per square mile; square miles per village, 3\u00b780; houses per square mile, 32\u00b708; persons per village, 781\u00b776; and persons per house, 6\u00b747. Classified according to sex, there were 567,398 males and 548,652 females; proportion of males, 50\u00b784 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 203,950, and females, 182,967; total children, 386,917, or 34\u00b766 per cent. Classified according to religion, 1,078,480, or 96\u00b763 per cent., were Hindus; 36,872, or 3\u00b730 per cent., Musalm\u00e1ns; 84 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; 600 Christians; and 14 \u2018others.\u2019 Of the Hindus, who form the great majority of the population, about two-thirds consist of Marhatt\u00e1s and Kumb\u00eds, who during the period of Marhatt\u00e1 ascendancy (1674-1817) furnished the bulk of the armies. The M\u00e1vl\u00e1s, Sivaji\u2019s best soldiers, were drawn from the gh\u00e1tm\u00e1tha (hill-top) portion of the District. During the last half-century, they have become quiet and orderly, living almost entirely by agriculture. Dark skinned and, as a rule, small, they are active and capable of enduring much fatigue. Br\u00e1hmans, employed as priests or Government servants, are found in large numbers in the towns of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and W\u00e1i. Besides these, V\u00e1nis, Dhangars, R\u00e1mosis, Mh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs are among the principal castes met with throughout the District.\nHistory.\u2014The history of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is the subject of an excellent monograph by Mr. W. W. Loch, of the Bombay Civil Service, and can only be summarized very briefly here. Early in the Christian era, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra formed part of the dominions of the great Saliv\u00e1hana, whose capital was at Paitan on the God\u00e1vari river. The Ch\u00e1lukya R\u00e1jputs next ruled the country, rising to their greatest power in the 10th century, and becoming extinct at the end of the 12th. The J\u00e1dhav R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d succeeded them for about a hundred years. The first Muhammadan invasion took place in 1294, and the J\u00e1dhav dynasty was overthrown in 1312. The Muhammadan power was then fairly established, and in 1345 the B\u00e1hmani dynasty rose to power. On the fall of the B\u00e1hmanis towards the end of the 15th century, each chief set up for himself; the Bij\u00e1pur kings finally asserted themselves; and under the Bij\u00e1pur kings the Marhatt\u00e1s arose. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, with the adjacent Districts of Poona and Shol\u00e1pur, formed the centre of the Marhatt\u00e1 power. The history of that power belongs to the general annals of India. Its founder, Sivaj\u00ed, commenced his career as a free-lance about the year 1644; and during the rest of the century, his family rapidly aggrandized itself at the expense both of the Bij\u00e1pur King and of the Delhi Emperor. The general decay of the Mughal Empire from 1700 to 1750 opened the way for the Marhatt\u00e1 supremacy. The Peshw\u00e1s, or Mayors of the Palace, date their power from Balaji, about 1718. In 1749, the sovereignty passed from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1j\u00e1s to the Br\u00e1hman Peshw\u00e1s, with their headquarters in the adjoining District of Poona. The descendants of Sivaj\u00ed became little more than pensioned prisoners, but they clung to the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The battle of P\u00e1nipat in 1761 broke the power of the Peshw\u00e1s and the great Marhatt\u00e1 confederacy. But the Peshw\u00e1 still remained the most important native ruler in India till the rise of Haidar \u00c1li. Repeated wars with the English ended in the final defeat of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s army at Ashti in 1818. His territory was thereupon annexed; but the English, with a politic generosity, freed the titular Marhatt\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 (the descendant of Sivaj\u00ed) from the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s control, and assigned to him the principality of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Captain Grant Duff was appointed his tutor until he should gain some experience in rule. In April 1822, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory was formally handed over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and thenceforward was managed by him entirely. After a time, he became impatient of the control exercised by the British Government; and as he persisted in intriguing and holding communications with other princes, in contravention of his treaty, he was deposed in 1839, and sent as a State prisoner to Benares, and his brother Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed was placed on the throne. This prince, who did much for the improvement of his people, died in 1848 without male heirs; and after long deliberation, it was decided that the State should be resumed by the British Government. Liberal pensions were granted to the\nR\u00e1j\u00e1's three widows, and they were allowed to live in the palace at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The survivor of these ladies died in 1874.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Agriculture, the main occupation of the people, supports 9,341,186 persons, or 83 per cent. of the entire population. The black soil, especially along the valley of the Kistna and its tributaries, is very fertile, yielding two crops a year. *J\u00f3dr* (Sorghum vulgare) and *b\u00e1jra* (Penicillaria spicata), the staple food of the people, occupy nearly half the cultivated area. Rice-fields are found only in the west, along river banks. In the south and east, cotton (Gossypium herbaceum) is grown, most of it of a local variety, but some brought from Hingangh\u00e1t. Near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, several European vegetables, especially potatoes, grow freely, and to a great extent supply the Bombay market. In some of the hill villages, which have a heavy rainfall, *nachni* (Eleusine corocana) and *vari* (Panicum miliare) are raised on the *kum\u00e1ri* system, that is, by cutting down and burning brushwood and sowing the seeds in the ashes. This practice, formerly general, has, on account of the damage it does to the forests, been to a large extent prohibited.\n\nIn 1877, 1,066,079 acres were under cultivation, of which 33,821 were twice cropped, and thus affect the percentages. Grain crops, consisting chiefly of *j\u00f3dr* and *b\u00e1jra*, occupied 893,851 acres, or 81\u00b727 per cent. of the cultivated area; pulses, 107,596 acres, or 9\u00b787 per cent.; oil-seeds, 42,976 acres, or 3\u00b790 per cent.; and miscellaneous crops occupied the remainder.\n\nIn March 1877, *j\u00f3dr*, the staple grain, sold at the rate of 22 lbs. the rupee (10s. 2d. per cwt.). At the same time, the daily wage of unskilled labour varied from 2\u00bdd. to 6d. (1\u00bd to 4 annas).\n\n**Commerce and Manufactures.**\u2014Besides *kamblis* (blankets) and coarse cotton cloth, the chief exports of the District are grain, tobacco, oil-seeds, chillies, molasses, and a little raw cotton. The imports are\u2014European piece-goods, hardware, paper, dried fruits, refined sugar, and salt. Weekly or bi-weekly markets are held in large villages and towns. Of these, Mhasvad is famous for its blankets, and Belandi for its cattle. Cotton is spun by women of the Kumbi, Mh\u00e1r, and M\u00e1ng castes. The yarn thus prepared is made up by Hindu weavers of the S\u00e1li or Koshti caste, and by Musalm\u00e1ns, into cloth, tape, and ropes. Blankets (*kamblis*), which command a large sale, are woven by men of the Sangar caste. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra brass dishes and Shirol lamps are well known throughout the District. Notwithstanding the great number of carpenters, wheels and axles for cart-making have to be brought from Chipl\u00fan in Ratn\u00e1giri. Paper from rags is still manufactured to some extent.\n\n**Means of Communication.**\u2014Of the several lines of road in the District, extending over a total length of 288 miles, the Poon\u00e1 and Belg\u00e1um road, crossing the District from north to south and bridged and metalled throughout, is the most important. One branch of this\nline breaks off at Kar\u00e1d, and runs along the valley of the Koina to Chipl\u00fan; while two other branches from Sur\u00fal and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, passing by the town of W\u00e1i, go in the direction of Mah\u00e1baleshwar and then towards Mah\u00e1d, a Konkan seaport. The old Poona road by the Salpa Pass is now almost abandoned. Of the other lines that cross the District from east to west, the chief are the Pandharpur road and the two T\u00e1sgaon lines, one from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and one from Kar\u00e1d. Along these and the Belg\u00e1um line, a large bullock-cart traffic passes. Within the limits of the District, the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills are crossed by thirteen roads or bullock tracks, of which the principal are the Kamatgi, Pasarni, Kumbh\u00e1rli, Var\u00e1ndha, and Fitzgerald. Besides houses for the use of District officers when on tour, village offices, ch\u00e1ud\u00eds, and temples, there are 243 dharms\u00e1l\u00e1s or rest-houses for the accommodation of travellers.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue raised in 1877 under all heads, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3237,092, showing on a population of 1,116,050 an incidence of 4s. 6d. per head. The land tax forms the principal source of revenue, amounting to \u00a3181,875, or 76 per cent. of the total amount. The other chief items are stamps, excise, forest, and local funds. The District local funds, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, yielded \u00a311,900. There are 13 municipalities, containing an aggregate population of 103,052 persons. Their aggregate receipts amounted in 1877-78 to \u00a36992, and the average incidence of taxation was about 2d. per head.\n\nThe administration of the District in revenue matters is, exclusive of the Superintendent of Malcolmpt, entrusted to a Collector and 6 Assistant Collectors, four of whom are covenanted civilians. For the settlement of civil disputes, there are 8 courts. The number of suits decided in 1874 amounted to 12,333. Thirty-nine officers share the administration of criminal justice. The total strength of the regular police force consisted in 1877 of 190 officers and 797 constables, giving 1 policeman to every 1073 persons of the population. The total cost was \u00a313,040, equal to \u00a32, 12s. per square mile of area and 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of convicted persons was 5245, being 1 person to every 214 of the population. There is one jail in the District. Compared with 114 schools and 1168 pupils in 1865, there were in 1877, 219 schools with a roll-call of 10,435 names, or, on an average, 1 school for every 6 villages. Three vernacular papers were published in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District in 1877-78.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014According to the height and distance from the sea, the climate varies in different parts of the District. In the east, especially in the months of April and May, the heat is considerable. But near the Gh\u00e1ts it is much more moderate, being tempered by the sea-breeze. Again, while few parts of Western India have a heavier and more con-\ntinuous rainfall than the western slope of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, in some of the eastern Subdivisions the supply is very scanty. The average annual rainfall at Mah\u00e1baleshwar is more than 200 inches, while in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town it is only 40 inches, and in some places farther east it is less than 12. The west of the District draws almost its whole rain supply from the south-west monsoon, between June and October. Some of the eastern Subdivisions have, however, a share in the north-east monsoon, and rain falls there in November and December. The May or 'mango showers,' as they are called, also influence the cultivator's prospects.\n\nSeven dispensaries and 2 civil hospitals, one at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the other at Malcolmpet, afforded medical relief to 942 in-door and 33,887 outdoor patients in 1877-78, and 31,176 persons were vaccinated. Vital statistics showed a death-rate of 22.4 per thousand in 1876-77.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\u2014Chief town and headquarters of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 41' 25\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 2' 10\" E., 56 miles south of Poona, near the confluence of the Kistna and the Yena, in the highlands of the Deccan, where the country generally inclines towards the east. The strong fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, midway between the Kistna and the Tornaghat, is perched on the summit of a small, steep, rocky hill. It takes its name from the seventeen walls, towers, and gates which it possessed, or is supposed to have possessed. At the close of the war with the Peshw\u00e1, in 1818, it fell, after a short resistance, into the hands of the British, who restored it with the adjacent territory to the representative of Sivaji's line, who, during the Peshw\u00e1's ascendency, had lived there as a State prisoner under the name of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1848, on the death of the last R\u00e1j\u00e1, the principality reverted to the British. The town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, lying at the foot of the hill fortress, consisted in 1820 of one long street of tiled houses, built partly of stone and partly of brick. After the breaking up of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's court, the population considerably decreased. But S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is still a large place, with a population, in 1872, of 24,484. Besides the courts of the Subdivisional and District revenue officers, it possesses a District Judge's Court and a High School. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace is plain and commonplace. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra has few large or ornamental buildings, but the town is clean and the streets broad. On account of its high position and its exposure to the sea-breeze, the climate is unusually pleasant. The water supply is drawn by pipes from a reservoir on the hill of Enteshwar.\n\nSat\u00e1sgarh (or 'Sixty Towers').\u2014Ruin in Panduah Town, Maldah District, Bengal. See Panduah.\n\nS\u00e1tgaon (or Saptagr\u00e1m, 'The Seven Villages,' so called from seven sages who gave their names to the same number of villages).\u2014Ruined town in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 38' 20\" N., long. 88\u00b0 25' 10\" E. The mercantile capital of Bengal from the Pur\u00e1nic age until the founda-\ntion of HUGLI by the Portuguese. The decay of this port dates from\nthe silting up of the channel of the SARASWATI, and nothing now remains\nto indicate its former grandeur except a ruined mosque; the modern\nvillage consists of a few miserable huts. S\u00e1tg\u00e1on is said to have been\none of the resting places of Bh\u00e1g\u00edratha. De Barros writes that it was\n\u2018less frequented than Chittagong, on account of the port not being so\nconvenient for the entrance and departure of ships.\u2019 Purchas states it to\nbe \u2018a fair citie for a citie of the Moores, and very plentiful, but some-\ntimes subject to Patnaw.\u2019 In 1632, when H\u00fagli was declared a royal\nport, all the public officers were withdrawn from S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, which rapidly\nfell into ruins.\u2014For a full description of the ancient S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, see\nStatistical Account of Bengal, vol. iii. pp. 307-310.\n\nS\u00e1thamba.\u2014State in Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay.\u2014See SUTHUMBA.\n\nS\u00e1than.\u2014Town in R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; pleasantly situated\non high ground overlooking the Gumti river, 40 miles north-west of\nSult\u00e1npur. Founded by S\u00e1than, a Bhar, and called after him. After\nthe Mutiny of 1857, a certain Sh\u00e1h Abdul Lat\u00edf settled here as a\n\u2018missionary of pure religion,\u2019 and built a mosque, at which hundreds of\nthe Sunni sect assemble every Friday.

He is thirty years of age, and manages his estate in person. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a3450; and pays a tribute of \u00a3168 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a373 to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Edar. The family of the chief follow the rule of primogeniture in point of succession. There is 1 school in the State, with 43 pupils.\n\n**Satodar W\u00e1ori.\u2014One of the petty States of H\u00e1ll\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 4 villages, with 4 independent tribute-payers.** Estimated revenue (1876), \u00a31200; of which \u00a3146 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a346 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**S\u00e1tp\u00e1ti.\u2014Port in Th\u00e1na (Tanna) District, Bombay.** Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1873-74\u2014imports, \u00a3852, and exports, \u00a34253.\n\n**S\u00e1tpura.\u2014Hill range or tableland, which begins at Amarkantak and extends westward across the Central Provinces, and beyond them nearly to the western coast.** The name was formerly restricted to that portion of the range which divides the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and T\u00e1pti valleys; while sometimes the term Vindhy\u00e1 has been extended to include the S\u00e1tpuras, together with the parallel range on the northern side of the Narbad\u00e1, in one general appellation for the great chain which stretches across Central India and separates Hindust\u00e1n proper from the Deccan. Geologically, however, the Vindhya sandstones are entirely distinct from the Mah\u00e1deo and other groups which enter into the composition of the S\u00e1tpuras; and geographically, the line of demarcation between the two ranges is defined by the well-marked valley of a great river. Taking Amarkantak as the eastern boundary, the S\u00e1tpuras stretch from east to west for about 600 miles, while their greatest breadth from north to south exceeds 100 miles. The range forms a rough triangle. From Amarkantak, 3328 feet above sea level, an outer ridge runs south-west for about 100 miles to the Saletekri Hills in Bhand\u00e1ra District. This ridge, known as the Maikal range, constitutes the base of the triangle. Starting from this base, the S\u00e1tpura range shrinks, as it proceeds westward, from a broad tableland to two parallel dorsal ridges, bounding on either side the valley of the T\u00e1pti. Just east of As\u00edrgarh occurs a break, through which the railway from Bombay and Kh\u00e1ndesh to Jabalpur is carried; and As\u00edrgarh marks the point where the S\u00e1tpuras leave the Central Provinces. Following the range from east to west in Mandla District, the slope is mainly northward towards the Narbad\u00e1.\nThere are four principal upland valleys, each sending down a feeder to that river. The eastern valleys are higher than those to the west. Between the Kharmer and Burhner rivers, the country consists of a rugged mass of bare and lofty mountains hurled together by volcanic action. Their general formation is basaltic, intermixed with laterite, with which the higher peaks are capped. The Chaur\u00e1d\u00e1dar plateau, 3300 feet high, has an area of 6 square miles. In Seoni District, the plateaux of Seoni and Lakhn\u00e1don are from 1800 to 2220 feet high. The slope of the country is from north to south; and in the lowest watershed, the Waingang\u00e1 river rises. In Chhindw\u00e1ra, also, the country slopes southwards. The principal upland valleys are those of the Pench and Kolbir\u00e1. The general elevation is about 2200 feet, but the plateau of Mot\u00far attains a height of 3500 feet. In Bet\u00fal, the slope to the south continues; and the T\u00e1pti rises and flows in a deep and narrow gorge. In the south-west corner of the District, the hill of Kh\u00e1m\u00ed rises 3700 feet high. To the north of Bet\u00fal, spurs from the S\u00e1tpuras occupy a considerable portion of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. Dh\u00fapgarh (4454 feet) is the highest point; and the picturesque plateau of Pachmarh\u00ed, 3481 feet above sea level, covers an area of 12 square miles. South of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, sandstone and metamorphic rocks emerge, and form a great portion of the hills of the Bet\u00fal and Pachmarh\u00ed country. To the east, trap predominates. In Nim\u00e1r District, the wild and barren range which parts the valleys of the T\u00e1pti and the Narbad\u00e1 has an average width of 15 miles. On its highest point stands the fortress of As\u00edrgarh.\n\n**S\u00e1tpura.**\u2014State forest lying along the southern slopes of the S\u00e1tpura Hills, in Seoni, Chhindw\u00e1ra and N\u00e1gpur Districts, Central Provinces. Area, about 1000 square miles. S\u00e1j forms the chief growth in the eastern, and teak in the western portion. The proximity of K\u00e1mthi (Kamptee) and N\u00e1gpur has caused the exhaustion of all but young timber; but what remains is now strictly preserved, and plantation experiments have been conducted at Suk\u00e1ta and Sit\u00e1jhari.\n\n**Satrikh.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Naw\u00e1bganj and Part\u00e1bgarh, on the east by Siddhaur, on the south by Haidargarh, and on the west by Dewa. Area, 46 square miles or 29,404 acres, of which 19,318 acres are cultivated; pop. (1869), 24,157, viz. 21,694 Hindus and 2463 Muhammadans. Of the 42 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 17 are held in t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 20 in samin-d\u00e1ri, and 5 in pattid\u00e1ri tenure. Government land revenue, \u00a34798.\n\n**Satrikh.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh, and headquarters of Satrikh pargan\u00e1; situated 5 miles south-east of B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki town, in lat. 26\u00b0 51' 30\" N., and long. 81\u00b0 14' 10\" E. Pop. (1869), 3584, viz. 2177 Hindus and 1407 Muhammadans. The town was originally founded by a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 named Sabtrikh, but was captured by the Muhammadans under S\u00e1l\u00e1r Sahu, a brother-in-law of Mahm\u00fad of\nGhazn\u012b. S\u00e1l\u00e1r Sahu died here, and an annual fair is held at his shrine, attended by about 18,000 persons.\n\nSatrunjaya (Shetrunj\u0101).\u2014Sacred hill near P\u00e1lit\u0101na in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay.\u2014See Palitana Town.\n\nS\u00e1tur.\u2014Very old samind\u00e1ri village in Tinnevelly District, Madras. Lat. 9\u00b0 26' N., long. 77\u00b0 31' 20\" E.; pop. (1871), 7155, inhabiting 1532 houses. A station on the South Indian Railway.\n\nSatyamangalam.\u2014Fortified town in Coimbatore District, Madras. Lat. 11\u00b0 30' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 17' 15\" E.; pop. (1871), 3412, inhabiting 645 houses. The fort is situated on the Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed river, and was built by the N\u00e1iks of Madura. It was taken by the Mysore (Maisur) generals in 1657. Owing to its situation commanding the fords at the foot of the Gazzalh\u00e1thi Pass, Satyamangalam was of considerable strategic importance in our wars with Haidar \u00c1lf and Tip\u00fa. Colonel Wood took the place in 1768, but Haidar recaptured it the following year. In 1790, Colonel Floyd occupied Satyamangalam, and between the fort and Danayakkankottai fought a severe battle with Tip\u00fa in the same year, falling back upon Meadow's column, but effecting his retreat with such skill as almost to convert it into a victory. There are two Gh\u00e1t roads to the uplands from Satyamangalam\u2014the Gazzalh\u00e1thi and the Hassan\u00far roads. The latter is the most frequented route into Mysore.\n\nSangor.\u2014District, Subdivision, and Town, in the Central Provinces.\u2014See Sagar.\n\nSangor.\u2014Island at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, Bengal. See Sagar.\n\nSaundatti.\u2014Chief town of the Parasgad Subdivision of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay; situated 41 miles east by south of Belg\u00e1um town, in lat. 15\u00b0 45' 50\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 9' 40\" E. Pop. (1872), 8180. About 2 miles due south of Saundatti are the ruins of an extensive hill fort called Parasgad, from which the whole Subdivision derives its name. Sub-judge's court and dispensary. About 5\u00bd miles north-west of Saundatti, a large Hindu fair in honour of the goddess Yellama is held twice a year about the full moon in April or May and in November or December. On each occasion, from 15,000 to 20,000 persons attend.\n\nSaur\u00e1th.\u2014Village in Darbhanga District, Bengal; 8 miles west of Madhuban\u00ed. Famous for the large mel\u00e1 (religious fair) which takes place annually in June or July, when vast numbers of Br\u00e1hmans assemble to settle their children's marriages. Saur\u00e1th contains a temple of Mah\u00e1deo, built about 1845 by the Darbhanga R\u00e1j\u00e1; close to this building is a tank, shaded by a fine mango grove, under which people buy and sell during the mel\u00e1. At other times the place is deserted.\nSaus\u00e1r.\u2014The southern tahsil or Subdivision of Chhindw\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces. Area, 1088 square miles; pop. (1872), 99,510, residing in 359 villages or townships and 20,106 houses.\n\nSaus\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Chhindw\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 40' N., and long. 78\u00b0 50' E., 34 miles south of Chhindw\u00e1ra town, on the main road to N\u00e1gpur. Estimated pop. 4077, chiefly agricultural. Saus\u00e1r has a Government school, and a small fort; the proprietor is the representative of the Gond dynasty of Deogarh.\n\nSavan\u00far (Sawan\u00far).\u2014Native State, situated within Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay; lying between 14\u00b0 56' 45\" and 15\u00b0 1' 45\" N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 21' 45\" and 75\u00b0 25' E. long. Area, 66 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 17,288; estimated gross revenue, \u00a37327. The principal products are cotton, jodr, rice, kulthi, m\u00fang, cocoa-nut, castor-oil seed, tur, p\u00e1n, and sugar-cane. The reigning family are Muhammadans of Afgh\u00e1n descent. Abdul Ra\u00faf Kh\u00e1n, the founder of the family, obtained in 1680 from the Emperor Aurangzeb the grant of the j\u00e1g\u00edr of Bank\u00e1pur, Torgal, and Az\u00edmnagar, with a command of 7000 horse. The family, though connected by marriage with Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, was entirely stript of its possessions by him, and the Naw\u00e1b sought the protection of the Peshw\u00e1, from whom he received a pension of \u00a34800 per annum. This was subsequently converted into a grant of territory, yielding an equal amount of revenue, through the intervention of General Wellesley. The present Naw\u00e1b of Savan\u00far is Abdul Dalil Kh\u00e1n, who was born about 1860.\n\nSavan\u00far.\u2014Chief town of Savan\u00far State, Bombay. Lat. 14\u00b0 58' N., long. 75\u00b0 23' 5\" N.; pop. (1872), 8686.\n\nSavandrug.\u2014Hill fort in Bangalore District, Mysore, locally known as the Magadi Hill, 4024 feet above sea level. Lat. 12\u00b0 55' N., long. 77\u00b0 21' E. It consists of an enormous mass of granite, standing on a base 8 miles in circumference. The summit is divided by a chasm into two peaks\u2014the Kari or black, and the Bili or white\u2014each of which is abundantly supplied with water. The first fortifications are said to have been erected in 1543, by S\u00e1manta R\u00e1ya, who gave the hill his own name of S\u00e1manta-durga. The present appellation dates from the end of the 16th century, when Immadi Kempe Gauda of Bangalore established his stronghold here, in which his family maintained themselves until 1728. The fort was captured in that year by the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore, from whom it passed into the hands of Haidar Ali. In 1791, Savandrug was stormed by a British army commanded by Lord Cornwallis. On December 10, a force under Colonel Stuart encamped within 3 miles of the place; and after great difficulties in bringing up the battering train, the bombardment was opened on the 20th, and in three days the breach was declared practicable.\nassault was delivered on the following day at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, under the eyes of Lord Cornwallis. The whole line of fortifications was carried within an hour, without the loss of a single life on the British side.\n\n**Savari (Seberi, Severi).**\u2014River in Central India.\u2014See SABARI.\n\n**S\u00e1vda.**\u2014Chief town of the S\u00e1vda Subdivision of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay, and a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 285 miles north-east of Bombay city; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 8' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 56' E. Pop. (1872), 7552. S\u00e1vda was finally ceded by the Niz\u00e1m to the Peshw\u00e1 in 1763, and was shortly afterwards bestowed on Sard\u00e1r R\u00e1ste, whose daughter was given in marriage to the Peshw\u00e1. Chief trade, cotton, gram, linseed, and wheat. Post office.\n\n**S\u00e1vitri (Savatri).**\u2014River of Bombay, rising on the western declivity of the Mah\u00e1baleshwar range, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, in lat. 18\u00b0 28' N., and long. 73\u00b0 30' E. It flows west past the town of Mhar, and falls into the Arabian Sea in lat. 17\u00b0 58' N., and long. 73\u00b0 3' E. Thornton gives the total length of the river at about 70 miles, and says 'it is navigable as far as Mhar, 30 miles from its mouth, and was formerly accessible at all times by large ships; but, a sandbank at the mouth constantly increasing during the south-west monsoon, its facilities for navigation are greatly diminished. The bar has 10 feet of water at low tide, and 21 at high water, spring tides; and ships may anchor inside in 5 fathoms.'\n\n**S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri.**\u2014Native State in Bombay, under the charge of a Political Superintendent; situated about 200 miles south of Bombay city, between 15\u00b0 38' 30\" and 16\u00b0 14' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 37' and 74\u00b0 23' E. long. Area, about 900 square miles; pop. (1872), 190,814. The State is bounded on the north and west by the British District of Ratn\u00e1giri, on the east by the Sahy\u00e1dri Mountains, and on the south by the Portuguese territory of Goa. The general aspect of the country is strikingly picturesque. From the sea-coast to the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, a distance varying from 20 to 25 miles, are densely wooded hills, and in the valleys, gardens and groves of cocoa-nut and betel-nut palms. The chief streams are the K\u00e1rli on the north, and the Terekhol on the south. Both are navigable for small native craft; the Terekhol for about 12, and the Karli for about 15 miles. The climate is humid and relaxing, with a heavy rainfall, averaging for the ten years ending 1872, 133\u00bd inches. April is the hottest month in the year, for in May\u2014though the temperature is slightly higher\u2014a strong sea-breeze, the precursor of the south-west monsoon, tempers the heat. Especially near the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, the State is rich in forests of teak, blackwood, ain (Terminalia glabra), kher (Acacia catechu), j\u00e1mba (Mimosa xylocaspa). Nearer the sea, the more important trees are the jackwood, mango, and bhirand, whose fruit yields kokam oil. The\nprincipal fruits are mangoes and plantains, which are abundant and of excellent quality, citrons, limes, and jack fruit. Cocoa-nuts and cashew-nuts are very plentiful. The staple agricultural produce is rice; but the quantity grown is not sufficient for the wants of the people, and a good deal is imported. Excepting rice, none but the coarsest grains and pulses are raised. A species of oil-seed, *hl* (Sesamum orientale), hemp, and black and red pepper, are also grown, but neither cotton nor tobacco. Both soil and climate are against the cultivation of wheat and other superior grains. For these, the people have to look to the country east of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, whence during the fair season, from October to June, large supplies come. Coffee has been grown with success, and it is believed that the spurs from the Sahy\u00e1dri range are suited to its cultivation on a large scale. Iron-ore of fair quality is found in the neighbourhood of the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t, in the Sahy\u00e1dri range. The forests and wooded slopes of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills contain large numbers of tigers, leopards, bison, *s\u00e1mbhar* deer, etc.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Of the total population, in 1872, of 190,814 persons, 182,688 were Hindus, 4152 Muhammadans, and 3954 Christians. The last are all Roman Catholics, and consist of Indo-Portuguese and natives who have embraced Christianity. The common language of the people is a dialect of Marathi, known as Kurauli. The sturdy and easily managed Marhatt\u00e1s and Mhars of this State are favourite recruits for the Bombay Native Infantry regiments. The inhabitants generally are poor, and are engaged chiefly in agriculture.\n\n**Manufactures.**\u2014Salt of an inferior kind is manufactured, but the quantity is small and scarcely suffices for the wants of the people. The principal industries of the State consist of gold and silver embroidery work on both leather and cloth; fans, baskets, and boxes of *khaskhas* grass, ornamented with gold thread and beetles' wings; lacquered toys, and playing cards; and elegant drawing-room ornaments carved from the horn of the buffalo and bison.\n\n**Means of Communication.**\u2014There are no railways; but an excellent trunk road has recently been constructed from the seaport of Vingorla, which, passing through the State, leads by an easy gradient over the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills to Belg\u00e1um and the Southern Marhatt\u00e1 Country. The other chief lines of communication with the Deccan are the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t, the Talgh\u00e1t, and the Phond\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\n**Trade.**\u2014Within the limits of the State there is not much local trade; but during the fair season, a considerable quantity of cotton, hemp, and grain from the rich Districts of the Southern Marhatt\u00e1 Country passes coastwards, especially to the port of Vingorla. Compared with the exports, the imports at Vingorla are small.\n\n**History.**\u2014About three hundred years ago, one Mang S\u00e1want of the Bhonsl\u00e1 family, whose headquarters were at the village of Hodw\u00e1ra,\nabout 6 miles from W\u00e1ri, stoutly held his own against the Muhammadan power then established at Bij\u00e1pur. After his death, the country was subjugated by the Muhammadans, and Mang's successors are supposed to have become feudatories of the Bij\u00e1pur kings. The chief who freed his country from the Muhammadan yoke and established its independence was Khem S\u00e1want Bhonsl\u00e1, who ruled from 1675 to 1709, and was a contemporary of Sh\u00e1hu, the grandson and successor of Sivaj\u00ed, the founder of the Marhatt\u00e1 power. Sh\u00e1hu assigned to him, conjointly with the chief of Kol\u00e1ba, half the revenue of the S\u00e1lsi Mah\u00e1l. It was during the time of Khem's successor (1709-1737) that the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri State first entered into relations with the British Government. A treaty was concluded between them against the notorious piratical chief, Kanoj\u00ed Angria of Kol\u00e1ba. The chief who ruled from 1755 to 1803, under the name of Khem S\u00e1want the Great, married in 1763 the daughter of J\u00e1yaj\u00ed Sindhia; and consequently the title of R\u00e1\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur was conferred upon him by the Emperor of Delhi. The chieftain of Kolh\u00e1pur, envious of this honour, made a descent on W\u00e1ri, and captured several hill fortresses, which were, however, through Sindhia's influence, subsequently restored. The rule of Khem S\u00e1want, who, not content with wars on land, also took to piracy, was one long contest against Kolh\u00e1pur, the Peshw\u00e1, the Portuguese, and the British. Khem S\u00e1want died childless in 1803; and the contest for the succession was not decided till 1805, when Khem S\u00e1want's widow, Lakshmi\u00e1b\u00ed, adopted a child, R\u00e1mchandra S\u00e1want alias Bh\u00e1u S\u00e1hib. This child lived for three years, and was then (1805) strangled in bed. Phond S\u00e1want, a minor chosen to fill his place, died in 1812, and was succeeded by his son, Khem S\u00e1want, a child of eight years. This chief, when he came of age, proved unable to manage his estate, and after several revolutions and much disturbance, at last in 1838 agreed to make over the administration to the British Government. After this, rebellion twice broke out (in 1839 and 1844), but the disturbances were soon suppressed, and the country has since remained quiet. The present (1876-77) chief is Sar-Des\u00e1i Raghn\u00e1th S\u00e1want Bhonsl\u00e1. He is a minor of fifteen, and is under tuition at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a330,000, and maintains a military force of 436 men, styled the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri Local Corps. The family of the chief hold a title authorizing adoption, and in point of succession follow the rule of primogeniture. There are 36 schools in the State, with a total of 1819 pupils.\n\nS\u00e1yla.\u2014Native State in the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; comprising 38 villages. Pop. (1872), 16,528. The climate is hot and dry, but healthy. Cotton is the chief produce; the usual grains are also grown. Dyeing is the only industry of consequence. The nearest\nport is Dholera. S\u00e1yla ranks officially as a 'third-class' State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war; and the ruler executed the usual engagements in 1807. The present chief (1876-77), Th\u00e1kur Kesri Sinhji, a Hindu of the Jh\u00e1la R\u00e1jput caste, is fifty-four years old, and administers his estate in person. He enjoys an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a36000, and pays a tribute of \u00a31551 jointly to the British Government and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. The family of the chief follow the rule of primogeniture in point of succession. There are 2 schools in the State, with a total of 201 pupils.\n\nS\u00e1yla.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1yla State, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 32' N., and long. 71\u00b0 32' E. Pop. (1872), 6623.\n\nSayyid\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in the fertile Do\u00e1b portion of the District. Area, 180 square miles, of which 150 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 108,305; land revenue, \u00a328,681; total Government revenue, \u00a331,552; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a341,408.\n\nSayyidnagar.\u2014Old and decayed town in Jal\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 2980. Distant from Ur\u00e1i 17 miles south-west, among the ravines of the Betwa. Large exports of cloth, dyed red and yellow; considerable manufacture and dyeing of cotton. Police station; school.

Government charitable dispensary. Chiefly noticeable for its numerous remains of Hindu or Buddhist origin, including a flat-roofed, richly carved, massive stone building, besides several fragments and entire figures of ancient sculpture. At Bhitri, 5 miles north-east of the town, stands a sandstone monolith, 28 feet in height, of which 5 or 6 feet are buried beneath the ground. It bears an inscription recording the achievements of five kings of the Gupta dynasty. A bridge of three arches,\nbuilt by the Muhammadans out of stones from Hindu structures, spans a small river.\n\n**Sayyidpur.**\u2014T\u00e1luk of the Rohri Deputy Collectorate, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind.

Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment is the largest military station in India, and forms the headquarters of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Subsidiary Force, which constitutes a Division of the Madras army. The military force stationed here in April 1880 consisted of one regiment of European and another of Native Cavalry, one battery of Royal Horse Artillery, three batteries of Royal Artillery (field and garrison), two regiments of British and three of Native Infantry, with a company of Sappers and Miners. An Ordnance Establishment has charge of the Arsenal, and there is also a large Commissariat Staff. This force is maintained by the British Government, under the terms of a treaty with the Niz\u00e1m dated 21st May 1853, in lieu of certain contingent and auxiliary forces which had been previously raised by the Niz\u00e1m to co-operate with the British army, but had proved inefficient. The cost of the force is defrayed out of the revenues of certain Districts ceded by the Niz\u00e1m under the treaty of May 1853, revised by a second treaty in 1860. (See Haidarabad State.) Up to the year 1850, the cantonment of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d consisted of a line of barracks and huts, extending for a distance of 3 miles from east to west, with the artillery in the front and on the left flank, and the infantry on the right. Since that date, however, the cantonment boundaries have been extended as far as Bolaram, covering a total area of 19 square miles, including many interspersed villages. New double-storied barracks have been erected for the European soldiers, and the quarters for the Native troops, which are situated at some distance, are also comfortably built. The country for many miles around undulates into hummocks, with a few outcrops of underlying rock, crossed from east to west by greenstone dikes. East of\nthe cantonment are two large outbursts of granite; in the north-east is a granite hill known as M\u00fal Al\u00ed, and near it another called Kadam Ras\u00fal, from a legend that it bears an impress of Muhammad's foot. Shady trees line the roads of the cantonment, and near the European barracks and Native lines are clusters of date and palmyra palms. Otherwise the face of the country is bare, with but little depth of soil in the elevated parts. Cultivation is carried on in the dips and valleys, in several of which tanks have been constructed. The water supply from wells is not abundant. Immediately to the south-west of the cantonment is a large artificial reservoir or tank, known as the Hus\u00e1in S\u00e1g\u00e1r, about 3 miles in circumference. Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d town, which forms the cantonment b\u00e1z\u00e1r, contains about 8000 houses (7938 in 1866), and a population, calculated at 4 persons per house, of about 32,000, all engaged in business as shopkeepers, petty traders, or artisans. The Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Subsidiary Force is not the sole military body in the neighbourhood. Adjoining the Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment to the north is the Bol\u00e1ram cantonment, one of the stations of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d contingent under the immediate authority of His Highness the Niz\u00e1m. The force stationed here consists of one regiment of cavalry, one of infantry, and a battery of artillery. Again, about 2 miles south of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment, are the lines of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Reformed Troops, also belonging to the Niz\u00e1m, comprising artillery, cavalry, and infantry, under the command of a European officer. Altogether, within a space of 10 miles from north to south, about 8000 disciplined soldiers are cantoned. During the Mutiny of 1857, an unsuccessful attempt was made to tamper with the fidelity of the troops at Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d. An attack on the British Residency was repulsed; and during the troubled times of 1857-58 much good service was rendered by both the Subsidiary Force and the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d contingent. In the rainy season, especially towards its close, the climate of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d and its neighbourhood is unhealthy, both for Europeans and natives. The rainfall varies greatly; during the thirty years 1841-70 it averaged 27 inches, the range being from 13 to 43 inches. The prevalent diseases are fevers, dysentery, and rheumatism.\n\n**Seebsaugor.**\u2014District, Subdivision, and town in Assam. \u2014 See SIBSAGAR.\n\n**Segauli.**\u2014Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated 15 miles from Moth\u00e1ri, on the Bettij\u00e1 road, in lat. 26\u00b0 46' 41\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 47' 51\" E. A military station, and ordinarily occupied by a regiment of Native cavalry. An embankment protects the cantonment from inundation by the Sihkhren\u00e1 river, which flows a little distance to the north. In 1857, the main body of the 12th Regiment of Irregular Horse stationed here broke into open mutiny, and murdered their commanding officer; though a detachment did good service during the\nsubsequent operations in Oudh.\u2014(See Sir J. W. Kaye's History of the Sepoy War, vol. iii. pp. 102-107.)\n\nSeghur (Sigur) Gh\u00e1t.\u2014Mountain pass in the Nilgiri Hills, Madras, running down the north face of the hills from Mutin\u00e1d to near the village of Seghur. Lat. 11\u00b0 29' to 11\u00b0 31' 40\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 43' 30\" to 76\u00b0 43' 35\" E. Being practicable for laden carts and other wheeled conveyances, it is the most frequented of all the Nilgiri gh\u00e1ts. 'By this pass,' says Pharoah, 'communication is kept up with Bangalore, Madras, and all places to the northward; and the chief bulk of European supplies, heavy baggage, horse gram, rice, etc., comes to the settlement by it. It also affords the means of transit for the teak timber used on the hills in the form of rafters, planks, etc.; the road passes near the forests where the trees are cut.' The corrected spelling is Sigur.\n\nSehore.\u2014Town in Bhop\u00e1l State, Central India; situated on the right bank of the Saven, in lat. 23\u00b0 11' 55\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 7' 14\" E., on the route from Sag\u00e1r (Saugor) to As\u00edrgarh, 132 miles south-west of the former place, and 152 north-east of the latter; distant from Bhop\u00e1l city 22 miles south-west. Manufacture of printed muslins, Good b\u00e1z\u00e1r.\n\nSehw\u00e1n.\u2014Sub-District of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, lying between 25\u00b0 13' and 26\u00b0 56' N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 10' and 68\u00b0 29' E. long. Area, 3646 square miles; pop. (1872), 162,836 souls. Bounded north by Mehar, a Subdivision of Shik\u00e1pur; east by the Indus; south by the Jerruck (Jhirak) Subdivision of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District; and west by the Khirthar and Pab Mountains. The administrative headquarters are at Kotri Town.\n\nThe Sub-District of Sehw\u00e1n differs from the rest of Sind in being more hilly. It contains the only large lake in the Province, viz. the Manchhar (Manchur). The chief hills are the Laki range, an offshoot from the Khirthar Mountains; and the Jatil Hills. There are 37 Government canals in Sehw\u00e1n, the principal being the Western Nara, the Aral, the Phito, and the Karo. The Sub-District contains several hot springs. Game and fish of all kinds are abundant. The Government forests cover an area of 24,474 acres, and yielded in 1873-74 a revenue of \u00a33185. The population of Sehw\u00e1n in 1872 numbered 162,836, of whom 139,158 were Muhammadans, 23,191 Hindus, and 387 'others.' The principal antiquities are the forts of Sehw\u00e1n and R\u00e1n\u00ed-ka-kot. (See Sann.)\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The D\u00e1d\u00fa and Sehw\u00e1n taluks contain perhaps the finest wheat lands in the whole of Sind. Much cultivation is carried on in the neighbourhood of the Manchhar Lake, after the subsidence of the annual inundation. The principal crops of the Sub-District are wheat, jodr, cotton, barley, pulse, oil-seeds, and vegetables. The prevailing tenure is the samind\u00e1ri; about one-twelfth of the whole area of Sehw\u00e1n\nis held in j\u00e1g\u00edr, or revenue-free. There is a large transit trade in wool, cotton, dried fruits, etc. (See KARACHI TOWN.) The local traffic consists of fish, mats, cloths, oil, ghi, and grain. The principal manufactures comprise carpets, coarse cotton cloth, rugs, and mats. The aggregate length of roads in the Sub-District is about 450 miles; the number of ferries is 20, nearly all of which are on the Indus.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of Sehw\u00e1n Sub-District, in 1873-74, amounted to \u00a327,760, of which \u00a323,510 was derived from imperial and \u00a34250 from local sources. The land tax, abk\u00e1ri (excise), and stamp duties formed the main items. Two subordinate civil courts, at Sehw\u00e1n and Kotri. Total number of police, 294, or 1 to every 554 of the population. Number of municipalities, 6, viz. Kotri, Sehw\u00e1n, Ar\u00e1zi, Bubak, D\u00e1d\u00fa, and M\u00e1njh\u00e1nd. Aggregate municipal income (1873-74), \u00a32331. Subsidiary jails at D\u00e1d\u00fa, Sehw\u00e1n, M\u00e1njh\u00e1nd, and Kotri. Number of Government schools (1873-74), 22, with 972 pupils.\n\nClimate.\u2014Average annual rainfall registered at Sehw\u00e1n, 6\u00b743 inches; at Kotri, 8\u00b709 inches. Prevalent diseases, fevers and cholera. Hospital at Kotri, dispensary at Sehw\u00e1n.\n\nSehw\u00e1n.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Sehw\u00e1n Deputy Collectorate, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind. Area, 924 square miles; pop. (1872), 54,292; gross revenue (1873-74), \u00a39974.\n\nSehw\u00e1n.\u2014Chief town of Sehw\u00e1n t\u00e1luk, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 26' N., and long. 67\u00b0 54' E., on the main road from Kotri to Shik\u00e1rpur via L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na; 84 miles north-north-west of Kotri, and 95 miles south-south-west of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na; elevation above sea level, 117 feet. The river Aral, which formerly flowed close to the town, has now quite deserted it. A few miles south of Sehw\u00e1n, the Laki Hills terminate abruptly, forming a characteristic feature of this portion of the Sub-District. Sehw\u00e1n is the headquarters of a mukht\u00ed\u00e1rk\u00e1r and t\u00e1pp\u00e1ddr. Pop. (1872), 4296, including 2324 Muhammadans and 1956 Hindus. The Muhammadan inhabitants are for the most part engaged in fishing; the Hindus, in trade. A large section of the people are professional mendicants, supported by the offerings of pilgrims at the shrine of L\u00e1l Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1z. The tomb containing the remains of this saint is enclosed in a quadrangular edifice, covered with a dome and lantern, said to have been built in 1356 A.D., and having beautiful encaustic tiles with Arabic inscriptions. M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1n\u00ed, of the Tarkhan dynasty, built a still larger tomb to this saint, which was completed in 1639 A.D. The gate and balustrade are said to have been of hammered silver, the gift of M\u00edr Karam Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lpur, who also crowned the domes with silver spires. The chief object, however, of antiquarian interest in Sehw\u00e1n is the fort ascribed to Alexander the Great. This is an artificial mound 80 or 90 yards high, measuring round the summit 1500 by 800\nfeet, and surrounded by a broken wall. The mound is evidently an artificial structure, and the remains of several towers are visible. The fortifications are now in disrepair. The public buildings of Sehw\u00e1n are the Subordinate Civil Court, a Government Anglo-veracular school, dispensary, post office, lock-up, Deputy Collector's and travellers' bungalow, and dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la. The municipal income varies from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400. The police number 37 men. The transit trade is mainly in wheat and rice; and the local commerce, in cloth and grain. The manufactures comprise carpets, coarse cloth, and pottery. The art of seal-engraving is also practised. Sehw\u00e1n is undoubtedly a place of great antiquity. Tradition asserts that the town was in existence at the time of the first Muhammadan invasion of Sind by Muhammad K\u00e1sim Safiki, about 713 A.D.; and it is believed to be the same place which submitted to his arms after the conquest of Nerankot, the modern Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nSejakpur.\u2014One of the petty States of North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 5 villages, with 3 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3532; of which \u00a331 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a311 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSelam.\u2014District and town in Madras.\u2014See Salem.\n\nSelere.\u2014River in Vizagapatam District, Madras.\u2014See Siller.\n\nSelu (Sailu).\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 50' N., and long. 78\u00b0 46' E., on the Bor river, 11 miles north-east of Wardh\u00e1 town, and close to the old high-road from N\u00e1gpur to Bombay. Pop. (1872), 3184. Selu was an old Gond settlement; but the fort was built by a chief named Kandeli Sard\u00e1r. It was the scene of a skirmish between Haz\u00e1ri Bhonsl\u00e1 and the Pind\u00e1ris. Chief manufacture, cotton cloth; in which, as well as in raw cotton, much business takes place at the market held every Tuesday. The town has a s\u00e1rd\u00ed (native inn), police outpost, and vernacular school.\n\nSendamangalam.\u2014Town in Salem District, Madras.\u2014See Shenda-Mangalam.\n\nSendgarsa.\u2014Peak in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal, overlooking the great central valley of the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l Hills. Height, about 2000 feet.\n\nSend\u00farjana.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar, about 60 miles south-east of Ellichpur town. Pop. (1867), 7032. A very fine well, which was built by a former j\u00e1gird\u00e1r, and is said to have cost \u00a32000, is about a mile distant. The principal trade of the large market held on Fridays is in turmeric, cotton, and opium. Municipal revenue, \u00a3136. Government school and police outpost.\n\nSenh\u00e1ti.\u2014Town in Jess\u00f3r District, Bengal, 4 miles north of Khuln\u00e1; contains the largest collection of houses in the District, and is perhaps the most jungly place in it. Pop. above 2000. The numerous tanks\nscattered over the town are filled with weeds and mud; and the roads of the village, with one exception, wind through masses of brushwood. Market-place, called Nim\u00e1i R\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s b\u00e1\u015bdr, with a temple to K\u00e1li; one or two sugar refineries, the produce of which is exported chiefly to Calcutta. On the banks of the river Bhairab are two shrines\u2014one dedicated to S\u00edtal\u00e1, goddess of small-pox, and the other to Jwarnar\u00e1yan, god of fever.\n\n**Sentapilli (Santapilly).**\u2014Village and lighthouse in Vizagapatam District, Madras.\u2014See Chantapilli.\n\n**Seodivad\u00far.**\u2014One of the petty States of Undsarviya, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a397; of which \u00a35 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\n**Seon\u00e1th (or Seo).**\u2014River rising in lat. 20\u00b0 30' N., long. 80\u00b0 43' E., in the P\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1ras Chiefship, in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces. After leaving a hilly tract, it flows through N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on State and the richer parts of R\u00e1ipur District; then turning to the east, it forms for some distance the boundary between R\u00e1ipur and Bil\u00e1spur; and finally joins the Mah\u00e1nadi at Dev\u00edg\u00e1ht. Its chief affluents are the Agar, H\u00e1mp, Mani\u00e1ri, Arp\u00e1, K\u00e1r\u00fan, and Ll\u00e1gar.\n\n**Seoni (Seonee).**\u2014A British District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 36' and 22\u00b0 58' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 14' and 80\u00b0 19' E. long. Bounded on the north by Jabalpur, on the east by Mandla and B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t, on the south by N\u00e1gpur and Bhand\u00e1ra, and on the west by Narsinhpur and Chhindw\u00e1ra. Area, 3606 square miles; population in 1872, 407,330 souls. Recent transfers of territory from Seoni to the lately formed District of B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t have considerably reduced the area and population of this District, which are thus returned in the latest Parliamentary Abstract, that for 1879:\u2014Area, 3252 square miles; pop. 299,856. The administrative headquarters are at Seoni Town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Seoni occupies a portion of the S\u00e1t-pura tableland, which separates the valley of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), on the north, from the great plain of N\u00e1gpur, on the south. The greater part of the District consists of the plateaux of Lakhn\u00e1don and Seoni on the north and west, together with the valleys between them; and of the watershed and elevated basin of the Wainganga river on the east. Besides these, a narrow strip of rocky land, known as Dongart\u00e1l, stretches out in the south-west; while the south-east corner belongs to the Katangi valley. Almost everywhere the District presents the varied scenery of an upland country. Geologically, northern Seoni constitutes a part of the wide field of overflowing trap which occupies the area between the Pachmarh\u00ed Hills westward and the Maikal range beyond Mandla to the east. In the south, the formation consists of crystalline rock. Towards the western boundary, the metamorphic\nrocks, chiefly gneiss and micaceous schist, form the southern face of the hills which bound the Seoni plateau. Northwards they are lost sight of in the bed of laterite which overlies this part of the plateau, and covers the trap to within a short distance of Seoni town. A few miles east of Seoni, the crystalline rocks again come to the surface; and from this point eastward the valley of the Sagar constitutes the line of demarcation between the crystalline rocks and the trap. The District is hilly throughout, but the physical features of the geological formations present a marked contrast. In the north the trap hills either take the shape of ridges with straight outlines and flattened tops, or, rising more gradually, expand into wide undulating plateaux. The valleys are wide and bare, and contain the rich black soil formed by disintegrated trap, spread over a deep deposit of calcareous clay; while the intersecting streams, as they cut through the clay, expose broad masses of bare black basalt, alternating with marshy and stagnant pools. In the southern portion of the District the hills are more pointed, the valleys more confined, and the soil, even where it is rich, contains a large admixture of sand. Seoni must at one time have abounded with timber. At present the northern hills have much teak, but of an inferior and stunted growth. Along the Wainganga a few patches of young teak are found; and the vast bamboo forest of Sonawani, in the south-east corner of the District, contains fine bije-sal and tendu; while to the north some large sdy grows upon the hills. The reserved forests consist of the great firewood reserve for K\u00e1mthi and N\u00e1gpur, covering 315 square miles; and the reserve in the south for the protection of satin-wood, for which there is considerable demand in the N\u00e1gpur arsenal. The chief river of the District is the Wainganga, which rises a few miles east of the N\u00e1gpur and Jabalpur road, near the Kurai Gh\u00e1t; and soon after, turning to the south, forms the boundary between Seoni and B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t Districts. Its affluents are the Hir\u00ed and Sagar on the right bank; the Theli, Bijna, and Th\u00e1nwar on the left. Besides these streams, the T\u00edmar and the Sher flow northwards to the Narbad\u00e1; and on the west, the Pench for some distance separates Seoni from Chhindw\u00e1ra. The N\u00e1gpur and Jabalpur road crosses the Sher at Son\u00e1 Dongri, where a fine stone bridge spans the river. The general slope of the country is from east to west. The elevation of the Seoni and Lakhn\u00e1don plateaux varies from 1800 to 2200 feet above sea level. Iron is found in Jun\u00ed and Katangi; but no mines are worked in the District.\n\nHistory.\u2014About the 5th century of our era, a dynasty of conquerors appears to have reigned on the S\u00e1tpura tableland. Some grants of territory inscribed on copper plates found in Seoni, an inscription in the Zodiac cave at Ajant\u00e1, and a few passages in the Pur\u00e1nas, dimly disclose a line of princes sprung from one Vindhy\u00e1sakti. This mythical hero seems to be the eponymous monarch of\nthe Vindhy\u00e1n Hills, in which designation the Pur\u00e1\u00f1as include the Satpura range. But the history proper of Seoni only begins with the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1 of Garha-Mandla, who, in 1530, extended his dominion over fifty-two chiefships, three of which\u2014Ghansor, Chaurl, and Dongart\u00e1l\u2014form the greater part of the present District of Seoni.\n\nNearly two centuries later, Narendra S\u00e1, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandla, conferred these tracts on Bakht Buland, the famous prince of Deogarh, in acknowledgment of his assistance in suppressing a revolt. Bakht Buland placed his kinsman R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Sinh in possession of the Seoni country; and the latter built a fort at Chhap\u00e1ra and established his headquarters in that town. Soon afterwards, Bakht Buland made a progress through the District, and chanced to make the acquaintance of T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n, a Muhammadan adventurer. The bravery of T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n in killing a bear single-handed first attracted the attention and won the favour of the Deogarh monarch; and it was at the instigation, and in the name of Bakht Buland, that T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n attacked and took S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed in Bhand\u00e1ra District. In 1743, Raghoj\u00ed, the Marhatt\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, finally overthrew the dynasty of Deogarh; but Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, who had succeeded his father, T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n, at S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed, refused to recognise the conqueror, and held out against the Marhatt\u00e1s for three years. Admiring his conduct, Raghoj\u00ed offered him Seoni District if he would give up S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed. Muhammad Kh\u00e1n consented; and repaired to Chhap\u00e1ra, whence he governed Seoni, with the title of Diw\u00e1n. One serious reverse chequered a fortunate and successful reign when, during the absence of Muhammad Kh\u00e1n at N\u00e1gpur, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandla attacked and captured Chhap\u00e1ra. The square tomb which still stands in the ruined fort covers the large pit in which all those slain in the assault were buried. The Diw\u00e1n, however, speedily advanced from N\u00e1gpur with a large force, and recovered his capital; and the Th\u00e1nwar and Ganga rivers were again declared to be the boundaries between Seoni and the Mandla kingdom. Maj\u00edd Kh\u00e1n, the eldest son of Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, succeeded in 1761; and was followed in 1774 by his son Muhammad Amin Kh\u00e1n, who removed his headquarters to Seoni, where he built the present family residence. After a prosperous reign of twenty-four years, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Muhammad Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. The weakness of the new ruler proved disastrous both to the country and the dynasty. Chhap\u00e1ra, which, though no longer the capital, was still a large and flourishing city, with a population, it is said, of 40,000, was sacked and utterly ruined by the Pind\u00e1ris; and soon afterwards, perceiving the incompetence of the Diw\u00e1n, and anxious to compensate by fresh acquisitions for their cession of Berar to the British in 1804, the Marhatt\u00e1s ejected Muhammad Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. Raghoj\u00ed then sold the government of the District for \u00a330,000 per annum to Kharak Bh\u00e1rti, a Gos\u00e1in. Eventually, with the downfall of the N\u00e1gpur\npower, Seoni came under British rule, and since then has remained undisturbed. The District contains but few architectural remains. At Umargarh, Bhainsagarh, Partapgarh, and Kanhaigarh, all situated on commanding spots along the southern margin of the Satpuras, stand ruined forts attributed by tradition to the Bundela Rajas. Of these, the Bhainsagarh fort is in the least imperfect condition. Two old Gond forts also remain,\u2014one in the Sonwara forest, near Ashta; the other near Ugl\u00ed, on a well-nigh inaccessible rock in the bed of the Hir river. At Ghansor, 20 miles north-east of Seoni town, the ruins of about 40 temples seem to indicate the former existence of a large town. Some of the plinth are still in their place, and are attributed to a caste of Hindus from the Deccan called Hemarpanthis.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A rough enumeration in 1866 returned the population of Seoni at 421,650. The more careful Census of 1872 disclosed 407,330. The latest return (1879) shows the population of the reconstituted District to be 299,856. The Census of 1872 still remains, however, the only basis for a detailed examination of the people. It disclosed a population of 407,330 persons on an area of 3606 square miles, residing in 1661 villages or townships and 79,043 houses. Persons per square mile, 113; villages per square mile, 0.46; houses per square mile, 21.92; persons per village, 245.23; persons per house, 5.15. Classified according to sex\u2014males, 205,496; females, 201,834. According to age, the male children in 1877 numbered 89,605, the female children, 84,197. Ethnical division in 1877\u2014Europeans, 15; Eurasian, 1; aboriginal tribes, 157,903; Hindus, 252,978; Muhammadans, 15,408; Buddhists and Jains, 1070. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes are the Gonds (148,183 in 1872), the remainder consisting of Kurkus, Bharias, etc. Among the Hindus in 1872, Brahmins numbered 6361, the mass of the Hindu population consisting of Dhers or Mhars (40,207), Ponwars (30,305), Ahirs or Gauls (26,907), Malis or Marals (24,873), and other cultivating or inferior castes. Native Christians in 1877, 40. The Ponwars supply the most industrious and enterprising agriculturists. Their appearance in Seoni dates rather more than a century back, their first settlements being about Sangarhi and Partapgarh, whence they ultimately spread into Katangi. The Ahirs or Gauls are a pastoral tribe, who have occupied the fine grazing ground to be found in most parts of the District, and especially the rocky strip of Dongartal in the south-west. The Muhammadans were probably more numerous when the line of Muhammad Khan governed the District. The diminution of the population between 1866 and 1872 may be explained by the emigration of agriculturists, especially Ponwars, to the lately formed District of Balagh\u00e1t. Still more recently, the transfer of territory from Seoni to Balagh\u00e1t has, according to the latest Parliamentary Return of 1879, reduced the\npopulation of Seoni District to 299,856 and the area to 3,252 square miles. The details given above, however, though only historically correct, still serve to indicate the composition of the people inhabiting the District. The prevailing languages in Seoni are Hindi and Urdu.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014No town in Seoni District has a population exceeding 5,000, with the exception of Seoni, the District capital\u2014population in 1872, 9,557. Townships of from 1,000 to 5,000 inhabitants, 21; from 200 to 1,000, 675; villages of less than 200 inhabitants, 964. Seoni, the only municipality, had in 1876-77 an estimated population within municipal limits of 8,042. The municipal income amounted to \u00a31,127, of which \u00a3991 was derived from taxation, being 2s. 5d. per head; total expenditure, \u00a31,081.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3,252 square miles, only 931 are cultivated; and of the portion lying waste, 753 are returned as cultivable. 18,451 acres of rice land in the Katangi valley are irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. The Government assessment is at the rate of 6\u00bdd. per acre of the cultivated area, or 3\u00bdd. on the cultivable area. Wheat forms the staple crop of the District, and is grown year after year on the rich black soil of the plateaux in the north and west. In 1876, it occupied 261,042 acres; while 193,751 acres were devoted to other food grains. The rice land of the District lies in the south. In 1876, rice was grown on 101,282 acres. Other products were\u2014sugar-cane, 1,058; cotton, 9,336; fibres, 2,888 acres. The kusa grass, which yields an oil like the cajeput, and the bhera (Terminalia bellerica), harra (Terminalia chebula), and manjit (Rubia munjeesta), plants which supply valuable dyes, abound in the District. The average out-turn per acre in 1876 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 490 lbs.; inferior grain, 384 lbs.; rice, 480 lbs.; sugar (gur), 760 lbs.; cotton, 34 lbs.; fibres, 1,098 lbs. The rocky tract called Dongartal, in the south-west, contains some excellent grazing ground, and its breed of cattle is famous. The stock of cows, bullocks, and buffaloes amounted in 1876 to 248,406 head. The Census of 1872 showed a total of 2,961 proprietors, of whom 463 were classed as 'inferior.' The tenants numbered 55,954, of whom 16,673 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while 39,281 were tenants-at-will. The rent rates per acre in 1876 for the different qualities of land are returned as follows:\u2014\n\nLand suited for wheat, 2s. 6d.; inferior grains, 1s. 6d.; rice or cotton, 2s. 2d.; sugar-cane, 4s. 3d.; fibres, 3s. 6d. The ordinary prices of produce per cwt. were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 3s. 8d.; rice, 6s. 10\u00bdd.; sugar (gur), 17s. 9d.; cotton, 43s. 8d. Wages per diem averaged, for skilled labour, 1s. 3d.; for unskilled labour, 3d.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the District is chiefly carried on by means of markets in the towns. The most important are those held\nat L\u00e1lbar\u00e1, W\u00e1r\u00e1, Seoni, and P\u00edparw\u00e1n\u00ed, to which the grain of the rice-producing tract in the south is brought for export to N\u00e1gpur and K\u00e1mthi (Kamptee). Kohk\u00e1 also, between W\u00e1r\u00e1 Seoni and P\u00edparw\u00e1n\u00ed, has a large salt market. Only two annual fairs take place in the District. The imports and exports are both insignificant, but the through traffic between N\u00e1gpur and Bhand\u00e1ra and the north causes some degree of business. The manufactures consist of coarse cloth, and some pottery of superior quality made at K\u00e1nh\u00edw\u00e1ra. At Khaw\u00e1sa, in the midst of the forest, leather is beautifully tanned. In 1876, the District possessed 90 miles of made roads. The chief line of communication is the high-road from N\u00e1gpur to Jabalpur, which enters the District near Khaw\u00e1sa, and, passing by Seoni, crosses the border into Jabalpur District near Dh\u00fam\u00e1. It has travellers' bungalows at Kur\u00e1i, Chhap\u00e1ra, and Dhuma. A District road with American platform bridges runs from Seoni through Katangi, to join the Great Eastern Road. The other lines consist of mere bullock tracks, leading to various points in B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t and N\u00e1gpur Districts. Seoni has no means of communication by water.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Seoni was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1876-77, \u00a325,567, of which the land-tax yielded \u00a315,170. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a37,588. Number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 5; magistrates, 5. Maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 45 miles; average distance, 24 miles. Number of police, 315, costing \u00a34,369, being 1 policeman to about every 10 square miles and to every 960 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1876 was 115, of whom 6 were females. The total cost of the jails in that year was \u00a3711. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 45, attended by 1,754 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The plateaux enjoy a moderate and healthy climate. The average temperature in the shade at the civil station in 1876 is returned as follows:\u2014May, highest reading 110\u00b0 F., lowest 72\u00b0 F.; July, highest 97\u00b0 F., lowest 68\u00b0 F.; December, highest 84\u00b0 F., lowest 42\u00b0 F. In that year, the rainfall did not exceed 45 inches. The average fall is 51\u00b746 inches. The prevailing disease is fever, which proves most dangerous during the months succeeding the rains. In 1876, two charitable dispensaries, at Seoni and Lakhn\u00e1don, afforded medical relief to 14,036 in-door and out-door patients. The death-rate reached the high figure of 30\u00b75 per thousand; the mean for the previous five years is returned at 18.\n\nSeoni.\u2014South-western tahsil or Subdivision of Seoni District, Central\nProvinces, lying between $21^\\circ 33'$ and $22^\\circ 27'$ N. lat., and between $79^\\circ 27'$ and $80^\\circ 6'$ E. long. Area, 1384 square miles; pop. (1872), 160,542, residing in 606 villages or townships and 31,377 houses.\n\n**Seoni.**\u2014Principal town and administrative headquarters of Seoni District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $22^\\circ 5' 30''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 35'$ E., on the road from Nagpur to Jabalpur, nearly half-way between the two places. Pop. (1872), 9557. Founded in 1774 by Muhammad Amin Khan, who made it his headquarters instead of Chhapara. Seoni contains large public gardens, a fine market-place, and a handsome tank. Principal buildings\u2014court-house, jail, school (which is well attended), dispensary, and post office. The climate is healthy, and the temperature moderate.\n\n**Seoni.**\u2014Central tahsil or Subdivision of Hoshangabad District, Central Provinces. Area, 633 square miles; pop. (1872), 52,377, residing in 144 villages or townships and 11,400 houses.\n\n**Seoni.**\u2014Town in Hoshangabad District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $22^\\circ 28'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 29'$ E., on the high-road to Bombay. Pop. (1872), 7579. Of the town on this site in the time of Akbar, no remains exist. The present town dates from the conquest of the country by Raghoji Bhonsla about 1750, when a fort was built where an Amil resided. A detachment of British troops from Hoshangabad took the fort in 1818. Seoni is perhaps the chief mercantile town in the whole Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, being the entrep\u00f4t from which the cotton of Bhop\u00e1l and Narsinhpur, as well as of Hoshangabad, is exported to Bombay. Grain is the other export. Imports\u2014English cotton fabrics, spices, and metals. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway has a station at Seoni, and a sardi (native inn) has been built.\n\n**Seoniband.**\u2014Artificial lake in Bhandara District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $21^\\circ$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 2'$ E., 8 miles north-west of the Nawegao tank; about 8 miles in circumference; average depth, 30 feet; length of embankment, 630 feet. Constructed before 1550 by Dadu Patel Kohri, whose family held Seoni village for about 250 years. In the time of Raghoji I., the village was granted to Baka Bai, whose descendants still own it.\n\n**Seopur (Sheopur).**\u2014Town in Gwalior State, Central India; situated in lat. $25^\\circ 39'$ N., and long. $76^\\circ 41' 15''$ E., near the western boundary of the State. According to Thornton, it was formerly the capital of a small Rajput principality, but in the early part of the present century was subjugated by the forces of Daulat Rao Sindhia. 'In 1816, when garrisoned by Sindhia's general, Baptiste, with 200 men, it was surprised and taken by escalade by the celebrated Rajput chief Jai Sinh, who had only 60 men. The captor seized a large amount of treasure, and made the family of Baptiste prisoners.'\n\n**Seoraj.**\u2014Tract of country in Kangra District, Punjab; forming part\nof the Kullu Subdivision, and lying between $31^\\circ 20' 30''$ and $31^\\circ 54' 30''$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 14'$ and $77^\\circ 43'$ E. long. Area, 575 square miles. This tract occupies the wild block of land between the Sainj and the Sutlej (Satlaj). The Jalori or Suket range, an offshoot of the Mid-Himalayan system, divides it into two portions, known as Outer and Inner Seoraj. The greater part of the surface is covered by forests of deodar and other trees; but the river valleys present frequent patches of careful cultivation, interspersed with picturesque villages of wooden houses, closely resembling Swiss chalets.\n\n**Seori Narayan.**\u2014Eastern tahsil or Subdivision of Bilaspur District, Central Provinces. Area, 1415 square miles; pop. (1872), 186,983, residing in 712 villages or townships and 43,529 houses.\n\n**Seori Narayan.**\u2014Town in Bilaspur District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $21^\\circ 43' N.$, and long. $82^\\circ 39' E.$, 36 miles east of Bilaspur town, on the Mahanadi river. Estimated pop. (1872), 1500. The temple to Narayan (whence the name) appears, from an inscription on a tablet, to have been built about 841 A.D. It has no architectural merit. The town was once a favourite residence of the Ratanpur Court. In the rains, the Mahanadi at this point forms a fine river, navigable for large boats from Sambalpur; and even at other times, its channel retains a considerable depth of water. An important fair is held every February.\n\n**Seota.**\u2014Town in Sitapur District, Oudh; situated 32 miles east of Sitapur town, between the Chauka and Gogra rivers. Founded by Alha, a Chandel Thakur, a protege of Rajaji Chand of Kanauj, who granted to Alha possession of all the surrounding tract, known as Ganjar. The town contains a school, the ruins of a mosque, and an old talukdars fort. Good bazars, and annual fair. Pop. (1869), 3428.\n\n**Sera.**\u2014Ancient name for the Southern Division of Dravida, the present Madras Presidency.\u2014See Chera and Kerala.\n\n**Serampur (Srirampur).**\u2014Subdivision of Hooghly District, Bengal; lying between $22^\\circ 39'$ and $22^\\circ 55'$ N. lat., and between $88^\\circ$ and $88^\\circ 27'$ E. long. Area, 349 square miles; villages, 803; houses, 86,793; pop. (1872), 393,864; persons per square mile, 1129; villages per square mile, 230; persons per village, 490; houses per square mile, 249; persons per house, 4.5. This Subdivision comprises the 5 police circles of Serampur, Baidyabati, Haripal, Krishnanagar, and Chanditali.\n\n**Serampur (Srirampur).**\u2014Headquarters of Serampur Subdivision, Hooghly District, Bengal; situated on the west bank of the Hooghly river, opposite Barrackpur, in lat. $22^\\circ 45' 26''$ N., and long. $88^\\circ 23' 10''$ E.; pop. (1872), 24,440. The municipality includes several neighbouring hamlets; total municipal revenue (1871), \u00a33687, 4s.; rate of taxation, 3s. per head of population; 41 metalled and 36 unmetalled roads run through\nthe town. Serampur was formerly a Danish settlement, and remained so until 1845, when all the Danish possessions in India were ceded by treaty to the East India Company on payment of \u00a3125,000. Station on the East Indian Railway, 13 miles distant from Calcutta (Howrah station). Serampur is historically famous as the scene of the labours of the Baptist missionaries, Carey, Marshman, and Ward; the mission still flourishes, and its founders have established a church, school, college, and noble library in connection with it; there is also a dispensary here. The Friend of India, a weekly paper published at Serampur, once rendered this town conspicuous in the history of Indian journalism. Chief manufactures, paper and mats.\n\nSeringapatam (Sr\u012br\u0101ngapatnam).\u2014The old capital of the State of Mysore; situated on an island of the same name in the K\u0101veri (Cauvery), 75 miles south-east by road from Bangalore, and 10 miles north-east from Mysore city. Lat. 12\u00b0 25' 33\" N., long. 76\u00b0 43' 8\" E. Population (1871), including the suburb of Ganjam, 10,594, consisting of 8805 Hindus, 1639 Muhammadans, 12 Jains, and 138 Christians; males, 5173; females, 5421. Municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a31048; rate of taxation, 2s. per head.\n\nHistory.\u2014The name is derived from Sr\u012b Ranga, one of the forms of the god Vishnu, who is worshipped by the same title on two other islands lower down the K\u0101veri, Sivasamudram and Srirangam; but his temple here takes first rank of the three, as Adi Ranga. Local legend relates that Gautama Buddha himself worshipped at this shrine. According to a Tamil ms., preserved in the Mackenzie collection, the site had become overgrown with jungle, and the temple was rebuilt in 894 A.D., during the reign of the last Chera or Kongu sovereign. In 1133, the Vishnuite apostle R\u0101m\u0101nuja received a grant of the island, with the surrounding country, from a king of the Ball\u0101la dynasty. The fort is said to have been founded in 1454 by a descendant of one of the local officers or hebbars appointed by R\u0101m\u0101nuja. Seringapatam first appears in authentic history as the capital of the viceroys of the distant Hindu emperors of Vijayanagar, who took the title of Sr\u012b-ranga-r\u0101yal. Tirumala, the last of these viceroys, surrendered in 1610 to R\u0101j\u0101 Wodeyar, the representative of the rising house of Mysore. Henceforth Seringapatam remained the seat of Government until the downfall of Tip\u016b Sult\u00e1n in 1799.\n\nThe existing fortifications were almost entirely constructed by Tip\u016b, who thrice sustained a siege from British armies. In 1791, Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-General, commanding in person, advanced up to the walls, but was compelled to retire through want of provisions. In the following year, he won a decisive victory in the field, and had invested the city on all sides, when Tip\u016b purchased peace by the cession of half his dominions. Finally, in 1799, the fort was stormed\nby General Harris, and Tip\u00fa fell in the breach. The siege was begun in April of that year with a powerful battering train, and the assault was delivered after a bombardment of nearly one month's duration. The spot selected for breaching was in the wall facing the K\u00e1veri, for the defences were weakest on that side, and the river was at that season of the year easily fordable. After the capture, the island of Seringapatam was ceded to the British Government, whose property it still remains, being leased to the State of Mysore for an annual rent of \u00a35000. The residence of the restored Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 was removed to Mysore city, and Seringapatam immediately fell into decay. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, who visited the place in 1800, returned the population at 31,895 souls, as compared with 150,000 when Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n was at the height of his power. An outbreak of epidemic fever accompanied this depopulation; and in 1811, the British military headquarters were removed to Bangalore. At the present day, the ruins of Seringapatam are almost deserted; and the place bears such a bad name for malaria, that no European traveller dare sleep on the island. The natives attribute this change of climate to the destruction of the sweet flag, a plant to which they assign extraordinary virtue as a febrifuge. The suburb of Ganjam, said to have been colonized by Tip\u00fa with the deported inhabitants of Sir\u00e1, is a fairly prosperous place, with manufactures of cotton cloth and paper, and crowded fairs held three times in the year.\n\nGeneral Description.\u2014The island of Seringapatam is about 3 miles in length from east to west, and 1 mile in breadth. The fort stands at its upper or western end, immediately overhanging the river. The plan is that of an irregular pentagon, with an extreme diameter of 1\u00bd mile. The defences, which were laid out by Tip\u00fa himself, are imposing for their massiveness, though not constructed on scientific principles. They consist of wall piled upon wall, and cavalier behind cavalier, the chief characteristic being the deep ditches cut through the solid granite. The whole remains in almost precisely the same condition as it was left after the siege, even to the breaches, except that a luxuriant growth of trees has been allowed to spring up. The spot where the English batteries were planted is now marked by two cannons stuck upright in the ground. Inside the fort are the ruins of Tip\u00fa's palace, now partly occupied as a storehouse for sandal-wood; the old temple of Ranga-n\u00e1tha-sw\u00e1mi; the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, a tall mosque with two minarets, built by Tip\u00fa shortly before his death; and a few traces of the palace of the early Hindu rulers. Just outside the walls is the Dariya Daulat B\u00e1g, or 'garden of the wealth of the sea,' a building of graceful proportions, handsomely decorated with arabesque work in rich colours. It was erected by Tip\u00fa for a summer retreat, and contains the celebrated pictures representing the defeat\nof Baillie at Conjevaram in 1780, which, after being twice defaced, were finally restored by the express orders of Lord Dalhousie when Governor-General. At the eastern or lower end of the island, near the suburb of Ganj\u00e1m, is the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh or 'red garden,' containing the mausoleum built by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n for his father Haidar Al\u00ed, in which he himself lies, by his father's side. This is a square building, with dome and minarets, surrounded by a corridor which is supported by pillars of black hornblende. The double doors, inlaid with ivory, were the gift of Lord Dalhousie. The inscription on the tombstone of Tip\u00fa relates how he died a martyr to Isl\u00e1m, and at the same time indicates by the initial letters the date of his death. Each of the two tombs is covered with a crimson pall, and the expenses of the place are defrayed by Government. The island of Seringapatam yields valuable crops of rice and sugar-cane, which are watered from a canal originally constructed by Tip\u00fa, and brought across from the mainland by an aqueduct.\n\nSeringham.\u2014Famous temple in Trichinopoli District, Madras.\u2014See Srirangam.\n\nSesh\u00e1chalam.\u2014Hill range in Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District, Madras; an offshoot of the P\u00e1lkonda Hills, skirting the east and north-east of the District.

Flourishing agricultural community, with several Hindu traders. The fort, also known as Shankargarh, stands about a mile north-east of the village. It was built by the Sikhs, and is now strongly fortified, and held by a detachment from Peshawar.\n\n**Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 31' and 25\u00b0 43' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 23' and 84\u00b0 55' E. long. Area, 4385 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1872, 1,723,974. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d forms the south-western portion of the Patn\u00e1 Division. It is bounded on the north by the District of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur in the North-Western Provinces, and the Bengal District of S\u00e1ran; on the east by Patn\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1 Districts; on the south by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1; and on the west by the Districts of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, Benares, and Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur, in the North-Western Provinces. On the north and east, the boundary is marked by the Ganges and Son rivers, which unite in the north-eastern corner of the District. Similarly, the Karamn\u00e1sa forms the boundary with the North-Western Provinces on the west, from its source to its junction with the Ganges near Chaus\u00e1; and the Son is the boundary with Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 on the south. The administrative headquarters are at the town of ARR\u00c1H.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d naturally divides into two distinct regions, differing in climate, scenery, and productions. The northern portion, comprising about three-fourths of the whole area, presents the ordinary flat appearance common to the valley of the Ganges in the Province of Behar; but it has a barer aspect than the trans-Gangetic Districts of S\u00e1ran and Tirhut. This tract is entirely under cultivation, and is dotted over with clumps of trees\u2014mangoes, *mahua*, bamboos, palms, etc. The southern portion of the District is occupied by the K\u00e1imur Hills, a branch of the great Vindhy\u00e1n range. The area of these hills situated within Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District amounts to 799 square miles. The boundaries of the hills, though well defined, are very irregular, and often indented by deep gorges scoured out by the hill streams. The edges are generally very precipitous, and huge masses of rocks which have fallen from the top obstruct in many\nplaces the river channels below. The summit of the hills consists of a series of saucer-shaped valleys, each a few miles in diameter, with a deposit of rich vegetable mould in the centre, on which the finest crops are produced. There are several gh\u0101ts or ascents to the top, some of which are practicable for beasts of burden. Two of the most frequented of these passes are Sarki and Khariyar\u2014the first near the south-western boundary, the second in a deep gorge north of Roht\u00e1s. Two passes on the north side are more accessible,\u2014one, known as the Khul\u00e1 gh\u0101t, is 2 miles south of Sasser\u00e1m; the other is at Chhanpathar, at the extreme west of the District, where the Karamn\u00e1sa forms a waterfall. The slopes to the south are covered with bamboo, while those on the north are overgrown with a mixed growth of stunted jungle. The general height of the plateau is 1500 feet above the level of the sea. The Son and the Ganges may be called the chief rivers of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, although neither of them anywhere crosses the boundary. The District occupies the angle formed by the junction of these two rivers, and is watered by several minor streams, all of which rise among the Kaimur Hills and flow north towards the Ganges. The most noteworthy of these are the following:\u2014The Karamn\u00e1sa, the accursed stream of Hindu mythology, rises on the eastern ridge of the Kaimur plateau, and flows north-west, crossing into Mirzapur District near Kulhu\u00e1. After a course of 15 miles in that District, it again touches Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, which it separates from Benares; finally it falls into the Ganges near Chaus\u00e1. The Dhob\u00e1 or K\u00e1o rises on the plateau, and flowing north, forms a fine waterfall, and enters the plains at the Tarrach\u00e1nd\u00ed Pass, 2 miles south-east of Sasser\u00e1m. Here it bifurcates\u2014one branch, the Kudra, turning to the west, and ultimately joining the Karamn\u00e1sa; while the other, preserving the name of K\u00e1o, flows north and falls into the Ganges near G\u00e1igh\u00e1t. The Darg\u00e1ut\u00ed rises on the southern ridge of the plateau, and after flowing north for 9 miles, rushes over a precipice 300 feet high, into the deep glen of Kadhar Kho; eventually it joins the Karamn\u00e1sa, passing on its way the stalactite caves of Gupta and the hill-fortress of Shergarh. This river contains water all the year round; and during the rains, boats of 1\u00bd ton burthen can sail up stream 50 or 60 miles from its mouth. The chief tributaries of the Darg\u00e1ut\u00ed are the S\u00far\u00e1, Kor\u00e1, Gonhu\u00e1 and Kudra. In the hilly southern portion of the District, large game abounds. Tigers, bears, and leopards are common; five or six varieties of deer are found; and among the other animals met with are the wild boar, jackal, hy\u00e6na, and fox. The nilg\u00e1i (blue cow), the Antelope picta of naturalists, is seen on the Kaimur tableland. Of game birds, the barred-headed goose (Anser indicus) is common. The black-backed goose (Sarkidornis melanotus) and the grey goose (A. cinereus) are also to be found. The former is very rare in Lower Bengal, and the latter is seldom seen south of Central\nIndia, though it is a common visitor in the north. The other game birds of the District include many varieties of wild duck (the most remarkable being the sheldrake), several kinds of teal, partridges, curlews, and pea-fowl, jungle-fowl, snipe, and golden and common plovers.\n\nThe Son Canals.\u2014The project of irrigating Shahabad District by a comprehensive scheme of canals, which should also be navigable, dates from 1855, when Colonel Dickens proposed the construction of canals from Patna westwards to Chun\u00e1r, a project subsequently extended to Monghyr in the one direction and to Mirzapur in the other. It was, however, finally decided in 1871 that the original scheme should not be extended, and it is still an open question whether the Main Western Canal shall be extended even as far as Chun\u00e1r. The work was commenced in 1869 by the construction of an anicut or weir at Dehr\u00ed-on-Son, about half a mile south of the causeway which carries the Grand Trunk Road from B\u00e1r\u00fan to Dehr\u00ed. This weir is 12,500 feet long by 120 broad, and 8 feet above the normal level of the river bed. It constitutes the headwork of the system. The Main Western Canal, starting from here, has to carry up to the fifth mile, where the Arrah Canal branches off in a north-westerly direction, 4511 cubic feet of water per second, to irrigate 1,200,000 acres, only 600,000 of which require simultaneous irrigation. The Arrah Canal takes off 1616 cubic feet of water per second, which leaves 2895 cubic feet up to the 12th mile, where the Baxar and Chausa Canals branch off in a northerly direction, abstracting a further quantity of 1260 cubic feet per second. In aligning the Main Western Canal, the great object was to escape a heavy cutting 30 feet deep at Dehr\u00ed, and carry the water along the ridges of the country. It curves round in a northerly direction to the head-works of the Arrah Canal, then bends to the west, crossing the K\u00e1o by means of a siphon aqueduct at Bihiy\u00e1, and finally stops on the Grand Trunk Road 2 miles west of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m. The distance from Dehr\u00ed to this point is 21\u00bd miles. The length of the Arrah Canal is 60 miles, from Dehr\u00ed to the point where it enters the Gang\u00ed n\u00e1di, by which it communicates (a farther distance of 10 miles) with the Ganges. With its two branches, the Bihiy\u00e1 and Dumraon Canals, the Arrah Canal commands an area of 441,500 acres. The Bihiy\u00e1 Canal, 30\u00bd miles long, has 7 distributaries; and the Dumraon branch, 40\u00bd miles long, has 12. The Arrah Canal has, in addition to these two branches, 4 principal distributaries. The total length of the Bax\u00e1r and Chaus\u00e1 branches is 85 miles, and they command with their distributaries the country between the K\u00e1o and the Dun\u00e1uti on the west, a tract which greatly needs irrigation. As a rule, the canals run in such a way that they do not cross the natural drainage channels of the country; but hill-re this is not so, siphons have been provided which allow the water masses under the canal unhindered. Many of the works being still\nincomplete, it is not possible to give at present a trustworthy estimate of the total cost of the work. There can be little doubt that these canals have conferred upon Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d entire immunity from future famines. As far as the Son readings have gone, they show that a minimum supply of 3000 cubic feet of water per second can be depended upon up to the 15th of January; and this would suffice to irrigate 480,000 acres. But many of the cold-weather crops will have been completely irrigated before this date, so that the amount of water required decreases equally with the volume of the stream. Thus peas, which occupy a very large area, generally receive their last watering about Christmas, when the supply is 3500 cubic feet per second. Generally speaking, three waterings are required for the cold-weather crops\u2014one early in November, one in December, and one in the middle of January. After February, the supply of water decreases very rapidly; and though in exceptional years of high flood, irrigation might be carried on up to March and April for sugar-cane and indigo, these crops can only be occasionally watered or drenched in an ordinary year.\n\n**Population.\u2014** Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d was one of the Districts statistically surveyed in the beginning of the present century by Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, who made the area 4087 square miles, and the population 1,419,520. According to a later estimate, based upon the Survey of 1844-46, the area was returned at 4404 square miles, and the population at 1,602,274. The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,723,974 persons, living in 5110 villages and 275,041 houses; density of the population, 393 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 1\u00b716; houses per square mile, 63; persons per village, 337; persons per house, 6\u00b73. The th\u00e1nd\u00e1s or police circles along the Ganges are the most densely populated, having from 600 to 700 persons to the square mile. South of these comes a row of th\u00e1nd\u00e1s with a population of between 400 and 500 to the square mile; and further south, the population becomes yet thinner, till in the th\u00e1nd\u00e1 of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m, which is over 1000 square miles in extent, the density is only 169 to the square mile; this th\u00e1nd\u00e1 contains much hilly, uncultivated land. Classified according to sex, there are in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d 835,374 males and 888,600 females; proportion of males in total population, 48\u00b75 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 12 years\u2014males, 312,717, and females, 273,276; above 12 years\u2014males, 522,657, and females, 615,324. The excessive proportion of male over female children is due to the fact that here, as elsewhere in India, natives consider that girls attain womanhood at an earlier age than boys reach manhood, and many girls are thus returned as women. The ethnical division of the people is as follows:\u2014Non-Asiatics (mostly British), 257; mixed races (Eurasians), 137; Asiatics, other than natives of India (Armenians), 9; natives of India, 1,723,571. Aboriginal tribes are\nrepresented principally by the Bhars or R\u00e1jbhars, of whom there are 5679, and the Karw\u00e1rs, who number 5673. The Bhars claim to be Purihar R\u00e1jputs, and at one time occupied a large part of the District. They are now almost entirely confined to the Bax\u00e1r Subdivision, and are one of the most degraded races, most of them being swine-herds. Among the low castes or semi-Hinduized aborigines, the most numerous are the Cham\u00e1rs, shoemakers and workers in leather, of whom there are 91,777; and the Dos\u00e1dhs (77,927), many of whom serve as village watchmen. Of the higher classes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 198,631, and R\u00e1jputs, 185,652. The most numerous caste in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is that of the Go\u00e1l\u00e1s or cowherds, of whom there are 214,605, or 12.4 per cent. of the total population. The Koer\u00eds, the chief cultivating caste of the District, number 130,394. The Hindus, as grouped together on the basis of religion, number altogether 1,590,643, or 92.2 per cent. of the total population. The followers of Isl\u00e1m are 132,671 in number, or 7.6 per cent. of the population\u2014a smaller proportion than in any other District of Behar. The number of Christians in the District is 461, of whom 58 are natives. Eight municipalities contain a population of upwards of 5000, viz.\u2014ARRAH, 39,386; SASSERAM, 21,023; DUMRAON, 17,356; BAXAR, 13,446; JAGDISPUR, 9400; BHOJPUR, 7004; NASRIGANJ, 5732; and BHABUA, 5071\u2014all of which see separately. Many of these are not really towns, but merely municipal aggregations of rural villages. They have a total population of 118,418, leaving 1,605,556 as forming the strictly rural population. Fifty-nine towns have a population of between 2000 and 5000; 227 contain from 1000 to 2000 inhabitants; 2128 have from 200 to 1000; and 2687 villages have fewer than 200.\n\nThe principal place of interest in the District, from an antiquarian point of view, is the fort of Roht\u00e1s or ROHTASGARH, so called from Prince Rohit\u00e1swa, son of Harischandra, one of the kings of the Solar dynasty. The present buildings were erected by M\u00e1n Sinh, soon after he was appointed Viceroy of Bengal and Behar in 1644. The remains of the fortress occupy a part of the K\u00e1imur tableland, measuring about 4 miles from east to west, and 5 miles from north to south. Other places of interest in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d are the ruins of Shergarh fort, named after Sher Sh\u00e1h, its founder; Chainpur fort, with several interesting monuments and tombs; Daraut\u00ed and Baidyan\u00e1th, with ruins attributed to the Suars or Sivir\u00e1s; Mas\u00e1r, the Mo-ho-so-lo of Hiouen Thsang; Chaus\u00e1, the scene of the defeat of Hum\u00e1yun in 1539 by Sher Sh\u00e1h; Tilothu, near which are a fine waterfall and a very ancient Cheru image; and Patan\u00e1, once the capital of a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Suar tribe. A description of these places will be found under their respective names. The sacred cave of Guptasar lies in the centre of the K\u00e1imur plateau, 7 miles from Shergarh.\nThe town of Arrah is invested with a special historical interest, as being the scene of a stirring episode in the Mutiny of 1857. A body of rebels, consisting of about 2000 Sepoys from Din\u00e1pur and four times as many armed villagers, under Ku\u00e1r Sinh, marched in the end of July on Arrah. They reached the town on the 27th of that month, and forthwith released all the prisoners in the jail, and plundered the treasury. The European women and children had already been sent away, but there remained in the town about a dozen Englishmen, official and non-official, and three or four other Christians of different races. The Commissioner of Patn\u00e1, Mr. Tayler, had supplied a garrison of 50 S\u00edkhs. This small force held out for a long eight days, until rescued by Major Vincent Eyre. The centre of defence had been wisely chosen. At this time the East Indian Railway was in course of construction, under the local superintendence of Mr. Vicars Boyle, who, fortunately, had some knowledge of fortification. He occupied two houses, now known as the Judge's houses, the smaller of which, a two-storied building about 20 yards from the main house, was forthwith fortified and provisioned. The lower windows, etc. were built up, and sand-bags ranged on the roof. When the news came that the mutineers were streaming along the Arrah road, the Europeans and S\u00edkhs retired to the smaller house. The rebels, after pillaging the town, made straight for Mr. Boyle's little fortress. A volley dispersed them, and forced them to seek the shelter of the larger house, only a few yards off, whence they carried on an almost continuous fire. They attempted to burn or smoke out the little garrison, and tried various other safe modes of attack, but they had no guns. Ku\u00e1r Sinh, however, produced two small cannon which he had dug up, and artillery missiles were improvised out of the house furniture. In the small house there was no thought of surrender. Mr. Herwald Wake, the Magistrate, put himself in command of the S\u00edkhs, who, though sorely tempted by their countrymen among the mutineers, remained faithful throughout the siege. A relieving party of 150 European troops, sent by water from Din\u00e1pur, fell into an ambuscade on landing in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d; and as time passed away and no help arrived, provisions and water began to run short. A bold midnight sally resulted in the capture of 4 sheep, and water was obtained by digging a well 18 feet deep inside the house. A mine of the enemy was met by countermining. On the 2nd August, the besieged party observed an unusual excitement in the neighbourhood. The fire of the enemy had slackened, and but few of them were visible. The sound of a distant cannonade was heard. Before sunset the siege was at an end, and on the following morning the gallant garrison welcomed their deliverers\u2014Major Vincent Eyre with 150 men of the 5th Fusiliers, a few mounted volunteers, and 3 guns with 34 artillerymen. Major Eyre\nhad dispersed Ku\u00e1r Sinh's forces on his way to Arrah, and they never rallied.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The chief staple of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is rice, of which three principal crops are grown, namely\u2014the *bhadat* or early crop, which is sown in July or August, and ripens in about sixty days; the *b\u00e1wag*, sown broadcast in June or July, and reaped in November and December; and the *rop\u00e1* or winter crop, which is also sown in June and July, and reaped in December and January. Besides these, a very limited area is planted with *boro* rice, sown in November and cut in April. Many varieties of each rice crop are named. The other crops of the District include\u2014wheat, barley, maize, and other cereals; gram, peas, lentils, and several other green crops; *til*, linseed, castor-oil, and mustard; many kinds of vegetables; cotton, hemp and jute, poppy, sugar-cane, betel-leaf, tobacco, safflower, indigo, etc. Roughly speaking, it may be estimated that of the total area (2,808,400 acres) of the District, 2,200,000 acres are under cultivation. The area usually covered by autumn (*bhadat*) and winter (*aghant*) food crops is about 1,500,000 acres; that occupied by spring or *rabi* food crops, 600,000 acres; and that under other than food staples, 100,000 acres. The area under poppy is about 22,000 acres (average out-turn, 27\u00bd lbs. of opium per acre); that under tobacco, only 300 acres. Wages and prices are reported to have risen, but the figures for early years are not available. The Government irrigation scheme already described has considerably raised the price of labour; and masons, carpenters, and blacksmiths, who before the opening of the canal works earned from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. a day, now make from 6d. to 9d. The rates of rent in 1872 were\u2014for early rice land, on which an after-crop of pulses, vegetables, oil-seeds, etc. is grown, 1s. 7d. to 15s. 10d. an acre; for late rice land, generally a single crop, 3s. 2d. to 15s. 10d. an acre; other food grains, such as wheat, peas, etc., and linseed, 2s. 4\u00bdd. to \u00a31, 11s. 8d. an acre.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is subject to blight, flood, and drought. Blights, although they occasionally cause considerable damage, never occur on such a scale as to affect the general harvest. The Ganges annually overflows its banks; but the principal inundations result from the rising of the Son on the elevated plateau of Central India. Destructive floods have only occurred during the last few years, since a portion of the high land that formerly protected the District was washed away. About one-sixth of the total area is subject to inundation. Droughts arising from deficient rainfall, and the want of an extensive and complete system of irrigation, frequently caused distress previous to the opening of the canal works described above; and four times in the course of five years\u2014in 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1869\u2014drought seriously affected the harvest. The Son Canals have now, as has been stated, secured for the District immunity from future famine.\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District is chiefly carried on by means of permanent markets in the towns, and at fairs. The most frequented of these fairs are held at Barhampur near Raghun\u00e1thpur railway station, Bax\u00e1r, Zakh\u00e1n\u00ed, Dhusariy\u00e1, Padamani\u00e1n, Gadahn\u00ed, Kastar Danwar, Dham\u00e1r, Mas\u00e1rh, and Guptasar. The principal exports are\u2014rice, wheat, barley, pulses, gram, oats, linseed, carraway-seed, paper, and spices; the chief imports\u2014cleaned rice, betel-nut, tobacco, sugar, molasses, salt, pepper, cotton, iron, brass, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and betel-leaf or p\u00e1n. The two great highways of trade to and from the District are the Ganges and the East Indian Railway. The railway runs through the District for a distance of 60 miles, from Koelw\u00e1r station on the Son to Chaus\u00e1 on the Karamn\u00e1ssa, the intermediate stations being Arrah, Bih\u00edy\u00e1, Raghun\u00e1thpur, Dumr\u00e1on, and Bax\u00e1r. The aggregate length of roads in the District in 1876, exclusive of village tracks, was 957 miles, maintained at a total cost of \u00a33610, of which \u00a32062 was derived from imperial and the remainder from local funds. There is a road cess of 1 per cent. on the land revenue of the District. The principal manufactures of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d are sugar, paper, saltpetre, blankets, coarse cotton cloth, and brass utensils. There are 58 sugar refineries (of which 42 are at Nasr\u00edganj), and the amount manufactured in 1872-73 was 965 tons, valued at \u00a328,350. Paper is made at S\u00e1h\u00e1r and Har\u00edharganj, both on the Son; and blankets and carpets in the S\u00e1sser\u00e1m and Bhabu\u00e1 Subdivisions.\n\nAdministration.\u2014So far as can now be ascertained, it would appear that the net revenue of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d increased from \u00a3101,851 in 1790-91 to \u00a3167,277 in 1849-50, and to \u00a3233,978 in 1870-71; while the net expenditure, in like manner, increased from \u00a35627 in 1790-91 to \u00a325,046 in 1849-50, and to \u00a344,158 in 1870-71. The revenue in 1877-78 was \u00a3208,504; and the civil expenditure, \u00a333,387. The land tax forms the principal item of revenue here, as elsewhere in Bengal; and the amount collected increased from \u00a397,508 in 1790 to \u00a3176,273 in 1877-78. The number of estates has just doubled in the same time, being 2330 in 1790, and 4669 in 1871; but the number of proprietors has increased to a much greater extent, namely, from 1289 in 1790 to 21,177 in 1870-71. In the former year, the average amount paid by each proprietor was \u00a380, 14s., and in the latter year, \u00a38. For police purposes, the District is divided into 11 th\u00e1nds or police circles. In 1872, the regular police force numbered 515 officers and men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a39750. There was also a municipal police of 264 officers and men, costing \u00a31689, and a rural police or village watch of 6185 men, costing in money or lands an estimated sum of \u00a39539. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 6964 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 0\u00b763 square mile of the area or to every\n247 persons of the population. The estimated total cost was \u00a320,979, equal to an average of \u00a34, 15s. 8d. per square mile of area and nearly 3d. per head of population. The number of criminal cases conducted by the police in 1872 was 4368; percentage of final convictions, 46\u00b787. The District has 4 jails, which contained in 1872 an average daily number of 411 prisoners. The number of Government and aided schools in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1856-57 was 8, with 354 pupils; in 1870-71, there were only 13 such schools, attended by 589 pupils. Since the latter year, however, owing to the encouragement of primary education by an extension of the grant-in-aid system, the number of Government and aided schools has largely increased. In 1871-72, there were 47 schools, with 1572 pupils; and in 1872-73, there were 207, with 4173 scholars. The number of aided schools in 1877-78 was 282, attended by 7211 pupils. For administrative purposes, the District is divided into 4 Subdivisions; and for fiscal purposes, into 13 pargans.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is fairly healthy. The prevailing endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, bowel complaints, and skin diseases. Cholera and small-pox occur from time to time in an epidemic form.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Tahsil or Subdivision of Hardoi District, Oudh, lying between 27\u00b0 24' and 27\u00b0 47' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 43' and 80\u00b0 21' E. long. Bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District in the North-Western Provinces, on the east by Muhamdi tahsil, on the south by Hardoi tahsil, and on the west by Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District in the North-Western Provinces. Area, 539 square miles, of which 310 are cultivated; pop. (1869), 212,289, namely, 187,121 Hindus and 25,168 Muhammadans; males, 115,138, and females, 97,151; average density of population, 393 per square mile. This Subdivision comprises the 8 pargans of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Alamnagar, Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, Mansurnagar, S\u00e1r\u00e1 (North), Saromannagar, P\u00e1li, and Pachhoha.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by Alamnagar and S\u00e1r\u00e1, the Sukheta river forming the boundary line; on the south by Saromannagar; and on the west by Pachhoha and P\u00e1li, from which it is separated by the Garra river. Area, 131 square miles, of which 81 are cultivated. Chief products\u2014wheat, barley, b\u00e1jra, gram, jodr, rice, arhar, and sugar-cane. At the time of the revenue survey, wheat occupied about one-third of the cultivated area; barley and b\u00e1jra each about a tenth; and gram, jodr, and rice together about a fourth. Pop. (1869), 67,464, namely, 56,187 Hindus and 11,459 Muhammadans. Of the 143 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 72 are held by Muhammadans, 25\u00bd by Br\u00e1hmans, 21\u00bd by Kshattriyas, 9 by K\u00e1yasths, 1 by Gos\u00e1ins, 1 by Europeans, and 13 by\nthe Government. The varieties of tenure are\u2014iddukd\u0101r\u012b, 26 villages; samind\u0101r\u012b, 82; and pattidd\u0101r\u012b, 35. Government land revenue, \u00a39342, equal to an average of 3s. 7\u00bdd. per cultivated acre, or 2s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of total area. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs through the pargan\u0101, with a station near Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d town. The country was originally in the hands of the Thatheras, whose chief settlement seems to have been at and around Angni Khera, on the site of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d town. They are said to have been dispossessed in the 8th century A.D. by a band of Br\u00e1hmans, who were on a pilgrimage from Benares to Hardw\u00e1r. The Br\u00e1hmans retained possession of Angni Khera and the surrounding country till the reign of Aurangzeb, when, having plundered a convoy of treasure on its way to Delhi, a retaliatory expedition was sent out under an Afgh\u00e1n chief, Diler Kh\u00e1n, who surprised the Br\u00e1hmans at a bathing festival, slew them, and took possession of their lands, which were confirmed to them by the Delhi Emperor. Diler Kh\u00e1n founded the town of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d on the old site of Angni Khera, which he filled with his Afgh\u00e1n kinsmen and troops, assigning them jungle grants in the neighbourhood. Diler Kh\u00e1n's family gradually extended their possessions, acquiring, either by purchase, mortgage, fraud, or force, every village in the pargan\u0101, which they held as proprietors till some fifty or sixty years ago, when the family began to decay and the estate to fall to pieces. The old proprietors in some cases succeeded in recovering possession of their villages, mostly by purchase from the Naw\u00e1b's family. The descendants of Diler Kh\u00e1n, however, still hold possession of more than one-half of the pargan\u0101.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, and headquarters of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil and pargan\u0101; situated on the road from Lucknow to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, 15 miles from the latter town, in lat. 27\u00b0 38' 25\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 59' 5\" E. The most populous town in the District, and the fourth largest in the Province. Pop. (1869) 18,254, including 10,741 Hindus and 7,540 Muhammadans, residing in 985 masonry and 3,668 mud-built houses. The town is divided into several wards or mahallas, named for the most part after the followers and companions in arms of the founder, Diler Kh\u00e1n. It has declined in importance during the past hundred years, the inhabitants dating the decay from the decline of the Delhi Empire, and the rise of Oudh to independence. The present population is said to be only one-third of what it was formerly. Tieffenthaler describes Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, about 1770 A.D., as 'of considerable circuit, and nearly in the middle is a palace of brick strengthened with towers like a fortress (the Bari Deorhi constructed by Diler Kh\u00e1n), with a vestibule and spacious covered colonnade. Most of the houses are of brick, and there is a fine mosque built of the same material, and enclosed by a wall. The town extends a mile from north\nto south, its breadth is something less, but of its flourishing state little remains.' When visited by Tennant in 1799, it was an expanse of ruins, 'that appeared in the form of hills, and broken, crumbling to dust.' Heber found it in 1824 'a considerable town, or almost city, with the remains of fortifications and many large houses.' Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is connected with Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1h\u00e1npur, P\u00e1li, S\u00e1ndi, Hardoi, and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed by unmetalled roads; it is also a station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The Subdivisional courts and police station are placed in the enclosure of the Jam\u00e1 Masj\u00edd, a mosque built by Diler Kh\u00e1n. Anglo-vernacular school, dispensary, and sard\u00ed (travellers' rest-house). No trade or manufacture of importance. Several markets are held in the different wards.\n\nThe following account of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1850 is quoted from Sir W. Sleeman's Tour through Oudh, vol. ii. pp. 46-47; it is interesting as giving the origin of the chronic ill-feeling that exists between the Muhammadans and Hindus\u2014which broke out into a riot at the Muharram festival of 1868:\u2014'Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is a very ancient and large town, occupied chiefly by Path\u00e1n Musalm\u00e1ns, who are a very turbulent and fanatical set of fellows. Subsukh R\u00e1i, a Hindu, and the most respectable merchant in the District, resided here, and for some time consented to officiate as the deputy of poor old H\u00e1fiz Abdull\u00e1 for the management of the town, where his influence was great. He had lent a good deal of money to the heads of some of the Path\u00e1n families of the town; but finding few of them disposed to repay, he was last year obliged to refuse further loans. They determined to take advantage of the coming Muharram festival to revenge the affront, as men commonly do who live among such a fanatical community. The t\u00e1s\u00edas are commonly taken up and carried in procession ten days after the new moon is first seen at any place where they are made; but in Oudh, all go by the day in which the moon is seen from the capital of Lucknow. As soon as she is seen at Lucknow, the king issues an order throughout his dominions for the t\u00e1s\u00edas to be taken in procession ten days after. The moon was this year, in November, first seen on the 30th of the month at Lucknow; but at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, where the sky is generally clearer, she had been seen on the 29th. The men to whom Subsukh R\u00e1i had refused further loans determined to take advantage of this incident to wreak their vengeance; and when the deputy promulgated the king's order for the t\u00e1s\u00edas to be taken in procession ten days after the 30th, they instigated all the Muhammadans of the town to insist upon taking them out ten days after the 29th, and persuaded them that the order had been fabricated or altered by the malice of their Hindu deputy to insult their religious feelings. They were taken out accordingly; and having to pass the house of Subsukh R\u00e1i, when their excitement or spirit of religious fervour had reached the\nhighest pitch, they there put them down, broke open the doors, entered in a crowd, and plundered it of all the property they could find, amounting to about 70,000 rupees. Subsukh R\u00e1\u00ed was obliged to get out with his family at a back door, and run for his life. He went to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, in our territory, and put himself under the protection of the Magistrate. Not content with all this, they built a small miniature mosque at the door with some loose bricks, so that no one could go either out or in without the risk of knocking it down, or so injuring this mock mosque as to rouse, or enable the evil-minded to rouse, the whole Muhammadan population against the offender. Poor Subsukh R\u00e1\u00ed has been utterly ruined, and ever since seeking in vain for redress. The Government is neither disposed nor able to afford it, and the poor boy who has now succeeded his learned father in the contract is helpless. The little mock mosque of uncedented bricks still stands as a monument of the insolence of the Muhammadan population, and the weakness and apathy of the Oudh Government.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Municipal town in Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 10' N., long. 76\u00b0 55' E.; pop. (1868), 11,678, consisting of 4125 Hindus, 6520 Muhammadans, 1028 Sikhs, and 5 Christians. Founded by one of the followers of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori about 1086 A.D. Well built of brick, and ornamented by several handsome mansions of Sikh sard\u00e1rs. Important Sikh family, descended from Karm Sinh, immigrated hither in 1759. Government resumed half the estate on failure of heirs in 1863; the remainder passed to two cousins, representatives of another branch of the family. Inhabitants principally engaged in agriculture; no manufactures; local grain trade. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3261, or 5\u00bdd. per head of population (11,653) within municipal limits.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Kashm\u00edr (Cashmere) State, Punjab. Lat. 33\u00b0 32' N., long. 75\u00b0 16' E. Thornton states that it was a favourite residence of the early Mughal Emperors, but now suffered to fall into decay. Stands in the midst of a fruitful and picturesque valley, famous for producing the finest wheat in Kashm\u00edr. B\u00e1s\u00e1r, with a few shops. Elevation above sea level, 5600 feet.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1s\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay. Pop. (1872), 6268.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1da.\u2014Chief town of the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1da Subdivision, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay; situated 48 miles north-west of Dhulia. Together with Kukdel, it contained in 1872 a population of 5212. It is a municipal town, with an average income of about \u00a3248. Post office.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1p\u00far.\u2014Town in S\u00e1ngli, one of the Southern Marhatt\u00e1 States, Bombay. Lat. 15\u00b0 50' 5\" N., long. 74\u00b0 33' 56\" E.; pop. (1872), 11,265.\n\nSh\u00e1hbandar.\u2014Sub-District of Kar\u00e1chi District, Sind, lying between 23\u00b0 35' and 25\u00b0 N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 20' and 68\u00b0 48' E. long.\nArea, 3378 square miles; pop. (1872), 103,887, but allowing for recent transfers, 102,936, including 90,349 Muhammadans and 12,575 Hindus.\n\nSh\u00e1hbandar consists mainly of a flat, alluvial plain, forming part of the delta of the Indus, and cut up by numerous creeks, the chief of which are the Kori channel (which is believed to have been formerly a mouth of the Eastern N\u00e1r\u00e1), and the Piny\u00e1ri or Sir river. Large tracts in this Division are covered with mangrove and tamarisk jungle. The south-western portion is annually inundated, and the belt bordering the sea affords excellent grazing ground for large herds of buffaloes. Number of canals in Sh\u00e1hbandar, 152, with an aggregate length of about 800 miles. There are 13 Government forests, with an area of 38,287 acres. Game and fish abound. The principal crops of the Sub-District are rice, occupying 76 per cent. of the total cultivated area, and b\u00e1jira, 13 per cent. The average yield per acre of cleaned rice on good land is about 560 lbs. Wheat, cotton, tobacco, and sugar-cane are also grown. The area of land held in j\u00e1g\u00edr, or revenue-free, is estimated at 45,000 acres. The annual value of the imports, which are principally cloth, grain, drugs, oil, ghi, sugar, tobacco, pepper, betel-nut, and copper and brass vessels, is estimated at about \u00a335,000; and the exports, mainly agricultural produce, at \u00a370,000. The manufactures comprise salt, coarse blankets, and leathern and iron goods. Thirteen fairs. Aggregate length of roads, 350 miles; number of ferries, 34.\n\nIn 1873-74, the total revenue of Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-District amounted to \u00a334,530, of which \u00a330,562 was derived from imperial and \u00a33968 from local sources. The chief items are the land tax, abk\u00e1ri or excise, and stamp duties. Total number of police, 160. Subordinate civil court at Mirpur Batoro. There are 8 municipal towns, viz. Mirpur Batoro, Mugalbhin (Mogul Bim), Sh\u00e1hbandar, Suj\u00e1wal, Bano, Chuhan Jam\u00e1li, Daro, and Gung\u00e1ni. Subordinate jails at Mirpur Batoro, Belo, Mugalbhin, and Sh\u00e1hbandar. Number of Government schools, 3, with a total of 109 pupils. Prevalent diseases, intermittent fevers. Dispensary at Mirpur Batoro.\n\nSh\u00e1hbandar.\u2014T\u00e1luk of the Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-District, Kar\u00e1chi District, Sind. Area, 699 square miles; pop. (1872), 21,046. Gross revenue (1873-74), \u00a39385.\n\nSh\u00e1hbandar (King's Port).\u2014Chief town of the t\u00e1luk of the same name in Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-District, Kar\u00e1chi, Sind; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 10' N., and long. 67\u00b0 56' E., in the delta of the Indus, 30 miles south-west of Mugalbhin, and 33 miles south of Suj\u00e1wal. Pop. (1872), 1203, including 469 Muhammadans and 732 Hindus. Sh\u00e1hbandar stood formerly on the east bank of the Malir, one of the mouths of the Indus, but it is at present 10 miles distant from the nearest point of\nthe river. The great salt waste commences about a mile to the south-east of the town, and on its westward side are extensive jungles of long bin grass. It was to Sh\u00e1hbandar that the English factory was removed from Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d when this latter place was deserted by the Indus; and previous to the abandonment of the factory in 1775, it supported an establishment of 14 vessels for the navigation of the river. The disastrous flood which occurred about 1819 caused material changes in the lower part of the Indus, and hastened the decay of Sh\u00e1hbandar, which is now an insignificant village. Carless states that the native rulers of Sind had a fleet of 15 ships stationed here. Vessels entered by the Richal, the only accessible mouth, and passing into the Haj\u00e1mro through what is now the Khedew\u00e1ri creek, ascended that stream to about 10 miles above Ghoreb\u00e1ri, where it joined the Malir. Sh\u00e1hbandar is the headquarters of a mukht\u00ed\u00e1rk\u00e1r and of a t\u00e1pp\u00e1dd\u00e1r; police th\u00e1n\u00e1 or circle, with a force of 13 men.

Gross revenue (1873-74), \u00a310,868.\n\nSh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur.\u2014Chief town of Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur t\u00e1luk, Haidar\u00e1bd District, Sind; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 56' N., and long. 68\u00b0 40' E., on the J\u00e1mwah Canal, 15 miles north-east of H\u00e1la, and 40 miles north-east of Haidar\u00e1bd city. Pop. (1872), 2232, including 756 Muhammadans and 1250 Hindus. Seat of a subordinate judge's court, and of a mukht\u00ed\u00e1rk\u00e1r's office, with the usual public buildings. Local trade in grain, oil-seeds, sugar, and cloth, valued at \u00a36000; transit trade in b\u00e1jra, wheat, rice, and cotton, valued at about \u00a310,000. Chief manufacture, oil. Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur is said to have been founded two centuries ago by one M\u00edr Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1d.\n\nSh\u00e1h Dheri.\u2014Village and ruins in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab.\u2014See Deri SHAHAN.\n\nSh\u00e1hdra.\u2014Village in Lahore District, Punjab. Pop. (1868), 4370. Stands in lat. 31\u00b0 40' N., and long. 74\u00b0 20' E., on the west bank of the R\u00e1vi, nearly opposite Lahore city. Contains the mausoleum of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and his wife N\u00far J\u00e1n, and the tomb of Asaf Kh\u00e1n, brother of the empress, in a beautiful garden, a favourite resort of the residents of Lahore. The Sikhs committed great depredations upon all the buildings, carrying off much of the marble facings and enamelled work to decorate their own temple at Amritsar (Umritsur). Sh\u00e1hdra is at present occupied by a large colony of Europeans in connection with the works of the Punjab Northern State Railway.\n\nSh\u00e1hdw\u00e1ra.\u2014Town in Meerut (M\u00edr\u00e1th) District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 7257, consisting of 5683 Hindus and 1574 Muhammadans.

Founded by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, who gave it its present name of 'Royal Gate,' and designed it as an emporium for the supply of grain to his troops. Sacked by Sur\u00e1j Mall J\u00e1t, of Bhartpur, and plundered by the soldiers of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni just before the battle of P\u00e1nipat. Manufacture of sweetmeats. Large trade in shoes and leather; considerable sugar refineries. Police station, post office. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3583; from taxes, \u00a3262, or 8\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nSh\u00e1hganj.\u2014Town in Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces.

Founded by a Mughal on the village land of Mukimpur; seized by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Darshan Sinh, whose fort and residence became celebrated during the Mutiny of 1857. Pop. (1869), 3744, consisting of 3077 Hindus and 667 Muhammadans. Mosque, 2 temples, and vernacular school.\n\nSh\u00e1hgarh.\u2014Chief town of a tract bearing the same name in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 19' N., and long. 79\u00b0 E., 40 miles north-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town. Originally part of the Gond kingdom of M\u00e1ndla, it continued till 1857 to be the headquarters of an independent chief of ancient lineage. (See SAGAR DISTRICT.) Sh\u00e1hgarh stands at the foot of a lofty hill range, with jungle on nearly every side. The small fort, now in ruins, on the east of the village, contained the R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace. At the villages of B\u00e1ret\u00e1, Amarmau, H\u00edr\u00e1p\u00far, and Tigor\u00e1, all in the north of the tract, iron-ore is smelted and sent to Cawnpore. Markets are held every Tuesday and Saturday; and Sh\u00e1hgarh has a Government boys' school, girls' school, and dispensary.\n\nSh\u00e1hi.\u2014Canal in the Punjab.\u2014See Hasli.\n\nSh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 35' and 28\u00b0 28' 15\" N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 23' and 80\u00b0 25' 45\" E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1877-78, 1744 square miles; population (according to the same authority), 949,471 souls. Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur forms the easternmost District of the Rohilkhand Division. It is bounded on the north by Bareilly (Bareli), on the east by the Oudh Districts of Hardoi and Kheri, on the south by the Ganges, and on the west by Bud\u00e1un and Bareilly (Bareli). The administrative headquarters are at the city of SHAHJAHANPUR.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur consists of a long and narrow tract, running upward from the Ganges towards the Him\u00e1layas, nearly at right angles to the river system of the Rohilkhand plain. Hence its natural features depend almost entirely upon the various streams which have cut themselves deep channels\nthrough the alluvial soil of the Gangetic basin. The north-eastern corner, beyond the Gumti, presents an appearance not unlike that of the tar\u00e1\u00ed or damp submontane belt. A large area still remains under forest, or lies otherwise waste. A scanty population inhabits this unhealthy and malarious tract; but water rises close to the surface, and the natural fertility of the soil is only marred by the feverish exhalations. The next section, between the Gumti and the Khanaut, passes from a rather wild and unhealthy northern region to a densely inhabited strip along the southern river, consisting of a productive loam, well cultivated with sugar-cane and other remunerative crops. The Khanaut falls into the Deoha just below Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur; and the triangle enclosed between the confluent streams, though fertile in the immediate neighbourhood of their valleys, consists of a thinly peopled country, much overgrown with thorn and dh\u00e1k jungle. The section between the Deoha and the Gar\u00e1i comprises much marshy land; but south of the latter river, the country rises in a sandy ridge, till it reaches the valley of the R\u00e1mganga, through which the stream wanders in changing courses, destroying and re-forming its banks with great rapidity. Thence to the Ganges stretches a continuous lowland, consisting of marshy patches, alternating with a stiff clay soil, and requiring irrigation in parts. Cultivation is here less easy and less remunerative. The R\u00e1mganga forms the main waterway of the District, being navigable as far as Kola Gh\u00e1t, near Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, whence considerable quantities of cereals and pulses are shipped in country boats by Cawnpore traders for the Ganges ports. A few swampy lakes (jh\u00edls) in the lower portions of the District afford irrigation for the spring crops in their neighbourhood. No large pasture grounds exist anywhere, but cattle are sent in large herds from the northern pargan\u00e1s to graze in Nep\u00e1l during the cold weather, returning again at the commencement of the rains.\n\nHistory.\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur possesses little separate history of its own before the annexation by the British in 1801. During the early Musal-m\u00e1n times, it always formed part of Kather proper, nearly the whole of its pargan\u00e1s lying east of the R\u00e1mganga; and it was then included under the government of Bud\u00e1un. Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur town was founded in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n by Naw\u00e1b Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n, who named it in honour of the Emperor. About 1720, \u00c1l\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n, who had risen into power at the head of his Rohill\u00e1 clansmen, defeated the Governors of Bareilly (Bareli) and Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d, and himself assumed the rule of those two Districts, together with Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. On his death in 1751, H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, the guardian of his sons, became leader of the Rohill\u00e1s, and defeated the imperial troops sent against him. Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur remained under the Bareilly authorities till 1774, when the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh overran Rohilkhand with\nthe aid of Warren Hastings. The Rohill\u00e1s, however, had never gained complete control over the eastern portion of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District, though their power was firmly established in the west. The Gaur or Kathariya Th\u00e1kurs also retained their independence among the wild wastes of the north. Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, indeed, lying on the border between Oudh and Rohilkhand, formed a sort of debateable land between the two Provinces; but the sympathies and connections of the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur Path\u00e1ns lay always with Oudh rather than with the Rohill\u00e1s. The Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs held Rohilkhand from 1774 till 1801, when it was ceded to the English by the treaty of L\u00e1l Dh\u00e1ng.\n\nThenceforward, our rule was never disturbed until the Mutiny, although the District bordered upon the most turbulent part of Oudh. In 1857, however, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur became the scene of open rebellion. The news of the Meerut (M\u00edrath) outbreak arrived on the 15th of May; but all remained quiet till the 25th, when the sepoys informed their officers that the mob intended to plunder the treasury. Precautions were taken against such an attempt; but on the 31st, while most of the officers, civil and military, were at church, some of the sepoys forced their way into the building and attacked them. Three Europeans were shot down at once; the remainder closed the doors, and aided by their servants, together with a hundred faithful sepoys, held the church against the mutineers. The other officers then joined them, and the whole party escaped, first to Paw\u00e1yan, and afterwards to Muhamdi. The mutineers burnt the station, plundered the treasury, and made their way to the centre of local disaffection at Bareilly. A rebel Government, under K\u00e1dir Ali Kh\u00e1n, was proclaimed on the 1st of June. On the 18th, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n, the hereditary Naw\u00e1b of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, passed through on his way to Bareilly, where he was appointed N\u00e1zim of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur by Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n. On the 23rd, the Naw\u00e1b returned to his titular post, and superseded K\u00e1dir Al\u00ed. He remained in power from June 1857 till January 1858, when our troops took Fatehgarh. The Naw\u00e1b of Fatehgarh and Firoz Sh\u00e1h then fled to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and on to Bareilly. After the fall of Lucknow, the N\u00e1na S\u00e1hib also fled to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, but remained only ten days, and proceeded onward to Bareilly. In January, the Naw\u00e1b put to death H\u00e1mid Hassan Kh\u00e1n, Deputy Collector, and Muhammad Hassan, subordinate judge, for corresponding with the English. On the 30th of April 1858, the British force under Lord Clyde reached Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The rebels fled to Muhamdi, and the British went on to Bareilly on the 2nd of May, leaving only a small detachment to guard the station. The rebels then assembled once more, and besieged our troops for nine days; but Brigadier Jones' column relieved them on the 12th, and authority was then finally re-established.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1853 returned the total number of\ninhabitants at 986,096 persons. That of 1865 showed an increase to the number of 1,018,117, being a gain of 32,021 persons, or 3\u00b72 per cent. The Census of 1872 gave the population as 949,579, showing an apparent decrease of 68,538 persons, or 7\u00b72 per cent., since 1865; and of 36,517 persons, or 3\u00b78 per cent., in the whole nineteen years. These results, however, are very fallacious when compared with the area, which increased by 20 square miles in the first twelve years, and decreased by 605 square miles, or 35\u00b71 per cent., in the last seven years, owing to the transfer of Puranpur pargan\u00e1 to Bareilly District. The real rate of increase may best be seen from the figures representing the density of population, which amounted to 427 persons per square mile in 1853, to 437 in 1865, and to 551 in 1872. But here again it must be borne in mind that the pargan\u00e1 transferred to Bareilly, lying close to the foot of the Him\u00e1layas in the pestilential tard\u00ed, had a much sparser population than any other portion of the District. Although the area of the District is returned in the Administration Report for 1877-78 at 1744 square miles and the population at 949,471, the Census of 1872 was taken as extending over an area of 1723 square miles, and disclosed a population of 949,579, distributed among 2180 villages or townships, and inhabiting 188,958 houses. From these data the following averages, taken from the Census Report, may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 551; villages per square mile, 1\u00b73; houses per square mile, 109; persons per village, 436; persons per house, 5. Classified according to sex, there were (exclusive of non-Asiatics)\u2014males, 511,136; females, 438,235; proportion of males, 54\u00b71 per cent. Classified according to age, there were (with the same omission), under 12 years\u2014males, 176,662; females, 155,118; total children, 331,780, or 35\u00b799 per cent. of the whole native population: above 12 years\u2014males, 334,474; females, 283,217; total adults, 617,691, or 64\u00b701 per cent. of the whole native population. As regards religious distinctions, the Hindus numbered 822,576, or 86\u00b76 per cent., and the Muhammadans 126,599, or 13\u00b74 per cent. The District also contained 296 Christians. As regards ethnical and caste distinctions, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 63,120; R\u00e1jputs, 69,222; Bani\u00e1s, 14,600; Ah\u00edrs, 65,232; Cham\u00e1rs, 109,448; K\u00e1yasths, 12,323; and Kurmis, 28,248. Among the Muhammadans, 13,773 ranked as Shaikhs, 3325 Sayyids, 1167 Mughals, and 41,564 Path\u00e1ns. In the central portion of the District, the people are well off, and inhabit a richly cultivated plain, scarcely inferior to that of the Do\u00e1b. In the extreme north, however, agriculture is backward, waste tracts are numerous, and the people are poor and miserable, like their neighbours in the tard\u00ed. In the south, also, where the swampy tract between the R\u00e1mganga and the Ganges alternates with stretches of stiff clay, the condition of the agricultural classes is much less prosperous. The\nDistrict contains 7 towns with a population exceeding 5000, namely\u2014Shahjahanpur, 72,140; Pawayan, 6109; Tilhar, 5317; Hindupatti, 6009; Jalalabad, 7129; Miranpur Katra, 6529; and Kant, 5006. Most of these towns are of quite modern origin, dating back no more than 200 years, while all the older cities have fallen into utter ruin.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The course of tillage follows the ordinary rule of the North-Western Provinces, consisting of the kharif or autumn harvest\u2014chief staples, cotton, rice, bajra, and jodar; and the rabi or spring harvest, including wheat, barley, oats, vetch, and peas. Sugar-cane is grown in the low-lying lands, and Indian corn on ground capable of bearing two crops a year. Manure is employed where obtainable, but the poverty of the cultivators seldom permits them to let their land lie fallow. The land tenures belong to the standard types of the Province. The country, however, has been too recently occupied to have acquired such complicated holdings or undergone such minute subdivision as in the Lower Do\u00e1b. The horned cattle of the District are small and weak, so that good draught oxen can only be obtained by importation from beyond the Ganges. Government has made several attempts to improve the breed, but the natives show no disposition to avail themselves of the facilities offered to them. Neither wages nor prices have exhibited much tendency to rise of late years; but whatever change has taken place has been in favour of the labouring classes. Smiths received 4\u00bdd. per diem in 1852, and 6d. in 1872; labourers obtained 2\u00bdd. at the former date, and 3d. at the latter. Prices of food grains ruled as follows in 1876:\u2014Wheat, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; bajra, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.; rice, 8 sers per rupee, or 14s. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur suffers from drought and famine, though its proximity to the hills sometimes saves it from the worst extremities to which neighbouring Districts are exposed. The great famine of 1783-84, though severely felt in Rohilkhand, did not press so heavily upon this Division as upon Agra and the south-west. In 1803-04, two years after the cession, rain completely failed for the autumn crops. In 1825-26, drought again occurred, but did not bring about famine in the strictest sense. In 1837-38, the autumn rains failed, but a slight fall in February saved the harvest in part, though great dearth of grain ensued. The famine of 1860-61 was severely felt throughout Rohilkhand, and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur suffered like its neighbours, though it escaped the extreme misery which fell upon the contiguous District of Bud\u00e1un.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway is the main channel for the commerce of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. It enters the District near Kahilia, and leaves it near Fatehganj, after a course\nof 28 miles within its limits. There are stations at Kahilia, Rosa Junction, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Tilhar, and Miranpur Katra. Three metalled roads also form great arteries of traffic, namely, that from Paw\u00e1yan through Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d; from Lucknow to Bareilly via Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Tilhar; and from Fatehgarh through Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d to Miranpur Katra. Cereals and pulses are carried down the R\u00e1mganga by Cawnpore traders, who send their boats to Kolagh\u00e1t, near Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d. Grain and raw sugar are conveyed on the Deo\u0445\u0430 from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. Some through traffic exists from Pilibh\u00edt, where boats are built and despatched down stream, laden with produce. A considerable quantity of timber is also floated down from Pilibh\u00edt. Sugar, the chief export of the District, formerly went by cart to Agra and other trans-Jumna marts, salt and cotton being imported in return; but most of this traffic now finds an outlet by the railway, which also conveys the cotton from Chandausi, the chief market for that staple in Rohilkhand. European goods and metals form the main items of import trade. The principal manufacture under European superintendence is that of sugar, started thirty years ago at the Rosa factory, near Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, by Messrs. Carew & Co. The factory was destroyed during the Mutiny, but was restored, and has been continued ever since. The annual value of the out-turn amounts to about \u00a360,000; and the concern employs 4 Europeans, 1000 labourers, and 5000 carts. Rum is also distilled and sold to the Commissariat Department to a large amount.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur is the seat of a Civil and Sessions Judge, whose civil jurisdiction extends over the whole District, and includes also the four eastern pargan\u00e1s of Bud\u00e1un. He holds criminal sessions at Bud\u00e1un town alternately with the Judge of Bareilly. The District staff comprises a Collector-Magistrate, a Joint Magistrate, Assistant Magistrate, and an uncovenanted Deputy Magistrate, besides a sub-deputy opium agent, and the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary officials. The total amount of revenue, imperial, municipal, and local, raised in the District in 1876 amounted to \u00a3191,508, or 3s. 10\u00bdd. per head of the population. Of this sum, the land tax contributed \u00a3118,442. In the year 1875, the regular police force consisted of 672 officers and men, being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 3'16 square miles and to every 14'12 of the population; the total cost was \u00a37991, or \u00a33, 8s. per square mile and 2d. per head of population. The District jail at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur contained during the same year a daily average of 332 prisoners, of whom 12 were females. The average cost per head amounted to \u00a33, 7s. 5\u00bdd., and the average earnings of each prisoner to 8s. Postal communication is carried on by 9 imperial and 10 local post offices; and the telegraph is in operation at all the stations on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The educa-\ntional returns in 1875 showed a total of 202 schools, with a roll of 6218 pupils; being at the rate of 1 school to every 8\u00b752 square miles, and 6\u00b75 pupils to every thousand of the population. Thirteen of these were girls' schools. The total expenditure on education was returned at \u00a34136, of which \u00a31631 was provided from the Provincial treasury and \u00a32505 from local sources. Government maintains 5 tahsili schools, with a roll of 5184 pupils, at an average cost of 12s. 2d. per head. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is subdivided into 4 tahsils and 12 parganas. It contained in 1875-76 two municipalities, Shahjahanpur and Tilhar, with an aggregate revenue of \u00a38507; from taxes, \u00a36665, or 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of the population (98,312) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Shahjahanpur is much damper than that of the Upper Do\u00e1b, and somewhat more so than the other portions of the Rohilkhand plain. Six weeks seldom pass at any time of the year without a fall of rain; and the prevailing wind sets easterly from the cloudy summits of the Him\u00e1layas. The heat during the hot months does not equal that of the neighbouring Districts, and warm winds seldom blow for more than five or six days in each year. Except in May and June, the country has a fresh and green aspect, very unlike the parched brown stretches of the Do\u00e1b. The average rainfall for the ten years ending 1873 amounted to 37 inches, the maximum during that period being 54\u00b75 inches in 1867, and the minimum 18\u00b73 inches in 1868. Except in the extreme north, near the tar\u00e1di, the climate generally is healthy; but fever and ague prevail in that portion of the District every spring and autumn. The valley of the Sot is also very malarious. The total number of deaths reported in 1875 was 23,844, or 25\u00b711 per thousand of the population. The District contains 5 medical dispensaries\u2014at Shahjahanpur, Katra, Gularia, Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Tilhar. In 1875, they afforded relief to 19,002 persons, of whom 936 were in-door patients.\n\nShahjahanpur.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Shahjahanpur District, North-Western Provinces. Area, 401 square miles, of which 286 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 279,083; land revenue, \u00a329,073; total Government revenue, \u00a331,980; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a352,375.\n\nShahjahanpur.\u2014Municipal town and administrative headquarters of Shahjahanpur District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 72,140, including 34,511 Hindus and 37,538 Muhammadans. Lies in lat. 27\u00b0 52\u2032 55\u2033 N., and long. 79\u00b0 56\u2032 50\u2033 E.; on the left bank of the river Deo\u0445\u0430, crowning the high ground just above its junction with the Khanaut. An old fort overhangs the confluence; and a large masonry bridge, built by Hak\u00edm Mehndi Ali, spans the smaller river. The city was founded during the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n by Naw\u00e1b Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n. Scene of an outbreak during the Mutiny of 1857 (see\nConsiderable export of cereals, pulses, and sugar. Large out-turn of sugar and rum from the Rosa factory, near the city, the property of Messrs. Carew & Co. Several stately old mosques, now somewhat out of repair. Municipal revenue, in 1875-76, \u00a37118; from taxes, \u00a35707, or 1s. 5\u00bdd. per head of population (79,487) within municipal limits.\n\nShah-ki-dheri.\u2014Village and ruins in Rawal Pindi District, Punjab. \u2014See Deri Shahan.\n\nSh\u00e1hlimar.\u2014Gardens and pleasure-ground in Lahore District, Punjab; situated in the village of B\u00e1ghampur, 5 miles east of Lahore city. Lat. 31\u00b0 35' N., long. 74\u00b0 23' E. Laid out by Al\u00ed Mardan Kh\u00e1n, the celebrated engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, in imitation of the garden planned by Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr at the sources of the Jhelum (Jh\u00edlam), in Kashmir (Cashmere). The buildings fell into ruin during the latter period of the Mughal Empire, but were restored by Ranjit Sinh, who substituted stucco for the original marble of the central pavilion.\n\nSh\u00e1hpur.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 32' and 32\u00b0 42' N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 37' and 73\u00b0 21' E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879, 4700 square miles; population (1868), 368,796 souls. Sh\u00e1hpur forms the southernmost District of the Rawal Pindi Division. It is bounded on the north by the District of Jhelum (Jh\u00edlam), on the east by Gujrat and the river Chen\u00e1b, on the south by Jhang, and on the west and north-west by Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Bannu (Bunnoo). The administrative headquarters are at the small town of Sh\u00e1hpur on the Jhelum river, but Bhera is the largest place in the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Sh\u00e1hpur consists of an irregular block of country, artificially demarcated for administrative purposes, and stretching from the western bank of the Chen\u00e1b, across the valley of the Jhelum, far into the heart of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b, and up to the centre of the Salt Range. On either side of the Jhelum, which divides the District into two nearly equal portions, lie wide upland plains, utterly barren or covered only with low brushwood. Nearly 90 per cent. of the area still remains untouched by the hand of man. But although so large a portion of the surface consists of native desert, considerable variety exists in the aspect of the country. Beginning from the south-eastern border, the first well-marked natural tract comprises the lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b, where percolation from the river spreads fertility over a long belt about 10 or 12 miles in width, along the whole of its course. Above these fruitful and well-watered levels, the b\u00e1r or central tableland of the Jetch Do\u00e1b stretches in a monotonous undulating waste of desert or jungle to the valley of the Jhelum. The soil of this upland is naturally good; but the impossibility of obtaining water precludes all hope of cultivation, except in a\nfew hollow basins, where the crops depend upon the capricious rainfall for their whole supply. Numerous herds of cattle, however, roam at will over the prairie jungles, and obtain abundant pasturage from the luxuriant carpet of grass which covers the surface after the rains. A second zone of cultivation fringes either bank of the Jhelum, though not extending so far inland as on the Chen\u00e1b. The lowland strips on both sides of the Jetch Do\u00e1b are popularly divided into the *hethar*, or alluvial tract immediately bordering the river, and the *nakka*, or slope just beyond the range of percolation. The former contains the most prosperous villages, and is covered throughout its entire length by one unbroken sheet of grain for the *rabi* or spring harvest, without the necessity for artificial irrigation; the latter depends upon the water supply from wells, and has smaller and more straggling villages, scattered at wide distances from one another. Beyond the Jhelum valley rises a second tableland, the *thal* of the Sind S\u00e1gar Do\u00e1b, a far more forbidding and desert expanse than the *b\u00e1r*. Northward, a hard level plain, impregnated in places with salt, and almost devoid of vegetation, stretches away monotonously to the foot of the Salt Range. To the east and south, a sandy plateau runs onward till it merges in the utter desert of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. The extreme southern portion resembles an angry sea of sand, tossed into wave-like hillocks, between which lie undulating troughs of short coarse grass. The north is occupied by a part of the Salt Range, which runs right across the Do\u00e1b, and rises to its greatest height in Mount Sakeswar, 5000 feet above sea level. It consists of two divergent chains, which unite again at either end, and enclose a number of rock-bound alluvial basins, interspersed with picturesque lakes. Little patches of rich cultivation are found amid the nooks and valleys of the range, rendered fruitful by the fresh alluvial *detritus* from the surrounding peaks, and watered by the comparatively abundant rainfall of the hill tract. The southern face of the range presents a bold mass of broken and rugged cliffs, whose distorted strata and huge detached rocks give an air of great sublimity to the scenery. Many torrents flow through the gorges on its side, and spread fertility over a narrow strip of lowland at the base, known as the *moh\u00e1r*. Thence an intermediate belt of pasture land, the *danda*, leads on imperceptibly to the wild sandy waste of the *thal*. Tigers, leopards, and wolves frequent the Salt Range, while small game and antelope abound among the thick jungle of the *b\u00e1r*.\n\n**History.**\u2014Though little definite information can be recovered with regard to the annals of Sh\u00e1hpur District prior to the decline of the Mughal dynasty, the numerous remains studded about the *b\u00e1r* clearly prove that at some remote period the whole country between the Chen\u00e1b and the Jhelum consisted of a flourishing and well-watered\nagricultural plain. Mounds of earth, covered with fragments of brick or pottery, lie scattered over the whole tableland, and mark the ancient sites of towns and villages in a tract now only inhabited by half-savage pastoral tribes. The historians of Alexander speak of the country as 'teeming with population;' and local tradition affirms that so late as the time of Akbar, great prosperity extended over the entire b\u00e1r. The present desert condition of the plateau may perhaps be referred to a gradual depression of the water level. But the dawn of authentic history in Sh\u00e1hpur extends no further back than the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, when R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i, a R\u00e1jput of the Anand tribe, administered Bhera and the surrounding country; while Khush\u00e1b was managed by Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, and the south-eastern tract along the Chen\u00e1b formed part of the territories under the charge of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Kaura Mall, Governor of M\u00falt\u00e1n. At the same time, the thal was included among the dominions of the Baluch families of Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan.\n\nDuring the anarchic period which succeeded the disruption of the Mughal Empire, even this remote region became the scene of Sikh and Afgh\u00e1n incursions. In the year 1757, a force under N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn Bamiz\u00e1i, despatched by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, to assist his son Tim\u00far in repelling the Marhatt\u00e1s, crossed the Helum at Khush\u00e1b, marched up the left bank of the river, and laid waste the three largest towns of the District. Bhera and Mi\u00e1ni (Meeanee) rose again from their ruins; but only the foundations of Chak S\u00e1nu now mark its former site. About the same time, by the death of Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, Khush\u00e1b also passed into the hands of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i. Shortly after, however, Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n, a Khattak, who held Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n and the Salt Range for Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, treacherously put the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to death, and seized upon Bhera. But Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n was himself thrown into prison as a revenue defaulter; and Fateh Sinh, nephew of Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i, then recovered his uncle's dominions. After the final success of the Sikhs against Ahmad Sh\u00e1h in 1763, Chattar Sinh of the Sukarchakia misl or confederacy overran the whole Salt Range, while the Bhangi chieftains parcelled out among themselves the country between those hills and the Chen\u00e1b. Meanwhile, the Muhammadan rulers of Sahiw\u00e1l, Mitha Tiw\u00e1na, and Khush\u00e1b had assumed independence, and managed, though hard pressed, to resist the encroachments of the Sikhs. The succeeding period was one of constant anarchy, aggressive warfare, and territorial changes among the petty princes of the District, only checked by the gradual rise of Mah\u00e1 Sinh, and his son, the great Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Sinh. The former made himself master of Mi\u00e1ni in 1783; and the latter succeeded in annexing Bhera in 1803. Six years later, Ranjit Sinh turned his arms against the Baluch chieftains of Sahiw\u00e1l and Khush\u00e1b, whom he overcame by combined force and treachery. At\nthe same time, he swallowed up certain smaller domains in the same neighbourhood; and in 1810, effected the conquest of all the country subject to the Si\u00e1l chiefs of Jhang. In 1816, the conqueror turned his attention to the M\u00e1l\u00edks of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na. The Muhammedan chief retired to Nurpur, in the heart of the thal, hoping that the scarcity of water and supplies might check the Sikh advance. But Ranjit Sinh's general sank wells as he marched, so that the Tiw\u00e1sas fled in despair, and wandered about for a time as outcasts. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1, however, after annexing their territory, dreaded their energy and influence, and therefore endeavoured to conciliate them by inviting them to Lahore, where he made a liberal provision for their support. On the death of the famous Hari Sinh\u2014to whom had been assigned the Tiw\u00e1na estates\u2014at Jamrud, in 1837, Fateh Kh\u00e1n, the representative of the Tiw\u00e1na family, obtained a grant of the ancestral domains from his patron at court, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dhi\u00e1m Sinh. Thenceforward, M\u00e1lik Fateh Kh\u00e1n took a prominent part in the turbulent politics of the Sikh realm, after the rapidly succeeding deaths of Ranj\u00edt Sinh, his son, and grandson. Thrown into prison by the opposite faction, after the murder of Dhi\u00e1m Sinh, he was released by Lieut. (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, who sent him to Bannu on the outbreak of the M\u00falt\u00e1n rebellion to relieve Lieut. Taylor. Shortly afterwards the Sikh troops mutinied, and Fateh Kh\u00e1n was shot down while boldly challenging the bravest champion of the Sikhs to meet him in single combat. His son and a cousin proved themselves actively loyal during the revolt, and were rewarded for their good service both at this period and after the Mutiny of 1857. The District passed under direct British rule, with the rest of the Punjab, on the suppression of the M\u00falt\u00e1n rebellion. At the period of annexation, the greater part of the country was peopled only by wild pastoral tribes, without fixed abodes, but moving from place to place in search of grass and water. Under the influence of settled government, they have begun to establish themselves in permanent habitations, to cultivate the soil in all suitable places, and to acquire a feeling of attachment to their regular homes. The Mutiny of 1857 had little influence upon Sh\u00e1hpur. The District remained tranquil, and though the villages of the b\u00e1r gave cause for alarm, no outbreak of sepoys took place, and the wild tribes of the upland did not revolt even when their brethren in the M\u00falt\u00e1n Division took up arms. A body of Tiw\u00e1na horse, levied in the District, did excellent service, and earned for their M\u00e1l\u00edks the coveted title of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1855 was taken over an area so greatly altered by subsequent territorial changes (as the trans-Jhelum tract then lay chiefly within the old District of Leah) that detailed comparison with later statistics becomes impossible. A rough calculation,\nhowever, would appear to show that the general density of population increased 25 per cent. between that date and 1868; and although this increase may be regarded as excessive, there can be no doubt that the number of inhabitants has grown with great rapidity ever since the annexation. The enumeration of 1868 extended over a total area of 4700 square miles, and disclosed a population of 368,796 persons, distributed among 667 villages or townships, and inhabiting 86,549 houses. From these data the following averages may be calculated:\u2014Persons per square mile, 78\u00b755; villages per square mile, 0\u00b714; houses per square mile, 18\u00b742; persons per village, 552; persons per house, 4\u00b726. But though the density of population is thus low, when the desert area is taken into account, the proportion of inhabitants to the cultivable surface is really very high, being upwards of 400 per square mile in the tilled portions of the Salt Range. The cultivable land, indeed, is very much subdivided, and is barely sufficient for the support of its inhabitants. Classified according to sex, the Census showed 195,823 males and 172,973 females; proportion of males, 53\u00b710 per cent. Classified according to age, the returns give, under 12 years\u2014males, 71,466; females, 63,203; total children, 134,669, or 36 per cent. of the whole population: above 12 years\u2014males, 124,357; females, 109,770; total adults, 234,127, or 64 per cent. of the whole population. As regards religious distinctions, the faith of Isl\u00e1m immensely preponderates, the number of Muhammadans being 305,507, or 82\u00b782 per cent., as against 53,590 Hindus, or 14\u00b753 per cent.; 3122 Sikhs, or 0\u00b785 per cent.; and 6577 \u2018others,\u2019 or 1\u00b778 per cent. The agricultural classes consist almost entirely of Muhammadans, the Hindus being occupied in trading operations. The District contained in 1868 four towns with a population exceeding 5000 souls, namely\u2014BHERA, 14,514; SAHIWAL, 8900; KHUSHAB, 8509; and MIANI (Meeanee), 6857. SHAHPUR, the civil station, has only 4743 inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The total area under cultivation in 1871-72 amounted to 423,680 acres, of which 252,800 acres were artificially irrigated. The spring harvest forms the main crop of the District. Wheat, the spring staple, covers little less than half the cultivated area; while spiked millet and cotton make up the chief items of the autumn harvest. Among the more valuable commercial crops, sugar-cane is grown only in the valley of the Chen\u00e1b, and poppy in the Jhelum lowlands between Sh\u00e1hpur and Bhera. Wheat thrives best in the alluvial soils that fringe the two rivers, where it is the only crop grown, as after it is cut floods inundate the whole valley, and only subside in time for the next sowing. It also grows luxuriantly in the rich hollows and basins among the Salt Range, where the cool climate admirably suits it. The use of manure and rotation of crops\nare little understood. Land from which a spring crop has been taken is occasionally sown afresh for the autumn harvest. In the Salt Range, the richness of the soil admits of successive sowings without any repose; in the tract below the hills, the torrents bring down perpetual supplies of fresh detritus; in the alluvial fringe of the rivers, the floods fertilize the soil by their annual deposit of silt, and so render possible a constant succession of double crops; but elsewhere the land lies fallow every second year. The anarchy which followed the break up of the Delhi Empire, and the grinding nature of the Sikh rule, have resulted in the disintegration of the village communities. Most of the tenures at present in existence belong to the type known as bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra. Only 66 villages retain the ancient communal type. Agricultural labourers receive their wages entirely in kind, usually in the form of a proportion of the crops grown by their labour. Coolies receive from 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. per diem; skilled labourers, from 6d. to 1s. Prices of food grains ruled as follows in 1873:\u2014Wheat, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 26 sers per rupee, or 4s. 4d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; and rice, 10 sers per rupee, or 11s. 2d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commercial importance of the District depends almost entirely upon its connection with the Salt Range, Mi\u00e1ni having been from time immemorial the centre for the salt of the Mayo Mines in Jhelum District. Opium and sajj\u00ed (carbonate of soda) are bought up by traders from R\u00e1wal Pindi, Si\u00e1lkot, and Kashmir (Cashmere); but most of the surplus produce of Sh\u00e1hpur finds its way down the river in country boats to M\u00falt\u00e1n and Sukkur (Sakhar). The chief exports are grain, rice, cotton, wool, ghi, and saltpetre; the principal imports\u2014sugar, English piece-goods, and metals. The Povindah merchants from Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n bring down madder, dried fruits, gold coin, and spices in the winter, which they exchange for country cloth. Scarves of silk and cotton are manufactured at Khush\u00e1b; turned and lacquered toys at Sahiw\u00e1l; felt at Bhera; and blankets throughout the District. Sh\u00e1hpur has no railroads; but good fair-weather roads intersect it in several directions, the chief being that from L\u00e1hore to Bannu and Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, which passes Sh\u00e1hpur and Khush\u00e1b, and that which runs along the left bank of the Jhelum from Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n to M\u00falt\u00e1n. Tolerable roads also open up the Salt Range; and the two main rivers are navigable throughout their whole course within this District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff comprises a Deputy Commissioner, Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioner, and the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary officials. The total amount of revenue raised in the District in 1872-73 amounted to \u00a3469,955, of which sum the land tax contributed only \u00a343,514. The largest item is\nthat of salt and customs, amounting to as much as \u00a3418,579. The incidence of the salt tax makes Sh\u00e1hpur the most valuable District in point of revenue in the whole Punjab; but the mines from which the income is really derived lie within the neighbouring District of Jhelum. The total police force in 1873 amounted to 462 officers and men, being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 11'34 square miles of area and every 1334 of the population. The District jail, near the civil station of Sh\u00e1hpur, contained in 1872 a daily average of 274 prisoners. Education still remains at a very low ebb, except in the four larger towns, while the nomad peasantry of the b\u00e1r regard it with positive aversion. The District contained in 1872-73, 187 schools, with a roll of 4381 pupils. There is one printing press at the Sh\u00e1hpur jail. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is subdivided into 3 tahsils. The six municipal towns of Miani, Sahiwal, Khushab, Bhera, Sh\u00e1hpur, and Girot had an aggregate revenue in 1875-76 of \u00a32979; incidence of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population (46,322) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the plains is hot and dry, but in the Salt Range the temperature is cool and the rainfall more abundant. The annual rainfall in the plains for the six years ending 1871-72 averaged 19'01 inches, the maximum during that period being 36 inches in 1868-69, and the minimum 11'2 inches in 1866-67. No record of temperature is now kept, but the registers of 1868-70 give a mean temperature in the shade of 80'65 F. The principal endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, dysentery and diarrhoea. Goitre prevails on the right bank of the Chen\u00e1b, and guinea-worm at the foot of the Salt Range. The total number of deaths reported in 1872 was 14,443, of which 10,426 were assigned to fevers and 584 to bowel complaints. The District contains 7 charitable dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1872 to 42,118 persons, of whom 461 were in-patients.\n\nSh\u00e1hpur.\u2014Tahsil of Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab; lying in the Jetch Do\u00e1b portion of the District, and consisting of a narrow belt of cultivation along the Jhelum (Jh\u00e9lam) river, together with a wide sterile upland tract in the rear.\n\nSh\u00e1hpur.\u2014Town and administrative headquarters of Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab. Pop. (1868), 4743. Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 16' N., and long. 72\u00b0 31' E., on the left bank of the Jhelum (Jh\u00e9lam) river, exactly opposite Khushab. Derives its only claim to importance from the presence of the civil station. Court-house, tahsili, police station, staging bungalow, sard\u00e1 (native inn), dispensary, school-house, and town hall.\n\nSh\u00e1hpur.\u2014Hill range in M\u00e1ndla District, Central Provinces; north of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, while the Johil\u00e1 flows below. Forms\npart of the watershed between Eastern and Western India. The scenery is wild and desolate, the only inhabitants being a few small colonies of Gonds and Baigas. The Gejar and Ganjai stream down from the highlands in a series of waterfalls, the finest of which is 60 feet high; behind the falls yawn dark caverns, tenanted by wild beasts and by reputed evil spirits. Most of the range, however, is under the immediate protection of Mahadeva.\n\nShahpura.\u2014Native State in Rajputana, under the political superintendence of the Rajputana Agency. Estimated area, 400 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 36,000. Revenue, excluding alienations, about \u00a320,000. The country is flat and treeless, but fertile; much of it is pasture land. The Raja of Shahpura holds a fief under the Maharana of Udaipur, consisting of 74 villages, with an estimated population of about 16,000 persons, and a revenue of \u00a33500. Tribute of \u00a3300 is paid to the State of Udaipur. The Raja is thus a feudatory both of the British Government and of Udaipur. The ruling family is of the Sesodia Rajput clan, being descended from a former Rana of Udaipur. The founder of the house was Suraj Mall, a younger son of the Rana, from whom the late chief was tenth in direct lineal descent. Suraj Mall received as his portion the pargan\u00e1 of Kherar in Udaipur, and his son also acquired from the Emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, in reward for his gallant services, a grant of the pargan\u00e1 of Phulia out of the crown lands of Ajmere, upon condition of furnishing certain horse and footmen for service. He abandoned the town of Phulia and founded the present town of Shahpura. In 1848, the Raja of Shahpura received a sanad from the British Government fixing the amount of his tribute at \u00a31000 per annum, with the proviso that if the customs duties levied in Ajmere were abolished he should also cease to collect such duties, and in consideration of such loss of revenue his tribute should be reduced to \u00a3200. The chief also holds a sanad guaranteeing to him the right of adoption. The present Raja, Dhiraj Nahar Sinh, was born about 1855. There is a dispensary in the State, and vaccination is encouraged. The military force of the State consists of 12 guns, 20 artillerymen, 250 cavalry, and the same number of infantry.\n\nShahpura.\u2014Capital of Shahpura State, Rajputana. Lat. 27\u00b0 23' 45\" N., long. 76\u00b0 1' E. School, in which Hindi and arithmetic are the chief subjects taught, attended in 1875 by 198 pupils. In that year, a girls' school was also established.\n\nShahpuri.\u2014Small island, situated at the mouth of the Naaf river in Chittagong District, Bengal; famous as having afforded the casus belli of the first Burmese war. The Burmese claimed possession of the island, although it had for many years been in the undisputed occupation of the British. Tolls were levied upon boats belonging to Chittagong;\nand on one occasion, the demand being resisted, the Burmese fired upon the party and killed the steersman. This act of violence was followed by the assemblage of armed men on the eastern side of the N\u00e1af, and universal consternation pervaded the villages in this the most remote and unprotected portion of Chittagong District. On the night of the 24th September 1823, the Burmese proceeded to enforce their claim to the island of Sh\u00e1hpuri; a thousand men landed on the island, overpowered the guard, killed and wounded several of the party, and drove the rest off the island. As soon as this was known at Calcutta, a detachment of troops was sent to dislodge the Burmese, who, however, had previously retired. The occupation of Sh\u00e1hpuri by a military force had the effect of arresting for a time the hostile demonstrations of the Burmese on the Chittagong frontier. But not long afterwards the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Arakan was ordered to expel the English from Sh\u00e1hpuri, and officials from Ava proceeded to take possession of the island, which had been temporarily abandoned on account of its unhealthiness. This and other acts of hostility rendered war inevitable; and in a proclamation dated the 24th February 1824, the grounds on which the first Burmese war was declared were made known.\n\n**Shahr Sultan.**\u2014Town in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 35' N., and long. 71\u00b0 2' E. Pop. (1868), 2836.\n\n**Shaikh\u00e1wati** (Shekh\u00e1wati).\u2014A Province of J\u00e1ipur State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated between lat. 27\u00b0 20' and 28\u00b0 33' N., and long. 74\u00b0 40' and 76\u00b0 5' E. It is bounded on the north-east by the Punjab States of Loh\u00e1ru and Pati\u00e1la, on the south-east by J\u00e1ipur proper, on the south by Jodhpur or M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, and on the west and north-west by B\u00edskaner. Its area has been estimated at 5400 square miles, and its population at 432,000. In its physical aspects, the more fertile part of Shaikh\u00e1wati resembles J\u00e1ipur; but a large portion of its soil is sandy desert, like that of B\u00edskaner. There are no perennial rivers; but a small stream, which rises in the northern part of J\u00e1ipur, flows northward for some distance through Shaikh\u00e1wati, ultimately losing itself in the sand. There is an important salt lake in the Province, called Kachor-Rewas; it is not worked by any means to its full capacity, but the present yearly out-turn of salt is about 6000 tons. The minerals of Shaikh\u00e1wati are important; the copper-mines near Khetri being perhaps the most valuable in India. The ores are copper pyrites, mixed, it is said, with grey copper-ore (fahlerz or tetrahedrite); some carbonates also occur, and native copper has been found. Near the surface, also, in the shales, blue vitriol is produced by the decomposition of the pyrites. In the same mines cobalt is also obtained, the ore occurring in small veins. These mines have evidently been worked for a very long period. Some of the hills in the neighbourhood are honeycombed with old excavations; and the heaps of slag from the furnaces have accumulated in the\ncourse of time, until they now form a range of hillocks several hundred feet in length and from 30 to 40 feet high.\n\nHistory, etc. \u2014 Shaikhawati is politically a confederacy of petty R\u00e1jput chieftains, bound to each other and to their common overlord at J\u00e1ipur by the ties of clanship. The Shaikhawats are a sept of that Kachw\u00e1ha clan whose head is the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00e1ipur or Amber. They derive their name from Shaikhji, the grandson of B\u00e1la\u00ed, who was a younger son of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00e1ipur in 1389 A.D., and received a portion of this territory in appanage. Shaikhji was so called from a famous Musalm\u00e1n saint named Shaikh Burh\u00e1n, whose shrine near Achrol is still regarded with veneration, and whose prayers had been successfully invoked by Shaikhji\u2019s father for the birth of a son and heir. In commemoration of this incident, every Shaikhawat boy wears, for two years from his birth, the Musalm\u00e1n badi\u00e1 or threads, as well as the blue tunic and cap; and the Shaikhawat sportsmen never hunt the wild hog or touch its flesh, although by other R\u00e1jputs it is commonly eaten once a year. Moreover, although the lands surrounding the saint\u2019s dargah belong now to the demesne of the J\u00e1ipur Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, the dargah itself is a sanctuary, and rent-free lands are held by about a hundred families descended from Shaikh Burh\u00e1n. Shaikhji\u2019s father and grandfather had paid as tribute to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 all the colts reared on their land; but Shaikhji so enlarged his power that for some generations the lords of Shaikhawati became independent of the parent State. From Shaikhji\u2019s great-grandson, R\u00e1i Sfl, are descended the chieftains of Southern Shaikhawati, who hence have always been known as R\u00e1isilots; and from a younger son of R\u00e1i Sfl are descended the principal chieftains of Northern Shaikhawati, called the S\u00e1dh\u00e1nis. The chief settlement of the R\u00e1isilots, and the most important principality of Shaikhawati, was at Khandela; whilst the early seat of the S\u00e1dh\u00e1nis was at Ud\u00e1ipur, another town of this territory, not to be confounded with the capital of Mew\u00e1r. There have been, and still are, many other branches of the family, between whom feuds, conquests, and reconquests have been interminable. R\u00e1i Sfl himself became chief both of Khandela and of Ud\u00e1ipur by the help of the Delhi Emperor; and he is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as a mansabd\u00e1r of 1250 horse under Akbar. After the fatal battle of Merta, in 1754, had laid R\u00e1jput\u00e1na prostrate at the feet of the Marhatt\u00e1s under De Boigne, Shaikhawati suffered severely from their ravages; most of her towns were sacked, the capital, Khandela, being saved from that fate only by a heavy payment. Later on, it was the scene of some of the exploits of the famous adventurer George Thomas, who was called in by a chief of Khandela to aid him against J\u00e1ipur. Finally, however, the Shaikhawat chieftains acknowledged the suzerainty of J\u00e1ipur; though the bond seems never to have been very close. The leading chiefships are those of Sikar and Khandela, Khetri and Kotputli.\nThe custom of equal division on succession to land in Shaikhawati is similar to that which prevails in Mal\u00e1ni, a dependency of Jodhpur that holds much the same kind of relation to its parent State that Shaikhawati does to J\u00e1ipur; and therein the custom differs from that prevalent elsewhere throughout R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, where the eldest son succeeds. The custom, however, does not appear to extend to the larger estates and chiefships in Shaikhawati.\n\nShaikh Bud\u00edn (Shekh Bud\u00edn).\u2014Hill sanatorium in Bannu (Bunnoo) and Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n Districts, Punjab, lying in lat. $32^\\circ 17' 48''$ N., and long. $70^\\circ 50' 48''$ E., on the border of the two Districts, but included for administrative purposes in Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. Elevation above sea level, 4516 feet. Distant from Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n town 57 miles north, from Bannu town 64 miles south. The sanatorium crowns a bare limestone rock, which rises abruptly from the low range of Mohar, whose highest point it forms. A few stunted wild olives and acacias compose the only vegetation on the shadeless slope. The heat is frequently excessive, though mitigated from June to October by a cool south-western breeze. This drawback, combined with the want of sufficient water supply and the paucity of building sites, renders Shaikh Bud\u00edn a very inadequate sanatorium. Persons who go up in good health are seldom attacked by illness; but the climate is not bracing enough for constitutions which require a radical change.\n\nShaikh Bud\u00edn (Shekh Bud\u00edn).\u2014Mountain range, separating the Districts of Bannu and Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, Punjab. The highest point (4516 feet above sea level) is occupied (lat. $32^\\circ 17' 48''$ N., long. $70^\\circ 50' 48''$ E.) by the sanatorium which takes its name (Shaikh Bud\u00edn) from the range.\n\nShaikhpur\u00e1.\u2014Town and th\u00e1n\u00e1 in Monghyr District, Bengal.

Elevation above sea level, 9623 feet.\n\nShalvari.\u2014Town in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay; situated 32 miles east by north of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town. Pop. (1872), 5220.\nSh\u00e1ml\u00ed.\u2014North-western tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces; comprising a level upland, traversed throughout by the Eastern Jumna Canal, whose distributaries extend over every part of its surface.

(1872), 195,990; land revenue, \u00a332,099; total Government revenue, \u00a337,548; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a371,239.\n\nSh\u00e1ml\u00ed.\u2014Trading town in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of the tahsil of the same name; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 26' 45\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 21' 10\" E., on the bank of the Eastern Jumna Canal, 24 miles west of Muzaffarnagar town, on a low unhealthy site. Pop. (1872), 9177, consisting of 7158 Hindus and 2019 Muhammadans. Sh\u00e1ml\u00ed suffers much from malarious diseases; but a scheme of drainage now (1875) in progress will probably do much to lessen this evil. Handsome b\u00e1z\u00e1r; considerable trade with the Punjab, consisting of exports of sugar and imports of salt. Originally known as Muhammadpur Zan\u00e1rd\u00e1r; derives its present name from Sh\u00e1m, who built a market in Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr's reign. Held in 1794 by a Marhatt\u00e1 commandant, who fell under suspicion of intriguing with the S\u00edkhs. Lakwa D\u00e1da, the Marhatt\u00e1 governor, despatched George Thomas against the commandant. Thomas stormed the town, and cut to pieces the suspected parties. In 1804, Colonel Burn was surrounded at Sh\u00e1ml\u00ed by an overwhelming force of Marhatt\u00e1s, but escaped from a desperate position through the opportune advance of Lord Lake. During the Mutiny of 1857, the native tahsild\u00e1r held the town bravely for the British; but fell at last gallantly defending his post against the insurgents of Thana Bhawan. Police station, post office. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a31205; from taxes, \u00a3976, or 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population (9300) within municipal limits.\n\nShamsha (or Shimshupa; also called the Kadamba and the Kadabakola).\u2014Tributary of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, in Mysore.

In T\u00famk\u00far District its waters are utilized to form the great Kadaba tank; and in Mysore District it is crossed by a dam or anicut 9 miles above Madd\u00far. This anicut has recently been rebuilt by the Public Works Department of hewn stone. It feeds the Madd\u00far tank, and supplies irrigation channels 12 miles in length, capable of irrigating 2240 acres, and yielding a revenue of \u00a3671.\n\nShamsh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 32' 15\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 28' 40\" E., on the south bank of the Buddhi Ganga river, 18 miles north-west of Fatehgarh.

Before the opening of the railway in 1863, Sheg\u00e1on had little commerce; but a cotton market is now held here, and considerable supplies of cotton have of late been brought here instead of to Kh\u00e1mga\u00f3n. There are several cotton presses, some under European superintendence. Travellers' bungalow, s\u00e1rdi (native inn), and police station; Government school, and post office.\n\nShekh\u00e1wati.\u2014Division of J\u00e1ipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See Shaikh-Awatl.\n\nShekh Bud\u00edn.\u2014Sanatorium and mountains in Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Bannu Districts, Punjab.\u2014See Shaikh Bud\u00edn.\n\nShekohpura.\u2014Ancient town in Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1l\u00e1 District, Punjab; situated on the road between H\u00e1fiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and Lahore, 22 miles from the former town. Contains a ruined fort, built by the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. Prince D\u00e1ra Shekoh, grandson of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, from whom the town probably derives its name, is said to have connected it by a cut with the Aik rivulet, and this cut now forms the main channel of the stream. Under Ranjit Sinh, Shekohpura became the residence of one of his queens, R\u00e1n\u00ed R\u00e1j Kauran, better known as R\u00e1n\u00ed Nak\u00e1yan, whose cumbrous brick palace still remains the most conspicuous object in the town. After British annexation, the headquarters of the District were fixed for a time at this spot; but since the removal of the civil station to Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1l\u00e1, Shekohpura has possessed no importance of any sort, except as a resort for sportsmen.\n\nShell\u00e1.\u2014Petty State or confederacy in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, Assam; presided over by two elective chiefs of equal authority, with the title of wdhadd\u00e1d\u00e1rs.

When Shergh\u00e1t\u00ed formed part of the District of R\u00e1mgarh it was known as a centre of crime, which led to the appointment of a special Joint Magistrate in 1814.\n\nSherkot.\u2014Town in Bijn\u00e1ur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 19' 35\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 36' 55\" E., on the bank of the Kho river. Pop. (1872), 12,586. Formerly headquarters of the Dh\u00e1mpur tahsil, now the residence of Chaudhri Basant Sinh, a wealthy t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r.\n\nSherm\u00e1devi (Sheranmah\u00e1devi).\u2014Town in Amb\u00e1samudaram t\u00e1luk, Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras; situated in lat. 8\u00b0 40' 40\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 35' 13\" E., on the T\u00e1maparani river. Formerly headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name; at present residence of the Sub-Collector of the District. Pop. (1871), 6064; number of houses, 1870.\n\nSheroda.\u2014State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay.\u2014See SHIRODA.\n\nSherpur.\u2014Town in Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 34' 40\" N., and long. 83\u00b0 50' E., on the alluvial plain south of the Ganges. Pop. (1872), 7958.\n\nSherpur.\u2014Municipal town in Bogr\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 40' 20\" N., long. 89\u00b0 28' 20\" E.; pop.

Though the number of Hindus is so great, the town is surrounded on all sides by Muhammadan places of worship, which are held in much esteem. The proportion of brick-built houses is unusually large, and the principal landholders of the District reside in the town. But it is as a place of historical interest that Sherpur is most deserving of notice. It is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed, 1595 A.D., as the site of a fort called Sal\u00edmnagar, in honour of Sal\u00edm, the son of Akbar, afterwards famous as the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. It also figures in the writings of other Muhammadan historians as an important frontier post, previous\nto the conquest of South-Eastern Bengal, and the establishment of the Government at Dacca. These writers always refer to the place as Sherpur Murch\u00e1, to distinguish it from another Sherpur in Maimansinh; and it is marked on Van den Broucke's Map (1660) as 'Ceepoor Mirts.' R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Sinh, Akbar's Hindu general, is said to have built a palace at Sherpur; and it is very probable that he would make use of so convenient a centre, from which to dominate Southern Bengal, and particularly Jessur, which then (about 1600 A.D.) included a large part of the present District of Pabn\u00e1, and was held by the rebel samind\u00e1r, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1p\u00e1ditya, against whom M\u00e1n Sinh specially directed his arms.\n\nSherpur.\u2014Municipal town in Maimansinh District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 0' 58\" N., long. 90\u00b0 3' 6\" E.; lies between the rivers Shir\u00ed and Mirgh\u00ed, about half a mile from the former and 1 mile from the latter, 9 miles north of Jamalpur. Pop. (1872), 8015, including the suburbs of N\u00e1r\u00e1yanpur and Barukp\u00e1ra. There is no water carriage to the town, and even water for drinking and household purposes is obtained solely from tanks. Sherpur contains a fine Hindu temple; its buildings in general are in bad repair, and the place has a decayed and neglected appearance. Police station, post office, subordinate judge's court, and a good school. Municipal income (1876-77), \u00a3320; rate of taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head of population. Considerable river trade. In 1876-77, the registered exports comprised 27,100 maunds of jute (mostly sent to N\u00e1r\u00e1yanganj), 35,100 maunds of rice and paddy, and 30,600 maunds of mustard seed; the imports included European piece-goods, valued at \u00a35770, and 1200 maunds of betel-nuts.\n\nSherpur.\u2014Chief town of the Sherpur Subdivision of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay; situated 30 miles north of Dhulia, in lat. 21\u00b0 21' N., and long. 74\u00b0 57' E.

Post office.\n\nSher Shah.\u2014River fort in M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 6' 45\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 20' E., upon the Chen\u00e1b river. Until the opening of the Indus Valley State Railway in 1879, Sher Shah was the terminus of the line from M\u00falt\u00e1n, and the port of the steam flotilla that plied to Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee).\n\nShervar\u00e1yar Malai.\u2014Hills in Salem District, Madras. \u2014 See Shevaroy.\n\nShetrunj\u00e1 (Satrunjaya).\u2014Great place of Jain pilgrimage in P\u00e1lit\u00e1na, Guzerat, Bombay.\u2014See Palitana Town.\n\nSheva (Siva).\u2014Port on the coast of Th\u00e1na (Tanna) District, Bombay. Lat. 19\u00b0 3' N., long. 72\u00b0 54' E. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1873-74\u2014imports, \u00a32533, and exports, \u00a31680.\n\nShevaroy Hills (Seervar\u00e1yar Malai).\u2014Hill range in Salem District, Madras; situated between 11\u00b0 43' and 11\u00b0 55' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 13' and 78\u00b0 24' 30\" E. long. The hills occupy a\ntotal area of about 100 square miles, with a plateau of about 20 square miles; average elevation 4500 feet; highest point in the Green Hills, 5410 feet above the sea. The population of the hills was returned in 1871 at 10,745; number of houses, 2812. Two passes or ghats lead to the tableland\u2014one on the south from Salem city, and the other on the north from the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l. The former is about 6 miles in length, and is a Government road. It is in some parts very steep and impassable for wheeled conveyances; but it is capable of improvement. This is at present the only practicable approach to the hills, and the daily supplies of the inhabitants are brought up from Salem on this road by coolies, or on the backs of bullocks. The northern gh\u00e1t is reached from the Mall\u00e1puram railway station; and although no road has as yet been constructed, the gradients are said to be easy, and a carriage-way practicable. Mall\u00e1puram is distant 180 miles from Madras, and 8 miles from the foot of the hills. Coolies for carrying loads are to be had at the Shevaroy Hills station on the arrival of the trains. From its elevation and geographical position, it may be inferred that the Shevaroy Mountain range possesses a very equable climate. Partaking as it does of both monsoons, the rainfall is considerable, and the moisture of the air tolerably constant during the year. In a room without a fire, and with open windows, the thermometer seldom stands below 65\u00b0 F., and rarely rises above 75\u00b0 F. in the hottest months. The flora is almost precisely similar to that found at a corresponding elevation on the Palani, Nilgiri, and Anamalai ranges. The base of the mountains is covered with the common forms of vegetation found in the adjoining low country. The middle region is clothed with a zone of bamboo jungle, which ascends to a height of about 3500 feet, where it abruptly terminates. Teak, blackwood, and sandal-wood are found, in favourable situations, up to this elevation. The teak, in a stunted form, is met with on the mountain plateau at an elevation of 4500 feet. Tigers are not very often seen, and generally come from the low country. Leopards are more numerous. Bison and bears are found on the Nagal\u00far side of the hills. The sambhar and spotted deer are sometimes met with in the jungle low down on the mountain-side. Jungle sheep and hares are common on the hill plateau, but difficult to shoot, from the thickness of the cover.\n\nYercaud (Yerk\u00e1du) is the oldest and largest European settlement in the hills. It is situated on that portion of the plateau nearest to the town of Salem. The land in the valleys is undulating, and a great portion of it is already under coffee cultivation. The hill peaks are for the most part bare of soil, and the steep slopes are covered with low jungle.\n\nThe Green Hills are higher than any other portion of the range, and vary from 4500 to 5300 feet above sea level. They differ much in\nappearance from any other portion of the Shevaroys. The tops of the hills are rounded, and covered only with grass and low stunted shrubs; the ravines are wooded, as on the Nilgiris (Neilgherries). The rounded and undulating appearance of this portion of the Shevaroys contrasts markedly with the rugged peaks and wooded slopes about Yercaud. This difference is due chiefly to the Green Hills being capped with laterite, in some places of considerable thickness. Several coffee plantations have been opened by Europeans and Eurasians upon the Green Hills; and there is a fine expanse of tableland, partly under cultivation by the hill tribes, which has been pointed out by Dr. Macpherson, Inspector-General of Hospitals, as a site well adapted for a sanatorium for European troops. This site occupies about 250 acres of land, and appears to be eminently suited for building.\n\nShiar.\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, over a southward spur of the Himalayas, which bound Kunawar to the south. Lat. 31\u00b0 19' N., long. 77\u00b0 58' E. (Thornton). Magnificent prospect from the summit, embracing the Chor Mountain and the peaks of Jamnotri. Elevation above sea level, 13,720.\n\nShibi (Sibi).\u2014Village in Tumkur District, Mysore; 15 miles north of Tumkur town. Pop. (1871), 754. Celebrated for a temple of Vishnu, after his name of Nara-sinha, erected by three brothers in the beginning of this century. It is a plain structure, surrounded by a high stone wall. The annual festival, held for 15 days from the full moon in the month of Magh, is attended by 10,000 people, and supplies the occasion for a great deal of trade.\n\nShikarpur.\u2014A British District in the Province of Sind, lying between 27\u00b0 and 29\u00b0 N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 E. long. Bounded on the north by Baluchistan or the territory of the Khan of Khelat, the Frontier District of Upper Sind, and the river Indus; on the east by the Native States of Bahawalpur and Jaisalmir (Jeysulmere); on the south by Khairpur State and the Sehw\u00e1n Subdivision of Karachi (Kurrachee) District; and on the west by the Khirthar Mountains. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract published in 1879, 8813 square miles; pop. (1872), 776,227. The District comprises the 4 Subdivisions of Rohri, Shikarpur and Sukkur, Larkhana, and Mehar. The administrative headquarters are at Shikarpur Town, which is also the most populous place in the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The general aspect of Shikarpur District is that of a vast alluvial plain, broken only at Sukkur (Sakhar) and Rohri by low limestone hills, which tend to preserve a permanent bank for the Indus at those places. Towards the west, in the Mehar and Larkhana Sub-Districts, rises the Khirthar range, with an extreme elevation of upwards of 7000 feet, forming a natural boundary between Shikarpur and Baluchistan. Large patches of salt land, known as kalar, occur\nfrequently, especially in the upper part of the District; and towards\nthe Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d frontier, barren tracts of clay, and ridges of sandhills\ncovered with caper and thorn jungle, constitute a distinctive feature in\nthe landscape. The desert portion of the Rohri Sub-District, known\nas the Registh\u00e1n, possesses extensive sandhills, bold in outline and\noften fairly wooded. The forests of Shik\u00e1rpur cover a total area of\n207 square miles.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Districts of Upper Sind can hardly be said to have a\nhistory separate from that of the whole Province. Before the Muham-\nmadan invasion, in 712 A.D., this portion of Sind was ruled by a Br\u00e1hman\nrace, with their capital at Aror (or Alor), 5 miles distant from the\nmodern town of Rohri. Shik\u00e1rpur continued for some time a depen-\ndency of the Ummayid dynasty, and subsequently of that of the\nAbassides. In conjunction with the rest of Sind, it was conquered\nby Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00edf, about 1025 A.D.; but his rule was of short\nduration, being replaced, about 1032, by the S\u00famra dynasty. The latter\nwas succeeded in its turn by the Samma family, and this again by the\nArgh\u00fans; for an account of all of which, see the article on Sind.\n\nUpper Sind does not come into any prominence till the accession to\npower of the Kalhora dynasty, in the early part of the 18th century.\nPrevious to this, the country, which had been annexed in 1591-92 to\nthe Delhi Empire by Akbar, was ruled by a succession of governors;\nand a powerful tribe, the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, had arisen and displaced the\nMahars, an influential clan, whose chief town was then at Lakhi, 9\nmiles south-east of Shik\u00e1rpur town. These Mahars had themselves\nsome time before driven out the Jatois, a race of Baluchis, in a manner\nthus described by Captain (now Major-General) Sir F. G. Goldsmid, in\nhis historical memoir of Shik\u00e1rpur, written in 1854:\u2014\u2018We learn that\nthere were seven brothers of the tribe (Mahars) in Ubauro, near the\npresent Bah\u00e1walpur frontier, of whom one, by name Jaisar, not finding\na residence with his near kindred to accord with his views of indepen-\ndence, turned his steps to Bukkur, then occupied by the noted Mahm\u00fad,\ngovernor, under Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan, of the fort in 1541 A.D. The\nJatois, a race of Baluch\u00eds, held the country on the west bank of\nthe river between B\u00fardika and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na District. This included the\ntown of Lakhi, then a flourishing place, so called from Lakhu, as\nGosarji was from Gosar, and Adamji from Adam Jatoi. Jaisar crossed\nthe river and took up his abode among the villages of this people.\nThe Mahars and their new comrades disagreed; but the former had a\nfriend at court, one M\u00fasa Kh\u00e1n Mehr, who was a man of influence with\nMahm\u00fad, and obtained the assistance of some hundred men to quell\nthe disturbance, by asserting the rights of his own side. The con-\nsequence was the subjection of the Jatois, and a partition of their\ncountry. Jaisar received the tract extending from Mehl\u00e1ni to L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na\nas a free gift (tindad and madad-mash), on the condition that, after the lapse of a generation, one-tenth of the produce would be claimed by the Government. The Jatois obtained the northern allotment, from Mehl\u00e1ni to B\u00fardika, on payment, however, of the customary land tax. Jaisar Kh\u00e1n remained at Lakhi, which thus became, as it were, his property; and at his death, his son Akil, in conjunction with a brother, Bakhar, and a cousin, Wadera Sujan Kh\u00e1n, determined on building a new town to replace the old one. The fort which they erected may still be traced. Sujan also built a village called Mar\u00falo, after his son Mar\u00fa, now known as Wazir\u00e1b\u00e1d, from Sh\u00e1h Wali, the Waz\u00edr of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, whose perquisite it in after years became.\n\nBut the Mahars had to contend with the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, who were by profession both warriors and weavers. The results of the contest, and consequent foundation of the city of Shik\u00e1rpur, are thus narrated by General Sir F. G. Goldsmid:\u2014'The weavers (D\u00e1\u00fadputras) appealed to spiritual authority, as represented in the person of P\u00edr Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, whose tomb still bears testimony to the fact of his existence. He was a holy man of eminence, and numbered the Mahars, as well as their opponents, among his disciples, and he moreover himself resided at Lakhi. He took up the cause of the appellants, and eventually obtained permission for them to resume their hunting in the Shik\u00e1rgahs, from which they had been warned off by the Mahars. Again, however, they were stopped, and again did they seek the P\u00edr for redress. The Mahars were summoned a second time, and ordered to desist. They remonstrated, and finally informed their venerable mentor that they would never spare the intruders till they had exterminated the whole body, or at least driven them from the vicinity of the Shik\u00e1rgah, adding, \"If you wish to be their comrade, good, be it so.\" Baffled and distressed, the P\u00edr bethought him of the final resource in such cases. He invoked curses on the rebelling Mahars, and blessings upon the oppressed D\u00e1\u00fadputras. He told his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s that they were as the iron sickle, and their enemies as grass or chaff, and promised them the victory in the event of an engagement. The plot prospered. The crisis drew on, and the battle became inevitable. According to the story of the sons of D\u00e1\u00fad, their ancestors on this occasion could only muster a force of 300 or 400 fighting men, while their opponents numbered 12,000. A sanguinary conflict ensued on the meeting of the hostile forces, which, after the most determined endeavours on either side, eventually terminated in favour of the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, who were left masters of the field. Strange to say, while some 3000 dead bodies of Mahars strewed the ground, but few were killed on the side of the victors. A vigorous pursuit succeeded this victory. It was known that the wealthy samind\u00e1rs of Lakhi had l\u00f3khs of rupees concealed in that city. Thither went the D\u00e1\u00fadputras; and it is by no means\nunlikely that, on that particular occasion, they found means of improving the condition of their financial and commissariat departments. The P\u00edr received his successful pupils with as much mundane satisfaction as could be expressed by so holy a man. He congratulated them, and, mounting his palfrey,' continues General Goldsmid, 'he led the weavers to the scene of their exploits. He halted at the ground on which now stands the commercial city of Upper Sind. Muttering some mysterious words, which immediately instilled a dramatic awe into the hearts of the bystanders, he raised his hand high in the air, and gracefully dropped an iron nail, which had long been held there unnoticed. The nature of the movement brought the point well into the earth. It remained transfixed in an admirable position for the chief performer of the play. He pointed to the instrument upon which all eyes were drawn. \"Here,\" said the P\u00edr, \"let a city be built, and let it bear the distinguished name of Shik\u00e1rpur!\" The air rang with shouts, and the proceedings terminated in the usual manner on such occasions. The jungle was cut and cleared; neighbours were summoned, threatened, and cajoled; the work proceeded with vigour and rapidity, and by degrees a town appeared. The town in due course became a city, noted for the wealth and enterprise of its merchants, the size and business of its b\u00e1z\u00e1r, a hot-bed of intrigue, debauchery, bribery, oppression, evil-speaking, and many other kinds of corruption; and so passed away the years till the dawn of the 18th century.'\n\nThe Kalhoras had, during the 17th century, been gradually laying the foundation of their subsequent sovereignty in Sind, and the career of Y\u00e1r Muhammad, the first ruler of this line, is thus described by Goldsmid:\u2014'M\u00edrza Bakhtawar Kh\u00e1n, son of M\u00edrza Panni, was ruler of Siwi, and held a large tract on the west bank of the Indus, in the environs of Shik\u00e1rpur. Y\u00e1r Muhammad, associated with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Likki and Iltas Kh\u00e1n Brahui, recommenced aggressive measures by a movement in the country bordering on the Manchhar Lake. He possessed himself of Samt\u00e1ni, expelling the Panhwars and their head-man, Kaisar; and despatched his brother, M\u00edr Muhammad, to extend his acquisitions by a diversion in an opposite quarter. His objects were achieved with skill and rapidity. His career of conquest made Iltas leave him. \"You have no need of me; heaven is on your side; that suffices,\" said the rough Brahui. Kandi\u00e1ro and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na were taken, among less important places. The latter had been held by M\u00e1lik Al\u00e1 Bakhsh, brother of Baktawar. The M\u00edrza, upon these reverses, appealed to the Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da in M\u00falt\u00e1n, Moiz-ud-d\u00edn (afterwards Jah\u00e1ndar Sh\u00e1h), who no sooner heard the report than he turned to the scene of disturbance. Then Baktawar's heart misgave him, for he did not wish to see the country entrusted to his charge overrun by the troops of his master. He had probably private and particular reasons for the objection\nunknown to the historian. He prayed the prince to withhold his march, and on the refusal of his request, had actually the audacity to oppose the advancing hosts. He was slain, and Moiz-ud-din repaired to Bukkur. Y\u00e1r Muhammad does not appear to have suffered severely for his offences; on the contrary, the Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da came gradually round to favour his views of aggrandizement. One after another, new governors were appointed for Siwi, which Province in course of time was handed over to the Wakils of the Kalhoras. Y\u00e1r Muhammad received the imperial title of Kh\u00fada Y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n.'\n\nThe reigns of the several Kalhora princes will be found described in some detail in the section treating of the history of the Province. During the T\u00e1lpur rule, various parts of Upper Sind, such as B\u00fardika, R\u00fapar, the town of Sukkur, and other places, which were dependencies of the Dur\u00e1ni kingdom, had, between the years 1809 and 1824, been gradually annexed to the possessions of the Khairpur M\u00edrs, Sohr\u00e1b, R\u00fastam, and Mub\u00e1rak. Shik\u00e1rpur was the only spot that remained to Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; and that town eventually came into the peaceable possession of the M\u00edrs in 1824, at a time when Abdul Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n was the governor of the place, and when the S\u00edkhs were said to be contemplating an attack upon it. Goldsmid thus refers to this circumstance in his memoir:\u2014'Three or four months after the departure of Rah\u00edm D\u00edl Kh\u00e1n, it began to be rumoured that the S\u00edkhs were contemplating an attack upon Shik\u00e1rpur. At this time the Chevalier Ventura was with a force at Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. The M\u00edrs of Sind\u2014Karam and Mur\u00e1d Ali of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Sohr\u00e1b, R\u00fastam, and Mub\u00e1rak of Khairpur\u2014seeing that it would be of great advantage that they should at this juncture take the city into their own hands, deputed the Naw\u00e1b Wali Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Lugh\u00e1ri to dispossess the Afgh\u00e1ns, and carry out the wishes of his masters. The Naw\u00e1b commenced by writing to Abdul Mans\u00far several letters to the following effect:\u2014\"Undoubtedly the S\u00edkhs did wish to take Shik\u00e1rpur, and were approaching for that particular purpose. Its proximity to the M\u00edrs' possessions in Sind made it very inconvenient for them that it should fall into the hands of this people; moreover, the capture of the place, under the circumstances, would be disgraceful, or at least discreditable, and it was the part of wise men to apply a remedy in time when available. The Afgh\u00e1ns were not in a position to oppose the coming enemy; their Sard\u00e1rs in Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n were in the habit of eating superior mutton, Pesh\u00e1war rice, luscious grapes, raisins, delicious cold melons, seedless pomegranates, and rich comfits, and of drinking iced water; it was on account of this application of cold to the body that a martial and lordly spirit possessed them, which it is not the property of heat to impart. It was, moreover, necessary to the well-being of their hardy constitution. While the army was coming from\nKhoras\u00e1n, the city would glide from their hands.\" A well-known Persian proverb was here judiciously interpolated, viz. On calling the closed fist to remembrance after the battle, it will be necessary to let the blow fall upon one's own head. \"In fine, taking all things into consideration, how much better would it be for the M\u00edrs to occupy Shik\u00e1rpur; they were Muhammadans as well as the Afgh\u00e1ns. Once having driven away the S\u00edkhs, and deprived the infidels of their dominions, Shik\u00e1rpur was at no distance; let it then become the property of the Sard\u00e1rs. Now, in the way of kindness, let them (the Afgh\u00e1ns) return to Khoras\u00e1n, and join their comrades at table in discussing the pilaws and fruits, whereby cure is obtainable of this most destructive heat.\"\n\nAbdul Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n, upon receiving these communications, became greatly perplexed, and thought of returning to Khoras\u00e1n. The M\u00edrs, much as they desired to take possession of the town, were obliged to content themselves with assembling an army without its walls, on the plea of protection against a S\u00edkh invasion. They encamped in the Sh\u00e1hi B\u00e1gh. The Naw\u00e1b sent for J\u00fama Kh\u00e1n Barakz\u00e1\u00ed, and through him opened fresh communications with the governor, and tried every artifice to persuade the latter to quit his post. Finding a bold stroke of diplomacy necessary, he urged that he would hold him responsible for the town revenues accruing after the date of the original proposition for transfer to the M\u00edrs. This argument had the desired effect; Abdul Mans\u00far refused to refund, but agreed to abandon Shik\u00e1rpur. In this interval, Dil\u00e1war, Khitmagar to the Naw\u00e1b, entered the city, and coming to the house of Shauk\u00e1r Muya R\u00e1m, established his headquarters there, and caused the change of Government to be notified throughout the b\u00e1sd\u00e1r and streets. The M\u00edrs' followers came gradually in, and at length were regularly installed, and obtained the keys of the eight gates. The next day, Abdul Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n, at J\u00fama Kh\u00e1n's instigation, visited the Naw\u00e1b in the Sh\u00e1hi B\u00e1gh. The latter, after much flattery and compliment, gave him his dismissal. The ex-governor repaired with his effects to Garhi Y\u00e1sin, a town in the neighbourhood, and stayed there to execute some unfinished commissions. In a few days, the Naw\u00e1b ordered him to depart from thence, which he did, and was soon far on his way to Kandah\u00e1r. Wali Muhammad felt relieved, and applauded his own handiwork, in that he had won a bloodless victory. He had deprived the Afgh\u00e1ns of a much-loved settlement, and added it to the possessions of the M\u00edrs. The revenue was divided into seven shares; four became the property of the M\u00edrs of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and three of their relatives of Khairpur. Kazim Sh\u00e1h was the new governor.\n\nIn 1833, during the T\u00e1lpur rule, Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja, the dethroned Afgh\u00e1n monarch, made an expedition into Upper Sind to recover his lost territory. He marched with a force via Bah\u00e1walpur towards Shik\u00e1rpur.\nHe was met near Khairpur by Kazim Sh\u00e1h, the former governor of Shik\u00e1rpur, and escorted to the city with all honour, where he was to stay forty days and receive 40,000 rupees (\u00a34000). But though he took the money, he did not leave at the appointed time. Public feeling in Sind ran high. Those who declared for the Sh\u00e1h on the west bank were taken under his especial protection. He appointed local officials, and commenced legislating for his Sindian prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, treating them in the light of subjects. The climax was a burst of indignation from the offended M\u00edrs, and a rising of their Baluch retainers. A Baluch army, under M\u00edrs Mub\u00e1rak and Zang\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, crossed the river at Rohri, and took up a position at Sukkur, while Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja despatched a force of 2000 men under his lieutenant, Samandhar Kh\u00e1n, to meet it. The M\u00edrs had been drawn up near the I\u00e1law\u00e1h Canal, which the Sh\u00e1h's general attacked, throwing the Baluchis into instant confusion, and ultimately defeating them. This victory resulted in the payment to the Sh\u00e1h by the M\u00edrs of 4 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a340,000), and 50,000 rupees (\u00a35000) for his officers of State, while 500 camels were made over for the king's use. The Sh\u00e1h subsequently marched on his expedition against Kandah\u00e1r, but being defeated by Dost Muhammad, he retreated to Sind and proceeded to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he obtained sufficient money from the M\u00edrs to enable him to return to Ludhi\u00e1na, in the Punjab.\n\nIn 1843, on the conquest of the Province by the British, all Northern Sind, with the exception of that portion held by the Khairpur M\u00edr, Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d T\u00e1lpur, was formed into the Shik\u00e1rpur Collectorate and the Frontier District. In the previous year (1842), the towns of Sukkur, Bukkur, and Rohri had by treaty been ceded to the British in perpetuity. In 1851, M\u00edr Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d T\u00e1lpur of Khairpur was, after a full and public inquiry, convicted of acts of forgery and fraud, in unlawfully retaining certain lands and territories which belonged of right to the British Government. The forgery consisted in his having destroyed a leaf of the Kur\u00e1n in which the Naun\u00e1har, concluded in 1842 between himself and his brothers, M\u00edrs Nasir and Mub\u00e1rak Kh\u00e1n, was written, and having substituted for it another leaf, in which the word 'village' was altered to 'district,' by which he fraudulently obtained possession of several large districts instead of villages of the same name. On 1st January 1852, the Governor-General of India (Marquis Dalhousie) issued a proclamation depriving the M\u00edr of the districts wrongfully retained, and degrading him from the rank of Ra\u00eds (or Lord Paramount). Of the districts so confiscated, Ubauro, B\u00fcldika, M\u00edrpur, Said\u00e1b\u00e1d, and other parts of Upper Sind on the left bank of the Indus, now forming the greater part of the Rohri Subdivision, were added to the Shik\u00e1rpur Collectorate.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Shik\u00e1rpur District, according to the\nCensus of 1872, numbered 776,227, thus distributed:\u2014Rohri Subdivision, with 354 villages, 217,515; Shik\u00e1rpur and Sukkur, with 268 villages, 181,832; L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, with 494 villages, 234,575; and Mehar, with 343 villages, 142,305\u2014total, 1,459 villages and 776,227 inhabitants. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879, 8813 square miles; density of population, 88 per square mile.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of Shik\u00e1rpur District in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a3211,776, of which \u00a3190,630 was derived from imperial and \u00a321,146 from local sources. The land tax, canal revenue, excise, stamps, and forests furnish the principal items. Shik\u00e1rpur is administered by a Collector-Magistrate with Assistants; the Civil and Sessions Judge has his headquarters at Shik\u00e1rpur town. The police force numbers 1131 officers and men, showing 1 policeman to every 9 square miles of area and to every 686 of the population. Schools (1873-74), 86, with 5881 pupils.\n\nShik\u00e1rpur.\u2014T\u00e1luk of the Sukkur (Sakhar) and Shik\u00e1rpur Sub-District, Shik\u00e1rpur, Sind. Area, 472 square miles; pop. (1872), 73,383; total revenue (1873-74), \u00a314,235.\n\nShik\u00e1rpur.\u2014Chief town and municipality of Shik\u00e1rpur District, Upper Sind. Lat. 27\u00b0 57' 14\" N., long. 68\u00b0 40' 26\" E.; connected by good roads with Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, from which it is distant 26 miles south-east, with Sukkur (Sakhar) 22 miles north-west, and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na 40 miles north-east. Situated in a tract of low-lying country, annually flooded by canals from the Indus, the nearest point of which river is 18 miles west. The elevation of the town is only 194 feet above sea level. Two branches of the Sind Canal\u2014the Chota Beg\u00e1ri and the R\u00e1iswah\u2014flow on either side of the town, the former to the south, and the latter to the north. The soil in the immediate vicinity is very rich, and produces heavy crops of grain and fruit. The population (1872) numbers 38,107, of whom 14,908 are Muhammadans, 23,167 Hindus, 28 Christians, and 4 \u2018others.\u2019 Shik\u00e1rpur is the headquarters of the principal Government officials of the District, and contains the usual public buildings. The total number of police is 71. Municipal revenue (1873-74), \u00a39105. The Municipal Act was brought into force in 1855, since which year great sanitary improvements have been effected. Before that time, Shik\u00e1rpur was notorious for its unsightly appearance. The Stewartganj Market (so called after a popular District officer) is a continuation of the old b\u00e1zd\u00e1r, and is a commodious structure. To the east of the town are three large tanks, known as Sarwar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s, the Gillespie, and the Haz\u00e1ri tank. The climate is hot and dry; the rainfall for the twelve years 1862-1874 averaged only 5\u00b715 inches. The trade of Shik\u00e1rpur has long been famous, both under native and British rule, but it is the transit traffic which seems to be of the most importance. The town is situated on\none of the great routes from Sind to Khoras\u00e1n via the Bol\u00e1n Pass, and its commerce in 1841 was thus described by Postans:\u2014\u2018Shik\u00e1rpur receives from Kar\u00e1chi, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan), Bah\u00e1walpur, Khairpur, and Ludhi\u00e1na\u2014European piece-goods, raw silk, ivory, cochineal, spices of sorts, coarse cotton cloth, kinkhabs, manufactured silk, sugar-candy, cocoa-nuts, metals, kirami (groceries), drugs of sorts, indigo and other dyes, opium and saffron; from Kachhi, Khoras\u00e1n, and the north-west\u2014raw silk (Turkest\u00e1n), various kinds of fruit, madder, turquoises, antimony, medical herbs, sulphur, alum, saffron, assafctida, gums, cochineal, and horses. The exports from Shik\u00e1rpur are confined to the transmission of goods to Khoras\u00e1n through the Bol\u00e1n Pass, and a tolerable trade with Kachhi (B\u00e1gh, Gand\u00e1va, Kotri, and Dadar). They consist of indigo (the most important), henna, metals of all kinds, country coarse and fine cloths, European piece-goods (chintzes, etc.), M\u00falt\u00e1n\u00ed coarse cloth, silks (manufactured), groceries and spices, raw cotton, coarse sugar, opium, hemp-seed, shields, embroidered horse-cloths, and dry grains. The revenue of Shik\u00e1rpur derivable from trade amounted in 1840 to Rs. 54,736 (or say \u00a35473), and other taxes and revenue from lands belonging to the town, Rs. 16,645 (or say \u00a31664), making a total of Rs. 71,381 (or say \u00a37138), which is divided among the Khairpur and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs in the proportion of three-sevenths and four-sevenths respectively.\u2019 Shik\u00e1rpur is still the great centre of commerce in Upper Sind; although the town of Sukkur is believed to have drawn away much of its former trade with the Punjab, and the construction of a branch line of railway from that place to the entrance of the Bol\u00e1n Pass will probably still further reduce its prosperity. In 1874, the imports of Shik\u00e1rpur were valued at \u00a3264,190; the exports, \u00a364,485. The principal manufactures are carpets and coarse cotton cloth. In the Government Jail, postins or sheepskin coats, baskets, reed chairs covered with leather, carpets, tents, shoes, etc. are made by the prisoners. From Shik\u00e1rpur there are three postal routes, viz. to Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, to Sukkur, and southwards to L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na and Mehar. The town contains a normal and several vernacular schools, together with a high school, attended by 135 pupils. There are 8 Hindu-Sindi schools, with 1031 pupils; 3 schools for girls, with 128 pupils.\n\n**Shik\u00e1rpur.**\u2014Flourishing town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 17' N., and long. 78\u00b0 3' 15\" E., on the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t road, 13 miles south-east of Bulandshahr town. Pop. (1872), 11,150, consisting of 6227 Hindus and 4923 Muhammadans. Substantial, well-built houses, and handsome mosques. Great walled sard\u00ed (native inn), about 200 years old, through which the high-road passes. Founded about 1500 A.D. by Sikandar Lod\u00ed, as a hunting-lodge on a large scale, whence the town derives its name. Ancient mound,\nknown as the T\u00e1lpat Nagari, near the city. About 500 yards north stands a remarkable building, called B\u00e1ra Khamb\u00e1, or the Twelve Columns, containing 12 huge red-sandstone pillars, so massive that popular imagination attributes their erection to demons; but inscriptions show that the building really represents an unfinished tomb begun by Sayyid Fazl-ull\u00e1h, son-in-law of the Emperor Farrukhsiy\u00e1r, about the year 1718. Ruins of an old fort are traceable in the town. Residence of Chaudhri Lakshman Sinh, an Honorary Magistrate, who was conspicuous for his loyalty during the Mutiny of 1857.\n\n**Shik\u00e1rpur.\u2014T\u00e1luk** in Shimoga District, Mysore. Area, 410 square miles, of which only 32 are cultivated; pop. (1871), 63,210, of whom 59,125 are Hindus, 4032 Muhammadans, 48 Jains, and 5 Christians; land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rates, \u00a314,231, or 14s. 2d. per cultivated acre. Greatly overgrown with jungle, which gives shelter to many wild beasts. The most important crop and article of export is sugar-cane.\n\n**Shik\u00e1rpur.\u2014Municipal village** in Shimoga District, Mysore; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 15' 40\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 23' 30\" E., near the right bank of the Choradi river, 28 miles north-west of Shimoga town. Headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name. Pop. (1871), 2093; municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a3292; rate of taxation, 2s. 9d. per head. Said to have been originally called Maliy\u00e1n-halli, and subsequently Mah\u00e1danpur. The present name was given in the time of Haidar \u00c1l\u00ed, on account of the abundance of game found in the neighbourhood. The old fort is now in ruins. A festival held for three days in April is annually attended by 8000 persons. Weekly fair on Saturdays.\n\n**Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014South-western tahsil** of M\u00e1inpuri District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of an almost level plain, intersected by undulating sandhills, and much cut up by ravines along its southern border, where it abuts upon the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). The S\u00edrsa river flows through the midst of the tahsil, and the East Indian Railway traverses it from end to end. Area, 293 square miles, of which 200 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 143,869; land revenue, \u00a325,191; total Government revenue, \u00a327,721; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a341,416.\n\n**Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town** in M\u00e1inpuri District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of the tahsil. Pop. (1872), 10,069, consisting of 5366 Hindus and 4703 Muhammadans. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 6' 5\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 38' 10\" E., on the Agra road, nearly 2 miles from Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d station, on the East Indian Railway, and 34 miles west of M\u00e1inpuri town. The old town, a large straggling collection of houses, lies east and south of the main road; but the principal b\u00e1z\u00e1r lines the highway itself, and contains 9 sard\u00eds (native inns) for the accommodation of travellers. Ancient mound, once the site of a fort, now covered by\nhouses. Numerous temples and mosques. Birthplace of several Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n saints. Handsome *tuhstli*, police station, post office, school; telegraph office at railway station. Named after Prince D\u00e1ra Shikoh, traces of whose residence, garden, and wells still remain. The British obtained possession of Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1801, and established a cantonment south of the town. In 1802, a Marhatt\u00e1 force under Fleury surprised the British detachment; after which the cantonment was removed to M\u00e1inpuri. Formerly a great emporium for raw cotton, but the trade has declined. Manufacture of sweetmeats and cotton cloth.\n\n**Shillong.**\u2014Chief town of the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills District, and administrative headquarters of the Chief Commissioner of Assam; situated in lat. $25\u00b0\\ 32' \\ 39''$ N., and long. $91\u00b0\\ 55' \\ 32''$ E., on a tableland 4900 feet above sea level, and 67 miles south by road from Gauh\u00e1ti (Gowhatty). The Census of 1872, taken before Shillong became the seat of the local government, shows a population of only 1363 inhabitants. Shillong first became the civil station of the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills in 1864, in substitution for Cherra Poonjee. In 1874, on the constitution of the Chief Commissionership of Assam, it was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration, on account both of its salubrity and its convenient position between the Brahmaputra and Surm\u00e1 valleys. The Chief Commissioner permanently resides here, and also the heads of all the departments of Government. A considerable native population is already settled, which increases from year to year. Large sums of money have been expended on the erection of public buildings. A printing press has been established, from which issue all the official documents and reports of the Province. A church has been built, at which a chaplain officiates alternately with Gauh\u00e1ti. The nominal area of the station is 7 miles in length by $\\frac{1}{4}$ mile broad. An excellent water supply has been introduced through an aqueduct, which has its source in the neighbouring hill streams. Sanitary measures are stringently enforced. The cart-road from Gauh\u00e1ti, the old capital of Assam, on the Brahmaputra, was opened for traffic in 1877. The entire distance of 67 miles is accomplished by *tonga d\u00e1k* in about two days; and the sanatorium is thus rendered easily accessible from the fever-stricken plains of the Brahmaputra valley. The gradients on this road are a model of engineering skill. In 1875, the cantonments at Shillong were occupied by the 43d Regiment of Assam Light Infantry, with a total strength of 935 men. A large weekly market is held in the *b\u00e1sdr*. The model farm established in the neighbourhood in 1873 has not proved successful, either from a financial or an agricultural point of view. (See *The Statistical Account of Assam*, vol. ii. p. 229.) The climate of Shillong is singularly mild and equable. A temperature higher than $80\u00b0$ F. is seldom recorded. Hoar-frost lies upon the ground almost every morning during the months of December, January, and February.\nShallow water occasionally freezes over, but snow never falls. Fires are necessary during the great part of the year, the fuel used being coal, obtained at great cost from the beds at M\u00e1o-beh-lyrkar. The price is about \u00a33 per ton. The rainfall registered during the three years ending in 1876 averaged 83.65 inches a year. The prevailing diseases are dysentery, bowel complaints, and disorders of the liver; but when once European residents have passed through a short period of acclimatizing indisposition, they generally enjoy excellent health.\n\n**Shillong.**\u2014Mountain range in the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills District, Assam, overlooking the station of the same name. The highest peak (lat. 25\u00b0 34' 18\" N., long. 91\u00b0 55' 43\" E.) attains a height of 6449 feet above the sea, being the most elevated point in the entire District. The crown of the ridge is covered with sacred groves of large timber-trees.\n\n**Shimoga.**\u2014A District forming the north-western portion of the Nagar Division of Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 30' and 14\u00b0 38' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 44' and 76\u00b0 5' E. long. Estimated area, 3797 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1871, 498,976 souls. Bounded along the north and west by the Districts of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and North K\u00e1nara, in the Bombay Presidency. The administrative headquarters are at SHIMOGA TOWN, on the left bank of the Tunga river, just above its junction with the Bhadra.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District constitutes part of the principal watershed of Southern India. The river system is twofold\u2014the rivers in the east, the Tunga, the Bhadra, and the Varada uniting to form the Tungabhadra, which ultimately falls into the Kistna, and so into the Bay of Bengal; while in the west, a few minor streams break through the barrier of the Western Gh\u00e1ts and reach the K\u00e1nara coast. The whole region is covered with hills and valleys, but it naturally divides into two distinct portions. The larger half, towards the west, known as the Maln\u00e1d or hill country, gradually rises towards the Western Gh\u00e1ts, where isolated peaks attain a height of more than 4000 feet above sea level. The general elevation of the District is about 2000 feet; and towards the east it opens out into the Maid\u00e1n or plain country, which forms part of the general plateau of Mysore. The Maln\u00e1d presents a wealth of picturesque scenery and wild life. A park of giant timber-trees, overgrown with brilliant creepers, extends continuously for miles, only interrupted by glades of verdant grass; the towering mountains form a precipitous background; and wild animals of all kinds abound. Near the north-western frontier of the District, the Shir\u00e1vati river bursts through the Western Gh\u00e1ts by the celebrated Falls of Gersoppa, which surpass any other waterfall in India, and, in the combined attributes of height, volume of water, and picturesque situation, have few rivals in the world. The river here is 250 yards wide, and throws itself over a\nchasm 960 feet in depth in four distinct falls, one of which has an unbroken descent of 830 feet.\n\nThe mineral products include iron-ore, and laterite for building Magnetic stones, occasionally found on the summits of the Gh\u00e1ts, are highly prized. In the valleys of the Maln\u00e1d, the soil is a loose, sandy loam, very suitable for rice; in the north-east appears the black cotton-soil. The wealth of timber in the Maln\u00e1d remains as yet unproductive, owing to the inaccessible nature of the country. The more valuable trees include p\u00edn, wild jack, ebony, som, the large devadd\u00e1ram, gamboge, and a species of cedar. In the centre of the District are found teak, sandal-wood, the areca, cocoa-nut and sago palms, bamboo, cardamoms, and the pepper vine. Farther to the east, large trees altogether disappear. An area of about 35 square miles has been reserved by the Forest Department, including a teak plantation; and trees in avenues are planted along the public roads. Among wild animals, bison are especially numerous in the t\u00e1luk of S\u00e1gar, where wild elephants are also occasionally seen. Tigers, leopards, bears, wild hog, s\u00e1mbhar and chit\u00e1l deer, and jungle sheep are common in the wooded tracts.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present area of Shimoga District has supplied more than one important city to Southern India. The oldest memorials are three copper plates, purporting to be land-grants of Janamej\u00e1ya, the monarch to whom the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata was recited. Considerable doubt has been thrown upon the genuineness of these inscriptions; and the dates to which they have been referred belong to epic legend rather than to history. Janamej\u00e1ya is assigned to 1300 B.C. One of the plates bears the date 89 of the Yudishthira era, which would be equivalent to 3012 B.C., according to Mr. Lewis Rice.\n\nLocal history commences with the Kadambas, whose capital was at Banavasi, on the north-western frontier of this District, and whose dominions extended over great part of K\u00e1nara and Mysore. Banavasi is identified as one of the spots visited by a Buddhist missionary in 245 B.C., and as mentioned by the Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D. In the 6th century, the Kadambas were overthrown by the Chalukya kings, under whom they long continued to govern as feudatories; and at about the same time a petty Jain kingdom was established at Humcha. The Chalukyas were in their turn expelled by the Kalachuryas, under whose protection the Ling\u00e1yat religion became predominant in K\u00e1nara. Shimoga District subsequently was included within the dominions of the Ballalas and the kings of Vijayanagar, who were successively suzerains over all Southern India. At the time of the decadence of the latter empire, many local chiefs or p\u00e1lezars succeeded in asserting their independence, among whom the Keladi and the Basvapatna families divided between them the area of this District. The Keladi family, who were Ling\u00e1yats, first established themselves at\nIkkeri about 1560, and subsequently transferred their residence to Bednur, better known by the honorific appellation of Nagar. At one time they attained great power; but they were finally conquered by Haidar Ali in 1763, when their territory was annexed to Mysore. The Basvapatna chiefs were a less influential family, whose capital was at Tarikere, in the adjoining District of Kadur. They also fell before the organized empire of Haidar Ali in 1761. After the death of Tipu, and the re-establishment of the old Hindu dynasty of Mysore in 1799, Shimoga District repeatedly became the scene of disturbances, caused by the mal-administration of the Deshasta Brahmins, who had seized on the offices of government, and made themselves obnoxious to both the Lingayats and the cultivators. These disturbances culminated in the rebellion of 1830, led by representatives of the old Keladi and Basvapatna families, which occasioned the direct assumption of the administration of the entire State by the British.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1838, a Report by Mr. Stokes estimated the population of the District to be 304,120 souls; and a khana sumari or house enumeration, in 1853-54, returned a total of 427,179. The regular Census of 1871 ascertained the number to be 498,976, showing an increase of 64 per cent. in the interval of thirty-three years, and nearly 17 per cent. in the later period of eighteen years, if the earlier estimates can be trusted. This last-mentioned rate of increase is lower than in any other District of Mysore. The area of the District is approximately taken at 3797 square miles, which yields an average of 131.4 persons per square mile, an average rising to 247 in the taluk of Sorab. Classified according to sex, there are 258,446 males and 240,530 females; proportion of males, 51.79 per cent. There are, under 12 years of age, 88,179 boys and 85,045 girls; total, 173,224, or 35 per cent. of the District population. The occupation tables are scarcely trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that 133,112 persons are returned as connected with agriculture, and 22,307 with manufacture and arts. The religious division of the people shows\u2014Hindus; 468,294, or 93.85 per cent.; Muhammadans, 25,598, or 5.13 per cent.; Jains, 4099, or 0.82 per cent.; Christians, 984, or 0.19 per cent.; and 1 Parsi. The Hindus are further subdivided, according to the two great sects, into 183,853 worshippers of Vishnu and 284,441 worshippers of Siva. The Brahmins number 26,569, of whom the great majority belong to the Smarta sect; those claiming the rank of Kshattriyas are returned at 14,720, including 11,558 Marhattas and 1355 Rajputs; the Vaisyas are poorly represented by only 1098 persons, almost all Komatis. Of inferior castes, the most numerous are Wokligas (56,584), who are agricultural labourers; Idigas (49,987), whose caste occupation is that of toddy-drawers; and Sadars (44,881), of whom many are also cultivators. The Lingayats, who have always been influential in this\npart of the country, number 52,701. Out-castes are returned at 60,358; wandering tribes, 18,001; wild tribes, 5558. The Musalm\u00e1ns, who muster strongest in the taluk of Shimoga, are mostly all described as Deccani Musalm\u00e1ns of the Sunni sect. Out of the total of 984 Christians, 34 are Europeans and 35 Eurasians (chiefly residing on the coffee-plantations), leaving 915 for the native converts. According to another principle of classification, 118 are Protestants and 866 Roman Catholics.\n\nThe District contains 2829 populated towns and villages, with 2406 houses of the better class (or above \u00a350 in value), and 88,526 of the inferior sort. Compared with the area and population, these figures yield the following averages:\u2014Villages per square mile, 0.75; houses per square mile, 24; persons per village, 176; persons per house, 5.49. The only place in the District with more than 5000 inhabitants is Shimoga Town, the headquarters of the District, on the Tunga river; pop. (1871), 11,034. Its prosperity dates from the introduction of British rule. There are many sites of ruined cities in the District, which have been already alluded to. The chief are\u2014Nagar or Bednur, Ikkeri, and Keladi, all associated with a family of Lingayat p\u00e1g\u00e9drs; Basvapatna, the early residence of the Tarikere chiefs; the Jain ruins of Huncha; and Banavasi, with its Buddhist memorials. The most important modern towns, after Shimoga itself, are Chennagiri and S\u00e1g\u00e1r. There are altogether eight municipalities in the District, with an aggregate municipal income, in 1874-75, of \u00a34531.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple food crop of the District is rice, which is especially cultivated in the terraced valleys of the Malnad or hill country. The names of 60 different varieties are enumerated. The crop is sown from April to July, and reaped from November to February. In some tracts the cultivation of \u2018dry crops\u2019 predominates. Of these, r\u00e1gi (Eleusine coracana) is preferred by the natives for their own food, while rice is largely exported. Next to rice, the most important crop is sugar-cane, which is largely grown in the taluk of Shik\u00e1rpur. The canes are planted from January to June, and gathered after a full twelve months. The juice is for the most part converted into jaggery. The tract about Nagar produces the finest areca-nuts in Mysore. Miscellaneous crops include oil-seeds, a great variety of vegetables and fruits, pepper, and cardamoms. The coffee zone of the District is estimated to extend over 1000 square miles, but a considerable portion of this area is not of the most favourable character. There are altogether 250 plantations, of which 6 are owned by Europeans. In 1861, an unsuccessful attempt was made to improve the indigenous production of cotton, by the distribution of American seed. The following agricultural statistics are merely approximate:\u2014Out of the total area of 3797 square miles, only 699 are returned as under cultivation, and 702 as cultivable. The area under rice is 135,000 acres, with an out-turn\nvalued at \u00a3250,000; other food grains, 925,000 acres, with an out-turn of r\u0101\u1e0di valued at \u00a3127,000; cotton, 10,500 acres; cocoa-nut and areca-nut, 18,000; coffee, 5000; sugar-cane, 2500 acres. The agricultural stock consists of 12,113 carts and 71,853 ploughs. Irrigation is carried on both from tanks and from channels artificially drawn from the rivers by means of anicuts or weirs. The total number of tanks is 8313, including the great reservoir of Sulekere, in the taluk of Chennagiri, which is 40 miles in circumference, and ranks as the second largest in Southern India. In this same neighbourhood are to be found the best cattle in the District; and there are several grazing-grounds for the amrita mah\u0101l, or royal breed maintained by the State. Buffaloes are largely used for agricultural purposes, and pack-bullocks are bred to carry the through traffic across the Gh\u0101ts. The returns show a total of 385,216 cows and bullocks, and 44,399 sheep and goats.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The chief industries in the District are the weaving of coarse cotton-cloth and rough country blankets or kamblis, and the making of iron implements, brass-ware, pottery, and jaggery from the sugar-cane. Oil is expressed from a great variety of vegetable products. At certain localities are special manufactures of striped carpets, chintz, coarse brown paper, stone jugs, and rope from various fibres. The carving of sandal-wood constitutes a speciality of the g\u016bdi-g\u0101rs of Sor\u0101b, whose delicate and elaborate workmanship is considered superior to that of either Bombay or Canton. The chief articles turned out are caskets and cabinets, ornamented either with leaves and figures from the Hindu pantheon, or with a copy of any design that may be ordered. Carving of inferior merit is also produced in other villages of Shimoga. The manufacturing stock of the District is returned at 1700 looms, and 112 oil-mills. The trade of Shimoga is conducted with both the east and west coasts, and also with Bangalore. The chief exports are rice and other food grains, jaggery from the sugar-cane, areca-nuts, coffee, pepper, and iron articles. The imports received in exchange are European piece-goods, copper vessels, oils of various kinds, tobacco, betel-leaf, and gold and silver ornaments. There are four passes across the Western Gh\u0101ts, of which the two most important leave the District near the Falls of Gersoppa and at the town of Agumbi. The local trade is mostly in the hands of the Ling\u0101yats, whose centres of operation are at S\u0101gar, Tirthahalli, and Nyampti. There are five weekly fairs, each attended by more than 1000 people; and several annual religious festivals, at which much buying and selling is done. There is no railroad in the District. The aggregate length of imperial roads is 225 miles, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a33425; of District roads, 171 miles, costing \u00a3971.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1873-74, the total revenue of Shimoga District, excluding education and public works, amounted to \u00a3189,918. The\nchief items were land revenue, \u00a3111,454; s\u00e1yar or customs, \u00a338,518; forests, \u00a321,612. The District is subdivided into 8 taluks or fiscal divisions, with 43 hoblis or minor fiscal units. In 1870-71, the total number of estates on the register was 61,637. During the year 1874, the average daily prison population of the District jail was 426\u00b799; and of the taluk lock-ups, 15\u00b733: total, 442\u00b732, of whom 35\u00b793 were women, showing 1 person in jail to every 1129 of the population. In the same year, the District police force numbered 58 officers and 408 men; and the municipal police, 1 officer and 33 men: total, 500 men of all ranks, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a34094. These figures show 1 policeman to every 8 square miles of area or to every 998 of the population; the cost being \u00a31, 1s. 7d. per square mile and 2d. per head of population. The number of schools aided and inspected by Government in 1874 was 146, attended by 3465 pupils, being 1 school to every 26 square miles, and 6\u00b79 pupils to every 1000 of the population. In addition, there were 80 indigenous schools, with 1009 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Shimoga District offers a great variety of climate. The Gh\u00e1ts on the western frontier are only 8 miles distant from the sea; and here the south-west monsoon strikes with its full force, bringing a rainfall of more than 150 inches in the year. But the District stretches from the Gh\u00e1ts for about 100 miles towards the central tableland of Southern India; and the rainfall gradually diminishes, until it only amounts to about 25 inches at Chennagiri, most of which falls in October during the north-east monsoon. The sea-breeze from the west is distinctly felt as far as Shimoga town. During the two years 1873 and 1874, the maximum temperature registered was 92\u00b0 F. in the month of April, and the minimum 75\u00b0 in December. The average rainfall at Shimoga town, calculated over a period of thirty-eight years, is 30\u00b735 inches; but as much as 170 inches has been known to fall within the year at Nagar.\n\nMalarious fever of a persistent type prevails in the Malnad or hill country; and the natives appear to be even more exposed to its attacks than Europeans, when once the latter have become acclimatized. The vital statistics are far from trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that, out of the total of 7164 deaths reported in 1872, 3806 were assigned to fevers, 1276 to bowel complaints, 503 to small-pox, 32 to snake-bite or wild beasts, and 25 to suicide. In 1874, the dispensary at Shimoga town was attended by 237 in-patients, of whom 21, or 88\u00b761 per 1000, died; the out-patients numbered 8393.\n\nShimoga.\u2014Taluk in the District of the same name, Mysore. Area, 533 square miles, of which 147 are cultivated; pop. (1871), 79,031, of whom 69,936 were Hindus, 8433 Muhammadans, 78 Jains, and 584 Christians. Land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rates\n\u00a310,023, or 2s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The west and south is hilly and overgrown with jungle, which gives shelter to many wild beasts.\n\n**Shimoga** (Shiva-mukha, 'face of Siva,' or Shi-moge, 'sweet-pot').\u2014Chief town of the District, and headquarters of the taluk of the same name, Mysore; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 55' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 36' 5\" E., on the right bank of the Tunga river, 171 miles by road north-west from Bangalore. Pop. (1871), 11,034, of whom 7659 are Hindus, 2801 Muhammadans, 51 Jains, and 523 Christians. Municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a32,440; rate of taxation, 4s. 5d. per head. The early history is unknown. In 1791, a battle was fought in the neighbourhood, in which the Marhatt\u00e1s defeated a general of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, and sacked the town. Its growth in wealth and prosperity dates from the time when it was made the headquarters of the District and of the Nagar Division. A weekly fair, held on Tuesdays, is attended by 1500 persons.\n\n**Shimshupa.**\u2014River in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore.\u2014See Shamsha.\n\n**Shingnapur.**\u2014Municipal town in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 51' 20\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 42' 6\" E., 46 miles east-by-north of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Pop. (1876), 1506. Municipal revenue, \u00a3293.\n\n**Shinor.**\u2014Town in Baroda State, Bombay. Pop. (1872), 6006.\n\n**Shior\u00e1jpur.**\u2014Tahsil in Cawnpore District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the south-west bank of the Ganges, and traversed by the Ganges Canal. Area, 268 square miles, of which 148 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 141,842. Land revenue, \u00a327,537; total Government revenue, \u00a330,289; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a343,814.\n\n**Shir\u00e1l\u00ed.**\u2014Port on the south-western coast of North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1873-74\u2014imports, \u00a3190; exports, \u00a31370.\n\n**Shiroda.**\u2014One of the petty States of Undsarviya, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a390; of which \u00a312 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a31 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Shirol.**\u2014Town in Kolh\u00e1pur State, Bombay. Lat. 16\u00b0 44' 10\" N., long. 74\u00b0 38' 40\" E.; pop. (1872), 8247.\n\n**Shirpur.**\u2014Town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay.\u2014See Sherpur.\n\n**Shivag\u00e1ng\u00e1.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri and town in Madura District, Madras.\u2014See Sivaganga.\n\n**Shivag\u00e1ng\u00e1.**\u2014Hill in Bangalore District, Mysore.\u2014See Sivaganga.\n\n**Shivner.**\u2014Hill fort in Poona District, Bombay; situated not far from the Harischandragarh, and near the fort of Junn\u00e1r. Shivner is interesting as having been the birthplace of Sivaji the Great. It was granted in 1599 to Sivaji's grandfather, M\u00e1loj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1; and here, in 1627, Sivaji was born. It was often taken and retaken; and once, in 1670, the forces of Sivaji himself were beaten back by its\nMughal garrison. Besides its five gates and solid fortifications, it is celebrated for its deep springs. They rise in pillared tanks of great depth, supposed by Dr. Gibson to be coeval with the series of Buddhist caves which pierce the lower portion of the scarp. The fort commands the road leading to the N\u00e1negh\u00e1t and M\u00e1lsejgh\u00e1t, formerly the chief line of communication between this part of the Deccan and the sea-coast.\n\n**Shol\u00e1garh.**\u2014Town in Dacca District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 33' 45\" N., long. 90\u00b0 20' E.; pop. (1872), 6525.\n\n**Sholangipuram.**\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras.\u2014See SHOLINGHAR.\n\n**Shol\u00e1pur.**\u2014A British District in the Deccan, Bombay, lying between 17\u00b0 13' and 18\u00b0 35' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 39' and 76\u00b0 11' E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1878-79, 3925 square miles; population in 1872, 662,986 souls. It is bounded on the north by Ahmednagar District, on the east by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Akalkot State, on the south by Kal\u00e1dgi District and some of the Patwardhan States, and on the west by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Poona Districts and the States of Phaltan and Panth Pratinidhi. B\u00e1rsi, in the north-east, is separated from the main District by a strip of the Niz\u00e1m's territory; and on the west, in some places Patwardhan villages are included, and in others isolated Shol\u00e1pur villages lie beyond the District limits. The administrative headquarters are at the city of SHOLAPUR.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Except the Karm\u00e1la and B\u00e1rsi Subdivisions, where there is a good deal of hilly ground, the District is generally flat or undulating. It is very bare of vegetation, and presents everywhere a bleak, treeless appearance. The chief rivers are the Bh\u00edma (Bheema) and its tributaries, the M\u00e1\u0144, the N\u00edra, and the S\u00edna, all flowing towards the south-east. Besides these, there are several minor streams. Of the principal reservoirs, Ekr\u00fak and Siddheswar are near Shol\u00e1pur city, one is at Koreg\u00e1on, and one at Pandharpur. Wells also to some extent supply water for gardening and drinking purposes. The rainfall being very uncertain, a scarcity of water is annually felt during the hot weather. Stunted b\u00e1buls and mangoes, and a few n\u00edms (Azadirachta indica) and pipals (Ficus religiosa), are the only timber-trees found in the District. As these afford no cover, the District is without wild animals of the larger kinds.\n\n**History.**\u2014Shol\u00e1pur is one of the Districts which formed the early home of the Marhatt\u00e1s, and the birthplace of the dynasty. It is still a great centre of Marhatt\u00e1 population and mercantile activity. As full an account of the rise and progress of the Marhatt\u00e1 power as is consistent with the scope of this work will be found in the article on POONA DISTRICT, and further local details are given in the notice of the adjacent District of S\u00c1T\u00c1RA. An excellent monograph has been written on these three Districts by W. W. Loch, Esq., of the Bombay Civil Service.\nShol\u00e1pur formed part of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s dominions, until the downfall of his dynasty in 1818, and the incorporation of his territories by the East India Company in the Bombay Presidency. This District was at first included with that of Poona, but was erected into a separate Collectorate in 1838. Since then its progress has been rapid. Roads have been constructed, and the District is now traversed by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. From time to time its prosperity receives checks owing to drought, to which its situation and the treeless surface of the country expose it. It suffered especially in the famine of 1877, when it was the first District to manifest distress in the Bombay Presidency. Extensive relief works were at once opened, and every possible means were taken to avert the starvation of the people. Much has been done by means of tanks to protect the husbandman from the cruel vicissitudes of the seasons; but the situation and physical characteristics of Shol\u00e1pur will always render it liable to the natural calamities arising from drought.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1872 was taken on an area of 3925 square miles, and showed a total population of 662,986 persons, living in 649 towns and villages and 109,826 houses. Density of population, 168\u00b791 per square mile; square miles per village, 5\u00b788; houses per square mile, 27\u00b798; persons per village, 1021\u00b755; persons per house, 6\u00b704. Classified according to sex, there were 341,230 males and 321,756 females; proportion of males, 51\u00b746 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 123,601, and females, 113,603; total children, 237,204, or 35\u00b777 per cent.: above 12 years\u2014males, 217,629, and females, 208,153; total adults, 425,782, or 64\u00b723 per cent. Classified according to religion, 613,856, or 92\u00b758 per cent., were returned as Hindus; 48,740, or 7\u00b735 per cent., Musalm\u00e1ns; 319 Christians; 62 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; and 9 \u2018others.\u2019 Of Hindus, the chief classes are Br\u00e1hmans, Kunb\u00eds, and Ling\u00e1yats. Br\u00e1hmans are employed as priests and Government servants; the Kunb\u00eds are, for the most part, peasants; and the Ling\u00e1yats are traders, shopkeepers, and weavers.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Black soil, rich and capable of retaining moisture, prevails throughout the B\u00e1rsi Subdivision, and, to some extent, along the banks of rivers and water-courses in all parts of the District. In other places there is a large proportion of grey, barad, and red soil, the latter being very poor. Of 2,175,711 acres, the total area of Government cultivable land, 2,138,788 acres, or 98 per cent., were taken up for cultivation in 1877-78. Of these, 478,068 acres were fallow, or under grass. Of the remaining 1,660,720 acres under actual cultivation (17,964 acres of which were twice cropped), grain occupied 1,387,697 acres, or 83 per cent., more than three-fourths of which were under jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), the staple food of the people; pulses covered 124,064 acres,\nor 7 per cent.; oil-seeds occupied an equal area; fibres were grown on 36,518 acres, or 2 per cent., half of which was under cotton; miscellaneous crops, such as tobacco, sugar-cane, chillies, etc., occupied 16,461 acres, or nearly 1 per cent.\n\nTrade, Communications, etc.\u2014Besides nearly 150 miles of the Great Indian Peninsula line from Poona, entering the District at Pomalv\u00e1di in the north-east corner, and crossing in a south-easterly direction towards Gulbarga in the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions, there are roads from Shol\u00e1pur city to Pandharpur, Akalkot, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), and B\u00e1rsi; from Pandharpur to S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Kar\u00e1d; from B\u00e1rsi road station to Tembhurni on one side, and to B\u00e1rsi on the other, and thence to the Yedsi Pass; and, lastly, from Je\u00far station to Karm\u00e1la.\n\nSince the opening of the railway in that portion of the District between the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Poona, trade has greatly increased. Next to cotton, a large proportion of which comes from without, the chief exports are oil, oil-seeds, butter, turmeric, and cotton cloth. The imports are salt, piece-goods, yarn, gunny-bags, and iron-ware.\n\nAfter agriculture, the chief industries of the District are spinning, weaving, and dyeing. The silks and finer sorts of cotton cloth\u2014such as dhotis and women's robes\u2014prepared in Shol\u00e1pur bear a good name. Blankets are also woven in large numbers. Besides hand-loom weaving, a steam spinning and weaving mill, with 20,336 spindles and 170 looms, has lately been established at Shol\u00e1pur city. Oil-presses of the native type are worked by Tel\u00eds in many places, and saltpetre is manufactured to some extent by Mhars and M\u00e1ngs.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue raised in 1877 under all heads, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3239,463, showing, on a population of 662,986, an incidence per head of 6s. 6d. The land tax forms the principal source of revenue, yielding \u00a3191,077, or 78 per cent. of the total amount. The other chief items are stamps, excise, and local funds. The District local funds, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, yielded in 1877 a total of \u00a37361. There are 8 municipalities, containing an aggregate population of 112,667 persons. Their receipts amounted to \u00a313,706, and the incidence of taxation varied from 3\u00bdd. to 4s. 2\u00bdd. per head. The administration of the District in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and 4 Assistant Collectors, three of whom are covenanted civilians. The District is provided with the court of a senior Assistant Judge. For the settlement of civil disputes, there are in all, besides this, 4 courts. The number of suits disposed of in 1874 amounted to 5597. Seventeen officers share the administration of criminal justice. The total strength of the regular police force for the protection of person and property consisted of 97 officers and 442 constables, giving 1 man to every 1230 of the population. The total cost was \u00a38722, equal to\n\u00a31, 18s. per square mile of area and 3\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of convicted persons was 4817, being 1 person to every 137 of the population. There is one jail in the District. Compared with 45 schools and 516 pupils in 1865, there were, in 1877, 115 schools, with a roll-call of 4648 names, or, on an average, 1 school for every 5 villages. Two vernacular papers were published in 1877-78.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate, except from March to May, is healthy and agreeable. In the hot season, the mean temperature is 86\u00b0 F., very hot and oppressive in the day-time, but cool at night. The rainy season is pleasant: the sky is more or less overcast, and the rain falls in heavy showers, alternating with intervals of sunshine. The rainfall, which during the last twenty-six years varied from 18 to 40 inches, and averaged 26 inches, is unequally distributed, the fall in the western Subdivisions being very scanty compared with that in the east. During the cold season, from November to February, the atmosphere, with keen easterly and north-easterly winds, is clear and bracing.\n\nBesides fever of an intermittent type, skin diseases such as guinea-worm, itch, and ringworm are prevalent in the B\u0101rsi and Karm\u0101la Sub-divisions, brought on chiefly by the badness of the well water. Fever makes its appearance at the end of the rainy season, and is due in a great measure to the sudden change of climate. Cholera used every year to break out at Pandharpur during the periodical fairs; but improved sanitary arrangements have to some extent put a stop to this.\n\nIn 1877, 4 dispensaries and the civil hospital at Shol\u00e1pur afforded medical relief to 1038 in-door and 31,573 out-door patients, and 13,898 persons were vaccinated.\n\nShol\u00e1pur.\u2014Chief town of Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 40' 18\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 56' 38\" E., on the plain of the S\u012bna, 150 miles by rail from Poona. Area, 7\u00bc square miles; pop. (1872), 53,403. The small but strongly built fort in the south-west corner of the town, surrounded by a ditch, is ascribed to Hassan Gangu, the founder of the B\u00e1hmani dynasty (1345). On the dissolution of that kingdom in 1489, Shol\u00e1pur was held by Zein Kh\u00e1n. But during the minority of his son it was, in the year 1511, besieged and taken by Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, who annexed it, with the surrounding Districts, to the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom. In 1523, Shol\u00e1pur formed part of the dowry of Ism\u0101il Adil Sh\u0101h\u2019s sister, given in marriage to the King of Ahmednagar. But not being handed over to the Ahmednagar kingdom, it formed for forty years a source of constant quarrels between the two dynasties, until it was given back to Bij\u00e1pur as the dowry of the Ahmednagar princess Ch\u00e1nd B\u00edb\u00ed (1563). On the overthrow of the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom (1686), Shol\u00e1pur fell to the Mughals, from whom it was taken by the Marhatt\u00e1s. At the close of the war with the Peshw\u00e1 in 1818, it was stormed by General Munro. Since then, the town, no longer exposed to the raids of highway robbers, has been\nsteadily increasing in importance. Its convenient situation between Poona and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d has made it, especially since the opening of the railway in 1859, the centre for the collection and distribution of goods over a large extent of country. The chief industry of Shol\u00e1pur is the manufacture of silk and cotton cloth, more than 5000 persons being engaged as hand-loom weavers, spinners, and dyers. A steam-weaving and spinning-mill has also lately been established in the town.\n\nBesides the courts of the Subdivisional and District revenue officers, there are the senior assistant\u2019s and the subordinate judge\u2019s courts. The houses are mostly built of mud, but sometimes of stone and burnt bricks, and are covered with flat roofs. On account of the absence of any high ground in the neighbourhood, Shol\u00e1pur is on all sides exposed to the winds. The climate, except during the months of March, April, and May, is agreeable and healthy. The municipality, established in 1853, enjoys an average revenue of \u00a35061; the incidence of taxation amounting to 1s. 9d. per head of the population.\n\n**Sholavand\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Madura District, Madras; situated in lat. 10\u00b0 2' 30\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 2' E., 12 miles from Madura city, on the Vaigai river. Pop. (1871), 2970, inhabiting 525 houses. The town was built in 1566 by a colony of Vall\u00e1lars, relatives of the Vijayanagar Governor of the South. The fort commanded a pass on the main road from Dindigul to Madura, and was occupied by Muhammad Yusaf in 1757, to cover the operations of Calliaud against Madura. In the same year, it was captured by Haidar Ali, and retaken by the British.\n\n**Sholinghar** *(Sholangipuram).*\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0 7' N., long. 79\u00b0 29' E.; pop. (1871), 4956, residing in 759 houses. A station on the Madras Railway. The scene of one of Coote\u2019s greatest victories in 1781, when, for the third time within a few months, acting on the offensive, with vastly inferior numbers, he drove Haidar Ali\u2019s picked troops before him. There is a famous temple here, perched on a high rock, which is much frequented by pilgrims.\n\n**Shor\u00e1pur.**\u2014Formerly a tributary State of the Niz\u00e1m; situated in the south-west corner of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, and since 1860 an integral part of His Highness\u2019 Dominions. Bounded on the north by Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, and on the south by the Kistna, which separates it from the Raich\u00far Do\u00e1b. Chief town, Shor\u00e1pur; lat. 16\u00b0 31' N., long. 76\u00b0 48' E. By the treaty of 1800, the British Government engaged to enforce \u2018the just claims\u2019 of the Niz\u00e1m against Shor\u00e1pur. In 1823, the British Government, having succeeded to the rights of the Peshw\u00e1, relinquished the tribute due to it from the Shor\u00e1pur R\u00e1j\u00e1, on condition of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 abandoning certain *rus\u00fams* (revenue claims) on the neighbouring British Districts. A succession dispute in 1828 commenced a long series of disasters for Shor\u00e1pur. The State fell into hopeless arrears to its suzerain the Niz\u00e1m, and in 1841-42 the portion\nof it to the south of the Kistna was ceded to His Highness in commutation. A British officer, Captain Gressly, was in the same year deputed to report on the Shor\u00e1pur State. He was succeeded by Captain Meadows Taylor (1842), into whose hands the practical administration fell, as the sequel of a series of zan\u00e1na intrigues, domestic quarrels, and acts of extravagance by members of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's family. The improvements effected by Captain Meadows Taylor, and the era of prosperity and order which he introduced at Shor\u00e1pur, form a brilliant example of the administration of a Native State by a British officer. They are recorded without exaggeration in Meadows Taylor's Story of My Life. On his departure in 1853, the affairs of the State began to slip back into their former condition, and the old unsatisfactory relations between Shor\u00e1pur and the Niz\u00e1m revived. The Shor\u00e1pur R\u00e1j\u00e1 threw in his lot with the rebels in the Mutiny of 1857-58, was sentenced to deportation, and shot himself. By the British treaty of 1860 with the Niz\u00e1m, Shor\u00e1pur State was ceded to His Highness in full sovereignty, and has since been an integral part of the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions.\n\nShorkot.\u2014Tahsil of Jhang District, Punjab.\n\nShorkot.\u2014Ancient town in Jhang District, Punjab, and headquarters of the tahsil of the same name; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 50' N., and long. 72\u00b0 6' E., among the lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b, 36 miles south-west of Jhang town. Pop. (1868), 3153. Stands upon a huge mound of ruins, surrounded by a wall of large antique bricks, and so high as to be visible for 8 miles around. Gold coins are frequently washed out of the ruins after the rains. General Cunningham identifies Shorkot with a town of the Malli attacked and taken by Alexander, and visited by Hiouen Thsang ten centuries later. Local tradition attributes its foundation to one R\u00e1j\u00e1 Shor, of whom only the name is known. General Cunningham infers from the evidence of coins, that the town flourished under the Greek kings of Ariana and the Punjab, as well as under the Indo-Scythian dynasties up to 250 A.D. It was probably destroyed by the White Huns in the 6th century, and reoccupied in the 10th by the Br\u00e1hman kings of K\u00e1b\u00fal and the Punjab. The modern town is a place of little importance.\n\nShoung-gyo-g\u00fan (Shoung-gyo-goon).\u2014Revenue circle in the Shwedoung township of Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 3799; gross revenue, \u00a3757.\n\nShr\u00e1van-belgol\u00e1 (lit. 'Tank of the Sr\u00e1vans or Jains').\u2014Village in Hassan District, Mysore; situated in lat. 12\u00b0 51' 10\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 31' 31\" E., between two rocky hills called Chandra-betta and Indra-betta. Pop. (1871), 1697,\u2014viz. Hindus, 1231; Muhammadans, 56; and Jains, 410. According to Jain tradition, Bhadra B\u00e1hu, one of the six immediate disciples of the founder of their religion, died here while leading a colony from Ujjain into Southern India. He\nis said to have been accompanied by the celebrated Emperor Chandra-\ngupta, who had abdicated the throne and adopted the life of a hermit.\nThese events, borne out by a rock inscription of great antiquity, are\nassigned to the 4th century B.C. The grandson of Chandragupta is also\nrelated to have visited the spot. On the summit of Chandra-betta\nstands the colossal statue of Gomateswara, 60 feet high, surrounded\nby numerous buildings. The hill itself is 3250 feet above sea level.\nAn inscription on the foot of the statue states that it was erected by\nCh\u00e1munda R\u00e1ya, whom tradition places about 60 B.C. The surroun-\nding enclosures bear the name of Gang\u00e1 R\u00e1ya, concerning whom even\nlegend is silent. The statue is nude, and stands facing the north.\nThe face has the serene expression usually seen in Buddhist statues;\nthe hair is curled in short spiral ringlets over the head, while the\nears are long and large. The figure is treated conventionally, the\nshoulders being very broad, the arms hanging down the sides with\nthe thumbs turned outwards, the waist small. The feet are placed on\nthe figure of a lotus. Representations of ant-hills rise on either side,\nwith figures of a creeping-plant springing from them, which twines over\nthe thighs and arms, terminating in a tendril with bunches of fruit.\nThese symbolize the complete spiritual abstraction of a yogi. According\nto the most reasonable hypothesis, the statue must have been cut out of\na rock which projected above the hill; or perhaps the solid summit of\nthe hill may have been itself cut away. The workmanship is still as\nsharp as if the stone had been newly quarried. Within the enclosure\nare 72 small statues of a similar description in compartments. On\nthe face of the opposite rock of Indra-betta are inscriptions cut in\nancient characters a foot long. Sr\u00e1van-belgol\u00e1 is known to have been\nan ancient seat of Jain learning, and is still the residence of the chief\ng\u00far\u00fa of that sect; but the establishment was deprived of many of its\nprivileges and emoluments by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. There is a considerable\nmanufacture of brass utensils, which are exported to distant parts.\n\nShr\u00edgonda.\u2014Town in Ahmednagar District, Bombay.\u2014See Sri-\ngonda.\n\nShr\u00edvardhan.\u2014Town in Janjira State, Bombay.\u2014See Sriwardhan.\n\nShuj\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Tahsil of M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab. Area (1868), 309\nsquare miles; pop. (1868), 58,889; persons per square mile, 190.\n\nShuj\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Municipal town in M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab, and head-\nquarters of the tahsil of the same name; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 53' N.,\nand long. 71\u00b0 20' E., about 3 miles from the present bed of the Chen\u00e1b.\nPop. (1868), 6095, consisting of 3950 Hindus, 1964 Muhammadans,\n27 Sikhs, and 154 'others.' Fort built by Shuj\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, one of the\nNaw\u00e1bs of M\u00falt\u00e1n under Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, in whose time the town\npossessed some importance. Local trade centre for the richest\nportion of the District. Tahs\u00edli, police station, post office. Municipal\nrevenue in 1875-76, \u00a3656, or 2s. 1d. per head of population (6268) within municipal limits.\n\n**Sh\u00fatar Gardan.**\u2014Mountain pass in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, dividing the Kur\u00e1m and Logar valleys. An important position, commanding the road to K\u00e1bul, and the possession of which, on the occasion of the retributive campaign after the massacre of Sir Louis Cavagnari in September 1879, enabled General Sir F. Roberts' force to advance on that city and occupy it almost without opposition. The ascent of the pass from the Kur\u00e1m or Indian side is slight, though the descent into the Logar valley is long and very steep.\n\n**Shwe An-daw.**\u2014Pagoda in Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma; situated a few miles north of Thayet town. It dates from the time of Nara-pad-di-tsi-th\u00fa, King of Burma (about 1167 A.D.), who is noted for his piety, his communication with Ceylon, and his frequent journeys through his dominions. He is said to have received from Ceylon a sacred tooth of Gautama, and while escorting it to his capital, he was warned by signs and portents to deposit it at the place where this pagoda now stands.\n\n**Shwe Ban-daw.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Mye-dai township of Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 4761; gross revenue, \u00a3543. Products\u2014rice, cotton, sesamum, maize, and cutch.\n\n**Shwe-Dagon.**\u2014The great Pagoda of Rangoon, British Burma, and the most venerated object of worship in all the Indo-Chinese countries. Lat. 16\u00b0 46\u2032 40\u2033 N., long. 96\u00b0 13\u2032 50\u2033 E. The annual festival in March is attended by pilgrims from all parts; and so great is its renown, that the King of Siam, not long ago, had a handsome *sayat* or resting-place built near. The pagoda stands upon a mound partly natural, partly artificial, in the angle formed by the junction of the Rangoon and Pegu rivers. This mound has been cut into two terraces, the upper of which is 166 feet above the level of the ground, and 900 feet long by 685 wide. The southern approach is covered with handsomely carved wooden roofs, supported on massive teak and masonry pillars, and has at its foot two immense griffins, one on each side. From the centre of the platform rises the profusely gilt, solid brick pagoda, springing from an octagonal base, with a perimeter of 1355 feet, and a gradually diminishing spheroidal outline, to a height of 321 feet, and supporting a gilt iron network *h\u00edi* or umbrella in the shape of a cone, and surrounded with bells. The space around the pagoda is left free for worshippers; but all round the edge of the platform are numerous idol-houses, facing inwards, containing images of Gautama in the usual sitting posture, and in a previous existence receiving from Dipengara, one of his predecessors, the prophetical annunciation that he too should, after the lapse of four *theng-khye* (a *theng-khye* consists of a unit followed by 140 cyphers), and the creation and destruction of\n100,000 worlds, attain to Buddha-hood. Between these idol-houses and the main edifice are several bells, and Ta-khwon-daing or sacred posts, each being surmounted by the figure of a Karawaik (the carrying bird of Vishnu). The bells are struck by the worshippers with deer antlers, left near for that purpose. On the east side is an enormous bell, 7 feet \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inches in diameter at the mouth, which was presented by Bho-daw Bh\u00fara. I have mentioned that theng-kye is taken to mean a unit followed by 140 cyphers. Strictly speaking, it is a corruption of the Sanskrit asankhya, meaning innumerable.\n\nThe whole of the early history of this pagoda must be rejected as untrustworthy, but the legend concerning its erection assigns it to the year 588 B.C. The story goes that it was built by two brothers who were guided by a n\u00e1t or spirit into the presence of Gautama, who presented them each with four hairs, and bade them deposit them with certain other relics which had been left by his predecessors on a mountain in Pegu. The guardian of the earth pointed out this peak to the young men, and the sacred gifts were deposited on it under a tree. The first accounts in which any confidence can be placed are those relating to Sheng-tsaw-b\u00fa, a queen who ruled early in the 16th century. The pagoda has been several times added to and re-gilt\u2014the last time in 1871, when, with the sanction of the British Government, the King of Burma sent a new hti from Mandalay, valued at \u00a362,000. The name Shwe-Dagon is derived from the Talaing word tak\u00fan, meaning \u2018a tree or log lying athwart,\u2019 which has been corrupted in Burmese into Dagon or Dagun. The Burmese word shwe means \u2018golden.\u2019 During the first Burmese war in 1825-26, the site of the pagoda was abandoned by the Burmese on the fall of Rangoon, and occupied by British troops till the close of the war. In 1852, during the second war, the Burmese anticipated that the British would attack from the south side, which was accordingly defended. But an entrance was effected by our troops on the east, and the great Shwe-Dagon pagoda fell a second time into the hands of the British. The hill on which it stands has been strongly fortified.\n\n**Shwe-doung.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Meng-d\u00fan township of Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Area, 82 square miles, almost entirely uncultivable waste; pop. (1876-77), 4394; land revenue, \u00a3296, and capitation tax, \u00a3291. Products\u2014rice, sesamum, cotton, maize, cutch, and vegetables.\n\n**Shwe-doung.**\u2014Township in Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 28' to 18\u00b0 50' N., long. 95\u00b0 10' to 95\u00b0 23' E. Area, 200 square miles; pop. (1876-77), 25,901; land revenue, \u00a32743, and capitation tax, \u00a32835. It comprises 17 revenue circles, each under a th\u00fagyi. Bounded by Henzada on the south, and by the Irawadi river on the west. The eastern limit is marked by the low\nToung-gyi Hills, which extend from near Prome town into Tharawadi District, and are covered with eng trees, forming a tract called the Eng country. The township consists for the most part of a plain, almost entirely under rice. Tobacco and vegetables are grown along the bank of the Irawadi. In the north-east, below Shwe-doung town, palm-trees are cultivated, and from these are extracted large quantities of tari. In the rains, the south-west corner of the township is separated by the D\u00fcn-ka-la channel from the Irawadi, and becomes an island. About 5 miles south of Shwe-doung is the Theng-bhy\u00fa Lake, supplied by the Irawadi, and 15 feet deep in the rains. The great northern road from Rangoon enters the township through the Eng-daing, and strikes the Irawadi at Shwe-doung, whence it proceeds northwards to Prome. This township contains the Shwe-nat-toung Pagoda, the scene of an annual religious fair.\n\n**Shwe-doung.**\u2014Chief town of the above township; situated about 8 miles below Prome, on the right bank of the Irawadi, and on the great road from Rangoon to the north. Lat. 18\u00b0 42' N., long. 95\u00b0 17' 30\" E. Divided into two quarters by the K\u00fala-khyung. This town is of recent growth, the old Shwe-doung or Shwe-doung Myoma, mentioned in ancient records, being now only a village some miles farther south, opposite Pa-doung. Pop. (1864), under 5000; in 1877-78, returned at 13,588. Accessible by large boats, Shwe-doung forms the port of the Poung-day and Eng-ma rice plains, the produce of which is largely sent to Prome. The town contains the courts and usual public buildings; also numerous pagodas, monasteries, and zayats, or rest-houses.\n\n**Shwe-doung Myoma.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Shwe-doung township of Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Rice cultivation is not much carried on, except in the south-west. The villages are chiefly situated on the bank of the Irawadi. At the northern end of Theng-bhy\u00fa Lake in this circle is old Shwe-doung, the present town of that name having grown up since the annexation of Pegu in 1853. Pop. (1876-77), 3332; gross revenue, \u00a3606.\n\n**Shwe-gnyoung-beng.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Tha-boung township of Bassein District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Area, 45 square miles; lying between the Shwe-gnyoung-beng and Da-ga rivers. Consists almost entirely of a waste plain, gradually undulating towards the north; rice cultivation in the west. Pop. (1876-77), 2426, largely engaged in fishing; gross revenue, \u00a3857.\n\n**Shwe-gnyoung-beng.**\u2014River in Bassein District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Falls into the Bassein river in lat. 17\u00b0 1' N., and long. 94\u00b0 55' E., and communicates with the Da-ga by several creeks. It is from 100 to 150 feet wide in its lower portion, but only navigable by large boats during the rains.\n**SHWE-GUN\u2014SHWE-GYENG DISTRICT.**\n\n**Shwe-gun.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Than-lweng Hlaing-bhwai township of Amherst District, Tennasserim Division, British Burma; on the left bank of the Salwin, along which is a teak tract. Pop. (1876-77), 1994.\n\n**Shwe-gyeng.**\u2014A District in the Tenasserim Division, British Burma; lying in the valley of the Tsit-toung (Sitoung) river. Area, 5565 square miles; pop. (1872), 129,485. Bounded on the north by Toung-ngu District; on the east by the Poung-loung range and the Salwin Hill Tracts; on the south by Amherst District; and on the west by the Pegu Yoma Hills. After the second Burmese war, this District included the Salwin and Tha-htun Subdivisions of Amherst District, and was first called the Martaban Province, and then Martaban District. In 1864-65, Martaban was joined to Amherst, and the District was called Shwe-gyeng. In 1872, the Subdivision of Rwon-za-leng was formed into an independent jurisdiction now known as the Salwin Hill Tracts. Several small transfers have taken place since. Headquarters at SHWE-GYENG TOWN.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014In the north, the District is highly mountainous, both the eastern and western ranges sending down numerous spurs which on the east approach to within a few miles of the Tsit-toung. Both chains diminish in height towards the south, and the Pegu Yomas recede, leaving a wide stretch of good land. South of Kyaikhto, a town at the southern base of the Poung-loung Hills, the whole country between the Tsit-toung and the Bhf-leng consists of vast monotonous plains covered with scrub forest or almost impenetrable elephant grass. At places, a pagoda, or a group of houses surrounded by a few tall palms, marks the village of some fishermen or salt-boilers, who gain a precarious livelihood from the muddy waters of the tidal creeks or the salt-impregnated soil. At high tides, the whole of the coast for miles inland is inundated; and so rapidly does the sea advance over the flats, that little or no chance is offered to the fisherman or turtle-seeker should he have neglected the warning sound of the approaching waters. During the dry season, the upper portion of these plains is easily passable by carts; but in the rains they become one vast sheet of water, with the tops of the tall elephant grass showing above, and almost concealing the pagodas and villages, by which alone the boatman can guide his course. Both the Pegu Yomas and the Poung-loung Mountains are densely wooded, and drained by small perennial streams. The passes over the former are mere tracks winding up ravines, and along the crests of spurs. Across the Poung-loung range are three principal routes,\u2014the northern runs up the valley of the Baw-ga-ta and across the Thayet-peng-keng-dat Hill to Kaw-lu-do, the northern police-post in the Salwin Hill Tracts; the central road goes up the valleys of the M\u00fat-ta-ma and the M\u00e1r-dai to Pa-pwon; the southern leads from the source of the M\u00fat-ta-ma to Hpa-wa-ta. The Poung-loung range, at the Tsek-le Hill opposite Shwe-gyeng, attains a height of about\n4000 feet, and terminates above Keng-tw\u00e1 in Ke-la-tha, a peak crowned by a conspicuous pagoda, said to have been founded many years ago at the same time as Kyaik-ht\u00ed-yo, above Tsit-toung. The chief rivers of Shwe-gyeng District are the Tsit-toung (Sitoung), also called the Toung-ng\u00fa and the Poung-loung; and the Bhi-leng or D\u00fan-won. The Tsit-toung rises in Independent Burma, and enters Shwe-gyeng at its northern end, and, after an exceedingly tortuous course, falls into the Gulf of Martaban by a funnel-shaped mouth 7 or 8 miles wide, up which the spring-tides rush with great violence, forming a bore. This river is navigable throughout its entire length in this District by large boats and steam launches. A chopping sea follows the rolling crest of the bore, and sometimes wrecks a boat in a few minutes. The most important affluents of the Tsit-toung are\u2014the Kwon, rising in the Pegu Yomas, and, after an east-south-east course of 60 miles, joins the main stream near Anan-baw; the Re-nwe, which flows into the Tsit-toung, after a south-easterly course of 90 miles, about 6 miles north of Shwe-gyeng town; the Rouk-thwa, navigable for a few miles above its mouth; the M\u00fan; the Shwe-gyeng; and many smaller streams. The Bhi-leng rises in the Salwin Hill Tracts, and has a generally southerly course to the Gulf of Martaban. At first it is a rocky mountain torrent, but as soon as it emerges into the plains it deepens rapidly. During the rains, it forms the highway between the Tsit-toung and Maulmain. At spring-tides, a bore rushes up this river, inundating the country around for miles. Its feeders are few and insignificant, but during the rains it communicates on the east with the D\u00fan-tha-mi, and on the west with the Tsit-toung and intervening rivers.\n\nShwe-gyeng contains five lakes, viz. Ht\u00fan-daw, Tsa-weng, Mwai-deng, Mi-khyoung-goung, and Nga-thwai-z\u00fat. The District has never been carefully surveyed from a geological point of view. The Poung-loung range is composed of gneissose rocks, and the whole of the level and alluvial plains are occupied by a sandy and very homogeneous deposit. Laterite formation prevails at places. The District is said to be rich in minerals. Gold occurs in most of the tributaries of the Shwe-gyeng river (lit. \u2018gold-washing\u2019), but the quantity found does not repay the labour of washing. Copper, lead, tin, and coal also exist, but are not worked. The chief varieties of timber growing in the District are teak, pyeng-gado, pyeng-ma, and thit-tsi.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 129,485, viz. 67,943 males and 61,542 females, or 23\u00b726 persons per square mile. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 28,682; females, 25,941: above 12 years\u2014males, 39,261; females, 35,601. Classified ethnologically, there were\u2014Karengs, 43,475; Burmese, 41,562; Talaings, 35,401; Toungth\u00fas, 4887; Shans, 3189; Muhammadans, 421; Hindus, 291; Chinese, 157; Europeans,\nEurasians, and Americans, 68; 'others,' 34: total, 129,485. By 1878, the number of inhabitants had risen to 139,432. The Karengs are most numerous in the tract east of the Tsit-toung, and belong to two great families, Sgaw and Pwo; many of them have been converted to Christianity by the American Baptist missionaries. The Talaings chiefly inhabit the plains; the Burmese, the country lying north of the Tsit-toung. The Yabaings, who are engaged in the rearing of silk-worms, are found mainly on the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yomas in Bhaw-nf. The Hindus, Muhammadans, and Chinese are all immigrants since the British occupation, as are also many of the Shans, of whom a whole colony came some years ago and settled at Weng-ka-neng, at the junction of the M\u00fat-ta-ma and Shwe-gyeng rivers. The headquarters, and the only town in the District with more than 5000 inhabitants, is Shwe-gyeng, founded in the last century before the Burmese conquest by Alompra; contains the usual public buildings; pop. (1878), 7528. Other towns are,\u2014Kyai-k-hto, an old town at the foot of the Poung-loung range, containing a court-house, market-place, and police station; Bhi-leng, with a population of 2074, founded in 1824, and containing a court-house and the usual public offices; Tsit-toung, on the river of the same name, said to have been built in 588 A.D., contains court-house, etc.; Weng-ba-daw, noted for its manufacture of pots, and as the chief halting-place for boats proceeding up the Tsit-toung; Kyok-gyi, at the foot of the Poung-loung Mountains, 34 miles above Shwe-gyeng, with trade in betel-nuts; Mun, Th\u00fa-rai-tha-mi, Pu-zwon-myoung, with manufacture of earthen jars; Gnyoung-le-beng, etc. Out of the 512 towns and villages in the District in 1872, no less than 318 contained less than 200 inhabitants, and 126 from 200 to 500; whilst 30 had from 500 to 1000, the remainder more than 1000, but only one above 5000. In 1878, the number of villages had risen to 564. The proportion of the population engaged in agriculture was returned in 1872 as 20\u00b780 per cent., and the male agriculturists of 20 years of age and upwards numbered 20,209.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of 5565 square miles, the total area of the District, only 175 are cultivated, and 3611 are capable of cultivation. The most fertile portions lie along the right bank of the Tsit-toung (Sitoung) river, towards the south. The principal crop is rice, of which 25 varieties are enumerated. Betel-nuts are very largely grown on the hillsides, near running streams, the water being diverted into the palm groves by artificial channels. Cotton is sown in the toungyas or hill-clearings, where the hill tribes carry on a nomadic agriculture. Tobacco, vegetables, and oil-seeds are also produced, but the out-turn is small. Rice is the only crop of which the cultivation has steadily increased. In 1877-78, the area under rice was 67,640 acres; under sugar-cane, 1020; vegetables, 1496; betel-nuts, 3738; mixed fruit-trees, 3619; cotton, 136;\nand oil-seeds, 128. The area under rice in 1871-72 was 50,773 acres. The chief rice tracts are in the Kaw-li-ya, Kweng-da-la, Gnyoung-le-beng, Re-hla, Kyouk-gyi, and Gamun-aing circles, the last being the most important. In 1877-78, the price of rice per maund of 80 lbs. was 5s.; of salt, 4s. 3d. A buffalo cost \u00a37, and a plough bullock \u00a36. The average size of a holding is between 3 and 4 acres. As a general rule, the land is held by small proprietors, and is very rarely rented out, and never for a long term of years. Occasionally labourers are hired for rice cultivation, and are always paid in kind.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The only manufactures in the District are pots, salt, and silk-spinning. The pots are made at Pu-zwon-myoung, a village a few miles above Shwe-gyeng town, where clay is procured on the spot; at Kweng-da-la, a little lower down; at Tshiep-gyi in the Kyouk-gyi township; and at Weng-ba-daw in the Tsit-toung township. At Pu-zwon-myoung, the pots are made for export to Rangoon and Maulmain and intermediate towns, but at the other places for local use only. The largest sized pots are sold for 10s., and the others for 3s. per hundred. Each kiln holds 1000 pots, amongst which are about 200 of the largest kind. The annual produce of one man's labour is estimated at 1000 unburned pots a month, or 7000 in the season, i.e. from November to May. The industry has been in existence for about twenty-five years. The pots made at Weng-ba-daw are solely for the salt-boilers, the pot-makers exchanging for salt, delivered at the rate of 36\u00bd lbs. for every 100 pots. The yearly out-turn averages 15,000 pots. In the Bhaw-ni and Anan-baw circles, at the foot and on the lower slopes of the Pegu Yomas, silk-worms are bred by the Yabaings as in Prome District. The annual produce of silk is about 9000 lbs., the value of which on the spot is \u00a3450. The quantity exported, chiefly to Prome and Shwe-doung, where, on account of the number of skilled weavers, there is the best market for it, is estimated at two-thirds of the total produce, or about 6000 lbs. Of made roads, there are only 16 in the District; but cart travelling is easy in the plains, and along the left bank of the Tsit-toung river a fairly good road leads to Bhi-leng via Tsit-toung, Kyaik-hto, and Keng-rwa. King Tabeng Shwe-htl, who reigned over the Talaing kingdom from 1540 to 1550, made a road from Pegu to Toung-ngu with rest-houses and gardens at intervals for the use of travellers. The road alone still exists, but is passable in dry weather only. During the rains, communication is carried on almost everywhere by boat; the total length of waterway is 250 miles. The journey from Maulmain to the Tsit-toung is made via Weng-ba-daw on the west, and the Shwe-lay Canal on the east, which is connected with the Bhi-leng river. To facilitate intercourse with Rangoon, an artificial canal has been cut from Myit-kyo on the Tsit-toung to the Kha-ra-tshu creek, and thence by the Paing-kyun channel into the Pegu river.\nAdministration.\u2014In 1857-58, the total revenue of Shwe-gyeng District amounted to \u00a329,200. At the end of 1865-66, the whole of the Martaban Subdivision was transferred to Amherst District. In 1877-78, the imperial income of the District was \u00a338,485, and the local funds yielded \u00a34085, making altogether a gross revenue of \u00a342,570, of which the land and capitation taxes and the fisheries form the chief items. For administrative purposes the District is divided into 4 townships, viz. Tsit-toung, Bhi-leng, Kyouk-gyi, and Shwe-gyeng. These comprise 28 revenue circles, each of which is in charge of a thugyi, under the Deputy Commissioner or his subordinates.\n\nFor some years after British annexation, the country continued in a disturbed state. Whilst Meng-Loung was in rebellion in Rwon-za-leng, a Shan prisoner, formerly a thugyi, effected his escape, and openly proclaimed himself on the side of Meng-Loung. The native officer in charge was murdered in cold blood, but a small detachment was immediately sent against the rebels, who were quickly dispersed. A strong police force was then constituted, which in 1877 consisted of 379 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 15 square miles and every 358 of the population. The total cost was \u00a37653. The number of prisoners confined in the small lock-up at Shwe-gyeng town was 79 in 1877. Besides the ordinary jail service, they are employed in oil and rice-cleaning mills. The State middle-class school in 1876 had an average monthly attendance of 58 pupils, all studying Burmese. The American Baptist missionaries have also boys' and girls' schools for the Karengs. But with these exceptions, the education of the people is entirely in the hands of the Buddhist monks and of a few laymen, who have opened village schools for instruction in reading and writing. According to the Census returns, the percentage of males below 12 years of age who are being educated is 9\u00b750; of females, 0\u00b717: above 20, the percentage of males who may be classed as educated is 26\u00b713; of females, 0\u00b738.\n\nClimate.\u2014Except in the hills, the climate is generally healthy. The heat is excessive from March till May; but a refreshing breeze blows from six to seven p.m. Towards the end of May, the rains are ushered in by violent thunderstorms. The total rainfall registered in 1877 was 156\u00b799 inches. The prevalent disease is fever. In 1877, the number of patients treated at the dispensary was 6914, of whom 343 were in-patients.\n\nShwe-gyeng.\u2014A township in the centre of Shwe-gyeng District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; lying on both sides of the Tsit-toung river. Bounded north by Toung-ngu District, east by the Poung-loung range, south by Rangoon, and west by Henzada and Prome Districts. The eastern and western borders are mountainous, and covered with dense forest, but between the lower slopes of the hills\nand the Tsit-toung lie fertile tracts of rice land. The other principal rivers are the Ky\u00fa and the Da-la-nwon on the east, and the Shwe-gyeng on the west. Most of these are navigable for some distance during the rains. In the west, the township is traversed by numerous fair-weather cart-tracks; the main road from Pegu to Toung-ng\u00fa is now being made, and the projected Tsit-toung Valley (State) Railway will pass through Shwe-gyeng. The town of Shwe-gyeng lies within this township, but it is not under the charge of the Extra-Assistant Commissioner. Chief villages\u2014Pu-zwon-myoung, the seat of a large manufacture of earthen pots; and Gnyoung-le-beng. Pop. (1876-77), 49,198; gross revenue, \u00a314,725.\n\n**Shwe-gyeng.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Kanoung township of Henzada District, Pegu Division, British Burma; situated along the right bank of the Irawadi. Thinly cultivated, principally with rice and garden produce. Pop. (1878), 3641; revenue, \u00a3684.\n\n**Shwe-gyeng.**\u2014Chief town and headquarters of Shwe-gyeng District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 55' 0\" N., and long. 96\u00b0 57' 30\" E., on the left bank of the Tsit-toung (Sitoung) river, at the confluence of the Shwe-gyeng river. Pop. (1878), 7528. Extending across the angle formed by the junction of the two rivers is a low line of laterite hills, on which stand the barracks of the small garrison, and a few houses, the remnant of the large cantonment established here after the second Burmese war. Where these abut on the Tsit-toung, north of the town, is the old fort and stockade, which the Burmese evacuated on hearing of the advance of the British column from Martaban to Toung-ng\u00fa in 1853. The main portion of the town, which is built regularly, lies in the low land between the Tsit-toung and the Shwe-gyeng, and during the rains is to a great extent flooded. The inhabitants are principally engaged in trade. The town contains the usual offices of a Deputy Commissioner, police station, post and telegraph offices, hospital and dispensary, school, and forest office for the examination of timber floated down the Tsit-toung. Shwe-gyeng is a place of modern growth.\n\n**Shwe-gyeng.**\u2014River in Shwe-gyeng District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. It rises in the high mountains north-east of Shwe-gyeng, and falls into the Tsit-toung at that town. Above Shwe-gyeng, where it receives the Ma-da-ma from the south, and where its channel suddenly deepens, the river is only navigable by the smallest boats. Its bed is sandy, and in places rocky.\n\n**Shwe-hmaw-daw.**\u2014A pagoda in the old fortified town of Pegu, Rangoon District, British Burma. It is a pyramidal, solid brick building, rising to a height of 324 feet from an octagonal base, each side of which is 162 feet long. It stands upon two terraces, the lower one being a parallelogram, with its sides 1390 feet long. The pagoda is\nsurrounded by two tiers of smaller temples; the lower tier contains 75, and the upper 53. Shwe-hmaw-daw, in common with most of the sacred edifices in Burma, is connected with a visit of Gautama, though there can be no doubt that he never came so far as Burma. Tradition asserts that whilst Gautama was staying on the Mat-k\u00fa-la Hill, near the sources of the Rwon-za-leng river, he was visited by the two brothers Ma-ha-tha-la and Ts\u00fa-la-tha-la of Zoung-d\u00fa, a village about 20 miles above the modern town of Pegu. To them Gautama gave two hairs, and, foreseeing that in the 1116th year of his religion the capital of a powerful kingdom would be founded at Han-tha-wad-d\u00ed, directed that these sacred relics should be enshrined on a hill close by Ma-ha-tha-la; and Ts\u00fa-la-tha-la obtained the aid of the Thagya king of their native town in carrying out Gautama\u2019s instructions. The King of Zoung-d\u00fa placed certain n\u00e1ts or spirits to guard the shrine, made grants of money and land to the pagoda, and dedicated a number of people to its service. The Burmese chronicle is very vague and fragmentary, until it comes to what may be called the historical period. In the year 1116 of Gautama\u2019s era (573 A.D.), Tha-ma-la and W\u00ed-ma-la established the kingdom and city of Han-tha-wad-d\u00ed, of which Tha-ma-la was the first sovereign. He found the Shwe-hmaw-daw still in existence, and he added to it, and dedicated 25 families to its service; and successive sovereigns kept the pagoda in repair. In 1209 A.D., A-n\u00fa-ma-ra-za, the twelfth king of the original dynasty, obtained a holy tooth from the King of Tha-ht\u00fan to enshrine in the pagoda; and Dham-ma-ze-d\u00ed, who came to the throne in 1502, received from the King of Ceylon a present of 100,000 paving-stones, of which 50,000 were used in paving the court or upper terrace. Towards the end of the 18th century, on the occasion of a visit from the King of Burma, the pagoda was thoroughly repaired, and the hti or umbrella canopy re-gilt. In June 1852, on the outbreak of the second Burmese war, the pagoda was the scene of some sharp fighting previous to the capture of the town of Pegu by the British.\n\n**Shwe-lay.**\u2014River in Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma; rising in the western slopes of the Ko-dek spur of the Pegu Yomas. It flows in a south-westerly direction, traversing the centre of the plain between the Yomas on the east and the Prome Hills on the west, till it falls into the Myit-ma-kha, north of the village of Keng-than. This river is known by the names of Shwe-lay, Wai-gyi, Wek-p\u00fat, and Khy\u00fcn-khy\u00fcn-gya, in various portions of its course. During the rains, boats of 500 bushels burden can ascend the river as far as Tha-bye-poung-gyi village. The Shwe-lay drains a rich teak country, and several attempts have been made to facilitate the removal of the felled logs to the Irawadi, but without success. This is owing to the numerous hill torrents that rush into the Shwe-lay during the rains, and bring with\nthem the forest debris, which during the dry season has rolled into their beds. Thus obstructions are formed; and the foaming water in a few hours bursts the banks, and either continues its course onward in the old channel, or cuts for itself a new one in the soft soil of the plain.\n\n**Shwe-lay.**\u2014Township in Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma; extending along the western slopes of the Pegu Yomas from lat. $18^\\circ 28'$ to $18^\\circ 51'$ N., and from long. $95^\\circ 30'$ to $95^\\circ 58'$ E. It includes the old townships of Shwe-lay, Rwa-bien, and Myo-doung, and is divided into 14 revenue circles. The whole country, except in the south-west, is hilly and covered with valuable timber. The other chief products are rice, cotton, and mulberry. The principal streams are the North and South Na-weng, and the Teng-gyi, but all are unnavigable within this township. Pop. (1876-77), 21,963; gross revenue, \u00a33,348.\n\n**Shwe-loung.**\u2014Revenue circle in the Tsan-rwe township of Henzada District, Pegu Division, British Burma; lying on both banks of the Myit-ma-kha or Hlaing river. Pop. (1876-77), 4,266; gross revenue, \u00a31,025.\n\n**Shwe-loung.**\u2014Township in Thun-khwa District, Pegu Division, British Burma; extending northwards from the sea-coast for nearly 100 miles, between the Pya-ma-law and the Irawadi rivers. Area, about 1,124 square miles. In the north, the country consists of a plain covered with scrub forest; the lower portion is cut up into islands by numerous inter-communicating creeks, and is dotted with temporary fishing hamlets. Shwe-loung comprises 6 revenue circles. Pop. (1876-77), 34,715; gross revenue, \u00a312,090.\n\n**Shwe-loung.**\u2014Headquarters of Shwe-loung township, Thun-khwa District, British Burma, and the seat of an Extra-Assistant Commissioner; situated in lat. $16^\\circ 44' 30''$ N., and long. $95^\\circ 23' 30''$ E., on the Irawadi.\n\n**Shwe-myeng-deng.**\u2014Pagoda in the Ka-ma township of Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Its name, which means 'conspicuous,' is derived from its position. It is said to date from about 100 A.D.; and subsequently, as it was found that the desires of many who visited this shrine were accomplished, it received its second name of Shwe-tsu-toung-byi, or 'prayers fulfilled.'\n\n**Shwe-myeng-deng.**\u2014Revenue circle in Bassein township and District, Pegu Division, British Burma; extending along the left bank of the Bassein river. Area, 21 square miles; pop. (1876-77), 3,224, chiefly engaged in rice cultivation and fishing; gross revenue, \u00a3653.\n\n**Shwe-nat-toung.**\u2014Pagoda in Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma; about 16 miles south of Prome town. It is said to have been erected by Tsan-da-de-wi, the queen of Dwot-ta-boung, the founder of Prome (circa 442 B.C.). The building has been since added to and repaired, and being profusely gilt, stands out conspicuously\non a low hill. Behind it are six other pagodas. The annual festival held in March is attended by about 20,000 people.\n\n**Shwe-thek-lwot** (lit. 'Golden Life Preserved'). \u2014 Pagoda in Thayet town, Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma. It was erected by Meng-gyi-tswa-tsaw-kai, the second king of the Ava dynasty, about 1373 A.D., as a thankoffering for the preservation of his life when he, as a child, was taken captive in Thayet-myo by the King of Arakan. This building is remarkable as being one of the most southern hollow pagodas; in Upper Burma there are many of this kind, but in the lower country the great majority are of the solid bell-shaped pattern.\n\n**Shwe-tshan-daw.** \u2014 Pagoda near Twan-te in Rangoon District, Pegu Division, British Burma; more venerated by the Talaings than even the great Shwe-Dagon of Rangoon. According to its sacred history, it was erected in 577 B.C. by Thamien-htaw-byin-ran, the King of Khambeng, and his queen, as a shrine for three of Gautama's hairs given to him by three pilgrims from Ceylon, on the occasion of their visiting him whilst he was tarrying in the Zeng-gyaik Hills. Subsequently, in 538 B.C., four more holy hairs were deposited in the pagoda by King Thamien-htaw-byin-gnya-kan-de and a hermit named Gyi-rf-ren-ga. Near the Shwe-tshan-daw is a grove of *thwot-ta-bat* trees (Sapota sp.), seven in number, the only ones in Pegu. The trees were cut down, it is said, by order of the Talaing rulers, when the Burmese conquered their country, because the produce was a royal fruit to be eaten by none but the monarch, and the present trees are shoots of the old stumps.\n\n**Shwe-tshan-daw.** \u2014 Pagoda in Prome town, Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. It is situated on a hill about half a mile from the bank of the Irawadi, and gives its name to a quarter of the town. The building is gilt all over, and is solid. Its height is 180 feet, and it occupies an area of 11,025 square feet. It is surrounded by 83 small gilt niches, called Ze-df-yan, each containing an image of Gautama. The pagoda stands on a paved platform, approached by four flights of steps, two of which, the northern and the western, are covered with elaborately carved roofs supported on massive teak posts. The gilt iron network *hti*, or conical top, is 10 feet in diameter at its base. There are on the platform 12 or 13 bells attached to massive cross-bars, which are struck with deers' antlers by those who come to worship. The pagoda is supposed to have been first erected by two brothers, I-zl-ka and Pa-lf-ka. Tradition alleges that when Gautama arrived near Prome, and was walking on the island of Zeng-yan, he was accosted by a *naga* or dragon, who begged for some sacred hairs to enshrine in a temple. Gautama refused this request, saying that the glory of building a pagoda to contain his relics must be reserved for two brothers who had gone on a trading expedition to Thu-wun-na-bhu-mi or Tha-htun. The *naga* then presented to Gautama an emerald box, praying that as he could\nnot receive the sacred hairs, he might at least contribute the receptacle for them. His gift was accepted, and shortly afterwards I-zi-ka and Pa-li-ka anchored at a place known to this day as Mya-rwa or 'Emerald Village,' and discovered the relics. Having heard of Gautama's prediction, that on the site of the modern Prome the capital of a powerful kingdom would be founded, they proceeded thither, and after considerable difficulty built the pagoda on the hill on which it now stands. Seven days after their departure for their native place, the pagoda sank into the earth. Owing to the prayers of King Dwotta-boung, the founder of ancient Prome, the pagoda reappeared, and the king restored it. The Burmese records give no further account of the sacred building, and oral tradition is all we have to rely upon. In 1753, Aloung-bh\u00fara coated it with gold; and in 1841, King Tharawadi thoroughly repaired the pagoda, which had been damaged by an earthquake, and put on it a new hti studded with jewels. Since then it has been again partially destroyed by another earthquake. It has lately been re-gilt, at an estimated cost of about \u00a32500, raised by public subscription. The annual festival is held on the full moon of Taboung, corresponding to March.\n\nShwe-tsu-toung-byi.\u2014Pagoda in Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma.\u2014See Shwe-myeng-deng.\n\nShwe-tsway-daw.\u2014Pagoda in Thayet District, Pegu Division, British Burma.\u2014See Shwe An-daw.\n\nSi\u00e1ldah.\u2014Village in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; situated just outside the limits of Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 35' N., long. 88\u00b0 26' E. Terminus of the Eastern Bengal and Calcutta and South-Eastern Railways. Seat of a large transit trade.\n\nSi\u00e1lkot (Sealkote).\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 56' and 32\u00b0 50' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 16' and 75\u00b0 3' E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1878-79, 1955 square miles; population in 1868, 1,005,004. Si\u00e1lkot forms the north-western District of the Amritsar (Umritsur) Division. It is bounded on the north-east by the State of Jamu (Jummuo) or Kashmir, on the north-west by the river Chen\u00e1b, on the east by Gurdaspur, on the south-east by the R\u00e1vi, on the west by Lahore and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. The administrative headquarters are at the town of Si\u00e1lkot.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Si\u00e1lkot, occupying the uppermost portion of the Rechna Do\u00e1b, stretches in a comparatively unbroken level from the valley of the R\u00e1vi on the south-east, to that of the Chen\u00e1b on the north-western border. Along the course of either great boundary river, a narrow fringe of alluvial lowland marks the central depression in which they run; while above them rise the high banks which form the limits of their wider beds. Parallel to the R\u00e1vi, another stream, the\nDegh, which rises in the Jamu (Jummoo) Hills, traverses the south-eastern corner of the District, fringed on either side, like the greater rivers, by a line of alluvial soil. The remainder of the surface consists of a level plain, slightly submontane in character, but lying at a distance of 20 miles from the outermost range of the Him\u00e1layan system. Midway between the R\u00e1vi and the Chen\u00e1b, however, a high dorsal tract stretches from beyond the Jamu border far into the heart of the Do\u00e1b. Spreading in its northern portion from the valley of the Degh to the high bank of the Chen\u00e1b, it narrows gradually as it runs south-westward, till it finally terminates in an apex about 10 miles beyond Pasr\u00far, thus forming an irregularly triangular upland wedge. The neighbourhood of the hills has imparted to the general aspect of the District a greenness and fertility rare among the Punjab plains. Two-thirds of its area have already been brought under the plough, and careful tillage might still increase the limit of cultivation. The upper half especially, close to the hills, produces excellent crops; but the southern portion, farther removed from the influence of the rains, shows a marked decrease of fertility. The poorest lands lie in the triangular dorsal ridge, where the naturally arid soil depends entirely for its water supply upon the local rainfall. Elsewhere, irrigation from wells or hill streams has turned the whole country into a waving sheet of tillage. The alluvial lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b and the Degh, however, suffer in parts from the injurious saline efflorescence known as reh. Between the Degh and the R\u00e1vi, too, the wild and unproductive upland grows more and more impregnated with saltpetre as it recedes from the hills, till near the Lahore border it merges into a tangled jungle of brushwood and reeds. Numerous small torrents traverse the north-eastern tract, and several swamps (jhils) studded over the face of the country are useful for irrigation. Traces of ancient canals may still be observed, some of which might repay the trouble of restoration. The most remarkable owed its origin to Al\u00ed Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the famous engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and once brought the waters of the T\u00e1vi to supply the imperial gardens at Sh\u00e1hdra. Trees are everywhere rare, and cow-dung forms the ordinary fuel, being used even in the cantonment of Si\u00e1lkot. A few wolves are the only representatives of the carnivora in the District, while even deer and hares find little cover in so highly cultivated a tract.\n\n**History.**\u2014Ras\u00e1lu, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Si\u00e1lkot, who lived somewhere about the first century after Christ, forms the great centre of all the local Punjab legends. General Cunningham identifies this possibly mythical hero with the son of S\u00e1livah\u00e1na, the Vikram\u00e1ditya who overthrew the Sakas in 78 A.D. Tradition universally points to the town of Si\u00e1lkot as the famous R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s capital, while a thousand stories keep alive his memory among the Hindus of the hills and the submontane tract. After Ras\u00e1lu\u2019s\ndeath, however, his kingdom fell under a curse, and remained desolate for three hundred years. About 643 A.D., the R\u00e1jput princes of Jamu overran the District, which they held until its union with the Muhammadan Empire. For a while the Hindu rulers managed to retain their possessions in the plains by the payment of a tribute to the Delhi Emperors; but under the Mughals, Si\u00e1lkot formed a part of the Province (subah) of Lahore, and did not revert to its ancient princes until after the dissolution of the Mughal organization in the days of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni. During that stormy period, however, the R\u00e1jput R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jamu once more made good their claim to the fertile and level belt which stretched at the foot of their mountainous principality.\n\nIn 1740, Ranjit Deo, the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1, under a grant from the Dur\u00e1ni Emperor, possessed himself, by force of arms, of a strip of territory stretching from Dinga in the Jetch Do\u00e1b to the valley of the R\u00e1vi. A powerful Path\u00e1n family then occupied the town of Si\u00e1lkot itself; while the remainder of the District was harried by bands of Sikhs, under the command of the Bhangi chieftains and of Charrat Sinh, grandfather of Ranjit Sinh, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Punjab. In 1774, Brij R\u00e1j Deo, son of the Jamu R\u00e1j\u00e1, rebelled against his father, and called in the aid of Charrat Sinh. The Sikh chieftain gladly embraced the opportunity; but Ranjit Deo met him on the banks of the river Basantar, as he marched on Jamu, and utterly defeated the Sikh forces, while Charrat Sinh himself lost his life in the engagement. The Bhangi chieftains, who had just wrested Si\u00e1lkot town from its Path\u00e1n masters, and dreaded the rising power of their co-religionist, gave their aid to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in this campaign. Mah\u00e1 Sinh, son and successor of the defeated chief, then turned southward, and began to establish his authority in the lower part of the Do\u00e1b. Meanwhile, Ranjit Deo died in 1783, and was succeeded by his rebellious son, Brij R\u00e1j Deo, a man of debauched habits, quite unfit to hold his own against the active and vigorous Sikhs. Mah\u00e1 Sinh seized upon the opportunity, and advanced upon Jamu in 1784 with a considerable force. The new R\u00e1j\u00e1 fled to the hills on his approach, and Mah\u00e1 Sinh sacked the defenceless capital without striking a blow. He did not attempt, however, to secure his conquest, but retired at once to his headquarters at Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. The Bhangi chiefs of Si\u00e1lkot and the Kanhyas from the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b thereupon completed the overthrow of the Jamu prince, and wrested from him, by the year 1786, all Ranjit Deo's acquisitions in the plains. Brij R\u00e1j Deo himself finally fell in battle, making a last effort to resist the Sikh encroachments. The whole District thus passed into the hands of the rising sect, and the greater part became the appanage of retainers of the Bhangi confederacy or misl. The Kanhya chiefs took the rest, except a few villages which fell to Mah\u00e1 Sinh. But Ranjit Sinh, son of the last-named prince, soon disturbed this amicable\narrangement of territory in the Rechna Do\u00e1b. In 1790, the future Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 appropriated part of the Bhangi domains; and in 1807, he made himself master of Pasr\u00far. In the same year, the Sard\u00e1rs of Si\u00e1lkot ventured to question his title to these new acquisitions; whereupon Ranjit Sinh promptly attacked and defeated them, adding Si\u00e1lkot to his growing dominions. By the end of 1810, the whole District had been swallowed up; while, a few years later, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 made himself supreme from the Sutlej (Satlaj) to the Sulaim\u00e1n Mountains. British rule was extended to Si\u00e1lkot in 1849, after the second Sikh war. On the first distribution of the Province into Divisions and Districts, the whole upper portion of the Rechna Do\u00e1b was formed into a single charge, having its headquarters at Wazir\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1850, however, this extensive District underwent subdivision, being formed into the two new Districts of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la and Si\u00e1lkot, while portions were made over to Gurd\u00e1spur and Lahore. Subsequent transfers of territory have brought the boundaries to their present shape. During the Mutiny of 1857, Si\u00e1lkot was the scene of an outbreak on the part of the native troops stationed in the cantonments. The mutineers laid siege for a time to the European residents in the fort, and remained masters of the whole District. The treasury was plundered, and all the records destroyed.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The area at present included in Si\u00e1lkot District had a population of 805,837 at the Census of 1855. By 1868, the number had increased by 199,167 persons, or 24.71 per cent. The latter enumeration extended over an area of 1969 square miles, and disclosed a total population of 1,005,004 persons, distributed among 2317 villages or townships, and inhabiting 200,570 houses. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 510; villages or townships per square mile, 1.17; houses per square mile, 101; persons per village, 433; persons per house, 5.01. (The area of the District, according to the latest Parliamentary Return, that of 1879, is 1955 square miles.) Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 546,159; females, 458,845: proportion of males, 54.35 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, below 12 years\u2014males, 201,014; females, 172,919; total children, 373,933, or 37.20 per cent. of the whole population: above 12 years\u2014males, 345,145; females, 285,926; total, 631,071, or 62.80 per cent. of the whole population. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 218,771, or 21.76 per cent.; Muhammadans, 601,959, or 59.90 per cent.; Sikhs 50,279, or 5 per cent.; and \u2018others,\u2019 133,995, or 13.33 per cent. A revised statement, compiled in 1873, gives the following analysis of the occupations of the people:\u2014Agricultural, 419,304 persons; non-agricultural, 585,700 persons. As regards ethnical classification, the principal Hindu and Sikh tribes comprise 35,928 Br\u00e1hmans, 11,734\nR\u00e1jputs, 19,274 Kshattriyas, 14,264 Aroras, and 86,362 J\u00e1ts, besides a few Banias, Gujars, and Ah\u00edrs. The Muhammadans include 13,570 Sayyids, 2831 Mughals, 3079 Path\u00e1ns, 45,465 R\u00e1jputs, 137,065 J\u00e1ts, 10,263 Gujars, and a small sprinkling of 'others.' The total number of J\u00e1ts\u2014Hindus and Muhammadans together\u2014amounts to 223,427 persons, and they form the finest agricultural class in the District. The Aw\u00e1ns, though not shown separately in the Census return, are a tribe of great social and political importance, being the leading Muhammadan race of the submontane tract. The District contained 5 towns in 1868 with a population exceeding 5000, namely\u2014Sialkot (town and cantonments), 25,337; Pasrur, 8527; Zaffarwal, 5641; Kila Sobha Sinh, 5153; and Chawinda, 5082. The total urban population accordingly amounted to 49,740 persons, or 4.94 per cent. of the District population.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of 1,251,324 acres in 1868, as much as 825,874 acres were under cultivation. The area under each crop in 1872-73 was as follows:\u2014R\u00e1b\u00ed or spring harvest\u2014wheat, 404,775 acres; barley, 65,273; gram, 6690; lentils, 19,929; tobacco, 6473; oil-seeds, 13,225; vegetables, 10,908; Kh\u00e1r\u00edf or autumn harvest\u2014rice, 85,463; Indian corn, 32,863; millets, 52,739; pulses, 22,377; oil-seeds, 7762; sugar-cane, 45,933; cotton, 47,237; vegetables, 8145. Wheat forms the great staple of the r\u00e1b\u00ed, and rice and millets of the kh\u00e1r\u00edf. The best sugar-cane grows on the land watered by the Degh, and in the lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b north of Si\u00e1lkot town. Millets, on the other hand, occupy the dry uplands in the centre of the District. Irrigation is widely practised, as much as 420,379 acres (or more than half the total cultivated area) being artificially supplied with water, according to the latest returns. In the tract known as Bajwant, nearly every field derives an abundant supply from a network of cuts and water-courses in connection with the Chen\u00e1b and its branches. Elsewhere, irrigation is carried on from wells, or by means of Persian wheels working upon the banks of streams. The value of manure is universally appreciated, and rotation of crops is carried out to a considerable extent. The village tenures belong as a rule to the intermediate type known as pattiddri. Rents are paid almost equally in kind and in money. Day-labourers are seldom employed upon agricultural work except at harvest-time, when they receive their wages in grain. Skilled labourers in towns received in 1872-73 from 6d. to 9d. per diem; unskilled, from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem. Prices of food grains ruled as follows on the 1st of January 1873:\u2014Wheat, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10d. per cwt.; barley, 39 sers per rupee, or 2s. 11d. per cwt.; gram, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; Indian corn and jo\u00e1r, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; rice, 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The local commerce centres on the\ntown of Si\u00e1lkot, which gathers into its b\u00e1zdrs more than half the raw produce of the District. The large markets of Lahore and Amritsar (Umritsur) afford a ready outlet for its surplus stocks, while the great rivers on either side form natural channels of communication with the lower parts of the Punjab. Grain of all kinds is exported to M\u00falt\u00e1n, Lahore, and Amritsar; sugar and molasses to Pesh\u00e1war, K\u00e1b\u00fal, and Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee). Arms are despatched inland to Jamu; shawl-edging, manufactured by Kashm\u00edr\u00ed settlers at Si\u00e1lkot and Kil\u00e1 Sobha Sinh, to Amritsar; and country cloth to the hill tracts. The return trade includes\u2014grain from Bat\u00e1la and the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b uplands; salt from Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n; rice, tobacco, and potatoes from K\u00e1ngra and N\u00farpur; ghi from Jal\u00e1lpur and the hills; timber from Kashm\u00edr (Cashmere); hemp from the submontane tracts of Jamu; and indigo from M\u00falt\u00e1n. The indigenous manufactures comprise silk, saddlery, shawl-edging, coarse chintzes, pottery, brass vessels, country cloth, cutlery, and paper. In 1869, an undertaking was started at Si\u00e1lkot under the name of the Belfast Flax Company, to encourage the growth of flax for exportation to England; but though an excellent fibre was raised in the District, the difficulty of procuring good seed, and the apathy of the peasantry (who would not adopt the new methods necessary to the production of first-class flax), caused the enterprise to prove a failure after some years' trial. The total length of roads in 1872-73 amounted to 9 miles metalled and 1064 miles unmetalled. The District contains three printing presses,\u2014one at the jail, which prints in English, Urdu, Persian, and Hindi; and two native presses in Si\u00e1lkot town, which print in the vernacular.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff usually comprises a Deputy Commissioner, 3 Assistant Commissioners, and 1 Extra-Assistant Commissioner, besides the ordinary medical, fiscal, and constabulary officials. The total imperial revenue raised in the District in 1872-73 amounted to \u00a3125,768; of which sum \u00a3108,598, or more than five-sixths, was derived from the land tax. The only other item of any importance was that of stamps. Besides these imperial receipts, a small provincial and local revenue was also raised. The incidence of the land revenue is high, being as much as 1s. 11\u00bdd. per acre in Si\u00e1lkot, against 8d. per acre, the average of the Province. The total number of civil and revenue judges in 1872-73 was 18; and the total number of magistrates, 17. The regular police force in the same year numbered 385 officers and men, while the municipalities maintained a separate constabulary of 185 men. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 570 policemen, being 1 constable to every 345 square miles of the area and to every 1761 of the population. They are further supplemented by a body of rural watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs). The total number of persons brought to\ntrial for all offences, great or small, committed in the District in 1871 was 6275. The District jail at Si\u00e1lkot contained in 1872 a total of 1152 prisoners, with a daily average of 460. Education, which was at a very low ebb during the Sikh period, has made a considerable start under British rule. In 1872-73, the District contained 427 schools of all grades (besides the normal school at Si\u00e1lkot), with a roll of 8491 pupils. The total expenditure on education during that year amounted to \u00a33275. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is subdivided into 4 tahsils and 9 pargan\u00e1s. The ten municipal towns of Si\u00e1lkot, Janki, Daska, Zaffarwal, Sankhatra, Chawinda, Kila Sobha Sinh, Pasrur, Narowal, and Mitrnwali, had an aggregate revenue in 1875-76 of \u00a33909, or 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head of the population (77,239) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Si\u00e1lkot may be considered as free from excessive heat, judged by the common standard of the Punjab. Even in the hottest weather, a storm in the hills produces a pleasing change; while in May and September, cool breezes from the Him\u00e1layas moderate the prevailing heat. The mean monthly temperature in 1871 was 87\u00b062' F. in May; 84\u00b076' F. in July; and 53\u00b043' F. in December. The maximum point reached during the year was 114\u00b0 F., and the minimum 32\u00b0 F. The annual rainfall for the seven years ending 1872 was as follows:\u2014In inches, 32'4, 49'4, 45'3, 41'1, 32'5, 33'9, and 24'4 respectively. It will therefore be seen that the fluctuations are far less wide, and the supply far less precarious, than in most other Districts of the Punjab plains. Si\u00e1lkot bears a good reputation as a healthy tract. Malarial fever, small-pox, dysentery, and pneumonia form the prevalent diseases. The itch also proves troublesome amongst the agricultural classes. The total number of deaths from all causes reported in 1872 was 31,079, or 31 per thousand. Of these no less than 18,556, or 18'66 per thousand, were assigned to fevers. The District contains 5 Government charitable dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1872 to 21,100 persons, of whom 488 were in-patients. The leper asylum at Path\u00e1nw\u00e1li consists of three barracks, capable of accommodating about 100 lepers. Cattle-disease occurs in the form of a murrain called waba, which carries off a large number of beasts every year.\n\nSi\u00e1lkot.\u2014Tahsil of Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab; consisting of a fertile agricultural country, lying around the headquarters station. Area, 628 square miles; pop. (1868), 380,031; number of villages, 809.\n\nSi\u00e1lkot.\u2014Municipal town, military cantonment, and administrative headquarters of Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab. Population in 1868 (including the cantonment), 25,337, consisting of 6148 Hindus, 16,580 Muhammadans, 1295 Sikhs, 13 Christians, and 1301 \u2018others.\u2019 Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 31' N., and long. 74\u00b0 36' E., on the northern bank of the Aik torrent, upon the edge of the high triangular ridge which\nextends southward from the Jamu Hills. Distant from Lahore 72 miles north-east. Founded, according to tradition, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1l or Sh\u00e1l, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata as an uncle of the P\u00e1ndava princes. Restored by S\u00e1lwan or S\u00e1livah\u00e1na, otherwise called Vikram\u00e1ditya, father of the great Punjab hero, Ras\u00e1lu. Headquarters of a fiscal District under the Mughals. Remains of an ancient fort crown a low circular eminence in the centre of the town, and are known as the stronghold of R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1lwan. Other similar mounds stand among the outskirts. The modern town possesses handsome and well-built streets. Historical interest attaches to the fort in consequence of its gallant defence during the Mutiny of 1857; a cemetery at its foot contains the graves of the victims. A temple erected by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tej Sinh has a conspicuous spire, visible from all parts of the town. The shrine of the first g\u00far\u00fa, B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak (see Amritsar District), is the scene of a famous annual fair, largely attended by Sikhs from all parts of the District. The Darb\u00e1r B\u00e1oli S\u00e1hib, a covered well, erected by a R\u00e1jput disciple of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak, also ranks high in religious consideration among the Sikhs. Muhammadan shrine of Im\u00e1m Al\u00ed-ul-hak, a handsome building of ancient construction. Three public gardens; sessions-house, court-house, treasury; tahsili, police office, jail; two sard\u00eds, school-house of Scotch Presbyterian Mission, post office, Government charitable dispensary. The cantonment lies about three-quarters of a mile north of the town, and contains the station church, a Roman Catholic convent school, a staging rest-house, and a public garden. Local trade centre of rising importance, with several wealthy merchants and bankers, the most prominent of whom belong to the Jain tribe of Bh\u00e1iras. Large paper manufacture, carried on at 165 mills, and giving employment to 1244 men, with a yearly out-turn valued at \u00a36720. Considerable manufacture of cotton cloth. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a32456, or 1s. 5\u00bdd. per head of population (33,035) within municipal limits.\n\nSi\u00e1ltekh.\u2014Village in C\u00e1ch\u00e1r District, Assam; situated on the Bar\u00e1k or Surm\u00e1 river, near the boundary of Sylhet, where toll is levied on the timber, bamboos, etc. floated down stream. Up to 1876, the river tolls at Si\u00e1ltekh gh\u00e1t were farmed out to a contractor, who paid rent at the rate of \u00a31500 a year. Since that date the toll station has been taken under direct Government management. In 1876-77, the receipts fell to \u00a3854.\n\nSi\u00e1na.\u2014Town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Siyana.\n\nSi\u00e1rsol.\u2014Coal-mine in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal, being a part of the Raniganj coal-field. The mineral is a variety of the non-coking bituminous coal, with a large portion of volatile matter and ash. The brighter portions consist of very pure coal, a sample of which gave\nthe following results:\u2014Volatile, 40 per cent.; fixed carbon, 57.5 per cent.; ash, 2.5 per cent. The composition varies, however, considerably, the percentage of fixed carbon in one sample being 51.1; of volatile matter, 38.5; and of ash, 10.4; while selected rich layers gave the following analysis:\u2014Fixed carbon, 57.25 per cent.; volatile matter, 41 per cent.; and ash, only 1.75 per cent.\n\nSibi.\u2014Religious fair in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore.\u2014See SHIBI.\n\nSibpur.\u2014Suburb of Howrah town, H\u00fagli District, Bengal; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 34' N., and long. 88\u00b0 16' E., opposite Fort William. Has grown since the beginning of this century from a small village into a flourishing town; inhabited chiefly by Government clerks. On the river-side are the Albion works, consisting of a flour-mill and a distillery, also a dockyard and a saw-mill. To the south of Sibpur are the Royal Botanical Gardens and Bishop's College. Permanent mart for District produce; bricks made and exported to Calcutta.\n\nSibs\u00e1gar (Seesausgor).\u2014A British District in the upper valley of the Province of Assam, lying between 26\u00b0 19' and 27\u00b0 16' N. lat., and between 93\u00b0 21' and 95\u00b0 25' E. long. Area (according to the recent Revenue Survey, which closed operations in 1875), 2855 square miles; population (as ascertained by the Census of 1872), 296,589. Bounded on the north and west by Lakhimpur District, the Brahmaputra marking the boundary for the greater part of the distance; on the south by independent N\u00e1g\u00e1 territory; and on the west by the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District. The administrative headquarters are at SIBSAGAR Town, situated about 11 miles inland from the south bank of the Brahmaputra.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District presents the appearance of a level plain, much overgrown with grass and jungle, and intersected by numerous tributaries of the Brahmaputra. Along the bank of the great river, the land lies very low, and is exposed to annual inundation; in the interior, the country rises towards the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills in the background, and the cane-brakes and grassy swamps of the valley give place to jungles of heavy timber. The District is divided by the little stream of the Dis\u00e1i into two tracts, which differ in soil and general appearance. East of the Dis\u00e1i, the surface is very flat, and the soil consists of a heavy loam of a whitish colour, which is well adapted for rice cultivation. The general level is only broken by the long lines of embankments which were raised by the Aham kings, to serve both as roadways and as a protection against floods. West of the Dis\u00e1i, though the surface soil is of the same character, the general aspect is diversified by the protrusion of the subsoil. The latter is a stiff clay, abounding in iron nodules, and furrowed by frequent ravines and water-courses, which divide the cultivable fields into innumerable small sunken patches, locally known as holds. It is in this western tract,\nforming the Subdivision of Jorh\u00e1t, that European enterprise has terraced the slopes of the forest-clad hills with trim tea-gardens.\n\nThere are no mountains within the limits of the District. The chief river is the Brahmaputra, forming the continuous northern boundary, which is navigable all the year through by steamers and large native boats. Its navigable tributaries comprise the Dhaneswari, Bur\u00ed Dihing, Disang, and Dikhu, which all flow in a northerly direction from the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. The most signal example of alluvion in the whole Province is afforded by the Majuli char, included within the District of Sibs\u00e1gar. This island is said to have been formed by the silt brought down by the Subansiri river from the Him\u00e1layas, and deposited in the wide channel of the Brahmaputra. It contains an area of about 400 square miles, almost entirely overgrown with grass and jungle. The fisheries of the District, which are Government property, yield an annual revenue of about \u00a31120 a year. Wild beasts of all kinds abound, including elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, bears, buffaloes, and deer. In 1870-71, \u00a3180 was paid to Government for the privilege of capturing wild elephants. The jungle products consist of caoutchouc, lac, bees-wax, and various fibres and dyes. The mineral wealth of the District is said to comprise coal, iron, petroleum, and salt, but none of these have been profitably worked. A little gold dust is washed in several of the hill streams. Some hot springs are situated near the banks of the Dhaneswari.\n\nHistory.\u2014S\u00edbs\u00e1gar District first rose into prominence as the headquarters of the Aham dynasty, which ruled Assam for about 400 years before the British annexation. Prior to the advent of the Ahams, the dominant race was the Chuti\u00e1s, who were of a kindred origin to the Ahams, and only subjugated by them after a fierce contest. At the present day, these two tribes form nearly one-half of the total population. The Ahams, a people of Shan origin, are said to have first made their appearance in Upper Assam in the 14th century, after the downfall of the legendary Hindu kingdom of K\u00e1mr\u00fap. They gradually spread down the valley of the Brahmaputra, until in the 17th century they were able to hold their own at Gauh\u00e1ti against repeated invasions of the Mughals. It does not appear that they brought any religion with them from their native hills; but in course of years they fell under the influence of Hinduism, and at the same time lost the virtues of military and civil administration, by means of which they had founded their empire. At last, in order to protect themselves against internal dissensions, they were compelled to call in the assistance of the Burmese, who tyrannized over the country with great severity, until they were in their turn driven out by the British in 1823. The original capital of the Ahams was at Garhgaon in this District, on the Dikhu river, a short distance south-east of S\u00edbs\u00e1gar town, where numerous ruins are still to\nbe seen. The city and its suburbs appear to have extended over many square miles of country; and the royal palace itself was surrounded by a brick wall, about 2 miles in circumference. It has been noticed that one of the many gateways is built of large blocks of stone bearing marks of iron crampings, which show traces that they once belonged to a far more ancient edifice\u2014thus attesting the primitive Hindu traditions of K\u00e1mr\u00fap as told in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. The whole is now overgrown with dense jungle; and the natural course of decay has been hastened by the hand of man, for the old bricks are found serviceable on the tea-gardens of the present day.\n\nThe second Aham capital was at Rangpur, immediately to the south of S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r town, which is said to have been founded about 1790 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rudra Sinh, the first Aham prince who submitted himself to the Br\u00e1hmans. The ruins of his palace, and of a temple which he built to Jais\u00e1g\u00e1r, still exist amid the deep jungle. To the eldest son of this monarch is assigned the excavation of the great tank, 114 acres in area, around which has been built the civil station of S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r. Rangpur continued as the royal residence until the year 1784, when the Aham kingdom began to be dismembered. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, named Gaurin\u00e1th, fled before his rebellious subjects, who had advanced against him from the east. He first stopped at Jorh\u00e1t on the Dis\u00e1i river, in the centre of S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, but was ultimately compelled to retire to Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed. With British assistance, he was enabled to return to Jorh\u00e1t, where he died in 1793. Apart from the ruins of successive capitals, the Ahams have left permanent traces of their power in the great lines of embankment running through the country, which are locally known as d\u00eds. These were constructed by a system of forced labour, and served both as roads and as protections against river floods. The entire method of Aham administration was based upon personal servitude. The country was parcelled out into executive Districts, each of which was under the control of a taskmaster; no money revenue was demanded, but compulsory service was exacted from every individual among the subject races as his contribution to the needs of the State. The recollection of this organized slavery still lives in the minds of the people. At the present day, it is found almost impossible to obtain labourers to work on the roads, or other Government undertakings. The peasantry are willing to take employment on the tea-gardens, when not occupied on their own little plots of rice; but to work for Government is held to involve indelible disgrace. Hence it is that the great works of the Aham period have been suffered to fall into disrepair, and the incursions of the rivers have thrown much good land out of cultivation.\n\nWhen the British expelled the Burmese and took possession of Assam in 1823, they were indisposed to undertake the responsibilities\nof administration beyond what seemed absolutely necessary. A military outpost was stationed at Sadiy\u00e1, at the extreme head of the Brahmaputra valley, but the civil government by European officials was not extended farther east than the confines of Nowgong. The tract that now forms Sibs\u00e1gar District, together with the southern portion of Lakhimpur, was handed over to a native ruler, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Purandhar Sinh, who was guaranteed the secure exercise of his authority on condition of paying a tribute of \u00a35000 a year. This unsatisfactory arrangement produced the results which might have been anticipated. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, protected by the British name from the consequences of his misrule, indulged himself in the most wanton oppressions upon his helpless subjects, and rendered their condition even more miserable than it had been under the Burmese invaders. It is on record that the country became so depopulated, that it was unable to furnish the British tribute. Under these circumstances it was found necessary in 1838 to dispossess Purandhar Sinh, and to place S\u00edbs\u00e1gar under the direct management of an English officer. The early reports of those days are confined to complaints of the extreme misery to which the country was reduced. The tea industry, however, has now brought back prosperity; and at the present time the S\u00edbs\u00e1gar peasants rank among the most contented and wealthy in Assam.\n\nPeople.\u2014Mr. Robinson, in his Descriptive Account of Assam (1840), roughly estimated the population of S\u00edbs\u00e1gar District, which then included great part of Lakhimpur, at 200,000 souls. Another estimate in 1853 gave a total of 211,477. The first regular Census was taken in 1871; and the enumeration, instead of being taken in a single night as in Bengal, was prolonged over the two months of November and December. The results disclosed a total of 296,589 persons, residing in 203 mauzds or aggregates of villages, and in 55,604 houses. The area of the District, according to the Survey of 1875, amounts to 2855 square miles, which yields the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 104; mauzds per square mile, 0\u00b708; houses per square mile, 19. The average number of persons per mauzd is 1461; of persons per house, 5\u00b73. Classified according to sex, there are 154,940 males and 141,649 females; proportion of males, 52\u00b724 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 12 years\u201455,222 boys and 51,404 girls; total children, 106,626, or 36 per cent. of the population. The ethnical division of the people shows\u201474 Europeans and 6 Eurasians; 227 Bhuti\u00e1s, 7 Chinese, and 476 Nep\u00e1lis; 29,352 aborigines; 175,884 semi-Hinduized aborigines; 76,933 Hindus subdivided according to caste; 928 persons of Hindu origin not recognising caste; 12,619 Muhammadans; 83 Burmese. The chief feature in this classification is the large proportion of semi-Hinduized\naborigines, as compared with the rest of Assam. On the one hand, the hill tribes of the northern Him\u00e1layas and of the eastern Burmese Mountains are poorly represented; while, on the other, the castes of Beng\u00e1li Hindus have not penetrated so far east. The great bulk of the population are pure Assamese, more or less converted to Hinduism. The once dominant race of Ahams, numbering 94,304 souls, still supplies one-third of the total inhabitants. Though they have now sunk to the level of common cultivators, they retain many of their ancient habits and institutions. Some of them eat beef and pork, and also bury instead of burning their dead. Next in number come the Chuti\u00e1s (31,342), who have already been referred to as of the same original stock as the Ahams, and their predecessors in the government of the Upper Valley of the Brahmaputra. The Kochs (23,965) are members of a tribe whose present headquarters are in the Bengal State of Kuch Behar, but who ruled at one time over the greater part of Assam, before the arrival of the Ahams. The Doms (16,277) are a curious race, who lay claim in Assam to high-caste purity, but reject the ministrations of Br\u00e1hmans. All these are classed in the Census Report with the semi-Hinduized aborigines. The aborigines proper include\u2014the C\u00e1ch\u00e1ris (15,320), who are largely employed on tea-gardens; 6862 M\u00edris from North Lakhimpur; and a number of minor tribes, of whom many, such as the Kols, Ur\u00e1ons, and Sant\u00e1ls, are imported labourers from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Among the Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans number 12,821, being especially numerous for an Assam District; the R\u00e1jputs, 332; the K\u00e1yasths, 2117; the Jain traders, from the north-west of India, furnish an aggregate of about 600. The most numerous caste is the Kalit\u00e1s (26,973), who formed the priesthood for the Kochs, Doms, and Ahams before the introduction of Br\u00e1hmanism. The Kalit\u00e1s now rank as pure S\u00fadras, on a level with the K\u00e1yasths, and are generally engaged in agriculture or Government service. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes), 282,969, or 95'4 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1ns, 12,619, or 4'3 per cent.; the remainder is made up of 283 Christians (including 203 native converts), 153 Buddhists, and 565 \u2018others.\u2019 The Hindus are subdivided into the four following sects:\u2014Tantrik, Bh\u00e1gvatiy\u00e1, Mah\u00e1pur\u00fashiy\u00e1, and Th\u00e1kuri\u00e1. There are five principal s\u00e1str\u00e1s or religious institutions of a monastic character, each presided over by its own high priest or gos\u00e1in, and 83 minor s\u00e1str\u00e1s. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j is represented by a few followers, who are all immigrants from Bengal. According to the Census Report, the Vaishnavs number 94; the Mataks, who are converts to Vishnuvism from among the aborigines of Lakhimpur, 84; the Gos\u00e1ins, or religious teachers of the various sects, 407; the N\u00e1naksh\u00e1h\u00eds, or followers of the founder of the S\u00edkh religion, 140. The Muhammadans of S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r\nare said to be descended partly from artisans introduced by an early Aham R\u00e1j\u00e1, and partly from soldiers left by the invading Mughal armies. Many of them have joined the Far\u00e1zi or reformed sect, but they are not actively fanatical, and have ceased to make proselytes. The native Christians are under the care of a branch of the American Baptist Mission, which has been established in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r since 1840.\n\nThe population of the District is entirely rural, being employed either on rice cultivation or the tea-gardens. The only place with a population of more than 5000 is SIBSAGAR TOWN, which contains (1872) 5278 inhabitants. It is situated about 11 miles inland from the south bank of the Brahmaputra, and, besides the houses of the civil officials, possesses a straggling b\u00e1d\u00e1r, in which a brisk business is conducted during the cold season with the neighbouring hill tribes. JORHAT, on the Dis\u00e1i river in the centre of the District (pop. 1310), is the home of several M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri and Muhammadan traders, who supply the wants of the labourers on the tea-gardens. GOLAGHAT, on the Dhaneswari (pop. 1615), is the only seat of river traffic in the District, being accessible to steamers from May to November. The ruins of Garhg\u00e1o\u0144 and Rangpur have been already referred to.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The staple crop throughout the District is rice, which furnishes two great harvests in the year. The s\u00e1li, corresponding to the \u00e1man of Bengal, is sown on low lands about June, transplanted in the following month, and reaped in November. Its finer varieties are sometimes comprised under the generic term of l\u00e1h\u00ed. The \u00e1hu or \u00e1us is sown on high lands about March, and reaped in July, leaving the field ready for a cold-weather crop of pulses or oil-seeds. A third crop of rice, called b\u00e1o, is grown on the borders of marshes or the banks of rivers, being sown about April, and reaped in November. This is a long-stemmed variety, and can keep pace in its growth with the rise of flood water. The other crops include Indian corn, several varieties of pulses, mustard grown as an oil-seed, sugar-cane, p\u00e1n or betel-leaf, and cotton and indigo raised only by the hill tribe of Mir\u00eds. The s\u00fam tree is an important object of attention in the neighbourhood of villages, for the sake of the silk-worm that feeds on its leaves. According to the Revenue Survey of 1875, only 298,836 acres, or about one-sixth of the total area of the District, are under cultivation, though the greater part of the remainder is capable of tillage. Manure, in the form of cow-dung, is only used for sugar-cane and other special crops. Irrigation is adopted in the case of s\u00e1li rice, when water can be easily obtained from natural water-courses. It is not customary to allow land to lie fallow. Spare land abounds on all sides, and the present tenures are favourable to the cultivator. As throughout the rest of Assam, the entire soil is the property of the State, and annual leases are granted direct to the cultivators. Under native\nrule, the main source of revenue was a sort of capitation tax, raised at the rate of 4s. on each plough, and 2s. on each hoe. The first land settlement, commenced in 1839, assessed the rate of revenue at 1s. 6d. an acre on rupit or moist lands, on which s\u0101l\u012b rice is grown, and 9d. an acre on all other lands. In 1844, these rates were raised respectively to 1s. 10d. and 1s. 4d. At the present time, bast\u016b or homestead land pays 6s. an acre; rupit, 3s. 9d. an acre; and faringh\u0101t\u012b, on which d\u016bs rice and other crops are grown, 3s. an acre. The average out-turn of unhusked paddy from an acre of rice land is estimated to amount to about 33 cwts., worth about \u00a34, 10s.\n\nThe rate of wages for ordinary unskilled labour is said to have doubled within the past fifteen years, owing to the extension of tea cultivation; and the demand for skilled labour has risen in a still greater proportion. Indeed, labour of all kinds requires to be imported from Bengal. In 1872, a common day-labourer was procurable with difficulty at 6d. a day. Male coolies on the tea-gardens were engaged for 10s. a month, and women for 8s.; but these rates could be almost doubled by taking task-work. A second-rate blacksmith or carpenter received \u00a33 or \u00a34 a month, and a bricklayer \u00a31, 12s. The prices of food grains have risen in like proportion. The following are the rates for 1872, which were somewhat above the average of recent years:\u2014Common rice, 5s. 5d. per cwt.; pulses, from 6s. 10d. to 12s. 3d. per cwt.; oil, \u00a32, 14s. 8d. per cwt.; salt, 16s. 4d. per cwt. In 1866, the year of the Orissa famine, the price of common rice rose to 14s. per cwt.\n\nSibs\u0101gar District is not especially exposed to either of the calamities of flood or drought. The valley of the Brahmaputra is subject to annual inundation, owing to the old embankments having been allowed to fall into a bad state of repair; but it is not known that the general harvest of the District has ever been affected thereby. Partial drought is sometimes caused by deficiency of local rainfall. The season of 1857 is still remembered by the people as having resulted in a scarcity from this cause, which raised the price of common unhusked paddy to 7s. 6d. per cwt. The people mainly depend for their food supply on the s\u0101l\u012b rice crop; and if this were to fail, it would be difficult to supply its place either from the other crops or by importation.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The local industries are limited to the weaving of silk and cotton cloth, the making of domestic utensils from brass and bell metal, and a coarse description of pottery. The silk cloth is woven of various degrees of fineness, and is divided into three classes:\u2014muj\u0101nkuri, the finest of all, from the cocoons of a worm fed on the add\u0101kuri tree; mug\u0101, the best known, from a worm fed on the sum tree; and erid, which is very coarse, from a worm fed on the castor-oil plant. The finest raw silk has been sold for as much as \u00a31, 16s. per\nSIBSAGAR DISTRICT.\n\npound; but the manufacture has greatly fallen off in recent years, owing to the competition of cotton piece-goods imported from Europe. The braziers are almost entirely supported by a system of advances made by M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri capitalists, at the rate of 6d. per pound for brass, and 1s. per pound for bell metal.\n\nThe trade of the District, also, is mainly confined to the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. The principal seats of commerce are Jorh\u00e1t, Golagh\u00e1t, and S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1rg town. The two latter places are the resort of large numbers of N\u00e1g\u00e1s during the cold season, who bring down cotton and vegetables to barter for salt, fish, poultry, and cattle. Cotton is commonly exchanged for half its weight of salt. There are no large annual fairs, similar to those held in Lower Assam. The principal exports from the District are tea, silk, mustard seed, cotton, and jungle products; the imports are salt, oil, opium, piece-goods, and miscellaneous hardware.\n\nThe cultivation and manufacture of tea is largely carried on by European capital and under European supervision; and in this industry S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1rg ranks as the first District in Assam Proper, being only surpassed in the whole of India by C\u00e1ch\u00e1r. The Assam Tea Company, which commenced its operations in Lakhimpur, had opened fifteen factories in S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1rg by 1852, with 2500 acres under cultivation, and an out-turn of 267,000 pounds. Soon after that date, many private gardens were taken up by Europeans and natives; and in 1869, after the recovery from the panic caused by excessive speculation, there were 110 gardens in cultivation, managed by 53 European and 233 native assistants, and employing a monthly average of 13,399 imported and 790 local labourers. The statistics for 1874 show 22,573 acres under cultivation, out of a total of 108,050 acres taken up, mostly in fee-simple; and an out-turn of 4,976,419 lbs. of tea, being an increase of 554,898 lbs. on the previous year.\n\nThe chief means of communication in the District are afforded by the Brahmaputra and Dhaneswar\u00ed rivers, both navigable by steamers. The roads all follow the lines of the \u00e1l\u00eds or old embankments constructed by forced labour under the Aham kings. The Trunk Road or Seoni \u00e1li, maintained by the Public Works Department, runs the entire length of the District for a course of 133 miles. The aggregate length of the District roads in 1872 was returned at 404 miles, of which 305 miles were classed as important. Wheeled conveyances are rarely used, owing to the want of good bridges.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870-71, the total revenue of S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1rg District amounted to \u00a393,853, of which the land tax contributed \u00a343,976, or 47 per cent., and \u00e1bk\u00e1ri or excise \u00a342,090, or 46 per cent.; the expenditure was \u00a335,194, or about two-fifths of the revenue, and the item of \u2018cost and conveyance of opium\u2019 absorbed \u00a313,842, which is properly a debit against the revenue from excise. As through-\nout the rest of Assam, owing to the circumstance that an assessment is made annually with the cultivators, the land tax is a very elastic source of revenue, having increased from \u00a37013 in 1840 to \u00a311,120 in 1850, and to \u00a348,758 in 1875. In the last-mentioned year, there were 3 covenanted European officers stationed in the District, and 6 magisterial and 11 civil and revenue courts open. For police purposes, the District is divided into 4 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. In 1872, the regular police force consisted of 283 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a34783; showing 1 policeman to every 8'42 square miles of area, or to every 1048 of the population, and an average cost of \u00a31, 19s. 7d. per square mile and 4d. per head of population. There is no municipal police or village watch in the District. In the same year, the total number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, was 841, or 1 to every 352 of the population. By far the greater number of the convictions were for petty offences. There is 1 jail at Sibs\u00e1gar town, and 2 Subdivisional lock-ups at Golagh\u00e1t and Jorh\u00e1t. In 1872, the daily average number of prisoners was 94, of whom 2 were females; the labouring convicts numbered 83. The total cost of the jail amounted to \u00a3761, or \u00a38, 3s. 6d. per prisoner; the jail manufactures yielded a net profit of \u00a392, or an average of \u00a35, 1s. 8d. for each manufacturing prisoner. The death-rate among the prisoners was 30'8 per thousand, as compared with an average of 58'5 during a period of ten years.\n\nAs is the case in Assam generally, education has made but little progress among the people. In 1856, the number of schools in the District was only 12, attended by 794 pupils. The figures for 1860 show a positive decrease; but by 1870 the number of schools had risen to 29, and the pupils to 1084. The reforms of Sir G. Campbell, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the village schools or p\u0101th\u015b\u0101l\u0101s, have produced scanty effect in this part of the country. In 1873, there were 39 schools under inspection, attended by 1440 pupils, showing 1 school to every 73 square miles, and 4'8 pupils to every thousand of the population. In that year, the total expenditure was \u00a3897, towards which Government contributed \u00a3619. The chief educational establishments are the Government English School at Sibs\u00e1gar town, attended by 133 pupils, and maintained at a cost of \u00a3361; and the Normal School, with 13 pupils. The American Baptist Mission, apart from its primary schools, possesses 2 printing presses, and publishes a monthly newspaper in the Assamese language, called the Arunodaya, first issued in 1846, whose special object is to promote the extension of education among the people. A second newspaper, the Dharma Prak\u0101\u015b, was started in 1870 in connection with the Auniah\u00e1ti s\u0101str\u0101, the chief Hindu religious house in the District.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the District is divided into the 3\nSubdivisions of Sibs\u00e1gar, Jorh\u00e1t, and Golagh\u00e1t, and into 5 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. The number of mauz\u00e1s or village units, each under a mauz\u00e1dd\u00e1r or revenue official, is 135. The only municipality in the District is Sibs\u00e1gar town, with a population (1872) of 5278, and a municipal revenue in 1871 of \u00a3702; incidence of taxation, 2s. 8d. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sibs\u00e1gar, like that of the rest of the Assam valley, is comparatively mild and temperate. Scarcely a single month passes without some rain, but the year may be roughly divided into two seasons\u2014the dry and cold season, extending from October to the end of April, and the hot and rainy season, occupying the remainder of the year. Dense fogs prevail in the early mornings from November to February. The prevailing direction of the wind is from the north-east, and it seldom rises above the strength of a moderate breeze. The mean annual temperature is stated to be 74\u00b0 F. The rainfall during a period of fifteen years has averaged 94\u00b716 inches a year.\n\nThe prevailing diseases are fevers of a remittent and intermittent type, dysentery and diarrhoea, pulmonic affections, rheumatism, cutaneous disorders, leprosy, elephantiasis, and goitre. It has been observed that in recent years the endemic fever in Sibs\u00e1gar town has become more susceptible of treatment, owing to the adoption of sanitary improvements. Sporadic cases of cholera occur almost every year; and in 1869, this disease made its appearance in an epidemic form from February to June, and is reported to have carried off about 700 persons. Epidemic small-pox breaks out about every fourth or fifth year, being propagated by the practice of inoculation. In 1874, out of a total number of 3464 deaths reported by the mauz\u00e1ddars, 1593 were assigned to fever, 780 to bowel complaints, 337 to cholera, and 88 to small-pox. In the same year, the vital statistics for selected areas show a death-rate of 29\u00b77 per thousand in the rural area, and 18\u00b74 in the urban area, which is conterminous with the town of Sibs\u00e1gar. Since 1869, a terrible epizootic has been raging among the cattle and buffaloes of the District. It is identified with the rinderpest of Europe, and is supposed to have been introduced from Bengal. The mortality has been very great, about two-thirds of the total number of cattle in the District having been carried off.\n\nSibs\u00e1gar.\u2014Subdivision of Sibs\u00e1gar District, Assam. Pop. (1872), 103,237. It comprises the 2 police circles of Sibs\u00e1gar and Birtol\u00e1.\n\nSibs\u00e1gar.\u2014Chief town and civil headquarters of Sibs\u00e1gar District, Assam; situated 11 miles from the south bank of the Brahmaputra, in lat. 26\u00b0 59' 10\" N., and long. 94\u00b0 38' 10\" E. Pop. (1872), 5278; municipal revenue (1871-72), \u00a3702; rate of taxation, 2s. 8d. per head. Sibs\u00e1gar was one of the capitals of the Aham dynasty, shortly after their conversion to Hinduism. There still exists a magnificent tank, covering\nan area of 114 acres, and several old temples on its bank. These works are said to have been constructed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sib Sinh about the year 1722. There are but few houses in the native town which are not in a dilapidated condition. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r, consisting merely of mud huts, runs along both banks of the Dikhu river. The public buildings and the houses of the European residents are built upon the embankment of the tank. S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r is the seat of some river trade. The exports are cotton and rice; the imports, piece-goods and brass-ware. During the cold season, parties of N\u00e1g\u00e1s from the hills bring down cotton and vegetables, to barter for salt, poultry, cattle, and dried fish.\n\n**Siddhaur.**\u2014Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Part\u00e1bganj, on the east by Sur\u00e1jpur, on the south by Haidargarh and Subeha, and on the west by Satrikh parg\u00e1n\u00e1s. Area, 141 square miles, of which 95 square miles are under cultivation. Government land revenue, \u00a311,986. The parg\u00e1n\u00e1 is divided into two sections, north and south. Pop. (1869), 100,937, viz. Hindus, 83,941, and Muhammadans, 16,996. Out of the total of 168 villages, 66 are held under talukd\u00e1ri, 54 under samind\u00e1ri, and 48 under pattid\u00e1ri tenure. The tract was originally in the hands of the Bhars, who were expelled by the Muhammadans at the time of the invasion of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad. Sayyids still form a great part of the population. The parg\u00e1n\u00e1 was first formed in the time of Akbar.\n\n**Siddhaur.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh, and headquarters of Siddhaur parg\u00e1n\u00e1; situated 16 miles west of the civil station, in lat. 26\u00b0 46' N., and long. 81\u00b0 26' 10\" E. Pop. (1869), 2203. School, registration office, and post office. The village contains an old Sivaite temple, and a Muhammadan mosque and tomb, in memory of one K\u00e1zi Kutab, at which fairs are held on occasions of the Siva-ratri and I'd and Bakr 'Id festivals.\n\n**Siddheahwara.**\u2014Peak in the Br\u00e1hmagiri range of mountains, a section of the Western Gh\u00e1ts in the territory of Coorg. Lat. 12\u00b0 21' N., long. 76\u00b0 3' E. This hill guards the pass by which the highlands of Coorg are entered from the east. On the summit stands a temple dedicated to Siva.\n\n**Siddheswar.**\u2014Village at the foot of the Sarishpur or Siddheswar range, which forms the boundary between the Districts of C\u00e1char and Sylhet, Assam, on the south or left bank of the Bar\u00e1k river. There is a celebrated Hindu temple here; and about the 18th March an annual fair is held, attended by 3000 persons. At the same time, a religious gathering for bathing takes place on the opposite bank of the river.\n\n**Sidhout (Sidh\u00e1wat).**\u2014Headquarters of Sidhout idl\u00fak, Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District, Madras; situated on the Penner (Penn\u00e1r or Ponni\u00e1r) river, in lat. 14\u00b0 27' 56\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 0' 40\" E. Pop. (1871), 3759, residing in 860 houses. The town formerly belonged\nto Chitw\u00e1il State, and later to the Path\u00e1ns of Cuddapah; it was taken by Haidar Al\u00ed in 1779. In early British times, it was the headquarters of the entire District. The town is notable for its melons.\n\n**Sidhpur.**\u2014Town in Baroda State, Guzar\u00e1t, Bombay; situated on the Saraswat\u00ed river, in lat. $23^\\circ 55' 30''$ N., long. $72^\\circ 26'$ E.

Station of Perron's\nbrigade under the Marhatt\u00e1s. Occupied by Colonel James Skinner after the battle of Al\u00edgarh. During the Mutiny of 1857, the neighbouring G\u00fajars, R\u00e1jputs, and Muhammadans attacked and plundered Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d; but Colonel Greathed's column relieved the town on September 27th, 1857. Prosperity returned with the establishment of order, and Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d is now one of the most flourishing places in the District.

Area, 58 square miles, or 37,023 acres. Chief products, barley and sugar-cane. Government land revenue, \u00a36087, or an average assessment of 3s. 3\u00bdd. per acre. The pargan\u00e1 comprises 51 villages, of which 48 are in the hands of Purihar Kshattriyas or R\u00e1jputs. The history of this clan is thus described in Mr. Elliott's Chronicles of Unao, pp. 58-60:\n\n'The present Purihars in Unao District inhabit the pargan\u00e1 of Sarosi, or, as it has recently become habitual to call it, Sikandarpur. According to their own traditions, they came from a place called Jigini (which is not to be found on the map), or Sr\u00ednagar, i.e. Kashmir. From that high hill country they were driven\u2014we know not by what cause\u2014to inhabit the sandy plains of M\u00e1rv\u00e1r. Expelled thence, they were broken into innumerable little principalities, which found no abiding place, and have undergone continual changes, till we meet with a small portion of the clan who settled, comparatively a short time ago, in a little corner of Oudh; and even here the name of the beautiful valley from which they came ten centuries ago is still common in the mouths of men.\n\n'The story of the settling of the ancestors of the clan in Sarosi is thus told. About three hundred years ago, in the time of Hum\u00e1yun, Emperor of Delhi, a Dikhit girl from Purenda was married to the son of the Purihar R\u00e1j\u00e1, who lived at Jigini, across the Jumna. The bridegroom came with a large escort of his friends and brotherhood to celebrate the marriage, and the party on their journey passed through Sarosi. As they sat down around a well (the site of which is still shown), they\nasked who were the lords of the fort which stood not far off. They were told that the fort was held by Dhobis (washermen) and other S\u00fadras who owned the neighbouring country. The procession then went on to Purenda, and returning, conducted the bride to her home. Just before the Holi festival, a party, headed by Bhag\u00e9 Sinh, returned, waited for the evening of that riotous feast, and then, when the guards of the fort were heavy with wine, and no danger was looked for, suddenly attacked and slaughtered them, and made themselves masters of the fort and the surrounding country.\n\n'Bhag\u00e9 Sinh had four sons, and they divided the eighty-four villages he had conquered at his death. Asis and Salhu, the two eldest sons, took the largest portion of the estate\u2014twenty villages falling to the former, and to the latter forty-two. The third son, Manik, was a devotee, and refused to be troubled with worldly affairs. All he asked for was one village on the banks of the Ganges, where he might spend his life in worship, and wash away his sins three times a day in the holy stream. The youngest son, Bhuledh\u00e1n, was quite a boy at the time of his father's death, and took what share his brothers chose to give him, and they do not seem to have treated him badly.\n\n'The law of primogeniture did not exist among the family, and every son, as he grew up and married, claimed his right to a separate share of his father's inheritance; and thus the ancestral estate constantly dwindled as fresh slices were cut off it, till at last the whole family were a set of impoverished gentlemen, who kept up none of the dignity which had belonged to the first conquerors, Bhag\u00e9 Sinh and his sons. For six generations they stagnated thus, no important event marking their history till the time of Hira Sinh. The family property in his time had grown very small, and he had five sons to divide it amongst; and, to add to his misfortunes, he was accused of some crime, thrown into prison at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and loaded with chains. With the chains on his legs he escaped, arrived safely at Sarosi, and lay in hiding there. His pride being thus broken, he resolved to send his third son, Kalandar Sinh, to take service in the Company's army. He rose to be Subahd\u00e1r Major in the 49th Regiment of Native Infantry; and in this position, through his supposed influence with the Resident, became a very considerable man. He knew that as long as he was at hand, no chaklad\u00e1r or governor would venture to treat the Purihar samind\u00e1rs with injustice; but on his death they would be again at the mercy of the local authorities. He therefore collected all the members of the brotherhood who were descended from Asis, and persuaded them to mass their divided holdings nominally into one large estate, of which his nephew Ghul\u00e1b Sinh should be the representative t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r; so that while in reality each small shareholder retained sole possession of his own share, they should present the appearance of a powerful and united t\u00e1luk, making Ghul\u00e1b\nSinh their nominal head. Thus the chakladdars would be afraid to touch a man who seemed to hold so large an estate, though in reality he only enjoyed a small portion of it. The brotherhood consented to this, and from 1840 till British annexation the estate was held in the name of Ghul\u00e1b Sinh alone, and they had no further trouble from the oppressions of the chaklad\u00e1rs.'\n\n**Sikandra.**\u2014Town in Agra District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 12' 59\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 59' 34\" E., 5 miles north-west of Agra city, on the Muttra road. Chiefly noticeable as containing the tomb of Akbar, commenced by that monarch, and finished by his son Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr in 1613. Fergusson describes the mausoleum as the most characteristic of Akbar's buildings. It is quite unlike any other tomb in India erected before or since, and the design is believed by Fergusson to be borrowed from a Hindu, or, more correctly, a Buddhist model. It is surrounded by an extensive garden of 40 acres, still kept up, approached on each side by archways of red sandstone, the principal gateway being of magnificent proportions.\n\n'In the centre of this garden, on a raised platform, stands the tomb itself, of a pyramidal form. The lower terrace measures 320 feet each way, exclusive of the angle towers. It is 30 feet in height, and pierced by ten great arches on each face, and with a larger entrance, adorned with a mosaic of marble in the centre.\n\n'On this terrace stands another far more ornate, measuring 186 feet on each side, and 14 feet 9 inches in height. A third and fourth, of similar design, and respectively 15 feet 2 inches and 14 feet 6 inches high, stand on this; all these being of red sandstone. Within and above the last is a white marble enclosure, 157 feet each way, or externally just half the length of the lowest terrace, its outer wall entirely composed of marble trellis-work of the most beautiful patterns. Inside, it is surrounded by a colonnade or cloister of the same material, in the centre of which, on a raised platform, is the tombstone of the founder, a splendid piece of the most beautiful Arabesque tracery. This, however, is not the true burial-place; but the mortal remains of the great king repose under a far plainer tombstone in a vaulted chamber in the basement, 35 feet square, exactly under the simulated tomb that adorns the summit of the mausoleum.\n\n'The total height of the building now is a little more than 100 feet to the top of the angle pavilions; and a central dome, 30 or 40 feet higher, which is the proportion that the base gives, seems just what is wanted to make this tomb as beautiful in outline and in proportion as it is in detail. Had it been so completed, it certainly would have ranked next to the T\u00e1j among Indian mausolea.'\n\nAn asylum was established at Sikandra in 1837-38, for the orphans whose parents had perished in the terrible famine of that year.\nSikandrapur.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Azamgarh District, North-Western Provinces; lying along the southern bank of the river Gogra.

Land revenue, \u00a327,883; total Government revenue, \u00a330,672; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a359,411.\n\nSikandra R\u00e1o.\u2014Town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of Sikandra R\u00e1o tahsil; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 41' 10\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 25' 15\" E., on the Cawnpore road, 23 miles south-east of Koil. Pop. (1872), 12,642, consisting of 7598 Hindus and 5044 Muhammadans. Squalid, poor-looking town, on a low, badly drained site. A great swamp spreads eastward, attaining a length of 4 miles during the rains. Founded in the 15th century by Sikandar Lodi, and afterwards given in j\u00e1gtr to R\u00e1o Kh\u00e1n, an Afgh\u00e1n, from which circumstances the town derives its compound name. During the Mutiny of 1857, Ghaus Kh\u00e1n of Sikandra R\u00e1o was one of the leading rebels, and held Koil as deputy for Walid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n of M\u00e1l\u00e1garh. Kundir Sinh, a Pund\u00edr R\u00e1jput, did good service on the British side, and held the pargan\u00e1 as N\u00e1zim.

Garrisoned in 1781 by the rebellious R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ch\u00e1it Sinh, but stormed by the British under Lieutenant Polhill.\n\nSikkim.\u2014Native State in the Eastern Him\u00e1laya Mountains; bounded on the north and north-east by Thibet, on the south-east by Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, on the south by the British District of D\u00e1rj\u00edling, and on the west by Nep\u00e1l. Situated between 27\u00b0 9' and 27\u00b0 58' N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 4' and 89\u00b0 E. long.; covering an area of about 1550 square miles, with an estimated population of 7000. The capital is Tumlung, where the R\u00e1j\u00e1 resides during the winter and spring, usually going to his estates at Chumbi in Thibet in summer to avoid the heavy rains of Sikkim. The Thibetan name for Sikkim is Dingjing or Demo-jong, and for the people Deunjong Mars; the G\u00farkha name for the people of Sikkim (which has been adopted by English writers) is Lepcha; but they call themselves Rong, according to Mr. Clements Markham.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The whole of Sikkim is situated at a considerable elevation within the Himalayan mountain-zone. Between D\u00e1rjiling and Tumlung, the mountains are generally lower than those of D\u00e1rjiling itself. North of Tumlung, the passes into Thibet have been recently visited by Mr. Blanford and Mr. Edgar, and found to be of great height. The most southerly of these passes (as described by Mr. Markham, in the introduction to his *Thibet*, second edition, 1879) is that of Jelep-la, about 50 miles beyond Tumlung, 13,000 feet above sea level. The two next to the north are those of Guatiula and Yak-la, the latter 14,000 feet high: these, Mr. Markham says, are rarely interrupted by snow for many days, and form the easiest route into the Chumbi valley of Thibet. Further to the north is the Cho-la Pass, 15,000 feet high, on the direct road from Tumlung to Chumbi. The Yak-la, Cho-la, and Jelep-la Passes cross the lofty spur of the Himalayas separating the Chumbi and T\u00edsta valleys. Then comes the Tankra-la Pass, 16,083 feet high, the most snowy pass in Sikkim.\n\nSikkim is drained by the river T\u00edsta, and its affluents the Lachen, the Lachung, the B\u00fari Ranj\u00edt, the Moing, the Rangri, and the Rangchu. The Am-machu rises near Parijong, at the foot of the Chamalhari Peak (23,929 feet), and flows through the Chumbi valley, which is a strip of Tibetan territory separating Sikkim from Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. In this lower part of its course, the Am-machu passes into the British District of Jalp\u00e1i-guri, under the name of the Torsha. The rivers of Sikkim generally run in very deep ravines between the mountains; and the ascent from the bank, for the first thousand feet, is almost precipitous. All the rivers are very rapid. According to Dr. Hooker's measurement, the Ranj\u00edt, in a course of 23 miles, between the gh\u00e1t above the Kulhait river and that at the cane-bridge below D\u00e1rjiling, falls 987 feet; whilst the T\u00edsta falls 821 feet in about 10 miles, and flows in places at the rate of 14 miles an hour.\n\nNear Mintugong are some copper mines, worked by Nep\u00e1lse. Mr. Edgar (*Report on a Visit to Sikkim and the Thibetan Frontier*, 1874, p. 84) found that the Bhuti\u00e1 population are superstitiously averse to any search for metals below the earth's surface; and consequently little is known of the mineral resources of the country. Mr. Edgar, however, was of opinion that every mine is abandoned long before the vein of ore has been exhausted.\n\nThe valleys and slopes of this mountainous land are clothed with dense jungle, the vegetation in which varies, according to the elevation, from the cotton, banian, fig, and other tropical trees, which are found in the lower zones, to the fir, rhododendron, and dwarf bamboo, which appear above the level of 10,000 feet. The bamboo grows to enormous size, often attaining a diameter of 7 to 9 inches. The canes, which are largely used in the construction of the well-known\nHim\u00e1layan cane-bridges, grow principally in the bamboo jungles. The cane is found of the diameter of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 inches; and a single piece was once traced through the jungle by Colonel Gawler (Sikkim; Mountain and Jungle Warfare, 1873, p. 13) for a distance of 80 yards without finding the end. The wild animals are the same as those found in the jungles of Darjiling. Travellers in Sikkim suffer greatly from the pipsa, and from the leeches which abound everywhere. Colonel Gawler writes of them: 'The jungles are infested with leeches, which penetrate loosely woven clothes, and deprive the wearer of a good deal of blood before he finds them out. They get far up the noses of horses, goats, etc., and cannot be removed without subjecting the poor animal to a couple of days without water, which, being afterwards offered to him, the leeches also want to drink, and may be seized. If the leeches are allowed to remain, the animals become reduced to a skeleton.'\n\nHistory.\u2014Sikkim was known to early European travellers, such as Horace della Penna and Samuel Van de Putte, under the name of Bramashon (see Markham's Thibet, p. 64); whilst Bogle called it Demojong. Local traditions assert that the ancestors of the Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1jas of Sikkim originally came from the neighbourhood of Lhasa in Thibet, and settled at Gantak. About the middle of the 16th century, the head of the family was named Pencho Namgay; and to him repaired three Thibetan monks, professors of the Dupka (or 'Red Cap') sect of Buddhism, who were disgusted at the predominance of the Galukpa sect in Thibet. These Lamas, according to Mr. Edgar's Report, succeeded in converting the Lepchas of Sikkim to their own faith, and in making Pencho Namgay R\u00e1ja of the land. The avatars of two of these Lamas are now the heads, respectively, of the great monasteries of Pemiongchi and Tassiding. In 1788, the G\u00farkhas invaded Sikkim, in the governorship of the Morang, and only retired, in 1789, on the Thibetan Government ceding to them a piece of territory at the head of the Kuti Pass. But in 1792, on a second invasion of Thibetan territory by the G\u00farkhas, an immense Chinese army advanced to the support of the Thibetans, defeated the G\u00farkhas, and dictated terms to them almost at the gates of Khatmandu. On the breaking out of the Nep\u00e1l war in 1814, Major Latter, at the head of a British force, occupied the Morang, and formed an alliance with the R\u00e1ja of Sikkim, who gladly seized the opportunity of revenging himself on the G\u00farkhas. At the close of the war, in 1816, the R\u00e1ja was rewarded by a considerable accession of territory, which had been ceded to the British by Nep\u00e1l, and by the usual guarantee of protection. In February 1835, the R\u00e1ja made a formal cession of Darjiling to the British, and received a pension of \u00a3300 per annum in acknowledgment thereof. There was, however, a standing cause of quarrel between the R\u00e1ja and the paramount power, due to the prevalence of slavery in Sikkim: the R\u00e1ja's subjects were\ninveterate kidnappers, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself was most anxious to obtain from the British authorities the restoration of runaway slaves. With some absurd notion of enforcing the latter demand, two gentlemen (Dr. Campbell, the Superintendent of D\u00e1rj\u00ecling, and Dr. Hooker, the famous naturalist) were seized in 1849, whilst travelling in Sikkim, and detained for six weeks. As a punishment for this outrage, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's pension was stopped, and a piece of territory, including the lower course of the T\u00edsta and the Sikkim tar\u00e1\u00ed, was annexed. The practice, however, of kidnapping Beng\u00e1li subjects of the British Crown was not discontinued; and two specially gross cases, in 1860, led to an order from Calcutta, that the Sikkim territory, north of the Ramm\u00e1n river and west of the B\u00fari Ranj\u00edt, should be occupied until restitution was made. Colonel Gawler, at the head of a British force, with the Hon. Ashley Eden as envoy, advanced into Sikkim, and proceeded to Tumlung, when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was forced to make full restitution, and to sign another treaty, in March 1861, which secured the rights of free trade, of protection for travellers, and of road-making. Since the ratification of this treaty, relations with Sikkim have been uniformly friendly, and the country has been repeatedly explored by travellers, who have followed in the footsteps of Dr. Hooker. In 1873, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sikkim, accompanied by his brother and minister, Changzed Rabu (a man of great abilities and predominating influence), and other members of his family, paid a visit to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal at D\u00e1rj\u00ecling; and in the following winter, Mr. Edgar, C.S.I., returned the R\u00e1j\u00e1's visit, as the representative of the Bengal Government, and obtained the materials for the valuable Report quoted above.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014The population of Sikkim was estimated by Dr. Campbell at 7000; of whom about 3000 are Lepchas, 2000 Bhutias, and 1000 Limbus. Eastward of the T\u00edsta, Colonel Gawler found some Thibetans. The Buddhist monks\u2014each monastery under its own head Lama\u2014form a numerous and influential section of the population. The chief villages are Tumlung (the capital) and Gantak; the chief monasteries are those of Labrong near Tumlung, Pemiongchi, and Tassiding. The head of the Labrong monastery is called the Kupgain Lama; and Mr. Edgar states that he is also the superior of Pemiongchi, and of nearly two-thirds of the monasteries of Sikkim. On the Tumlung Hill, besides the R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace, there are a number of other substantially built houses belonging to the various officials of the State. Each house is surrounded by some cultivated land, in which are generally a few clumps of bamboos or fruit-trees. During the rainy season, many of these houses are vacant, the officials being absent with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 at Chumbi in Thibet. The house of the K\u00e1zi at Gantak is described as 'a very ornamental building of wattle and dab, raised on stout posts.'\nAgriculture, Land Tenures, and Revenue System.\u2014The chief cultivated crops in the valleys and in the clearings on the hills of Sikkim are wheat, buckwheat, barley, marud, maize, and a little rice; but no more grain is grown than suffices for local consumption. Cardamoms and oil-seeds are cultivated in the low valleys in the extreme west of the State. Plantains, oranges, and other fruits are grown in the gardens. Cattle and ponies are imported from Thibet. Between Pemiongchi and the little Ranjit, there is a curious tract of level country, described by Mr. Edgar as a great even ledge, some square miles in extent, with hills rising abruptly from it on three sides, whilst on the fourth side there is a precipitous fall of many hundred feet. The soil of this plain is exceedingly rich, as it catches all the silt of the upper hills; and every inch of it is highly cultivated, chiefly with cardamoms, oil-seeds, and other valuable crops.\n\nMr. Edgar gives the following interesting account of the revenue system and land tenures:\n\n'There are twelve K\u00e1zis in Sikkim, and several other officers with various names exercise jurisdiction over specific tracts of land. Each of these officers assesses the revenue payable by all the people settled on the lands within his jurisdiction, and, as far as I can make out, keeps the greater portion for himself, paying over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a certain fixed contribution. At the same time, he has no proprietary right in the lands, though the K\u00e1zis have at least a kind of hereditary title to their office. The K\u00e1zis and other officers exercise limited civil and criminal jurisdiction within the lands the revenue of which they collect, all important cases being referred to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and decided by Changzed (the minister) and the Diw\u00e1ns, who are at present three in number. The cultivators have no title to the soil, and a man can settle down and cultivate any land he may find unoccupied without any formality whatever; and when once he has occupied the land, no one but the R\u00e1j\u00e1 can turn him out. But the R\u00e1j\u00e1 can eject him at any time; and if he should cease to occupy the land, he would not retain any lien upon it. There is a kind of tenant-right, however, under which cultivators are enabled to dispose of unexhausted improvements. Thus, as it was explained to me, a man who has terraced a piece of hillside could not sell the land, but is allowed to sell the right of using the terraces. This custom is acknowledged not to be absolutely a right, but more of the nature of an indulgence on the part of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, by whom it was allowed to grow up for the sake of convenience.\n\n'The land is not assessed, and pays no revenue. The assessment is on the revenue-payer personally. I think that in theory he is allowed the use of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's land in order that he may live and be able to render to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 the services which he is bound to perform as the R\u00e1j\u00e1's live chattel; and possibly if the system were carried to theoretical\nperfection, he would be bound to give over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 all the net produce of the land\u2014that is, all the fruit of his labour beyond what might be actually necessary to support himself and his family. In practice, the subject is only bound to give a certain portion of his labour, or of the fruit of his labour, to the State; and when he does not give actual service, the amount of his property is roughly assessed, and his contribution to the State fixed accordingly; but such assessment is made without the slightest reference to the amount of land occupied by the subject. The value of his wives and children, slaves, cattle, furniture, etc., are all taken into account, but not the extent of his fields.' The Lamas are not bound to labour for the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and they pay no dues of any kind, no matter how much land may be cultivated by themselves or their bondsmen.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014There are several trade routes through Sikkim, from the British District of D\u00e1rj\u00ecling into Thibet; but owing partly to the natural difficulties of the country, and partly to the jealousy of the Thibetans, these are not much used. At Rangpo-tang, on the T\u00edsta, and at other points, there are good cane-bridges, and in some places there are raft-ferries; but all roads are mere hill bridle-paths, and communication is exceedingly imperfect and difficult. The Report of the British envoy in 1861 stated that a considerable trade between Bengal and Thibet would be the almost certain result of improved communications through Sikkim; the Thibetans exporting gold, silver, ponies, musk, borax, wool, turquoises, silk, and manj\u00ect or madder, in exchange for broadcloth, bleached goods, tobacco, and pearls. In addition to this transit trade, Sikkim supplies ponies, sheep, and jungle produce to the British territory of D\u00e1rj\u00ecling, and imports therefrom some British manufactures, tobacco, etc. A registration station has been established at Ranjit. In 1876-77, the total exports from Sikkim into D\u00e1rj\u00ecling were valued at \u00a380,265, of which timber alone represented \u00a370,870; the total imports were valued at \u00a314,164, chiefly indigo (\u00a36600), cattle (\u00a32322), metals (\u00a31773), piece-goods (\u00a31357), tobacco (\u00a3967). In 1877-78, the registered exports fell to \u00a31822, and the imports to \u00a31659.\n\nClimate and Medical Aspects.\u2014The ranges between D\u00e1rj\u00ecling and Tumlung are lower than D\u00e1rj\u00ecling itself, and generally less cool; whilst the deep narrow valleys of most of the rivers have a hot and stifling climate, notorious for its malaria and jungle-fever. The rainfall, like that of D\u00e1rj\u00ecling, is very heavy. There is usually a little dulness, and perhaps rain, late in December and early in January; after which the weather remains bright and clear until May, when storms, growing more and more frequent, usher in the rainy season, which lasts till October.\n\nSikrol (Sirol).\u2014Western suburb of Benares City, containing the military cantonments, civil station, and European quarter. Lat. 25\u00b0\n20\u00b0 20\" N., long. 83\u00b0 1' 20\" E. The little river Barn\u00e1 flows through the suburb, dividing it into two parts. Church, official buildings, numerous well-built bungalows, standing amid gardens and groves.\n\nSil\u00e1i.\u2014River of Bengal; rises in the Fiscal Division of L\u00e1dhurk\u00e1, M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, and flows in a south-easterly direction into the District of Midnapur. After a tortuous course it falls into the Rupnarayan, of which it forms the chief tributary, near the point where that river touches the eastern boundary of Midnapur. The Sil\u00e1i is subject to destructive floods; it is only navigable throughout the year for a short distance in its lower reaches, which are within tidal influence. It is fed by two small streams from B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, on the north\u2014the Purandarnadi and Gopa-nadi. The other and principal feeder of the Sil\u00e1i is the Burl-nadi, which takes its rise in the north-west of Midnapur District, and flows east into the Sil\u00e1i near N\u00e1r\u00e1jol.\n\nSil\u00e1na.\u2014One of the petty States of South K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3300; of which \u00a310 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nSil\u00e1n\u00e1th.\u2014Village in Darbhangah District, Bengal; situated on the Kaml\u00e1 river, in lat. 26\u00b0 34' 30\" N., and long. 86\u00b0 9' 45\" E.; pop. (1872), 2520. Noted for its annual fair held in March or April for about 15 days, and attended by 15,000 people, chiefly from the tard\u00ed. Livestock, of the finest breeds in T\u00edrh\u00fat, and grain are the principal articles of commerce; from the Nep\u00e1l Hills are brought iron-ore, hatchets, tejp\u00e1t or bay-leaves, and musk. The fair doubtless had its origin in pilgrims coming to visit a temple of Mah\u00e1deo, which stood here; but the Kaml\u00e1 has changed its course, and washed the temple away, and now no traces of it remain.\n\nSilang.\u2014Mountain range and town in the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills District, Assam.\u2014See Shillong.\n\nSilch\u00e1r.\u2014Chief town of the District of C\u00e1char, Assam; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 49' 40\" N., and long. 92\u00b0 50' 48\" E., on the south bank of the Bar\u00e1k river. Area of municipal union, 375 square miles; pop. (1872), 3729; municipal income in 1876-77, \u00a3785; rate of taxation, 4s. per head. Silch\u00e1r is the headquarters of the civil administration, and also contains military cantonments, covering an area of 140 acres. In 1875, the 3d Bengal Native Infantry was stationed here, consisting of 7 European officers and 525 natives of all ranks. A handsome new church has been erected since the earthquake of 1869. The town is built on a neck of land formed by a bend in the river. The surface is swampy in some parts, but in others it rises into low sandy hillocks, locally called til\u00e1s. In recent years, much attention has been paid to sanitary improvements. A large trading fair or mel\u00e1 is held annually in January, lasting for about seven days. The average attendance is estimated at 20,000\npersons; the articles sold include cotton goods and ponies from Manipur. On 10th January 1869, a severe shock of earthquake was felt at Silch\u00e1r. The church and public buildings fell down, and the greater part of the b\u00e1\u015b\u00e1r was laid in ruins. The surface was rent into deep fissures, and in some parts sank down as much as from 15 to 30 feet.\n\nSilheti.\u2014Chiefship in R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces; 60 miles north-west of R\u00e1ipur town; comprising 20 villages, formerly part of Gandai chiefship. The chief is a Gond. The town of Silheti lies in lat. 21\u00b0 47' N., and long. 81\u00b0 9' E.\n\nSill\u00e1na.\u2014Native State in Central India.\u2014See SAILANA.\n\nSiller (Selere).\u2014River in Vizagapatam District, Madras. Flows east then north to Umada, where it turns west, and finally south-west, and joins the Saveri at Moat, about 20 miles north-east of the junction of the latter stream with the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. The Siller has a very tortuous course through mountainous country; total length, about 150 miles.\n\nSilp\u00e1ta.\u2014Village in Chatg\u00e1ri Dw\u00e1r, Darrang District, Assam, at which a large fair is held annually during the Bor Bihu festival, chiefly attended by the C\u00e1ch\u00e1ri population.\n\nSimga.\u2014Northern tahsil or Subdivision of R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces. Pop. (1872), 207,866, on an area of 1401 square miles; residing in 744 villages or townships and 45,296 houses.\n\nSimga.\u2014Town in R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces, on the Seo river; 28 miles north of R\u00e1ipur town, on the road to Bil\u00e1spur. Estimated pop. 1000. Simga has a town school, police post, and post office.\n\nSimh\u00e1chalam.\u2014Temple in Vizagapatam District, Madras.\u2014See SINHACHALAM.\n\nSimla.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, consisting of several detached plots of territory; situated among the hills of the lower Him\u00e1layan system. Area, 18 square miles; population in 1868, 33,995. The administrative headquarters are at Simla, the summer capital of India, in lat. 31\u00b0 6' N., and long 77\u00b0 11' E.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The mountains of Simla District and the surrounding Native States compose the southern outliers of the great central chain of the Eastern Him\u00e1layas. They descend in a gradual series from the main chain itself in Bashahr State to the general level of the Punjab plain in Umballa (Amb\u00e1la) District, thus forming a transverse south-westerly spur between the great basins of the Ganges and the Indus, here respectively represented by their tributaries the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and the Sutlej. A few miles north-east of Simla, the spur divides into two main ridges, one of which curves round the Sutlej valley toward the north-west, while the other, crowned by the sanatorium of Simla, trends south-eastward to a point a few miles north of Sub\u00e1thu, where it merges at right angles in the mountains of the Outer or Sub-Him\u00e1layan system, which run parallel to the principal range. South and east of Simla the\nhills between the Sutlej and the Tons centre in the great peak of Chor, 11,982 feet above the sea. Throughout all the hills, forests of deodar abound, while rhododendrons clothe the slopes up to the limit of perpetual snow. The scenery in the immediate neighbourhood of Simla itself presents a series of magnificent views, embracing on the south the Ambala plains, with the Sub\u00e1thu and Kasauli Hills in the foreground, and the massive block of the Chor a little to the left; while just below the spectator's feet a series of huge ravines lead down into the deep valleys which score the mountain-sides. Northwards, the eye wanders over a network of confused chains, rising range above range, and crowned in the distance by a crescent of snowy peaks, standing out in bold relief against the clear background of the sky. The principal torrents of the surrounding tracts are the Pabar, the Giri Ganga, the Gambhar, and the Sarsa.\n\nHistory.\u2014The acquisition of the patches of territory composing Simla District dates from the period of the G\u00farkha war in 1815-16. At a very early time the Hill States, together with the outer portion of Kangra District, probably formed part of the Katoch kingdom of Jalandhar (Jullundur); and, after the disruption of that principality, they continued to be governed by Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s till the beginning of the present century. After the encroachments of the G\u00farkhas led to the British invasion of their dominions in 1815, our troops remained in possession of the whole block of hill country between the Gogra and the Sutlej. Kum\u00e1un and the Dehr\u00e1 D\u00fan became a portion of British territory; a few separate localities were retained as military posts, and a portion of Keunth\u00e1l State was sold to the R\u00e1ja of Pati\u00e1la. With these exceptions, however, the whole of the conquered tract was restored to the Hill R\u00e1j\u00e1s, from whom it had been wrested by the G\u00farkhas. Garhw\u00e1l State became attached to the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, but the remaining principalities rank among the dependencies of the Punjab, and are known collectively as the Simla Hill States. From one or other of these, the plots now composing the little District of Simla have been gradually acquired. Part of the hill over which the Simla sanatorium now spreads was retained by Government in 1816, and an additional strip of land was obtained from Keunth\u00e1l in 1830. The spur known as Jutogh, 3\u00bd miles from the station, was acquired by exchange from Pati\u00e1la in 1843, as the equivalent of two villages in Barauli. Kotkhai Kotgarh, again, fell into our hands through the abdication of its R\u00e1n\u00e1, who refused to accept charge of the petty State. The Kasauli Hill originally belonged to Bija, but was relinquished in consideration of a small annual payment. Sub\u00e1thu Hill was retained from the beginning as a military fort; and the other fragments of the District have been added at various dates.\nPopulation.\u2014The results of the Census of 1868 can hardly be regarded as fairly representing the actual state of the District, for with the exception of Barauli and Kotkhai, the British territory possesses no rural population of its own. Nor do the figures show the real normal number of inhabitants on the plots which compose the District, as the Census was taken in January, one of the months when Simla and Kasauli are almost empty. Nevertheless, for the sake of uniformity, the statistics may be appended for what they are worth. The enumeration extended over an area of 18 square miles, and disclosed a total population of 53,995 persons, inhabiting 7880 houses. Persons per square mile, 1888; houses per square mile, 440; persons per house, 4\u00b731. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 21,619; females, 12,376: proportion of males, 63\u00b760 per cent. This great discrepancy between the sexes is due to the number of male immigrants connected with the sanatoria of Simla and Kasauli, who do not bring their families with them. The number of Hindus was 24,444, or 71\u00b790 per cent.; of Muhammadans, 5525, or 16\u00b725 per cent.; of Sikhs, 410, or 1\u00b720 per cent.; and of 'others,' 3616, or 10\u00b764 per cent. According to the returns of occupation, 13,351 persons were engaged in agriculture, while 20,644 belonged to the non-agricultural classes. Br\u0101hmans numbered 2011. Among these the S\u0101sani grade ranks highest in popular estimation, and supplies the R\u0101j\u00e1s and R\u0101n\u00e1s of the Hill States with priests. Others of the Br\u0101hmans engage in agriculture. The R\u0101jputs numbered in 1868, 5557; they resemble their hill brethren in K\u0101ngra. The Kanets (8969 in number) form the characteristic tribe of the Simla States, and are popularly supposed to be R\u0101jputs who have lost caste by buying wives and permitting the re-marriage of widows. All classes of the hill population are simple-minded, orderly people, truthful in character and submissive to authority, so that they scarcely require to be ruled. The chief towns (or stations) are Simla (14,848 in July 1869), Kasauli, Dagshai, Subathu, Solan, and Kalka.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The time of sowing and harvesting in the hill country depends very greatly upon the elevation. Cultivation is carried on among all the lower valleys, but even more rudely than in the similar glens of K\u0101ngra District. The fields are artificial terraces, built up against the mountain-sides, and sown with maize, pulses, or millet for the autumn, and with wheat for the spring harvest. Poppy, hemp, turmeric, ginger, and potatoes form the principal staples raised for exportation to the plains. The last-named crop, introduced under British rule, has rapidly grown in favour, and now occupies many fresh clearings on the hillsides in the neighbourhood of Simla. Land is measured, not by superficial extent, but by the quantity of seed which is required to sow it. Most of the cultivators till their own little plots, and rent is practically unknown. Throughout the hills,\nthe employment of hired labour for agricultural purposes is almost unknown, the people combining together to aid one another in special undertakings, and expecting to receive similar help in return whenever they may require it. Wages for artisans and day-labourers in 1872-73 ranged from 9d. to 1s. 6d. for skilled hands, and from 4\u00bdd. to 7\u00bdd. for coolies. Prices of food grains ruled as follows on the 1st of January 1873:\u2014Wheat, 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.; Indian corn, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.; rice, 5 sers per rupee, or 2s. 5d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce, Communications, etc.\u2014The trade of the District centres mainly in the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of Simla, which forms a considerable entrep\u00f4t for the produce of the hill tracts. R\u00e1mpur, on the Sutlej, has also some importance as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the shawl-wool (pashm) brought in by the mountaineers of Spiti and of Chinese Tartary. Part of it is worked up on the spot into coarse shawls, of the kind now made at Ludhi\u00e1na and Amritsar (Umritsur), and known as R\u00e1mpur chadars; but the greater part is bought up by merchants for exportation to British India. The hill paths are so steep that most of the wool is brought down on the backs of the sheep, which are then sheared, and laden with grain for the return journey. The R\u00e1mpur fair, on the 10th and 11th of November, attracts a large number of hillmen and of traders from the plains. The main roads of the Simla Hills are those which lead from K\u00e1lka to Simla, and from Simla towards R\u00e1mpur and Ch\u00edni. Only small portions, however, lie actually within British territory. The old road from K\u00e1lka to Simla, via Kasauli and Sub\u00e1thu, is practicable for horses, mules, ponies, or cattle, but not for wheeled conveyances. The distance by this route is 41 miles, and the journey can be performed by relays of ponies in eight hours. The new cart-road takes a more circuitous route, via Dagshai and Solan. The distance amounts to 57 miles, and two-wheeled carts traverse the whole distance in twelve hours. All the heavy traffic between Simla and the plains passes by this route. Staging bungalows have been built on all the roads at frequent intervals. A line of telegraph follows the old road, with stations at K\u00e1lka, Kasauli, and Simla.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Simla Hill States are under the superintendence of the Deputy Commissioner of Simla, subordinate to the Commissioner at Umballa (Amb\u00e1la). The total imperial revenue of the District amounted in 1872-73 to \u00a323,384, of which sum the land tax contributed \u00a315,816. The only other items of importance were stamps and excise. The number of civil and revenue judges in the same year was 6, and the number of magistrates 5. The police force numbered 201 officers and men, being at the rate of 1 man to every 1691 of the population. The Simla jail contained in 1872 a total of 118 prisoners, with a daily average of 14\u00b789. There were\n750 children receiving education in 1872-73. The educational establishments include Bishop Cotton's School, a District School, Roman Catholic Female Orphanage, Punjab Girls' School, Mayo Industrial Girls' School, and American Presbyterian Mission at Sub\u00e1thu. The only municipality is that of SIMLA.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the Simla Hills is admirably adapted to the European constitution, and the District has therefore been selected as the site of numerous sanatoria and cantonments. The mean temperature at Simla for each month of the year is as follows:\u2014January, 40\u00b0 F.; February, 44\u00b0; March, 53\u00b0; April, 61\u00b0; May, 66\u00b0; June, 80\u00b0; July, 75\u00b0; August, 78\u00b0; September, 70\u00b0; October, 67\u00b0; November, 52\u00b0; December, 46\u00b0 F. The average annual rainfall amounts to 78 inches, according to a calculation made in 1869 upon observations extending over 16 years. Cholera visited Simla, Kasauli, Sub\u00e1thu, and Dagshai in 1857, 1867, and 1872, though one or other station escaped in each visitation. In 1857, the death-rate among Europeans from cholera was 3.5 per thousand, and in 1867, 4.2 per thousand. The recorded death-rate of Simla for 1870, 1871, 1872, was 11, 8, and 8 per thousand respectively; but no trustworthy statistics exist as to native mortality. Goitre, leprosy, and stone are reported to be prevailing endemic diseases, and syphilis is said to be very common amongst the hill people. The only disease usually contracted by Europeans is that known as hill diarrhoea, a very troublesome form of the ailment. Government maintains three charitable dispensaries\u2014at Simla, Kasauli, and Dagshai. In 1872, they gave relief to a total number of 7258 persons, of whom 327 were in-patients. The Lawrence Military Asylum, established in 1852, stands upon the crest of a hill facing Kasauli, from which it is distant by road 3 miles.\n\nSimla.\u2014Tahsil of Simla District, Punjab; consisting of the two detached parganas of Simla and Barauli.\n\nSimla.\u2014Municipal town and administrative headquarters of Simla District, Punjab; chief sanatorium and summer capital of British India. Situated on a transverse spur of the Central Himalayan system, in lat. 31\u00b0 6' N., and long. 77\u00b0 11' E. Mean elevation above sea level, 7084 feet. Distant from Umballa (Ambala) 78 miles; from K\u00e1lka, at the foot of the hills, by cart-road, 57 miles. Population in January 1868, 7656; in July 1869, at the beginning of the season, 14,848, of whom 1434 were Europeans and 13,414 natives. It is probable, however, that in August and September the population considerably exceeds this number. A tract of land, including part of the hill now crowned by the station, was retained by the British Government at the close of the G\u00farkha war in 1815-16. Lieutenant Ross, Assistant-Political Agent for the Hill States, erected the first residence, a thatched wooden cottage, in 1819. Three years later, his successor,\nLieutenant Kennedy, built a permanent house. Officers from Umballa and neighbouring stations quickly followed the example, and in 1826, the new settlement had acquired a name. A year later, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General, after completing his progress through the North-West, on the conclusion of the successful Bhartpur campaign, spent the summer at Simla. From that date, the sanatorium rose rapidly into favour with the European population of Northern India. Year after year, irregularly at first, but as a matter of course after a few seasons, the seat of Government was transferred for a few weeks in every summer from the heat of Calcutta to the cool climate of the Him\u00e1layas. Successive Governors-General resorted with increasing regularity to Simla during the hot weather. Situated in the recently annexed Punjab, it formed an advantageous spot for receiving the great chiefs of Northern and Western India, numbers of whom annually come to Simla to pay their respects to the British Suzerain. It also presented greater conveniences as a starting-point for the Governor-General's cold-weather tour than Calcutta, which is situated in the extreme south-east corner of Bengal. At first only a small staff of officials accompanied the Governor-General to Simla; but since the administration of Sir John Lawrence (1864), Simla has practically been the summer capital of the Government of India, with its secretariats and headquarters establishments, unless during exceptional seasons of famine on the plains, as in 1874. Under these circumstances, the station grew with extraordinary rapidity. From 30 houses in 1830, it increased to upwards of 100 in 1841, and 290 in 1866. At present, the bungalows extend over the whole length of a considerable ridge, which runs east and west in a crescent shape, with its concave side pointing southward. The extreme ends of the station lie at a distance of 6 miles from one another. Eastward, the ridge culminates in the peak of Jako, more than 8000 feet in height, and nearly 1000 feet above the average elevation of the station. Woods of deod\u00e1r, oak, and rhododendron clothe its sides, while a tolerably level road, 5 miles long, runs round its base. Another grassy height, known as Prospect Hill, of inferior elevation to Jako, and devoid of timber, closes the western extremity of the crescent. The houses cluster thickest upon the southern slopes of Jako, and of two other hills lying near the western end. Peterhoff, the Government House, stands upon one of the latter; while the other is crowned by a large building erected for an observatory, but now used as an ordinary residence. The church stands at the western base of Jako, below which, on the south side of the hill, the native b\u00e1zd\u00edr cuts off one end of the station from the other. The eastern portion bears the name of Chota Simla, while the most easterly extremity is known as Boileauganj. An outlying northern spur, running at right angles to the main ridge, has acquired the compli-\nmentary designation of Elysium. Three and a half miles from the western end, a battery of artillery occupies the detached hill of Jutogh. The exquisite scenery of the neighbourhood has already been described in the article on SIMLA DISTRICT. The public institutions include the Bishop Cotton's School, the Punjab Girls' School, the Mayo Industrial Girls' School, a Roman Catholic convent, and a dispensary. The Government buildings comprise a District court-house and treasury, tahsili and police office, post office, telegraph station, and staging bungalow. The commerce of the town consists mainly in the supply of necessaries to the summer visitors and their dependants; but a brisk export trade exists in opium, charras (an intoxicating preparation of hemp), fruits, nuts, and shawl-wool, collected from the neighbouring hills, or brought in from beyond the border via R\u00e1mpur. Numerous European shops supply the minor wants of visitors, most of them being branches of Calcutta firms. The station has two English banks, a club, and several churches; and two European breweries are situated in the valley below. The great deficiency of Simla lies in its inadequate water supply. The springs are few in number, and several of them run dry during the summer months, when the demand is greatest. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a35281, or 7s. 6\u00bdd. per head of population (15,025) within municipal limits.\n\nSimr\u00e1on.\u2014Ruined town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated partly in Nep\u00e1l territory, the frontier line passing through the walls. The remains of the fort are in the form of a square, surrounded by an outer wall 14 miles in circumference, and by an inner one of only 10. Inside are scattered the ruins of large buildings. The Isr\u00e1 tank measures 333 yards along one side, and 210 along the other. The portions of the palaces and temples left standing disclose some finely carved basements, with a superstructure of bricks. Twenty idols have been extricated, many, however, being much mutilated. The citadel is situated to the north, and the palace in the centre of the town; but both only exist as mounds, covered with trees and jungle. Tradition says that Simr\u00e1on was founded by N\u00e1naup\u00e1 Deva in 1097 A.D. Six of his dynasty reigned with much splendour, but the last of the line, H\u00e1ri Sinh Deo, was driven out in 1322 by the Muhammadans.\n\nSimrauta.\u2014Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 in R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Haidargarh, on the east by Inhauna, on the south by R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli, and on the west by Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n and Hardoi. Area, 97 square miles, of which 44 are under cultivation; pop. (1869), 58,771, namely 56,841 Hindus and 1930 Muhammadans. Government land revenue, \u00a36335, or at the rate of 3s. 6\u00bdd. per arable acre. Of the 73 villages comprising the parg\u00e1n\u00e1, 49 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed and 24 under zamind\u00e1r\u00ed tenure. Kanhpuria Kshattriyas are the principal landed proprietors, owning 35 out of the 49 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed villages.\nSinawan.\u2014Tahsil in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab. \u2014 See SANAWAN.\n\nSinchal Pah\u00e1r.\u2014Long undulating range of hills in D\u00e1rjiling District, Bengal. A spur stretches gradually down to the T\u00edsta (Teesta), at the top of which, in lat. 26\u00b0 59' N., and long. 88\u00b0 20' 5\" E., and at a height of 8607 feet above the sea level, there are barracks for a European regiment. This hill is the loftiest mountain in the vicinity of D\u00e1rjiling station; its peaks are locally known as the Bar\u00e1 and Chhot\u00e1 Durb\u00edn. Their summits are covered with grass, and their sides are clothed with forest trees, bamboos, ferns, and scrub jungle.\n\nSinchul\u00e1.\u2014Hill range in Jalpaigur\u00ed District, Bengal; forming the boundary between British territory and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. Its average elevation is from 4000 to a little over 6000 feet, the highest peak, Ren\u00edgango (lat. 26\u00b0 47' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 37' 15\" E.), being 6222 feet above sea level. The hills run generally in long even ridges, thickly wooded from base to summit; but at places the summits bristle up into bare crags of from 200 to 300 feet. From Chhot\u00e1 Sinchul\u00e1 (5695 feet high) a magnificent view is obtained over the whole of the Bax\u00e1 Dw\u00e1r. In the distance are seen large green patches of cultivation in the midst of wide tracts of brown grass and reed jungle, the cultivated spots being dotted with homesteads; in the foreground, near the hills, are dense sal and other tree forests, the whole being intersected by numerous rivers and streams. The Sinchul\u00e1 range can nearly everywhere be ascended by men and by beasts of burden, but not by wheeled vehicles of any description.\n\nSind.\u2014A Province of British India, included within the Presidency of BOMBAY, lying between 23\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 66\u00b0 50' and 71\u00b0 E. long. Area, 56,632 square miles; population in 1872, 2,333,527 souls, including in both cases the Khairpur Native State. The Province of Sind consists of the lower valley and delta of the Indus. It is bounded on the north by Baluchist\u00e1n or the territories of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t, the Punjab Province, and Bah\u00e1walpur State; on the east by the Native States of J\u00e1salm\u00edr and Jodhpur in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; on the south by the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh) and the Indian Ocean; and on the west by the territories of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t. The administrative headquarters are at the city of KARACHI (Kurrachee), but the ancient capital of HAIDARABAD still ranks high amongst the towns of the Province. Sind is divided into the five Districts of KARACHI, HAI DARABAD, THAR AND PARKAR, SHIKARPUR, and UPPER SIND FRONTIER, all of which see separately. I take this opportunity of again acknowledging my obligations, already mentioned in the preface to Volume I., to the Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, by Mr. A. W. Hughes, of the Bombay Uncovenanted Civil Service. The following account of Sind, and the articles on places within that\nProvince, are mainly condensed from Mr. Hughes' excellent and elaborate work:\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Almost every portion of the great alluvial tract of Sind has at some time or other formed a channel for the river Indus itself, or one of its many branches. The main central stream of North-Western India, after collecting into its bed the waters of the five Punjab rivers, has deposited near its debouchure into the Indian Ocean a vast mass of deltaic matter, through which it flows by several shifting channels to join the sea on the southern border of the Province. In every direction, traces of ancient river beds may be discovered crossing the country like elevated dikes; for the level of the land, as in all other deltaic regions, is highest at the river bank. The Indus brings down from the turbid hill torrents a greater quantity of detritus than can be carried forward by its diminished velocity in the plain, and hence a constant accumulation of silt takes place along its various beds, raising their level above that of the surrounding country, and incidentally affording an easy opportunity of irrigation by side channels drawn from the central river.\n\nThe only elevations deserving the name of mountains occur in the Kirthar range, which separate Sind from Baluchist\u00e1n, and attain in places a height of more than 7000 feet above sea level. They first touch the Sind frontier about the 28th parallel of north latitude, and form the British boundary for 120 miles. Thenceforward, they sink considerably in altitude, forming the lesser chain of the Pab Hills, which after a length of 90 miles in a southerly direction terminate on the sea-coast in the promontory of Cape Monze. Their average elevation does not rise above 2000 feet. Among the valleys and ravines of the Pab range flows the river Hab, the only permanent stream in Sind, except the Indus and its tributaries. The wild and rocky tract of Kohistan, in the western portion of Karachi District, forms almost the only remaining exception to the general flatness of the Province. Another offshoot of the Kirthar chain, however, known as the Lakki range, extends in a barren mass eastward into the Sehw\u00e1n Subdivision, and presents evident marks of volcanic origin in its frequent hot springs and sulphurous exhalations. A few insignificant limestone ranges intersect the Indus valley, on one of which, known as the Ganjo Hills, with an elevation of only 100 feet, stands the T\u00e1lpur capital of Haidarabad. A second small chain, running in a north-westerly direction from the neighbourhood of J\u00e1isalm\u00edr, attains towards the Indus a height of 150 feet, and forms the rocks on which are perched the town of Rohri and the island fortress of Bukkur (Bakhar).\n\nThe plain country comprises a mixed tract of dry desert and alluvial plain. The finest and most productive region lies in the neighbourhood of Shik\u00e1rpur and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, where a long narrow island extends for\n100 miles from north to south, enclosed on one side by the river Indus, and on the other by the Western N\u00e1ra. Another great alluvial tract, with an average width of 70 or 80 miles, stretches eastward from the Indus to the Eastern N\u00e1ra. The Indus appears at one time to have spread its fertilizing waters through the wide waste at present known as the Eastern Desert, in the District of Thar and P\u00e1rkar. Vestiges of ancient towns still stud the treeless expanse, and dry water-courses intersect it in every part. Sandhills abound near the eastern border, shifting under the influence of each prevailing wind. Large tracts rendered sterile for want of irrigation also occur in many other parts of Sind. Amongst them the most noticeable is the Pat, or desert of Shik\u00e1rpur, stretching for 30 miles from that town to the foot of the Bol\u00e1n Pass, and formed of the clay deposited by the Bol\u00e1n, the N\u00e1ri, and other mountain torrents of the Kirthar range.\n\nThe scenery of Sind naturally lacks variety or grandeur, and its monotony renders it tame and uninteresting. Nothing can be more dreary to a stranger approaching the shore than the low and flat coast, entirely devoid of trees and shrubs. Even among the hills of Kohist\u00e1n, where fine rocky scenery abounds, the charm of foliage is almost totally wanting, owing to the volcanic nature of the rock. In the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, in the eastern portions of Khairpur State, and in the Subdivision of Rohri, the regist\u00e1n or desert tract consists of nothing but sandhills, many of which, however, derive picturesqueness from their bold outline, and are sometimes even fairly wooded. The various ranges of sandhills succeed one another like vast waves. Lakes are rare, the largest being the Manchhar in the Sehw\u00e1n Subdivision, formed by an expansion of the Western N\u00e1ra. During the inundation season, it measures 20 miles in length, and covers an area of about 180 square miles. At the same period, the flood-hollows (dandhs) of the Eastern N\u00e1ra form pretty lakelets; but in spite of their great beauty they are seldom visited, as the miasma renders them dangerous places in which to encamp. The alluvial strip which borders either bank of the Indus for a distance of 12 miles, though superior to every other part of Sind in soil and productiveness, can lay no claim to picturesque beauty. Even here, however, extensive forests of acacia (b\u00e1bul) in many places skirt the reaches of the Indus for miles together. Near the town of Sehw\u00e1n, the Lakhi range forms an abrupt escarpment toward the river in a perpendicular face of rock 600 feet high. But the finest views in the Province are those which embrace the towns of Sukkur and Rohri, and the island fortress of Bukkur, with its lofty castellated walls, lying in the river between them. All three crown the range of limestone hills through which the Indus has here cut its way, and the minarets and houses, especially in Rohri, overhang the stream from a towering height above. A little to the south of Bukkur, again, lies the\ngreen island of S\u00e1dh Bela with its sacred shrine, while groves of date-palm and acacia stud the banks of the Indus on either side.\n\nThe soil of Sind consists of a plastic clay, strongly impregnated with salt. When covered by the floods (l\u00fats) of the Indus, either through artificial irrigation or through spontaneous change of channel, it quickly assumes the appearance of a rich lowland; and it changes its aspect as quickly to that of an arid desert when the water is once more diverted elsewhere. The land is thus fertile enough in the immediate neighbourhood of the existing river branches to yield two or more crops in the year without manuring. Nevertheless, the soil contains a large admixture of saltpetre; and in Southern Sind, where sand greatly prevails, it is so impregnated with common salt as to produce it in abundance by evaporation, after simply pouring water through its surface. The extent of forest land is small for a Province of so large an area, only about 500 square miles being covered with woodland, not including those in Khairpur State. The Forest Department has charge of about 87 separate forests, chiefly situated along the bank of the Indus, extending southward from Ghotki to the middle delta. They run in narrow strips, from a quarter of a mile to 2 miles in breadth, and about 3 miles in length. Many of them suffer greatly at times from the encroachments of the stream. The floods of 1863 swept away 1000 acres of the Dh\u00e1rej\u00e1 forest in Shik\u00e1rpur District, and a similar misfortune occurred to the forests of Sundarbelo and S\u00e1mtia in the two succeeding years. The indigenous trees consist chiefly of b\u00e1bul (Acacia arabica), bahan (Populus euphratica), and kandi (Prosopis spicigera). The b\u00e1bul, the staple tree of Lower Sind, produces good timber for boat-building and fuel; while its seed-pods supply a food for fattening cattle, its bark is employed for tanning, and its leaves form a favourite fodder of camels and goats. The bahan, the commonest tree of Upper Sind, yields a light tough wood for building purposes, from which also are manufactured the celebrated lacquered boxes of H\u00e1la and Kh\u00e1not. The t\u00e1l\u00ed (Dalbergia sissu) grows to some extent in Upper Sind, though it cannot be considered as indigenous to the Province. The delta of the Indus contains no forests, but its shores and inlets abound with low thickets of mangrove trees, whose timber makes a good fuel. The Forest Department has lately introduced several valuable exotics, including the tamarind, the water-chestnut, and the tallow-tree. The revenue from this source has largely increased during the last two decades, and considerable quantities of firewood are now exported to Bombay by way of Ketibandar. The date-palm ripens its fruit in Sind, while the country also produces excellent apples, being to some extent intermediate in its flora between Hindust\u00e1n and Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n. One-third of the indigenous vegetation is Arabian or Egyptian. The native fauna includes the tiger, found occasionally in\nthe jungles of Upper Sind, the hy\u00e6na, the g\u00fcrkhar or wild ass, the wolf, fox, wild boar, antelope, and hog-deer, as well as the vulture and several falcons. The flamingo, pelican, stork, crane, and Egyptian ibis frequent the shores of the delta. Bustard, rock-grouse, quail, and partridge occur among the game-birds; while flocks of wild geese, kulang, ducks, teal, and curlew cover the lakes and dandhs during the cold season. Venomous snakes abound, and yearly cause a large number of deaths. The river fisheries of the Indus and its offshoots not only supply the Province with fresh fish, but afford a considerable export trade in dried pila. Among domestic animals, the camel, of the one-humped variety, ranks first as a beast of burden, immense numbers being bred in the salt marshes of the Indus. Great herds of buffaloes graze on the swampy tracts of the delta, and gh\u00ee, made from their milk, forms an important item of export trade. Sheep and goats abound in Upper Sind, on the borders of the Pat in Shik\u00e1rpur District, and in Thar and P\u00e1rkar. The horses, though small, are active, hardy, and capable of enduring great fatigue. The Baluchis of Upper Sind pay much attention to the breeding of mares. The bullocks are small in size, and chiefly used for draught or for turning irrigation wheels.\n\nThe extreme south-eastern border of Sind is formed by the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh), an immense salt-water waste, with an area of about 7000 square miles. It bounds the District of Thar and P\u00e1rkar for a distance of nearly 40 miles. Every part of it is devoid of herbage, and a large portion is annually converted into a salt lake from June to November, owing to the influx of the sea at Lakhpat Bandar on the Kori mouth of the Indus, as well as at other places in Cutch (Kachchh) and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. During the remaining six months of the year, after the evaporation of the water, the surface becomes incrusted with salt, while herds of antelopes and wild asses roam over the desert expanse. According to local tradition, a well-tilled plain, irrigated by a branch of the Indus, once covered this portion of the Rann; but either the hand of man or an earthquake diverted the waters, and the tract has ever since remained a waste of salt. The upper part of the Kori mouth still bears the name of the Pur\u00e1na or ancient stream, and there is little doubt that the Indus once took a more easterly course than at present, and so rendered some portion of the Rann a fertile lowland. The whole sea-coast of Sind, except the part between Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) and Cape Monze where the Pab Hills approach the shore, is low and flat, and submerged at spring-tides. It consists, in fact, of a series of mud-banks deposited by the Indus, or in a few places of sandhills blown from seaward. The sea near the shore is very shallow, owing to the quantity of mud deposited by the river. A bank extends along the coast from Kar\u00e1chi to Cutch, about 2 miles from the land, and 3 miles in width, generally dry at low\nwater. This circumstance renders the approach to the shore extremely dangerous for large vessels.\n\n**History.**\u2014Sind owes its name as well as its existence to the river Indus or Sindhu, a Sanskrit term signifying water; though Muhammadan scholars prefer to derive the word from an eponymic patriarch Sind, the brother of Hind, and son of Nuh or Noah, whose descendants ruled over the country for many generations. Previous to the Arab invasion in 713 A.D., a Hindu dynasty appears to have reigned at Aror, near the present town of Rohri; and their capital, on the bank of the Indus, possessed many fine buildings, with extensive pleasure-gardens. The dominions of the native dynasty stretched, according to local tradition, from Kashmir and Kanauj to Om\u00e1n and Surat, besides including the Afgh\u00e1n territories of Kandah\u00e1r and the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills. The names of five kings belonging to this earliest line have been preserved to us, and their reigns are said to have extended over an aggregate of 137 years. A Br\u00e1hman chamberlain to the last of them, by name Chachh, established himself on the throne after his master's death, and left the kingdom to two of his family in succession. But during the reign of his son Dahir, a few peaceful Muhammadan merchants, as the Arab version of the conquest asserts, who had been sent into Sind by the Kh\u00e1lifa Abdul M\u00e1lik to purchase female slaves and other articles of lawful commerce, were attacked by robbers, and either made prisoners or killed on the spot. One or two of the injured merchants alone escaped to make their complaints to the Kh\u00e1lifa; and the latter readily embraced so excellent an opportunity of spreading the faith of Isl\u00e1m into the delta of the Indus. He died before the army collected for the purpose could invade Sind; but his son despatched Muhammad K\u00e1sim Sak\u00edfi to carry out the conquest in or about 712 A.D. Muhammad K\u00e1sim set out from Shir\u00e1z with a large force, and first captured the seaport of Debal, identified with Manora or Tatta. Thence he marched upon Nerankot, the modern Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d; and after its capitulation he next took the strong fortress of Sehw\u00e1n. Returning to Nerankot, the Musalm\u00e1n leader proceeded to cross the Indus, whose main channel then flowed east of the city, and successfully engaged the army of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dahir. The native prince was slain at the fort of R\u00e1war, while his family were carried away prisoners by the conqueror. In 713, Muhammad K\u00e1sim arrived at the capital, Alor, which was taken; and then advanced upon Multan (in the present Punjab Province), which submitted with an immense treasure. The end of the first great Musalm\u00e1n conqueror of India remains uncertain; but it seems probable that he was tortured to death with the sanction of Kh\u00e1lifa Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n. Sind remained thenceforward, with scarcely a break, in the hands of the Muhammadans. On the extinction of the Ummayide dynasty of Kh\u00e1lifas (750 A.D.), and the accession of the Ab\u00e1ssides, the Indus delta\npassed to the new rulers, and the power of the Musalm\u00e1ns began to attract the attention of the native princes on the northern frontier of Hindust\u00e1n. But the hold of the Kh\u00e1l\u00edfas upon this distant Province grew slowly weaker, and became virtually extinct in 871 A.D. Two native kingdoms raised themselves at M\u00falt\u00e1n and M\u00e1nsura. The former comprised the upper valley of the united Indus as far as Alor; the latter extended from that town to the sea, and nearly coincided with the modern Province of Sind. The country was then well cultivated, and Alor, the capital, is said to have almost equalled M\u00falt\u00e1n in size, and to have possessed a considerable commerce. The Arab princes apparently derived but a very small revenue from Sind, and left the administration wholly in the hands of natives. Arab soldiers held lands on military tenure, and liberal grants provided for the sacred buildings and institutions of Isl\u00e1m. Commerce was carried on by caravans with Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n and Z\u00e1bulist\u00e1n, and by sea with China, Ceylon, and Malabar. The Arabs also permitted the native Sindians the free exercise of their own religion to a considerable extent.\n\nWhen Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed invaded India in 1019, Sind was ruled by a Governor who nominally represented the Kh\u00e1lifa, K\u00e1dir Billah Ab\u00fal Abbas Ahmad. After the capture of M\u00falt\u00e1n and Uchh, Mahm\u00fad sent his Waz\u00edr, Abd\u00far Raz\u00e1i, to conquer Sind, which the Waz\u00edr accomplished in 1026. But six years later, Ibn S\u00famar, Governor of M\u00falt\u00e1n, laid the foundation of the S\u00famra dynasty in Sind, at first apparently as a titular vassal of the Ghaznevide monarchy. In 1051, however, if not before, the S\u00famra kings made themselves completely independent, and extended their possessions as far as Nasarpur. Under Khaf\u00edf, who made Tatta his capital, the dynasty attained its greatest power, and restrained with success the wild tribes of the western frontier. From the death of Khaf\u00edf, however, the S\u00e1mr\u00e1 dynasty lost its prestige; and in the reign of Urrah Mehl (1351), the Sama tribe, a body of non-Musalm\u00e1n immigrants from Cutch (Kachchh), conspired against and killed the Musalm\u00e1n king, and placed J\u00e1m Unar, one of themselves, upon the throne of Sind. The Samas were either Buddhists or Hindus, and had their capital city at Samanagar on the Indus, identified with the modern town of Sehw\u00e1n; but they resided chiefly at Tatta or at Samui, under the Makli Hills, 3 miles north-west of the former town. They were undoubtedly R\u00e1jputs of the Yadava stock, and they became Muhammadans not earlier than 1391 A.D. J\u00e1m Unar, first of the line, reigned three and a half years, but does not seem to have held all Sind under his sway, as the H\u00e1kim kept Bukkur and its neighbourhood on behalf of the king of the Turks. Junah, the second king, captured Bukkur, and the H\u00e1kim retreated to Uchh. Under his successor, the forces of the King of Delhi retook Bukkur, and carried the J\u00e1m and his family as prisoners to Delhi. In 1372, Firoz Tughlak invaded Sind, and com-\npelled the ruling prince to tender a nominal allegiance. The Sama line consisted in all of 15 kings, the last of whom was supplanted by the Argh\u00fans.\n\nThe Argh\u00fan dynasty traced its origin to Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, and commenced its rule in Sind in 1521. The first prince of the line, Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan, marching down from Kandah\u00e1r, defeated the Sama army in 1520, and sacked Tatta, the capital of J\u00e1m Firoz Sama. By a subsequent agreement, the J\u00e1m retained all Sind between Sukkur and Tatta, while the Sh\u00e1h took the region north of Lakhi. But the Samas soon after repudiated this agreement, and a battle fought at Talti, near Sehw\u00e1n, resulted in their utter defeat and the secure establishment of the Argh\u00fan power. Sh\u00e1h Beg afterwards captured the fort of Bukkur, and rebuilt the fortifications with bricks taken from the ancient stronghold of Alor. Just before his death in 1522, he made preparations to attack Gujr\u00e1t, but did not live to accomplish his purpose. Sh\u00e1h Beg was not only a bold soldier, but also a learned Musalm\u00e1n theologian and commentator. His son and successor, M\u00edrza Sh\u00e1h Hus\u00e1in, finally drove J\u00e1m Firoz from Tatta to Cutch, and at length to Gujr\u00e1t, where the Sama prince died. Sh\u00e1h Hus\u00e1in severely punished his subject tribes for internal wars, and sacked the towns of M\u00falt\u00e1n and Uchh, as well as the fort of Dil\u00e1war. During his reign, the Mughal Emperor Hum\u00e1yun, being defeated by the Afgh\u00e1n, Sher Sh\u00e1h, in 1539 A.D., fled to Sind, where he endeavoured unsuccessfully to take the fort of Bukkur. After a short stay in Jodhpur, Hum\u00e1yun returned to Sind by way of Um\u00e1rkot in 1542, and again attempted without success to conquer the country. Sh\u00e1h Hus\u00e1in died childless in 1554, after a reign of thirty-four years, and with him ended the Argh\u00fan dynasty. A short-lived line, the Tarkh\u00e1n, succeeded for a few years; but in 1592, the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who was himself born at Um\u00e1rkot during the flight of his father Hum\u00e1yun, defeated M\u00edrz\u00e1 J\u00e1ni Beg, ruler of Tatta, and united Sind for the first time with the Musalm\u00e1n Empire of Delhi. The Province was incorporated under Akbar's organization in the Subah of M\u00falt\u00e1n.\n\nDuring the flourishing period of the Mughal Empire, the general peace of the great monarchy extended to Sind, and but few historical events of importance occurred for the next century. In the interval, however, between the consolidation of the empire by Akbar, and the dismemberment which followed on the invasion of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, the D\u00e1\u00fadputras or sons of D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, rose to distinction. Weavers and warriors by profession, they led a wild and wandering life, at Kh\u00e1npur, Tar\u00e1i, and the Sukkur District. After a long and sanguinary conflict with the Mahars, a race of Hindu origin, the D\u00e1\u00fadputras succeeded in establishing their supremacy over Upper Sind, and founded the town of Shik\u00e1rpur. From the extinction of the native dynasties, Tatta had\nformed a scene of constant contention between neighbouring governors, till Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr put a stop to the strife by appointing removable lieutenants to administer the outlying Provinces of the empire, and so checked the growth of a hereditary viceroyalty in Sind. Towards the end of the 17th century, however, another race, closely allied to the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, rose to power in the lower Indus valley. The Kalhoras traced their descent historically to Muhammad of Kamb\u00e1th\u00e1 (1204 A.D.), and more mythically to Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet. About 1558, the family rose into notice through the sanctity of one Adam Sh\u00e1h, the chief of a large sect of mendicants in Ch\u00e1nduka. The Governor of M\u00falt\u00e1n attacked the religious leader, dispersed his followers, and put to death Adam Sh\u00e1h himself. The Fak\u00edrs descended from the family long lived a life of warfare against the Mughal lieutenants; until at length in 1658, under N\u00e1z\u00edr Muhammad Kalhora, they began successfully to oppose the imperial troops and to organize themselves into a regular government. At length, about 1701, Y\u00e1r Muhammad Kalhora, assisted by the Sirai or T\u00e1lpur tribe, seized upon Shik\u00e1rpur, where he fixed his court, and obtained from the Emperor a grant of the Der\u00e1j\u00e1t, together with a regular title under the imperial system. By the year 1711, Y\u00e1r Muhammad had further overrun the Kandi\u00e1ro and L\u00e1rk\u00e1h\u00e1na tracts, as well as the country around Sukkur. On his death in 1719, his son N\u00far Muhammad succeeded to his territories, and conquered the Nh\u00e1r Subdivision from the D\u00e1\u00fadputras. Sehw\u00e1n and its dependencies also fell under his rule, and his territory extended from the M\u00falt\u00e1n border to Tatta. The fort of Bukkur, however, did not come into the possession of the Kalhoras till 1736. With this exception, N\u00far Muhammad's authority stretched from the desert to the Baluchi Mountains. During his reign, the T\u00e1lpur tribe of Baluch\u00eds, the last native rulers of Sind, first came into notice in the person of M\u00edr Bahr\u00e1m, an able officer of the Kalhora kings. When N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, the Persian conqueror, swooped upon Delhi in February 1739, and broke down the decaying Mughal organization, all the Provinces west of the Indus were detached from the Empire and incorporated with the Persian dominions. Tatta and Shik\u00e1rpur formed part of the territory thus ceded to N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h. Shortly after his return to K\u00e1b\u00fal, N\u00e1dir set out upon a second expedition against Sind and the Punjab, in order to repress his troublesome vassal, N\u00far Muhammad. Two years earlier, the Kalhora prince had persuaded S\u00e1d\u00edk Al\u00ed, Subahd\u00e1r of Tatta, to make over that Province in return for a sum of 3 l\u00e1khs; and this transaction apparently aroused the anger of his new suzerain. On N\u00e1dir's approach, N\u00far Muhammad at first fled to Umarkot, but afterwards surrendered with the loss of Shik\u00e1rpur and Sibi, which the Sh\u00e1h made over to the D\u00e1\u00fadputras and Afgh\u00e1ns. An annual tribute of 20 l\u00e1khs, with the honorary compensation of a high-sounding title, was imposed upon the\nKalhora prince. On N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h\u2019s death, Sind became tributary in 1748 to Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed of Kandah\u00e1r, who conferred on N\u00far Muhammad the new title of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n. In 1754, the tribute being in arrears, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h advanced against Sind, and N\u00far Muhammad fled to J\u00e1salm\u00edr, where he died. His son, Muhammad Mur\u00e1d Y\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, managed to appease the ruler of Kandah\u00e1r, and obtained a confirmation of his rank and power. He founded the town of Mur\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1757, his subjects rose against his oppressive government and dethroned him, placing his brother, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, upon the throne. The new prince, after two years of internal dissension, made his own position secure; and in 1762, he invaded Cutch (Kachchh), fighting the sanguinary battle of Jhana. Next year, he resumed operations against Cutch, and took the seaports of Basta and Lakhpat on the Indus. In 1768, he founded the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d on the ancient site of Nerankot, and made it his capital till his death in 1772. During the early part of his reign, in 1758, the East India Company established a factory at Tatta. Sarfar\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, his son and successor, discouraged the Company\u2019s operations, and the factory was eventually withdrawn in 1775. Soon after, the Baluch\u00eds deposed the chief, and two years of anarchy followed. In 1777, Ghul\u00e1m Nabi Kh\u00e1n, a brother of Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, succeeded in obtaining the throne. During his reign, M\u00edr Bijar, a T\u00e1lpur chief, rose in rebellion; and in the battle between them the Kalhora prince lost his life. Abdul Nabi Kh\u00e1n, his brother, succeeded to the throne, and put all his relatives to death as a precautionary measure. He then made a compromise with M\u00edr Bijar, retaining the sovereignty for himself, but appointing the T\u00e1lpur chief as his minister. In 1781, an army from Kandah\u00e1r invaded Sind, where the tribute remained always in a chronic state of arrears, but M\u00edr Bijar defeated it near Shik\u00e1rpur. Thereupon, Abdul Nabi Kh\u00e1n assassinated his too successful general. Abdulla Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lpur, son of the murdered minister, at once seized upon the government, and the last of the Kalhoras fled to Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t. Thence he made many unsuccessful efforts to regain his kingdom, and at last re-established himself for a while by the aid of Kandah\u00e1r. But on his putting to death Abdulla Kh\u00e1n, M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed, a kinsman of the murdered T\u00e1lpur, once more expelled him. The Kalhora king made a final effort to recover his throne; but being defeated by M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed, he fled to Jodhpur, where his descendants still hold distinguished rank. With him ended the dynasty of the Kalhoras.\n\nIn 1783, M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, first of the T\u00e1lpur line, established himself as Rais of Sind. He obtained a firm\u00e1n from Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n of Kandah\u00e1r for the government of Sind by the T\u00e1lpurs. The history of Sind under its new dynasty\u2014generally spoken of as the T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs\u2014is rendered very complicated by the numerous branches into which the ruling house split up. Fateh Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n\u2019s nephew, M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n,\nsettled with his adherents at Rohri; while his son, M\u00edr Tharo Kh\u00e1n, removed to Sh\u00e1hbandar; and each of them occupied the adjacent country as an independent ruler, throwing off all allegiance to the head of their house at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The T\u00e1lpurs thus fell into three distinct branches\u2014the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d or Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur family, ruling in Central Sind; the M\u00edrpur or Manik\u00e1n\u00ed house, descendants of M\u00edr Tharo, ruling at M\u00edrpur; and the Sohr\u00e1bani line, derived from M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b, ruling at Khaipur. Further to increase the complication, Fateh Al\u00ed, head of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d M\u00edrs, associated with himself in the government his three younger brothers, Ghul\u00e1m Al\u00ed, Karam Al\u00ed, and Mur\u00e1d Al\u00ed. He then turned his attention to the recovery of Kar\u00e1chi and Umarkot. The former, alienated to the Governor of Khel\u00e1t, he recovered in 1792; the latter, held by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jodhpur, the M\u00edrs regained in 1813. In 1801, M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed died, leaving one son, Sobhd\u00e1r, and bequeathing his dominions to his three brothers. Of these, Ghul\u00e1m Al\u00ed died in 1811, and left a son, M\u00edr Muhammad; but the two surviving brothers retained the chief power in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Kuram Al\u00ed died without issue in 1828; but Mur\u00e1d Ali left two sons, N\u00far Muhammad and Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n. Up to 1840, the government of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was carried on by these two M\u00edrs, together with their cousins Sobhd\u00e1r and Muhammad. M\u00edr N\u00far Muhammad died in 1841, leaving two sons, Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1d and Hus\u00e1in Al\u00ed. The T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs adorned Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and its suburb Khud\u00e1b\u00e1d with many handsome buildings, of which their own tombs are the most remarkable.\n\nThe first connection of the British with Sind took place as early as 1758, in the matter of the abandoned factory at Tatta. In 1799, a commercial mission was sent to Sind, to conduct business between our Government and the T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs, but it ended unsatisfactorily. The agent resided from time to time at Tatta, Sh\u00e1hbandar, or Kar\u00e1chi, and endured numerous indignities, until at length he received a peremptory order from the M\u00edrs to quit their territory. The East India Company took no notice of this insult. In 1809, an arrangement was effected between the M\u00edrs and our authorities, mainly for the purpose of excluding Frenchmen from settling in Sind. In 1825, the Sindi tribe of Khosas made incursions into Cutch, and a military demonstration became necessary as a preventive measure. In 1830, Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Alexander) Burnes, after many delays and threats on the part of the M\u00edrs, was permitted to follow up the course of the Indus, taking with him presents from the King of England to Ranj\u00edt Sinh at Lahore. The river was then entirely unexplored, and the obvious object of the mission was the collection of information for political purposes. Two years later, Colonel Pottinger concluded a treaty with the M\u00edrs for the advancement of commerce, by which traders and merchants were permitted to use the roads and rivers of Sind, though\nno Englishman might settle in the country. The Khairpur M\u00edrs ratified this treaty, after their kinsmen at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1835, Colonel Pottinger obtained leave to survey the sea-coast of Sind and the delta of the Indus; yet trade did not enter the river, and the M\u00edrs clearly mistrusted the intentions of their powerful neighbours. In 1838, the first Afgh\u00e1n war necessitated the despatch of British troops to join the main army by way of the Indus, in spite of a clause in the treaty expressly forbidding the employment of the river as a military highway. Lord Auckland considered that so great an emergency overrode the text of the agreement, and declared that those chiefs who showed themselves unwilling to assist us in such a crisis would be deprived of their possessions. In December of that year, a large force under Sir John Keane landed in Sind, but found itself unable to proceed, owing to the obstacles thrown in its way by the M\u00edrs in supplying stores and carriage. After a threat to march upon Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sir John Keane at length succeeded in continuing his course. Owing to this hostile demeanour, a reserve force was despatched from Bombay in 1839, to take up its station in Sind. The Baluch\u00ed garrison at Manora, near Kar\u00e1chi, endeavoured to prevent it from landing, and the British accordingly found it necessary to occupy that fort. A treaty was afterwards concluded with the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d M\u00edrs, by which they agreed to pay 23 l\u00e1khs to Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja, in commutation of all arrears of tribute due to the Afgh\u00e1ns; to admit the establishment in Sind of a British force not exceeding 5000 men, the expenses being defrayed in part by the M\u00edrs themselves; and finally, to abolish all tolls upon trading boats on the Indus. The Khairpur M\u00edrs concluded a similar treaty, except as regards the subsidy. The English then took possession of the fort of Bukkur, under the terms of the engagement. By careful conciliatory measures, the British representatives secured the tranquillity of the country, so that the steam flotilla navigated the Indus unimpeded. N\u00far Muhammad, senior M\u00edr, died in 1841, and the T\u00e1lpur Government passed to his two sons, conjointly with their uncle, Nasfr Kh\u00e1n. In 1842, Sir Charles Napier arrived in Sind, with sole authority over all the territory on the Lower Indus. New conditions were proposed to the M\u00edrs, owing to delay in payment of the tribute, these terms including the cession of Kar\u00e1chi, Tatta, Sukkur, Bukkur, and Rohri. After some delay and a slight military demonstration, the treaty was signed in February 1843. But the Baluch\u00eds composing the Sindian army did not acquiesce in this surrender of independence; and shortly afterwards they attacked the Residency, which stood near the Indus, a few miles from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Major Outram and his small suite, after defending the building for a short time, found themselves compelled to retreat to a steamer then lying in the river. He soon after joined Sir C. Napier's force. On the 17th of February, Napier found the M\u00edrs' army 22,000\nstrong, posted on the Fuleli river, near Meeanee (Mi\u00e1ni). He gave them battle with only 2800 men of all arms, and 12 pieces of artillery, and gained a complete and brilliant victory. The Baluch\u00ed loss amounted to about 5000 men, while that of the British did not exceed 257, of whom 19 were officers. Shortly after, the chief Mirs of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Khairpur surrendered as prisoners of war, and the fort of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was captured, together with the Mirs' treasure, computed at about \u00a31,000,000 sterling.\n\nIn March, Napier received reinforcements from Sukkur, and went in search of the enemy, with 5000 men. He found the Baluch\u00ed army, 20,000 strong, under Sher Muhammad of Mirpur, in a strong position near Dabo. After a desperate resistance, the Sindians fled in disorder, their leader, Sher Muhammad, retreating to the desert. Soon afterwards, our troops occupied Mirpur and Umarkot. Sind was declared a conquered country, and annexed to the British dominions. The T\u00e1lpur family thus ceased to be a ruling power, after a sovereignty of fifty-three years. The Mirs were removed successively to Bombay, Poona, and Calcutta; but in 1854, Lord Dalhousie allowed them to return to Sind and take up their residence at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Under the T\u00e1lpurs, the government of Sind consisted of a rude military feudalism. The Mirs themselves had little education or refinement, and lived in primitive Baluchi simplicity, their extravagant propensities being shown in their fondness for horses, arms, and field sports. Their sole aim was to hoard up wealth, oppose all improvements, and enjoy themselves after their own fashion.\n\nImmediately after the annexation, Sir C. Napier was appointed the first British Governor; while a pension of 3\u00bd l\u0101khs, together with lands in j\u0101g\u012br, was distributed amongst the deposed Mirs. The judicial and revenue systems underwent a speedy remodelling; and the Province was divided into extensive collectorates. Since the British annexation, the chief events in Sind have consisted of great commercial improvements, including especially the immense harbour works at Kar\u00e1chi, which have rendered the modern capital one of the most important seaports of Western India. Under the Commissionership of Sir Bartle Frere (1851-59), the Province took most important steps in the direction of mercantile progress; and at a later date, the construction of the Indus Valley Railway, from Kar\u00e1chi to join the Punjab line at M\u00falt\u00e1n, has already contributed greatly to the prosperity of the country.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Sind is a very sparsely populated Province even at the present day. We possess no statistics as to the number of inhabitants under its native rulers, though a probable conjecture sets it down in the early part of this century at not more than 1,000,000 persons, or only about 16 to the square mile. A Census taken in 1856, exclusive of the territory of Mfr Ali Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, returned the total population at 1,772,367 persons. An accurate enumeration undertaken in 1872\ngave the total, again excluding Khairpur territory, at 2,203,177; thus showing a gain of 430,810 persons, or 26 per cent., in the fifteen years. The Census of 1872 extended over an area of 56,632 square miles, including Khairpur; and it disclosed a total population of 2,333,527 persons, or 41 to the square mile. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 1,293,746; females, 1,039,781: proportion of males, 55\u00b78 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 481,701; females, 378,289; total children, 859,990, or 38\u00b72 per cent.: above 12 years\u2014males, 742,553; females, 600,634; total adults, 1,343,187, or 61\u00b78 per cent. The population, which is extremely scattered in all parts of the country, gathers thickest in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, which has an average of 78 persons to the square mile. In Shik\u00e1rpur, the average falls to 76, and in the Frontier District of Upper Sind to 43. The extensive District of Kar\u00e1chi, though it contains the capital town and largest commercial centre, has but 26 persons to the square mile; in Khairpur State, the average is only 21; and in the wide but desert expanse of the Thar and P\u00e1rk\u00e1r, it does not exceed 14. The religious and ethnical division of the people yields the following results:\u2014Muhammadans, 1,716,655, or 77\u00b793 per cent.; Hind\u00fas, 393,092, or 17\u00b784 per cent.; S\u00edkh\u00eds, 23,899, or 1\u00b708 per cent.; Europeans, 2638, or 0\u00b712 per cent.; Eurasians, 464, or 0\u00b702 per cent.; Indo-Portuguese, 1150, or 0\u00b705 per cent.; other non-Asiatics, 2057, or 0\u00b709 per cent.; native Christians, 371, or 0\u00b702 per cent.; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 810, or 0\u00b704 per cent.; and \u2018others,\u2019 62,041, or 2\u00b781 per cent. The Muhammadans, who form the bulk of the inhabitants, fall naturally into two classes\u2014the native Sind\u00eds, and the naturalized tribes, such as Sayyids, Afgh\u00e1ns, Baluch\u00eds, Africans, and Khw\u00e1jas. The Sind\u00eds represent the original Hindu population, converted to Isl\u00e1m under the Ummayide Kh\u00e1l\u00edf\u00e1s. They are taller and more robust than the natives of Bengal, of dark complexion, and muscular frame. Their detractors represent them as idle, apathetic and cowardly, addicted to drunkenness, and personally dirty; while their disinclination to truthfulness has given them a bad name amongst neighbouring tribes. On the other hand, they are quiet and inoffensive, kindly, faithful, and of unimpeachable honesty. In religion, they are Sunnis. The Sind\u00eds are subdivided into about 300 clans or tribes, but the caste system does not exist among them. The Sind\u00ed language belongs to the pure Neo-Sanskritic group, and contains far less of alien admixture than any of the cognate tongues. It stands closer to the old Pr\u00e1krit than does the Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Hind\u00ed, or Bengali; and it has preserved an immense number of grammatical forms which have dropped out of the other vernaculars. Three dialects of the Sind\u00ed are distinguished in Upper and Lower Sind and in the Thar, respectively. The literature of the Sind\u00ed language consists mainly of translations from\nthe Arabic, chiefly theological, and of a few rude national ballads. Among the races of foreign origin, the Sayyids were patronized by the Kalhora princes, who granted them several considerable estates; but the T\u00e1lpurs proved less liberal. The Afgh\u00e1ns came originally from Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, and now reside in the neighbourhood of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and in Northern Sind. They far surpass the Sind\u00eds in personal appearance, strength, and courage. The Baluch\u00eds, wild mountaineers from the barren hills to the westward, settled in Sind under the T\u00e1lpur dynasty, and received large j\u00e1g\u00edrs in return for military services. They are fairer, more powerful, and hardier than the Sind\u00eds; they have genuine though peculiar ideas of honour; and they are brave soldiers, with a large share of national pride. On the other hand, they are grossly illiterate, rough in manners, drunken and debauched, violent and revengeful, and wholly addicted to coarse amusements. In religion, they belong to the Sunni sect, though the T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs, on their arrival in Sind, adopted the Shi\u00e1 persuasion. About 80 clans are settled in the plains. The Africans represent the slaves of Sind, brought over by way of Maskat from Zanzibar or Abyssinia. Emancipated at the British annexation, they still marry, as a rule, within their own race, and remain inmates of their former masters' houses. A small body of Memons gather around Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sehw\u00e1n, and Kar\u00e1chi. They are doubtless Hindus by origin, who became Musalm\u00e1ns and emigrated to Sind during the Kalhora rule. They engage in trade, agriculture, and breeding camels. Many of them possess great learning, and they have done more than any other class to introduce religious knowledge into the Province. The Khw\u00e1jas, a numerous body in Kar\u00e1chi, are heterodox Musalm\u00e1ns, carrying the Shi\u00e1 doctrines to an extreme. The Hindus occupy in Sind a position analogous to that of the Musalm\u00e1ns in Hindust\u00e1n. Few of them, apparently, belong to native families which have survived the long Muhammadan domination; they have generally immigrated from the Punjab in recent times, and retain their distinctive names, features, and religion. The Br\u00e1hmans comprise two classes, which do not intermarry; and they are mainly confined to the large towns. The lower castes are essentially similar to their brethren in the Punjab. The S\u00edkhs reside in considerable numbers at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sehw\u00e1n, and other towns. Kar\u00e1chi, the capital city, had a total population in 1872 of 56,753 persons; but its commercial importance is far greater than this total would seem to imply. Shikarpur, the great d\u00e9p\u00f4t of transit trade with the Bol\u00e1n Pass and Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, had 38,170; Haidarabad, the T\u00e1lpur capital, 35,272. The other chief towns and places of interest include\u2014Aror, the capital of Sind under its Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s; Brahmanabad, a mass of vast and extensive ruins of very great antiquity, near Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur; the fortified island of Bukkur, in the Indus; Ket\u00ed, the port on the principal mouth of the\nIndus (2199 persons); KHAIRPUR, the capital of the State of the same name (7275); KOTRI, the station on the Indus Valley Railway opposite Haidarabad (7949); LARKHANA, a considerable manufacturing town (10,643); ROHRI (8580); SEHWAN (4296), the deserted port of SHAHBANDAR; SUKKUR, the great inland port of the Indus, and point of departure for the new line of rail to the Bolan Pass (13,318); TATTA, the old emporium on the seaboard (7951); and JACOBABAD, the chief military station of the Frontier District (10,954).\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The total extent of cultivated land in Sind in 1873-74 amounted to no more than 1,863,615 acres, by far the greater portion of the Province being absolutely barren. There are two principal harvests\u2014the rabi, sown in August, September, or October, and reaped in February, March, or April; and the kharif, sown during the floods of the Indus, in May, June, July, or August, and reaped in October, November, or December. The rabi consists of wheat, barley, gram, vetches, oil-seeds, indigo, hemp, and vegetables. The kharif includes the millets known as bajra and joar (the two chief food grains in Sind), rice, oil-seeds, pulses, and cotton. The area under each staple in 1873-74 was as follows:\u2014Joar, 388,418 acres; bajra, 358,670 acres; rice, 476,439 acres; oil-seeds, 216,199 acres; wheat, 260,056 acres; cotton, 50,577 acres; barley, 10,331 acres; indigo, 5757 acres; tobacco, 7365 acres; and sugar-cane, 3716 acres. The distribution into harvests was as follows:\u2014Kharif, 1,227,646 acres; rabi, 422,895 acres; intermediate or mixed, 213,074 acres. The fruits common to the country include dates, plantains, mangoes, limes, oranges, pomegranates, citrons, figs, grapes, tamarinds, mulberries, and melons. The apples of Sind are famous for their fine quality. The British authorities have lately introduced apricots, peaches, and nectarines, with excellent results. The methods of cultivation still differ little, if at all, from the primitive types. Rotation of crops is unknown, and the implements belong to the coarsest patterns. Two bullocks generally draw the clumsy native plough; while a heavy log of wood, with a man perched on either end, and drawn by four bullocks, does duty for a harrow. The dry character of the soil, and the almost complete absence of rain, render irrigation a matter of prime importance to the cultivator. Though situated on the very verge of either monsoon, the Province derives no benefit from their rainfall; for the north-western monsoon, which deluges the hills of Baluchistan, extends no farther eastward than Karachi; while the south-western monsoon terminates at Lakhpat Bandar on the boundary of Cutch (Kachchh), as regularly as though it intentionally avoided the frontiers of Sind. Sometimes, indeed, for two or three years in succession, no rain falls in the Province. Under these circumstances, the Indus almost becomes to Sind what the Nile is to Egypt. Numerous irrigation canals, drawn from\nthe main river or its tributaries, intersect the country in every direction. These canals are carried away from the raised bed of the stream in an oblique direction, so as to secure the greatest possible fall per mile. None of them have their heads where the bank is permanent, and none are deep enough to draw off water except during inundation. The river must consequently rise several feet before the canals will fill. Many of the channels are old natural beds of the side branches, now deserted; and all have the appearance rather of rivers than of artificial cuts. The canal system is very imperfect, owing to the want of permanent head-works, and the constant accumulation of silt. Cultivation is accordingly exposed to many risks, except in those lands where irrigation is always carried on by means of water-wheels; but as this method is expensive, the poorer cultivators prefer the inferior and precarious tillage of lands which can be directly flooded from the canals, where a small deficiency of water often entirely cuts off the whole crop. From the capricious nature of the water supply, cultivation accordingly becomes a species of lottery, the cultivator being rich one season and a bankrupt the next. Too little or too much water, an early or a late supply, may destroy his only chance of a harvest. Owing to the frequent failures, agriculture is, on the whole, a poorly paid occupation; yet the peasantry prefer the gambling risk to steady and well-paid labour. This precariousness in the returns of cultivation renders the Sind peasantry an improvident and thriftless body. They are almost always in debt to the Hindu money-lenders, who often exact as much as cent. per cent. on their advances. The population is almost wholly engaged in agriculture, yet the Province does not usually produce much more than a sufficient quantity of food grains for its own consumption, and considerable imports take place in years of scarcity. The land tenures of Sind belong to extremely simple types. The landowners may be divided into three classes\u2014large proprietors, a numerically small but very influential body; the holders of small estates, of a few hundred acres, answering to the middle-class gentry; and the peasant proprietors, a large body, paying revenue directly to Government, or to the alienee holding Government rights. The British authorities have upheld and fostered the rights of the smaller occupants against the encroachments of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, thus encouraging the spirit of independence amongst the cultivating classes.\n\nCommerce and Communications.\u2014The trade of Sind centres almost entirely upon the great seaport of Kar\u00e1chi, a creation of British rule, and now the chief port of entry and exit for the Punjab. The total value of the imports of Kar\u00e1chi in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a31,774,423; while those of the whole Province, excluding the capital, amounted only to \u00a340,242. In the same year, the exports of Kar\u00e1chi amounted to \u00a32,112,419, and of the remainder of Sind to \u00a3125,774. The staple\narticles of export are raw cotton, wool, and grain of various kinds. Kar\u00e1chi has long formed the chief outlet for the cotton crops of Sind and the Punjab. The Province at one time actually imported the material necessary for its own slight domestic manufactures from Cutch (Kachchh) and Guzerat, to the amount of several thousand maunds annually. About 1840, however, extensive cotton plantations sprang up in Sind itself. In 1861, exports first began; and in 1866, they had reached the total of 28,128,900 lbs. A large portion of this amount, however, came from the Punjab. The home yield at present averages from 18,000 to 20,000 bales annually; though it is calculated that the Province still contains 3,000,000 acres of uncultivated land capable of growing the plant. The remainder consists of Punjab cotton, from the Districts of M\u00falt\u00e1n, Lahore, and Amritsar; but it bears in the European markets the name of 'Sind,' from its place of shipment. Since 1870, a large trade in raw cotton has sprung up with China. The wool of Sind forms a staple of almost equal importance; though the larger portion of the quantity exported comes, not from the Province itself, but from Firozpur District in the Punjab, and from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n. The supply from the latter countries is brought into the market in a dirty and inferior condition. The value of wool exported from Kar\u00e1chi in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a3634,874. Extensive beds of bay salt occur on the Sirganda Creek, an eastern arm of the Indus, said to be capable of supplying the necessary consumption of the whole world for a century. The deposit is remarkably pure, and consists of large crystals. Excise restrictions long prevented it from competing with other Indian salts, but these have now been removed. The great harbour works of Kar\u00e1chi are more fully described under that article. Communications are carried on by means of the Indus, by numerous excellent roads, and by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. The river, the great source of wealth to the Province, is under the charge of a special Government department, the Indus Conservancy, which removes all obstructions to navigation as soon as they appear. A flotilla of steamboats, in connection with the railway, plies regularly up and down, carrying the manufactures of Europe upward, and the produce of Sind and the Punjab downward. The Sind section of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway runs from Kar\u00e1chi to Kotri, a distance of 106 miles, its main object being to facilitate the transmission of goods from Kar\u00e1chi to Northern Sind and the Punjab, or vice versa; thus saving the long detour by sea and river between Kar\u00e1chi and Kotri, via the Indus Delta. From Kotri the line is now continued, under the name of the Indus Valley State Railway, to Sukkur, whence a newly constructed branch starts for the Bol\u00e1n Pass. The Indus at Sukkur has not yet been bridged; but from Rohri, on the opposite bank of the river, the railway proceeds into Bah\u00e1walpur.\nState, and so joins the Punjab system at M\u00falt\u00e1n. The submarine cable, laid in 1864, connects Kar\u00e1chi with Fao in Turkish Arabia, and thence by Turkish Government telegraph with Constantinople and Western Europe. Another line runs from Kar\u00e1chi along the Makr\u00e1n coast, and thence by submarine cable to Bushire in Persia, connecting ultimately with the Russian system, as well as with the Siemens line to Berlin and England.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Sind forms a Province under a Commissioner, subordinate to the Government of Bombay. It contains three Collectorate\u2014those of Kar\u00e1chi, Shikarpur, and Haidarabad; besides the two Political Superintendencies of Thar and Parkar, and the Frontier District, with the Native State of Khairpur. The total imperial revenue of the Province in 1874-75 amounted to \u00a3648,014, of which \u00a3397,934 was derived from the land tax. The other chief sources of revenue were forests, excise, customs, stamps, and telegraphs. The local revenue in the same year amounted to \u00a3125,382, arising mainly from public works and municipal funds. The land tax ordinarily forms two-thirds of the net revenue of Sind; but remissions are constantly necessitated by the droughts, floods, or bursting of embankments. In spite of these drawbacks, however, the revenue has steadily increased under British rule. The cost of clearing canals forms one of the most important items of public expenditure. The total police force of the Province consisted in the year 1874-75 of 3977 officers and men; but the area includes so large an extent of desert, that any general statement of numbers per square mile could only mislead. In Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, where population is thickest, there is 1 policeman to every 11 square miles and to every 824 inhabitants; in Kar\u00e1chi District, including the capital, there is 1 policeman to every 12 square miles and to every 575 of the population; while in the desert District of the Thar and P\u00e1rk\u00e1r, there is only 1 policeman to every 25 square miles and to every 358 inhabitants. The postal department maintains 3 disbursing and 48 non-disbursing post offices. Education has made rapid and satisfactory progress in Sind since the British annexation. The total number of Government schools in 1873-74 amounted to 213, of which 26 were for girls. The number of pupils was 12,728, of whom 8531 were Hindus and only 4139 Muhammadans. The Musalm\u00e1n population show but little interest in education; and specially neglect that of their daughters. The figures, however, exhibit a great advance upon the condition of Sind in 1859-60, when the Province contained only 20 Government schools, and the educational budget amounted only to \u00a31299; whereas by 1873-74, it had risen to \u00a321,184. The number of indigenous schools at either date cannot be accurately ascertained. Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sukkur each possess a normal school, and the former town has also an engineering school.\nAmong private institutions, the European and Indo-European schools at Kar\u00e1chi, and the missionary schools in that town and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, teach up to the matriculation standard of the Bombay University.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Owing to its prevalent aridity and the absence of the monsoons, Sind ranks amongst the hottest and most variable climates in India. The average temperature of the summer months is 95\u00b0 F., and that of the winter months 60\u00b0. But the thermometer frequently rises in summer to 110\u00b0 and occasionally to 120\u00b0; while in winter it falls at night a few degrees below freezing-point, and ranges even in the day-time from 40\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. No other part of India has so long a continuance of excessively hot weather, owing to the deficiency of rain. The climate on the sea-coast, however, is much more equable in temperature than that of Upper Sind; and Kar\u00e1chi, the great centre of European population, enjoys a strong sea-breeze, which blows day and night from April to October. In Northern Sind, the extremes of temperature are strongly marked. The thermometer at Shik\u00e1rpur often sinks below freezing-point in winter, and ice forms as late as February; yet in summer, for weeks together, the readings at midnight do not fall below 100\u00b0. This great and prolonged heat, coupled with the exhalations arising from the stagnant pools left after the annual inundation, produces a fatal fever and ague. The natives suffer severely from its effects, and British troops have often experienced a terrible mortality. The other prevailing diseases include small-pox and cholera. The latter complaint has often appeared in an epidemic form, and wrought great mischief in the country districts; but at Kar\u00e1chi, its ravages have lately been averted by the excellent sanitary precautions taken by the British authorities. Five civil surgeons are stationed respectively at Kar\u00e1chi, Kotri, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Shik\u00e1rpur, and Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, and an additional surgeon at Sukkur. Numerous charitable dispensaries have been established in all the chief towns. Vaccination has made satisfactory progress, no opposition being raised except amongst the Hindu population. In 1874-75, the Government vaccinators operated upon 94,252 persons.\n\nSindew\u00e1hi (Sindwai).\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 17' N., and long. 79\u00b0 42' E., 16 miles north of M\u00fal. Estimated pop. (1872), 4356, mostly Telinges. A fine tank 3 miles north-east of the town irrigates a wide extent of rice and sugar-cane fields. Sindew\u00e1hi manufactures cotton cloth and bangles, which are exported; and possesses some trade in cotton, grain, and raw sugar. It has Government schools for boys and girls, and is a police outpost.\n\nSindhiapura.\u2014One of the petty States of Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Bombay. Area, 2\u00bd square miles. The chief is named Chauh\u00e1n Jitab\u00e1wa. Estimated revenue (1875), \u00a3260; of which \u00a36 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\nSindi.\u2014Town in Wardha District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 48' N., and long. 78\u00b0 56' E., 20 miles east of Wardha town, on the Great India Peninsula Railway, which has a station here. Pop. (1872), 4867, chiefly weavers and cultivators. Manufactures\u2014coarse cotton cloth, oil, bangles, and shoes. A market is held every Thursday and Friday. Sindi has a school (with an English department), a public garden, a dispensary, and a storage yard for cotton near the railway station.\n\nSindkher.\u2014Chief town of a pargan\u00e1 of the same name in Buld\u00e1na District, Berar. Lat. 19\u00b0 57' N., long. 76\u00b0 10' E. According to one tradition, the town was founded and named about 1000 years ago by a king Sindur\u00e1ur; according to another, it takes its name from Sidha Khetak, 'village of saints,' an unbroken line of whom is said to have lived here since the foundation of the place. The pargan\u00e1 of Sindkher was granted in j\u00e1gir to the K\u00e1z\u00ed of the town about 1450 A.D.; who afterwards gave it over voluntarily to the J\u00e1duns, the head and founder of whom was Lakhj\u00ed, a R\u00e1jput from Kurw\u00e1li in North Hindust\u00e1n. Since then, Sindkher has been regarded as the chief seat of this family, who subsequently rose to much fame and power. The j\u00e1gir of the pargan\u00e1 was held by the J\u00e1dons for about 100 years, but was then restored to the K\u00e1z\u00ed of the day by Murshid Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, a nobleman who came to Sindkher on some commission from the Delhi Government. The half-finished fort still stands north-west of Sindkher; it is about 150 yards square. The temple of Nilkantheswar to the south-west is supposed to be the oldest structure built by Hem\u00e1r Panth; it bears an inscription, which is, however, nearly effaced, being some feet under water in the tank near the temple. Several palaces, such as the Mah\u00e1lb\u00e1gh, Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l, the Desmukh's residence, and three or four large wells built by the J\u00e1dons, attest the magnificence and prosperity of the town in their time. In one of the frequent transfers from the Niz\u00e1m to the Marhatt\u00e1s, Sindkher fell to R\u00e1noj\u00ed Sindhia, who held it for nearly sixty years. It was restored to the Niz\u00e1m in 1803. B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1 encamped at Sindkher for some days in 1818, when the British troops were on his track. In 1804, General Wellesley (Wellington) writes: 'Sindkher is a nest of thieves; the situation of this country is shocking; the people are starving in hundreds, and there is no Government to afford the slightest relief.' The decline of the town was hastened by marauders, whose names\u2014Mohan Sinh, Budlam Sh\u00e1h, and Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n\u2014are yet remembered with terror. Of the once extensive irrigated gardens of Sindkher, only a few fruit-trees survive.\n\nSindkhera.\u2014Municipal town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 17' 30\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 50' E., north of Dhulia. Pop. (1872), 4501; average municipal revenue, \u00a3116. Post office.\n\nSindurjana.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar.\u2014See SENDURJANA.\nSindwa.\u2014Village and fort in Central India; situated in lat. $21^\\circ 40'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 20'$ E. (Thornton), on the route from Mhow to Bombay, 90 miles south-west of the former town and 274 north-east of the latter. It lies 9 miles outside and north of the Sindwa Gh\u00e1t, a somewhat steep but much frequented mountain pass, leading from the highlands of the S\u00e1tpura range to the valley of the T\u00e1pti in Kh\u00e1ndesh. Thornton says the fort, which is of masonry, about a mile in circumference, was, with a glacis of 2000 yards, ceded to the British Government by Holkar by the treaty of Mandeswar; but was restored to him upon the condition of his building a bridge over the Gohi river.\n\nSinga.\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab; leading across the Him\u00e1layan range, which bounds Kun\u00e1war to the south. Lat. $31^\\circ 15'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 29'$ E. Stated by Thornton to be open from May till the middle of August, but impracticable at other times from the depth of the snow. Elevation above sea level, between 16,000 and 17,000 feet.\n\nSing\u00e1lil\u00e1.\u2014Hill range in D\u00e1rj\u00edsl\u00edng District, Bengal. An immense spur, 60 miles long, stretching south from K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1 to the plains of India, and separating Sikkim from East Nep\u00e1l. Lat. $27^\\circ 1'$ to $27^\\circ 14'$ N., and long. $88^\\circ$ to $88^\\circ 2'$ E. The waters from its west flank flow into the T\u00e1mbar, and those from the east into the Great Ranj\u00edt, a feeder of the T\u00edsta. The highest peaks of the Sing\u00e1lil\u00e1 range are\u2014PHALALUM, 12,042; SUBARGUM, 10,430 feet; TANGLU, 10,084; SITANG; and SINCHAL PAHAR.\n\nSing\u00e1nall\u00far.\u2014Town in Coimbatore District, Madras, and a station on the Madras South-Western Railway; situated in lat. $12^\\circ 9'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 16' 40''$ E. Pop. (1871), 7125, inhabiting 1391 houses. The town and fort were destroyed by the Marhatt\u00e1s. The town has recovered under British rule, and is now a busy place.\n\nSinganmat.\u2014Principal peak in the Sankara range, Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal. Well known as a landmark to all the country round.\n\nSingapur (Singapuram).\u2014Town in J\u00e1ipur (Jeypore) State, Madras; situated in lat. $19^\\circ 3' 19''$ N., and long. $82^\\circ 43' 16''$ E., 21 miles west of Bissem Katak and on the Banjara route to N\u00e1gpur. Estimated pop. (1871), about 800, chiefly Konds.\n\nSing\u00e1rapet (Singaricotta, Tingrecotta).\u2014Pass connecting the Districts of Salem and South Arcot, Madras.\u2014See CHENGAMA.\n\nSingaurgarh.\u2014Hill fort in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $23^\\circ 32' 30''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 47' E.$, 26 miles north-west of Jabalpur city, on a high hill commanding the narrow Sangr\u00e1mpur valley. Founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bel, a Chandela R\u00e1jput, it was enlarged by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dalpat S\u00e1, of Garha-Mandla, who made it the seat of Government about 1540. It was the scene of the defeat of R\u00e1ni Durg\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed by Asaf Kh\u00e1n, an officer of Akbar; and the fort stood a siege of nine months in the days of Aurangzeb. The remains of the outer circum-\nvallation are very extensive. Of the inner fort on a high central hill, only a tower and some ruined reservoirs remain. Two smaller towers also stand on neighbouring hills.\n\nSingbh\u00fam (Sinhbh\u00fam; Sinha-bh\u00fami, 'Lion Land').\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between $21^\\circ 59'$ and $22^\\circ 53'$ N. lat., and between $85^\\circ 2'$ and $86^\\circ 56'$ E. long. Approximate area, 4503 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1872, 415,023 persons. These are the figures given in the Census Report; but since it was published, the area and population of S\u00e1raik\u00e1l\u00e1 and Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n have been deducted, as they had already been included in the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Tributary States. The corrected area of Singbh\u00fam District, according to the Parliamentary Abstract of 1879, is 3897 square miles, and the population 322,396. The District forms the southeastern portion of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division. It is bounded on the north by the Districts of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam, on the east by Midnapur, on the south by the Tributary States of Orissa, and on the west by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and the Tributary States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The boundaries follow for the most part the crests of the hill ranges which wall in the District on every side; but owing to the fact that few of the ranges have distinctive names, it is impossible to define the boundary line more precisely. A portion of the northern boundary, 15 miles in length, is marked by the Subarnarekh\u00e1 river, which fills a gap between two hill ridges; and a still smaller part of the southern boundary coincides with the same river, which here separates Singbh\u00fam from the Orissa State of Morbhanj. Farther west, again, the Baitaran\u00ed river, rising in Keunjhar, forms 8 miles of the boundary between that State and Singbh\u00fam District. Singbh\u00fam District is made up of the Government estate of the Kolh\u00e1n or Ho-desam ('country of the Hos'), the Fiscal Division of Dhalbh\u00fam, and the political estates of Par\u00e1h\u00e1t, S\u00e1raikala, and Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n. The administrative headquarters are at Chaibasa.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The central portion of Singbh\u00fam consists of a long undulating tract of country, running east and west, and enclosed by great hill ranges. The depressions which lie between the successive ridges are terraced for rice cultivation on the system followed in the Districts of Hazaribagh and Lohardaga; and the scenery in this central strip, which is the most fertile part, is like that of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Proper. It is fairly clear from forest, and varies in elevation above sea level from 400 feet near the Subarnarekh\u00e1 on the east, to 750 feet around the station of Chaibasa. To the south of this is an elevated plateau embracing 700 square miles of country, where the general level rises to upwards of 1000 feet, and meets the hills of Keunjhar State. The west of the District, bordering on Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, is a mountainous tract of vast extent, sparsely inhabited by the wildest of the Kols, and con-\nsidered by Colonel Dalton to be the region from which that tribe first descended into the plains of Singbh\u00fam. The extreme south-west corner, bordering on G\u00e1ngpur State, is a still grander mass of mountains, rising to a height of 3500 feet, and known as 'Saranda of the seven hundred hills.' The population is very scattered; and the whole of Saranda contains but a few poor hamlets nestling in deep valleys, and belonging for the most part to one of the least reclaimed tribes of Kols. From the Lay\u00e1d\u00e1 Hill range on the north-west of Singbh\u00fam, many rocky spurs strike out into the District; the more prominent of them attaining an elevation of 2900 feet. Among other ranges and peaks, the following may be mentioned:\u2014The Chaitanpur range, in the estate of Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n, reaches an elevation of 2529 feet. The K\u00e1pag\u00e1di range, a conspicuous ridge, rises abruptly from the plain; its highest peak is 1398 feet above the sea, and from that point the range runs south-east till it culminates in Tuil\u00edg\u00e1r Hill (2492 feet). On the south-west of the District, a series of hills without any general name rise to a height of 3500 feet, and entirely occupy the tract referred to above as 'Saranda of the seven hundred hills.' A conspicuous spur of this mass of hills stretches out towards Chaib\u00e1s\u00e1, and culminates in the peak of Ang\u00e1rbari, 2137 feet high. The principal rivers of the District are the Subarnarekha (chief affluents, the Karkai and Sanjai) and the Koel, with its affluents the North and South Karo and the Koina. About two-thirds of the area of Singbh\u00fam is covered with primeval forest, containing some valuable timber-trees. Jungle products are abundant, but, owing to the isolated position of the District, they yield no revenue. The forests give shelter to tigers, leopards, bears, buffaloes, and several kinds of deer; and small herds of elephants occasionally wander from the Megh\u00e1sani Hills in Morbhanj. Wild ducks, pigeons, geese, snipe, partridge, and quail are found in the low-lying lands. The pangolin or scaly ant-eater is one of the curiosities of the District. Snakes of all kinds abound.\n\nHistory.\u2014The following section of this article is condensed from Colonel Dalton's valuable Ethnology of Bengal, the portions used being quoted in full in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 107-114. The Singbh\u00fam R\u00e1jput chiefs have been known to the officers of the British Government since 1803, in which year the Marquis of Wellesley, Governor-General, caused friendly communications to be addressed to the ancestor of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 (whose territory adjoined the Jungle Mah\u00e1l, then under the East India Company), regarding the assistance which he promised to render in the prosecution of the war against R\u00e1ghoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur. There does not appear to have been any intercourse between British officials and the people of the Kolh\u00e1n previous to the year 1819. Of the interior of their country, for years after the acquisition of the surrounding Districts, nothing whatever was known. The Hos or Larka Kols would allow no strangers\nto settle in, or even pass through, the Kolh\u00e1n; and pilgrims to Jagan-\nn\u00e1th had to make a circuit of several days' journey to avoid it. In\n1819, the Assistant Political Agent was directed to proceed to P\u00e1r\u00e1-\nh\u00e1t, to negotiate a settlement with its chief; but he did not succeed in\npenetrating so far into their country. In 1820, the R\u00e1ja of P\u00e1r\u00e1h\u00e1t\nacknowledged himself a feudatory of the British Government, and\nagreed to pay a small annual tribute. At this time, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and\nzam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of Singbh\u00fam were pressing on the Political Agent, Major\nRoughsedge, their claims to supremacy in the Kolh\u00e1n, asserting that\nthe Kols were their subjects in rebellion, and urging on Government\nto force them to return to their allegiance. The Kols denied that they\nwere subject to the chiefs. Until they quarrelled they regarded them,\nthey said, as friends and allies, not as rulers; and if they had at any\ntime been their subjects, they had achieved their liberty in various hard-\nfought fields, and were entitled to their independence. The chiefs\nadmitted that for more than fifty years they had been unable to exer-\ncise any control over them; and Major Roughsedge refers to three\nformidable but abortive attempts made (the last in 1800) to subjugate\nthem. After these attacks on their independence, it appears that the\nLarkas retaliated on all the bordering States, committing great ravages\nand depopulating entire villages. In 1820, Major Roughsedge entered\ntheir country with a force of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, with the\navowed object of compelling the Kols to submit to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s who\nclaimed their allegiance. He did his best to conciliate them, and\nwas at first in hopes that he had succeeded. He was allowed to\nadvance unmolested into the heart of their territory; but while encamped\nat Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 on the Roro river, near the present station of the same\nname, an attack was made within sight of the camp by a body of\nLarkas, who killed one man and wounded several others with their battle-\naxes. They then moved away towards the hills; but their retreat was\ncut off by Lieutenant Maitland, who in several encounters dispersed\nthem with great loss. The whole of the northern p\u00edrs or communities\nentered into engagements to acknowledge and pay tribute to the R\u00e1j\u00e1\nof Singbh\u00fam. But in leaving the country, Major Roughsedge had to\nencounter the still fiercer Kols of the southern p\u00edrs, and, after fighting\nevery inch of his way out of Singbh\u00fam, left them unsubdued. On his\nleaving the District, a war broke out between the Larkas who had sub-\nmitted, and those who had not; and a body of 100 Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed Irregulars,\nsent to the assistance of the former, were driven out by the latter. In\n1821, a large force was employed to reduce the Larkas; and after a\nmonth's hostilities, the leaders, encouraged by a proclamation, sur-\nrendered. After a year or two of peace, however, they again became\nrestive, and gradually extended the circle of their depredations. The\nassistance rendered by them to the N\u00e1gpur Kols in 1831-32 was too\ngross a defiance of the Government to escape serious notice. Sir Thomas Wilkinson, who was then Agent to the Governor-General for the newly formed Non-Regulation Province of the South-Western Frontier, at once recognised the necessity of a thorough subjugation of the Kols, and equally the impolicy and futility of forcing them to submit to the chiefs. He proposed an occupation of Singbh\u00fam by an adequate force, and suggested that, when the people were thoroughly subdued, they should be placed under the direct management of a British officer, to be stationed at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 in the heart of their country. These views were accepted; a force under Colonel Richards entered Singbh\u00fam in November 1836, and by the end of the February following all the refractory head-men had submitted and entered into engagements to bear true allegiance to the British Government. From this time until 1857, there was no disturbance, and the District seemed to have settled down into quietness and prosperity. In that year, the P\u00e1r\u00e1h\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1, after wavering for a little between loyalty and rebellion, chose the latter, and a considerable section of the Kols supported him. A tedious and difficult campaign ensued, the rebels taking refuge in the mountain fastnesses whenever they were driven from the plains. Eventually, however, they surrendered (in 1859), and the capture of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 put an end to the disturbances. The Kols have given no trouble since that time.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first attempt at an enumeration of the people of Singbh\u00fam was made in 1867, when a Census was undertaken of the Government estate of the Kolh\u00e1n. From the results of this, an estimate was made for the total population of the District, which amounted, according to the calculations, to 355,906. The regular Census of 1872 was taken on an approximate area of 4503 square miles, and disclosed a total population of 415,023 persons, dwelling in 84,416 houses; average density of the population, 92 per square mile. Since the Census Report was published, the area and population of S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 and Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n have been deducted, as they had already been included in the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Tributary States. The corrected area of Singbh\u00fam District, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879, is 3897 square miles, and the population, 322,396. The following figures, however, are taken from the Census Report, and include S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 and Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n. The population is very unequally distributed in different parts of the District\u2014thus, the estates of Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n and S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 have an average of 176 and 145 persons to the square mile, while the fiscal division of Dhalbh\u00fam shows 98, and the Kolh\u00e1n and P\u00e1r\u00e1h\u00e1t only 79 and 69 respectively. The number of males in the District in 1872 was 207,926, and of females, 207,097; proportion of males, 50\u00b71 per cent. of the total population. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years old\u2014males, 88,617; females, 77,257; total children, 165,874, or 39\u00b797\nper cent.: above 12 years\u2014males, 119,309; females, 129,840; total adults 249,149, or 60.03 per cent. of the total population. The ethnical division of the people was returned as follows:\u2014Non-Asiatics, 20; and Asiatics, 415,003. Belonging to aboriginal tribes, there were 256,065; of semi-Hinduized aborigines, the number was 28,747; Hindus numbered 124,125; persons of Hindu origin not recognising caste, 3577; and Muhammadans, 2487. Among aboriginal tribes, the most numerous are the Kols, of whom there were 150,925 in 1872; the Santals, 51,132; and the Bhumijs, 37,253. Of semi-aborigines, the Bhuiyas numbered 12,078. The name Kol, as popularly used, includes not only Hos and Mundas, but also the Dravidian Uraons, while its scientific use embraces the three cognate Kolarian tribes of Mundas, Hos or Larka Kols, and Bhumijs. The bulk of the Kols enumerated above are Hos, otherwise called Larka or 'fighting' Kols, the characteristic aboriginal race of Singbh\u00fcm District. A very full and detailed account of this tribe, taken from Colonel Dalton's Ethnology of Bengal, will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 39-59. They appear to have no traditions of origin or migration that throw much light on their history. As has been said in the preceding section, they isolated themselves jealously for many years, and even at the present day the exclusiveness of the old Hos is remarkable. They will not allow aliens to hold lands near their villages; and, indeed, if it were left to them, no strangers would be permitted to settle in the Kolhan. Physically, the Singbh\u00fcm Hos are the finest of all the Kolarian tribes. The men average 5 feet 5 or 6 inches in height; the women 5 feet 2 inches; and both men and women are noticeable for their fine, erect carriage and long free stride. They do not encumber themselves with much clothing, and even wealthy men move about all but naked, as proudly as if they were clad in purple and fine linen. The Hos are fair marksmen with the bow and arrow, and great sportsmen. They are a purely agricultural people, and their festivals are all connected with that pursuit. They show great reverence for the dead, and their peculiar and touching funeral ceremonies are well described by Colonel Dalton. The same writer describes the Hos as possessing 'a manner free from servility, but never rude; a love, or at least the practice, of truth; a feeling of self-respect, rendering them keenly sensitive under rebuke;' and he adds that since they have come under our rule, 'they have become less suspicious, less revengeful, less bloodthirsty, less contumacious,' than they were. They are still, however, very impulsive and easily excited to rash, headstrong action. The number of Br\u00e1hmans in Singbh\u00fcm in 1872 was 4098; of Khand\u00e1its, 2255; and of R\u00e1jputs, 1718. The most numerous Hindu castes in the District are the Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, a pastoral caste, numbering in 1872, 34,987; the T\u00e1nt\u00eds, or weavers, 20,758; and the\nKurm\u00eds, a caste of cultivators, 19,667. There is no municipality in Singbh\u00fam, and Chaibasa, the headquarters station, with a population of over 4000, is little more than a large village. A fair is held here about Christmas time. In the wilder jungles to the south and east of the Kolh\u00e1n proper, there still exist, in the shape of tanks and architectural remains, traces of a people more civilised than the Kols of the present day. The most interesting of these are\u2014Benu S\u00e1gar, a fine tank surrounded by the ruins of what must have been a large town; Kiching, with its temples still resorted to by pilgrims; and two very curious artificial pools of water, called the Surmi and Durmi. The sepulchral and monumental stones, which are characteristic of the Mundas and Hos, occur in large numbers throughout the District.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The system of rice cultivation is similar to that described in the article on Hazaribagh, though it is not so fully developed here as in that District and Lohardaga. Land is classified on the same principle, and the crops are the same; but, except in villages occupied by the Hindu caste of Kurmis, the general style of cultivation is primitive, and the land undergoes scarcely any systematic preparation for the crop. Of late years, however, the Kols have made a considerable advance in the methods of tillage, and now get three crops in the year when formerly they had but one. The chief crops of the District, besides rice, are wheat, Indian corn, peas, gram, mustard, sugar-cane, cotton, and tobacco. The area under different crops has been estimated as follows:\u2014Rice, 503,233 acres; cotton, 23,637 acres; Indian corn, 63,029 acres; oil-seeds, 40,665 acres; wheat, 1271 acres; pulses, 3813 acres. As, however, great uncertainty attaches to all the agricultural statistics of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, these figures must be looked upon as approximate only. Wages in Singbh\u00fam have not risen of late years in proportion to the increase in the price of ordinary food staples. Labour is abundant, and families are, as usual in the case of a considerable aboriginal population, large. Unskilled labourers (male) received in 1872 from 2\u00bdd. to 3d. a day, and females 1\u00bdd. The rate for women is the same as it was in former years, but men used only to receive 1\u00bdd. Bricklayers and carpenters now earn 6d. per diem; in former years their wages were 3\u00bdd. The price of the best cleaned rice in 1871 was 2s. 8\u00bdd. per cwt., and of coarse rice 2s. 3\u00bdd. The price of the best paddy in that year was 1s. 1d., and of Indian corn 1s. 8\u00bdd. per cwt. These prices represent a rise of from 25 to 50 per cent. on the rates which ruled ten years earlier. The prevailing land tenures vary in different parts of the District. In the Kolh\u00e1n there is now only one kind of tenure,\u2014under which rent is paid direct to Government by each individual rayat, whose right of occupation is hereditary, but who is liable to enhancement of rent at the expiration of the current settlement. Dhalbh\u00fam bears a fixed assessment of \u00a3426, 14s. It was\noriginally one of the Jungle Mah\u00e1ls, and was transferred to Singbh\u00fam from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam in 1846. The proprietor of the pargan\u00e1 calls himself R\u00e1j\u00e1, but he is officially styled zamind\u00e1r. Among the intermediate tenures between the zamind\u00e1r and the cultivators may be mentioned\u2014khoroposh or maintenance grants (74 in number) to younger members of the zamind\u00e1r's family; gh\u00e1tw\u00e1li tenures for some kinds of police service, the precise nature of which cannot now be ascertained; and sad chakr\u00e1n holdings (51), service tenures entirely dependent on the pleasure of the zamind\u00e1r. The other prevalent intermediate tenures are\u2014Brahmottar, 93; debottar, 85; and pradh\u00e1n\u00ed or farming leases for (839) limited or (74) unlimited periods. The actual cultivating tenures in Dhalbh\u00fam are known by the generic term praj\u00e1l\u00ed (from praj\u00e1, a peasant), and are of two kinds, kh\u00fant katti, and thik\u00e1. The kh\u00fant katti cultivators are supposed to be descendants of the persons who originally reclaimed the land from jungle, and formed the village; all of them have permanent rights of occupancy, and some have the further privilege of holding at a fixed rate of rent. Rayats holding under the thik\u00e1 tenure are persons who came into the village after the first reclaimers. Their holdings are not transferable, and they have no share in the common rights of the village. The tenures in the political estates of P\u00e1r\u00e1h\u00e1t, S\u00e1raikal\u00e1, and Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n do not materially differ from the intermediate tenures in Dhalbh\u00fam, just mentioned. Chakr\u00e1n holdings are very numerous, and the chiefs consequently derive a proportionally small income from their large estates.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is subject to partial scarcities, caused by deficiency in the local rainfall. In years of drought, the cultivators resort to artificial reservoirs, wells, and tanks for water to irrigate their fields. The famine of 1866 was felt throughout the District, but only severely in Dhalbh\u00fam, where the chief food of the people is rice. The highest price reached for ordinary rice in Singbh\u00fam in that year (in August) was \u00a31, 2s. a cwt. The District mainly depends on the winter rice crop; and if the yield of that crop were to be less than one-half, and if the price of ordinary rice were to rise as high as from 7s. to 9s. a cwt., these symptoms should be considered as a warning of approaching famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of Singbh\u00fam is carried on mainly by means of permanent markets, the chief of which are held at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1, Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n, S\u00e1raikal\u00e1, and Bah\u00e1ragarh\u00e1. The principal exports are common cereals, pulses, oil-seeds, stick-lac, iron, and tasar-silk cocoons; the chief imports\u2014salt, cotton yarn, English piece-goods, tobacco, and brass utensils. The value of the silk export was estimated in 1871 to amount to \u00a310,000; and it is said that the total value of the District exports largely exceeds that of the imports. The chief manufactures of Singbh\u00fam are coarse cotton cloth, brass and earthenware cooking\nutensils, and soapstone platters. There are a few weavers of *tasar*-silk cloth in S\u00e1raikal\u00e1. Copper is found in S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 and Dhalbh\u00fam, and an English Company was started in 1857 to work the mine. The enterprise was conducted on too expensive a scale, and failed in 1859; a second Company, formed in 1862, was not more fortunate, and was dissolved in 1864, without having even paid rent for the two years over which its operations extended. The total length of roads in Singbh\u00fam in 1870 was 306 miles, maintained at an average annual cost for repairs of \u00a3830.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014In 1837, the revenue of the District, which was then smaller in area than at present, amounted to \u00a3527, almost entirely derived from land; and the current expenditure to \u00a31011, or nearly double the revenue. In 1846, the *pargan\u00e1* of Dhalbh\u00fam, assessed in perpetuity at \u00a3426, was added to the District; and in 1850-51, the total revenue was returned at \u00a31219, and the civil expenditure at \u00a31928. Thus within a period of thirteen years, between 1837 and 1850-51, the revenue was more than doubled, owing mainly to the extension of cultivation in the Kolh\u00e1n, and the amount accruing from Dhalbh\u00fam. It failed, however, to cover the expenditure on civil administration, which had increased by 58 per cent. within the same period. In 1870-71, the net revenue amounted to \u00a39500, and the total expenditure to \u00a310,163. The expansion of revenue is chiefly due to the settlement of the Kolh\u00e1n in 1866 at enhanced rates, and the sequestration in 1858 of the estate of P\u00e1r\u00e1h\u00e1t. The land tax forms by far the largest item in the revenue of the District. In 1837, it amounted to \u00a3523, derived solely from the Kolh\u00e1n. In 1846, the land revenue was \u00a31133; and in that year the *samind\u00e1r* of Dhalbh\u00fam was the only registered proprietor, and Dhalbh\u00fam and the Kolh\u00e1n were the only two estates on the District rent-roll. In 1870-71, the land revenue demand was \u00a36192, the number of estates being three. For police purposes, the District is divided into five estates\u2014viz. Kolh\u00e1n, P\u00e1r\u00e1h\u00e1t, Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n, S\u00e1raikal\u00e1, and Dhalbh\u00fam, the last named containing the two *th\u00e1nds* or police circles of Bah\u00e1ragarh\u00e1 and K\u00e1lk\u00e1pur. In 1872, the regular police force numbered 186 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34164. There was also a rural police or village watch of 1671 men, maintained by contributions from the villagers, and costing \u00a3907. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property in the District consisted of 1857 officers and men, showing (according to the Census returns of area and population) 1 man to every 2\u00b742 square miles of the area and to every 223 of the population. The estimated total cost was \u00a35071, giving an average of \u00a31, 2s. 6\u00bdd. per square mile of area and 3d. per head of the population. Suicide has always been a characteristic crime of the District; and in 1871, no fewer than 54 persons destroyed themselves, of whom\nwere males and 31 females. Of these 54 suicides, 48 were Kols, who are an extremely sensitive race. The average daily number of prisoners in the Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 jail in 1872 was 84. The progress of education in Singbh\u00fam has, owing to its secluded position, been very slow, but of late years there has been a great improvement in this respect. The number of Government and aided schools in 1870-71 was 9, with 684 pupils. By 1871-72, the number of schools had increased to 34, and of pupils to 1022; and in 1872-73, there were 63 schools, with 3144 pupils. There are no administrative Subdivisions in Singbh\u00fam, nor are there any parg\u00e1ns properly so called. The real internal divisional units of the District are the estates already referred to. The p\u00edr, or group of villages, is the administrative unit of the old village organization of the Hos and Mundas; but the fiscal character which it bears in the Kolh\u00e1n is solely of British institution, and does not form part of the indigenous system. It is both smaller and more symmetrical than the parg\u00e1ns of the Regulation Districts.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Singbh\u00fam is, as might be supposed from its inland position, dry. The civil station of Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 is healthy, but the jungle-clad hill tracts are so malarious that they cannot be visited with safety before the month of November. December and January are the coldest months, and at this season the thermometer sometimes falls as low as 50\u00b0 F. The weather in the hot season is extremely trying, the thermometer frequently marking 106\u00b0 F. in the shade. The average annual rainfall is returned at 53 inches. The prevailing endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers of the ordinary type. Epidemics of small-pox and cholera have occasionally occurred; the severest recent outbreak of cholera was that which immediately followed the famine of 1866. There is a charitable dispensary at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1.\n\nSingeswarth\u00e1n.\u2014Village in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 58' 48\" N., and long. 86\u00b0 50' 31\" E., 4 miles north of Madahpur\u00e1. Well known in Behar for being the scene of the largest elephant fair north of the Ganges; this is held in January, and attended by traders from Purniah, Monghyr, Tirhut, and the neighbouring parts of Nep\u00e1l. Elephants are brought from various places in India; native shoes, English cloth, horses, long Nep\u00e1lese knives or kukris form the other principal articles of commerce. Temple belonging to the P\u00e1ndes.\n\nSingh\u00e1na.\u2014Town in J\u00e1ipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 5' N., and long. 75\u00b0 44' E., 95 miles south-west of Delhi, and 80 north of J\u00e1ipur city. Elphinstone describes it as a handsome town built of stone, on the skirts of a hill of purplish rock, about 600 feet high. A copper-mine in a rocky hill, 2 miles south-west of the town, contains abundance of ore of a poor quality, yielding from 2 to 7 per cent. of metal. The miners, says Thornton, pay to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a sixth\nof the produce, besides a fixed rent of \u00a31400 annually. There are two ores, a sulphate and a sulphuret.\n\nSingim\u00e1ri.\u2014Village and th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police station in the south-west of Go\u00e1lpara District, Assam, near the left bank of the Brahmaputra; about 42 miles west of Tur\u00e1 station in the G\u00e1ro Hills, with which it is connected by road.\n\nSingim\u00e1ri.\u2014Principal river of Kuch Behar State, Bengal. Entering the State under the name of the J\u00e1ladh\u00e1k\u00e1, at its extreme north-west corner, near Moranger-h\u00e1t in Kh\u00edti, it flows in a south-eastern direction by the villages of Gil\u00e1d\u00e1ng\u00e1, P\u00e1nigr\u00e1m, Dhaib\u00e1ng\u00e1, Khaterb\u00e1r\u00e1i, and M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. In the middle of its course it is called the Mansh\u00e1hl, and lower down, the Singim\u00e1ri. It has several cross communications with the Dharl\u00e1 or Torsh\u00e1, and finally joins that river on the southern border of the St\u00e1te, near the trading villages of Durg\u00e1pur and Git\u00e1l-daha. It has several large tributaries, among which may be mentioned the Mujn\u00e1i, Satang\u00e1, Duduy\u00e1, Dolang, and D\u00e1lkho\u00e1. The capital of Kuch Behar was formerly situated on the banks of the Singim\u00e1ri, near Gos\u00e1in\u00edmar\u00e1i (at Kamat\u00e1pur), where the ruins of temples and fortresses still attest the bygone greatness of former days. The river is navigable all the year round by boats of 100 maunds burden as far as the Subdivisional station of M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, and even a little beyond, and in the rainy season is largely used by boats of all sizes.\n\nSingl\u00e1.\u2014River in the extreme south-east of Sylhet District, Assam, flowing north from the Lush\u00e1i Hills into the Surm\u00e1. It has given its name to an elephant mah\u00e1l or hunting ground, and also to a forest reserve.\n\nSingpho Hills.\u2014Tract of country bordering the extreme eastern frontier of Assam, occupied by the Singphos, a wild tribe who are said to be an offshoot of the Ka-khyens of Burma. In their own language, the word \u2018Singpho\u2019 means man. In ethnical characteristics, language, and religion, the Singphos differ markedly from the Khamt\u00edis and other neighbouring races of Shan origin. They are said to have first settled in their present home towards the close of the 18th century, when the power of the Aham kings was falling into decay. Their permanent villages were placed on the Teng\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed river east of Sadiy\u00e1, and on the Buri Dihing river in the tract called N\u00e1mr\u00fap. They took advantage of the disturbed state of Upper Assam, caused by the rebellion of the Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1s, to ravage the whole valley of the Brahmaputra, and carry off numbers of the Assamese into slavery. At the present time, there is a mongrel race well known in Upper Assam under the name of Doanniy\u00e1s, sprung from the intercourse between the Singphos and their female slaves. When the British took possession of the Province, these raids were suppressed. Captain Neufville, the commandant at Sadiy\u00e1, is said to have released 5000 Assamese captives after a single expe-\ndition. The Singphos have now entirely abandoned their old habits of lawlessness. They live by agriculture, and have considerable skill in the smelting of iron and in the weaving of cotton into coloured plaid checks. According to the Census Report of 1872, they only number 257 souls in the settled portion of Lakhimpur District.\n\nSingpur (or Sowasth\u00e1n Sinhpur).\u2014One of the Mew\u00e1s States in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Bombay. Estimated pop. (1872), 350. The principal produce is timber. There are no manufactures.\n\nSingrauli.\u2014Tract of land in M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a depressed alluvial basin, below the level of the surrounding country, and composed in parts of a rich black loam, merging at other places into a hard and unproductive clay. A portion of the tract lies within the dominions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Rewah.\n\nSinh\u00e1chalam (Sinha, \u2018a lion\u2019).\u2014Temple in Vizagapatam District, Madras; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 46\u2032 N., and long. 83\u00b0 11\u2032 8\u2033 E., on a hill (800 feet above sea level) 6 miles north-west of Vizagapatam town. The shrine, which is most picturesquely situated in a wooded glen, containing springs and beautiful cascades, is dedicated to the Lion incarnation of Vishnu, and is held in great veneration. It is believed to have been built by the Gajapati kings of Orissa, about 600 years ago; and among other handsome blackstone carvings, it bears an inscription dated 1526, recording the visit of the hero Krishna R\u00e1y\u00e1. About 200 years ago, it was endowed by the P\u00fasap\u00e1t\u00eds. It is now in the charge of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1garam, who has a house and beautiful rose-garden here, the latter laid out by his ancestor S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m R\u00e1o. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has also built and endowed a choultry (native inn) for pilgrims.\n\nSinhgarh (Sinhgad).\u2014Hill fort in the Haveli Subdivision of Poona (Pun\u00e1) District, Bombay; situated in lat. 18\u00b0 21\u2032 51\u2033 N., and long. 73\u00b0 47\u2032 51\u2033 E. Rising with a bold rocky outline from the plain, 12 miles south by west of Poona, Sinhgarh is the most marked object in the neighbourhood of that city, and during the hot season offers to Europeans a welcome change from the temperature of the plains. The fort was taken by storm by a British force in March 1818.\n\nSinjh\u00e1uli Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1dpur.\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 24\u2032 N., and long. 82\u00b0 35\u2032 E., on a picturesque spot on the high bank of the Tons, opposite Akbarpur, 36 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town, on the road to Jaunpur. Founded by Sujhawal, a Bhar chief, and called after him Sujhawalgarh, which has since been altered to Sinjh\u00e1uli. A certain Sayyid T\u00e1j settled here, and dug a tank; a tomb on an island within this tank bears an inscription dated 1365 A.D., one of the oldest in Oudh. A family of Kshattriya bankers formerly flourished here. Pop. (1869), 5069, of whom 2021 are Sunnis,\n84 Shi\u00e1s, and 2964 Hindus. Four mosques; 4 Hindu temples; 916 houses, of which 24 are of masonry.\n\n**Sinnar.**\u2014Chief town of the Sinnar Subdivision of N\u00e1sik District, Bombay; situated in lat. 19\u00b0 50' 25\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 2' 30\" E., on the N\u00e1sik and Poonah road, 17 miles south-east of the former town. It is a municipal town, with a population (1872) of 10,044 persons, almost entirely agricultural, and a municipal revenue of \u00a3150. Sub-judge's court, post office, and dispensary. A large portion of the land around the town is irrigated, and produces rich crops of sugar-cane, plantains, betel-leaves, and rice. Sinnar is said to have been founded by a Gauli R\u00e1j\u00e1, whose son, R\u00e1o Govind, built the handsome temple outside the town, at a cost of 2 l\u0101khs of rupees (say \u00a320,000). The town was at one time the headquarters of the local government under the Mughal Emperor.\n\n**Sinronch\u00e1.**\u2014Town in the Upper God\u00e1vari District, Central Provinces.\u2014See SIRONCHA.\n\n**Siob\u00e1ra.**\u2014One of the petty Bhil States in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Bombay.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\n**Siob\u00e1ra.**\u2014Poor but populous town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 8340. Situated in lat. 29\u00b0 12' N., and long. 78\u00b0 38' E., on the Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Hardw\u00e1r road, 28 miles south-east of Bijnaur town.\n\n**Sipr\u00e1 (S\u00edpri).**\u2014River of Central India, rising in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, on the north side of the Vindhya range, 11 miles east of the small town of Pipalda, in lat. 22\u00b0 37' N., and long. 76\u00b0 12' E. 'It has,' writes Thornton, 'a winding course, generally north-westerly, through a fertile country; and 40 miles from its source receives on its left side the small river Kaund, and, passing subsequently by the towns of Ujjain and Mehidpur, falls into the Chambal, on the right bank, in lat. 23\u00b0 54' N., and long. 75\u00b0 29' E., after a total course of 120 miles. . . . During the rains, the Sipr\u00e1 swells and overflows many places on its banks. In 1821, it rose to such a height as to wash away part of the town of Mehidpur.'\n\n**Sir\u00e1.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore; having been transferred from Chitaldrug District in 1868. Area, 670 square miles, of which 189 are cultivated; pop. (1871), 71,928, of whom 69,660 are Hindus, 1989 Muhammadans, 28 Jains, and 251 Christians. Land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rates, \u00a311,898, or 2s. 2d. per cultivated acre. The cocoa-nuts are of a specially fine quality.\n\n**Sir\u00e1.**\u2014Municipal town in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 44' 43\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 57' 16\" E., 33 miles north-north-west of T\u00famk\u00far town, and 73 miles north-west from Bangalore; headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name. Pop. (1871), 4231, of whom 3354 are Hindus, 648 Muhammadans, and 229 Christians. Municipal revenue\n(1874-75), \u00a322; rate of taxation, 1d. per head. Formerly the capital of an extensive Muhammadan Province. Its foundation is attributed to Rangappa Nayak, chief of Ratnagiri; but before the fort was completed, it was captured, in 1638, by Randulla Khan, general of the Bijapur King. Shortly afterwards, Sir\u00e1 was included in the jagir granted to the Marhatta Shahji, the father of Shivaji the Great. In 1687, on the conquest of the Bijapur kingdom by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, Sir\u00e1 was made the capital of a new Province south of the Tungabhadra, which nominally included the greater part of the modern State of Mysore. The two best known Nawabs or Governors were K\u00e1sim Khan and Dil\u00e1war Khan. Under the latter ruler, the town attained its highest prosperity. The number of houses is said to have been 50,000; there are now only 671. An elegant palace, erected by Dil\u00e1war Khan, now in ruins, furnished the models for the palaces of Bangalore and Seringapatam. In 1757, Sir\u00e1 was taken by the Marhattas, but recovered for the Musalmans by Haidar Ali in 1761. During the great struggle for power in the Karnatic, Sir\u00e1 suffered severely. On one occasion, Tipu transported 12,000 families to form the population of his new town of Ganjam. The finest buildings now standing are the Jam\u00e1 Masjid of hewn stone, and the fort also of stone, with a regular moat and glacis. A large proportion of the inhabitants are Korubars by caste, who manufacture kamblis or coarse blankets to the total value of about \u00a3500 in the year. The price of each blanket varies from 1s. to \u00a31, 4s. Common sealing-wax is also made, but the weaving of chintz is now an extinct industry.\n\nSiraguppa (Siruguppa).\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras. A badly built, unhealthy town, situated on the Tungabhadra river, in lat. 15\u00b0 38' 50\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 56' 30\" E. Pop. (1871), 5501, living in 1514 houses.\n\nSirajganj.\u2014Subdivision of P\u00e1bna District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 0' 45\" and 24\u00b0 45' N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 17' and 89\u00b0 53' E. long. Area, 1031 square miles; villages, 1492; houses, 100,870; pop. (1872), 656,575, of whom 175,488 were Hindus, 478,278 Muhammadans, 35 Christians, and 2754 of other denominations. Proportion of males in total population, 49.9 per cent.; average number of persons per square mile, 637; villages per square mile, 1.45; houses per square mile, 98; persons per village, 440; inmates per house, 6.5. This Subdivision consists of the four police circles of Shahzadpur, Ullapara, Sirajganj, and Rajganj. In 1869, it contained 4 magisterial and revenue courts, a police force of 133 men, and a village watch of 1018 men; the cost of Subdivisional administration was returned at \u00a36380.\n\nSirajganj.\u2014Town in P\u00e1bna District, Bengal, and the most important river mart in the Province; situated near the Jamuna or main stream of the Brahmaputra, in lat. 24\u00b0 26' 58\" N., and long. 89\u00b0 47' 5\" E. Pop. (1872), 18,873, of whom 10,333 were males and 8540 females.\nMunicipal income (1876-77), \u00a3573; incidence of taxation, 6\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. The town consists of 12 streets, and is traversed by the P\u00e1bna and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1ikon\u00e1 roads; it contains only 1 market; there are 4 gh\u00e1ts or landing-places, viz. Ferry gh\u00e1t on the Dh\u00e1nbandi river (which flows through Sir\u00e1jganj), K\u00e1lib\u00e1ri, Rahu\u00e1b\u00e1ri, and the Jute Company's gh\u00e1t in M\u00e1ch\u00edmpur.\n\nThe following description of Sir\u00e1jganj and its river trade is condensed from the Report on the River Trade of Bengal for 1876-77, the facts having been originally supplied by Mr. Nolan, who was for several years Magistrate of the Sir\u00e1jganj Subdivision:\n\nThe town is said to take its name from a local samind\u00e1r, called Sir\u00e1j Al\u00ed, who first opened a b\u00e1z\u00e1r here in the beginning of the present century. It then stood upon the bank of the Jamun\u00e1; but in 1848 an excessive flood of the river washed the entire town away. The traders thereupon retreated some 5 miles backward to the new bank; and when the river, in a fresh caprice, returned to its old channel, they determined to remain where they were, safe from inundation, though at a long distance from their daily place of business. During the rainy season, from June to October, the Jamun\u00e1 comes down in flood, overflowing the waste of sand between the houses and the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and filling the branch stream that passes through the town. For the rest of the year, business is entirely conducted on the permanent bank of the Jamun\u00e1, wherever that may happen to be, for the mighty river sweeps away acres of land and alters its navigable channel every year. Hence it is that Sir\u00e1jganj has been described from the deck of a Brahmaputra steamer as 'a town without houses.' Scarcely a warehouse stands on the river's brink, nor a tree to afford shelter. Large boats and flats lie anchored in mid-stream; fleets of smaller craft take shelter in the natural bends of the river; while the merchants and brokers move to and fro in light dinghis, to conduct their transactions on the spot. The bright head-dresses of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds afford a lively contrast to the white robes of the Beng\u00e1l\u00eds and the riding costumes and pith hats of the Europeans. On the shore, crowds of coolies are busy landing the open 'hanks' of jute, packing them into 'drums,' and again reshaping them for Calcutta. All this is done under the blaze of a tropical sun; and all those engaged have to traverse twice daily the blinding waste of 5 miles of sand that intervenes between their houses and the river.\n\nIn 1877, there were 6 European firms, or branches of firms, established at Sir\u00e1jganj; and also an agency of the Bank of Bengal, which imports specie every year to the amount of about \u00a3500,000, to liquidate the favourable balance of exchange. The principal native merchants are M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds, locally known as K\u00e1yas, who are immigrants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and mostly profess the Jain religion. Their headquarters in Bengal is in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, but their operations extend as far as\nthe eastern corner of Assam. Like their brethren in the Deccan, they are a clannish race, who undertake considerable speculations in reliance upon the good faith of their numerous and distant correspondents. They are described as honest, frugal, and diligent, but quite uneducated. The Beng\u00e1li traders chiefly belong to the caste of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1s. They are very intelligent, but lack enterprise and confidence in one another.\n\nThe business of Sir\u00e1jganj is mainly that of a changing station. The agricultural produce of all the country round is brought in in small boats, either by the cultivators themselves or by petty dealers, and here transferred to the wholesale merchants, for shipment to Calcutta in steamers or large cargo boats. In return, piece-goods, salt, hardware, and all sorts of miscellaneous articles are received from Calcutta for distribution. In 1876-77, the aggregate value of the registered trade of Sir\u00e1jganj, including both exports and imports, amounted to more than 3\u00bd millions sterling; but in this total a great deal is counted twice over. The following are the principal items, in one table or the other:\n\n\u2014Jute, \u00a3606,000; European piece-goods, \u00a3264,000; salt, \u00a3263,000; oil-seeds, \u00a3171,000; oil, \u00a397,000; rice and other grain, \u00a383,000; sugar, \u00a383,000; tobacco, \u00a374,000; gunny bags, \u00a369,000. The larger half of this trade is conducted direct with Calcutta, to which the exports in 1876-77 were valued at \u00a3831,000. Next in importance comes the trade of the surrounding country, and then the supply of rice and general stores to the coolies on the Assam tea-gardens. The relative amount of business done with the neighbouring Districts is shown by the following figures:\u2014Imports from Rangpur, 830,000 maunds of jute, 62,000 maunds of tobacco, and 28,000 maunds of oil-seeds; exports to Rangpur, 167,000 maunds of salt and \u00a318,000 of piece-goods: imports from Maimansinh, 294,000 maunds of jute and 140,000 maunds of mustard seed; exports to Maimansinh, 71,000 maunds of salt and \u00a343,000 of piece-goods: imports from Kuch Behar, 160,000 maunds of jute and 28,000 maunds of tobacco; exports to Kuch Behar, 35,000 maunds of salt: imports from Jalp\u00e1iguri, 44,000 maunds of jute and 40,000 maunds of tobacco; imports from Bogra, 209,000 maunds of jute; imports from Go\u00e1lpara in Assam, 98,000 maunds of jute and 166,000 maunds of mustard seed.\n\nThe export jute trade is conducted entirely with Calcutta, and fluctuates according to the demand in that market. The largest figures were reached in 1872-73, when the local estimate made from the books of the traders was 3,500,000 maunds. In 1876-77, the registered total was 2,021,168 maunds, valued at \u00a3606,330; and in 1877-78, 2,156,307 maunds, being in each year the largest figure for any mart in the interior of Bengal. There are three means of communication with Calcutta, which compete actively with one another\u2014by country boat, by steamer to Go\u00e1landa and thence by Eastern Bengal Railway, and\nby steamer all the way. The two latter modes carry together somewhat more than half the total, and it does not appear that the relative proportions have varied much in recent years. In 1876-77, 993,654 maunds went by boat, 567,673 by rail, and 450,841 by steamer. The time taken by the railway is only two days, as compared with eight or nine days by steamer, and somewhat less than thirty days by boat. Freights, of course, vary; but the railway and the steamers always maintain the same rate with one another. The freight by boat ranges from \u00a31, 19s. to \u00a33, 10s. per 1000 maunds, averaging about 6d. per maund; that by both rail and steamer ranges from 7\u00bdd. to 1s. 4\u00bdd. per maund, averaging about 10\u00bdd. But, as is usual in India, these figures are only nominal, and several reductions require to be made before an exact comparison can be instituted. The boats ship by a local maund of 84\u00b710 lbs., and it has become customary to load a 1000-maund boat with 1100 maunds, or an excess of 10 per cent. The railway uses a maund of exactly 80 lbs., and the steamers one of 82\u00bd lbs. Altogether, making every allowance (inclusive of insurance at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent. on boat cargoes, and the difference of discount between bills drawn at thirty and three days), it has been estimated that the total cost of transmitting 1100 maunds of jute from Sirajganj to Calcutta would average \u00a337, 11s. 6d. by boat, as compared with \u00a348, 6s. 3d. by rail. Despite this advantage in cheapness, the rail is preferred by the smaller traders, who would not be trusted by the insurance office, and could not themselves bear the risk of shipwreck; and it is largely used by all persons in a rising market, when the object is to get the fibre to Calcutta before a fall.\n\nThe Sirajganj Jute Company, which commenced business in 1869, has a large steam factory at the suburb of Machimpur, giving employment to about 1200 men, women, and children. As compared with the numerous mills on the Hugli, it labours under the disadvantage of having to import its coal, which can only be landed near the factory in the rainy season; but besides supplying the local demand, it annually exports large numbers of gunny bags to Calcutta. They are carried by rail at favourable rates, though the coal always comes up by boat. In 1876-77, the export of gunny bags was 3,161,500 in number, valued at \u00a369,550. In the following year the number was 2,950,625. In 1876-77, the import of coal for the use of the mill was 112,600 maunds, valued at \u00a35630.\n\nThe municipal committee have twice taken a boat census of Sirajganj. On 31st August 1873, the number of boats found was 1436, laden with 162,000 maunds of goods, of which nearly three-fifths was jute. On 4th September 1874, 1185 boats were counted, with cargoes aggregating 195,000 maunds. Sirajganj is also a registration station, at which 49,644 boats were counted in the year 1876-77, passing up or down stream\nSirakot.\u2014Ruined fort and temple in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; situated in $29^\\circ 49'$ N. lat., and $80^\\circ 17'$ E. long., 9 miles north-west of the confluence of the Gori and Eastern K\u00e1li rivers. Elevation above sea level, 6924 feet. Crowns a rocky ridge, with two of its sides scarped to a sheer depth of 2000 feet, and having its front terminated by a chasm 700 feet in depth. The narrow path from Almor\u00e1 to Nep\u00e1l winds round one of its flanks. The temple stands upon a conical rock, rising nearly perpendicularly from the ridge covered by the crumbling fortifications. During the G\u00farkh\u00e1 invasion in the early part of the century, the garrison was cut off from their water supply, upon which they surrendered, and the fort has ever since remained in a ruinous condition.\n\nSiralkoppa.\u2014Village in Shimoga District, Mysore. Lat. $14^\\circ 20' 50''$ N., long. $75^\\circ 19' 53''$ E.; pop. (1871), 1661. Important mercantile centre, where the jaggery prepared from sugar-cane in the surrounding country is collected for despatch to the neighbouring Districts of Bombay and Madras. Piece-goods and kamblis are received in exchange. Government distillery. Weekly fair held on Sundays is attended by 1700 persons.\n\nSirasg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar. Lat. $21^\\circ 20'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 45'$ E.; pop. (1867), 5599. The town lands pay a revenue of \u00a31481, being the richest community in the District. Police outpost. Small weekly market.\n\nSirdh\u00e1na.\u2014Town in Meerut (M\u00edrath) District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SARDHANA.\n\nSirguj\u00e1.\u2014Native State in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal.\u2014See SARGUJA.\n\nSirhan.\u2014River in Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab; a tributary of the Indus. Rises at the head of the Bhogarmang glen, in lat. $34^\\circ 46'$ N., long. $73^\\circ 19'$ E., drains the Pakhli valley and the greater part of Tan\u00e1wal, and falls into the Indus at T\u00e1rbel\u00e1 (lat. $34^\\circ 5'$ N., long. $72^\\circ 44'$ E.), after a length of about 80 miles. Great variety of scenery in different parts of its course, from the wild mountain gorges of the upper glens to the broad expanse of irrigated rice-fields in the Pakhli vale, and the low but rugged hills of Tan\u00e1wal. Abounds in fish, especially the mahsir. The Pakhli Sw\u00e1this call the Sirhan their \u2018female slave,\u2019 as it irrigates their fields, grinds their corn, husks their rice, and cleans their cotton. Numerous mills line the bank. Nowhere navigable; fordable almost everywhere, except during floods.\n\nSirhind.\u2014Tract in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab; consisting of the north-eastern portion of the plain which intervenes between the Jumna and the Sutlej rivers. It includes the British Districts of Umballa (Amb\u00e1la), Ludhiana, and Firozpur, together with the Native States of Patiala, Jind, and Nabha, each of which see separately. Sirhind has now no existence as an administrative\ndivision of territory; but in the historical sense, it includes all that portion of the cis-Sutlej tract which lies between the Simla Hills on the north-east, the Jumna valley Districts (Karn\u00e1l and Rohtak) on the east, Hari\u00e1na (Sirsa and Hiss\u00e1r) on the south, and the Sutlej on the north-west; or more roughly speaking, it embraces the level plain between the Him\u00e1layas and the desert of Bikaner, the Sutlej and the Jumna. This tract comprises the whole watershed of the now deserted stream which once formed the great Saraswati (Sarsuti) river; and the projected Sirhind Canal will doubtless once more spread fertility over its somewhat desolate expanse. (For further particulars, see Cis-SUTLEJ STATES.)\n\nSirhind Canal.\u2014An important irrigation work, now in process of construction, in Umballa (Amb\u00e1l\u00e1) and Ludhi\u00e1na Districts, and Pati\u00e1la and N\u00e1bha States, Punjab. The canal will draw its supply from the Sutlej near Rupar, and run through Ludhi\u00e1na and Firozpur Districts. Other branches in connection will traverse Pati\u00e1la and N\u00e1bha, terminating in Sirsa and Karn\u00e1l Districts. It is probable that the canal will not be fully completed for several years. Up to the close of the official year 1876-77, the total expenditure on capital account had been \u00a31,394,875, of which \u00a3521,080 had been contributed by the Native States interested.\n\nS\u00edrm\u00far.\u2014One of the sub-Him\u00e1layan or Hill States, under the Government of the Punjab, frequently called Nah\u00e1n, from the name of the chief town. S\u00edrm\u00far is bounded on the north by the Hill States of Balsan and Jubal; on the east by the British District of the Dehra D\u00fan, from which it is separated by the rivers Tons and Jumna; on the south-west by Umballa (Amb\u00e1l\u00e1) District, and some detached portions of the Native States of Kalsia; and on the north-west by the Native States of Pati\u00e1la and Keunth\u00e1l. It lies between lat. 30\u00b0 24' and 31\u00b0 N., and between long. 77\u00b0 5' and 77\u00b0 50' E.; estimated area, 1000 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 90,000 souls.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Except a very small tract about Nah\u00e1n, on the south-western extremity, where a few streams rise and flow south-westward to the Saraswati (Sarsuti) and Ghaggar rivers, the whole of S\u00edrm\u00far lies in the basin of the Jumna, which receives from this quarter the Giri and its feeders, the Jal\u00e1l and the Pal\u00far. The river Tons, the great western arm of the stream called lower down the Jumna, flows along the eastern boundary of S\u00edrm\u00far, and on its right bank receives from it two small streams, the Minus and the Nairai. The surface of the State generally declines in elevation from north to south; the height of the trigonometrical station on the Chor Mountain on the northern frontier being 11,982 feet, and that of the confluence of the Giri and Jumna on the southern frontier being about 1500 feet above sea level. From that confluence the valley of the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan stretches westward, form-\ning the southern part of Sirmur, and extending about 25 miles in length from east to west, and from 13 to 6 in breadth, terminating to the west at the eastern base of the Nah\u00e1n ridge. Its surface rises gradually to the westward from the Jumna to the Ghatusan Pass, a distance of 14 miles. From Ghatusan, having an elevation of 2500 feet above the sea, the country falls both eastward, as already stated, and westward, the streams in the former direction flowing to the Jumna, and those in the latter to the Markanda and other rivers holding their course to the Saraswat\u00ed and Ghaggar. The Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan is bounded on the south by the Siw\u00e1lik range. These hills are of recent formation, and abound in fossil remains of large vertebrate animals. On the north, the D\u00fan is bounded by the Sub-Him\u00e1layas. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ban, or royal forest, situated in the north-eastern angle of the D\u00fan, yields valuable sali timber. Elephants are occasionally trapped in pits. The pasturage of the D\u00fan is exceedingly rich. The Sain ridge rises to the north-west of the range bounding the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan; on the north, it stretches along the right bank of the river Giri, and has a massive contour, rising at its south-eastern extremity into the summit of Thandu Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed (5700 feet); at its north-western, into that of Sarsu Debi (6299 feet). The formation is limestone, which extends generally to the bed of the Giri, where slate-rock commences. Beyond the Giri, and at the northern extremity of Sirmur, is the remarkable peak of Chor, connected by a transverse ridge with the outer Him\u00e1laya, and itself a central point from which subordinate ranges ramify in every direction. The summit is composed of vast tabular masses of granite, which, though compact, is readily decomposed by the weather. Sirmur, though its rocks consist of formations usually metalliferous, at present yields little mineral wealth. At Kalsi, a copper-mine was formerly worked, but has now been abandoned. A lead-mine has also been opened. Iron-ore is abundant, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 established a foundry some years ago, and has made every endeavour to develop the natural resources of the State. Owing, however, to the difficulties of carriage from the mines, the enterprise has not hitherto proved a financial success. The extensive slate strata are in some places quarried to supply roofing. So dense are the forests that the sportsman finds difficulty in making his way through them in search of wild elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas, with which they abound. Wild pea-fowl are in many places very numerous, being unmolested in consequence of the superstitious regard of the natives.\n\nHistory.\u2014Sirmur, which means \u2018a crowned head,\u2019 was the place of residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s who ruled over the State before the present dynasty entered the country. It is said that the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the ancient line was swept away by a flood; and that Agar Sain R\u00e1wal, of the ruling family of J\u00e1isalm\u00edr, from whom the present chief is descended, being\nat that time in the neighbourhood on a pilgrimage to the Ganges, took possession of the vacant throne. This occurred in 1895 A.D. The descendants of Agar Sain R\u00e1wal have retained the chiefship ever since. In 1803, the country was brought into subjection by the G\u00farkhas, who in turn were expelled in 1815 by the British under Sir David Ochterlony. The R\u00e1jput R\u00e1j\u00e1 was reinstated in his ancient possessions, with the exception of the fort and pargan\u00e1 of M\u00fari, given to the Musalm\u00e1n sard\u00e1r of that place for good service against the enemy; the Khi\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan, which was subsequently, in 1833, restored; a tract of hill country to the north of the river Giri made over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Keunthal; and the pargan\u00e1s of Jaunsar and Bawar in the Dehra D\u00fan, annexed to the British dominions. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Shamsher Prak\u00e1s, K.C.S.I., was born about 1843. He receives a salute of 7 guns, and maintains a small force of drilled sepoys, numbering 100 cavalry, 530 infantry, with 10 field guns, and 20 artillerymen. The relations of the chief with the British Government are defined in a sanad, dated 21st September 1815, under which he is required to consult the Superintendent of the Hill States in all matters connected with the management of the State, and to furnish a contingent to the British forces when called on. Sentences of death require the confirmation of the Superintendent and the Commissioner of Umballa (Amb\u00e1la), but all other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own authority.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014The population of S\u00edrm\u00far was estimated in 1875 at 90,000, and the gross revenue at \u00a321,000. No tribute is paid. The principal products are opium and several kinds of grain. The houses are generally three storeys high; built of stone, boarded with timber, of which there is great abundance, as fine forests of fir, oak, rhododendron, horse-chestnut, and other trees overspread the mountains. The roofs are generally of slate, but sometimes of shingle. The family inhabits the upper storey, which is surrounded by an enclosed balcony projecting 6 or 8 feet beyond the wall. The villages, usually situated on the slopes or tops of hills, have a picturesque and pleasing effect in the landscape. The natives of S\u00edrm\u00far are of the Aryan type, and obviously of a race allied to the Hindus of the plains; towards the northeast, there is an admixture of the Mongolian stock. Goitre is very prevalent amongst all classes. The dress of the middle classes consists of a simple tunic or frock reaching down to the knees, trousers, and a scarf usually worn across the shoulders, but when the sun is hot, thrown over the head; the lower orders content themselves with a blanket girt round the waist; the higher ranks dress after the fashion of Hindust\u00e1n, and wear the Sikh turban. Polyandry is common, if not universal, several brothers often cohabiting with the same woman. The religion prevailing in S\u00edrm\u00far is mainly Br\u00e1hmanism; to which is added the superstitious adoration and dread of innumerable local\ndivinities, with which the imagination of the natives has peopled every hill, and valley, and grove. The lives of kine are sacred. The people are divided into castes as in the plains, and Br\u00e1hmans abound. The most important tribe in the hills is named Kanet, the members of which form about 60 per cent. of the whole population of the State. Kanets are Hindus, and probably of true Aryan descent. They are popularly supposed to be degenerate R\u00e1jputs, who have fallen from their high estate in consequence of the custom which prevails amongst them of purchasing their wives and allowing the marriage of widows. The language is a dialect of Hindi.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of S\u00edrm\u00far varies with the elevation\u2014from that of the Chor, where the surface of the ground is under snow the greater part of the year, to the stifling malaria of the low-lying Khi\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan. In shape, the Khi\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan resembles a deep narrow trench shut in by high walls on every side, except towards the east, where it opens to the Jumna; it has a deep alluvial swampy soil, teeming with rank vegetation; and its climate consequently is peculiarly hot and oppressive, and the air so charged with noxious vapours as to be generally fatal to human life. The greater part of the D\u00fan is mere desert or jungle, untrodden by man, except by a few woodcutters, or by the collectors of gum catechu, which is yielded in great abundance by the Mimosa.\n\nSirohi.\u2014A Native State in the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Agency under the Government of India, lying between lat. 24\u00b0 22' and 25\u00b0 16' N., and between long. 72\u00b0 22' and 73\u00b0 18' E. Estimated area, 3000 square miles; estimated population (1875), 153,000. Sirohi is bounded on the north by M\u00e1rw\u00e1r or Jodhpur, on the east by Mew\u00e1r or Ud\u00e1ipur, on the south by P\u00e1lanpur and the Mahi K\u00e1ntha States of Edar and Danta, and on the west by Jodhpur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The country is much intersected and broken up by hills and rocky ranges. The main feature is Mount Abu, the highest peak of which rises 5653 feet above the sea; it is situated at the extremity of the Aravalli Mountain chain, being partially separated from the main range by a narrow valley. That range, running from south-west to north-east, divides the State into two not very unequal portions. The western half is comparatively open and level, and more populous and better cultivated than the other. Both portions, being situated at the foot of the hill range, are intersected by numerous water-courses or n\u00e1ld\u00e1s, which become torrents of greater or less volume in the rainy season, but are dry during the remainder of the year. From the line of water-parting the streams discharge into the rivers Loni and Ban\u00e1s. The lower slopes of the Aravalli range in Sirohi are clothed with dense forest, and the country generally is dotted with low rocky hills, which, as a rule, are thickly covered with jungle, consisting chiefly\nof the *dhao* tree (Anogeissus pendula) mixed with *khayer* (Acacia catechu), *babul* (Acacia arabica), *ber* (Zizyphus jujuba), and Euphorbia. The only river of any importance is the Western Ban\u00e1s. Within the limits of the State this river is not perennial; it usually ceases to flow as the hot season commences, and only heavy pools are then to be found. It is subject, during the rains, to occasional floods, but these rapidly subside, leaving the stream fordable and the water clear and good. The Ban\u00e1s, rising in the Aravalli Hills, flows through the State into Guzerat, and after passing the cantonment of D\u00edsa, is finally lost in the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh). There are remains of many fine artificial lakes in Sirohi, but no lakes or *jhils* at present exist, with the exception of the Nakhi Tal\u00e1o on Mount Abu. The nature of the sub-soil of Sirohi appears, as a rule, to be unsuited to the artificial storage of water, for in the village tanks the water generally subsides very rapidly after the end of the rainy season. The depth at which water is found below the surface varies a good deal in different parts of the State. Thus, in the north-east, the wells are from 90 to 100 feet deep, and the water is generally brackish. In the north-west, water is more easily found, at from 70 to 90 feet; while in the eastern Districts, water of good quality is found at depths varying from 15 to 60 feet, the depth required to be sunk decreasing towards the south. In the western Districts, the depth of the wells is generally 60 to 70 feet; and at Sirohi town, and in its neighbourhood, water is often scarce and of inferior quality. The geological formation of the Aravalli range is granite overlying blue slate. The valleys exhibit variegated quartz and schistose slate. Rocks of gneiss and syenite appear at intervals. At the south-east corner of Sirohi, the Aravalli range takes a sweep to the south-west, enclosing a hilly tract called the *bhakar*. In this tract, the rocks are primitive and metamorphic, with schists and limestone. Mica is found in large quantities. Near the village of Jariw\u00e1o, on the south-eastern frontier of the State, are the marble quarries of that name, from which the celebrated Jain temples of Abu are said to have been built. The granite of Abu is used to a considerable extent for building, and the blue slate which underlies the granite is well adapted for paving and other purposes. It is said that a copper-mine was formerly worked in the hilly range above the town of Sirohi.\n\nAlthough a considerable portion of Sirohi is covered with tree and bush jungle, the forests, strictly speaking, may be considered as confined to the slopes of Abu and the belt of forest round its base. In the *bhakar*, there are here and there hills and valleys well wooded with valuable timber, such as the *timru* (ebony), *dhaman siris*, *huldru*, the large *dhao*, and others. On the slopes of Abu a great variety of trees and shrubs are found. The most common are the bamboo, mango, *siris*, *dhao* of various kinds, *j\u00e1mun*, *kachnar*, etc. Tigers are\nnumerous, and destroy a great number of cattle. Bears and leopards are common. Both sambhar and chital deer were also numerous, till the great famine of 1868-69, during which numbers of them either died, or were killed by the Bhils for food. Antelopes are scarce, but chikara and the four-horned deer are to be found in parts of the country. Field rats are abundant in the sandy portions of the State. Hares are very common. The grey partridge abounds, the painted and black partridge are rare. Quails of several kinds and sand grouse are everywhere met with. Florican visit the country for a short time during the rains. Jungle and spur fowl are found in the hilly parts of the State. The fish are few and almost entirely confined to the Ban\u00e1s river, and are chiefly the rohu, murrel, pari, and chilwa.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present ruling family of Sirohi are Deora R\u00e1jputs, a branch of the great Chauh\u00e1n clan, and are said to be immediately descended from Deo R\u00e1j, a descendant of Prithwi R\u00e1j, the Chauh\u00e1n King of Delhi. The earliest known inhabitants of Sirohi were the Bhils. The first R\u00e1jputs to settle in the country were the Gehlots. They were soon followed by the Pramara R\u00e1jputs, who appear to have been a powerful race, and to have had their capital at Chandrawati. The ruins of this place prove it to have been at one time a large and flourishing city. The Pramaras were succeeded by the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, who seem to have first established themselves in the country about 1152 A.D., but who only dispossessed the Pramaras after a long series of years and much fighting. The Pramaras are said to have taken up their last refuge on Mount Abu, where remains of extensive fortifications are still to be seen. Being unable to drive them from their stronghold, the Deora Chauh\u00e1ns had recourse to stratagem. They sent a proposal that the Pramaras should bring twelve of their daughters to be married into the Chauh\u00e1n tribe, and thus establish a friendship. The proposal being accepted, the story runs that the twelve girls were accompanied to Bhadeli, a village near the southern border of Sirohi, by nearly all the Pramaras. The Chauh\u00e1ns then fell upon them, massacred the majority, and pursuing the survivors back to Abu, gained possession of that place. It is said that the descendants of Pramaras now inhabit Abu, and, in memory of this act of treachery, never allow their daughters to go down to the plains to be married. During the reign of Sains Mall (about 1425 A.D.), the R\u00e1n\u00e1 Kambaji of Chittor obtained permission to take refuge at Achilgarh on Mount Abu, when flying from the Mughal Emperor. On the retreat of the imperial army, the son of Sains Mall sent word to the R\u00e1n\u00e1 to return to his own country; but the latter, having found what a strong position Abu was, refused to leave, and had eventually to be driven out by force. In consequence of this, no other R\u00e1j\u00e1 was ever allowed to go up to Abu; and this custom\nremained in force till 1836, when, through the intervention of Colonel Spiers (at that time in political charge at Sirohi), Mah\u00e1r\u00e1na Jaw\u00e1n Sinh of Ud\u00e1ipur was permitted to proceed to Abu on a pilgrimage to the Abu temples. Since then the prohibition has been withdrawn, and many chiefs of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na have visited Abu. During the early years of the present century, the State of Sirohi suffered much from wars with Jodhpur, and the constant marauding of the wild Min\u00e1 tribes. The State became too weak to protect its subjects; hence many of the Th\u00e1kurs in the south threw off their allegiance, and placed themselves under the protection of P\u00e1lanpur; and the Sirohi State was nigh being dismembered. Under these circumstances, in 1817, R\u00e1o Sheo Sinh, then Regent, sought the protection of the British Government. Captain Tod was at that time the Political Agent in Western R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; and after making close inquiry into the history and relations of the two States, he disallowed the pretensions of Jodhpur to suzerainty over Sirohi. In 1823, a treaty was finally concluded between the British Government and the Sirohi State. Many of the Th\u00e1kurs were in rebellion, supported by the wild Min\u00e1s of the hills; but they were eventually reduced to submission. R\u00e1o Sheo Sinh did good service during the Mutiny of 1857, in consideration of which he received a remission of half his tribute, which is now fixed at \u00a3688. The R\u00e1o of Sirohi in 1845 made over to the British Government some lands on Mount Abu, for the establishment of a sanatorium. The present R\u00e1o is named Kesari Sinh; he is entitled to a salute of 15 guns, and holds a sanad giving rights of adoption.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Sirohi is estimated by the Darb\u00e1r to number 153,000, of whom 133,000, or about 86 per cent., are Hindus; 1500, or nearly 1 per cent., Muhammadans; and 18,500, or 12 per cent., Jains. There are a considerable number of Br\u00e1hmans and religious mendicants in the State. The Baniyas and Mah\u00e1jans form a very numerous class; they are mostly Oswals and Porewals, followers of the Jain religion. The R\u00e1jputs are divided into twelve different clans, or septs of clans, in Sirohi. They are the dominant race, although not numerically the largest class. The greater portion are Deora Chauh\u00e1ns; next in order come the Sesodia and Rahtor clans, who are about equal in number. R\u00e1jputs, who are not j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs or the immediate relatives of j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, gain their living as State servants, soldiers, and cultivators; they belong to the diwali band, or protectors of the villages, and cultivate free of land tax. Kalbis, Rabaris, and Dhers are also numerous. Aboriginal tribes and tribes of the half-blood,\u2014Bhils, Grassias, and Min\u00e1s,\u2014taken together, form a considerable section of the population. The Grassias are principally confined to the bhakar or hilly tract in the south-east corner of Sirohi. They were formerly great plunderers, but have now settled down to agriculture. They are said to be the descend-\nants of R\u00e1jputs, married to Bh\u00edl women. Min\u00e1s and Bhils have always been troublesome races, with a hereditary taste for plundering. Speaking generally, the Min\u00e1s may be said to occupy the north, and the Bhils the western part of Sirohi. There are some Kolis who are believed to have immigrated from Guzerat. They have now settled down as cultivators, and are principally found in the eastern and southern Districts. The Musalm\u00e1ns mostly consist of taksild\u00e1rs and sepoys, and a few colonies of Cutch (Kachchh) Bohras at Madar and Sirohi. The language of Sirohi is a patois of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri and Guzer\u00e1ti.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The principal spring crops (r\u00e1b\u00ed) are wheat, barley, gram, and mustard (Sinapis dichotoma), from which a kind of oil is prepared, much used by the people. Wheat and barley are the staple crops; on these being reaped, many of the fields are at once ploughed up and sown with two kinds of small grain called kar\u00e1ng and chaina, which come to maturity very quickly, and are cut before the rains set in. Manure is used every second or third year; but no rotation of crops is practised, the same land being sown with wheat or barley year after year. The chief rain-crops (khart\u00edf) are Indian corn, b\u00e1jira, mung, moth, arad, kulath, and g\u00faar. Cotton and ambar\u00ed or san (a kind of hemp) are grown in small quantities for local consumption. Til, kuri basthi, kudra, mal, and sainwalai are only grown in walar cultivation, i.e. by cutting down and burning the jungle on the hillsides, and sowing the seed in the ashes. This mode of cultivation is very popular with the Grassias, Bhils, and Min\u00e1s, and has proved most destructive to the Aravalli forests. There is so much uncultivated land in the State that the grazing grounds are very extensive.\n\nThe agricultural tenures in Sirohi correspond with those generally prevailing throughout R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1. The ruler is the actual and sole owner of the land conquered by his ancestors. Those that came with him were granted portions of the conquered territory, on certain conditions of fealty and military service, and became his umras or nobles; but the ruler still retained the ownership or bh\u00fam of the land. To this there are of course exceptions; and the Grassias, the original inhabitants of the bhakar, still retain their bh\u00fam rights. The cultivators generally are hereditary tenants, and cannot be ejected so long as they pay the revenue regularly; in fact, in such a sparsely populated country as Sirohi, the cultivator is too valuable to be parted with. There is a large class in Sirohi called the diwali band, consisting of R\u00e1jputs, Bhils, Min\u00e1s, and Kolis, who cultivate land rent-free. The safety of the village is in their hands, and they are bound to protect it. Br\u00e1hmans, Charans, and Bhats also cultivate their land free. In all the j\u00e1gir estates, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 receives a portion of the land revenue and local taxes. The rates of assessment vary in different Districts; but\ngenerally in the principal estates R\u00e1jputs pay three-eighths of the produce, and in others one-half.\n\n**Education, Communications, etc.**\u2014Education is but little sought after. There are vernacular schools at the three principal towns, Sirohi, Rohera, and Madar. In many of the villages, boys of the Baniya class are taught to write and keep accounts by the village *jatti*. A dispensary is supported by the State at Sirohi. There are post offices at Erinpura, Sirohi, Anadra, and Abu. Abu has also a telegraph office. The main road through the State is that from Ajmere, through M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Sirohi, P\u00e1lanpur, and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's territory, to Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d. This road enters Sirohi at Erinpura; and passing through the capital and along the western side of Abu, leaves the State again about 2 miles south of Madar, which is about 26 miles from the cantonment of D\u00eds\u00e1. The Western R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Railway, constructed on the metre gauge, between Ajmere and P\u00e1lanpur, which runs through the length of this State, passes just east of Mount Abu, and was opened in December 1880. There is a jail at Sirohi. Criminal suits are tried by the minister at the capital, and by *tahsild\u00e1rs* at the headquarters of Districts. There are no other courts in Sirohi; all civil suits are settled by *panch\u00e1yats*, or village assemblies. The military force of the State consists of 2 guns, 74 cavalry, and 260 foot-soldiers.\n\n**Medical Aspects.**\u2014The climate of Sirohi is, on the whole, dry and healthy; and there is a general freedom from epidemic diseases, which is doubtless in a measure due to the sparseness of the population. The heat is never so intense as in the North-Western Provinces or the Punjab; but on the other hand, the cold season is of much shorter duration, and less bracing. In the southern and eastern Districts, there is usually a fair amount of rain; but over the rest of the State, the rainfall is frequently scant. This is chiefly due to Mount Abu and the Aravalli Hills attracting the clouds driven inland by the south-west monsoon; thus at Abu the average annual rainfall is about 64 inches, while at Erinpura, less than 50 miles distant in a northerly direction, the average fall is only between 12 and 15 inches. The prevailing wind is south-westerly. The principal diseases are malarious fever and ague, complicated with enlargement of the spleen. Dysentery often occurs at the close of the rains, and during the early part of the cold season, especially in the jungle tracts round the base of Abu.\n\n**Sirohi.**\u2014Capital of the Native State of the same name, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 53' 12\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 54' 28\" E.\n\n**Siro.**\u2014Western suburb of Benares City.\u2014See Sikrol.\n\n**Sironcha** (*Sinroncha*).\u2014Administrative headquarters of the Upper God\u00e1vari District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 18\u00b0 51' N., and long. 80\u00b0 1' E., on the left bank of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1 river, 2 miles above its confluence with the God\u00e1vari, and 120 miles south-south-east\nof Ch\u00e1nda. Pop. (1872), 1145. The public buildings and European officers' houses stand on a ridge formerly covered with dense jungle, which slopes gradually northwards down to the village. The summit commands a fine view of the Pranh\u00edt\u00e1, where it winds round a high bluff of sandstone, crowned by a ruined fort, built 160 years ago by direction of W\u00e1li Haidar, a holy man, whose tomb within is held sacred. Sironch\u00e1 has no manufactures, and little trade, except in articles of local consumption. The town contains English and Telugu schools. The soil is sandy, and the drainage good.\n\nSironj.\u2014Town in Bhop\u00e1l, Central India; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 6' 23\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 43' 30\" E., 78 miles north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor), and 140 north-east of Ujjain. Sironj is built at the foot of a pass connecting M\u00e1lw\u00e1 with the tableland to the north. It was once a large town, famed for its muslins and chintzes, but is now much decayed. One fine b\u00e1z\u00e1r still remains, and there are many mosques. Good water is abundant. 'Sironj, with the appertaining pargan\u00e1,' writes Thornton, 'was in 1798 granted to Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n by Jaswant R\u00e1o Holkar; in 1809, the threatening attitude assumed towards N\u00e1gpur by Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n led to the advance upon Sironj of a British force under Colonel Close; subsequently, in 1817, this town and District, with other territories, were guaranteed by the British Government to the Am\u00edr.'\n\nS\u00edrpur.\u2014Chief town of a pargan\u00e1 of the same name in Basim District, Berar. Lat. 20\u00b0 10' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 1' E.; pop. (1867), 3555. Here is the shrine of Antaraksh P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th, one of the most sacred resorts of the Jains. The tradition is, that Yelluk, a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ellichpur, found the idol on the banks of a river, and his prayers for permission to transport it to his own city were granted on condition of his not looking back. At S\u00edrpur, however, his faith became weak, and he looked back. The idol instantly became immovable, and it thus remained suspended in mid-air for many years. Here still exists a small but ancient Jain temple or shrine, having a covered roof with pendants richly carved. S\u00edrpur has a school, and is a police station.\n\nS\u00edrsa.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 13' and 30\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 57' and 75\u00b0 23' E. long. Area, according to the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879, 3121 square miles; population in 1868, 210,795 souls. S\u00edrsa is a District of the Hiss\u00e1r Division. It is bounded on the northeast by the District of Firozpur and the Native State of Pati\u00e1la, on the west by the river Sutlej (Satlaj), on the south-west by the Native States of Bah\u00e1walpur and Bikaner (Bickaneer), and on the east by the District of Hiss\u00e1r. The administrative headquarters are at the town of S\u00cdRSA.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of S\u00edrsa is intermediate, both in geographical position and in physical features, between the barren\ndeserts of Bikaner and the sandy but cultivated plains of the cis-Sutlej States. It forms for the most part a bare and treeless plateau, stretching from the valley of the little river Ghaggar on the east to the main stream of the Sutlej on its western border. Near the village tanks, a few straggling bushes may be seen, but, as a rule, the monotony of the view is rarely broken by any larger vegetation. In the immediate neighbourhood of the Sutlej, however, is a fertile alluvial tract (kh\u00e1dar), intersected by numerous branches of the river, and flooded by their overflow during the rainy season. The surrounding tracts, rising by an abrupt bank from this favoured region, are irrigated for the autumn crops by means of temporary wells. Eastward of the kh\u00e1dar lies the sandy central tableland, which is chiefly employed for purposes of pasturage. Formerly the District was covered by an excellent grazing grass, known as dh\u00e1man; but this is now rapidly disappearing with the increase of cultivation and consequent necessity for closer grazing, as the cattle eat down the heads before they have time to seed. Tradition asserts that the country was once watered by streams from the Umballa (Amb\u00e1la) Hills, whose dry channels may still be seen; and the discovery of buried wells and Persian wheels embedded in the sand bears out the local belief. It is supposed that the water has been diverted by ill-constructed irrigation dams, which checked its course through the dead level of the Karn\u00e1l and Pati\u00e1la plains; while the deposit of silt thus caused has prevented it from pushing its way in future across the barriers, stopping its natural channels. East of this central plateau lies the valley of the Ghaggar, a formidable torrent in the rainy months, but so entirely dependent on the rainfall of the lower Him\u00e1layas that it is usually dry from October to July. During the cold season, its deserted bed is occupied by rich crops of rice and wheat. The Ghaggar expands into three considerable jh\u00edls or marshy lakes, the largest of which is 5 miles in length by 2 in breadth; but only one of them contains water during the whole year. Southward of the Ghaggar, again, spreads a barren sandy tract, beyond the reach of its fertilizing inundations, and of small agricultural value. Viewed as a whole, the District of Sirsa is one which lay desert and abandoned until the British occupation; and although colonization has since proceeded rapidly, bringing most of the soil into a state of comparative cultivation, it is only in the valley of the Sutlej that rich crops and valuable pasturage are to be found.\n\nHistory.\u2014As Sirsa formed a part of the Bhatti\u00e1na territory, its early history is identical with that of HISSAR DISTRICT. The old town, whose ruins lie near the present headquarters station, is said to have been founded thirteen centuries since, and to have been depopulated by the famine of 1726. It makes a few fitful appearances in the Musalm\u00e1n chronicles, where it is mentioned as a place of some wealth and\nimportance. But when the District was first conquered by the British in 1803, it was found almost entirely uninhabited. The Bhatts were lords of the soil, but they tilled little or none of the country, and only used it as a site for their scattered forts, from which bands of marauders made occasional raids into the surrounding regions. Sirsa was officially included in the territory conquered from the Marhatt\u00e1s in 1803, but the Bhatts remained practically in undisturbed possession until 1818. Meanwhile, the Sikh R\u00e1j\u00e1s, taking advantage of the British neglect and the waste condition of the soil, began a series of irregular colonizations, which continued uninterrupted till the year 1837. The British Government then asserted its supremacy, and the District was attached to the North-Western Provinces. The stream of immigration was not checked by this resumption, so long as any portion of the land remained unoccupied; and every inducement was offered by the landowners to immigrant cultivators who settled on their demesnes. Additions were made to the territory by other resumptions from encroaching Native States, in 1844, 1847, and 1855. Shortly after the first organization of the District in 1837, a fiscal settlement of the pargands then composing it was undertaken, and remained in force until 1852, when a new general settlement was effected. This was interrupted by the Mutiny of 1857, a detailed account of which will be found in the article on Hissar District. After the suppression of the Mutiny, Sirsa became a portion of the Punjab Lieutenant-Governorship; and the settlement was continued and completed in 1862 under orders from that government. Only at the latter date can the colonization be considered as final; but the whole area was then parcelled out into estates, and every acre has now its owner. Since the British occupation, the towns have grown to a considerable size; and the modern station of Sirsa, founded by the Superintendent of Bhatti\u00e1na in 1837, has now a population of 11,000 persons, with a thriving trade in grain and sugar.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No accurate statistics exist with reference to the number of inhabitants earlier than the Census of 1868; but in 1862, the Settlement Report estimated the population of Sirsa as 151,877. In 1868, the Census returned the total population at 210,795; showing an increase for the seven years of 58,918 persons, or 38\u00b781 per cent. Taking into account the continuous immigration from the Sikh States, this high rate of increase cannot be far from the truth. In 1868, the above-mentioned population of 210,795 persons was returned as inhabiting 658 villages or townships and 43,131 houses. These results show the following averages, taking the area as it was then calculated, namely 3115 square miles; persons per square mile, 68; villages or townships per square mile, 0\u00b721; persons per village or township, 320\u00b735; houses per square mile, 13\u00b784; persons\nper house, 4\u00b788. From these figures it will be seen that the District is still very sparsely populated. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 117,052; females, 93,743; proportion of males, 55\u00b753 per cent. The preponderance of males over females is greatest amongst the Sikhs, and least amongst the 'others' of the religious enumeration. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years \u2014 males, 41,129; females, 35,822; total, 76,951, or 36\u00b750 per cent. of the whole population: above 12 years\u2014males, 75,923; females, 57,921; total, 133,844, or 63\u00b750 per cent. of the whole population. As regards religious distinctions, the Muhammadan element musters strongest, the followers of Isl\u00e1m being returned at 82,120, or 38\u00b796 per cent. of the inhabitants. Next come the Hindus, with 76,965, or 36\u00b751 per cent. The Sikhs number 21,525, or 10\u00b721 per cent.; while the remaining sects, classed together as 'others' in the Census Report, form an aggregate of 30,805 persons, or 14\u00b732 per cent. The ethnical division of the inhabitants shows the J\u00e1ts as the leading tribe, with a total of 51,476 persons. They are the best cultivators in the District, and are to be found everywhere throughout Sirsa, except in the fertile valley of the Sutlej. In religion they are chiefly Sikhs, and by origin they are colonists from the Sikh States. The R\u00e1jputs rank next in numerical order, being returned at 11,074 persons, amongst whom the Bhattis, once the dominant race, are still the leading clan. Like other predatory races, the Bhattis have sunk in the social scale since the British occupation, as their lazy and improvident habits unfit them for an industrial r\u00e9gime. Their chief occupation is that of graziers, with which they combine, when practicable, their hereditary practice of cattle-lifting. The mercantile classes are represented by 7819 Baniy\u00e1s and 4461 Aroras. The Sutlej valley, the richest portion of Sirsa, is held by two Muhammadan tribes, the Wattus and the Kharals, who are apparently of R\u00e1jput origin, and who number respectively 6642 and 3499. The Br\u00e1hmans are a small body, returned at only 2011 persons in all, scattered amongst the J\u00e1t villages, and generally engaged in agriculture. There were 5 towns in 1868 with a population exceeding 2000, namely\u2014Sirsa, 11,000; Rania, 4583; Ellenabad, 3414; Faizlka, 3406; and Rori, 2706. The occupation returns are as follows:\u2014Agriculturists, 148,856; non-agriculturists, 61,939. The dialects in common use are Urdu, Panjabi, B\u00e1gr\u00ed, and Bhatti.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Scarcely one-eighth of the cultivable area in Sirsa has yet been brought under tillage; but a large portion of the soil is devoted to grazing. The staple product is b\u00e1jra, which occupied 489,076 acres in 1872-73. The other principal crops were\u2014moth, 142,448 acres; jodr, 93,888 acres; and tl, 45,630 acres. These all belong to the autumn or khar\u00edf harvest, which is generally successful; but the spring or rabi crops are very precarious, owing to the capriciousness of the rainfall, and they\nnot infrequently fail altogether. In 1872-73, they occupied the following areas:\u2014Barley, 55,315 acres; gram, 36,941 acres; and wheat, 33,480 acres. Wheat is grown in the Sutlej and Ghaggar valleys, and rice for local consumption is produced in the same neighbourhood. The average out-turn per acre for the various crops is as follows:\u2014Rice, 668 lbs.; cotton, 82 lbs.; wheat, 365 lbs.; inferior food grains, 325 lbs. Irrigation is only slightly practised, and the District is almost entirely dependent on the rainfall. A good season secures a fair supply of coarse grains and abundant pasturage for the cattle; but in a dry year, the whole country becomes an arid and desolate waste. Sirsa was formerly famous for its live-stock, which are still reared in large numbers; but with the extension of cultivation, encroachments have been made upon the pasturage, and the closer grazing thus induced has proved very destructive to the dh\u00e1man grass, from which the breed is supposed to have derived its good qualities. The peasantry are deeply in debt to the village shopkeepers, and the rates of interest are high. The material condition of the people is far from comfortable; some tribes live in huts which are mere sheds of grass and reeds, while even the more prosperous are content with flat-roofed mud cottages. The position of the tenants, however, is favourable, as the original owners of the soil, in their anxiety to secure cultivators from among the immigrant colonists, have granted very easy terms to settlers. Rents are returned as follows, in accordance with the nature of the crop for which the land is suitable:\u2014Sugar, \u00a33 per acre; wheat, \u00a31, 3s. per acre; other grains, 10s. 6d. per acre irrigated, 1s. 3d. per acre unirrigated. Wages are reported to have risen 50 per cent. during the last ten years. In towns they range from 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd annas (2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bcd.) per diem. Agricultural wages are invariably paid in grain. The prices of food grains ruled as follows in 1873:\u2014B\u00e1jra, 37 sers per rupee, or 3s. 0\u00bcd. per cwt.; barley, 1 maund per rupee, or 2s. 8\u00bcd. per cwt.; wheat, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10\u00bcd. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014As Sirsa is entirely dependent for its harvests upon the scanty rainfall, it is peculiarly liable to famine. Even in the most plentiful years, the local food supply is insufficient for home consumption, and grain has to be imported from the east. As the ordinary crop is thus deficient, no reserve can be kept for seasons of scarcity. Sirsa accordingly suffered much during the disastrous seasons of 1868 and 1869. In October 1868, it was necessary to open poorhouses; and during January 1869, relief was afforded to 40,715 persons. The spring crop proved a total loss, and the distress continued throughout the year. Rain fell in September, in time to save the autumn harvest; but it was not till the beginning of 1870 that relief measures could be brought to an end. In January 1869, b\u00e1jra was quoted at 10 sers per rupee, or 1s. 2d. per cwt.\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The District has little trade, except in agricultural produce, which goes chiefly to Bikaner (Bickaneer). Wool and mustard seed are exported to Karachi; while grain, cotton, European piece-goods, and hardware are imported from the east. The town of Sirsa is the main entrep\u00f4t for the local trade, and also for the through traffic with Bikaner. A great cattle fair is held there in August and September, and attended by purchasers from the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces. About 150,000 head of cattle from the District itself and the adjoining Native States are exposed for sale; and the concourse of people is estimated at 50,000. Fazilka, on the Sutlej, is also a mart of rising importance, its position on the river enabling it to establish a direct traffic with the sea-coast, and to supersede Firozpur as an emporium for the commerce of the Sutlej. The only manufacture of any importance is that of saji, an impure carbonate of soda, used in washing and dyeing cloth. It is obtained by burning a plant of the same name, which contains large quantities of alkali. The District has no railways or telegraphs, and the navigation on the Sutlej is confined to the Fazilka traders. The principal road is that from Sirsa to Fazilka, with a branch to Firozpur. The other large towns are also connected by good roads.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with an Assistant and extra-Assistant, besides 3 tahsildars and their deputies. In 1872-73, the total revenue amounted to \u00a327,227, of which \u00a323,653 was derived from the land tax. The rate per acre of the land revenue is lighter than in any other part of the Punjab. For police purposes, the District is divided into 7 police circles (thanas). In 1873, the regular police numbered 306 men of all ranks, besides a municipal force of 66 constables and 5 ferry watchmen. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 381 men, being 1 policeman for every 8\u00b717 square miles of area and for every 553 of the population. The total number of persons brought to trial in 1872 was 1167, or 1 in every 180 inhabitants. The District jail is at Sirsa, and the total number of inmates in 1872 was 692, while the daily average was 270. The cost per prisoner was \u00a33, 19s. 11\u00bdd., and the average earnings of each labouring convict were \u00a31, 6s. 11\u00bdd. Education is still very backward, as might naturally be expected in a District so recently occupied and so thinly populated. In 1872-73, there were 54 schools in Sirsa, most of them unaided, and the total number of pupils on the rolls was 1273. The amount expended upon education from public funds in the same year was \u00a3248. Sirsa is divided into 3 tahsilis and 8 pargans, containing 611 villages, owned by 6064 shareholders. There are two municipalities, at Sirsa and Fazilka, and a municipal revenue is also raised in the three other largest towns. Their aggregate income amounted in\n1871-72 to \u00a32938, being at the rate of 2s. 4\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sirsa is extremely dry. The annual rainfall for the six years preceding 1873 was as follows:\u20141867-68, 16\u00b72 inches; 1868-69 (the year of scarcity), 9\u00b72 inches; 1869-70, 13 inches; 1870-71, 13\u00b73 inches; 1871-72, 11 inches; and 1872-73, 18\u00b72 inches. The principal disease is fever, to which about three-fourths of all the deaths are assigned; but small-pox, cholera, and bowel complaints are also prevalent. The total number of deaths reported in 1872 was 4532, or 21 per thousand of the population; of which 3191 cases, or 15\u00b714 per thousand, were assigned to fever alone. There are 3 charitable dispensaries in the District, the total number of patients relieved at which amounted to 4728 in 1872.\n\nSirsa.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Sirsa District, Punjab; consisting chiefly of a dry and sandy plain. Pop. (1868), 86,305, or 83\u00b793 per square mile.\n\nSirsa.\u2014Municipal town and administrative headquarters of Sirsa District, Punjab. Pop. (1868), 11,000, consisting of 6429 Hindus, 3072 Muhammadans, 97 Sikhs, 24 Christians, and 1378 'others.' Situated on the north side of a dry bed of the Ghaggar, in lat. 29\u00b0 32' 20\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 7' E. The modern town, founded in 1837 by Major Thoresby, Superintendent of Bhattiana, occupies a square site within a mud wall 8 feet high, and consists of wide straight streets running at right angles, without any of those narrow winding lanes which usually occur in oriental towns. Major Thoresby desired to create a centre for local trade, with which object he invited traders from Hansi, Hissar, and the neighbouring towns of Bikaner (Bickaneer) and Patiala. Great success attended his efforts, and the town grew rapidly in population and wealth. The ruins of old Sirsa lie near the south-west corner of the modern station, and still present considerable remains, though much of the material has been used for building the new houses. Tradition ascribes its origin to an eponymic Raj\u00e1 Saras, who built the town and fort about 1300 years ago. The historian of Firoz Tughlak mentions it under the name of Sarsuti, and it would then appear to have been a place of wealth and importance. Nothing is known of its later history, but its depopulation is attributed to the great famine of 1726. The modern town is an entrep\u00f4t for the trade of the wheat-growing countries to the north and east with Bikaner (Bickaneer) and Marwar. Grain of all kinds from Ludhiana, Umballa (Ambala), and Patiala, and sugar from the neighbourhood of Shamli, form the chief items of export. Salt and millets are the staples of the return traffic. The total value of the local trade is estimated at \u00a380,000 a year. Manufacture of coarse cloth and pottery. Court-house and treasury, custom-house, police station, tahsil, jail, staging bungalow,\ns\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ed (native inn), Government charitable dispensary, 2 schools. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a31585, or 2s. 5\u00bdd. per head of population (12,796) within municipal limits.\n\nSirsi.\u2014Chief town of the Sirsi Subdivision of North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 36' N., and long. 74\u00b0 54' E., 320 miles south-east of Bombay, and about 40 miles south-east of the port of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, 2500 feet above sea level. The ground on which the town stands consists of quartz and gravel, the highest points of which are covered by a bed of laterite, while in the ravines on the western and northern sides there is micaceous schist broken through by diorite. Sirsi is a municipal town, with a population (1872) of 5285, and a municipal revenue of \u00a3619. Every second year, a fair is held here in honour of the deity Mari, which is attended chiefly by low-caste Hindus. Sub-judge's court, post office, and dispensary.\n\nSirsi.\u2014Town in Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 5607, consisting of 1616 Hindus and 3991 Muhammadans. Situated in lat. 28\u00b0 36' 30\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 39' 45\" E., 17 miles southwest of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d town, and 3 miles east of the S\u00f3t river.\n\nSirsi.\u2014Petty State in the Goona Agency, under the Central India Agency. In 1820, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 D\u00e1ulat R\u00e1o Sindhia granted three-fourths of the revenue of the t\u00e1luk of Sirsi to Barut Sah, on condition that he would pay the other fourth, and reduce the Grassias and other lawless tribes to obedience. In 1837, the payment of the one-fourth of the revenue was remitted on condition of military service when required. The revenue of the State was estimated in 1875 at \u00a3400 per annum. The present D\u00edw\u00e1n of Sirsi is named Bij\u00e1i Bah\u00e1dur.\n\nSirsund\u00ed.\u2014Chiefship in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces; 24 miles east of Wair\u00e1garh; comprising 15 villages. Sirsund\u00ed village is situated in lat. 20\u00b0 26' N., and long. 80\u00b0 23' E.\n\nSiruguppa.\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras.\u2014See Siragupa.\n\nSir\u00far (or Ghodn\u00e1di).\u2014Chief town of the Sir\u00far Subdivision of Poona District, Bombay; situated on the river Ghod, in lat. 18\u00b0 49' 45\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 22' 51\" E., 36 miles north-west of Poona city, and 34 miles south-west of Ahmednagar. Sir\u00far is a municipal town, with a total population (1872) of 5049, and a municipal revenue of \u00a3350. There is a cantonment at Sir\u00far, which is also the headquarters of the Poona Horse. At a hamlet about 2 miles south of the town, a Hindu fair, attended by about 3000 persons, is held yearly in March or April. Post office and dispensary.\n\nSirutandanall\u00far (or Iral).\u2014Trading town in Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras; situated near the mouth of the T\u00e1mbraparni, in lat. 8\u00b0 38' N., and long. 78\u00b0 35' 15\" E. Pop. (1871), 5558, living in 1614 houses.\nSisang Chaudli.\u2014One of the petty States in H\u00e1ll\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 2 villages, with 5 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3750; of which \u00a372 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a322 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSiskal-betta (or Situk\u00e1lt-betta).\u2014Lofty mountain, with a columnar peak, in the central range of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, which form the frontier between Hassan District, Mysore, and the Madras District of South Kanara.\n\nSisp\u00e1ra (Chichchip\u00e1rai).\u2014Pass leading from Malabar to the Nilgiris District, Madras. Lat. 11\u00b0 12' N., long. 76\u00b0 28' E. Now entirely out of repair.\n\nSissaindi.\u2014Town in Lucknow District, Oudh; situated on the banks of the S\u00e1i river, 6 miles south-east of Mohanl\u00e1lganj. The seat of R\u00e1j\u00e1 K\u00e1si Pras\u00e1d, a wealthy t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r. Pop. (1869), 3140.\n\nSiss\u00e1na.\u2014Agricultural town in Rohtak District, Punjab. Pop. (1868), 5051, consisting of 3830 Hindus, 467 Muhammadans, and 754 'others.'\n\nSitab\u00e1ldi.\u2014Battle-field near N\u00e1gpur city, in Nagpur District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 9' N., long. 79\u00b0 8' E.\n\nSit\u00e1kund.\u2014Highest peak in the Sit\u00e1kund range, Chittagong District, Bengal. A sacred hill, 1155 feet above sea level. Lat. 22\u00b0 37' 40\" N., long. 91\u00b0 41' 40\" E.\n\nSit\u00e1kund (or Chandran\u00e1th).\u2014Hot spring on the above mountain, said to be bituminous. A great place of pilgrimage for pious Hindus from all parts of India. Tradition states that Sit\u00e1kund was visited by both R\u00e1ma and Siva; and it is believed to be one of the favourite earthly residences of the latter deity. The principal gathering is the Siva Chaturdasi festival, on the 14th day of the moon sacred to Siva (usually in February); it lasts about ten days, and is attended by from 10,000 to 20,000 devotees. The pilgrims live at lodging-houses kept for the purpose by Br\u00e1hmans, called adhik\u00e1rts, each of whom is said to realize from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 during this feast. Minor gatherings take place at Sit\u00e1kund in or near the months of March and November, and on the occasion of every eclipse of the sun and moon. The ascent of Sit\u00e1kund or Chandran\u00e1th Hill is said to redeem the pilgrim from the misery of a future birth. A meeting of Buddhists (chiefly hillmen) takes place on the last day of the Beng\u00e1l\u00ed year at a spot on Chandran\u00e1th Hill, where the body of Gautama, the last Buddha, is locally reported to have been burned after death. Bones of deceased relatives are brought here, and deposited in a pit sacred to Gautama.\n\nSit\u00e1kund.\u2014An oblong tank, about 100 feet long by 50 feet wide, excavated in the Mandar Hill, Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal, nearly\n500 feet above the surrounding plain. The pilgrims who visit it are persuaded to believe that Sita used to bathe in it during her stay on the hill with her husband when banished from Oudh. On the northern bank of this tank stood the first temple of Madhusudan, ascribed to Raja Chola, now entirely in ruins.\n\nSitalpur.\u2014Village in Saran District, Bengal; situated on the Gandak river. Pop. (1872), 2474.\n\nSitamarhi.\u2014Subdivision of Muzaffarpur District, Bengal, lying between 26\u00b0 18' 30\" and 26\u00b0 52' 15\" N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 13' 15\" and 85\u00b0 57' 45\" E. long. Area, 996 square miles; villages, 1002; ouses, 98,607. Pop. (1872), 717,609, of whom 609,910, or 84.9 per cent., were Hindus; 107,567, or 15 per cent., Muhammadans; 115 Christians, and 17 'others.' Proportion of males in total population, 50.2; average density of population per square mile, 721; number of villages per square mile, 1.01; persons per village, 716; houses per square mile, 99; persons per house, 7.3. This Subdivision consists of the 4 police circles of Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Belamochpakauini, and Jali. In 1870, it contained 1 court, a force of 67 policemen, and 1459 village watchmen; the cost of Subdivisional administration was returned at \u00a3946, 14s.\n\nSitamarhi.\u2014Municipal town and headquarters of Sitamarhi Subdivision, Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated on the west bank of the Lakhandai, in lat. 26\u00b0 35' 20\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 31' 33\" E. Pop. (1872), 5496. Municipal revenue (1876-77), \u00a3112; rate of taxation, 4\u00bdd. per head. The town contains a good dispensary, school, bazar, and distillery, and a munshi formerly stationed at Koeli; daily markets with trade in rice, sakhwada wood, oil-seeds, hides, and Nepali produce; chief manufactures\u2014saltpetre, and the janao or sacred thread worn by Brahmins and others. Large fair held in the month of Chaitra, the principal day being the 9th of the Sukal Paksh, or Ramnami, the day on which Rama is said to have been born. This fair lasts a fortnight, and is attended by people from very great distances. Sewan pottery, elephants and horses, form the staple article of commerce; but the fair is noted for the large number of bullocks brought here, the Sitamarhi cattle being supposed to be an especially good breed. Tradition relates that the lovely Janaki or Sita, whose life is described in the Ramayana, here sprang to life out of an earthen pot into which Raja Janak had driven his ploughshare. Nine temples, of which five are in the same enclosure as that of Sita, are dedicated to Sita, Hanuman, Siva, and Dahi. A wooden bridge here crosses the Lakhandai, built by Rudra Prasad of Nanpur Koeli. Sitamarhi is connected by road with the Nepali frontier, with Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur.\nS\u00edt\u00e1mau.\u2014Native State in the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency, under the Central India Agency. Area, 350 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 29,400; estimated revenue from all sources, \u00a319,587. Tribute of \u00a35,500 is paid to Sindhia. The tribute was originally fixed at \u00a36,000, but was reduced by \u00a3500 in 1860 in compliance with the representations of the British Government. The principal products of the State are grain, opium, and cotton. S\u00edt\u00e1mau, like Sail\u00e1na, formed originally a portion of Ratlam, and was separated from it on the death of R\u00e1m Sinh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratlam in 1660 A.D., when his second son Kassur D\u00e1s succeeded to the lands now comprised in S\u00edt\u00e1mau. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Sinh, a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, was born about 1836. He receives a salute of 11 guns. The military force consists of 6 guns, 50 horse, and 200 foot.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1mau.\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name, Central India; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 2' 7\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 22' 24\" E., about 230 miles south-west of the fort of Gwalior.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1mpetta.\u2014Pass in Vizagapatam District, Madras, being one of the principal roads from Vizagapatam into Ganj\u00e1m, and the usual route into North J\u00e1ipur (Jeypore). Lat. 18\u00b0 40' N., long. 83\u00b0 55' E. The road is practicable for wheeled traffic.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1nagaram.\u2014Hills in Kistna District, Madras, lying between 16\u00b0 28' and 16\u00b0 29' 40\" N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 38' and 88\u00b0 38' 40\" E. long., on the right bank of the Kistna river opposite Bezw\u00e1da, and forming one base of the great anicut. Near this are some interesting Buddhist remains, including a four-storied rock-cut temple now adapted to Vishnu worship.\n\nSitang.\u2014Bold conical peak in the Sing\u00e1lil\u00e1 range, D\u00e1rjiling District, Bengal; situated to the south-east of D\u00e1rjiling station. Lat. 26\u00b0 54' 45\" N., long. 88\u00b0 26' E.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1pur.\u2014Division or Commissionership of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. It forms the north-west Division of Oudh, and comprises the three Districts of Sitapur, Hardoi, and Kheri. Area, 7,455 square miles, of which 3,953 are returned as under cultivation; pop. (according to the Census of 1869, but allowing for recent changes of area), 2,603,619, namely, 2,325,920 Hindus, 276,803 Muhammadans, and 896 Christians. Number of males, 1,398,465; females, 1,205,154; average density of population, 348 per square mile; number of villages, 6,097. S\u00edt\u00e1pur corresponds approximately to the old administrative Division or sark\u00e1r of Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d under the Delhi Emperors. The following table, showing the parg\u00e1nds of that Division in Akbar's time, and the different proprietary classes then and at the present day, is quoted from the Provincial Oudh Gazetteer, vol. iii. pp. 338-340:\u2014\n**SITAPUR DISTRICT.**\n\n**Statement showing the Revenue, Owners, etc. of Parganas of Khairabad according to the 'Ain-i-Akbari,' and at the present day.**\n\n| Parganas          | Area in bighas | Revenue demand according to Ain-i-Akbari | Proprietors in Ain-i-Akbari | Present Proprietors |\n|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Khairigarh        | 43,050         | 45,233                                   | Bais, Bisens, B\u00e1chhils, Kurmis | Pah\u00e1ria Kshatriyas. |\n| Kheri             | 260,168        | 81,504                                   | Bisens, Janw\u00e1rs             | Janw\u00e1rs, Chauh\u00e1ns.  |\n| Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra          | 21,740         | 6,152                                    | Various tribes              | Musalm\u00e1ns.          |\n| Bisw\u00e1n            | 144,321        | 48,732                                   | B\u00e1chhils                    | Musalm\u00e1ns, etc.     |\n| Garh Kila Naw\u00e1    | 15,811         | 12,246                                   | Ahirs                       | J\u00e1ngres, Sikhs, etc.|\n| Dhaurahra         |                |                                          |                             |                     |\n| Barw\u00e1r            | 135,319        | 88,634                                   | R\u00e1jputs and Br\u00e1hmans        | Various tribes.     |\n| Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d         | 159,072        | 54,031                                   | Br\u00e1hmans                    | Do.                 |\n| L\u00e1harpur          | 208,288        | 75,512                                   | Do.                         | Gaurs.              |\n| S\u00e1ra              | 68,832         | 52,299                                   | Chauh\u00e1ns                    | Do.                 |\n| Gop\u00e1mau           | 120,698        | 20,779                                   | Chawars, Kunw\u00e1rs (Ahban), B\u00e1chhils | Various tribes.     |\n| Sadrpur           | 107,308        | 140,512                                  | Janw\u00e1rs, B\u00e1chhils           | Raikw\u00e1rs, etc.      |\n| Chat\u00edapur (Sit\u00e1pur) | ...          | ...                                      | Gaurs, R\u00e1jputs              | Gaurs.              |\n| S\u00e1ndi             | 211,714        | 78,883                                   | Sombansis                   | Sombansis.          |\n| Palla             | 64,706         | 44,134                                   | B\u00e1chhils                    | Janw\u00e1rs, Chauh\u00e1ns.  |\n| Bas\u00e1ra            | 8,971          | 10,886                                   | Do.                         | Do.                 |\n| P\u00e1lia             | 56,156         | 31,531                                   | Ahirs, Asas                 | Various.            |\n| Nimkh\u00e1r           | 58,770         | 89,151                                   | Ahirs                       | Do.                 |\n| Machhrehta        |                |                                          | B\u00e1chhils                    | Do.                 |\n| Harg\u00e1m            |                |                                          | Br\u00e1hmans                    | Gaurs.              |\n\n**Sit\u00e1pur.\u2014** A British District in the Sit\u00e1pur Division or Commissionership of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces; lying between 27\u00b0 7' and 27\u00b0 53' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 21' and 80\u00b0 26' E. long. Area (Parliamentary Return, 1878), 2206 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1869, 932,959 souls. The District is elliptical in shape; greatest length from south-east to north-west, 70 miles; extreme breadth from north-east to south-west, 55 miles. Bounded on the north by Kheri; on the east by Bahr\u00e1ich, the Gogra river marking the boundary line; and on the south and west by B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki, Lucknow, and Hardoi Districts, the Gumti river forming the boundary. The administrative headquarters of the District are at Sitapur Town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.\u2014** Sit\u00e1pur consists of one large plain, sloping imperceptibly from an elevation of 505 feet above sea level in the north-west, to\n400 feet in the south-east, the fall averaging 1\u00bd foot per mile. Although containing no forest tracts and but little jungle, the country is well wooded with numerous groves, and closely cultivated, except in parts where the soil is barren or cut up into ravines. It is intersected by frequent streams, and contains many shallow ponds and natural reservoirs, which are full of water during the rains, but gradually dry up in the hot season. The District is naturally divided into two parts by a low ridge running down from the north, parallel to the course of the Chauka and Gogra rivers. The western division occupies about two-thirds of the entire District, and has a dry soil, which in the extreme west, towards the Gumti, becomes sandy. In the vicinity of the smaller streams, the surface is deeply scored by the ravines which form its natural drainage. The eastern division, locally known as the ganjar, consists of the dodbs or alluvial plains between the Kew\u00e1ni and Chauka, and the Chauka and Gogra rivers. This is a damp, moist tract, growing good rice-crops, but interspersed with patches of land covered with saline efflorescence (reh), which is entirely uncultivable, and is fatal to all wild vegetation except the stunted babul tree (Acacia arabica). This tract is very liable to inundation. The principal rivers are the following:\u2014The Gogra, the principal river of Oudh, forms the eastern boundary of S\u00edt\u00e1pur, and in the rainy season has a width of from 4 to 6 miles; the Chauka runs nearly parallel to the Gogra, 8 miles to the west, and finally falls into the latter river at Bahramgh\u00e1t in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1\u0144ki District. Numerous cross channels connect the Gogra with the Chauka. Proceeding westwards are the Gon, Oel, Kew\u00e1ni, Sar\u00e1yan, and Gumti, the latter forming the western and southern boundary of the District. The Gogra is the only river navigable by boats of large tonnage throughout the year. The others are all fordable at certain points during the dry season. There are no large river-side towns in the District, nor any river trading population. The only mineral product is kankar or nodular limestone, which is found in abundance in many parts of the country. The indigenous trees of the District are the mango (Mangifera indica), p\u00edpal (Ficus religiosa), gular (Ficus glomerata), p\u00e1k\u00e1r (Ficus venosa), bargad or banian tree (Ficus indica), n\u00edm (Azadirachta indica), sissu (Dalbergia sissoo), tun (Cedrela toona), simal or cotton tree (Bombax heptaphyllum), pharenda (Syzigium jambolanum), j\u00e1mun (Eugenia jambolanum), bel (\u00c6gle marmelos), kath\u00e1l (Artocarpus integrifolia), babul (Acacia arabica), khayer (Acacia catechu), dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa), khejur (Phoenix sylvestris), \u00e1onla (Phyllanthus emblica), siras (Mimosa sirissa), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), kachn\u00e1r (Bauhinia variegata), and the common bamboo. Gums and dyes are collected in the jungles, and fibres are utilized from the roots of the dh\u00e1k tree and from munj and sarpat grass. None of the larger wild animals are met with. Nilg\u00e1i, many\nvarieties of deer, wild hog, wolf, jackal, fox, and hare are common. The dolphin and crocodile are found in the Gogra.\n\n**History.** \u2014 The history of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District presents no distinctive features apart from that of the Province as a whole; but the following paragraphs respecting the territorial distribution of property among the clans and their earlier history, quoted from the *Oudh Gazetteer*, may be found interesting:\n\n\u2018To the east, the Raikw\u00e1rs occupy most of the country between the Chauka and Kauri\u00e1la, North and South Kundri forming part of the block of territory extending north and south about 60 miles along both sides of the Kauri\u00e1la, over which for one or two centuries the Raikw\u00e1rs have exercised a real or nominal supremacy. The great Raikw\u00e1r estates of Baundi and R\u00e1mnagar are in Bahraich and B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki Districts; the younger branches of the clan settled in S\u00edt\u00e1pur, at Mall\u00e1pur, at Chahl\u00e1ri, and at R\u00e1mpur, all on the western bank of the Kauri\u00e1la. The ancestor of each branch got three or four villages, and has gradually increased his possessions through the aid and influence of the great lords of his blood in Baundi and R\u00e1mnagar. The estate of Chahl\u00e1ri was forfeited after the Mutiny for rebellion. The clan is a very small one in point of numbers.\n\n\u2018To the north, in *parg\u00e1ns* S\u00edt\u00e1pur, L\u00e1harpur, Harg\u00e1m, Chandra, and Tambaur, the great Bamhan Gaur clan from N\u00e1rkanjari settled towards the close of Alamg\u00edr\u2019s reign. They commenced by attacking the Ahbans and the Janw\u00e1rs of Kheri, who were driven into exile about 1760 A.D. The Gours then proceeded farther to the north-west, having meanwhile consolidated their power in S\u00edt\u00e1pur and L\u00e1harpur; they attacked the Musalm\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Muhamdi, defeated and drove him out. At length the Rohill\u00e1s came to the aid of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and drove back the Gours with heavy loss; the last battle was fought at Mail\u00e1ni, 20 miles north of Kukra, so far had the Gours carried their victorious arms. They then joined with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dhaurahra in resisting N\u00e1zim S\u00edt\u00e1l Parsh\u00e1d, the most sanguinary of all the satraps whom the early Oudh Naw\u00e1bs let loose upon the conquered country. They were defeated with heavy loss at Dhaurahra; one of their chiefs was beheaded in the river under the fort of Khairigarh, and the clan then settled down into ordinary rural squires.\n\n\u2018To the south, the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1da family of Bilahra, in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, has within the last seventy years occupied most of the *parg\u00e1ns* of Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sadrpur, besides acquiring large estates in Bisw\u00e1n, by mortgage or simply as trustee. This family has generally numbered among its members men of ability and energy; they were connected by marriage with the influential Shaikhz\u00e1das of Lucknow, and were used by the Lucknow court as a check upon the great Raikw\u00e1r kingdom along the Gogra, which their principality almost cut in two.\nTo the east, the Ahbans held formerly *pargands* N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Maholi, and part of Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, besides part of the Districts of Kheri and Hardoi. Lon Sinh, the great R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mitauli, was banished for rebellion in 1859, and his estate divided among a number of loyal grantees. His only brother tried in vain to recover a part of the property, which is said to have once included 2700 villages. The Ahbans produce a family tree with 109 generations; they are Chawar Kshattriyas, and came from Guzerat. Almost the only survivor of the clan in S\u00edt\u00e1pur is called a Kunw\u00e1r, and is a man of little property or influence. The clan is now of no importance, so hollow and transitory was the power of these great landowners. A number of deeds were produced in the Kheri courts in which the Ahban chiefs are styled Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s by the Emperors Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr; they were skilfully executed forgeries. Their former *pargands* are now held by Mughal grantees from the Oudh kings, by K\u00e1yasths and others, probably retainers of the ancient Ahbans.\n\nThe middle portion of S\u00edt\u00e1pur is held by many different clans of Kshattriyas. Originally, there was a powerful Chauh\u00e1n sovereignty in S\u00edt\u00e1pur, and a Raghubansi principality in Tambaur; they have both disappeared. A variety of clans occupy each a *pargan\u00e1* or the greater part of a *pargand*, except in Bisw\u00e1n and Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, which were the seats of local governors, who took care to destroy the coherence of the clan system by breaking up its possessions and distributing them miscellaneously. It is remarkable that no clan except the Gaurs asserted its supremacy over large areas like the Kanhpurias, Sombansis, or Bais in Southern Oudh. It is a mistake, indeed, to call them clans; each is a collection of a few families, of whom the eldest member was the leader, and was called the Th\u00e1kur. These gentlemen increased their estates during the later years of native rule by appropriating the shares of their brethren.\n\nThe different landowning Kshattriya clans are the following:\u2014In Gundlamau *pargan\u00e1*, B\u00e1chhils; in B\u00e1ri, Bais; in P\u00edrnagar, Bais; in Manw\u00e1n, Panw\u00e1rs; in R\u00e1mkot, Janw\u00e1rs; in Kurauna, Janw\u00e1rs; in Machrehta, Kachhw\u00e1has, Janw\u00e1rs, Bais and Rahtors. The Janw\u00e1rs' possessions are mainly to the west of the Sar\u00e1yan; those of the Bais to the east. Both these clans are probably of indigenous origin, as are also the B\u00e1chhils and the Raghubansi. The Panw\u00e1rs, Kachhw\u00e1has, and Gaurs are immigrants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. None of the above clans have a R\u00e1j\u00e1 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur; but the Ahban R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mitauli, the Panw\u00e1r R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Itaunja, and the Raikw\u00e1r R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Baundi did to a certain extent exercise a control over their clansmen in the District. It is noteworthy that there is not in this District a single R\u00e1j\u00e1 by descent recognised as such by the people, and the title is not even claimed by any one. The special feature of the S\u00edt\u00e1pur land proprietary is the\nexistence of a number of men, about fifteen, with large estates paying from \u00a3500 to \u00a31900 land revenue, who have not been entered in the 't\u00e1lukdars' list.'\n\nSit\u00e1pur figured prominently in the Mutiny of 1857. In that year, 3 regiments of Native infantry and a regiment of military police were quartered in S\u00edt\u00e1pur cantonments. The troops rose in mutiny on the morning of the 3rd June, fired on their officers, many of whom were killed, as were also several military and civil officers, with their wives and children, in attempting to escape. Ultimately, many of the refugees succeeded in escaping to Lucknow, while others obtained the protection of some loyal zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. On the 13th April 1858, Sir Hope Grant inflicted a severe defeat on the rebels near Bisw\u00e1n. Order was completely restored before the end of that year, the courts and offices were reopened; and since then nothing has occurred to disturb the peace of the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, according to the Census of 1869, was 932,959, viz. 497,241 males and 435,718 females, spread over an area of 2206 square miles, and inhabiting 2039 towns and villages. Average density of population, 423 per square mile. Hindus numbered 813,331, or 87\u00b717 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 117,807, or 12\u00b783 per cent. The Christian population consists of 774 Europeans and 40 Eurasians. The remaining 1007 were prisoners in jail. Among high-caste Hindus, the most numerous are the Br\u00e1hmans, 99,596; R\u00e1jputs, 39,696; Vaisyas, 16,745; and K\u00e1yasths, 12,537. Of the low castes, the principal are\u2014Cham\u00e1rs, tanners and labourers, 111,745, being the most numerous caste in the District; Ah\u00edrs, cowherds and cultivators, 85,509; Kurm\u00eds, cultivators and zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, 74,597; P\u00e1s\u00eds, watchmen, labourers, etc., 72,771; Lodh\u00eds, cultivators, 36,146; Mur\u00e1os, gardeners and cultivators, 32,593; Kah\u00e1rs, palanquin-bearers, 26,367; and Tel\u00eds, oilmen, 20,204. The higher classes of Muhammadans comprise\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 17,694; Shaikhs, 10,439; Sayyids, 2734; and Mughals, 1940. These are chiefly t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs and zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, or servants in respectable employ, either Government or private. Of low-class Muhammadans, the most numerous are\u2014Julah\u00e1s, weavers, 30,895; Darz\u00eds, tailors, 7025; Kunjras, greengrocers, 4289; Ghosis, milkmen, 3649. S\u00edt\u00e1pur District contained, in 1869, 6 towns with upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely\u2014Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, 15,677; Laharpur, 10,890; Bisw\u00e1n, 7308; Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, 6312; S\u00edt\u00e1pur, the administrative headquarters of the District, 5780 (exclusive of the cantonments); and Paintepur, 5127. The four municipal towns or unions are S\u00edt\u00e1pur, Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bisw\u00e1n, and Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, containing a total population of 41,637. Total municipal income in 1876-77, \u00a32080; expenditure, \u00a32063; average incidence of taxation, 11\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. The villages and townships are\nthus classified in the Census Report of 1869:\u2014782 contain less than 200 inhabitants; 682 from 200 to 500; 457 from 500 to 1000; 91 from 1000 to 2000; 21 from 2000 to 5000; and 6 upwards of 5000 inhabitants.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Two harvests are gathered in the year\u2014the *kharif* or autumn crops, and the *rabi* or spring crops. The *kharif* consists of the following:\u2014Rice (*Oryza sativa*), *kodo* (*Paspalum scrobiculatum*), *sawan* (*Panicum frumentaceum*), *mandua* (*Eleusine coracana*), *k\u00e1kim* (*Panicum italicum*), *jodr* (*Sorghum vulgare*), *b\u00e1jra* (*Pencillaria spicata*), *til* (*Sesamum orientale*), *urid* or *mas* (*Phaseolus radiatus*), *m\u00fag* (*Phaseolus mungo*), *moth* (*Phaseolus aconitifolius*), *p\u00e1t* (*Hibiscus sabdariffa*), *san* (*Crotalaria juncea*). Rice forms the staple crop of the eastern or moist portion of the District. The *rabi* or spring crops are\u2014wheat (*Triticum vulgare*), gram (*Cicer arietinum*), barley (*Hordeum hexastichon*), *l\u00e1hi* or mustard (*Sinapis nigra vel glauca*), *tisi* or linseed (*Linum usitatissimum*), castor-oil (*Ricinus communis*), *matar* or peas (*Pisum sativum*), *mastri* (*Ervum lens*), *arhar* (*Cajanus indicus*), safflower (*Carthamus tinctorius*). Besides the above, which are the staple *kharif* and *rabi* crops, a considerable quantity of sugar-cane is raised, as also cotton, *p\u00e1n*, and tobacco. Poppy is cultivated under Government supervision. Garden produce consists of kitchen vegetables of every description, turmeric, spices, ginger, water-melons. The cultivated fruits are guavas, plantains, custard-apples, oranges and lemons, wood-apples, melons, pomelos, etc. The estimated area under the principal staples are\u2014wheat, 165,003 acres; barley, 95,003; gram, 95,000; rice, 81,000; *jodr*, 70,000; *b\u00e1jra*, 52,000; oil-seeds, 30,000; sugar-cane, 15,000. The average size of a holding is about 3\u00bd acres, or 1\u00be of an acre for each adult head of the agricultural population. The profits of cultivation, after paying for labour, are calculated at about 4s. per acre per year; labour at the market price is worth about \u00a33 per annum; therefore a tenant cultivating 3\u00bd acres with his own hands will be worth about \u00a33, 14s. per annum, and if his cattle are his own, and he is unburdened by debt, he may make \u00a34, 16s. What with bad seasons, unforeseen expenses, etc., the small tenant is generally in debt, and his net earnings in that case will be about \u00a33 per annum. Rents, as a rule, are paid in kind, only about one-tenth of the whole being cash payments. The landlord's share varies from one-fourth to one-half, both extremes, however, being exceptional. Where rents are paid in money, the following are given as the average rates per acre in the official returns:\u2014Rice lands, 8s. 4\u00bdd.; wheat, 10s. 10\u00bdd.; gram, barley, or maize, 7s. 3d.; cotton, 12s. 1\u00bdd.; opium, 19s. 6d.; oil-seeds, 8s. 3d.; sugar-cane, \u00a31, os. 3d.; tobacco, \u00a31, 1s. 9d. The average price of food grains per cwt. during the five years 1866-70, is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 5s. 11d.; barley, 3s. 6\u00bdd.; gram, 5s. 6d.; and *b\u00e1jra*,\n4s. 6d. Wages are slightly higher than in the adjacent District of B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki. In Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1, an agricultural labourer engaged by the month receives wages at the rate of 6s. per month. If working by the day at raising water from wells or tanks, he is paid at the rate of 3d. per diem in towns; and by an allowance of food grain in rural parts. The prevailing tenures are as follows:\u2014937 villages or parts of villages, held in t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed, 1226 in zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed, 350 in patt\u00edd\u00e1r\u00ed, and 59 in bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra. There are 30 large t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs paying a Government assessment of upwards of \u00a3500, of whom the following are the principal:\u2014R\u00e1j\u00e1 Am\u00edr Hassan Kh\u00e1n, assessed at \u00a314,749; Th\u00e1kur Siu Baksh Sinh, \u00a37635; Th\u00e1kur Jaw\u00e1hir Sinh, \u00a33850; Th\u00e1kur Gum\u00e1n Sinh, \u00a33296; Muhammad Bakr Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, \u00a33155. Most of the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs also hold estates in other parts of the Province. As indicated in the historical section of this article, the greater part of the land is in the hands of various clans of Kshattriyas, who are returned as holding 1379 villages in S\u00edt\u00e1pur. Muhammadans are the proprietors of 704 villages.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The eastern portion of the District is peculiarly liable to floods, being under water more or less entirely every year during the rains. These inundations often devastate whole villages, and invariably cause loss to the inhabitants through the injury to their houses, the drowning of their cattle, and the destruction of their khar\u00edf or autumn crops. In the great flood of 1871, three-fourths of the autumn crops perished, and from July to September the country was one sheet of water. Drought, however, is the main cause of famine; and the Deputy Commissioner reports that famine occurred in 1769-70, 1784-85, 1837-38, and in 1860-61, caused by want of rain. S\u00edt\u00e1pur was also verging on famine for a few months at the close of 1869, but a plentiful late crop happily saved the District.\n\nRoads and Means of Communication, etc.\u2014Two metalled lines of road run through S\u00edt\u00e1pur District\u2014one from S\u00edt\u00e1pur town to Lucknow for 33\u00bd miles, and the other to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur for 23 miles. Unmetalled roads communicate with Lakhimpur, Hardoi, Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bahr\u00e1ich, Mall\u00e1pur, Mehnd\u00edg\u00e1h\u00e1t, Sandl\u00e1, Nimkhar, Kasta, Mit\u00e1uli, Pih\u00e1ni, etc. Total length of roads in the District, 266 miles. The Oudh and Rohil-khand Railway nowhere touches on S\u00edt\u00e1pur District. The only manufactures of any note are those of tobacco and taz\u00edds at Bisw\u00e1n, with a little cotton printing and weaving in many of the towns. Bisw\u00e1n contains about 100 families of weavers; but here, as elsewhere, the industry is decaying, owing to the competition of English manufactured cloth.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The judicial staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, with two or three European and four or five native Assistants of various grades. The total imperial revenue of the District in 1871-72\nwas \u00a3147,588, of which \u00a3131,379 was derived from the land revenue. The civil expenditure in the same year amounted to \u00a315,536. In the same year, receipts from local funds amounted to \u00a313,159, and expenditure to \u00a313,013. Total imperial and local revenue, \u00a3160,747; expenditure, \u00a328,549. For police purposes, the District is divided into the following 10 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), viz.:\u2014S\u00edt\u00e1pur, B\u00e1ri, Maholi Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, Misrikh, Bisw\u00e1n, L\u00e1harpur, Tambaur, Th\u00e1n\u00e1g\u00e1on, and Khimauna; with 4 outpost stations at Rudrapur, Jal\u00e1lpur, Bah\u00e1durpur, and N\u00edmkhar. The regular police force in 1873 consisted of 548 officers and men, maintained at a cost to Government of \u00a37951; the village police or rural watch numbered 3913 men, maintained by the landholders or villagers at an estimated cost of \u00a314,086; besides a town force of 131 officers and men, costing \u00a3682. Education is spreading steadily year by year. In 1875, there were 149 Government and aided schools in the District, attended by 6521 pupils. The Wesleyan Mission, the headquarters of which is at S\u00edt\u00e1pur, have a school at Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d. Charitable dispensaries are established at S\u00edt\u00e1pur and Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the District is healthy, and the cantonments of S\u00edt\u00e1pur are famous for the low mortality of the British troops stationed there. There are no diseases peculiar to the District. Intermittent fever, but not of a bad type, is prevalent from August to November. Small-pox appears from March to September; a few deaths from cholera are reported every year. Cholera appeared in an epidemic form in 1869 at the N\u00edmkhar fair, when the mortality was very considerable. The mean temperature of the District ranges from 45\u00b0 F. in the cold season, to 96\u00b0 F. in the hot weather; but it is often so cold as to produce hoar-frost in the early mornings, and the manufacture of ice in shallow earthenware vessels is carried on in December and January. Average annual rainfall for the five years ending 1871, 32\u00bd inches, the general average of the Province being 38 inches.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1pur.\u2014Principal tahsil or Subdivision of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Lakhimpur, on the east by Bisw\u00e1n, on the south by Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, and on the west by Misrikh. Area, 564 square miles, of which 357 are returned as under cultivation; pop. (1869), 246,291, viz. 199,198 Hindus and 47,103 Muhammadans; males, 131,784, and females, 114,517. Average density of population, 439 per square mile; number of villages or townships, 650. This tahsil comprises the 6 parg\u00e1ns of S\u00edt\u00e1pur, Harg\u00e1m, L\u00e1harpur, Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, P\u00ednagar, and R\u00e1mkot.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1pur.\u2014Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Kheri District, on the east and south by the Sar\u00e1yan river, and on the west by Maholi parg\u00e1n\u00e1. Area, 115 square miles, or 73,695 acres; of which 43,029 acres are returned as cultivated, 8651 as held\nrevenue free, 12,211 as cultivable, and 9794 as uncultivable waste. Pop. (1869), 49,896, viz. 41,825 Hindus and 8071 Muhammadans. Of the 159 villages constituting the pargan\u00e1, only 5 are held by talukd\u00e1rs, 115 of the remaining 159 being held in samind\u00e1ri tenure by Gaur Kshattriyas. Government land revenue, \u00a36607, being at the rate of 3s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 2s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Tradition states that R\u00e1ma and his wife S\u00edt\u00e1 sojourned here during their wanderings, and that a town was founded on the spot by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Vikram\u00e1ditya, and named S\u00edt\u00e1pur in honour of S\u00edt\u00e1. About seven centuries ago, a tribe of Chauh\u00e1ns under Goheldeo, a relative of King Prithwi R\u00e1j of Delhi, invaded the country, and drove out the Kurmis and low-caste tribes, who were then its possessors. Goheldeo and his descendants held sway for about five centuries, until the reign of Aurangzeb, when a tribe of Gaur Kshattriyas, led by Chandra Sen, dispossessed the Chauh\u00e1ns from their lands, with the exception of S\u00edt\u00e1pur, Sa\u00e1datnagar, and Tehar. Chandra Sen had four sons, whose descendants still hold the greater part of the pargan\u00e1. S\u00edt\u00e1pur was originally constituted a pargan\u00e1 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Todar Mall, the finance minister of Akbar.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1pur.\u2014Municipal town and administrative headquarters of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; situated on the banks of the Sar\u00e1yan river, half-way on the road from Lucknow to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, in lat. 27\u00b0 34\u2032 5\u2033 N., and long. 80\u00b0 42\u2032 55\u2033 E. The population of the town, exclusive of the cantonments, in 1869, numbered 5780, Muhammadans slightly predominating. The town and station are picturesquely situated among fine mango groves. Annual b\u00e1z\u00e1r sales average about \u00a348,000. Government school, attended by 170 pupils.\n\nS\u00edt\u00e1pur.\u2014Town in B\u00e1n\u00e1 District, North-Western Provinces; situated a short distance from the foot of the sacred hill of Chitrakot, on the left bank of the Paisuni river, 5 miles from Karwi and 43 miles from B\u00e1n\u00e1 town. Pop. (1872), 2327. Many old and highly venerated temples. Pilgrims flock hither all the year round, and, after bathing, measure the circuit of Chitrakot Hill (5 miles) with their bodies extended flat on the ground, or by simply walking. The original name of the town appears to have been J\u00e1i Sinhpura, when it was inhabited by Kols, at a time when Chitrakot was already an ancient place of worship. Police outpost; brisk trade.\n\nSitar\u00e1mpalli.\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras.\u2014See Chatrapur.\n\nSitar\u00e1mpur.\u2014One of the abandoned coal-mines of the R\u00e1n\u00edganj coal-field in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. There are five pits, one of which was opened in 1847 and the remaining four in 1864. Total out-turn of coal in 1866, 78,490 maunds. The mine was abandoned in consequence of the poor quality of the coal.\nSitoung.\u2014River of Burma.\u2014See Tsit-toung.\n\nSitpur.\u2014Municipal village in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab. Pop. (1868), 1798. Municipal income (1876-77), \u00a3146; expenditure, \u00a3104; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nSivaganga.\u2014Zamindari in Madura District, Madras. Area, about 1460 square miles; pop. (1871), 432,023, living in 2193 villages and 95,886 houses. The peshkash (revenue) paid to Government is \u00a328,782. The zamindari was formerly part of the Ramnad or Setupati's territory. About 1730, Kattaya Tevan, 11th Setupati, surrendered to the p\u00e2leg\u00e2r of Nalkotai ('four forts'), Seshavarna Tevan, two-fifths of his kingdom, which thenceforth became independent of Ramnad. In 1772, the p\u00e2leg\u00e2r's country was reduced by the British under Colonel Joseph Smith; and the Raja was killed while endeavouring to escape by one of the gates of the fort of Kalaiy\u00e2r Kovil. The Rani escaped to Mysore with some of her friends, and sought protection from Haidar Ali. Later on, she was restored to the zamindari; but on her death in 1800, Seshavarna's line became extinct. In July of the following year, Ud\u00e2ya Tevan was proclaimed zamindar of Sivaganga. The permanent settlement of the estate was made with him in 1803. The Sivaganga estate has figured in the civil courts for many years in one of the most notable of Hindu succession cases. The town of Sivaganga (lat. 9\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 31' 50\" E.) contains (1871) 7392 inhabitants.\n\nSivaganga.\u2014Hill in Bangalore District, Mysore; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 10' N., and long. 77\u00b0 17' E., 4559 feet above sea level. Many religious associations are connected with this hill, and its face is crowded with sacred buildings and inscriptions. On the east its outline is supposed to resemble a bull, on the west Ganesha, on the north a serpent, and on the south a linga. The number of steps leading to the summit is reckoned equal to the number of yojanas hence to Benares, and consequently the ascent is held to be a vicarious pilgrimage to that city. The two principal temples on the northern face, dedicated to Ganga-dhareswara and Honna Devamma, are formed out of large natural caverns. On the eastern face is a Lingayat m\u00e2th, or monastery. The village of the same name is at the northern base of the hill; pop. (1871), 721. The houses are all of stone, and form one street, approached by a gateway, through which the car of the god is drawn at religious festivals.\n\nSivagiri.\u2014Town in Tinnevelly District, Madras. Lat. 9\u00b0 20' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 28' E.; pop. (1871), 13,274, inhabiting 3237 houses. Sivagiri is the headquarters of a zamindari of the same name, which pays a peshkash (revenue) to Government of \u00a35458. The cattle here are of a superior breed.\n\nSivakasi.\u2014Town in Tinnevelly District, Madras. Lat. 9\u00b0 27' 10\"\nSIVASAMUDRAM ISLAND.\n\nN., long. 77\u00b0 50' 20\" E.; pop. (1871), 10,153, inhabiting 2422 houses. Active trade with Travancore, chiefly in tobacco.\n\nSivasamudram (or Sivan\u00e1samudaram, lit. 'Sea of Siva').\u2014Island formed by the branching of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river into two streams, each of which makes a descent of about 200 feet in a series of picturesque rapids and waterfalls; situated in the Madras District of Coimbatore, just outside the frontier of Mysore; about 3 miles long, by \u00bc of a mile broad. The island is properly called Heggura, but the name of Sivasamudram is derived from an ancient city (lat. 12\u00b0 16' N., long. 77\u00b0 14' E.), of which a few remains lie strewed around. This city is said to have been founded in the 16th century by Ganga R\u00e1j\u00e1, a scion of the Vijayanagar line. His dynasty only endured for two generations; and the tragic story of its end is locally associated with the various spots that make up the picturesque scenery of the waterfalls. In 1791, at the time of the advance of the British army, under Lord Cornwallis, upon Seringapatam, Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n laid waste the surrounding country, and drove all the inhabitants and the cattle into this island. Subsequently the whole area became overgrown with jungle, and the old stone bridges connecting it with the mainland were impassable. About 1824, their repair was undertaken by a confidential servant of the Residency of Mysore, named R\u00e1masw\u00e1mi Mudaliy\u00e1r. He expended several thousand pounds on the work, and was rewarded by the British Government with the title of Janopak\u00e1ra K\u00e1mkart\u00e1, or Public Benefactor. He also received a j\u00e1gir or rent-free estate from the British Government, with a rental of \u00a3800 a year, and seven villages from the Mysore State, yielding an additional \u00a3900. The new bridges are built on pillars of hewn stone founded in the rocky bed of the stream, and connected by stone girders. A bungalow has also been erected by the j\u00e1girrddr, where European visitors are entertained. The most favourable time to visit the falls is in the rainy season, as during the winter months the island is malarious. On the western branch of the river, which forms the boundary between Mysore and Coimbatore, are the Gagani Chukki Falls, about 2 miles below the bungalow. The waters divide round a small island called Ettikur, and dash with deafening roar over vast boulders of rock in a cloud of foam. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton wrote: 'I have never seen any cataract that for grandeur could be compared with this.' The falls on the eastern branch of the river, called the Bar Chukki, are more easily accessible, and display a yet greater volume of water. In the rainy season an unbroken sheet, a quarter of a mile wide, pours over the rocks; but during the dry months this separates into several distinct cascades. In the centre is a horseshoe recess, down which the principal stream falls, and having been collected into a narrow gorge, rushes forward to again precipitate itself 30 feet into the deep pool below.\nSiwalik Hills.\u2014Mountain range in Dehr\u00e1 D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces, and in S\u00edrm\u00far State and Hushi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab; lying between $29^\\circ 58' 4\"$ and $30^\\circ 23'$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 45'$ and $78^\\circ 11' 28\"$ E. long. The chain runs parallel with the Him\u00e1layan system, from Hardw\u00e1r on the Ganges to the banks of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s). Geologically speaking, it belongs to the tertiary deposits of the outer Him\u00e1layas; and it is chiefly composed of low sandstone and conglomerate hills, the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range in its rear. Rising from the bed of the Ganges, at the point where that river debouches upon the plains of Sah\u00e1ranpur, the Siwalik chain runs across Dehr\u00e1 D\u00fan District in a north-westerly direction, till it dips again for a while into the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) valley. The northern slope leads gently down into the vale of Dehr\u00e1 D\u00fan, a beautiful glen or depression between the Him\u00e1layas and their outlying Siwalik subordinates; but southward, a steep and bold escarpment falls abruptly toward the Sah\u00e1ranpur plain. A thick forest of sal and sain clothes the lower sides, while on the higher crests pine woods indicate a cooler climate. Wild elephants abound; and the fauna in this section also includes tigers, sloth-bears, leopards, hyenas, spotted deer, pigs, and monkeys. Beyond the Jumna, the Siwalik chain once more rises up in S\u00edrm\u00far State, the valley to the north, in continuation of that of Dehr\u00e1, here bearing the name of the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan. Thence it passes through the Simla Hill States, dips so as to allow the passage of the Sutlej (Satlaj) through a depression in its line, and rises once more in British territory in Hushi\u00e1rpur District. The range runs in the same general direction till it reaches the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) basin, where it terminates near Dit\u00e1rpur, in a cluster of round undulating hills, crowned by the Government bamboo forests of Bin-dr\u00e1ban and Karampur. The intermediate valley between the Siwaliks and the Him\u00e1layas, in Hushi\u00e1rpur District, is known as the Jaswan D\u00fan. After leaving the Sutlej, the range becomes more and more a mere broad tableland, at first enclosed by sandy hillocks, but finally spreading out into minor spurs of irregular formation. This portion of the chain consists of a barren soil, rarely interspersed with patches of forest or cultivated fields. The total length of the range from the Ganges to the Beas is about 200 miles, and its average breadth about 10 miles. The highest peaks have an elevation of about 3500 feet above the sea. The principal pass is that of Mohan in Dehr\u00e1 D\u00fan District, by which the main road from Sah\u00e1ranpur to Dehr\u00e1 and Mussooree (Masuri) traverses the range. All the great rivers which run at right angles to the Siwaliks\u2014the Ganges, Jumna, Sutlej, and Beas\u2014have worn themselves valleys through this chain. Its outlying continuation may be traced east of the Ganges for 600 miles, but of such inferior elevation as to attract little attention. The palaeontology of the Siwaliks possesses unusual interest from the abundant fossil\nremains of large vertebrates, especially mammals. The most remarkable are the sivatherium\u2014a gigantic ruminant, whose dimensions exceeded those of the rhinoceros\u2014and various quadrupeds, whose occurrence in tertiary deposits was first noticed among these hills.\n\n**Siy\u00e1na (Siana).**\u2014Ancient town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 37\u2032 55\u2033 N., and long. 78\u00b0 6\u2032 20\u2033 E., on a raised site, near the An\u00fapshahr branch of the Ganges Canal; 19 miles north-east of Bulandshahr town, on the Garhmukteswar road. Pop. (1872), 6268, consisting of 4095 Hindus and 2173 Muhammadans. Anciently known as Sainban or \u2018the forest of rest,\u2019 because B\u00e1l\u00e1r\u00e1m, on his way from Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) to Hastin\u00e1pur, slept here one night, and was hospitably entertained by fak\u00edrs, who had excavated a tank in the centre of a vast forest. The name was changed to Siy\u00e1na under the rule of the Dor R\u00e1jputs, who were succeeded by the Taga Br\u00e1hmans, and still later by the Shaikhs under Abdul Fath, a fak\u00edr, in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. Capital of a mah\u00e1l in Akbar\u2019s time, but now a poor collection of mud huts. Indigo factory, trade in safflower. Police station, post office, village school.\n\n**Skardo.**\u2014Town in Balti State, Kashmir.\u2014See ISKARDOH.\n\n**Soane.**\u2014River and canal in Bengal.\u2014See Son.\n\n**Sobn\u00e1l\u00ed.**\u2014River of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; also known as the Kundri\u00e1 and the Bengdaha, and in its lower reaches as the Gunti\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed. It takes its rise from a number of small water-courses in the Bayr\u00e1 marsh, near the village of B\u00e1lti\u00e1, and, after a south-easterly course, ultimately joins the Kholpetua. The Sobn\u00e1l\u00ed is so called from its passing the large village of that name. It forms one of the principal boat routes between Calcutta and the eastern Districts.\n\n**Sobr\u00e1n.**\u2014Village in Lahore District, Punjab; situated on the west bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), in lat. 31\u00b0 7\u2032 N., and long. 74\u00b0 54\u2032 E., near the south-east corner of the District. Pop. (1868), 3793. Opposite this village, on the east bank of the river, in Firozpur District, lies the famous battle-field where Sir Hugh (afterwards Lord) Gough gained his decisive victory of 10th February 1846, which brought to a close the first Sikh war, and led to the occupation of Lahore by a British force. The Sikhs had taken up a strong position on the east side of the Sutlej, protecting the Harf\u00ed ford, while their rear rested upon the village of Sobr\u00e1n. The battle took place on the Firozpur side, where the Sikhs gallantly held their earthworks until almost their last man had fallen. Comparatively few made their way back across the river. This battle immediately cleared the whole left bank of the Sutlej of the Sikh force, and the victorious army crossed into the Punjab by a bridge of boats opposite Firozpur, and took possession of Lahore.\n\n**Soh\u00e1g.**\u2014Canal in Lahore and Montgomery Districts, Punjab, one\nof the 'Upper Sutlej Inundation Canals.' Lat. $30^\\circ 28'$ to $30^\\circ 43'$ N., long. $73^\\circ 24'$ to $74^\\circ 15'$ E. Has its headwaters from the Sutlej (Satlaj) in the village of Bhaddru, Lahore, whence it flows on to P\u00e1kpatan in Montgomery, and then loses itself in the sands. Dry except in the rainy season, it brings down a considerable body of water during inundations, and is of great value to the lowlands through which it passes, and to which it affords a means of irrigation. In 1827, Sard\u00e1r Govind Sinh, of Mokhal, a large resident proprietor, compelled the people to repair the canal, which was done with forced labour. In 1855, Colonel Anderson connected it with the Sutlej, since which time a fair supply of water has been obtained. The canal irrigates 23 estates. A second channel, the Lower Sohag Canal, is confined to Montgomery District. Formerly the bed of a hill stream, it remained dry for many years, till a K\u00e1rd\u00e1r of Hir\u00e1li joined it to the Sutlej, by a cut of about 3 miles in length. The supply of water is very precarious, the head near the Sutlej silting up almost every year.\n\n**Soh\u00e1gpur.**\u2014Eastern tahsil or Subdivision of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces. Area, 1067 square miles; pop. (1872), 118,963, residing in 398 villages or townships and 23,261 houses.\n\n**Soh\u00e1gpur.**\u2014Town in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 52'$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 1'$ E., on the high-road from Bombay, 30 miles east of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Pop. (1872), 7552, a large portion of whom are Muhammadans. The stone fort, now dismantled, was built about 1790, by Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, a Muhamadan j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r, who held the country round for the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur. In 1803, Waz\u00edr Muhammad of Bhop\u00e1l attacked the fort without success. The town had for about ten years a mint, which struck a rupee worth 13 annas, now very rare. Manufactures, silk-weaving and lac-melting. Soh\u00e1gpur contains a tahs\u00edli, police station-house, and a good sardi (native inn); and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway has a station at the town (distance from Bombay 494 miles). Six miles to the east, at the large village of Sobh\u00e1pur, an important weekly market is held, with a large trade in country cloth from Narsinpur and elsewhere. A Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 lives at Sobh\u00e1pur.\n\n**Soh\u00e1n.**\u2014River in R\u00e1wal Pindi and Jhelum (Jh\u00edlam) Districts, Punjab. Rises in the Murree (Marri) Hills a few miles from the sanatorium of Murree, in lat. $33^\\circ 52'$ N., and long. $73^\\circ 27'$ E., and flows down deep valleys for the first 10 miles of its course, till it reaches the plains near the ruined Ghakkar fortress at Pharw\u00e1la. Thence it takes a south-westerly direction, and finally joins the Indus 10 miles below Mokhad. A magnificent bridge conveys the Grand Trunk Road across the stream, 3 miles east of R\u00e1wal Pindi. Quicksands are numerous in the river bed, and often dangerous in the lower part, occasionally swallowing up even elephants. Fordable except in the floods; no ferries.\nThe waters are but little diverted for mills, and hardly at all for irrigation, as the heavy inundations prevent the construction of permanent cuts. Innumerable torrents empty themselves into the channel from ravines on either side, and carry off the drainage of the surrounding country.\n\n**Soh\u00e1wal**\u2014Native State in B\u00e1ghelkhand, under the political superintendence of the B\u00e1ghelkhand Agency and the Central India Agency. The territories of the State lie in two distinct patches, separated from each other by Kothi; the northern portion is also so intermixed with lands belonging to Panna, that it is difficult to calculate the area of Soh\u00e1wal accurately. It is probably about 300 square miles; and the population is estimated at 55,000. The gross revenue amounts to about \u00a310,000, but two-thirds of this have been alienated in rent-free tenures and religious and charitable grants, leaving the chief an estimated revenue of \u00a33200 with which to conduct the administration. The State of Soh\u00e1wal was formerly a portion of Rewah territory; but about the middle of the 16th century, when Amar Sinh was ruler of Rewah, his son Fateh Sihn threw off his father's authority and established his independence as Chief of Soh\u00e1wal. His descendant, L\u00e1l Aman Sinh, was found in possession on the British occupation of B\u00e1ghelkhand, and was consequently confirmed in his State, on his tendering a deed of allegiance. In consequence of the improvidence and misrule of its chiefs, the State has more than once come under British management. It was last made over in 1871, free of debt, to the present R\u00e1\u00eds of Soh\u00e1wal, L\u00e1l Sher Jang Bah\u00e1dur Sinh, who is by race a B\u00e1ghel R\u00e1jput, and was born about 1851. A small police force is maintained of about 50 men.\n\n**Soh\u00e1wal**\u2014Chief town of Soh\u00e1wal State, B\u00e1ghelkhand, Central India; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 34\u2032 35\u2033 N., and long. 80\u00b0 48\u2032 50\u2033 E., not far from the line of railway between Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the river Sutri, which is here crossed by a ford. Elevation above the sea, 1059 feet. Thornton states that this town was formerly defended by a fort, which is now in ruins.\n\n**Sohi-ong**\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam; presided over by a lyng-doh. Pop. (1872), 1951.\n\n**Sohna**\u2014Town and sulphur spring in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 14\u2032 N., and long. 77\u00b0 7\u2032 E., at the foot of the Mew\u00e1t Hills. Pop. (1868), 7507, consisting of 3705 Hindus, 2162 Muhamm\u00e1dans, and 1640 \u2018others.\u2019 Ancient R\u00e1jput settlement, first of Hindus, then of Musalm\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, whose prosperity is attested by numerous old mosques. The original proprietors, however, who had settled in Jullundur (Jalandhar) after their expulsion from Sohna, being directed in a dream by their patron saint, set out once more to recover their patrimony, and, after a bloody battle (circa 1160), regained possession of the town, which their descendants still hold. On the British conquest in 1803, the J\u00e1ts of Bhartpur were found in power. Sohna owes its chief\nimportance to its hot sulphurous spring, issuing from the foot of the Mew\u00e1t Hills, and enclosed by a substantial reservoir, covered in with a dome-shaped roof. Several tanks for medicinal bathing surround the central building. The water has a temperature varying from $115^\\circ$ F., and it is considered a specific for the well-known 'Delhi ulcers.' A large bath has been constructed for the use of Europeans.\n\n**Sojima.**\u2014Town in Kaira District, Bombay. Lat. $22^\\circ 32'$ N., long. $72^\\circ 46'$ E.; pop. (1872), 11,322.\n\n**Solan.**\u2014Small cantonment and hill sanatorium in Simla District, Punjab; situated in lat. $30^\\circ 55'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 9'$ E., on the southern slope of the Krol Mountain, on the cart-road between K\u00e1lka and Simla, 30 miles from the latter station. Ground acquired for a rifle range in 1863-64; barracks afterwards erected, which accommodated in 1874 a battalion of European troops.\n\n**Sol\u00e1ni.**\u2014River in Sah\u00e1ranpur and Muzaffarnagar Districts, North-Western Provinces. Rises in the Siw\u00e1lik Hills, from the Mohan Pass, flows in a general south-westerly direction, and falls into the Ganges, after a total course of about 55 miles. A magnificent aqueduct of brickwork, with 15 arches, each 50 feet in span, conveys the waters of the Ganges Canal across the valley of this river near Rurki (Roorkee), and the Sol\u00e1ni itself flows through the open passage beneath. In Muzaffarnagar District, the Sol\u00e1ni formerly occupied a deep channel of its own; but of late years it has turned aside into a long line of marshy lakes (jihls), which mark the ancient bed of the Ganges. The *pargana* of Gordhanpur, which comprises the delta between the Sol\u00e1ni and the Ganges, consists in great part of swamps fed by the overflow from this river, and the percolation from the Ganges Canal. Efforts have been made by the Irrigation Department to check the inundation, and drain the swampy area, but hitherto with only partial success.\n\n**Solavand\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Madura District, Madras.\u2014See SHOLAVANDAN.\n\n**Som\u00e1stipur.**\u2014Trading village in Darbhanga District, Bengal; situated on the south bank of the Bur\u00ed Gandak river, about 2 miles west of Nagarbasti, on the road from T\u00e1jpur to Ruser\u00e1. Large export of *gh\u00ed*. Oil-seeds are also exported, and food grains and salt received in exchange.\n\n**Someswari.**\u2014River in Garo Hills District, Assam.\u2014See SAMESWARI.\n\n**Somn\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces; situated $14\\frac{1}{2}$ miles north-west of Aligarh town, on the Delhi road. A station on the East Indian Railway, 889 miles from Calcutta (Howrah), and 65 from Delhi. Pop. (1872), 2033. Police station; post office.\n\n**Somn\u00e1th** (*Deo Pattan, Prabh\u00e1s Pattan, Ver\u00e1wal Pattan, or Pattan Somndth).*\u2014Ancient town, situated in lat. $22^\\circ 7'$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 34'$ E.,\nat the eastern extremity of a bay on the south coast of the Peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay. The western headland of the same bay is occupied by the port of Ver\u00e1wal, which gives to the locality its more common name of Ver\u00e1wal Pattan. On the edge of the sea, nearly half-way between the two towns, stands a large and conspicuous temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Siva. A few hundred yards behind this temple is the reservoir called Bh\u00e1t Kund, the traditional scene of the death of Sr\u00ed Krishna. Farther inland rises the wild hill district called the Gir, and in the remote distance stands out the sacred mountain which the people of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r delight to call the royal Girn\u00e1r. The country near Somn\u00e1th is full of memorials of Krishna, the principal centre of interest being a spot to the east of the city, where, near the union of three beautiful streams, the body of the hero is said to have been burnt. Somn\u00e1th is a gloomy place\u2014a city of ruins and graves. On the west, the plain is covered with Mus\u00e1l-m\u00e1n tombs; on the east are numerous Hindu shrines and monuments. The city was protected on the south by a fort, and on the remaining three sides by a deep trench cut out of the solid rock. The fort, situated on the shore within a few feet of high water-mark, does not depart in any important particular from the general design of Guzerat fortresses. It is square in form, with large gateways in the centre of each side, outworks or barbicans in front of these, and second gateways in the sides of the outworks. Before its capture by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed (1024-1026 A.D.), little is known of the history of Somn\u00e1th. In the 8th century, this part of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is said to have been in the hands of a line of R\u00e1jput princes bearing the surname of Ch\u00e1nda. These chiefs probably owned allegiance to that powerful R\u00e1jput family, the Ch\u00e1lukyas or Solankis, who reigned at Kaly\u00e1n, near Bedar, in the Deccan.\n\nSomn\u00e1thpur.\u2014Village in Mysore District, Mysore State; celebrated for its temple of Prasanna Chenna Kesava. According to an inscription at the entrance, it was completed in 1270 by a prince of the Ball\u00e1l\u00e1 dynasty. The whole is most elaborately ornamented; and the structure is completed by three sim\u00e1nas or pyramidal towers surmounting the triple shrine. Round the exterior base are portrayed the leading incidents in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, and Bh\u00e1gavata, carved in relief in potstone, the termination of each chapter and section being indicated respectively by a closed and half-closed door. The number of separate sculptured images is 74. The workmanship is attributed to Jackan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, the famous sculptor and architect of the Ball\u00e1l\u00e1 kings, under whom Hindu art in Mysore reached its culminating point. There is also at Somn\u00e1thpur a large temple of Siva in ruins.\n\nSomsa Parwat.\u2014Peak of the Western Gh\u00e1ts in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras; 6300 feet high. Lat. 13\u00b0 8' N., long. 75\u00b0 18' E. The\nhill is used as a sanatorium by the people of South K\u00e1nara; there are two or three bungalows, but no village; easy access by road (40 miles) from Mangalore. The climate, except from June to September, during the south-west monsoon, is delicious, and for sportsmen there is abundance of game. Wood, water, and grass are also plentiful. There is no plateau, properly speaking, but undulating ground along the line of the mountain for some miles. English fruits, flowers, and vegetables grow well, and in most respects the climate and soil resemble those of Kunur (Coonoor).\n\n**Son** *(Soane or Sone; said to be derived from the Sanskrit Sona, 'crimson').\u2014A great river of Central India, and (excluding the Jumna) the chief tributary of the Ganges on its right bank. It rises in 22\u00b0 41' N. lat., and 82\u00b0 7' E. long., in the Amarkantak highlands, about 3500 feet above the sea. This tableland also supplies the sister sources of the Narbada and the Mahanadi, and is included in a tract of wild country recently transferred to the State of Rewah. Thence the Son flows in a generally northern direction, often forming the boundary between the Central Provinces and the States comprised in the Baghelkhand Agency, through an intricate maze of hills, until it strikes upon the Kaimur range, which here constitutes the southern wall of the Gangetic plain. At this point, in 24\u00b0 5' N. lat., and 81\u00b0 6' E. long., it is diverted to the east, and holds that direction in a tolerably straight course until it ultimately falls into the Ganges, about 10 miles above Din\u00e1pur, in 25\u00b0 41' 30\" N. lat., and 84\u00b0 52' E. long., after a total length of about 465 miles. Its upper course, of about 300 miles, lies in a wild hilly country, which has been but imperfectly explored. In its lower section, of about 160 miles, it first flows across the British District of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur in the North-Western Provinces, and then, passing into Behar, separates Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d from Gay\u00e1 and Patn\u00e1. Its principal tributaries are\u2014on the left bank, the Johila and Mah\u00e1nadi, both in the upper portion of its course; and on the right bank, the Gopat, Rehand, Kanhar, and Koel, the last of which, and by far the most important, falls into it nearly opposite the famous hill fort of Rohtasgarh. There are no towns on its banks, nor even commercial marts of any magnitude. So far as regards navigation, its stream is mainly used for floating down large rafts of bamboos and a little timber. An estimate from Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d gives the total number of bamboos thus exported as 4,000,000. In the rainy season, native boats of large tonnage occasionally proceed for a short distance up stream; but navigation is even then rendered dangerous by the extraordinary violence of the flood, and during the rest of the year becomes impossible, owing to the small depth of water. The utility of the Son for irrigation will be dwelt upon at length in the following article. The fish found in this river are said to be superior to those of the Ganges.\nSON CANALS.\n\nIn the lower portion of its course, the Son is marked by several striking characteristics. Its bed is enormously wide, in some places stretching for 3 miles from bank to bank. During the greater part of the year this broad channel is merely a waste of drifting sand, with an insignificant stream that is nearly everywhere fordable. The discharge of water at this time is estimated at only 620 cubic feet per second. But in the rainy season, and especially just after a storm has burst on the plateau of Central India, the river rises with incredible rapidity. The entire rainfall of an area of about 23,000 square miles requires to find an outlet by this channel, which frequently proves unable to carry off the total flood discharge, calculated at $1\\frac{3}{4}$ million cubic feet per second. These heavy floods are of short duration, seldom lasting more than four days; but in recent years they have wrought much destruction in the low-lying plains of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. Near the sight of the great dam at Dehri, the Son is crossed by the Grand Trunk Road on a stone causeway; and lower down, near Koelw\u00e1r, the East Indian Railway has been carried across on a lattice girder bridge. This bridge, begun for a single line of rails in 1855, and finally completed for a double line in 1870, has a total length of 4199 feet from back to back of the abutments, divided among 28 spans, which stand upon piers sunk in wells 30 feet below the level of low water.\n\nThe Son possesses historical interest as being probably identical with the Erannoboas of Greek geographers. Arrian and Strabo, both apparently repeating the description of an eye-witness Megasthenes, represent Palibothra, the capital of Magadha in the 3rd century B.C., as standing near the confluence of the Erannoboas with the Ganges. The Erannoboas they also agree in calling the third largest river in India, next after the Ganges and the Indus. Now, Palibothra is undoubtedly the same as the P\u00e1taliputra of the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Thsang, and the modern Patn\u00e1. Some authorities, including in recent times Mr. Beglar, Assistant to the Archaeological Surveyor, have been disposed to find the Erranoboas in the Gandak or Hiranya-vati. But General Cunningham himself, here following the arguments of Mr. Ravenshaw, has no hesitation in identifying the Erranoboas with the Son, which anciently bore the name of Hiranya-bdh\u00fa, or \u2018the golden armed\u2019 (a title of Siva). In addition, we know that the junction of the Son with the Ganges has been gradually receding farther westwards. Old channels of the Son have been found between B\u00e1\u0144kipur and Din\u00e1pur, and even below the present site of Patn\u00e1. In the Bengal Atlas of 1772, the junction is marked near Maner, and it would seem to have been at the same spot in the 17th century. It is now about 10 miles higher up the Ganges.\n\nSon Canals.\u2014A grand system of irrigation works in the Province of Behar, taking its name from the Son river. It consists of a series of\ncanals in the three districts of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Gay\u00e1, and Patn\u00e1, which all branch off from an anicut or dam thrown across the Son at the village of Dehri. The project dates from 1855, when Colonel Dickens, on behalf of the East India Irrigation Company, proposed the construction of canals, both for irrigation and navigation, from Chan\u00e1r to Patn\u00e1\u2014a scheme subsequently extended to M\u00edrz\u00e1pur on the west, and Monghyr on the east. In 1867, the Company obtained the sanction of Government to their plans, on the understanding that their concession would fail if they did not make satisfactory progress. Beyond applying for a guarantee of interest on their capital, the Company scarcely commenced operations; and finally, in 1867, their claims were bought up by Government, who forthwith took up the enterprise in earnest, though with curtailed designs.\n\nThe general plan of the works comprises the Dehri anicut, a Main Western Canal, branching off from the anicut on the left bank, and a Main Eastern Canal branching off on the right. As a matter of fact, these two main canals remain unfinished; and the actual working of the system is confined to their subordinate branches.\n\nDehri.\u2014The little village of Dehri, or Dehri gh\u00e1t, situated on the left bank of the river, near the 338th milestone from Calcutta on the Grand Trunk Road, is the headquarters of the engineering staff and a centre of great activity. Work was begun here in 1869 by the construction of a tramway to Dhodhand or Dhaudang in the neighbouring hills, whence all the building-stone has been brought. At the same time, the workshops were commenced, from the designs and under the supervision of Mr. Fouracres, whose originality and energy are impressed upon every department of the undertaking. These workshops are substantial stone buildings with iron roofs; they comprise a foundry, saw-mill, blacksmiths' and carpenters' shops, fitting-shop, and boatyard. They have turned out all the wood and iron work required for the canals, and also take private orders. In 1872, a training school was opened at Dehri for both Europeans and natives, with the object of providing a skilled staff of subordinates for the Public Works Department.\n\nThe Anicut or dam consists of a mass of masonry, 12,500 long by 120 feet broad, thrown across the main channel of the river. The foundations were formed by hollow blocks or wells, which sank by their own weight, while the sand was excavated from within. On these wells two solid walls were built, the upper or main wall to the height of 8 feet above the normal level of the river bed, the rear wall to the height of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The space between was filled up with rubble, faced on a sloping surface with hewn stone. To provide for superfluous water in time of flood three sets of sluices have been inserted, one in the middle of the weir, and one at either side. The two latter are\nSON CANALS.\n\nalso intended, by their scouring action, to prevent the mouths of the canals from silting up. Each of these sets of sluices contains 22 vents of 20\u00bd feet span, fitted with iron shutters, which open and shut by means of an ingenious system of self-acting machinery. The total cost of the anicut was about \u00a3150,000 up to 1875, in which year it was declared to be finished. The highest floods since recorded have risen nearly 6 feet above the crest of the work, but no damage has been done to the main structure.\n\nThe Western Main Canal branches off from the left bank of the river immediately above the anicut. It is intended to irrigate a total area of 1,200,000 acres. Its dimensions at starting are\u2014breadth at base, 180 feet; depth of water in full supply, 9 feet; thus giving a maximum capacity of 451 cubic feet of water per second. At present, this canal is chiefly used to supply the Arrah and the Bax\u00e1r and Chaus\u00e1 Canals, which all branch off within the first 12 miles. The main canal is continued for a total distance of 22 miles, as far as the Grand Trunk Road, 2 miles beyond Sasseram. Its prolongation for a farther distance of 50 miles to the frontier of the District, towards Mirzapur, was commenced as a relief work during the scarcity of 1874-75. The chief engineering work is the siphon-aqueduct of 25 arches, by which a formidable hill torrent called the K\u00e1o is carried under the canal.\n\nThe Arrah Canal branches off from the preceding at its 5th mile, and is estimated to carry 1616 cubic feet of water per second. It follows the course of the Son for 30 miles, and then strikes northwards, running on a natural ridge past the town of Arrah, and finally falls into a branch of the Ganges after a total course of 60 miles. It is designed for navigation as well as irrigation; but up to the present time no permanent communication has been opened with the main stream of the Ganges. To overcome the total fall of 180 feet, 13 locks have been constructed. This canal commands a total area of 441,500 acres, which is estimated to be equally divided between kharif and rabi crops. Besides four principal distributaries, its main offshoots are the Bihiy\u00e1 Canal, 30\u00bd miles long; and the D\u00famr\u00e1on Canal, 40\u00bd miles long.\n\nThe Bax\u00e1r Canal leaves the Main Western Canal at its 12th mile, and is estimated to carry 1260 cubic feet of water per second. It communicates with the Ganges at Bax\u00e1r, after a course of 55 miles, and is also intended for navigation. Its continuation, known as the Chaus\u00e1 Canal, has an additional length of 40 miles. The two together command an area of 309,500 acres. The total fall is 159 feet, which is overcome by 12 locks.\n\nThe Eastern Main Canal takes off from the right bank of the river, just opposite the mouth of the Western Canal. It was originally\nintended to run as far as Monghyr, but at present it stops short at the P\u00fanp\u00fan river, a total length of only 8 miles.\n\nThe Patn\u00e1 Canal leaves the preceding at its 4th mile, and follows the course of the Son till it joins the Ganges near the jail at Digah, between Bankipur and Dinapur. Its total length is 79 miles, of which 43 miles lie within the District of Gay\u00e1, and 36 in Patn\u00e1. It commands a total area of about 780 square miles, or 499,200 acres. It was opened for navigation in October 1877, but its utility for irrigation has been delayed by the failure of a contractor to complete the minor distributaries.\n\nFinancial Aspects.\u2014Up to the close of the year 1877-78, the total outlay for works, establishments, tools, and plant amounted to \u00a31,908,504. This is the capital amount on which interest is charged; but the actual expenditure on all heads at the same date was \u00a32,736,350. The total estimate sanctioned is \u00a33,173,034. It is still premature to anticipate what the future income will be; but the experience of two recent years of scarcity\u20141873-74 and 1877-78\u2014proves that the agriculture of this tract has now been saved from the former risk of uncertainty. In 1873-74, when even the main channels were unfinished, water was passed through them sufficient to irrigate nearly 160,000 acres, thus increasing the food supply by an amount estimated at 70,000 tons, and valued at \u00a348,000. Again, in 1877-78, when the incomplete state of the distributaries on the Patn\u00e1 Canal prevented the enforcement of a water rate, the total area irrigated rose to nearly 300,000 acres, of which 64,000 acres were free. The following rates have been fixed for the future:\u2014For the kharif or winter crop, R. 1. 8. (3s.) per acre; for the rabi or spring crop, Rs. 2. 4. (4s. 6d.) per acre. These rates apply only to leases for three years, and a certain proportion of the total village area must be assessed in each case. For annual leases, the rate is Rs. 2. 8. (5s.) per acre for both kharif and rabi. In the year 1877-78, out of a total irrigated area of 288,596 acres, 149,894 acres were kharif and 138,702 rabi. The total assessment for that year amounted to \u00a315,000, but only \u00a35965 was collected. Navigation is gradually developing in a satisfactory manner. In 1877-78, a total length of 87 miles was open for traffic; the receipts from tolls were \u00a32677; the tonnage of boats is returned at 82,000 tons, valued at \u00a3128,000. The following is the balance-sheet for the year 1877-78:\u2014Water rates, \u00a35965; navigation, \u00a32677; miscellaneous, \u00a31487; total income, less refunds, \u00a310,054; maintenance, \u00a321,083; management, \u00a34083; total working expenses, \u00a325,166, showing a deficit of \u00a315,112. The expenditure on capital account in the year was \u00a3169,132.\n\nSon\u00e1g\u00e1on.\u2014Large village in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 38' N., and long. 78\u00b0 45' 30\" E., 13 miles west of\nWardh\u00e1. An ancient fair takes place every June and October, in honour of the image of the god Murl\u00eddh\u00e1r. The fort was built a century ago by an ancestor of the present M\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs.\n\n**Sonah.\u2014** Town and sulphur springs in Gurg\u00e1o District, Punjab. \u2014 See Sohna.\n\n**Sonai.\u2014** Town in Ahmednagar District, Bombay; situated in lat. 19\u00b0 23' N., and long. 74\u00b0 54' E., about 24 miles north by east of Ahmednagar town. Pop. (1872), 5254. Post office.\n\n**Son\u00e1i.\u2014** Important navigable channel in Nowgong District, Assam, which issues from the Brahmaputra, and, after a winding course in a south-westerly direction, finally falls into the Kalang, itself a similar offshoot from the Brahmaputra. It contains 6 feet of water all the year round, and the current is sluggish.\n\n**Son\u00e1i.\u2014** Hill stream in C\u00e1ch\u00e1r District, Assam, which rises in the Lush\u00e1i Hills, and flows due north into the Bar\u00e1k at Son\u00e1mukh, the headquarters of the timber trade.\n\n**Son\u00e1khan.\u2014** Estate in Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces; 60 miles south-east of Bil\u00e1spur town; comprising two small fertile villages, surrounded by hills. N\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1n Sinh, the chief, rebelled in 1857, and was executed, and his estate confiscated. The tenantry withdrew in a body, and the tract was left a desert, until, some years ago, part was taken as a waste-land grant by a European gentleman. The village of Son\u00e1khan lies in lat. 21\u00b0 31' N., and long. 82\u00b0 37' E.\n\n**Son\u00e1mganj (or Sund\u00e1mganj).\u2014** Village with river trade in Sylhet District, Assam; situated on the left or south bank of the Surm\u00e1 river, opposite the confluence of a stream flowing down from the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills. The exports are rice, limestone, dried fish, and tezpd\u00ed or bay-leaves; the imports\u2014cotton goods, salt, sugar, spices, etc. The Bengal registration returns for 1876-77 show an export of 6600 maunds of jute. The th\u00e1nd or police circle of Son\u00e1mganj has a population (1872) of 60,519.\n\n**Son\u00e1mukh\u00ed.\u2014** Village in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; recently transferred from B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District. Lat. 23\u00b0 18' 20\" N., long. 87\u00b0 27' 15\" E. Formerly the site of a commercial residency and of an important factory of the East India Company, where numbers of weavers were employed in cotton-spinning and cloth-making. The introduction of English piece-goods led to the abandonment of these industries, the native fabrics not being able to compete with the imported European article; and from that time the prosperity of this place has declined. Police station. Pop. (1872) under 5000.\n\n**Son\u00e1pur.\u2014** Market village in K\u00e1mr\u00edp District, Assam. Lat. 26\u00b0 16' 20\" N., long. 91\u00b0 40' 10\" E. A considerable centre of local trade, conducted by M\u00e1rv\u00e1rf merchants.\n\n**Son\u00e1pur.\u2014** Village in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras. Lat. 19\u00b0 6' 30\" N., long. 84\u00b0 50' 40\" E.; pop. (1871), 1597, residing in 328 houses.\nSONARGAON\u2014SONGIR.\n\ndecaying seaport, but formerly of importance. Its trade (with that of Mansurkota) has been absorbed by the rising port of Gop\u00e1lpur.\n\n**Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on.**\u2014The ancient Muhammadan capital of Eastern Bengal, but now an insignificant village, called Pain\u00e1m, in Dacca District, Bengal; situated about 2 miles from the Brahmaputra, in lat. 23\u00b0 39' 45\" N., and long. 90\u00b0 38' 20\" E. The village is completely concealed in a grove of palms and other trees, and is surrounded by a deep muddy ditch, originally a moat. It was formerly famous for the manufacture of a fine description of muslin. In the vicinity of Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on are the ruins of several mosques, but the place does not appear to have ever had any pretensions to architectural grandeur. Being the residence of the Musalm\u00e1n governors, who were generally sons of the reigning king, this village was frequently the centre of rebellion; and it was here that Azim Sh\u00e1h, the son of Sikandar, proclaimed his independence, and invited the poet H\u00e1fiz to his court. The town gave its name to one of the three great sark\u00e1rs or Provinces into which Muhammad Tughlak divided Eastern Bengal in 1330. So long as Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on remained the capital, it was a place of considerable trading importance, and formed the terminus of the Grand Trunk Road made by Sher Sh\u00e1h.\n\n**Sonbars\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated 10 miles north-east of Ballia. Pop. (1872), 7162.\n\n**Sonepat.**\u2014Municipal town in Delhi District, Punjab.\u2014See SONPAT.\n\n**Songarh.**\u2014Hill fort in Baroda State, Guzerat, Bombay; situated on a hill to the west of the once walled town of Songarh. It was originally seized from the Bhils, some families of whom still hold j\u00e1girs in connection with it. In the lower part of the enclosed space are the ruins of what must once have been a handsome palace.\n\n**Songarh.**\u2014One of the petty States in Gohelw\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 1 village, with 3 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3200; of which \u00a350 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a37 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Song\u00edr.**\u2014Municipal town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 8' N., and long. 75\u00b0 4' E., 12 miles north of Dhulia. Pop. (1872), 4618. Song\u00edr, like Dhulia, has passed through the hands of the Arab kings, the Mughals, and the Niz\u00e1m. From the Niz\u00e1m it came to the Peshw\u00e1, who granted it to the Vinchurkar, from whom it fell into the hands of the British Government in 1818. Not long after the occupation of Song\u00edr by the British, the Arab soldiers, of whom there were many at that time in Kh\u00e1ndesh, made an attempt to recover the town; and did actually take possession of a portion of it, but were eventually repulsed and completely defeated. Song\u00edr has a local reputation for its brass and copper ware. Coarse woollen blankets and cotton cloths are also woven. Post office.\n**Sonmi\u00e1ni.\u2014Town and harbour in Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 27' N., and long. 66\u00b0 39' E., 70 miles south of Bel\u00e1, and 52 north-west of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) in Sind. Mr. Hughes, in his *Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n*, gives the following account of the place, which he describes as 'small and insignificant':\u2014**\n\n'It is seated at the northern extremity of a kind of bay, or large inlet of the sea. The harbour, situated also at the northern head of the bay, which, says Carless (who wrote upon this place many years ago), has been formed by the Pur\u00e1li river, is a large, irregular inlet, spreading out, like that at Kar\u00e1chi, in extensive swamps, and choked with shoals. It is at the southern portion of the Bay of Sonmi\u00e1ni, Pottinger believes, that the port of Alexander, so named by Nearchus, was situate, and that here his fleet, according to Arrian, remained for a considerable period. The channel leading into the harbour is extremely narrow, and has a depth of 16 or 17 feet at high water in the shallowest part; but it shifts its position every year, and vessels of any size could not navigate it without great difficulty until it had been buoyed off. Inside there are 6, 7, and even 10 fathoms in some places; but towards the town the channels become shallow, and the trading boats cannot approach nearer than a mile.'\n\nThe water supply is very bad. Trade now unimportant, though once considerable. Oil is manufactured from the *shira* or *shangruf* plant. During the recent military operations in Southern Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, Sonmi\u00e1ni has been used as a port of debarkation for stores and munitions of war, especially mules from Persia.\n\n**Sonpat.\u2014Municipal town in Delhi District, Punjab; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 59' 30\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 3' 30\" E., 25 miles north-west of Delhi city. Pop. (1868), 12,176, namely 4361 Hindus, 6236 Muhammadans, 11 Sikhs, and 1568 'others.' A town of great antiquity, said to have been founded by the earliest Aryan settlers. Popular tradition identifies it with one of the 'pats' demanded by Yudhisthira, in the *Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata*, from Duryodh\u00e1na as the price of peace. Picturesquely placed on the side of a small hill, evidently formed from the debris of buildings. The Jumna probably once flowed close beneath the walls. A terra-cotta figure of the sun, dug up in 1866, is pronounced by General Cunningham to be at least twelve centuries old. Several ancient buildings, none of architectural interest. Exports of coarse sugar to Rohtak and Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed; of cotton and red pepper to Delhi and B\u00e1ghpat. Police station, *s\u00e1rdi* (native inn), school-house. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3869, or 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population (13,637) within municipal limits.\n\n**Sonpur.\u2014Village in S\u00e1ran District, Bengal; perhaps the most widely known place in the District; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 41' 35\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 12' 50\" E., at the confluence of the Gandak and the Ganges. Famous for its great fair, held for ten days during the full-moon of**\nK\u00e1rtik. This is probably one of the oldest meld\u00e1s in India, its origin being said to be contemporaneous with R\u00e1ma and S\u00edt\u00e1. It was at Sonpur that Vishnu rescued an elephant, who had gone to drink, from the clutches of the crocodile. A temple was subsequently erected here by R\u00e1ma, when on his way to Janakpur to fight for S\u00edt\u00e1. Sonpur is considered to be a spot of exceptional holiness. The fair, attended by great numbers of persons, lasts a fortnight; but is at its height two days before, and two days after, the bathing in the Ganges. The chief articles of trade are elephants and horses and piece-goods. But the great attraction of Sonpur is the annual race meeting, the occasion of one of the most agreeable social gatherings for Europeans held throughout India. A large camp is pitched in a magnificent grove, which is especially reserved for this entertainment. There is also a fine race-course and stand, and the races last five or six days.\n\n**Sonpur.**\u2014Native State attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces, lying between 20\u00b0 40' and 21\u00b0 10' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 20' and 84\u00b0 18' E. long. Bounded on the north by Sambalpur District, on the east by Rair\u00e1khol, on the south by Bod, and on the west by Patn\u00e1. Pop. (1872), 130,713 (of whom 109,655 were Hindus), residing in 760 villages or townships and 34,580 houses, on an area of 906 square miles, of which 556 were cultivated in 1877, while of the portion lying waste 90 square miles were returned as cultivable. Density of population, 144\u00b727 per square mile. The country generally is flat, with isolated hills rising abruptly here and there. The Mah\u00e1nadi flows through the centre of the State, receiving the waters of the Tel and Suktel; to the north, the Jira river divides Sonpur from Sambalpur. The State contains no large forests, and such as exist do not yield any valuable timber. The soil is poor and sandy, but, owing to the numerous population, well cultivated. Rice forms the staple crop; but pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and cotton are also grown. Coarse country cloths constitute the only manufacture; and though iron-ore is found in many parts, no mines are regularly worked. The State contains no made roads; but the line which branches off from the R\u00e1ipur and Sambalpur road at Sohel\u00e1, southward to Cuttack, is continued through Sonpur, along the right bank of the Mah\u00e1nadi; and from Bod, 30 miles below Sonpur, there are bungalows every 10 miles. In the Mah\u00e1nadi, just opposite Sonpur, a dangerous rapid impedes navigation; nevertheless, by this river and the Tel, timber is floated down, and in good years rice and oil-seeds are also exported. Sonpur was originally a chiefship subordinate to Patn\u00e1; but was constituted a separate State by Madhukar S\u00e1, about 1560, and from that time formed one of the cluster known as the 'Ath\u00e1ra Garhj\u00e1t,' or Eighteen Strongholds. The succession has continued regularly from Madan Gop\u00e1l, the first R\u00e1j\u00e1, down to Nil\u00e1dri Sinh Deo Bah\u00e1dur, R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1877, who obtained the title of 'Bah\u00e1dur' for his\nSONPUR\u2014SORON.\n\nservices to the British Government in the field. The family is Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput. Estimated gross revenue, \u00a31800; tribute, \u00a3500. In 1872, 404 male persons not exceeding 20 years of age, and 174 persons above that age, one of whom was a female, were returned as able to read and write, or under instruction. The climate of Sonpur resembles that of Sambalpur, and is considered unhealthy.\n\n**Sonpur.**\u2014Chiefship in Chhindw\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; south-west of Har\u00e1i; comprising 49 villages. The chief is a Gond, and pays to Government an annual quit-rent of \u00a31. Sonpur village lies in lat. 22\u00b0 21' N., and long. 79\u00b0 3' E.\n\n**Sonsari.**\u2014Chiefship in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces; 14 miles north-north-east of Wair\u00e1garh; comprising 21 villages. The chief is a Halb\u00e1. Sonsari village lies in lat. 20\u00b0 31' N., and long. 80\u00b0 15' E.\n\n**Sooree.**\u2014Town in Birbh\u00fam District, Bengal.\u2014See Suri.\n\n**Sor\u00e1b.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Shimoga District, Mysore. Area, 271 square miles, of which 126 are cultivated; pop. (1871), 67,073, namely 64,385 Hindus, 2611 Muhammadans, 68 Jains, and 9 Christians. Land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rates, \u00a319,983, or 5s. 7d. per cultivated acre. The woodland scenery is marked by peculiar patches of forest called k\u00e1ns, on which grow groves of magnificent timber-trees, demarcated by sharp lines from the surrounding country. These k\u00e1ns are caused by corresponding depressions in the substratum of laterite, which permit a surface-soil of great depth to gather; whereas, over the rest of the country, the mould is only about 4 inches deep. Among the forest trees, the valuable wild pepper-vine grows in large quantities. The hollow valleys supply rich rice lands, and the inhabitants are generally prosperous. Wild animals are numerous, especially leopards. Iron-ore is largely smelted in certain localities.\n\n**Sor\u00e1b** ('The Cow of Plenty').\u2014Municipal village in Shimoga District, Mysore; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 2' 45\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 7' 55\" E., on the right bank of the Dandavati river, 46 miles north-west of Shimoga town. Headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name. Pop. (1871), 1364. Municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a3168; rate of taxation, 2s. 5d. per head. The principal centre of the industry of sandal-wood carving, for which the country round is celebrated. The g\u00fad\u00edgars or carvers chiefly manufacture boxes, caskets, and cabinets, which they cover with minute and complicated reliefs. The native designs consist of vegetation and scroll-work, interspersed with figures from the Hindu pantheon; but any European pattern can be copied to order. The workmanship is considered finer than that of Bombay or Canton, and commands a high price.\n\n**Sorashtra** (Sorath).\u2014Old name of KATHI\u00c1WAR.\n\n**Soron.**\u2014Municipal town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Pop. (1872), 11,182, consisting of 9554 Hindus, 1627 Muhammadans,\nand 1 Christian. Situated on the Burhganga, or ancient bed of the river Ganges, in lat. $27^\\circ 53' 40''$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 47' 35''$ E., on the Bareilly and H\u00e1thras road; distant from Etah town 27 miles north-east. A place of some pretensions as a trading mart; but chiefly important for its religious associations, and as the scene of frequent pilgrim fairs. Devout Hindus from all parts of India, after visiting Muttra (Mathur\u00e1), come on to Soron to bathe in the Burhganga, which here forms a considerable pool, lined with handsome temples and gh\u00e1ts. Half the Hindu population consists of Br\u00e1hmans, distinguished by wearing a scarlet pagri (head-dress). They derive a large income from donations sent from all parts of India, and also from annual tours among their pilgrim clients, as well as from the numerous festivals. A fine masonry bridge connects Soron with the opposite village of Badariya, and was supplemented in 1873 by a screw-pile bridge. The pool of the Burhganga consists of stagnant dirty water, except during the rains, when it becomes a running stream. Pipal trees surround the temples, which number 60 in all. Several handsome dharm\u00e1silas or rest-houses for pilgrims, exquisitely carved in Agra stone, attest the wealth and piety of pilgrims from Gwalior and Bhartpur. Police station, post office, Government charitable dispensary, and school.\n\nSoron is a place of great antiquity, originally known as Ukala-kshetra; but after the destruction of the demon Hiranyakasyapa by Vishnu in his boar avat\u00e1r, the name was changed to Sukara-kshetra. A mound, bearing the title of kil\u00e1 or fort, marks the site of the ancient town. The temple of S\u00edt\u00e1 R\u00e1mj\u00ed and the tomb of Shaikh Jam\u00e1l form the only buildings now standing upon this mound; but large antique bricks strew the ground on all sides, and the foundations of walls may be traced throughout. The temple was destroyed during the fanatical Musalm\u00e1n reign of Aurangzeb, but restored a few years since by a wealthy Bania, who built up the vacant interstices of the pillars with plain white-washed walls. The architectural features of the pillars resemble those of the Kutab at Delhi. Numerous inscriptions in the temple bear date from 1169 A.D. downward. Considerable trade in grain. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a31074; from taxes, \u00a3365, or 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population (13,658) within municipal limits.\n\n**Sounth.\u2014State and town in Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Bombay.\u2014See Sunth.**\n\n**South K\u00e1nara.\u2014District in Madras.\u2014See Kanara, South.**\n\n**South Marhatt\u00e1 J\u00e1girs, The.\u2014A group of Native States in Bombay, under the political superintendence of the Kolhapur Agency, comprising the following States:** Sangli, Jamkhandi, Miraj (Senior and Junior Branch), Kurandwar (Senior and Junior Branch), Mudhol, and Ramdurg. The j\u00e1girs of S\u00e1ngli, J\u00e1mkhandi, Miraj (2), and Kurandw\u00e1r (2) belong to Br\u00e1hman chiefs of the Patwardhan family; their territories are divided into a large number of isolated patches.\n\u2014one portion of the S\u00e1ngli State being close to the southern frontier of the Bombay Presidency, whilst another is on the river Bhima, near Pandharpur. The total population (1872) of the South Marhatt\u00e1 J\u00e1g\u00edrs is about 610,000. The lie partly in the old Hindu Province of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra, partly in that of the Karnatic; and the division of language on which these old Divisions were founded is still maintained, for of the population about 380,000 speak Kanarese and about 228,000 speak Marathi. Prior to 1812, the power of the Patwardhan family had for some years excited the jealously of the Peshw\u00e1, who had attempted to strip them of their rights; in that year, however, they were taken under the protection of the British Government.\n\nSouth-Western Frontier Agency.\u2014The name formerly given to the Chutia Nagpur Tributary States (vol. ii. p. 469), Bengal.\n\nSpiti.\u2014An extensive Subdivision of K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, consisting of an outlying Thibetan valley among the external ranges of the Him\u00e1layan system, lying between $31^\\circ 42'$ and $32^\\circ 58'$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 21'$ and $78^\\circ 32'$ E. long. It has the form of a rough triangle, its apex lying at the point of convergence of the Kanzam ridge and the Outer Him\u00e1layas, while the transverse ridge of M\u00e1nirang, dividing K\u00e1ngra District from Bashahr State, forms the base. The tract thus enclosed has an estimated area of 2100 square miles. The whole valley is drained by the Li or river of Spiti, from whose banks the spurs of the surrounding mountain ranges rise almost immediately, leaving only a narrow gorge, though which the central stream runs in a series of rapid cascades. The higher peaks of the main chain have an elevation of from 20,000 to 23,000 feet above sea level; and even the villages stand at from 12,000 to 14,000 feet. Scarcely any vegetation clothes the bare and rocky slopes; yet the scenery is not devoid of a rugged grandeur, while the deep and peculiar colour of the crags often gives most picturesque effects to the otherwise desolate landscape. Red and yellow predominate in the rocks, and contrast finely with the white snowy peaks in the background and the deep blue sky overhead. The villages stand for the most part on little flat plateaux, above the cliffs of the Spiti river; and their white houses, dotted about among the green cultivated plots, afford rare oases in the desert of stony debris which covers the mountain-sides.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of Spiti commences with the first formation of the kingdom of Lad\u00e1kh, after which event the valley seems for awhile to have been separated from that government, and attached to some other short-lived Thibetan principality. About 1630 A.D., it fell into the hands of Sinagi N\u00e1mgy\u00e1l, King of Lad\u00e1kh, who allotted it to his third son, Tenchbog. Soon after, it became a part of the Gug\u00e9 principality, which lay to the east, in what is now Chinese Thibet; and it did not again come under the dominion of Lad\u00e1kh till about 1720. In\nthat year the King of Lad\u00e1kh, at the conclusion of a war with Gug\u00e9 and Lh\u00e1s\u00e1, married the daughter of the Lh\u00e1san commander, and received Spiti as her dower. Thenceforward the valley remained a province of Lad\u00e1kh; but, from its remote and inaccessible position, it was practically left for the most part to govern itself, the official sent from Leh usually disappearing as soon as the harvest had been gathered in and the scanty revenue collected. Spiti was always liable to be harried by forays; but the people, being an unwarlike race, preferred the payment of black-mail to the armed defence of their barren valley.\n\nAfter the Sikhs had annexed the neighbouring principality of Kullu in 1841, they despatched a force to plunder Spiti. The inhabitants, in accordance with their usual tactics, retreated into the mountains, and left their houses and monasteries to be plundered and burnt. The Sikhs retired as soon as they had taken everything upon which they could lay hands, and did not attempt to annex the valley to Kullu nor to separate it from Lad\u00e1kh. In 1846, however, on the cession of the trans-Sutlej States to the British after the first Sikh war, the Government, with the object of securing a road to the wool districts of Chang Thang, added Spiti to Kullu, giving other territory in exchange to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Kashmir. In the same year, General (then Captain Cunningham and Mr. Vans Agnew demarcated the boundary between Spiti, Lad\u00e1kh, and Chinese Thibet. Since that date, the valley has been peacefully governed by British officials, with the assistance of the native hereditary rulers, who still practically manage all internal affairs after their own fashion.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Spiti, in 1868, amounted to only 3024 persons, almost exclusively of Thibetan origin. The religion is Buddhism of a purer type than that which prevails in Lah\u00fal, and extensive monasteries often crown the lower ridges overhanging the villages. The endowments consist of tithes of grain, voluntarily offered by the people. In appearance, the population belong to the Mongolian stock, and their dress is characterised by the love of colour conspicuous among that division of mankind. Polyandry does not now exist, as in the adjacent region of Lah\u00fal; the same object being attained by the peculiar practice of primogeniture, by which only the eldest son marries, while the younger sons become monks. Crime is rare; but both chastity and sobriety are almost unknown. The language in use is pure Thibetan. The chief village and immemorial seat of government is Dankar.\n\n**Agriculture and Commerce.**\u2014The principal crop is barley. The hereditary native head-man of Spiti bears the title of Nono. Commerce hardly exists, as the people dislike leaving their native valley; and trade could only be carried on by caravans, like those which manage the business between Lah\u00fal and Central Asia. The exports include cereals, manufactured cloth, y\u00e1ks, and y\u00e1ks' tails. The imports com-\nprise salt, tobacco, madder, and tea from Lh\u00e1s\u00e1; sheep's wool, turquoises, amber, and wooden vessels from Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r; coarse cloth, dyes, and soda from Lad\u00e1kh; and iron from Mandi and Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r. A handsome breed of ponies bred in Spiti is exported to Chamarti.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, Spiti forms part of the Kullu tahsil of Kangra District, under the Assistant Commissioner at Nagar on the Beas (Bi\u00e1s). The Nono ranks as an honorary magistrate with limited powers. The Government revenue amounts to only \u00a375. There is no school in the valley; but two boys from each local subdivision (of which there are 5) attend the Government school at Kielang in Lah\u00fal. The climate is warm in summer, but intensely cold during the winter, when its natural severity is aggravated by piercing winds from the snowy ranges. Snow begins to fall in December, and lies on the ground till April, to a depth of about 2\u00bd feet. Slight showers occur in July and August, though the valley lies beyond the regular influence of the monsoon. The health of the people is excellent; goitre and cretinism are unknown. Messrs. Schlagintweit give the mean temperature of the Upper Spiti valley at 17\u00b0 F. in January, 38\u00b0 F. in April, 60\u00b0 F. in July, and 39\u00b0 F. in October.\n\nSpiti.\u2014River in Kangra District and Bashahr, Punjab, draining the whole Subdivision of Spiti. Rises at the converging angle of the Kanzam and Outer Himalayan ranges, at the base of a peak 20,073 feet above the sea, and after a south-easterly course of 10 miles, receives the Lichu, a stream of equal volume, carrying off the surface waters of the mountains on either side of the Kanzam Pass; flows eastward for 13 miles, washing the foot of the Outer Himalayas; then turns south-eastward till it reaches M\u00e1ni, at the foot of the southern hills; thence sweeps eastward and leaves Spiti by a narrow gorge at its north-east corner; in Bashahr, it pursues a southerly direction, and finally joins the Sutlej (lat. 31\u00b0 42' N., long. 78\u00b0 39' E.) after a total course of 120 miles, with an average fall of 60 feet per mile. The greater part of the valley drained by the Spiti and its tributaries consists of barren rocks, through which the various torrents have cut themselves deep channels. The chief affluent of the Spiti is the Pin.\n\nSravan Belgola.\u2014Temples in Hassan District, Mysore.\u2014See Shravan Belgola.\n\nSravasti.\u2014Ruins in Gonda District, Oudh.\u2014See Sahet Mahet.\n\nSr\u00edgonda (Shrigonda).\u2014Chief town of the Sr\u00edgonda Subdivision of Ahmednagar District, Bombay; situated about 28 miles south by west of Ahmednagar city, in lat. 18\u00b0 41' N., and long. 74\u00b0 44' E. Pop. (1872), 6175. Post office.\n\nSr\u00edgovindpur.\u2014Municipal town in Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab. Pop. (1868), 5456. Situated in lat. 31\u00b0 41' N., and long. 75\u00b0 32' E., on the river R\u00e1vi, 18 miles south-east of Bat\u00e1la. Place of great sanctity\namongst the Sikhs, having been founded by Guru Arjun, who bought the site and built a town, which he called after his son and successor, Har Govind. The proprietary rights are still held by his descendant, Guru Jaw\u00e1har Sinh, who lives at Kart\u00e1pur in the Jalandhar Do\u00e1b. Exports of cotton and sugar, the latter in large quantities, by river to Sukkur on the Indus. Police station, post office, sardi (native inn), good school. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3259, or 11d. per head of population (553) within municipal limits.\n\nSr\u00edharikot.\u2014Insulated tract of alluvium and marine deposit, in Nellore District, Madras. It lies between the Pulicat Lake and the sea, stretching from Coromandel to Dugar\u00e1zpatnam; and it contained in 1871, 13,578 inhabitants, residing in 2064 houses. The tract is covered with firewood jungle. Sr\u00edharikot is chiefly interesting as being the home of the Y\u00e1nadia, a wild tribe, of whom there are several thousands in the District. They are apparently of Dravidian origin, and speak a dialect of Telugu. When they first came under the notice of the English authorities in 1835, they lived upon roots and jungle produce; but they have been partially reclaimed since then, and now maintain themselves by cutting firewood. They have greatly increased in number during the last thirty years, since a code of special regulations was introduced to ameliorate their condition.\n\nSr\u00edk\u00e1knlam.\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras.\u2014See Chicacole.\n\nSr\u00edk\u00e1nta.\u2014Mountain peak in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces, lying in lat. 30\u00b0 57' N., and long. 78\u00b0 51' E., enclosed by a great bend of the Bh\u00e1girathi river. A sharp and lofty peak, 20,296 feet above sea level. Thornton says it is visible from Sah\u00e1ranpur, a distance of 105 miles in a straight line.\n\nSr\u00ednagar (or Surjyanagar, 'The City of the Sun').\u2014Capital of the Native State of Kashmir in the Western Him\u00e1layas. Picturesquely situated in the 'Happy Valley' of Kashm\u00edr, about midway between its two ends, and close to the hills which bound its north-western side, on the banks of the river Jhelum, in lat. 34\u00b0 5' 31\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 51' E. The city extends for about 2 miles along the banks of the river, which divides it into two nearly equal portions, connected by seven bridges. Dr. Ince (in his excellent Kashmir Handbook, 1876) states that the average breadth of the river is about 88 yards; its depth is variable, but the average during the summer season is about 18 feet. It banks were formerly faced with long rectangular blocks of limestone, some of which are of large dimensions, and handsomely carved; but much of the embankment has crumbled or been washed away. There are several fine stone gh\u00e1ts or landing-stairs; and the city is also intersected by several canals, the principal of which are the Sunt-i-kut, the Kut-i-kut, and the N\u00e1li-m\u00e1r.\n\nSr\u00ednagar is built at an elevation of about 5276 feet above the sea;\nbut is surrounded by low swampy tracts, which render it unhealthy. The population numbers about 150,000,\u201420,000 being Hundus and the remainder Musalm\u00e1ns,\u2014living in about 20,000 houses, which are mostly built of wood, three or four stories high, with pent roofs overlaid with earth. Fires are frequent, and often very destructive. Dr. Ince, who was civil surgeon at Srinagar in 1864 and 1865, thus describes the general appearance of the city:\u2014'The public buildings are few. The principal of them are the b\u00e1ra-dari, palace, fort, gun-factory, dispensary, school, and mint; also some ancient mosques, temples, and cemeteries, which the student of Kashmirian history may study with advantage. The streets are generally narrow, and some of them are paved with large and irregular masses of limestone; they are all, however, very dirty, and unfit to be visited by ladies. There are several b\u00e1rs or market-places in different parts of the city, one of which, called the Mahar\u00e1jganj, has been lately built for the convenience of visitors, in which all the manufactures peculiar to Kashmir can be readily obtained. There are several large mansions on its outskirts, chiefly occupied by the great shawl merchants and bankers; some of them exhibit beautiful specimens of trellised woodwork, and in other respects are very tastefully fitted up.'\n\nThere is a famous poplar avenue, which is the 'Rotten Row' of Srinagar. It was planted by the Sikhs, and is quite straight; about 1\u00bd mile in length, and 56 feet in average width. Dr. Ince states that in 1865 it contained 1714 trees, of which 1699 were poplars and 15 chenars.\n\nThe Takht-i-Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n, or 'Throne of Solomon,' is a hill overlooking the city, from which a good view is obtained. On the top is a fine old stone temple, called by the Hindus Sankar Ach\u00e1rya; it was originally Buddhist, and was built by Jaloka, son of Asoka, about 220 B.C.\n\nThe Hari Parbat, or 'Fort Hill,' is an isolated hill on the northern outskirts of the city. It is about 250 feet high, and is crowned by the fort. A wall surrounds the hill, in which the principal gateway, called the K\u00e1t\u00ed Darw\u00e1za, is surmounted by a Persian inscription. Both wall and fort were built by Akbar about 1590 A.D., at a cost of a million sterling. The length of the wall is about 3 miles; its height, 28 feet.\n\nThe Sher Garhi, within the city, contains the city fort and the royal palace. It is 400 yards long by 200 wide; its walls are about 22 feet high; and the interior contains the state apartments, Government offices, and barracks. The Jam\u00e1 Masjid, or cathedral-mosque, which is also in the city, is a very large four-sided building, with an open square in the centre and a wooden steeple in the middle of each side; the roof of the surrounding cloister is supported by wooden pillars, each formed of a single deodar tree about 30 feet high.\nThe Dal, or City Lake of Kashmir, which has been sung by Moore in *Lalla Rookh*, lies on the north-eastern side of the city. It is about 5 miles long, 2\u00bd miles broad, with an average depth of about 10 feet. Its surface in many parts is covered with the famous Kashmirian 'floating gardens.' The Shalimar Bagh, well known as the scene of Moore's *Light of the Harem*, is a beautiful pleasure-ground laid out by Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr; the Nasib Bagh, or 'Garden of Bliss,' another picturesque pleasure-ground, is said to have been first planned by Akbar; and there are several other gardens of similar character in the environs of Srinagar.\n\nThe local government of the city is vested in a Viceroy or Governor, assisted by a Financial and Revenue Commissioner, a Judge of the Chief Court, an Accountant-General, a Superintendent of Shawls, and a Judge of the Civil Court. The present Governor resides in the Sher Garhi.\n\nSrinagar.\u2014Town in Narsinhpur District, Central Provinces; on the Umar river, 22 miles south-east of Narsinhpur town. A considerable place in the Gond period, and the quarters of a large garrison under the Marhatt\u00e1s, but now decayed. Estimated pop. 1500.\n\nSrinagar.\u2014Pargand, in Kheri District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Dhaurahra pargand\u00e1, from which it is separated by the Chauka river; on the east by Tambaur pargand\u00e1 of S\u00edt\u00e1pur; on the south by Kheri pargand\u00e1, the river Ul marking the boundary line; and on the west by Bhur pargand\u00e1. Area, 229 square miles, of which 120 are returned as under cultivation; pop. (1869), 75,840, viz. 68,259 Hindus and 7581 Muhammadans. Number of villages, 146, chiefly belonging to the talukd\u00e1rs of Oel and Mahewa. A few villages are owned by the kan\u00fango of Kh\u00e9ri.\n\nSrinagar.\u2014Tashil of Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces; embracing the whole District, and consisting of a wild mountain country along the valley of the Alaknanda. Estimated area, 5500 square miles, of which 209 are cultivated; pop. (1872), 310,282. Land revenue, \u00a39558; total Government revenue, \u00a310,640; rental paid by cultivators (estimated), \u00a319,116.\n\nSrinagar.\u2014Principal village in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of the tashil; situated in the valley of the Alaknanda, in lat. 30\u00b0 13' N., and long. 78\u00b0 48' 15\" E. A place of small importance, only noticeable as the most populous village in the District. The administrative headquarters are at Pauri. Several Hindu temples; general air of decay and poverty. Once the capital of the Garhw\u00e1l R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Heat oppressive in summer, owing to the position in an enclosed valley.\n\nSrinagar.\u2014Decayed town in Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on) road among the Mahoba Hills, 65 miles south of Ham\u00edrpur town. Pop. (1872), 4448.\nSRINGIRI\u2014SRINIVASPUR.\n\nFounded by Mohan Sinh, illegitimate son of Chhatar S\u00e1l, the Bundela chief, about 1710 A.D. Mohan Sinh built a fort on a hill overlooking the town, where was situated the mint from which the Sr\u00ednagar\u00ed rupees were issued, still the commonest coinage throughout Southern Bundelkhand. He also constructed the B\u00e1ra T\u00e1l, a fine tank, containing a picturesque little island, now greatly out of repair. Sacked during the Mutiny of 1857 by the outlaw Despat, and has never since recovered its prosperity. Ruins of fine houses occur in every part, wholly or partially uninhabited. Police station, post office, pargana school, b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Declining manufacture of brass idols.\n\nSr\u012bngiri (or Sr\u012bnga-giri; lit. 'Hill of Sr\u012bnga').\u2014Sacred village in K\u0101d\u016br District, Mysore; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 25' 10\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 17' 50\" E., on the left bank of the Tunga river. Pop. (1871), 1661. According to local tradition, the spot where Vibh\u00e1ndaka Rishi performed penance, and where Rishya Sr\u012bnga, a celebrated character of the R\u0101m\u0101yana, was born. In the 8th century, the famous Sivaite reformer Sankar Ach\u0101rjya settled here, bringing, it is said, from Kashmir the image of S\u0101rad-amma or Saraswat\u012b. (But see INDIA, vol. iv.) The spiritual throne which he founded has been handed down by unbroken succession to the present day. The present Sr\u012bngiri Sw\u0101m\u012b, named Narasinha Ch\u0101ri, the jagat gur\u016b of the Smarta Br\u0101hmans, is a man of great learning. His claims to sanctity are admitted by all votaries of Siva. It is his habit to be absent for many years on tours to the farthest corners of India; and the enormous contributions collected from the pious during these expeditions are lavishly expended on hospitality and charitable works. The m\u00e1gani of Sr\u012bngiri, comprising a fertile tract in the upper valley of the Tung\u00e1, forms an ancient endowment of the m\u0101th or conventional establishment over which the gur\u016b presides; and a monthly grant of \u00a3100 is allowed in addition by the Mysore State. The village consists of a single long street, with a loop on one side encircling the small hill of Sr\u012bnga-giri, on which stands the temple of S\u0101rad-amma, the tutelary deity of the place. Several large festivals are held during the year, each attended by from 3000 to 10,000 people. On these occasions all classes are fed at the expense of the m\u0101th; cloths and bodices are distributed to the women, and pieces of money to the men. For list of 29 successive heads of the monastery, see H. H. Wilson's Religion of the Hindus, i. 201, ed. 1862. In this list Sankara only stands second.\n\nSr\u012bnivaspur.\u2014Tiluk in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore. Area, 331 square miles, of which 82 are under cultivation; pop. (1871), 73,933, of whom 69,479 are Hindus, 4443 Muhammadans, 1 Jain, and 10 Christians. Land revenue (1874-75), exclusive of water rates, \u00a39750 per acre. Much of the area is occupied with forest-clad hills.\n\nSr\u012bnivaspur.\u2014Municipal village in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore; 14 miles\nby road north-north-east of Kol\u00e1r town; headquarters of the taluk of the same name. Pop. (1871), 2843; municipal revenue (1874-75), \u00a362; rate of taxation, 5d. per head. Formerly known as P\u00e1pan-halli; but the name was changed by the d\u00edv\u00e1n Purnaiya, who called it after his son Srinivasa Murti. Rough bits for horses and other small articles of iron are manufactured; there is also an arrack distillery.\n\nSr\u00edr\u00e1mpur.\u2014Subdivision and town in H\u00fagli District, Bengal.\u2014See SERAMPUR.\n\nSr\u00edrangam (Seringham).\u2014Town in Trichinopoli District, Madras; situated in lat. 10\u00b0 51' 50\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 43' 55\" E., 2 miles north of Trichinopoli city, and almost in the centre of the island of Sr\u00edrangam, formed by the bifurcation of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) into two branches at a point about 11 miles west of Trichinopoli. Pop. (1871), 11,271, residing in 2275 houses. The southern branch of the river retains the name of K\u00e1veri, while the northern channel is known as the Coleroon (Kollidam).\n\nThe town chiefly owes its fame to its great temple dedicated to Vishnu. The temple and the town are indeed almost conterminous, the greater portion of the houses having been built inside the temple walls. The shrine has been fully described by Fergusson in his History of Indian and Eastern Architecture. He makes it an illustration of the way in which many South Indian temples have grown around a small original shrine, so that the finest parts of the whole structure are in the wrong place, that is, outside; and the absence of a general design spoils the effect of the details. 'The temple which has been most completely marred by this false system,' writes Mr. Fergusson, 'is that at Sr\u00edrangam, which is certainly the largest, and if its principle of design could be reversed, would be the finest in the South of India. Here, the central enclosure is small and insignificant, and except that its dome is gilt, has nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary village temple. The next enclosure, however, is more magnificent. It encloses the hall of 1000 columns which measures some 450 feet by 130 feet. The number of columns is 16 in front by 60 in depth, or 960 altogether. They consequently are not spaced more than 10 feet apart from centre to centre; and as at one end the hall is hardly over 10 feet high, and in the loftiest place only 15 or 16 feet, and the pillars spaced nearly evenly over the floor, it will be easily understood how little effect such a building really produces. The pillars are, however, each of a single block of granite, and all carved more or less elaborately. A much finer portico stretches across the court from gopura to gopura; the pillars in it are more widely spaced, and the width of the central aisle is double that of those on the sides, and crosses the portico in the centre, making a transept; its height, too, is double that of the side aisles. It is a pleasing and graceful architectural design; the other is\nonly an evidence of misapplied labour. The next four enclosures have nothing very remarkable in them, being generally inhabited by the Br\u0101hmans and persons connected with the temple. Each, however, has or was intended to have four gopuras, one on each face; and some of these are of considerable elaboration. The outer enclosure is practically a b\u0101z\u0101r, filled with shops, where pilgrims are lodged and fed. The wall that bounds it measures 2475 feet by 2880 feet; and had its gopuras been finished, they would probably have surpassed all others in the South to the same extent as these dimensions exceed those of any other known temple. The northern gopura, leading to the river and Trichinopoli, measures 130 feet in width by 100 feet in depth; the opening through it measures 21 feet 6 inches and twice that in height. The four jambs or gate posts are each of a single slab of granite more than 40 feet in height, and the roofing slabs throughout measure from 23 to 24 feet. Had the ordinary brick pyramid of the usual proportion been added to this, the whole would have risen to a height of nearly 300 feet. Even as it is, it is one of the most imposing masses in Southern India, and perhaps because it never was quite finished, is in severe and good taste throughout. Looked at from a distance, or in any direction whence the whole can be grasped at once, these 14 or 15 great gate towers cannot fail to produce a certain effect; but even then it can only be by considering them as separate buildings. As parts of one whole, their arrangement is exactly that which enables them to produce the least possible effect that can be obtained either from their mass or ornament. Had the four great outer gopuras formed the four sides of a central hall, and the others gone on diminishing in three or four directions to the exterior, the effect of the whole would have been increased in a surpassing degree. To accomplish this, however, one other defect must have been remedied; a gateway even 150 feet wide in a wall nearly 2000 feet in extent is a solecism nothing can redeem; but had the walls been broken in plan, or star-shaped like the plane of Chalukian temples, light and shade would have been obtained, and due proportion of parts, without any inconvenience. But if the Dravidians ever had it in them to think of such things, it was not during the 17th and 18th centuries, to which everything in this temple seems to belong.\n\nDuring the annual festival in December or January, one yard is covered by a large pandal (shed), erected every year at a cost of about \u00a3300. In booths round this pandal, which is handsomely decorated, are to be seen various figures of gods and other mythical personages. Among the groups of images, that of a very sallow-faced Collector administering justice, surrounded by peons, with a prisoner in front of him, is never omitted. Running round this enclosure is a street in which there are ordinary dwelling-houses and shops. The Madras\nMunicipal Act (III. of 1871) was extended to Sr\u00edrangam in 1871. Since that time, the municipality have done much towards the general conservancy of the place, and have built a hospital close to the southern gate of the temple, at which a large number of in-patients and out-patients are treated.\n\nFor the part played by Sr\u00edrangam as a fortress, in the wars of the Karnatic, the reader is referred to the article on Trichinopoli District.\n\nSr\u00edr\u00e1ngapatanam.\u2014Town in Mysore District, Mysore.\u2014See Ser\u00edngapatam.\n\nSr\u00edrangavarapukot.\u2014Headquarters of a taluk of the same name in Vizagapatanam District, Madras. Lat. 18\u00b0 6' 34\" N., long. 83\u00b0 11' 11\" E.; pop. (1871), 5078, inhabiting 1074 houses.

Lat. 8\u00b0 38' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 57' 20\" E.; pop. (1871), 7059, inhabiting 1832 houses. The fort here was occupied till recently by a special caste of S\u00fadras called Kottai Vell\u00e1lars, who had peculiar customs. There is also a fine temple.\n\nSr\u00edwardh\u00e1n.\u2014Town in Janjira State, Bombay. Lat. 18\u00b0 4' N., long. 73\u00b0 4' E.; pop. (1872), 7409.\n\nSubalgarh.\u2014Village and ruined fort in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 44' N., and long. 78\u00b0 15' E., on the Hardw\u00e1r road, 10 miles north-west of Najib\u00e1b\u00e1d. Extensive fortifications surround the decayed town, which consists of little else but a mass of ruins.\n\nSubankh\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Market village in Maimansinh District, Bengal; situated on the Jamuna river, 44 miles west of Nasr\u00e1b\u00e1d, with which it is connected by a tolerably good road. A considerable export and import trade is carried on. The village contains an indigo factory.\n\nSubans\u00edr\u00ed.\u2014Great river in the north-east of the Province of Assam, which contributes to form the main stream of the Brahmaputra. Its source and upper course, like those of the Brahmaputra itself, are entirely unknown; but it is supposed to rise far up among the mountains of Thibet, and to flow for a long distance in an easterly direction before it turns south to break through the northern mountain barrier of the Assam valley. It enters the District of Lakhimpur from the Mir\u00ed Hills, and, still flowing south, divides the Subdivision of North Lakhimpur into two almost equal portions. Before it reaches the Brahmaputra, it forms, together with the channel of the Lobit, the large island known as the Majuli char, and finally empties itself into the main stream in S\u00edbs\u00e1g\u00e1r District. In the hills the bed of the river is\ngreatly broken up by rocks and rapids; but in the plains it is navigable by steamers as far up as P\u00e1t\u00e1lip\u00e1ni, 16 miles from the Subdivisional town of North Lakhimpur. Below this place it is nowhere fordable, but it is crossed by three ferries. Its principal known tributaries beyond the British frontier are the Kaml\u00e1p\u00e1ni, Siplu, G\u00e1i\u00fa, and N\u00e1o-bh\u00f3ga. Within Lakhimpur District it is joined by the Dulung, Dirp\u00e1i, S\u00e1ulduh\u00e1, Sumdiri, Rang\u00e1nadi, and Dikrang. From time immemorial the bed of the Subans\u00edri has yielded gold-dust, washing for which affords a scanty living to a class known as Hanu\u00e1ls. In former times the banks of this river furnished abundant supplies of caoutchouc, but these have now been exhausted by indiscriminate destruction of the trees.\n\n**Subara** (or **Sio\u00e1b\u00e1ra**).\u2014One of the petty Bh\u00edl (Bheel) States in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Bombay.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\n**Subargum**.\u2014Hill in D\u00e1rj\u00edling District, Bengal; one of the principal peaks in the Sing\u00e1lil\u00e1 range. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 9' 45\" N., and long. 88\u00b0 3' 15\" E., upon the eastern frontier of the District, bordering upon Nep\u00e1l. Height above the sea, 10,430 feet.\n\n**Subarn\u00e1rekha** ('The Streak of Gold').\u2014River of Bengal; rises 10 miles south-west of R\u00e1nch\u00ed in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, and flows towards the north-east, leaving the main plateau in a picturesque waterfall called Hundrugh\u00e1gh. From this point it forms the boundary with Haz\u00e1ri-b\u00e1gh, its course being eastwards to the triple boundary junction with M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District. Hence it bends southwards into Singbh\u00fam, whence it passes into the State of Morbhanj, and afterwards enters Midnapur District from the north-west. It traverses the jungle western tract of this District till it reaches Balasor, through which it flows in a tortuous southern course, with gigantic windings east and west, until it finally falls into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. 21\u00b0 34' 15\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 23' E., after a course of 317 miles, having drained an area of 11,300 square miles. The chief tributaries of the Subarn\u00e1rekha in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur are the K\u00e1ch\u00ed and Karkari, both joining it from the west. The river is navigable by country craft about 16 miles from its mouth, up to which point it is also tidal. During the rains, rice boats of 2 tons burden can make their way far into Morbhanj. The banks of the Subarn\u00e1rekha are high and steep on the outer curve of the bends, and flat and sandy on the inner; the bed is studded with islands. The bordering country is cultivated to within a few miles of the sea, where it becomes jungle. The Subarn\u00e1rekha is nowhere fordable within Balasor District; it is embanked here in its lower reaches.\n\n**Subarn\u00e1rekha**.\u2014Port consisting of a demarcated portion of the river of the same name; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 34' 30\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 22' E., about 12 miles from the sea by water route, or about 6 miles in a direct line. In early times, this seems to have been by far the most\nimportant port on the Orissa coast; and it is specially interesting as the site of the first maritime English settlement in Bengal, which was founded on the ruins of the earlier Portuguese factory at Pippli. But of these colonies no traces now exist, and the river has so often changed its course that it is impossible to identify the precise spot of their location. In January 1875, Captain Harris, the Conservator of Orissa Ports, stated that the entrance to the Subarnarekha from the east had closed up, and that the only channel now remaining was to the southwest of the shoals in the mouth, which are almost bare at low tide. The port is unsafe during the south-west monsoon, as it presents a dead lee shore with breakers right across the mouth, the sole obstacle to navigation; but within the bar the Subarnarekha possesses a magnificent deep channel. The imports in 1873-75 were nil; the exports were valued at only \u00a32554. The port is principally visited by fishing boats, which in fair weather issue out in squadrons, and sail down as far as Puri. No regular survey of the Subarnarekha river itself, as distinguished from its entrance, has yet been made.\n\nSubathu.\u2014Hill cantonment and sanatorium in Simla District, Punjab; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 58' N., and long. 77\u00b0 2' E., on a tableland at the extremity of the Simla range, overlooking the Ghambar river. Lies just above the old road from Kalka to Simla, 9 miles from Kasauli and 23 from Simla station. Held as a military post since the close of the Gurkha war in 1816. Barracks exist for a whole regiment. Small fort above the parade-ground, formerly of military importance, now used as a guard-room. Deficient water supply; excessive heat in summer. Cholera broke out in 1872. Branch of American Presbyterian Mission maintains an excellent school, in receipt of a grant from Government. Elevation above sea level, 4500 feet.\n\nSubeha.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in B\u00e1r\u00e1 B\u00e1ni District, Oudh; bounded on the north by the river Gumti, on the east by Jagdispur pargan\u00e1 in Sult\u00e1npur, on the south by Inhauna pargan\u00e1 in R\u00e1i Bareli, and on the west by Haidargarh pargan\u00e1. Area, 88 square miles, or 56,467 acres, of which 30,783 acres are cultivated; pop. (1869), 58,727, viz. 54,037 Hindus and 4690 Muhammadans. Government land revenue, \u00a36610. This tract was formerly held by the Bhars, who were expelled about 900 years ago by the Muhammadans in the time of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad. Subsequently it was taken possession of by Bais Kshattriyas. Of the 86 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 22 are held in t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri (owned by Muhammadans), 3 in zamind\u00e1ri, and 61 in pattid\u00e1ri tenure.\n\nSubeha.\u2014Town in B\u00e1r\u00e1 B\u00e1ni District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 38' N., and long. 81\u00b0 34' E., 52 miles north-west of Sult\u00e1npur, and 30 miles east of B\u00e1r\u00e1 B\u00e1ni town, near the river Gumti. Several tanks and masonry wells, bi-weekly market, manufacture of country cloth,\nschool, police, post and registry office, and fort. Pop. (1869), 2754; number of houses, 601. Subeha is supposed to have been a Bhar town prior to the Muhammadan invasion. The principal landed family, that of the late Chaudhari Sarfar\u00e1z Ahmad, traces descent from one of the generals of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r. But little is known of the family till 1616 A.D., when Shaikh N\u00e1sir was appointed Chaudhari of pargan\u00e1 Subeha by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. His descendants divided the pargan\u00e1 amongst themselves, but the office of Chaudhari remained undivided; and in 1792, Chaudhari Im\u00e1m Bakhsh commenced to absorb all the separate properties into his own estate. Chaudhari Sarfar\u00e1z Ahmad continued this career of aggrandizement, and was granted an estate in R\u00e1i Bareli District as a reward for his exertions.\n\n**Suchin.**\u2014State and town in Surat District, Bombay.\u2014See Sachin.\n\n**Sud\u00e1m\u00e1npur.**\u2014Village in R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; situated 2 miles north of the Ganges. Named after its founder Sud\u00e1m\u00e1n Sinh, a Janw\u00e1r Kshattriya, who settled here about 500 years ago. Pop. (1869), 2140.\n\n**Sudamra Dhandhulpur.**\u2014One of the petty States in North K\u00e1thi-\u00e1war, Bombay; consisting of 28 villages, with 6 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue (1876), \u00a32052; of which \u00a3238 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a374 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\n**Sud\u00e1sna.**\u2014Native State in the Political Agency of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay. Estimated pop. (1872), 5365. It is situated in the N\u00e1ni M\u00e1rw\u00e1r Subdivision of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and its western boundary marches with that of P\u00e1lanpur. The principal agricultural products are millet, wheat, and Indian corn.\n\nThe chief traces descent from Umar Sinh, a son of R\u00e1n\u00e1 Punja of D\u00e1nta, on whose death he obtained Sud\u00e1sna and afterwards certain other villages, and a fourth share of transit dues paid by pilgrims visiting the shrine of Amba Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed. This tax is collected as the pilgrims pass through his territory. The present (1876-77) chief is Th\u00e1kur Part\u00e1b Sinh, a B\u00e1rad R\u00e1jput of the Pram\u00e1r clan. He is fifty-seven years old, and manages his estate in person. He enjoys an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a31182; and pays a tribute of \u00a3104 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a336 to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Edar. The family of the chief follow the rule of primogeniture in matters of succession.\n\n**Sudh\u00e1r\u00e1m (No\u00e1kh\u00e1ll\u00ed).**\u2014Principal town and headquarters of No\u00e1kh\u00e1ll\u00ed District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the No\u00e1kh\u00e1ll\u00ed khd\u00ed, a natural water-course, which gives its name to the District. Lat. 22\u00b0 48' 15\" N., long. 91\u00b0 8' 45\" E.; pop. (1872), 4752. Sudh\u00e1r\u00e1m is so called after Sudh\u00e1r\u00e1m Mazumd\u00e1r, a resident landlord, who dug the only large tank in the place. The town now lies about 10 miles inland, but it was once on the sea-coast. During the rains, the tidal bore sometimes rushes up the river even farther than Sudh\u00e1r\u00e1m. Good roads to the\nPheni river, to R\u00e1ipur, and Begamganj. The town contains a Roman Catholic chapel, and numerous mosques and tanks. Municipal income (1874-75), \u00a3239, 3s. 1\u00bdd.; police force, 15 men.\n\n**Sufed Koh.**\u2014Mountain range in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.\u2014See Safed Koh.\n\n**Suh\u00e1wal.**\u2014State and town in the B\u00e1ghelkhand Agency, Central India.\u2014See Sohawal.\n\n**Suig\u00e1m.**\u2014Native State in the Political Superintendency of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, in the Province of Guzerat, Bombay; bounded on the north and east by W\u00e1o State, on the south by Ch\u00e1dchat State, and on the west by the Salt Desert or Rann. The State is about 20 miles long by 8 miles broad, and covers an area of 161 square miles; it contained a population in 1872 of 10,104 persons. The country is flat and open; the soil produces poor crops of the common grains. A scanty supply of brackish water is found at a depth of 15 feet. The chief's family is of the same origin as that of the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of W\u00e1o. The territory was about 420 years ago granted to Pach\u00e1nji, the youngest son of R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sang\u00e1j\u00ed, and, like W\u00e1o, is subdivided amongst a numerous independent bh\u00e1y\u00e1d or brotherhood. Like their brethren of W\u00e1o, the chiefs of Suig\u00e1m were noted freebooters, and in the early part of the present century gave every assistance to the Khos\u00e1s in their predatory raids. But since 1826, when they entered into an agreement with Colonel Miles, they have become peaceful cultivators of the soil. The present (1876-77) chief of Suig\u00e1m is Th\u00e1kur Bhupat Sinh, a R\u00e1jput of the Chauh\u00e1n clan; he is five years of age. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a31000.\n\n**Suig\u00e1m.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in Guzerat, Bombay. Lat. 24\u00b0 9' N., long. 71\u00b0 21' E.\n\n**Suj\u00e1npur.**\u2014Municipal town in Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab; situated in lat. 32\u00b0 19' N., and long. 75\u00b0 40' E., at the foot of the hills, in the corner of the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b below N\u00farpur. Pop. (1868), 6177, consisting of 2442 Hindus, 3483 Muhammadans, 179 S\u00edkh, and 73 'others.' Distant from Gurd\u00e1spur town 23 miles north-east, from Path\u00e1nkot 4 miles north-west. Exports of rice, turmeric, and hemp to Amritsar (Umritsur) and Lahore, principally by boats upon the R\u00e1vi. Municipal revenue (1875-76), \u00a3279, or 10\u00bdd. per head of population (6556) within municipal limits.\n\n**Suj\u00e1npur Tira.**\u2014Town in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab; situated on the bank of the Beas (B\u00edas), in lat. 31\u00b0 50' N., and long. 76\u00b0 32' E., 15 miles above N\u00e1daun. Pop. (1868), 3275. Palace of the ancient Katoch dynasty crowns a height overlooking the town. Commenced in 1758 by Abhi Ch\u00e1nd, great-grandfather of Sansar Ch\u00e1nd (see Kangra District). Subsequently enlarged by his son and grandson, the latter of whom founded the town of Suj\u00e1npur. Sansar Ch\u00e1nd completed the building, and held his court here. The palace, a residence of regal\nproportions, and highly finished in point of workmanship, bears the name of Tira, whence the double title of the place. Picturesque town, having a handsome old parade ground, a grassy plain surrounded by noble trees. Local trade centre of considerable importance; colony of gunmakers and jewellers, introduced by the Katoch princes from Gujr\u00e1t and Delhi respectively.\n\n**Sukesar.**\u2014Mountain in Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab.\u2014See Sakeswar.\n\n**Suket.**\u2014Native State under the Political Superintendence of the Government of the Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 13' 45''$ and $31^\\circ 35' 25''$ N. lat., and between $76^\\circ 49'$ and $77^\\circ 26'$ E. long., on the north side of the Sutlej river, which separates it from the cis-Sutlej Hill States. Area, 420 square miles; estimated pop. (1875), 44,180; supposed gross revenue in the same year, \u00a37380, of which \u00a31100 is paid as tribute to the British Government. The country of Suket was united to that of Mandi until about the year 1200 A.D. The separation was followed by frequent wars between the two States, with ever-varying success. The country eventually fell under Sikh supremacy, which was exchanged for that of the British Government by the treaty of Lahore in 1846, and in that year full sovereignty was conceded to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, Agar Sen, and his heirs. A sanad conferring the right of adoption was granted in 1862. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Agar Sen died in 1875, and was succeeded by his son Rudra Sen, who was born about 1828. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rudra Sen was deposed in 1878 in consequence of misgovernment. The State is now administered provisionally by two of his relatives, pending the election of a successor. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Suket receives a salute of 11 guns. A small force is maintained of 40 cavalry and 500 infantry.\n\n**Suket.**\u2014Mountain range in Kangra District, Punjab.\u2014See Jalori.\n\n**Suketa.**\u2014The popular Anglicised form of S\u00e1keta, one of the classical names borne by Ajodhya (q.v.), the ancient capital of Oudh. See General Cunningham's *Ancient Geography of India*, pp. 401-5 (Ed. 1871).\n\n**Sukheta.**\u2014River of Oudh, rising in lat. $27^\\circ 55'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 7'$ E., and forming the boundary between Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1npur and Kheri Districts. It flows in a south-easterly direction for about 20 miles from its source, and turning to the south-west, enters Hardoi District, and falls into the Garra in lat. $27^\\circ 18'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 2'$ E. Total length, about 84 miles. It becomes a torrent in the rains, and cuts off communication with Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1npur.\n\n**Sukhu-chak.**\u2014Town in Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab. Lat. $32^\\circ 24'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 14'$ E. Pop. (1868), 3408.\n\n**Sukkur (Sakhar) and Shik\u00e1rpur.**\u2014Sub-District or Deputy Collectorate of Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind. Area, by Survey estimate, 1238 square miles; pop. (1872), 181,832, consisting of 126,394 Muhammadans, 54,985 Hindus, and 453 'others.' Bounded north and west by\nthe Frontier District, east by the Indus, and south by L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. Headquarters at Sukkur Town. The country consists of a level plain, broken only at Sukkur by a low range of limestone hills. Highly cultivated in parts, and diversified by lakes and forests. The chief canals in the Sub-District are the Sindw\u00e1, the Beg\u00e1ri, the Al\u00edbahar, and the Sukkur. Irrigation is also effected by \u00cdt\u00eds or floods. Game, abundant; fisheries, numerous; minerals, salt and saltpetre. Principal crops\u2014j\u00f3dr, b\u00e1jra, wheat, barley, rice, indigo, cotton, and tobacco. Figs, mulberries, apples, mangoes, dates, etc. are also grown. The commerce of the Sub-District centres in the two large towns of Shik\u00e1rpur and Sukkur. Annual fairs at Lakhi Thar, Jind P\u00edr, Old Sukkur, Naushahro, and Jhali; the first of these is attended by from 20,000 to 25,000 persons. Total length of roads, 500 miles. Ferries, 24, of which 9 are across the Indus. Telegraph line from Sukkur to Shik\u00e1rpur, and thence to Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d. The total revenue of the Sub-District amounted in 1873-74 to \u00a341,253, of which \u00a336,297 was derived from imperial and \u00a34956 from local sources. The land revenue, abk\u00e1ri or excise, and stamp duties furnish the chief items. The tenures obtaining in this Sub-District are the maur\u00fasi h\u00e1ri (lit. \u2018hereditary cultivator\u2019) and the patt\u00edd\u00e1ri. The extent of land held in j\u00e1gr\u00ed is 16,000 acres. There are 3 municipalities in the Sub-District, viz. Shik\u00e1rpur, Sukkur, and Garhi V\u00e1sin; their aggregate receipts in 1873-74 were \u00a326,270. The police force numbers 523 officers and men. Shik\u00e1rpur is the seat of the District and Sessions Judge, and Sukkur of the subordinate Judge. Two jails, viz. at Shik\u00e1rpur and in the island fort of Bukkur. Number of Government schools, 32, with 2988 pupils. Normal and Anglo-vernacular school at Sukkur, and a high school at Shik\u00e1rpur; 4 girls\u2019 schools; 5 Hindi-Sindi schools, with 1031 pupils. Three hospitals and a dispensary in the Sub-District.\n\nSukkur (Sakhar).\u2014T\u00e1luk of the Sukkur and Shik\u00e1rpur Sub-District, Shik\u00e1rpur, Sind. Area, 279 square miles; pop. (1872), 60,223; total revenue (1873-74), \u00a315,959.\n\nSukkur (Sakhar).\u2014Town and headquarters of the Sukkur and Shik\u00e1rpur Sub-District, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 42' 0\" N., and long. 68\u00b0 54' 30\" E., on the right or western bank of the Indus, opposite Rohri. Midway between these two towns lies the island fortress of Bukkur, and a little southward the wooded island of S\u00e1dh Bela. Sukkur is connected by road with Shik\u00e1rpur, 24 miles north-west. By the Indus, it has communication with M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) and Kotri. The newly opened line of the Indus Valley State Railway runs from Sukkur to Kotri, and so to the port of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee). The Indus has not yet (1880) been bridged; but a powerful steam-ferry keeps open communication with Rohri, on the opposite bank of the river, which is in direct connection by rail with M\u00falt\u00e1n and the Punjab.\nSukkur is also the terminus of the railway now in course of construction through the Bol\u00e1n Pass. A range of low limestone hills, utterly devoid of vegetation, slopes down to the river; and it is on this rocky site that New Sukkur, as distinguished from the old town of the same name about a mile distant, is partly situated. Scattered about are the ruins of numerous tombs; and at the western side of the town, overlooking the river, is the lofty minaret of Mir Masum Shah, erected, it is supposed, about 1607 A.D. Sukkur contains the usual public offices, with a civil hospital, dispensary, Anglo-vernacular school, subordinate jail, postal and telegraph offices, travellers' bungalow, and dharmasala. It possesses, besides, a Freemasons' Lodge. Municipal revenue (1873-74), \u00a310,545; expenditure, \u00a39035. The town is well drained and clean. Pop. (1872), 13,318, of whom 6161 were Muhammadans, 6952 Hindus, 85 Christians, and 120 'others.' In 1834, the population was estimated at only 4000. The trade of Sukkur, both local and transit, is considerable, but no trustworthy details are available. Statistics of the traffic on the Indus appear to have been regularly kept from 1855-56 to 1861-62, by an officer of the late Indian Navy. In 1855-56, 600 boats proceeding up river with a total tonnage of 7750; and in 1861-62, 1232 with a tonnage of 20,232, discharged at Sukkur port. In the same years, 629 and 1714 boats left Sukkur with cargoes amounting to 8000 and 16,317 tons respectively. No returns seem to have been made between 1861-62 and 1865-66, but from the latter date they were carried down to 1867-68, after which they were discontinued altogether. In that year, 293 boats, with a tonnage of 5171, discharged at Sukkur; and 6167, with a tonnage of 96,362, proceeded from Sukkur. In 1855-56, the number of vessels proceeding down river and discharging at Sukkur was 2210, with a tonnage of 33,125; in 1861-62, 479, with a tonnage of 7694; and in 1867-68, 1580, with a tonnage of 24,739. In 1855-56 and in 1861-62, the number of vessels proceeding downstream from Sukkur was 2210 and 940, with a tonnage of 33,125 and 18,178 respectively; in 1867-68, the number of vessels rose to 6860, with a total tonnage of 114,358. The downward exports comprise silk, country cloth, raw cotton, wool, opium, saltpetre, sugar, dyes, and brass utensils. The upward exports include piece-goods, metals, wines and spirits, and country produce. There is a large local trade between Sukkur and Shikarpur. The town possesses no special manufacturing industries.\n\nOld Sukkur seems to be a place of no great antiquity, though it contains the ruins of numerous tombs and mosques. Among the former is the tomb of Shah Khair-ud-din Shah, which is said to have been erected about 1758 A.D. New Sukkur owes its existence to the stationing of European troops here in 1839, at the time when Bukkur fort was made over to the British; and it was rapidly converted into a prosperous and busy town. In 1845, after a fatal epidemic of fever among the\ngarrison, New Sukkur was abandoned as a station for European troops; but it promises to be of still greater importance than before, as the centre of railway communication with Kar\u00e1chi, M\u00falt\u00e1n, and Kandah\u00e1r. Little is known of Old Sukkur in the days of Afgh\u00e1n rule; but it is believed to have been ceded to the Khairpur M\u00edrs some time between the years 1809 and 1824. In 1833, it was the scene of a conflict between Sh\u00e1h Shuja-ul-Mulk, the dethroned Dur\u00e1ni sovereign, and the T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs, the latter being defeated. In 1842, Old Sukkur, together with Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee), Tatta, and Rohri, was yielded to the British in perpetuity.\n\n**Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills.**\u2014Mountain range in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n and the Punjab, forming the historical boundary of India on the west. They stretch from lat. $31\u00b0\\ 35' \\ 39\"$ to $31\u00b0\\ 40' \\ 59\"$ N., and from long. $69\u00b0\\ 58' \\ 39\"$ to $70\u00b0\\ 0' \\ 45\"$ E., thus bordering the whole Deraj\u00e1t in Bannu, Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, and Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Districts. The highest peak, the Takht-i-Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n, nearly due west of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n town, has two summits, respectively $11,295$ and $11,070$ feet above sea level. Throughout the range presents a comparatively straight line to the British frontier. The outer hills consist of several parallel ranges, having a direction due north and south. Beyond them rises the main chain, sloping away gradually on the Afgh\u00e1n side toward the valley of K\u00e1ndah\u00e1r. The Sul\u00e1im\u00e1ns are generally rocky and precipitous, completely bare of trees upon their sides, and wanting in water among the ravines at their feet. Numerous passes thread the range, held by independent tribes in alliance with the British Government. The Kuram forms almost the only river of any importance, taking its rise amongst their dry summits. Length, from north to south, about 350 miles.\n\nThe following description is condensed from Colonel MacGregor's account. The Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n range is thrown off to the south from the Allah-koh ridge between K\u00e1b\u00fal and Ghazn\u00ed, and proceeding southwards without a break, forms the system of mountains of Eastern Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n and Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n. The whole of the eastern slopes of the range drain into the Indus; while to the west, the drainage runs either into the Helmand, or is lost in the desert between Persia and Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n. On the south, the lower slopes discharge their drainage into the sea. The principal spurs thrown off from the main range on the west are a range dividing Zurmat from Kataw\u00e1z, and one which leaves the parent ridge south of Mount Chapar, and runs nearly west to the Sar-i-Bol\u00e1n, which is thus a continuation of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n range. On the eastern or Indian side, the main offshoots are\u2014a range dividing the drainage of the Kuram from Khost valley; a spur dividing D\u00e1war from Khost, which ends in British territory in Bannu District; the Waz\u00edr\u00ed range in its many branches; and the Surkh-koh or K\u00e1la-koh, over which runs the Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r Pass.\nSulekere (lit. 'Courtesan's Tank,' so called from a local legend).\u2014Lake in the east of Shimoga District, Mysore; artificially formed in ancient times by damming up the waters of the Haridra river, a tributary of the Tungabhadra. Its margin is about 40 miles in circumference; and, next to the Cumbum (Kambham) tank in Cuddapah (Kadapa) District, it is probably the finest reservoir in Southern India. It receives the drainage of 20 square miles, and is capable of irrigating 20,000 acres. In modern times, the work has been greatly neglected; but its embankment is still firm and uninjured, and the sluices have recently been repaired.\n\nSullivan's Island.\u2014An island in the Mergui Archipelago, attached to Mergui District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Lat. 10\u00b0 40' to 11\u00b0 N., and long. 97\u00b0 58' to 98\u00b0 E. Extreme length, 17 miles; extreme breadth, 6 miles. A favourite haunt of the Selung tribe.\n\nSultanganj.\u2014Considerable village in Bhagalpur District, Bengal; situated close to the banks of the Ganges, near the railway station of the same name. Lat. 25\u00b0 14' 45\" N., long. 86\u00b0 47' 6\" E.; pop. (1872), 4247, viz. 2269 males and 1978 females. The river-borne trade and the railway have largely contributed to the commercial importance of this village. Sultanganj is conspicuous for two great rocks of granite, one of which, on the river bank, is crowned by a Musalm\u00e1n mosque. The second and larger one is occupied by a temple of the Gh\u00e1ibn\u00e1th Siva, and is a place of great holiness in the eyes of Hindus. The river here strikes against a cliff of stone, and a spot where this occurs is always believed to be the scene of the loves of the river nymph and the god Siva. In the rainy season, the rock is isolated, and the stream rushes past with great violence. During the fair weather, many of the Hindus who live in the neighbourhood receive instruction at the temple. Few Hindus of any position pass the place without making offerings to the idol.\n\nSultanpur.\u2014A British District in the Rai Bareli Division or Commissionership of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces; lying between 26\u00b0 39' and 27\u00b0 58' N. lat., and between 81\u00b0 36' and 82\u00b0 44' E. long. Area, after recent transfers, 1701 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1869, but allowing for all changes of boundary, 1,000,336 souls. Bounded on the north by Faizabad (Fyzabad), on the east by Jaunpur, on the south by Partabgarh, and on the west by Rai Bareli. Extreme length of District, 80 miles; greatest breadth, 38 miles. The administrative headquarters are at Sultanpur Town.\n\nChanges in Jurisdiction.\u2014The District, as at present constituted, differs entirely from that which existed prior to 1870. The old District comprised the 12 parganas of Inhauna, Jagdispur, Subeha, Rokha Jais, Simrauta, Gaura Jamun, Mohanganj, Amethi, Isauli, Tappa Asl,\nSult\u00e1npur, and Ch\u00e1nda, with a total area of 1570 square miles, and a population, in 1869, of 930,023 souls. In the redistribution of Oudh Districts, which took place in 1869-70, four parg\u00e1ns\u2014viz. Inhauna, Rokh\u00e1 Jais, Simrauta, and Mohanganj\u2014were separated from Sult\u00e1npur and attached to R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli, while Subeh\u00e1 pargan\u00e1 was transferred to B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki. On the other hand, the parg\u00e1ns of Isauli, Sult\u00e1npur, Baraunsa, Aldemau, and a part of Surharpur, which formerly belonged to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, were transferred to Sult\u00e1npur, altering the total area to 1701 square miles, and the population to 1,000,336.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014With the exception of a gradual and scarcely perceptible slope from north-west to south-east, the surface of the country is generally level, being broken only by ravines in the neighbourhood of the rivers by which its drainage is effected. The scenery is of a varied character. Many spots on the Gumti are exceedingly pretty; but, for the most part, the country along both banks of that river is a dreary, black, and ravine-cut tract, occasionally relieved by mango groves. The centre of the District, along the high-road from Lucknow to Jaunpur, consists of highly cultivated and well wooded villages; while, in strong contrast to this fertile tract, in the south are widespread arid plains, and swampy jhils and marshes.\n\nThe principal river is the Gumti, which enters Sult\u00e1npur from B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki at its north-western corner, and after flowing an exceedingly tortuous south-easterly course through the centre of the District, passes into Jaunpur District in the North-Western Provinces. During the dry months, the breadth of the channel is about 200 feet, and its depth about 12 or 13 feet, with a current of about 2 miles an hour, and a discharge of about 5000 cubic feet per second. During seasons of flood, however, its depth occasionally rises to upwards of 48 feet, with a current of 4 miles an hour, and a discharge, at Sult\u00e1npur town, of upwards of 100,000 cubic feet per second. Of minor streams, the most important are the K\u00e1ndu, Pili, Tengha, and Nandhia. The K\u00e1ndu takes its rise in a morass near R\u00e1ipur village. In the upper or western portion of its course, it is a shallow streamlet, known as the Naiya. Near Jagd\u00edspur, it becomes a small river, with rugged banks, and is then called the K\u00e1ndu, under which name it finally empties itself into the Gumti. The Pili n\u00e1di becomes in the rains a considerable stream, but at other times consists of a string of disconnected jhils and swamps, which cover a great portion of the south of Ch\u00e1nda pargan\u00e1. The Tengha, so called from a village of the same name in pargan\u00e1 Amethi, discharges itself into the Cham-rauri, a tributary of the S\u00e1i. The Nandhia n\u00e1di first appears near the village of that name in pargan\u00e1 Tappa Asl, and ultimately unites with the Tengha at the point where that stream falls into the Cham-rauri. Both the Tengha and the Nandhia are streams of some import-\nance, as their channels are deep, though narrow, and form the outlet for the superfluous water of extensive series of jhils. One of these series, known as jhil Lodhai, commences near the village of Bhalg\u00e1on, and stretches through Goaw\u00e1n to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, a distance of 13 miles.\n\nThere is now no forest-covered tract in Sult\u00e1npur District, but sixty years ago a wide expanse of jungle is said to have extended from the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Amethi quite up to the Lucknow road; and the Bhadaiy\u00e1n jungle, which after the Mutiny occupied upwards of a thousand acres, is said to have been the remains of an extensive forest, patches of which are still to be found in villages far removed from Bhadaiy\u00e1n. The only tree-covered tracts of spontaneous growth at the present day are the stunted dh\u00e1k jungles, which are only of use for fuel. A substitute for forest timber exists in the large and noble groves with which the District is plentifully studded. The trees most in favour for groves are the mango, jam\u00fan, and mah\u00fad. The mah\u00fad is also often found alone, or in clumps of two or three, in open spots; as also are the bel, khitha, and n\u00edm. Grand old solitary trees of immense magnitude, the banian, the p\u00e1k\u00e1r, and the pip\u00e1l, planted perhaps in the days of Bhar supremacy, form here and there a prominent feature in a village landscape; and the cotton-tree and the dh\u00e1k are at one season of the year rendered conspicuous for a long distance by the brilliancy of their profusion of blossoms. The tamarind and the palm, which affect damp and feverish tracts, are comparatively rare in Sult\u00e1npur District. The b\u00e1b\u00fal is common everywhere. The sisu and the t\u00fan are only found in the civil station, or in avenues along the roadsides. The only mineral is kankar limestone. Wild animals are very few in number, chiefly wolves, nilg\u00e1i, wild hog, deer, and antelope. Small game, such as the hare, wild goose, partridge, quail, and wild duck, are common; and fish are abundant in the rivers, jhils, and large tanks.\n\nHistory.\u2014At the time of the invasion of Oudh by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00edd, Mahm\u00fad's lieutenant, Sult\u00e1npur fared for a time better than its neighbours, Jais and Jaunpur. Local traditions are unanimous in omitting all mention of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r's name, and in representing the Bhars to have remained masters of this part of the country until they were expelled by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. It afterwards formed part of the Jaunpur kingdom, and on the downfall of that dynasty became incorporated with the Delhi Empire. In Akbar's reign, Sult\u00e1npur formed a mah\u00e1l or fiscal division of the subah or Governorship of Oudh, with the exception of some tracts in the east and south, which were included within the subah of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The District continued to be thus distributed between these two governorships for about two centuries, or until the time of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs, when the limits of Oudh were extended by considerable transfers from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The only note-\nworthy incident in the history of the District since the British annexation of Oudh, is the revolt of the troops stationed at Sult\u00e1npur cantonment during the Mutiny of 1857. Anticipating an outbreak, the European ladies and children were despatched to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d on the 7th June, which they ultimately succeeded in reaching in safety, but after a good deal of rough treatment and plundering at the hands of the villagers. On the 9th June, the troops, consisting of 1 regiment of Native cavalry and 2 of infantry, rose in rebellion, and fired on their officers, killing Colonel Fisher, the commandant of the station, and Captain Gibbings, besides two civilian officers, Mr. A. Block and Mr. S. Stroyan. Upon the restoration of order, Sult\u00e1npur cantonment was strengthened by a detachment of British troops; but in 1861, it was entirely abandoned as a military station.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Sult\u00e1npur District, as at present constituted, after the recent transfers to and from R\u00e1i Bareli, B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki, and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, is returned at 1,000,336 persons, residing in 2526 villages or towns and 222,401 houses; average density of population, 588 per square mile. Classified according to sex, there are 507,293 males and 493,043 females; proportion of males in total population, 50.7 per cent. According to religion, there are 913,615 Hindus and 86,721 Muhammadans. There are no Christians returned in the Oudh Administration Report, from which the above figures are taken; but in the Census they are set down as numbering 83, all Europeans and Eurasians. Of Hindu castes, the most important, as also the most numerous, are the Br\u00e1hmans, who constitute 14 per cent. of the inhabitants of the District. Next, in both respects among the higher castes come the different Kshattriya clans, aggregating 8 per cent. of the population. Among low castes, the Ah\u00edrs are the most numerous, forming nearly 10 per cent. of the population, followed by the Cham\u00e1rs and P\u00e1s\u00eds. G\u00fajars are more common in Sult\u00e1npur than in other Districts of Oudh. Among the more skilful agricultural castes, Mur\u00e1os are numerous, but Kurmis are remarkably few. Of the Muhammadans, who form less than one-tenth of the entire population, only about one-fourth are Sayyids, Shaikhs, Mughals, or Path\u00e1ns; one-tenth is composed of converts from the principal Kshattriya clans, while the remainder comprise the lower orders of Musalm\u00e1ns. Agriculturists form 56.9 per cent. of the population. The only town in the District containing a population exceeding 5000 is the civil station of SULT\u00c1NPUR. In some parts, as in Mohanganj in the west, the villages are large, and situated at a distance from each other, the unsettled state of the country having induced the inhabitants to band themselves together for mutual protection. Farther east, on the other hand, villages are small, and hamlets abound; while in Ch\u00e1nda, in the extreme south-east, solitary houses are pretty thickly scattered over the parg\u00e1na. The\nprincipal religious shrines and fairs in the District are the following:\u2014Sit\u00e1kund, on the right bank of the Gumti, immediately below the civil station, is celebrated as the spot where S\u00edt\u00e1 is said to have bathed before accompanying her husband R\u00e1ma into his self-imposed exile. In commemoration of this event, a bathing fair is held twice a year in the months of Jaistha and K\u00e1rtik, attended by 15,000 or 20,000 persons. No trade is carried on beyond the sale of sweetmeats. Dhop\u00e1p, in the village of R\u00e1j\u00e1pati, on the Gumti, is a sacred, sin-cleansing part of the river. It was here that R\u00e1ma, on his return from the Lanka war, is said to have washed away the sin of having killed a Br\u00e1hman, in the person of R\u00e1vana, the demon king of Ceylon. Fairs are held here similar to those at Sit\u00e1kund.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of 1701 square miles, 890 square miles, or 509,600 acres, are returned as under cultivation. The main feature in the agriculture of the District is the predominance of wheat and rice to the almost total exclusion of other cereals, such as maize, barley, etc. The following statement shows the acreage under the different crops; but the figures refer to the old District, before the recent transfers to and from neighbouring Districts, and do not include do-fasli land, bearing two crops. Rabt or spring crops\u2014wheat, 148,092 acres; gram and arhar, 44,508; poppy, 5111; vegetables, 3205; oil-seeds, 133; miscellaneous, 48,247 acres. Khartf or winter crops\u2014rice, 201,233 acres; cotton, 5854; sugar-cane, 8056; indigo, 200; tobacco, 6261; jodr, 4200; oil-seeds, 765; vegetables, 2235; miscellaneous, 10,323 acres. The average price for different food grains during the ten years ending 1870 is returned as follows:\u2014Common unhusked rice, 31\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 6d. per cwt.; common husked rice, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.; best husked rice, 9\u00bd sers per rupee, or 11s. per cwt.; wheat, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; barley, 27 sers per rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; jodr, 26 sers per rupee, or 4s. 4d. per cwt.; gram, 24\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 7d. per cwt. In respect to the character of the landed tenures, Sult\u00e1npur is mainly a t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed District, owned by Bachgoti and R\u00e1jkumar Kshattriyas in the east, by Amethia Kshattriyas in the centre, and by Kanhpuria Kshattriyas in the west of the District. Out of 1913 villages, comprised in the old District, 1022\u00bd are returned as being held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed, 232 under zamind\u00e1r\u00ed, 476 under pattid\u00e1r\u00ed, and 182 under bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra tenure.\n\nMeans of Communication, etc.\u2014The principal road by which the District is intersected is the imperial high-road from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. It enters the District from the north, passes through the civil station, and, running nearly due south, crosses into Part\u00e1bgarh District. It is metalled and bridged throughout. The other main lines of road, which, although unmetalled, are bridged where necessary, are as follows:\u2014(1) The Lucknow and Jaunpur road, which enters the\nDistrict 2 miles east of Haidargarh, and leaves it 2 miles east of Chanda,\u2014total length within Sultanpur, 70 miles, in the course of which it passes through Inhauna, Nihalgarh, and Sarayan; it leaves the civil station 2 miles to the south, but is connected with it by three separate lines: (2) the Sultanpur and Rai Bareli road; and (3) the Faizabad and Rai Bareli road. These roads constitute the local trunk lines, and throw out lateral branches in various directions. The branch lines have a total length of upwards of 100 miles. Besides the above there are numerous village tracks, which are at present only practicable for country carts, at once strong and lightly laden. The Gumti, although not much used for passenger traffic, affords a valuable highway for commerce, being navigable here by cargo boats of from 30 to 35 tons burden. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway cuts across a corner of the District for a few miles in the extreme east.\n\nTrade and Commerce, Manufactures, etc.\u2014The principal articles of trade are grain, cotton, molasses, and native cloth. A considerable trade within the District is also carried on in cattle. Manufactures are quite unimportant. Coarse cotton cloth is woven by the Kori and Julaha castes. At Bandhu, brass vessels are manufactured, and other rough metal work is carried on. Sugar and indigo are made on a very small scale in pargan\u00e1 Chanda. Under native rule, the manufacture of salt and saltpetre was largely carried on, but it has now been discontinued. All villages of any consequence have their own b\u00e1z\u00e1srs, either permanent or periodical. The latter are often nothing more than open-air markets, held on certain fixed days of the week; the former are sometimes large walled enclosures, bisected by a road, and lined with shops on either side. These local b\u00e1z\u00e1srs are small but important centres of commerce. Every village may be said to be affiliated to one of them, and each of them in turn is connected in its dealings with one or more of the larger emporia. The principal b\u00e1z\u00e1srs are as follows:\u2014(1) Perkinsganj, at the civil station, founded shortly after the reoccupation of Oudh by Colonel Perkins, Deputy Commissioner. One of the newest, it is nevertheless one of the most flourishing markets in the District. A large trade is carried on here, and goods are brought for sale from a great distance. Its rapid growth has been favoured by the extremely convenient nature of its position. It is in close proximity to the District court-house, the sadr tahsil, and the th\u00e1nds; and is hence much frequented by persons whose business takes them to those places. It is also little more than half a mile from the right bank of the Gumti, so that if trade be slack here, unsold goods can be easily placed in boats and carried by water to Jaunpur. (2) Sukul b\u00e1z\u00e1sr, in the village of Mawayya Rahmatgarh, in pargan\u00e1 Jagdispur, founded about forty years ago by some members of a well-to-do Sukul (Br\u00e1hman) family. It shares with Perkinsganj the advantage of being near the Gumti.\nSULTANPUR DISTRICT.\n\n(3) Gauriganj, called after the deity of that name, and founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1dh\u00f3 Sinh of Amethi about twenty-five years ago. It is situated in the village of R\u00e1jgarh a few miles east of J\u00e1is. (4) Bandhu\u00e1, an old b\u00e1z\u00e1r on the Lucknow and Jaunpur road, close to Hasanpur. (5) Al\u00edganj, in the village of Unchg\u00e1on, parg\u00e1n\u00e1 Sult\u00e1npur, founded in 1795 by the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r of Mani\u00e1rpur.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue, imperial and local, of Sult\u00e1npur District in 1872 amounted to \u00a3138,127, of which \u00a3115,720 was derived from the land tax. The expenditure in the same year was only \u00a322,304. The District contains 8 civil and revenue, and 9 magisterial courts. For the protection of person and property, there is a regular police force of 379 officers and men, besides a village watch, numbering 2664. The daily average number of prisoners in jail during 1875 was 496. In 1875, the District contained in all 117 Government and inspected schools, attended by 4607 pupils. Of these, the principal is the High School at the civil station, which affords instruction in four languages, viz. English, Urdu, Hindi, and Persian, and teaches up to the standard of the entrance examination of the Calcutta University. Next in importance comes the town school of Jagd\u00edspur. The charitable institutions consist of 4 dispensaries, which in 1875 afforded gratuitous medical relief to 13,177 persons; and a poorhouse.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014The climate, judged by a tropical or semi-tropical standard, is mild, temperate, and healthy. From October to June westerly winds prevail; and during the first four of these months the atmosphere is dry, cold, and bracing, more particularly after rain, of which there is almost invariably a slight fall after Christmas. Towards the end of February the wind increases in force, the temperature becomes higher, and by the end of March, if not earlier, the hot winds set in. These, however, are much less trying in Sult\u00e1npur than in the more western Districts of Oudh. They do not begin till some hours after daybreak, and seldom continue long after nightfall, while they occasionally cease for several days together. In these intervals, which become more and more frequent as the hot weather progresses, a north-east wind takes their place. About the middle of June the rainy season commences, and, with occasional breaks of greater or less duration, continues till the end of September or beginning of October. During this period the wind scarcely ever shifts from the east. From the middle of October the weather gets cool and pleasant. The Report on the Meteorology of India for 1877 returns the average annual rainfall of Sult\u00e1npur for the previous ten years at 46\u00b717 inches, the highest rainfall of any Oudh District. The average monthly temperature at the Sult\u00e1npur Dispensary in May 1875 was returned at 95\u00b72\u00b0 F., in July 89\u00b73\u00b0, and in December 67\u00b72\u00b0.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The chief endemic diseases of Sult\u00e1npur are\nfevers, and it is estimated that about 10 per cent. of the population suffers every year from some form of this disease. Dysentery and diarrhoea come next, being most prevalent at the end of the rains and the commencement of the cold season. Leprosy is also common, as well as other cutaneous disorders. Cholera epidemics occurred in 1869, 1870, 1871, and 1872; but from the latter year to 1877, the disease has not appeared in an epidemic form. Small-pox is never wholly absent from the District. It is most fatal during the dry hot weather until the rains set in, after which the mortality decreases till it reaches a minimum, about the middle of the cold season. Vaccinators have been employed by Government in recent years, but their efforts have as yet been confined to the town of Sult\u00e1npur and the surrounding villages. Cattle-disease (rinderpest), of a very fatal type, is always more or less prevalent in the District.\n\nSult\u00e1npur.\u2014Tahsil or Subdivision of Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh; situated between 26\u00b0 3' and 26\u00b0 30' N. lat., and between 81\u00b0 46' and 82\u00b0 22' E. long.; bounded on the north by Bik\u00e1pur tahsil in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, on the east by Kadipur tahsil, on the south by R\u00e1ipur tahsil, and on the west by Musafarkh\u00e1na tahsil. Area, 504 square miles, of which 271 are cultivated; pop. (1869), 314,465, namely, Hindus, 282,239, and Muhammadans, 32,226; males, 159,832, and females, 154,633; average density of population, 624 per square mile. This Subdivision comprises the two pargans of Sult\u00e1npur and Sult\u00e1npur-Baraunsi.\n\nSult\u00e1npur.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh, stretching along the south bank of the Gumti. A rather dreary and dry expanse of country, with no large towns except Sult\u00e1npur, and intersected by ravines stretching down to the Gumti. Area, 246 square miles, of which 125 are cultivated; pop. (1869), 159,225, namely, Hindus, 138,357, and Muhammadans, 20,868. Number of villages, 401, of which 238 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri and 163 under samind\u00e1ri tenure. The most numerous class of the community are the Br\u00e1hmans, who number 22,789, but they only form a small proportion of the land-holding class. The Ch\u00e1mars come next in point of numbers with 19,829, and they also are not a land-holding class. The principal landed proprietors are the Bachgoti Kshattriyas, who own 94 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri and 96 samind\u00e1ri villages. The Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1da Bachgotis, who are converts to Muhammadanism, own 111 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri and 19 samind\u00e1ri villages.\n\nSult\u00e1npur.\u2014Town in Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh, and administrative headquarters of the District; situated on the right bank of the Gumti, in lat. 26\u00b0 15' 50\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 7' 10\" E. The original town, on the opposite or left bank of the river, is said to have been founded by Kusa, son of R\u00e1ma, and to have been named after him\nKusapura or Kusabh\u00e1wanpur. It subsequently fell into the hands of the Bhars, who retained it until it was taken from them by the Musalm\u00e1ns in the 12th century A.D. About seven hundred years ago, it is said that two brothers, Sayyid Muhammad and Sayyid Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, horse dealers by profession, visited Eastern Oudh, and offered some horses for sale to the Bhar chieftains of Kusabh\u00e1wanpur, who seized the horses and put the two brothers to death. This came to the ears of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, who determined to punish such an outrage upon the descendants of the prophet. Gathering a mighty host, therefore, he set out for Kusabh\u00e1wanpur, and at length arrived and pitched his tents in Karaundi, then a dense jungle near the devoted town, on the opposite side of the river. Here he remained encamped for a year without gaining any advantage over the besieged; until, feigning to be weary of the fruitless contest, and anxious only to obtain an unmolested retreat, he had some hundreds of palanquins richly fitted up, and sent them as a peace-offering to the Bhars, pretending that they were filled with presents. The cupidity of the Bhars overcame their caution, and they received the pretended gifts within their walls. At a given signal, the palanquins were thrown open, and there sprang out a crowd of armed warriors, who, thus taking their enemies unprepared, speedily put them to the sword. Kusabh\u00e1wanpur was reduced to ashes, and a new town called Sult\u00e1npur, after the title of the victor, rose upon its ruins. Sult\u00e1npur is often mentioned by Muhammadan chroniclers, but does not seem to have been a place of any great note, although at one time a flourishing little town, with several mahallas or wards. During the earlier half of the present century, a military station or cantonment was established by the native Government on the opposite bank of the river, and from this time the old town began to decline. In 1839, it was described as having no manufacture or trade, and with a population of only 1500. The place was finally razed to the ground during the military operations connected with the re-occupation of the Province after the Mutiny, in consequence of the inhabitants having been concerned in the murder of two British civilians at the time of the outbreak. The military cantonment was then occupied by a regiment of Native cavalry, and two of Native infantry, who rose in mutiny on the 9th June 1857, and, after firing on and murdering two of their officers, sacked the station, and proceeded to join the main body of the rebels. On the re-occupation of the Province, a detachment of European troops was stationed here for a time; but in 1861, all the troops, British and Native, were withdrawn, and the place ceased to be a military cantonment. The present civil station occupies the site of the old cantonments, and contained a population in 1869 of 5708. It has been much improved of late years; the unsightliness of the bleak ravines leading down to the river is hidden by the foliage of acacia trees, and the roads are lined\non either side with rows of mango and other shade-giving trees. A fine public garden, more than 10 acres in extent, has also been laid out. The principal public buildings are the court-houses, jail, police station, Government schools, charitable dispensary, and church.\n\n**Sult\u00e1npur.**\u2014Town in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, and headquarters of Kullu tahsil; situated in Kullu Proper, on the right bank of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), in lat. 31\u00b0 58' N., and long. 77\u00b0 7' E., at an elevation of 4092 feet above sea level. Pop. (1868), 1100. Successively the seat of administration under the Kullu R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the Sikhs, and the British. Perched upon a natural eminence, and once surrounded by a wall, so that it must have formerly been a place of great strength. Only two gateways now remain of the ancient fortifications. Large rambling palace, with sloping slate roof and cut-stone walls. Suburb inhabited by Lah\u00falis, who seek a refuge in Sult\u00e1npur from the severity of their own winter. Many shops owned by traders from K\u00e1ngra, Lah\u00fal, and L\u00e1d\u00e1kh. Considerable transit trade between the plains and Leh or Central Asia; estimated value in 1862, \u00a323,000, risen in 1870 to \u00a3150,000. Important fair every year in October, when 80 minor divinities come up to pay their respects at the shrine of Raghu\u0144\u00e1th Ji, the orthodox superior deity. Tahsil, police station, post office, dispensary, sard\u00ed (native rest-house).\n\n**Sult\u00e1npur.**\u2014Saline tract in Gurg\u00e1o\u0144 and Rohtak Districts, Punjab. Salt is manufactured from brine in wells, evaporated by solar heat in shallow pans. This tract lies on the banks of the great Najafgarh jhil, and the principal works, both as to quantity and quality of produce, are in a cluster of villages on the borders of the two Districts. The total area of the saline region is 1565 acres, the number of wells 330, and the number of pans 3799. The quantity manufactured at all the wells in 1871-72 was 456,411 maunds, the greater portion of which was consumed in Delhi. Sult\u00e1npur salt also finds a market in the Upper Do\u00e1b, Rohilkhand, the eastern Punjab, and even in Oudh and M\u00edrz\u00e1pur. The demand increases yearly, and the prospects of the trade are excellent. The works could turn out, if necessary, an estimated quantity of 50,000 tons annually. The great drawback has hitherto consisted in the want of efficient transport, now afforded by the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway.\n\n**Sult\u00e1npur.**\u2014Town in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated 9 miles north-west of Sah\u00e1ranpur town. Pop. (1872), 3022. Founded by Sult\u00e1n Bahlol Lodi about 1450 A.D. Noted for the number and wealth of its Jain or Sarangi merchants, who carry on a considerable trade in sugar and salt with the Punjab.\n\n**Sumdiri.**\u2014River in the north of Lakhimpur District, Assam, which rises far up amid the Daphl\u00e1 Hills, and, flowing south, ultimately falls into the Subans\u00edr\u012b, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. Among its\nown affluents, within British territory, are the Gari\u00e1j\u00e1n, Dhol, and Gh\u00e1g\u00e1r.\n\n**Sumerpur.**\u2014Town in Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces; standing on the open plain, in lat. 25\u00b0 50' N., and long. 80\u00b0 12' 5\" E., 9 miles south-east of Ham\u00edrpur town. Pop. (1872), 5599, consisting of 5152 Hindus and 447 Muhammadans. Anciently a place of some importance, as proved by the numerous mounds and ruins in the town itself and its vicinity. Pottery and coins have been found among the remains. Two ruined forts, respectively attributed by tradition to a Naw\u00e1b of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d and Kham\u00e1n Sinh, a Bundela chief in the middle of the last century. Police station, tahsili school.\n\n**Sumesar** *(Sumeswar).*\u2014Hill range in Champ\u00e1ran District, Beng\u00e1l, lying between 27\u00b0 20' and 27\u00b0 30' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 5' and 84\u00b0 39' E. long. The frontier line with Nep\u00e1l runs along the top of these hills, from the K\u00fad\u00ed nadi to the source of the Panchnad river. The total length of the chain is about 46 miles, the highest point being 2270 feet high, and the average height 1500 feet. In some places the range is inaccessible to man. The character of the surface varies, being rocky and barren in some places, while in others it is thickly studded with trees or covered with grass. At the eastern extremity, where the K\u00fad\u00ed nadi divides the range, is situated the pass leading into Deogh\u00e1t in Nep\u00e1l, through which the British army successfully marched in 1814-15. The other principal passes are the Sumesar, K\u00e1pan, and Harlan Harha.\n\n**Sumla.**\u2014One of the petty States in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay; consisting of 2 villages, with 4 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3762; of which \u00a396 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a310 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Sumpter** *(Samptar).*\u2014Native State in Bundelkhand.\u2014See Samthar.\n\n**Sun\u00e1mganj.**\u2014Town in Sylhet District, Assam.\u2014See Sonamganj.\n\n**Sunapur.**\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras.\u2014See Sonapur.\n\n**Sunda.**\u2014Town in North K\u00e1\u00f1ana District, Madras.\n\n**Sundarap\u00e1ndiam** *(called after a P\u00e1ndyan king, perhaps the 'Sender Bandi' of Marco Polo).*\u2014Agricultural village in Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras. Lat. 9\u00b0 36' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 44' 15\" E.; pop. (1871), 9290, inhabiting 2069 houses.\n\n**Sundarbans, The.**\u2014A vast tract of forest and swamp, forming the southernmost portion of the Gangetic Delta, Bengal; extends along the sea-face of the Bay of Bengal, from the estuary of the H\u00fagl\u00ed to that of the Meghn\u00e1. Lat. 21\u00b0 30' 40\" to 22\u00b0 37' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 4' 30\" to 91\u00b0 14' 0\" E. The Sundarbans occupy an area of 7532 square miles; their extreme length along the coast is about 165 miles, and their greatest breadth from north to south about 81 miles. They are bounded on the north by the permanently settled lands of the Districts of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Jess\u00f3r, and B\u00e1karganj; on the west and\neast by the estuaries of the H\u00fagl\u00ed and the Meghn\u00e1 respectively; and on the south by the Bay of Bengal. No information exists showing the separate population of the Sundarbans, this tract being included in the Census Report (1872) with the adjoining Districts. The Sundarbans are administered by a special Commissioner.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The country is one vast alluvial plain, where the continual process of land-making has not yet ceased. It abounds in morasses and swamps, now gradually filling up, and is intersected by large rivers and estuaries running from north to south. These are connected with each other by an intricate series of branches, and the latter in their turn by innumerable smaller channels; so that the whole tract is a tangled network of streams, rivers, and water-courses, enclosing a large number of islands of various shapes and sizes. It is bordered by a fringe of reclaimed land situated along the northern boundary, except in B\u00e1karganj, where some of the clearings extend almost down to the sea. These reclaimed tracts are entirely devoted to rice cultivation. There are no 'villages' in the ordinary acceptation of the word; and the cultivators live far apart in little hamlets among their fields. The unreclaimed portion of the Sundarbans near the sea consists of impenetrable jungle and thick underwood, traversed by gloomy-looking water-courses. This thick jungle forms an admirable protection against the storm-waves which sometimes accompany cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. A list of the principal trees of the Sundarbans forests will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. i. pp. 304-309. The commonest of them is the sundri (Heritiera littoralis), which abounds throughout the tract, and yields a good hard wood, used for building purposes, and for making carriage shafts, furniture, and boats. Most of the boats in the Sundarbans, and in the northern portions of the Districts of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Jessor, and B\u00e1karganj, are made, wholly or in part, of this tree. A total area of 1581 square miles in the Sundarbans has been demarcated as 'reserved forests;' and a considerable proportion of the remaining area has also been placed under the Forest Department as 'protected forests.' In 1877-78, the total forest revenue received was \u00a317,400, as against charges amounting to only \u00a33345. The aggregate amount of firewood and timber removed under cognisance of the officials was 9,103,250 maunds, on which toll was levied at the rate of 1 ann\u00e1 (\u00bdd.) per maund for sundri timber, and 1 pice (\u00bd farthing) per maund for all other wood.\n\nThe physical features vary considerably in different portions of the Sundarbans, and the whole tract may be divided, according to these variations, into three sections\u2014(1) a western part, including the country lying between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and the Jamun\u00e1 and Kalind\u00ed rivers; (2) a central part, between the Jamun\u00e1 and the Baleswar; and (3) the eastern\nportion, extending from the Baleswar to the Meghn\u00e1. The first and the last of these sections lie comparatively high, and the ground slopes downwards towards the central tract, which is low and swampy. In the western division, the water of the streams is, for the most part, salt; and the cultivated lands are surrounded by high embankments, dotted over with scattered clusters of huts. In the central marshy parts, there are no habitations, the cultivators never living on or near their fields; the water is not salt, and the embankments which surround the fields are lower than in the west. In the eastern portion, the lands being high, and the river water comparatively fresh, embankments are not necessary for the protection of the crops; the soil, too, is richer than in the western and central portions; and every well-to-do peasant has his granaries surrounded by a grove of palms and other trees.\n\nIt is impossible to give an account of the river system of the Sundarbans which shall be at once detailed and intelligible. The reader who desires special information regarding any of the estuaries of the Ganges Delta, should consult Horsburgh's *Sailing Directions*. We must satisfy ourselves with giving here the principal arms of the sea: they are, proceeding from west to east, the H\u00fagl\u00ed, Sattarmukh\u00ed, J\u00e1mir\u00e1, Matl\u00e1, B\u00e1ng\u00e1duni, Gu\u00e1sub\u00e1, R\u00e1imangal, M\u00e1lanch\u00e1, B\u00e1ra P\u00e1ng\u00e1, Marj\u00e1t\u00e1 or K\u00e1g\u00e1, B\u00e1ngar\u00e1, Haringh\u00e1t\u00e1 or Baleswar, Rabn\u00e1b\u00e1d channel, and the Meghn\u00e1 river. The wild animals found in the Sundarbans are tigers (which are very numerous, and cause much havoc, often seriously interfering with the work of reclamation), leopards, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, hogs, wild cats, deer of several varieties, porcupines, otters, monkeys, etc. Fish abound; and the python, cobra, and many other kinds of snake are found. Among the birds of the Sundarbans are adjutants, vultures, pelicans, kites, hawks, owls, doves, green pigeons, parrots, parroquets, jungle-fowl, kingfishers, jays, orioles, snipe, teal, pheasants, plover, partridges, and every description of water-fowl.\n\n**History, etc.\u2014**The name 'Sundarban' has been variously explained, some deriving it from sundar, beautiful, and ban, forest; others from the sundri, which is, as already stated, the commonest tree in the jungles. Sundri simply means 'beautiful,' but the word has been connected by some writers with sindur, 'vermilion,' the wood being of a reddish colour. A much less probable derivation traces the word to Chandrawip, the name of an old samind\u00e1ri pargan\u00e1; while, according to another but altogether unlikely etymology, the tract took its name from the Chandabhandas, or Shandabhandas, a tribe of salt-makers. The extension of the name to the whole coast is modern. It has long been a disputed point whether the Sundarbans were formerly inhabited.\n\n---\n\n1 London : 1852. Quoted, so far as the Sundarbans rivers are concerned, in vol. i. of the *Statistical Account of Bengal*, pp. 294-299.\nRemains of buildings\u2014houses and gh\u00e1ts\u2014have been found in isolated parts of the jungle, showing that at any rate there were occasional settlers in those parts. But no evidence has yet been obtained to prove that the tract south of the present limit of cultivation was, as has often been asserted, at one time studded with towns or villages. It seems, on the contrary, probable that the northern limit has remained for about 400 years where it is at present. The question will be found discussed at some length in the Statistical Account of Bengal (vol. i. pp. 320, 321, 380-385). A very remarkable depression of the surface appears to have taken place at some not very distant period, large sundri trees having been found (not only in the Sundarbans, but as far north as Sialdah, a suburb of Calcutta) standing as they grew, at depths varying from 10 to 30 feet below the present level of the country. Various attempts have been made to account for this circumstance, but it has not yet been satisfactorily explained.\n\nReclamation of the Sundarbans.\u2014The earliest historical attempt to reclaim the Sundarbans was made by Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n, a Muhammadan chief, who died in 1459 A.D., and whose clearings at B\u00e1gherhat in Jessor remain to this day (v. Jessor). The more recent attempts date from 1782, when Mr. Henckell, the first English judge and magistrate of Jessor, inaugurated the system of reclamation at present existing. He began by establishing market-places at Kachn\u00e1, Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed, and Henckellganj, on the line of water communication between Calcutta and the eastern Districts. Henckellganj, named after its founder by his native agent, appears as Hingulgunge on the Survey maps. All these places were at that time in the forest, and Mr. Henckell's first step was to make clearings of the jungle; that done, the lands immediately around the clearings were gradually brought under cultivation. In 1784, Mr. Henckell submitted a scheme for the reclamation of the Sundarbans, which met with the approval of the Board of Revenue. The principal proposal was, that grants of jungle land should be made on favourable terms to people undertaking to reclaim them; and Mr. Henckell urged the scheme on the grounds that it would yield a revenue from lands then utterly unproductive, and that by the cultivation a reserve fund of rice would be formed against seasons of drought, the crops in the Sundarbans being very little dependent upon rainfall. In 1787, Mr. Henckell was appointed 'Superintendent for cultivating the Sundarbans,' and already at that time 7000 acres were under cultivation. In the following year, however, disputes arose with the zamind\u00e1rs who possessed lands adjoining the Sundarbans grants; and as the zamind\u00e1rs not only claimed a right to lands cultivated by holders of these grants, but enforced their claims, the number of grants began to fall off rapidly. Mr. Henckell showed the cause of this falling off, and expressed a conviction that if the\nboundaries of the lands held by the neighbouring zamindars were only settled, the number of grants would at once increase again; but the Board of Revenue had grown lukewarm about the whole scheme, and in 1790 practically abandoned it. Several of the old grants forthwith relapsed into jungle. In 1807, however, applications which had for some time previously ceased began to come in again; and since that time, reclamation has steadily progressed, until, in 1872, the Commissioner of the Sundarbans estimated the area under cultivation at 695,733 acres, or 1087 square miles, of which 493,907 acres, or two-thirds of the whole, were reclaimed between 1830 and 1872. The number of estates in the latter year was 431, paying a land revenue of \u00a341,757.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No separate Census has ever been taken of the population of the Sundarbans; the inhabitants being enumerated almost entirely in the Twenty-four Parganas, Jessore, and Bakarganj Districts. The Hindus of the tract belong, almost without exception, to the low S\u00fadra castes; the Muhammadans in the B\u00e1karganj section, and in part of Eastern Jessore, are Far\u00e1\u00edz\u00eds, who are a turbulent and litigious sect, though not actively fanatical. The bulk of the population has come from the Districts in the north, but in the eastern portion (the B\u00e1karganj Sundarbans) there is a considerable proportion of immigrant Maghs from the Ar\u00e1k\u00e1n coast. As has already been stated, there are no towns or villages in the Sundarbans; a list of the river-side trading marts will be found below. Port Canning, on the Matl\u00e1 river, was formerly a municipality; it was started by an English company to supply an auxiliary harbour to Calcutta, with which town it is connected by rail. The attempt failed, and the place is now quite deserted.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal staple of the Sundarbans is rice, of which two crops (dus or autumn, and \u00e1man or winter harvest) are raised in the year; the former, however, is only cultivated to a very limited extent. The rice of the eastern and western portions of the Sundarbans is said to be of finer quality than that grown in the central tract. The cultivators grow a few other crops\u2014vegetables, pulses, etc.\u2014for home consumption. Sugar-cane and p\u00e1n are cultivated in the B\u00e1karganj Sundarbans; and successful attempts have been made to grow jute. The price of ordinary rice varies from 3s. 9d. to 5s. 6d. a cwt. Wages are for the most part paid in kind. An account of the tenures of the Sundarbans will be found in the article on Jessore.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, and the storm-waves which sometimes accompany them, are the only natural calamities to which the Sundarbans are subject. The inlying tracts are to a great extent protected from the effect of these storm-waves by the belt of thick jungle near the sea, as well as by the sandhills formed along the coast by the heavy silt-laden swell which rolls shoreward during the south-west monsoon.\nTrade.\u2014There are several river-side trading villages on the border between the Sundarbans and the adjacent Districts; and as almost all the traffic between Calcutta and the eastern Districts is carried on by boat routes through the Sundarbans, the periodical markets held at these places are well attended. The principal of them are\u2014B\u00e1sr\u00e1 and Basantpur, on the boundary-line between the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s and the Sundarbans; and Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed, Morellganj, and Khuln\u00e1, near the Jessore Sundarbans. By far the most valuable export of the Sundarbans is timber and firewood. According to the registration returns for 1876-77, about 57,000 tons of timber, valued at \u00a3480,000, and 157,000 tons of firewood, valued at \u00a3110,000, were imported into Calcutta. Other products of the Sundarbans which form articles of trade are canes and reeds (of which baskets and mats are made), honey, beeswax, and shell lime. Large quantities of fish are caught and sent to Calcutta.\n\nThe Sundarbans Waterways are of the first importance, as being the chief means of communication between Calcutta and the East. Not only the jungle produce of the Sundarbans, but also the rice, jute, and oil-seeds of all Eastern and Northern Bengal, as well as the tea of Assam and Cachar, are carried by one or other of these routes. Nearly all the innumerable cross channels which divide the Sundarbans into a network of islands are navigable; but traffic naturally follows certain defined routes, which are themselves liable to change, as old streams silt up and new channels open out year by year. The central mart of the Sundarbans is Khulna in Jessore, at the junction of the Atharabanka and the Bhairab rivers, towards which all the great boat-routes converge. Khulna is about 51 miles by water due east of Calcutta, with which it is connected by the 'Calcutta Canals,' under the supervision of the Public Works Department. The two 'Calcutta Canals' proper terminate at Samukpata and Bamanghata, 16 and 12 miles respectively from Calcutta; but the tow-path is continued as far as Khulna itself, so that boats can proceed by tracking at any state of the tide. From Khulna, routes branch off north, east, and south. The chief northern route proceeds up the Atharabanka, the Madhumati, and the Gorai, into the Padma or main channel of the Ganges, and brings down the produce, not only of Northern Bengal, but also of Behar, during the dry season, when the Nadiya rivers are closed. In recent years, the silting up of this route has led to its abandonment by steamers. The eastern route from Khulna passes down the Bhairab, and then by Barisal through Bakarganj District to Dacca. The principal southern route comes out at Morrellganj. In 1876-77, the total number of boats registered as passing Khulna was 130,313. All these streams are tidal, and the mode of navigation by country boats is by using the ebb and flow of the tide. Part of every day's journey has to be made with the ebb, and part with the flow, so that the speed of the\nvoyage depends entirely upon the success with which each tide is caught. A whole fleet of boats may be seen at the recognised anchorages waiting for the tide; and the District from which they come can be readily distinguished by the shape of the bow and stern. Some of these anchorages are far from any habitations of men; but all sorts of necessaries (including water) are for sale at a sort of floating b\u0101s\u0101r. Large boats take about five days to get from Morrellganj to Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed, and between these two places there is not a single permanent village. The steamer-routes through the Sundarbans are not the same as those followed by country boats. But even steamers avoid as much as possible the difficult navigation of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river and the open sea. They cross the Districts of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s and Jessor by a route lying far to the south, and hardly catch sight of a human abode until they appear at Morrellganj.\n\nThe Calcutta and South-Eastern State Railway, originally intended to connect Calcutta with Port Canning on the Matl\u00e1, may now, since the abandonment of that port, be regarded as merely a means of local communication through the Sundarbans. Its total length is only 28 miles, and the traffic is almost entirely confined to the conveyance of firewood and a little rice to Calcutta. It was purchased by Government in 1868, by repayment of the capital that had been expended by the guaranteed company. Up to 31st March 1878, the total capital outlay had been \u00a3660,480. In the calendar year 1878, the gross receipts were \u00a312,828, and the gross expenses \u00a39,437; the net earnings were thus \u00a33391, or 5 per cent., being the highest figure yet obtained. The total number of passengers carried was 598,108, and the total quantity of goods 33,044 tons.\n\nFor further information regarding the Sundarbans, the reader is referred to the articles on the Twenty-four Parganas, Jessor, and Bakarganj.\n\nSundarganj.\u2014Trading village and produce depot in Rangpur District, Bengal.

Area, 400 square miles. It lies between a range of hills and the river Sabari, on the left bank of which stands Sunkam, the chief village. The forests contain much excellent teak.\n\nSunth.\u2014Native State in the Political Agency of Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Bombay. Area, 394 square miles; pop. (1872), 49,675. It is bounded on the north by the States of Dungarpur and Bansw\u00e1ra, and by the Jh\u00e1lod Subdivision of the British District of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; on the south by B\u00e1riya State under Rewa K\u00e1ntha, and by the Godhra\nSubdivision of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; and on the west by Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra State.\n\nGeneral Aspects.\u2014This territory is one of the wildest in Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The country is rugged, being broken up by bare hills with valleys between. The soil is stony, but fertile. Irrigation is carried on from tanks and wells. The chief products are cereals and timber.\n\nHistory.\u2014The family of the chief of Sunth belongs to the division of R\u00e1jputs known as Powars, and was originally settled at Ujjain. The dynasty was driven thence (it is stated in the roth century A.D.), and after some vicissitudes of fortune, settled at Jh\u00e1lod. There is a legend that the Emperor, hearing of the exceeding beauty of the daughter of Jh\u00e1lam Sinh, R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Jh\u00e1lod, demanded her in marriage, and that on Jh\u00e1lam Sinh declining the alliance, he was attacked by the Mughal army, and was defeated and killed. His son, R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sunth, fled for safety to the Sunth jungles, then under the sway of a Bhil chief called Sutta. In the year 1255, Sunth defeated Sutta, and took possession of his capital, called Brahmapuri. He changed its name to Sunth, and established his own dynasty. According to another tradition, the Sunth family is said to have come from Dh\u00e1r in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, when that principality was conquered by the Muhammadans. The State was tributary to Sindhia, but, along with Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra, the control over it was transferred to the British Government in 1812. The present chief (1876-77) is Mah\u00e1r\u00e1na Part\u00e1b Sinh, a R\u00e1jput of the Punwar clan. He is a minor of fifteen, and is under tuition at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a38000, inclusive of transit dues; and pays a tribute of \u00a3700 jointly to the British Government and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. A military force is maintained of 140 men. During the minority of the chief, the affairs of the State are under the charge of the Political Agent of Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The family follows the rule of primogeniture in point of succession.\n\nSunth.\u2014Chief town of Sunth State, Bombay.

Area, 1275 square miles; number of villages, 678; houses, 97,217. Pop. (1872), 565,747, of whom 510,690, or 90\u00b73 per cent., were Hindus; 54,981, or 9\u00b77 per cent., Muhammadans; 70 Christians; and 6 of other denominations. Proportion of males in total population, 50\u00b78 per cent.; average density of population, 444 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 0\u00b753; persons per village, 834; houses per square mile, 76; persons per house, 5\u00b78. This Subdivision comprises the 3 police circles of S\u00fap\u00fal, Bang\u00e1on, and\nN\u00e1thpur. In 1870-71, there was 1 magisterial and revenue court; a regular police force of 71 men; and a rural watch of 941; the cost of Subdivisional administration was returned at \u00a33848.\n\nS\u00fap\u00fal.\u2014Town (or more properly a collection of three villages, S\u00fap\u00fal Bhelah\u00ed, and Karael) in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal. Headquarters of the Subdivision of the same name. Lat. 26\u00b0 6' 25\" N., long. 86\u00b0 38' 11\" E.; pop. (1872), 2178. Almost all the dwellings are built of reeds, as, the soil being sandy, earthen walls cannot be raised. The inhabitants consist of Banias, who deal in rice, cloth, and sweetmeats; a few weavers, Br\u00e1hmans, and K\u00e1yasths, and a considerable number of Musalm\u00e1ns. The suburban villages are wholly agricultural.\n\nSur\u00e1jgarha.\u2014Town in Monghyr District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 15' 25\" N., long. 86\u00b0 16' 1\" E.; pop. (1872), 7935, of whom 4245 were males and 3690 females.\n\nSur\u00e1jpur.\u2014Pargand in B\u00e1ra B\u00e1nki District, Oudh; bounded on the north and east by the Kaly\u00e1ni river, on the south by the Gumti, and on the west by Siddhaur pargand. Area, 81,645 acres, of which 37,052 acres are cultivated; pop. (1869), 65,953, namely, Hindus, 62,955, and Muhammadans, 2998. This pargand comprises 107 villages, of which 57 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 43 under zamin\u00e9d\u00e1ri, and 7 under pattid\u00e1ri tenure. Government land revenue, \u00a39648. The chief village, founded 600 years ago, gives its name to the pargand. The tract was originally in possession of the Bhars, who were ousted by Path\u00e1ns. During the reign of Akbar, the Path\u00e1n proprietor, Awar Kh\u00e1n, refused to pay revenue. A force was sent against him, under R\u00e1j\u00e1 Baram B\u00e1li, when he was defeated, and his lands made over to the victor, the ancestor of the present t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r.\n\nSur\u00e1jpur.\u2014Village in Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the right bank of the Ganges, in lat. 26\u00b0 9' N., and long. 80\u00b0 39' E. Several Hindu temples and gh\u00e1ts or bathing-steps, some in ruins, line the water's edge. B\u00e1z\u00e1r.\n\nSur\u00e1m.\u2014Tahsil of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the north bank of the Ganges.

It contains the Salem railway station on the Madras Railway (207 miles from Madras), which was opened in 1861.\n\nSurat.\u2014A British District in Guzerat, Bombay, lying between 20\u00b0 15' and 21\u00b0 28' N. lat., and between 72\u00b0 38' and 73\u00b0 30' 30\" E. long.; with an area of 1669 square miles, and a population in 1872 of 607,087 souls. Surat is bounded on the north by Broach District, and the Native State of Baroda; on the east by the States of Baroda, R\u00e1jpipla,\nSURAT DISTRICT.\n\nB\u00e1nsda, and Dharampur; on the south by Th\u00e1na (Tanna) District and the Portuguese territory of Daman; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. A broad strip of Baroda territory separates the north-western from the south-eastern portion of the District. The administrative headquarters are at the city of Surat.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Surat District consists of a broad alluvial plain, stretching between the D\u00e1ng Hills and the coast, from the Kim river on the north, to the Dam\u00e1nganga on the south. The coast-line runs along the Arabian Sea, where it begins to narrow into the Gulf of Cambay. Small hillocks of drifted sand fringe the greater part of the shore, in some parts dry and barren, but in others watered by springs, enclosed by hedges, and covered with a thick growth of creepers and date-palms. Through the openings of the river mouths, however, the tide runs up behind the barrier of sandhills, and floods either permanently or temporarily a large area of salt-marshes. Beyond spreads a central alluvial belt of highly cultivated land, with a width of about 60 miles in the north, where the important river T\u00e1pti forms a deep and fertile delta; but as the coast-line trends towards the south, the hills at the same time draw nearer to the coast, and so restrict the alluvial country to a breadth of little more than 15 miles on the Dam\u00e1n border. The deep loam brought down by the T\u00e1pti gives a level aspect to the northern tract; but farther south, a number of small and rapid rivers have cut themselves ravine-like beds, between which lie rougher uplands with a scantier soil and poorer vegetation. In the hollows, and often on the open plain, rich deposits of black cotton-soil overlie the alluvium. The eastern border of the District consists of less fruitful lands, cut up by small torrents, and interspersed with mounds of rising ground. Here the huts of an ill-fed and almost unsettled peasantry replace the rich villages of skilled cultivators in the central lowland. On the border, this wild region passes gradually into the hills and forests of the D\u00e1ngs, an unhealthy jungle which none but the black aboriginal tribes can visit save at special periods of the year. The hills themselves consist of trap in many varieties, from solid basalt to soft amygdaloid, and belong orographically to the great trappean plateau of Central and Western India. Here cultivation entirely disappears, and the whole country lies under wild brushwood. The chief rivers of Surat are the T\u00e1pti and the Kim, on the former of which stands the city of Surat. The T\u00e1pti gives rise to the largest alluvial lowland in the District; but its frequent floods till lately caused great loss of life and damage to property. It enjoys a reputation for sanctity in Western India second only to that of the Narbad\u00e1. The District contains no natural lakes; but reservoirs cover a total area of 10,838 acres. With one exception, they consist of small ponds, formed by throwing horseshoe embankments across the natural lines of drainage. The fauna\nincludes a few tigers, stragglers from the jungles of B\u00e1nsda and Dharampur, besides leopards, bears, wild boars, wolves, hy\u00e6nas, spotted deer, and antelopes. Duck and other wildfowl abound during the cold season on the ponds and reservoirs.\n\n**History.**\u2014Surat was one of the earliest portions of India brought into close relations with European countries, and its history merges almost entirely into that of its capital, long the greatest maritime city of the peninsula. The city appears to be comparatively modern in its origin; though the local Musalm\u00e1n historians assert that at the commencement of the 13th century Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, after defeating Bhim Deo, R\u00e1jput king of Anhilw\u00e1ra, penetrated as far south as R\u00e1nder and Surat. The District then formed part of the dominions ruled over by a Hindu chief, who fled from his fortress at K\u00e1nrej, 13 miles east of Surat city, and submitted to the Musalm\u00e1n conqueror, so obtaining leave to retain his principality. In 1347, during the Guzerat rebellion in the reign of Muhammad Tughlak, Surat was given up to be plundered by the troops of the Emperor. In 1373, Firoz Tughlak built a fort at Surat to protect the town against the Bh\u00edls. During the 15th century, no notice of Surat occurs in the chronicles of the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d. But tradition generally assigns the foundation of the modern city to the beginning of the 16th century, when a rich Hindu trader, Gopi by name, settled here, and made many improvements. As early as 1514, the Portuguese traveller, Barbosa, describes Surat as \u2018a very important seaport, frequented by many ships from Malabar and all other ports.\u2019 Two years before, the Portuguese had burnt the town, an outrage which they repeated in 1530 and 1531. Thereupon, the Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d king gave orders for building a stronger fort, completed about 1546. In 1572, Surat fell into the hands of the Mirz\u00e1s, then in rebellion against the Emperor Akbar. Early in the succeeding year, Akbar arrived in person before the town, which he captured after a vigorous siege. For 160 years, the city and District remained under the administration of officers appointed by the Mughal court. During the reigns of Akbar, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, Surat enjoyed unbroken peace, and rose to be one of the first mercantile cities of India. In Akbar\u2019s great Revenue Survey, the city is mentioned as a first-class port, ruled by two distinct officers. Since 1573, the Portuguese had remained undisputed masters of the Surat seas. But in 1608, an English ship arrived at the mouth of the T\u00e1pti, bringing letters from James I to the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. Mukarab Kh\u00e1n, the Mughal governor, allowed the captain to bring his merchandise into the town. Next year, a second English ship arrived off Guzerat, but was wrecked on the Surat coast. The Portuguese endeavoured to prevent the ship-wrecked crew from settling in the town, and they accordingly went up to Agra with their captain. In 1609, Bah\u00e1dur, the last Musalm\u00e1n king of\nAhmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, attempted unsuccessfully to recover Surat from the Mughals. Two years later, a small fleet of 3 English ships arrived in the T\u00e1pti; but as the Portuguese occupied the coast and entrance, the English admiral, Sir H. Middleton, was compelled to anchor outside. Small skirmishes took place between the rival traders, until in the end the English withdrew. In 1612, however, the Governor of Guzerat concluded a treaty by which our countrymen were permitted to trade at Surat, Cambay, Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Gogo. After a fierce fight with the Portuguese, the English made good their position, established a factory, and shortly after obtained a charter from the Emperor. Surat thus became the seat of a Presidency under the East India Company. The Company's ships usually anchored in a roadstead north of the mouth of the T\u00e1pti, called in old books 'Swally' or 'Swally Road,' but correctly Suw\u00e1li. Continued intrigues between the Portuguese and the Mughals made the position of the English traders long uncertain, till Sir Thomas Roe arrived in 1615, and went on to Ajmere, where Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr then held his court. After three years' residence there, Roe returned to the coast in 1618, bringing important privileges for the English. Meanwhile, the Dutch had also made a settlement in Surat, and obtained leave to establish a factory. Early travellers describe the city as populous and wealthy, with handsome houses and a great trade. The fifty years between the establishment of the English and Dutch, and the accession of Aurangzeb, formed a time of great and increasing prosperity for Surat. With the access of wealth, the town improved greatly in appearance. During the busy winter months, lodgings could hardly be obtained, owing to the influx of people. Caravans came and went to Golconda, to Agra, to Delhi, and to Lahore. Ships arrived from the Konkan and Malabar coast; while from the outer world, besides the flourishing European trade, merchants came from Arabia, the Persian Gulf, Ceylon, and Acheen in Sumatra. Silk and cotton cloth formed the chief articles of export. European ships did not complete the lading and unloading of their cargoes at Surat; but having disposed of a part of their goods, and laid in a stock of indigo for the home market, they took on a supply of Guzerat manufactures for the eastern trade, and sailed to Acheen and Bantam, where they exchanged the remainder of their European and Indian merchandise for spices. The Dutch in particular made Surat their principal factory in India, while the French also had a small settlement. Under Aurangzeb, the District suffered from frequent Marhatt\u00e1 raids, which, however, did little to impair its mercantile position. The silting up of the head of the Cambay Gulf, the disturbed state of Northern Guzer\u00e1t, and the destruction of Diu by the Maskat Arabs in 1670, combined to centre the trade of the Province upon Surat. Its position as 'the Gate of Mecca' was further increased in importance by the religious zeal of Aurangzeb. But the rise of the\npredatory Marhatt\u00e1 power put a temporary check to its prosperity. The first considerable Marhatt\u00e1 raid took place in 1664, when Sivaj\u00ed the Great suddenly appeared before Surat, and pillaged the city unopposed for three days. He collected in that short time a booty estimated at one million sterling. Encouraged by this success, the Marhatt\u00e1 leader returned in the year 1669, and once more plundered the town. Thenceforward, for several years a Marhatt\u00e1 raid was almost an annual certainty. The Europeans usually retired to their factories on these occasions, and endeavoured, by conciliating the Marhatt\u00e1s, to save their own interests. Nevertheless, the city probably reached its highest pitch of wealth during this troublous period at the end of the 17th century. It contained a population estimated at 200,000 persons, and its buildings, especially two handsome mosques, were not unworthy of its commercial greatness. In 1695, it is described as 'the prime mart of India,\u2014all nations of the world trading there; no ship trading in the Indian Ocean but what puts into Surat to buy, sell, or load.' But the importance of Surat to the English East India Company declined considerably during the later part of Aurangzeb's reign, partly owing to the growing value of Bombay, and partly to the disorders in the city itself. In 1678, the settlement was reduced to an Agency, though three years later it once more became a Presidency. In 1684, orders were received to transfer the chief seat of the Company's trade to Bombay, a transfer actually effected in 1687. During the greater part of this period, the Dutch were the most successful traders in Surat. From the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the authority of the Delhi court gradually declined, and the Marhatt\u00e1s established themselves in power up to the very walls of Surat. The governors nominally appointed by the Mughals employed themselves chiefly in fighting with the Hindu intruders for the country just beyond the gates. At length, in 1733, Teg Bakht Kh\u00e1n, governor of the city, made himself entirely independent; and for twenty-seven years Surat remained under a native dynasty. For the first thirteen years of this period, Teg Bakht Kh\u00e1n maintained an unbroken control over the city; but after his death in 1746, a time of complete anarchy intervened. The English and Dutch took an active part in the struggles for the succession, sometimes in concert, and sometimes as partisans of the rival competitors. In 1759, internal faction had rendered trade so insecure, that the authorities at Bombay determined to make an attack upon Surat, with the sanction of the Marhatt\u00e1s, now practically masters of Western India. After a slight resistance, the governor capitulated, and the English became supreme in Surat. For forty-one years, the government of the new dependency was practically carried on by the conquerors, but the governors or Naw\u00e1bs still retained a show of independence until 1800. The earlier years of the English rule formed again a flourishing period for Surat, when the\ncity increased in size, owing partly to the security of British protection and partly to the sudden development of a great export trade in raw cotton with China. The population of the city was estimated at 800,000 persons; and though this figure is doubtless excessive, Surat was probably the most populous town in all India. Towards the close of the century, however, the general disorder of all Central and Southern India, and the repeated wars in Europe, combined to weaken its prosperity. Two local events, the storm of 1782 and the famine of 1790, also contributed to drive away trade, the greater part of which now centred itself in Bombay. In 1799, the last nominally independent Naw\u00e1b died, and an arrangement was effected with his brother, by which the government became wholly vested in the British, the new Naw\u00e1b retaining only the title and a considerable pension. The political management of Surat devolved upon an officer who bore at first the title of Lieutenant-Governor, since altered (after certain fluctuations) to that of Agent to the Governor of Bombay. The arrangements of 1800 put the English in possession of Surat and R\u00e1nder; subsequent cessions under the treaties of Bass\u00e9in (1802) and Poona (1817), together with the lapse of the M\u00e1ndvi State in 1839, brought the District into its present shape. The title of Naw\u00e1b became extinct in 1842. Since the introduction of British rule, the District has remained free from external attacks and from internal anarchy, the only considerable breach of the public peace having been occasioned by the Musalm\u00e1n disturbance in 1810. During the Mutiny of 1857, Surat enjoyed unbroken tranquillity, due in great measure to the steadfast loyalty of its leading Muhammadan families.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1851 returned the total number of inhabitants in Surat District at 492,684 persons, or 332 to the square mile. The Census of 1872 showed an increase in twenty-one years of 114,403 persons, or 23\u00b722 per cent. The latter enumeration extended over an area of 1669 square miles, and it disclosed a total population of 607,087 persons, or 382\u00b729 to the square mile. Classified according to sex, there were 304,246 males, and 302,841 females; proportion of males, 50\u00b712 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014males, 117,416; females, 108,606; total, 226,022, or 37\u00b723 per cent. of the whole population: above 12 years\u2014males, 186,830; females, 194,235; total, 381,065, or 62\u00b777 per cent. of the whole population. The religious classification yielded the following results:\u2014Hindus, 541,738, or 89\u00b723 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1ns, 52,157, or 8\u00b759 per cent.; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 12,841, or 2\u00b711 per cent. The District also contained 334 Christians, 1 Jew, 2 S\u00edkhs, 9 members of the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j, and 5 \u2018others.\u2019 The total number of persons belonging to aboriginal tribes amounted to 180,107. The mass of the population, except in the large towns of Surat, Buls\u00e1r, and R\u00e1nder, live in villages scattered over the\nalluvial lowlands. The District contained only 3 towns in 1872 with a population exceeding 5000 souls, namely\u2014Surat (107,149), the headquarters and chief commercial centre; Bulsar (11,313), a seaport on the Auranga river; and Rander (10,280), a considerable municipality with a large trade in cotton, on the Tapti, 2 miles above Surat. Bodhan (3305) is a place of Hindu pilgrimage, with a large temple; Parnera, near Bulsar, has a dismantled fort, long one of the strongest fortresses in the District; Suwali, the seaport of Surat, is a village outside the mouth of the Tapti. An important fair takes place yearly at the hamlet of Unai. The language in ordinary use is Guzerati.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Surat, in spite of the commercial importance of its chief town, still remains an essentially rural District, no less than 334,919 persons, or 55.18 per cent. of the whole population, being wholly or partly supported by agriculture. The cultivated area has largely increased of late years. In 1859-60, the total area under tillage amounted to 431,542 acres; by 1872-73, it had risen to 659,804 acres, showing an increase of 52.89 per cent. Rice forms the staple crop, with an area in 1874-75 of 86,448 acres. It is grown chiefly on the black or red soil in the neighbourhood of ponds. Millet (jodr) holds the second place, with an area of 72,521 acres. It is largely grown in the northern part of the District. Cotton covered 59,234 acres, chiefly in the valley of the Tapti. It can only be raised in rotation with other crops. Kodra and nagli (57,626 acres) form the food of the poorest classes. Sugar-cane flourishes better in Surat than in any other District of Guzerat, and constitutes the favourite crop in garden land. Molasses, manufactured by the cultivators, forms a large item of export to Northern Guzerat and Kathiawar. Bijra and tobacco occupy small areas. The two usual harvests, kharif and rabi, prevail in Surat as in the rest of Guzerat. The most striking feature in the agriculture of the District is the difference between the tillage of the ujli, or fair races, and that of the kila, or dark aboriginal cultivators. The dark races use only the rudest processes; grow little save the coarser kinds of grain, seldom attempting to raise wheat or millet; and have no tools for weeding or cleaning the fields. After sowing their crops, they leave the land, and only return some months later for the harvest. As soon as they have gathered in their crops, they barter the surplus grain for liquor. The fair cultivators, on the other hand, who own the rich alluvial soil of the lowlands, are among the most industrious and intelligent in Western India. Nevertheless, many excellent crops for which the land is well fitted, such as indigo, tobacco, and wheat, are very scantily raised, apparently for no better reason than that their cultivation has long been unusual. Except at the beginning of the season, and during harvest, the small proprietors are generally able, with the help of their families alone, to till their fields without hired labour. Among the sugar-cane\nvillages in the south, however, large numbers of labourers find employment. Small holdings form the rule in Surat; but as a large number of them consist of garden land, they support the proprietors in comparative comfort. The cultivators also earn considerable sums by carting timber and grain from the inland villages to the railway and the seacoast. Almost all the dark races, from their indolence and love of drink, are heavily in debt; but the fair races, though often under obligations to the money-lenders, are usually in comfortable circumstances. Government has instituted a scheme for reclaiming the waste lands overflowed by the tide, on terms highly remunerative to the public; and no less than 51,943 acres have been taken on lease for this purpose. These measures have on the whole met with excellent success. Irrigation is mainly carried on from ponds and reservoirs; but a proposition for an extended system of canals in connection with the river T\u00e1pti is still (1876) under consideration. Wages have fallen of late years, owing to the general depression which followed upon the high prices prevailing during the American Civil War. They are still, however, higher than in many other parts of India. In 1876, a carpenter received 1s. per diem, and an unskilled labourer, 6d. Many of the labouring classes, especially among the dark races, remain practically in a position of serfdom, attached to hereditary masters. They squat on some open plot of their master's ground, and receive as wages nothing but their food and a few articles of clothing. Independent field labourers receive 4\u00bdd. per diem. Prices have fallen since the American War. Food grains ruled as follows in 1876:\u2014Wheat, 24 lbs. for the rupee; jo\u00e1r, 34 lbs.; rice, 20 lbs.; pulse, 24 lbs.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The great famines of 1623, 1717, 1747, 1790, and 1803 affected Surat as they did the remainder of Guzerat. Since the establishment of British rule, however, no famine has occurred sufficiently intense to seriously affect the people of the District. Grain rose to a high figure, and remissions of land revenue became necessary in two or three years, during the earlier part of this century; but since 1839, no remission has been required. Very serious floods on the T\u00e1pti form the most disastrous calamity to which Surat is liable. In 1810 and 1822, the waters inundated a large part of the city. In 1835, the whole city lay under water, and 500 houses were carried away. In 1837, the river rose twice, and broke down a large portion of the city walls. In 1843 and 1849, other destructive inundations took place. The Surat municipality undertook a series of protective works in 1869; and though severe floods have since occurred on four occasions, these works have sufficed to secure the city against the loss of life and property which formerly accompanied every inundation.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014Trade centres chiefly in the towns of Surat and Buls\u00e1r, as well as in the seaport of Bilimora. The\ntotal value of the exports from the seven seaports of the District in 1874 amounted to \u00a3444,642, and that of the imports to \u00a370,505. The exports include grain, pulse, mahu\u00e1 fruit, timber, and bamboos; the imports comprise tobacco, cotton seed, iron, cocoa-nuts, and European goods. In 1874, the shipping of Surat port amounted to 1533 vessels, of an average burden of 18 tons, and that of Buls\u00e1r to 2065 vessels, of the same average tonnage. The total value of the trade of Surat is now (1875) little more than half of its value in 1801. The inland route along the T\u00e1pti has still considerable importance, the number of pack-bullocks being estimated at from 20,000 to 40,000, and the total value of trade at \u00a340,000 per annum. The timber trade between the D\u00e1ng forests and the southern ports and railway stations also maintains its consequence. Among manufactures the spinning and weaving of cotton holds the first place, employing almost the entire female population, both rural and urban, except amongst the aboriginal tribes. Surat city contains two steam factories for spinning and weaving. Silk brocade, and embroidery are also largely manufactured by handlooms. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway runs through the whole District from north to south, a distance of 73\u00bd miles, with 15 stations, of which the chief are Surat, Navs\u00e1ri, Amals\u00e1d, Bilimora, and Buls\u00e1r. The District had 64 lines of road in 1876, extending over a total length of 314 miles. A magnificent iron girder bridge crosses the T\u00e1pti at Surat city. A steam ferry plies between Surat, Gogo, and Bhaunagar.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1827-28, the earliest year for which the accounts remain, the total revenue of the District amounted to \u00a3282,714. In 1874-75, the revenue had risen to \u00a3475,879. The total taxation in the last-named year amounted to \u00a3419,942, or 13s. 10d. per head of the population. Of this sum, the land tax contributed \u00a3224,173. The last land settlement took place in 1873. Separate agreements are made with individual holders, and the rents are fixed according to the intrinsic value of the soil, with liability to revision at the expiry of a 30 years' lease. The District contained, in 1875, 7 civil courts, while 26 officers shared criminal jurisdiction. The police of Surat was in a most disorderly state on the British conquest, and bands of armed thieves committed robberies in the neighbourhood and even in the streets of the city. Before many years, however, these open breaches of the peace had been effectually repressed. In 1874, the total strength of the regular police force was 649 men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a311,057; being at the rate of 1 man to every 2\u00b757 square miles and to every 935 of the population; while the cost was at the rate of \u00a36, 12s. 6d. per square mile, or 4\u00bdd. per head of population. The chief obstacle to the efficiency of the police consists in the ease with which offenders can escape into the Portuguese territory of Daman or\ninto the neighbouring Native States. In the north, bands of Bhils cross\nthe frontier, make depredations on the villagers, and retire with their\nplunder. To guard against these robbers, a system of black-mail still\nprevails in parts. Education makes steady though not rapid progress.\nIn 1873-74, the District contained 253 Government schools, with a total\nroll of 12,414 pupils, of whom 8,374 attended daily on an average. These\nfigures show 1 school for every 3 villages, and 26\u00b76 pupils to every\nthousand of the population under 20 years of age. The expenditure on\neducation amounted to \u00a314,544, of which \u00a33033 was debited to the\nimperial treasury. In 1855, there were no girls' schools; but in 1873-74,\nthere were 25, with an average attendance of 777 pupils. For fiscal\nand administrative purposes the District is subdivided into 8 tahsils.\nThe four municipalities of Surat, Buls\u00e1r, R\u00e1n\u00e9r, and M\u00e1ndvi had an\naggregate revenue in 1874-75 of \u00a323,233.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Surat varies greatly with the\ndistance from the sea. In the neighbourhood of the coast, under the\ninfluence of the sea-breeze, an equable temperature prevails; but from\n8 to 10 miles inland, the breeze ceases to blow. The coast also\npossesses a much lighter rainfall than the interior, the annual average\nranging from 30 inches in Olp\u00e1d to 72 inches in Chikhli. The average\nat Surat city for the ten years 1862-71 amounted to 46\u00b726 inches.\nP\u00e1rdi in the south, and M\u00e1ndvi in the north-east, have a bad reputation\nfor unhealthiness. The temperature of the city for a term of ten years,\n1852-61, ranged as follows:\u2014January, maximum 87\u00b0 F., minimum 60\u00b0;\nMay, maximum 99\u00b0, minimum 80\u00b0. The common endemic diseases\ninclude fever, ague, dysentery, and diarrhoea. In M\u00e1ndvi and the\nD\u00e1ngs, a severe type of malarious fever prevails. The total number of\ndeaths reported in the five years ending 1875 was 78,777, showing an\nannual average of 15,755, or 25\u00b79 per thousand. Of these, no less than\n67 per cent. were assigned to fever. The District contained in 1874-75,\nbesides the civil hospital, 9 charitable dispensaries, all of them\nestablished since 1862. They afforded relief during that year to 55,300\npersons, of whom 938 were in-door patients. The civil hospital,\nestablished in 1823, has a building erected in 1864 at a cost of \u00a37190,\nthrough the liberality of Sir Cowasj\u00ed Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, K.C.S.I. The total\namount expended on public health in 1874-75 was \u00a35359.\n\nSurat.\u2014Municipal city and administrative headquarters of Surat\nDistrict, Bombay, and former seat of a Presidency under the East\nIndia Company. Lat. 21\u00b0 9' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 54' 15\" E.; pop. (1872),\n107,149 persons. Situated on the southern bank of the river T\u00e1pti;\ndistant from the sea 14 miles by water, 10 miles by land. Once the\nchief commercial city of India, and still an important mercantile town,\nthough the greater portion of its export and import trade has long since\ncentred in Bombay.\nPosition and General Aspect.\u2014Surat lies on a bend of the T\u00e1pti, where the river suddenly sweeps westward towards its mouth. In the centre of its river front rises the castle, a mass of irregular fortifications, flanked at each corner by large round towers, and presenting a picturesque appearance when viewed from the water. Planned and built in 1540 by Khud\u00e1wand Kh\u00e1n, a Turkish soldier in the service of the Guzerat kings, it remained a military fortress under the Mughal and the British rule till 1862, when the troops were withdrawn and the buildings utilized as public offices. With the castle as its centre, the city stretches in the arc of a circle for about a mile and a quarter along the river bank. Southward, the public park with its tall trees hides the houses in its rear; while low meadow lands elsewhere fringe the bank, from which the opposite ground rises slightly northward on the right shore, toward the ancient town of R\u00e1nder, now almost a suburb of Surat. Two lines of fortification, the inner and the outer, once enclosed Surat; and though the interior wall has long since all but disappeared, the moat which marks its former course still preserves distinct the city and the suburbs. Within the city proper, the space is on the whole thickly peopled; and the narrow but clean and well-watered streets wind between rows of handsome houses, the residences of high-caste Hindus and wealthy P\u00e1rs\u00eds. The suburbs, on the other hand, lie scattered among wide open spaces, once villa gardens, but now cultivated only as fields. The unmetalled lanes, hollowed many feet deep, form water-courses in the rainy season, and stand thick in dust during the fair weather. The dwellings consist of huts of low-caste Hindus or weavers' cottages. West of the city, the military cantonment lies along the river bank, with its open parade-ground stretching down to the water's edge.\n\nPopulation.\u2014During the 18th century, Surat probably ranked as the most populous city of India. As late as 1797, its inhabitants were estimated at 800,000 persons; and though this calculation is doubtless excessive, the real numbers must have been very high. With the transfer of its trade to Bombay, the numbers rapidly fell off. In 1811, an official report returns the population at 250,000 persons, and in 1816, at 124,406. In 1847, when the fortunes of Surat reached their lowest ebb, the number of inhabitants amounted to only 80,000. Thenceforward the city began to retrieve its position. By 1851, the total had risen to 89,505; and in 1872, it stood once more at 107,149. Of this number, 79,076, or 73\u00b781 per cent., were Hindus; 21,260, or 19\u00b784 per cent., Muhammadans; 6500, or 6\u00b706 per cent., P\u00e1rs\u00eds; and 313, or 0\u00b729 per cent., Christians and 'others.' The P\u00e1rs\u00eds and high-caste Hindus form the wealthy classes; the Musalm\u00e1ns are in depressed circumstances, except the Borahs, many of whom are prosperous traders. Fondness for pleasure and ostentation characterise all classes and\ncreeds in Surat alike. Caste feasts and processions are more common and more costly than elsewhere. Fairs, held a few miles away in the country, attract large crowds of gaily dressed men and children, in bright bullock-carts. The P\u0101rs\u012bs join largely in these entertainments, besides holding their own old-fashioned feasts in their public hall. The Borahs are famous for their hospitality and good living. The extravagant habits engendered by former commercial prosperity have survived the wealth on which they were founded.\n\n**History.**\u2014The annals of Surat city, under native rule, have already been briefly given in the article on Surat District. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Surat ranked as the chief export and import centre of India. After the assumption of the entire government by the British in 1800, prosperity, which had deserted the town towards the close of the last century, for a time reappeared. But the steady transfer of trade to Bombay, combined with the famine of 1813 in northern Guzerat, continued to undermine its commercial importance; and by 1825, the trade had sunk to the export of a little raw cotton to the rising capital of the Presidency. In 1837, two calamities occurred in close succession, which destroyed the greater part of the city, and reduced almost all its inhabitants to a state of poverty. For three days in the month of April, a fire raged through the very heart of Surat, laying 9373 houses in ruins, and extending over nearly 10 miles of thoroughfare, both in the city and the suburbs. No estimate can be given of the total loss to property, but the houses alone represented an approximate value of \u00a3450,000. Towards the close of the rainy season in the same year, the T\u00e1pti rose to the greatest height ever known, flooded almost the whole city, and covered the surrounding country for miles like a sea, entailing a further loss of about \u00a327,000. This second calamity left the people almost helpless. Already, after the fire, many of the most intelligent merchants, both Hindu and P\u0101rs\u012b, no longer bound to home by the ties of an establishment, had deserted Surat for Bombay. In 1838, it remained \u2018but the shadow of what it had been, two-thirds to three-fourths of the city having been annihilated.\u2019 From 1840 onward, however, affairs began to change for the better. Trade improved and increased steadily, till in 1858 its position as the centre of railway operations in Guzerat brought a new influx of wealth and importance. The high prices which ruled during the American War again made Surat a wealthy city. The financial disasters of 1865-66 in Bombay somewhat affected all Western India, but Surat nevertheless preserved the greater part of its wealth. At the present day, though the fall of prices has reduced the value of property, the well-kept streets, public buildings, and large private expenditure stamp the city with an unmistakable air of steady order and prosperity.\n\n**Commerce and Trade-guilds.**\u2014The sea commerce of Surat has de-\nclined from a total estimated value of \u00a31,043,222 in 1801, to \u00a3273,241 in 1874. The principal articles of export are agricultural produce and cotton. Since the opening of the railway, however, a great and growing land traffic has sprung up, which has done much to revive the prosperity of the city. The port of Surat is at Suw\u00e1li, 12 miles west of the city. The railway station of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway is outside the city, surrounded by a rising suburb. The organisation of trade-guilds is highly developed in Surat. The chief of these guilds, composed of the leading bankers and merchants, is called the mah\u00e1j\u00e1n or banker-guild. Its funds, derived from fees on cotton and on bills of exchange, are spent partly on the animal hospitals and partly on the temples of the Vall\u00e1bh\u00e1 Ach\u00e1rya sect. The title and office of Nagarseth, or chief merchant of the city, hereditary in a Sr\u00e1wak or Jain family, has for long been little more than a name. Though including men of different castes and races, each class of craftsmen has its trade-guild or panch\u00e1yat, with a headman or referee in petty trade disputes. They have also a common purse, spending their funds partly in charity and partly in entertainments. A favourite device for raising money is for the men of the craft or trade to agree, on a certain day, to shut all their shops but one. The right to keep open this one shop is then put up to auction, and the amount bid is credited to the guild fund.\n\nChief Buildings.\u2014The English church stands upon the river bank, between the castle and the custom-house, and has seats for about 100 persons. The Portuguese or Roman Catholic chapel occupies a site near the old Dutch factory. The Musalm\u00e1ns have several large mosques, of which four are handsome buildings. The Nav Sayyid S\u00e1hib's mosque stands on the bank of the Gopi Lake, an old dry tank, once reckoned among the finest works in Guzerat. Beside the mosque rise nine tombs, in honour of nine warriors, whose graves were miraculously discovered by a local Muhammadan saint. The Sayyid Idrus mosque, with a minaret which forms one of the most conspicuous buildings in Surat, was built in 1639 by a rich merchant, in honour of an ancestor of the present Shaikh Sayyid Husain Idrus, C.S.I. The Mirz\u00e1 S\u00e1mi mosque and tomb, ornamented with carving and tracery, was built about 1540 by Khud\u00e1wand Kh\u00e1n. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds have two chief fire-temples for their two subdivisions. The principal Hindu shrines perished in the fire of 1837, but have since been rebuilt by pious inhabitants. Gos\u00e1vi Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1's temple, built in 1695, was renewed after the fire at a cost of \u00a310,000. Two shrines of Hanum\u00e1n, the monkey-god, are much respected by the people. The tombs of early European residents form some of the most interesting objects in Surat. Two hospitals provide for the indigent poor; and there is at least one such institution for sick or worn-out animals. The clock-\ntower on the Delhi road, 80 feet in height, was erected in 1871 at the expense of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Barjorji Merw\u00e1n\u00ed Frazer. The High School provides accommodation for 500 boys.\n\n**Municipality.**\u2014The municipal revenue in 1875 amounted to \u00a320,435, and the expenditure to \u00a323,171. The incidence of taxation was at the rate of 3s. 6\u00bdd. per head of population. The municipality has opened a number of excellent roads, well lighted, paved, and watered. It has also constructed works for the protection of the city from floods, and for lessening the risk of fire. Systems of drainage, conservancy, and public markets have also been undertaken. No city in the Presidency, except Bombay, owes so much to its municipality as Surat.\n\n**Surat Agency, The.**\u2014A small group of Native States in Bombay, under the superintendence of the Political Agent, Surat. The group consists of the Sidi (Musalm\u00e1n) Principality of SACHIN, comprising a number of isolated tracts within the British District of Surat; and the estates of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of BANSDA and DHARAMPUR, situated in the hilly tracts between the Districts of Kh\u00e1ndesh, N\u00e1sik, Th\u00e1na (Tanna), and Surat.\n\n**Surg\u00e1na.**\u2014One of the petty Bh\u00edl States in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Bombay.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\n**Surharpur.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; situated in the south-east corner of the District, along both sides of the river Tons. Area, 94,519 acres, of which 48,400 are cultivated, 23,519 cultivable, and 22,600 uncultivable waste. A considerable portion of the area consists of saline us\u00e1r tracts. Pop. (1869), 82,927. Government land revenue, \u00a39817, or at the rate of 3s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivable acre. Of the 233 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 172\u00bd are held under talukd\u00e1ri and 60\u00bd under zamind\u00e1ri tenure. The principal landholders belong to Palw\u00e1r and R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r Kshattriya families, who own 145 of the talukd\u00e1ri villages, the remaining 28 being owned by Muhammadan Sayyids. The chief town, Surharpur, is now a place of small importance, with a population of 1474. It contains the ruins of an old Bhar fortress. Prior to annexation, the pargan\u00e1 contained a colony of 600 Muhammadan weaving families; but the industry has declined under the competition of European piece-goods, and there are now but 300 families of weavers, living in the small towns of Jal\u00e1lpur and N\u00e1kpur.\n\n**Suri (Sooree).**\u2014Chief town and administrative headquarters of B\u00edrbhum District, Bengal; situated about 3 miles south of the Mor river, in lat. 23\u00b0 54' 23\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 34' 14\" E. Pop. (1872), 9001. The town is situated upon the summit and immediate extremity of a gravel ridge. Municipal revenue (1876-77), \u00a3355; rate of taxation, 8\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Sur\u00edr.**\u2014Town in Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces; situated 1 mile east of the Jumna (Jamuna) river, in lat. $27^\\circ 46' 10''$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 45' 45''$ E. Pop. (1872), 5279, chiefly Th\u00e1kurs or R\u00e1jputs, Banias, and Bair\u00e1gis.\n\n**Sur\u00edrpur.**\u2014Village in Meerut (Mirath) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $29^\\circ 1' 45''$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 18' E.$, 28 miles west of Meerut city. Pop. (1872), 5216, consisting of 4849 Hindus and 367 Muhammadans. The Eastern Jumna Canal waters the surrounding lands.\n\n**Surjy\u00e1garh.**\u2014Lofty hill of striking aspect in the north of the Ah\u00edr\u00ed chiefship, Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces. About the year 1700, two chieftains, S\u00e1dhu Varya and M\u00fala Varya, rebelled against King R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, and fortified this hill, from which they plundered the country round. R\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h then granted the tract now known as the Ah\u00edr\u00ed chiefship to his kinsman Kok S\u00e1, who stormed Surjy\u00e1garh and killed the insurgent leaders.\n\n**Surjyanagar.**\u2014Capital of Kashmir State. See Srinagar.\n\n**Surm\u00e1.**\u2014The name given to the main branch of the Bar\u00e1k river in Sylhet District, Assam. On entering Sylhet District from C\u00e1ch\u00e1r, the Bar\u00e1k divides into two branches, which do not re-unite until they have both passed into Maimansinh District, Bengal. The more northerly of these two branches is the Surm\u00e1, which is navigable by steamers and large boats all the year through. The chief places on its banks are Sylhet town, Chhat\u00e1k and Son\u00e1mganj, at which marts the limestone, potatoes, and oranges of the Kh\u00e1si Hills are collected for transmission to Bengal. The name of the Surm\u00e1 valley is sometimes given to the two Districts of Sylhet and C\u00e1ch\u00e1r, to mark them off from the Assam Districts in the Brahmaputra valley. The main channel of the Surm\u00e1 separates Sylhet proper from the plains portion of the old State of J\u00e1ntia, annexed to Sylhet in 1835.\n\n**Sursat\u00ed (Sarsuti).**\u2014River in the Punjab.\u2014See Saraswati.\n\n**Surul.**\u2014Village in B\u00eerbh\u00fbm District, Bengal; situated in the south of the District, about 5 miles north of the Ajai river. Noteworthy as the site of a large and important Commercial Residency, and the centre of the Company's trade in B\u00eerbh\u00fbm. During the latter years of the last century, from \u00a345,000 to \u00a365,000 was annually expended on mercantile investment at Surul. The first Commercial Resident, Mr. Cheap, who exercised magisterial powers, has left behind him the name of 'Cheap, the Magnificent.' He introduced indigo cultivation into the District, improved the manufacture of sugar by means of apparatus brought from Europe, and established a private firm, which still flourishes. When the Company gave up their commercial dealings, the Residency at Surul was abandoned, and the village allowed to fall into decay. The ruins crown the top of a small hill visible for miles.\n\n**Susang.**\u2014Zamindd\u00e1ri or estate in Maimansinh District, Bengal; and\nalso the name of a *pargan\u00e1* in the same District. Area, 451 square miles; land revenue, \u00a32183. Court at Netrakon\u00e1. The *zamind\u00e1r* has the title of Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1; his palace, a large but dilapidated building, is situated at Durg\u00e1pur. Pop. (1872), about 1000.\n\n**S\u00fasumau.**\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh. Lat. 26\u00b0 52' N., long. 80\u00b0 19' E.; pop. (1869), 1479, namely, 1463 Hindus and 16 Muhammadans, residing in 304 mud-built houses. Formerly the residence of Sayyid Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Al\u00ed, whose name it bore\u2014Mub\u00e1r\u00e1kpur. It afterwards fell into decay; and on the expulsion of the Sayyids by Karan Deo, it was reclaimed by Kanchan Sinh of the Janw\u00e1r clan in the time of the Emperor Akbar. Situated on a level tract of ground; appearance pretty; climate healthy; water sweet; soil loam. Scene of a battle between Karan Deo and the Sayyids. Market for the sale of English cloth, bullocks, and vegetables, attended by about 700 persons. Manufacture of shoes, earthenware, and jewellery. Annual value of sales, \u00a31000.\n\n**Susunia.**\u2014Hill in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated due west of Kor\u00e1. It runs due east and west for 2 miles, its height being 1442 feet above sea level. Covered with heavy tree jungle, except on its south face, where it is quarried by the Bardw\u00e1n Stone Company for building-stone.\n\n**Sutalia.**\u2014One of the guaranteed Girasia chiefships under the political superintendence of the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, under the Central India Agency. The chief, Sheodan Sinh, pays, under British guarantee, \u00a3340 to the chief of R\u00e1jgarh, within which State he holds a lease of twelve villages.\n\n**Suthumba.**\u2014One of the petty States in Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay. Estimated pop. (1875), 4000; estimated revenue, \u00a3600, of which \u00a340 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, \u00a346 to B\u00e1ls\u00ednor, and \u00a313 to Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra. The chief, Th\u00e1kur Ujab Sinh, is a Baria Koli.\n\n**S\u00fat\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; situated in the north-west of the District, on the Ganges, at the point where it is usually recognised that the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed branches off. Lat. 24\u00b0 35' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 6' E. This spot has always been the scene of great fluvial changes; and the present village of S\u00fat\u00ed is only in name identical with that which has attained celebrity in history as the scene of a severely contested battle, fought in 1763, between M\u00edr K\u00e1sim, the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, and the British army. In 1856, a large portion of S\u00fat\u00ed was washed away by a flood.\n\n**Sutlej (Satlaj).**\u2014One of the \u2018Five Rivers\u2019 of the Punjab, from which the Province derives its name. Rises among the Him\u00e1layas in Chinese territory, about lat. 30\u00b0 8' N., and long. 81\u00b0 53' E. The interest of the Sutlej is to some extent absorbed in that of the Indus, with which it eventually unites, and which is very fully treated in its alphabetical\nplace. The Sutlej, like the Indus, rises on the slopes of the sacred Kail\u00e1s Mountain, the Elysium, or Siva's Paradise of ancient Sanskrit literature, with peaks estimated at 22,000 feet high. It is said to issue from the M\u00e1\u00f1asarowar (M\u00e1\u00f1asa-Sarovara) Lake, which plays so important a part in Sanskrit cosmogony. According to another account, it issues from another and larger lake called R\u00e1vana-hr\u00e1da, or Rakas-tal, which lies close to M\u00e1\u00f1asarowar on the west. Mr. Trelawny Saunders states that it rises 'in the great lakes named M\u00e1\u00f1asarowar and Rakas-tal.' The truth seems to be that these are twin lakes, united with each other, and the Sutlej issues from the Rakas-tal, although its effluence from the lake is intermittent. (Colonel H. Yule, adopting Captain H. Strachey's account in Jour. Geog. Soc., vol. xxiii., and in Jour. Beng. Soc.)\n\nThe M\u00e1\u00f1asarowar had, according to the Hindu mythology, the honour of being also the source of the Ganges, which, of course, is a mere myth. The Sutlej rises near the source, not only of the Indus, but of the Brahmaputra; and the Kail\u00e1s Mountain is thus ascertained by modern investigations to have a real claim to the position which it holds in Sanskrit tradition as the Meeting-Place of Waters. The Brahmaputra, or rather the Tsan-pu, as it is known in Tibet, flows to the east, the Indus to the west, and the Sutlej to the south-west. Starting at an elevation of 15,200 feet high, the Sutlej first passes across the plain of Goge\u2014a vast alluvial tract apparently formed from deposits which the river and its mountain-feeders have swept down from the Him\u00e1layas. It has scoured a passage across the plain in a channel said to be 4000 feet deep, between precipitous banks of alluvial soil. Near Shipki, the frontier Chinese outpost, the Sutlej turns sharp to the south, and commences its marvellous passage through the Him\u00e1layas. It pierces the southern chain of these great mountains through a gorge with heights of 20,000 feet on either side. At Shipki, its elevation is said to be 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. By the time the river has reached R\u00e1mpur, it has fallen to about 3000 feet, and at Bil\u00e1spur, to a little over 1000 feet.\n\nAfter entering British territory, the details of its course may be sketched as follows. For the first 200 miles, it runs through a wild and almost unpeopled mountain country. Receives the Li or river of Spiti near D\u00e1blang. Thenceforth, the united stream takes a south-westerly direction, through Bashahr and the Simla Hill States, and on entering the British District of Hoshi\u00e1rpur, takes a sudden southward bend round the spurs of the Siw\u00e1lik Hills. Debouching upon the plains near Rupar, it divides Umballa (Amb\u00e1la) District from Hoshi\u00e1rpur, or the Jullundur (Jalandhar) Do\u00e1b from the Sirhind plateau. It next flows almost due west, between Jullundur on the north, and Umballa (Amb\u00e1la), Ludhi\u00e1na, and Firozpur on the south, till it receives the Be\u00e1s (Bi\u00e1s) at the south-western corner\nof Kapurth\u00e1la State (lat. $31^\\circ 11'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 4'$ E.). The united river thenceforward preserves an almost uniform south-westerly direction till its junction with the Indus. Its south-eastern shore is bordered by the Districts of Firozpur and S\u00edrsa, and the sterile Native State of Bah\u00e1walpur; its north-western by the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b, comprising parts of Lahore, Montgomery, and M\u00falt\u00e1n Districts. The whole of its course throughout the plains is fringed by a fertile lowland valley, confined at either side by high banks, which lead to the comparatively barren tablelands above; but the lower portion lies through a much less fruitful tract, partaking largely of the characteristics which mark the desert of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Near Machi\u00e1la, the Sutlej joins the Trimab, and the whole river then bears the name of the Panjnad; and finally falls into the Indus, after a total course of about 900 miles, near Mith\u00e1nkot, at 258 feet above sea level. Like other rivers having their rise in the Him\u00e1layas, the Sutlej attains its greatest volume in June, July, and August. A railway bridge on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Line crosses the Sutlej at Phillour, and another carries across the Indus Valley State Railway near Bah\u00e1walpur. Steamers can ascend the river during the floods as far as Firozpur. The Sutlej has been identified with the Zap\u00e1apos (various reading Zap\u00e1opos) of Ptolemy; the Sydrus, or better reading Hesidrus, of Pliny.\n\nSwar\u00fapganj.\u2014Town, with considerable river traffic, on the Jalangi river, in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. $23^\\circ 25'$ N., long. $88^\\circ 26' 15''$ E. Chief exports\u2014grain, oil-seeds, and molasses.\n\nSw\u00e1t (the Suastos of the Greek geographers; Sanskrit, Suvastu).\u2014River in Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab. Rises beyond the British border on the eastern slopes of the mountains which divide Panjakora from Sw\u00e1t territory; receives the drainage of the entire Sw\u00e1t valley; enters Pesh\u00e1war District north of Michni, and finally joins the K\u00e1bul river at Nisatha. Below the Abaz\u00e1i fort, the Sw\u00e1t divides into several channels, which wind through rich meadows, their banks fringed with willow and poplar, till they ultimately reunite at Ch\u00e1rsada, 3 miles above Nisatha. The Adoz\u00e1i branch of the K\u00e1bul river also joins the Sw\u00e1t at Ch\u00e1rsada. The waters of the Sw\u00e1t are clear and cold; the bed is frequently choked with rocks, and the river at such points presents the appearance of a foaming torrent. Fordable at many places during the cold weather. Inundations rarely occur during the floods, owing to the large number of channels which carry off the surplus water.\n\nSwatch of No Ground.\u2014A great natural depression in the Bay of Bengal, lying off the Gangetic Delta, due south of the rivers Raimangal and Malancha; extends north by east from lat. $21^\\circ$ to $21^\\circ 22'$ N., 5 leagues in breadth, with its northern extremity about 5 leagues from the land and its western edge about 11 or 12 miles eastward of S\u00e1g\u00e1r Sand. The interior of this basin has not yet been sounded; but on its northern\nedge the depth of water is about 13 fathoms, decreasing to 3 fathoms towards the land; the other parts of its circumference show a general depth of 20 to 40 fathoms. 'Its sides are so steep and well defined,' says Mr. J. Fergusson, in a paper on 'Recent Changes in the Delta of the Ganges' (published in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for August 1863), 'that it affords mariners the best possible seamark; the lead suddenly dropping, especially on its western face, from 5 and 10 to 200 and even 300 fathoms, with no ground.' Mr. Fergusson does not consider that the sinking is due to volcanic agency, but attributes it to the action of rotatory tides in the bay. This action is strictly analogous to that of the phenomenon known as the 'bore,' which exists to a greater or less extent in all funnel-shaped tidal estuaries. Two circular tides, formed at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, meet in the bay. The consequence seems to be, says Mr. Fergusson, that they must do one of two things\u2014either they must throw up a bar between them or they must scoop out a depression. The first would be the action of two rivers, the velocity of whose currents was diminished or stopped by contact with the ocean; the latter is the probable action of the tides as they actually exist, and is sufficient to account for the formation of the depression.\n\nSy\u00e1mb\u00e1z\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; situated a few miles south of the Ajai river, in lat. 23\u00b0 35' 10\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 32' 5\" E. Pop. (1872), 19,635, viz. 9578 males and 10,057 females. Municipal income (1876-77), \u00a3198; rate of taxation, 3\u00bdd. per head of population (14,696) within municipal limits. Sy\u00e1mb\u00e1z\u00e1r has an old sar\u00e1i (native inn), dated 1125 A.H.\n\nSy\u00e1mnagar.\u2014River-side village in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, and a station on the Eastern Bengal Railway, 18\u00bd miles from Calcutta. A short distance east of the station are the ruins of an old fort, surrounded by a moat about 4 miles in circumference, built in the last century by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bardw\u00e1n as a refuge from the Marhatt\u00e1s; it now belongs to the Tagore family, Calcutta, and is protected by thick date plantations.\n\nSydadapet.\u2014Town in Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras.\u2014See SAIDAPET.\n\nSylhet (Sr\u00edhatta).\u2014A British District in the Chief Commissionership of Assam, lying between 25\u00b0 12' and 23\u00b0 58' 42\" N. lat., and between 91\u00b0 and 92\u00b0 37' 40\" E. long. It contains an area, according to recent survey, of 5440\u00b2 square miles, and a population, according to the Census of 1872, of 1,719,539 souls. The administrative headquarters are at SYLHET TOWN, on the right bank of the Surm\u00e1 river, in 24\u00b0 53' 22\" N. lat., and 91\u00b0 54' 40\" E. long.\n\nSylhet District is bounded north by the District of the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills; east by C\u00e1char; south by the State of Hill Tipperah\nand the Bengal District of Tipperah; west by the Bengal District of Maimansinh.\n\n**History.**\u2014Sylhet, lying in a remote corner of Bengal, was one of the last conquests made by the Muhammadans. Even at the present day, many special features in the administration mark its character as a frontier District. Since September 1874, it has been annexed to the Chief Commissionership of Assam; but in the ethnological character of its population, as well as in its history, it forms an integral portion of Eastern Bengal. In early times, this tract of country was divided among the following three petty States:\u2014(1) Gor, (2) Laur, and (3) J\u00e1intia. The local tradition of the arrival of Br\u00e1hmans from Bengal in the time of King Adisur would seem to indicate that the inhabitants of these three States were of aboriginal descent, and that Hinduism was introduced among them at a comparatively late period. The subsequent conversion of half the population to Isl\u00e1m points in the same direction. The Muhammadans first invaded the District towards the close of the 14th century, when the Afgh\u00e1n King Sh\u00e1ms-ud-d\u00edn was ruling over Bengal with his capital at the city of Gaur. The invaders were led by a *fak\u00edr* or religious fanatic called Sh\u00e1h Jal\u00e1l, whose miraculous powers are said to have effected more than the swords of his followers in overthrowing the local Hindu dynasty then represented by Gaur Gobind. The secular leader of the Musalm\u00e1ns was Sikandar Gh\u00e1z\u00ed; but his reputation is quite eclipsed by that of Sh\u00e1h Jal\u00e1l, whose tomb in Sylhet town is still a frequented place of pilgrimage. The only portion of Sylhet conquered at this time was the territory of Gor, which was placed under the charge of a Naw\u00e1b. The chief of Laur retained his independence until the reign of the Emperor Akbar, when Bengal passed under the rule of the Mughals. The last Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Laur, also called Gobind, was summoned by Akbar to Delhi, and there became a convert to the faith of Isl\u00e1m. He submitted to undertake the defence of the frontier, but did not pay tribute. His grandson removed his residence to Bani\u00e1chang in the first half of the 18th century. At about the same period a tribute of forty-eight large boats was imposed upon him by Al\u00ed Vard\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, the Naw\u00e1b of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d; and subsequently three-fourths of his estates were assessed. The *samind\u00e1rt* of Bani\u00e1chang has now passed out of the hands of his descendants.\n\nWhen the British obtained possession of the *diw\u00e1n\u00ed* of Bengal in 1765, J\u00e1intia was still independent. Sylhet proper was governed by officers called *amils*, directly subordinate to the Naw\u00e1b of Dacca. The system of administration was modelled after the necessities of a frontier District. The land assessment was light; and colonies of Muhammadan soldiery were posted along the border, who held their villages without payment of revenue on a sort of feudal tenure. During the early years\nof British administration, Sylhet was much neglected. The population was turbulent, means of communication were difficult, and all the arts of civilisation were very backward. Raids on the part of the border tribes and insurrections of the Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants demanded the continual presence of a body of troops, whose existence is still continued in the Regiment of Sylhet Light Infantry. The soil is extremely fertile, and in ordinary years yields abundant crops of rice. But in those early days the channels of trade were not open. A good harvest so depressed prices in the local markets that the cultivators were rendered unable to pay their revenue to Government. On the other hand, disastrous floods were of common occurrence, and in a few days changed plenty into the extremity of famine. A vivid picture of the condition of the country at the end of the 18th century is quoted from the Lives of the Lindsays, as an Appendix to my Statistical Account of Sylhet.\n\nThe territory of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00e1intia was confiscated in 1835, in consequence of his complicity in the forcible seizure of certain British subjects, who were barbarously sacrificed at the shrine of K\u00e1l\u00ed. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, Indra Sinh, was granted a pension of \u00a3600 a year, and he resided peaceably in Sylhet until his death in 1861. The plains portion of his territory, extending from the foot of the hills to the Surm\u00e1 river, was annexed to Sylhet District, while the remainder now constitutes the J\u00e1intia Hills Subdivision of the Kh\u00e1si Hills. Since that date, the District has undergone no historical changes, until it was annexed in 1874 to the Chief Commissionership of Assam. The only troubles of the administration have arisen from the confusion in which the land settlement is involved. The Permanent Settlement of 1793 was in name extended to Sylhet, and the annual revenue was fixed at 1,519,450 k\u00e1h\u00e1ns of kauris, or approximately \u00a332,415. But only about one-third of the total area of the District was then under cultivation, and the remaining two-thirds were expressly excluded from the Settlement. No actual survey, however, was made; and it was soon discovered that the landlords or mirdsd\u00e1rs in the cultivated tract claimed to exercise rights of property over the adjoining jungle. This claim has been persistently opposed by the Government, and has given rise to the historical dispute about the il\u00e1m lands, which began in 1802 and was finally terminated by a decision of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal in 1869. The il\u00e1m lands represent the difference between the total area of the District and that portion assessed by the Permanent Settlement. Hitherto these lands have been settled for short periods and on easy terms with the occupants; but for the future it has been determined to assess them at full rates, and in perpetuity. The land settlement in the J\u00e1intia plains is made with the cultivators themselves for a term of twenty years, and it is not proposed to disturb the old system in that portion of the District.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Sylhet consists of the lower valley of the Surm\u00e1 or Bar\u00e1k river\u2014a rich alluvial tract about 70 miles wide, bounded north and south by high mountains, and opening westwards to the plain of Lower Bengal. The greater part of the District is a uniform level, only broken by clusters of sandy hillocks called tilds, and intersected by a network of rivers and drainage channels. During the rainy season\u2014from June to October\u2014the torrents that pour down from the surrounding hills convert the entire surface into a sea of water, amid which the raised village sites appear as islands, and the only means of communication is by boat. The banks of the rivers, as is the case in all alluvial tracts, are raised by the annual flood deposits to a higher level than that of the surrounding country. The low strip of land lying beneath is every year subject to a protracted inundation, and is usually left to weeds and grass. Farther back, as the surface gradually rises, the soil is under continuous rice cultivation. The village sites are embowered in groves of bamboos, palms, and other trees. The soil is for the most part a blue clay, which turns to black on the borders of the swamps or h\u00e1ors, as they are locally termed.\n\nIn the south of the District, eight low ranges of hills run out into the plain, being spurs of the Tipperah Mountains. The highest is about 1500 feet above sea level. There is also a small detached group, the Ita Hills, in the centre of the District. The tilds or sandy hillocks, which are scattered all over the valley, rise to a height of nearly 80 feet in the neighbourhood of Sylhet town. For the most part they are overgrown with grass jungle, but some have recently been cleared for the cultivation of tea. The river system of Sylhet is constituted by the Barak or Surma, with its many tributaries and offshoots. This river enters the District from Cach\u00e1r, and forthwith bifurcates into two branches. The main branch, or the Surm\u00e1, flows beneath the hills bordering the north of the District; the minor branch, or the Kusi\u00e1ra, runs in a south-westerly direction across the District; and the two again unite on the south-western boundary, to fall into the estuary of the Meghn\u00e1 under the name of the Dhaleswari. Both are navigable by large boats and support a busy traffic. The river steamers pass up the Surm\u00e1 into Cach\u00e1r, and this river also brings down the limestone and other products of the Kh\u00e1si Hills. Two short canals or artificial water-courses have been cut in recent years to facilitate navigation. There are now no embankments in the District to protect the fields against flood, those that formerly existed having been suffered to fall into decay about fifty years ago. It is argued that the land benefits more from the silt deposited during inundations, than it used to do from any artificial interference with the natural lines of drainage.\n\nCoal has been discovered in Sylhet, but the coal-field has not\nyet been examined. The northern hills yield an inexhaustible supply of limestone, but the principal quarries lie within the jurisdiction of the Kh\u00e1si Hills. The most valuable timber is found in the south-east of the District, where a tract covering 273 square miles has been declared as 'Forest Reserves.' Other wild products are lac, beeswax, honey, and a perfume called agar attar prepared from the resinous sap of the pit\u00e1kar\u00e1 tree (Aquilaria agalocha), which is exported as far as Arabia and Turkey. The wild animals comprise elephants, tigers, buffaloes, bison, and several varieties of deer. The rhinoceros has not been seen of late years. Wild elephants are captured in kh\u00e9d\u00e1s or stockades, chiefly in the south-east of the District, for the Government Commissariat Department. The rivers abound in fish, and the drying of fish forms an important industry. Excellent m\u00e1hsir fishing is to be had in the rivers issuing from the northern hills.\n\nPeople.\u2014In 1853, the total population of Sylhet District was estimated at 1,393,050. The regular Census of 1872, the first enumeration that has any pretension to accuracy, disclosed a total of 1,719,539 persons, dwelling in 5589 villages and in 286,594 houses. The area was taken at 5283 square miles, showing an average density of 319 persons to the square mile. The average number of persons in each village is 308, and of persons in each house, 6. Classified according to sex, there are 880,330 males and 839,209 females; proportion of males, 51\u00b72 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 12 years\u2014353,624 boys and 286,443 females; total children, 540,067, or 37\u00b73 per cent. of the population. The total number of persons afflicted with certain infirmities is 4911, or 0\u00b72085 per cent. The returns showing the occupations of the people are not trustworthy, but it may be mentioned that the cultivators number 301,844, or 57 per cent. of the adult male population. The ethnical classification gives the following results:\u2014Europeans, 43, and Eurasiens, 8; non-Indian Asiatics, 5974; aboriginal tribes, 11,515; semi-Hinduized aborigines, 170,881; Hindus divided according to caste, 676,987; Muhammadans, 854,131. The frontier hill tribes are represented by 5715 Manipur\u00eds, 3108 Tipperahs, 2755 Kh\u00e1si\u00e1s, 2505 Kuk\u00eds or Lush\u00e1is, and 1188 H\u00e1jangs. Among Hindus, the higher castes are fairly numerous, as also are the low castes found in the Gangetic delta; and generally speaking, as compared with the rest of Assam, there is a conspicuous absence of the castes predominant in the valley of the Brahmaputra or even in Northern Bengal. The two most numerous castes are the Kaibartta (134,523) and the Chand\u00e1l (117,457). The boating and fishing castes in the aggregate number 54,001; the weaving castes, 86,097. The Br\u00e1hmans number 46,967; the R\u00e1jputs, only 2768; the Khatris or traders from the north-west, 7104; the K\u00e1yasths or clerks, 90,042; the Sunr\u00eds, who are a respected caste in Sylhet, 29,095. Divided according to\nreligion, the population is composed of Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes), 859,234, or 50 per cent.; Musammanadans, 854,131, or 49.7 per cent.; Christians, 159; 'others,' 6015, or 0.3 per cent. The majority of the Hindus belong to the Vaishnav sect, though the Census Report only returns 7997 Vaishnavs. These are perhaps to be regarded as the professed adherents of the Kisari-bhajan sect, identical with the Kartabhadjas of Bengal. There are several frequented places of Hindu pilgrimages in the District, including two temples in the territory of Jaintia where human sacrifices used to be offered up to the beginning of the present century. The Brahma Samaj, or theistic sect of Hindus, has three communities in the District, of which the one established at Sylhet town counts about fifty members. It is said that the Musalmans, in point of social rank, take precedence over the Hindus, but the faith of Islam has now ceased to make converts. Many of the Muhammadans have recently joined the reforming sect of Faraidis, and there may be some Wahabi sympathizers among the well-to-do classes. Out of the total number of 159 Christians, 108 are native converts.\n\nUrban life is entirely undeveloped in Sylhet. Out of 5589 villages enumerated in the Census Report of 1872, as many as 4654 have each less than 500 inhabitants. The only place in the District with a population of more than 5000 is Sylhet Town, which is also the only municipality; pop. (1872), 16,846; municipal revenue (1876-77), including ferry tolls, \u00a31769; rate of taxation proper, 1s. per head. Sylhet town conducts a large trade by water. The following twelve villages, mostly situated on the Surma or Kusira rivers, are also important trading marts:\u2014(1) Chhatak, (2) Sonanganj, (3) Azmeriganj, (4) Balaganj, (5) Habiganj, (6) Nabiganj, (7) Bahadurpur, (8) Karimganj, (9) Shamsherganj, (10) Gobindganj, (11) Mutiganj, (12) Dohalia.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The one staple crop cultivated throughout the District is rice, which yields three harvests in the year\u2014(1) dhus, sown on low-lying lands in March and April, and reaped in July and August; (2) katdri, sown on marshy lands early in July, and reaped in October and November; (3) aman or sail, sown on comparatively high lands in March and April, transplanted in the following months, and reaped in December and January. This last harvest furnishes by far the largest proportion of the food supply. The other crops include\u2014mustard, linseed, and til or sesamum, grown as oil-seeds; chinai, a variety of millet, cultivated chiefly in the west of the District as a substitute for rice; several kinds of pulses, jute, sugar-cane; and cotton, grown in patches amid the jungle by the hill tribes. Out of the total area of the District, 2,386,560 acres or 69 per cent. are returned as cultivated, and an additional 827,520 acres or 23 per cent. as capable of cultivation, leaving\n256,000 acres or 8 per cent. as uncultivable waste. About two-thirds of the total cultivated area are permanently under rice. The out-turn is estimated at from 11 to 17 cwts. of paddy or unhusked rice per acre. It is stated that the produce of the rice-fields has steadily diminished in recent years, owing to the damage caused by floods. Oxen are almost exclusively employed in agriculture, though a few buffaloes imported from Manipur are found in the south of the District. Manure, in the form of oil-cake and cow-dung, is applied only to sugar-cane lands; irrigation is rarely practised, and fields are never allowed to lie fallow for any length of time. The system of land tenure prevailing in Sylhet differs both from that in Bengal, and also from the mausdwar\u00ed of Assam. The greater part of the cultivated land is permanently settled, but the tenants of Government are not wealthy landholders like the zamind\u00e1rs of Bengal, but peasant proprietors locally known as mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs. The strict Sale Law of Bengal has not been enforced against revenue defaulters, and consequently the subdivision of landed property, or rather of the rights in land, has been encouraged to an excessive degree. But on the whole, the cultivators of Sylhet, owing partly to the fertility of the soil, and partly to the moderation of the assessment, occupy a position of comparative comfort. Intermediate tenures between the mir\u00e1sd\u00e1r and the actual cultivator are very rare. Where land is rented out, the rent for rice land varies from 12s. to 1s. 4d. an acre.\n\nBoth blight and flood are more dreaded in Sylhet than drought. Within the memory of the present generation, the winter of 1869-70 has been the only occasion when the rainfall was so deficient as to affect the general harvest. Inundations take place every year over a considerable tract of country; and it is thought that the flood water does more good than harm, by depositing fresh silt on the exhausted fields. There is some local demand for embankments, but their construction is a matter of doubtful advantage. During 1866-67, the year of the Orissa famine, the price of rice rose to 10s. 8d. a cwt. The people mainly depend upon the dman harvest for their food supply; and if that were to fail, the two other rice harvests would be inadequate to supply the deficiency. In ordinary years, Sylhet is able to export large quantities of its surplus grain to Bengal, C\u00e1char, and the Kh\u00e1si Hills.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014Sylhet is celebrated for several special manufactures. The Manipuri women settled in the District weave cotton cloths called Manipuri kesh, also handkerchiefs and mosquito curtains, of fine quality and tastefully embroidered with silk. The Manipuri men are the best carpenters in the country. At the village of Lashkarpur, there is a small colony of Musalm\u00e1ns, who inlay iron weapons with silver and brass scroll-work. But the specialities of Sylhet, known throughout\nIndia, are *sitalp\u0101\u1e6di* mats, ivory and shell carving, *puk\u0101l\u0101* work or lac inlaid with feathers and talc, and pottery. All these industries are pursued with much skill and elegance, and the artisans command large prices for their wares. Local trade is conducted chiefly at permanent markets, situated on the banks of the large rivers. The external commerce of Sylhet, both with Bengal and with the neighbouring Districts of Assam, is very considerable. The Bengal registration returns for 1876-77 show a total export from Sylhet valued at \u00a3597,500, against imports valued at \u00a3490,755. These figures unavoidably include some portion of the trade of the Districts that lie beyond, but at the same time they omit the rice, etc. of Sylhet exported to those Districts.\n\nThe chief items on the export side are\u2014tea, 2,856,480 lbs., valued at \u00a3285,648, evidently including much grown in Cachar; lime and limestone, 1,053,759 maunds, valued at \u00a379,032, almost entirely from the Khasi Hills; rice and paddy, 647,900 maunds, valued at \u00a386,270; vegetables, \u00a336,932; oil-seeds, \u00a322,730; fruits and nuts, \u00a319,351; jute, \u00a38093; mats, \u00a33927. The imports include\u2014European piece-goods, \u00a3144,726; salt, \u00a3112,800; sugar, \u00a329,020; tobacco, \u00a326,800; spices, \u00a322,655. The tea and cotton goods are carried by the river steamers; all the heavy commodities go in country boats. Almost the only means of communication is by water. There are no regular roads outside the limits of Sylhet town. In 1875-76, the aggregate length of the navigable rivers was returned at 800 miles; and of the roads, and those all second class, at only 91 miles.\n\n**Tea Cultivation** occupies a subordinate position in Sylhet, as compared with the neighbouring District of Cachar. The tea-plant was first discovered growing wild in 1856, and the oldest garden now existing dates from the following year. Ever since the season of excessive speculation that reached its crisis in 1865, the business of tea cultivation and manufacture in Sylhet has improved steadily and rapidly year by year. Statistics for 1875, as furnished by twenty-three gardens, show a total area of 26,612 acres taken up for tea, of which 4446 acres were covered by mature plant; the aggregate out-turn was 470,748 lbs., or an average of 111 lbs. per acre under mature plant. In the previous year, the average monthly number of labourers employed was 3109, of whom 462 had been imported under contract from Bengal.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The fiscal and executive administration of the District is vested in a Deputy Commissioner, who must be a member of the covenanted service. The judicial department is entrusted to a Civil and Sessions Judge, whose jurisdiction extends also over Cachar. For purposes of forest conservancy, Sylhet and Cachar form one Division under a Deputy Conservator. For the ordinary work of administration, Sylhet is divided into 4 Subdivisions, but these have not yet been supplied with offices. The District is further divided into 16\nthinds or police circles, and into 186 pargangs or fiscal divisions. In 1875-76, the number of magisterial and revenue courts was 7, and of civil courts 9; there were 5 covenanted civil servants stationed in the District, of whom some were engaged on settlement work.\n\nIn 1870-71, the total revenue of the District amounted to \u00a338,120, against an expenditure of \u00a338,406. The chief items on the revenue side were\u2014land tax, \u00a348,761; stamps, \u00a316,263; excise, \u00a38679. The regular District police force in 1872 consisted of a total strength of 579 officers and men, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a310,573. These figures show 1 policeman to every 9'29 square miles or to every 2969 persons, maintained at a cost of \u00a31, 19s. 3\u00bdd. per square mile and 1\u00bdd. per head of population. In addition, there was a municipal force in Sylhet town, numbering 45 officers and men, and maintained at a cost of \u00a3342; and a body of chaukidars or rural police, numbering 4156 men, supported by doles from the landholders, or by lands held rent free, at a total estimated cost of \u00a39974. In 1872, a total number of 7689 criminal cases were investigated, and 5796 persons were put upon their trial, of whom 2793, or 48\u00b719 per cent., were convicted, being 1 person convicted of an offence of some kind or another to every 615 of the population. The jail statistics for that year show a daily average of 410\u00b733 prisoners, including 6\u00b735 females, being 1 person always in jail to every 4190 of the population. The total cost of the jail amounted to \u00a32008, or an average of \u00a34, 17s. 11\u00bdd. per prisoner. The accounts of the manufacturing department disclose a net loss of \u00a36, 14s. 11d.\n\nUntil within recent years, education had not made much progress in Sylhet. But the introduction of Sir G. Campbell's reforms in 1872, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the pathsalas or village schools, has acted as a great stimulus to primary instruction. In the year 1870-71, there were only 15 schools in the District, attended by 879 pupils. By the close of 1874-75 these numbers had risen to 255 schools and 7025 pupils, showing 1 school to every 21\u00b709 square miles, and 4\u00b705 pupils to every thousand of the population. The total expenditure in 1872-73 amounted to \u00a31370, of which Government contributed \u00a3570. The principal educational institution in the District is the Government English School at Sylhet, which is described as the most successful of its class in Assam. In 1874-75, it was attended by 330 pupils, of whom 86 were Musalmans. To promote Muhammadan education, this school receives an annual grant of \u00a380 from the Mohsin endowment. The Sylhet municipality also supports, at its own cost, two Muhammadan maktab. The Normal School, founded in 1873, was attended in the following year by 21 gurus, whose expenses are entirely defrayed by Government.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sylhet is excessively damp and\ntrying to Europeans. The rainy season generally lasts from April to October, and the remaining months are regarded as constituting the cold weather. The rainfall is very heavy, and has the effect of tempering the heat. In 1870, the maximum temperature recorded was 96\u00b0 F., the minimum 46\u00b0. During the five years ending 1876, the average annual rainfall was 159.26 inches. The earthquake of January 10, 1869, of which the centre of disturbance was at C\u00e1char, was severely felt in Sylhet. The church and other buildings in the town were considerably damaged; and in many parts of the District the surface of the ground was rent into fissures, and the channels of the larger rivers were sensibly altered.\n\nThe chief epidemic disease in Sylhet is malarious fever. Dysentery and diarrhoea are also prevalent, as well as many cutaneous disorders; outbreaks of both cholera and small-pox are common. In 1874, out of the total number of deaths reported to the police, nearly one-half were assigned to cholera. The general returns of vital statistics are absolutely untrustworthy. The registration system in selected areas during 1874 showed a death-rate of 35 per thousand in the urban area, which is coincident with the limits of Sylhet town; and 34.6 per thousand in the rural area. Throughout the District no regard is paid to the most ordinary rules of conservancy; and the sanitary condition even of Sylhet town is most deplorable. Drinking water is obtained from rivers and tanks, rarely from wells. There is but one charitable dispensary in the District, at Sylhet town. In 1874, it was attended by 331 in-door and 3814 out-door patients; the total expenditure was \u00a3117, towards which Government contributed \u00a348.\n\nSylhet.\u2014Chief town of the District of the same name, Assam; situated on the right or north bank of the Surma river, in lat. 24\u00b0 53' 22\" N., and long. 91\u00b0 54' 40\" E. Pop. (1872), 16,846; municipal revenue (1876-77), \u00a31769, including \u00a31056 from ferry tolls; rate of taxation proper, 1s. per head. The area included within municipal limits is 13.18 square miles. The houses of the European residents are scattered along the river bank for a distance of about 2 miles. Besides the usual public offices, there is a handsome church. The native quarter lies behind, overgrown with vegetation, and intersected by open sewers. The river water is commonly used for drinking purposes. In 1874, the total number of deaths registered was 590, of which 144 were assigned to fevers and 119 to cholera; average death-rate, 35 per thousand. The Muhammadans number 8089, or nearly half the total population. The mosque of Sh\u00e1h Jal\u00e1l, a fakir whose miraculous powers contributed greatly to the Musalm\u00e1n conquest of the country, attracts pilgrims from great distances. There is a small colony of native Christians, converted by a Protestant Mission established in 1850. No missionary is now resident. Sylhet town is\nan important centre of river trade, and also of manufacturing industry. The chief exports are rice, cotton, hides, horns, sitalp\u0101\u1e6d\u012b mats, leaf-umbrellas, ornaments, etc.; the imports are cotton goods, salt, hardware, sugar, pulses, spices, silk, etc. The Bengal registration returns for 1876-77 show an export of 16,200 maunds of rice, and 23,700 maunds of paddy; and an import of \u00a362,600 of piece-goods. The principal articles of manufacture are sitalp\u0101\u1e6d\u012b mats, ornaments of carved ivory and shell, mor\u0101s or bamboo stools, and pet\u0101r\u0101s or trunks for clothes made of cane. The Muhammadan festival of the 'Id, at the time of the Muharram, is marked by a fair lasting for two days, when toys, cheap ornaments, and sweetmeats are sold. The site of the town is placed on the land-roll of the District as a revenue-free estate, called Kasb\u0101 Sylhet. The claim to exemption, which has never been formally recognised by Government, is based upon a sanad or grant from a Mughal Emperor, of Delhi. In 1869, Sylhet was visited by a violent shock of earthquake, which did great damage to the church and other buildings.\n\nSynthia.\u2014Town in B\u012brbh\u016bm District, Bengal. Station on the East Indian Railway, 119 miles distant from Howrah, and rapidly rising place; connected with Sur\u012b by a good road.\n\nSyriam (or Than-lyeng).\u2014A Subdivision of Rangoon District, Pegu Division, British Burma. It comprises the Than-lyeng and An-gyi townships, the former of which lies south of the Pegu river, and east of the Hlaing river; the latter extends from the Pan-hlaing river to the sea. Headquarters at Kyouk-tan, which contains a court-house and police station; pop. (1877), 407.\n\nSyriam (or Than-lyeng).\u2014Township in the above Subdivision of Rangoon District, British Burma. Comprises ten revenue circles. Pop. (1877), 56,141; gross revenue, \u00a344,211. Headquarters at Syriam Town.\n\nSyriam (or Than-lyeng).\u2014Old town in Rangoon District, Pegu Division, British Burma; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 42' 30\" N., and long. 96\u00b0 21' 5\" E., on the left bank of the Pegu river, and about 3 miles from its mouth. Pop. (1877), 1733. Burmese traditions allege that Syriam was founded in 587 B.C. by Ze-ya-the-na, and that about fifty years later it was called Than-lyeng, after a usurper who dethroned the son of Ze-ya-the-na. Little or nothing is known of the place from that time until the beginning of the 17th century. Towards the close of the previous century, the King of Arakan, taking advantage of the quarrels between the Kings of Toung-ng\u016b, Ava, and Pegu, and the destruction of the last-named monarchy by the first, obtained possession of Pegu, aided by the Portuguese under Philip de Brito y Nicote, to whom, as a reward, was given the town of Than-lyeng. In a short time the King of Arakan found reason to regret his liberality; but his endeavours\nto drive out the Portuguese were unsuccessful. In 1613, Than-lyeng was besieged and captured by the King of Ava. Nicote was impaled alive, and all the Portuguese whose lives were spared were sent as slaves to the capital, where a few of their descendants exist to this day. In 1631, the Dutch were allowed to establish a factory at Than-lyeng, which they retained till 1677, according to Valentyn; but Dalrymple states that both English and Dutch were expelled some years earlier. The date of the foundation of the English factory is not known. In 1698, however, it was re-established, and Mr. Bowyear placed in charge by the authorities at Madras. In 1740, the Peguans or Talaings expelled the Burmese and captured Than-lyeng, without harming the English or other residents. In 1743, the Burmese retook the town, but held it for three days only, when the Peguans returned, expelled the Burmese, and burnt the English factory to the ground. Nothing now remains of the once flourishing Portuguese, Dutch, and English factories except the substantial ruins of an old church situated outside the old walls, some tombs, and the foundations of a few masonry houses. A full description of the church (built by Monseigneur Nerini, the second Vicar-Apostolic of Ava and Pegu, and a member of the Barnabite Mission) is given in the Life of Monseigneur G. M. Percoto, Missionary to the kingdoms of Ava and Pegu, and Bishop of Massulis. The Barnabite Mission was established in 1722, and continued to flourish till about 1754. In 1756, the Bishop was murdered by the Burmese conqueror Alounghbhura, then besieging Than-lyeng, because he was suspected of complicity with the Peguans. From that year till 1760, the mission remained destitute, and was then removed to Rangoon.\n\nThe Myo-\u00fak or Governor of Than-lyeng during the first Burmese war of 1824-25 was Moung Tsat, whose sister was married to Bhad\u00fan-meng, fourth son of Alounghbhura. After the capture of Rangoon by the British troops, he collected a considerable force, and commenced fortifying Than-lyeng, and erecting works to command the entrance to the river. On the 4th August 1824, a body of about 600 men was sent to dislodge him. The storming party was received with a sharp fire, but the Burmese evacuated the place before the escalade. The British did not retain possession of the town, and it was occupied in December by a portion of the Burmese army which had been investing Rangoon. But on the 11th of February 1825, Than-lyeng was once more occupied by the British. Shortly after the signing of the treaty of Vanda\u00fa (February 1826), the Talaings, under Moung Tsat, made an attempt to regain their ancient kingdom. They were joined by the Karengs; and their leader, the Myo-\u00fak of Than-lyeng, assumed the title of king. The British remained strictly neutral; and after some fighting in and round\nRangoon, a force arrived from Ava, and the Peguans retreated to Than-lyeng, and, in 1827, the leaders escaped to Tenasserim. Since this event, nothing of importance has occurred in the town.\n\nT\n\nTa-da.\u2014River in British Burma.\u2014See Toung-gnyo.\n\nTadi\u00e1ndamol.\u2014Highest peak in the chain of the Western Gh\u00e1ts in the territory of Coorg, 5729 feet above the sea. Lat. 12\u00b0 13' N., long 75\u00b0 40' E. The ascent is not difficult; two-thirds may be achieved on horseback, the remainder on foot. The view from the summit is magnificent.\n\nT\u00e1dpatri (Tadputry, Tiddaparti).\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras, and an important station on the Madras Railway; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 55' 50\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 2' 25\" E., on the right bank of the Penner (Ponniy\u00e1r). Pop. (1871), 8312, living in 1818 houses. Thriving trade in silk, cotton, and indigo. In 1875, the railway carried 43,000 passengers to and from the station, and 5309 tons of goods. The town was founded by R\u00e1malingam Nayudu, one of the Vijayanagar governors, 400 years ago. He also built the fine temple dedicated to R\u00e1ma Iswara. Another temple (dedicated to Chint\u00e1r\u00e1ya) on the river bank was built by Timma Nayudu. These two temples are elaborately decorated with sculptures representing the adventures of Krishna, R\u00e1ma, and other mythological personages. Among the bas-reliefs is a figure holding a Grecian bow. The temple on the river bank is by far the finer, but was never finished. The gop\u00fara of the other temple was struck by lightning about thirty years ago, and split in two. After the battle of T\u00e1l\u00edkot, the country round T\u00e1dpatri was subdued by the forces of the Kutab Sh\u00e1hi dynasty, and a Muhammadan governor was appointed. Afterwards, the town was captured by Mor\u00e1ri R\u00e1o, and still later by Haidar Al\u00ed. The site of T\u00e1dpatri lies low, and part of the town is frequently under water. The main street is narrow and straight, with substantially built houses.\n\nT\u00e1dri.\u2014Port in North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay. Lat. 14\u00b0 31' 30\" N., long. 74\u00b0 24' E.

Pop. (1868), 3152. A place of purely antiquarian interest, the present village being built of bricks taken from an old fortress, 1 mile south. The stronghold once possessed great strength, while its antiquity is vouched for by the size of the bricks, described by General Cunningham as 'similar to the oldest in the walls and ruins of M\u00falt\u00e1n.' Identified with a town of the Malli, conquered by Alexander the Great during his campaign in the Punjab. Said also to have been taken by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed. Tim\u00far plundered the town, and massacred the inhabitants, but left the citadel untouched, because it would have delayed his progress. Abandoned, according to tradition, in consequence of a change of course by the R\u00e1vi, which cut off the water supply about the time of Mahm\u00fad Langa (1510 to 1525 A.D.). General Cunningham describes the ruins as consisting of an open city, protected on the south by a lofty fortress 1000 feet square. The outer rampart of earth has a thickness of 200 feet and a height of 20 feet; and a second rampart of equal elevation stands upon its summit. Both were originally faced with large bricks. The modern village contains a police station and branch post office.\nTalaparamba.\u2014Town in Malabar District, Madras.\u2014See Taliparamba.\n\nT\u00e1l Bahat.\u2014Ancient town in Lalitpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated at the base of a hill, in lat. 25\u00b0 2' 50\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 28' 55\" E., 26 miles north of Lalitpur town. Pop. (1872), 4813. Derives its name from a large tank or lake (t\u00e1l) which supplies water for irrigation to several of the neighbouring villages. It is formed by the natural interposition of the hill, a rocky range 800 feet in height, whose proper outlets have been artificially dammed; and it covers an area of at least a mile square. Extensive masonry battlements crown the hilltop, and enclose a fort now in ruins. Beneath, the town spreads out an orderly array of good brick houses, mostly flat-roofed, and apparently indicating a large population. On a nearer view, however, many of the buildings are seen to be ruinous and vacant, the people having deserted their homes in large numbers, especially during the famine year of 1869, and emigrated to neighbouring Native States. Many trees stand in and out amongst the houses, thus increasing the apparent size of the town. Around the whole lake, and especially along its northern border, runs a green fringe of cultivated fields; but the remainder of the surrounding country, seen from the hill, stretches like a vast undulating jungle, interspersed with occasional conical heights. Much rice grows in a swamp fed from the lake. Small trade in grain and cotton. B\u00e1z\u00e1r; handsome well; old fort demolished by Sir Hugh Rose in 1857.\n\nT\u00e1lcher.\u2014One of the Petty States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 52' 30\" and 21\u00b0 18' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 57' and 85\u00b0 17' 45\" E. long. Area, 399 square miles; number of villages, 242; pop. (1872), 38,021. Bounded on the north by Pal Lah\u00e1ra, on the east by Dhenk\u00e1nal, and on the south and west by Angul. The chief feature in this State is a coal-field, of which a thorough examination was made in 1875. It was then reported that no seam of workable thickness and fairly good quality exists; that a final and thorough exploration could only be effected at a considerable expense; that the local consumption would never suffice to support a proper mining establishment; and that, with the costly long land carriage, no class of coal equal to R\u00e1niganj could compete successfully at the Orissa ports with coal sent from Calcutta by sea. The project for utilizing the T\u00e1lcher coal-beds has therefore been abandoned for the present. Iron and lime are also found near the banks of the Br\u00e1hmani river, which separates T\u00e1lcher on the east from Pal Lah\u00e1ra and Dhenk\u00e1nal. Small quantities of gold are found by washing the sand of the river, but little profit accrues to the workers. The population of 38,021 persons inhabit 7192 houses, and consist of\u201427,351 Hindus and people of Hindu origin, the most numerous castes being Ch\u00e1s\u00e1s, Gours, Br\u00e1hmans,\nand K\u00e1m\u00e1rs; 3940 aborigines, mainly Savars, Gonds, and T\u00e1alas; 6630 semi-Hinduized aborigines, chiefly P\u00e1ns; and 100 Muhammadans. Proportion of males in total population, 51.2 per cent.; average density of population, 95 per square mile; average number of villages per square mile, 0.60; persons per village, 157; houses per square mile, 18; persons per house, 5.3. The only town of any size in the State is T\u00e1lcher, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, situated on the right bank of the Br\u00e1hmani, in lat. 20\u00b0 57' 20\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 16' 11\" E., and containing about 500 houses. Only one village in the State has a population of from 2000 to 3000 souls. T\u00e1lcher is said to have been founded about 500 years ago by a son of an Oudh R\u00e1j\u00e1, who forcibly ejected the savage tribe which had previously inhabited it. The title of Mahendr\u00e1 Bah\u00e1dur was bestowed upon the late chief as a reward for services rendered during the Angul disturbances in 1847. The estimated annual income of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is \u00a34147; the yearly tribute to the British Government, \u00a3103. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's militia consists of 615, and the police force of 267 men. Fifteen schools are scattered through the State.\n\nT\u00e1ldanda.\u2014Canal in Cuttack District, Bengal, connecting Cuttack city with the main branch of the Mah\u00e1nadi river within tidal range. It is intended both for navigation and for irrigation; total length, 52 miles. The lower reaches are not yet finished. The canal, when completed, will end at Sh\u00e1m\u00e1gol on the Mah\u00e1nadi, about 8 miles in a direct line from the sea. It starts from the right flank of the Mah\u00e1nadi weir at Jobr\u00e1, skirts the east side of the city of Cuttack for a mile and half, then turns eastward, and runs midway between the K\u00e1tjur\u00ed and the Mah\u00e1nadi for 4 miles; thence to B\u00edrb\u00e1ti, it keeps nearly parallel with the latter river, at a distance of from half a mile to one mile. At B\u00edrb\u00e1ti, a branch canal is thrown out to M\u00e1chhg\u00e1on, at the mouth of the Devi. The T\u00e1ldand\u00e1 Canal, in its first reach to B\u00edrb\u00e1ti, has a bottom width of 64 feet, with slopes of 2 to 1, and a fall of 6 inches in the mile. With a maximum depth of 8 feet of water, the discharge is calculated at 1460 cubic feet per second, half of which will be carried off by the M\u00e1chhg\u00e1on Canal, leaving 730 feet per second to the lower reaches of the parent canal. The T\u00e1ldand\u00e1 Canal, with its offshoot, the M\u00e1chhg\u00e1on, is designed to irrigate 155,000 acres of the central delta. Many of the distributaries are now completed, the total irrigable area at the end of 1874-75 being 35,500 acres. Its first section is spanned by four bridges.\n\nTaleg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Amr\u00e1oti District, Berar. Lat. 21\u00b0 5' N., long. 78\u00b0 4' E.; pop. (1867), 4198.

Pop. (1872), 5040. Talegaon is a dum\u00e1la town belonging to the D\u00e1bh\u00e1de family, who rose to great importance during the time of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1l\u00e1\u00ed Vishwan\u00e1th, in the person of Khand\u00e1 R\u00e1o D\u00e1bh\u00e1de, the Peshw\u00e1's commander-in-chief in 1716.

Pop. (1872), 6547. Talegaon takes its name from having been a convenient camping-ground (t\u00e1l) in former times. The Dhamdhera family has for long held the foremost place in Talegaon, and has given its name to the town to distinguish it from Talegaon Dabhabra in the M\u00e1wal Subdivision of Poona District *(vide supra).* Post office and dispensary.\n\n**Tale-kaveri.**\u2014River in Coorg.\u2014See Tala-Kaveri.\n\n**T\u00e1lgaon** (or 'Tank Town').\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; situated 12 miles east by north of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town, and 8 miles south of L\u00e1harpur. Derives its name from the numerous jhils or t\u00e1lis in the immediate neighbourhood. Founded by Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1das in the 11th century. Pop. (1869), 2098, chiefly Muhammadans.

Since 1868, no longer the headquarters of the taluk of the same name. Pop. (1871), 2882, almost all Hindus. The origin of Talkad is lost in antiquity. The name is translated into Sanskrit as Dala-vana. The first authentic fact of history is that Hari Varma, a king of the Kongu or Chera line, fixed his capital here in the year 288 A.D. A king of the same dynasty strongly fortified the city in the 6th century. At the close of the 9th century, the Cheras succumbed to the Cholas; but Talkad reappears a hundred years later as the capital of the Hoysala Ball\u00e1la line. Subsequently, it passed into the hands of a feudatory of the Vijayanagar king, from whom it was conquered in 1634 by the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. The last R\u00e1ni of Talkad imprecated a curse upon the city 'that it should become sand,' and threw herself into the K\u00e1veri. At the present day, the buildings of the old city are completely buried beneath hills of sand, stretching nearly a mile in length. These sandhills advance at the rate of about 10 feet a year, and are said to cover about 30 temples, of which the topmost pagodas of two still project above the surface. The temple of Kirti Nar\u00e1yana is occasionally opened, with great labour, sufficiently to allow of access for certain ceremonies.\n\nTallacheri.\u2014Municipal town and seaport in Malabar District, Madras.\u2014See Tellicherry.\n\nTaloda.\u2014Chief town and municipality of the Taloda Subdivision, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 34' N., and long. 74\u00b0 18' 30\" E., 62 miles north-west of Dhulia, and 104 miles west of the Bhus\u00e1wal station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.

Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a32292; of which \u00a391 is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a314 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nTambaur.\u2014Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 in Sit\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Kheri District, and on the east, south, and west by Kundri, Bisw\u00e1n, and L\u00e1harpur parg\u00e1n\u00e1s. Area, 190 square miles, or 121,471 acres, of which 84,305 acres are cultivated and 21,146 cultivable. The country is a complete network of streams, being bounded on the north by the Dah\u00e1war and on the west by the Gogra; while it is intersected by the Chauka, and many smaller rivers. The soil is throughout tar\u00e1i and g\u00e1njar, that is to say, it is so moist as not to require irrigation; and during the rainy season there is scarcely a village but is more or less flooded. In heavy or protracted floods, the autumn crops are\ndestroyed. The Chauka and Dah\u00e1war rivers frequently change their course, and both annually cut away land from the villages through which they pass. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, the pargan\u00e1 is on the whole prosperous, and contains a large proportion of highly skilled agricultural castes, such as Kurmis or Mur\u00e1s. Pop. (1869), 63,421 Hindus and 5868 Muhammadans; total, 69,289. Of the 186 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 80 are t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 43 of which are owned by Gaur Kshattriyas. The remaining villages, 86 in number, are zamin-d\u00e1ri, of which 40 are also held by Gaurs, who thus own one-half the whole number of villages in the pargan\u00e1. The only manufacture carried on is that of saltpetre. One road crosses the pargan\u00e1 from S\u00edt\u00e1pur to Mall\u00e1pur.\n\nTambaur.\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; situated 35 miles north-east of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town, and 6 miles west of Mall\u00e1pur, between the Dah\u00e1war and Chauka rivers. Founded about 700 years ago by Tambulis, whence its name. Pop. (1869), 3014, residing in 520 mud-built houses. Tambaur includes the village of Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d, and now belongs to a Kurmi community. School; bi-weekly market; remains of a Government fort; temple to Siva; masonry tank, now in decay; and a martyr's tomb.\n\nT\u00e1mberacheri.\u2014Pass in Malabar District, Madras.\u2014See TAMRACHERI.\n\nT\u00e1mbraparn\u00ed (Porunai, the \u03a3\u03c9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd of the Greeks).\u2014River in Tinnevelli District, Madras, rising in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, in lat. 8\u00b0 52' N., and long. 77\u00b0 51' E. It runs in a south-easterly direction to Shermadevi, then north-west between Tinnevelli and P\u00e1lamcottah, then again south and east to the sea; total length, 70 miles. With the Chitt\u00e1r and its other feeders, it irrigates 65,000 acres of land; and the District is largely dependent on this supply of water, the distribution of which is regulated by eight anicuts across the bed of the river. The valley is closely cultivated, and supports a dense population. The river is mentioned in the Brihat Samhit\u00e1 (circ. 404 A.D.), and reference to the port (Kolkei) at its mouth is made by Ptolemy and in the Periplus. Near its source rises another and smaller stream of the same name, sometimes called the Western T\u00e1mbraparn\u00ed, which flows westward into Travancore.\n\nTaml\u00fak.\u2014Subdivision of Midnapur District, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 53' 30\" and 22\u00b0 32' 45\" N. lat., and between 87\u00b0 39' 45\" and 88\u00b0 14' E. long. Area, 621 square miles; number of villages, 1522; houses, 72,438. Pop. (1872), 467,817, of whom 424,075, or 90.7 per cent., were Hindus; 43,317, or 9.3 per cent., Muhammadans; 209 Christians; and 216 'others.' Proportion of males in total population, 48.9 per cent.; average density of population, 753 per square mile; average number of villages per square mile, 2.45; persons per village, 307; houses per square mile, 117; inmates per house, 6.5. This Subdivision comprises the 5 police circles of Taml\u00fak, P\u00e1nchkur\u00e1, Mas-\nlandpur, Sut\u00e1h\u00e1t\u00e1, and Nandig\u00e1on. In 1870-71, it contained 1 magisterial and revenue court, a regular police force of 150 men, and a village watch of 1599; the cost of Subdivisional administration was returned at \u00a34523.\n\nTaml\u00fak.\u2014Headquarters of the Subdivision of the same name, Midnapur District, Bengal; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 18' 2\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 58' 10\" E., on the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan river. Pop. (1872), 5849, of whom 3003 were males and 2846 females. The population was made up of 5044 Hindus, 800 Muhammadans, 4 Christians, and 1 'other.' Taml\u00fak is a municipality, with an income (1876-77) of \u00a3319; incidence of taxation, 11\u00bdd. per head.\n\nThe town contains also a police station (th\u00e1nd), and is one of the principal seats of commerce in the District. In ancient times, Taml\u00fak was a famous city, and figures as a kingdom of great antiquity in the sacred writings of the Hindus. It first emerges in authentic history as a Buddhist maritime port, being the place whence the Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hian took ship to Ceylon in the early part of the 5th century. Two hundred and fifty years later, another celebrated pilgrim from China, Hiouen Thsang, speaks of Taml\u00fak as still an important harbour, with ten Buddhist monasteries, a thousand monks, and a pillar by King Asoka, 200 feet high. Even after the overthrow of Buddhism by Hinduism, many wealthy merchants and shipowners resided here, and carried on an extensive over-sea trade. Indigo, mulberry, and silk, the costly products of Bengal and Orissa, form the traditional articles of export from ancient Taml\u00fak; and although the sea has since left it, the place long continued an important maritime town. In 635 A.D., the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang found the city washed by the ocean; the earliest Hindu tradition places the sea 8 miles off, and it is now fully 60 miles distant. The process of land-making at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed has gone on slowly but steadily, and has left Taml\u00fak an inland village on the banks of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan river. The peasants, in digging wells or tanks, come upon sea-shells at a depth of from 10 to 20 feet; and an almost forgotten name of the town, Ratn\u00e1kar or Ratn\u00e1b\u00e1t\u00ed, or the 'Mine of Gems,' alone commemorates its former wealth. Under the rule of the ancient Peacock Dynasty of Taml\u00fak, the royal palace and grounds are said to have covered 8 square miles, fortified by strong walls and deep ditches. No trace of the ancient palace is now discernible, except some ruins to the west of the palace of the present Kaibartta R\u00e1j\u00e1. The present palace is built on the side of the river, surrounded by ditches, and covers the more moderate area of about 30 acres. The old city lies under the river-silt, even the great temple is now partly underground; and the remains of masonry wells and houses are met with at 18 to 21 feet below the surface.\n\nThe principal object of interest at Taml\u00fak is a temple sacred to the goddess Barga-bh\u00edm\u00e1 or K\u00e1l\u00ed, situated on the bank of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan.\nThe honour of its construction is ascribed to various persons. Some say that it was built by Viswakarm\u00e1, the engineer of the gods. It is generally, however, assigned to the King of the Peacock Dynasty mentioned above, although the present royal family of Taml\u00fak assert that the founder of their dynasty, the first Kaibartta R\u00e1j\u00e1, was the builder of the temple. The skill and ingenuity displayed in its construction still attract admiration. The shrine is surrounded by a curious threefold wall. A high foundation, consisting of large logs of wood placed upon the earth in rows, covering the whole area to be occupied by the temple, and afterwards covered over with bricks and stones to a height of 30 feet, was first constructed; and upon this the wall is built. The three folds form one compact wall, the outer and inner being made of brick, the centre one of stone. The wall rises to a height of 60 feet above the lofty foundations, its width at the top of the foundation being 9 feet. The whole is covered with a dome-shaped roof. Stones of enormous size were used in its construction, and raise the spectator's wonder as to how they were lifted into their places. On the top of the temple, although dedicated to the wife of Siva, is the sacred disc (chakra) of Vishnu, surmounted by the form of a peacock. The idol is formed from a single block of stone, with the hands and feet attached to it. The goddess is represented standing on the body of Siva, and has four hands. Outside the temple, but within its enclosure, is a keli-kadamba tree, supposed to have the virtue of redeeming wives from barrenness. Numbers of women flock hither to pray for offspring, suspending pieces of brick to the tree by ropes made of their own hair. The branches of the tree are said to be covered with these curious ropes. The dread of the anger of the goddess is great. The Marhatt\u00e1s, when ravaging Lower Bengal, left Taml\u00fak untouched, and made many valuable offerings to the temple, out of reverence for the goddess. Even the river R\u00fapnar\u00e1yan is said to still its waters as it flows by, while a short distance above and below the shrine the waves are turbulent. The river has on several occasions encroached near the temple, and once reached to within 5 yards of the walls. Although even the priests deserted the edifice from fear that it would be washed away, the stream was only allowed to approach within a certain distance; as often as it passed the line the waters were forced back by the Divine Will, and the temple escaped without injury. There is also a Vishnu-vite temple at Taml\u00fak, which, in shape and construction, resembles that of Barga-bh\u00edm\u00e1. The legends connected with both temples will be found related in my Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. iii. pp. 64, 66, and 67; and in my Orissa, vol. i. 310-312.\n\nTaml\u00fak, or T\u00e1mralipta, as it is called in Sanskrit, although originally a centre of Buddhism, continued to be a place of great sanctity when that religion was ousted by Br\u00e1hmanism. Its very name bears witness\nto its ancient unorthodoxy, but even this has been distorted into a title of honour. Grammarians derive the word from *tamas-lipta*\u2014literally, 'stained with darkness or sin.' But a legend relates that it took its name from the fact that Vishnu, in the form of Kalki, having got very hot in destroying the demons, dropped perspiration at this fortunate spot, which accordingly became stained with the holy sweat of the god, and gave a sanctity and name to the place. A Sanskrit text speaks of it as a holy place in the following words:\u2014\n\n'I will tell you where your sins will be destroyed. There is a great place of pilgrimage in the south of India, an ablution in which saves a man from his sins.'\n\nThe earliest kings of Taml\u00fak belonged to the Peacock Dynasty, and were R\u00e1jputs by caste. The last of this line, Nisankh\u00e1 N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, died childless; and at his death the throne was usurped by a powerful aboriginal chief named K\u00e1l\u00fa Bhuiy\u00e1, the founder of the existing line of Kaibartta or Fisherkings of Taml\u00fak. The Kaibarttas are generally considered to be descendants of the aboriginal Bhuiy\u00e1s, who have embraced Hinduism. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 is the twenty-fifth in descent from K\u00e1l\u00fa Bhuiy\u00e1.\n\n**T\u00e1mracheri (T\u00e1mberacheri).**\u2014Pass in Malabar District, Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 29' 20\" and 11\u00b0 30' 45\" N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 4' 30\" and 76\u00b0 5' 15\" E. long., carrying the road over the Western Gh\u00e1ts from Calicut to the Wain\u00e1d and Mysore (Mais\u00far).

A well-wooded country, traversed throughout for a distance of 40 miles by a beautiful avenue of fine old mango trees, planted many years ago by a native gentleman, with the object of forming a continuous avenue from T\u00e1nda town to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Area, after recent transfers, 124 square miles, of which 73 are cultivated. Pop. (1869), Hindus, 54,843; Muhammadans, 9083; total, 63,926. Number of villages or townships, 215. Cotton-weaving is the principal manufacture, but the industry is decaying. In 1862, there were 1125 looms in the pargan\u00e1, principally in T\u00e1nda town; but owing to the competition of Manchester piece goods, many weavers have left, and the number of looms is now estimated at only 875. Where English thread is used, each loom is capable of turning out about \u00a321 worth of cloth per annum, of which \u00a36, 4s. represents the weaver's profits; where native thread is used, the out-turn is about \u00a317, and the profits, \u00a35. During the later years of native rule, T\u00e1nda annually exported upwards of \u00a312,000 worth of cloth to Nep\u00e1l; but its exports thither have now decreased more than one-half. Five market villages; periodical fairs are also held on the occasion of Hindu and Muhammadan festivals.\n\nT\u00e1nda.\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Oudh, and headquarters of T\u00e1nda tahsil and pargan\u00e1; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 33' N., and long. 82\u00b0 42' 10\" E., 3 miles south of the Gogra river, on the road from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d city to Azamgarh. The road from Sult\u00e1npur to Gorakhpur also passes through T\u00e1nda. The site of the town was granted by the Emperor Farrukh Siyyar to H\u00e1iat Kh\u00e1n, the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r. Celebrated for its woven cotton goods, such as j\u00e1md\u00e1n\u00ed cloth, which are said to rival those of Dacca. They are of the value of from \u00a310 to \u00a315 per piece. The total value of the annual export of cloth is about \u00a315,000. Pop. (1869), Muhammadans, 7613; Hindus, 6815; total, 14,428, residing in 3660 houses.

The ancient capital of Bengal after the decadence of Gaur. Its history is obscure, and the very site of the city has not been accurately determined. It is certain that it was in the immediate neighbourhood of Gaur, and west of that town, beyond the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. Perhaps T\u00e1n-\nd\u00e1n has been utterly swept away by the changes in the course of the Ganges. Neither the Revenue Surveyor nor the modern maps make any mention of the place. According to Stewart (History of Bengal, ed. 1847, p. 95), Sulaim\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h Kar\u00e1n\u00ed, the last but one of the Afgh\u00e1n kings of Bengal, moved the seat of Government to T\u00e1nd\u00e1n in 1564 A.D., eleven years before the final depopulation of Gaur. Though never a populous city, T\u00e1nd\u00e1n was a favourite residence for the Mughal governors of Bengal until the middle of the following century. In 1660, the rebel Suja Sh\u00e1h, when hard pressed by Mir Juml\u00e1, Aurangzeb's general, retreated from R\u00e1jmahal to T\u00e1nd\u00e1n; in the vicinity of which town was fought the decisive battle in which the former was finally routed. After this date, T\u00e1nd\u00e1n is not mentioned in history, and it was subsequently deserted by the Mughal governors in favour of Dacca.\n\nTando Adam.\u2014Town in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind.\u2014See ADAM-JO-TANDO.\n\nTando Alahyar.\u2014T\u00e1luk and town in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind.\u2014See ALAHYAR-JO-TANDO.\n\nTando B\u00e1go.\u2014Subdivision of Tando Deputy Collectorate, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind.

It is connected also by cross roads with Wango Barar, Khairpur, Pangryo, and Badin; and with Nindo Shahr by the postal road. Pop. (1872), 1452, namely, 484 Musalm\u00e1ns and 875 Hindus. M\u00fakk-ti\u00e1rk\u00e1r's court, jail, and police lines, with accommodation for 2 officers and 7 constables. A municipality was established in 1857; income in 1873-74, \u00a3189. Tando B\u00e1go has a Government vernacular school, a post office, a cattle-pound, and a commodious dharm\u00e1sala, the latter being maintained at the expense of the municipality. Several of the T\u00e1lpurs of the Bag\u00e1ni family reside here, the principal man of note being Mir W\u00e1li Muhammad, a lineal descendant of B\u00e1go Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lpur, who founded the town about 140 years ago. A little trade is done in rice and grain, sugar, cloth, oil, tobacco, country liquor and drugs.

Pop. (1872), 1412. It has road communication with Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d by the postal line, and by cross road with Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, H\u00e1ji S\u00e1wan, and R\u00e1j\u00e1 Khan\u00e1n\u00ed. The town is situated in the\nmidst of j\u00e1gtr lands, with no public buildings, except police lines for the accommodation of a few constables. There is an Anglo-veracular school, supported mainly by M\u00edr Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, a Sard\u00e1r of the first class, who resides here with his family. The trade of the town is mainly in grain, dates, sugar, molasses, spices, salt, cloth, metals, oil, tobacco, indigo, country liquor and drugs. There are no manufactures of any consequence. The town was founded about 1819, by M\u00edr Ghul\u00e1m Al\u00ed Manik\u00e1n\u00ed, the father of the present M\u00edr.\n\n**Tando Lukm\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Khairpur State; situated a short distance north of the town of Khairpur on the road to Rohri. Pop. (1872), about 1580. The place is noted not only for its manufacture of ardent spirits, but for carved and coloured woodwork, such as cradles, bedposts, small boxes, and other articles. It is said to have been founded about 1785, by Lukm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lpur.\n\n**Tando Masti Kh\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Khairpur State; situated about 13 miles south of Khairpur town, and 18 miles from R\u00e1nipur.

The town was founded about 1803 by Wadero Masti Kh\u00e1n. Near it, in a southerly direction, are the ruins of Kotesar, supposed to have been once a very populous place. On the western side are the shrines of Sh\u00e1h Jaro P\u00edr Fazl Nango and Shaikh Mak\u00e1i.\n\n**Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n (or Tanda).**\u2014Sub-District of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, lying between 24\u00b0 14' and 25\u00b0 17' N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 19' and 69\u00b0 22' E. long. Area, 3177 square miles; population (1872), 189,931.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The general appearance of this Sub-District is that of a level plain, the monotony of which is but slightly relieved by belts of trees fringing the canal banks. To the east and south are large salt tracts, and on the west, skirting the Indus, b\u00e1b\u00fal forests of considerable extent. There are about 100 canals, Government and samind\u00e1ri. Of these, the G\u00fani is the largest, being 69 miles in length. None of the channels is perennial. They fill as the Indus rises, early in May, and dry up by October. The chief dandhs or marshes are the Barej\u00ed, the Sarabudi, and the Jhalar. Limestone and saltpetre occur in this Sub-District. Venomous snakes abound. Hy\u00e6nas, wolves, foxes, deer, jackals, and hogs are the principal wild animals met with.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Of the total population, returned in 1872 at 189,931 persons, 21,982 are Hindus and 167,949 Muhammadans. Of the former, the Waishia caste is the most numerous; of the latter, Sindis and Baluch\u00eds.\n\n**Crops.**\u2014The staple crops are jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, rice, tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, and hemp, which are sown between March and July, and reaped between February and November; also wheat, barley, vegetables, and\nother garden produce, which are sown on land previously saturated either by canal or rain water. Irrigation is effected by means of the Persian wheel. The highest rate of rent for rice land does not exceed 5 rupees, or 10s. per acre. Bar\u00e1ni or rain land cultivation is assessed at a uniform rate of 8 annas, or 1s. per bigh\u00e1, except in the G\u00fani tl\u00eduk, where the rate is 12 annas, or 1s. 6d. The total area of land held in j\u00e1g\u00edr, or revenue free, amounts to 296,000 acres, and the number of j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs is between 200 and 300.\n\nTrade and Manufactures.\u2014The main exports are agricultural produce, camel cloth, ghi', cotton, and salt. Their approximate annual value is \u00a31000. The imports comprise grain, drugs, metals, oil, silk, skins, sugar, tobacco, etc., and their annual value is roughly estimated at \u00a33000. The value of the transit trade of the Sub-District is approximately stated at \u00a31,000,000 sterling. The manufactures are striped cloths, blankets, camel saddles, gold and silver ornaments, wooden articles, carpets, silk thread, metal goods, sugar, salt, and saltpetre. Five fairs are held in the Sub-District. The aggregate length of roads is 555 miles, of which 131 miles are trunk and postal lines. The number of ferries is 28, and of these 17 are on the G\u00fani Canal.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total imperial revenue of Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n in 1873-74 was \u00a334,128, and the local revenue, \u00a33504. The land tax furnishes the principal item. The Sub-District is administered by a Deputy Collector and Assistants. There is a subordinate civil court at the town of Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n. The police number 157 officers and men. There are 5 municipalities, viz. Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Tando B\u00e1go, Badin, Nindo Shahr, and R\u00e1jo Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n\u00ed. Their aggregate receipts in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a3945. Hospital and dispensary at Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n. There is a jail at the headquarters of every mukhtid\u00e1rk\u00e1r or subordinate magistrate. The number of schools in 1874 was 8, attended by 263 pupils. The average annual rainfall of the Sub-District is stated not to exceed 4 inches. The prevailing disease is fever.\n\nTando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n.\u2014Chief town and headquarters of the Sub-District of the same name in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 7' 30\" N., and long. 67\u00b0 33' 30\" E., on the right bank of the G\u00fani Canal, 21 miles south of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city. Pop. (1872), 3412, including 1703 Muhammadans and 1597 Hindus. As the seat of a Deputy Collector, this town contains a court-house and the usual public buildings. Municipal revenue (1874), \u00a3348. Local trade in rice and other grain, silk, metals, tobacco, dyes, saddle-cloths, matting, cochineal, country liquor and drugs. Transit trade in rice, j\u00f3d\u00ed, bdjra, and tobacco. The manufactures comprise copper and iron ware, earthenware, silk thread, blankets, cotton cloth, shoes, country liquor, and articles of wood. Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n is said to have been\nfounded by M\u00edr Muhammad Kh\u00e1n T\u00e1lpur Sh\u00e1hw\u00e1ni, who died in 1813.\n\nTa-neng-tha-ri (the native form of Tenasserim).\u2014Revenue circle in the Tenasserim township of Mergui District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Pop. (1876-77), 2378; gross revenue, \u00a3530.\n\nTangacheri.\u2014Town in the Cochin taluk of Malabar District, Madras; situated in lat. 8\u00b0 54' N., and long. 76\u00b0 38' 15\" E. Formerly a Dutch settlement. Pharoah (1855) says:\u2014\"It was originally a fort, built on a headland of laterite, jutting into the sea. The length is about 2\u00bd furlongs east and west, and the mean breadth, 1 furlong. Portions of the old walls are still visible, as are also the ruins of an old Portuguese tower and belfry. . . . The inhabitants are mostly Roman Catholics. In judicial matters, the people are subject to the auxiliary court at Cochin; the department of police has its separate superintendent, appointed by the British Government. The customs, port dues, and other revenues, derived from this settlement, are levied by the State of Travancore, an equivalent in money being paid by it for the same.\"\n\nT\u00e1ngan.\u2014River of Northern Bengal. Enters Din\u00e1jpur District from Jalp\u00e1gur, on its extreme northern boundary; and after a southerly course of about 80 miles, passes into Maldah District, where it empties itself into the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 near Muchi\u00e1, a small mart for rice and grain. Its total length is about 120 miles. During the rains, the T\u00e1ngan is navigable throughout its entire course in Din\u00e1jpur; for the remainder of the year, it is open to boats of from 7 to 10 tons burden for about 50 miles. Its chief tributaries are the Lok and the Tul\u00e1i; the banks are for the most part jungly. The T\u00e1ngan brings down a large quantity of silt, and has of late years suffered considerable changes in its course. In 1807, according to Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, this river effected its junction with the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 about 7 miles lower down than at present. Its old bed is still traceable in a southerly direction by Kendu\u00e1. It is stated that the T\u00e1ngan has also apparently altered its course in the neighbourhood of R\u00e1niganj village, where the remains of a stone bridge, which evidently spanned the former channel of the river, are still to be seen on the high embanked road connecting R\u00e1niganj with Gaur. The channel of the T\u00e1ngan is in many places becoming choked by the sand and mud brought down from the hills.\n\nTangancherri.\u2014Town in Malabar District, Madras.\u2014See Tangacheri.\n\nT\u00e1nglu.\u2014One of the principal peaks in the Sing\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1 range, D\u00e1rjsling District, Bengal. Lat. 27\u00b0 1' N., long. 88\u00b0 7' 15\" E. Height, 10,084 feet; on the summit is some extent of undulating land. The Chhot\u00e1 or Little Ranjit river takes its rise under this mountain.\n\nT\u00e1ngr\u00e1.\u2014Town in Maldah District, Bengal.\u2014See Tandan.\n\nTangutur.\u2014Town in Nellore District, Madras. Lat. 15\u00b0 20' 30\" N., long. 80\u00b0 6' 15\" E.; pop. (1871), 7045, inhabiting 1215 houses.\nTanjore (Tanj\u00e1v\u00far).\u2014A British District in the Madras Presidency, lying between $9^\\circ 49'$ and $11^\\circ 25'$ N. lat., and between $78^\\circ 56'$ and $79^\\circ 54'$ E. long. Area, 3654 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1871, 1,973,731. Tanjore forms a portion of the Southern Karnatic. It is bounded on the north by the river Coleroon, which separates it from Trichinopoli and South Arcot Districts; on the east and south-east by the Bay of Bengal; on the south-west by Madura District; and on the west by Madura and Trichinopoli Districts and by the State of Pudukota. The administrative headquarters are at Tanjore City, situated on the south bank of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery).\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Tanjore has a just claim to be considered the garden of Southern India. The vast delta of the K\u00e1veri occupies the flat northern part of the District, which is highly cultivated with rice, dotted over with groves of cocoa-nut trees, and densely populated. This tract is thoroughly irrigated by an intricate network of channels connecting the different branches of the delta. The irrigation works will be described in a later section of this article.\n\nMr. Hickey (The Tanjore Principality, 1874) gives the following description of the physical characteristics of the remainder of the District:\u2014\"South-west of the town of Tanjore, the country is somewhat more elevated, especially about Vallam, where the Collector generally resides; but there is nothing that can be called a hill in the whole District. Along the coast, a belt of sand-drifts and low jungle protect the lands from the sea; but between Point Calimere and Adrampatam, a salt swamp extends over several square miles. No rock is prevalent in Tanjore except laterite, which is abundant in the high ground near the western frontier, and is again met with in the extreme south. Around Vallam are many beautiful specimens of rock-crystal. Along the southern coast a narrow and thin bed of sandstone, containing shells, was lately found running parallel with and about half a mile from the shore, and about 2 yards below the surface. This stone is compact enough to be used for building purposes. Extensive beds of marine shells, consisting of the large pearl oyster and other existing specimens, have been found in many excavations south of Negapatam, at the distance of 3 or 4 miles inland, and covered with several feet of alluvial soil; and in the south coast also are numerous specimens of this kind, of comparatively recent appearance. The delta contains some tracts of rich silt, and the immediate margin of the river is generally covered with a light loam; but for the most part the soil is naturally poor, and it is irrigation alone which makes the District such a scene of fertility. The varieties of soil in the higher ground beyond the delta are red loam, black cotton-soil, sandy light earth, and yellow clay much impregnated with soda, and miserably sterile.\" The coast line of the District extends for a distance of 170 miles; a heavy\nsurf breaks incessantly on the shore, rendering communication with shipping very difficult and dangerous.\n\n**History.**\u2014The modern history of Tanjore commences with its occupation by the Marhatt\u00e1s in 1678 under Venkaji, the brother of Sivaji the Great, and the founder of the line of Tanjore R\u00e1j\u00e1s. The British first came into contact with Tanjore by their expedition in 1749, with a view to the restoration of a deposed R\u00e1ja. The cession of Devikota was promised as the reward of their aid. They failed in this attempt, and a subsequent expedition was bought off. Subsequently, the famous Muhammad Ali, Naw\u00e1b of Arcot, was aided by the Madras Government in enforcing a claim for tribute against the Tanjore dynasty, and the fort fell into the hands of the invaders on the 16th September 1773. In 1775, it was restored to the Tanjore Prince, Tulzuji. Practically, until 1779 the Marhatt\u00e1s held the Tanjore State, first as tributaries of the Mughal Empire, then of the Naw\u00e1b of the Karnatic Payangh\u00e1t, then as independent sovereigns, and lastly, under the English East India Company, as assignees of the Naw\u00e1b's tribute. During the latter end of the last century, Tanjore was in fact a protected State of the British Empire, paying its share of the subsidy for the army, which the latter maintained for the defence of the country. It was ceded to the Company in absolute sovereignty by R\u00e1ja Shara-bhoji, under treaty dated 25th October 1799.\n\nThe territory thus acquired, with the undermentioned three small settlements on the coast, not included therein, constitutes the present District or Collectorate of Tanjore. (1) **Devikota**, a small territory adjoining the fort of that name, then estimated to yield a revenue of \u00a33150. This had been previously acquired by the Company from R\u00e1ja Prat\u00e1p Sinh by treaty in 1749. (2) The Dutch settlement at Negapatam, with the adjoining seaport of Nagore (N\u00e1g\u00far) and the territory known as the Nagore dependency. Negapatam was one of the early settlements of the Portuguese, from whom it was taken by the Dutch in 1660. The Nagore dependency was purchased by the latter, in 1773, from R\u00e1ja Tulzuji; but was immediately afterwards taken possession of by the Naw\u00e1b of the Karnatic Payangh\u00e1t, with the aid of the English, the Naw\u00e1b reimbursing the Dutch the money they had paid for its purchase. It was, however, restored to the R\u00e1ja in 1776, together with the whole of his territory, which had been conquered by the Naw\u00e1b in 1773; and the R\u00e1ja in 1778 granted it to the English. Negapatam was wrested by the English from the Dutch in 1781; and thus, like Devikota, this settlement was already in their possession at the time of the cession of the Tanjore principality. (3) **Tranquebar** settlement, yielding a revenue of \u00a32100, which the Danes acquired from the N\u00e1yak R\u00e1ja of Tanjore in 1620, and which they continued to hold, subject to the payment of an annual *peshkash* or tribute of \u00a3311,\nuntil 1845; when it was purchased from them by the English East India Company.\n\nUnder the treaty of 1799, the East India Company engaged to make over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tanjore one-fifth of the net revenue of the territory which was transferred to them, with a further sum of 1 lakh (one hundred thousand) of Star pagodas, or \u00a335,000. They also permitted him to retain possession of the fort of Tanjore, with a small territory within a radius of half a mile around it, together with certain villages and lands, in different parts of the District. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sharabhoji died in 1832, and was succeeded by his son Sivaji, who died in 1855, without legitimate male issue. Upon this, the R\u00e1j was declared extinct, and the rights and privileges appertaining to it ceased. Liberal provision having been made for the support of all relatives and dependants, the private property of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was left in the possession of the family. Until 1841, there was a Political Resident at Tanjore; but this office was amalgamated in that year with that of the Collector-Magistrate of the District. The headquarters of this last-mentioned officer, however, remained at Negapatam, the seat of the old Dutch settlement, till 1845; when, upon Tranquebar coming into the possession of the East India Company by purchase, they were removed to that place. After the death of the last R\u00e1j\u00e1, when the fort and town of Tanjore became British territory, the headquarters of the Collector, as also the seat of the chief court of civil and criminal judicature, then called the Civil and Sessions Court, were removed to Tanjore.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census of the District was taken in 1822. Since then, six others have been taken, all based on actual enumeration. According to the last Census, that of 1871, the total population of the District was 1,973,731, of whom 953,968 are males and 1,019,763 females; proportion of males in total population, 48\u00b73 per cent. There are 369,984 houses, each containing on an average 5\u00b75 inmates. The average density of the population per square mile is 540\u00b71. In the richly cultivated portions of the delta, the density is, of course, much higher, being as much as 1009 per square mile in the Combaconum (Kumbakonam) taluk. Of the total population in 1871, 706,955 (or 35\u00b78 per cent.) were under the age of 12. The great majority of the inhabitants\u20141,803,787, or 91\u00b74 per cent. of the total population\u2014are Hindus. The Muhammadans number 102,703, or only 5\u00b72 per cent.; whilst 66,409 (or 3\u00b73 per cent.) are Christians, and 239 (or 0\u00b701 per cent.) are Jains. Of the Hindus, the most important castes are Br\u00e1hmans (126,757), Vall\u00e1lars or agriculturists (348,400), and Vanniars or labourers (574,789). There are no traces of distinct aboriginal races; but there are no less than 306,569 Pariahs. S\u00e1t\u00e1nis and Pand\u00e1rams number 49,763. The ethnology of Tanjore differs from that of most other Districts on the east coast of the\npeninsula only in the larger proportion of Br\u00e1hmans in the upper grades of the population. The bulk of the population, as elsewhere in the south, consists of Dravidian Hindus. All traces of the immigration of Aryans from Northern India have been lost in the depths of antiquity. Whether the pure Aryan element is preserved unalloyed in any of the numerous classes now included under the general head 'Hindus' or not, is quite an open question; though there can be no doubt that most of the classes which claim Aryan descent contain a large admixture of Dravidian blood. The Muhammadan population consists chiefly of Labbays or Sonakars, a mixed race sprung from the early colonists from Arabia, to whom the coast-line of Tanjore, as commanding a never-failing trade with Ceylon, held out special attractions. These colonists have in course of time found their way also into the interior, and have everywhere adopted the language of the country. The proportion of persons classed as Arabs, Path\u00e1ns, and Mughals in the last Census returns is hardly one-fifth of the aggregate Muhammadan population of the District; and even these figures are probably excessive. The Eurasian inhabitants of the District are chiefly of Portuguese and Dutch extraction. There is a constant flow of labourers from this District to Ceylon; and to some extent also to Burma, the Straits Settlements, the French West Indies, and R\u00e9union. The emigrants are almost invariably Pariahs and other low-castes. They generally return home with considerable savings out of the wages they earn in the colonies. During the year 1876-77, the number of such emigrants to the Straits Settlements, Guadaloupe, and Cayenne was 3896; to the Mauritius and Bourbon, 426.\n\nTanjore District was the scene of the earliest labours of Protestant missionaries in India. In 1706, the German missionaries Ziegenbalg and Pl\u00fctschau established a Lutheran mission in the Danish Settlement of Tranquebar, under the patronage of King Frederic IV. of Denmark; and in 1841, their establishments were taken over by the Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Mission, which subsequently extended its operations into the District. The mission at Tanjore was founded in 1778 by the Rev. C. F. Schwartz of the Tranquebar Mission, who some time previously had transferred his services to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. The mission establishments at Tanjore were taken over in 1826 by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which subsequently founded mission establishments in several parts of the District. The total number of native Protestants belonging to the various societies (Church of England, Lutheran, and Wesleyan) in the District in 1871, was 10,378; which is larger than in any other District in the Presidency, except Tinnevelli. Roman Catholic Missions in Tanjore date from the first half of the 17th century. Their churches and chapels are scattered over the whole District; but their\nprincipal seats are Negapatam, Velanganni (on the coast, 6 miles south of Negapatam), Tanjore, Vallam, and Combaconum. At Negapatam, the French Jesuits have a college (St. Joseph's) which was founded in 1846. The present total number of native Roman Catholics in the District is 54,884.\n\nSeventeen towns in Tanjore contain 5000 inhabitants and upwards. Of these, the five following are municipalities:\u2014Tanjore City (1871), 52,175; Combaconum (Kumbakonam), 46,295; Mayavaram, 23,233; Negapatam, 48,667; Mannargudi, 17,735. Of all the Madras Districts, Tanjore is the most thickly populated, and contains the smallest proportion of uncultivated land. Before rice was imported from Bengal and Burma, Tanjore was the only source on which Ceylon depended for its supplies of food; and even now the balance of trade is greatly in its favour. There are more than 3000 Hindu temples in the District. Many of the larger ones are splendid structures, and possess extensive endowments in land; the great temple at Tanjore city, declared by Fergusson to be the finest in India, is fully described in the following article. During the annual temple festivals, large fairs are held in different parts of the District. The principal Hindu festivals are held at Combaconum; and here, too, is celebrated the famous Mah\u00e1magham, a festival occurring once in twelve years, to which crowds flock from all parts of the country. The Muhammadan festival called Kandiri, held annually at Nagore, and a Roman Catholic festival (Nativity of the Virgin), celebrated every year in September at Velanganni near Negapatam, are also worthy of notice.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is the staple crop of the District, and is raised almost entirely by artificial irrigation. It is grown chiefly in the delta of the K\u00e1veri; and to a much smaller extent in the upland portion of the District, under tanks fed by the local rainfall. The rice grown in Tanjore consists chiefly of two species, viz. k\u00e1r and pish\u00e1nam, each including minor varieties. A few coarser sorts are sown broadcast; but this mode of cultivation is very limited, being carried on only in a few places beyond the delta, and there on rain-fed land. In all cases of irrigated cultivation, young plants are raised in seed-beds and transplanted. The k\u00e1r is planted in June, and reaped in October. The pishanam is planted in July and August, and reaped in January and February. Dry crops are cultivated to a small extent in this District. They are chiefly (1) varagu (Panicum miliaceum), (2) kelvaragu or r\u00e1gi (Eleusine coracana), (3) kambu (Pencillaria spicata), and (4) keviru or d\u00e1l (Cajanus indicus). Varagu and d\u00e1l are grown chiefly at the western end of the upland portion of the District. These crops are sown in July, and cut in February. R\u00e1gi and kambu are cultivated in small patches both in and beyond the delta. In the delta, these crops are raised either on high lands which are not irrigable, or as an\nauxiliary crop on rice-fields. In the latter case, they are sown either before or after rice. They are three months in the ground, being generally sown in June, and cut in September.\n\nGreen crops are common in Tanjore, and are grown chiefly in backyards of houses and on river margins. The green crops generally raised are onions, radishes, sweet-potatoes, and the various kinds of greens, of which those most prized are coriander and fenugreek. The only fibres cultivated in the District are two kinds of so-called Indian hemp (Crotalaria juncea and Hibiscus cannabinus), which are grown to a very limited extent on high lands. A very small quantity of cotton is also grown. Plantain and betel-vine gardens abound in the delta, where sugar-cane and tobacco are also cultivated. Tobacco is generally restricted to backyards of houses and margins of rivers. The only part where it is grown to any considerable extent is the sandy tract at the south-eastern end of the District near Point Calimere, where it is a remunerative crop and a principal article of trade. The tobacco consists of broad thick leaves, and is prized for its strength and pungency. It is used only for chewing, and is chiefly exported to the Straits Settlements and Travancore. Cocoa-nut palms and mango trees are abundant all over the District, except in the south-west, where, owing to the dryness and the laterite soil, few trees flourish.\n\nOf the total area of Tanjore District\u2014in the local records put at 2,393,034 acres\u2014about 53 per cent., or 1,264,965 acres, are actually under the plough: 21 per cent., or 497,025 acres, are cultivable, but not cultivated (including land left fallow); and 26 per cent., or 631,044 acres, are uncultivable, or reserved for purposes other than agricultural. Of the cultivated area, 1,193,404 acres, or more than 90 per cent., are under food grains; and of these, 888,315 acres are irrigated rice lands. In the four deltaic taluks of Combaconum, Mayavaram, Shiyali, and Nannilam, there is a considerably larger proportion, both of land actually cultivated and of land devoted to food grains. The prevailing system of revenue administration in Tanjore is rayatwari. The general average of the Government assessment for the District is\u2014for irrigated lands, 9s. 9d. per acre; for unirrigated lands, 2s. 6d. per acre. The average net profit per acre of the rayatwari holder is estimated at 19s. 3d. for irrigated lands, and 4s. 11d. for unirrigated lands. Wages of agricultural labour are invariably paid in grain. The ordinary rates are \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a marakhil, or 3\u00b787 lbs., of paddy (giving about 2\u00bd lbs. of clean rice) per diem for a trained labourer, male or female, and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) marakhil for inferior adult labourers; boys and girls receive half these rates. In towns, wages are paid in money; the ordinary daily rate for an adult male being 4\u00bdd., for an adult female 2\u00bdd., and for children 1\u00bdd. each. Skilled labourers, such as bricklayers, stone-masons, carpenters, and smiths, are paid, according to the nature of the work and the\ndegree of skill required, from 7\u00bdd. to 1s. a day. The money wages in all cases above mentioned are now generally twice as high as they were twenty-five years ago, and in some cases the increase is still greater. Prices of all articles of food have risen during this period in about the same ratio. The village sales of paddy, the staple produce of the District, on which the original commutation rate for the assessment of irrigated land was calculated, show that the average price of the Tanjore kalam, equal to 12 marakh\u00e1ls or 62 lbs., has varied from 10\u00bdd. in 1850-51 to 2s. 10\u00bdd. in 1875-76. Landless labourers constitute about one-half of the adult male population of the District, and of these nearly two-thirds are engaged in agriculture. They are chiefly Pallars and Pariahs, who are permanently attached to farms. The remainder are low-caste S\u00fadras, who have immigrated from time to time from the Maravar country, lying between the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) delta and Cape Comorin. They go by the general name of Terkat-tiy\u00e1ns or 'southerners.'\n\nIn the delta, the alluvium deposited by the river freshes, as a rule, constitutes the only manure. In the upland portion of the District, as also in those lands in the delta which are irrigated from the tail-ends of channels, and therefore lack this element of fertility, manure is required and used. The mode of manuring generally adopted is by folding sheep or cattle; the latter being more generally employed. Vegetable mould, cow-dung, ashes and other refuse of cook-rooms, and night-soil, are also used. On the whole, the average cost incurred for manuring may be put down as from 2s. to 3s. an acre.\n\nIrrigation.\u2014The great natural advantages of irrigation which Tanjore possesses had been more or less improved upon many centuries before the District became British territory. The Coleroon, which forms the northern boundary of Tanjore, is, from its low level, utilized but to a small extent. The main branch of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) enters Tanjore District about 8 miles east of Trichinopoli, and spreading out into innumerable small channels, which form a vast network extending down to the sea, converts the northern portion of the District, commonly known as the K\u00e1veri delta, into one huge rice-field. Near the western limit of Tanjore, the two main streams come into close contact with each other; and at this point, where the bed of the Coleroon is 9 or 10 feet lower, stands (across a natural outlet of the K\u00e1veri channel) the ancient native work, a masonry dam, known as 'The Grand Anicut,' which prevents the waters of the K\u00e1veri branch being wholly drawn off into the Coleroon. This work, which has been justly called the 'bulwark of the fertility of Tanjore,' is traditionally believed to have been constructed by a king of the Chola dynasty in the 3rd century A.D. There are grounds for conjecturing that it dates not later than the 12th century. It originally\nconsisted of a solid mass of rough stone, 1080 feet in length, 40 to 60 in breadth, and 15 to 18 in depth, stretching across the whole width of the outlet in a serpentine form; and in the year 1830, it was provided by Capt. Caldwell of the Engineers with under-sluices, to allow of the escape of sand. In the early part of this century, however, it was discovered that the Coleroon branch, from its more rapid fall and more direct course to the sea, was drawing off an unduly large share of water; while the K\u00e1veri branch was deteriorating by the formation of deposits at its head. This defect was removed by the construction across the Coleroon branch, in 1836, of a masonry dam known as the 'Upper Anicut,' which has associated the name of Sir Arthur Cotton, of the Madras Engineers, with the agricultural prosperity of Tanjore. This work was followed by the construction of a regulating dam across the K\u00e1veri branch in 1845, to counteract the effects of the Coleroon anicut, which, it was found, was throwing into the K\u00e1veri branch a body of water far larger than could be allowed to enter it with safety to Tanjore. The Coleroon dam, 750 yards long, is divided by two small islands in its bed into three parts, of which the one at the northern end is 7 feet 4 inches, and the other two parts 5 feet 4 inches high. Its thickness throughout is 6 feet, and it is provided with sluices for the escape of sand. The K\u00e1veri regulating dam, 650 yards in length, is divided into three portions, of which the central has its crown on a level with the river bed; while the one on either side is raised from 12 to 18 inches above it. By these two works, the body of water which enters Tanjore District has been brought under complete control. Almost simultaneously with the Coleroon dam, was carried out, as supplementary to it, another work on the Coleroon, about 70 miles lower down, known as the Lower Anicut. The obstruction of a large portion of the water which the Coleroon was drawing off would, as a necessary consequence, have lowered its surface level, thereby depriving of their irrigation the lands which depended on it in the District of South Arcot; the primary object, therefore, of the Lower Anicut was to ensure irrigation to these lands. But advantage was taken at the same time to provide a supply of water from the Coleroon for the north-eastern portion of Tanjore, which was either beyond the influence, or was indifferently supplied by the tail-ends, of the K\u00e1veri channels. Accordingly, the spot where an island divides the Coleroon into two branches was selected. A dam, with suitable vents for the passage of boats as well as the escape of sand, was constructed across each branch; and a channel was taken off from each, one for South Arcot, under the designation of North Rajan v\u0101yakh\u0101l, and the other for Tanjore, called South Rajan v\u0101yakh\u0101l. While, however, the main source has been thus regulated and brought under control, the plan of internal distribution, in connection with this vast\ndeltaic system of irrigation, has not yet been perfected. During the period of more than thirty years which has elapsed since the system of head-works was completed, considerable improvements have doubtless been effected in the way of providing regulating dams at the bifurcation of the several main branches of the K\u00e1veri, as well as head-slui ces for minor channels, and calingulahs or waste weirs for surplus vents; but much remains to be done towards a complete utilization of the available supply of water, as well as the perfection of drainage arrangements in their detail. The aggregate area irrigated in Tanjore District from all sources is about 900,000 acres, of which about 800,000 acres are irrigated from river channels, and about 100,000 acres from tanks. Cultivation under tanks, which are almost wholly rain-fed, is restricted to the upland portion of the District; there being neither space to spare for reservoirs, nor ordinarily any need for them in the delta, where the river channels keep flowing during the whole of the cultivating season. The total land revenue of the District, including miscellaneous items and jodi or quit-rent on in\u00e1ms (lands held on revenue-free tenure) for the year 1875-76, was \u00a3443,350, of which \u00a3396,325 was obtained more or less directly from irrigation. These figures include every item, and also the deductions for the remuneration of village establishments.\n\nTanjore is more than ordinarily favoured by nature with regard to immunity from the calamities alike of flood and drought. The high ridges of sand which skirt its coast-line form an effective protection against ordinary storm waves; while the level of the country, which slopes towards the east, ensures the free drainage of the surplus water of the K\u00e1veri as well as of local rainfall, which is rarely very heavy.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014With the means of communication, this District is amply provided. It is traversed by two branches of the South Indian Railway; the one from Trichinopoli crossing the District to Negapatam on the coast, and the other (Madras branch) branching off from this line at Tanjore city and running in a north-easterly direction. The former carried during the year 1875, 1,477,120 passengers and 129,537 tons of goods; and realized \u00a382,592. Including the cross lines of internal communication, but excluding the innumerable village tracks, the District contains 70 roads aggregating nearly 1200 miles in length, most of which are provided with substantial masonry bridges over the rivers by which they are intersected, as well as culverts for smaller channels. There is but one navigation canal in use, running 32 miles along the coast from Negapatam to Vedaranyam in the south. It is used almost exclusively for the carriage of salt, which is produced in abundance at Vedaranyam. The manufactures for which Tanjore District is celebrated, are metal wares, silk cloths, carpets,\nand pith-work. The chief articles of import are cotton piece-goods, twist and yarn, and metals from Europe, and timber and betel-nuts from the Straits Settlements and Ceylon. Rice is by far the most important article of export, alike by sea and land. By sea, it is exported almost wholly to Ceylon; inland, to Trichinopoli, Madura, and Salem. The total value of the imports by sea in 1876-77 was \u00a3549,130, in which piece-goods accounted for \u00a375,674, railway stores for \u00a3100,089, and betel-nuts for \u00a384,232. During the same year, the exports by sea amounted in value to \u00a3724,905, the grain and pulse alone being valued at \u00a3514,259. The rate of interest generally charged in small transactions, where jewels or other valuable articles are given in pawn as security, is from 6 to 12 per cent. per annum; in all other cases, it varies from 12 to 24 per cent. In large transactions, money is rarely lent otherwise than upon the security of landed or house property, and the rate of interest varies from 6 to 12 per cent.; the maximum being demanded, however, only in rare cases.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Tanjore District, as constituted at its last rearrangement in 1860, is administered by a Magistrate-Collector, a Sub-Collector, 2 Assistant Collectors, and 2 uncovenanted Deputy Collectors, with the ordinary medical, fiscal, and constabulary establishments. The District is divided into 9 taluks, over each of which is a tahsildar, assisted by one or more Deputies; and these 9 taluks are formed into 5 divisions, each under the charge of the Sub-Collector or one of the Assistant or Deputy Collectors\u2014the Collector himself having no direct executive charge, but exercising a general supervision. For judicial purposes, the District is divided into North and South Tanjore. The judicial establishment of North Tanjore for civil causes consists of 6 munisifs and 1 Sub-Judge, all subject to the controlling authority of the North Tanjore District Judge, who is also Sessions Judge on the criminal side, hearing all criminal cases not triable by the Magistracy (with or without a jury, according to the nature of the case), and all appeals from the highest class of Magistrates. Similarly, in South Tanjore, there are 7 munisifs and 2 Sub-Judges, subject to the South Tanjore District Judge. The total District revenue in 1875-76 was \u00a3730,645, equal to an average of 7s. 4d. per head on a population of 1,973,731. In 1875, the regular police force amounted to 1355 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a319,653. These figures show 1 policeman to every 2'7 square miles of area and every 1470 inhabitants; the cost of maintenance was at the rate of \u00a35, 7s. per square mile, or 2\u00bdd. per head of population. There are two jails in the District, one at Tanjore city, the other at Tranquebar. The former had in 1875 a daily average of 170 prisoners; 613 prisoners were admitted during the year, of whom 42 were females; the average cost per head was \u00a37, 4s. 11\u00bdd.; and the average earnings of each inmate\nemployed on manufactures was \u00a31, 8s. In the Tranquebar jail, there was in the same year a daily average of 138 prisoners; 542 prisoners were admitted during the year, of whom 60 were females; the average cost per head was \u00a39, 5s. 5\u00bdd., and the average earnings of each inmate employed on manufactures was 16s. There are about 700 chatrams or native charity-houses in the District; in some of these, food is distributed gratuitously to all travellers. The educational machinery consists of 3 colleges and 605 schools of various grades. The three colleges are the Government Provincial College at Combaconum, the S. P. G. Collegiate School at Tanjore city, and St. Joseph's Jesuit College at Negapatam; 6 of the schools are of the higher class, and affiliated to colleges; 61 (including 3 girls' schools) are middle and lower class Government schools, 66 (including 14 girls' schools) belong to missionary societies, and 472 are private village and town schools.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainfall, as elsewhere on the Coromandel coast, varies considerably from year to year. The south-west monsoon sets in in June, and continues more or less till September; but the rain falls at only long intervals, and but rarely for two hours continuously. The total fall during this monsoon averages 15 inches. The north-east monsoon sets in in October or November, and continues more or less till January. The rains during this part of the year are more continuous and, on the whole, more copious, averaging 23 inches. These averages are taken for the last ten years. The mean annual rainfall observed at 10 stations in the District for four years was 47.14 inches, with an average of sixty-four rainy days in the year. The District enjoys some rain in nearly every month. But it is heaviest from August to December inclusive, and lightest in March. In the last three months of the year, the average fall is about 25 inches. The hottest season of the year is from March to May. After this period, the freshes in the rivers, and the occasional showers of the south-west monsoon, tend to keep the atmosphere to some extent cool. The mean annual temperature for 1875 was 81.9\u00b0 F., varying from a maximum of 103.9\u00b0 in May to a minimum of 64.2\u00b0 in January. Storms and cyclones are of frequent occurrence on the coast; but Palk's Bay, which bounds the District on the south, affords protection to the shipping during bad weather. None of the diseases prevalent in this District can be regarded as endemic. Formerly, elephantiasis was commonly met with in the city of Tanjore, whence it latterly extended to Combaconum. It existed also at Negapatam on the coast, but with improved sanitation it has now to a considerable extent disappeared. The diseases most common are fevers, small-pox, and cholera, all more or less epidemic. Cholera was particularly fatal in 1854 and 1875; it commences generally about the close of the north-east mon-\nsoon in January, and continues throughout the following hot season. There are 15 dispensaries in the District. Of these, five situated in the five municipalities, one at Tranquebar, and three connected with chatrams, afford relief to both in-door and out-door patients; the remaining six are for out-patients only.\n\n**Tanjore (Tanjavur).**\u2014City in Tanjore District, Madras; situated in lat. 10\u00b0 47' 0\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 10' 24\" E.; pop. (1871), 52,175, inhabiting 11,551 houses. Tanjore was the last capital of the ancient Hindu dynasty of the Cholas, and was subsequently ruled by a Nayak governor from Vijayanagar. Between 1656 and 1675, it fell into the hands of the Marhatt\u00e1s; under whose rule it became the capital of a compact and prosperous State. In 1758, it was attacked by the French under Lally, who extorted large sums from the reigning Marhatt\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1. Colonel Joseph Smith captured the fort in 1773; and again, in 1776, it was occupied by an English garrison. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sharabhoji, by a treaty in 1779, ceded the dependent territory to the British, retaining only the capital and a small tract of country around, which also at last lapsed to the Government in 1855, on the death of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sivaji, son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sharabhoji, without legitimate male issue.\n\nTanjore is the headquarters of the Collector, the Judge, and the other departments of District administration. The municipal income averages \u00a34200 a year; rate of taxation, 7\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nAs the capital of one of the greatest of the ancient Hindu dynasties of Southern India, and in all ages one of the chief political, literary, and religious centres of the south, the city of Tanjore is full of interesting associations. Its monuments of Hindu art and early civilisation are of the first importance. The great temple is known throughout the world. Fergusson, in his *History of Indian and Eastern Architecture* (1876), says of it: 'The great pagoda was commenced on a well-defined and stately plan, which was persevered in till completion. . . . It consists of two courts, one a square of about 250 feet, originally devoted to minor shrines and residences; but when the temple was fortified by the French in 1777, it was converted into an arsenal, and has not been reappropriated to sacred purposes. The temple itself stands in a courtyard extremely well proportioned to receive it, being about 500 feet long by half that in width, the distance between the gateway and the temple being broken by the shrine of the bull Nandi, which is sufficiently important for its purpose, but not so much so as to interfere with the effect of the great vimana, which stands near the inner end of the court. The perpendicular part of its base measures 82 feet square, and is two storeys in height, of simple outline, but sufficiently relieved by niches and pilasters. Above this the pyramid rises in thirteen storeys to the summit, which is crowned by a dome said to consist of a single stone, and reaching a height of 190 feet.\nThe porch in front is kept low, and the tower dominates over the gopuras and surrounding objects in a manner that imparts great dignity to the whole composition.\n\nBesides the great temple and the Nandi porch, there are several other smaller shrines in the enclosure, one of which, dedicated to Subramanya, a son of Siva, is as exquisite a piece of decorative architecture as is to be found in the south of India, and though small, almost divides our admiration with the temple itself. It is built behind an older shrine, which may be coeval with the great temple as originally designed. A peculiarity of the temple is that all the sculptures on the gopuras belong to the religion of Vishnu, while everything in the courtyard is dedicated to the worship of Siva. At first I felt inclined to think it had been erected wholly in honour of the first-named divinity, but am now more disposed to the belief that it is only an instance of the extreme tolerance that prevailed at the age at which it was erected, before these religions became antagonistic. Its date is unknown. Mr. Norman, a competent authority, in the text accompanying Tripe's photographs, says it was erected by Kadu Vettiya Soran, or Cholan, a king reigning at Conjeveram in the beginning of the 14th century. The Subramanya is certainly one century, probably two centuries, more modern. The bull itself is also inferior in design, and therefore more modern than those at Halebid, which belong probably to the 13th century, and the architecture of the shrine cannot be carried back beyond the 15th century. It may even be considerably more modern.'\n\nThe fort, which is now almost dismantled, covers a large area. Within it is the chief part of the native town, and the palace, which is still occupied by the family of the last R\u00e1j\u00e1. There are some fine halls in the palace, which also contains the large and valuable library that belonged to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, with some unique manuscripts catalogued by Dr. Burnell of the Madras Civil Service.\n\nTanjore is famous for its artistic manufactures, including silk carpets, jewellery, r\u00e9pouss\u00e9 work, copper wares, and curious models in pith and other materials. The South Indian Railway connects Tanjore with Negapatam (its seaport) on the east, and Trichinopoli on the west. In the year 1875, the railway station received or despatched 346,307 passengers and 23,717 tons of goods, and earned a revenue of \u00a319,157.\n\nTank.\u2014Takhil, and formerly a semi-independent State, in Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab; till lately under the partial management of a Naw\u00e1b. Lies between 32\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 25' N. lat., and between 70\u00b0 7' and 70\u00b0 41' E. long.; occupying the north-western corner of the District, at the foot of the Sulaim\u00e1n Hills. Area, 485 square miles; pop. (1868), 30,849 persons, or 63 per square mile; number of villages, 109. The principality of Tank consists of a naturally dry and\nuninviting plain, intersected at right angles to its length by ravines sloping in the direction of the Indus. By assiduous cultivation, however, it has acquired an aspect of prosperity and greenness which distinguish it strongly from the neighbouring tahsil of Kol\u00e1chi. Low ranges of stony hills here and there project into the plain from the Sulaim\u00e1n system. The country long lay uninhabited, there being little to tempt any settlers in so barren a tract; but it was finally occupied by Path\u00e1n tribes from the western hills. The Naw\u00e1bs of T\u00e1nk belong to the Kati Khel section of the Daulat Khel clan, the most powerful of the original settlers, who gradually expelled all the rest. The present Naw\u00e1b, Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, is said to be 20th in descent from Daulat Kh\u00e1n, eponym of the tribe. His family first assumed the tribal headship in the person of Kat\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, great-grandfather of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z. His son, Sarwar Kh\u00e1n, a most remarkable man, devoted himself throughout a long reign to the amelioration of his territory and his tribesmen. Under his sway, the Daulat Khel changed from a pastoral to a cultivating people; and they still revere his memory, making his acts and laws the standard of excellence in government. Sarwar Kh\u00e1n towards the end of his life found it necessary to tender his submission to the S\u00edkhs, after their occupation of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n; and his tribute was fixed at \u00a3300 per annum. Three years later, Ranj\u00edt Sinh visited the Deraj\u00e1t in person, and raised the tribute to \u00a36000. Sarwar Kh\u00e1n paid the stipulated sum as long as he lived; but his son and successor, Alad\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, permitted it to fall into arrears, and finally fled to the hills, where he found a refuge among the Waz\u00edr\u00ed Path\u00e1ns. T\u00e1nk was then given in jdgtr to N\u00e1o Nihal Sinh; but Alad\u00e1d kept up such a constant guerilla warfare from the hills that the S\u00edkh grantee at last threw up his possession in disgust. M\u00e1lik Fateh Kh\u00e1n Tiw\u00e1na then for a time seized on the State, and after his final defeat by Daulat R\u00e1i (see Der\u00e1 Ismail Khan District and Tiwana), it was made over to three dependants of the Naw\u00e1bs of Der\u00e1; Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, the son of Alad\u00e1d (who had died meanwhile) being left a beggar. In 1846, however, the exiled prince accidentally attached himself to Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, who procured his appointment by the Lahore darb\u00e1r to the governorship of T\u00e1nk. After the annexation of the Punjab, the British Government confirmed him in that post, and he thenceforward enjoyed a semi-independent position, holding a portion of the revenues, and entrusted with the entire internal administration, as well as with the protection of the border. The results, however, proved unsatisfactory, both as regards the peace of the frontier and the conduct of the administration. A scheme was accordingly introduced for remodelling the relations of the State. The Naw\u00e1b's income was increased, but he was deprived of all sovereign powers, retaining only those of an honorary magistrate.\nTank has thus become an ordinary tahsil of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, under the charge of the local authorities.\n\nTank.\u2014Town in Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab, and headquarters of the tahsil; formerly capital of a semi-independent principality. Situated in lat. $32^\\circ 14'$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 25'$ E., on the left bank of a ravine issuing from the Tank Z\u00e1ru Pass, 42 miles north-west of Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n town. Pop. (1868), 2800. Founded by Kat\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, first Naw\u00e1b of Tank. Mud wall surrounds the town, 12 feet in height, and 7 feet thick, with numerous towers and 2 or 3 gates, but in bad repair. Fort, now in ruins, an enormous pile of mud about 250 yards square; walls, faced with brick, enclose a citadel 40 feet high. Fifteen mosques, court-house, Naw\u00e1b's offices and residence, dispensary, and school-house. Water said to be impure, and dangerous for strangers. Considerable trade in iron between the Waz\u00edris and the people of Tank, when good terms subsist between them. Sir Henry Durand, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, lost his life at this town in 1870, being thrown from his elephant by the howdah striking against the top of a gateway. He was buried at Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n.\n\nTank\u00e1ri.\u2014Port in Broach District, Bombay, in lat. $21^\\circ 59' 45''$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 42' 30''$ E.; situated on the east side of a small creek, which for about 5 miles strikes northwards from the right bank of the Dh\u00e1dhar, about 7 miles from the mouth of that river. This creek is not navigable, even by small country craft, except at high tide; but notwithstanding, Tank\u00e1ri was formerly the port for a considerable tract of country, receiving the opium of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 as well as the cotton and grain of Jambusar and Amod. Trade has to a large extent left Tank\u00e1ri, since the opening of the B. B. and C. I. Railway; the returns for 1874-75 still show, however, a total value of exports amounting to \u00a3135,790, and of imports \u00a328,098.\n\nTanna.\u2014District and town, Bombay.\u2014See Thana.\n\nTanna.\u2014An old fort on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, opposite Fort Al\u00edgarh in Garden Reach, a suburb of Calcutta.

Thornton gives the following notice of the place:\u2014'In the year 1782, the British army, under the command of Colonel Humberstone, acting against the forces of Haidar \u00c1l\u00edf, took refuge here from a storm of five days' continuance, which dispersed the boats, spoiled the provisions, and damaged the ammunition of the expedition. It was formerly a prosperous place, but is now much decayed. Distance from Calicut, south-east, 22 miles; Mangalore, 170; Bombay, 546.'\nTapasi.\u2014A coal-mine in the Raniganj coal-field, Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. The colliery was first opened in 1848; but the shaft then worked being destroyed by fire in 1863, another was opened in that year. Out-turn of coal in 1866, 206,154 maunds; thickness of seam, 24 feet. An analysis of Tapasi coal gave the following results:\u2014Fixed carbon, 49\u00b020 to 53\u00b075 per cent.; volatile matter, 31\u00b050 to 35\u00b040 per cent.; ash, 8\u00b050 to 14\u00b075 per cent.\n\nTappa.\u2014Petty State in Central India, under the political superintendence of the Bhop\u00e1l Agency; consisting of 12 villages in the Gwalior pargan\u00e1 of Sonkach, which were granted in 1822 by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 D\u00e1olat R\u00e1o Sindhia to Th\u00e1kur R\u00fap Sinh, Girasia of Tappa.
