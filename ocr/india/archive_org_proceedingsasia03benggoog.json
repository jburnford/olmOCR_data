F. R. Hoernle, Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\n\nSurgeon-Major-General A. F. Bradshaw, A. A. Caspersz, Esq., Babu \u00c7\u0101rat Candra D\u0101s, C. L. Griesbach, Esq., Babu \u00c7\u0101rat Candra L\u0101hiri, Kum\u0101r R\u0101me\u00e7var M\u0101li\u00e0, J. Mann, Esq., L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., Pandit Harapras\u0101d \u00c7\u0101stri, C. R. Wilson, Esq., J. G. Woodroffe, Esq.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThirty-one presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\u2014\n\nS. R. Elson, Esq.\nLieutenant W. A. Harrison.\nDr. Kenneth Macleod.\n\nMr. C. L. Griesbach exhibited some antique beads and stones.\n\nNote on the above by Mr. J. H. Skrine.\n\nAt Sabour, 5 miles east of Bhagulpur, in an alluvial soil 12 miles from nearest rock formations, are found immense quantities of beads and stones. The time is June, when the rains burst. The soil is thus covered with them and the roads, too, have their quota. The natives\nhave no tradition as to their history. Sabour is 2 miles south of the present bed of the Ganges, and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) mile from the old bed (one in use within living memory.)\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Buddhism in Bengal, after the Muhammadan Conquest.\u2014By Pandit Haraprasad \u010c\u0101stel, M.A.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. Note on some remarkable remains in Kashmir.\u2014By Mrs. H. G. M. Murray-Aynsley. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\nEarly in November 1894, shortly before quitting Kashmir after this our fourth visit, I was attracted to the remains of certain old buildings about a mile distant from the European quarter of Srinagar. On closer examination, one of these proved to have formerly been a Muhammadan Zi\u0101rat.* Its walls, up to the height of 10 feet, consisted of very large carefully hewn stones apparently laid without mortar. The roof is entirely fallen in. Judging from the dimensions of the beams of wood lying about in the interior, the whole of the upper part of this building must have been of that material. Amongst this debris are one or two tombstones in situ, and fragments of others are scattered about. Three or four yards distant from, and parallel with the Zi\u0101rat, are the remains of another building of the same character. In this case, the existing stone walls are not more than 4 or 5 feet in height. The whole enclosure is however, much larger than the first named. It contains more than one native dwelling place, the occupants of which appeared to belong to a class superior to that of the ordinary cultivator. These people, on being questioned said, that once upon a time a Mosque stood on this latter site.\n\nDirectly in front of the Zi\u0101rat, and placed in a sloping position against a rough wall which possibly originally formed its outer enclosure, is a singular stone which one may venture to say could never have belonged to either of the above-named buildings. At first sight, this stone appeared to be circular, but on accurate measurement, it proved to be (allowing for a portion which has been broken off) four feet in diameter one way, and four feet four inches the other. The thickness of this slab is about 10 inches, the under or back side is very roughly hewn, but its upper surface has been very carefully smoothed. All round it, at a distance of one inch and a half from the edge, is a\n\n* A walled enclosure, in which is the tomb of some saint, is thus styled.\ndistinct trench three inches and a half in width. Within this area, scattered over the surface, are numerous depressions (so called cup-markings), more or less carefully made, and similar to those hollowed stones which if found in Brittany, in the Island of Guernsey, in Cornwall, Scotland or Ireland, would be styled pre-historic cup-markings. Four of these depressions are of considerable size, being at least three inches in diameter and two inches in depth, and remarkably well defined. There are also several smaller cup-marks, some not so deep or so distinct as the others. The natives on the spot, say that this stone is old, old, centuries old; that it has never been used for any purpose by either themselves or their progenitors, so far as their traditions carry them; though they appeared to regard it with a kind of veneration as an object whose use and origin was unknown to them. Indeed its character and general appearance would seem to point to an earlier stage of civilization than any remains we have ever yet seen in Kashmir.\n\nSome interesting and most curious relics of a past age in Kashmir, belonging probably to some of the earlier civilized races inhabiting that country, have recently been discovered in a valley between two spurs of a mountain rising up from the East end of the Dal or city lake, and situated four or five miles from Sirinagar.\n\nThese remains have not as yet been properly excavated or examined by experts, and it is therefore impossible at present to give any complete description of them. Suffice it to say, that what has already been uncovered consists of a portion of a circular pavement composed of unglazed terra cotta tiles of large size. This pavement has been described as being about 20 feet in diameter, each tile having a raised design of some animal or animals upon it. I was favoured with a sight of the only two tiles which had been brought into Sirinagar, and herewith enclose faithful copies (original size) of the designs upon them, executed by a friend who is a clever draughtswoman. The material is rough, and the execution rude, but the attitude of the two game cocks is remarkably spirited. I would venture to call attention to the resemblance which the flower between these two birds (repeated also on other portions of the design), bears to the flower of the Camp\u0101 or Campak tree, so common in Southern India, but unknown in the Panjab and in Kashmir. Cock-fighting is still a favorite amusement with the Kashmiris. I need hardly add that I should be much gratified and interested by being the recipient of any decision which your Society may arrive at respecting these objects.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last:\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBombay.

A. Elliott, K. C. S. I.,\nVice-President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\nDr. A. W. Alcock, T. D. Beighton, Esq., B\u0101bu \u010carat Candra D\u0101s,\nD. Ernst, Esq., G. A. Grierson, Esq., C. L. Griesbach, Esq., Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, A. Hogg, Esq., The Rev. Fr. E. Lafont, B\u0101bu \u010carat Candra Lahiri, C. Little, Esq., E. D. Maclagan, Esq., J. Mann, Esq., C. R. Marriott, Esq., Dr. F. P. Maynard, W. H. Miles, Esq., L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., A. Pedler, Esq., Dr. G. Ranking, Pandit Harapras\u0101d \u010c\u0101stri, Dr. G. Watt, C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nVisitors:\u2014B\u0101bu J\u00f1\u0101nendran\u0101th P\u0101l Caudhuri, E. Dubois, Esq.,\nB\u0101bu Dinan\u0101th G\u0101nguli, T. Kawakami, Esq., The Rev. K. S. Macdonald.\n\nAccording to the Bye-Laws of the Society, the Chairman ordered the Voting papers to be distributed for the election of Officers and Members of Council for 1895, and appointed Dr. George Watt and B\u0101bu \u010carat Candra D\u0101s to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe Chairman then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1894.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year:\u2014\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review 14 Ordinary Members were elected, 18 withdrew, 10 died, two being Life Members; 4 were removed from the list under Rule 40, being more than 3 years absent from India. There was thus a net loss of 13 Ordinary Members during the year. The total number of Members at the close of 1894, being 295, against 308 at the preceding year; of these 98 were Resident, 125 Non-Resident, 12 Foreign, 22 Life, 36 Absent from India, and 2 Special non-Subscribing Members, as will be seen from the following table, which also shows the fluctuation in the numbers of the Ordinary Members during the past six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |\n| 1889 | ... | 108 | 135 | 18 | 256 | 22 | 27 | 2 | 51 | 307 |\n| 1890 | ... | 105 | 140 | 10 | 255 | 21 | 25 | 2 | 48 | 303 |\n| 1891 | ... | 101 | 134 | 10 | 245 | 21 | 27 | 2 | 50 | 295 |\n| 1892 | ... | 115 | 127 | 11 | 253 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 310 |\n| 1893 | ... | 116 | 123 | 12 | 251 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 306 |\n| 1894 | ... | 98 | 125 | 18 | 235 | 22 | 36 | 2 | 60 | 296 |\n\nThe ten Ordinary Members, the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Babu Ji\u00e4nendra Kum\u00e4r R\u0101ya Caudhuri, Prince Iskandar \u2018Ali Mirz\u0101, General Robert Maclagan (Life Member), Babu Y\u0101dul\u0101la Mallika, B\u0101bu Bhudeva Mukerjee, Mr. W. M. Osmond, The Hon. Ayodhy\u0101n\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit (Life Member), Mr. John Parry Sootland, Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Kavir\u0101ja \u010cy\u0101mal\u0101d\u0101s, and Kum\u0101r Indra Candra Singh.\n\nThere were five deaths amongst the Honorary Members, viz., Mr. B. H. Hodgson, Professor H. Milne-Edwards, Dr. Warner Siemens, Dr. Aloys Sprenger, and Professor William Dwight Whitney. To fill these vacancies and others previously existing, the Society, on the recommendation of the Council, elected as Honorary Members, Sir William Henry Flower, Dr. Edward Frankland, Monsieur Louis Pasteur, Sir George Gabriel Stokes, Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Candrakanta Tark\u0101l\u0101\u1e45k\u0101ra, Professor Theodor Noeldke, and Dr. Reinhold Rost. Thus the number of Honorary Members stands at 22.\nThe lists of Special Honorary Members, Corresponding Members, and Associate Members, continue unaltered from last year, there having been no casualties. Their numbers stand at 5, 6, and 10, respectively.\n\nDuring the year two Members, Mr. E. D. Maclagan and Surgeon-Captain W. Vost, compounded for their future subscriptions; but as two Life-Members, General R. Maclagan and the Hon'ble Ayodhya Nath Pandit died, the total number of Life-Members remains the same as it was at the close of 1893.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nNo Presentations were made over to the Indian Museum.\n\nThe Trustees on behalf of the Society were:\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nO. Little, Esq.\nDr. Mahendralal Sarkar.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe Accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1, in the Appendix, under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society and of different funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1894 was taken at the following figures:\u2014Receipts, Rs. 17,576-0-0; Expenditure, Rs. 16,993-0-0.\n\nThe actual results were found to be:\u2014Receipts, Rs. 17,442-12-0; Expenditure, Rs. 17,875-14-4.\n\nThe Receipts thus show a decrease of Rs. 133-4-0, while the Expenditure shows an increase of Rs. 882-14-4 on the Budget Estimate.\n\nThe increase in Receipts is under the heads of \"Interest on Investments\" and \"Rent of Rooms.\" \"Interest on Investments\" was estimated at Rs. 5,456; the actuals have been Rs. 6,307-10-6. The increase of Rs. 851-10-6 has arisen from the transfer of the Government Promissory Notes, from the 4 per cent. to the 3\u00bd per cent. loan, the Government having paid in advance the excess interest of \u00bd per cent. Owing to the payment in this year of two months' rent due last year by the Photographic Society of India, \"Rent of Rooms\" shows an increase of Rs. 120.\n\nThe loss of Members during the past year being somewhat larger than usual, the receipts from \"Subscriptions\" are below the estimated amount by Rs. 431-14-0. Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., not having submitted their accounts, there appears a reduction of\nRs. 153-10-6 under the head of \"Sale of Publications.\" The difference between the estimated and actual receipts, under the head of \"Government Allowances,\" is due to the grant from the Government of Madras for Part III of the Society's Journal, dealing with Anthropology, Ethnology, and Folklore, not having been received during the year.\n\nOn the Expenditure side, the items of \"Binding,\" \"Journal, Part I,\" \"Journal, Part II,\" and \"Proceedings,\" show an increase. The heavy increase in the \"binding\" is due to a third set of the Society's \"Asiatic Researches,\" \"Journals,\" and \"Proceedings\" having been bound for the Society's Library, and to the binding of some old works. The budget grant for \"Journal, Part I,\" has been exceeded by Rs. 408-4-6; this is owing to the payment for the printing of the maps illustrating Major Raverty's article on the \"Mihran of Sind and its Tributaries.\" The expenditure on \"Journal, Part II,\" shows an increase of Rs. 1,141-8-9, caused chiefly by the payment of \u00a368-11 for plates, to Messrs. West, Newman & Co. Owing to the Baptist Mission Press having been paid for the printing of eleven numbers of the \"Proceedings\" instead of ten, as usual, there is a slight increase of Rs. 253-8-6 under this head.\n\nAn Expenditure of only Rs. 807-4-8 appears under the head of \"Books,\" in consequence of the non-receipt of Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Co's accounts, the books purchased through the London Agents amounting to \u00a367-13-10.\n\nThere were two extraordinary items of expenditure during 1894, under the heads of \"Repairs\" and \"Furniture,\" not provided for in the Budget. Rs. 1,761-6-0 was spent in cleaning and renovating the oil paintings belonging to the Society and in repairing the cane matting. Four almirahs were removed from the stock-room to the Library, and the necessary repairs cost Rs. 199.\n\nThe actual expenditure on the \"Journal\" and \"Proceedings\" was as follows:\n\n|                | Rs. As. P. |\n|----------------|------------|\n| **Journal**    |            |\n| Part I.        | ... 2,508 4 6 |\n| Part II.       | ... 3,241 8 9 |\n| Part III.      | ... 1,426 5 9 |\n| **Proceedings**| ... 1,253 8 6 |\n| **Total**      | ... 8,429 11 6 |\n\nThis is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 270-5-6. Only one number of the Journal, Part III, was issued for 1894.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of probable ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1895 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts, Rs. 16,844; Expenditure, Rs. 16,013.\nOn the Receipts' side, the estimate, under the head of \"Subscriptions,\" has been reduced by Rs. 400, taking into account the unusual loss of Members during last year. \"Interest on Investments\" shows a reduction of Rs. 332, owing to the transfer of the Government Promissory Notes from the four per cent. to the 3\u00bd per cent. loan. The amount of Rs. 500 not having been received during the year from the Government of Madras, the item under the head of \"Government Allowances\" has not been altered.\n\nOn the Expenditure side, the items of \"Lighting,\" \"Freight,\" and \"Local Periodicals\" have been slightly decreased. \"Stationery\" has been decreased by Rs. 50, the compilation of the Society's Library Catalogue being far advanced.

Croft,\nVice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University,\nand Director of Public Instruction, Bengal.\n\nCalcutta, the 30th January 1895.\n\nThe Chairman announced that the Scrutineers reported the result of the Election of Officers and Members of Council to be as follows:\n\nPresident:\nA Pedler, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nVice-Presidents:\nSir A. W. Croft, M.A., K.C.I.E.\nThe Hon. Sir C. A. Elliott, K.C.S.I., C.I.E.\nColonel J. Waterhouse, B.S.C.\n\nSecretaries and Treasurer:\nDr. G. A. Grierson, C.S., C.I.E.\nDr. A. W. Alcock, C.M.Z.S.\nC.

Cunningham, F.R.S., C.I.E.\nShams-ul-ulama Moulvie Ahmad.\nC. L. Griesbach, Esq., C.I.E., F.G.S.\nDr. G. Ranking.\nThe meeting was then resolved into the Ordinary General Meeting.\n\nA. Pedler, Esq., F.R.S., President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Chairman before taking his seat said: \"Before proceeding to the business of the Ordinary General Meeting, I have to express my sense of the great honour which this Meeting has conferred upon me, in electing me to the office of President of this Society. When I was asked by the Council to allow my name to be put forward, I felt considerable diffidence in consenting to the request, for I am much afraid I shall not be able to do full justice to the traditions of the responsible post of President, a post which has been held previously by so many distinguished men. I can only hope that during the tenure of my office the prosperity of the Society will not in any way be diminished. I am sure I cannot make a better use of my position, in the first instance, than by asking the Meeting to express their thanks to the late President, Vice-Presidents, Secretaries, and Council, for the time and care which they have bestowed on the affairs of the Society during the past year. Only one who has served as an officer of the Society can fully appreciate the labour and responsibility which falls upon the Secretaries, charged as they are with editing its publications. From personal experience I can say that it means about two hours daily work\u2014work which cannot be overlooked or delegated to others. I, therefore, propose a vote of cordial thanks to the Council and Secretaries of the year 1894.\"\n\n(The vote of thanks was carried unanimously.)\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThirty-four presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next Meeting:\n\nA. F. M. Abdur Rahman, Esq., Barrister-at-Law (for re-Election); proposed by Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, seconded by C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nP. C. R\u0101ya, Esq., D.Sc., Edin; proposed by A.

Hoernle.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following correspondence regarding Mr. Irvine's article on Guru Gobind Singh and Bandah, which appeared in the Journal, Vol. LXIII, Part I, pp. 110 and ff.\n\nAMRITSAR,  \n19th November 1894.\n\n(1) Letter from Mr. Rodgers to Mr. Irvine.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nI have read the paper you wrote on Gobind Singh and Bandah with much interest. I have not the authorities you use, so do not know the contents of any of the books.\n\nI noted some slight inaccuracies which I am going to point out to you, simply because I like all works on the Punjab to be accurate.\n\nJournal, p. 129. Amritsar is 32 miles almost due east of Lahore, not 40 miles north of the capital.\n\nPage 133. Sadhaura is not on a steep hill. The banks of the nadi are just a little elevated. Page 122. The name of the faqir whose tomb is there to this day, is \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u06cc not \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u06cc. I spent a week there when Archaeological Surveyor. General Cunningham's description (Rep. Arch. Survey xiv., 72) of it is full of errors. You did not use him. The country round is flat but intersected with river beds. I heard nothing then of Lohgarh.\n\nPage 134. No coins were struck at Lohgarh. I have made enquiries and no one ever heard of such coins. They were struck at Anandgarh (spelt on the rupees \u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0691\u06be). This is Anandpur I believe of the present day.\n\nThe couplet you give, as having been on these coins, I have never seen. There is one with \u0633\u0631\u0645 \u0648\u0631 in it. The couplet is variously given. In my paper I made a shot at it. I examined thousands of Sikh rupees for my paper. Since I wrote it I have come across Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n rupees with mint name \u0646\u0645\u06a9 'salt,' on them, for Pind D\u0101dan Kh\u0101n. I have also got a \u062f\u06cc\u0646\u0627\u0631 rupee. In copper I have also seen some novelties, notably some coins bearing the name of Dalip Singh.\nAs I am always searching for novelties in Sikh coins and must see some thousands every year, I do not think it possible that any coins were here struck by Banda.\n\nThe earliest Sikh coins in existence are the rupees of Lahore, struck in 1822, Samvat, or 1765 A.D. But you may have some authority for your statement which I have not seen. I distrust all native authorities on coins, as they write without seeing a rupee or mohar.\n\nPage 123. I notice also that the position of Ban\u00fbr is given as some ten to twelve miles north-east of Sirhind. It is E. by S. of Sirhind, about 20 miles.\n\nI have been all over this part of the Punjab, and at Ban\u00fbr, Sirhind, and Sadhaura (not S\u00e2dhaura).\n\nI am,\nYours sincerely,\nC. J. Rodgers.\n\n(2) Mr. Irvine's reply.\n\nMy Dear Rodgers,\n\n12th December 1894.\n\nI am very much obliged, indeed, to you for your letter of the 19th November. Such comments founded on local knowledge are quite invaluable. My own endeavour is to secure absolute accuracy, but, as I daresay you know by experience, it is almost impossible to attain it. I have no personal knowledge of the Punjab, and have to depend on others, on books, and on maps, and I need hardly tell you what hard work it is to identify the names of men, or the situation of places. I was introduced to one of the faq\u00eer family at Lahore, a retired Extra Assistant Commissioner, and he wrote once giving me help in Lahore topography, but he did not continue as he began, for he never answered my second letter, and I have heard that he died not long ago. I wish I had thought of you. I have still a lot of matter into which Lahore and the Punjab enter. If I ever address you a question or two, I hope you will not think it too great a trespass on your time. I will just make a remark or two on the points you raise.\n\nFirst\u2014As to the Topography. The truth is, I left this for revision, from end to end of my work until I had finished; intending when I printed (alas! when?) to use the Imperial Gazetteer, the Indian Atlas, Cunningham, and the Provincial Gazetteer, as I thought if I took up the subject separately I should be less likely to overlook anything. When I wrote out this extract for the Press, I worked up the geography piecemeal, and did not give it a final revision.\n\nAmritsar.\u2014Distances taken by measurement from a small-scale map are likely to be out. That is how I got 40 miles instead of 32\nmiles. How I got N. instead of E. I do not know, unless it was by trusting to that treacherous thing, memory. There is a little N. in the direction, though, is there not?\n\nSadhaurah.\u2014G. Forster, who passed through it, says: \"A village on a high hill of steep ascent (I. 235);\u201d so you see that you may go wrong even in copying from an eye-witness. As all my authorities spell \u0633\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0648\u0631\u0627\u060c I think I was right in putting S\u0101dhanrah, but I notice Forster has Sudhowra, which represents I suppose a short a. I will put, in a note, the modern pronunciation on your authority. I find I first had Sh\u0101h Qamin \u0642\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u060c but finding Faiz \u0641\u06cc\u0636 in the printed text of the Ma'\u0101\u1e63iru-l-umard (I. 830) I assumed that the Native (Calcutta) Editor, being himself a Mahomedan, knew the correct name of the Saint, so I rejected the previous reading taken from the Mird\u0101t-i-W\u0101rid\u0101t. I will get out Cunningham, and note what he says about Sadhaurah.\n\nBan\u016br.\u2014I will correct this,\n\nSecond\u2014Coins. That you have never seen a coin of Bandah's is of course a presumption,\u2014a strong presumption one may even say\u2014that no such coin ever existed. But to use the legal distinction, there is a difference between evidence and proof. Even if no such coin now exists anywhere on the face of this globe, that is not proof that no such coin ever did exist. And in this instance, I see no sufficient reason for rejecting the statement which I have found in my authority. My authorities for this Sikh episode in 1710 are, (1) K\u0101mwar Kh\u0101n, (2) W\u0101rid, (3) Mirz\u0101 Muhammad, (4) Muhammad Ihs\u0101n Ij\u0101d. I do not know when the first was born or when he died (his death must have been after 1137 H.), but he was alive in 1710 and present at Sadhaurah and Lohgarh, being then Mirs\u0101m\u0101n, or Chamberlain, to Rafi'u-sh-Sh\u0101n, the third son of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h. W\u0101rid was one Muhammad Shafi', born at Nadinah, or Naginah (now in the Bijnor District) in 1087 H. He professes to recollect what happened from 1100, and he went on writing up to 1152 H. When he died I do not know. He lived at Delhi from about 1124 H. under the protection of Bairam Kh\u0101n, a noble of good descent. Mirz\u0101 Muhammad was born in 1098 H., was alive in 1152 H., and probably did not die till after 1163 H. He also was in Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h's camp at Sadhaurah in 1122.\u2014But the statement as to the coin rests on the fourth authority, that of the Farrukh Shah Namah of Muhammad Ihs\u0101n Ij\u0101d. The following are the reasons why I accept him:\n\n1. He was a contemporary.\n\n2. He wrote very near the time\u2014he mentions corrections made by Farrukhsiyar in the events of 1129 H. Farrukhsiyar was killed in 1131 H., so the corrections took place before that year; and as the events of 1129 H. had been recorded, it is to be presumed that the\nearlier passage, where the Sikh coin is spoken of, was in existence then, and had been already written. Ij\u0101d himself died in 1133\u2014so says Ghul\u0101m 'Ali Arad (Khir\u0101nah-i-'Amirah, litho. text, p. 28). His work was therefore in existence at the most within 11, probably within 6 or 7 years after 1122 H., the year when Bandah first rose.\n\n3. Ij\u0101d was a native of Sam\u0101nah, Sirk\u0101r Sirhind, and therefore likely to be specially interested on the Sikh rising, and to have friends to supply him with information.\n\n4. He was the official historiographer, and as such, supplied with all the official reports (W\u0101qi'ahs) and news letters (Saw\u0101nihs).\n\n5. The statement as to the coin is not in itself improbable, and I see no object to be gained in inventing such a statement.\n\nYou will note that the word L\u014dhgarh is not said to have been on the coin. Perhaps, if you looked again through your coins, you might find one with \"\u017barb ba Amanu-d-dahr, Maswarat-shahr.\"\n\nI have never seen Namak used as the name of a place, though apparently Namak s\u0101r was\u2014it was the name of the salt mines.\n\nI have not knowingly shirked any difficulty, but have rather made it my object to bring out details and localize as much as possible. As to Sadbanrah, it was quite easy to evade being wrong by saying, \"the tomb of a Saint having some local repute;\" but I prefer to be precise, although I thereby run the risk of an inaccuracy. Again thanking you,\n\nI am,\nYours very truly,\nWm. IRVINE.\n\nExtract from Letter from Mr. Rodgers to the Philological Secretary.\n\nAMBITSAR,\n20th January 1895.\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nSikhism and the coinage of the Sikhs have been pet studies of mine. On reading Mr. Irvine's paper I went into the city to enquire about these L\u014dhgarh rupees that he mentions. Not one of the money-changers here had ever heard of them. I have never seen one. I travelled over the whole of the eastern part of the Amballa district, and I searched for coins in every bazaar. I see thousands of Sikh rupees every year, but as yet no L\u014dhgarh rupee has been seen by me.\n\nThe fact, however, that I have not seen one, is no argument for their non-existence. Just lately I have come across\u2014\n\n(1.) A new type of rupee of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-Din Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h, struck at D\u0101ru-l-Isl\u0101m, 717 H.\n(2.) A rupee of Rafi\u2018u-d-Darajat, with the word instead of .\n(3.) A gold mshar of Zainu-l-\u2018Abidin, of Kashmir, dated 851. This is in lovely preservation, and is the only one known.\n(4.) A d\u00e2m of Akbar\u2019s, struck at K\u00e2l\u00e2naur, the place where he was crowned.\n(5.) A half-d\u00e2m of Ibr\u00e2him S\u00fbr,\u2014the only one known.\n\nI never expected to find any one of these coins. So it may happen that some day I may come across a rupee of L\u00f4hgarh.\n\nYou are at liberty to print my letter to Mr. Irvine, and to use as much of this as you like.\n\nI am,\nYours sincerely,\nCHAS. J. RODGERS.\n\nThe General Secretary read a letter from Mohanto Omrao Giri Gossain asking for the return of the two Tibetan MSS. entitled \u201cLam Rim Chhen-po\u201d and \u201cRdorje Hehha\u00fb Chhenpohi Lam Gyi Rim-pa,\u201d the presentation of which was announced in the Society\u2019s Proceedings for January 1892, and announced that the Council had accordingly ordered the MSS. to be returned.\n\nThe Hon. Sir C. A. Elliott, Vice-President, exhibited a copy of the Tibetan block-print volume entitled \u201cDoKalzang.\u201d\n\nB\u00e2bu \u00c7arat Candra D\u00e2s read the following note on the above:\n\nIn examining the Tibetan manuscripts and xylographs contained in the Asiatic Society\u2019s Library, I have found a very old manuscript volume of \u201cDokalzang.\u201d Its leaves are almost all worm-eaten with the exception of the title-page, which is in a fair state of preservation. The title-page begins with two ornamental letters, called \u201cyig-go,\u201d or the auspicious head letters, followed by two perpendicular strokes meaning full points. Then in Tibetan character is written the following:\u2014\u201cRgy\u00e2-gar skad-du \u0100ry\u00e2 Bhadra Kalpik\u00e2na Mah\u00e2y\u00e2na S\u00fbtra.\u201d In the language of India, the sacred Mah\u00e2y\u00e2na aphorism, called the \u201cGlorious Age.\u201d The text of this manuscript volume is full of mistakes. The block-print volume belonging to the Hon\u2019ble Sir Charles Elliott is a correct edition. It is probably one of the earliest impressions taken from the stereotyped wooden boards that were prepared in 1726 A.D., under the orders of King Miwang. Since then no other edition of this work has appeared in Tibet. When I visited the great Printing Establishment of Narthang, near Tashilhumpo, in 1879, I found that the engraving on the wooden blocks of the Kahgyur had almost become worn out. Recent impressions from them must, therefore,\nbe very indistinct. \"Dokalzang\" is considered holiest among the 108 volumes of the Kahgyur collection, on account of its containing the names of 1,005 Buddhas of the present Kalpa, a forecast of future Buddhism and its power for leading humanity to the state of Bodhi, or Enlightenment. There is a small picture at each end of the title-page. [See Plate No. I.] One of them is Buddha \u00c7\u0101kya Muni with a disc of Saint's glory of blue light round his head, and the other is Maitreya, the coming Buddha. On the back of these two figures of Buddhas there are two rainbows shewing their celestial position. An equal number of disciples and followers attend them both. In the picture of \u00c7\u0101kya Muni his two disciples, \u00c7\u0101riputra and Maud Galyayana, are offering him food from their alms-bowls. \u0100nanda, his personal attendant, is waiting for orders, and Subhuti is standing in a devotional mood to note down whatever may drop from his lips in the way of instruction. An Indian king with his wife and child sits on the floor at the foot of Buddha's seat, in anxious expectation of hearing his sermons. The child is looking to the father for wisdom who is dressed in blue typifying worldliness. The Tibetan artist having no idea of the dress of an Indian R\u0101ni has made the queen look like the wife of a D\u00f4kpa chieftain of Northern Tibet. In the picture of Maitreya, his disciples are offering him burnt incense, and a basket full of gems, gold and silver. A Tibetan highlander, sitting on his knees, with his wife and child, is offering him a large blue gem, called Indra Nila. The child is looking to his mother in love for love. The father is dressed in yellow shewing more of religion. The coming Buddha Maitreya\u2014the personification of love\u2014will bring the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism to perfection. He can, therefore, accept gold and silver. Buddha \u00c7\u0101kya Muni was an ascetic, and called Mah\u0101 \u0100ramana of the highest order, he having absolutely renounced the world, and preached the \u00c7r\u0101vaka doctrine of perfect poverty, and not touch gold, silver, &c. In some pictures and wood engravings of Tibet, Maitreya, the coming Buddha, is seated on a chair\u2014a posture which is evidently foreign to India. As the Mah\u0101y\u0101na School of Buddhism obtained its highest development in the Bactrian Empire of the Greeks, which included in it Kashmir, Cabul, Kandahar, Herat, and the valley of the Oxus, &c., it is probable that from there the Light of the East was transmitted Westward, or that Christianity was foreshadowed in Sanskrit Buddhist works. The similarity of Christianity to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism is striking and Maitreya, the coming Messiah of the Buddhists, who is now the Regent of the Lord in Heaven, called Tushita, will come to this Earth to make all mankind blessed and glorious.\n\nThe two pictures represent the two stages in the spiritual progress of Humanity. The first picture shows a condition of progressive self-\n\u00c7\u0100KYA MUNI BUDDHA.\nMAITREYA, the Coming Buddha.\ncontrol; the process of self-purification is still at so early a stage that\nthe external conditions of the individual have to be carefully adjusted\nto his weak condition. He is an ascetic, denies himself abundance of\nfood, he inhabits the woods, and carefully and scrupulously lives a life\naway from the haunts of men; thus he flies from temptations because\ntemptations may overcome him. So in primitive Humanity the condi-\ntions of life are simple. The second picture typifies a higher state of\nself-control and inner development. The previous discipline has\nborne fruit, and the ascetic no longer requires to live in the woods or\nmonasteries. At the time of Buddha, or of Christ, a new era was\ninaugurated when the children of God \"live in the world though not of\nit.\" Surrounded by temptations of every kind the present and future\nascetic maintains his firm hold upon the inner life, unmoved and\nwithout attachment. Thus the two pictures show forth the law of\nevolution as it affects and powerfully modifies the growth of character\nand development of religion itself, or of the Human capacity to receive\nspiritual revelations.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1.

On changes in the course of the Kusi River, and the probable\ndangers arising from them,\u2014By F. A. Shillingford, Esq.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\nSir Charles Elliott said:\u2014\"The paper, as far as it has been ex-\nplained to us by Dr. Grierson, is open to criticism on many points.\nThe past history of the Kusi river is uncertain. It is admitted that\nit originally flowed in an easterly course, and has gradually reached\nits present position where it flows almost direct south from the gorge\nthrough which it debouches from the Himalayas. But why should not\nthe swing of the pendulum continue till it is deflected as much to the\nwest as it ever was to the east? There seems to be no evidence\nadduced to show that, the river has reached its westernmost position,\nor to show that if it has, it will return violently from a direct southern\nto an extreme eastern course, instead of doing so gradually. Neither\nhas anything been said about the well-known theory of the westering\nof rivers in the Northern Hemisphere which, so far as it is a true\ntheory, would lead us to expect the river to trend in a westerly, not an\neasterly direction. However, the course of the Kusi river has been receiving the attention of Government and of the Public Works Department, and I wish that the Secretary, Mr. Odling, had been here this evening to give the meeting the benefit of his knowledge and experience. A special engineer was deputed during the past rainy season to study the river. His investigation is at present incomplete. The river Kusi commences to spill at Bedr\u0101 in Nepaul. No material change is reported to have occurred in its course since the year 1889, when the main stream came over from the western side of the river, a little north of the place mentioned. The stream, at present, is on the eastern side of the bed, and there are no indications of any immediate change. Some caution is necessary in expressing an opinion as to the future, as it is commonly said that the only certain theory about the river Kusi is that it will behave in a way totally different from what has been predicted. There is a heavy spill on the eastern bank of the river which does considerable damage, large areas of land, mostly however in Nepalese territory, having been thrown out of cultivation during the last five years. It seems that it is mainly the land owners in the district who are apprehensive; the railway engineers entertain no fears on the subject. Still if any measures could be suggested which would commend themselves to experts as undoubtedly tending to secure the district of Purneah against the possible vagaries of the river at a reasonable expense, the Government would be glad to do what it could. It is hardly necessary to say that, as in all similar cases, the objects of the promoters of embankment schemes are, in themselves, so good, that it is impossible not to sympathize with them. The advantages resulting from an embankment are usually immediate and obvious. But there is scarcely a case, in Bengal at least, where it has not happened that in the course of years the difficulties and not unfrequently dangers caused by embankments have become so great that their removal has become a question of discussion. In the case of the Damoodah and Goomti rivers this step became a pressing necessity and has been carried out. At the same time it must be remembered that changes in the course of a river arise from the most trivial causes, such as the occurrence of a snag in the stream, or its meeting a slightly harder bed of clay or kunkar.\"\n\n4. \u0106ri Dharma Maggala:\u2014a distant echo of the Lalita Vistara,\u2014By Pandit Haraprasad \u010c\u0101stri, M.A.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in January last:\u2014\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBatavia.

Lovelock, Esq.\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following Honorary Members:\n\nMajor-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Bart., G.C.B., &c.\nProfessor Hermann, L. E. Helmholtz.\n\nThe Philological Secretary (Numismatic) read reports on the following finds of Treasure Trove Coins.\n\n(I) Report on three old silver coins, forwarded by the Collector of Murshidabad, with his No. 1356G., dated Berhampur, the 8th April, 1894.\n\n1. The coins are stated to have been found at Bhattabati in Thana Manulla Baz\u0101r, while digging earth for making bricks.\n2. They are rupees of Sh\u0101h '\u0100lam, of the Murshidabad mint, and of the years 1189, 152 and [1178], 5. One of them is like No. 1188, and two like No. 1193 of the British Museum Catalogue.\n\n(II) Report on 59 old silver coins, forwarded by the Collector of Birbhum, No. 38G., dated Suri, the 13th April, 1894.\n\nThe Collector, in his letter addressed to the Commissioner of the Burdwan Division, No. 1036G., dated Suri, the 27th November, 1893, states, that in the August preceding, treasure consisting of 60 whole rupees, 16 half-rupees, and 43 quarter-rupees, was found in digging earth for rebuilding a house in the village of Bhavanipur, within the Rajnagar outpost. Of this treasure only the half- and quarter-rupees were acquired for the Government, total 59 coins, which form the subject of the present report.\n\nAll the 59 coins are of British mintage, and (with one exception) of mint Murshidabad, San 19, as described in Mr. Thurston's History of the East India Company's Coinage, pp. 41\u201343. They may be detailed as follows:\n\na, With oblique milling, issue of 1793\u20131818, half-rupees,\n   as in Br. Mus. Cat., Nos. 39, 40.................... 6\n   quarter-rupees, as in Br. Mus. Cat., Nos. 41, 42 .... 11 17\n\nb, With straight milling, issue of 1818\u20131832, half-rupees,\n   as in Br. Mus. Cat., No. 46 ....................... 1\n   quarter-rupees, not in Br. Mus.

Cat. ............. 3 12\n\nTotal:\u2014 58\n\nThe remaining piece is a quarter-rupee of the Surat mint, date 1215, with plain edges, San 46, as in Br. Mus. Cat., No. 100.\n(III) Report on 17 old silver coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Nagpur, with his No. 3354/656, dated Nagpur, 30th May, 1894.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found on the 18th October, 1893. The exact locality of the find is not mentioned.\n\nThe coins are old Nagpuri Rupees of native mintage, in the usual indifferent condition, and of a very common type. Sixteen among them are issues of Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1161-1167 A.H. = 1748-1754 A.D.) and one of Shah Alam. Some of the former show the mint name Surat, others seem to have Katak. The date is lost on all of them.\n\n(IV) Report on 51 old silver coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Nagpur, with his No. 4558/656, dated Nagpur, 23rd July, 1894.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found in Mouza Kumbhari, Tahsil Ramtek, while digging in a field.\n\nThey are small silver coins, of the kind generally known as \"Gadia.\" They are described and figured in the late Sir A. Cunningham's Coins of Medieval India, p. 53, plate VI., figs. 7 and 8, and elsewhere. The coins of the present find are of two slightly differing varieties or dies, and very much clipped.\n\n(V) Report on eleven old silver coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Shahpur, with his No. 751, of 2nd November, 1895.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found in the town of Miani in the Shahpur district.\n\nThey are all rupees of the Durrani king of Afghanistan, Mahmud Shah, who reigned from 1216-1245 A.H. = 1801-1829 A.D. They are also all of the Kashmir mint, and of the year 1217, regnal 2.\n\n(VI) Report on five old silver coins, forwarded by the Collector of Champaran, with his No. 832, dated Motihari, the 5/16th November, 1894.\n\nThe Collector reports in his letter, addressed to the Commissioner of the Patna Division, No. 831, dated Motihari, 5/16th November, 1893, that in February, 1893, hidden treasure, amounting to Rs. 2,000, was found in the village of Damri, under a pakka wall. Only 5 coins of this treasure were recovered by the police.\n\nThese five coins are rupees of the following Mughul emperors of Delhi:\n\na, Akbar, 963-1014 A.H. = 1556-1605 A.D.\n\nAn Ilahi rupee, month Isfandarmuz, of the Ahmadabad mint, regnal year 41 (?), like Br. Mus. Cat., No. 178.\nb, Jahangir, 1014\u20131037 A.H. = 1605\u20131627 A.D., type as in Br. Mus. Cat., No. 472, mint Qandahar, date lost, regnal year 12 ........................................... 1\n\nc, Shah Jah\u0101n, 1037\u20131068 A.H. = 1627\u20131658 A.D., type as in Br. Mus. Cat., No. 643, mint Patna, date 1067, regnal lost, month lost .................................. 1\n\nd, Aurangzeb, 1068\u20131118 A.H. = 1658\u20131707 A.D., two varieties, like Br. Mus. Cat., Nos. 731 and 777, mint of one Surat, dates [10]72 and 1109, regnal of one 41 ... 2\n\n(VII) Report on two old silver coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Mandla, with his No. 2366, dated 12th November, 1894.\n\nNo information is given in the letter of the Deputy Commissioner with reference to the locality and date of finding the coins.\n\nThey are square rupees of Akbar, with the Kalimah, of the type shown in the Br. Mus. Cat., Nos. 127\u2013151. Their dates are 1000 (in numeral figures, not expressed by alif) and 996. Their mints are lost.\n\n(VIII) Report on 24 old coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Rawalpindi, with his No. 2568 G., of 16th November, 1894.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found near Hasan abdal Tahsil Attock, in the Rawalpindi District.\n\nAll the coins are of impure gold, and belong to the class known as \"Class B., Coins of the Great Kusans,\" described by the late Sir A. Cunningham in the London Numismatic Chronicle, Part II for 1893, pp. 120\u2013124.\n\nThe present collection consists of coins of three varieties, distinguished, as follows:\n\n| First variety; with two sub-varieties: |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| 1st sub-variety: with the legends bha, sita and saka, as described and figured by Sir A. Cunningham, in (his) Plate II, No. 2, fig. 124 (l.c.): 13 |\n| 2nd sub-variety, with vi instead of bha ........ 1 |\n\nN.B.\u2014The legend is saka, with long a, as Sir A. Cunningham rightly observes (l.c., p. 122) not sakka as Thomas and V. Smith (Journal, A. S. B., for 1894, p. 182, footnote 2) read. The long a is indicated by the curve at the top of the right-hand stroke of the letter sh, which is distinctly shown in Cunningham's figure 2.\nSecond variety; with legends bhadra and pakandhi,\nas in Cunningham's Plate II, figure 12, p. 124 ....... 6\n\nThird variety; with two sub-varieties:\u2014\n1st sub-variety: legends bha, saya and saka, as\nin Cunningham's Plate II, figure 6 ............. 3\n2nd sub-variety: legends vi, saya and saka. Not\nin Cunningham................................. 1\n\nN.B.\u2014The ya of saya, in sub-variety 1, has the\nold tridentate form, while in sub-variety 2,\nit has the modern form. One specimen of\nthe 1st sub-variety reads sana for saka,\nwhich is probably a mere fault of minting.\n\n(IX) Report on 66 old silver coins, forwarded by the Deputy Com-\nmissioner of the Sh\u0101hpur District, with his No. 45, of 21st January, 1895.\nThe coins are stated to have been found in the village of Khabakki.\nThey belong to the so-called class of punch-marked coins, and\nare of two different types, viz., 26 are circular and 40 are angular\n(square or oblong). They are fully described and figured in the late\nSir. A. Cunningham's Coins of Ancient India, pp. 54ff., plate I, fig. 1\u201319.\n\n(X) Report on 179 old coins, forwarded by the Deputy Com-\nmissioner of Gujranw\u0101l\u0101, with his No. 1435, dated 2nd October, 1894.\nThe coins are stated to have been found in the village of Sadhu\nGuraoja in the Gujranw\u0101l\u0101 District.\nThey are all small coins of mixed metal, of Mu\u1e25ammad Karlk\n(N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn), about 658 A.H. = 1259 A.D., of the well-known type,\npublished in Prinsep's Indian Antiquities, vol. I, plate II, fig. 14 and\nelsewhere.\n\n(XI) Report on 548 old copper coins, forwarded by the Collector of\nP\u016bri, with his No. 1428, dated P\u016bri, 22nd September, 1893, and subse-\nquent correspondence.\nThe Collector in his letter to the Commissioner of the Orissa\nDivision, No. 1427, dated 20th September, 1893, states, that the coins\nwere found about the beginning of March, 1893, buried in a small\nearthen pot, 2 feet below the surface, while excavating earthworks at\nGurbai Salt Factory by the Salt Department at Manikaratna. He\nreports that the villagers were of opinion, that the pieces are more a\nkind of medal worn as armlets by women; and he adds, that the shape\nof some of them supports this theory, but that from the dies on them,\nit is probable that they were some ancient coins of small value.\nAccording to the Collector's letter to the Commissioner, there should have been 573 coins in the lot, but I have only been able to count 548. No number is stated in the Collector's letters to the Asiatic Society of Bengal; and it is, therefore, not quite certain what number of coins was actually dispatched to the Society. Unfortunately the coins were not counted immediately on arrival. They were received by me in an excessively bad state, thickly coated with ancient dirt and verdigris, and looking like a heap of rubbish. I had them first boiled in a sort of pur\u00e9e of tamarind, then put away to soak in the same for about 24 hours, and finally carefully cleaned by rubbing with towels. It is possible, that in the course of this process, the missing coins may have been destroyed or lost. In any case, the loss (if any) is trifling.\n\nThey are probably coins of the class current in certain parts of Ancient India, which are described and figured by the late Sir A. Cunningham in his *Coins of Ancient India*, pages 54\u201366, plates I\u2013III. These coins existed in two distinct varieties: some were cast, while others were punched with dies (single or double). The coins of the present collection, with a few exceptions, belong to the former variety, of cast coins. Some of them still show the protruding marks of the mould in which they were cast. They are of very considerable interest for this reason that no coins of this particular type has ever before been found,\u2014at least not to my knowledge. I shall, therefore, describe them in detail. See Plate II.\n\nThe best made of the coins are clearly die-struck ones. They are so much worn down by usage, that the designs on most of them are barely discernible. On some of them, however, sufficient remains to identify them with coins of the Indo-Scythian class. The obverse shows the well-known standing figure of king Kanishka, pointing with his right hand down to the fire-altar; the reverse show the figures of MAO or MIPO, AOPO (Pl. I, fig. 1), and OADO (Pl. I, fig. 2),* as seen on Kanerki coins. No trace of the legend remains; and in its absence, of course, it is impossible to be quite certain of the identity; but the resemblance of the figures on both the obverses and reverses to those on the corresponding Kanerki coins is very striking. The legends on the Kanerki copper coins were very brief, consisting of one or two words only, arranged along the margin; they would, therefore, be peculiarly liable to extreme erosion. The Kanerki copper coinage, however, was extensively imitated in the later Indo-Scythian period; and the coins here described, may belong to this rather than to the genuine, contemporary Kanerki\n\n* Figure 2 on the Plate is made up of two coins. The reverse shows OADO; the obverse shows Kanerki from another coin.\nANCIENT INDIAN COPPER COINS FROM PUR\u012a\ncoinage. Of these Indo-Scythian coins there are 47 in the present collection.\n\nThe whole of the remainder of the coins are cast coins, and very crude imitations of those of Kanerki. They all show two standing figures, one on each face of the coin, with their arms in varying positions. There is no legend, but most of them are marked with a crescent placed in varying parts of the field. Accordingly they may be distributed into the following classes and varieties.\n\n**Class I. No crescent on either side.**\n\nVariety 1 (Pl. II, fig. 3): obv., figure with r. arm pointing down, l. arm raised, rev., r. arm downwards, l. arm a-kimbo ........................................... 80\n\n*N.B.\u2014In the case of some specimens belonging to this variety it is difficult to say whether they are struck or cast.*\n\nVariety 2 (Pl. II, fig. 4): obv. and rev., both arms pointing down .................................................. 1\n\nVariety 3: obv., r. arm pointing down, l. arm upwards; rev., both arms pointing upwards .................................. 1\n\nVariety 4 (Pl. II, fig. 5): arms bent right-angularly at elbow; obv., arm downwards, l. arm upwards; rev., r. arm upwards, l. arm downwards .................. 1\n\nVariety 5: arms bent right-angularly at elbow; obv. and rev., r. arm upwards, l. arm downwards ............. 1\n\n**Class II, with crescent on the reverse, in the left top of the field:\u2014**\n\nVariety 1: obv., r. arm level, l. arm raised; rev., r. arm is wanting, l. arm level .................................. 8\n\nVariety 2: obv. and rev., r. arm raised, l. arm pointing down; rev., r. arm pointing down, l. arm raised ...... 16\n\nVariety 3 (Pl. II, fig. 6): obv. and rev., both arms level .......................................................... 6\n\nVariety 4 (Pl.

They are clearly imitations of the latter coinage; and it may be assumed that they would not have been made, unless the Indo-Scythian coins had still been current in Northern India. There would have been no object in copying an obsolete coinage. The period of the Indo-Scythian coinage is fairly well-known. Kanishka reigned in the last quarter of the first century A.D. His copper coinage, as well as imitations of it, passed current for about two centuries afterwards. They are found numerously in the Panjab, and occasionally much further east. The present, I believe, is the first occasion of any\nIndo-Scythian copper coins having been found in the extreme east of North India. The fact of their having been found near P\u016bri, the site of an ancient shrine, and place of pilgrimage, may account for it. The cast coins of the present find are clearly local imitations of Indo-Scythian coins, and their age cannot well be later than the fourth century A.D. Whether they were intended to pass current as coins, in the ordinary sense, may not be quite certain. They may have been meant to be used as temple-offerings by the pilgrims, similar to certain imitations of Yaudh\u0113ya coins found in the Panj\u0101b. Possibly they may have been only intended as ornaments.\n\nThe weights of the (apparently) Indo-Scythian coins I have found to vary between 120 and 230 grains. The weights of the cast coins are as follows:\n\nClass I, varying from 122 to 211 grains.\n\" II, \" 116 \" 176 \"\n\" III, \" 106 \" 162 \"\n\" IV, \" 112 \" 146 \"\n\" V, \" 164.\n\nThe weight (full) of genuine Indo-Scythian Kanerki copper-coins, as given by Sir A. Cunningham, is from 130 to 260 grains.\n\n(XII) Report on 32 old silver coins forwarded by the Collector of Burdwan, with his No. 2460G, dated the 18th March, 1895.\n\nThese coins belong to a lot of 63 which are said to have been dug out from a ruined house belonging to some persons in Ras\u016blpur, Thana Kulna, apparently in January, 1895. Only 32 of the lot, those now under report, were recovered by the police.\n\nAll the 32 coins are rupees of the Mughul emperor \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br II, who reigned from 1167\u20131173 H. = 1754\u20131759 A.D. They are all of the mint Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and the year 1171 H. and the 4th regnal year. They bear the usual mint-mark of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, a five-rayed star, on the reverse, but on the obverse they show, in addition, a small sun over the he of b\u0101ds\u0101h, similar to that on the Murshid\u0101b\u0101d issue of 1180 H. of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam (see British Museum Catalogue, No. 1188, Plate XXIX).\n\n(XIII) Report on 892 old copper coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Mandla, with his No. 1991, dated the 15th September, 1894.\n\nThese coins are stated to have been found in a field in the Mauzah Kindri, in the Mandla Tahsil.\nThey are all square copper coins of the Sultans of Malva. These copper coins used to be very superficially struck; accordingly the legends on most of them are worn out so much that neither name nor date can be recognized, though sufficient remains to show unmistakably the Malva type of coin. There are, however, a small number (less than 100) on which sufficient traces of a name or date remain, to attribute them more particularly, as shown below:\n\nGhiyas Shah, 880-906 H. = 1475-1500 A.D., of two sizes, no date legible ........................................... 4\n\nNasir Shah, 906-916 H. = 1500-1510 A.D., of two sizes, date 913 on one ............................................. 8\n\nMahmud Shah, 916-937 H. = 1510-1530 A.D., of two sizes, dates 916, 917, 918, 919 (P), 922 on 15 specimens ......................................................... 72\n\nTotal ... 84\n\nThere are also two curious coins among the lot. They have the usual Malva type, but they show the name Muhammad in full and quite distinct. There is no Sultan of that name known among the Khilji house of Malva. In the Ghori house which preceded it, there is a Muhammad Ghazni Khan, who reigned 838-839 H., but he is not known to have struck any coins. Moreover the coins seem to show traces of the dynastic name Khilji, and the mutilated date on one of them does not fit Muhammad Ghazni Khan. Of this date the unit figure 2 is quite distinct, it also shows a slightly mutilated decade figure, which (from the remains of it) can only be either 6 or 9, probably the former. The only date, that can be made up of these figures to agree with the known period of the Malva Sultans, is 862 (or perhaps 892). The year 862 would fall within the reign of Mahmud I, while 892 would fall to Ghiyas Shah. The name, however, reads quite clear \"Muhammad,\" not \"Mahmud.\"\n\n(XIV) Report on 64 old gold coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of the Jhang District, with his No. 423, dated 1st April, 1895.\n\nIn a previous letter, No. 36, dated the 20th March, 1895, the coins are stated to have been found in the Jhang District, but no further particulars regarding the date and exact locality of the find are given. Together with the coins, a number of gold and silver ornaments, comprising thirteen sets, were sent. As to the finding of these ornaments,\nWith reference to your\nletter about coffee coins\nof India (p. 66 of the\nPhilatelic Review) please\nsend me copies of the\nfollowing information.\n\nI have seen coins\n\n1.

C. Rawlinson, Bart., G. C. B., &c.\n\nThe Council regret that it has fallen to them to report the death of Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Bart., G.C.B., F.R.S., D.C.L., Oxon., LL.D., Cantab. and Edin., K.L.S., and an Honorary Member of this Society since the year 1853.\n\nHenry Creswicke Rawlinson was born at Chadlington, Oxfordshire, in 1810, and was educated at Ealing School. In 1827, when only seventeen years of age, he landed in India, and was attached to the Bombay Army till 1833. He was then deputed on political duty to Persia, where he was actively employed till the rupture of diplomatic relations with that country in 1839. On his return to India he was appointed British Agent at Kandahar, which he successfully held from 1840 to 1842, during the disasters of the Kabul war.\n\nIn 1844, he returned to political duties in Persia, where in the year 1851 he rose to the rank of Consul-General, from which post he retired in 1855, only to be made, on his return to England, a Crown Director of the East India Company. In 1856, he retired from Indian Service with the title of K.C.B., and, after a short period spent in the Council of India, he was sent in 1859, as Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary, to Teheran, where he remained till 1868. In that year he returned to England and was again appointed a Life Member of the Secretary of State's Council. In 1891, he was created a Baronet \"in recognition of his distinguished services to the State, stretching over a long period of years.\"\n\nIn addition to the above-named English honours, Sir Henry Rawlinson was a \"Chevalier of the Order of Merit\" of Prussia, an \"Associ\u00e9 \u00e9tranger\" of the French Institute, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the Vienna Imperial Academy of Sciences. He was also a Knight of the First Class of the Persian Order of the Lion and the Sun.\n\nTo Members of this Society his claims to literary recognition are well known. As a political writer his authority on the Eastern question has long been established by the series of articles commencing with a paper on that subject in the Quarterly Review for 1849, and culminating in his England and Russia in the East, which appeared in 1875, and is still looked upon as a work of first class importance. The seventeen years spent in Persia and Turkish Arabia were, however, not devoted to politics alone. As a linguist Henry Rawlinson stood in the first rank of the brilliant band of discoverers of the middle of this century. His numerous papers, commencing in the year 1846, on the antiquities of the East, and more especially on the cuneiform inscrip-\ntions of Persia, Assyria and Babylonia, including his famous copy of Behistun inscription made in 1847, and published two years latter, which appeared in the Journals of the Geographical and Royal Asiatic Societies have given him an imperishable name. As Professor Max M\u00fcller well remarks, if we followed the process by which Grotefend, Burnouf, Lassen and Rawlinson arrived at the decipherment of the cuneiform tablets, we should see that \"the discovery of the alphabet, the language, the grammar, and the meaning of the inscriptions of the Achaemenian dynasty deserves to be classed with the discoveries of a Kepler, a Newton, or a Faraday.\"\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited an ancient map of Bhakar on the Indus, and read the following letter from Mr. T. D. La Touche, of the Geological Survey, from whom it had been received.\n\n\"I am sending you by parcel post a tracing of an ancient plan of the island of Bhakar, on the Indus, with portions of the towns of Rohri and Sukkur, which may be of interest to some of the members of the Society.\n\nI have not been able to learn much of the history of the plan, but what follows was told me by the Mukhti\u00e4rk\u0101r of Rohri, through whom the plan was obtained from the owner by Mr. Pratt, Deputy Collector of Rohri, who lent it to me for copying.\n\nThe owner is a Sayyad, Ya'q\u016bb 'Ali by name, whose ancestor was, at the time of Akbar's annexation of Sind (1591-92), sub-governor of Rohri, and was made by him governor of the island of Bhakar. The plan was made by Akbar's order, by an artist whose name is unknown, in duplicate, one copy being sent to the Emperor at Delhi, and the other handed down in the governor's family. It would be interesting to learn whether the other copy, sent to Delhi, is still in existence or not.\n\nThe plan is, I imagine, a fairly faithful representation of the aspect of Bhakar as it was before the buildings were demolished. The most interesting point about the whole plan is, however, the building shown in the middle of the river, standing on a rock below the island of Sudh-b\u0113l\u0101. This building has entirely disappeared now; indeed, it is evident that at the time the plan was made, the rock on which it stood was\ncoinage. Of these Indo-Scythian coins there are 47 in the present collection.\n\nThe whole of the remainder of the coins are cast coins, and very crude imitations of those of Kanerki. They all show two standing figures, one on each face of the coin, with their arms in varying positions. There is no legend, but most of them are marked with a crescent placed in varying parts of the field. Accordingly they may be distributed into the following classes and varieties.\n\n**Class I. No crescent on either side.**\n\nVariety 1 (Pl.

F. Rudolf Hoernle, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\nDr. A. Alcock, The Hon. Mr. T. D. Beighton, J. C. Bose, Esq., Dr. G. A. Grierson, C. L. Griesbach, Esq., C. S. Middlemiss, Esq., Babu Panchanan Mukerjee, L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., Dr. F. Noetling, Surgeon Lieut.-Col. G. Ranking, P. C. Raya, Esq., Pandit Haraprasad Castri.\n\nVisitors:\u2014Maulavie Abdus Salam, H. H. Hayden, Esq., W. Mackintosh, Esq.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThirty-seven presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentleman duly proposed and seconded at the last Meeting of the Society was ballotted for and elected an Ordinary Member:\u2014\n\nMaulavie Abdus Salam.\n\nThe following gentleman has expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\u2014\n\nE. C. Cotes, Esq.\nThe Council reported that there were five vacancies in the list of Honorary Members, the Council therefore recommended the four following gentlemen for election as Honorary Members at the next meeting:\n\nProfessor Hofrath Georg B\u00fchler, Ph.D., is at present Sanskrit Professor at the Vienna University. He was formerly a member of the Bombay Education Service, and during that period of his career laid the foundation of a reputation for accurate learning which has ever since gone on increasing. He took a prominent part in the foundation of the well-known Bombay Sanskrit series, in which many excellent editions of classical works in that language, have issued from his pen. It is owing mainly to his efforts that the admitted excellence of editions of Sanskrit works published in Bombay should be attributed. Dr. B\u00fchler has published many articles dealing with Sanskrit and Prakrit Epigraphy in the Indian Antiquary and other scientific Journals, and is now one of the greatest living authorities on the subject. Foremost among his works in this branch of study may be mentioned his edition and translation of the Edicts of A\u015boka, published in German in the Zeitschrift des deutschen morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft, and in English in Epigraphia Indica. In Oriental Biography, his Life of the Jain Monk, H\u0113macandra, is a model of learned research combined with an interesting style. His latest works have appeared in the Vienna Oriental Journal under the title of Oriental Studies, and the last of these is a most important contribution to our knowledge of the Indian Alphabet, which he conclusively shows to be derived from that of ancient Phoenicia.\n\nLord Rayleigh, who is now prominently before the scientific world as the discoverer of a new gas in the atmosphere, has for many years been a leading Fellow of the Royal Society of London, to which he was admitted in 1873. He was Senior Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman in 1865 and for five years, Professor of Experimental Physics in Cambridge University. He has written many scientific papers dealing, in the earlier years, chiefly with Electricity and Sound, but latterly with a wider range of subjects. His best known work is an abstruse treatise on sound, published eighteen years ago. He has been the recipient of numerous honorary degrees from British and Foreign Universities, and is a Member or Associate of many Scientific Societies.\n\nAt the Anniversary Meeting of the Chemical Society held in March last, the Faraday Medal was presented to Lord Rayleigh for the distinguished services he has rendered to Chemical Science through the discovery of Argon.\nLieutenant-General R. Strachey, R.E., F.R.S., C.S.I., is distinguished in many branches of Science, chiefly in Physical Geography, Geology, Botany and Meteorology. He was engaged in the scientific survey of Kumaon and Garhwal in 1848, where he made valuable geological and botanical researches and collections, and wrote an account of its Physical Geography. He is the Chairman of the Meteorological Council, in which capacity he investigated the atmospheric phenomena resulting from the great earthquake at Krakatoa, some years ago. He was delegate of Great Britain at the International Prime Meridian Conference at Washington in 1884, at which Greenwich was chosen as the Prime Meridian.\n\nHe is distinguished as a Geographer, and was President of the Royal Geographical Society in 1887-89, when he delivered a course of lectures on Geography at Cambridge University, which have been since published, and he wrote the article on \"Asia\" in the new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nHe has received an honorary degree at Dublin and Oxford Universities.\n\nHe has written papers on a large variety of scientific subjects, and has been Vice-President of the Royal Society more than once.\n\nMr. C. H. Tawney, C.I.E., M.A., at present Librarian of the India Office, has distinguished himself by his researches in Sanskrit and Prakrit Literature. He has translated the Uttara-r\u0101ma-carita (1871), Two Centuries of Bhar\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101ri (in English verse, 1877), and the M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra (2nd Edition, 1891). He has also contributed several papers to the Journal of this Society and to the Indian Antiquary. His translation of the Kath\u0101-sarit-s\u0101gara, &c., of Soma-d\u0113va, prepared for the Bibliotheca Indica, is a classical work which has rendered important services to students of ancient Indian civilization, and of the science of Folk-tales. The Society owes a special debt to Mr. Tawney for this most valuable work. Since his retirement to Europe and acceptance of his present post, he has added another laurel to those already earned, by translating the important work entitled the Kath\u0101-k\u014d\u1e63a or Treasury of Stories, for the Oriental Translation Fund.\n\nThe Chairman announced that Mr. Frank Finn had been appointed a member of the Council and Anthropological Secretary of the Society.\n\nThe Chairman also announced that Dr. A. Alcock had been appointed to officiate as General Secretary in the place of Mr. C. R. Wilson, in addition to his own duties as Natural History Secretary.\nDr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle exhibited four copper coins of Abdagasases and Kadphises II. with new legends in Bactrian characters. He said:\n\nThe two Kadphises coins are out of a lot of 422 copper coins, found recently on the Kalka-Kasauli road, in the territory of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Patial\u0101. The whole of the coins was transmitted for examination to Mr. C. J. Rodgers, Honorary Numismatist to the Government of India, in Amritsar. He found among them about 40 coins of Kanishkar of well-known types. The rest were coins of Kadphises II., all of them of the ordinary type, though of different dies, except the two, now exhibited. These two, Mr. Rodgers noticed, bore Bactrian legends on the reverse side, quite different from the usual one. He sent them down to me for confirmation. One of them undoubtedly shows an entirely different and new reading. Only one-half of the legend, on the right hand marginal semi-circle, is legible. It reads as follows:\n\n(hegodha)sa or (hego\u1e63a)sa aprataha(tasa).\n\nThe portion enclosed in brackets is not quite distinct. It is quite possible that hegodhasa which seems to give no sense is really tradatasasa. But aprata is perfectly distinct; and tasa fairly so. One would expect apratihatasa, and it is possible that that is really the reading, as the upper part of the apparent akshara ta is rather rubbed. In any case the word apratihatasa forms quite certainly a part of the legend, and it occurs in that place of the coin which usually shows the words himakapiqasa (see Br. Mus. Cat., pl. xxv., fig. 12). The Bactrian letters of these two sets of words could not easily be mistaken for one another. The legend, therefore, on this coin, is certainly a new one. In its entirety it probably reads:\n\nMaharajasa rajadirajasa tradatasasa apratihatasa.\n\nThe term apratihatasa has hitherto never been found on any of the coins of Kadphises II. It occurs, however, on the coins of Gondophares and Rajjabala, who must have been nearly contemporary with him. A variety of it also occurs on the earlier coins of Lysias, Artemidorus and Philoxenus.\n\nWith regard to the other Kadphises coin, I am not quite so certain. Nearly the whole of the Bactrian legend is obliterated. There are only three letters that admit of being read at all. They stand in the middle of the right-hand margin, near the bull's head, where ordinarily the letters of the word himakapiqasa come in. They now seem to read sa maya, but they are slightly mutilated and rubbed; they stand exactly in the place of himaka, and on the whole the probability is\nthat they are really the remnants of that combination of letters. If this be so, this coin is one of the ordinary kind.\n\nThe Greek legend on the obverse of both coins is almost wholly obliterated. On the new coin, a trace of \u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u03a3\u039f (i.e., \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bf\u03bc\u03c5\u03bf) is just recognisable near the right foot of the figure of Kadphises, in its usual place.\n\nThe two Abdagases coins are of very peculiar interest, inasmuch as they present the only instance, hitherto discovered, of Bactrian script running from the left to the right. Hitherto, as is well-known, that script has invariably been found running from the right to the left.\n\nThe two coins were found among a lot of Bactrian copper coins, procured by Mr. J. A. Bourdillon, C.S., from the Gay\u0101 bazar, in December last. The lot consisted mostly of coins of Soter Megas, Kadphises I. (Kujula-type), and Gondophares, with a few of Abdagases of the usual well-known types, and in the usual, much abraded condition. I picked out the best preserved specimens (purchased for 2 annas each), for Mr. Bourdillon's and my own collection, and the rest were returned to the bazar. On closer examination I discovered, among the Abdagases coins, two specimens which greatly differed in two points from the usual type of his coins. In the first place, I noticed, to my great surprise, that a portion of the Bactrian legend runs from the left to the right. In the second place, it appeared that the whole legend was (as usual on most Bactrian coins, copper as well as silver) arranged in two sections. On the ordinary copper coins of Abdagases, as well as of Gondophares, and other late kings, the legend runs continuously all round the margin, and is to be read from the inside of the coin. This, however, is not the usual arrangement on Bactrian coins. As a rule it is not written continuously, but in two sections. The smaller section of the Bactrian legend (on the reverses), giving the name, commences on the lower right of the margin, and runs, along the bottom of the coin, from right to left, to the lower left of the margin; and must be read from the outside of the coin. The larger section commences on the lower right of the margin, and runs up all round the top of the coin, down to the lower left; and must be read from the inside of the coin. Both sections, therefore, commence on the lower right of the margin, and read from the right to the left, in diverging lines. The same arrangement holds good for the Greek legends (on the obverses); only in this case, as Greek is read from the left to the right, the starting point of the two sections is the lower left of the margin. Now on our new Abdagases coins, there is a curious mixture of the Greek and Bactrian arrangements. The legend is written in two sections; the smaller section, giving the name, Abdaga\u00e7asa, begins on the lower right, and runs across\nto the lower left, and reads from the outside of the coin, from the right to the left. This smaller section, therefore, follows the usual system of writing and reading the Bactrian script. But the larger section, commences on the left side, where the smaller section ends, and then runs, from the left to right, round the upper part of the margin, down to where the smaller section commences; and it reads from the inside of the coin. The larger section, therefore, reads from the left to the right, like the Greek. In fact, that section is arranged and reads like a Greek legend, while the smaller legend is arranged and reads like a Bactrian legend, though both sections are written in Bactrian characters. In other respects the legend is the usual one, viz.:\n\nLarger section: Maharajasa tradatasa\nSmaller ditto: Avadagagasa.\n\nMr. Bourdillon's specimen gives the whole of the legend, except the letters vada of the name; but some of the existing letters are rubbed and mutilated; the five letters maha, ja and \u00e7aa, however, are perfectly distinct. On my own specimen of the coin, only a very small portion of the legend is preserved; viz., the letters maha and gagasa. This portion, equally distinct on both specimens, forms, as will be understood from the arrangement, above explained, a continuous set of letters, and is made up of the beginning of the larger and the end of the smaller sections. It is quite characteristic, and sufficient to prove how the whole legend must have run, even if it is not actually extant.\n\nUnfortunately there is not sufficient time to prepare photographic facsimiles of these four coins, before my departure on leave. But, I hope, on my return to publish facsimiles in the Journal, together with such further information, as may be then forthcoming.\n\nDr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle exhibited a number of small fragments of Ancient Manuscripts from Central Asia. He said:\n\nThese fragments were received by me about a month ago from the Foreign Office in Simla, to which they had been sent by Mr. G. Macartney, at Kashghar, where he acts as Special Assistant of Chinese affairs to the Resident in Kashmir. The Foreign Office letter stated that these manuscripts had been excavated in Kuchar and presented to Mr. Macartney by the Manager of the Chinese Foreign Commerce at Kashghar.\n\nUnfortunately these fragments are the merest scraps of what was clearly a collection of several manuscripts. They are too small to be of any literary or historical value; but from the palaeographic point of view they present some points of interest.\nThe fragments number several hundreds, and are mostly utterly useless, but there are about a hundred of the size of one to two inches square, which bear connected letters, and are legible.\n\nThe material of the fragments are of three different kinds: palm-leaf, birch-bark, and paper. The paper is of several varieties of manufacture.\n\nThe number of manuscripts, represented by these fragments, it is difficult to define with certainty. To judge from the varieties of writing and material, however, there must have been not less than eight or nine. There was certainly one manuscript of palm-leaf. There was also certainly one, if not two, of birch-bark; for the writing on the fragments seem to show two different styles of writing. Of paper manuscripts there must have been, at least, five, but probably more; this is shown by the varieties of writing and make of paper.\n\nParticularly noticeable is that the palm-leaf and birch-bark fragments show a purely Indian type of writing, of the North-Western Gupta class, similar to that on the Horuzi palm-leaf MS., and the birch-bark Bower MS. This, indeed, might have been expected from the fact that the material is palm-leaf or birch-bark, which is not obtainable in Central Asia. Manuscripts on these materials must have been prepared and introduced from India. The fact of the occurrence of them in Central Asia may be of considerable chronological value. They exhibit the old form of the tridentate \\( y \\), and the old Gupta form of \\( m \\). The superscript \\( r \\) is formed on the top line of writing instead of above it.\n\nThe paper manuscripts uniformly exhibit the Central Asian kind of Nagari, as shown in the Weber Manuscripts. But they are of considerable variety. Some approach very closely to the pure Indian type, as in Weber MS., Parts I and II (Plate I, Fig. 1, 2; in Journal, As. Soc., Beng., for 1893, pp. 9, 17), others show the purest Central Asian type as in Weber MS., Parts IV to IX (ibid., Pl. II, Fig. 1, 2, 3, Pl. III, Fig. 1\u20135). In particular, there are a few fragments, which are so strikingly like several leaves of the Weber MSS., as to suggest that they may have belonged to missing leaves of the same manuscripts. The writing that remains on the fragments, however, is too defective to allow of arriving at any more certain conclusion.\n\nA Plate of selected specimens is being prepared by Col.

Raghu-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a's dates are 1581-1593 A.D. (l.c., p. 305), so that the coin belongs to the 7th year of his reign.

In the course of his article, Mr. Beveridge quoted Hiuen Tsiang as follows\u2014\"By the side of the capital there rises the monastery called Lo-to-wei-chi-seng-kia-lan,\" which last word is, according to M. Julien, the phonetic equivalent of the Raktaviti Sangh\u0101r\u0101ma, which again Mr. Beveridge argues is the same as R\u0101ngam\u0101\u1e6d\u012b. Lo-to-wei-chi, means, in Chinese, 'red earth,' and cliffs or bluffs of red clay form a prominent feature in the scenery of R\u0101ngam\u0101\u1e6d\u012b. He suggests that instead of Raktaviti, the Sanskrit equivalent should be R\u0101gam\u1e5b\u1e6dtik\u0101, or Raktam\u1e5bttik\u0101, the latter portion of the compound, m\u1e5bttika being the equivalent of the Chinese wei-chi. He further points out that in Hiuen Tsiang's life, the word is Ki-to-mo-chi, instead of the Lo-to-wei-chi of the travels, and suggests that this difference of reading may lead to a settlement of the question. Mo-chi may be right, and may be the equivalent of m\u1e5btti.\n\nSome time ago, I had the fortunate opportunity of submitting the point for the opinion of M. Sylvain L\u00e9vi, perhaps the only person in the world capable of deciding it, for he is equally competent a scholar of Sanskrit and of Chinese. He very kindly writes as follows\u2014\n\n'The difference between the two words Ki-to-mo-chi, of the Life, and Lo-to-wei-chi, of the Si-yu-ki, is simply due to the confusion of two graphic signs nearly identical. The syllable Lo (\u5442) of the Si-yu-ki very closely resembles the character Ki (\u5442) of the Life, the only difference being that the character which surmounts the (p), is (\u5442) in one case, and (\u25b3) in the other. Similarly with regard to the character wei (\u672a) which only differs in the arrangement of its two horizontal lines from the character mo (\u672b). In the former, the shorter line is written above the longer, and in the latter, the reverse is the case.'\n\n'The reading Lo is the more probable, for Julien, in his M\u00e9thode, cites no example of the character Ki occurring in the transcription of Sanskrit names, nor have I ever met an instance. On the other hand, for the same reason, the character mo is more probable than wei. The regular transcription of Lo-to-mo-chi would be a Prakrit from Rattam\u0101\u1e6d\u012b[ka], the equivalent of the Sanskrit Raktam\u1e5bttik\u0101 which corresponds to the meaning \"Red clay\" given to the convent by the Pilgrim.'\n\n1 Journal, Vol. LXII. Pt. I for 1893. pp. 315 and ff.\nThis settles the question, and we are all much indebted to M. Sylvain L\u00e9vi, for his very interesting communication.\n\nDr. G. A. Grierson, Honorary Philological Secretary, read the following note on an early supposed Bang\u0101li version of the Lord's Prayer.\n\nAt the meeting of the Society held in April 1893, I had the honour of reading a paper on the Early Study of Indian Vernaculars in Europe. It was fortunate enough to attract the attention of other scholars, some of whom have made valuable additions to our knowledge of the subject. Amongst these latter may be mentioned a paper read last January before the Reale Accademia dei Lincei of Rome, by Signor Emilio Teza, entitled, Dei primi Studi sulle Lingue indostaniche alle note di G. A. Grierson. Signor Teza has brought the following interesting facts to light.\n\nIn my paper I drew attention to a work of Fritz published in 1748, entitled the Orientalisch-und-occidentalisch Sprachmeister, which contained amongst other things two hundred translations of the Lord's Prayer in different languages. Regarding the Bang\u0101li version given in that work, I said:\n\nThe Bang\u0101li translation, which is taken from Wilkins' sample given in Chamberlayne's Sylloge, is almost worth reprinting as a curiosity for the number of seemingly impossible mistakes it contains. In fact it is quite illegible and unintelligible to every native of Bengal to whom I have shown it. It has evidently been made by some person who got a copy of the alphabet, and a general description of the language, and then 'greatly dared.' Even his knowledge of the alphabet is incomplete.\n\nSignor Teza is the fortunate possessor of a copy of Chamberlayne's Sylloge, from which Fritz copied his Bang\u0101li version, and Wilkins' confession in the Latin Preface to that work clears up the mystery. He says that as he had not been able to obtain a copy of the Lord's Prayer in Bang\u0101li, he had taken a Malay version, and written it in Bang\u0101li characters. The transliteration given by Wilkins of this curiosity is as follows:\n\nBappa kita, jang adda de surga,\nNamma-mou jadi bersakti,\nRadjat-mou mendarang,\nKandhatimou menjadi de bumi sepetj de surga,\nRoti kita derri sa hari-hari membrikan kita sa hari inila,\nMakka ber-ampunula padakita doosa kita, seperti kit\u00e1 ber-am-pun-akan siapa bersala kepada kita,\nD'jang-an hentar kita kapada tjobahan,\nTempi lepasken kita dari jang d'jakat:\n\n1 See Journal, Part I. for 1893, p. 41. 2 L. c., p. 48.\nKarna mou pun'ja radjat daan kauwassahan daan ber-bessaran sampey kakakal. Amin.\n\nIt appears according to Signor Teza, that the above is actually Malay.\n\nThe version in so-called Bang\u0101li characters, of which the above is Wilkins' transcription is now worth reprinting,\u2014for as a matter of fact only a few of the characters are Bang\u0101li, and those few are wrongly used. Thus de is written \u1e5b\u1e6d instead of \u1e5b\u1e6d. It is either an absolute invention of Wilkins, which is not probable, or it is some hybrid character used by Malay Sailors in their intercourse with Bengal. Wilkins was under the impression that, at the time when he wrote (1715 A.D.), Bang\u0101li was disappearing as a language, its place being taken by Malay.\n\nAnother correction has been made by Signor Teza, to which I take this opportunity of drawing attention. In my article I mentioned that the first grammar of Hindust\u0101ni was that of Schultz, published in 1745, a work which I had not had the good fortune to see. Signor Teza is the fortunate possessor of a copy of this work, which appeared in Halle in 1744 (not 1745). Schultz, in his preface, mentions a still earlier grammar. In 1743 there appeared the Miscellanea Orientalia of David\n\n1 L. c., p. 47.\nMillins, in which was inserted a grammar of the Hindustani language composed by John Joshua Ketelaer, for some time Ambassador of the Dutch East India Company, to the Great Mogol, at Agra. Ketelaer's Hindustani version of the Lord's Prayer is given by Signor Tesa and will bear reprinting as a curiosity. It runs\u2014\n\nHammare baab\u2014Ke who asmaanmehe\u2014Paak hoe\u00e9 teere naom\u2014Aure hamok moluk teera\u2014Ho\u00e9 resja teera\u2014Sjon asmaan ton ejimienmo\u2014Bootie hammare nethi hamkon aade\u2014Oor maafkaar taxier apne hamko\u2014Sjon majkarte opre karresdaar onkon\u2014Nedaa hamko is was wesjeme\u2014Belk hamko ghaskar is boerayse. Teeree he patsjayi, soorrauri alemgiere keamet-me. Ammen.\n\nI owe to the courtesy of Mr. W. Irvine, the following information about Ketelaer. He was accredited to Shah 'Alam Bahadur Shah (1708-1712) and Jahandar Shah (1712). In 1711 he was the Dutch Company's Director of Trade at Surat. He passed through Agra both going to and coming from Lahore (via Delhi), but there does not seem to be any evidence available that he ever lived there, though the Dutch Company had a factory in that city subordinate to Surat. The Mission arrived near Lahore on the 10th December 1711, returned to Delhi with Jahandar Shah, and finally started from that place on the 14th October 1712, reaching Agra on the 20th October. From Agra they returned to Surat. A detailed account of the Embassy, taken from a diary kept by one Ernst Coenraad Graaf, first sworn clerk to the Embassy, will be found in F. Valentijn's Oud en Nieuw Oost Indien, Vol. IV. (Ed. 1726), pp. 282-302. Some further particulars concerning Ketelaer will be found in Ost Indien und Persische Reisen, von Johann Gottlieb Worms, Aus D\u00f6beln ......, oder ......, aus Licht gestellt durch M. Crispinum Weisen Past. Zu. Mochau, 1st Ed. Dresden 1737; 2nd Ed. Leipzig 1745, 8vo. From this we learn that Ketelaer was also called K\u00f6tel\u00e4r, Kessler, or Kettler, and that he was a Lutheran born at Elbingen in Prussia. In 1716 he had been three years Director for the Dutch Company at Surat. He was then appointed their envoy to Persia and left Batavia in July 1716, having been 30 years in the Dutch Service, or in the East Indies. He was a heavy corpulent man, and died of fever at Gambroon on the Persian Gulf on his return from Isfahan, after having been two days under arrest, because he would not order a Dutch ship to act under the Persian Governor's orders against some Arab invaders.\n\nI take this opportunity of drawing attention to some early works on Indian languages which have come to my notice since I wrote\n\n1 Second Ed., pp. 22, 247, 248, 303.\nmy article. Father Heinrich Roth, S. J., attached to the Goa Mission journeyed from Goa to Agra about 1650-1660. About 1665 he returned to Rome, and drew up for Athanasius Kircher, S. J., five plates for the latter's *China Illustrata* (published at Amsterdam in 1667). The first four of these plates contain the alphabet and elements (in the Devan\u0101gar\u012b character) of Sanskrit, explained in Latin, and the fifth Our Lord's Prayer and an Ave Maria in Sanskrit and Latin, to serve as an exercise for beginners. According to Constable, these are the first specimens of Sanskrit ever printed or engraved (as for a book) in Europe, or indeed anywhere.\n\nAbraham Roger was the first Dutch Chaplain (1631-1641) at Pulicat. He died at Gouda in Holland in 1649. In 1670, his widow published a work by him entitled, 'La Porte ouverte, pour parvenir \u00e0 la Connaissance du Paganisme cach\u00e9.' On pp. 29 & ff. of this book there is printed a Dutch translation of Bhar\u1e6d\u1e5bhari's C\u0101takas made by a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 named Padman\u0101bha the first translation from Sanskrit published in any European language.\n\nFinally I may refer the reader to the Hindust\u0101ni translation of the Acts of the Apostles, dated 1748, to which attention was drawn by Mr. W. Irvine in the Proceedings of the Society for Decr. 1893, pp. 174 & ff.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. *On the D\u014dg\u0101m Mint.*\u2014By Surgeon-Captain W.

Gait on Historical Research in Assam is republished in the Proceedings, for the information of members of the Society.\n\nBy Order of Council,\n\nG. A. Grierson,\nHon. Phil. Secretary.\n\nHistorical Research in Assam.\n\nThe sources of information regarding the past history of Assam may be classed under the following heads:\n\n(1) Information recorded at the time on coins and inscriptions on temples, rocks, &c.\n(2) Historical documents drawn up at or about the period to which they relate.\n\n(3) Quasi-historical puthis written long after the events with which they deal.\n\n(4) Stray historical references in religious works.\n\n(5) Traditions unwritten, but still current amongst the people.\n\nI will deal with each of these sources of information separately.\n\nCoins.\n\nWe know the coins of the following dynasties:\n\n(a) \u0100h\u014dm kings.\n(b) Koch\n(c) Kings of Jaintia.\n(d) ,, Manipur.\n\n(e) Kings of Tippera.\n\nIn the V\u0101mp\u0101vali of Lak\u1e63mi N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, it is stated that the king of Khairam had a mint, but no coins of his have yet come to light. It is not improbable that the Khyen kings, who preceded the Koch, also coined money, but here again we have at present no definite knowledge; nor do we know anything about the coinage of the kings of Cachar.\n\n3. The \u0100h\u014dm coins, which are octagonal in shape, are of two classes: those inscribed with the old \u0100h\u014dm character, and those on which the characters are a kind of modern N\u0101gar\u012b. Coins of the second class are well known; many of them have been described by Marsden, and large numbers can still be obtained. In regard to them, all that seems to be needed is to catalogue all known coins with their inscriptions and dates, and to examine as many private collections as possible and describe all not already mentioned in Marsden or other numismatical works. The other class of coins, on the other hand, requires a good deal more attention. Until recently, when some deodhais deciphered one for me, none of these coins had been read. The Asiatic Society of Bengal now propose to send up all the coins of this class in their collection for examination and decipherment, but I do not yet know how many they have got. Moreover, as they have been collected without reference to their (unknown) mintage, it is doubtful how far they are representative of the different monarchs in whose reigns such coins were struck. After we have obtained readings of the Asiatic Society's coins, I think we should at once institute a search for the coins of any kings not found in the Society's collection. Of the two coins of which I have obtained readings, one relates to Chuklenmung* (1539 A.D.\u20141552 A.D.), and the other to Chup\u0101\u1e6dph\u0101, alias Gad\u0101dhara Simha (1681\u20141695 A.D.). The latter must be one of the last coins struck in\n\n*The reading of this coin has been sent to the Society.\nthe old character, as in the reign of the next king, Rudra Simha,* we have many coins struck in the N\u0101gar\u012b character. The former may or may not be one of the earliest: in the buranji of K\u0101\u00e7i N\u0101th T\u0101muli Phukan the coinage of the Ah\u014dms is said to have commenced two reigns later, in the days of Chuchengpha, who came to the throne in 1611 A.D., and is attributed to the civilising influence of Sundar Gos\u0101in and others who had been taken to the Koch capital as hostages by Sil\u0101r\u0101i, and who were released and returned home during Chuchengpha's reign. Even if the first coinage was in Chuklenmung's reign, we have still fourteen rulers in the period during which the first class of coins was minted.\n\n4. The coins of the Koch kings are not so well known, and every effort should, I think, be made to add to the number which have been described up to date. In marked contrast to the number of Ah\u014dm coins in his collection, Marsden describes only two Koch coins, one of Lak\u1e63mi N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, dated 1549 Sak, and one of Pr\u0101\u1e47 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, dated 1555 Sak.\u2020 In the addition to these, we have a coin of Nar N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, dated 1477 Sak, which was found in the G\u0101r\u014d Hills, and was described in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1875, and another of Lak\u1e63mi N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, dated 1509 Sak, which was obtained for me by Babu M. C. Bardalai.\u2021 The same Babu also procured for me two smaller coins of this dynasty,\u2021 but the names of the kings is not very clear on these. Marsden printed a similar small coin (MCCXVIII) under the head \"Uncertain.\"\n\nThe above meagre collections, so far as I know, constitutes all that we know of the Koch kings' coinage. We should, I think, do all that we can to add to it, as the matter is one not merely of numismatic interest, but is also of importance as helping us to fix the otherwise rather uncertain dates of some of the kings of this dynasty. That a systematic search would add to the number of known coins is shown by the fact that the three coins procured for me by Babu M. C. Bardalai were obtained by him after a very short enquiry.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 [Since the above was written two valuable papers on Koch and Ah\u014dm coins have been received from Mr. Gait, and will duly appear in the Journal of the Society. Ed.]\n5. A search for Jaintia coins would apparently be less fruitful, as all which I have yet seen (save those of the last ruler) bear the same inscription, viz., \"\u00c7ri \u00c7ri Jayantapur Purandarasya.\" No king is mentioned on these coins. The dates of the coins which I have seen are 1630, 1653, 1696, and 1704 Sak.\n\n6. I know very little of the Manipur coins, which were square in shape. Perhaps the Political Agent might be able to make a collection. As regards Tippera coins, it may be observed that these do not directly concern us. They are, however, indirectly of interest as confirming or contradicting the dates given in the R\u0101jm\u0101la, or Chronicles of the Kings of Tippera, in which some references are made to the rulers of Cachar or Hiramba, and as relating to a race which we know to be closely allied to our Kach\u0101ris, Mor\u0101ns, &c., and a country which the chronicles of the Mungkong Sh\u0101ns mention as having been conquered by a section of that race many hundred years ago.\n\nI may mention here that it seems highly probable that many finds of coins occur, which are never reported. Last year, I addressed the Agent and Chief Engineer, Assam-Bengal Railway, on the subject, and, after adverting to the provisions of the Treasure Trove Act, drew attention to the great importance of securing the examination by competent authority of all coins found. A circular was issued by the Agent on the subject, but from what I have since heard, it seems doubtful whether very great attention has been paid to it.\n\n7. The next source of information are inscriptions. These again may be classified as\u2014\n\n(a) inscriptions on copper plates;\n(b) inscriptions on temples built by Koch kings;\n(c) inscriptions on temples built by the \u0100h\u014dms;\n(d) other inscriptions.\n\n8. Of the copper plates yet discovered, the most important are those of Vanam\u0101la* and Kum\u0101ra P\u0101la,\u2020 which tell us something of old rulers in the Brahmaputra Valley; and the two discovered some years ago in Sylhet, which tell of the ancestors of Gaur Gobind, the Hindu king who was defeated by Shah Jal\u0101l.\u2021\n\nOther plates contain land grants by \u0100h\u014dm kings, and are of use for the same purpose as the inscriptions on temples built by the \u0100h\u014dms, to which reference will be made below.\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, IX, page 766.\n\u2020 Supplement to Pay\u0101t for February, 1893.\n\u2021 Proceedings, Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1880, page 141. These plates were brought to notice by Mr. Luttmann-Johnson, who was at that time Deputy Commissioner, Sylhet.\nI am told that there are in existence copper plates of land grants by the kings of Jaintia. These would be of greater value than those of the Ahoms, as Jaintia is one of the old kingdoms of which our knowledge is at present most fragmentary. It is not improbable that other local rulers in the Surma Valley made grants of land on copper plates; and it would probably bring some useful information to light if a systematic enquiry were instituted in that district into the origin of the lakhiraj grants there. The proceedings under the old Resumption Regulation of 1819 would probably show where further enquiry would be useful.*\n\nA few older plates may also from time to time come to light; but their discovery must apparently be a matter of chance rather than of systematic enquiry\u2020.\n\n9. Two useful inscriptions on temples built by Koch kings are known, viz., those at Haj\u00f4 and Kamarupa;\u2020 others may perhaps be included amongst the inscriptions noticed below as not yet deciphered.\n\n10. There are numerous inscriptions on temples erected under Ahom auspices. All of these bear dates of the reign of Rudra Simha (1695-1714 A.D.) and subsequent kings, and are of use chiefly in checking the dates given in the buranjis, and in showing the extent of country ruled by the princes in question, and the degree to which they were dominated by Hindu influences. Most of the inscriptions of this class were copied under Colonel Keatinge's auspices, and all that remains to be done is to collate these copies and see what additions to our existing knowledge of Ahom history and chronology can be derived from them.\n\n11. Amongst \"Other inscriptions\" may be mentioned two on rocks on the bank of the Brahmaputra near Tezpur, which have never yet attracted the attention which they seem to deserve, a deciphered inscription at Khaspur and another undeciphered at Maibong, and two inscriptions which were said to be undecipherable in the enquiries made in Colonel Keatinge's time, viz., one on the door of the Siddheshvara temple in Sambangsar manza in Kamrup, and another on the temple of Chandika in the same district. No doubt further search would bring other inscriptions to light; I think that ruined palaces, such as that of Bishnuka near Sadiya, of Harati in North Lakhimpur and of Bhalkuka at Bhalkupung, and the old Kachari capitals at Dimapur, Maibong,\nand Kh\u0101spur, &c., might be more carefully examined than they have yet been, and that ruined temples, such as the one on the hill at Silgh\u00e1t, might also receive some attention. We have not yet, I think, given to these ruins the attention which they deserve.\n\n12. Excluding the State archives in Manipur, the only historical documents which I am acquainted with are those of the deodhais of Sibs\u0101gar. There may be a few with the Gosains of the M\u0101juli,* and the high families of State are also said to have kept private buranjis, some of which are doubtless still in existence. The deodhais' buranjis were examined by K\u0101\u00e7i N\u0101th T\u0101muli Phukan in connection with the \u0100s\u0101m Buranji compiled by him. My proposals for their transcription and translation will be found further on.\n\n13. Of the works of a quasi-historical nature, the most important by far is the Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101li of R\u0101j\u0101 Lak\u1e63mi N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, which contributed a large portion of the matter contained in my paper on the Koch Kings. R\u0101j\u0101 Prasiddha N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47 has also a Vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101li, which, however, is much more brief and less reliable. Neither of these were written at the time, but both were composed while kings of the Koch dynasty were on the throne, when the events which transpired in early reigns may be thought to have been still fresh in the minds of the people.\n\nThere are doubtless other similar works, but my knowledge of them is limited. The Kum\u0101ra Harana, which deals with the conflict between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and B\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101, is almost, if not quite, mythical, and the incident is taken almost in its entirety from the Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a. The interest attaching to this work lies chiefly in the peculiar old Assamese in which it is written (e.g., \u092c\u093e\u0928 instead of \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e, &c.), and it is of no great value for our present purpose. It has, however, been printed (long ago) in puthi form, and it would be as well to acquire a copy if this could be done for a reasonable price. A more interesting work is that known as \"Arimatta's puthi,\" in which Sankar Deb is supposed to recite to the Koch King Nar N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47, the history of ancient rulers in the province, including that of Arimatta and of the B\u0101ro Bhuiy\u0101s.\n\nI saw a copy on paper of this puthi recently, but am told that there is a very much more ancient copy on s\u0101ci bark in the possession of Sis\u0101kuram Manzad\u0101r of Bangfang in North Lakhimpur.\n\nEnquiries might be made with advantage with a view to finding out what other puthis are in existence. It is quite possible that there may\nbe V\u0101\u1e45c\u0101valis in the possession of the R\u0101j\u0101s of Beltol\u0101, Dimuria, R\u0101ni, and Luki, and that much historical information might be obtained from the records of the Barpeta sattra and the sattra of Upper Assam.\n\nSome of the old Musalman families of Sylhet may have records which would help us to learn something of the history of that district during Muhammadan rule.\n\n14. Of historical references in religious writings, there are two kinds. First, there are the old traditions References in religious works. of the Y\u0113gini Tautra, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, and similar works; and secondly, there are the writings of the religious revival inaugurated by Sankar Deb, such as the Guru Caritra and Sagkar D\u0113bar Jiban-caritra. To the former kind we are indebted for most of what is known of the country prior to the Khyen kings, while from the latter we learn about the advent of the B\u0101r\u014d Bhuiy\u0101s, and gather sundry contemporaneous references to Musalman invasions, &c. Some of these works have been printed.\n\n15. Lastly, we come to the still unwritten traditions of the people. It is doubtful how far these will serve our purpose, but there is no doubt that they will sometimes be of use. Thus, I have been given a list of 21 Jaintia kings, whose names have been handed down by tradition. Of these, the 7th and 8th are mentioned in the \u0100s\u0101m Buranj\u012b as father and son, and as having reigned sometime between 1611 and 1649 A.D.; and the 15th as having reigned sometime between 1695 and 1714 A.D.; the 20th, we know, died in 1832. So far, therefore, as can be judged from these outside references, the traditional names and order of reigning of the Jaintia kings may be relied upon as correct.\n\nThe Chutiyas similarly may have some traditions which would help us. We know from \u0100h\u014dm sources that their deoris were worshipping at the copper temple at Sadiya 400 years ago, and it would be strange if they could not tell us something of the time when their own r\u0101j\u0101s ruled the country prior to their subjugation by the \u0100h\u014dms.\n\n16. I have detailed above the different sources of information Action to be taken now. from which, so far as I can see, we are likely to be able to collect information regarding the ancient history of Assam. The action which we should now proceed to take is noted below:\n\nCoins\u2014\n\n(1) Old \u0100h\u014dm coins to be read, and a search to be made for the coins of kings not yet collected.\n(2) A complete catalogue to be made of later Ahom coins, and any new ones not in the list thus made to be acquired.\n\n(3) A thorough search to be made for coins of the Koch kings and earlier dynasties, if any such can be found.\n\n(4) A collection and description of Manipuri coins to be undertaken under the auspices of the Political Agent, Manipur.\n\nInscriptions\u2014\n\n(5) A search to be made for copper plate grants by Jaintia and other Sylhet rulers.\n\n(6) Ahom land grant plates to be collated.\n\n(7) Ahom temple inscriptions to be collated.\n\n(8) Inscriptions on rocks at Tezpur, on the Siddheshvara and Chandika temples, and at Maibong to be photographed, and rubbings of the same to be taken and sent to some competent scholar for decipherment.\n\nHistorical documents\u2014\n\n(9) The Manipur State records to be copied and translated. [This work might perhaps be undertaken under the supervision of the Superintendent of the State.]\n\n(10) The Ahom historical puthis to be copied and translated.\n\n(11) A thorough search to be made for other historical documents.\n\nQuasi-historical writings\u2014\n\n* I already have a rough translation.\n\n(12) Vamcavali of Lakshmi Narayan to be copied and translated.*\n\n(13) Vamcavali of Prasiddha Narayan to be copied and translated.\n\n(14) Arimatta's puthi to be copied and translated.\n\n(15) A copy of the Kumara-harana to be purchased, if available.\n\n(16) A search to be made for other similar documents, and a catalogue of those found to be made in the same form as that adopted in Bengal by the Asiatic Society.\n\nReligious Works\u2014\n\n(17) Copies to be purchased of all old Assamese religious works which have been printed.\n\n(18) A search to be made in the libraries of the sattras with a view to ascertaining if they contain any historical matter.\n\nTraditions\u2014\n\n(19) Traditions to be recorded whenever heard of.\n\n17. Of the above, it seems to me that action is most urgently called for in regard to the decipherment of coins in the old Ahom character, and the copying and translation of the Ahom historical puthis.\nThe knowledge of the Ahom language is disappearing very rapidly, and the number of deodha\u00efs, who still preserve a respectable knowledge of their ancestral language, is extremely small, certainly less than a dozen all told. Even these say that it is so long since they made any study of the subject that they are forgetting what they were taught in their younger days, and the rising generation decline to concern themselves with a language which can yield them no practical advantages. They prefer instead to learn to read and write Assamese, and thereby to qualify themselves for mandalships and other similar appointments.\n\nConsequently, it is even now difficult to obtain a correct reading of the coins in the Ahom character, and to secure a satisfactory translation of the more difficult passages in the puthis. It seems to me, therefore, that an intelligent person should be entertained at once to learn the Ahom language and character, and to supervise the reading of coins and the copying and translation of the Ahom historical puthis. If he worked hard, three or four months should suffice to enable him to learn enough of the language to see that the puthis are correctly copied, and that the translations given are fairly reasonable.\n\nIf, however, this proposal is approved of, it seems to me that it would be in every way desirable to take the opportunity to obtain copies and translations of all the more important puthis, and not merely of those which are exclusively historical in their purport.\n\n18. I recently made some enquiries at Sibsagar regarding Ahom puthis, and annex a list of twenty-eight, which have been catalogued by Babu Phanidhar Chaliha, Sub-Deputy Collector. The list is admittedly incomplete, even for the extant records of the deodha\u00efs of Sibsagar sadr, and there must be many more puthis in existence not only there, but also in Jorhat. The people are afraid that Government has some ulterior object in trying to find out about these books, and more than one man who is known to possess old puthis has denied being the owner of any. Then, again, the Bailongs also possess puthis, but these, I take it, deal chiefly with divination and kindred subjects.\n\nTurning to the puthis already registered by Babu Phanidhar Chaliha, it will be seen that the list includes only three buranjis, viz.,\u2014\n\n(1) From Khunlung and Khunlai to Kamal\u00e7\u00e7var, i.e., from 568\u20141795 A.D.\n\n(2) Chukapha, i.e., invasion of Assam.\n\n(3) From Gadadhar to Gaurinath, i.e., 1681 to 1780 A.D.\n\nI feel sure, however that more will be discovered after further\nsearch, and in any case, those three would in themselves furnish a sufficient reason for employing some one to learn the language and furnish us with an account of what they contain.\n\nNext to the historical buranjis, the puthis of which it would, in my opinion, be most desirable to obtain translations are those of a religious nature, as from these we should, for the first time, be able to gather some idea of the form of Hinduism which was carried from India to the Shan states before the rise of Buddhism, or, at any rate, of the extent to which the earlier Hinduism entered into the religion previously professed by the Shans. Out of the 28 puthis in Babu Phanidhar's list, I think that at least 14 should be translated. The copying of a small puthi is estimated to take 14 days, and that of a large one 28 days. On an average, it may be assumed that 20 days would be required for copying each puthi. This would be done by the deodhais themselves, and the remuneration they would require would be about Rs. 10 per mensem. Consequently, it would cost us about Rs. 100 to obtain copies of 14 puthis. Assuming that it took the person appointed to supervise the work four months to learn the Ahom language, we should have to pay his teacher Rs. 4 x 10 = Rs 40. Having learnt the language, he would have to go through each of the puthis with the deodhai who copied it, and having got its meaning, he would have to translate it. Assuming that this took about the same time as the copying, the translator would be engaged on the work for 280 days, and he would have deodhais working with him for the same length of time. Consequently, the total expenditure on the remuneration of the deodhais would be Rs. 240, and to this would have to be added the pay of the translator for 120 days while learning the language and 280 days while translating, or about 14 months in all. I can obtain the services for this purpose of an intelligent young Assamese, who has passed the F. A. Examination, for Rs. 30 per mensem, or Rs. 420 for the whole period of 14 months. He would also have to be given a small contingent grant for paper, &c. If more buranjis come to light, or if it is decided to deal with all known Ahom puthis, he would be required for a longer period; in the above calculation, I am only estimating for the cost of copying and translating the more important puthis in Babu Phanidhar's list. For this purpose, I think that a grant of Rs. 400 this year and Rs. 500 next year would suffice to cover all the charges which are likely to be incurred.\n\n19. If the above proposals are sanctioned, it may perhaps be thought impracticable to sanction a separate establishment for searching for manuscripts until the translation of Ahom puthis has been brought to a conclusion, but even if no special staff is employed, I think we might\nbe doing something. District officers and others can search for manuscripts and copper plates, and the more important of the former which are known might be copied.* If a small grant of Rs. 500 a year could be allotted for two or three years, it would, I think, suffice to enable us to get photographs, and rubbings of the inscriptions referred to in paragraph 16 (8), and to obtain copies and translations of such historical and quasi-historical writings as are already known to exist, excluding those in Manipur, for the copying and translating of which the State might fairly be called upon to provide the necessary funds. It would also leave a margin for the purchase of the coins referred to in paragraph 16 (1) (3) and (4) whenever any new ones are brought to light, and if any money should still remain available, it might profitably be spent in the gradual exploitation of the old ruins of palaces, forts, and temples which are scattered all over the province. In the meantime, enquiries could be carried on by the district staff and other persons interested into the different sources of information indicated in this Note, and we should thus be able to know, by the time the copying and translating of Ahom puthis has come to an end, in what directions it would be best to continue our operations with a view to rescuing from oblivion the past history of the province.\n\nE. A. GAIT.\n\nSHILLONG,\n\nThe 6th September, 1894.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Note on the Oriental Species of the rhopalocerous genus Eurytela, Boisduval.\u2014By Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., F. E. S., C. M. Z. S., &c.\n\nIn 1869, Dr. A. R. Wallace in his \"Notes on Eastern Butterflies\"* enumerated two species of the genus Eurytela, Boisduval, as occurring in the East, E. castelnau, Felder, from the Malay Peninsula (Singapore), and Borneo, and E. horsfieldii, Boisduval, from Java. No new oriental species have since been described, but the known habitat of these two species has been greatly extended since then. I find on a close examination of my large series of specimens of the genus, that they can be split up considerably into distinct species; these I briefly characterise below. I have not thought it necessary to figure the new species from India, as Mr. F. Moore will shortly deal with them in his \"Lepidoptera Indica,\" vol. ii. E. fruhstorferii, however, from Java, will be more fully described and figured elsewhere hereafter.\n\n* Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1869, p 331.\nEurytelas appear to be always rare, never occurring in large numbers anywhere. Captain E. Y. Watson has noted that their flight is like that of Neptis, as they fly with wings extended flat, parallel with the ground; they settle on the tips of leaves with open wings, and then raise their wings slowly over their backs. This note I can confirm, having seen E. horsfieldii alive in the forests at Selesseh in North-Eastern Sumatra. The females of all the oriental species of Eurytela on the wing remind one at once of tawny Neptes, or more closely of species of Ergolis, which is, I believe, a protected genus, and of which the very differently-coloured females of Eurytela are probably mimics.\n\n1. **Eurytela castelnaui**, Felder.\n\n*E. castelnaui*, Felder, Wien. Ent. Monatsch., vol. iv, p. 401, n. 26 (1860); idem, id., Reise Novara, Lep., vol. iii, p. 450, n. 739, pl. lxi, figs. 5, 6, *male* (1866); id., Wallace, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1869, p. 331, n. 1; id., Distant, Rhop. Malay., p. 136, n. i, pl. xv, fig. 10, *male* (1882); p. 441, pl. xliii, fig. 10, *female* (1886); id., de Nic\u00e9ville, Butt. of Ind., vol. ii, p. 13 (1886); id., Staudinger, Ex. Schmett., p. 105, pl. xxxix, *male* (1885).\n\n**Habitat**: Malay Peninsula (*Feller*); Singapore; Borneo (*Wallace*); Perak, Malay Peninsula (*Distant*); Sumatra (*Snellen*); Nias Island (*Kheil*); Palawan, Philippine Isles (*Staudinger*); Daunat Range, Tenasserim, Burma; Taiping and Perak, Malay Peninsula; N.-E. Sumatra; Nias Island (*coll. de Nic\u00e9ville*).\n\nMale specimens taken in December on the Daunat Range, Tenasserim, have on the upperside of the hindwing a prominent discal black line extending from the costa to the abdominal margin. This black line is also present in one specimen from Sumatra in my collection.\n\n2. **Eurytela fruhstorferi**, n. sp.\n\n**Habitat**: Central Java, 1500 feet.\n\nThe male of this species may be known from the same sex of *E. castelnaui*, Felder, on the upperside of both wings in the blue coloration being of a different shade, distinctly lighter, with a strong gloss, which in some lights causes the surface to present a distinctly glossy green appearance. In figuring *E. castelnaui*, Felder quite correctly portrays the upperside \"without gloss,\" and Dr. A. R. Wallace notes the same thing. The only difference in markings noticeable is on the upperside of the hindwing, *E. castelnaui* having the submarginal black line very narrow and clearly defined, *E. fruhstorferi* having it many times broader, and the edges somewhat diffused.\n\n3. **Eurytela horsfieldii**, Boisduval.\n\n*E. horsfieldii*, Boisduval, Faun. Ent. Madagascar, p. 54, n. 1, *male* (1838); id., de Nic\u00e9ville (*part*), Butt. of Ind., vol. ii, p. 12, n. 302 (1886); *E. horsfieldi*, Wallace,\nL. de Nic\u00e9ville\u2014Species of the genus Eurytela.\n\nTrans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1869, p. 381, n. 2; *E. stephensii*, Boisduval, Faun. Ent. Madagascan, p. 55, n. 2, female (1833).\n\nHABITAT: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014(Boisduval); Java (Wallace); ? Fort Stedman. Shan States (Manders); ? Karen Hills; ? Singmo, Shan States (Elves); Katha, Mepl\u00e9 (April), Burma; N.-E. Sumatra; Preanger, Java (colls. de Nic\u00e9ville and Watson).\n\nThe male of this species is characterised on the upperside of both wings by its rich dark blue coloration, with a very broad submarginal black band to the hindwing. The female, of which I possess a single example only from Sumatra, has the paler markings of the upperside of a somewhat dark shade of ochreous. I have not access to the original description of this species, so cannot say if Dr. Boisduval characterised it from Javan specimens or not; I presume so, however, as Dr. Wallace gives Java as the sole habitat of the species, and its name would indicate that it is a Javan species, as Dr. Thomas Horsfield's researches in the fauna of that island have a world-wide reputation.\n\n4. **Eurytela glaucescens**, n. sp.\n\n*E. horsfieldii*, de Nic\u00e9ville (part, nec Boisduval), Butt. of India, vol. ii, p. 12, n. 302 (1886).\n\nHABITAT: Papun (November and December), Methalauk near Papun (November), Karen Hills, 500-1500 ft. (December), Tonngu (December), Mepl\u00e9 (October and December), all in Burma; Central Java, 1,500 feet (colls. de Nic\u00e9ville and Watson).\n\nThe male of this species may be known from the same sex of *E. horsfieldii*, Boisduval, by its very much duller coloration on the upperside, being of an almost plumbeous or glaucous tint instead of a rich indigo-blue; and it does not possess a broad submarginal black band to the hindwing, and the submarginal black line on the forewing also is obsolete. The female (of which I have access to three specimens) is in two examples from Papun of a more luteous shade on the upperside than in my single Sumatran example of *E. horsfieldii*, in another Papun example the shade of colour of the upperside is very dark and might be described as dull ferruginous, with the apical portion alone of the broad discal band common to both wings luteous on the forewing.\n\n5. **Eurytela andamanensis**, n. sp.\n\n*Eurytela horsfieldi*, Moore (nec Boisduval), Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1877, p. 585; *E. horsfieldii*, Wood-Mason and de Nic\u00e9ville (nec Boisduval), Journ. A. S. B., vol. xlix, pt. 2, p. 228, n. 21 (1880); idem, id., i.e., vol. i, pt. 2, p. 245, n. 28 (1881); id., (part), de Nic\u00e9ville, Butt. of Ind., vol. ii, p. 12, n. 302, pl. xviii, fig. 69, male (1886).\n\nHABITAT: South Andaman Isles.\n\nThe male of this species agrees with the form which I have con-\nsidered to be typical *E. horsfieldii*, Boisduval, i.e., it is rich dark blue on the upperside of both wings, with a very broad submarginal black band to the hindwing. The female differs from the same sex of *E. horsfieldii* on the upperside of both wings in having the broad discal band very pale luteous; as compared with the band in *E. horsfieldii* it may be said to be almost white so much paler is it; and on the hindwing it is continued almost to the base of the wing.\n\n2. A Kashmiri War Medal.\u2014By C. J. Rodgers, Esq., Honorary Numismatist to the Government of India.\n\nSome time ago I came across the medal of which the accompanying is a drawing. It has on the obverse the picture of a mountain fort on which is a flag flying. To the left of the fort is the legend\u2014\n\n\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0629 \"Medal\n\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a for bravery\n\u0646\u062c\u0645 \u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629 at the taking of the Fort\n\u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u064a of Mandauri.\"\n\nOn the other side in a leaf pattern area:\u2014\u0661\u0669\u0662\u0660 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646\u2014\"The country of Y\u0101sin, 1920 Samvat=1863 A.D.\n\nIn Amritsar I could get no information about the Fort of Mandauri. I therefore applied to Kashmir through the Resident. I was informed that a medal had been struck and that no further information was available. So I wrote to Captain Trevor of the XVth Sikhs and asked him to make enquiries. He did so, and his correspondent General Panj\u0101b Singh wrote him and said that the Fort of Mandauri, which is the name of the fort at Y\u0101sin, was taken by General Hoshy\u0101rji according to orders received from His Highness the late Maharaja of\nKashmir, and that after its conquest medals were struck for both officers and men. The drawing is of the medal for the men.\n\nThe medal from which I made this drawing is now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. It is interesting at the present time when Y\u0101sin, which is beyond Gilgit, is mixed up with our border affairs.\n\nThe medal is interesting as being one of the few, known to us, issued by a Native State, as a memento of services in the field.\n\nWe ought to have all the medals of all our wars in India, in the Indian Museum and have them edited with notes on the wars for which they were given.\n\n3.

The Commission does not claim to have arrived at a perfectly scientific system: it has been necessary to have regard to established customs and also to take into consideration the differences of pronunciation.\nwhich the letters of the Arabic Alphabet have received in the various Musulman countries.\n\nThis is one of the reasons for the two methods of transcription which the Commission has proposed as alternatives for certain letters.\n\nThe number of letters whose transcription is a matter of option has been brought to the very lowest possible number consistent with necessity, and we may fairly hope that Orientalists of all countries will take pains to render this number still smaller, by keeping as closely as possible to the method of transcription to which the Commission has deemed it a duty to give the preference.\n\nWith regard to the transcription of Sanskrit there has been far less diversity of opinion, and difficulty has only been experienced in the transcription of a very small number of letters.\n\nIn such cases, the Commission, in weighing the various equivalents proposed, has chosen those which on the whole appear to be the most practical. To arrive at uniformity, each country and each Society ought to make certain concessions, and the Commission hopes that the systems now put forward by it will be unanimously accepted and put in practice forthwith.\n\nBarbier de Meynard.\nG.

That would have been an arduous, and to tell the truth, an impossible task, inasmuch as, to be really definite, the proposals would have had to take into account not only scientific results already achieved or supposed to be achieved, but those also which without doubt, are held in reserve for the future. Its mission was a more modest one. In presence of the systems of transcription already adopted, if I may so say in the rough\u2014on one hand by the Royal Asiatic Society and on the other by the Deutsche morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft\u2014but open to modifications of detail, the Commission was called upon to express its opinion, and to attempt above all to arrive, by certain eclectic corrections, at the unification of the two series. We have neither the right nor the power to establish a universal uniformity, which would be the real desideratum.\n\nFor instance, I myself did not put forward any French proposition.\n\nThe transcriptions in customary use in the various countries have nevertheless, in a general way, shewn such an evident tendency to approach one another that it hardly seems presumptuous in these days, to predict a unanimous accord in the not distant future. It was then desirable to decide those propositions which appeared, from their very simplicity, to be of a nature to form by degrees, a rallying point for all.\n\nWe were not able to lose sight of the essentially practical nature of the task assigned to us: we were above all bound to pay special attention to the presumed feeling of India, where the adoption of an uniform transcription in proper names and for daily use is so urgently necessary.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Commission could not fail to incline towards pure and simple acquiescence in the propositions which had been submitted to their consideration, in so far as these propositions were concordant: and this principle met with the unanimous approval of the Commission, except in one point.\n\nThe two proposals agree in transcribing the r and l vowels by r and l (ted).\n\nMonsieur de Saussure, who is a high authority on these matters,\nthinks that he cannot accept this notation, and he has been kind enough to reduce his reservations to writing in the following terms:\n\n\"It is desirable, in the interests of Indo-European linguistic science, and quite apart from all personal conceptions of the question, that the notation \\( r \\) should be preferred to the notation \\( r l \\) for this reason, that in the analysis of every Indo-European language Sanskrit not excepted, the vowels \\( m n \\) hold a position in all respects equivalent to that of the vowels \\( r l \\); consequently, if we adopt \\( r l \\), we compel linguists to write \\( m n \\), and as a further consequence there arises a confusion between \\( m \\) and certain notations of anusvara\u2014and between \\( n \\) and the cerebral consonant \\( n \\).\"\n\nThe Sub-Commission is compelled to recognize the force of this argument which is, moreover, all the stronger from the fact that MM. B\u00fchler and Windisch bear testimony that the German Oriental Society had originally of its own accord inserted in its programme the transcription \\( r \\) and \\( l \\), with a circle. If in spite of this, the Sub-Commission has not thought fit to propose the adoption of this amendment, its action is due to considerations of a purely practical nature. The German Committee only decided upon the transcription \\( r \\) and \\( l \\) (with a dot) after due discussion, and a special vote.\n\nWould it then be wise to reopen the debate upon a question of detail upon which the German Committee finally accepted without previous agreement, the English proposals? Would not this be to endanger at the very outset, an undertaking the success of which is so eagerly desired? On the other hand, it seems essential to the really wide and general spread of the system, that it should as far as possible, offer to the eyes even of the uninitiated, only such symbols as will neither grate against their sensibilities nor startle them\u2014signs with which they are sufficiently familiar from their habitual use in other directions in the current alphabet.\n\nIt is moreover only too evident that the transcription in which we attempt to come to an understanding, would not satisfy the demands of linguistic science, in themselves perfectly legitimate at least without many other retouchings which must, however, be given up since the only excuse for introducing them would condemn the attempt beforehand to an annoying barrenness of results. I pass on to the points very few in number, in which we have been obliged to exercise a choice, owing to the two systems not agreeing. No sign for the long \\( l \\) vowels has been fixed upon by the German Oriental Society. The notation proposed by the London Society, by means of \\( l \\) with two dots underneath it, appears to recommend itself. Typographic exigencies do not permit of the letter \\( l \\) being surmounted by the sign of the long accent. This lack\nof symmetry; side by side with \\( r \\) and \\( f \\), has so much the less importance because the \\( l \\) as a long vowel is more rarely used.\n\nFor the \\( e \\) and the \\( o \\) in Sanskrit it seems of no advantage to place the sign of the long accent above the letter; no confusion is possible: and it appears preferable to keep the use of diacritical signs for exceptional cases where, whether in Sanskrit or in Prakrit, one has to denote the short \\( e \\) or the short \\( o \\), \\( \u0113 \\), \\( \u014d \\).\n\nFor the guttural \\( n \\), we propose to adopt \\( \u0101 \\) with a dot above it. It does not seem that there is any ground for introducing as the London table proposes, a particular sign specially invented to meet this unique case. The notation \\( \u0101 \\) is widely used among Indianists of all countries, and as for the objection which the London Society advances against the addition of a diacritical sign over a consonant, this has all the less weight with us in that every one agrees in accepting the form \\( \u0101 \\) to represent the palatal \\( \u0101 \\). The notation \\( \u0101 \\) is based on the analogy of other nasals and need give rise to no surprise.\n\nBy a very curious change of positions it is the English who propose \\( \u03c8 \\) for the palatal sibilant and the Germans who propose the notation \\( \u015b \\), whereas \\( \u015b \\) was originally very generally employed in the English transcriptions and \\( \u03c8 \\) in those of the continent. This is perhaps, for the very reason of the wide diffusion of this sign \\( \u03c8 \\), the most delicate point upon which you have to decide.\n\nYour Sub-Committee did not underrate the difficulties which exist in modifying old customs, and the danger there is of more serious error between three different \\( s \\) forms. If however, they finally decide in favour of the transcription \\( \u015b \\), this decision is not due to any excessive desire for symmetry between the sibilants, but is for three reasons which it will suffice to rapidly indicate.\n\nThe first is happily expressed by the report of the London Society. It rightly recommends preference being given to transcriptions of such a kind that in cases where the diacritical signs are compulsorily or accidentally omitted, the pronunciation will not be too far disfigured for European ears. Although this principle is not capable of invariable application it is good to keep to it as far as possible.\n\nOn the other hand, great stress has been laid upon the disfavour with which the notation \\( \u03c8 \\) is sure to be regarded in India: the French practice having only familiarised very few people with this letter. This would come as a surprise to the great majority of those interested. Dr. B\u00fchler considers that if we attempted to bring over to it, for example the Indian Antiquary, we should encounter an invincible opposition. This is a consideration whose gravity it is impossible to ignore. The superiority of \\( \u015b \\) for clearness and convenience of indexing has no less impressed the Commission.\nThe table of the German Oriental Society transcribes the cerebral l by l with a point subscript. There is not it is true any serious risk of confusion in practice between the vowel and the cerebral l. It is however preferable to establish a difference between the writing of the two letters, so that each separate symbol of the Devan\u0101gari alphabet may possess its appropriate equivalent in the alphabet of transcription. The l with a line subscript answers perfectly, as the London Society proposes, for the notation of the cerebral l.\n\nAgainst this the transcription of Anun\u0101sik\u0101 by \u1e41 in place of the simple sign \u2014 placed above the vowel recommends itself at once by its symmetry with the notation \u1e41 of the anusw\u0101ra and by the advantage which it possesses of reflecting, by an alphabetic character the phonetic value of which it is the exponent equally with all the other signs. Upon these bases, the alphabet of transcription would be thus constituted.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na & \\quad \u0101 & i & \u012b & u & \u016b & r & \u1e5b & l & \u1e47 & e & ai & o & au \\\\\nk & kh & g & gh & \u1e0d & c & ch & j & jh & \u1e45 & t & th & d & dh & \u1e47 & \u1e43 & \u1e41 \\\\\np & ph & b & bh & m & y & r & l & v & \u015b & s & h & \u1e37 & \u1e43 & \u1e41 \\\\\nvisarga & \u1e25 & jihv\u0101m\u016bliya & \u1e25 & upadh\u0101niya & \u1e25\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAs to the accents, the ud\u0101tta would be represented by the acute accent ' ; the svarita by the circumflex ^ ; and the anud\u0101tta by the grave accent ' .\n\nSuch, gentlemen, are the modest conclusions without pretensions to being systematic, which your Sub-Committee has the honour to submit to you.\n\nYour Sub-Committee is of opinion that it is only by very carefully adjusted reforms that it will be possible to make any decisive progress in the unification of rival systems.*\n\nThe cooperation of two powerful Societies such as the German Oriental Society and the Royal Asiatic Society of London whose agreement under these conditions would appear to be assured, cannot fail to be a very powerful lever.\n\nThere is moreover every ground for hope that propositions so eclectic and so little ambitions will command even other and valuable adherents.\n\nEmile Senart.\nPROPOSALS\n\nOF THE\n\nSUB-COMMITTEE FOR THE TRANSLITERATION OF THE ARABIC ALPHABET.\n\n1.

PLUNKETT.\n\nThe Honorary Philological Secretary laid on the table two communications received from Maulvi Abdul Wali of Sailkapa, Jessore, regarding Mr. W. Irvine\u2019s article on Guru Gobind Singh and Banda,\u00b9 and the correspondence between that gentleman and Mr. C. J. Rodgers on the same subject.\u00b2 Maulvi Abdul Wali states that the name of the author of the Farrukh Shah N\u0101mah\u00b3 was Mir Muhammad Ahsan, and not Ihsan. The book is wrongly called Farrukhsiyar n\u0101mah. During the reign of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam, Mir Muhammad Ahsan Ij\u0101d was appointed Vakil to the sark\u0101r of Prince \u2018Azimu-sh-sh\u0101n, son of Sh\u0101h \u2018\u0100lam, by \u0100saf Jah (Nig\u0101mu-l-mulk), and was given by that Prince a command of three thousand troop. In Farrukhsiyar\u2019s reign he received the title of Ma\u2019niy\u0101b Kh\u0101n and was employed by him to write the Sh\u0101h N\u0101mah, which he used to show once a week to the Emperor, receiving on each occasion a reward of Rs. 1,000, and a Khil\u2019at. Having completed his History to the end of Farrukhsiyar\u2019s reign, Muhammad Ahsan died in 1133 H.\n\nThe above facts are extracted from Mir Ghul\u0101m \u2018Ali \u0100z\u0101d\u2019s Biographical work, the Khir\u0101nah-i-Amirah.\u2074\n\nThe Maulvi also suggests that the correct spelling of Lohg\u0101r\u1e25 and sac\u0101 p\u0101dsh\u0101h on p. 134 of the Journal, Vol. LXIII, Pt. I, should be Lohg\u0101r\u1e25 and sac\u0101 p\u0101dsh\u0101h respectively. He translates the inscription on p. 135 as follows: \u2018Gurn Gobind Singh inherited from (not found in) N\u0101nak, sword, pot, and conquest, help without hindrance.\u2019 As regards Sadhwara or S\u0101dhw\u0101r\u0101, he points out that Mir Ghul\u0101m \u2018Ali \u0100z\u0101d in\n\n\u00b9 See Journal, Vol. LXIII, Pt. I, pp. 112 and following.\n\u00b2 See Proceedings for 1895, pp. 35 and ff.\n\u00b3 Proceedings, 1895, p. 87\n\u2074 Incorrectly called the Khir\u0101nah-i \u2018Amirah of Ghul\u0101m \u2018Ali Arad, on p. 88 of the Proceedings for 1895.\nthe Khazana-i-Amirah (Lith. Ed. p. 425) says that Ananda-ram, Mukhli\u015b, the poet and rais, was an inhabitant of Sudahrah or Suduhrah within the jurisdiction of L\u0101h\u014dr. He suggests that this may possibly be the same place as S\u0101dhaur\u0101.\n\nThe Honorary Philological Secretary exhibited a remarkable carved conch shell, forwarded by Mr. Gait, and read the following letter from that gentleman which accompanied it. The Inscription reads\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending for exhibition a shell with the ten avatars carved on it, which has been found in the possession of a native of the Cachar District, and forwarded to me for inspection by Babu Krishna Kumar De, Assistant Settlement Officer. The shell is interesting on account of the inscription, which is to the effect that it was carved in the reign of Vira-darpa-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, in the month of Agra\u1e25\u0101ya\u1e47a, 1593 \u00c7aka (1671 A.D.).* No written records of the Kach\u0101ri r\u0101j have hitherto come to light, and the traditions of the people give little more than a long list of kings. Any items of definite information such as that contained in this inscription, are, therefore, most useful.\n\nThe same King is referred to in an \u0100h\u014dm bura\u00f1ji, which was translated into Assamese and published in the Arun\u1e0dai of 1851 A.D., in which it is stated that in 1567 \u00c7aka (1645 A.D.), he sent messengers to the \u0100h\u014dm King, Nari\u0101 r\u0101j\u0101, asking for his daughter in marriage. In this bura\u00f1ji he is called also Hijimb\u0113\u00e7vara and Vira-bhadra.\n\nThe same bura\u00f1ji speaks of a Kach\u0101ri invasion in 1410 \u00c7aka (1488 A.D.), in the course of which the \u0100h\u014dms were defeated on the bank of the Dikhu river. Thirty-seven years afterwards an \u0100h\u014dm force ascended the Dhansiri river to attack the Kach\u0101ris, and a few years later, in another war, the Kach\u0101ri King, Khunkhara, was killed, and one Neochung was set up in his place. In 1457 \u00c7aka (1535 A.D.), Neochung was in his turn attacked, and his brick city at Duimapur was sacked; Neochung himself escaped at the time, but was subsequently captured and beheaded. About 1525 \u00c7aka (1603 A.D.) there were hostilities between the Kach\u0101ris and the Jaintia r\u0101j\u0101, in which the latter managed to embroil the \u0100h\u014dm King, by offering him his daughter in marriage on condition that he should fetch her by a route which lay through the Kach\u0101ri country.\n\n* The peculiar symbol used to represent the figure 5 which occurs on coins of the \u0100h\u014dm, Koch, Tippera, and Jaintia Kings, is found again in this inscription.\nAn inscription on a ruined temple at Maibong runs\u2014\n\n\u00c7aka 1643 (1721 A.D.), Gr Hari\u00e7andra Bh\u016bpati.\n\nThere is a Sanad in existence bearing the name of Kirti-candra-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, in which certain arrangements are made for the Government of the plains portion of Cachar, which is interesting as showing that the final retreat of the ruling family from Maibong in the North Cachar Hills to Kh\u0101spur in the plains of Cachar, had taken place before that date. This movement is said to have been due to oppression by the Jaintias, just as the exodus from Duimapur to Maibong is ascribed to the continued attacks of the \u0100h\u014dms. The latter movement probably took place after the sacking of the city in 1457 \u00c7aka (1535 A.D.)\n\nYours truly,\nE. A. Gait.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.

G. Rankin, seconded by Dr. G. A. Grierson.\n\nThe following gentleman has expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\n\nBabu Hem Candra Gosvami.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following members:\n\nDr. V. Ball (non-Subscribing Member).\nDr. R. Gosche, (Associate Member).\nProfessor Rudolf von Roth (Honorary Member).\n\nThe Honorary Philological Secretary read the following announcement of the death of Professor Rudolf von Roth, an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nThe Council regret that it has fallen to their duty to report the death, in the seventy-fifth year of his age, of Professor Rudolf von Roth, Doctor of Philosophy, Theology and Laws, Ordinary Professor of Oriental Languages and Chief Librarian of the University of Tubingen, Member of the Academies of Berlin, Munich, Gottingen, Vienna, St. Petersburg and Paris, and an Honorary Member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which took place on the 23rd June, 1895.\n\nRudolf Roth was born at Stuttgart on April 3rd, 1821. After taking his degree at Tubingen, he went to Paris, where, together with Max Muller, he studied Oriental Literature under Burnouf. He then proceeded to England, where he applied himself to the Vedic MSS. of the East India House and the Bodleian, and returned to Tubingen in 1845. Shortly afterwards he published his first work on the Literature and History of the Veda, which was received with great favour. In 1848 he was appointed Extraordinary, and, in 1856, Ordinary Professor of Oriental Languages at Tubingen; since which time he published numerous essays and treatises of minor importance; but the work with which his name is imperishably connected is the great St. Petersburg Sanskrit Lexicon, the first volume of which appeared in 1855, while the last was completed in 1875, twenty-five years after the book was first undertaken. In this he was associated with Dr. Bohtlingk, who took charge of the department of Classical Sanskrit, while Roth principally devoted himself to Vedic, and to Medical Literature. Roth's contribution to this monumental work has ever since remained the founda-\ntion of all Vedic research; this is the greater testimony to his learning and accuracy, when we remember that at the time when he wrote, there were few printed texts available, and nearly all his information had to be collected from manuscript materials.\n\nOriental scholars feel that in losing Rudolf von Roth, the \"old man eloquent\" of Sanskrit learning, they have lost not only a great teacher but a close friend. His hospitable house on the vine-clad banks of the Neckar was ever open to the travelling student, where the boundless stores of his learning were ungrudgingly placed at the disposal of the inquirer. He had many distinguished pupils, of whom, perhaps, the late Professor Whitney is the best known, and when the Philological Secretary was in T\u00fcbingen some ten years ago, he found there, studying under him, pupils of men who had been Whitney's pupils, all of whom had sat in turn at the feet of the eminent Professor.\n\nDr. von Roth was elected an Honorary Member of this Society in 1881. He was ennobled by the late king of W\u00fcrttemberg in recognition of his great services to oriental scholarship. The University of Edinburgh gave him the degree of LL.D., honoris causa, and he was honoured in various ways by many Continental Academies and Societies, but the greatest testimony to his learning, is the monument, *are perennius*, which he has left in the pages of the St. Petersburg W\u00f6rterbuch.\n\nThe Secretary reported that Mr. N. D. Beatson-Bell had compounded for his subscription as non-resident member by the payment in a single sum of Rs. 300.\n\nThe Honorary Philological Secretary exhibited a copper-plate grant, by which king \u00c7iva Sinha of Mithil\u0101 gave the village of Bisapi to the famous poet Vidy\u0101pati Thakkura, and made the following remarks:\n\nThis grant was translated by me in the *Indian Antiquary*, Vol. XIV (1885), p. 190, in an article entitled 'Vidy\u0101pati and his contemporaries.' I had then to depend on a copy procured through the agency of a Pandit. The Grant is dated in the era of Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-Sena, 292, equivalent to A.D. 1400. The corresponding Vikrama-sambat, \u00c7ak, and (apparently) Hijra dates are also given. For reasons which it is unnecessary to state, I was unable then to get hold of the original plate. My attention has been again drawn to the matter by an article of Dr. Eggeling, No. 2864 of Part IV of the Catalogue of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of the India Office. In describing a MS. of the *Durga-bhakti-tarang\u012bni*, he discusses the whole question of Vidy\u0101pati's life and times. There is no doubt that the date of this grant gives\nrise to serious difficulties in regard to the chronology of Vidy\u0101pati's life, and it is, as Dr. Eggeling says, desirable that the grant itself should be carefully examined. Through the kind offices of Mr. Tute, the Collector of Darbhanga, I have at length been able to obtain possession of the plate for a limited period. It has been photo-sincographed, and a reduced facsimile is published in the Proceedings of the Society (Plate III), so as to allow of its leisurely examination by experts in epigraphy.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. *Ancient Cedi, Matsya and Karu\u1e63a.*\u2014By F.

Constable, Esq.\n\nThe Philological Secretary laid on the table letter No. 3325, dated 21st September, 1895, from the Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal, General Department, covering copy of a communication addressed to the Government of India in the Revenue and Agricultural Department, with enclosures, reporting on the measures taken by the Lieutenant-Governor to procure for the Indian Museum facsimile reproductions of the Asoka Inscriptions in India.\nThe following is Mr. Caddy's general report:\n\nDated Calcutta, the 22nd August 1895.\n\nFrom\u2014Alexander E. Caddy, Esq., on Special Duty,\nTo\u2014The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Revenue Department.\n\nI have the honour to submit a general report of the tour I have just completed and of the operations connected therewith.\n\n2. His Honour was pleased to depute me to visit the several sites of the Asoka inscriptions in Bengal enumerated below, and to bring away plaster casts of each inscription. I was also required to photograph the locale of these inscriptions and other objects of allied interest:\n\nI & II.\u2014The two Champaran columns, north and south of Bettiah.\nIII.\u2014The Sasaram rock edict, in Shahabad.\nIV.\u2014The dedicatory tablets of the Barabar and Nagarjuni caves\u2014seven in number\u2014in the district of Gaya.\nV.\u2014The inscribed rock at Jaugado in Ganjam, in the Madras Presidency.\nVI.\u2014The inscribed rock at Dhauli, about 25 miles due south of Cuttack.\nVII.\u2014The inscription of Aira Raja in the cave at Udaigiri, about 6 miles north of Dhauli.\nVIII.\u2014The dedicatory and descriptive tablets in the Udaigiri caves\u2014nine in number.\n\n3. At a committee held in your rooms previous to this appointment, at which Sir Alfred Croft and Mr. Jobbins were present, it was determined that the casts should be in plaster of Paris, and that the moulds should be brought to Calcutta and worked out.\n\nMy deputation commenced on the 15th October, and I was provided with a staff of two modellers, a plaster man, and khalasi.\n\nMessrs. Mackintosh, Burn, and Company were to supply me all with the gypsum I wanted, as my plaster had to be prepared on the spot.\n\n4. My first care had been to study the properties of gypsum and the several processes of converting it into plaster. Mr. Br\u00fchl, of the Civil Engineering College at Sibpur, helped me in this considerably, and we determined that the Madras method, as described by Dr. Hunter in one of the 1851 numbers of an Art journal published in Madras, was the best.\n\n5. I had seen my modellers at work, but not with satisfaction as to their method: it took too much time; and I consequently devised means whereby a quantity of plaster may be dealt with at once and efficiently.\n6. Taking the mail train at Howrah on the night of the 15th, I reached Mokameh Ghat the next morning. The railway ferry took us on to the Bengal and North-Western Railway line at Semaria Ghat, and a day's run brought us into Bettiah.\n\n7. In Champaran there are two pillars bearing identical edicts with those on the Allahabad and Delhi columns, one 20 miles north, and the other 21 miles south of Bettiah. The villages in which they stand are both called Lauriya, and a second local name is necessary to distinguish them. Near the northern pillar there is the old ruin of the fort of Navandgarh; near the southern column are the large market village and the Mahadeo temple of Araraj. The two Lauriyas are distinguished by these names respectively.\n\nThe simple term Lauriya would imply the Navandgarh Lauriya by reason of its being a larger village, its having a post-office and a police outpost, and of the main road to Nepal passing through it. The Araraj Lauriya stood first in the order in which I should take the inscriptions, and there I first went.\n\nThe two Lauriyas are reached from Bettiah. I rode to Barharwa on an elephant; hence to the column at Lauriya Araraj in a bullock coach.\n\n8. The Sub-Deputy Opium Agent, Mr. Bean, asked me down to Barharwa, a village four miles west of Araraj and the head-quarters of his agency. I found every convenience for my work of preparation here, and I have reason to thank Mr. Bean for the facilities he afforded me.\n\nThe rains and floods had just before breaking made traffic difficulties at Mokameh Ghat somewhat serious. My gypsum had not reached Bettiah, nor my tents. The latter I had determined to leave at Bettiah till I went north, as tent equipage was already at my disposal.\n\nThe work of grinding and sifting gypsum got on apace. An oven had been built in deference to the wishes of my modellers, who were not acquainted with the boiling method (as the Madras process is termed), and which was finally adopted.\n\nA few canisters of plaster being ready, and the weather permitting, we went into camp at Lauriya Araraj.\n\n9. The Araraj column stands just by the threshing-floor of the village. It is a sandstone monolith 36\u00bd feet high and 120 inches in girth at the inscription. The southern side still retains its beautifully polished surface; on the other side a lichen has slightly abraded it. The inscription is intact.\n\nThe work before us was much heavier than we had imagined, and it took proportionately longer doing.\n\nOn the 21st November I had the satisfaction of seeing the inscribed\nportion of the column in a plaster jacket, and of stripping it the same evening.\n\n10. As they now lie in the Museum, these mould plaques are curved slabs of plaster of Paris measuring, most of them, $23'' \\times 15''$, and a little over an inch in depth, enclosing a piece of wire netting bound in an iron frame. Each has been barked from the column after being blocked on to it by pouring the liquid plaster into a cell, the inner side being the inscribed stone surface; the outer a stout sheet of tin, the net being suspended in the hollow. A rubber tube led the plaster quietly to the bottom of the well, thus saving much laborious manipulation. These I brought into Bettiah and left there till my return from the northern Lauriya.\n\nAmong other objects of interest shown me by Mr. Gibbon at Bettiah were a few stones from the coping of a well near Tribeni, which bore the honeysuckle ornament of the Erectheum, common to several Asoka columns, and of which he permitted me to take casts, which I have with me now at the Museum. He also arranged for my d\u00e1k to Lauriya Navandgarh.\n\n11. At Lauriya Navandgarh the work was soon in train. Araraj experiences had taught us some lessons, and we saw the plaster gradually covering the inscribed portion of the column in regular slabs.\n\nThis pillar is somewhat smaller than that at Araraj; the latter is massive, and its capital, if it had any, was long since lost. This is the more graceful of the two, and is surmounted by a lion capital. The shaft and inscription are in the same condition as that at Araraj, and in the same material. The couchant lion faces the rising sun. He sits on a circular abacus, the rim of which is girdled by a string of hans (the sacred geese of the Buddhists). This rests on a cable string-course which crowns a Persepolitan lotus-capital or terminal, whose gracefully drooping petals end just outside an egg and dart ovolo, the entablature finishing below in a second cable string-course. The design and workmanship disclose both knowledge and power. The jaw of the lion has been destroyed.\n\n12. I had a rajmistr\u00ed go up to the entablature and mould off a portion of the goose frieze and of the terminal, so that when the column is set up in the Museum it will not end quite abruptly.\n\n13. At the Navandgarh Lauriya, while examining one of the ancient barrows which characterise this village, I found two belts of iron in the same perpendicular axis, from which I surmised they must have bound the earth end of some tall pole. It is probable the report noted by General Cunningham regarding an iron coffin may have had its origin in some such find. From here I returned to Bettiah by elephant, and\nstayed at the dak bungalow till my cases were despatched to Calcutta. There were 86 moulding pieces in 12 cases.\n\n14. My next journey was to Sasaram. Travelling back by rail to Mokameh, I joined the East Indian Railway regular line at Bankipore, whence 32 miles to Arrah.\n\nAt Arrah the Sone Canal has a terminal lock. It is the headquarters station of Shahabad. A contract steamer plies the canal to Dehri, in which I travelled the 51 miles from Arrah. The remaining eighteen miles I had to drive to Sasaram. I arrived there on the 31st December, and on New Year's Day I had the mould of the rock inscription completed.\n\nWhere the Kaimur range of hills ends in the sandstone cliffs near Sasaram,\u2014on the crest of its last peak, some 400 feet above the surrounding country, may be seen the chir\u0101g of a Muhammadan fakir of a dark night. In the day the white tomb of a Muhammadan saint gleams above it. The chir\u0101gd\u0101n (or candle-stick) stands in a small recess on the broken side of the cliff towards Sasaram. A wall is built on either side of it not quite five feet high. Two ledged rocks make an angle pointing inward, where the chir\u0101gd\u0101n on a third rock stands at the apex. The ledge on the left hand bears an inscription 42 inches long and about a foot deep. It is an extra edict of Asoka, and is important for the figured date it bears, 256 years of the Nirvana.\n\nFrom below, the entrance to the cave may be observed as a small square hole in the hillside near the top. The inscription itself is scarcely known, even in Sasaram.\n\n15. So soon as my Sasaram case was despatched, we returned to Bankipore to take the Gaya railway, which has its junction here with the East Indian Railway.\n\nGaya is 57 miles\u2014a three hours' run from Bankipore. I made it my base and sent out my camp to the Barabar hills, 15 miles north. The little station of Bela is 12 miles up the line from Gaya\u201445 miles from Bankipore; it stands abreast of a group of hills. The nearer one, Kauv\u0101 Dh\u0101l, with its grand tor surmounting it, makes a very picturesque mass. A road takes one east from Bela, past this hill and the hill next it, where it norths and skirts it at its eastern extremity; then turning east again, passes the Barabar hill-path and the very holy Patal-ganga well, which receives the perennial waters from a Barabar spring. Again it recurves northward, crosses a field and reaches the Nagarjuni, and ends at the stair leading to the milkmaid's cave. Round the Nagarjuni hill, either way, paths will lead one to the two caves behind, among detached boulders.\n\n16. The locality about the Barabar hills is one of the Holy Places of the Buddhists.\nHere, over the dome-like tops of an outcrop of granite, has been cut a stepped-path which leads to the caves which were at one time an important centre of Buddhist devotion. Long granite rocks with domed roofs run north-east and south-west. In one of them three chambers of some size have been excavated, each with its own door, which is recessed considerably into the rock, to allow the perpendicular walls of the cave to be a safe distance from the outer contour of the mass. I had to bring away moulds of the dedicatory tablets to each of these caves, and to make photographs of them. This was soon done. Of the caves, the one with the most imposing exterior is least finished inside. The work here seems to have been abandoned on the workmen coming on a fissure of more than usual dimensions, but the other two caves and the entrance to the third, and a good part of the Lomas Rishi cave, too, have their walls and roofs highly polished. The glass-like polish given to these surfaces has been the admiration and wonder of ages.\n\n17. The doorway of the Lomas Rishi cave represents the entrance to a handsome hut-chapel, the arch being enriched by a frieze of elephants, the space surrounding it being filled with an elaborate wainscoting. The door has sloping jambs, Egyptian-like. The rock is a quartzose gneiss, and where the elephants are carved, a whiter stone makes the ornament very effective.\n\n18. The Sudama cave, called also Nyagrodha* or Banian tree, has a perfect chamber terminating in a Chaitya chapel, the whole circular dome being carefully made and highly polished.\n\n19. The third cave in this rock is on its other face. The Karnachopar is a single chamber. It bears a very much worn tablet outside, on which I was able to trace the representation of a fish which does not seem to have been observed before. In the doorway, too, there is some fine lettering (comparatively modern), and a word or two in the still undeciphered shell character. Another cave in this range of hills lies east of this group and opens southward. A small vestibule of polished gneiss or granite (as it is commonly called) leads to an unfinished inner Chaitya\u2014a very small one. The inscription, being in the polished recess, is in excellent preservation except where viciously chiselled out.\n\n20. On either side of this rocky ridge there is a plain which would hold a large assembly. To the north-east there is a shallow tank beyond which is an extensive field from which the hills rise up a few hundred feet, and which is crowned with a Hindu temple of the Siddhesvara linga referred to in a later inscription in the Vapiya cave.\n\n* \"Nyaha Khubha\"\u2014Banian tree cave, according to General Cunningham. It seems that caves were often named after some tree growing near by e.g. Nyagrodha, the Banian tree; Pippali, the Pipal tree; Saptaparna, a septafid tree.\n21. Not far from here, about a mile or more by road, is another group of hills of the same material. Here there are three more caves which form the Nagarjuni group. The Gopi cave is very picturesquely situated some seventy feet above the plain. It is a large vaulted chamber, nearly fifty feet long. Both ends are circular. It is approached by a flight of stone stairs, but a small crenelated brick wall completely hides the door. Masses of granite boulders are fantastically piled up over the cave roof. I am sorry to say I did not obtain a photograph of this very picturesque spot owing to the failure of my apparatus\u2014it had been too much in the hands of coolies of late.\n\n22. The following list particularises the seven Magadha caves:\n\nThe Barabar caves. 1, 2 and 3 dedicated by Raja Piyadasa\u2014\n\n1. Sudama cave. [The Nyagrodha or Banian tree] 38 feet \u00d7 19; vaulted, 12\u00bd feet high. Inner domed chapel: 18 feet in diameter: two lines of inscription record its gift to mendicants. 251 B.C.\n\n2. Viswa-Jhopri. Vestibule 14 \u00d7 8\u00bd \u00d7 6\u00bd high. Inner circular chapel, irregular, 11 feet diameter at its widest. 251 B.C.\n\n3. Karna-chopar (on the north side of the rock), 33\u00bd feet \u00d7 14; vaulted, 10\u00bd feet high. Single room. 244 B.C.\n\n4. Lomas Rishi cave. The same dimension as the Sudama cave; unfinished ceiling and floor, domed chapel unfinished. No Asoka inscription.\n\nThe Nagarjuni caves. Dedicated by Raja Dasaratha, a grandson of Asoka, in the year 218 B.C.\u2014\n\n5. Gopika (or milkmaid's cave). Single chamber 46 feet 5 inches \u00d7 19 feet 2 inches. Vaulted, 10 feet 6 inches high with circular ends.\n\n6. Vapiya cave. Vestibule 6 feet \u00d7 3 feet \u00d7 5\u00bd high, room 16\u00bd feet \u00d7 11\u00bd and 10\u00bd feet high, vaulted. So named from a well near by.\n\n7. Vadhatthika khubba. Is in a cleft of the Vapiya rock, west of the cave. It is a small chamber with a narrow entrance. Inside, a small brick partition has been built with a very narrow entrance.\n\n23. Completing the work at my Barabar camp, I return to Gaya, and an opportunity presenting, I took what spare plaster there was to Bodh Gaya, and took moulds of some objects of allied interest\u2014an inscription on the altar, its honeysuckle and goose ornament, a quadrant of the Vajrasan, or adamantine throne, and of a quadriga chariot of the sun on one of the pillars now in the Mahanth's house.\n\n24. I was also able to secure a photograph of the temple with a\ncharacteristic group of the Mahanth and his college of chelas in the foreground.\n\nPreparations for my return to Calcutta complete, I was just leaving Gaya, when a packet was placed in my hands requiring me to go into the Rajgir valley to bring away casts of the long, rambling inscription in the rocky roadway, in what Prinsep has called the \"shell\" character. I had a reserve cask of gypsum in Bankipore, which I sent on to Bihar. I stayed a day here to consult Mr. O'Donnell, the Magistrate and Collector of Patna, as to the space the inscription occupied, that I might not run short of material eventually. No one, however, seemed to have any idea of the extent of surface covered by the inscription by actual measurement.\n\n25. From Bankipur I traversed the ground between there and Patna. Dr. Waddell identifies this space with the ancient Pataliputra specifically, and I followed the sites consecutively as he details them. Some objects of note and interest lay on the way in modelling and sculpture. In clay there was an unique model of a hill. When Mahendra, the son of Asoka, was converted to Buddhism, during the intense reaction which took place about this period in the religious expression of the people, he sought the valley of Rajagriha for refuge, and the cave of Buddha on Gridhrak\u016b\u1e6da for meditation. To wean him back to Pataliputra, an artificial hill was built on this spot, and its ruin still retains the name of Bhiknapah\u0101ri (the mendicant's hill), the mohulla being called Mahendra. On Bhiknapah\u0101ri stood this clay model not so very long ago. Its purpose was evidently to supply the workmen with an idea of the hill as it should be made, and I determined while in the Rajgir valley to discover any resemblance which might exist between model and prototype. It has been an object of worship from time immemorial, and owes its preservation to perennial renewals.\n\nThere was some sculpture, too, a caryatid figure of Maha Maya with alto-relievo figures on either side, and a sculptured coping which I saw, belonging to the period of Asoka, and this is absolutely all that is left above ground of the stone-built palace of Asoka, or the court of Chandragupta (Sandracottos).\n\n26. A traveller has to take Rajgir from Bakhtiarpur, 28 miles nearer Calcutta than Bankipore. A mail coach here takes one 19 miles due south to Bihar, where there is an isolated hill of quartzite, once occupied by Buddhists. From here the Subdivisional Officer, Mr. Gupta, drove me down to Rajgir. The road strikes south-west. We left Bargaon at the 7th mile-stone, and turning due south rode through the large village of Silao (renowned for its sweet pastry); and the lesser one of Panditpur. Here the bar of hills enclosing the Rajgir valley, becomes\nmore distinct. Another mile (the fifteenth) and we were in the modern Rajgir. This too we pass, and through the ruined fort of old Rajgir, the capital of Magadha before Asoka's time. The walls and ramparts are still from 20 to 50 feet high. Here we halted at the inspection bungalow. Mounds of ruins lie between us and the valley, while right and left are level fields.\n\nAs we look southward into the valley, from either side of the emerging stream rise two hills. To the east is Vipula, to the west Baibh\u00e4r, while inside is the long valley of 42 miles which reaches from Giryak (14 miles due south from Bihar) to Gaya. The pass through this valley is the only traversed spot in its whole length.\n\nIn the Rajgir valley I found the inscription to straggle over a space of nearly 200 yards, and to consist of 35 patches, the large deep letters being cut into the floor of a sparry rock, which had been chiselled down to form a roadway 20 feet wide to the Bawanganga defile. The road led from the southern gate of old Rajagriha and the Nekpai embankment to the palace of Jarasandha near where the Bawanganga debouches over a rocky defile into the Panchanan river.\n\n27. The \"shell\" character is still a puzzle to philologists. Most likely it is a cypher for the initiated only, which was in vogue among dispersed Buddhists during the 7th and 8th centuries. General Cunningham, speaking of some of these characters found on a pillar at Rajaona, says as to their readability, \"I have already made some progress towards it.\" He did not know of the Rajgir inscriptions, and does not mention those in the Son Bhandar cave in this valley.\n\n28. My workmen were soon on this inscription, and made over eighty moulds without covering the whole inscribed surface. I made tracings of the rest, and having taken bearings and distances, so as to enable me to lay the inscriptions down relatively as they lie on the roadway, I had them packed for Calcutta.\n\n29. During the time I was here, I was able to visit the sites of chief interest in the valley.\n\nThe valley of Rajgir is all holy ground to the Buddhist.\n\nThe sacred feet of Buddha have trod all its paths, his presence has hallowed all its caves, and his touch made holy all its streams. Nor to the Buddhist alone is this holy ground. The Jain is everywhere where the Buddhist has been, and his symbols and tirthankaras occupy all the high places of the Buddhist. To the ordinary Hindu, too, a place sacred to one sect is sacred to him also. The Buddhist pillars of Asoka enter into the Pantheon of the Hindus of each locality as their Phallic emblem. Images of Buddha, and Chaityas from his ruined temples, are everywhere to be found enshrined in groves and holy places. Buddha\nhimself is absolutely unknown, but his image is worshipped variously; indeed, in one locality, the site of the Nalanda monastery, his image is worshipped as Rukmini. Elsewhere a traditional worship has come down, and I have seen his statue garlanded and milk poured over its mouth\u2014vermeil and redlead touching up every prominent feature, as it also does with every other object they hold sacred.\n\n30. The objects of interest in the Rajgir valley, besides the shell inscriptions, are:\n\n1st.\u2014The hot springs; where Brahmans have prepared bathing places and built small temples, which make a very picturesque group at the entrance of the valley.\n\n2nd.\u2014The basement known as Jarasandha ka baithak, immediately above these temples.\n\n3rd.\u2014The Pipolo cave; where Buddha used to sit in deep meditation, after his midday meal. Originally it was a pit from which stone was quarried for the basements.\n\n4th.\u2014The Great Northern Caves.\n\n5th.\u2014A ruined temple of Mahadeo.\n\n6th.\u2014The Son Bhandar cave.\n\n7th.\u2014The cyclopean walls and platforms and the Nekpai embankment.\n\n8th.\u2014The causeway to Sailagiri, with the two stairs leading one to Ananda's cave and the other to Buddha's.\n\n9th.\u2014The caves in the Sailagiri rocky eminence,\u2014called Gridharkuta.\n\n31. Ascending the Baibhar hill we pass several basements and the remains of two stupas. Continuing, we pass three Jain temples and come to a fourth. Here, descending a mountain path, a few yards, we come to another basement, and crossing on to a natural platform, just north of this temple, we are immediately in front of the Great Northern Caves. These caverns pierce the hill horizontally for a depth of fifty feet and more, leading into cross-galleries running at right angles to them for thirty or forty feet. Many of the minor recesses near this may be taken as caves. It is a mile from the Pipolo cave, in the northern shadow of Baibhar; consequently it answers the precise description given of the Saptaparna cave by the Chinese traveller Fa Hian, so far as position is concerned. Of the tremendous labour with which it was converted into an assembly hall for the 1st Buddhist synod, where 500 Arhats met to discuss the future of Buddhism, there is no trace. The stairs, if any, have long since disappeared; of embellishment there is none. A small paved space exists at the entrance of the principal cave, but this may have been made at any time.\n32. Returning to the temple and descending the hill a few yards on the opposite side, we find the ruins of an old temple of Mahadeo, where two lingas have at one time each claimed devotion from the worshippers. A few pillars are still standing, not very perpendicular, but nothing of the original exterior remains.\n\n33. Returning to the foot of the hill, and following its base near the stream which skirts it, a little less than a mile brings us to the Son Bhandar cave\u2014the treasury of gold. This is an artificial chamber, 34 feet by 17 nearly, with an arched ceiling of $11\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The polishing of the interior may not compare with that of the Barabar caves, but still it is noteworthy. Outside the cave there is a level space which gradually merges into the plain. At one time the cave was embellished, and stucco still adheres to the ceiling. A window lights up the cave at the end, away from the door. Outside and inside there are and have been inscriptions dating from the remotest antiquity. Some are readable, others barely so. A very interesting Pali inscription is lost from over the door. Three or four letters remain of it. Of the shell character, too, there are two or three examples.\n\nThe chief interest attaching to this cave is its supposed identity with the Saptaparna. The meaning of this word is seven-leaved. Not very far outside is to be found a septafid tree\u2014the bombax Malabari-cum\u2014or common simal tree, whose bloom throws a crimson note into the March landscape everywhere in India. The leaves group in seven from a common centre, and the term would scarcely apply to a row of seven, as has been proposed for what I believe is the great northern cave. The name Nyagrodha, too, has been applied to this cave, as it is to one of the Barabar ones which especially was a sanctuary; Nyagrodha meaning the banian tree. But the Son Bhandar cave has outside, a few feet above the door, a series of mortice holes, which must at one time have supported a roof covering a portion of the space in front of the two caves. There are also stairs cut in the rock leading up to a seat midway between this cave and its companion.*\n\nThis cut stair, the several mortice holes, and sundry other chiselings on the rock-face having a constructive purpose; the general embellishment of the cave, and its expensive polishing, could only have been done by royal command. Its correspondence with the Burmese account of the locale of the synod, as translated by Bishop Bigandet, throw much evidence into its favour as the Saptaparna.\n\n34. Another cave, too, claims this distinction\u2014the Pipolo cave at\n\n* Originally there were two caves of almost similar dimensions; the one to the right has been blasted down by treasure-seekers, the name of the cave being taken too literally.\nthe foot of the Baibh\u0101r hill. It is near the Asura's house (Jarasandha ka baithak). Ceylonese authorities claim it as being the cave which corresponds most to the description in the Mahavanso.\n\nThe authority mostly in favour of the Son Bhandar being the Saplaparna is General Cunningham, while Mr. Beglar claims this distinction for a cave I have been unable to discover or identify on the north of Baibh\u0101r, except it be for the series of the great northern caves I have mentioned. Mr. Fergusson has accepted Mr. Beglar's idea, without being certified as to the existence of the cave described by him.\n\n35. Great interest in the ruins of the ancient city of Rajagriha attaches itself to the almost cyclopean walls, embankments, and highways which endure to the present. The highway leads over the embankments and city walls to the crest of the hills forming ramparts which an invading army of old would have found a complete obstruction. One wonders who would seek this barren waste, whose stony ground produces nothing but thorn and scrub bamboo, where trees occur at great distances apart and are all stunted. Yet at one time we hear of these embankments, to which a miraculous origin is ascribed, converting the country into a smiling garden and the city into a famine-proof granary.\n\n36. We hear, too, of King Bimbisara and his chariot\u2014how he had a highway built up the side of Chatagiri to the rocks of Sailagiri, and how he went in state to hear the words that Buddha had to say for the comfort of humanity; for among these rocks which overhang so and threaten the timid, there are crevices and caves which were holiest places to the successive bands of Buddhists who have sought refuge here, where the great teacher lived and taught. From these rocks, right up to the very crest of Sailagiri, were built stupas and viharas which were made waste and laid low, when a newer religious fervour directed its hate towards Buddhism,\u2014in its turn to be forgotten for many a century past.\n\n37. I traversed this highway several times\u2014noted the stupa built right in the road, which marks where King Bimbisara dismounted from his chariot, and where again, on arriving at the upper flat in front of the caves, another stupa records his sending back of the crowd, if we take Fa Hian's account to guide us. Here, crossing over the boulders lying in the now dry bed of the mountain torrent, I was able to again follow up the old road, which leads to the two principal caves by a direct stair to each, and which I was only able to discover after having the jungle cleared for two or three days. Some six or seven caves, none of any size, exist here. The rocks having naturally fallen into their present position, which I should say is barely different from what it was\ntwenty-five centuries ago, and which have not been touched by the chisel for any purpose whatsoever, in vain I sought some stone-cut record of the past. Statues shattered and mutilated of the Buddha I found here, but nothing more. There were bricks all over the place; a stucco rosette in one of the caves shows that it had been plastered and embellished. Here, too, is the great stone fronting the cave Ananda occupied, whereon the Vulture Mara sat and with outspread wings terrified his soul, and there is the kindly crevice through which the comforting hand of Buddha came and rested on his shoulder, divesting him of fear. The very spot where I placed my not irreverent camera to record the present condition of the cave is where the vulture sat who gave the name Gridhrak\u016bta to this group of caves.\n\n38. Here it was that Mahendra, more than two centuries later, sought refuge in Buddha, and the small clay hill I saw at Mahendra near Patna, is a model of this hill. The centuries between, and its perennial renewings, have altered its outline in detail only. The slanting highway reaching from the foot of the hill to the cave level opposite has been worn down to almost a level road at its water-course end, where one would naturally imagine the approach to be eminently difficult. The caves, too, are rightly placed behind the wall of rocks, the mud representing which seems here to have been piled higher as the road wore down. So there is an unmistakeable similarity, although the likeness may not be at first sight obvious.\n\n39. I returned to Calcutta in the middle of February, and after seeing all my moulds stored away in the Museum, I took up my southern tour.\n\n40. There remained to do\u2014\n\n1st, the Asoka inscription at Jaugada in the Madras Presidency;\n2nd, a rescript of the same edicts at Dhauli;\n3rd, the singular record of self-laudation by the Aira Raja over the cave entrance in Udaigiri; and\n4thly, a number of small dedicatory tablets from various caves of the Udaigiri and Khandagiri group.\n\n41. I booked by the Calna for Gopalpur, a seacoast town of the Madras Presidency, about 350 miles from Calcutta. It is the port of the Ganjam district; it is also the summer resort. Berhampur is the sadar station. Ganjam is but a small station, I was at Gopalpur in the first week of March, and immediately made for Jaugada by way of Berhampur. The nearest post-town to Jaugada is Purushottapur, just the other side of the Bishikulia river, and the nearest village to the fort is Pandya; the whole journey from Gopalpur being about 41 miles. The assistant tahsildar was of great help to me at Jaugada. While the\nplaster was preparing, I availed myself of an invitation from Mr. Minchin at Aska. (Mr. Minchin, I may note, is the gentleman who has identified himself with the manufacturing industry of the country, to whose enterprise is due the prosperity of the present sugarcane cultivators.) I was in some hope of seeing a photograph of the Jaugada inscription when it was intact in 1857. Mr. Minchin took the negatives home with him, and left them at the India Office at the request of the Madras Government. Nothing has since been heard of them. He was, however, instrumental in drawing the attention of Government to its possible defacement from the chipping off of the rock-surface.\n\nI was not, however, to see them, as Mr. Minchin was disappointed to find he had not a copy left.\n\n42. All that remains of the ancient fort of Jaugada is an immense enclosure within a moat and a running mound, 15 to 20 feet high, which is entered at several openings where gates have been.\n\nWithin this square enclosure two or three piles of granite rocks are most picturesquely grouped, and west of the glen, where the principal structures have been, indications of which still exist, an immense rock rises up with a circular outline, on the perpendicular face of which Asoka's edicts have been engraved. There are two sets of edicts; the left-hand tablet bearing the edicts common to the Girnar, Shahbazgiri, and Khalsi rocks, and the right-hand ones, enclosed within a line border, bearing symbols at the corners\u2014local edicts addressed to the officers governing the state of Sam\u0101p\u0101\u2014a name unidentified in the ancient geography of India. Most probably Sam\u0101p\u0101 was a city on the banks of the Rishikulya close by. Magnificent banian trees have avenueed the road along the riverside, a remnant few of which are still to be seen. The inscription was first brought to notice by Sir W. Elliott, when it was more perfect. An attempt to make an impression of it has destroyed the larger part of the inscription since. There used to be a double-storied house close to this rock occupied by a jogi, obscuring the view of the edicts, when earlier sets of photographs of the inscription were taken. It has since been demolished.\n\n43. On my completing this work I came through Rambha, at the southern extremity of the Chilka lake and 28 miles from Jaugada, whence I had the pleasant experience of sailing across the Chilka lake in a country-boat with a great mat sail. Old Buddhist traditions cling to the water-borne population here. Boats still carry on their prows Buddhist emblems whose purpose or meaning is absolutely forgotten.\n\n44. Coming into Orissa I proceeded to Khurda, where Mr. McPherson very kindly made me his guest, and arranged for my travelling and camp at both Khandagiri and Dhauli; the whole distance from\nRambha including the boat journey being 83 miles. A considerable time was taken up in the preparing of plaster. This gave me some leisure to examine the caves and to select my sites for photographing them.\n\n45. Khandagiri and Udaigiri are the two hills formed of the sandstone outcrop in Orissa, some 19 miles south of Cuttack and 14 miles east of Khurda.\n\n46. The perpendicular bluffs have been cut into for all the caves. Natural caverns, where the sandstone forms the arched roof of a cave, are frequent. The Hathigumpha is the largest of them. The upper story of the R\u0101ni Naur Palace cave is a similar arch, for the support of which the pillars placed there recently are quite unnecessary. The sandstone bluffs are in three distinct levels of elevation.\n\n47. Lowest level.\u2014In the lowest level are the caves facing south, and seen enface from the bungalow\u2014the Alakapura-jayavijaya and Sucargapura (in the second story). An effaced Pali inscription near the elephant frieze (the largest elephant sculpture in these hills) witnesses to its age, while the huge male elephants approaching the arch on either side (they are four-tusked and are tended by female elephants) show the importance of this cave.\n\nThe lower story of the R\u0101ni Naur Palace cave is on the west of this bluff, and to the east, a row of small caves with a stair leads up to the second bluff.\n\nSecond level.\u2014In this to the west is the upper story of the Queen's palace; on the east there is the Vaikuntha group. The roof of this group and of the R\u0101ni Naur form the upper terrace of this bluff.\n\nThird level.\u2014North-east of the Queen's palace cave, in the third bluff, we have the Ganesa cave, so called from a figure of Ganesa carved in its inner chamber, near which there is a Sanskrit inscription. The south-west face of the bluff has in its basement the Hathigumpha, above which several caves lead up to the platform forming the flat top of Udaigiri hill. The south-east corner of the bluff is broken into a number of detached rocks which are severally excavated into the Snake, the Tiger, and other caves which mendicant Buddhists have occupied.\n\n48. Aira Raja occupied the caves of the Vaikuntha group. Inscriptions, fragmentary unfortunately, describe him as a disciple of Kadipa, a worshipper of the sun, a mighty Raja (of Kalinga) whose elephant is as a thundercloud. In illustration whereof there is the adoration of the Sun and Triratna by a series of academical figures, which may relate to Kadipa's college of disciples,\u2014heavenly musicians fill the air, while a grandly-proportioned elephant closes the procession. This neglected piece of sculpture is very nearly obliterated. The half\non the other side is quite gone; of what remains I have brought a cast to Calcutta.\n\n49. The Hathigumpha in all probability was the Pilkhana or elephant-house. But from its prominent character the rounded brow of the cave has been selected for the laudatory inscription, in Asoka characters, which gives it its importance.\n\n50. Considering the nature of the sandstone\u2014gritty, friable stuff that it is\u2014it is fortunate not to have come under the weathering influences which have obliterated larger-featured sculptures.\n\n51. Most of the dedicatory tablets are obscure and of no importance, save for their ancient character. One\u2014that on the Tiger cave\u2014points to a period when there was a change in religious opinion, and some intolerance prevailed. The Tiger cave is labelled as the chamber of a fierce anti-Vedist.\n\n52. Between the two hills a road now runs where jungle filled the glen, and the stair leading to the cave level of Khandagiri gives access to caves unknown when Fergusson visited the place. Here, on the level of the highest bluff of Udaigiri, is the Ananta cave, opening to the north. Of the Asoka inscription which once described it, little is now discernible.\n\nMr. Fergusson has attached some importance to this cave, for besides the description of it by Dr. Mitter, and the photographs of the sculptures by Mr. Locke, he had the Commissioner of Orissa ask Mr. Phillips to visit the cave before he was satisfied that all particulars had reached him.\n\nAt page 72 of his book on the \"Rock-cut Temples of India,\" under the joint-authorship of Mr. Burgess, he says, referring to the four sculptured tympana inside the arches, two of which are perfect:\u2014\"From our knowledge of the sculpture of Barhut, we may safely predicate that in addition to the Tree and image of Sri, the two remaining tympana were filled, one with a representation of a wheel, and the other of a dagoba, the last three being practically the three great objects of worship both here and at Sanchi.\" What I have written in my fuller report, before I saw Mr. Fergusson's book, is to this purpose.\n\n53. The Ananta cave has been an important place of worship; Within its inner chamber is a sketch-relief of what has been supposed to be a preaching Buddha. This figure has been accepted by Dr. Mitter and others as a Buddha\u2014probably it is a Tirthankara made at a later period; above his head are a row of emblems,\u2014the trisul flanked by a shield on either side, and these again each by a tree emblem and then the swastika.\n\nThis cave, already described by Fergusson, Dr. Mitter and others\nhad not yet been exhausted of its treasures. The Museum is enriched with casts from two of its four tympana. The worship of the railed Bodhi tree and of the auspicious Sri account for two. The grime of centuries has concealed the religious significance of the two fractured tympana.\n\nThe fourth or left-hand sculpture represents the better half of a composition dealing with the apotheosis of the four-tusked elephant. (It will be remembered that when Buddha was lord of a herd of 1,000 elephants, he carried four tusks, according to a birth story figured in one of the Bharhut sculptures.) The artist here has tried within a limited bas-relief to give every detail of the vast bulk of the lordliest of elephants. The Sun is in attendance, and two female elephants on each side offer their lord a lotus-worship. Much of the right-half with one female elephant is lost.\n\nThe tympanum between this and Sri shows the quadriga of the Sun enface. Aruna is surrounded by the heavenly host. The Moon is there in her first quarter, and Rahu, too, is largely present. Female attendants minister to Aruna. The left-half of the sculpture is partly lost.\n\n54. I am glad to say I have secured casts of these two sculptures.\n\n55. On this Khandagiri hill are other Buddhist caves, some with ancient Pali inscriptions. But the Jains have mostly made it their resort. In these caves, or the remains of them, their numerous Tirthankaras with their Saktis look down from the high position which they occupy on the eastern hillside, while the top of the hill is crowned with a double temple, which was restored during the Mahratta irruption into Orissa.\n\n56. While the work at Khandagiri was completing, I went on to Dhauli.\n\nIn the fork where a tributary enters the Dyah river lies an ancient tank\u2014the famous Kosali-ganga, regarding the excavation of which interesting legends exist. Probably it is one of those enormous tanks Buddhists have dug wherever they have made a home for themselves. Now much of it is filled up and given over to cultivation. To the west of this tank is an obtruded group of granite rocks, forming the isolated Dhauli hill. This hill throws out a spur which reaches the tank, and which, with the northern end of the hill, makes a basin-like valley between, with the Kosali-ganga in front of it.\n\nNot far from the dry tank a block of granite flanks the spur, and, on entering the valley at this point, an elephant seems to approach one from out of the domed top of the rock, out of whose solid mass it has been excavated. This is the upper half of the Aswastama rock; the lower\nnorth face, which has been polished, bears the inscription of Asoka's edicts.\n\nThe local edicts here are identical with those at Jaugada, the city named being Tosali. This is considered the same as Dosara, on the Dosaron river.\n\n57. Between Dhauli and Khandagiri I had twice to pass through Bhuvaneswar. I could not help noticing the extreme beauty of some of these ancient temples. Artistic surprises met one everywhere. Naturally, one wonders when he meets grouped together in this remote corner of India, objects of artistic or religious significance peculiar to Rome and Greece, Phoenicia and Egypt. Ganesa has fruit offerings placed before him on a Delphic tripod; long gaunt figures adorn the great temple, which might have been studied on Cleopatra's Needle; children drawn with a grace, and figured with a freedom which Albani might have envied; statuettes and figures, grouped and singly, which disclose a grace one would hardly associate with Indian sculpture\u2014all the work of the past!\n\n58. Besides the great temple I would name as deserving protective care\u2014\n\nthe Mukle\u015bvara and Parasur\u0101me\u015bvara,\nthe Brahmane\u015bvara and Bh\u0101skare\u015bvara,\nthe Baital Deul and the Raj-R\u0101ni temples.\n\nEach of these has structural and archaeological peculiarities of its own. The first three in this list have been the models for the hundreds of temples which have made Bhuvaneswar peculiarly the city of temples.\n\nI returned to Calcutta through Cuttack and via Chandbally, arriving here on the 4th of June.\n\nA cordial vote of thanks was proposed by Dr. G. A. Grierson to the Government of Bengal for the interest taken in the matter of Asoka Inscriptions in India, which was carried by acclamation.\n\nThe Philological Secretary circulated the following table of comparison of selected words and numerals in several Assam languages forwarded by Mr. S. E. Peal of Sibsagar.\nComparison of some Words in \"NG\" soft, as in \"SINGER,\"\n\n| Pronoun | THOU | BIRD | BLACK |\n|---------|------|------|-------|\n| Tibetan, written | ... | ... | NAK |\n| Tibetan, spoken | NGA | KHYOD | B'YU | NAG |\n| Burmese | NGA | NENG | GNHET |\n| Singpho | NGAI | NANG | WU | CHANG |\n| Kanung | ... | ... | ... |\n| Kamti | KAU | MAU | NOK | NAM |\n| Mishmi | ... | ... | ... |\n| Miri SHAYANG | NGA | NA | PTANG | YAKa |\n| Abor | NGA | NA | PTANG | YAKa |\n| Bhotia LHO | NGA | CHYA | NAG |\n| Chang lo | NGA and JANG | NAN | KHA | CHANG |\n| Kachari Bodo | ANG | NANG | D'AU | ga SAM |\n| Garo | iNGA | NA | D'AO | pe NEK |\n| Hill Tippera | ... | ... | ... |\n| Khasia | NGA | ME PHA | SIM | i' ONG |\n| Kuki | ... | ... | WHA | NIK |\n| Kumi | KAI | NAN | WA | WO |\n| Kyaw | KIMA | NAMA | WA |\n| Angami | A | NO | P'RA | KATI |\n| Manipuri | AINA | NANG | UCHEK | AMUBA |\nnot hard, as in \"ANGER.\"\n\n| EAR | EYE | FISH | PIG | ROAD | WATER |\n|-----|-----|------|-----|------|-------|\n| MIK | GNA | PHAK | CHU |\n| NA  | MYET| NGA  | WET | LAM  | YE    |\n| NA  | MI  | NGA  | WA  | LAM  | N'SIN |\n| a NA| NE or ME | NA chi | PARA | WANG |\n| HU  | TA  | PA   | MU  | TANG | NAM   |\n| YERUNG | MIK | e NGA | EYEG | LAM | a CHYE |\n| NA rung | MIK | e NGO | NGA | EYEG | LAMBE | a SI |\n| NA moh | MIG.

Peach had been cancelled at the request of that gentleman who intimated that he would be shortly leaving India, and did not expect to return.\n\nThe Secretary read a circular from the Royal Society of New South Wales, enumerating prizes to be given for original researches on certain subjects connected with Australia. This can be seen in the Society's office.\n\nMr. C. Little moved that the Society should be registered under Act XXI of 1860.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Rough notes on the Grammar of the Language spoken in the Western P\u0101njab.\u2014By Trevor Bomford, C.M.S., Multan.\n\nCommunicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn laying them on the table, the Honorary Philological Secretary, said, I wish to draw special attention to these notes, as one of the most important contributions to our knowledge of the Indo-Aryan Vernaculars, which has appeared during the past decade. Its importance lies not only in the value of the grammar, as illustrating an imperfectly known language, but as supplying a missing link which completes a chain of evidence materially affecting the hitherto accepted theories regarding the classification of the modern Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nThe points of similarity which exists between the K\u0101\u00e7miri and Sindhi languages has been noted incidentally by Dr. B\u00fchler, and by the present speaker, but it has not been easy to explain satisfactorily the evident relationship which exists between them, for till Mr. Bomford's Rough Notes were received, the territories in which these two languages were spoken were believed to be separated by many hundred miles of country, inhabited by a population speaking a totally different language\u2014P\u0101nj\u0101bi. There was no historical or territorial connexion between these two widely separated, but closely connected, languages.\n\nMr. Bomford's Rough Notes have changed all this. We have hitherto known a so-called dialect of P\u0101nj\u0101bi called Mult\u0101ni, which has been well illustrated by the late Mr. O'Brien's Mult\u0101ni Vocabulary. This has hitherto been localized in the south of the P\u0101nj\u0101b, round Mult\u0101n, in the districts bordering on Sindh, and, as it bore many close points of resemblance to Sindhi, it was assumed, on the information then available, to be a sort of border dialect, through which Sindhi merged into\nPa\u00f1j\u0101bi. Mr. Bomford now shows that what has hitherto been called Mult\u0101ni, from the place where it was first observed, is not a border language between Sindhi and Pa\u00f1j\u0101bi at all. It is the language of the Pa\u00f1j\u0101b, west of, roughly speaking, the Jhelum, till it meets the Pashtu spoken west of the Indus. Pa\u00f1j\u0101bi has hitherto been measured by the standard of Amritsar, a town some forty miles East of Lahore, midway between the R\u0101vi and the Satlaj, and our grammars, dictionaries, and literature have been based entirely on the language of the East of the Pa\u00f1j\u0101b. The Grammars stated, and it was known as a general fact, that the language of the Western Pa\u00f1j\u0101b differed from that of the East, but few attempts, till Mr. Bomford undertook the task, were made to investigate the points of difference, and it was too readily assumed that Pa\u00f1j\u0101bi had two dialects,\u2014a Standard and a Western. Mr. Bomford's grammar shows that this is not true. That Western Pa\u00f1j\u0101bi can in no sense be called a dialect of standard Pa\u00f1j\u0101bi, but is altogether a distinct language closely connected with, and forming the connecting link between Sindhi and K\u0101\u00e7miri.\n\nThese three languages, Sindhi, Western Pa\u00f1j\u0101bi, and K\u0101\u00e7miri, can now be classed as forming a North-Western Family of Indo-Aryan Vernaculars, markedly differing from what has hitherto been called the Western, but must now be called the Central Family, and having curiously intimate relations with the Eastern language of Assam and with the Aryan languages spoken in the provinces of Bengal, Bih\u0101r and Orissa.\n\nThis interesting fact opens out wide ethnological questions, on which I am now engaged, and I hope, at an early date, to be able to place the result of my researches before the Society.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2.

Susuni\u0101 Rock Inscription of Candra-varman.\u2014By N\u0101g\u0113ndran\u0101tha Vasu.\n\nThis inscription has been found on the Susuni\u0101 hill, in the district of B\u0101nkur\u0101, 12 miles to the north-west from the head-quarters and 17 miles south-south-west from the R\u0101niga\u00f1j Station of the East India Railway. Passengers travelling by that Railway past the stations of Durg\u0101pur, Ondal and R\u0101niga\u00f1j, see the hill with its two peaks towards the south-south-west verge of the horizon, like the head and back of a huge elephant facing the west. The whole hill from the\nbase to the highest summit is covered with a dense jungle of various forest trees, some of which may produce good timber; but the hill being subject to the usual annual burning, the trees suffer much from the fire, and are little used except for fuel and for the framework of the thatched houses.\n\nThis hill together with Bih\u0101ri-n\u0101th, Pachette and several other hills, forms the eastern outskirt of the Vindhya ranges, the Susuni\u0101 hill being the easternmost extremity. The whole hill is formed of a fine kind of sandstone which is especially valued for paving purposes, known in the trade as Burdwan paving stones. A few years ago its quarries brought a considerable sum to its proprietors, but during recent years stones of a superior quality having been dug at a place near the B. N. Railway the Susuni\u0101 stone trade has greatly fallen off.\n\nA branch of the Ahaly\u0101 B\u0101i\u2019s Road passes by the western side of the hill from Chatn\u0101 to R\u0101niga\u00f1j. At a little distance to the east from the road and at the south-western base of the hill, there is a perennial spring called Dh\u0101r\u0101 and some ancient sculptures, the principal one being that of Narasimha (an incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u). An annual fair is held there on the V\u0101runi festival, on the 13th day of the dark fortnight of the month of Caitra. But the chief object of interest to which I endeavour to draw the attention of the meeting is the Inscription on the hill, which though so near to the metropolis and to a first class Railway Station, has not received the notice it deserves from any of our former worthy antiquarians. I here give a brief account of it, which, though insufficient, will, I hope, give an idea as to the nature and contents of the inscription.\n\nI was first informed of it last January, by my friend B\u0101b\u016b G\u014dpi N\u0101th Karmak\u0101r, who told me that there was an inscription on the north-east side of the Susuni\u0101 hill, which the people of that locality regarded as the work of the D\u0113vas, written in three lines in three different D\u0113v\u0101k\u1e63aras, i.e., characters of the D\u0113vas. They also believed it to have existed there from time immemorial, and that none can read it, and that, if perchance some s\u0101dhu (sage) did come and read it, he would not disclose its contents to the people in general, who are deemed unprivileged to hear its sacred teachings. I at once concluded that this must be some ancient inscription, and requested my friend to send me an impression of it. Accordingly he went to that place, but being unable to procure an impression of the inscription, which he reported to be too large for his materials then at hand, he sent me the annexed hand-copy, with a brief description of the locality, nature of the inscription, &c., promising, however, to procure a faithful impression in ink when required. Trusting to get it shortly I have ventured to make the copy and my reading of it, the subject of my present paper.\nThe spot, where the inscription is situated, is on the north-eastern side of the hill nearly half way to the summit, above a perennial mountain-spring which among the people of the locality goes by the name of Yamadh\u0101r\u0101 or Damdh\u0101r\u0101, in order to distinguish it from the more important spring Dh\u0101r\u0101 to the south-west extremity, which has been already mentioned. The place commands the view of a tract of land towards the north as far as R\u0101nig\u0101j\u012b, spotted with innumerable villages, ponds, gardens, cornfields, jungles, &c. Tradition runs, that this place was the grotto of Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101ksa \u1e5a\u1e63i, who lived there in ancient times. Some also believe that even now he lives invisible in the mountain, and others say that some fortunate villager sometimes descries him as an old man with a long white beard and grey hair, roving early in the morning over the hill bright as the sun, singing angelic songs, but vanishing at the approach of man.\n\nThe inscription is on the vertical side of a cliff facing the west. The surface is smooth and there are no fissures visible. The inscription is written in three lines, with a symbolic ornamented circle at the top. Almost the whole is in an excellent state of preservation. The letters are cut deep and clearly by the hand of a skilful engraver. The average size is nearly 4.\" The characters belong to the class which Dr. Fleet calls 'the North Indian Alphabet of the 4th century A.D.' All the letters closely resemble those of the 'Meharauli Posthumous Iron Pillar Inscription of Candra,' first brought to notice in our Society's Journal in 1834, and subsequently published in other numbers, and lately by Dr. Fleet in his Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol. III, plate XXI A.\n\nIn respect of orthography the only points deserving of notice, are the doubling of k followed by r, as in line 1 in Cakka-sv\u0101minah, and the doubling of m preceded by r, as in line 2, in pat\u0113r mmah\u0101r\u0101ja. The language is Sanskrit and the version prose.\n\nThe circle at the top with its adjuncts represents, I think, the bright discus (cakra) of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, whose name as Cakra-str\u0101min appears at the commencement of the inscription.\n\nRegarding the posthumous inscription of Candra in the Meharauli pillar, Dr. Fleet says:\u2014\n\n'My own impression at first on independent grounds, was to allot it to Candra-gupta I., the first Mah\u0101rajadhir\u0101ja of the family, of whose time we have as yet no inscription, and I should not be surprised to find any time that it proved to belong to him. The only objection that I can see, is that it contains no reference to the Indo-Scythians, by overthrowing whom the early Guptas must have established themselves.' (Fleet's Corp. Ins. Ind. III, p. 140 n.).\nBut it appears to me that the Candra of the Meharauli pillar, is no other than the Candra-varman of the present inscription. This conjecture is supported by the fact, that Candra of the Meharauli inscription was a Vaishnava (worshipper of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) who had erected a dhvaja or standard of the god Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the inscription states, and that he had carried on war with the kings of Vanga (Bengal), and, crossing the seven mouths of the Sindhu (Indus), had conquered the V\u0101hlikas of Bactria or Balkh. Now in order to fight with the Kings of Vanga, probably he had to pass over the region in which stands Susuni\u0101 hill, and it may be surmised that like the dhraja-erection, he symbolized the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-cakra on the Susuni\u0101 hill, and left the inscription to commemorate it.\n\nIn the Allahabad posthumous pillar inscription of Samudra-gupta, he is said to have defeated Candra-varman, a powerful king of the North India. This again leads us to imagine that Candra-varman, son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Siddha-varman, styled as the Lord of the Pu\u1e63kara lake (in Ajmer), of the present inscription reigned as a powerful king, and at one time waged a furious war throughout the whole of Northern India, from Bengal in the east to the Punjab in the west, and at last was defeated by Samudra-gupta.\n\nTranscription.\n\n1. \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u0903 \u0926\u093e\u0938\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0923\u093e\u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0924\u0903\u0964\n2. \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u0927\u093f \u092a\u0924\u0947\u0930 \u092e\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e-\u091a\u094d\u0930\u0940-\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0935\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0928\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0964\n3. \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e-\u091a\u094d\u0930\u0940-\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0928\u0903 \u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0903\u0964\n\nEnglish Transliteration.\n\n1.

Ranking.\n\nThe following gentleman has expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society.\n\nDr. O. C. Raye.\n\nThe Natural History Secretary read obituary notices of the deaths of Monsieur Louis Pasteur and Prof. T. H. Huxley.\n\nLouis Pasteur was born in 1822 at D\u00f4le, in the Jura. His education commenced at the Communal College at Arbois, and he passed into the \u00c9cole Normale in 1843. Here he studied chemistry under Balard, and at the Sorbonne under Dumas, showing remarkable application. It was in the \u00c9cole Normale, under Delafosse, that he commenced that study of molecular physics, which led up to his first important work, the investigation on the isomeric crystals of the tartrates and paratartrates of soda and ammonia. This work was interrupted by his appointment as Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at Lille; here the chief industry of the town was the manufacture of alcohol, and Pasteur, desiring to improve it by scientific methods, took up the study of fermentation. The change of subject was not so great as it seems, for in his study of the tartaric salts he had observed cases in which fermentation had seemed due to the presence of a living organism. Now, combining chemistry and microscopy as they had hardly ever been combined before, he succeeded in proving that fermentation generally is due to the action of organisms living in the fermenting substance. More, he showed that each method of fermentation, vinous, putrefactive, or otherwise, was due to a specific micro-organism appropriate to that method. Most important of all, Pasteur's investigations shewed that each species of ferment may be isolated and cultivated separately, and in certain instances be so modified by cultivation as to exert but relatively slight influence on substances which it would naturally strongly affect. The most direct applications of these results were, naturally, made in the manufacture of wine and vinegar and later on of beer, the so-called diseases of which, being traced to the disturbing influences of other micro-organisms mingled with those of the true alcoholic ferment, pure yeast, could now be prevented, for instance by the heating process known specially as Pasteurization. Hence accrued a great gain to the wine and beer industries; but the utility of the proof that\nfermentations, including the putrefactive, are directly due to microorganisms, soon received a more important demonstration. The study of the diseases of fermented liquids led straightway to the practice of antiseptic surgery, now so universally applied. Very few years later the whole subject of the complete exclusion of micro-organisms was exhaustively studied by Sir Joseph Lister, and afterwards by others, to the end of the saving of thousands of lives, and the rendering possible of many operations which before could hardly be attempted. Pasteur would have proceeded to carry out in relation to diseases the great general principle that he had established, but now he was forced to change somewhat the nature of his inquiry, being urged in 1865 by Dumas to undertake the investigation of a disease of silkworms in the south of France, which was seriously threatening the silk industry. The existence of \"corpuscles\" in the diseased insects and eggs had already been reported, and Pasteur, while making a careful investigation of the whole disease, directed his chief studies to these. He found that these disease-germs were passed on in the eggs, and invented a plan of testing for disease in the breeding moths, which, being practically followed, has proved effectual in putting a stop to the plague. After four years spent in investigating this subject, Pasteur had a dangerous paralytic stroke, in consequence of which, and of the miseries of the Franco-German war, which shortly followed, he was debarred for some time from any original work. On the end of the war he first betook himself to a study of the diseases of beer on the same lines as he had adopted in his previous researches on those of wines, and then devoted himself to that field of research in which he has won his greatest fame\u2014the study of those diseases of animals which might be supposed to originate from virus generated by various micro-organisms. Davaine had acquired evidence of the dependence of anthrax on the presence of organisms in the blood of infected animals, but his work was not well received till Pasteur proved its correctness, and then still further extended his researches. Most important of all, besides ascertaining the appropriate micro-organisms of several diseases, he found various means of cultivating these germs; these he separated, multiplied, and tested their influences under various conditions of environment, or after changes had been induced in themselves. Most fruitful was the discovery thus made of the possibility of attenuating, or mitigating gradually, by various culture-processes, the virulence of morbid bacteria till they can without harm be introduced into the blood of an animal which under normal conditions would rapidly succumb to their effects. And it was shown that some of these inoculations had the same effect as vaccination, giving the disease in a milder form and along with it protection against a severer attack.\nThe principle was first tested practically with fowl-cholera, and then with swine-erysipelas; but Pasteur has also applied it to anthrax, and as all are well aware, to rabies. So far-reaching is it that the debt of humanity to Pasteur becomes immense, even should the efficacy of inoculation treatment yet be considered doubtful in certain cases. But the great bacteriologist's own researches have been cut short, though he has been more fortunate than many in living to see them bear such ample fruit. Though since his paralysis he had enjoyed fairly good health, in 1887, he developed symptoms of heart and kidney disease, and four years ago he had influenza, resulting in yet further weakness. Last winter work was impossible for him, and though he went for the present summer to Garches, near St. Cloud, still with an eye to his labours, in the early part of September he himself appears to have been conscious of his approaching end, and on September 28th that end came.\n\nOf his numerous honours we need only speak here of those our own countrymen have bestowed upon him. In 1856, he received the Rumford Medal from the Royal Society of London, for his researches on the polarisation of light, and in 1869 he was made a foreign member of the Society, receiving in 1874 the Copley Medal, which was awarded to Huxley in 1888. We may congratulate ourselves, as members of the Royal Asiatic Society, on having elected the founder of bacteriology as an Honorary Member of our body during the past year.\n\nThomas Henry Huxley was born at Ealing in 1825. His scientific training began at Charing Cross Hospital, where he joined the medical school in 1842. Even while here he distinguished himself by a brief notice in the Medical Times and Gazette of that layer in the root-sheath of hair which has since borne his name. Passing his M.B. Examination in 1845, he took the second place in honours in Anatomy and Physiology, and after practising for some time among the poor in London, he joined the Royal Naval Medical Service. Thus he came to occupy the post of Assistant-Surgeon to H.M.S. Rattlesnake then about to start on a surveying voyage to the South Seas. The voyage, during which the Inner route between the Barrier Reef and the East Coast of Australia and New Guinea was surveyed, and the world circumnavigated, occupied four years. So ample was the use that Huxley made of the opportunities thus afforded, that his communications, and the evidence of ability which they furnished, led to his election into the Royal Society in the year after his return. Two years later, Huxley left the naval service, and in 1856 succeeded Edward Forbes as Professor of Natural History in the Royal School of Mines, a post which he continued to hold till his retirement from all official work.\nten years ago. This was not however, his only scientific post. He was twice Fullerian Professor of Physiology to the Royal Institution; and in the same year in which this honour first fell to him, was appointed Examiner in Physiology and Anatomy to the University of London. Four years later, in 1858, he delivered the Croonian Lecture of the Royal Society, choosing for his subject the \"Theory of the Vertebrate Skull.\" For six years he was Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons, and twice he presided at the British Association, first in 1862 over the Biological Section at the Cambridge meeting, and eight years later, at the Liverpool meeting, over the Association as a whole. In 1869 and 1870, he was President of the Geological and Ethnological Societies, and for three years he was Lord Rector of Aberdeen University. Elected Secretary of the Royal Society in 1873, he was called ten years later to the highest honour of English Science, the presidency of that body. He occupied the place of Sir Wyville Thomson as Professor of Natural History of Edinburgh, during that naturalist's absence with the Challenger, and for four years acted as Inspector of Salmon Fisheries. All his official posts, however, as above stated, were resigned by him in 1885, after which he retired to Eastbourne; but more than six years after his retirement, he received the dignity of Privy Councillor. His honorary degrees and memberships are too numerous to mention, though it must here be remarked that he was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal as early as 1872. After his retirement, Huxley lived a quiet but by no means inactive life, but latterly his health failed, and after more than a year's illness, he died on June 29th, 1895. His work lay in more departments than one, and in each of these he occupies an exceptional position. As Biologist, whatever his rank will in the future be decided to be, he will at any rate be reckoned as one of the foremost of the century. Of wide interests, he undertook research in many Invertebrate and Vertebrate groups, and shed enlightenment on all. Most noteworthy, perhaps, was his work on the Comparative Anatomy and classification of the Vertebrate, to which he paid particular attention. In the second place, as a philosophic thinker, Huxley is universally acknowledged to have held a high position. On many questions he has profoundly influenced modern thought, and in none so much as in that relating to the theory of Evolution. Of the views of Darwin and Wallace he was, if not the earliest, certainly far the most brilliant supporter. As early as 1863 his lectures to working men, begun in 1860 at the Jermyn Street Museum, were published under the title \"Evidence as to Man's place in Nature,\" and excited great interest both at home and abroad. Not only did he advance the Darwinian principles in this and other works, but himself worked out many important developments thereof.\nHis exceptional qualities as a controversialist are well known and were often called forth in defence of the evolution hypothesis and in theological disputes; while as a writer of English, no one of his time has surpassed Huxley. Clearness of writing was his especial aim,\u2014an aim which all must admit he has worthily attained. Perhaps, indeed, his greatest fame will hereafter rest on his qualities as a teacher. The extension of scientific knowledge was to him as important an object as its acquisition, and he fully recognized the extreme difficulty of, as he himself said, \"the task of putting the truths learned in the field, the laboratory, and the museum, into language, which, without bating a jot of scientific accuracy shall be generally intelligible. His desire for the extension of scientific knowledge and methods, according to his own statement, rested on the conviction that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of mankind except veracity of thought and action. With the intent of promoting these objects he was content to subordinate any ambition he possessed for scientific fame to other ends, and he would have been content to be remembered, or even not remembered, as one of many who had worked for the popularization of science, the development and organization of scientific education, and the maintenance of opposition to clericalism of whatever denomination. That he will meet with the former alternative, of remembrance, and of remembrance as an ideal hero of science, will be the opinion of all who have paid even the slightest attention to his work and writings.\n\nDr. D. Prain exhibited a monstrous Papaya and made the following remarks.\n\n*A Case of Pleiotaxy of the Gyn\u00e6cium.\u2014By D. Prain.*\n\n(With Plates IV and V.)\n\nPleiotaxy of the gyn\u00e6cium, or an increase in the number of whorls of which the pistil consists, occurs so infrequently that an undoubted instance is not unworthy of record. The present example, which occurred in a *Papaya* fruit that came to table in the ordinary way as dessert, was sent to the Royal Botanic Garden by Mr. J. S. Gladstone. It is an excellent instance of the condition spoken of as \"a fruit within a fruit.\" Of this condition there may be two explanations. An adventitious fruit may occur within the ovary so as to occupy the position usually occupied by a seed. This is by no means an uncommon occurrence and, among recorded instances, is well-figured by Dr. Masters (*Veg. Teratol.* p. 182, f. 94, 95) from an example in Wall-flower pods,\n\n---\n\n1 Gardener's Chronicle, i. (1882) p. 11 and p. 601.\nby Mr. Duthie (Gard. Chron. i, 1882, p. 601, f. 95) from examples in the pods of Indian Mustard and by Dr. Masters (Veg. Teratol. p. 183, f. 96, 97) from examples in Grapes. Dr. King tells me that he has observed something approaching the same peculiarity in the Papaya itself; one or more of the seeds have been replaced by miniature Papayas projecting into the ovarian cavity.\n\nHere, however, we have to deal with a different phenomenon. Inside the perfectly normal-looking fruit we find a second, about half its length, quite unconnected with the carpels of the ordinary pistil and arising from the axis of the flower within the normal ovary and therefore above the point of attachment of its parts. The edges of the carpellary leaves of this second ovary are more or less free except at the base; through the interstices we can see a third ovary proportionately smaller but rather more approaching the normal ovary in appearance and structure owing to its component carpels being united except at their tips. (Pl. IV, fig. A.) This third ovary we find to be from the second as the second is from the first; it occupies apparently as free the very extremity of the axis of the flower. (Pl. V, fig. B).\n\nThe degree of solution of carpels in the more external of these accessory fruits is rather irregular. Two carpels are united throughout; two others are discrete only in their upper fourth. These two pairs are inter se discrete to within half-an-inch from their base; the solitary carpel on the other hand, is united throughout its lower third to each of its neighbours. The carpels of this whorl are alternate with those of the normal ovary; those of the inmost whorl are in turn alternate with the ones of the whorl just outside and are therefore opposite the normal carpels. (Pl. V, fig. C.) The multiplication of carpels here met with is obviously not due to substitution of carpels for organs of some other kind and is not easily explicable on the theory that there has been a chorisis of the normal carpels.\n\nThe stigmas of these extra carpels appear to be perfectly normal, but being confined within a closed cavity pollination has been impossible and the perfectly normal ovules that cover the placentas have remained undeveloped. Owing to the pressure exerted by the accessory carpels seeds are absent, excepting on the spaces opposite the gaps between these adventitious organs, from the lower two-thirds of the normal fruit. In the upper third where there has been no pressure perfect seeds are present as usual.\n\nThe discrete character of the outer accessory carpels will recall to mind the appearance presented by the \"finger orange,\" in which there is, besides the separation of the ordinary ones, not infrequently an augmentation in number of carpels. This at times is due apparently\nto stamens becoming converted into carpellary organs; not always, however, for at times there is an increase in number of carpels without any alteration of stamens or of other organs. But the presence of a complete axially situated orange within another has not, I believe, been recorded.\n\nThough very uncommon, the condition just detailed, which is the second way in which the existence of a fruit within a fruit may be explained, is nevertheless not novel. An excellent account of a precisely parallel case has been given by Dr. Masters (Gard. Chron. i, 1882, p. 11, f. 1), who records the phenomenon as occurring in *Tropidocarpum* an American Crucifer. In that instance a small ovary occupied, as in the present case, the very extremity of the flower-stem within the normal seed-vessel. And it is possible that the condition of affairs in what is known as the St. Valery apple may be of the same nature, though another explanation has been offered of the structure in this case and it must be admitted that there, as in the case of the Love-apple where too an adventitious series of carpels is occasionally produced, the adventitious one is intimately combined with the primary series.\n\nAs showing the rarity of the condition it may be mentioned that the *Tropidocarpum* example appears to have been the first that Dr. Masters, our greatest authority on teratological questions, had met with; if any similar condition has since been recorded, the record has escaped my attention.\n\nIn the Gardener's Chronicle instance only one accessory carpellary whorl is present; here there are two. Partly on this account therefore, and partly owing to the rarity of the condition, but chiefly because the phenomenon is here so obvious and the abnormal organs are so tangible\u2014the accessory ovary in this *Papaya* measures three inches in length, that of *Tropidocarpum* only as many lines\u2014it seems worth while recording this instance of pleiotaxy of the gynoecium.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited two photographs of the inscription on a rock in the Brahmaputra forwarded by Mr. E. A. Gait.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *Discovery of a copper plate grant of Vi\u00e7var\u0101pa, one of the S\u0113na kings of Bengal.*\u2014By BABU NAGENDRANATHA VASU.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn the village Madanap\u0101da, Post Office Pinj\u0101ri, Pargan\u0101h K\u014d\u1e6d\u0101li-p\u0101da of the Faridpur District, a peasant while digging his field found a\ncopper-plate and made it over to the land-holder, who kept it in his house. This plate was made over to me by Pandita Lak\u1e63mi-candra S\u0101\u1e41khyat\u012brtha in 1892, and I noticed the contents of this inscription and published a facsimile of the whole plate in the Vi\u00e7vak\u014d\u015ba, but this is the first time that I publish the entire text.\n\nIt has a curvature at the top bearing a ten-handed image of \u015aad\u0101ci\u1e47a, similar to that in the grant first brought to notice in the Society's Journal by J. Prinsep in 1838 (Vol. VII., Part I., p. 42).\n\nThe characters may be described as Bengali of the 12th or 13th century A.D., and they resemble closely the characters of the D\u0113op\u0101d\u0113 inscription of Vijaya-s\u0113na.\n\nThe inscription opens with an invocation of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, of the Sun and of the Moon. It then relates that:\n\nFrom this famous lineage (of the Moon) sprung Sudh\u0101-kir\u0101\u1e47a-\u00e7\u0101khara (\u00c7iva) in the shape of Vijaya-s\u0113na. From him was born a very powerful king named Ball\u0101la-s\u0113na. From him sprung a son named Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na; his son was Vi\u00e7va-r\u016bpa. The object of this plate is to record the grant of certain lands within the limits of Vikramapura to the \u00c7rutip\u0101\u1e6dhaka (the reader of the Veda) the illustrious Vi\u00e7var\u016bpa-d\u0113va-carman of the V\u0101t\u0113ya g\u014dtra, a great-grandson of Para\u00e7ara-d\u0113va-carman, grandson of Garbh\u0113\u00e7vara and son of Vanam\u0101li, in the month of Bh\u0101dra of the 14th year; effected by the illustrious K\u1e63piv\u012b\u015bu, the chief officer of peace and war in Gauda; (engraved) on the first \u0100\u1e63vina of the year 14.\n\nOne of the important points for notice in connection with this inscription is the distinctive titles of the four S\u0113na Kings which have, I believe, hitherto escaped the notice of antiquarians; thus:\u2014Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vijaya-s\u0113na-d\u0113va was styled Vi\u1e63abha-\u00e7\u0101nkara-ga\u1e47\u1e0d\u0113\u00e7vara, his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ball\u0101la-s\u0113na-d\u0113va, Ni\u1e45canka-\u00e7\u0101nkara-ga\u1e47\u1e0d\u0113\u00e7vara, his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a-s\u0113na-d\u0113va, Madana-\u00e7\u0101nkara-ga\u1e47\u1e0d\u0113\u00e7vara (L. 35), and his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Vi\u00e7var\u016bpa-s\u0113na-d\u0113va, Vi\u1e63abha\u1e45ka-\u00e7\u0101nkara-ga\u1e47\u1e0d\u0113\u00e7vara.\n\nThe contents of the grant published by Prinsep as that of K\u1e63cava-s\u0113na, agree closely with those of the grant under review, with this exception that the place, where the name of the pseudo-K\u1e63cava-s\u0113na occurs in the grant, is in such a condition as to show that originally some other name had been inserted in the place of that of K\u1e63cava-s\u0113na. This circumstance led Prinsep to believe that at the time of the copper-plate being engraved, K\u1e63cava-s\u0113na's elder brother M\u0101dhava-s\u0113na suddenly expired, and that his name was erased from it and that of his brother. But in the face of the copper-plate grant under review, Prinsep's inference can scarcely hold good. The reading moreover of Prinsep is not correct. The correct reading of the 10th verse, published by him according to the facsimile of the original grant of the 3rd year,\nand also as shewn in the newly discovered grant of the 14th year (line 17) is as follows:\n\nEtasmat kathamanyatha ripu-vadh\u016b-vaiddhavya-baddha-vrat\u014d.\nVikhy\u0101ta-ksitip\u0101la-maulir abhavat \u0100ri-vi\u00e7var\u016bpa n\u1e5bpah.\n\nIt is evident from the above cl\u014dka that both the plates have the name of Vi\u00e7va-r\u016bpa. The marks in the two places in the copper-plate of the 14th year exactly tally with those of the other copper-plate of the 3rd year. The name of Vi\u00e7va-r\u016bpa is clearly inscribed on this plate in lines 17, 22 and 38. In both the grants, the name of Vi\u00e7va-r\u016bpa, as marked in the last two places, seems to me to be the Royal sign-manual.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2.
