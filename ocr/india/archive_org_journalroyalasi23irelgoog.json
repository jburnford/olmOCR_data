(Heb. ), \"Lord,\" which is commonly used in the Inscriptions, both of Assyria and Babylon, and which is even found in the Behistun epigraph of Frada, No. 9; while is the determinative of a \"race,\" or \"nation.\"\n\nThe next word is Par\u0161ai, for the ethnic title \"Persian,\" and the parag. ends with , \"king of Persia;\" the proper name, which is here written in the nominative, Par\u0161u, being preceded by the geographical determinative . In the Persian and Tartar texts, the order in which the royal\ntitles are placed, is different from that followed in the version I am now examining; but the only doubt that can exist as to the identification of the Babylonian words, arises from the mutilation of the character, which may either be or . The translation, therefore is, \"the Ach\u00e6menian, royal chief of the Persian nations,(1) king of Persia.\"\n\nPar. 2. * Da ri ya va\u0161. melek.

I doubt their being phonetic. The group , may be compared, perhaps, with (Beh., No. 9, l. 3), the adjuncts and being qualificative signs attached to the monogram for \"king,\" at the option almost, it would seem, of the sculptor. I do not think, at the same time, that or can be compared with , which,\nin many of the Babylonian versions of the trilingual Inscriptions, is substituted for the Persian wazarka, in the phrase \"the great king,\" and which seems to be cognate with a class of Assyrian epithets, such as or or , commonly attached to the monograms or . I have no sufficient reason, I confess, for reading these monograms or as melek. One of the terms, indeed, employed in Babylonian for \"king,\" was certainly a correspondent for , for we have in numerous passages, nominative, sarru ; oblique, sarri (see window Inscription of Darius at Persepolis, and Inscriptions of Khursabad, and of Nebuchadnezzar, passim); and this is moreover, I think, the power of or in the name of the Khursabad king, which I would read Sargina; but on the other hand, it seems impossible but that the word melek should have been employed in Babylonian and Assyrian, as it was employed in every other known language of the Semitic family; and I have also met with one passage, (B. M.,33.1.8.), where \"their king,\" is, I think, written phonetically Malik sun.\n\n1 This is incorrect. The expression which occurs at Nakhsh-i-Rustam, and generally in the Inscriptions of Xerxes, merely signifies \"king of many kings,\" being the pronoun or article used to connect the nominative and genitive.\n\n2 On a further examination and comparison of the Khursabad Inscriptions, I find that the title of melek was especially applied to the rulers of the Khati or Hittites, who held the Syrian cities of Carchemish, Hamath, Bambyce, and Ashdod. The Khursabad king, at least, always styles himself \"conqueror of the maliki\" of these cities, and in no other passage do I find the title used. Compare with the phrase quoted in the text, the analogous passages of the Pavement and Bull Inscriptions of Khursabad, (such as 16. 23; 36. 14, &c.), and remark for the title malik, the variant orthography of sing. and plural. This discovery, of course, tends to discredit the reading of melek for the Assyrian or , and to suggest the uniform adoption of sarru.\nYagabbi is the 3rd person singular Pi\u00ebl conjugation of a root gaba\u1e25, of the class \"\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7\u05d1\". If any such root existed in Hebrew, the form would, I suppose, be written \u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7\u05d1 like \u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc. It is not easy, however, to determine whether the 3rd radical was originally an i or u, that is, whether the root should belong to the class \"\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7\u05d1\" or \"\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\", which, in Arabic, are distinguished from each other*; for there is a constant interchange between these vowels in the Babylonian verbal forms: compare the different forms\u2014\n\n\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b2\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc hagabba, 1st pers. sing.

N.R.,l.10.\n\nI may here observe, once for all, that a pr\u00e6terite tense, such as forms a part of the Hebrew and Arabic verb, is very rarely used in Babylonian. The future, in which the persons are denoted by preformatives, answers commonly both for past and present time, and thus is explained the anomalous use of what the grammarians call the Hebrew tenso of narration with vav conversive.\n\nIn the phrase attua abua, \"my father,\" we have an example of the double use of the pronoun; attua for antua is a possessive pronoun, compounded of the particle an, a form tu, identical with the characteristic of the 1st pers. sing. of the pr\u00e6terite in Arabic, and the true suffix of the 1st person sing. a. This same suffix also occurs in abua, where it is united by the euphonic \u05d0 to the sign \u05d0, which is here used as a monogram for \"father,\" and which corresponds, I believe, with the Hebrew \u05d0\u05d1 and Arabic \u05d0\u05d1.\n\n* The vowel used as the 3rd radical of this verb is, I now think, substituted for a Hebrew i, gabi standing for gabal, which must be compared with \u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b7\u05d1.\nIn the phrase \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9, \u201cthe father of Hystaspes,\u201d the monogram \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 is used without any suffix; and the letter \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 which connects the definite noun with the following genitive, although properly a relative pronoun, seems in this and similar passages to answer to the Hebrew article, with which indeed, orthographically, it is identical, for \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 as a phonetic power is regularly represented in Babylonian by sa. The only other word which requires to be noticed is \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u2019 for Ach\u00e6menes; the adjectival form with a terminal \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 being here, as I think, irregularly put for the proper name.\n\nIn giving the translation of this paragraph, I place the restored portions in brackets.\n\n\u201cDarius, the king, says: My father was Hystaspes; the father of Hystaspes [was Arsames; the father of Arsames was] Ariyaramnes; the father of Ariyaramnes was Teispes; the father of Teispes was Ach\u00e6menes.\u201d\n\nPar. 3. \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2.\n\nDa ri ya va\u1e63. melek.

We cannot tell, in the first place, whether the phrase \u1f08\u03b2\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c3\u03b1 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9 \u1f08\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 be complete, answering to the Persian avahyarddiya, and signifying \u201cfor this reason,\u201d or whether the word for \u201creason,\u201d is not rather to be\nlooked for at the commencement of the third line, representing in this passage, as in so many others, a mere compound particle.\n\nI prefer, I confess, the latter explanation; but I am quite unable either to identify this word with any Semitic correspondent, or even to determine its true phonetic value. The only indication that I know of to its power is furnished by its occurring sometimes singly, but more commonly in connexion with bi or bu, as if the sound it represented ended in b; while the strange discrepancy in its grammatical employment, standing as it does, for an adverb of place, as well as a conditional particle and a preposition of manner, seems to defy all comparison with Hebrew particles.\n\nThe following examples occur of the employment of the particle in the trilingual Inscriptions.\n\n\\[\\text{on account of this [reason].}\\] (Beh., l. 2.)\n\n\\[\\text{\"8 from out of my race.\"}\\] (l. 3.)\n\n\\[\\text{\"The state into sin fell.\"}\\] (l. 14.)\n\n\\[\\text{\"from thence.\"}\\] (l. 15.)\n\n\\[\\text{\"he slew from among them.\" (passim.)}\\]\n\n\\[\\text{\"so that he did not destroy,\"}\\] (l. 28.)\n\n\\[\\text{\"according as I wished thee.\"}\\] (N. R., l. 24.)\n\n\\[\\text{\"In that place.\"}\\] (Beh., l. 47.)\nAnd in Assyrian the same part. is used with equal frequency, the form of \\(\\text{\\texttt{A}}\\) however, being substituted for the Babylonian \\(\\text{\\texttt{B}}\\). Comp.\u2014\n- \\(\\text{\\texttt{C}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{D}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{E}}\\). \"First of them,\" or \"from among them;\" (B.

Ins. passim.)\n\nI am much inclined to think that there is a certain connexion between \\(\\text{\\texttt{I}}\\) or \\(\\text{\\texttt{J}}\\) and the Hebrew \\(\\text{\\texttt{K}}\\), which, as Gesenius says, \"denoted primarily the being and remaining in a place; was then transferred to the ideas of nearness and society, or accompaniment, and was coupled also with verbs of motion,\" (Lex., p. 105); but I cannot venture on any positive opinion*.\n\nAt the commencement of the third line, the orthography throughout is too doubtful to admit of any attempt at etymological analysis. \"From antiquity,\" is rendered in B. M. 40. 14, and in other places, by \\(\\text{\\texttt{L}}\\); \\(\\text{\\texttt{M}}\\); \\(\\text{\\texttt{N}}\\); and it is quite possible that these\n\n---\n\n* As these sheets are passing through the press, it has occurred to me, that \\(\\text{\\texttt{O}}\\) and \\(\\text{\\texttt{P}}\\) are in all probability to be compared with \\(\\text{\\texttt{Q}}\\), the \\(i\\) and \\(u\\) replacing a primitive \\(i\\), and the letter \\(\\text{\\texttt{R}}\\) or \\(\\text{\\texttt{S}}\\), which interchanges with \\(\\text{\\texttt{T}}\\) and \\(\\text{\\texttt{U}}\\), having a guttural pronunciation like the Arabic \\(\\text{\\texttt{V}}\\); \\(\\text{\\texttt{W}}\\) is at any rate used like \\(\\text{\\texttt{X}}\\), and \\(\\text{\\texttt{Y}}\\), like \\(\\text{\\texttt{Z}}\\).\n\n' In the phrase\u2014\n\\(\\text{\\texttt{A}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{B}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{C}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{D}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{E}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{F}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{G}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{H}}\\).\n\\(\\text{\\texttt{I}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{J}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{K}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{L}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{M}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{N}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{O}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{P}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{Q}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{R}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{S}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{T}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{U}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{V}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{W}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{X}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{Y}}\\). \\(\\text{\\texttt{Z}}\\).\n\"Which from antiquity, the kings, my fathers had built.\"\nmay be the words employed in this passage. \"From,\" is everywhere represented indifferently by \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\) and \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\); not as I think, with any attempt at alphabetic expression, for I cannot venture to force \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\) \\( \\text{val} \\), and \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{is} \\), into phonetic identity\\(^1\\), but with a mere employment of equivalent ideographs. Possibly, the preposition thus strangely represented, may require to be sounded \\( \\text{min} \\), but I have no grounds for this conjecture beyond the general evidence of agreement between the Babylonian and the other Semitic tongues.\n\nThe word answering to \"antiquity,\" whether it be written \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) or \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\) is no doubt entirely ideographic. I did at one time conjecture a connexion between the term \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\), and the monogram for \"father;\" tracing, as I fancied, the letters \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) in a subsequent passage (line 18), where the Persian phrase again occurs of \\( \\text{hach\u0101 paruviyat} \\), but a more rigid examination of the Babylonian cast has shown me there are no sufficient grounds for either one orthography or the other.\n\nThe following word answering to \\( \\text{am\u0101d\u0101} \\), is probably a plural participle; and a verbal form must then occur in the 1st person plural.\n\nFurther on we have for \"our race,\" \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\), where the first sign is an ideograph for \"race,\" or \"family,\" and the termination in \\( \\text{uni} \\) is the suffix of the 1st person plural. I am still in doubt as to the phonetic power of \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\). The only Semitic words which I have found at all resembling each other in sound, and which would give the different significations of \"family,\" and \"holding,\" appertaining\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The letter \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) has, however, in addition to its normal value of \\( \\text{is} \\), the secondary power of \\( \\text{mil} \\) or \\( \\text{vil} \\), which nearly assimilates with \\( \\text{\u0161e} \\), so that very possibly the term in question may, after all, be read as \\( \\text{viltu} \\) or \\( \\text{valtu} \\). On the other hand, \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\), \"from,\" is sometimes replaced by \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\), as if the pronunciation were \\( \\text{yasta} \\). In other passages, the particle is represented by \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{ta} \\), or \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\) \\( \\text{ti} \\), and sometimes even by \\( \\text{\u0161a} \\).\nto the Babylonian \u1e63\u0101 and \u1e63\u0101 \u1e2ba\u1e63\u0331, are \u1e63\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0331 and \u1e63\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0331, but I am hardly prepared to adopt this phonetic identification.\n\nAnother curious circumstance which leads me to suspect that my previous translation of the Persian original must have been incorrect, is that the sentence ends with \u1e62\u0331 \u1e62\u0331 \u1e62\u0331. 1 \u1e62\u0331, \u201ctheir kings,\u201d \u1e62\u0331, sun, which is equal to the Hebrew \u1e62\u0331, evidently referring to some antecedent. Perhaps then the paragraph should have been rendered something as follows: \u201cSays Darius the king.

At any rate, the initial sound must be \u1e2ba.\nof \"there,\" or \"in that place.\" The particle \\( \\text{-} \\) will be found to be used with a great variety of significations. With \\( \\text{a} \\) or \\( \\text{b} \\), it means \"of\" or \"from among;\" with \\( \\text{c} \\), as in the expression \\( \\text{d} \\), immediately following, it signifies \"before,\" like the Hebrew \\( \\text{e} \\); alone, it generally implies \"by\" or \"with,\" but sometimes \"of\" or \"in.\" Etymologically, \\( \\text{-} \\) is, I suppose, to be compared with \\( \\text{f} \\), but in its use it more nearly resembles \\( \\text{g} \\). The phrase \\( \\text{h} \\) is remarkable for more reasons than one. Very rarely do we find the Hebrew \\( \\text{i} \\) written with \\( \\text{j} \\) instead of \\( \\text{k} \\); and we have no other example of the possessive pronoun \\( \\text{l} \\) being used as a suffix with the elision of the initial \\( \\text{m} \\).

There is no certainty, indeed, that the word in question is even rendered phonetically, for I have not met with any cognate derivatives, and the letter *\u0161* as an initial, is always liable to suspicion, from its extensive use as a determinative.

It is possible that the form in question may be of the Tiphal conjugation, and that the root may thus commence with a letter belonging to the unknown syllable ; but this is not probable. I should prefer regarding as a derivative from a root commencing with n, the nasal being assimilated with the following dental, and the sign thus representing a syllable which must commence with t or d; (or, indeed, the form might be similar to yaddinu, \"he gave,\" which is probably the Niphal conjugation of a hollow verb, dun.)

See the names in Grotefend\u2019s Plate, Zeits., vol. II. p. 177, and remark also, that the name of is found in one of the Cyprus legends. Gea. Men. Phoen., p. 143.\nIn the clause which follows the formula, \"Says Darius the king,\" and which should give us the translation of \"these are the provinces which have come into my power,\" we have only the initial word, \u1e25aga, and if this word be complete, as it appears to be on the rock, it affords us a good example of the want of preciseness of the Babylonians in regard to grammar, \u1e25aga being the masculine singular instead of the feminine plural, which ought to have have been used in order to agree with \"countries,\" as in the phrase in the following paragraph. In the next phrase, which is \"I am their king,\" the substitution of suna, for the more usual sunu (or sun, as it should, I think, be pronounced) is remarkable, and attur. \"I am,\" or \"I have become,\" is a very interesting word, the form in question which stands for antur, being 1st person singular apocopate of the Niphal conjugation of a hollow root tur, which root again seems to correspond with the Hebrew \"to go,\" although used in a somewhat different sense. As we have the Kal regular form of aturu, in another passage, for \"I became,\" there can be no doubt, I think, but that the duplication in attur denotes the Niphal conjugation, which is thus shown to be employed irrespective of a passive signification.\nI now go on to consider the Babylonian names of the Satrapies. Most of these names it will be seen are made to end in \\( u \\), a peculiarity which may well remind us of the Arabic nominative in \\( e \\), and which I believe to have been a real grammatical characteristic of the Babylonian language, although in practice it was very carelessly observed. Persia is here written \\( \\text{Par\u0161u} \\), with the first syllable divided into letters, instead of being represented as it usually is by the syllable \\( \\text{P} \\). Regarding the name of \\( \\text{Susiana} \\), which was applied to Susiana from the very earliest times, I entertain great doubts about its being intended to be read phonetically. In the 1st place there is no trace, I believe, of any such name as \\( \\text{Nuwaki} \\), (which would be the phonetic value of the signs,) in all geography, sacred or profane. 2ndly, In the Epigraphs at Behistun, Nos. 2 and 5. the name is written \\( \\text{Eluta} \\), as if it were optional to drop the \\( \\text{E} \\), which could hardly have been the case had the orthography really been phonetic; and 3rdly, The name of the province is also very frequently expressed by letters which give the reading of \\( \\text{Eluta} \\), the vernacular form of Elam. I am inclined, therefore, to believe that the signs in \\( \\text{Eluta} \\) are all ideographs, and that the geographical title was uniformly pronounced as written in \\( \\text{Eluta} \\). The terminal \\( \\text{E} \\), indeed, is attached to many geographical names, indicating, as I think, \"a low country,\" and \\( \\text{O} \\) occurs as an ideograph in the name of the god \\( \\text{O} \\), but I am quite at a loss to conjecture what may be the function performed by the \\( \\text{E} \\). It is not a little curious, also, to remark that the name of \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\), (whence the modern \\( \\text{Khuz} \\)) appears to have been entirely unknown to the Tartar as well as to the Semitic nations, for while in Assyrian and Babylonian we have the optional orthography of \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\) and \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\), in the so-called Median Inscriptions the title is written in different passages as \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\) or \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\) or \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\) or \\( \\text{Uwaj} \\), the\nnormal pronunciation being probably haparti or hafarti, which is fully as difficult of explanation as the Assyrian \n\nThe third name is , which is certainly an ideographic mode of expressing the name of Babylon or the Babylonians. The first sign, it must be observed, is not the usual determinative of a country, although so printed in the text; but the letter which has the phonetic power of di. Where the name occurs in the E. I. H. Inscription, the is replaced by , the determinative of a tribe, or people, (Col. 4. 70; Col. 7, ls. 32, 48, &c.); and in two passages, at least, at Behistun, instead of we have simply . I am thus led to suspect, as is a general affix of locality, and seems to signify \"low in situation,\" that the entire group may have meant \"the people of the [great] city of the plain.\" At any rate, although we may still adhere to the name of Babel, we may rest assured that the signs composing the group in question cannot possibly have had that phonetic power. The name of Babylon in its simplest form is expressed by two ideographs, the one denoting \"a gate,\" bab, and the other \"a god,\" ilu. In B. M. 54 : 1.5, and 2.6, the name is thus written\u2014 ; but the first element changes optionally with in Babylonian, or in Assyrian; and the second is often augmented by the addition of a qualificative sign , which in one case is altered to . Upon the meaning of this sign I can offer no opinion, but it certainly was not intended to be pronounced. An adjunct also, referring to geographical position, and equally non-phonetic with\n\n---\n\n1 I have lately met with the name of Susa, (written ), in an Ins. of the time of Darius Hystaspes, discovered by Col.

It is remarkable, that rarrat, the sea, should be here mentioned without the determinative \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\), which in every other passage precedes it. The Assyrians employed the term to designate the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, applying to the localities, however, sometimes the distinctive epithets of \"this sea,\" and \"that sea,\" as in Westergaard's H., la. 9, 10, and 17, 18; and sometimes titles alluding perhaps to geographical position, as in the Cyprus stone, side 1, la. 23 and 24. The name itself would seem to be cognate with the Latin mare, the root from which the word is derived having a reference to the green colour of the sea. It is here in the oblique case.\n\nThe names of Saparda and Ionia are here written Sapardu and Yavanu (\\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\) and \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\)) instead of the Saparda and Yavanu, \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\) and \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\) of Nakhsh-i-Rustam.

I am now obliged to agree with those who identify Saparda with Lydia, or rather, perhaps, with that portion of Asia Minor west of Cappadocia, but I still see no sufficient grounds for connecting a great geographical name, such as the Saparda of the Inscriptions, with the obscure \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\) of Obadiah. Neither Saparda nor Ionia, I think, are mentioned in the Inscriptions of Assyria, though there is the nearly similar name of \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\) Yavnai, for a maritime people of Phoenicia, corresponding with the \\(\\text{\\textsc{v}}\\) of Scripture.

I am now obliged to agree with those who identify Saparda with Lydia, or rather, perhaps, with that portion of Asia Minor west of Cappadocia, but I still see no sufficient grounds for connecting a great geographical name, such as the Saparda of the Inscriptions, with the obscure Obadiah. Neither Saparda nor Ionia, I think, are mentioned in the Inscriptions of Assyria, though there is the nearly similar name of Yavna\u00ef, for a maritime people of Phoenicia, corresponding with the of Scripture. (2 Chr. xxvi. 6. &c.)\nAfter an hiatus which includes the names of Media, Armenia, Cappadocia, Farthia, and Zarangia, names that are fortunately preserved to us in the Inscription of Nakhsh-i-Rustam, we have the forms of \u1e2aariva, Aria, (the first letter being wrongly printed in the text as \u1e2aariva); Khvaris\u0331mu for Chorasmia, (the termination at Nakhsh-i-Rustam being in ma', instead of mu,) and Bakhtar, and Sukdu, for Bactria and Sogdiana; the orthography of the two latter names, which are absolutely identical with the forms used in the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription, being most valuable for the identification of some of the rarer characters.\n\nThe title which follows is very remarkable. It is written\u2014Paruparae\u0161anna, and as it answers to the name of Gandara in the Persian, corresponding with the \u0393\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 of Herodotus, the natural inference is, that we have here the true orthography of a name which the Greeks rendered \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and applied to the mountains above Sindhu Gandh\u0101ra. As the name, however, of Gandara is reproduced in the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription by the group Kandari; as the conversion of Parapar\u0113\u0161anna into Panisus, or Pamisus, requires a greater license of orthography than the Greeks even ordinarily indulged in, while in the Cuneiform word, moreover, the junction of the letters is so unusual as to raise a doubt about their being employed phonetically; and lastly, as it appears quite unaccountable how or why the Babylonians, instead of the vernacular title of the country, should have employed a descriptive epithet evidently of a Sanscrit etymology, I cannot pretend that the \"prim\u00e2 facie\" explanation of Paruparae\u0161anna which I have hazarded, is at all satisfactory.\n\n1 The first syllable in Paropanisus is certainly paruh, \"a mountain;\" the etymology of the latter part of the name is more obscure.\nThe only other names preserved in the Behistun Catalogue are \u1e62\u0101ttagu for the Persian Thataghush. In regard to the latter name, which answers to the Zaray\u014ddai of Herodotus, I have only to remark on the employment of the soft sibilant for the Persian aspirated \u1e6dh, (pronounced like the Greek \u03b8), a power which the Babylonians did not possess, and on the substitution for the Persian case ending in u\u0161h, of the Babylonian nominative in u; but the former name deserves a much more lengthened consideration. In the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription, the name is everywhere written \u1e62\u0101ttagu, which only differs from the Behistun orthography in the duplication of the final r, while in Assyrian, the form is usually found of \u1e62\u0101ttagu, without the plural termination. It will thus be seen, that the initial \u1e62\u0101ttagu is preserved throughout, and up to the present time I have discovered no certain clue to the identification of the phonetic power of this character. As on the one hand, however, the termination of the name is certainly miri or mirri, while on the other, the identification of the Persian Sace or Scythians with the people named by the Greeks \u039a\u03b9\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, in Scripture \u1f18\u03be\u03b1, and by the Armenians Gamir, would seem highly probable, I venture to give to the character \u1e62\u0101ttagu the power of Gi, (which would otherwise be wanting in the alphabet,) and to read the entire name Gimiri. From the frequent occurrence of this name in the Inscriptions of Assyria, it would seem to have originally denoted the general militia of the tribes, and to have been without any special ethnographic application, but there is nothing improbable in the idea that the Celtic tribes may have subsequently appropriated the title to themselves, being thus known to the Greeks and Latins on their first immigration into Europe as \u039a\u03b9\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, or Cimbri, and having perpetuated their ancient designation, not only in the Crimea of Southern Russia, but in the Cymri of modern Wales.\n\nThe names of Arachotia and Mecia, and the numerical total of the Satrapies which we find in the Persian text, are lost in the Baby-\nlonian; and in giving the following translation, therefore, of the entire paragraph, I distinguish the restored portions by placing them in brackets:\n\n\"Says Darius the king: these [are the provinces which have come into my possession: by the grace of Ormazd] I am king of them: Persis, Susiana, Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Egypt, the Archipelago, Saparda, Ionia, [Media, Armenia, Cappadocia, Parthia, Zarangis,] Aria, Chorasmia, Bactria, Sogdiana, Gandara, (!) the Cimmerians or Scythians, Sattagydia, [Arachotia, and Mecia; in all, 23 provinces.]\"\n\n---\n\nPar. 7. l. 7\n\n(\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014) ha ga n e t.\n\n* * sa. ana ku. ya ts iv va '. in ni.\n\na\u0161 i\u0161 vi. sa. * Hu ri mi \u0161 da'.\n\na na. a na ku.

We have in other passages, for the same Persian word imd, \"these,\" annita, \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014, in the nominative, and anniti, \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014, in the oblique case; but these terms come,\nI think, from a distinct pronominal base. In the word\u2014\n\\[ \\text{haga} \\] haga is the pronoun signifying \"this,\" (a hardening perhaps of the Hebrew \\( \\text{n} \\)); the \\( n \\) following is the numeral characteristic, and the feminine gender is marked by the terminal \\( \\text{a} \\). The employment of the \\( \\text{a} \\), however, in this last syllable, is unusual, and I know not if the ending should be pronounced \\( \\text{et} \\) or \\( \\text{eta} \\). The same word occurs also in the next paragraph for the oblique case, but I am unable to throw any light on the declension, as the pronoun in question seems to have been peculiar to the later Babylonian, and is never met with in the inscriptions of Assyria.\n\nThe following word, \"provinces,\" is expressed by the duplication of the monogram \\( \\text{a} \\): perhaps in reading, the term \\( \\text{a} \\), or \\( \\text{a} \\), should be pronounced \\( \\text{mati} \\).\n\nIn the next phrase\u2014\n\n\\[ \\text{sa anaku yatsivca' inni}, \\] \"which belonged to me,\" we have an example of the double use of the pronoun; \\( \\text{anaku} \\), which precedes the verb, being used apparently as its object, and a suffix, \\( \\text{inni} \\), being employed after\n\n---\n\n1 Haga, at any rate, may be compared immediately with the Latin hic, and with the Pushtoo hagha, both as to sense and sound, although these forms are supposed to be intimately connected with the Indo-Germanic pronominal system. (Compare Sans. \\( \\text{\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924} \\); Zend \\( \\text{\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924} \\), &c.)\n\n2 \\( \\text{a} \\) as an ideograph for a country, as well as a phonetic power, is thus often replaced by \\( \\text{mat} \\). See the orthography of the name of the city of Hamath, and compare \\( \\text{a} \\). Khur., 152. 8, with \\( \\text{a} \\). Khurabad, 129. 5. For \"this my country,\" we have also, \\( \\text{a} \\), in Nakhshah-l-Rustam, l. 33; but in Westergaard's H., l. 8 and 16, \\( \\text{a} \\) and \\( \\text{a} \\) are used in apposition to each other, as if they were different terms.\nthe verb, to make the signification more precise. There are other examples of such a construction in the trilingual Inscriptions\u2014(compare \\( \\text{anaku li\u0161ur anni}, \"protect me;\" \\)) and the pleonastic use of pronominal suffixes is not altogether unknown to the Hebrew. We have hardly examples enough at present to be able to decide whether the suffixes in Babylonian follow the precise rules observed in Hebrew in regard to their pointing, and their mode of union with the verbs. The use of the epenthetic nun to connect the suffix of the first person singular with the verb, seems, in Babylonian as in Hebrew, to be restricted to the future tense; but I cannot ascertain that the same rules prevail with regard to the respective employment of the \\( a \\) and \\( i \\) for the connective vowel. I observe at any rate that the \\( i \\) is used when the verbal form ends with \\( u \\) as well as \\( a \\), and that the \\( a \\) occurs both after the regular form and the apocopate. Compare the following examples taken from the trilingual Inscriptions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{yatsiwa' inni,} & \\quad \\text{\"they belonged to me.\"} \\\\\n\\text{yakkira' inni,} & \\quad \\text{\"they rebelled against me.\"} \\\\\n\\text{yadammu' inni,} & \\quad \\text{\"they obeyed me.\"} \\\\\n\\text{li\u0161ur anni,} & \\quad \\text{\"may he protect me.\"} \\\\\n\\text{yapti \u2014 anni,} & \\quad \\text{\"he granted to me.\"} \\\\\n\\text{takkira anni,} & \\quad \\text{\"it rebelled against me!\";}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe form \\( \\text{yatsiwa'}, \\) to which the suffix \\( \\text{inni} \\) is attached, must be the 3rd person plural Pi\u00ebl of a root\n\n---\n\n1 This is the feminine singular of the 3rd person, the feminine plural being \\( \\text{yakkira'} \\).\ntsavah, which seems to correspond in form, though not in sense, with the Hebrew \\( \\text{\u05ea\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc} \\). The termination in \\( a' \\) instead of \\( u' \\) is indicative, I think, of the feminine gender. I observe, at least, that wherever in the trilingual Inscriptions, a future plural form ends in \\( a' \\), the immediate nominative is \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\), which is certainly of the feminine gender. It would be moreover in strict analogy with Hebrew and Arabic grammar, that the true masculine and feminine endings should be \\( un \\) and \\( an \\), of which \\( u' \\) and \\( a' \\) might be supposed to be contractions.\n\nAfter the phrase answering to washnd Auramazzdha, which has been already explained, we have \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\), for mand badak\u00e1 dha, \"to me submissive they have become.\" Ana anaku, \"to me,\" does not require any special notice, but the other words are of interest. The term \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\), I can neither read nor explain. It is hardly possible that the letters should have their true phonetic power, for epnai would be etymologically quite unintelligible. I would rather take \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\) for a compound ideograph: \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\) at any rate, in other words, such as \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\) for fratama, \"chief;\" \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\) for dipi \"a tablet,\" &c., is evidently used with an abnormal value, derived, perhaps, from its ideographic application; and with regard to the \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\), although it is one of the least doubtful signs in the alphabet, its mere combination in this word with the plural ending in \\( t \\), shows that it cannot represent its ordinary phonetic power of \\( na \\).\n\nIn the meantime, as I have met with no other example of the word in question, I abstain from conjecture, and pass on to the verb with which it is allied.\n\n\\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b9\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea} \\), yatturun, for yanturun, signifying \"they have become,\" must be the 3rd person plural of the Niphal form of the hollow root tur, from which we have already met with\nanother derivative in the term \\( \\text{attur}^1 \\). I have not yet ascertained the reason why, in a few instances, and a few instances only, we find the true plural inflexion with an \\( \\alpha \\); (compare\u2014\n\nSing.  \nPlur.\n\n\\( \\text{yattur}, \"he became,\" \\)  \n\\( \\text{yatturun}, \\)\n\n\\( \\text{atki}, \"I assembled,\" \\)  \n\\( \\text{yatkuni}, \\)\n\n\\( \\text{yatbd}, \"he came,\" \\)  \n\\( \\text{yatbuni}. \\)\n\nIt can hardly be that such forms belong to a tense resembling the Paragogic future of the Arabic; nor that the full termination and the apocopate may be used indifferently. I should rather attribute the appearance of the nasal to some prosodaic rule regarding the weight of the vowels in concave and defective roots; but the examples are too few to afford any determinate grounds for enquiry\\(^2\\). It should further be remarked, that the verb is here placed in the masculine gender, as more worthy than the feminine, and in consequence of being removed from immediate contact with the nominative, whilst the employment of the letter \\( \\text{\\( \\alpha \\)} \\) instead of \\( \\text{\\( \\beta \\)} \\) for the silent terminal \\( \\alpha \\) after the vowel \\( u \\), is owing probably to a mere laxity of orthography\\(^3\\), such as is observable in the indifferent use of \\( \\text{\\( \\alpha \\)} \\).\n\n---\n\n1 The analogy between the forms \\( \\text{attur}, \\) or \\( \\text{atturun}, \\) and \\( \\text{adduk}, \\) or \\( \\text{adduku}, \\) would lead to a suspicion that the root of the substantive verb might be \\( \\text{taror} \\) like \\( \\text{dakak}, \\) and that the duplication might be similar to the Dagheesh used in Hebrew with the first radical of one of the future forms of the verba geminantis. Compare \\( \\text{for} \\) \\( \\text{. This explanation is, at any rate, preferable to that given in page xv.} \\)\n\n2 In Mr. Layard's new Inscriptions, I have met with numerous examples of this plural ending, which seems, in fact, to be used indifferently with the contracted form in \\( \\alpha \\).\n\n3 It seems to me impossible that the letter \\( \\text{\\( \\alpha \\)} \\) can here represent its full power of \\( \\alpha u, \\) as that termination is unknown to any of the plural forms, either in Hebrew or Arabic.\nand in Assyrian, to express the pronominal affix of the 3rd person plural masculine.\n\nThe next word is mandatta, \"tribute,\" a term which nearly coincides with the Chaldee, the Babylonian always hardening the feminine termination into a dental, as it is hardened in Arabic, and in the construct state of the Hebrew or Chaldee noun. In Assyrian, the usual orthography employed is nom. madatu, oblique madata, forms which bear the same relation to that bears to . The n, however, is sometimes found in the Assyrian term, and the duplication of the t is common. In the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription the terminal letter is instead of , the final a, in both examples, marking the oblique case.\n\nThe verb signifying \"they brought,\" which governs mandatta, is lost; the only other words, indeed, which can be recovered in the paragraph are, ana sasu yapnusu', \"that they did:\" ana in this passage and in several others, seems to perform the function of the Hebrew as the particle governing the accusative case; but this employment of it is, I think, in reality, rather owing to its individualizing power. The next word which, if phonetic, must be read sasu, occurs very frequently, both in Babylonian and Assyrian, for the accusative case of the pronoun of the 3rd person singular, and curiously enough it seems to be irrespective of gender. I am not quite sure, however, that the term is phonetic, for the corresponding phrase in the Nakhsh-i-Rustam\n\n1 If the derivation of this term from the root be correct, the nasal, of course, must be explained as in Chaldee, by the Dagheesh forte being resolved, a curious illustration being thus obtained of the applicability to the Babylonian of the orthographical rules proper to the Hebrew and Chaldee.\nInscription is where answers to the Behistun and is apparently ideographic\\(^1\\). The verb yapnusu', \"they did,\" is the 3rd person masculine plural of a root which seems to be identical with the Hebrew signifying literally, \"to build,\" but tropically, \"to do,\" or \"make.\" This explanation, however, is not quite satisfactory, for in the first place, the letter as the third radical of a Hebrew root should be converted in Babylonian to \\(i\\) or \\(w\\); and in the next place, we have numerous examples of Cuneiform derivatives from which do actually follow this orthographical rule. Compare apnu, or aptani, \"I built;\" yapni, \"he built,\" &c. All that I can say, therefore, at present is, that yapnusu' for yapnusun, comes from a Babylonian root, which may be either banas or panas, and which signifies, \"to do,\" or \"make.\"\n\nThe following is the translation of the paragraph with the restored portions in brackets.\n\n[\"Says Darius the king:] these are the provinces which came into my power. By the grace of Ormazd they have become subjected to me; tribute [they have brought to me. As to them it has been ordered by me], that they have done.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) On a further consideration, I am satisfied that this phrase should be read ana apusu yabbusu', \"they did the doing,\" according to a system of redundant expression which the Babylonian particularly affected.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ana sasu yapnusu' might signify \"to that they turned,\" the verb employed corresponding to the Hebrew. The term apusu, however, is, I think, again used in line 11, and the context will there require a verb similar to the Latin ago.\nAfter the usual formula, we have for atara im\u00e1 dahy\u00e1wa, \"within these countries,\" a phrase, in which the only difficulty regards the particle. Following Semitic analogies it would, of course, be most natural to read this word as bin, the compound particle being equal to the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05df, but I have found no other passage in which the letter could be supposed to represent the syllable in. Presuming, indeed, that the characters and are identical, (the two forms, although distinguished at Behistun, being certainly confounded in other Babylonian Inscriptions, and being represented in Assyrian by the single character,) the complemental\nInscription is \\[\\text{I. } \\text{II. } \\text{III. }\\] where \\[\\text{I. } \\text{II. } \\text{III. }\\] answers to the Behistun \\[\\text{I. } \\text{II. } \\text{III. }\\] and is apparently ideographic\\(^1\\). The verb \\[\\text{yapnusu'}\\], \"they did,\" is the 3rd person masculine plural of a root which seems to be identical with the Hebrew \\[\\text{\u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2}\\], signifying literally, \"to build,\" but tropically, \"to do,\" or \"make.\" This explanation, however, is not quite satisfactory, for in the first place, the letter \\[\\text{n}\\] as the third radical of a Hebrew root should be converted in Babylonian to \\[\\text{i}\\] or \\[\\text{u}\\]; and in the next place, we have numerous examples of Cuneiform derivatives from \\[\\text{n\u0101b\u0101}\\], which do actually follow this orthographical rule. Compare \\[\\text{opnu}\\], or \\[\\text{aptani}\\], \"I built;\" \\[\\text{yapni}\\], \"he built,\" &c. All that I can say, therefore, at present is, that yapnusu' for yapnusun, comes from a Babylonian root, which may be either \\[\\text{banas}\\] or \\[\\text{panas}\\], and which signifies, \"to do,\" or \"make\"\\(^2\\).\n\nThe following is the translation of the paragraph with the restored portions in brackets.\n\n[\"Says Darius the king:] these are the provinces which came into my power. By the grace of Ormazd they have become subjected to me; tribute [they have brought to me. As to them it has been ordered by me], that they have done.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) On a further consideration, I am satisfied that this phrase should be read \\[\\text{ana apunu yabbusu'}\\], \"they did the doing,\" according to a system of redundant expression which the Babylonian particularly affected.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ana saru yapnusu' might signify \"to that they turned,\" the verb employed corresponding to the Hebrew \\[\\text{n\u0101b\u0101}\\]. The term yapnusu', however, is, I think, again used in line 11, and the context will there require a verb similar to the Latin ago.\nAfter the usual formula, we have for *atara im\u00e1 dahy\u00e1wa*, \"within these countries,\" a phrase, in which the only difficulty regards the particle. Following Semitic analogies it would, of course, be most natural to read this word as *bin*, the compound particle being equal to the Hebrew *\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0*, but I have found no other passage in which the letter could be supposed to represent the syllable *in*. Presuming, indeed, that the characters and are identical, (the two forms, although distinguished at Behistun, being certainly confounded in other Babylonian Inscriptions, and being represented in Assyrian by the single character,) the complemental\npower of $v$ or $m$ after the vowel $u$ must be admitted as the normal value of the sign, and this value attached to the syllable $bi$, would seem by some strange phonetic fiction to be combined into the single articulation of $bu$ or $bo$, as in the last syllable of the name of the god Nebo\\(^1\\). I am however, for my own part, disinclined to read the word in question either as $bin$ or $bu$. I would rather suppose the letter \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\] to correspond with the Hebrew \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], and would conjecture the \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\] to be a mere non-phonetic adjunct, employed for some purpose which must remain for the present obscure.\n\nThe next words are of interest. In the Persian, we have \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{martiya hya agatd aha;}}\\] in the Babylonian, \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], the last character being alone liable to doubt. Now, \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\] is well known as the monogram for \u201ca man,\u201d which it was probably allowable to read phonetically as \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{ish}},\\] or \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{adam}},\\] or \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{mat}},\\] or according to any of the sounds representing the idea of \u201ca man;\u201d and the second word, therefore, \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{pitkut}},\\] stands for the Persian \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{agatd}},\\] a noun which has hitherto baffled all attempts at interpretation. The root, however, \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{patak}}\\] or \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{batak}},\\] is used in so many passages of the Assyrian and Babylonian Inscriptions, that its signification can hardly be mistaken. In all the following examples the allusion evidently is to \u201ccarving,\u201d or \u201cfashioning,\u201d or \u201cworking,\u201d or perhaps \u201cbuilding;\u201d and the root may, therefore, be compared either with the Pi\u0113l form of \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], or with the verb \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], which is once used in Eze. xvi. 40\\(^2\\).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This name is written phonetically as \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\], a for which we are certainly warranted, on the united authority of ancient and modern languages, in reading \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{Nabu}},\\] rather than \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{Nabiuw}}.\\]\n\n\\(^2\\) The Pi\u0113l form of \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\] signifies, \u201cto engrave,\u201d or \u201ccarve,\u201d or \u201csculp and would suit the Assyrian verb therefore sufficiently well. I doubt, however, the interchange of the Hebrew \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\] with the Babylonian \\[\\text{\\small \\texttt{}}\\] merely \u201cto cut in pieces,\u201d and is but remotely connected, therefore, as far as we concerned, with the verb in question.\n1. da. * p i li. pi s e.\nya na. ir.

D\u00e1t, indeed, or d\u00e1n, would be immediately cognate with the Latin dono, and the term yaddinu, which answers so frequently to ada, \"he gave,\" in the Standard trilingual Inscriptions, can only be explained as a derivative from the same root\u00b9.

In the Inscriptions lately brought by Mr. Layard from Assyria, numerous examples occur\nan alteration will not affect the general sense of the paragraph. If on\nthe other hand, we scrupulously follow the Persian original, the reading\nof \\( \\text{as} \\) \\( \\text{bi} \\) would seem to be preferable for \\( \\text{as} \\) \\( \\text{bi} \\), and an\ninstrumental sense must be given to the particle.\n\nThe verb from which is derived \\( \\text{hvasaggu} \\),\nI have not yet been able to identify, owing to the confusion and\nuncertainty in which is involved the employment of the Babylonian\nsibilants. I feel pretty certain, however, that the root must be \\( \\text{sagag} \\),\nrather than \\( \\text{sagah} \\), and that the term employed is a mere plural pas-\nsive participle, formed like the Arabic \\( \\text{ismi maf'ul} \\), rather than after\nthe fashion of the Hebrew. I should expect, indeed, the Hebrew cor-\nresponding root to be written \\( \\text{pd} \\), and it is the more important\nfollow out this etymology, as the commencement in \\( \\text{v} \\) being\nidentical with that which characterizes the Hiphil participle of the\nBabylonian, would be apt to mislead, were not due attention paid to the\nvowel-pointing. The initial \\( \\text{v} \\), as will be abundantly shown in\nthe alphabet, answers to the \\( \\text{v} \\) of the Hebrew, and the termination in\n\\( \\text{u} \\), (which causes the second radical to be jesmated), is the inflexion of\nthe plural masculine (for \\( \\text{un} \\)), agreeing with \\( \\text{dindit} \\), and thus showing\nthat either the plural ending in \\( \\text{dt} \\) is not restricted to feminine nouns,\nor that the participial plural in \\( \\text{u} \\) is common to both genders.\n\nI have failed to recognise the root from which we have the par-\nticiple \\( \\text{hvasaggu} \\), in any other passage of the Inscriptions.\n\nThe termination of the line, \\( \\text{sa la paniya attua} \\), is sufficiently clear. \\( \\text{Sa} \\) is used in this passage for\nthe relative, \"that which;\" and we thus see that the sign \\( \\text{v} \\) or \\( \\text{v} \\)\n\nof the indifferent orthography of \\( \\text{danani} \\), for the word signifying \"laws,\" a further proof being thus afforded of the\nderivation of the noun from the root \\( \\text{danan} \\), which has supplied us with the future\nforms \\( \\text{yaddinu} \\) or \\( \\text{yaddanu} \\), \"he\ngave,\" or \"granted.\"\nanswers both to the article \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 and to the pronoun \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 of the Ph\u0153nician and the Rabbinic Hebrew. It is interesting also to observe, that this pronoun is expressed by \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 or \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5, by \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df or \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, and by \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df almost indifferently, an apt illustration being thus afforded of the direct passage of \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 into the Chaldee \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 without having recourse to the conjecture of Gesenius, which would derive the latter form from the demonstrative \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 through the Arabic \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df.\n\nThe compound particle, lapani, although absolutely identical with the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 as far as the etymology is concerned, is used, I think, in this and other passages, in an ablative or instrumental sense, rather than with any immediate reference to the root \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5, \"to turn.\" Perhaps, however, we might translate lapaniya attua, \"ab ore meo,\" as well as \"a me;\" for the verb which follows must signify \"said;\" the Persian corresponding term being athahya. The use of a double pronoun is again to be remarked in this phrase, the possessive attua being employed, notwithstanding that the suffix in a of the 1st pers. sing. is attached by a euphonic y, to the particle pani.\n\nIn the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription, the corresponding passage is \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, and I am thus led to suspect that the character \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df\u2014 in addition to its normal value of ai, must have had the secondary power of pani, or at any rate, must have been ideographically equivalent to the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5*. I give the translation, therefore, of the Babylonian portions of this paragraph as follows:\n\n\"Says Darius the king: throughout these provinces the industrious man, to him [I have granted favor or protection; the idle man I have punished with severity]. By the grace of Ormazd, my laws throughout these provinces have been observed. That which from me [has been declared to them, that have they performed].\n\n* In Mr. Layard's new Inscriptions \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df is repeatedly put for lapani, \"from.\"\nIn the phrase which follows the formula, \"says Darius the king,\" and which is rendered in the Persian, Auramazdd mand khshatram frdbara, we remark in the Babylonian, that the pronoun of the 1st pers. is omitted. The terminal \\(\\text{\\texttt{SEE}}\\) in the word for \"kingdom,\" must necessarily, I think, represent the syllable \\(ut\\), rather than \\(tu\\), but I am still at a loss to decide whether the entire word should be read melkut or sarrut. With regard to the following verb, also, \\(\\text{\\texttt{EY}}\\) I have nothing to add to the conjectures already advanced in my analysis of line 4*.\n\nThe next phrase, answering to the Persian, Auramazddmaiya upastdm abara, \"Ormazd brought help to me,\" is given in Babylonian as, \\(\\text{\\texttt{EY}}\\), and although there are here only two words to be explained, considerable difficulty attaches to them. Until lately, indeed, relying on the usual collocation of the Semitic languages which places the verb after the object, I have supposed yasht to signify \"help,\" being a derivative from the root \\(ywh\\), and I have conjectured \\(\\text{\\texttt{EY}}\\) to be allied to\n\n* But see the new foot-note to p. xii.\nas abara, in the Persian, contains the same root as frdbara. At present, however, I see reason to doubt this explanation, and to suspect even that may be the verb, and the noun; for in the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription, the phrase b\u0101jim abara, \"they brought tribute,\" is rendered by , the verb employed being apparently the same which occurs in for abara; and it is possible, also, that as the Persian upast\u0101m \"help\" comes from a root st\u0101, indicating \"stability,\" so in this phrase, (however it be pronounced,) may be allied to the adjective , which is used so often in the Inscriptions of Assyria to indicate \"strength,\" or \"power.\"\n\nIf the verb be expressed phonetically, it may be read yas\u0161i, for yan\u0161i, the root being , which is often used in Hebrew with the sense of \"bringing,\" as in the phrases \"the east wind brought the locusts,\" Ex. x. 13; \"the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir,\" 1 Kings x. 11, &c. The only irregularity would then be, that the third radical had been treated like the weak letter n, in roots of the class, (for , as for instance, is for . See Ges. Grammar, p. 71.) In the same view I should take for the construct infinitive, the particle ana being generally used before such forms in Babylonian, (compare ana episu takha\u1e63a, \"to do battle;\" ana kasadi, \"on arriving;\" ana sadari, \"to write.\" &c., &c.;) and si being a cognate form with (Ps. 89. 10), or as the word is more commonly written in Hebrew,\n\nWith regard to the pronunciation of , I am unable to state anything positive. Forms such as ripnu or lapnu, appear to\nme in the highest degree improbable; and *danu*, after the analogy of\nthe probable relationship of \\[\\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97}\\] with \\[\\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97}\\], presents\neven some difficulties of explanation.

It reads \\( \\text{ad}i \\text{ eli sa} \\), and is formed of three distinct words: *ad\u012b* is the Hebrew \\( \\text{ad} \\); Syriac \\( \\text{ad} \\); Latin, *ad*, &c., and signifies properly \"to,\" or \"as far as,\" though it is often used in Assyrian for the simple conjunction \"and.\" \\( \\text{ad}i \\text{ eli sa} \\) (or, as it is sometimes written, \\( \\text{ad}i \\text{ eli sa} \\)) corresponds with the Hebrew \\( \\text{ad} \\) and Arabic \\( \\text{ad} \\), and, as an independent preposition, has the sense of \"over\" or \"upon:\" here, however, it seems to be used for \\( \\text{ad} \\), as in the phrase \\( \\text{ad} \\text{ eli sa} \\), \"until he came,\" (Judges iii. 3), while \\( \\text{ad} \\) is the relative, \\( \\text{ad} \\) or \\( \\text{ad} \\text{ eli sa} \\), which is constantly joined with \\( \\text{ad} \\) in Hebrew to express the fuller sense of \"until that.\" *Adi eli sa* may thus be correctly rendered in Latin by *adeo ut*.\n\nThe only other word to be noticed in this line is the demonstrative pronoun \\( \\text{ta} \\), where the feminine characteristic in \\( \\text{ta} \\), is added to the theme \\( \\text{haga} \\), to agree with the feminine noun \\( \\text{ta} \\).\n\nAt the commencement of the next line we have the word \\( \\text{anaku} \\), \"I,\" and an imperfect verb, which should perhaps be restored to \\( \\text{apnusu} \\), the 1st person of the same verb of which the 3rd person has been already examined in the phrase\u2014\\( \\text{ana sani yapnusu} \\), \"that they did.\" Although the idiom, indeed, of *imperium agere* is foreign to the Persian, the Babylonian and the Scythic versions of the Behistun Inscription constantly make use of the same root for performing an act and exercising rule. As indeed, in line 3, we have, in the phrase, \\( \\text{ana sani yapnusu} \\), an example of the\n\nexample here quoted, may be translated, \"I gave as dependencies.\" The two preceding examples are very doubtful: \\( \\text{ana sani yapnusu} \\) seems rather to signify \"he threw off allegiance.\"\nemployment of *ebas*, in connection with *melkut*, in order to give the sense of \"reigning,\" so I conjecture that *k\u0161\u0161atram daray\u00e1miya*, \"I hold the empire,\" or \"reign,\" is here represented by *melkut anaku apnusu*; the root *panas* or *banas*, being, as I have before shown, an exact synonym of *ebas*, \"to do.\"\n\nThe translation then will be as follows:\n\n\"Darius the king says: Ormazd granted (me) the empire.

The substitution of *u* for *a* between the 2nd and 3rd radicals, is in perfect accordance with Hebrew and Arabic grammar, and the termination in *u* corresponds also with the usage of the latter language.\nOwing, however, to the first radical of this root standing half-way as it were between the guttural \\( y \\) and the weak letter \\( N \\), the Babylonian conjugation cannot be compared with any of the Hebrew classes. The letter \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\) here stands for what in Hebrew would be expressed as \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\), while in the 3rd person, the guttural altogether falls away, and \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\) replaces \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\).

The final character \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\), at any rate, is frequently employed, as I have already shown, as a non-phonetic adjunct to names of places in plain countries, and it has, I suspect, therefore, the ideographic value of \u201clow,\u201d or \u201cdown.\u201d If, then, \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\) could also be supposed to indicate \u201ctime,\u201d we might understand how the word \u201cafter\u201d came to be written \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\), and we might employ as its phonetic correspondent any standard Semitic term, such as \\( b'ad \\) or \\( akhar \\). Pending the discovery, indeed, in other Inscriptions, of the same particle written phonetically, I thus venture to substitute for it the Hebrew \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa2} \\), and read the word in the Roman character as \\( akhar \\).

Suva, signifying \"he,\" or \"this one,\" is exactly the Hebrew \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0, and Arabic \u0646\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0621, the Hebrew aspirate being regularly replaced in Babylonian by the sibilant; and the same relationship being thus indicated between the languages, that exists between the old Persian and the Sanscrit, or between the Greek and Latin. We shall subsequently find this pronoun suva united to the demonstrative h\u0101ga, and we shall, also, repeatedly meet with the suffix \u05d9 or \u05d9, which is, of course, a remnant of the same theme.\n\nIn the older Hebrew, as it is well-known, \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 was used indifferently both for the masculine and feminine; and this confusion of genders is, I believe, often to be detected in the Inscriptions of Assyria. The true feminine, however, of \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 is written \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 or \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0, suat or s'at, the connexion between the two forms being similar to that which exists in Hebrew between \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 and \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0.\n\nThe adverb of place, hakannu, answering to the Persian id\u0101, \"here,\" is of course, formed from the demonstrative base haga, but I do not recognize any immediate correspondent, either in Hebrew or Arabia.

We shall subsequently find this pronoun suva united to the demonstrative h\u0101ga, and we shall, also, repeatedly meet with the suffix I or \u05d9, which is, of course, a remnant of the same theme.\n\nIn the older Hebrew, as it is well-known, \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 was used indifferently both for the masculine and feminine; and this confusion of genders is, I believe, often to be detected in the Inscriptions of Assyria.

It appears, also, to be immaterial in what vowel the word may terminate, for in Westergaard's Inscription E. l. 8, we have the phrase, sa. anaku, hakanna ebussu, \"quod ego hic feci,\" standing for the Persian tya mana kartam id\u0101. The connexion of\n\n* I now prefer explaining forms in which the first radical is doubled, such as yattur, yadduku, yadlina, by supposing the roots to be of the \"YY\" class.\nwith \\( \\text{is established beyond dispute by the orthography of the masc. plur. of the demonstrative pronoun, which is written} \\) in lines 106 and 112 of this Inscription*.\n\nThe phrase, \\( \\text{ana melek yattur, \"he was the king,\" which follows hakannu, may be compared with the ana melek attur of the last line, attur and yattur being the 1st and 3rd person respectively of the same tense.} \\)\n\nFor the fourth clause, which reads in the Persian, Awahya Kabujiyahya brdit Bardiya ndma dha, we have in the Babylonian,\n\n\\( \\text{sa Kambusiya hagasuva akhisu Barsiya, \"of this Cambyses, the brother was Bardes.\"} \\)\n\nThe use of the relative sa, to form a genitive at the commencement of a phrase, is sufficiently common in Babylonian, although such an employment of \\( \\text{or} \\) would hardly be allowable in Hebrew or Chaldee. In the names of Cambyses and Bardes, it will be seen that I represent the Babylonian \\( \\text{by si, as an intermediate articulation between the dental and the sibilant.

It only remains, therefore, to explain the monogram \\textsc{i}\\textsc{i}, which, whatever be its pronunciation, must certainly stand for \"brother.\" The character \\textsc{x}\\textsc{x} seems to be peculiar to the later Babylonian. As it represents the last element in the name of Nabochodrossor, interchanging in that position with \\textsc{i}\\textsc{j}\\textsc{i}, it must have the phonetic power of \\textit{sur}, but I cannot believe that \\textit{sur} signifies \"a brother.\" It is more probable that, like all the other signs appropriated to the expression of relationship, the \\textsc{x}\\textsc{x} has in this passage a purely ideographic value, and with a due respect therefore for Semitic analogies, I venture to read the word as \\textit{akhi}, supposing the \\textsc{i} which is attached to it, to be the suffix of the 3rd person, used phonetically, according to the genius of the Babylonian language. At the same time, I have neither discovered the alphabetic equivalent of \\textsc{x}\\textsc{x} in Assyrian, nor even have I succeeded in finding how the idea of \"brother\" was expressed in that language.\n\nAfter the name of \\textit{Barsiya}, the word answering to \\textit{n\u0101ma}, \"by name,\" has been omitted as of no consequence: I pass on accordingly to the fifth clause, where for

It reads:\u2014\n\n\u2014Kambujiya yadduku ana Barziya, ana hvku val \u2014 \u2014 ki, sa Barziya diyaki, and may be thus analysed. The adverb answering to yath\u00e1, \"when,\" at the commencement of the phrase, is probably alla sa, as in line 29. Yadduku is the 3rd person singular masculine of the Kal conjugation of a root identical with the Hebrew which follows the paradigm of the \"verba geminantis\" given in Gesenius, \u00a7 66, or page 143. For the Hebrew future of this conjugation, there are, it is well known, two forms; firstly, (for ) with the long instead of the short vowel in the preformative; and secondly, (for ) with a dagheesh supplied in the first radical, instead of doubling the third.\nThe Babylonian conjugation follows almost implicitly the analogy of the Hebrew, and the Behistun Inscription thus presents us with both forms. *Yadduku*, in fact, would be written in Hebrew as \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2, while \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc aduku, which we shall subsequently meet with, must be compared with \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2. In the expression ana Barziya, the particle is used like the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea merely to mark the object of the verb; but in the following phrase, \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4, it must rather stand for \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea, \u201cto.\u201d The noun with which it is joined, and which answers throughout this Inscription to the Persian k\u0101ra, constitutes one of the many difficulties of Babylonian writing which I am still unable to resolve. I can hardly believe that such a term as hvaku could have been used for \u201cthe people,\u201d and yet I can give no other phonetic rendering to \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4, nor can I explain the signs in any way ideographically. As far as its use is concerned, it answers in every respect to the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea.\n\nThe words which follow \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4, are unfortunately mutilated. They consist, however, I believe, of the negative particle \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea, and of a passive or participial form of a root, answering to the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2, \u201cto know.\u201d\n\nI was, for a long time, owing to the mutilation both of the Persian and Scythic texts, uncertain as to the meaning and etymology of the verb which is used in this and similar passages, but I am now satisfied that the word niya must be lost at the commencement of line 32 of the Persian text, and that the word azadd\u00e1, which follows, must signify \u201cknown,\u201d being a derivation from \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea. In the mutilated Scythic text\n\n---\n\n1 That the root dabak was in use as well as duk is shown by the form of the participle in Assyrian, which is usually written \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 vadakik, or \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 vadakiku. See Brit. Mus., 17, 8; 76, 5; and Khur. revers, passim.\n\n2 It would of course be more correct etymologically to translate azad\u00e1 by \u201cunknown,\u201d supposing the initial a to be the privative particle; and in this par-\nwe have merely \\( \\text{ anni tarnas} \\), \"non fuit,\" but the term \\( \\text{ azadda} \\), which answers to azadda, and signifies \"known,\" may be restored with safety before anni. The letter \\( \\text{ la} \\), then, which is clearly to be read in the Babylonian translation, must be recognised as the term that commonly interchanges with \\( \\text{ val} \\) for the particle of negation, the one form being read as val, and the other as la, and the same relation existing between them which unites the Hebrew \\( \\text{ \u05e0\u05d1} \\) and \\( \\text{ \u05e0\u05d1} \\). I cannot venture to complete orthographically the word ending in \\( \\text{ \u05d9\u05d0} \\), which follows \\( \\text{ \u05d9\u05d0} \\) and signifies \"known,\" but I can cite some cognate derivatives and show their common connexion with the root \\( \\text{ \u05d9\u05d0} \\).\n\nThe Persian phrase adatiya azada bawatiya, which occurs at Nakhsh-i-Rustam, and signifies \"then shall it be known to thee,\" is thus rendered in Scythic by \\( \\text{ \u05d9\u05d0} \\), \"tunc cognitum sit tibi,\" and in Babylonian by \\( \\text{ \u05d9\u05d0} \\), the last word, which I read yavvadakka, meaning \"it shall be known to thee,\" and being, I think, the 3rd pers. sing. future of the passive form of vadak, with the suffix of the 2nd person added.\\(^1\\) The same verb is found,\n\n\\(^1\\) This word may rather, perhaps, be read yavvaldakka for yanvaldakka, and may be identified with the passive causative form of the root vadak.

I conjecture, how-\n\n\u00b9 I should have expected barataniya for the infinite form; but there may have been an initial n, answering to the Sanscrit YYY, and preserved in the modern Persian (\u0657\u0648\u062f\u0631\u062f\u0646) awardan, \u201cto bring.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 But see the note on the last page.\never, that in the conjugation of this verb two cognate roots were employed, *dakak* and *duk*: it is, at any rate, to hollow verbs only that I can refer that large class of Babylonian and Assyrian vocables to which the term belongs, and which have the sign for their middle radical. *Diyaki* might very well be derived from *duk*, as comes from , from , &c.; but it would be impossible to obtain such a form from *dakak*, according to any principles of Hebrew or Arabic conjugation. That there may again have been such a root as *duk* interchanging with *dakak*, we are warranted in believing, from the large proportion of Hebrew roots which take both the hollow and the double form, and also from being able to refer to existing hollow roots, most of those other terms in the Inscriptions which are immediately analogous to *diyaki*, such as , , , *miyati*, from , \u201cto die;\u201d , , , *biyasu* from , \u201cto be bad;\u201d , , , *kiyanu*, from , \u201cto set;\u201d , , , *piyali*, from (or ), \u201cto roll,\u201d &c., &c., &c.\n\nThe construction, it is true, of such terms, especially where they represent past participles, is not to be immediately traced in Hebrew; but, admitting that the Babylonian particularly affected the change of the into , as the middle stem letter, we may then compare , (perhaps pronounced *diki*, or simply *dik*, in preference to *diyaki*) with , which would be the past participle of a root *duk*. The forms of , and are so often confounded in the Behistun Inscription, that I cannot venture to assign to the terminations in *i* and in *u* the numerical distinction which might \u2018prim\u00e2 facie\u2019 be supposed to belong to them.\n\nOf the eighth clause we have merely the commencement,\u2014 , \u201cthen Cambyses to Egypt;\u201d and in the ninth also, which reads in the Persian, *yath\u00e1 Kubujiya Mudr\u00e1yam ashiyara, pasdra k\u00e1ra arika abava*, \u201cwhen Cambyses went to Egypt, then the state became wicked,\u201d there are several deficiencies.

In Tiphal forms of , indeed, the conjunctive characteristic would require, I think, to be doubled, to compensate for the lapse of the first radical.\nin the Behistun Inscriptions, but is, I believe, without any correspondent in the other Semitic languages. The regular Kal future, 3rd person singular, is yaprusu; the Pi\u0113l form of the same is yaparra\u1e63; the Pi\u0113l participle is hwaparra\u1e63i, or hwaparra\u1e63u. The Ifta\u02bfal participle is vaparris, and the plural noun is parsat. These forms are not less valuable for grammatical illustration, than for the classification of the sibilant characters: they furnish us, indeed, with five out of the six normal characters belonging to the Samech, and determinately connect the signs in the same phonetic category. The noun parsat, I may add, is precisely similar to dinat, being inflected with the plural termination appropriated in Hebrew and Arabic to the feminine gender.\n\nFor \"abounded\" or \"became abundant,\" we have one of those redundant expressions in which all the Semitic languages delight. The phrase, means literally, \"abundantly they abounded;\" madu and yamidu being derivatives from the same root, which root, in Hebrew, is written or , and is used with the kindred meaning of \"length,\" or \"extension.\" I cannot positively explain the sign which is prefixed to madu. In Assyrian, or , pronounced probably as lu, is very commonly used as a mere pleonastic particle, without in any way altering the sense of the sentence; here, however, I should rather take to be a preposition prefixed to the theme madu, in order to form an adverb; and presuming that the sign has its normal power of lu, should thus compare it with the Hebrew in . Of the term we have many different forms in the trilingual Inscriptions: or . \"many kings;\" .\n\"many lawgivers;\" \"many buildings,\" (W.'s D. l. 12, &c.), the termination in ut representing in all these forms, the masculine plural; while the fem. plur. is found in the expression mati modet, \"many countries\" given in Westergaard's H., l. 6. The orthography of yamidu, for the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3 shows us the facility with which the u and i interchange in Babylonian, and exposes at the same time, the inconvenience in the Cuneiform alphabet, of being unable to distinguish between the long and short vowels, a defect, owing to which there are no means of marking that increased weight in the preformative, which the Hebrew employs to compensate for the loss of duplication.* Yamidu from madad, may be compared, however, with aduku from dakak; and the masculine termination in u agreeing with the feminine(!) noun parsat, may be cited as an instance of the same careless construction which I have before noticed in explaining the words dinat hveasagu.\n\nThe entire paragraph will thus read:\n\n\"Says Darius the king: this is what I have done, after that I have become the king. [A man named Cambyses, son of Cyrus, of our race, before me] this one was here the king; of this Cambyses, his brother was Bardes; one was their father; one was their mother; [then Cambyses slew this Bardes; when] Cambyses slew Bardes, then to the people it was not known(!) that Bardes had been killed; then Cambyses to Egypt [proceeded; when Cambyses to] Egypt went, then the people fell into sin(?); then throughout the countries lies abundantly abounded, both in Persia and in Media [and in the other provinces].\n\n* I am now rather inclined to think that there is a distinction between and , the former being sounded as ya with the short vowel, and the latter as ye with the long.\nThe eleventh paragraph commences with, \"Says Darius the king: Then a Magian named Gomates arose from Pissiachada, the hill named\nAracadres, from thence.\" The first Babylonian word that can be traced answers to *udapalattu*, \"he arose.\" It should probably be restored to *yaiba*, and should be regarded as a cognate derivative with *yaibaveva*, which is the form used in all other passages. I am not quite sure of the etymology of these terms, but I conjecture them to be Tiphal forms of a root corresponding with the Hebrew *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3*. The words *yaiba*, singular, and *yatbuni*, plural, are at any rate commonly used in Assyrian for \"he came,\" and \"they came;\" and it might be supposed, moreover, from the example of *yaillakkan*, that the Tiphal conjugation in Babylonian affected the duplication of the second radical, which would sufficiently explain *yaibaveva*. *Yaiba* and *yatbuni*, also, might be compared with the Hebrew pr\u00e6terite forms *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3* and *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b2\u05d3\u05d5\u05bc* (1 Sam. xxv. 8,) and the only difficulty would thus be to account for the Babylonian version, which usually follows the Persian original with rigorous exactitude, having modified the sense from \"arising,\" to \"coming.\"\n\nThe names of \"Pisiakhuvadu\" and \"Arakatri,\" do not require any special explanation, but I may observe of the latter, that instead of having the determinative before it, as is the universal rule in expressing the names of cities, rivers, and countries, it is followed by the signs *a* *m* *n* *n*, which denote \"a mountain,\" and which, if pronounced phonetically, I would propose to read *tav*, comparing the term with the Egyptian *TAT*.

I am not quite sure of the etymology of these terms, but I conjecture them to be Tiphal forms of a root corresponding with the Hebrew *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3*. The words *yatba*, singular, and *yatbuni*, plural, are at any rate commonly used in Assyrian for \"he came,\" and \"they came;\" and it might be supposed, moreover, from the example of *yalakk\u0101n*, that the Tiphal conjugation in Babylonian affected the duplication of the second radical, which would sufficiently explain *yaibaveva*. *Yaiba* and *yatbuni*, also, might be compared with the Hebrew pr\u00e6terite forms *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3* and *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b2\u05d3* (1 Sam. xxv. 8,) and the only difficulty would thus be to account for the Babylonian version, which usually follows the Persian original with rigorous exactitude, having modified the sense from \"arising,\" to \"coming.\"\n\nThe names of \"Pisiakhuvadu\" and \"Arakatri,\" do not require any special explanation, but I may observe of the latter, that instead of having the determinative before it, as is the universal rule in expressing the names of cities, rivers, and countries, it is followed by the signs *a*, which denote \"a mountain,\" and which, if pronounced phonetically, I would propose to read *tae*, comparing the term with the Egyptian *TAT*. The next word, *sum*, is a monogram for \"name,\" and is, I think, to be read *sum*, like the Chaldee *sum*.

These words correspond in use with the Hebrew } \\text{but I have been unable to come to any trustworthy opinion as to their pronunciation*.\n\nThe date which follows is expressed in Babylonian by \\( \\text{, the signs } \\text{and } \\text{serving as monograms for the words \"day\" and \"month.\" The first of these monograms is variously employed in the Inscriptions. United with the determinative for \"a god,\" and augmented by a qualitative epithet } \\text{, it denotes \"the sun,\" the real meaning of } \\text{being thus, as I think, \"the bright god of day.\" It is perhaps, the same monogram which occurs in the Behistun phrase, } \\text{, for daragam jaiea, \"mayst thou live long;\" or \"may thy days be prolonged;\" and again, in the phrase } \\text{, \"from remote days,\" } \\text{being here often written as } \\text{, and a fair presumption arising, therefore, that the reading is yomi (or yommi) rukuti.}\n\n* There can be no doubt, but that \\( \\text{in this passage and in many others, signifies \"there,\" or \"that place.\" meanings which it is very difficult to connect with the Chaldee } \\text{; nevertheless, I shall still continue to read } \\text{as qabi, until some more suitable explanation can be given.\n\n1 No great weight after all attaches to this example, for it seems pretty certain that the sign \\( \\text{can be used instead of } \\text{to represent the plural termination of nouns without any reference to its phonetic value. Of more importance\nFor the phonetic rendering however of (commonly written in Assyrian as ) I have, I confess, no authority. There is hardly a single document, historical, religious, architectural, or legal, throughout the whole extensive range of the Assyrian and Babylonian Inscriptions, in which we do not find mention of a monthly date, but never have I yet met with a phonetic reading for the word \"month,\" and my comparison of the term accordingly, with the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, is a mere conjecture. The use of for the numeral 14 is sufficiently intelligible, and the sign , which follows, is the mere mark of the ordinal number. This sign is phonetically kam, (as for instance, in the first syllable of the name of Cambyses,) but it is hardly probable that it should have that power when attached to numerals. In such a position, however, it is very commonly replaced in Assyrian and cursive Babylonian by , which has the nearly similar value of kan, and its claim, therefore, to a phonetic employment, cannot be altogether rejected.\n\nThe month of Viyakhana is represented in Babylonian by the signs , which I am altogether unable to explain. Although, indeed, I have already formed a list of more than twenty different names for the Assyrian months, and have thus obtained sufficient grounds for doubting that a year depending on a system of lunations, could have existed in the Assyrian calendar, I have not yet succeeded in iden-\n\nwould be the phrase, answering to \"then,\" and expressed by or (meaning, probably, \"in die illo,\" or \"in diebus illis;\") for as the letter is a labial congener with , it would seem almost certain that the preceding must end in a homogeneous consonant, the reading, in fact, being as yommu su, or as yommi su; but, on the other hand, it is quite unusual to find the pronoun su applying indifferently to the singular and plural number, and the orthography, moreover, sometimes occurs of , which can hardly be read as yommi, as the represents exclusively the sound of bi.\ntifying the names with other Semitic correspondents, nor in ascertaining even upon what principles the divisions of time were arranged among the inhabitants of Babylon and Nineveh.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe last word in line 15, seems to be \\( \\text{\\textit{thakatd}} \\), \"then,\" or \"at that time.\"\n\nOf the fifth clause nothing is visible but the last word, \\( \\text{\\textit{Cambyses}} \\).\n\nThe sixth clause is complete. \"Then all the people from Cambyses rebelled,\" is expressed by \\( \\text{\\textit{akhar hvaki gabbi lapani, Kam-buziya yattikru}} \\). In examining the word gabbi, \"all,\" I have been led to suspect the existence of a certain phonetic relationship between the Babylonian and Hebrew, which, if verified by subsequent research, will serve to explain many difficulties. It seems to me, then, that the final \\( l \\) of the Hebrew, is constantly softened in Babylonian to the vowel \\( u \\) or \\( i \\); gabbi, \"all,\" thus standing for gabbal, and being equivalent to \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\), the true form of \\( \\text{\\textit{gabu}} \\), while the root gabah or gabu, \"to say,\" will in the same way stand for gabal, and be equivalent to \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\).\\(^2\\) It is, at any rate, impossible to avoid noticing the coincidence between the double meaning of \"all,\" and \"saying,\" appertaining to the Cuneiform \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\), and the phonetic assimilation of \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\), and \\( \\text{\\textit{gabu}} \\), which are the Hebrew words possessing those respective significations. Gabbi is used in the trilingual Inscriptions indifferently\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Since writing the above, I have examined some Assyrian Calendars brought by Mr. Layard from Nineveh, and I find that the year did consist of twelve lunations, of thirty days each. The same name, therefore, must be represented by variant monograms.\n\n\\(^2\\) With this indication, I would venture also to compare \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\) and \\( \\text{\\textit{gabu}} \\) with \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\) or \\( \\text{\\textit{gabu}} \\), with which they certainly coincide very nearly in use, and would thus assign to the letter \\( \\text{\\textit{gab}} \\) or \\( \\text{\\textit{gabu}} \\) the phonetic power of \\( qa \\).\nfor haruwa and viswa; and there can be no doubt, therefore, as to its meaning. It is also, however, attached in Babylonian to plural nouns as a pleonastic, and perhaps a non-phonetic, affix; (compare \n\nLapani, \"from,\" has been already explained as the orthographical correspondent of '\u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9. In its use however it rather resembles \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9.\n\nYattikru', \"they rebelled,\" stands for yantikru', and is the 3rd person masculine plural of the Ifta'al form of a root, which is absolutely identical with the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2, \"not to know,\" or \"to reject.\" It may be interesting to compare the following derivatives from the root in question, all of which are found in the Inscription of Behistun.\n\nyattikru' (for yantikrun).

Kal future of a root corresponding with \"to go;\" (compare \"a way;\" Arabic \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642 &c.) I have not yet been able to ascertain the laws which determined, in the Assyrian and Babylonian verb, the pointing of the second radical of the future form, but I apprehend there was the same uncertainty in this respect which we find in the conjugation of the Arabic verb. At any rate, Kal futures are met with in Babylonian pointed with the \\( a \\), the \\( i \\), and the \\( u \\), in the middle stem letter, without any apparent grammatical distinction. Yatriku' is a perfectly regular form, the first radical being sharpened owing to the jem, and the final replacing, probably, a primitive \\( n \\).\n\nThe eighth and ninth clauses are lost, with the exception of the verb \\( yassabat \\), \"be seized.\" Yassabat comes from a root \\( sabat \\), \"to seize,\" which is identical with the Arabic verb \u0636\u0628\u0637, and with a root \\( \u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 \\), which Gesenius conjectures to have existed in Hebrew, with the sense of \"grasping\" (with the hand). In the trilingual Inscriptions, this verb generally appears with the 1st radical doubled; (compare 1st person singular \\( assabat \\); 3rd person \\( yassabat \\); and active participle \\( vassabbitu \\), or \\( vassabbit \\);) and there is no rule in Hebrew which will account for such an orthography, for I can hardly suppose verbs implying direct action to be of the Niphal conjugation. It may be that there was an intensive conj. in Babylonian, which was marked by the doubling of the first radical, or the duplication may have been owing to a mere careless orthography.\\(^1\\) The true Kal form of \\( sabat \\) is, at any rate, sometimes\n\n\\(^1\\) In the rendering of proper names, at any rate, we see that the Babylonians doubled the consonants as they pleased, without any regard to the orthography\nused in the trilingual Inscriptions, for we have at Nakhsh-i-Rustam the orthography of \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, for the Persian agarb\u0101yam, \"I seized.\" In the Assyrian Inscriptions, also, this is the conjugation usually employed; compare the future forms \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4 and \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4; active participle \u1f01\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, or \u1f01\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1; and passive part. (Hiphil) \u1f01\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9; and remark, that the verb has the double signification of \"seizing,\" and \"establishing,\" which appertains to the root in Arabic. Possibly, too, in the Assyrian records, forms of \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4 may sometimes be confounded with derivatives from \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, \"to give.\"\n\nThe last clause is as follows:\u2014\n\nakhar Kambujiya mitu, tura mannisu miyati, the corresponding Persian phrase being pasdva Kambujiya svamarshiyush, \"then Cambyses, self-wishing to die, died;\" mitu, must be here accordingly, the rarely-used pr\u00e6terite form of \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, answering to \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, (or supposing a plural form to be used, to \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4), and the three following words must answer to svamarshiyush, which signifies literally, \"self-wishing to die.\" I conjecture, then, that tura is a pr\u00e6terite form of the substantive verb, cognate with attur, aturu, yattur, yat-turun, &c.; that \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, which I read doubtfully as mannisu\u00b9,\n\nof the Persian originals; and it would be too much, therefore, to expect from them a rigorous attention to grammatical rule in representing their own language.\n\n\u00b9 I can hardly believe that \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4 really represents the particle \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4, notwithstanding the applicability of such an explanation to this phrase, for I have never met with min, \"from,\" written phonetically in any other passage of the Inscription. I should rather suspect \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4 to represent a noun in combination with the suffix of the 3rd person. It is possible, indeed, as \u1f00\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4 and\nmust signify \"his wish,\" and that \\( \\text{miyati} \\), (possibly miti or mit,) is either the infinitive absolute or the construct noun, which in Hebrew would be written \\( \\text{mi} \\).\n\nThe analogy, at the same time, of \\( \\text{diyaki} \\) and similar forms would seem to point out miyati, (or mit,) as a participle corresponding with \\( \\text{mi} \\), and I give accordingly the variant translation of tura, \"he became,\" mannisu, from himself,\" miyati, \"dead.\"\n\nThe translation of the eleventh paragraph will stand as follows:\u2014\n\n[\"Says Darius the king: there was a Magian named Gomates; he arose from Pisiachadia, the mountain of Aracadres from thence, in the fourteen day of the month \\( \\text{at} \\), at [that time he appeared; He falsely declared to the state, I am Bardes, the son of Cyrus and brother of] Cambyses; then all the people revolted against Cambyses and went over to him (Bardes); both Persia and Media [and the other provinces; on the ninth day of the month \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 the empire this Bardes] seized; then Cambyses died; he committed suicide, (or \"his death was from himself.\")]\n\n---\n\nPar. 12.\n\n* Da ri ya vas. melek.

We have the termination of the second clause, answering to the Persian *aita khshatram hach\u0101 parusiyata am\u0101kham taumdy\u0101 aha*, \"that empire had been in our family from antiquity,\" but it is quite impossible to fix the orthography of some of the principal words, and etymological speculation, therefore, would be worse than useless. I should wish to suppose the phrase *SEY SEY* to signify \"from the olden time,\" *SEY* being the same word which occurs under the forms of *SEY*; or *SEY* or *SEY* in other passages, in reference to time; and the following word being a qualitative epithet used like *SEY* or *SEY* with the signification of \"former,\" or \"remote;\" but there is no certainty in the orthography of either of the words; and to add to our embarrassment, if the form of *SEY* be correct, it is so nearly identical with a term which occurs in paragraph 14, for the possessive pronoun of the 1st pers. plur., that notwithstanding the position which it here occupies before the noun, it would be most natural to connect it with *SEY*, and to consider these words as a translation of *am\u0101kham taumdy\u0101*. The expression *SEY*\nat any rate, means \"of our family,\" as in line 3, and the last word of the sentence, must, accordingly, be the verb answering to aka. How this term, however, which is written \\( \\text{sign} \\), is to be pronounced, I am quite unable to conjecture, for each of the signs which compose it has several independent powers, and I have not recognized any cognate forms elsewhere.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe third clause of the Babylonian does not precisely follow the Persian original. Instead of \"After Gomates, the Magian, had dispossessed Cambyses of Persia, Media, and the other provinces;\" the Babylonian construction would seem to be, \"After Gomates, the Magian, had transferred the empire to himself.\" \\( \\text{sign} \\) at any rate, which follows the name of Gomates the Magian, signifies \"the empire,\" and the particle \\( \\text{sign} \\) which closes line 18, must govern a noun or pron. at the commencement of the following line. The names of \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) Gomata, and \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) Magusu, are valuable on the score of orthography; and the compound\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I observe, in many passages of this Inscription, an extraordinary similarity between suffixed pronouns of the 3rd person and forms of the substantive verb, a similarity which strikingly resembles the presumed relationship in Hebrew between the pronouns \\( \\text{sign} \\) and \\( \\text{sign} \\) and the verbs \\( \\text{sign} \\) and \\( \\text{sign} \\). In line 3, \\( \\text{sign} \\) sun, seems to be used for \"have been.\" The common phrase \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) which precedes the dates, may mean \"these were.\" \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) sina, in the same way, in line 106, replaces the substantive verb in the fem. plural, and \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) siga, in the present passage must, I think, be similarly explained as standing for the fem. sing. I conjecture, accordingly, that the suffix of the 3rd person, agreeing with its antecedent in gender and number, was optionally used in Babylonian for the substantive verb; and I thus define \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) \\( \\text{sign} \\) siga as the suffix of the 3rd person singular, answering to the Hebrew \\( \\text{sign} \\) and put in the feminine gender to agree with the nominative melkut or sarvut, \"empire.\"\nterm hagaswa which connects them is a further illustration of the use of the pronoun for the article, although in this case a demonstrative form is employed rather than a relative. At the commencement of the next line, we have some of the words corresponding to the Persian phrase huwa ayast\u0101 uwdipshiyam akut\u0101, but they are too doubtful and imperfect to be worth analyzing. The fourth clause, suva ana melek yattur, \"he became the king,\" requires no comment.\n\nThe Babylonian fragments will thus read:\n\n\"Says Darius the king: [the empire of which Gomates, the Magian, dispossessed Cambyses] from the olden time had been in our family; after Gomates, the Magian, had transferred the empire to [himself, both Persia and Media, and the other provinces, he did] as he pleased: he became the king.\"\n\nPar. 13.

Manma is a negative pronoun, compounded of man, \"any one,\" (comp Chal. \"whosoever,\") and the negative ma, \"not,\" corresponding with the Arabic \\( \\text{L} \\). Many examples occur of the employment of the pronoun; as in the phrase already quoted from the Koyunjik Bulls, P. xxxi. 2, and in a passage of the E. I. Ins. col. 6. l. 24., \n\\[ \\text{da manama sarru makhri la yabusu}, \\] \"which no king did before me;\" and its etymology is made out quite satisfactorily. Y\u00e1nu, also, must be cognate with, or rather a more ancient form of, the Hebrew \\( \\text{N} \\). It would seem to be a regular 3rd person future of a root anah, which we may suppose to correspond with \\( \\text{N} \\) or \\( \\text{N} \\) in Hebrew. A portion of the second clause is lost; but we have the concluding phrase, \"who would deprive Gomates, the Magian, of the empire;\" and we here find the Babylonian verb \\( \\text{yakkimu} \\), answering to ditam chakhriyd. Now, yakkimu must stand for yankimu, and the root, therefore, would seem to be the same as the Hebrew \\( \\text{P} \\). Whether, however, we are to translate \"there was no one to vindicate the empire,\" or whether nakam may not have signified in Babylonian, \"rescuing,\" rather than \"avenging,\" I cannot pretend to say, as I have found very few undoubted instances of the employment of this\n\n1 Etymologically it would be proper to translate manma by \"aliquis,\" rather than by \"nemo,\" for the Hebrew \\( \\text{N} \\), which is the original of the Arabic \\( \\text{L} \\), has a mere indefinite sense, corresponding, in fact, exactly with the indefinite affix chiga, in the compound pronoun chishchiga, which is the Persian equivalent to \\( \\text{E} \\); but, on the other hand, I observe that manma is only employed where the action is negative, and the double negative is quite agreeable to Semitic usage.\n\n2 For the cursive rendering of this line, see Bellino's Cyl., side 2, line 4.\nverb in other Inscriptions. The third clause signifies, I think, \"the State feared him greatly,\" the sense being slightly altered from the hach\u00e1 darshata atarea of the Persian. madu, at any rate, must be the word which everywhere answers to wasiya, and which has been already examined in line 14; la pani su, \"from him,\" is self-evident, and the concluding word can only be the 3rd person future of a verb signifying \"to fear.\" I have great difficulty, however, in identifying the root from which this form is derived, owing to the doubtful power of the sign. From the context, I should wish to read the verb as yaptikhat, and to regard it as an Ifsa'al form of \"to fear,\" but I have not yet been able to verify the attribution to the sign of the secondary power of khat or khad.\n\nThe commencement of the 21st line is too doubtful to admit of being analyzed.

Ins., col. 7, l. 21, and 8, l. 18.\n\n2 The letter is a variant for as the monogram for \"a house;\" and it has thus several phonetic values, such as bit, mai, &c., in common with that sign; but I suspect that the two characters have also independent powers. At any rate, the verb which occurs in this passage, cannot possibly have the same meaning as the term used in line 22 of the Nakhsh-i-Rustam Inscription, which, however, if and were phonetically identical, would have every appearance of being a cognate Ifsa'al form.\n\n3 Mons. Oppert's amended readings of the Behistun Inscription are now in the course of publication in the Journal Asiatique. His learning is undoubted, and some of his corrections are important; but a large portion of his criticism is to be found in my Behistun Vocabulary, the 1st volume of which was published in\ncharacters can alone be clearly traced, is derived from the root duk or dakak, \"to smite,\" and that it answers to the Persian avdjaniva. The term which follows is quite irrecoverable. We have then, apparently, for m\u0101tya khshands\u0101tiya, \"lest it should be discovered,\" la hvama\u0161anu, the first word being the negative particle, and the second a passive participle from a root masan, which I am quite unable to identify.1 The next phrase is easy. \"That I am not Bardes, the son of Cyrus,\" is rendered by sa la Barsiya anaku barsu sa Kuras, \"quod non Bardes ego [sum] filius ejus qui Cyri.\" The term for \"son,\" is here represented by the monogram , which was perhaps pronounced bar, and the suffix of the 3rd person is added, as in the phrase sa Kambuziya akhisu, which has been already examined. Affiliation is thus usually expressed in Babylonian by \"son his of;\" but sometimes a variant monogram, , is employed, or the mere sign of the genitive is considered sufficient to mark the relationship.\n\nThe 5th clause is rendered by Mons. Oppert, after the Persian text, \"no one dared to say anything of Gomates, the Magian,\"\n\n1849, but of the very existence of which Mons. Oppert seems, nevertheless, to be completely ignorant.\n\n1 As there appear to have been no signs of the class of sibilants, appropriated to the syllables yai and cat, the corresponding signs of the D class (namely, and ) were necessarily used in conjunction with , , and , but for the syllable ai there was a distinct character ; and wherever, accordingly, we find the assimilating with the la, li or lu, (as in this word ) it must be considered an instance of careless orthography.\nand this amended reading is, no doubt, perfectly correct. In the Babylonian we have merely the commencement of the sentence \n\\[ \\text{val. ya -- va. as. eli;} \\] \nand owing to my having failed, up to the present time, to ascertain the power of the compound sign \n\\[ \\text{I am neither able to identify the verb } \\text{nor to determine positively, whether it means \"saying\" or \"daring.\"} \\]\n\nI should think, however, that \n\\[ \\text{answered to niya adarshanaush, \"non ausus est;\" for there is a participle, derived apparently from the same root, which is applied to the god } \\text{and to which, accordingly, the sense of \"daring\" is more applicable than that of \"saying.\" The compound particle as eli must be here} \\]\n\n---\n\n1 The following are the materials I have collected for determining the power of \n\\[ \\text{In the annals of the Koyunjik king, it stands for the numeral 3.}\\]\nIn the Khursabad Inscriptions, the term \n\\[ \\text{commonly interchanges with }\\]\nThe word \n\\[ \\text{signifies \"he dared.\" The standard epithet applied to the god at Khursabad is }\\]\nThe sign \n\\[ \\text{is also a common element in Babylonian names; compare }\\]\n\\[ \\text{\"Nebo \u2014, the son of Nalazu,\"(?) referring to the chief placed by Esar Haddon in charge of Babylonia, (British Museum, 22, 50;) and the Babylonian king, }\\]\n\\[ \\text{\"\u2014 \u2014 Merodach, the son of }\\text{who gave tribute to the Obelisk king. (See Brit. Mus., 46, 17, and 15, 29.) The name of this king has certainly a striking resemblance to the Messsimordacus of the Canon of Ptolemy; but, on the other hand, chronologically, the identification seems impossible; and I have no authority from etymological sources for thus attributing to the sign the value of sas.}\\]\nused for the Persian *pariya*, which signifies \"about,\" or \"regarding,\" and the noun which it governs, together with the infinitive form of the verb *gabah*, \"to say,\" must be supposed to be lost at the commencement of line 22.\n\nIn the 6th clause, where, for \"then I prayed to Oromasdes,\" we have \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfbc\ud800\udfc1} \\), it is the last word only that requires explanation. This term must, I think, be read *assalla*, \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfbc\ud800\udfc1} \\), which is usually *ki*, having here the secondary power of *as*, and \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\), which usually stands for *ni*, having the power of *sal*. That \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) indeed, represents *salla*, I am satisfied from numerous examples; (compare \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) *salia*, \"battle;\" \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) *salmanu*, \"images;\" \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) *wusalkha*, \"victorious,\" &c.), and the context requiring absolutely that the verb should be in the 1st person singular, I am obliged to supply the value of *as* for the initial syllable.\\(^2\\) *Assalla*, of course, like the\n\n\\(^1\\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) exchanges with \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) or \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\), as the correspondent for *hamaranam*, \"battle,\" throughout the Behistun Inscription. \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\) *salmanu haganut*, \"these images\" (compare Hebrew \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\); Arab. \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa1} \\)) occurs in Behistun Inscription, line 106, where, however, the printed text has an erroneous reading; and for *wusalkha*, \"victorious,\" see the titles of Sargina, [Shalmaneser] in B. M., 33. l. 4.\n\n\\(^2\\) As there are several characters which thus fluctuate between the *l* and *s*, there would seem to be some phonetic law connecting the two classes. At any\nthe cognate forms \u1e63ala, \"worship;\" \u1e63ayla, \"they worshipped,\" &c., is derived from a root answering to \u1e63ab, the doubling of the 1st radical being perhaps dialectic, as in yassabat, &c., and the second duplication indicating the Pi\u0113l conjugation, as in yagabbi, yaparras, yamarru, yatsivva, &c.\n\nThere is nothing more to be noted till we come to the phrase in the next line, answering to the Persian martiy\u0101d fratama anushiy\u0101d, \"his chief followers.\" The Babylonian text is here given as \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba.; \u1e2ba. being a monogram for \"man\" generically; \u1e2ba. the determinative of \"rank;\" \u1e2ba. the name of the particular rank indicated by fratama; (Chaldee \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 Esth. i. 3.) and \u1e2ba. the sign of the plural number. It is impossible of course to determine how this phrase should be pronounced, as not one of the signs composing it is phonetic. The following words, however, read sa yatti, \"who were with him;\"\n\nrate, \u1e2ba. and \u1e2ba. interchange repeatedly: \u1e2ba. is sometimes put for \u1e2ba.: \u1e2ba. seems also to have the power of \u1e2ba.; and I am half inclined to think that what I have hitherto called Liphal and Hitaphal forms, are in reality Shaphel and Istaphal (for Hiphil and Hithpael); the sign \u1e2ba. having the power of \u1e2ba. as well as of \u1e2ba.; for amongst other examples, I observe, that \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. in the 1st pers. seems to answer to \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. in the 3rd; and that \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. and \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. belong apparently to the same tense of the same verb. All this is very puzzling, and can only yield to careful and continued research.\n\n1 The sign \u1e2ba. or \u1e2ba. is constantly used in the Assyrian Inscriptions as determinative of \"a title.\" Compare the word \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba., \"a general,\" (rendered by the Hebrews as \u1e2ba.) also \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba.; \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba.; and perhaps, \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba. \u1e2ba.\nbeing equivalent to the Chaldee \\(\\text{N}\\), and the suffix of the 3rd person being irregularly omitted.\n\nAfter this we have the Babylonian names answering to the Persian Sikta'uwatish, Nisdy'a, and Media, the former being preceded by \\(\\text{N}\\) which is the monogram for \"a city,\" and was probably pronounced \\(ir\\), (Heb. \\(\\text{Y}\\)), and the two latter by \\(\\text{C}\\), or mat, denoting \"a country.\" The two first letters of the name of Sikta'uwatish are a good deal mutilated on the rock: the first, on a careful inspection of the cast, seems to be \\(\\text{N}\\), but the form is hardly made out with sufficient distinctness to authorize the admission of \\(\\text{N}\\) into the Babylonian alphabet with the value of sik: the second letter may be given with more certainty as \\(\\text{C}\\); and that the value of ta appertains to this sign is shown by many other examples, such as \\(\\text{E}\\) \\(\\text{N}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) or \\(\\text{E}\\) \\(\\text{N}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) for Dikta, the \"Tigris;\" \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) or \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) Eluta, for \"Elymais,\" &c., &c. It is to be observed, also, that the Babylonian substitutes the letter \\(\\text{C}\\) in the orthography of this name for the nominatival case-ending of the Persian. There is nothing to be remarked in the names of Nisdy'a and Media, except the duplication of the s in the former name, and the assimilation of the \\(\\text{C}\\) and \\(\\text{C}\\), which, however, do not strictly belong to the same grade among the sibilants. The words answering to \"Ormazd granted me the empire,\" in the last clause, are a mere repetition of the phrase in line 4, with the exception of the word sarrut, \"empire,\" being written as \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) instead of \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\) \\(\\text{C}\\).\n\nThe translation of this paragraph then will be as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Says Darius the king: there was not any one, [not a Persian, nor a Median, nor any one of our family, who] would rescue (or vindicate) the empire from that Gomates, the Magian: the people greatly feared him: [he would slay many people who knew the other Bardes: for that reason] he would slay them 'lest it should be made public that I am not Bardes, who was the son of Cyrus.' No\none dared about [Gomates, the Magian, to say anything, until I arrived:] then I prayed to Ormazd; Ormazd brought help to me: by the grace of Ormazd, [on the 10th day of the month (\u2014\u2014\u2014) with my confederates I slew Gomates.] the Magian, and the leaders of the people who were with (him): In the town of Siktachotes; in the country named Niss\u00e6a, which was in Media [there I slew him: I recovered the empire from him; I became king by the grace of Ormazd:] Ormazd granted me the empire.*\n\nPar. 14. * Da ri ya va\u0161. melek (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014)\nya gab bi. melk u t. sa. la. pa ni.\n\nl. 25 (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014) val ta kan. xi \u0161.\nana ku. e ti bu su. bit i. sa. ilu i. sa.\n\n* Gu m a ta. ha ga su va.

The Persian correspondent is avd\u00e9dyam, and the meaning is \"I established;\" vallakan, therefore, must be the active participle of the Iltaphal conjugation of \u1e63\u0101, a root which is of very frequent employment, both in Assyrian and Baby-\nlonian, with the sense of \"making,\" \"appointing,\" or \"establishing;\" and which exhibits a great variety of forms. The many instances of confusion between letters of the class \\( l \\) and the class \\( s \\), have led me to suspect, as noticed in a preceding page, that the Liphal conjugation in Babylonian may be identical with the Shaphel (Heb. Hiphil), and the Iltaphal with the Istaphal (Heb. Hithpaal); but I have not yet found sufficient evidence to satisfy all my doubts; and I continue, therefore, for the present, to regard the conjugations as distinct. At the same time, that in this particular verb, the Iltaphal conjugation is used precisely with the same causative power as the Shaphel, is shown by a comparison of the following passages from the Trilingual Inscriptions:\n\n1. \\( \\text{sa ki pi. as ku n. su n. di ya ki.} \\)\n   Ad crucem feci eos occisos\n   Behistun, l. 63.\n\n2. \\( \\text{sa ki pi. al ta kan. su. di ya ki} \\)\n   ad crucem feci sum occisum\n   Behistun, l. 60.

It is, however, always difficult to identify those forms of the root \\( \\text{kun} \\), in which the letters \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) are employed as servile letters, in consequence of the orthographical resemblance of such terms to derivatives from the roots \\( \\text{w} \\) and \\( \\text{n} \\). The use of the active participle, in Babylonian as in Arabic, instead of the verb, and without, of course, any distinction of person, is not uncommon. As \\( \\text{waltakam} \\), indeed, here stands for \\( \\text{avastayam} \\), \u201cI established,\u201d so in the corresponding passage of the Inscription of Nakhsh-i-Rustam \\( \\text{vallisi\u0161} \\) (Iltaphal part of \\( \\text{niyashaddayam} \\)) is used for \\( \\text{niyashaddayam} \\). \\( \\text{Vattabit} \\) also, is employed throughout the Behistun Inscription, for \u201cI seized,\u201d or \u201che seized,\u201d and if \\( \\text{vasbusu} \\), be a genuine term in line 19 of Westergaard\u2019s D., it must be explained as the Shaphel participle of \\( \\text{ebas} \\), used instead of the 3rd pers. of the verb.\n\nThe 4th clause, \\( \\text{yath\u00e1 pruvamachiya, awath\u00e1 adam akunavam} \\), \u201cI made it as it was before,\u201d is rendered by \\( \\text{vazag} \\). The first word, which, if it be phonetic, must be read \\( \\text{si} \\), is difficult. I conjecture, however, that it is a noun or construct infinitive from a root \\( \\text{vazag} \\) or \\( \\text{yazag} \\), which signifies \u201cto renew\u201d or \u201crestore,\u201d and which is cognate both with the Hebrew \\( \\text{vazag} \\) and the Arabic \\( \\text{vazag} \\). There is, at any rate, a verbal form in the Nimrud Standard Inscription, line 20, which is certainly a kindred derivative with \\( \\text{vazag} \\) and which suggests the above etymology. This word occurs in the phrase \\( \\text{at the four gates I restored}, \\) and I translate, accordingly, the Behistun phrase by \u201cI made a restoration.\u201d\n\n---\n\n1 The \\( \\text{ya} \\) in \\( \\text{yasa} \\) may be taken as a middle form between \\( \\text{ya} \\) and \\( \\text{ya} \\); at any rate, examples of the \\( \\text{ya} \\) interchanging with gutturals are not uncommon; while the Babylonian \\( \\text{s} \\) is known to be a frequent substitute for the dental, as in the orthography of \\( \\text{Bersiga} \\) for the Persian \\( \\text{Berdiga} \\).\n(or \"a renewing of what was before\"). The verb \\( \\text{etibusu} \\), is of course an Ifta'al form of \\( \\text{ebas} \\), the servile letter \\( \\text{et} \\) being introduced between the 1st and 2nd radical as a conjugational characteristic.\n\nFor the 5th clause, \"the temples which Gomates the Magian had destroyed, I rebuilt,\" we have \\( \\text{ayadand} \\) in the Persian, is rendered by \"the houses of the gods,\" \\( \\text{yabbulu} \\) being the monogram for \"a house,\" with the phonetic power of \\( \\text{bit} \\), and \\( \\text{agur} \\) for \"a god,\" with the phonetic value of \\( \\text{iu} \\). The verb \\( \\text{yabbulu} \\), \"he destroyed,\" is also an interesting word, as it explains a passage of very frequent occurrence in the Historical Inscriptions of Assyria. This passage is usually written \\( \\text{abul} \\), without the duplication of the 1st radical, and we thus see that the derivation is from \\( \\text{abul} \\), rather than from \\( \\text{abul} \\), \"to confound,\" rather than from \\( \\text{abul} \\), \"to wither.\" The double form, indeed, of \\( \\text{abul} \\) and \\( \\text{abul} \\), like \\( \\text{adduk} \\) and \\( \\text{aduku} \\), \\( \\text{attur} \\) and \\( \\text{aturu} \\), determinately includes the root in the class of verbs \\( \\text{yj} \\), and the significations, moreover, of \"destroying\" and \"confounding\" are very nearly allied. The word answering to \\( \\text{niyatdrayam} \\) is unfortunately lost, as indeed is the passage which translates the very difficult commencement of the 6th clause in the Persian text. In that clause the name of Gomates the Magian is perfect, but the verb again, replacing the Persian \\( \\text{adina} \\), is also mutilated. If, however, it be restored to \\( \\text{adina} \\) after the analogy of the correspondent to \\( \\text{adina} \\) in the 2nd clause of the last paragraph, it will show that the Babylonian root signifying \"to take away\" or \"dispossess,\" must be \\( \\text{kamam} \\), rather than \\( \\text{nakam} \\)\u2014that it is allied in\nfact to the Hebrew probably, instead of being identical, as I have before conjectured, with \"to avenge.\" The last word of the clause \\(\\text{sunut}\\), is the masculine plural of the pronoun of the 3rd person, and it agrees with the correspondent to the Persian \\(vithibish\\), whether that term signify \"houses\" or \"families.\"\n\nThe 7th clause, \"I established the state in its place,\" (or \"firmly\") is perfect. The Babylonian phrase is \\(\\text{as ariri}\\), and the only words that have not been previously examined are \\(\\text{as ariri}\\), answering to the Persian \\(g\u0101thw\u0101\\). Now there is the same uncertainty about the signification of the Babylonian \\(asri\\), that has been felt in regard to the Persian \\(g\u0101thw\u0101\\), the verb \\(\\text{from which}\\) \\(\\text{as ariri}\\).\n\n---\n\n1 I may here add a few words on the pronoun of the 3rd person. The masc. singular is \\(\\text{swea} (\\text{NNT})\\): the feminine \\(\\text{siga} (\\text{NYT})\\). The masc. plural is \\(\\text{sunut}\\); the fem. plural, \\(\\text{sinat}\\). The abbreviated forms used as suffixes are, masculine \\(\\text{or}\\) \\(\\text{su}\\), singular; \\(\\text{su}\\), plural: feminine \\(\\text{(?!)}\\) \\(\\text{si}\\), singular; \\(\\text{sin}\\), plural. \\(\\text{Sunuti}\\) and \\(\\text{sinati}\\) are used also for the oblique cases of the plural pronoun, and \\(\\text{sunu}\\) and \\(\\text{sinu}\\) frequently take the place of \\(\\text{su}\\) and \\(\\text{si}\\), for the plural suffix, without involving, I think, any grammatical distinction. With regard to the distinction between \\(\\text{us}\\) and \\(\\text{at}\\), for the masculine and feminine gender of plural, I may observe that a kindred rule of orthography seems to pervade the whole structure of the Babylonian grammar; we have thus, masculine \\(\\text{madut}\\), fem. \\(\\text{madet}\\), \"many;\" \u2014masc. \\(\\text{haganut}\\), fem. \\(\\text{haganet}, \"\\text{these;}\"\\)\u2014masculine \\(\\text{annat}\\) (obl. \\(\\text{anniti}\\)) \"those;\"\u2014masc. \\(\\text{ellut}, \"\\text{gods;}\"\\) fem. \\(\\text{ellit}, \"\\text{goddesses,\" &c. &c.}\\)\nmay very well be derived, having on the one side the sense of \"being firm,\" like the Sanscrit \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928, whilst on the other, from the context of several independent passages, I should be disposed to prefer translating as asrisu by \"in loco ejus,\" precisely as Mons.

In the first place, for the Persian verb hamatakkshiya, we have a term of doubtful orthography; it seems to be written \\(\\text{vapnatikit}\\), and ought, I think, to represent an Ifta'al participle. In its present form, however, it will require to be referred to a quadrilateral root, of which very few examples indeed are to be found in Babylonian, and I am strongly inclined, therefore, to question the genuineness of the second letter. There is certainly a space for one letter on the rock, and there are the remains apparently of the sign \\(\\text{vapnatikit}\\), but this may have been originally an error of the sculptor. Unless indeed the term be read vapnikit, and referred to the Ifta'al conjugation of \\(\\text{vapnikit}\\), \"to look after,\" I can suggest no possible explanation.\n\n\\(\\text{adi eli sa}\\), \"until that,\" or \"so that,\" is already known to us, but the possessive pronoun of the 1st person plural \\(\\text{bit}\\), which is attached to \\(\\text{bit}\\), \"a family,\" is a new word. As attua seems to stand for antua, so must attunu stand for antunu, the only difference being that the singular pronoun terminates in \\(a\\), equivalent to the Hebrew suffix in \\(a\\), while the plural termination is in \\(nu\\), which is absolutely the same as the Hebrew suffix in \\(nu\\), a relic of \\(\\text{nu}\\).\n\nThe Babylonian version of the last clause is opposed, I think, to the reading of Mons. Oppert, who translates yath\u00e1 Gum\u00e1ta hya Magush vitham tydm amdakham niyd par\u00e1bara, by \"before that Gomates the Magian had usurped our country.\" certainly means in other passages \"so as\" or \"according as\" (compare the examples quoted in page vi.), and \\(\\text{yassu}\\) (Hebrew \\(\\text{yassu}\\) from \\(\\text{yassu}\\)) is the exact equivalent of the Persian pardbara, \"he took away.\" The meaning, therefore, of the last clause must be, I think, \"so that our family was not superseded by Gomates the Magian,\" and the entire paragraph may be translated as follows:\u2014\n\"Says Darius the king: the empire which from [our family had been taken away, that I recovered: in its place] I established it: I restored it (or, made it as it was before): the houses of the gods which Gomates the Magian had destroyed, I [rebuilt; I again entrusted the sacred rites, the chanting, and the sacrifice, to the parties whom] Gomates the Magian had deprived of their holy offices: I established the State in its place (or, I put it in order). By the grace of Ormazd I made as they were before, Persia, Media, [and the other provinces: I restored to them that which had been taken away:] by the grace of Ormazd I did this: I made arrangements until that our family in its place I established: [as it was before, so I arranged matters] by the grace of Ormazd, that our family was not displaced by Gomates the Magian.\"\n\nOf the 15th paragraph, which reads \"Says Darius the king: this is what was done by me after that I became king,\" nothing is preserved in the Babylonian but the name of Darius.\n\n---\n\nPar. 16. l. 29 * Da ri ya vaq.\n\nmelek ( ). ya gab bi. al la. sa.\n\nana ku. a du ku. a na. * Gu ma ta. *\n\nMa gu su. akhar. ish.

Perhaps it signifies literally, \"at the time that,\" \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e63a being the preposition \u1e0d\u00e1\u1e63\u1e63a denoting time, and \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e63a being equivalent to \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e63a. As I have never met, however, with any other examples of this compound adverb, I cannot be sure that I have analysed it correctly; or even that it is intended to be read phonetically. \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e63a adduku, is also to be remarked as a variant form of \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e63a adduku, the root \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e63a, as I have already observed, forming its future\neither with or without the *dagheh*. Another novelty is the employment of \\(\\text{\\textit{magusu}}\\), the monogram for \u201ca man,\u201d to connect *Gomata* and *Magusu*, instead of the pronoun *hagasuva*. The sign in question is here used simply as a non-phonetic determinative before \\(\\text{\\textit{magusu}}\\).\n\nAt the end of the line, \\(\\text{\\textit{martiya}}\\) answers to the Persian *martiya*, and is to be read probably as \\(\\text{\\textit{martiya}}\\) or \\(\\text{\\textit{martiya}}\\). The last word of the 2nd clause, which is *udapatata* in the Persian, and which signifies \u201che arose,\u201d is rendered in the Babylonian by \\(\\text{\\textit{yatbava}}\\), a kindred form with the term *yatbd*, which I had occasion to examine in line 15.\\(^1\\) I suppose it to be the 3rd person singular masculine of the Tiphal future of \\(\\text{\\textit{yad}}\\), the duplication of the second radical being characteristic of this as well as of the Pi\u00ebl conjugation, and the sense being modified by the change of conjugation from \u201ccoming,\u201d to \u201carising.\u201d (Compare the Hebrew noun \\(\\text{\\textit{yad}}\\), \u201cproduce,\u201d or \u201cthat which springs up from the earth.\u201d)\n\nIn the 3rd clause the Persian term *awatd*, \u201cthus,\u201d is rendered by \\(\\text{\\textit{kima}}\\), which, in accordance with Semitic analogies, I would propose to read as *kima*, comparing it with the Hebrew adverb \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\). The letter \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\), at any rate, although representing primarily the sound of *m* or *v* after *u*, belongs certainly, in its secondary use, to the guttural class, for it constantly interchanges with \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\) and \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\), and I believe, moreover, that we constantly meet, in the Inscriptions of Assyria, with the Babylonian \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\), signifying \u201cso\u201d or \u201clike,\u201d under the form of \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\) or \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\).\n\nThe name of \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\), which is usually applied to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) If it were possible to obtain for the letter \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\) the secondary power of *ka*, I should of course prefer reading this word as *yatkamma*, and deriving it from \\(\\text{\\textit{ka}}\\); but I have met with no other authority for such a phonetic value, and I cannot venture to adopt it on a single example.\nSusiana, and which is, I feel tolerably sure, composed of ideographs, has been remarked on in my notes to the 6th paragraph. It is worth while, however, to observe the form of \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] for \"the people of Susiana,\" the addition of the plural sign to the proper name of the country being held to be sufficient to indicate the gentile epithet.\n\nIn line 31 we first meet with the orthography of \u2014 \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] for the Persian Naditabira, and are thus enabled to attach to the sign \\[\\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] (incorrectly printed in the text as \\[\\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\]) the power of di, and to identify the compound character \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] (contraction of \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\]) as the monogram for the god Bil (Hebrew \\[\\text{\u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05dc}\\]). The name seems to have been commonly used among the Babylonians, as it is found repeated several times on a cylinder published by Grotefend (Zeitschrift, Tom. iii. p. 179), and it may be interpreted as \"the gift of Bel,\" nadita being equivalent to the Hebrew \\[\\text{\u05e0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8}\\], \"a liberal gift.\" Ezek. 16. 23.\n\nThe name of the father of Naditabelus, which is lost both in the Persian and Scythic versions, is preserved in the Babylonian, as \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] Aniri. The only other word to be noticed in line 31 is \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] yaparras, the 3rd person masculine singular of the Pi\u0113l future of paras, \"to lie,\" a root from which we have already met with another derivative in the plural noun \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\] par\u1e63at, \"lies.\"\n\nIn line 32 the first word is doubtful. The analogy of line 16, where we have the two verbs yatirku' and yattikru' in immediate juxtaposition, would lead us to expect that yattikir would in this place be preceded by yattirik, the 3rd person singular masculine of the Ifs'a\u0142 form of \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\], and it is very possible that the 3rd character in the line may be \\[\\text{\u0161e\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u} \\text{\u0161a\u0161u}\\], which seems in Assyrian to have the power of rik. At any rate, the term which follows the name of Babylon is to be read yattikir for yantikir, and is to be\nexplained as the 3rd person singular masculine of the Ifta'al form of \"to rebel.\" There seems to be no fixed rule in Babylonian with regard to the employment or suppression of the final vowel in many of the future forms. The 3rd person plural, both of the masculine and feminine gender, is marked by the letter , which replaces a primitive n, but in the 1st and 3rd persons singular we sometimes meet with a final a or a final u, and sometimes the vowel is elided. I propose accordingly, pending further research, to designate the latter form as apocopate.\n\nFor an explanation of yassabat, \"he seized,\" see line 17.\n\nThe paragraph accordingly reads as follows:\n\n\"Says Darius the king. When I had slain Gomates the Magian, then a man [named Atrines, the son of Opadarmes, he in Susiana] arose; he said thus: I am the king of Susiana; then the people of Susiana rebelled against me: [they went over to that Atrines: he became king of Susiana: afterwards a man of Babylon] namod Niditabelus, the son of Anires, he arose in Babylonia; he thus falsely declared to the people: \"I [am Nabochodrossor, the son of Nabonidus:\" then the whole state of Babylon to Niditabelus] went over; Babylon rebelled: he seized the kingdom of Babylon.\"\n\nOf the 17th paragraph the Babylonian has preserved nothing but the words answering to \"Darius the king says,\" and the final clause anaku adduku, \"I slew him.\" The last word, which is the apocopate form of the 1st person singular of the Kal future of , is of some interest from its affording a good example of the phonetic power of , which is otherwise of rare occurrence. The intermediate phrases, \"then I sent to Susiana,\" and \"Atrines was brought bound before me,\" are entirely lost.\nPar. 18. l. 33 * Da xi ya vag.\n\nmelek (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 ). ya gab bi. akhar. ana ku.\n\n* Babel * al lak u. a na. eli.\n\nl. 34 (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 ) hva ku. sa.\n\n* Ni di ta bil. a\u00e1. oli. di k ta(1).\n\nhva su z su. a ba. ku l lu .\n\n* Tig gar. ma li. akhar. ana ku.\n\nl. 35 (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 )\n\n* Hu ri mi \u0161 da. ya\u0161 \u016bi. da nu. a\u00e1.\n\nya\u0161 mi. sa. * Hu ri mi \u0161 da. * *\n\nDi k ta. ni ti bi r. ad du ku.\n\nl. 36 (\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 ) yom.

This verb is used very frequently in the Inscriptions, and seems to be conjugated more regularly than its Hebrew correspondent. In the future forms, at any rate, where the first radical as a weak letter falls away, its loss is compensated by the doubling of the second radical; (compare \\( \\text{allaku} \\) or \\( \\text{allaku} \\) for the 1st person, and \\( \\text{yallaku} \\) or \\( \\text{yalliku} \\) for the 3rd person;) whilst in the participial forms \\( \\text{halak} \\), \\( \\text{haliku} \\), &c., and in the imperative \\( \\text{alkau} \\), the initial stem letter, which in Babylonian must have been \\( \\text{N} \\), rather than \\( \\text{N} \\), is reproduced. The \\( \\text{EY} \\) can only be used, it would seem at the end of the word \\( \\text{to express the vowel termination in u}. \\) This verb is followed by the compound preposition \\( \\text{ana eli} \\), which merely signifies \"to.\"\n\nThe 3rd and 4th clauses are both important and difficult. The construction of the Persian seems to be, \"the forces of Naditabirus held the Tigris: there they were in position, supported by their boats.\" But the order of the phrases must be reversed in the Babylonian. The only explanation, indeed, that I can give of line 34 is as follows. \"The forces of Niditabel\" \\( \\text{as eli dikta hvasuzzu}, \\) \"to their ships having fled;\" \\( \\text{aba}, \\) \"there;\" \\( \\text{kullu} \u2014 Tiggar, \\) \"held [or guarded] the Tigris.\" \\( \\text{mali}, \\) \"completely.\" There are many doubtful points, however, in this rendering. \\( \\text{is orthographically identical with a word which is repeated over and over again in} \\)\nthe Inscriptions of Assyria, and which cannot possibly, I think, signify \"ships,\" though I am still doubtful as to its real signification.\\(^1\\) Of the many readings that have been suggested for this word, the most probable, I think, is \"walls of defence;\" and the question accordingly arises, whether the Persian naviy\u0101 can also have this meaning, or whether there can be such entirely different significations as \"ships\" and \"walls\" appertaining to the same noun \\( \\text{hvasuzzu} \\). Leaving this point to be decided by more competent inquirers, I go on to suggest that \\( \\text{hvasuzzu} \\), which governs dikta, may be the plural participle of a root answering to \\( \\text{to take refuge} \\), a sibilant, as is so often the case, being substituted for the Hebrew \\( \\text{n} \\). The next word, \\( \\text{awad\u0101} \\), however it be pronounced, undoubtedly stands for the Persian awad\u0101, \"there;\" for we have, in a subsequent passage \\( \\text{amuth\u0101} \\), answering to \\( \\text{from thence;} \\) and \\( \\text{with equal certainty may be identified as the 3rd person plural pr\u0113terite of a verb which corresponds with} \\) \\( \\text{in Hebrew, and} \\) \\( \\text{in Arabic, and which signifies \"to hold or} \\)\n\n\\(^1\\) The phrase to which I allude is \\( \\text{dikta or dikut, and thus admitting of explanation either as a correspondent for the Chaldee} \\) \\( \\text{\"a palm-tree,\" or as a kindred derivative with} \\) \\( \\text{\"a wall,\" or \"tower.\" The latter is, I think, however, the most probable explanation, for it is impossible to suppose that all the cities to which this phrase refers had either \"ships\" to be destroyed, or \"palm-trees\" to be cut down; whereas, there were undoubtedly \"walls and towers\" in every instance to be levelled by the Assyrian conqueror. I think, also, that} \\) \\( \\text{must be plural forms, the theme being dikta, which would nearly resemble} \\)\nguard.\" The term which follows may be taken for the determinative of water, as it not only precedes the names of rivers, but is also usually prefixed to the noun varrat, which signifies the sea. It was probably non-phonetic. After occurs one of the names of the Tigris. It is written , and was, I think, pronounced Tiggar, the 1st sign being perhaps a non-phonetic determinative, while the two others have the respective powers of tik and gar. This name, in the Inscriptions of Assyria, is written , and interchanges with a still more ancient designation of the river in question expressed by . In the succeeding line will be found a third name for the Tigris, which is the\n\n---\n\n1 This verb is constantly used in the Insc. of Assyria, with the sense of \"withholding;\" comp. mandattasum yaklu, \"they withheld their tribute.\" yaklu tamarku, \"they withheld allegiance,\" &c. &c.\n\n2 Possibly the initial sign of this name, , which is properly bar, may here have the secondary power of hi or hid, answering to the first syllable of the Hebrew title . In Assyrian, at any rate, it often interchanges phonetically with before i; compare Khursabad, 38, 65 and 16, 113, &c. The second sign has several values, but tik is that most usually employed, and that the last character or , of which paru seems to be the normal power, may also be pronounced gar, I infer from the forms aggur and attagar, which are the Kal and Nithpael (?) futures of the same root, answering to the Hebrew or .\n\n3 I should wish to read as khalkhal, or supposing the word to be a plural form, as khali; and would thus compare with the title, the name of the river Halys, together with the geographical appellations of Calah, Calachene, Calneh, &c.; but this is, after all, little more than a conjecture; for the evidence which would attach to the letter the power of khal, is exceedingly slight.\noriginal form, I think, of the modern Dijleh, and which, singularly enough, corresponds in sound with the noun dikta, \"ships\" or \"walls,\" that I have been just endeavouring to explain. The last word of this difficult clause, mali, I suppose to be a derivative from the root \"to fill,\" regarding it either as the plural form of the Kal active participle, or, which is more probable, identifying it with the adverb \"fully.\" Many kindred forms at any rate are met with of this term, and in all of them we may, I think, detect a collective sense: awashchiya, \"each of these,\" or \"all these,\" is thus rendered by gabbi mala; see Westergaard's E., l. 9: vihapatiga, \"such as were at home\" (Behistun, l. 43), is translated by mala ai bit, and on Michaux's stone, side 2, l. 21, we have which means perhaps \"the great gods,\" each (or all) of them, on this tablet \"their forms have been represented.\"\n\nIt may be convenient, also, to mention in this place, that I have at length decided in referring to the same root, the terms and which occur so often in the trilingual Inscriptions, and which have hitherto resisted all explanation. I am satisfied, indeed, from comparing Bel. Cyl., side 2, l. 6; with East India Insc., Col. 6, l. 26, that the letter , which is usually bai, has also the power of mal, and in the same way, therefore, that answers to vihapatiga, so will diyaku va mallyu, answer to usatayapatiga, the signification being \"alain one and all.\" The phrase, also, everywhere at Behistun, in the numerical notice of the slain and prisoners, must\nagain, which occurs so frequently in the Assyrian Inscriptions, seems to be merely a collective pronoun; and the participle hvamallu, which is also a well-known word, may be referred, I think, to the root \"to fill.\" At the same time, having thus rendered a plausible explanation of each word contained in line 34, I am bound to say that I place no great dependence on the translation of the whole phrase, and that I am not even quite satisfied that the Persian text has been correctly rendered. The remaining words of line 34 signify \"then I some troops,\" and refer, of course, to the manoeuvre executed by Darius in order to force the enemy's position, and obtain command of the passage of the river.\n\nIn the 9th clause, \"we crossed over the Tigris\" is rendered by Dikta nitibir. The employment of the name of Dikta to designate the Tigris in immediate contact with the more usual appellation of Tiggar is remarkable, for it proves that the titles were independent of each other, instead of Digla, as has been generally supposed, being a corrupted form of Tigra; while the use of the latter term, as early as the age of the North-West Palace at Nimrud (about 1000 B.C.), throws considerable doubt upon the etymology which the Greeks, in accordance with the tradition of the country, assigned to the name. It seems indeed impossible to believe that an Aryan dialect in which tigra, as a derivative from \"to be sharp,\" signified \"an arrow,\" and was thus applied to the river in question to indicate its velocity, could have prevailed in Mesopotamia at any period of the Assyrian monarchy.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 If we could suppose, however, that a root dik existed in Babylonian, of cognate origin with the Sanscrit \"to be sharp,\" and having the same meaning, we should\nI am not able, it is true, from Semitic sources, to explain the etymology either of Dikta or Tiggar, nor can I determinately trace the connection between Dikta and \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 (that is, I cannot say whether Diglet and Dikta are both feminine nouns, the one being an amplification of the other, or whether Dikta is not rather the same form as Dikla, the original dental having subsided into a liquid by a mere natural orthographical degradation): but I can at any rate sustain the reading of Dikta which I have adopted for \u05d3\u05b5\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0, and which, owing to the discrepant phonetic value of the sign \u05d0, might otherwise be doubted, by pointing to the variant orthography of \u05d3\u05b5\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0, which is applied to the same river in the British Museum series, pl. 65, l. 14.\n\n\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 nibibir, answering to \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 niyataray\u00e1ma, \"we crossed over,\" is the 1st person plural of the Iftal form of \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \"to cross over,\" a root which supplies us with a large number of derivatives in the Inscriptions of Assyria.

Dikta, as a feminine noun, would signify \"the sharp,\" or \"the rapid,\" and might thus be appropriately used as a name for the river Tigris; while dikat or dikat (plural forms) would also designate \"boats\" or \"canoes,\" from the rapidity of their movement, precisely as we have in Persian the cognate forms of \u0646\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646, \"sharp\" or \"rapid,\" and \u0646\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646, \"a boat\" or \"canoe,\" and in the same way as the skiffs used at the present day upon the Tigris and Euphrates, are named ter\u00e9d\u00e9h, to indicate their lightness and velocity.\naway, and it was thus evidently regarded as a very weak aspiration, assimilating, however, to the perhaps, rather than to the N, so that ai, as the preformative of the 1st person singular, could be appropriately rendered by \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9} \\).\n\nThe preformative \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9} \\) for the 1st person plural exactly answers to the Hebrew \u05d0, but with regard to the terminal vowel, there was apparently no fixed rule in Babylonian: for although in the term \\( \\text{niti\u0161ir} \\) and in \\( \\text{niti\u0161u} \\) (Westergaard's D., l. 16), the vowel is elided, as in Hebrew, it appears again in the orthography of \\( \\text{niti\u0161usu} \\), which we shall meet with in the next line as an Ifta'al form of ebas.\n\nThe last word of line 35, \\( \\text{adduku} \\), \"I smote,\" is already well known.\n\nThe date in line 36 is sufficiently legible, and supplies us with the form of \\( \\text{Ariyatiya} \\) for the Persian month Ariyatiya, the same form occurring repeatedly in other Assyrian and Babylonian documents, but no means existing, that I know, of ascertaining how the name was pronounced.\n\nThe paragraph ends with \\( \\text{silat niti\u0161usu} \\), \"we did battle,\" or \"fought.\" The word for \"battle,\" which is written indifferently \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9} \\), \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9} \\), and \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9} \\), and which must be a feminine noun, is derived probably from a root corresponding with the Hebrew \\( \\text{\u05d4\u05de\u05da} \\), the sense of \"moving to and fro,\" which appertains to the Hebrew verb, being somewhat analogous to the meaning which belongs etymologically to the Persian correspondent hamaranam.

In line 57 we shall find \"on arriving\" expressed by \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 ana kasadi; and \"they arrived,\" in line 66, is rendered by \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 yaksudu, so that there can be no doubt as to the signification of kasad in Babylonian, although no immediate correspondent is to be recognized in the Hebrew, and although in the Inscriptions of Assyria aksut and yaksut, or aksuda and yaksuda, are generally used to indicate \"taking\" or \"capturing.\"\n\nIn continuation of this clause we find anusa Ufratawa, \"upon the Euphrates, rendered by \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17, which I really cannot venture to read phonetically. The particle \u1d17 or \u1d17 is constantly used in Assyrian to denote vicinity to \"a river,\" or \"the sea,\" and in such positions it interchanges with \u1d17 \u1d17 or \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17, but I doubt if any of these forms are phonetic: at any rate the normal power of \u1d17, which attaches to the character \u1d17 \u1d17, is manifestly inapplicable, and I have not yet been able to assign to it any other determinate value. The name of the Euphrates also which follows the particle \u1d17 \u1d17, and is distinguished by the determinative \u1d17 \u1d17, is equally difficult of explanation. The title of this river in the Inscriptions of Assyria is commonly written \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 or \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 for Burat, but the other name, such as we have it in the text, and as it is found generally on all Babylonian monuments, was not unknown to the kings of Nineveh, for the very same orthography is employed in the British Museum series, pl. 18, l. 32. The term indeed of \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 may possibly have been read Burat, like \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17 \u1d17, for the initial and concluding signs were, it would seem, non-phonetic, and of the two essential characters \u1d17 \u1d17 or \u1d17 \u1d17 and \u1d17 \u1d17, the latter, a mere variant form of \u1d17 \u1d17, had\ncertainly the power of rati. As we find, however, that this term \nor , or is used everywhere in the Inscriptions of Assyria as a generic term, whilst \nthe orthography of or is applied exclusively to \nthe river, it is certainly safer to regard them as distinct titles, the \none being the original of the Hebrew , and the other a qualifi-\ncative epithet, referring to some particular property of the river.1\n\nIn line 37 the first letter that can be traced is , and we\n\n---\n\n1 It certainly appears to me as if the term without being a \ngeographical title, was still expressly employed to denote the valley of the \nEuphrates, or perhaps the Mesopotamian plains.

A term kuduru, written phonetically as (or with some equivalent orthography), or ideographically as and\u20143. The word sur, which is sometimes represented syllabically by (the monogram for \"a brother\"), or , and sometimes literally by . I am not prepared at present to explain the etymology of the title, although it may be presumed that kuduru is connected with \"power,\" and sur, with \"a refuge.\"\n\nThere are no other words in this paragraph requiring to be noticed, except the variant forms of salta, and salti, for the word \"battle.\"\n\nas if the sign had the phonetic value of kip, kipr\u0101t being the masc. plur. and kipret the fem. sing. of an adjective, signifying \"great,\" and allied to the root which is \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e8 in Hebrew, and \u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631 in Arabic.

A considerable difference will thus be found to exist between the Babylonian translation of the Behistun Inscription, as it is given in the sheets preceding the Memoir, which were printed on my first arrival in England, and that which is more recently repeated in the Analysis now going through the press. This difference applies not merely to the identification and rendering of the words in Roman characters, but even to the Cuneiform text, which, not unfrequently, was in the first instance erroneously printed. I wish it therefore to be understood, that in all cases of disagreement, a preference must be given to the text, rendering, and translation, as they appear in the Analysis; and I would further observe that, as in such a study knowledge must be necessarily progressive, I can only in reason be held responsible throughout my Memoir, for the explanations which, in point of time, have been the latest set forth by me. It is the more important, indeed, that I should thus assert my claim to consideration for amended readings, as a series of papers are being now published by Mons. Oppert, in the Journal Asiatique, on the Persian Behistun Inscriptions, which take cognizance alone of the original translation and meagre notes appended to my Analysis of the Persian text; and which systematically ignore the many corrections, and the diffuse etymological illustration contained in the Vocabulary subsequently published. This is, I think, to say the least of it, uncandid; and as I should be sorry to see the present Papers subjected to a similar scrutiny, I have thought it necessary formally, at the outset, to protest against such a system of criticism.\n[Note.\u2014The Analysis of the Behistun Babylonian Text which precedes the General Memoir, is paged with Roman numerals, to distinguish the introductory portion from the Memoir or body of the work; the continuation of the Analysis will be paged in the same way, so as to admit of binding up the whole in the proper order of succession.

I undertake this task, however, with the utmost diffidence, for the more that I have extended my investigations,\u2014the more that I have studied the Inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia, and sought to verify previous conclusions, by testing their general applicability\u2014the more reason have I found to mistrust that which before seemed plain; the more alive, indeed, have I become to the sad conviction that in the present stage of the inquiry, as regards materials, no amount of labour will suffice for the complete resolution of difficulties; no ingenuity, however boldly or happily exerted, can furnish readings of such exactitude as to lead at once to positive results.\n\nThere are certain inherent difficulties in the construction of the Assyrian alphabet, which meet us on the very threshold of the inquiry, and envelope all our subsequent labours in obscurity and doubt. The same classification may apply to the Cuneatic signs, which Bunsen has applied to the Hieroglyphic. They are divided into ideographs, determinatives, phonetics, and mixed signs; but there are two sources of confusion in the Assyrian alphabet, from which the Egyptian is altogether free. 1stly, There are no direct means of distinguishing between the various classes of Cuneiform signs; and 2dly, in the phonetic branch of the subject, which is of course the most extensive and important, there is no clue, so far as the alphabet is concerned, to the determination of one out of the many powers which may belong to a single character. The first impediment is not of a very formidable nature, familiarity with the current collocation of the signs enabling a student usually to detect their generic employment irrespectively of the sense, or even of the sound; but the other diffi-\nculty is so great that, after years of laborious research, I have overcome it but to a limited extent.\n\nIt can be shown beyond all possibility of dispute, that a very large proportion of the Assyrian signs are Polyphones\u2014that is, they represent more than one sound; and strange as this irregularity may at first sight appear, it does not, I think, altogether defy explanation. The analogy of Egyptian writing would lead us to suspect that the Cuneatic signs were originally mere pictures, rude representatives of natural objects, which expressed in the first instance the actual object that was figured, but which came in process of time, and by a gradual transition from the representative to the symbolical system, to express ideas. The formation of a phonetic alphabet, and the application of such an alphabet to the ordinary purposes of inscription, would then be a third step in advance, and might have taken place in the following manner:\u2014each sign may have been employed phonetically to express the name, or names, of the object to which it was previously appropriated as an ideograph, and without any reference whatever to the sense; and when such names were polysyllabic, by a last but most important refinement, the character may have been specially devoted to the initial sound. Now in this proposed transition from picture-writing to a phonetic system, there is nothing at variance with the recognized development of the Egyptian alphabet, but the retention of signs with Polyphone powers, corresponding to the original Polyonymous ideas. That such a peculiarity, at the same time, existed in the Assyrian alphabet, I shall have abundant means of proving in the course of the present Memoir, and I am fain, therefore, to regard it as a mere excrescence on the Egyptian system.\n\nBut although I can thus show the probable reason of the employment of Cuneatic Polyphones\u2014although I can explain the fact of the character \u1f08, the ideograph for a \"country,\" being invested with such discrepant phonetic values as mat and kur, by referring to the Semitic synonyms, \u1f08 in Chaldee, and \u1f08 in Arab., (cognate with \u1f08),\u2014the practical inconvenience of such a variableness of power is excessive. The meaning, for instance, of an Assyrian or Babylonian word may be ascertained determinately, either from the key of the trilingual Inscriptions, or from its occurring in a great variety of passages with only one signification that is generally applicable; but unless its correspondent can be recognized in some Semitic tongue, it is often impossible, owing to the employment in it of a Polyphone character, to fix its orthography. In the multitudinous inscriptions\nagain, of Nimroud, of Khursabad, of Koyunjik, and of Babylon, of which (although their general application can be detected without much difficulty) the details require for their elaboration a minute philological analysis, this orthographical uncertainty presses on the student with almost crushing severity. On the one side, in working out his readings, he can only employ philological aid,\u2014that is, he can only compare Hebrew or Chaldee correspondents, after being assured of the true sound of the Assyrian and Babylonian word; while, on the other, he must depend on his acquaintance with Semitic vocables to fix the fluctuating Cuneiform powers.\n\nI do not despair but that ultimately a severe and extensive comparison of all available materials, combined with the fertility of invention, which is an essential element in the art of the decipherer, will render the Assyrian legends at least as intelligible as the Egyptian; but at the present moment, I do not pretend to be able to do more than give a general outline of the subject, and thus pave the way to further discovery.\n\nDeferring then, for the present, any more detailed explanation of the nature or consequences of the employment of Polyphone characters, I now pass on to the consideration of certain other peculiarities that attach to the Assyrian alphabet. Much of the laxity which I at one time attributed to the Assyrian system of expression, has either disappeared under a more rigid examination, or has yielded to the solution of one character being qualified to represent several dissimilar sounds. I do not now find that there is in Assyrian more tendency to interchange among the letters which compose each class of the alphabet, than is to be traced in Hebrew, Chaldee, and other cognate dialects. In one remarkable particular, there is indeed, in the Inscriptions of Babylon and Assyria, a semblance of phonetic refinement, as connected with the graphic art, to which no parallel can be produced in any other system of Semitic writing. A series of characters can be put together, forming a sort of syllabarium, and arranged apparently on the most scientific principles of alphabetical expression. Taking the guttural class for an example, it will thus be found that there are six forms for the surd \\( k \\), three in which the vowels, \\( a \\), \\( i \\), and \\( u \\), precede the consonant, and three in which they follow it; for the aspirated \\( kh \\), four forms can be recognized; one, which may be used after any of the three vowels indifferently, and three appropriated each to its own vowel; while for the sonant \\( g \\) there are only three forms in all; the employment of a hard letter (\\( g \\), \\( d \\), or \\( b \\)) as a complemental sound being apparently adverse to the Assyrian organs of speech; and the characters of this grade being thus restricted to the\nexpression of the syllables ga, gi, and gu. It is not pretended that this arrangement of numbers will admit of rigid application to all the various classes of the alphabet, but a sanguine philologist might, nevertheless, feel disposed to adopt it as the normal type of Assyrian expression, and to regard all deviations from it as exceptional. In real fact, however, the existence of such a syllabarium depends, as it appears to me, on mere accident. The majority of the signs composing it are Polyphones, and could not possibly, therefore, have been invented to give utterance to a preconceived and exclusive phonetic system. They were rather, I should think, ideographs, representing objects of which the names, (or at any rate the initial sounds of the names,) were, ak, ik, uk, ka, ki, ku, &c. They may have been used phonetically merely to suit the necessities of the language; and the irregularity perceptible in the distribution might then be explained as arising from the accident of there being no objects, requiring ideographs to express them, of which the Assyrian names were identical, or commenced, with the wanting phonetic powers. There is at the same time an undeniable evidence of artificial structure in the degradation of these syllabic values to simple letters, such as to all intents and purposes they become when two of them of the same vocalic grade are combined in a single articulation, and when the inherent vowel of either one character or the other must thus necessarily lapse. In the articulation, kat, for example, which commences the name of Kaipatuka (for Cappadocia), and which is composed of the two characters ka, and at, either one or the other of these signs must represent a simple letter rather than a syllable; and as this peculiarity of expression pervades the whole Assyrian alphabet, I think I am justified in still adhering to the statement which I announced last year, that the Phonetic signs were in some cases syllabic, and in others literal.\n\nIt may be understood from what has been already said, that an attempt at present to classify the entire number of the Assyrian signs, or to reduce the system of writing to which they belong to certain definite and constant rules, would be almost hopeless. It would be trying to run before we are well able to walk, and would be opposed to all principles of sound criticism. Although, therefore, it may be disappointing to the curious, who care only for results, and tedious even to those pains-taking scholars, who know and appreciate the value in scientific inquiries of the \"pi\u00e8ces justificatives,\" I shall resist the temptation of heading the present Memoir with a tabulated Assyrian\nAlphabet, and in lieu thereof, proceed to examine the Cuneatic signs, \"literatim et seriatim,\" giving examples of the different modes in which each character is employed, and frankly stating the degree of confidence that may be attached to its phonetic, or ideographic, identification. Such inferences as may be legitimately drawn from the materials subjected to analysis, either in regard to general principles of language, or details of alphabetical expression, will then follow in due course, and a path will be gradually opened up to a more comprehensive, as well as critical, treatment of the question of Cuneiform decipherment. It is true, that in thus dealing with the Assyrian Alphabet, without previously laying down any fixed rule of classification, the order of arrangement in which the signs may present themselves for examination, must be to a certain extent arbitrary; but it is hoped that any inconvenience or difficulty of reference, arising from so motley an assortment, will be obviated by the discriminative lists of ideographs, determinatives, phonetics, and mixed signs, that will be given as soon as the preliminary branch of the inquiry may be fairly exhausted.\n\n1. \u1e24a or a. As a phonetic sign it answers to the Semitic Aleph, \u1e24, being a light aspiration, the \"spiritus lenis\" of the Greeks, and also serving in the interior of a word to represent the long a.\n\nIn the following names, which occur at Behistun, it corresponds as an initial, both with the Persian \u1e24\u0101 and \u1e24\u0101\u2014\n\n```\nA r a b i\n```\n\n= Persian Arab\u0101ya.

It is the special characteristic of the 1st person sing., denoting that person in verbs as a prefix, where it answers to the preformative of the Hebrew future; (compare the Achaemenian forms,\n\n\"I was or became;\" \"I smote;\" \"I said,\") and fulfilling the same function as a suffix after nouns and adjectives; (compare\n\nat Behistun, answering to the Persian mand badaka, \"bound to me,\" or \"my servant;\" and the numerous Assyrian\n\nrepresent the proper name of the country, however, rather than the ethnic title, the nouns being apparently in the oblique case. That these two forms, moreover, denote the same place, notwithstanding the discrepant orthography, is proved by the name of the king of Hamath,\n\nIt would be hazardous to give the pronunciation of this name, as the character represents two distinct powers, and there are no means of ascertaining which of the two sounds it may be here intended to convey. I should propose, however, to read the name Likuisha.\n\nIt would be more precise to say, that the Cuneiform answers to the Hebrew preformative of the 1st person singular, wherever the consonant which follows it opens on a vowel. In all conjugational forms where the 1st radical is formed, the personal characteristic is of course included in the sign which represents the initial syllable.\n\nIt is further to be observed, that although, in quoting verbal examples, I rarely make a distinction of tense, the forms employed do in reality belong to the Aorist of the Arabic and Hebrew. The Pr\u00e4terite tense was not, of course, altogether unknown to the Assyrian and Babylonian languages, but it was seldom used.\nforms, \"my kingdom;\" \"my empire,\" or \"rule;\" \"my country;\" \"my city,\" &c.). As the suffix of the 1st person, very commonly interchanges with i or ya. In some cases this is a mere alphabetical variety; tia, for example, being equally expressed by or ; but in other instances there must, I think, be a phonetic confusion between the a and i, the plural fem. of the demonstrative pronoun being thus indifferently written (N. R. line 8,) and (B. I., line 40); and the termination of the ethnic plural, which in such cases must apparently stand for the unusual Hebrew ending in ', being optionally expressed by and . Compare the famous notice of the Phoenician nations in one of the earliest Assyrian Inscriptions that we possess, where the orthography of the different copies is\u2014\n\n| 'Sur r \u00e1 ya | 'Sur ra ai |\n| --- | --- |\n| Si du n \u00e1 ya | Si du na ai |\n\n| A khar r \u00e1 ya | A khar ra ai |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gu bal \u00e1 ya | Gu bal ai |\n\n(See B. M., Plate 43, l. 10, with foot notes.)\n\nI must now consider the employment of as an ideograph, and make my first attack on the obscurities of Assyrian expression.\n\n---\n\n1 There may, perhaps, be a grammatical distinction between anni\u0161i and anni\u0161i, the former being the nominative and the latter the oblique case, and the vowel a being thus changed to i, in the form anni\u0161i, to harmonize with the inflexional ending.\n\n2 On further examination, I prefer considering the in these names to be everywhere a single letter with the power of ai, the effect of its junction with the preceding sign being to develop a long vowel sound; and I no longer therefore, insist on any phonetic confusion between the vowels i and a.\nsign in question is commonly used to express the idea of \"son,\" interchanging in such a position with other ideographs, or , which means simply, \"young, new, or small,\" and where the idea of \"young\" is qualified by the sign of the masculine gender. Sometimes, however, the ideograph is replaced by the simple relative or sa, which here denotes the genitive case, and thus exactly accords with the Greek idiom for expressing filiation; in other cases, we have both the ideograph and relative ; and at Behistun the construction even occurs of as in the phrase\u2014\n\nwhich must read, \"Nabu-kudur-ussur, his son, Nabu-nit's,\" for \"Nabochodrossor the son of Nabonidus.\" These comparisons, at the same time, furnish us with no clue to the phonetic value of when\n\n1 This is the ordinary method of expressing filiation in the cursive Babylonian documents. There are, indeed, many hundred examples of the group on the clay cakes in the British Museum.\n\n2 The alphabetical machinery which is used to express these names, will be given in detail hereafter. For the title of Nabochodrossor three ideographic elements will be found to be employed. 1. The god Nabo, denoted by the letters or preceded by the determinative : 2. a compound ideograph sometimes phonetically rendered by kuduri, but of which I know not the meaning: and 3, a sign which is also used as an ideograph for \"brother,\" and which, being sometimes replaced by must be pronounced . The name of Nabunit in the same manner is expressed by two ideographs; firstly, or with the determin. for Nabu, and secondly, the letter , of which I know not the meaning, but which must apply to some object named in Babylonian nit. It further appears probable that the group , which occurs on so many of the clay cakes in the British Museum, is merely another way of expressing the name of Nabunit, the character in the second element being used as a determinative, and the letter ni standing as an abbreviation for nit. I have also found ni in this name expressed phonetically by .\nused to express the sound which in Assyrian means \"a son.\" We can only hope to arrive at the determination of that value by applying to the proper names where the sign occurs, the term denoting a son in other Semitic dialects; but any doubt, of course, which may attach to the identification of the names, will here again impede our progress. There are thus several royal names in Assyrian and Babylonian, which offer themselves for examination; the builder, for instance, of the N.W. Palace at Nimrud, \\( \\text{N} \\rightarrow \\text{W} \\rightarrow \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{W} \\), the final character of whose name is frequently given as \\( \\text{E} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{H} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\). (see B. M. Ser., Pl. 2, l. 1; Pl. 33, l. 13, and Pl. 76, l. 7,) and the father of the Babylonian king, Nabochodrossor,\n\n\\( \\text{N} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) or \\( \\text{N} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\)\n\nin whose name the \\( \\text{Y} \\) and \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) are seen to interchange.\\(^1\\)\n\nNow to obtain for these two names the reading of Asser-adon-pal or Sardanapalus, and Na\u03b2\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, according to the orthography of Polyhistor, I have hitherto proposed to read \\( \\text{Y} \\) or \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) as pal or pol, and have even sought to compare this term with the Syriac and Chaldee \\( \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\) bar, and Arabic \\( \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\), bin; but the identification was never anything more than a conjecture, and must, I fear, on further consideration, be pronounced inadmissible. From the orthography, indeed, of one of the names of the Euphrates, which is written indifferently \\( \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) and \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) (and with inflexional endings\u2014\n\nPur rat Bu rat\n\n\\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\); and \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\); or \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\);\n\nBu rat tu; Bu rat ti; Bu rat ti;\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This name is found on all the documents, both cursive and hieratic, of the time of Nabochodrossor, and is also usually expressed by ideographs. The elements are; 1, the god \\( \\text{N} \\rightarrow \\text{A} \\rightarrow \\text{B} \\), represented by the letters \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) or \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\) preceded by the determinative for \"god\" \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\); 2, the word for \"son,\" denoted by the letter \\( \\text{Y} \\), or the mixed sign \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\); and 3, the term \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\), which is either ideographically expressed by \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\), the sign for \"a brother,\" or is phonetically written \\( \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\rightarrow \\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{Y} \\).\nsee B. M. Ser., Pl. 8, l. 43; Pl. 45, l. 36; Kh. Pl. 66, No. 2, l. 7; and Ob. Ins. passim,) pur would seem a preferable value to pol or pal, and there is an old Persian word, \u1e63ur, signifying \"a son,\" of this exact orthography. Pur, also, might be altered into pol, and even pal, by the Greeks, without any great violence, and the explanation now proposed would thus still lead to the identification of \u1e62ur and \u1e62ur as Sardanapalus and Nabopolassar.\n\nAt the same time, it seems hardly probable that a term like pur, abbreviated from the Sans. \u1e63ur, and preserved under the same form of putra (\u092a\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930), in the Persian Inscriptions of Darius, could have been known in the Assyrian language, as early as the time of the Nimrud Palace; and I still, therefore, consider the phonetic value of the monogram for \"son\" to be involved in much uncertainty.\n\nThere are probably, too, other meanings and powers attaching to the sign \u1e62ur. In one instance, certainly, and perhaps in others, \u1e62ur is used for \"mankind,\" and the \u1e62ur may be conjectured, therefore, to have the variant value of the Babylonian word which signifies \"a man.\" In several mixed signs, also, and in the names of the gods, which appear to be rarely or ever expressed phonetically, the power of the \u1e62ur has yet to be discovered. I may thus cite \u1e62ur, \"a river,\" \u1e62ur \"warriors,\" or \"an army;\" and the names of the Assyrian gods \u1e62ur or \u1e62ur, (Babylonian \u1e62ur) and \u1e62ur or \u1e62ur. In the name of Nineveh, of which the normal form is \u1e62ur, the \u1e62ur probably retains its primitive power of a, the true pronunciation of the title being Ninua; but it would be very hazardous to attempt to fix the reading of such names as the following: \u1e62ur \u1e62ur \u1e62ur \u1e62ur \u1e62ur; \u1e62ur \u1e62ur \u1e62ur \u1e62ur; or \u1e62ur \u1e62ur \u1e62ur; of which the former belongs to a Chaldean king contemporary with the builders of Khursabad and Koyunjik, and the two latter to the royal family of Assyria.\n\n1 See Westergaard's H., line 2, and Niebuhr's copy of the same Inscription.\n2 In the first of these names the middle element \u1e62ur is often replaced by\n2. I propose to represent this character by e, not as in any way indicating its connexion with the Hebrew Tserei or Seghol, but for mere convenience of distinction from the a and i. There can be no doubt but that the Assyrian form of the sign in question corresponded in that language with the Hebrew y. The following examples are conclusive on this point:\n\n\\[ \\text{or} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{or} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{from the root ebar, \"to cross over.\"} \\]\n\\[ \\text{from erab, \"to set (as the sun).\"} \\]\n\\[ \\text{from ebad, \"to serve, or \"make serve.\"} \\]\n\nthus showing that the phonetic power is the word signifying \"a son.\" The same interchange takes place in the orthography of the third name; (comp. B. M. 86, Is. 2 and 16); and it may be inferred even that in the second name (B. M., 17. 1), the represents the sound for \"son,\" from comparing the nearly similar title of upon Michaux's stone, where is substituted for . [Since the above was written, I have ascertained that the king whose name is written is the Merodach Baladan of Scripture; the name of the god Merodach (Mars) being represented by the monogram preceded by , the det. of \"a god;\" or having the power of pal or pala, and the last element being sounded dana or adana. I am still in doubt, however, as to the reading of the other two names: the former belongs to an ancestor of Sardanapalus, and the latter to the grandson of Sennacherib. I now suppose the sign independently of its normal value of a or ha, to represent the distinct sounds ba and pal, or pala; and this latter term may, perhaps, have signified \"a son,\" though there is no evidence, at present, to establish such an identification; and I have accordingly preferred to render the word \"son\" by \u0161ar, after the analogy of the Chaldee.\n\nFor the true Cuneiform orthography of the name altered by the Hebrews and Greeks to Elam and Elymais, see B. I., l. 41; B. M., 22. Is. 31 and 35; Khura. 66. 2. 4. &c., &c.\n2. \\begin{aligned} \\text{from \\(\\epsilon\\)bas, perhaps answering to the Chaldee} \\\\ \\beta \\gamma \\alpha \\prod \\sigma \\varepsilon \\tau \\iota, \"to make,\" or \"do.\" \\end{aligned}\n\n\\begin{aligned} \\text{el-, \"upon,\" \"over;\" and the same,} \\\\ \\text{answering to the root \\(\\alpha \\tau \\eta \\nu\\delta \\varsigma \\tau \\varepsilon\\),} \\\\ \"to go up,\" or \"ascend.\" \\end{aligned}\n\nAt the same time, it is evident that the Assyrians and Babylonians did not regard the \\(x\\) as a strong guttural, resembling the Arabic \\(x\\) or \\(i\\). It was rather, perhaps, a breathing appropriated to the \\(i\\), as the \\(i\\) was to the \\(\\alpha\\), and may thus be compared with the Hebrew \\(y\\), in such names as \\(y^d y^d, \\theta y^d y^d; \\theta y^d \\theta y^d, \\theta \\theta \\sigma \\eta y\\), &c. At Behistun, indeed, we find the \\(x\\) often answering to the simple vowel \\(i\\), in the orthography of proper names.

In the great Insct., the name is written \\(y. y x y x y x y x x x x x x x x x x x \\).\n\n2 In the same way the \\(x\\) is often used for the oblique case of nouns, answering to the \\(i\\) in Arabic; comp. the royal titles in the Standard Inscription at Nimrud, which are either written in the nom. \\(x x e\\) \\(y x x x \\), \\(x x e x x x \\), or in the oblique \\(x x y x x x\\) \\(x x x\\).

I., la. 8 and 9.)\nin the category of the Hebrew feeble letters \u05e0\u05e0, and the roots containing it might be classed with the \"verba quiescentia\" of the grammarians. Compare the following forms from the root \u05d0\u05d1\u05e9, which in the Hebrew would be of the \"Pe guttural\" class, and would preserve the y intact.\n\nYa bu s 3d pers. sing.

Al ta bu su 1st per. sing. of Itaphal.\n\nFrom \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8, in the same way, we have 1st pers. plur. of Ifta'al conj. \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 nitibir.\n\nThe forms \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 and \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 again show that the \u05d9 will interchange with the \u05d9 as the second radical; and there are also instances where the sign in question is elided as the third radical, as sometimes happens with the Hebrew verbs \u05e0\u05e0 and \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8.\n\nThe sign \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 is further used, especially to denote the dual number.\n\n---\n\n1 I am not quite satisfied, however, that these two forms come from the same root.\n\n2 As for instance in the orthography of \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8 or \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8, \"I worshipped,\" or \"made adoration,\" from \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8, in the phrase\u2014\n\n\"The god Asar, the great lord, and the gods inhabiting Assyria, to them I made adoration,\" the last word being very often written \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 with the \u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 suppressed. Compare Khur. 8. 2. 20, and corresponding phrases in the Standard Inscription, with B. M., 28. 27; 34. 9, and many other passages, where although different gods may be named, the construction is precisely similar.\nWe have thus upon the Nimrud Obelisk \"in my second year,\" where the expression is merely introduced to qualify the numeral II; again, on the Koyunjik Cylinder there is the same expression for \"in my second year\"; and on the Nebuchadnezzar Cylinder, wherever the gods are paired, they are followed by the epithet Baal, in the dual number, which is expressed in the same manner. See\n\nSide 1, l. 27.\n\nSide 2, l. 34.\n\nSide 2, l. 40.\n\n1 See B. M., 88. 32 and 63. 21. There are many difficulties, however, connected with the Assyrian system of yearly notation which I am not yet able to explain. \"Year\" is expressed by or or , and the number is sometimes indicated by figures, and sometimes by words or signs. Thus, for \"in my first year,\" we have in the Obelisk (B.M., 88. 26); but on Col. Taylor's Cyl. and on the B. M., Cylinder, 63. l. 18. \"Second,\" is always expressed by ; but for \"third,\" Colonel Taylor's Cylinder gives instead of , which is found on all the other documents; while for \"fourth,\" we have not only the regular , but, on Colonel Taylor's Cylinder, the same sign with the addition of ; and upon the Obelisk, \"in the fourth year\" is rendered by . (B. M., 89. 45.)\n\n2 As the god was the chief divinity of the Babylonians, and was in particular the special object of the worship of the great Nebuchadnezzar, the name, I think, must needs indicate the same deity, who was called\nIf we trusted to Hebrew analogy, we should of course assign the phonetic power of \\( \\text{im} \\) to the \\( \\text{m} \\), when used for the characteristic of the dual number, and there are also other indications, which in certain positions seem to connect the sign in question with the letter \\( \\text{m} \\);\n\nJupiter Belus by the Greeks. \\( \\text{I suspect, also, to be the Successor Beneath of Scripture.

For all details regarding the alphabet I must refer to the Memoir now in the course of publication.\n\n| Num. | Forms | Phonetic Power | Ideographic value | Phonetic powers arising from Ideographic values.
