KNIGHT,\nHonorary Treasurer, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nR. HANITSCHEH,\nNotes on a trip to Gunong Benom in Pahang.\n\nBy W. D. Barnes.\n\nGunong Benom is the name usually given to the \"massif\" which lies in Ulu Pahang in the centre of the triangle the western side of which is formed by the Pahang Trunk Road running from Tranum through Tras and Raub to Kuala Lipis, the Eastern by the Jelai and Pahang rivers running from Kwala Lipis to Kwala Semantan, and the southern by the Tranum-Bentong road and the Bentong and Semantan rivers which latter river joins the Pahang at Kwala Semantan. The name Benom is used by the Malays on the Pahang river but seems unknown at Raub. The mountain is a very conspicuous object from the Raub Rest House. Its height has been fixed trigonometrically by observations from the Perak and Selangor borders at about 6800 feet.\n\nIn July 1900 an experienced mandore Che Musa was sent from Perak by Mr. Young, the present head of the F. M. S. Trigonometrical Survey to erect trigonometrical beacons at this and other points in Pahang. Difficulties having arisen I, in the middle of August undertook the work on Benom. Che Musa was then in Raub having reached what he took to be the top of the mountain and done some clearing there. He had returned for supplies but was unable to get any men to go back with him. With the assistance of Mr. Mason the Asst. District Officer at Raub I managed to collect 17 men on a promise of wages at 70 cents a day and food. The food I had the least hesitation in promising as I knew by experience that a Malay who goes into the jungle on board-wages invariably runs out of stores and has to return for more at the precise moment when work is most pressing and disagreeable. With these men Che Musa went back. On the 29th of August he met me again at Raub and reported that he had built a camp two days\nmarch towards the Mountain and had carried to it half of the trigonometrical beacon and eight tins of rice. I had had all the rice soldered down in clean kerosine tins. The plan answered admirably. Each rice-coolie made a frame work like that of a knapsack on which to lash the tins and fitted it with straps of bark through which to pass his arms and carried in this way five and a half gantangs of rice (roughly the contents of a tin) rode comfortably, no time was wasted in packing and opening bundles, and most important of all\u2014the rice kept perfectly without any of the usual trouble in preserving it from wet.\n\nI was now ready to start and on arranging for my party found that the beacon (it was made of iron) needed a total of 22 men to carry it; more men were of course needed to carry rice for the beacon-carriers; I was very anxious to take sufficient food to last the whole party until the station had been cleared and the beacon fixed. I engaged therefore 32 coolies, all were Malays and but one or two were foreign Malays\u2014Kelantan and Tringganu men. As they assured me that the mountain was infested with peculiarly vicious 'hantu' I engaged a 'pawang' one Wan Putih. He was recommended to me as a powerful exorcist who feared no 'hantu' whatever. In fact he was I was told perhaps a little too rough in the way he dealt with them. The 'pawang' whom Che Musa had taken with him had proved a hopeless failure. My five boatmen also went with me as well as a Malay boy and a Chinese cook. Che Musa completed a party of 42.\n\nWe left Raub on the 31st and stopped the night at Wan Puthi's house in Ulu Gali. This though only two or three hours' walk from Raub was the last kampong on the way to the Gunong and to it the other half of the beacon had previously been brought. The afternoon was spent in getting packs, etc., all ready for an early start the next morning. I passed the night under a waterproof sheet; most of the men were accommodated by Wan Putih whose house was, if anything, even filthier than the usual Malay house.\n\nNext morning one man was sick with fever and had to be left behind. Two others were engaged in his place and the whole party with half a trigonometrical beacon, a theodolite,\nA TRIP TO GUNONG BENOM.\n\na load of botanical drying paper, my kit and bedding, rice and salt fish for the men and flour and fowls for me started off in good time. The first half of the day's march was easy, the rest up Bukit Numbih and down the other side was hard work for men carrying very inconveniently shaped pieces of angle iron. We camped on a tributary of the Klui which is a tributary of the Dong. The camp was at an elevation of about 1800 feet. Next day Che Musa with one man went back to Raub for more rice and food stores with instructions to hire men to bring them to Wan Putih's. The rest of us went on to the camp which Che Musa had previously made. Here we found a good 'pondok' and the 8 tins of rice and half the beacon. This camp was on another tributary of the Klui and also about 1800 feet high. The march was a short one. The day after I sent back 19 men to Wan Putih's to bring on the additional stores for which Che Musa had gone together with the balance of the beacon tools and with the rest of the men I went on to the foot of the Gunong, crossing Bukit Palas on the way. We stopped for the night at a point a little over 3100 feet high and as this was (so Che Musa had told me) the last place on the way up where water could be got and as the weather was distinctly unsettled (it had rained every day since we started) I set the men to work to build a good shelter.\n\nOn the third day ten men went back to the previous camp to bring on rice, whilst I went to Che Musa's clearing at the presumed top of the Gunong. To my surprise I found it to be only about 5000 feet high instead of 6800 as it should have been. As however the clearing was small and faced Raub it was impossible to make out the exact position. Next day I went up again with all the coolies left and started clearing and building a camp, and on the 7th it became obvious that the hill which Che Musa had thought to be the Gunong itself was really a subordinate one three miles away and separated from it by at least five deep valleys. After some consideration I decided to fix the beacon where I was. Looking for the true Gunong with a party of 40 men to feed was obviously out of the question and as the hill on which I was commanded a view of a large number of the main range trigonometrical stations and also much of the Gali and Dong Valleys invisible from the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nhighest point I decided that a beacon on it would at all events give some return for the expense incurred.\n\nOn the 8th Che Musa reached the top and by the 11th nearly all the beacon had arrived enabling me to send ten of my party back to Raub there to be paid off. Nearly all of them were sick with fever or otherwise useless for clearing and filling and I was very glad to have fewer men to feed. On the 14th the beacon was erected and on the 15th finally placed in position. By this time food was running short for all hands, and the coolies had got very tired of their job. Three had left without permission thereby forfeiting the greater part of their pay and on the afternoon of the 16th all the rest struck works. The average foreign Malay who comes to Raub to look for work is not a pleasant person with whom to deal, and if he hail from Tringganu as did most of my men did, his respect for a contract is very precisely measured by the ability of the other party to improve it. Luckily I was a Government officer and although my powers were not perhaps quite so extensive as I represented them to be, I succeeded in sufficiently impressing the men to induce them to go to work again late the next morning. I must own that I to some extent sympathised with them. Their work was pretty hard and their food had come down to rice and salt only. Fish sufficient for twice their number they had finished entirely. (My sympathies were sharpened by the fact that my own diet had fallen to bread and condensed milk.) When on the 18th the salt also gave out I found that I ran a risk of being left alone with my boatmen and a good deal more kit than they could carry. On the 20th therefore I started down although two very large trees up which a ladder had been contrived still stood on the side towards the Gunong. These are only noticeable from the Raub Rest House, whither late on the afternoon of the 21st I arrived, the return journey being done in two days.\n\nDuring the whole time between the 7th and the 20th the coolies were felling I was taking a round of theodolite angles and sketching the outlines of the hills in sight. The seeing was rarely good especially towards the north-west and south and trigonometrical stations more than 25 miles away could not have been pitched up without the aid of the powerful telescope which\nI had fortunately borrowed from the Selangor Survey Office. In clear weather the view was very fine. The hill sloped steeply on all sides except towards the Gunong and seemed to rise out of a level plain. On the north in the dim distance above the spurs of the 'massif' were Gunong Tahan and another noticeable peak since identified at Sinting. On the west the main range ran from Perak down to Jelebu with foot hills below it, and a narrow plain leading from Raub southward to the Bentong and Semantan cut up with long ridges of hills separating the various streams. At the foot of the Gunong were the white limestone cliffs of Gunong Serdam with the Gali plain beyond and Raub with the iron-roofed mine buildings sharply picked out and the cable-track showing like a long angled trench. I managed twice to get bearings of Tahan and to sketch the range of which it forms part. The beacon which I erected stands on the highest of these small peaks of about equal height and the clearing round it measures quite five acres.\n\nThe weather was fair only. There was a good deal of rain and on more than one day I never got a single sight. The sun when it shone was very hot and I found that working the theodolite under it meant considerable loss of cuticle from the nose and face. At 8 p.m. the temperature was about 69\u00b0 and at 6 a.m. 62\u00b0. The Malays complained a good deal of the cold although I had provided every man with a blanket. Many of them suffered from chapped lips. My Chinese cook in a blue serge Norfolk suit worn over all his other clothes looked a quaint sight. He never complained however and baked most excellent bread in an empty kerosine tin. A great difficulty was water supply. Every day a water party of five men had to be sent to the last camp nearly 2000 feet down and as the climb was steep and the men out of sight that water party did very little or no other work. Bathing was of course out of the question and washing had frequently to be foregone.\n\nThe 'pawang' was a great nuisance. Naturally he did no work himself and I suppose equally naturally he was of no use at all when the men went on strike. He was one of the most self-righteous natives whom I ever met and though quite illiterate fully equalled many a Koran-quoting haji in conceit. As a 'pawang' he did little except to 'Jampi', a man who was bitten\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\non the foot by a snake on the hill-top. This poor fellow's leg swelled up badly and as he was an oldish man and got high fever I began to be nervous about him. However either the charms or my remedies brought him round and in a few days he could walk again. Occasionally the 'pawang' thought fit to give us a taste of his quality and usually at inconvenient times. At the camp at the foot of the Gunong we heard every night a continuous shrill yelping as of baskets of puppies deserted by their mothers. It was, I think, made by birds though the Malays could give me no name for them. When I asked the 'pawang' he looked mysterious and suggested that the subject should be changed. One night this yelping was very persistent several 'riang-riang' were screeching in the trees, a wind having sprung up the jungle seemed full of noises. I fell asleep but was awakened near midnight by a loud harangue from the 'pawang' to the \"hantu\" of the Gunong. He began mildly by asking why they made such a disturbance; had they forgotten the propitiatory service he had paid before the first tree was felled? Was it fair to go back on him like this? For a while the noise died down and I heard the men expressing their sense of the 'pawang's' power over the spirits. Soon after however it began again and the pawang after more unavailing discourse lost his temper and scolded the hantu in very unmeasured language indeed. This frightened the men and they kept up a chorus of \"Biar-lah,\" \"Jangan-lah,\" \"Nanti dia marah\" until finally the pawang was reluctantly pacified and left the hantu alone.\n\nThen they all began to tell ghost stories. One I remember about Bukit Hitam which is full of getah-taban but on which no getah hantu dare collect owing to the tigers which guard the mountain. One man said that his uncle (a particularly brave man) started once with a large party and as a protection kept a ring of fire round the camp at night. Before morning however a tiger sprang through the flames and carried off the leader. This superstition about Bukit Hitam seems only general. I have heard it both sides of the main ridge. The commonest story about high mountains seems to be that they are inhabited by 'beroh' (macacus nemestrinus) who increase in size and ferocity the higher the adventurous traveller mounts until at last\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthey become as lazy as buffaloes. At this point the traveller always returns believing that they would be as large as elephants further on. On Gunong Raja by-the-by there are chili plants sufficiently gigantic to allow these big 'brok' to perch on their branches.\n\nThe Malay belief in 'hantu' is of course universal but is noticeable that it is always possible to find some one whether a pawang or otherwise who will have them for a consideration. A charming old Chinese thauke at Belat in Kuantan tells a story of how he offered $5 to some Malays to fell a large chingah tree which overhung his kongsi. They refused and said that it was a \"datoh.\" Subsequently they offered to fell it for $10. The thauke's indignant reply was that he would have nothing to do with men who would cut down their grandfather for ten dollars. Why for fifteen you would cut down your father and mother as well! He got over the difficulty by the aid of a large auger half a tin of kerosine and a lighted match. After describing how in a day or two the tree fell its heart completely burnt out, he always ends by saying very scornfully \"Mana hantu?\" As a rule however a Chinaman believes in propitiating the local unseen powers and even this sceptical thauke was seriously considering whether he could not change his luck by engaging a pawang to pay the belated sacrifice of a buffalo to the genius loci of his mine. A Chinaman is perhaps somewhat of a fatalist but he believes in insurance all the same.\n\nAnother superstition which I overheard concerned a cure for skin disease. The pawang was complaining that it was difficult to arrange the marriage of a girl who lived near his house as the poor thing was covered with \"kurap.\" My head-boatman who had noticed the girl, displayed great interest (he was I think contemplating matrimony \u00e0 bonne march\u00e9) and stated that he knew an infallible cure for \"kurap.\" It consisted in an ointment of sulphur and kerosine oil applied in some mysterious manner and it was an essential part of the cure that no living soul should see the patient for seven days after the unction.\n\nAs regards the fauna of the hill, over the very top of the ridge, i.e., 5000 feet high ran a beast-track and on almost the highest point was a quantity of rhinoceros' dung. One night whilst\nwe were on the top an elephant came along this track but was turned back by the fallen trees. It is easy to understand that aborigines walk for choice along the ridges and hills in order to avoid the dense undergrowth in the valleys but why beasts whose weight is calculated in tons should voluntarily carry that weight up hills of really considerable steepness in not so obvious. Do they go along the ridge in order to avoid the sidelong ground of the slopes much of which would give an insecure foot hold? In the present case the track seemed to run towards the Gunong itself nearly 2000 feet higher. On the lower ground we saw many tracks of sladang and elephant and heard elephants more than once. Animal life seemed scarce on the hill top. A snake\u2014mutilated beyond recognition before I saw it\u2014was found, also a wood louse and a scorpion. Small bees (lebah) however abounded as on all hill-clearings and crawled persistently over one's face and hands. Flies too appeared very quickly and in large numbers. They were in colour a dark metallic blue and in size between a housefly and a blue-bottle. They laid masses of longish white eggs on blankets not actually exposed to bright sunlight. There were also a few white woolly-looking flies of about the same size. None of these insects lived apparently on the spot. They all seemed to appear after the clearing was begun. Whence they came I cannot say. I also saw a few butterflies.\n\nWith the aid of a supply of botanical drying paper lent by Mr. Ridley, the Director of the Botanical Gardens, Singapore, I made a large and, I think, fairly complete collection of all trees, shrubs and plants which were at the time in fruit or flower. Mr. Ridley informs me that the collection reached him in good order and he has made out the appended catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of it. It is in fact as an introduction to this catalogue that these notes have been written. From the nature of the moss upon the hill I should imagine that Benom is much drier than the hill tops on the main range. The commonest trees were \"pagar anak\" bintangor, kelat, rengas manak, mempassi, membungit and palawan, at least those were the names of them given to me by the coolies. The \"rengas manak\" was not I was told poisonous. My Chinese cook however broke out with a bad eruption on his nose and face probably caused by \"rengas\" sap and on the night\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nbefore we started down one of the coolies was very badly stung on the body\u2014so badly indeed that he got high fever and could carry nothing and almost had to be carried himself. I saw him about a week later and the eruption was still visible on his chest. Either therefore rengas proper existed on the hill or else \"rengas manak\" is not harmless.\n\nThe palawan trees were a great nuisance. The wood was so hard that the bliong's in the hands of the less expert coolies were badly gapped and I was obliged to order that one exceptionally good man should tackle them all. The tree seemed to me exactly like the palawan so common on river banks.\n\nOn the very top of the hill there was a good deal of \"chandan\" which Mr. Ridley has identified in a paper recently published in the Journal.\n\nThroughout the whole trip I saw no getah, taban, chinga, merbau, petaling, or other valuable timber. On the lowest slopes of the hill there were however many fine \"seraia\" trees. The whole of the specimens identified by Mr. Ridley were collected on the top of the hill at a height of almost exactly 5000 feet.\n\nThe Benom \"massif\" consists of granite and I noticed that the sedimentary rocks were left behind very soon after leaving the low ground along the foot of the main range; they are found much higher up and in some places places higher than 1000 feet above sea level. Benom is an isolated granite intrusion without visible igneous connection with the main-range. In the long plain running southward from Raub the ridges which divide the Klan Bilut and Bentong are from their appearance of sedimentary rock. One of them Gunong Raca which overlooks Bentong township is of course conglomerate. This conglomerate is seen also at Jeram Kapur below Bentong. The pebbles in it are as far as I could see, not of igneous rocks but of quartzite and silicified slate. Its strike is a few points West of North and East of South and its dip (apparently) very steep. Similar conglomerates occur in the Ulu Jelai. The metamorphic limestone cliffs off Serdam at the foot of Benom seem identical in composition with those at Bukit Chintamani on the Bentong river and indeed with all the other limestones scattered, mostly in isolated cliffs throughout the Peninsula. In the Jelai river\nthis limestone has recently been shown to reach to a depth of over 900 feet below the present surface. The height at which the old sedimentary rocks remain on the east side of the main range as compared with the west is very noticeable when crossing the range by the Pahang Trunk Road. Further I have walked along the foot of the range the whole way from Tramun southward to the Triang (a tributary of the Pahang which rises in Jelebu) and have not only seen no granite but have found the pebbles in the streams to be mostly of sedimentary rarely of igneous rocks. The rocks over which I passed were all sediments. The bed rock of the Bentong alluvial flat where the mines are worked is uniformly not a bed of china clay as is usual on the western side of the Peninsula but a denuded surface of slates on edge.\n\nI was unable to ascertain the name of the hill on which the beacon is placed. It is certainly not Bukit Palas as I passed over Bukit Palas on my way to it. It may possibly be Kluang Terbang. At places however like Raub where no native seems to go into the more inaccessible jungle, local names are very uncertain.\n\nIf another attempt is made to fix a station on Benom I would strongly advise that another route be chosen. At Raub labour is very expensive and natives with any idea of local topography are nonexistent. Sakais there are none. Personally if I were to try again I should begin by making enquiries as to routes up the Dong or by the Krau, a tributary of the Jelai on the other side of the 'massif.'\n\nList of Plants Collected.\n\n*Illicium evenium*, King. Also occurs in Malacca, Selangor and Perak.\n\n*Polygala venenosa*, Juss. var. This is the same plant as that collected by Wray on Gunong Bubu (No.3813) and distributed under this name by King and is probably the var *gracilis* of Miquel. It is very unlike the ordinary form of the Penang and Perak hills, having a long terminal spike of flowers and not short axillary ones.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nGarcinia, sp.

A rare plant once collected by Scortechini, in Perak.\n\nTernstr\u00e6miacea, a very striking plant apparently belonging to the same order but in fruit only was obtained by Mr. Barnes. It is a tree or shrub with dark colored branches, and coriaceous ovate lanceolate leaves with blunt points 1 inch to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ long $2\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch wide with numerous close nerves and reticulations on the under surface. The upper surface is smooth dark green the under surface yellow when dry and the young leaves are red. The racemes are axillary about one inch long with about ten flowers. The fruit is a capsule on a very short pedicel. With a small rounded bract. The sepals are orbicular imbricate 4 in number, coriaceous with a scarious margin fringed with white hairs, and with three elevated ribs in the centre about $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long. The capule $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long splitting into 4 acute lobes on one of which persists the fairly stout style with an obscurely lobed stigma. There is a persistent column in the centre. The seeds are linear curved not winged two in each cell.\n\nThe flowers have not been obtained, and consequently it is difficult to refer this with any certainty to\nany genus. If as it appears it belongs to the order Ternstroemiaceae, it seems most nearly allied to *Pentaphylax* of China.\n\n**Pachynocarpus Stapfianus**, King.

N. Ridley.\nNotes on the Formation of Words in Malay and Cognate Languages.\n\nH. L. E. LUERING, PH. D. (Strassburg).\n\nUnlike the great majority of the better known Oriental languages the vernaculars of the Malayan family have not yet revealed the history of their growth and development. The Semitic, Persian, Indian and Chinese languages have not only preserved very early monuments of literature, which serve as infallible guides to the student, but we can follow their growth from step to step, from antiquity to the present day, without missing, as it were, a single foot-print in all the long journey. In this search for light on the origin and the roots of the language numerous sister-tongues have liberally added their testimony. Arabic literature and living speech step in where Hebrew tradition leaves a breach, and both supplement, and are supplemented by, each other and the Semitic varieties of cuneiform and other inscriptions. So it is also with Sanskrit, ancient Persian and the language of the Zendavesta. I remember very well the time, when owing to the lack of a Persian or Zend Dictionary I had to prepare my lessons in the Avesta and in the inscriptions of Bis\u00fat\u00fcn with the help of a Sanskrit Dictionary. This will, at least, show the great benefit philologically derived from a comparison of cognate languages, even where the modes of writing and the alphabets are radically different.\n\nIn Chinese philology we have not only a literature going back\u2014indirectly if not directly\u2014to great antiquity, but we have also a record of the ancient sounds and signs used at an early date. These together with the comparison of numerous idioms and dialects, enable us to assign what at first appears as a motley of heterogeneous languages to their legitimate mother.\n\nIn the Malayan family of languages we have no ancient monuments of literature, but we have a large variety of tongues, which may all be pressed into service to shed their scant light upon the history of the language. I call their contribut-\nion scant because the historic element is almost entirely wanting. We have as yet no data as to the time of division of the various branches of this family, though some writers have settled this question to their satisfaction by intuition, without, however, convincing the careful enquirer. Nevertheless the comparison of Malayan languages will lead us a considerable distance towards the solution of the problem of the proto-malayan language. Nor will this task be a very difficult one after the necessary materials for such a work have once been collected.\n\nIn the present paper we will attempt to study, in some of its phases, a more difficult subject, not the original form of words but the formation of words (Wortbildung). We will find not a little agreement in the manner of these formations in widely differentiated languages of this family, and this agreement must necessarily point back to a common source. Such a study, to be on a strictly scientific basis, should start from one of the more unchanged and original languages of the branch, preferably from the Batak (Batta) or one or the other of the Filipino vernaculars, and not from the highly disintegrated and corrupted Malay of the present day.* I have, however, willingly incurred the difficulty and undergone the inconvenience of making Malay the foundation of my remarks, because Malay is a language better known to my readers and consequently of greater interest to them.\n\nThe simplest formation of words of a new meaning in Malay is by\n\nI. REDUPLICATION.\n\nHerein and in the use of \"classifiers\" or numeral co-efficients the Malay family of languages is related both to the Chinese (Mongolian) and the Papuan languages. Let us en-\n\n*This must not be understood as in any sense disparaging to the usefulness and importance of the language. Malay has bought its popularity as a medium of speech over so vast a territory at the same price at which English has acquired its world-wide sway: Grammatical finesse and linguistically interesting forms have been lost in equal proportion as the language has affected larger circles of population.\ndeavour to classify the varieties of the meanings designated by simple reduplications.\n\n1. Specialization and differentiation.\n\nI believe that I place myself in opposition to every grammarian, who has written on Malay, by denying that reduplication is one of the modes of expressing the plural. I will not make any superfluous quotations, but in half a dozen grammars which lie before me, I find it stated that this is one of the plural formations, though in almost every case, the said grammarians find it impossible to state why the word should be reduplicated, as already the single word implies the plural, and why even the reduplication should be joined together with the adjective \u0633\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0644 segala which is universally accepted as indicating the plural. A few careful grammarians have noted the fact that only few words can form plurals by means of a reduplication. This observation should have led them to a correct understanding of the meaning of such alleged plurals. The universal paradigma of this \"plural\" in grammars is \u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650 raja-raja. It is well known that \u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650 raja alone can mean \"kings;\" now if raja-raja should be used to avoid ambiguity, or to distinguish it from a possible singular \"king,\" why should in almost every case \u0633\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0644 segala be added: \u0633\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0644 \u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650 segala raja-raja, where the translation \"all the kings\" or \"all kings\" is quite out of the question?\n\nIn accordance with other Malayan languages, including the Malagasy, I explain the reduplication as intended to specialize the sense of the word. A careful study of Malay literature, aside of any other language, might have led to a correct understanding of the expression. Take for example the ever-recurring phrase in Malay court novels:\n\n\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650 \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0633\u0631\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0633\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0644\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\ndi-hudap oleh segala raja-raja dan mentri, hulubalang serta biduanda sekalian (Isma Yatim, passim). Not once in this frequent phrase another of the nouns occurring in it, which are all plurals, is found in reduplication, such as mentri-mentri, hulubalang-hulubalang, biduanda-biduanda, while raja is always reduplicated. The heading of this paragraph will supply the explanation of the difference. While the other nouns denote certain offices or ranks, the members of which are equals among themselves, all being ministers or officers of the body-guard, or pages, the title \"raja\" includes all princes of royal blood (usually below the rank of tengku and engku), inclusive of that large class of attendants at court, who by some however distant blood relation with the ruling prince are thereby differentiated from outsiders. It cannot be denied that there is the greatest variation in rank included under this title, and this the Malay writer and speaker expresses by the reduplication. We may translate the phrase therefore: \"(The prince) waited upon by the various classes of Rajas, and the ministers, officers of the body-guard and the pages together.\"\n\nIf there should be yet a reluctance in giving up the long accepted view of seeing in these reduplications proper plurals in our sense of the word, I would refer the reader to those of the Malay classics, which, like the Bustanu's salatin*, the Taju's salatin, and of more modern works, the Taman Permata, are largely made up of Arabic quotations with their Malay translations. It is a very easy task to compare these translations with the Arabic originals, and it will be seen, that in every case where the Arabic plural is at all expressed in Malay, it is done by segala. Passages like these are of great interest to the student of the language, because they are the only\n\n*The Bustanu's salatin is one of the most interesting of all Malay works, especially as it is dated. It was written in Aceh, Sumatra, in 1641 (1040 of the Muhammedan era) by Nuru'ddin ibn Ali ibn Hasanji ibn Muhammad al Hamidi (the author is very careful in giving so much of his pedigree) under the patronage of Sultan Iskandar II. Of the seven volumes the first two have been published by R. J. Wilkinson in 1899 and 1900. I possess a MS copy of the seventh volume. The work deserves the careful study of all somewhat advanced students of the language.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nauthentic commentaries, giving us the exact meaning of the idiom of the writer, supposing however that he fully understood the Arabic of his quotation, which is highly probable in the majority of cases.\n\nThe \"specialization\" expressed by reduplication leads us to another closely connected meaning, which I do not hesitate to place under the same heading. To start from the same expression \\( \\text{\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650} \\ raja-raja\\), we have found that it cannot be translated \"kings,\" but that the meaning of \\( raja \\) has been specialized as meaning something not exactly a king, but only similar to one. This is a kind of specialization very frequent in Malayan languages. Of the large number of examples I can only quote a small portion, which will, however, fully suffice to explain the rule.\n\n\\( \\text{\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0629\u064c} \\ langit-langit \\), a sky yet not a sky: a baldachin;\n\n\\( \\text{\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0629\u064c} \\ buat-buat \\), to do, yet not to do: to pretend;\n\n\\( \\text{\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0631\u064c} \\ ular-ular \\), a snake, yet not a snake: a streamer, pennon;\n\n\\( \\text{\u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651} \\ ayam-ayam \\), a hen, yet not hen: a waterfowl;\n\n\\( \\text{\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064c} \\ jarum-jarum \\), a needle, yet not a needle, the needle of a balance.\n\nIn the same way \\( \\text{\u0641\u0648\u062a\u064a\u0647\u064c} \\ putih-putih \\) means whitish, not white, \\( \\text{\u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u064c} \\ biru-biru \\) bluish, not blue, \\( \\text{\u0645\u0627\u0634\u06a9\u064c} \\ masak-masak \\) to play at cooking, not to cook, \\( \\text{\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u064c} \\ anak-anak \\) a doll, not a child. \\( \\text{\u0627\u067e\u064c} \\ api-api \\), the mistletoe, which causes trees infested by it to have the appearance as if burnt by fire (api). Here it is also worthy of note that in order to express \"flaming\" anger or wrath the reduplication \\( \\text{\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0641\u06cc\u064c} \\ berapi-api \\) is used,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nwhile the proper word when speaking of natural flames would be berapi.\n\nTo this class belong expressions such as\n\nparang, long knife, parang-parang, a fish resembling it. pari, rayfish, pari-pari, a ring of rotan resembling in shape that of the ray.\n\nMany words are now found in reduplications only, which may possibly belong to the same class, though we have no means at hand to prove it. Such words are kanak-kanak, sida-sida and many others, while in many cases references to other languages help us to place the words under this group.\n\nSuch a word is laki-laki, manhood, courage, male, brave, which comes from laki, strong, great (so in Tagalog, in Malagasy: lehy). In Malay the single word signifies the \"stronger,\" but not the \"better\" half, the husband.\n\nI now append a short list of reduplications from cognate languages, which will show that in this respect the greatest similarity exists.\n\nReduplications expressing similarity not identity are in\n\nMalagasy:\n\nlahy, husband,\nvahy, wife,\nsala, wrong,\nfotsy, white,\n\nlehilahy, man, male;\nvehivahy, woman, female;\nsalasala, doubtful;\nfotsyfotsy, whitish;\n\nBatak:\n\nlahi, husband,\nboru, daughter,\n\nlahilahi, male, man;\nboruboru, female, woman;\nTagalog:\n\nputi, white, puti-puti, semen, sperma;\n\nI refrain from further illustrating the use of these reduplications by examples, as this would encroach too much upon the space at my disposal.\n\n2. Emphasis and repetition. The second meaning expressed by reduplication is emphasis and repetition. This is so common in almost all languages that it is not necessary to go into many details, especially as no radical change of meaning is effected by such reduplication. I select the following examples:\n\nhabit-habis, completely finished;\nharap-harap, to hope fervently;\nbulat-lulat (also in Tagalog) all, most sincere;\nlama-lama, for ever so long;\nlain-lain, (also in Tagalog) altogether different;\nendah-endah, very beautiful;\ntambah-tambah, to add repeatedly;\ndua-dua, by two and twos, etc., etc.\n\nIt may suffice to say here that this sort of reduplication is found in Tagalog, Batak, Malagasy and every other Malayan language.\n\nReduplications, which are combined with secondary changes of form do not interest us here, where we are treating merely of the reduplication of primitive words.\n\nWith regard to partial reduplication, such as\n\nlaki beside laki-laki,\npeparu beside paru-paru,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nTHE FORMATION OF WORDS.\n\ntetampan beside tampan-tampan,\njejamban beside jamban-jamban,\njejenang beside jenang-jenang\nbebram beside bram-bram,\n\nno special mention need be made, but that they are found in various Malay languages, (cf. Tagalog lalaki, male) and that they all belong to the first group of reduplications, those that express specialization and differentiation.\n\nII. ANCIENT VOCATIVE FORMS.\n\nIt may sound very much out of place to speak, in a language like Malay, which has neither declension nor conjugation, of a vocative case. Nor do I wish to imply, by the use of the expression, that the language has ever had a declension. Such a supposition appears to me altogether at variance with the genius of the Malay language. But there is no doubt, that in several of the languages of this family we find a peculiar change of form in words used in the address of persons, which may well be designated as vocatives, and this has been repeatedly done by careful grammarians. It cannot be denied that a considerable number of these expressions, to be presently mentioned, have already lost their distinctly vocative character in Malay, while some forms are losing their character more and more. It may be said that, with one or two exceptions, the forms mentioned here, having yet a distinctive vocative meaning, belong to the language of the past and are preserved almost exclusively in court language or in the poetic style.\n\nHere is a list of the commoner of these expressions:\n\nanang, oh child! from anak;\nading, oh younger brother! from adek;\nbapang, oh father! from bapa;\nembong, eldest child! from embok;\nindong, mother! from indok;\nachang, boy! messenger!\n\nI add to these vocative forms words like the following:\n\nabang, elder brother; inang, nurse (see examples from Batak below); dayang, maid; any, hang, as pronouns of the second person; sulong, eldest son: and with some diffidence I add the ancient names of divinities: yang and sang. All these words have distinct vocative forms, though they may have lost the vocative meaning, for it is easily seen, how these words, constantly used in the vocative, finally had to do duty for other cases also.\n\nWe have forms corresponding exactly to these in Batak, and here in fullest every day use. I mention only the following:\n\nam\u00e1ng, from \u00e1ma, father!\nin\u00e1ng, from ina, mother! (see inang in Malay);\nomp\u00e1ng, from \u00f3mpu, grandfather!\nhah\u00e1ng, from h\u00e1ha, elder brother or sister! (see Malay kakak);\nit\u00f3ng, from ito, elder brother! etc.\n\nThe only expression denoting close relationship in Batak, which has no vocative form in use is anggi, younger brother, though even this word becomes angging, when used in intercourse with younger friends, not brothers, just as it\u00f3ng (from ito) and ibot\u00f3ng is used as an address to elder friends.\n\nIn Malagasy all forms ending in ng have been changed, and this is the reason, I believe, why we have no formal vocatives. The case of address is expressed as in modern Malay by particles of exclamation.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39. 1903.\nIn Tagalog, and this opinion is strengthened by the same tendency mentioned above of Malay, the vocative has gradually gained ascendancy over the other cases, so that all nouns and adjectives and pronouns add to their vocalic ending (also to final n) the ending of the old vocative. So we have throughout the language.\n\ninang, mother, from ina;\namang, father, from ama;\npanginoong, master, lord, from panginoon. In order, therefore to distinguish the proper vocative it is necessary to add the particle of exclamation oy or ay, which corresponds to the Malay hei or hai.\n\nIII. ANCIENT ADJECTIVE FORMS.\n\nLexicographers, rather than grammarians, have noted the existence in Malay of some hitherto unexplained parallel forms, such as:\n\nmalang beside alang;\nmasing beside asing;\nmasam beside asam;\nmasin beside asin (cf. Tagalog ma-asin),\nmalap beside alap\n\nAn opinion regarding these forms, that they may be introductions from the Javanese, is disproved on closer investigation. By comparison with other Malayan languages, however, we learn beyond doubt, that we possess in these and a few other expressions highly interesting adjective forms. The need, in Malay, of a special form for adjectives must have certainly been felt, especially as the common forms used by us in that sense are indistinguishable from nouns. Though custom has given, to mention but one example, to besar the meaning of the adjective \"great, large,\" it must not be forgotten that in very many uses of the word it is a distinct noun. Take the following sentences:\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nhulubalang itu se-tengah tujuh kaki besar-nya.\nLembah itu dua batu lebar-nya.\nSungai itu dua puluh batu panjang-nya.\nBukit itu se-ribu kaki tinggi-nya.\nAnak itu se-puluh tahun \u2018omor-nya.\n\nIn these sentences we have besar (size), lebar (breadth), panjang (length), and tinggi (height) absolutely parallel with the Arabic noun \u2018omor (age). The substantive use of these \u201cadjectives\u201d is certainly the more original, and even now the more idiomatic.\n\nThe ancient adjectives were formed from these \u201croots\u201d by prefixing the syllable ma-. Such forms are in constant use in Tagalog, the languages of Borneo, Batak and Malagasy, as we will show by numerous examples, which might be increased almost ad libitum. They must have been used to a much larger extent even in historical Malay, and we should expect to find some remnants of this use in geographical names, where antiquities are much more likely to remain unchanged. It would be worth the labour of a student to make careful lists of Malay geographical names, laying stress upon peculiar expressions, and seeing that modern corruptions (in the mouth of Tamils, Chinese and foreign Malays) be eliminated. I will mention but one name belonging to this group. In the Province Wellesley we find the name of a hill and an adjacent town, usually spelled Bukit Mertajam. The latter word is a corruption of matajam, which means \u201csharp, pointed,\u201d Batak ma-tajom, and the name \u201cpointed hill\u201d is quite in accordance with the character of the elevation.*\n\nIn Batak a careful distinction is maintained in the use of the simple root and that of the adjectival form with the prefix.\n\nThe latter is only used as a predicate, never as a qualifying adjective. The sentence \u201cMa-timbo hayu on\u201d means: this tree is high, while the expression \u201cthis high tree\u201d is rendered by \u201chayu na timbo on,\u201d i.e. this tree which possesses height, which is high, this high tree. Other words belonging to this class are:\n\n* It is possible that the very word Malayu comes under this rubric. No previous explanation of the term has found general acceptation. The Tagalog \u201cmalayo\u201d means \u201cfar, distant, strange, stranger,\u201d certainly a very suitable appellation for the roving strangers that settled in the archipelago.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nmirara, from rara, red (Malay merah);\nmalemba, from lemba, faint. (Malay lembeh);\nmamora, from mora, rich (Malay murah);\nmapitung, from pitung, blind.\n\nIn Malagasy we have forms like:\nmalady, quick, manitra, fragrant, malaza, clever, renowned,\nmalama, slippery, smooth, mulemy, soft, tender (Malay lemah),\nmaloto, filthy, dirty, marina, just, righteous,\nmahitsy, straight, masina, holy, mainty, black (Malay hitam, Dusun meitam, Tag. maitim).\n\nIn Tagalog we find:\nma-itim, from itim, black, Malay hitam;\nma-lalim, from lalim, deep, Malay dalam;\nma-lambot, from lambot, soft, kind, Malay lembot;\nma-lapar(d), from lapar(d), hungry, Malay lapar;\nma-laki, from laki, strong, great, Malay laki;\nma-hina, from hina, weak, mean, Malay hina;\nma-lakas, from lakas, swift, strong, Malay lekas;\nma-sakit, from sakit, sick, painful, Malay sakit;\nma-puti, from puti, white, Malay putih.\n\nThe Dusun language of Borneo presents among others these examples: See Journal R. A. S., Straits Branch, vol. 30, 1897, p. 1. sqq.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nme-itam, black;\nme-suan, dark;\nm-iad, alike (from iad, form);\nm-alus, soft, from halus;\nm-onsom, sour, from onsom, cf. Malay masam.\n\nI think that these lists of words will leave the reader satisfied that we have here in Malay a few forms of great antiquity, which go back upon a time when the Malayan languages were not yet divided up into their present divisions, and it is only with the help of the cognate languages of the family that we can grammatically explain them.\n\nIV. ANCIENT VERBAL FORMS.\n\nIn the formation of verbs, where the modern Malay has effected the greatest change and simplification, we find nevertheless numerous traces of antiquity, of which the Malay has almost or altogether forgotten the original connection.\n\n1. Let me first refer the reader to pairs of words like the following.\n\n\u06af\u0631\u062a\u0646 getar, to tremble. \u06af\u0645\u062a\u0631\u06cc gemetur, to tremble vehemently:\n\u06af\u0631\u062a\u0627\u0646 gertak, to spur on, \u06af\u0645\u0631\u062a\u06a9 gemertak, to frighten with weapons;\n\n\u06af\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 gulong, to roll up, \u06af\u0645\u0628\u0644\u0648\u0646\u063a gemblong, rolled up and twisted;\n\u06af\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0646 gilang, to glisten, \u06af\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u0646\u063a gemilang, very glistening;\n\u06af\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0646 gilap, to glisten, \u06af\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u0646\u063a gemilap, very glistening;\n\u06af\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0648\u06a9 gelatok, to tremble, \u06af\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0637\u0648\u06a9 gemelatok, to tremble violently;\n\u06af\u0644\u06af\u0648\u06a9\u0647 gelequt, to tremble, \u06af\u0645\u0644\u0627\u06af\u0648\u06a9\u0647 gemelagut, to tremble violently;\n\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0646 turun, to descend, \u06af\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0646 temurun, farther descent;\n\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062e trang, light, \u06af\u0645\u0627\u0631\u062e temarang, half-light, glooming;\ntabor, to scatter, temabor, to scatter everywhere;\nchuram, steep, chemuram, declivity;\nlukut and lemukut, to pound parched grain;\ncherlang and chemerlang, to glitter, glisten;\nguroh and gemuroh, thunder, rolling noise;\ntandang and temandang, outfit, get-up;\ntali and temali, twisted cordage;\nand perhaps the following:\ntebok and tembok, perforated;\ntebat, and tombat, tied up;\ntanggong, to bear temenggong, dignitary.\n\nIn many cases the similar sense of the two words will invite an association between them, but this does not provide us with a grammatical explanation of the second form.\n\nWe have here forms of a conjugation, which in Batak Grammar has been designated as the Fourth, in Tagalog as the First Conjugation. It is formed by infixing into the verbal stem, after the initial consonant the syllable -um- (or, which does not concern us here, if the root commences with a vowel or labial letter, by prefixing the syllable um-). In the first case, -um- is called an infix, in the latter a prefix. Here are a few of the many examples which might be adduced:\n\nMalay: surat,\nBatak: sulat, sumulat, to write\nTagalog: Jour. Straits Branch\nsurut, surut, sumurut, to withdraw, to bend back.\n\nubah, uba, umuba, ubo, umubo, to change.\n\nIt will be seen that but for the fact that in Malay the vowel sign of the conjugation has weakened, being depressed from u to \u016b or \u0113, the above mentioned Malay forms fully correspond to the Batak and Tagalog forms. Such a slight change is nothing improbable, yet we need not indulge in conjectures in the face of even so slight a change, for we find most of the original forms preserved in Malay dialects, e.g. gilang-gumilang, gilap-gumilap, gelatok-gumelatok, turon-tumuron, churam-chumuram, lukut-lumukut, yuroh-gumuroh, etc.\n\nEven in the classes of verbs, which are conjugated according to this paradigma, the closest agreement exists. They are mostly verbs denoting visible motion, trembling, (See Malay: gemetar, gemelatok, gemelegut, etc.), and verbs, to whom this conjugation gives the power of \"intensiva\" (compare Malay gemetar, gemertak, gemilang, gemilap, gemelatok, gemelegut, temabor, etc.)\n\n2. We will now notice another class of verbal formations which also appear to be a remnant of a now obsolete conjugation. The examples given below do not exhaust the large stock preserved in the language, but are merely chosen to illustrate the existence of the conjugation, while many other words doubtlessly belong to this class, though their radicals have been lost to the Malay vocabulary.\n\ntekan, to press with the hand,\n\ntelekan, to lean on the outstretched and stiffened arm;\n\ntekap, to press softly with the hand,\n\ntelekap, to brush away with the hand;\n\ntingkah, character,\n\ntelingkah, to be of different character, to collide;\ntapak, and telapak, foot-print;\ntepok, to pat, telepok, to tap softly, as in applying specks of gold and silver flocks upon paper or cloth;\ntempap, and telempan, to lay the hand flatly on, to measure by hand's breadths;\nchupar, and chelupar, to babble incessantly;\nsaput, to cover with clouds, selaput, to cover densely or closely;\nsempang, to go off side-ways, selempang, to jump sideways;\nsampai, to hang clothes, selampai, to wear over both shoulders, like a shawl;\nsandang, to tie sideways, selendang, to wear sideways over one shoulder;\nsudang, and seludang; to decorate with flowers in a peculiar manner;\nsidik, and selidik to examine closely;\nsisih, and selisih, to quarrel, dispute;\ngosok, and gelosok, to rub;\ngembong, and gelembung, to bubble up:\ngegak, to make an indis-\ntinct noise,\ngegar, and gelegar, to vibrate;\ngetar, to tremble. geletar, to tremble violently:\ngetek, to be forward, as an impudent woman. geletek to feel sensual desire, to suffer of nymphomania,\ngugor, to drop, esp. when unripe. gelugor, a wild mango, which falls in large numbers, when unripe;\nkembong, to be swollen, kelembong, to be swollen, blown up;\nkangkang, to stand open, kelangkang, to stretch out the legs, wide open in indecent posture;\nkupas, and kelupas, to peel off.\n\nThe enumeration of such examples might be continued much longer, but I will add but a few words, which appear to belong to this class, though the primitive forms are not now extant in Malay:\n\ngelisah, to be restless;\ngel\u00eacheh, to slip, to glide;\ngelunchor, to slide down, to glide;\ngelipar, to glide out, as a knife;\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1908.\nkelupak, to open up, as the developing banana bud (cf. kupak);\n\nselubong, to cover;\n\nselongkar, to turn upside down;\n\nselengkar, to be anxious;\n\nselongkang, to be counterfeit;\n\netc., etc.,\n\nAll these forms indicate conjugational changes of the primitive words, with which most are coupled in the enumeration above. It is a conjugation which corresponds to the Tenth conjugation of Batak Grammar, and is formed by the infix -al- and another verbal infix or prefix. While there exist in Batak four different classes of these verbs, according to the difference of the infix or prefix combined with the characteristic of the conjugation -al-, the Malay seems to have preserved none but forms which combine the commonest of all verbal prefixes, me-, men-, meng-, mem- or meny- with the infix -al-. I know of no similar formations in Malagasy and Tagalog, though they might possibly be found after a more careful search, perhaps in a slightly varied form, in one or the other of the Philippine languages. I will, however, for comparison, subjoin one or two examples from Batak:\n\nmangh-al-aputi, to do hastily (from haput);\nmand-al-etes, to be open (as country without jungle);\nmand-al-ntus, man-al-utus, to glide swiftly along (as a boat under sail).\n\n3. Before closing my remarks on the ancient forms of conjugation in Malay, it is necessary at least to mention the most common of all verbal changes, the one which in Malay has superseded all the rest. I refer to the one marked by the prefix: me-, men-, meng-, mem- or meny-, all of which are really the same, modified slightly by combination with the initial consonants or vowels of the verbs. This conjugation is\nfound in all Malayan languages, as the following examples will show. By selecting Tagalog, Batak, and Malagasy verbs, which are also found in Malay, it becomes unnecessary to select a separate list of Malay examples.\n\n**Tagalog:**\n\n- *mang-aral (aral)* to teach, preach, Malay *mengajar*;\n- *man-ubus (tubus)* to redeem, Malay *menebus*;\n- *man-uti (puti)* to whiten, Malay *memutih*;\n- *man-ulat (sulat)* to write, Malay *menyurat*.\n\n**Batak:**\n\n- *mang-handang (handang)*, to fence, Malay *mengandang (kandang)*;\n- *mang-embang (hembang)*, to spread out, Malay *mengembang (kembang)*;\n- *man-urat (surat)*, to write, Malay *menyurat (surat)*;\n- *man-unu (bunu)*, to kill, Malay *membunoh (bunoh)*;\n- *man-obus (tobus)*, to redeem, Malay *menebus (tebus)*.\n\n**Malagasy:**\n\n- *man-enona (tenona)*, to weave, Malay *menenun (tenun)*;\n- *man-ampana (sampana)*, to separate, Malay *menyempang (sempan)*;\n- *man-dalo (lalo)*, to pass by, *malay melalu (lalu)*;\n- *man-doa (loa)*, to spit, *malay meludah (ludah)*;\n- *man-eno (feno)*, to fill, *malay memenoh (penoh)*;\n- *man-otsy (fotsy)*, to whiten, *malay memutih (putih)*;\n- *man-ono (vono)*, to kill, *malay membunoh (bunoh)*;\n- *man-irakira (kirakira)*, to finger, to count, Malay *mengira-ira, (kira-kira)*.\n\nThe writer of these fragmentary notes on Malay Grammar trusts that his readers will excuse the many imperfections of this article. Though the subject treated in these pages has occupied the interest of the writer for a considerable time, the actual writing was done under great inconveniences, in the spare moments of a very busy period, and without the advantage of a large library close at hand. He should, however, feel well repaid for having undertaken the task, if by his attempt others would be encouraged in taking up this inviting subject.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nThe Sakai and Semang Languages in the Malay Peninsula and their relation to the Mon-Khmer Languages.\n\nBY P. W. SCHMIDT, S. V. D.\n\nREVIEWED BY W. D. BARNES.\n\nIn the third and fourth numbers of the eighth part of the sixth series of the Bijdragen tot Taal-Land-en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsche-Indi\u00eb, published in 1901, is a paper by P. W. Schmidt, s.v.d., written in German with the title \"Die Sprachen der Sakei und Semang auf Malacca und ihr Verh\u00e4ltniss zu den Mon-Khmer-Sprachen.\" The following abstract of it will I think, have great interest for readers of the Journal.\n\nThe author begins his introduction as follows:\n\n\"More important than these connections with the Anamite language are the undeniable relations of our monosyllabic Khasi-Mon-Khmer root-stock with the Kohl language with that of Nancowry and with the dialects of the aborigines of the Malay Peninsula. We should not however be justified in deducing therefrom an ancestral connection with these partly polysyllabic languages.\" So wrote E. Kuhn towards the end of his 'Articles on the languages of Further India' Beitr\u00e4ge zur Sprachkunde Hinterindiens. Sitzgsb : d. k. bayer. ac. d. w. phil-hist. LL 1899 I. p. 219 f.f.) Thus he leaves open the question whether there exists between the Khasi-Mon-Khmer group and the Kohl languages, that of Nancowry and the dialects of the aborigines of the Malay Peninsula, an intimate actual relationship, or whether the evident identities are due merely to external influences.\n\n\"Some years later\u20141894\u2014E. (sic.) Otto Blagden in the Journal of the Straits Branch 27 pages 21-56, without apparently knowing anything of Kuhn's work put forward a more\ncomplete comparison of the Vocabulary of the dialects of the Peninsula aborigines with that of the Mon-Khmer (Anam) languages. But as his title \"Early Indo-Chinese influences in the Malay Peninsula, as illustrated by some of the Dialects of the Aboriginal Tribes\" shows, Blagden also did not go so far as to conclude that the identities to which he drew attention arose from any intimate connection between the two groups of languages. He says, 'But even to assume that the aboriginal dialects are cognate languages which should be classified in the Mon-Annam family would be going further than our evidence justifies us in doing.' Neither Blagden nor Kuhn had examined the whole material which is available on the subject of these aboriginal dialects. It is my purpose to collate this full material and to endeavour by its aid to remove the present uncertainty concerning these dialects and to settle their genealogical relation beyond doubt. For this purpose it is first necessary to settle the relationships of these dialects to one another, a task which in itself demands much labour since no comprehensive work has been done on the subject. The first half of my paper will comprise this comparison, and the comparison of the aboriginal dialects with the Mon-Khmer languages will occupy the second half.\"\n\nHis first part the author begins with a list of publications in which words, vocabularies, etc. from the aboriginal dialects have been given. This list is I presume the completest yet published and I give a full abstract of it. Journal of the S. B. R. A. S.

The author points out that several of the old lists are wholly or partly copies of one another and laments the infinite variety in the methods adopted by the different collectors in the spelling of words given. 'Clifford alone' he says (to some extent Blagden and Hewitt) makes a praiseworthy 'attempt to give a determinate value to the vowels used.'\n\nThe author himself employs throughout the system of Fr. M\u00fcller except that he uses g instead of dz.\n\nThe next 75 pages contain a vocabulary compiled from the various lists, etc., detailed above.

The author explains that it is possible that in some cases further enquiry or rather fuller material for enquiry may show that some of his roots may require correction, but contends that for his purpose the arrangement adopted is the most useful one. All hypothetical root-forms are enclosed in brackets. All Malay loan-words are omitted.\n\nNext follow the only available 'texts' viz:\u2014 those given by Skeat in Berisi by Clifford in Sen-oi and by de Morgan in Sakai of S. Kerbou and S. Raya, and in 'S\u00f6man.' The translations are given in each case.\n\nThe next thirty pages contain a discussion of the 'Grammatik.'\n\nThe fourth subsection of the first part is headed \"The relation of the dialects to one another.\" The author begins as follows:\u2014\"The questions as to the relation of these languages to one another and to their correct grouping are the more important since the races who speak them have no ethnological unity. The Sakai although sharply distinguished from Mongolian races have a more Mongoloid character than have the Semang. The Semang on the other hand belong as even B. H. Meyer's very critical examination shows, to the Negritoes. Our examination has therefore a further meaning in that it aids in answering the question whether these Semang-Negritoes have a language of their own.\" In the next nine pages the author examines in detail the similarities and differences in the vocabularies of the various dialects and concludes that, as far as the present state of our knowledge allows us to judge, the Sakai and Semang languages are one. He then points out the two marked groups into which this one language falls. In the one group come the words, etc., collected from 'Quedah-Semang' Semang of Tjoh. Steven's Semang, Semang of Ulu Selama, Mikonho-Maclay's Ulu Kelantan and Ulu Petani, Tomlin's Semang 'Jooroo-Semang,' in the other words, etc., collected from Bersisi, Palou, Ulu Indau, Sakei of Sungei Raya, Clifford's Sen-oi, Sakai of J. Kerbon, S\u00f6mang of de Morgan, Clifford's Tembe. Perak Semang and Chanderiang Sakai.\n\nThe author now points out that it is not safe to believe that collectors of vocabularies who have called certain races\nSakais or Semangs have in all cases correctly described them. He therefore tests these statements by the locality, physical peculiarities, etc., of the tribes in question. He points out that Semangs do not exist in the southern part of the peninsula and quotes R. Martin who gives as their country northern Perak, Kedah, Rahman, Rangan, and Kelantan, a description with which Stevens agrees. He further notes that the Semang use or have used the bow, and that there is no record of the Sakais having done so. He concludes that the Semangs in his first group are correctly described but that de Morgan's 'Soman' and the 'Perak Semangs,' and 'Kenning Semangs' mentioned in fifth volume of the J. S. B. R. A. S. may very possibly have been Sakais or at all events mixed races. The Sakai who form his second group fall linguistically into two sub-classes the divisions between which seem to be confirmed geographically by Clifford's line from Blanja on the Perak River to the Bidor Mountains and thence to Kuala Angin in Kelantan to the north of which line Clifford found his Tem-be to the south his Sen-oi. He concludes therefore that the Semang and Sakai form two different branches of one language and that the Sakai branch shows two sub-branches.\n\nThe second part is headed 'comparison of the Sakai and Semang languages' and opens with a list of books consulted by the author in his study of the latter. Then follows a list of those Mon-Khmer words and roots which are found to be similar to words and roots in Sakai and Semang. The author's comments on this are as follows:\u2014'The above agreements seems to me to be amply sufficient both in number and kind to negative the suggestion of 'A mere external borrowing.' As to the their number out of the 1249 forms contained in the vocabulary there are about 240 such agreements. That is in itself a notable result but it gains in meaning when two things are borne in mind:\u2014First that most undoubtedly a part at least of the materials for the Sakai and Semang languages are recorded with a wrong or uncertain meaning thus rendering it difficult or even impossible to find their correct equivalents in Mon-Khmer, and secondly that another part,\u2014more specially that collected by de Morgan and Stevens, is of such a nature (names of implements and individual parts of them, of individ-\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"ual plants, etc.,) that in any case corresponding expressions\n\"for them could hardly be expected. Finally it must be pointed\n\"out that in these prefix-languages it is most difficult to find\n\"corresponding words in dictionaries which are arranged al-\n\"phabetically according to the initial letters of the words, and\n\"that our vocabularies of a part at least of the Mon-Khmer\n\"languages are by no means complete.\"\n\nThe words showing similarity are next arranged in groups as\nfollows:\u2014Nouns: 18 such as God, Thunder, Night, Rain, Stone,\nFire, etc.; 8 such as Tree, Flower, Rice; 21 such as Louse, Fly,\nEgg, Dog, Elephant, Rhinoceros, etc.; 18 such as Man, Stranger,\nWife, Aunt, Nephew, etc.; 33 such as Blood, Hair, Mouth, Neck,\nBelly, Elbow, etc.; and 13 such as Clothing, Arrow, Knife, Stick,\netc.; Verbs: 61 including to go, give, sleep, fasten, see, sit, turn back,\ncry, call, speak, drink, etc.; and 33 Adjectives and Adverbs: such as\nmany, white, with, bad, sweet, cold, etc. The author continues:\u2014\n\n\"The comprehensive manner in which all kinds of correspondences\nare represented and more especially in which the names for\nalmost all parts of the human body show agreement and finally\nthe large number of identities in verbs and adjectives leave,\nin so far as an examination of the grammatical relations of the\ntwo groups of languages offers no obstacle, one conclusion\nonly, viz:\u2014that there exists an inward and intimate condition\nbetween the Sakai and Semang languages and those of the Mon-\nKhmer.\"\n\nThe author next points out that there is a small number of\nwords occurring in many Sakai and Semang dialects for which no\ncorresponding words can be found in Mon-Khmer, but he asserts\nthat the existence of these can not disturb the conclusion drawn\nfrom the total result more especially as further search in the\nmore out-of-the way dialects of Mon-Khmer may yet reveal them.\nHe then continues:\u2014\"As against these however great stress must\nbe laid on the part that for those particular words which con-\nstitute the difference between Semang and Sakai no parallels\ncan be found. If therefore we can rely upon our knowledge\nof the Mon-Khmer vocabulary it is very remarkable that it is\nthese words and these (so to speak) alone which fail us.\n\"When further we bear in mind that the words in question are\nsuch as are in constant use in every day life it seems most im-\n\nA.

It seems therefore very probable that we have in these words a remnant of the former Semang-Negrito-language. If that is really the case then further and more exhaustive research will certainly reveal still more material of the same kind. May this be a keen incentive to those who are in a position to make such researches to commence them without delay before the rapidly advancing disappearance of these races render further proof ever impossible! Perhaps we may be able to oppose some positive facts to that wave of theories which has burst over these poor Negritoess!\n\nThe next eighteen pages are occupied with a close comparison of the \"Grammatik\" of the two groups. The following conclusions are drawn:\n\n(i) The sounds are in essentials the same.\n(ii) The word-formation follows the same laws.\n(iii) The personal pronoun shows as much identity as can be expected.\n(iv) Pronouns and adverbs are in essentials demonstratively the same.\n(v) The syntactical relations of nouns, adjectives and verbs are the same.\n(vi) The numeral is the same in form and construction.\n\nThe author continues:\u2014Against these resemblances and identities no important divergencies are as yet opposed. When we consider them in conjunction with the wide spread identities in the vocabulary we are justified in concluding that the Sakai and Semang languages are intimately related with the Mon-Khmer languages and must be regarded as a member of that family. In the case of the Sakai languages this conclusion can be pushed further. When we consider the physical resemblances between the Sakai and the Mon-Khmer peoples we are justified in saying that the language now spoken by the Sakai was the original Sakai language.\n\nThe author then gives the following four physical characteristics of the Mon-Khmer people:\u2014\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n(i) Dolicho-cephalic skulls.\n(ii) Darkish skins.\n(iii) Eyes horizontal not oblique.\n(iv) Hair wavy not straight and not woolly; and he quotes R. Martin and Logan as proving that the Sakai have the same peculiarities.\n\nHe continues:\u2014\"It is otherwise with the Semang. Their \"darker colour, and woolly hair separate them anthropologically \"both from the Sakai and from the Mon-Khmer people. The \"fact that they speak what is essentially the same language can \"only be explained on the assumption that they have abandoned \"their own and adopted a foreign one. As is the case with the \"Negritoes of the Philippines the original Negriti language seems \"to have been lost although indeed in the case of the Semang a \"number of words appear to exist as a new want of it.\n\nThe paper here ends. It covers 180 octavo pages and is obviously the outcome of most careful and labourious work.

O. BLAGDEN.\n\nThere has recently appeared in the *Bijdragen tot de Taal-Land-en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie* a monograph of some length on the Sakai and Semang dialects, which may fairly claim to be the most comprehensive piece of work yet done in this connection and is therefore deserving of the attention of the readers of this Journal. It is the more interesting as being the first occasion for many years that a scholar of some standing in Europe has been attracted to the study of these dialects, and it will serve as a landmark for future collection and research in relation to his rather neglected subject.\n\nNever before have these dialects been submitted to the systematic comparison to which Professor Schmidt subjects them in his paper. It has been his purpose to collate all the existing published materials and to see whether any sound inferences could be drawn from such a comparison. He has actually omitted very little, and that little is not of the first importance. The sources from which he draws are carefully enumerated; they include, besides the previous numbers of this Journal the works of Newbold, Roberts, De Morgan and Vaughan Stevens as well as the vocabularies published by Klaproth, Tomlin, Low, Borie and Maclay so that they comprise practically everything of permanent value that had\n\n---\n\na.

Straits Branch\nThe author's merits, however, do not lie in the mere compilation of materials: he analyses his sources with the utmost ingenuity, showing how in some cases two authorities have borrowed from one source, which is sometimes a written, sometimes an unwritten one, and how the several vocabularies are related *inter se*. Here it might have been worth while to go even more deeply into the bibliography of the subject, and to show, for instance, that Klaproth's list is an unacknowledged copy from the one that appears in Crawfurd's History of the Indian Archipelago, eked out however with some additions from elsewhere, and to mention that Roberts merely copies, as he himself admits, from Anderson. In dealing with Newbold's somewhat irritating \"Benua\" list, the author rightly points out that it is a heterogeneous mixture of B\u00ebsisi with words from some S\u00ebmang dialect cognate to the one given by Tomlin (and Begbie); but his want of first-hand acquaintance with the spoken dialects of Malacca has prevented him from recognizing in it a third element, viz.: Jakun, which is represented by a good many words collected for Newbold by Munshi 'Abdullah, as related by the latter in his well-known Autobiography. It is worth noticing too, though the author does not mention it, that the older sources (i.e., prior to 1875) practically all deal either with the S\u00ebmang dialects of the North of the Peninsula (collected from Penang) or the dialects of the south (collected from Malacca). The latter barely take in the Southern fringe of the Sakai group, the purer forms of which, situated as they are in the centre of the Peninsula, remained quite unknown (except for the short notice by Colonel Low) until the introduction of the Residential system opened the Native States to European enquirers.\n\nq. I may, perhaps, be permitted, in this connection, to confirm the author's inference, drawn purely from internal evidence, that I did *not* copy the B\u00ebsisi words I gave in a former paper from my friend Mr. W. W. Skeat, or *vice versa*. Mine were collected in Malacca, his in Selangor. I venture to think it is rather a tribute to our accuracy that they exhibit so few serious discrepancies.\n\nr. Bearing these limitations in view and allowing for their occasional errors, the old lists are still very valuable and well worth studying, especially for the S\u00ebmang dialects.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 30, 1903.\nAfter discussing the sources, Professor Schmidt gives a comparative vocabulary of words of all the aboriginal dialects represented in them, reduced as far as possible to a uniform system of spelling and arranged according to the apparent relationships of the individual words. This has been very well done and must have been a difficult and troublesome task, but it is needless to say that such an arrangement (the only one possible for comparative study) is necessarily, in the present imperfect state of our knowledge of the subject, to some extent tentative and provisional. In many cases the author's assumption of an underlying affinity seems somewhat unconvincing. It is difficult, for instance, to believe that log\u207f is the same word as j\u00ebhu: true they both mean \"tree\" or \"wood\" (though I believe log\u207f = \"tree,\" Mal. pohon and j\u00ebhu = \"wood\" Mal. kayu), and there are, it must be admitted, forms in existence which seem to be almost intermediate between them, e.g., delok\u207f, jelop, j\u00ebhup and the like, but the evidence of identity does not seem to be quite conclusive, the more so as, apparently, the two variant forms appear on occasions together in one dialect.\n\nSometimes, too, in his natural desire to arrive at identifications, the author is inclined to take liberties with his authorities: e.g., he will have it that ge, \"to eat\" (in S\u00ebmang) is to be pronounced je, so as to bring it into line with the other and more common word for \"to eat,\" viz: cha (Sakai), chi (S\u00ebman). But the g in ge is hard, and the word appears to be quite distinct from cha and chi.\n\nIn compiling his comparative vocabulary, the author has designedly omitted words of Malayan origin. This is somewhat regrettable as the forms assumed by these words in the aboriginal dialects throw an interesting light on their phonology. Moreover the omission seems to involve the assumption that all such words are of comparatively modern importation from Malay, whereas in fact there are in these dialects words of undoubted Malayan affinity which cannot possibly have come into them in that way. Certainly such words as to'ot \"knee\", asu \"dog\" awe\n\n---\n\ns. See Dr. Luering's Ulu Kampar Sakai in No. 35 of this Journal.\n\nt. The process has not been quite completely carried out, some 50 words being left in, besides those noticed by the author.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n\"rattan,\" *siah* \"salt,\" *manuk* \"fowl,\" *kebus* \"dead,\" *hirum* \"black,\" point back to a Malayan dialect other than Malay, and the presence of such words, relatively few though they are, inevitably throws some doubt on the origin of others whose source, by reason of their being common to Malay and other Malayan languages, is necessarily a subject of uncertainty.\n\nThe omission of these words obscures one important element in the constitution of the aboriginal dialects which must not be left out of sight in any speculation as to their origin and affinities.\n\nIt is difficult to account for their presence in the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula except on the assumption that they represent relics of Malayan dialects locally evolved there and distinct from Malay itself, which is a Sumatran language not originally native to the Peninsula; and in that case their introduction must, it would seem, be of very ancient date, going back to the days when Malay had not yet become the language of the Peninsula; or to put the same thing in another way, some of these aboriginal dialects are, at any rate in part, derived from an independent Malayan origin going back to a remote antiquity. While, therefore, there can be no doubt as to the importance of the well-known Mon-Annam element in the aboriginal dialects, this very archaic Malayan element is equally deserving of recognition.\n\nThese points are not without importance, for the author's argument for the Mon-Annam origin of these dialects depends to some extent upon the percentage of Mon-Annam words which can be discovered in them: if therefore the aggregate number of words examined is unduly reduced, either by arbitrary exclusion or by doubtful identifications, it is plain that this percentage will be overstated. As the figures stand, the author reduces his words to about 1250 and of these he professes to identify about 240, say 20 per cent, as Mon-Annam. The comparison is made at a later stage, and it is rather anticipating matters to mention it here, but it is the main thesis of the article.\n\nMost of the identifications seem to be quite unassailable and even if they only account for something less than 20 per cent of the vocabulary, that is still a considerable achievement.\nBut a good many are at least doubtful, and one great element of uncertainty remains which it is at present impossible to eliminate, viz.: the question whether the so-called Mon-Annam languages themselves constitute a true family or are not rather a very mixed formation, embodying various elements of unknown origin.\n\nThe point is shortly this: so long as one is dealing with Peguan or Cambojan, about which, as they are written languages, a considerable amount is known, one is on relatively safe ground and can fairly refer words, that are attested by their appearance in these two languages, to the Mon-Annam group. But when it comes to words that reappear only in such dialects as Lemet, Cat, Sedang and the like, of which merely a few short vocabularies exist, while little or nothing is known of their structure, the genuine Mon-Annam character of such words is at least doubtful. The frequent comparisons with Cham which the author makes also illustrate this point: for Cham is, in part at least, a Malayan language. Such a word as cheong \"belly\" in S\u00e9mang, if it be really identical with the Cham tian, cannot be referred to a Mon-Annam origin, for tian is unquestionably Malayan, occurring as it does in several island languages of the Archipelago.\n\nThe fact is that one is dealing here with very mixed materials, and even the greatest care will not prevent an occasional mistake.\n\nAfter setting out the comparative vocabulary and the too few sentences which have been recorded, the author proceeds to give what is really the first attempt at a comparative grammar of these dialects. As a first attempt it can only be characterized as admirable.\n\nHe begins by discussing the sounds, both vowels and consonants: and here it is worth while laying stress upon his well-grounded complaint that collectors almost uniformly omit to give a key to their systems of orthography. If they would only be good enough to explain precisely how they intend words to be pronounced, the work of the comparative student would be much facilitated. The discussion of the phonology of these dialects brings out several interesting points. The nasal consonants are noticed; the nasal vowels, however, which are\nequally well-marked, are not observed by the author, that is not his fault: it may be explained that they somewhat resemble the French n sounds, but are not unfrequently followed by an ordinary consonant. The pronunciation of the palatal letters (ch, j, sh) seems to require further elucidation, as it is not quite clear whether they are identical with the corresponding English sounds or somewhat softer. There is a question whether all the so-called diphthongs are really diphthongs or merely two vowels in juxtaposition, each retaining its separate force. A few letters seem to be doubtful: e.g., z and j in Newbold's list, where the former represents a rough (probably palatal) r and the latter generally a p; but both z and j appear, though rarely, in S\u00e9mang, and z in a few Sakai words. On these points perhaps future collectors may throw more light.\n\nReduplication and repetition as modes of word formation are next noticed, and then follows a most valuable section on prefixes and infixes. Their existence as formative elements in these dialects has been pointed out before, though never worked out as completely as is done here. There can be no two opinions as to its importance, especially in relation to the closely similar formation of the Mon-Annam and the Malayan families of speech. It may however be as well to express a doubt as to the soundness of the author's view that a prefix can be assumed whenever a word appears in two slightly varying forms differentiated by their initial syllables, or by the absence in one case of an initial syllable which appears in the other. In the first place, the mutability of sounds in these dialects is something quite remarkable, but this need not imply that the syllable which changes is a prefix, that is to say a merely formal accretion and no part of the essence of the word: for the same mutability shows itself in the final consonants, which must surely be part of the root. Secondly, where there are two forms, a longer and a shorter, it is by no means certain that the shorter is always the original one: it may be only an abbreviation, the result of rapid speech and phonetic decay. Some allowance, too, must be made for the defective observation and spelling of some collectors.\n\nu. e.g., by Mr. W. W. Skeat in Selangor Journal, Vol. V, p. 328.\nv. The author gives instances of the interchange of k, -t and -p.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nStill, after making a reasonable allowance for these sources of error, there remains a large number of words in which the existence of prefixes is quite certain. Their meaning is more difficult to arrive at, but some, e.g., Ka- in B\u00ebsisi and ma- in S\u00ebmang are undoubtedly verbal, and there are others which are apparently adjectival and pronominal or demonstrative. One very curious verbal prefix found in a dialect of the Northern Sakai group (but by the collector, De Morgan, called S\u00ebmang) appears to vary its final consonant to suit the final consonant of the principal root: e.g. n\u00ebpchip \u201cto go\u201d, nebl\u00fcp \u201cto enter,\u201d n\u00ebkpok \u201cto open.\u201d This would seem to be in reality a combination of a prefix and a broken down repetition of the root word.\n\nThe author after comparing in succession the pronouns, personal, possessive, demonstrative and interrogative, proceeds to deal with the syntax of the substantive. It is worth noting that, so far as appears, the same system of syntax runs through all these dialects. The nominative (subject) precedes the predicate; the genitive, adjective and demonstrative pronoun follows the verb which governs it. Apparently there is no foundation, at any rate in the materials here analysed, for the theory that in S\u00ebmang the ideology is different.\n\nNext the numerals are compared: here there is a clear classification into groups, and as the numerals raise certain points of some difficulty and considerable interest it seems desirable to give specimens of the various types which occur. They are as follows:\n\n|   | I       | II      | III     | IV                  |\n|---|---------|---------|---------|---------------------|\n|   | S\u00ebmang. | Sakai.  | Sakai.  | B\u00ebsisi (and other southern dialects) |\n| 1.| nai     | neh (nei)| nanu    | mui                 |\n| 2.| bie     | nar     | narr    | \u2019mbar              |\n| 3.| (various)| ne\u2019     | ni      | \u2019mpe\u2019              |\n| 4.| (various)| (none)  | (none)  | npun                |\n| 5.| (none)  | (none)  | (none)  | m\u00e4sok\u201d             |\n| 6.| (none)  | (none)  | (none)  | p\u00ebru               |\n| 7.| (none)  | (none)  | (none)  | tempo               |\n\nFor three in S\u00ebmang the forms pat, ne, diu and for four sa-beh and nos are given. These seem doubtful; but all the forms...\ngiven in the above table are well attested, and it is noticeable how little agreement there is between the Sakai on the one hand and the S\u0113mang and B\u0113sisi respectively on the other. It is true that one appears to be the same in groups I and II and possibly this is due to the fact that II is a mixed group of Sakai with a tinge of S\u0113mang in it, as is evidenced by other words common to these two groups. But the author's attempt to derive the forms of groups I, II and III from the purely Mon-Annam forms of group IV is more or less conjectural, and even if it is correct it leaves one with the curious result that the pure Sakai is (as regards the numerals) further removed from the regular Mon-Annam type than the mixed B\u0113sisi and its neighbours. This group IV consists of a string of outlying dialects scattered along the border line between the pure Sakai and the Jakun, in a tract of country which extends from Ulu T\u0113mb\u0113ling and Kuantan (Pahang) to the Jasin district of Malacca and from Kuala Langat (S\u0113langor) to Ulu Indau (Johor). In this group alone do the numerals extend beyond four, and that fact as well as their singularly good state of preservation (in these very mixed dialects) seems to me to indicate that these Mon-Annam numerals were not native to the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula but were imposed from without, and that they either have nothing whatever to do with the Sakai numerals (from which they certainly cannot be derived) or that they have filtered through into Sakai in degenerate forms. It seems very unlikely that the pure Sakai first imposed its numerals (in a primitive form) on the Jakuns who speak B\u0113sisi etc., and then proceeded to corrupt them while the B\u0113sisi preserved them unchanged.\n\nSo far as this evidence goes, it appears to me to tell against the conclusion which the author ultimately arrives at, viz: that all the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula are branches of the Mon-Annam stock.\n\nIt will be seen, too, that it is a mistake to regard the various dialects as corruptions, in different degrees, of one single type\n\nw. Some rather dubious lists of numerals beyond \"four\" are given by two or three authorities, but all differ inter se and are suspected on that ground.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1902.\nof Sakai, represented in its purest form by the S\u0113noi dialect. This erroneous view has perhaps tended to discourage the collection of the other dialects, which has been stigmatized as useless except for the purpose of studying the progressive decay of the language. It is evident, however, that S\u0113noi, though no doubt on the whole the purest type of its own class of Sakai, cannot be called upon to explain all the other dialects, some of which appear to be in some respects nearer to the ancient forms.\n\nI need say nothing of the author's further comparison with the numerals of two Borneo dialects given in Mr. Ling Roth's work on Sarawak, as Mr. Ray (in \"Man\" 1902, No. 42) has shown that one of these so-called Borneo dialects is really a Sakai dialect of Perak collected by the late Mr. Brooke Low, while the resemblance of the other is very slight and clearly fortuitous.\n\nAfter pointing out that a fair number of words (some 50 or so, and all or nearly all of them of Mon-Annam origin) run through almost all the dialects, the author next proceeds to analyse the lists where they differ, with a view to discovering the relationship of the various dialects inter se and establishing a classification of them into groups. Considering the paucity of the materials for many of the dialects, this is really a brilliant piece of work, to which justice could be done only by going into details for which there is no space in this notice. The upshot of it is that the dialects of the Peninsula, so far as they are here represented, fall into the following groups:\n\nI. S\u0113mang:\n(i) A relatively pure S\u0113mang (and Pangan) group, curiously homogeneous though covering a large tract of country and extending from Northern K\u0113dah to southern K\u0113lantan;\n(ii) Another S\u0113mang group, less pure than the preceding, represented by (a) the \"Jooroo\" (Juru) S\u0113mang of the authorities, (b) the dialect given by Begbie (and Tomlin) and (c) certain words in Newbold's \"Benua\" list: apparently to be regarded as \"low country\" S\u0113mang as opposed to the purer dialects of the interior hills.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nII. Sakai.\n\n(iii) The T\u0115mbe\u2019 (or northern) Sakai group;\n(iv) The S\u0115noi (or central) Sakai group and the southern dialects, such as B\u0115sisi.\n\nSubstantially this classification, so far as it goes, would seem to be entirely justified by the existing materials. It will be observed that the main line of division (that between groups I and II) corresponds pretty closely with the difference in race between the Negritos (S\u0115mangs) and the Sakais, while the subdivision of group II into sub-groups iii and iv coincides with Mr. Clifford\u2019s distinction between T\u0115mbe\u2019 and S\u0115noi and agrees with Dr. Luering\u2019s statement (which is borne out by a comparison of their vocabularies) that the Ulu Kampar Sakais, who belong to sub-group iv, cannot understand the dialect of the Kinta Sakais, who fall into sub-group iii. So far at least as the Western half of the Peninsula is concerned, this classification will probably stand the test of further enquiry: in Pahang there appear to be dialects of a mixed character which partake of some of the characteristics of several of these sub-groups and have peculiarities of their own as well. Of these the author had no knowledge, as they have not as yet appeared in print.\n\nIt is probable that sub-group iv should be further subdivided into\u2014\n\n(a) Central Sakai, including S\u0115noi, the Southern Perak dialects and some of the S\u0115langor dialects, down to and including the dialect of the Orang Tanjong of Ulu Langat, and\n\n(b) B\u0115sisi and a straggling group of allied dialects in Southern S\u0115langor, the N\u0115gri S\u0115mbilan, Malacca, and part of Pahang.\n\nThis last sub-division runs along the borderland between Sakais and Jakuns; to the south and south-east of it come the more Malayan Jakun dialects of Johor and the neighbouring territories, and it is to be observed that the B\u0115sisi group, itself, though remarkable for the purity with which it has preserved the Mon-Annam numerals, contains a considerable Malayan ele-\n\nx. Selangor Journal (1895) Vol III pp. 244, 245.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nment. Similarly one of the chief differences between the S\u0113noi and the T\u0113mbe' groups is that the latter has more in common with Semang than the former. The purest S\u0113mang appears to be spoken in Central and Northern K\u0113dah and the adjoining States of Raman and L\u012bgeh, and the purest Sakai in South-eastern Perak, between Sungei Raya and Ulu Slim, and in the adjoining valleys of Ulu Pahang. Between these centres there is a debatable country in which are to be found more or less mixed tribes speaking mixed dialects partly S\u0113mang, partly Sakai.\n\nThe author's classification appears to be defective in one point, namely in ignoring the Jakun group of the South of the Peninsula: this group, whatever its origin, is now hopelessly broken down and almost swamped with Malay, but it is of some interest and apparently originally quite distinct from Sakai.\n\nHere we have, however, the first attempt at a systematic grouping of these dialects, and for this the author deserves every credit. He also brings out a most important fact, viz.: that, underlying the common Mon-Annam element which apparently runs through practically all these dialects, though in varying strength, and the comparative uniformity of which has led some former writers into the erroneous Pan-Negrito theory, there is in the S\u0113mang dialects an alien element, neither Mon-Annam nor Malayan, which may reasonably be assumed to be the remnant of the original speech of the Negritos.\n\nIt is a mistake to assert that there are but few words common to Sakai and S\u0113mang: the contrary is the case, such words being fairly numerous. But, apart from these, there is a body of words apparently peculiar to S\u0113mang and not derived from Sakai or any other known language. It is in these words that the original affinities of the S\u0113mang dialects will have to be sought (if indeed it is any longer possible to detect them) and not in the words which S\u0113mang has in common with Sakai and\n\n---\n\ny. I mean pure with reference to S\u0113mang and Sakai intermixture only, leaving Malay influence out of the question.\n\nz. By this I mean the notion (of Maclay and others) that the whole of the aborigines are of Negrito origin and that the differences amongst them depend merely, on the percentage of crossing with Malays.\nthe Mon-Annam languages of Indo-China. The author is fully justified in claiming to have established on purely linguistic grounds the existence of a distinct Semang group of dialects, spoken by and more or less co-extensive with the Negrito tribes of the North of the Peninsula.\n\nIt is true that the border lines of language and physique do not quite coincide: there are mixed Sakai-Semang tribes in Northern Perak who speak substantially Sakai dialects, while in Southern Kelantan and Terengganu there are tribes described as having the Sakai physical characteristics, whose dialects nevertheless must be classified as Semang. But the great point gained is that there is now proved to be a Semang group of dialects originally distinct from Sakai and retaining a considerable number of words for which no analogues have yet been found elsewhere. Instances of such words are (1) K\u00ebto, \"day,\" (2) Kawau, \"bird,\" (3) mako, \"egg;\" (4) ekob, \"snake,\" (5) ek, \"dog,\" (6) yus, nyus, \"tooth,\" (7) chas, \"hand,\" which are in no way connected with the corresponding Sakai words (1) jish, (2) chim (or chep), (3) tap, (4) taju, (5) cho, (6) lemun, (7) teku (or tihi). With the possible exception of No. 6, none of the above Semang words appear to be Mon-Annam; while, of the Sakai, Nos 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 certainly are.\n\nThe next section of the paper is occupied with a careful analysis of the mode of formation of the Mon-Annam languages. It is shown that the sounds correspond pretty closely with those of our aboriginal dialects; but the greatest stress is laid on the system of prefixes and infixes. In this place it is hardly practicable to do more than illustrate this point by an example or two, drawn from the author's specimens. Thus in Cambojan, from a word p\u00ebk, \"to fall to pieces; to split up; division,\" are derived the following:\n\n- pu\u00ebk \"part\"\n- pamp\u00ebk \"to divide\"\n- pumnek \"piece\"\n- prenek \"piece\"\n- prap\u00ebk \"division\"\nwhere the persistence of the root (here shown in italics) is clearly seen in spite of the apparatus of prefixes or infixes added to it. Another similar case is:\n\n- *k\u0101t* \"to cut off\"\n- *khn\u0101t* \"measure\"\n- *k\u016bmn\u0101t* \"piece\"\n- *thk\u0101t* \"pain\"\n- *t\u0101mk\u0101t* \"pain, suffering.\"\n\nAnalogous, though less elaborate, formations occur in several of the other Mon-Annam languages, and this system, it must be admitted bears a strong resemblance to the mode of formation of the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula.\n\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that it also finds parallels in the Malayan family, some members of which (e.g. the Philippine languages) have carried it to an even higher stage of complicated development. In fact the relation between the Malayan and Mon-Annam families in this particular are very puzzling: there is so much similarity in their structure and so little, relatively speaking, in their material or lexicographical elements. I suppose it may be regarded as certain that these two families of speech formerly bordered on one another in Southern Indo-China (and possibly in the Peninsula too) and, it would seem that while they were in contact the one group in some way exercised a profound influence on the other, probably in the way, mainly, of the Mon-Annam group absorbing Malayan elements, both material and formal. This makes it doubly difficult, in the case of the aboriginal dialects of the Peninsula which must have been evolved somewhere near the border line of these two families, to decide to which, if either, of them they originally belonged, seeing that the mode of formation in both is so very similar. In the apparent absence of suffixes and in some other respects, however, it must be admitted that the aboriginal dialects offer more analogy to the Mon-Annam than to the Malayan family.\n\nAfter analysing these formal elements, the author runs through the various parts of speech in the Mon-Annam languages\nand compares them with the corresponding ones in the aboriginal dialects, so far as the materials admit of such comparison. The upshot of the matter is that, in his view, on grounds of phonology, structure, and similarity of pronouns, demonstrative adverbs and numerals, as well as the number of other words already alluded to, the Sakai and Semang dialects are to be considered as essentially related to the Mon-Annam family. Further the author holds that, on anthropological grounds, the Sakais are to be considered as genuine members of the Mon-Annam group of races, and therefore that their dialects are not an acquired form of speech but represent their own original language.\n\nThis latter point is, unfortunately, very slightly handled. The author rests it upon (1) the dolichocephalic character (2) the dark complexion (3) the non-Mongoloid eyes and (4) the wavy hair of these tribes, characteristics which may be paralleled in certain of the Mon-Annam races.\n\nThis matter is, however, involved in great obscurity: for some of these characteristics appear to be absent in some of the Mon-Annam races. The Peguans and Cambodians appear to be decidedly Mongoloid in type, though with a difference: and the author's view requires us to believe that this is due to crossing with a Mongoloid strain which has obliterated their genuine original characteristics, while these have been retained in relative purity by some of the wilder tribes. The thing is possible. One knows that in Indo-China there has been an enormous amount of crossing of races, and it is conceivable that a slight strain of the strong Mongoloid type (which, as one sees in Straits Eurasians, is very persistent even when present in small percentages) might have modified the physical characteristics of the civilized members of the Mon-Annam stock (after the wild tribes had parted off from it) without seriously affecting their languages.\n\nIn the case of the Negritos the matter is not susceptible of the same explanation, and the author's view is that the Se\n\n---\n\na. I am assured by a Peguan that he can distinguish his own people from the Burmese by their more oval faces and more prominent (almost European) noses; and that wavy hair occurs, though rarely, amongst them.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 59, 1903.\nmangs have substantially given up their own languages and now speak dialects imposed upon them by a Mon-Annam race, that is presumably by their neighbours the Sakais, although they have preserved a good many genuine old S\u0113mang words.\n\nThe collection and analysis of new materials will show whether these conclusions are tenable. Personally I still incline rather to the view, suggested in a former number of this Journal, that most of the Mon-Annam words in these dialects have been imposed from without by the influence of a Mon-Annam race of higher civilization; and I think that the curiously pure form of the numerals in the otherwise mixed group of dialects to which B\u0113sisi belongs supports this view. It would not however be inconsistent with this idea to hold that the Sakai dialects are also of Mon-Annam origin, though much more distantly related to the parent stem: and that would perhaps account for the divergence of the Sakai numerals from the normal type. In that case we should have two waves of Mon-Annam influence in the Peninsula, as well as two of Malayan, and the analysis of the dialects would be somewhat as follows:\n\nI. Common elements running through practically all the dialects\u2014\n\n(1) Malay;\n(2) Mon-Annam of the purer type;\n(3) Malayan, other than Malay.\n\nII. Separate original elements.\n\n(4) In S\u0113mang: the original language of the Negritos, whatever that may have been (possibly akin to Andamanese?)\n(5) in Sakai: a rude Mon-Annam form of speech (?)\n(6) in Jakun: Malayan (?) and if so, identical with (3) above (?).\n\nIt is evident from what has been said that though some progress has been made in the study of these dialects, much remains to be done; and as the author's main purpose, as stated by himself, is to encourage further research, it is to be hoped that collectors will be stimulated by his valuable paper, and will take the matter seriously in hand. Above all it is absolutely necessary to obtain a large number of genuine sentences, as\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nactually spoken by the aborigines: mere lists of words have their value, but the only chance of getting an insight into the grammar of a language lies in the collection and analysis of sentences, and that is now the most urgent desideratum in connection with these dialects. Such work can only be done properly by men on the spot and thoroughly conversant with local circumstances, and the task should be undertaken at once, before the imminent extinction of these dialects makes it forever impossible. In view of the high value, from a scientific point of view, of such researches (which is attested by the interest taken in them by a scholar of European reputation like the author of the paper I have attempted to review) I venture to express the hope that the Governments of the Straits Settlements and the Native States will follow the good example, in these matters, of the Indian Government and will give some assistance, or at least encouragement, towards a systematic linguistic survey of the Peninsula on the lines of the Linguistic Survey of India.\nThe Contents of a Dyak Medicine Chest.\n\nBY BISHOP HOSE.\n\nA few days ago I was in the upper part of the Saribas river, the home of the race once celebrated throughout Malaya for daring deeds of piracy. My companion was the Rev. William Howell, the joint author with Mr. D. J. S. Bailey of 'A Dictionary of the Sea-Dyak Language,' and an authority on all subjects connected with the religious and other customs of that people. We had ascended the Padih, an affluent of the main river, to the village of Kundong, where we were going to spend the night in the Dyak house, of which Brok is the tuai, or head-man. The house is of moderate length, about twenty doors; and as usual the apartments of the tuai are near the middle of the building. There we were hospitably installed on the ruai, or undivided hall, (sometimes described as a verandah), which extends throughout the whole length of a Sea-Dyak house, and occupies about half of its area. The good mats were brought down from the sadau, or loft, and spread for us; the rare luxury of a chair was provided for me and there we talked, and taught, and answered questions, and dispensed medicines, while the inhabitants of the other rooms gathered round us, as well as the occupants of our host's private quarters. There also we ate, and there we slept when the kindly people would at last consent to our going to bed.\n\nThe majority of the 'rooms,' i.e. separate tenements, in this house are inhabited by Christians of long standing, but there are a few who have not yet come in. Amongst them is a Manang, or Doctor of Magic, named Dasu, who has a large practice in the neighbourhood. I was anxious to interview him in order to get some information that I wanted for the purpose of comparing the original spiritual beliefs of the Borneans with those that underlie the Mohammedanism of the Malays of the Peninsula. I was also desirous of ascertaining how far the methods of the\nDyak Manang, when undertaking to cure diseases, resembled those of the Pawang and Bomor, his Malay confr\u00e9res.\n\nAt our invitation Dr. Dasu came out of his room readily enough, and sat down with us to chat and smoke a cigarette. He talked freely and intelligently about such matters of general interest as happened to be broached, especially the late expedition against the turbulent people of the Ulu Ai, and the terrible epidemic of cholera which was just passing away. But as soon as we began to give the conversation a professional turn, and speak of the practice of medicine by the native doctors of the Saribas, he put on a look of impenetrable reserve, and could hardly be persuaded to speak at all. There is reason to believe that this was chiefly owing to the presence of Howell. He has succeeded in winning the confidence and affectionate regard of Dyaks to an unusual degree, but he is unpopular among the Manangs. His teaching has led people to think for themselves, and wherever he goes the business and the gains of the village doctor shew a tendency to decrease. Moreover several of the fraternity have submitted to his influence, abandoned their tricks, and taken to honest farming. It is known too that some of these have surrendered their whole stock of charms to my friend, and have also made dangerous revelations, whereby the profession has been much discredited.\n\nSo Dr. Dasu was only with great difficulty induced to impart to us his knowledge. He told me after more confidential relations had grown up between us, that he suspected me of an intention, by some means or other, to get possession of his precious materia medica, and so deprive him of his means of living. However his fears were removed by repeated assurances that it was information only that I wanted, and that I was consulting him just because I preferred to get it direct from a professor of repute, rather than trust to reports received from white men. At length we persuaded him to be gently catechised. I got some precise answers to my questions respecting certain articles of Dyak belief which had been variously defined by different investigators, and about which my ideas had been a good deal confused. But those matters are not the subject of this note. It is the concluding incident of the rather prolonged interview that I propose to describe.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nWe had talked to one another so pleasantly and frankly that I thought I might ask Dasu as a great favor to show me his Lupong, or Medicine Chest, and the charms of power which it contained. It was quite evident that this aroused his suspicions again, and he retired within himself as before. But the principal people of the house, who were sitting by us, urged him to consent, and, as old acquaintances of mine, assured him of my good faith. So he was at last persuaded, and went to his own room to fetch the treasure.\n\nAs I have said, the good mats of the household, as is usual when it is intended to show respect to a visitor, had been taken down for our accommodation from the place where they are stored. But we now saw that the most valued of them all had been held in reserve. This, which was made of fine and very flexible rotan, the latest triumph of the skill and industry of our courteous hostess Ipah, Brok's wife, was now handed down and spread in front of us for the reception of the great man and the mysterious implements of his profession. After some considerable delay, probably intended to excite our curiosity the more, he appeared and sat down on the mat prepared for him: a subdued murmur of applause and satisfaction greeting him as he took his seat.\n\nA Manang's Lupong, or case for holding his charms, may be almost anything. Sometimes it is a box, sometimes a basket, sometimes a bag. In this instance it was an open-mouthed basket made of thin shavings of bamboo, hung round the neck of the owner by a strip of bark.\n\nBefore beginning the exhibition Dasu made a little formal speech, in which with much show of humility, he spoke in depreciation of his own powers and knowledge, and of his collection of remedial charms, as compared with those of other members of the profession elsewhere. These remarks were of course received with complimentary expressions of dissent from the audience: and then at last the contents of the basket were displayed before us. They were tied up together in a cloth bag, the most highly prized being further enclosed in special receptacles of their own, such as a second cloth covering, a little bamboo box with a lid, or a match-box. They were ceremoniously brought out and placed side by side on the mat.\nof honour. I was then invited to handle and examine them, and the name and use of each were told me without any fresh indication of unwillingness. This is a list of them.\n\ni. *Batu bintang*, or Star-stone; a small transparent stone rounded by the action of water till it was almost spherical, with a rather rough surface. The *Manang* looked upon it as his badge of authority, and told the following story of the way he became possessed of it. Many years ago, in the interval between harvest and the next seed-time, he was working as a cooly in Upper Sarawak. There he had a dream in which he was visited by the being whom he looks upon as his guardian-spirit. As in all cases when this spirit has had any communication to make to him, it appeared in the form of a tortoise. It told him that he must forthwith put himself under instruction in order to be qualified for the office of a *Manang*: and that if he neglected this command all the spirits would be angry, and death or madness would be the penalty. When he awoke he found the *Batu bintang* by his side, and had no doubt it was the gift of the spirit. Accordingly he did as he was bidden without loss of time. He acquired the professional knowledge and the stock in trade which were necessary, and was at last duly initiated with all the proper rites and ceremonies.\n\nii. *Batu krat ikan sembilan*, or The petrified section of the Sembilan fish. This was a curious object which I could not quite make out. It was oblong in shape, about two inches long, one inch broad, and half an inch thick in the middle, but getting suddenly thinner towards the two edges till it became not more than $\\frac{1}{16}$ of an inch. The thick part was hollow, having a large oval-shaped perforation going through it. It resembled a section from the middle of a large winged seed, but heavy for its size, and feeling like stone. I could not of course test this by cutting or scraping. When used it is soaked for a time in water; the water is then given to the sick man to drink, or is rubbed gently upon the part of his body which is affected.\n\niii. *Batu lintar*, or Thunder-bolt: a small dark-coloured stone, about an inch and a half long, and a quarter of an inch thick at the base, tapering to a sixteenth of an inch at the point; curved and rather like a very small rhinoceros horn, and highly polished. It was probably the same kind of stone as that of\nwhich the stone implements found in the Malay Peninsula are made, which are also called Batu lintar. It is pressed firmly against the body wherever pain is felt.\n\niv. Batu nitar, another name for Thunder-bolt: a minute four-side crystal, half an inch long and about two lines thick. A charm to be used only in extreme cases. It is dipped in water and then shaken over the patient. If he starts when the drops of water fall upon his body he will recover, otherwise he will die.\n\nv. Batu krang jiranau, or Petrified root-stock of jiranau (a Zingiberad?). They told us this is the Dyak name of a kind of wild ginger. The word is curiously near to Jerangau or Jeringu, which Ridley says is Acorus calamus: \"a plant much used by native medicine-men,\" (Wilkinson, Malay-English Dictionary.) The thing so called was possibly part of the back-bone of some animal, bent double and the two ends tied together, each vertebra brown and shining after long use. A charm for dysentery and indigestion, and also for consumption. It is dipped in oil, and rubbed on the patient's body in a downward direction.\n\nvi. Batu ilau, or Sparkling stone, also called Batu kras, or the hard stone. A six-sided crystal, two inches long and three quarters of an inch thick. One end appeared to have been formerly stuck into some sort of handle, as it was covered with malau, or lac. This is the indispensable sight-stone to be looked into for a view of that which is future, or distant, or otherwise invisible to ordinary eyes. It is specially used by Manangs, for discovering where the soul of the sick man, wandering away from the body, is concealing itself; or for detecting the particular demon who is causing the illness.\n\nThere were also, jumbled up together at the bottom of the bag, a number of tusks of wild boar, pebbles, and other rubbish, but these were pronounced to be utai ngapa, things of no importance. One article that we hoped to find was absent. Dasu said he should be glad indeed to have it, but it had never come in his way. It is the Batu burung endan, or Pelican stone. He explained to us that this is a stone which has the magical power of securing the presence and cooperation of a spirit who dwells in the form of the endan, (pelicanus malaccensis). When the Manang is seeking to enter Sebayan, the Spirit world, in search\nof the errant soul of a sick man, this demon can ensure to him a swift and unimpeded passage thither and back again.\n\nWhile Dasu was telling us the story of his vision of the Tortoise spirit who gave him the Batu Bintang I watched his face carefully for any sign that he believed, or did not believe his account. I could not be sure: but I am inclined to think he did not. He seemed relieved when we had finished our examination of his possessions, and he could pack them all up and carry them off to the security of his own dwelling.\n\nSeveral similar collections of charms have at different times been given to me, obtained from Manangs who have become Christians but it was particularly interesting to me to have a set actually in use exhibited and explained by their owner, and I have thought that a description of them might possibly have some interest for other Members of the Society.\nNew Malay Orchids.\n\nBy H.

Soc. 1857, p. 117, from Sarawak. It is in no sense a Cynips in the modern meaning, and belongs to the parasitic branch of the family.

The apical abscissa of the radius is shortly, but distinctly, longer than the basal two united; the upper part of the 1st cubital cellule is hyaline. The basal segment of the abdomen is smooth and shining; the other segments are closely, rugosely punctured and more or less striated in the centre; the basal keel on the 2nd segment is smooth, shining, long and narrow; its keel is narrow and indistinct and extends to the apex of the segment, which is irregularly reticulated on either side of it; this part is obliquely bounded by a raised border: the lateral depression is, on the inner side, closely striated. The suturiform articulation is deep, clearly defined and longitudinally striated; the other furrows are less clearly defined.

Legs thickly haired, the hinder tibiae grooved on the outer side. The raised central part of the petiole is rugosely, longitudinally striated: the striae are irregular and intermix; the depressed sides are longitudinally striated, more regularly and distinctly than in the centre. The 2nd 3rd and 4th segments are closely longitudinally striated; on the 4th the long-\nitudinal stri\u00e6 are mixed with transverse finger stri\u00e6. The sutures are closely striated. The area on the base of the 2nd segment is long and narrowed, extends to shortly beyond the middle and becomes drawn out into a fine point. The oblique depressions on the 3rd and 4th segments are shallow and not very distinct. The sheaths of the ovipositor are thickly covered with hair.\n\nThe toothed apex of the antennal scape is not so prominent as it is in the type (C. lamellata, Cam.) A characteristic of the genus is the long front tarsi which are more than twice the length of the tibiae.\n\nIn Mr. Ashmead's generic synopsis of the genera of Braconidae (U. S. Nat. Mus. Bull. xxiii, 137) no mention is made of the broad front plate, stress being laid on the toothed apex of the scape which is probably only of secondary importance. Chaolta Cam. (Manchr. Memoirs, 4th May, 1899, No. 3, p. 81) is identical with Blastomorpha, Szepligeti, Termesz, Fuzetek; xxiii, p. 50, 1900.

The face has a distinct yellow tint. The 1st cloud in the wings is irregularly rounded behind, is narrowed above, behind it follows the transverse basal and transverse median nervures, at the apex the recurrent nervure; the 2nd is of almost equal width: the apical cloud commences near the 2nd transverse cubital nervure and below extends backwards to nearly opposite the lower part of the 1st transverse cubital. The raised area on the 2nd segment is large, extends to the middle of the segment, becomes gradually narrowed to the apex, with the sides rounded, not straight; its sides are depressed; at the apex is a depression which has a keel in the middle.\n\nJour.

The basal plate on the base of the second segment is longer than broad, narrowed towards and longitudinally striated; the keel is narrow; the suturiform articulation and the furrow on the 3rd and 4th segments are striated closely; the 4th dorsal segment projects bluntly in the centre; the 3rd and following segments are narrowly edged with whitish-yellow on the apex.\n\nSigalphogastra, gen. nov.\n\nAbdomen with 5 segments, the 3 middle ones broader than long, the basal and apical longer in proportion to the breadth; all the segments longitudinally striated; the last broadly rounded at the apex; the apical 3 with transverse crenulated furrows on the base. Median segment with a stout keel in the centre at the base and two curved narrower, sharper keels on the apical half. Temples broad, slightly roundly narrowed. Malar space large. Wings as in Bracon. Legs rather slender, the tibi\u00e6 and tarsi densely pilose.\n\nThis genus possesses all the characteristics of the Braconini except as regards the marked difference in the form of the abdomen. In the Braconini there are 7 segments which become gradually smaller; in the present genus there are only 5 large segments of almost equal size. The form of the abdomen reminds one of the Cheloninae, but that group does not belong to\nthe Cyclostomi. In our genus the mesonotal furrows are complete: there is a crenulated furrow at the base of the scutellum which is moderately convex; there is a distinct curved furrow at the base of the median segment; the scape of the antennae is long and slender, the pedicle is of equal width, broader a little than long and transverse at the apex; the first 3 joints of the flagellum are long, fully 3 times longer than wide and of equal length.\n\nThis genus clearly comes close to Chelonogastra, Ashmead (Bull. U. S. Mus. xxiii, 139) from Japan. It may be known from our genus by the abdominal segments being unequal in length; the 1st and 2nd occupy most of the surface, the 4th and 5th being very short; the first three joints of flagellum are scarcely longer than thick, etc.\n\nSigalphogastra Ashmeadii, sp. nov.\n\nHead and thorax ferruginous, the antennae, abdomen and hinder legs black; the fore legs rufous; the middle dark testaceous; the head and thorax smooth and shining, the metanotum with a few irregular keels in the centre; the back of the abdomen strongly, irregularly longitudinally striolated; the wings hyaline, the nervures black; the stigma fuscous below. \u2642?\n\nLength 7 mm.\nHab.

The centre of the petiole is raised, clearly limited; its sides raised, broad at the base, its apex narrowed; there is an irregular row of oblique keels on the sides. The area on the 2nd segment is large, broad at the base, becoming gradually narrowed to the apex; it is finely irregularly longitudinally striated, the rest more strongly transversely striated; there is an oblique keel outside this; the part on either side of this is stoutly obliquely striated; the last segment is more closely and regularly striated than the others.\n\nR.

Abdomen sessile; the basal segment longer than the 2nd, which is as long as the 3rd and 4th united; the 3rd 4th and 5th segments are equal in length and width. The suturiform articulation is distinct throughout, wide, deep. The basal 4 segments are closely punctured and obscurely striated; the apical segments are bluntly pointed; the ovipositor not projecting. There is a deep curved furrow on the lower side of the mesopleur\u00e6 in the centre. The radius originates behind the middle of the stigma; the 2nd transverse cubital nervure is faint. The hinder coxae are elongate; they are slightly longer than the trochanters which are long, slender and curved. The spurs are short. The hypopygium is large. The 1st abscissa one-third of the length of the 2nd.\n\nIf it were not for the absence of keels on the basal abdominal segments I should have felt inclined to have placed this genus with the Rhogadini. The only other group in which it can be placed is the Rhyssalini. Characteristic is the well-marked furrow on the mesopleur\u00e6.\n\nDedanim\u00e6 longicornis, sp. nov.\n\nLuteous, covered with a pale pubescence; the ocelli and the antenn\u00e6 black; the wings hyaline, the stigma and nervures black; the basal 4 segments of the abdomen closely longitudinally striated. \u2640.\n\nLength 7 mm.\nHab.

Wings with 3 cubital cellules: the 2nd longer than the 1st and shorter than the 3rd. In the hind wings the pobrachial transverse nervure is interstitial with the praebachial. The costal areolet is much longer than the radial; the pobrachial nervure is obsolete. The transverse median nervure in the fore wings is not interstitial being received shortly beyond the transverse basal. Abdominal petiole long, longer than the 2nd and 3rd segments united; it is of uniform thickness throughout and is nearly as wide as the 2nd segment. The 2nd segment bears 2 narrow furrows which extend from the base to the apex; the suturiform articulation especially at the sides, and is slightly curved. The ovipositor is long. The anal nervure in the hind wings is interstitial. The hinder coxae are not produced in front.\n\nThis genus does not fit very well into any of the tribes of the Cyclostomi but may, for the present, be referred to the Doryctides.

The triangular area on the second segment is closely, finely rugosely punctured; there is a smooth line down the centre of the face with a furrow in its middle. The furrow on the base of the mesonotum is wide and smooth: the depression behind it is bordered laterally by 2 irregular keels and there is also a curved keel on the inner side at the base; the space between the 2 keels and outside them are irregularly crenulated.

D.\n\n(With two plates.)\n\nAbout three years ago, during some excavations near the mouth of the Malacca river, a considerable number of coins was found scattered in the mud. These were collected together and handed over to the Hon'ble W. Egerton, Resident-Councillor of Malacca at the time, and presented by him to the Raffles Museum. The collection has proved to be of the greatest interest. It contains coins of both Asiatic and European origin, the European coins, Portuguese, Dutch and English, embracing practically the whole history of the various European occupations of Malacca, covering thus a period of about four hundred years. The most interesting of the coins are those of Portuguese origin, all of tin. They are probably quite unique: the British Museum does not possess any, and numerous enquiries I have made about them in various places, including Lisbon, have remained without result. With regard to their discovery Mr. Egerton writes:\n\n\"The Malacca Coins were found in digging a channel from the mouth of the river seawards. Outside the mouth there is a deep pool, and beyond that a bank submerged at high water, extending some half mile or more seawards. It was in this bank the coins were found scattered here and there, not in large pockets. The bank contained quantities of household detritus, broken crockery and old ironware, bricks, earthenware, etc. I think it is quite possible buildings on piles, like those now seen on the foreshore, may have been built on this bank, or possibly all this rubbish was thrown out of ships at anchor, or washed down out of the river. Most of the coins were found in the first hundred yards outside the big pool referred to above. There must be many still there.\"\n\nI. THE ASIATIC COINS.\n\nThat tin coins, struck by the inhabitants of the place, existed in Malacca before the arrival there of the Portuguese is\nproved by certain accounts in Albuquerque's Commentaries (2)*, but the fact seems to have almost escaped numismatologists, for Millies (12), p. 140, speaking of the currency of the Malay Peninsula says: \"M\u00eame l'\u00e9tat malai si c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de Malaka, qui \u00e9tait parvenu \u00e0 son apog\u00e9e au commencement du XVIe si\u00e8cle, lorsqu'il tomba sous la force mat\u00e9rielle majeure et l'h\u00e9ro\u00efsme des Portugais, ne nous a laiss\u00e9 aucun monument numismatique connu, et nous ne savons m\u00eame pas, si ce \u00e9tat malai poss\u00e9dait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une monnaie propre.\" In this Millies is certainly wrong, for in Albuquerque's Commentaries (2), Vol. III, p. 77, we find a mention of native coin which tells how King Xaquendarxa (i.e. Iskander Shah), ruler of Malacca, went to see the king of China, wishing to become his vassal and took with him many presents, receiving in return, amongst other privileges, permission to coin small \"money of pewter, which money he ordered to be made as soon as he reached Malacca; and to it he gave the name of Caixes which are like our (i.e. Portuguese) ceitils, and a hundred go to the calaim, and each calaim was worth, to an appointed law, eleven reis and four ceitils. Silver and Gold was not made into money, but only used by way of merchandise.\" The fact that Malacca possessed native pewter coins on the arrival of the Portuguese becomes indisputable when we read that Albuquerque after the occupation of Malacca minted coins under the name of his king, D. Manuel, \"in order to withdraw and suppress the coinage of the Moors and cast their root and their name out of the land,\" and that when the new coinage was ready, he gave orders \"that all the Moors who held coin of the King of Malacca should convey it thither\" (i.e. to the mint) \"without delay under pain of death; and so great a quantity of money was thus carried there out of fear of the penalty which had been appointed to them, that the officers could not dispatch their business fast enough.\" (Vol. III, p. 138).\n\nI am sorry I cannot furnish absolute proof that the collection really contains coins of that early period. There are about 150 tin coins with Arabic inscriptions, but those few which are clear enough to be deciphered are of a much later date. It may be that the most worn and defaced coins belong to the period\n\n*These numbers refer to the list of Literature at the end of the paper.\n\nJour.

Wilkinson kindly identified this coin for me, and I subsequently found it figured and described by Netscher and Van der Chijs (13,) p. 179, pl. XXVI, fig. 245, and by Millies (12,) p. 148, pl. XXIII, fig. 250. The specimen described by the former two authors has also one side entirely smooth, and they state that the title maliku 'l-'adil is used by several rulers of Western Borneo. According to them the coin would have come from Sambas or Mampawa in West Borneo and date from the year 1822. Millies, however, refers the coin to Trengganu.*\n\n(6). The coin figured on pl. II, fig. 2, seems to bear only a portion of the inscription maliku 'l-'adil on the one side, whilst the characters on the other side are too indistinct to be deciphered.\n\nSome of these tin coins may possibly have come from Sumatra. Marsden (9), p. 401, speaks of tin coins current in Acheen, and Netscher and Van der Chijs (13), p. 162, too describe such coins from Acheen, as well as from Palembang, Jambi and the neighbouring island of Banka, but I have not been able to identify any fo the Malacca coins with them.\n\nThe collection also contains a few Chinese coins, cash, which, however, are too much corroded to be identified.\n\nII. THE EUROPEAN COINS.\n\n1. The Portuguese Coins.\n\nThe European coins found at Malacca are Portuguese, Dutch and English, and, as I stated before, their dates embrace the whole period of the occupation of that place by these three nations.\n\n*Since writing the above I have seen a paper by Lt. Col. Gerini, 'A Malay Coin,' Journal, Royal Asiatic Society, April 1903, pp. 339-343, in which certain small gold coins, found in Jaring, near Patani, are described. Their obverse is 'an imitation of a Southern Indian fanam bearing the figure of a maneless lion,' whilst their reverse bears the inscription \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644, reminding thus strongly of the tin coins described above. Dr. Codrington is of opinion that those gold coins had come from Acheen.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nMalacca was taken by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511 and held by them until 1641. The kings of Portugal during that period were:\n\nEmmanuel, 1495\u20141521  \nJohn III, 1521\u20141557  \nSebastian, 1557\u20141578\n\nand four others to whom it will not be necessary to refer in this paper. From 1641 to 1795 the Dutch held possession of it, from 1795 to 1818 the English, from 1818 to 1824 the Dutch again, and since then the English.\n\nThe coins in the collection which date from the time of the first Dutch occupation are nearly all well known, but it is otherwise with a large number of tin coins struck by the Portuguese in Malacca itself; in fact as I said before, it seems doubtful whether any more of these coins exist at the present day. However, the record of the first mint established by Albuquerque in Malacca, as given in his \"Commentaries,\" and quoted below, leaves no doubt as to their identity.\n\nThis mint was the only one ever established in Malacca by Europeans. This was in 1511, immediately after the conquest of the place. In the previous year, 1510, Albuquerque had conquered Goa, and had established a mint there, and as the circumstances under which those two mints were founded were very similar, and since, as will be shown below, the Malacca coins were struck after the same pattern as those in Goa, although not of the same metals, it may be well first to shortly narrate the history of the founding of the mint in Goa.\n\nSoon after Goa had been taken in 1510 the principal Moors and Hindus of the country went to Albuquerque and told him how the trade of the people suffered because there was no proper currency, begging him to coin some money or at least to permit the coinage of the Cabaio, the former ruler, to pass current, which he had forbidden. Albuquerque thereupon called a meeting of the goldsmiths, some Portuguese experts, and the native merchants, and discussed the matter, after which he gave orders for the coinage of money in gold, silver and copper, and on the one side they were to stamp a cross of the order of Christ, and on the other a sphere,\u2014the device of the King D. Manuel. And when the money was ready (March 12th,\n1510), Albuquerque \"gave the word to take the royal flag, and the trumpets and kettle drums, and assemble all the men in the fleet, and ordered Tristao D\u00e9ga to go and proclaim it; and he went with all this company of people all round the city, and at each proclamation that was made they scattered quantities of the new money over the heads of the crowds, which were great, and they went on proceeding in this manner round the city.\" (Vol. II, p. 131).\n\nWhen a few months afterwards Goa had been retaken by the Moors, and Albuquerque had reconquered it, he established a new mint at Goa (Vol. III, p. 41).\n\nAlbuquerque arrived before Malacca in the middle of June 1511, made the first attack on July 25th, conquered it in August, and then took speedy measures for restoring order in the place, Ninachatu, a rich Hindu merchant, being of the greatest service to him in this matter. Ninachatu and some of the \"Governors of the land\" soon approached Albuquerque and told him what inconvenience the people suffered from the want of a currency, and begged he would give orders for some system of coinage. Albuquerque thereupon called together the merchants, governors, and principal men of the city, and arranged with them that gold, silver, and pewter coins should be struck, substituting thus pewter for the copper coins of Goa and utilizing the natural wealth of tin in the Malay Peninsula. We saw above that the native coinage before the arrival of the Portuguese had been pewter, just as now-a-days coins of that metal are current in Trengganu and Kelantan.\n\nThe gold coin, called Catholico, should weigh a quarter of a tundia which, amongst the Portuguese, was worth a thousand reis. The silver coins, called Malagueses, i.e. Malacca pieces, should have the same value of a quarter tundia. The pewter coins were to be of three different denominations, viz:\n\n1. dinheiro (i.e. money), the smallest coin, equal to two of the previously existing caixes of the ruler of Malacca, bearing the sphere of the King D. Manuel,\n2. soldo, equal to ten dinheiros,\n3. bastardo, equal to ten soldos.\n\nA mint was immediately established, and orders were given that under pain of death the old coinage of the King of Malacca\nshould be delivered there to be reminted. When this had been done, and sufficient money had been coined, Albuquerque fixed a day for the proclamation of the new currency, and the principal men of the people met Albuquerque with the Captains, Fidalgos and Cavaliers of the fleet in the fortress to form a procession through the town. The account given of this procession and proclamation is so interesting and picturesque, that I give it literally:\n\n\"There went first, in front of all the people, one of the principal Governors of the City mounted upon an elephant with his castle caparisoned with silk, and carrying in his hands a flag of the arms of the King of Portugal upon a long spear, and behind him went all the people on foot on one side and the other, as it were in procession; and in the midst of these people there went a Moor mounted upon another elephant, likewise caparisoned with silk, making the proclamation; and behind this one came the trumpets; and after them the Governors of the City, and all the Merchants, and principal men thereof; and at the rear of this throng there went Antonio de Sousa the son of Joao de Sousa of Santarem, and the son of Ninachatu, both together upon a large elephant, which had been kept for the King's own use, with his castle caparisoned with brocaded cloths, and they carried with them a large quantity of gold, silver, and copper * coin, which they kept on throwing out over the heads of all the people at each publication of the proclamation which the Moor made. The crowd was so great that the streets could scarcely contain it, and with many songs and blowing of horns, according to the native custom, the people gave great praise to Afonso Dalboquerque for giving orders for this distribution of money by the advice and in accordance with the opinions of their natives.\" (Vol. III, p. 141). Accounts of this first mint in Malacca are also given by Danvers (5), Vol. I, p. 230, and Stephens (15), p. 162.\n\nBesides these two mints at Goa and Malacca, others were established by the Portuguese in Ceylon, Cochin, Diu, Bassein, Damao and Chaul. The following are the mint marks of six of\n\n* This is probably an error: no copper coins of Malacca are previously mentioned. Probably pewter coins are meant.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903\nthese towns according to Da Cunha (4), part 1, p. 273; part 3 p. 202; part 4, p. 21.\n\nG or G\u2014A ... ... Goa\nM or M\u2014A ... ... Malacca\nC\u2014LO ... ...

Bassein\n\nFinally the letter A which is found on some coins, is supposed to stand for 'Asia' (see Da Cunha, part 1, p. 271), but 'Albuquerque' has also been suggested.\n\nDa Cunha, the first authority on this subject, alludes to the many difficulties which the study of the coins issued by these mints presents, he states that the coins were issued by the viceroys or even by the officers of the mint in the most capricious fashion, that they frequently bore effigies and legends which had no connection whatever with the reigning monarchs of the periods when they were issued, that some of them were struck years after the kings, whose busts they bore, had ceased to live (4, part I, p. 267). Da Cunha continues: \"But these difficulties are increased tenfold by an absolute want of examples of the early periods of the Portuguese rule in India, their place being but inefficiently supplied by some written official reports and private memoirs. The coins of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are not only scarce, but even the written documents relating to them are rare or deficient.\" To Valentyn (16) they seem to have been entirely unknown. Millies (12), p. 140, says: \"Un des monuments m\u00eame de la victoire du grand Alfonso d'Albuquerque, la monnaie qu'il fit frapper \u00e0 Malaka, a tellement disparu, que nous n'avons nullepart pu en d\u00e9couvrir un exemplaire.\" Birch (2), in a foot note to Albuquerque's 'Commentaries,' Vol. II, p. 130, refers for descriptions of the earliest Portuguese coins to the works of De Faria (6) and Fernandes (8) and states that \"the coins themselves are so rare that they may almost be described as no longer extant,\" and that those writers had not figured any of them. I have not been able to see the works of De Faria and Fernandes, but I am glad to say that the collection unearthed in Malacca does contain some of those earliest\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ncoins, in fact some of them may be the identical specimens which Albuquerque threw out over the heads of the admiring crowd during his procession and the proclamation of the new coinage ni Malacca in 1511.\n\nThe oldest specimens are three coins in excellent condition belonging to the reign of King Emmanuel who was reigning when Malacca was captured. Their diameter is 30 mm. = $1\\frac{3}{5}$ in., their weight 10.3 to 10.8 grammes, and they are probably bastardos. They bear on the obverse the Portuguese coat-of-arms, and around it the inscription:\n\n**EWANVEL: R: P: ET: A: DOVINE.**\n\nThe second and fourth letters of the first word are inverted, and the last word, consisting of five or six letters, is less distinct than the rest. It might stand for **DOMINE.** The meaning of the other letters is of course 'Emanuel Rex Portugaliae et Algarbiorum. The Algarves were first conquered by the Portuguese about 1188, and their name is still mentioned on the coins of the present day. The reverse of the coin bears the sphere, the \"device of the King D. Manuel,\" like the coins struck at Goa. The device of the sphere, by the way, is used as a symbol of the glorious world-wide conquests of Portugal (see pl. I, figs. 2 and 2a).\n\nAlbuquerque died off Goa on Dec. 16th 1515, and King Emmanuel in 1521. From the reign of the next king, John III, 1521-1557, between fifty and sixty coins are in the collection. The first kind, probably the Soldo (size 24 mm. = $1\\frac{5}{6}$ in; weight 3.2 to 3.9 grammes), is of a very clear stamp, bearing on the obverse a cross, and around it the inscription\n\n**IOA: III: POR: ET: AL: R.,**\n\ni.e. Ioannes III Portugaliae et Algarbiorum Rex, on the reverse the usual sphere. This tin coin therefore tallies exactly with the description of the gold, silver and copper coins struck at Goa, which bore on the one side \"a cross of the Order of Christ, on the other a sphere\u2014the device of the King D. Manuel.\" Of this coin there are only three specimens (pl. II, figs. 9 and 9a)\n\nAnother kind, of which there are fifteen specimens, resembles this last in all details except that it is of a much ruder make and that the cross is slightly different: thus\nOf a smaller size of this coin, possibly the Dinheiros, there are about forty specimens, some in excellent condition. Size $19\\text{mm} = \\frac{3}{4}\\text{in}$; weight 2 to 2.3 grammes. The obverse bears around the cross the inscription\n\nIOA: III: POR: ET: AL.\n\nThe reverse has the sphere (pl. II, figs. 10 and 10a).\n\nThere are some coins which on the obverse round a coat-of-arms merely bear the inscription.\n\nIOANNES. R. P. ET. AL. D. G.,\ni.e. Ioannes Rex Portugaliae et Algarbiorum Dei Gratia, and on the reverse the sphere. Although not clearly assigned to the reign of John III, still there is no reasonable doubt that they too belong to his time, and not to that of John IV, 1640-1656, during the second year of whose reign Malacca was lost to the Portuguese, nor to the time of John V, 1706-1750. There are about twenty specimens of it, but most of them in a very indifferent condition. Size $24\\text{mm} = \\frac{15}{16}\\text{in}$; weight 6.3 to 6.4 grammes. (pl. II, figs. 8 and 8a).\n\nA smaller coin, of which there are two specimens, has on the obverse a cross, with the letters ISMA in the four angles of the cross, and on the reverse again the sphere. These letters probably stand for 'Ioannes, Malacca,' shewing that the coin was struck at Malacca during the reign of a King Ioannes, probably again John III. The cross is very like the cross on certain coins figured by Da Cunha (part 1, pl. I, figs 3, 4 and 7) from the mints of Goa and Diu and belonging apparently to the eighteenth century. Size $17.5\\text{mm} = \\frac{11}{16}\\text{in}$; weight 3.8 to 3.9 grammes (pl. II, figs. 13 and 13a).\n\nBelonging probably to the reign of the next king, Sebastian, 1557-1578, there are six specimens of a large coin which has on the reverse the two letters S. B. with three crossed arrows between them, and on the reverse the coat-of-arms. The S. probably stands for 'Sebastian', and the letter B. may stand either for\nfor 'Bassein,' one of the mint towns, or for 'Bastardo,' the name of the largest tin coin. The arrows are symbolic of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian after whom the king was called. The size of the coin is 30 mm. = $1\\frac{3}{8}$ in; weight 11.3 to 11.9 grammes (pl. I, figs. 4 and 4a).\n\nAnother coin, which very probably also belongs to this reign, bears on the obverse the letters B and A, with three crossed arrows between them, and on the reverse the sphere. The coin is too small for the letter B to stand for 'Bastardo,' and it is probably the mint mark of Bassein, whilst the letter A may stand either for 'Asia' or 'Albuquerque' (see above p. 190). The three crossed arrows show that the coin was struck during the reign of Sebastian, like the previous coin, and the two dots above them probably indicate its value in dinheiros. Eight specimens were found: size 17 mm. = $1\\frac{1}{8}$ in; weight 3.5 to 3.7 grammes (pl. II, figs. 12 and 12a).\n\nThe coin pictured on pl. I, fig. 1, of which there is only one specimen, was probably struck at Goa, as its obverse bears a device very like the wheel, the symbol of the martyrdom of St. Catherine, the patron saint of Goa. This wheel is often found on coins struck at Goa, as it commemorates the conquest of Goa by the Portuguese on St. Catherine's Day, November 25th, 1510. Its reverse is entirely smooth. Size 27 mm. = $1\\frac{1}{8}$ in.; weight 8.9 grammes.\n\nA small coin, represented by five specimens, shows on the obverse a coat-of-arms, and on the reverse a ship, but no inscription whatever. Size 18 mm. = $\\frac{3}{4}$ in.; weight 2.2 to 2.4 grammes (pl. I, figs 6 and 6a).\n\nA considerably larger coin shews on the obverse the coat-of-arms, and on the reverse the sphere, but has no inscription either. There are five specimens of it. Size 28 mm. = $1\\frac{1}{8}$ in.; weight 10 to 11.2 grammes (pl. I, figs. 3 and 3a).\n\nFinally there is a coin represented by only one specimen shewing on the obverse a small coat-of-arms surrounded by large and deeply impressed Roman letters, and on the reverse the sphere. Notwithstanding that the letters are deeply impressed and only little worn, they are so very rough, that my efforts to decipher them have not been successful. Size 24 mm. = $1\\frac{5}{8}$ in; weight 3.7 grammes (pl. II, fig. 7).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\n2. The Dutch, French and English Coins.\n\nThe Dutch during their possession of Malacca (1641-1795, and 1818-1824) never minted any coins especially for that place, but naturally used the coinage current in Java. That island has changed its rulers several times since the end of the sixteenth century, viz:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1594-1602 &: \\text{ Compagnie van Verre te Amsterdam.} \\\\\n1597-1602 &: \\text{ Compagnie van Verre te Middleburg.} \\\\\n1602-1799 &: \\text{ Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie} \\\\\n1800-1807 &: \\text{ Batavian Republic.} \\\\\n1807-1811 &: \\text{ French Government.} \\\\\n1811-1816 &: \\text{ British Government.} \\\\\n1816 &: \\text{ Dutch Government.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nCoins belonging to four of these epochs were discovered at Malacca.\n\nThe two Companies van Verre seem to have issued silver coins only, but none are in the collection.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company issued gold, silver and copper coins. The first copper coins were minted in 1644, but in the Malacca collection which contains no gold or silver coins, the earliest copper coins date from 1729. From the fact that the earliest copper coin figured by Netscher and Chijs (13) dates from 1726 we may conclude that still earlier ones are rare in numismatic collections.\n\nThe Batavian Republic issued gold, silver and copper coins, but the collection does not contain any. The Raffles Museum, however, possesses a copper coin of that period. The obverse shows the Dutch coat-of-arms consisting of a crowned shield enclosing a lion rampart, with the figures 5 and \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) to the right and left of the shield respectively. The reverse bears the inscription INDIAE BATAV. 1802.\n\nThe French Government issued silver and copper coins, and two of the latter were found at Malacca.\n\nThe British Government issued gold, silver, copper and lead coins during its occupation of Java, but the Malacca collection contained none of them. The Raffles Museum, however, possesses silver Rupees of the years 1812 and 1816, half Rupees of 1813, copper Stuivers of 1814, half Stuivers of all the years\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n1811 to 1815, copper Duits of the years 1811 to 1813 and lead Duits of 1814.\n\nThe Dutch Government of Java has so far issued no gold coins. The first silver coins, Guilders, seem to have been struck in 1821, the first copper coins in 1817 or 1818. The Malacca collection contains four copper coins.\n\nIn addition to coins current in Java also some of the well-known tokens issued by British merchants and traders in Sumatra were found, further some coins struck by the British East India Company for Penang, and finally a coin from India and one from Holland.\n\n(a). Coins of the Dutch East India Company (1602-1799.)\n\nMost of the coins issued by this Company bear the monogram V.O.C., formed of the letters V. O.

Coins identical with it, except for the date, were issued by the Batavian Republic previous to the English occupation of Java, and by the Dutch Government after the English occupation, and the Raffles Museum contains such coins of the years 1802, 1818, 1819, 1821 and 1824. But the Museum also contains a coin of 1815, that is a coin struck in Batavia with the Dutch coat-of-arms during the time of the English rule. Therefore it is just\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\npossible that the above coin of 1816, found at Malacca, may also have been struck under English rule. I cannot offer any explanation of this.\n\nA coin of this kind, but of the year 1802, is figured by Netscher and Chijs, pl. VI, fig. 39. The figures '5' and '1/6' to the right and left of the shield respectively are somewhat mysterious. Netscher and Chijs (p. 108) say that they are not able to offer any explanation of their meaning, nor am I in a position to do so.\n\n(d). Coins of Java under Dutch Rule (from 1816).\n\n1.

A bright westerly wind was blowing at the time and the butterflies flew before it all over the town of Kuching towards Mount Matang in a continuous flood for about 15 minutes whilst stragglers followed up in ever-decreasing numbers for the rest of the day. The colour of the insects, their prodigious numbers and their weak and wavering flight produced an effect that irresistibly reminded the beholder of a heavy shower of falling leaves on a gusty autumn day in England. The swarm or some part of it arrived at Mt. Matang towards evening and streamed up to the summit. At Sadong the same phenomenon was witnessed at the same time on the same day as in Kuching but whether this was a separate swarm or merely one of enormous size sweeping over the whole area between Sadong and Kuching it is impossible to say as I can get no records from intermediate places. On the 13th between 1.30 and 2 p.m. another flighting was noticed in Kuching, but the number were infinitesimal compared to those flying on the 12th, and they did not attract the attention of many observers. Of 18 specimens captured on the 12th, 13 proved on examination to be males, whilst only 5 were females; at the present time of writing\u2014a month after the swarm was observed\u2014this species is quite the most common met with in and around Kuching, but now nearly all the specimens captured are females. The rainfall of the N. E. monsoon months has so far (October\u2014January) been below the average (39.45 inches as\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nagainst the average 75.17 inches) and to this comparative drought perhaps may be indirectly attributed the abnormal numbers of this butterfly\u2014*Cirrochroa bajadeta*. That the monsoon has been an exceptionally favourable one for insects is shewn also by the following occurrences:\u2014(1) The number of swarms of social wasps and bees has been greater than usual during the past 3 months. (2) Captain A. Balser of the s.s. \"Rajah of Sarawak\" reports that on the 20th January ult., a swarm of dragon flies came aboard his ship when about 50 miles west of the island of St. Pierre; the wind was very unsteady at the time; the insects appeared to be making their way North. (3) Mr. H. B. Crocker, officer-in-charge at Paku, Upper Sarawak, informs me that on January 27th ult., he noticed a swarm of some Pierine butterflies (species not identified, probably *Catopsilia crocale*, Cram.) flying in a solid phalanx some 20 fathoms long by 8 fathoms wide in a westerly direction.\n\n*R. Shelford.*\n\n**Work on Sakais by Messrs. Skeat and Blagden.**\n\nIn a letter from Mr. Blagden lately received he states that the important work on the wild tribes of the Malay peninsula by Mr. W. D. Skeat and himself will shortly be out. It is an attempt to combine in one work all that is of any permanent value in previous publications both books and periodicals, as well as Mr. Skeat's own independently collected matter collected during the Cambridge Exploring Expedition, in the Northern States of the Peninsula and in Selangor, Mr. Blagden's own notes, and the various information collected by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey, Hugh Clifford, Vaughan Stevens and others. The book which will be well illustrated will be found to be as complete as it is possible to make it, and should prove of the greatest interest to all Europeans in the Malay peninsula. It is unnecessary to point out that in many cases the language and customs of these most interesting tribes are gradually disappearing so that a good record of them is of the greatest importance, and the names of the authors are a guarantee of the excellence of the work.\n\n*H. N. R.*\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nA Buddhist Votive Tablet.\n\nSome years ago the late Mr. H. Vaughan Stevens discovered in Kedah in a cave, nine feet below the floor, a number of fragmentary clay tablets stamped with inscriptions. These he forwarded to the Singapore Museum, where they now are, accompanying them with a letter explaining where he had found them.\n\nBy the courtesy of the Curator I have been enabled to submit a photograph of the largest and best preserved of these tablets to Professor Kern of Leyden, who in reply to my request was good enough to examine it and writes as follows:\u2014 \"After repeated attempts I have given up the hope of deciphering the whole. The writing is Nagari of the 10th century, approximately, and therefore the tablet is from Northern India. At the top I discern parts of the well known Buddhist formula:\n\nye dharm\u0101 hetu prbha, etc.,\n\nThe first line shows hetuprabha; the second s\u0101m hetu-tath\u0101ga; the third tes\u0101m . . ca (?) yo nirodha; the fourth . . v\u0101di manah sarve; the fifth sams K\u0101ra. Further I can distinguish some letters, but without being able to make out an intelligible context. Most probably the whole tablet is filled up with the common formula of the Buddhist creed.\"\n\nThe formula here referred to is clearly the one which occurs also in certain other inscriptions found in Kedah and Province Wellesley, which will be found in Indo-Chinese Essays, Series I, Vol. 1. These were dealt with, by Professor Kern, in Verslagen en Mededeelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afdeeling Letterkunde, 3de Reeks, Deel 1. He assigns them to the period 400 A.D. These however are in a South Indian form of alphabet (and from such form the existing Far Eastern alphabets are in the main derived), whereas the clay tablet now dealt with points to influences from Northern India.\n\nEvidently, therefore, both Northern and Southern India have contributed something towards the civilization of the Malayan regions.\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nI take this opportunity of pointing out, as regards the date to which this Indian influence can be traced, the following few acts:\n\n(1) In the 2nd century, Ptolemy gives Indian place names to several of the islands of the Archipelago, notably Java, which he calls Iabadios i.e. Yava-dvipa \"the island of Java\" (or the island of millet,\" if that is what the name meant) as well as to certain ports on the coast of Indo-China and the Peninsula.\n\n(2) Early in the 5th century, Fa-Hian going from Ceylon to Java, finds in the latter island \"heretical Brahmins, but no Buddhism worth mentioning.\" He was a Buddhist pilgrim himself and stayed five months in Java and after spending some years in India, so he may be supposed to know what he was talking about.\n\n(3) Late in the 7th century I. Tsing, another Chinese Buddhist, found Buddhism (of the Sanskrit-using variety) flourishing in South-eastern Sumatra.\n\nThe inscriptions found in the Peninsula, though few in number and of little intrinsic interest, supply further links in this chain of evidence, and negative Mr. Hugh Clifford's assertion (Encyclopaedia Britannica supplement s. v. Malays) that the traces of Hindu influence do not extend to the Peninsula. They are only fainter there than in Java and Sumatra, not absent altogether.\n\nUnquestionably Indian influence was by far the most potent of the forces which have led the Javanese and Malays to such civilization as they have attained. It has made a far deeper impression upon them than the Arab and European teaching by which it has been succeeded.\n\nC. O. Blagden.\nA new Balanophora from Tenimber Islands.\n\nWhen Mr. H. O. Forbes visited the Tenimber islands in 1882, he obtained among his collections, specimens of a Balanophora which however perished in the disastrous conflagration by which the greater part of his collections were destroyed. No other person has since visited this group with a view of collecting botanical specimens though Orchid collectors have lately taken to exploring the spot usually for the sake of the beautiful Dendrobium Phalaenopsis. Mr. Micholitz during a recent visit came across the Balanophora, and brought a quantity of it preserved in Formaline which he has kindly given me, and I may here remark that this seems to be about the best way of preserving these fleshy plants. If preserved in ordinary spirit, not only does the spirit become black, though often changed, but the plants which are ordinarily red, yellow or white also become black. The specimens in formaline retain to a considerable extent the yellowish white color which they possessed in life.\n\nB. Micholitzi, n. sp.\n\nRhizome rather small about $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch through, rounded and shortly lobed, minutely irregularly pustulate. Stems two or three on a rhizome, 2 inches tall thick, leaves about 8, orbicular to orbicular ovate, apex rounded $\\frac{1}{2}$ an inch long, $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch wide white. Capitulum ovoid globose 1 inch long yellowish bisexual.\n\nMale flowers in two or three whorls at the base, pedicels $\\frac{1}{6}$ inch long thick. Sepals 4 oblong fleshy, apices thickened incurved, shorter than the pedicel, reflexed, androecium thick, anther-capitulum rounded, anthers 4 horse-shoe shaped. Female portion broad globose rounded. Flowers obconic clavate, apex rounded tessellate, spadicels numerous nearly as long as the pistil, base and apex slender filiform centre swollen.\n\nThis plant is nearly allied to B. Zollingeri Fawcett, Trans. Linn. Soc. Ser. ii. Vol. ii. p. 234. Plate 34 figs 11-14 which was collected by Zollinger in the island Salayer, south of Celebes. It is however much larger in all its parts, and the female flowers are more club shaped with a longer stalk armed with large well developed spadicels.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nOn the supposed evil influence exercised by ghosts in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nSome four years ago when I was engaged in certain prospecting operations in the highlands of Pahang on the borders of that State with Perak, I had occasion to make a somewhat lengthy stay at a place called Kampar on the Tu\u00e9 river, one of the tributaries of the Betok, in its turn a tributary of the Jelai, the principal feeder of the Pahang River. I selected this spot because it had already been cleared of large trees and had only recently been in occupation as a Sakai Settlement, from the remains of which, we reared our unpretentious little camp. The Sakais however strongly advised us to go elsewhere alleging that this place was haunted by elephant ghosts and that they had been the direct cause of a number of deaths among them, principally among their children, whose remains lie buried there. It is necessary to explain that at the back of this place, not fifty yards away, is to be seen one of those peculiar muddy pools which animals of all kinds frequent for their saline properties, this particular one being known as the Kubang Gajah Hantu (the mud pool of the ghostly elephants). These salt licks are also known as genuts in Malay. When the Sakais refer to this place it is usually with bated breath and a mysterious and awesome gesture. These men declared that almost nightly elephants are seen and heard breaking twigs and branches and wallowing in this mud pool, and yet in the morning, not a vestige of their spoor can be seen anywhere. Of this I am certain, the prints of deer and pigs were always plentiful and fresh, but no elephant could have been within miles of the place during my residence in that locality. My mandor\u2019s wife, an oldish person, who always followed her husband in his journeys doing the cooking for my followers, declared that the first night we slept there, she and all my men heard continued long drawn wails, like a long weee\u00ea\u00ea\u00ea which went on without intermission until almost daylight. This noise they said came from those Sakai children buried there.\n\nThis account is interesting from an ethnological standpoint in so far as it illustrates the beliefs and superstitions of a race of very primitive people. As for the number of children dying\nat the time, this would only seem natural when it is remembered that an epidemic of measles was then and had been for some time after raging.\n\nA. D. Machado.\n\nMalay Witchcraft.\n\nTowards the end of 1901 while I was in charge of a country district in Alor Gajah, complaints were made to me of a certain Pawang Musah who was said to bewitch children by means of a familiar spirit called a Polong. One man stated that one of his children had died from the effects and that another was affected. As his house was only about a mile from where I lived, I and the colonial surgeon from Malacca, who happened to be with me on one of his periodical visits decided to go and see the child. When we arrived at the house we found a large number of people in the house and lying at one end of the verandah, the child (a little girl of 7 or 8 years old) in a semi-unconscious state. The doctor examined it and found that it was in a high fever and evidently dying. While we were there the father sat down and spoke to the child. She opened her eyes and when asked by the father \"who sent you here and who is your father\" or words to that effect, she replied \"Pawang Musah.\" This was taken by the bystanders to be the voice of the Polong speaking through the child. We were also told that the child had been asked who would be the next victim and had pointed out her older sister a girl of 18 or 19 years old. This girl was examined by the doctor and found to have nothing the matter with her. We assured her she had nothing to fear, and as far as I know she is still alive, at any rate she was alive in February 1902 when I left Malacca. The dying child was suffering from malarial fever, enlarged spleen and starvation and though we sent up stimulants they were of no avail and she died a very few hours after we left. Pawang Musah lived about 2 miles from where the child lived and had a bad reputation as a wizard. He originally came from the other side of Malacca about 30 miles away and had moved about from village to village everywhere getting the credit for the deaths of child-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 39, 1903.\nren being driven out. I have very little doubt that he traded on the reputation as the people were quite willing to give him anything he asked for through fear that he would otherwise bewitch their children. The explanation appears sufficiently obvious. If any person thought he had in any way offended the Pawang the next case of sickness in his house would in all probability be attributed to him, the illness then being considered supernatural no ordinary remedies would be tried and incantations alone would be used to drive out the evil spirit. The result to the patient is very easy to imagine and as he or she being familiar with the story of the Polong, it is not surprising that the answers given to the well known formulae coincide with the suspicion of the relations especially when it is remembered that the patient is a young boy or girl in high fever.\n\nH.
