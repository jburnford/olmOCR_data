Even at the present time the bulk of the nation seems to remain much as it was four centuries ago.\n\nMy best thanks are due to Professor Margoliouth, of Oxford, and to Mr. C. A.

Salmon.\n\n57 Holland Park,\nLondon, W.11.\n1921.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDURING the years which have elapsed since the translator of the following pages undertook his task the countries which the Sultan Selim I in his Eastern campaigns annexed to the Ottoman Empire have through the fortune of war been withdrawn from it, and Egypt, after four centuries of dependence, has again become the seat of a Sultanate. These extraordinary events, which were not anticipated when the work was begun, lend a special interest to a detailed and contemporary account of the victory which brought Egypt with its dependencies under Ottoman rule.\n\nThe story was told by von Hammer in his Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches\u00b9 mainly after Turkish and European authorities, and by G. Weil, in his Geschichte der Chalifen,\u00b2 after Ibn Iy\u0101s and another contemporary Arabic account. Zinkeisen in his admirable Ottoman history followed von Hammer, and Sir W. Muir, in his Mameluke or Slave Dynasty of Egypt, was dependent on Weil. The very brief account in the latest Ottoman history on a large scale\u00b3 rests apparently on the statements of European witnesses.\n\nThe work of Ibn Iy\u0101s which Weil used in MS. was published in three volumes at the Government Press, Boula\u1e33, A.H. 1311\u20131312 (1893\u20131895). It is called Bada\u02bei\u02bf al-zuh\u016br f\u012b waq\u0101\u02bei\u02bf al-duh\u016br, and is one of four works by the same author; all of which are preserved.\u2074 No biography of its author appears to have been discovered, but a little can be gleaned from his writings about his family and his career.\u2075 He informs us that he was born on Saturday 6 Rabi\u02beii, 852 (June 8, 1448),\u2076 so\n\n\u00b9 Vol. ii, book xxiv, Pest, 1828.\n\u00b2 Vol. v, chs. xxi, xxii, Stuttgart, 1862.\n\u00b3 N.

His great-grandfather, the Am\u012br Izdomir \u2018Umar\u012b N\u0101\u1e63\u012br\u012b, known as the Kh\u0101zind\u0101r, after having been Am\u012br Sil\u0101\u1e25, was made by the Sultan Sha\u2018b\u0101n viceroy of Tripoli.\\(^1\\) Presently he was transferred to \u1e24alab, and in 768 recalled and again made Am\u012br Sil\u0101\u1e25.\\(^2\\) He was imprisoned for a time during an \u00e9meute in Cairo, but was released and appointed governor of Damascus, but died before he could start in 771.\\(^3\\) This person had originally been a slave, and sold by the same merchant as the Am\u012br Shaikho, whom he succeeded as Am\u012br Sil\u0101\u1e25 in 757. Of his nisbahs N\u0101\u1e63\u012br\u012b is likely to refer to the Sultan of that name, and Saifi to his son the Sultan Saif al-d\u012bn; he was then a Circassian slave, purchased by the first of these sovereigns and manumitted by the second. Ibn Iy\u0101s appears to say nothing of his father or grandfather, but mentions that his sister was married to one Kurkm\u0101s, an Amir \u0100kh\u016br of the fourth class, who was called \u2018Al\u0101\u2019i, and died in battle in the year 877.\\(^3\\) He names among his shaikhs the famous polygraph, Jal\u0101l al-d\u012bn Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b, for whom he appears to have felt no great respect,\\(^4\\) and \u2018Abd al-B\u0101sit b. Khal\u012bl the \u1e24anefite, whose history (preserved in MS.) he cites.\\(^5\\) He himself belonged to the same legal school, and had the honourable title Zaini al-d\u012bn or Shih\u0101b al-d\u012bn.\n\nThe Chronicle terminates at the end of 928, and its composition seems to have occupied a number of years. Thus a passage in II, 109, where it is stated that A\u1e25mad b. Ab\u012b Sa\u2018id is still on the Timurid throne, must have been written not later than 899, when the reign of that prince terminated,\\(^6\\) and one of the existing MSS. bears a colophon, wherein the author asserts that the volume was finished on 15 Mu\u1e25arram\n\n\\(^1\\) i, 213, A.H. 764.

For the period for which he is a contemporary authority, his work consists in the main of a court circular, recording the doings of the sovereign and the decorations which he confers; in this it resembles some of the chronicles of the Moghul Emperors. Into this framework various memorabilia are introduced, chiefly obituaries of distinguished men, but also public calamities, the movements of the market, and causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres; to this last category belongs the discussion of the orthodoxy of the poet Ibn al-F\u0101rid, which occupies much space. At times contemporary verses, serious or satirical, are inserted. The composition of the court-circular must have been the business of some official, as also the preservation of the notices; it is possible that Ibn Iy\u0101s himself was employed by the government to discharge these duties, and this is rendered likely by the fact that he frequently cites his own poems, some of them encomia on men in power, which are likely to have been composed in some official capacity.\n\nThere is one feature about his history which counts as a defect with Oriental critics, but as a merit among Western scholars; it is that it is written in a language which embodies much of the vernacular of the time, and in consequence is of value for the history of the Arabic language and the development of the Cairene dialect. Some of the expressions into which the author drops are still characteristic of the patois of Cairo; many phrases not as yet registered in any dictionary appear to be characteristic of the time. Some help for the understanding of such of them as are political technicalities is afforded by the two works on the Maml\u016bk state which have been published, but these leave much unexplained.\n\nThe suddenness wherewith the great Egyptian Sultanate collapsed before the Ottoman arms is the most impressive feature in the following narrative, and the explanation of it\n\n---\n\n1 Weil, l.c., V, vi.\n2 See Gurgi Zaid\u0101n's Ta'rikh \u0100d\u0101b al-lughah al-'Arabiyyah, iii, 298.\nis perhaps to be found in the general course of Egyptian and Ottoman history rather than in the events which Ibn Iy\u0101s here records. The Maml\u016bk system produced a considerable number of eminent rulers, and, indeed, the mode of appointment was one calculated to bring talented men to the front. Still their rule was foreign military occupation, which was backed by no popular enthusiasm or loyalty. Ability to speak the Arabic language appears to have been exceptional in the case of these Sultans, whence the substitution of an Ottoman Pasha only affected the bulk of the people in so far as Cairo became the capital of a province instead of the metropolis of an empire. In order to resist the Ottoman conqueror the Egyptian Sultanate required able officers and trustworthy troops. It so happened that it had neither.\n\nThe defeat of Marj D\u0101bak is ascribed to the ill-feeling between the two sets of Maml\u016bks, the \u1e32ar\u0101n\u012b\u1e63ah and the Jilb\u0101n, of whom the Sultan was supposed to favour the latter. Such jealousies between army corps are familiar in Muslim history; but what was the character of these bodies? It would seem that the definition of the \u1e33ar\u0101n\u012b\u1e63 offered by Khal\u012bl al-\u1e92\u0101hir\u012b is of little use for this question;\u00b9 he says: \"The \u1e33ar\u0101n\u012b\u1e63 troops are those who migrated at an early period, and are attached to the Holy Bureau, possessors of ample stipends, designed for commissions, equal to commanders of fives;\u00b2 their number was originally 100, but in our time is smaller. They are called Ouloughlar.\" Von Hammer\u00b3 infers from the texts that they were the lowest class of mercenary; for the accession-money which they received was on a certain occasion 30 ducats, whereas the Jilb\u0101n received 50 and the Maml\u016bks 100. The name perhaps occurs first in the Chronicle of Tangri-Bardi,\u2074 where it is stated that in the year 802 the army divided into two parties, one\n\n\u00b9 Zubdat Kashf al-Mam\u0101lik, ed. Ravaisse, p. 115.\n\u00b2 This meant that each had a small court of five Maml\u016bks. See van Berchem, Corpus Inscriptionum, p. 543 n.\n\u00b3 l.c., ii, 470 n.\n\u2074 Ed. Popper, vi, 15, 7.\nsiding with the Amir Itmish Bajasi, these being all the greatest Amirs and the Karanish Mamluks, another with the Amir Yashbak, these being the Amirs of the Khassikiyyah and the Mamluks of the Atbakh. In Ibn Iyas's Chronicle it is assumed that the reader knows the sense of this name, and all that we can learn is that it is in antithesis to Jilban. In 897, after a plague which had carried off great numbers, the Sultan Kaietbai gave every one of his army, whether Karanishah or Jilban, a horse that had belonged to one of the deceased.\u00b9 In 865 the Sultan Almad b. Inail on the occasion of a Bedouin raid despatched against them a force wherein he sent none of the Jilban Mamluks; this greatly offended the Karanishah, and they harboured mischief in consequence.\u00b2 Now the form Jilban (for which Ajlab is occasionally substituted)\u00b3 appears to be connected with the verb jalaba in the sense of importing a slave from a foreign country, which is often used by Ibn Iyas in explaining the origin of a Mamluk Sultan;\u2074 the subject of the verb being in such cases the dealer. The Jilban are at times called the Jilban of a particular Sultan;\u2075 whence it would seem that Khalil is right in defining the Karanishah as early immigrants, though he seems to be wrong for the period with which we are dealing in the matter of their numbers and distinction. The etymology of the word is far from clear; kurnaz in Turkish is a familiar word for \"sly\", \"cunning\", and might serve to describe \"an old campaigner\". The practice of differentiating between different classes of troops in the matter of accession-money is said to have been introduced by the Sultan Inail in 857,\u2076 who is charged by the historian with meanness in this innovation; it is strange that the veterans should receive less than the new arrivals. In any case we must reject von Hammer's division of the Egyptian army into Mamluks, Jilban, who were in the main Abyssinian slaves, and Karanishah, the lowest class of mercenaries. According to\n\n\u00b9 ii, 277. \u00b2 Ibid. 68, end. \u00b3 Ibid. 77, l. 3.\n\u2074 ii, 15, 24, 39; cf. infra, p. 64. \u2075 ii, 67. \u2076 ii, 41.\nour authorities, the name Maml\u016bk was common to all; and if there was any superiority it lay with the \u1e32ar\u0101n\u012b\u1e63ah. In the narrative of Ibn Iy\u0101s it is the Jilb\u0101n who are constantly rioting and giving trouble.\n\nOf one other division of the army, mentioned in this extract, Ibn Iy\u0101s has given a definition. This is the *aul\u0101d al-n\u0101s*, whom he identifies with the *\u1e25al\u1e33ah*.\u00b9 Some account of the *\u1e25al\u1e33ah* is given in the *Zubdat Kashf al-Mam\u0101lik*,\u00b2 where their numbers are stated to have been originally 24,000, chiefly employed in garrison duty. It seems likely that their name *The children of the Men* signifies that they were descendants of Maml\u016bks; and the interest which Ibn Iy\u0101s displays in their welfare indicates that he was connected with such a family. He thanks God on one occasion that their fiefs were restored to them after they had been taken away.\u00b3 The Sultans seems to have been frequently tempted to disband them; the Sultan \u1e32aietbai adopted with them the plan by which Penelope meant to get rid of her suitors; a heavy bow with a corresponding arrow was brought and all who were unable to draw it were dismissed.\u2074\n\nThe death of a Circassian sovereign was regularly followed by disorders, as there was no hereditary loyalty, and the provincial governors regarded such an event as an opportunity for the assumption of at least independence. The new Sultan had to meet the demand for accession-money, frequently from an empty treasury. Hence the death of the Sultan Gh\u016br\u012b on the field after a defeat by the mighty Sel\u012bm was more fatal to the Maml\u016bk Empire than such a disaster would have been to the Ottomans or any other government which had a nation behind it.\n\nFor the topography of Cairo, to which there are many allusions in this extract, reference should be made to the admirable works of Casanova and Van Berchem, which leave little unexplained. The Commentary of the latter on his\n\n\u00b9 i, 295. \u00b2 p. 116. \u00b3 ii, 47. \u2074 ii, 101.\nCorpus Inscriptionum explains with great skill and learning most of the technicalities of the Maml\u016bk court.\\(^1\\) M. Blochet in the preface to his translation of Makr\u012bz\u012b\\(^2\\) has drawn up a list of 134 works, mostly unpublished, which deal with the history of the Moslem Egypt and its dependencies; it is to be hoped that the Egyptian Government, which has rendered many valuable texts accessible, may arrange for the publication of many more of those histories of the Maml\u016bk period which now lie scattered in various libraries, public and private.\n\nD.

The Khal\u012bfah at that time was the Am\u012br of the Faithful, al-Mutwekkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammed Ibn Am\u012br al-Mu\u2019min\u012bn al-Mustemsik B\u2019ill\u0101h Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u2014may his honour be extolled! The Sult\u0101n of Egypt was al-Malik al-Ashraf Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r K\u0101n\u1e63\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u00b9\u2014may his victories be glorified.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNews was received in A.H. 922 of hostilities between Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b, ruler of the two \u2018Ir\u0101ks, and Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, Sult\u0101n of Constantinople. The fighting had apparently been begun in 920 by Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b\u2019s invading the territory of Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h. When the news reached the Sult\u0101n of Egypt, al-Gh\u016br\u012b, he deemed it necessary to send an expedition to Aleppo and to accompany it himself, with the intention of remaining there to watch the results of the war between Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b\u00b2 and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, for he was of opinion that whichever of the two came off victorious would forthwith invade his Egyptian dominions.\n\n[19] On Wednesday and Thursday, the 20th and 21st of the first spring month, the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b issued pay to the rest of the troops, and on Saturday, 23rd, the Sult\u0101n paid all the Kar\u0101ni\u1e63ah\u00b3 and imported Memlooks, and announced to them in his private grounds that the expedition would leave on the 1st of the following month. This caused some confusion amongst the troops, and generally throughout Cairo. Horses and mules became scarce, the Memlooks took to raiding the mills, taking away their horses and mules and\n\n\u00b9 In accordance with the practice of many Orientalists, I have spelt the Memlook Sult\u0101n\u2019s name \u201cK\u0101n\u1e63\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u201d. It is, however, noteworthy that\u2014as I have learnt since completing the translation\u2014on the page of a contemporary Ko\u2018r\u0101n written for the Sult\u0101n himself and reproduced on plate 83 of Moritz\u2019s Arabic Palaeography, the name is clearly written \u201cK\u0101n\u1e63auh al-Gha\u016br\u012b\u201d.\n\n\u00b2 More commonly known as \u201cThe \u1e62afaw\u012b\u201d, i.e. descended from \u1e62af\u012b al-D\u012bn.\n\n\u00b3 Vide Zubdat Keshf al-Mem\u0101lik (Ravaisse), p. 115.\nold jades, in consequence of which all the mills closed down. No bread or flour was obtainable in the markets, the people were famishing and much distressed, and offered up many prayers. The cloth markets also closed on account of the Memlooks. The artisans and tailors concealed themselves, and Cairo was given up to general confusion. Numbers of merchants hid themselves for fear of the Memlooks, and many slaves also, for fear of being compelled to go on the expedition. It might have been the Day of Judgment in Egypt\u2014every man was exclaiming: \"O Lord! save my soul!\"\n\nThe troops blamed the Sult\u0101n for all this excitement. He did not act as other Sult\u0101ns had done when they went on expeditions, and in spite of it all there was nothing to justify this great fuss and commotion. News had not come that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n or his advanced troops had reached Aleppo, neither had he invaded the Sult\u0101n\u2019s territory. They also blamed the Sult\u0101n for inspecting and paying the whole of the troops in four days; for they were afraid that this would be reported in the dominions of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n and al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b, and that the troops would be deemed numerically insignificant in consequence. They complained that there was no army in Egypt, and that the covetousness of the enemy would be excited when they heard this. But this was not correct, and it all showed a bad state of affairs.\n\nOn the Saturday previously mentioned the Sult\u0101n sent the chief Am\u012brs their pay. He sent 5,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs to At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn al-\u2018Ajem\u012b, 4,000 each to Am\u012br Arkm\u0101s, Am\u012br Mejlis, Am\u012br S\u016bd\u016bn al-Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u012b, chief of the guards, and to Am\u012br Anas Bai, chief chamberlain; and 3,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs to each of the [20] chief Am\u012brs not holding special appointments\u2014but what was this compared to what al-Ashraf K\u0101it Bai used to send to the chief Am\u012brs when they went on expeditions against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. To At\u0101bek Ezbek alone he had sent 30,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, and to Am\u012br Temr\u0101z, Am\u012br Sil\u0101\u1e25\u012b 1 20,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, and to the Am\u012br Mejlis a similar sum; as well as 10,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs\n\n1 \u201cLe chef des officiers qui portaient les pi\u00e8ces de l\u2019armure destin\u00e9e au Sultan, et qui les lui pr\u00e9sentaient lorsqu\u2019il en avait besoin\u201d (Dozy).\napiece to all the other chief Am\u012brs, which was considered extraordinarily unusual. Al-Ashraf K\u0101it Bai did this only in his last expedition against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n in the year A.H. 895. The total allowances of the Am\u012brs, exclusive of the troops, amounted to 100,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs.\n\nOn the first day of the week, and the 24th day of the month, the Sult\u0101n came down and went out to his college at Sharabishiyin, where he remained until the afternoon, and it was reported that he had inspected the storehouses of the Queen-mother, whose possessions were there, and he found that she had much property, including a large amount of gold and silver specie, precious stones, costly clothing, and other things.\n\nOn Monday, the 25th, the Sult\u0101n issued advances to the Am\u012brs of \u1e6cablkh\u0101nah,\u00b9 and to the Am\u012brs of Tens, summoning each one separately, as if he had been paying wages. He gave to each Am\u012br of the former 500 d\u012bn\u0101rs and to each of the latter 200 d\u012bn\u0101rs; but did not make any allowance to the Khal\u012bfah, which was a source of much inconvenience to the latter, who entreated some of the Am\u012brs to lend him sums of money on usury, and ran heavily into debt in consequence. The Khal\u012bfah had never before accompanied the Sult\u0101n on an expedition to Syria without an allowance. His baggage and equipment on expeditions had usually been borne by the Sult\u0101n, who allowed him 500 d\u012bn\u0101rs as wages for his followers; but this Sult\u0101n paid no attention to anything of this kind, and was stingy towards him in the matter of allowances, so that the Khal\u012bfah was hardly dealt with.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n then inspected the Kar\u0101nisah Memlooks, the old men and invalids, detailing some of them to his Shark\u012beh\n\n\u00b9 \u201cDes tambours qui, joints \u00e0 des trompettes et \u00e0 d\u2019autres instruments, se faisaient entendre \u00e0 plusieurs moments du jour \u00e0 la porte des souverains et des personnages \u00e9lev\u00e9s en dignit\u00e9. Plusieurs \u00e9mirs jouissaient de cette pr\u00e9rogative, et pour cette raison, chacun d\u2019eux prenait le titre de Am\u012br \u1e6cablkh\u0101nah. Ils avaient sous leur commandement quarante ou quatre-vingts cavaliers, et le mot en question a re\u00e7u le sens de grade d\u2019\u00e9mir de quarante hommes\u201d (Dozy).\nand Gharb\u012beh provinces and to Upper Egypt, and compelling them to go without allowances. They amounted to about 500 Memlooks.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 26th, the Sult\u0101n came down from the citadel and went to Raid\u0101niyyeh, and showed the Farr\u0101shes [sweepers] how to set up the royal tent during the expedition. He also arranged for the quarters of the Am\u012brs at Raid\u0101niyyeh. On the same day the Sult\u0101n instructed his son, the Grand Master of the Horse, to make his preparations to start with him. At first the Sult\u0101n commanded him to await his arrival at B\u0101b al-Silsilah; then he countermanded this and commanded him to get his baggage ready for the expedition.\n\nOn Friday, the 29th, corresponding to the 6th of the Coptic month Beshans, the Sult\u0101n took off his woollen garments and changed into white linen clothing. This was the first Friday since the death of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s wife. He arranged a splendid feast in her honour, at which the Khal\u012bfah, the four judges, a number of the chief Am\u012brs, and all the readers of the town and the preachers were present. There were many people present on that night at the Sult\u0101n\u2019s college at Shar\u0101bishiyy\u012bn.\n\nOn Saturday, the 1st of the month Rebi\u2018 al-\u0100khir, the Sult\u0101n sat in the Maid\u0101n; the Khal\u012bfah and the four judges came to offer congratulations on the new month, and then returned to their homes. The same day the Sult\u0101n appointed [21] the son of the late Miht\u0101r \u1e24asan, the Master of the Cellar (of whose death mention has been made), to his father\u2019s office. On the 2nd he distributed to the imported Memlooks sets of coloured silk horse clothing, helmets, shields, and sets of bridles, steel stirrups, weapons, etc., from the armory. The Memlooks crowded round him and began helping themselves to the fine clothing, and were not satisfied with what the Sult\u0101n distributed; he failed to pacify them that day, and at that time they became extremely insolent.\n\nA Wonder.\u2014It was said that a woman gave birth to a boy with two heads, four arms, and four legs; the Sult\u0101n was amazed when he saw it. It was said that a similar portent had appeared in the time of the Im\u0101m \u2018Al\u012b.\nAmongst the favours of Providence to the Faithful was the cancelling of his order by the Sult\u0101n for the departure of the Arabs, whom he had allotted to the Sharkieh and Gharbieh provinces and to Upper Egypt. As before mentioned the Sult\u0101n had decided to take with him on the expedition a body of Arab cavalry to move in front of the troops in war. So he summoned the Arab Sheikhs and the overseers and instructed them to provide 500 mounted men, or according to some 5,000.\n\nThey went all over the country imposing on each small village the maintenance of two horsemen at 100 d\u012bn\u0101rs, and four on the larger villages at 200 d\u012bn\u0101rs. When the Fell\u0101\u1e25\u012bn of the districts heard of this they left their villages and their crops and fled, so some of the villages became desolate in this movement.\n\nWhen the Am\u012brs heard of this they went to the Sult\u0101n and complained to him about this, and said: \u201cWe are setting out with you, and our villages are destroyed; whence shall we get food and give pay to our followers?\u201d The Sult\u0101n was put to shame by them, and ordered these doings to be stopped. He issued imperial edicts to the overseers and Sheikhs of the Arabs cancelling previous orders, and telling them to return what had been taken from the Fell\u0101\u1e25\u012bn. The imperial edicts reached the villages, and but for them the whole of Egypt would have been devastated and overtaken by famine. God be praised for this deliverance!\n\nAmong the events of this time was the exaction of money by the Sult\u0101n from the daughter of Am\u012br Kh\u0101ir Bey, Inspector of the Gharbieh Province. She was the wife of Am\u012br T\u0101n\u012b Bey, the treasurer and one of the chief Am\u012brs, and was the person implicated in the degrading affair before mentioned. When the Sult\u0101n made a claim against her for a large sum of money, he sent a number of eunuchs to demand this money. Upon which she set to work to sell her dowry and all her stock and other property. On the death of her father, Am\u012br Kh\u0101ir Bey, some enemies had accused her of taking property of his,\nconsisting of three jars containing a large sum of money. The Sult\u0101n sent for her, and on her coming into his presence questioned her about the matter. She denied it all, and swore that she had never even seen these jars of gold which they accused her of taking. The Sult\u0101n became angry with her, and said: \"Have you forgotten your crime about the child which they found with you?\" He swore that unless she produced her father's property which she had taken he would drown her, and he meant to do it. She then set about selling her dowry to pay the money demanded of her. On every [22] Saturday and Tuesday Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 and a number of officials used to come and sell her clothing, just as they would the effects of a deceased person.\n\nAn exactly similar thing had happened to the daughter of Yashbek the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, the wife of Am\u012br K\u0101n Bai, Grand Master of the Horse; she had money exacted from her, and sold her dowry, her clothes, and her slaves like the property of a deceased person, until she had paid all the money demanded from her.\n\nOn Thursday, the 6th, the Sult\u0101n issued money in lieu of three months' rations to the expeditionary soldiers, in order that they might amply provide themselves. He gave nothing to those remaining behind in Egypt, but left it to the cooks to provide for them in his absence. On that day the Sult\u0101n sent his tents out to Raid\u0101niyyeh, and his expedition to Syria became a certainty. He announced to the troops in the Maid\u0101n that every man who was ready, and had nothing further to detain him, should start before the Sult\u0101n. Until then the Sult\u0101n had not hoisted the standard which went in front of the army when they took the field for Syria.\n\nThe flag used to be hoisted forty days before departure, but the Sult\u0101n did not follow in the steps of former kings. On this Thursday the Sult\u0101n sent 1,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs for the expenses of the expedition to the Am\u012br of the Faithful, Mu\u1e25ammed al-Mutewekkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h, by the hand of \u1e24us\u0101m al-D\u012bn al-Alw\u0101h\u012b, gatekeeper of Dahishah. This was\ndone at the instigation of Amir T\u016bm\u0101n Bai, Grand Daw\u0101d\u0101r; had it not been for the latter nothing would have been sent him.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n also sent to the four judges to tell them to make ready, but sent them no allowances, a source of much annoyance and inconvenience to them; for since al-Ashraf Bars Bai\u2019s expedition to \u0100med in A.H. 836 neither the Khal\u012bfah nor the four judges had accompanied the Sult\u0101n to Syria. But when they did go, it had been the custom to provide them with their expenses. The Sult\u0101n did not do it on this occasion.\n\nA few days later the Sult\u0101n sent the Khal\u012bfah a sword inlaid with gold, by one of the officials of the armory\u2014Mu\u1e25ammed al-\u2018\u0100dil\u012b. It has already been mentioned that he sent him a set of new glass. The total amount he had received from the Sult\u0101n in gifts of gold and other valuables amounted to less than 2,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, and the Khal\u012bfah\u2019s preparations for this expedition cost him 5,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs or more.\n\nOn Friday, the 7th, a large body of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s Memlooks started for Syria, according to orders previously given. A number of troops left barracks but did not start. On that day the successor of S\u012bd\u012b Al\u1e25med al-Badaw\u012b appeared before the Sult\u0101n in answer to a summons, who told him to prepare to leave with him for Aleppo. He made excuses that he was in a feeble state of health and was unable to start. This vexed the Sult\u0101n, who insisted and would accept of no excuse. He also sent to tell the successor of S\u012bd\u012b Al\u1e25med al-Rif\u0101\u2018\u012b, may the blessing of God be upon him, to accompany\n\n---\n\n1. \u201cSous la dynastie des Mamlouks on donnait ce titre \u00e0 des personnages qui avaient la fonction de faire arriver \u00e0 leur destination les lettres \u00e9man\u00e9es du Sultan, de lui faire parvenir les placets, et d\u2019introduire les ambassadeurs et autres personnes aux audiences\u201d (Dozy).\n\n\u201cBesides the Grand Daw\u0101d\u0101r [the Amir Daw\u0101d\u0101r al-kab\u012br] there was also a second Daw\u0101d\u0101r with the rank of an Amir of 40 Maml\u016bks, a third with the rank of an Amir of 20 Maml\u016bks, and 10 Daw\u0101d\u0101rs among the bodyguard (kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63\u012bk\u012b) in Cairo and in each province. A Daw\u0101d\u0101r Sikk\u012bn also is frequently mentioned; according to Ibn Iy\u0101s\u2019s account, his office was to conduct the correspondence between the Sult\u0101n and his Maml\u016bks...\u201d (M. Sobernheim).\nhim. Then when the judges felt sure that the Sult\u0101n was going they set about getting ready, and detailed a large number of deputy judges to accompany them, much to the vexation of the latter. Moreover, the four judges imposed [23] a certain sum of money on each of the deputies, fixed according to each man\u2019s station, which raised a fire of indignation against the judges. The Sult\u0101n also condemned their conduct when he heard of it.\n\nOn this day the chief judge of the Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b sect, Kem\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6caw\u012bl, led the people in the Friday prayers; then he asked for and obtained an audience of the Sult\u0101n, who was then at Dah\u012bshah. At this audience he swore that he had not appropriated any of the money levied on the deputies, but that those of the deputies who had been detailed for the expedition had said: \u201cLet us charge our expenses on the deputies remaining in Egypt.\u201d To this the Sult\u0101n replied: \u201cDo not annoy any of the deputies, nor take them by force, but those who are prepared to go of their own free will, let them go, but use no compulsion.\u201d Thus was this odious conduct put a stop to, for which\u2014Praise be to God. A number of deputies had already set about selling their furniture and books, and had incurred losses in consequence of the demand for money.\n\nThe like of this did not happen to the judges and their deputies when al-Ashraf Bars Bai set out for \u0100med.\n\nOn the same date the Sult\u0101n inspected the household slaves, the Farr\u0101shes, the gatekeepers, the stablemen, the stonemasons, the cellarmen, the armourers, the firemen, and others. He summoned Am\u012br \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn, who had charge of those who played the drums and fifes, and required him to spend his own money on the men going with him. The Sult\u0101n said: \u201cYou have been living on the proceeds of this office for a number of years, so pay for these men out of your own pocket, otherwise we have some one to succeed you who will do so.\u201d Then he paraded the \u201csingers of the bench (?)\u201d, namely, Al\u012bmed Ab\u016b Sena, al-Mu\u1e25aujib, and al-Ma\u1e25l\u0101w\u012b,\nand ordered them to start with him. He detailed a number of carpenters and stonemasons, inspected them, and issued four months' wages only, without any allowance for rations, saying: \"You have been living on State wages for so many years, and when it is my will that you should go on an expedition you ask me for ration allowances.\"\n\nMeantime, Shems al-D\u012bn al-Zar\u012bf, registrar of the Kor\u0101n readers, selected a number of readers, preachers, and mu'ezzins, and ordered them to proceed with the Sult\u0101n, as the judges had done with their deputies.\n\nOn Sunday, the 9th, 'Ajemi al-Shenkj\u012b, the Sult\u0101n's messmate, who had been with elephants to the Governors of Damascus and Aleppo, arrived at the Palace gates; he had been away such a long time that he had been reported dead more than once. It seemed that the Sult\u0101n had sent him on a secret mission to Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101'il al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b; at least, this was the common talk.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 10th of Rebi\u2018 al-\u0100khir, the Sult\u0101n's military cort\u00e8ge\u00b9 was ordered to set out from the Maid\u0101n before sunrise, and followed the route from the Rumailah by \u1e24adarat al-Ba\u1e33ar and the \u1e62alibah.\n\nIt consisted of fifteen led dromedaries with gold-embroidered numnahs; three hundred horses, of which [24] a hundred had caparisons of steel chased with gold; and some (of the horses) with velvet of different colours; three horses with gold-embroidered numnahs and saddles inlaid with gold; and three pairs of horses with Bedouin saddles and drums. There were also in the cavalcade twenty-four litters with glossy yellow silk coverings, and two velvet litters on mules also with yellow silk coverings, six treasure cases with\n\n\u00b9 \"Tulb, pl. Atl\u0101b, est, selon Macrizi, un mot qui dans la langue des Curdes d\u00e9signe un \u00e9mir commandant qui a un drapeau roul\u00e9 et une trompette que l'on sonne au besoin; il a sous ses ordres un nombre de deux cents, cent ou soixante et dix cavaliers. Introduit en \u00c9gypte et dans la Syrie sous le r\u00e8gne de Saladin et de ses successeurs, ce terme y a re\u00e7u le sens de corps de troupes plus ou moins nombreux, command\u00e9 par un officier sup\u00e9rieur, bataillon\" (Dozy).\nthe same hangings; five well-bred horses, two of which carried horse-cloths, gilt stirrups, saddles of crystal and gold mosaic, and drums of crystal and gold; two mares with gold-embroidered horse-cloths, gilt bits, and saddles, the latter with gold hangings ornamented with gold crescents instead of birds.\n\nRiding with the procession were a certain number of Am\u012brs of Tens wearing muslin turbans, and some eunuch servants, also riding. There were a number of officials, including the K\u0101d\u012b Mahm\u016bd Ibn Aj\u0101, Private Secretary; the K\u0101d\u012b Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn al-Ka\u1e63r\u0101w\u012b, Inspector of Troops; the K\u0101d\u012b \u2018Al\u0101 al-D\u012bn Ibn al-Im\u0101m \u201cN\u0101\u1e93ir al-Kh\u0101\u1e63\u201d; the K\u0101d\u012b Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Al\u012bmed Ibn al-J\u012b\u2018\u0101n, Private Secretary; and the K\u0101d\u012b Ab\u016b al-Bak\u0101, Inspector of Stables; the K\u0101d\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, Inspector of Markets; the K\u0101d\u012b Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e62aghir, Secretary of the Memlooks and Government Inspector; and al-Sheref\u012b Y\u016bnus al-N\u0101bulus\u012b, and the K\u0101d\u012b Ker\u012bm al-D\u012bn Ibn al-J\u012b\u2018\u0101n, the princes, and other leading officials. Then came the Royal Standard, the cymbals, and the Sult\u0101n\u2019s and Khalifah\u2019s standards; there were in the procession four drums and four fifes and ten loads of treasure cases\u2014there were usually forty loads.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n\u2019s procession went out by the Rumailah Gate, the troops were drawn up, and a vast concourse of people to see it. But when the procession passed the people were not pleased; they thought there were not enough horses, and one who had seen the procession of al-Ashraf Bars Bai when he went to \u0100med said that he had 400 gorgeously caparisoned horses with horse-armour, coloured velvet, and steel. Some preferred the procession of Yashbek, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r (when he went against Sh\u0101h Suw\u0101r), to that of the Sult\u0101n, giving preference to the former. It went down by the Viz\u012br\u2019s Gate, and came in through the Zaw\u012blah Gate, and went right through Cairo; it was observed as a high day, and all Cairo was in excitement over it.\n\nThe procession wound along till it emerged at the\nB\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r, and went on to the royal camp at Raid\u0101niyyeh. On that day the baggage of Am\u012br al-Mu\u02bemin\u012bn al-Mutewekkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h left, having in front of him two drums and fifes and a trumpeter. Nothing started on that day but the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s procession. It was customary of old for the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n to follow in the rear of the procession, followed again by troops commanded by the Am\u012brs; but he departed from the customs of former kings in many respects. For instance, he did not hoist the standard over the band quarters as did former kings. They used to hoist the standard, parade the troops, and then make a distribution of money for the expedition; the standard used to fly until the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n departed, even if it were after an interval of two months.\n\nIt was related of al-Z\u0101hir Ber\u1e33\u016b\u1e33 that when he went out against T\u012bm\u016brlenk, his procession left by the Maid\u0101n Gate, and that he himself arranged the order of it.\n\nThe Sul\u1e6d\u0101n was mounted carrying an axe in his hand, [25] and rode backwards and forwards from the Maid\u0101n Gate to al-\u1e62uwwah. It was said that former Sul\u1e6d\u0101ns departed for Syria when the sun was in the sign of Aries, in early spring, during the moist season. But al-Gh\u016bri left when the heat was extreme and the sun in the sign of Cancer. So the troops suffered great hardships on the journey. Neither was it the ancient custom that the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n should traverse Cairo on his way out, but that he should go out by \u1e62uwwah and traverse Cairo on his return\u2014but this Sul\u1e6d\u0101n took his own line in everything.\n\nOn Thursday, the 13th, it was the common talk that one of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s imported Memlooks named J\u0101neu al-Ifranji (the European), a rapacious spendthrift (who left with the first detachment of the royal Memlooks before the departure of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n), was seizing everything he could lay his hands on, and molesting the people on his way. When the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n heard of this, he gave orders to the police that he should be arrested and hanged on the spot without trial. It was said that they did arrest him and hang him on a tree at Belbeis\nin his uniform and wearing his sword, bow, and quiver. They put his servants in irons and brought them to Ma\u1e33sharah.\n\nOn Friday; the 14th, the Sult\u0101n came down from the citadel, went to Kar\u0101fah, and visited the tombs of the Im\u0101m al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b and the Im\u0101m al-Laith, with his son, the Grand Master of the Horse. It was said that the Sult\u0101n spent a considerable sum in charity on that day. The Sult\u0101n\u2019s baggage and that of the Am\u012brs left for Raid\u0101niyyeh.\n\nOn Saturday, the 15th, the Sult\u0101n and Malik al-Ashraf Ab\u016b al-Na\u1e63r K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b left for Syria and Aleppo. It was long since the people had seen a Sult\u0101n start for these countries in this manner, never since al-Ashraf Bars Bai al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u012b set out for \u0100med, in the year A.H. 836, about 87 years earlier.\n\nOn the morning of this Saturday the remainder of the Am\u012brs assembled with the Sult\u0101n in the Maid\u0101n, in full-dress uniform, and on that day the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on Am\u012br Erkm\u0101s Ibn Tar\u0101 Bai Am\u012br al-Mejlis and appointed him Keeper of the Armoury, which office had been vacant since the appointment of al-Am\u012br S\u016bd\u016bn al-\u02bfAjem\u012b to the office of At\u0101bek.\n\nThe number of chief Am\u012brs who were detailed for personal attendance on the Sult\u0101n was fifteen; nine remained behind in Cairo.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[26] At sunrise on Saturday, the 15th, the troops of the Am\u012brs, forming the Sult\u0101n\u2019s personal escort, moved off in the following order:\n\n(1) The Corps commanded by Am\u012br Kurt Bai, one of the chief Am\u012brs, and formerly Governor of Cairo.\n\n(2) The Corps commanded by Am\u012br Ak Bai al-\u1e6caw\u012bl, 2nd Master of the Horse, one of the members of the Court.\n\n(3) The Body-guard under Am\u012br T\u0101ni Bey, the Treasurer.\n(4) The Body-guard under Am\u012br Abrak al-Ashrafi, one of the members of the Court.\n(5) The Body-guard under Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n Ibn \u1e32ar\u0101j\u0101, 2nd Daw\u0101d\u0101r, one of the Court.\n(6) The Corps under Am\u012br Baibars, a relation of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n.\n(7) The Corps under Am\u012br J\u0101n Bal\u0101t, known as Muwattir.\n(8) The Corps under Am\u012br \u1e32\u0101ns\u016bh Kurt.\n(9) The Corps under Am\u012br Tamr al-\u1e24asan\u012b, known as the Zardk\u0101sh.\n(10) The Corps under Am\u012br \u1e32\u0101ns\u016bh Ibn Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Chirkes.\n(11) The Corps under Am\u012br Anas Bai Ibn Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101, Chief Chamberlain.\n(12) The Corps under Am\u012br S\u016bd\u016bn Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u012b, Chief of the Corps of Guards.\n(13) The Corps under the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s son, al-N\u0101\u1e63ir Mu\u1e25ammed, Grand Master of the Horse.\n(14) The Corps under Am\u012br Erkm\u0101s Ibn \u1e6car\u0101 Bai Am\u012br Mejlis, who had been appointed Am\u012br Sil\u0101h.\n(15) The Corps under the At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn Ibn J\u0101n\u012b Bey, known as al-\u2018Ajem\u012b. His corps was remarkable for splendour and good order.\n\nWhen the last of these corps had passed the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n himself left by the Stable Gate near the steps. He was preceded by the royal trumpeter, named Burghash\u012b. The Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s cavalcade was magnificent; rarely has it been equalled in splendour. At the head of it came the three elephants, gorgeously caparisoned, then came the victorious troops in full-dress uniform, followed by the Am\u012brs, who were chiefs of the guard, carrying staves with which to keep back the people. After these came the Am\u012brs of the \u1e6cablkh\u0101nah and all the Am\u012brs of Tens, then the executive officials.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[27] There were also present in this cavalcade the distinguished brothers of the Sher\u012bf Berek\u0101t, Am\u012br of Mecca; these went in front of the Chief Am\u012brs. Then came all the\nchief Am\u012brs, with whom was the Sult\u0101n\u2019s son, His Highness al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, Grand Master of the Horse, and by his side was the At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn al-\u2018Ajem\u012b. Then followed the four judges of the Shafi\u2018\u012b Hanef\u012b, M\u0101lik\u012b, and \u1e24anbali sects. Then came the Khal\u012bfah, wearing the Baghd\u0101d turban with two ribbons, and a Ba\u2018lbec coat with black silk embroidery. He did not have the Khal\u012bfah\u2019s flag held above him; he had curtailed many customs observed by former Khal\u012bfahs who were kinsmen of his.\n\nThen came the Sult\u0101n\u2019s led horses, consisting of a pair with sugar-loaf headgear, and saddles with yellow silk coverings and side-drums; another pair had saddle-cloths and gilded saddles with gold-embroidered coverings. Some of the horses had saddles of crystal inlaid with gold, and studded with agate stones, set in silver. A body of chiefs of the Guard followed on foot carrying axes. There were before them neither tents nor royal flute-players as was customary in these royal cavalcades. Then came the baggage and boxes, and the garment cases covered with yellow silk, and the incense-bearer on foot with the censer ahead of him, followed by the Sult\u0101n al-Malik al-Ashraf K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Gh\u016bri\u2014may he ever be victorious.\n\nHe was preceded by the Khal\u012bfah about twenty paces in front of him. The Sult\u0101n rode a bay horse with numnah and gold saddle, wearing a cap and a white Ba\u2018lbec coat embroidered with a wide border of gold on black silk; it was said to have in it five hundred miskals of gold. That day was one of great splendour, a magnificent sight. The Sult\u0101n was handsome, and a fine figure in a procession.\n\nThus the Sult\u0101n advanced with the royal flag held over him, immediately behind him being the Chief Memlook, \u1e62unbul al-\u2018Othm\u0101n\u012b. He was accompanied by the armour-bearers in uniform, and a great number of his suite and jemadars.\n\nHe entered Cairo by the Zaw\u012blah Gate and passed through [28] the streets. All Cairo trembled at his presence on that\nday, the townsfolk greeted him with prayers for his welfare, and the women cheered him from the windows. The Sultan marched in that cavalcade until it came out by the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r Gate, and it was a gala day.\n\nThen the camp at Raid\u0101niyyeh was reached. On the following day chests were brought down containing the gold and silver, each chest containing gold in coin to the amount of 1,000 din\u0101rs, in addition to other metals. The treasury was depleted of all the money which had been collected since the commencement of this Sultan\u2019s reign, up to the date of the departure of this expedition. Moreover, a complete clearance was made of all the other storehouses, including articles of intrinsic value and highly wrought weapons collected by former Sultans, gilded saddles inlaid with crystal and agate; also gold-embroidered numnahs, crystal and enamelled drums, embossed sets of horse-armour, gold-embroidered camel saddles, and other royal treasures.\n\nIn charge of the chests were a party of treasury clerks and officials in uniform. These chests were borne on fifty camels; then came the armoury borne on a hundred camels, preceded by two drummers and fifers and instruments of military music mounted on camels. All these went on to the camp.\n\nOn Sunday, the 16th, the Sultan caused it to be proclaimed in Cairo that the army would advance on Friday, the 21st, that every expeditionary soldier must be present on that day, and that no excuse of any kind for absence would be accepted.\n\nWhen the Sultan had established himself in camp, he appointed a number of the deputies of the chief judges to accompany him on the expedition.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[29] He also had with him a great number of builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths, as was customary, and the Chief Sheikh with his troops and flags and drums. He led the Sultan\u2019s cavalcade on its entry into Damascus, in accordance with the ancient custom on expeditions.\n\n* * * * *\nOn the 18th, 19th, and 21st there left a number of Am\u012brs [names omitted] with their Memlooks, said to number 944 men. The \u1e32ar\u0101n\u012b\u1e63ah Memlooks, the imported Memlooks, [30] and those born in the country numbered five thousand.\n\nThis was the report; Heaven only knows the truth of it.\n\nIt was said that some two thousand of the \u1e32ar\u0101n\u012b\u1e63ah Memlooks, with the unfit, the Sheikhs, the Imported Memlooks, and those born in the country, remained behind in Cairo, in the barracks and in the citadel.\n\nWhile the Sult\u0101n was in camp at Raid\u0101niyyeh, a letter arrived from the Governor of Aleppo, telling him that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had sent a messenger with a letter, which he now forwarded to the Sult\u0101n by the same messenger. It was expressed in pleasant terms to the following purport. After calling the Sult\u0101n his father and offering prayers for his welfare, Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n asserted that he had not encroached upon the dominions of \u2018Al\u012b D\u014dl\u0101t except with his (the Sult\u0101n\u2019s) permission, and that he had rebelled against him. That it was he who had stirred up the ancient hostility between his father (Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s?) and the Sult\u0101n \u1e32\u0101it Bai, which led to what had happened, and had caused the greatest mischief in his (the Sult\u0101n\u2019s) country, so that his death was entirely justified. As to Ibn Suw\u0101r, who had succeeded \u2018Al\u012b D\u014dl\u0101t, if the Sult\u0101n thought fit to retain him, or to replace him, the matter rested entirely with him. As to the merchant importers of Circassian Memlooks, Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n said he had not stood in their way, but that they had complained of their treatment as regards their payment in gold and silver, and had refused to bring the Memlooks over. He further said that he was prepared to return to the Sult\u0101n the dominions he had taken from \u2018Al\u012b D\u014dl\u0101t, and would do whatever the Sult\u0101n desired.\n\nUpon this the Sult\u0101n summoned the leading Am\u012brs and read to them Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s letter, the contents of which greatly pleased both them and the Sult\u0101n and aroused in\ntheir minds a feeling that peace and an early return to their homes were at hand.\n\nBut as facts showed later, this was nothing but a piece of trickery and deception on the part of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n in order to achieve his objects.\n\nThe next day there arrived in Cairo the Am\u012br \u012an\u0101l Bai, Daw\u0101d\u0101r Sikk\u012bn, who had gone to Aleppo to obtain news of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. On his arrival he found that the Sult\u0101n had already started on the expedition, and had left Cairo. He reported that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s messenger had arrived at Aleppo, that he was desirous of peace, and had sent numerous presents to \u012an\u0101l Bai there.\n\nAs to the Sult\u0101n\u2019s doings in camp, the night of his departure from Raid\u0101niyyeh he conferred a robe on T\u016bm\u0101n Bai, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, and appointed him Regent in Cairo during his absence. He also conferred a robe of honour on the K\u0101\u1e0di Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, and appointed him Inspector of Markets in the place of Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101\u012b during his absence. He made Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 adviser on all Imperial questions.\n\nOn the same night lighted torches were brought, and a spark blew from them on to the Sult\u0101n\u2019s tent, and one side of it was burnt; the people did not regard this as a good omen for the Sult\u0101n.\n\n[31] When Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 entered Cairo he became a most important personage. He represented the Sult\u0101n\u012b, and became controller of the affairs of the country, and the Am\u012br Daw\u0101d\u0101r Keb\u012br was as a screw in his hand to be turned what way he would.\n\nOn that night the Sult\u0101n also conferred a robe of honour on Am\u012br Elm\u0101s, appointing him Governor of Cairo, charging him with its protection and to abstain from tyranny. He gave a robe of honour to the Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101\u012b, the Inspector of Markets, and ordered him to go with him to Aleppo. The Am\u012br Daw\u0101d\u0101r left the Sult\u0101n\u2019s presence and returned to Cairo, passing through the \u1e62al\u012bbah\u00b9 with a great cavalcade,\n\n\u00b9 A \u201c\u1e62al\u012bbah\u201d is a technical name for an Egyptian irrigation bank.\nwith criers in front of him proclaiming security to the people and the continuance of trade. No one was to walk about in the evening carrying arms; the molestation of tradesmen by Memlooks and slaves was forbidden. Men were to come for redress of grievances to the Gate of the Daw\u0101d\u0101r; the people shouted and made prayers for him. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r was beloved by the people and by the poor, and rarely did harm to anyone. Thus he made his way along the \u1e62al\u012bbah, in the midst of a great cavalcade with runners and water-carriers and crowds of people\u2014with the royal followers and Memlooks in front of him, and made his way to the residence. Then I said:\n\nCreation has been honoured by the Regent, whose word is law;\nNoble, brave in the fields of battle, a fine horseman,\nVictorious in battle with sword and lance.\nIf a wronged one complains to him of his wrongs,\nThe light of his justice arises for him,\nPromising that morning will appear;\nLord, be his helper and protector in all the changes and chances of this life,\nAnd spare Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 to his subjects;\nA second Moses, pure-hearted, a security against sorcery,\nA noble gentleman, then Inspector of Markets, he was born on the night of al-Kadr.\nOn account of his godliness he has regard for the noble Seyyids,\nAnd thus obtained a great heavenly reward;\nHe has become Director of the Food supplies,\nThe point of his lance pierces the necks of his enemies.\nA Pharaoh in Egypt, he has acquired the fortune of Y\u016bsuf.\nI seek protection for him through the S\u016brahs of the Kor\u2019\u0101n,\nAfter the Stars, the Light, and the Day of Resurrection.\n\nOn Saturday, the 22nd, the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n left the royal camp at Raid\u0101niyyeh, accompanied by the Khalifah, the four judges, his son, His Highness al-N\u0101\u1e63ir, Grand Master of the Horse, and Ak Bai al-\u1e6cawil, Second Master of the Horse.\n\nHe said the morning prayers and left for Kh\u0101nk\u0101h Siri\u0101k\u016bs, having remained seven days in the camp. He halted a day\nand a night at the monastery of Siri\u0101\u1e33\u016bs, and left on Sunday, the 23rd. On Monday, the 24th, a third instalment of wages was issued to the troops who had stayed behind in Egypt. Am\u012br Ta\u1e33\u1e6d Bai sat at the steps, and the wages were distributed in his presence; it was the first payment of wages in the absence of the Sult\u0101n. The same day the Am\u012br Daw\u0101d\u0101r gave orders to the leading Am\u012brs whom the Sult\u0101n had appointed to the Shar\u1e33\u012beh and Gharb\u012beh provinces to leave for their posts, and to protect the countries from devastation by the Arabs. So T\u0101n\u012b Bey left for the Shar\u1e33\u012beh and Ezbek, the gunner, for the Gharb\u012beh province. Al-Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh al-F\u0101jir went to Men\u016bfiyyeh, al-Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh Ab\u016b Sena to [32] al-Bu\u1e25airah. Bakhsh Bai had gone to the Fayy\u016bm to see about the construction of a dam there.\n\nThen the Daw\u0101d\u0101r issued a proclamation in Cairo to all the Royal Memlooks who had been detailed for the Dominions that they should accompany these Am\u012brs, and that none should remain behind, and they complied with his orders.\n\nOn Monday, the 24th, Am\u012br Naur\u016bz, T\u0101jir al-Mem\u0101lik, one of the Am\u012brs of the \u1e6cablkh\u0101nah died. He was originally one of Ashraf K\u0101it Bai\u2019s Memlooks. He had become very big and heavy, and was so fat he could hardly move, and he remained in this condition until he died.\n\nIt was reported that the Sult\u0101n bestowed upon his Memlook M\u0101m\u0101i, whom he appointed to the Censorship, the baggage of Naur\u016bz, his horses, mules, and tents. At least, that was what was commonly said.\n\nThe same day the sky became black with clouds, there was thunder, lightning, and torrents of rain. This happened on the 1st of the Coptic month Baunah. The rain continued for three days on end; it was considered quite a marvel. This was succeeded by violent winds and the sky became quite yellow at sunset. The people drew evil omens from this, of revolutions, which actually did take place later on. The same day news came from the Sult\u0101n that when he started from the monastery a man was found in his tent who was\nthought to be an assassin, sent by \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn, the Sult\u0101n\u2019s barber, who had incurred his displeasure, as previously mentioned. The enemies of \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn said that he had sent that fanatic to kill the boy named \u2018Abd al-Razz\u0101k, who had become barber to the Sult\u0101n in the stead of \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn. The man, who was thought to be a fanatic, was arrested and brought before the Sult\u0101n, who tried to make him confess, but he denied and was ordered to be hanged.\n\nThen the Sult\u0101n sent to Elm\u0101s, Governor of Cairo, to arrest \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn and his relations, and to hang him on his own gate. When \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn heard of this he fled from his home and hid himself. Then the V\u0101l\u012b arrested a number of Syces who were relations of \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn and put them in irons. Some said that they had been hanged in Ma\u1e33sharah, or imprisoned till the Sult\u0101n should return.\n\nPrevious to this stores of chaff and bran belonging to the Am\u012brs had been burnt to the value of about two thousand d\u012bn\u0101rs. This was put down to some of the Syces, relations of \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn the barber\u2014for if an animal is once down every one digs his knife into him. Persistent search was made for \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn the barber\u2019s capture, and it was said that the V\u0101l\u012b, on the flight of \u2018Alam al-D\u012bn, sent his Memlooks, in full uniform, to search for him, but without success.\n\nOn Friday, the 28th of Rebi\u2018 al-\u0100khir, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r left in order to see about repairing the dams at al-Faid and Ab\u016b Manj\u0101, which the guardians had failed to block up. The Nile had risen before orders had been issued on the subject, and had reached a height of 12 cubits. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r took the utmost trouble to close the sluices, boats were broken up under these two sluices, and still the water was uncontrolled; till at last God came to the rescue, and the Nile receded.\n\nDuring the month of Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u016bl\u0101, Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101i al-\u1e62agh\u012br, the Inspector of Markets, joined the Sult\u0101n. He had with him a little lad of 13 called K\u0101sim Ibn Al\u1e25med Bey Ibn Ab\u016b Yaz\u012bd Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, nephew of Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\nWhen the latter's brother, Ahmed Bey (the boy's father), was killed, his son Kasim fled with his tutor, and went to Aleppo in disguise, and then came to Egypt and lived there until the Sultan left for Syria, when he took him with him for reasons of his own, but no good came of it. The lad went out with Mamanai, with led horses before him. Moreover, the Sultan had provided him with an outfit and about 2,000 dinars, hoping that the boy's fame might be heard of in the Dominions of Ibn Othman, and that it might be said that there was one of Ibn Othman's family in Egypt, a male child. The Sultan thought that the troops of Ibn Othman, on hearing this, would desert and come over to him, but nothing came of it.\n\nThe lad Kasim passed along the Salibah wearing a Turkoman turban, a royal dagger in his belt, and was said to have a ruby ear-ring. He was accompanied by a number of Osmanlis, Amir Mamai, and Inal Bai. The latter was Dawadar Sikkin, who had come from Syria, and had been ordered by the Sultan to return a second time, and to go with him to Aleppo.\n\nAmongst the things that happened during the absence of the Sultan, Amir Elmash, Governor of the Police, took to making levies on the people for the construction of roads in various quarters. They made one road at the top of the Bran Market, one in Husseiniyyeh, and another over Kanjarah al-Hajjib. A road was also made at Farayin, and at al-Makhs, and several others elsewhere, and they blocked up a number of the wicket gates in Cairo. He ordered a lamp to be hung up outside every shop, and none were to leave their houses after dark, nor to carry arms. It was a matter of interest that the Dawadar did not disturb any of the Aulad al-Nas, nor compel them to live in the citadel during the Sultan's absence.\n\nIt was customary, when the Sultan went to Syria, for the guardians of the citadel to tyrannize over the Aulad al-Nas and to compel them to spend every night in the citadel. This was an annoyance, and an extreme fatigue to the men, having to climb up every night, and a long way from their homes in the winter. Any man who failed to go himself had to provide\na substitute. This was done till the days of Ashraf K\u0101it Bai. It was recorded amongst the good acts of the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, and the people blessed him for abolishing this odious custom.\n\nAnother incident in the Sult\u0101n\u2019s absence was that one of the imported Memlooks wanted to buy corn from a ship by the river bank and could not find a porter. Finding one of the fell\u0101h\u012bn of the \u0160a\u02bfid with a donkey and a sack, he tried to take them from him. This led to a quarrel, during which the Memlook struck the fell\u0101\u1e25i a severe blow on the head which drew blood, and the man threw himself into the river and was drowned. This brought a crowd round the Memlook, whom they seized and took to the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s house, where he was put in irons and sent to the V\u0101l\u012b. When his comrades heard of this they went to the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s house; they found he was away at the dam of al-Faid seeing about its being [34] blocked up. The Memlooks were told that the Daw\u0101d\u0101r had handed over the Memlook to Elm\u0101s the V\u0101l\u012b. Thereupon a great number of the imported Memlooks came down from their quarters with a view to plundering and burning the V\u0101l\u012b\u2019s house and releasing the Memlook. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r, however, took no further notice of that murder, and no more was heard of it.\n\nThe following event took place during the absence of the Sult\u0101n: One of the eunuchs named \u2018Amber, chief of the Ashrafi order, who lived in the ruins of Tatar (?), and was supposed to be wealthy (?), and had in his possession consignments of pay for the Memlooks, was attacked at night, whilst asleep in his house, by thieves, who beat him on the head with jelabahs till he died. They carried off everything, and killed his male and female slave, making no disturbance whatever. Am\u012br \u1e6cak\u1e6d Bai, Governor of the Citadel, was completely at a loss to understand how this could have happened right in the heart of the citadel, when the gates were locked after sunset; it was considered quite an extraordinary occurrence.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 9th, a chief K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b of the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b sect died;\nhe was called Kalkashand\u012b. May the Lord have mercy upon him! He was a holy man of learning and excellence, well versed in the traditions. He filled the office of K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b twice during the reign of Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b. He was very old, nearly 90; he was one of the most distinguished scholars of the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b sect. May God have mercy upon him!\n\nOn the same day came news of the arrival of the Sult\u0101n at S\u0101lihiyyeh on Tuesday, the 25th Rebi\u02bf al-\u0100khir, and it was said that when about to leave there he gave permission to the Khalifah and the four judges to go forward as far as Gazah.\n\nWhen he reached Ka\u1e6diy\u0101\u00b9 he was met by Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh Rajlah, Governor of Ka\u1e6diy\u0101, where he was hospitably entertained and given (it was said) many presents.\n\nAmongst stories circulated during the march was that a mule belonging to the \u1e24anef\u012b K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b was stolen, but was recovered with the aid of a gift; also that a bundle containing the \u1e24anb\u0101l\u012b K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b\u2019s clothes was stolen from his tent; and that a camel laden with money belonging to the Sult\u0101n was stolen, but the culprits were arrested, and three camel-drivers were cut in two. None of these reports were verified.\n\nThen came news of the entry of the Sult\u0101n into Gazah on Thursday, the 4th, where he was met by the Governor, Am\u012br D\u014dl\u0101t Bai, hospitably entertained, and offered numerous presents. He was said to have stayed there five days, and then to have moved on.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n when at Gazah was said to have decorated Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Alw\u0101l\u012b, Janitor of Dahishah, and to have appointed him chief teacher in the place of Shih\u0101b\u012b A\u1e25med Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn\u012b, who had been removed from that office. This appointment may be regarded as one of the mistakes of the time, he being unsuitable for the post.\n\nOn Friday, the 19th, came Ibn Ab\u016b al-Radd\u0101d with news that the Nile was found, on measurement, to have reached 12 cubits, which was considered extraordinary, within\n\n\u00b9 The town still exists on the road to Palestine.\n6 cubits of a full Nile, according to Ma\u1e33r\u012bz\u012b in his topographical dictionary; Sheikh Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b, in his book entitled Kaukab al-Raudat, gave it as 24 inches more. Since the time of N\u0101\u1e63ir Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn \u1e32al\u0101\u02bf\u016bn it had not been known to reach 12 cubits; during his time, in the year A.H. 761, it did reach 12 cubits. The full Nile was on the 6th of Misra. The rise [35] in that year reached nearly 24 cubits; the people suffered considerable loss in consequence, and prayed for its fall. It eventually subsided at the end of the month T\u016bt. During the reign of Ashraf Bars Bai, in the year A.H. 838, the Nile rose 11 cubits 10 inches, and reached its full height on the 2nd of Misra. The people thought that the Nile would cover the land during the sowing season, beyond its proper time; but everything turned out prosperously that year, and the Nile reached its maximum height at the proper time. Mention will be made of this in its own place.\n\nOn Saturday, the 27th, the death occurred of Am\u012br J\u0101n\u012b Bey; he was one of the Am\u012brs entitled to a band, and was one of the Memlooks of Ashraf \u1e32\u0101it Bai; he was an excellent man.\n\nIn the same month a new coinage was issued and the old one cancelled. The value of the old coins was proclaimed at two Ni\u1e63fs to the Ra\u1e6dl, and that of the new coins as marked upon them. The affairs of the people came to a standstill.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 1st, a number of Deputy Judges and nobles proceeded to the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s house to offer him their congratulations on the new month.\n\nNews came of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s entry into Damascus on Tuesday, the 8th; he was met by Am\u012br Bars Bai, Governor of Syria. The Sult\u0101n entered with a numerous cavalcade, preceded by the Khal\u012bfah, the four judges, and the chief Am\u012brs, the Am\u012brs of \u1e6cablkh\u0101n\u0101h, the Am\u012brs of Tens, the principal office-holders, the executive officials, a strong body of troops, and many others.\n\nHe was met by the Am\u012brs and troops of Syria. He had over his head the dome-shaped umbrella as used by ancient kings. The city of Damascus was splendidly decorated in his\nhonour, and the trumpets of good tidings were sounded for him in the citadel. Certain European merchants showered gold and silver over his head, and S\u012b Bai spread silk hangings for his horse to walk over. But the Memlooks so crowded upon him in their greed for the gold and silver that the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n nearly fell off his horse, so much was he jostled by the people. So he stopped the scattering of gold and silver and the spreading of silk hangings under his horse\u2019s feet. It was in truth a gala day in Damascus, one to be long remembered.\n\nThe procession made its way into Damascus by the Gate of Victory, out into the open plain as far as the Stone Seat (Ma\u1e63\u1e6dabah), known as the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s Stone Seat, at K\u0101b\u016bn al-K\u0101k\u016bni. The Sul\u1e6d\u0101n ordered one of his chamberlains to rebuild it, as it had fallen to pieces through lapse of time.\n\nThere had not been a procession on this scale between the days of Ashraf Bars Bai, when he went to Syria in the year A.H. 836, and that of Malik al-Ashraf K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b.\n\nThe Sul\u1e6d\u0101n spent nine days at the Ma\u1e63\u1e6dabah at al-K\u0101b\u016bn. It was said that K\u0101d\u012b Kem\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Taw\u012bl preached at the Mosque of Ben\u012b Umeyyah on two Fridays, and that the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n did not attend the Friday prayers there. The decorations at Damascus were kept up for seven days; after that the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n started for \u1e24om\u1e63, and then moved thence and went to [36] \u1e24am\u0101h. He was there met by the Governor J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who was said to have entertained him in an even more princely fashion than did the Am\u012br of Damascus. According to rumour the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n quartered there K\u0101sim Bey Ibn Al\u02bfmed Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, previously mentioned as having started with Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101\u02bei, the Inspector of Markets, from Egypt.\n\nIt was said that on Monday night, the 14th of this month, there was a terrible eclipse of the moon,\\(^1\\) the earth being completely darkened. The eclipse lasted more than fifty minutes; the entire orb of the moon was darkened, and remained so till the last third of the night.\n\nOn Monday, the 14th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r gave orders for an\n\n\\(^1\\) See Oppolzer\u2019s *Canon der Mondfinsternisse*, p. 367, where this eclipse is recorded.\nArab criminal to be hanged on the Kan\u1e6darah al-H\u0101jib. The affairs of Egypt were extremely well directed by the Daw\u0101d\u0101r during the Sult\u0101n\u2019s absence. He instructed Am\u012br Elm\u0101s, Governor of Cairo, to patrol the streets of the town every night after dark, and a hundred of the imported Memlooks were detailed for the purpose to patrol by turns with the V\u0101l\u012b till daybreak. Thus good order was maintained during the absence of the Sult\u0101n, contrary to the usual experience. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r was constantly reproaching Elm\u0101s the V\u0101l\u012b for impressing people to maintain the roads; it was a most tyrannical practice. He arranged with the police and the watchmen to levy contributions on the citizens for the repair of the roads, and they used to collect a considerable amount in this way. The watchmen would stop at a certain man\u2019s house and demand what money they thought fit, and if the owner ran away they used to nail up the door and fasten his children and family inside till he came and paid them what they demanded. They would fasten a widow-woman in her house, and leave her without food or drink till she threw them from the window a blanket, mattress, or carpet, or something of the kind. They used to levy on the poor the payment of an Ashrafi or two, and from those in good circumstances in some cases five, in others ten, Ashrafis as they chose. This they did in the Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d al-Maks, Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d B\u0101b al-Ba\u1e25r, the Milk Market, al-Huseiniya, the Bran Market, Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b, and other places; in this way they exercised a tyranny exceeding that of Huni\u0101des, on the pretext that the construction of roads was for the good of the Mu\u1e25ammedans. Much money was gathered, and but little spent. So S\u012b Bai determined that a collection should be made from Seyyidah Nefisah to the end of Ibn T\u016bl\u016bn\u2019s market-place on all property and shops in that locality. It was supposed that they would construct a wall to prevent a surprise attack by the Arabs. But all this was a trick to obtain the people\u2019s money. They began to make lists of the properties and shops in the quarter of T\u016bl\u016bn and Kar\u0101fah.\nWhen the Daw\u0101d\u0101r learnt that Eln\u0101s was committing these acts of oppression in his name, he swore a great oath that he had had no knowledge of it, and put a stop to these dreadful doings, gaining thereby the thanks of all the people.\n\nThen the Memlooks in the employ of the Chamberlain tried to start another piece of tyranny. They collected a good deal of money from the residents of Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b in order to cut through the bar across the mouth of the lake, which had greatly increased in height, so much so that it prevented the passage of ships into the lake. When the Daw\u0101d\u0101r got news of this, he put a stop to this also, and ordered the entrance to be completely blocked up to prevent ships from entering.\n\nOn Saturday, the 19th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r returned; he had been to the Fayy\u016bm to inspect the embankment which Am\u012br Bakhsh Bai had built there. During the Sult\u0101n\u2019s absence the Daw\u0101d\u0101r used to ride out every day accompanied by the Am\u012brs of Tens, who were still in Egypt, towards Ma\u1e6dariyyeh and Birkah al-\u1e24ajj; he used to return by the Na\u1e63r Gate, preceded by very many Am\u012brs and soldiers. This was done with the express object of preventing the Arabs and fell\u0101\u1e25\u012bn from thinking that Egypt was denuded of troops; it was a well-conceived idea.\n\nOn Monday, the 21st, corresponding to the 27th of Ab\u012bb, the Nile was at its fullest. The artificial dam was cut on the 22nd, corresponding to the 28th of Ab\u012bb. It had reached its full height four days before the month Misra. The Nile had only once before been known to reach its fullest as early as the 27th of Ab\u012bb, in the year A.H. 845. When the Nile was in full flood, Am\u012br T\u016bm\u0101n Bai, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r and the Regent went to cut the dam in a rowing boat (?), proceeded to the Nilometer, and anointed the column.\n\nHe then left the Nilometer in the rowing-boat, accompanied by a number of leading Am\u012brs\u2014\u1e6cak\u1e6d Bai, Governor of the Citadel, Am\u012br Erzamak, N\u0101shif, and others. When the dam was cut the Daw\u0101d\u0101r returned home with a great procession, preceded by the Am\u012brs in full dress, and many of the leading\nofficials. As soon as the dam was cut the water poured with tremendous force into the basins. The people rejoiced that day that the Nile had reached its height, before its usual time. And someone said: \"Enjoy the water of the Nile before its inundation; a draught of its water is as good as medicine to us; its sweetness has without doubt come in floods.\"\n\nAmongst the events of this time was the Daw\u0101d\u0101r's putting a stop to people residing on the embankment at Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b and all the creeks. He made a bridge over the Zar\u012bbah canal, the wharf at which the plaster was unloaded. So the business of the Middle Island fell into decay, not a house remained, not a shop was opened. He prevented the gamblers from putting up a gaming-house, either on the embankment or along the Zar\u012bbah. The houses of Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b fell into ruins, especially those of the children of al-J\u012b\u02be\u0101n, the house of the Private Secretary, and other houses of the well-to-do classes suffered likewise. All the owners suffered much hardship this year in consequence and lost the rent of their houses. [38] It was said that Khaukhat al-Jisr (Bridge Lane) was to be shut up.\n\nThe K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bsa, the Inspector of Markets, besought the Daw\u0101d\u0101r to allow the ships to enter as usual and to let the people live on the embankment; but he refused, saying that the people would corrupt the wives of the gentlemen who came with the Sult\u0101n for the ceremony of the opening of the Nile.\n\nHe kept firmly to his decision; then towards the end of the Nile functions he made a concession to the K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 that five ships belonging to dealers might be admitted to the lake as usual; so the confectioner, the cheese-monger, the fruiterer, the vegetable-seller, and the (S\u016bwikhati?) entered, and no others. These men, after remaining for some days moving about here and there and not finding anybody to trade with, left again, and the Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b became quite deserted; there was no one there even to kindle\na fire. This formed the subject of an elegy by Sheikh Bedr al-D\u012bn al-Zeit\u016bn\u012b:\n\nI asked the Lord of Heaven to grant victory to our Sult\u0101n,\nAl-Gh\u016br\u012b, the Father of Victory, the esteemed King,\nMost noble, invincible, Defender of the True Faith, of perfect dignity.\n\nA feeling of desolation came over the creation at his absence;\nHere is the Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b shedding tears; we can rightly bewail the loss of pleasant places,\nEspecially the covered places and her fair banks;\nThere the light-hearted could meet,\nAnd assuredly companionship is better than loneliness.\nThere the sweet, shady sycamore grew,\nThe birds and the beasts of the field have mourned over her,\nThe streams have shed bitter tears and cried out in anguish of heart\nAt the calamity that has happened to the Bridge.\nIts lofty tree weeps tears of blood in its mosque;\nThe Syrian is mourning over the granaries,\nThe houses along the banks are deserted and tenantless,\nHer palaces are void, and, oh! how lovely are the people with empty palaces.\nLament with much grief and lamentation over Birkah al-Ra\u1e6dl\u012b,\nOver the punishment and loss that has befallen her;\nThe shipowners used to take delight in her;\nThere the fruiterer hastened with his ship bearing plums and pomegranates,\nFlowers of many kinds, white roses, lilies, and myrtles, greeted with beaming faces;\nThere came also the cheese-maker, cooking on board, joining fire to water on the stream;\nFor the eaters there were thirsty confectioneries,\nThe thirst of which was quenched with cloud-water.\nThe pistachio-tree gave splendour to her open spaces,\nAnd her sugar records the tradition of Ab\u016b Dharr;\nThere the opium-eater was in constant delight,\nBut since the curtailment of his joys he has been engrossed in anxious thought;\nThere the drunkard was in the height of enjoyment, passing round the wine-goblets on the night of the full moon.\nThere were the ships, decked or open, for passengers;\nReciters of verse came thither with players of musical instruments,\nAnd lutes sounding softly like the turtle dove.\n\n[39] Now time has obliterated all those resorts,\nCrows and owls in their nests mourn over them;\nThe anemone has cast its petals there,\nThe tender branches of the trees have shed their foliage,\nThe blackbird has donned his sombre robes;\nThere is heard the sound of water as the river beats against the bank,\nThe clouds shed tears, and the dawn is as the beginning of the night,\nThe noonday sun is darkened, and the full moon eclipsed till dawn.\n\nOur Middle Island has become a waste\nFrom the damming up of the water,\nThey have taken away its falling timbers for sale,\nAnd left nothing but the bare walls;\nThe boatmen are in dire distress,\nThere is no means of livelihood nor ship-owner;\nThey have sold their deck-coverings and sails,\nThe oars have vanished\u2014none knows whither,\nO eyes, shed copious tears of grief!\nO heart, patiently endure!\nGod's favour be on the days that passed so joyfully, when we in Egypt were in security.\n\nThe Daw\u0101d\u0101r it was who issued these prohibitions,\nWith intent to protect the women who came out with the Sult\u0101n,\nAnd the purdah girls, in the early morning,\nTo protect the wives and daughters of the people from misfortune;\nBy giving these orders he was the most noble protector of the wives and daughters of all people from trouble.\nHad it not been for the intercession of M\u016bs\u0101,\nFor which he has received thanks and rewards,\nThe dealers' ships would not have been allowed to enter,\nNor would anyone have appeared on the embankments.\nOh, Lord, grant victory for our Sult\u0101n and the Army of Egypt!\nGrant them a safe return to their nation and country,\nWe pray for the chosen one Mu\u1e25ammed of the family of\n\u1e24\u0101shim,\nTo guide to all goodness and felicity,\nLikewise blessings be on his family and companions and on the\nnext generation\nAnd perfect grace be given them on the Day of Resurrection;\nMay the mercy of God be upon them\nAs long as the morning breeze blows over the branches\nAnd the turtle-dove cooes.\nAnd the versifier, al-\u2018Auf\u012b, prays for all who discover a fault\nof Zeit\u016bn\u012b\u2019s, and graciously draw a veil over it.\n\nOn Friday, the 26th, Sheikh T\u0101j al-D\u012bn al-Dh\u0101kir died.\nMay God have mercy on him! He was one of the chief \u1e62\u016bf\u012b\nSheikhs, well known among the people for his justice and\nuprightness, in fact a guileless man.\n\nIn the month of Rejeb Am\u012br \u1e6car\u0101 Bey died, one of the\nAm\u012brs of Tens. On the first of the month, which fell on\na Thursday, a number of deputy judges, noblemen, and clerks\nwent to the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s house to wish him good luck in the\nnew month. On Thursday, the 8th, Taghr\u012b Birdi, known as\nShemsham\u0101n\u012b, died. He claimed to be one of the Am\u012brs of\nTens; it was said that he was once a water-carrier; he died\nthe owner of land and property. He was rich, but was said\nto have been avaricious and miserly.\n\nThe same day came news of the death of one of the Am\u012brs\n[40] of Tens called Mus\u0101yed, who was on active service with the\nSult\u0101n. He was originally one of Ashraf K\u0101it Bai\u2019s Memlooks.\n\nOn this day the Am\u012brs who had been in the Shar\u1e33\u012beh and\nGharb\u012beh provinces returned. At this time also, the people\nwere troubled by the new coinage. Goods were sold at two\nprices, a silver ni\u1e63f became equal to 16 dirhems of the old\ncoinage; the new coins were reckoned by number, they were\nextremely light, and the people suffered in consequence, and\nshops were closed for the same reason. Bread and other necessaries went up in price, which almost brought about a famine.\n\nThen came news of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s arrival at Aleppo, which he had entered on Thursday the 10th of Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u0100khira, which day was observed as a high day and holiday.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n was preceded by the Khal\u012bfah, the four judges, and other Am\u012brs as in his Syrian procession. The canopy of the royal parasol was carried over his head by Kh\u0101ir Bey, chief of the Am\u012brs, Viceroy of Aleppo, as S\u012b Bai, the Governor of Damascus, had done.\n\nAs soon as the Sult\u0101n had entered Aleppo, emissaries arrived from Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, Emperor of Constantinople. It was said that he sent his military judge, a person named Rukn al-D\u012bn, and one of his Am\u012brs called Kar\u0101j\u0101 Pasha with 700 dependants to Aleppo, and I have it on written authority that the Sult\u0101n on seeing the K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n and Kar\u0101j\u0101 Pasha abused them for Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s action towards him, more especially for his taking possession of the dominions of \u2018Al\u012b D\u014dl\u0101t. In reply the K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b and Kar\u0101j\u0101 Pasha said that their master had commissioned them to negotiate a peace, and that they were ordered to comply with the Sult\u0101n\u2019s wishes without further reference to him. But this was mere bluff and trickery to prevent the Sult\u0101n\u2019s going to war, and to shake his determination\u2014which was borne out by subsequent events.\n\nThen Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b produced legal opinions from the learned men of their country, who had pronounced the death of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl as justified by the sacred law. Moreover, Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n wrote to the Sult\u0101n in this wise: \u201cThou art my Father and I ask thee to pray for me, but do not come between me and the \u1e62\u016bf\u012b.\u201d\n\nAnother piece of deceit practised by Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n (towards the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b) was his asking for sugar and sweetmeats, in response to which demand al-Gh\u016br\u012b sent him a hundred \u1e32\u012bnt\u0101rs of sugar and sweetmeats in large boxes. Ibn\n'Othm\u0101n also wrote that nothing could deter him from wiping off Ism\u0101'il Shah from the face of the earth, \"but do not,\" he said, \"let this prevent peace between you and me.\" He tried to give the impression that he was making war against the S\u016bf\u012b, but this was not his real object. They said that when he was at Kais\u0101riyyeh he was about to march against the S\u016bf\u012b. Then the Sult\u0101n presented Ibn 'Othm\u0101n's emissaries with robes of honour.\n\nIbn 'Othm\u0101n was said to have sent al-Gh\u016br\u012b many presents, also to the Khal\u012bfah and to Am\u012br S\u016bd\u016bn al-'Ajem\u012b. Amongst these were forty Memlooks, furs, suits of velvet and serge, Ba'lbec costumes, and other things. To the Khal\u012bfah he sent two furs, a velvet suit with cuffs of gold thread, and two suits of superfine serge. Ibn 'Othm\u0101n's military judge also gave him two suits of serge, a prayer-carpet, and a mule. The Sult\u0101n also sent splendid presents to Am\u012br Keb\u012br, including furs, velvet, and serge clothing and two slaves.\n\nAfter this the Sult\u0101n deputed Am\u012br Moghul Bey Daw\u0101d\u0101r [41] Sikk\u012bn to proceed to Ibn 'Othm\u0101n with a letter containing the conditions of peace.\n\nMeanwhile his army halted awaiting the reply. I composed the following verses about the Sult\u0101n's expedition from the time of his departure from Egypt up to his entry into Aleppo. Then I said:\n\nOffer up prayers for victory for our noble king, Sult\u0101n of Egypt,\nHis departure for Syria, Damascus, and the Land of Beauty,\nHas the Divine sanction.\nHe decided to reconnoitre the country,\nAnd it forthwith opened its bounty to him.\nIts governors came to meet him in willing submission,\nThe keen-edg'd sword was not drawn against him.\nHad Alexander the Great been alive among mankind,\nHe would have honoured him and paid him all courtesy,\nHis epoch surpassed that of all kings in splendour;\nSo listen thou and hear without more ado.\nI saw him when he passed by with the cavalcade,\nMightier than Bark\u016bl\u1e33, who himself was an Ashrafi,\nThe Khalifah and the judges rode before him,\nThe serpents hid themselves from his armies;\nI put him under the protection of the S\u016brah of Y\u016bsuf;\nAnd his troops under the protection of the verses of the S\u016brah of \"the ornaments of gold\".\nThursday was the day of his entry into Gazah with his army;\nDamascus exclaimed in her joy at his coming,\n\"Welcome to the just king of men.\"\nThe brow of Rubwah glowed with light\nWhen Joseph's encampment (i.e. Saladin's) decked itself with flowers;\nH\u0101m\u0101h came under the protection of his justice,\nThe Orontes forthwith obeyed him without demur,\nThe Euphrates yearned for him and came on in full flood,\nAleppo was cheered by his arrival,\nBut Egypt was desolate at his departure;\nAleppo was honoured by him and said \"O, joy!\nHail to the graceful newcomer.\"\nOur Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016bri felt strongly supported,\nSince the All-merciful encircled him with his secret favour.\nMay God preserve him for ever,\nAs long as the Zephyr intoxicates like wine.\nThese are the feeble verses of Ibn Iy\u0101s.\nMay all blessings fall on the Holy Prophet,\nThe best of mankind and the greatest of helpers,\nOn his family and kindred\u2014as long as the night\nCovers with its darkness, and the day dawns.\n\nIt was related that the Sult\u0101n on his entry into Aleppo gave instruction to K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Kem\u0101l al-D\u012bn \u1e6caw\u012bl to deliver an oration in the grand mosque of Aleppo. A great congregation assembled. The K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b ascended the pulpit and preached an eloquent sermon, quoting sacred traditions in favour of peace.\n\nThe Muezzins also called in the mosques, and the Sult\u0101n's portions of the Kor'\u0101n were read. Preachers delivered sermons, and it was observed as [42] a high day in their mosque. The Sult\u0101n did not attend, nor was he present at Friday's\nprayers, as he had been at Damascus, for which he was blamed. K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Kem\u0101l al-D\u012bn preached in the large mosque during the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s stay at Aleppo. According to accounts of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s doings there he made K\u0101ns\u016bh the Viceroy of Aleppo, an Am\u012br of a thousand, also Y\u016bsuf al-N\u0101\u1e63\u012br\u012b the superintendent of the buttery, who had been deputy of \u1e24am\u0101h, and Tar\u0101 Bai Deputy of \u015eafad, and Tamr\u0101z Deputy of Tripoli. He also distributed thirty d\u012bn\u0101rs each to the camp-followers who had accompanied him without subsistence allowance. He originally meant to give fifty d\u012bn\u0101rs, but a protest was made by the Secretary of the Memlooks, and he reduced it to thirty.\n\nTo the troops he gave three months\u2019 ration money. Then the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n issued to the imported Memlooks a number of arms from the citadel stores at Aleppo, also innumerable horses. Moreover, he continued giving them large presents of money, well-bred horses, and weapons on the road, but he did not give anything to the Kar\u0101ni\u015fah Memlooks, which offended them greatly.\n\nThe Sul\u1e6d\u0101n read the Khatmah on the Great Maid\u0101n at Aleppo on Thursday and Thursday night. There were present the Am\u012br of the Faithful al-Mutewekkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h, the four judges, and the Sheikhs of the Monasteries. The Am\u012br of the Faithful prayed with the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n in his tent afternoon and evening. On that day the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n gave away 400 d\u012bn\u0101rs and 100 head of sheep. He presented to the K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b of the Shafi\u2018is 70 d\u012bn\u0101rs, and to his deputies and \u2018Ulem\u0101s 70 dinars, a similar amount also to the \u1e24anefi K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b.\n\nThe M\u0101lik\u012b K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b received 50 d\u012bn\u0101rs and his three deputies 30, and to the \u1e24anbali K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b he allowed a similar sum. He also conferred on the Sheikhs 50 d\u012bn\u0101rs each; on the poor who had come with him he bestowed 10 d\u012bn\u0101rs each. To the readers of Aleppo who were present at the Khatmah and others he gave 5 d\u012bn\u0101rs each.\n\nAfter that the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n summoned the Am\u012brs of Thousands, and their deputies, the Am\u012brs of the Tablkh\u0101n\u0101h, and Am\u012brs\nof Tens, and made them swear on the Kor'\u0101n that they would not betray him. He gave orders for the parade of the troops in the Maid\u0101n of Aleppo in full dress; they were made to pass under two crossed swords, after the custom of the Turks, who regard this as a most sacred oath.\n\nThen the Sult\u0101n sent for K\u0101sim Bey from \u1e24am\u0101h, and conferred a robe of honour on him. After this news reached Aleppo that Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had arrested the Sult\u0101n\u2019s emissary, Am\u012br Moghul Bai, one of the Daw\u0101d\u0101rs, and put him in irons. The Sult\u0101n had sent Am\u012br Kurt Bai, one of the leading Am\u012brs, who had been Governor of Cairo, to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n with presents worth about 10,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs. He had also conferred on the military K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n and his minister Kar\u0101j\u0101 Pasha above mentioned a sumptuous robe of honour with a wide yalbagh\u0101wi border, and gave them permission to return to their own country. It was an obvious error of judgment on the part of the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b to dismiss the emissaries of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n before the return of Moghul Bai with trustworthy news of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\n[43] Kurt Bai heard on his arrival at \u2018Aint\u0101b that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had refused peace, and had arrested Moghul Bai and put him in irons. He had meant to hang him, but let him off at the intercession of some of his ministers. Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n also meant to shave his victim\u2019s beard. He suffered indescribable insults at Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s hand. On learning this Kurt Bai returned to Aleppo and informed the Sult\u0101n of what Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had done to Am\u012br Moghul Bai. He also reported the arrival of the advanced guard of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s army at \u2018Aint\u0101b, and of their having captured the fortresses Malat\u012byyeh, Behsin\u0101, Kerker, and others.\n\nThe announcement of this bad news by Kurt Bai disturbed the Sult\u0101n and people, and the whole army.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n decorated Am\u012br \u2018Abd al-Razz\u0101k and invested him with the governorship of the district of the tribe of Du\u2019l Gh\u0101dir. The Sult\u0101n then left Aleppo, accompanied by the Chief of Am\u012brs Kh\u0101ir Bai with a very strong escort.\nThe Governor and Am\u012brs of Aleppo also left with their troops, and halted a day\u2019s march from the city.\n\nThe infantry with them amounted to five thousand; these troops received at that time a month\u2019s pay from the Sult\u0101n. These were followed by Chief \u0100m\u012br S\u012b Bai, Deputy of Damascus, Tamr\u0101z, Deputy of Tripoli, \u1e6car\u0101 Bai, Deputy of \u1e62afad, and the Deputies of \u1e24om\u1e63 and of Gazah. Their departure from Aleppo took place on the 17th of the month Rejeb.\n\nA rumour had got about that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was advancing from one direction and Ibn S\u016bw\u0101r from another. Then the Sult\u0101n gave orders for the Army to march from Aleppo and occupy Jil\u0101n, in order to engage the rebel Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, saying that he himself and the Am\u012brs would shortly follow to take part in the battle, and that the issue would be in accordance with God\u2019s will.\n\nThis is an extract from a letter of the commander of the Faithful to his son Ya\u02bfk\u016bb. The same letter gives prices at Aleppo; the price of barley was 27 ni\u1e63fs an ardebb; bread 3 dirhems a ratl; cheese 2 nisfs a ratl; meat 9 dirhems a ratl; Egyptian molasses half a fedd\u0101h a ratl. The price of wheat went up as high as 2 ashraf\u012bs an ardebb; and vetches (for camel-fodder) were selling at 124 dirhems the ardebb.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n issued an imperial edict to the Daw\u0101d\u0101r containing instructions as to his subjects. The imported Memlooks in quarters were not to molest the people or disturb the tradesmen. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r was to inquire into the cases of all those in the prisons, of both sexes, and to release debtors and others, in fact all except those imprisoned for a capital offence.\n\nHe also sent orders that if the road to the \u1e24ej\u0101z were clear of Arabs, the pilgrimage to Mecca was to be started from Cairo, but that if the road was dangerous there was to be no pilgrimage that year. The imported Memlooks were to be forbidden to leave their quarters and enter the town, and anyone of them molesting the people was to be summarily\ndealt with and hung. These orders were read to them at the citadel in the presence of \u2018Am\u012br \u1e6cak\u1e6d Bai, the Governor. The Sult\u0101n sent his greetings to all the Am\u012brs and troops.\n\nThe first day of the month of Sha\u2018b\u0101n fell on a Friday; it was also the Coptic New Year\u2019s Day, which was regarded as an uncommon occurrence, especially as the latter was on a Friday, when there is a particular hour at which prayers are [44] answered. On the Saturday the Daw\u0101d\u0101r conferred a robe of honour on one of the Court, J\u0101n\u012b Bey al-\u1e32a\u1e63\u012br, a royal Memlook, and appointed him to the Inspectorship of Manfal\u016b\u1e6d in the place of \u012an\u0101l Ibn J\u0101n\u012b Bey, whose eyesight had failed.\n\nOn Sunday, the 3rd, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r inspected the prisoners in confinement and the women under arrest. He released a number of debtors, paying off their creditors himself. He also released a number of thieves, and ordered that a number of prisoners charged with murder should be cut in two. But he gave orders for the detention of some of the latter in prison till the Sult\u0101n\u2019s return. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r also gave substantial gifts to the poor. He commanded that the Khatmah should be read in all the mosques in Cairo, and that prayers should be offered up for the victory of the Sult\u0101n. On Monday, the 4th, he conferred a robe of honour on Y\u016bsuf al-Badr\u012b, and restored him to the position he formerly held in the Vizierate for the fourth time. On the same day orders were issued for the departure of the \u1e24ajj to Mecca as usual. It had been rumoured that there would be no pilgrimage this year.\n\nOn Tuesday or Tuesday night died the former \u1e24anef\u012b judge, Burh\u0101n al-D\u012bn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ibn al-Karak\u012b, whose full name was Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ibn al-Sheikh Zein al-D\u012bn \u2018Abd al-Rahm\u0101n Ibn Ism\u0101\u2018il al-Karak\u012b al-\u1e24anef\u012b. He was a learned and distinguished man, an eminent chief of the \u1e24anef\u012b lawyers, a pupil of al-Sheikh Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn al-\u1e32\u0101f\u012bj\u012b, Sheikh Saif al-D\u012bn, and other learned Sheikhs of the \u1e24anef\u012b sect. He was Im\u0101m to al-Ashraf K\u0101\u2018it Bey, and rose to great distinction, holding many high posts, amongst which were Chief Sheikh of the College of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s mother in Tabb\u0101nah and accountant\nof the Sult\u0101n\u2019s household. After that he twice held the post of Chief K\u0101d\u012b of the \u1e24anef\u012bs. He then became head of the Ashrafiyyeh College, and endured much annoyance at the hands of Al-Ashraf. He had an agreeable countenance, was easy of approach, civil, and of a refined nature. He was in his eighth decade, he had lived a happy life, and died a witness to the faith; he had become very wealthy. The cause of his death was as follows: He was living at Birkah al-Fil, and was going down to perform his ablutions at the Kait\u016bn steps, wearing a pair of clogs. He slipped and fell into the water; it was the Nile flood, and owing to the weight of his clothing he sank and was drowned.\n\nOn the same date the Daw\u0101d\u0101r conferred a robe of honour on one of the court officials named Kajm\u0101s, and appointed him to the Inspectorship of Men\u016bfiyyeh in the place of K\u0101ns\u016bh. News came from Aleppo of the death of Shems al-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn N\u0101shi, Sheikh of the Book-market, who was in close attendance on the Sult\u0101n. He had held a number of high offices. News also came of the death of Am\u012br Y\u016bsuf, known as Ma\u1e33\u1e6dash, who had been Governor of \u015eafad; he was dismissed from that office and then died at Aleppo. The death of Abrak, one of the Am\u012brs of Tens and a former Inspector of the District of G\u012bzeh, was also reported.\n\nA large number of those who were with the Sult\u0101n died of disease; and in Gazah, Damascus, and Aleppo many Am\u012brs of Tens, members of the Court, servants, and others died from disease incurred on the march. Confirmation of these reports was received during this month, and the news that the Sult\u0101n, when at Aleppo, promoted many Am\u012brs to the command of a thousand men. Amongst these were Am\u012br [45] Y\u016bsuf al-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b, superintendent of the buttery, Tar\u0101 Bai Ibn Yeshbek, Deputy of \u015eafad, K\u0101ns\u016bh, Ust\u0101d\u0101r al-\u1e62ul\u012bbah, K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Ashrafi, Deputy of the Citadel of Aleppo, Tamr\u0101z, Deputy of Tripoli, and others. The Sult\u0101n, it appears, reduced many of the Chief Am\u012brs who were incapable, and promoted the above-named in their places.\nOn Friday, the 15th of Sha\u2018b\u0101n, al-H\u0101j \u2018Al\u012b al-Birm\u0101w\u012b died; he was Falconer and in charge of the Privy Purse. He rose to honours and greatness not hitherto reached by other Falconers, thanks to Dame Fortune. His death was caused by a pustule, which formed in his back; he was laid up for twelve days and then died. He was originally a fell\u0101l\u012b of Birmah, and sold calico and carpets, riding on a donkey, till Providence opened a door for him. He never did anyone any harm, and was of a gentle and very humble disposition. After his death he was found to have been the possessor of five hundred thousand, six hundred d\u012bn\u0101rs in gold, about forty-five brood mares and camels, one hundred head of buffalo, one thousand sheep, four hundred oxen at his irrigation wheels, and property of still greater value than what is enumerated above. The total amount of his property was valued at one hundred thousand d\u012bn\u0101rs.\n\nOn Saturday, the 16th, came news of the great catastrophe which had overwhelmed the whole country. After a long absence of news of the Sult\u0101n and his army, a letter was brought by a runner alone from Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n Sub-Daw\u0101d\u0101r, one of the Chief Am\u012brs, telling that the Sult\u0101n believed and disbelieved by turns in Selim Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, till finally Moghul Bey, Daw\u0101d\u0101r Sikk\u012bn, arrived in a sorry plight wearing a mouldy cap without a tassel (?), an ancient dirty corslet (?) on his body, and riding on a wretched jade of a horse.\n\nHe had been deprived of his horses, baggage, and clothing. He brought the news that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had refused to make peace, and had said to him: \u201cTell your master that he can meet us on Merj D\u0101bek.\u201d He also said that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had put him in irons and wanted to shave off his beard, and had sent him to be hung on three occasions, but that some of his ministers had interceded for him. He had made him carry horse-dung in a basket on his head, and had subjected him to other insults and terrors.\n\nWhen the Sult\u0101n heard this he realized the seriousness of the quarrel between himself and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. It was said\nthat the Sult\u0101n then gave Moghul Bey one thousand d\u012bn\u0101rs, horses, and clothing to the extent of his losses.\n\nAmongst other news of the Sult\u0101n it was commonly said by the people that he said the midday prayers, then mounted, and left the Aleppo Maid\u0101n on Tuesday, the 20th of Rejeb, accompanied by Am\u012br of the Faithful al-Mutwekkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h, and the four judges. The Deputies of Damascus and Aleppo and a number of other deputies had started previously with an advance guard, preceded by drums, fifes, and gunners, so that Aleppo resounded with noise and excitement.\n\nOn the Sult\u0101n\u2019s departure from Aleppo he went to \u1e24ailan and halted there; on the morning of the 21st he left Ji\u0161\u0101n and proceeded to Merj D\u0101bek, and remained there till the 25th. The latter was a day of constant ill fortune. He was suddenly surprised by the presence of a body of troops of Sh\u0101h Sel\u012bm Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. The Sult\u0101n said the morning prayers, mounted, and proceeded to Zaghzagh\u012bn and Tell [46] al-F\u0101r, where the alleged tomb of the Prophet D\u0101\u2019\u016bd is. He there mounted his charger, wearing a light turban and a mantle, carrying an axe on his shoulder; he inspected the army in person; on the right wing was the Am\u012br of the Faithful, also wearing a light turban and mantle, carrying an axe on his shoulder like the Sult\u0101n, and having over his head the Khal\u012bfah\u2019s banner. Around the Sult\u0101n, borne on the heads of a body of nobles, were forty copies of the Kor\u2019\u0101n in yellow silk cases; one of these copies was in the handwriting of Im\u0101m \u2018Othm\u0101n Ibn \u2018Aff\u0101n. There were also round him a body of dervishes, among whom was the successor of Seyyid Ahmed al-Bedaw\u012b (founder of the \u1e62\u016bf\u012b sect), accompanied by banners. There were also the heads of the K\u0101diriyyeh sect with their green banners, the successor of Seyyid\u012b Al\u012bmed al-Rif\u0101\u2018i with his banners, and Sheikh \u2018Af\u012bf al-D\u012bn, attendant in the mosque of Seyyidah Nef\u012bsah with black banners. Alongside of the Khal\u012bfah was the youth K\u0101sim Bey Ibn Ahmed Bey Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, of whom mention has already been made; according to some authorities\nhe had over his head a yellow, according to others a red, silk flag. The Royal Red Standard was carried about 20 yards behind the Sult\u0101n, and under it marched the chiefs of the Memlooks, Sunbul al-\u2018Othm\u0101n\u012b, the four judges, and Am\u012br Tamr al-Zardk\u0101sh, one of the principal Am\u012brs. On the right flank of the troops was Am\u012br S\u012b Bai, Deputy of Damascus, and on the left flank Kh\u0101ir Bey, Deputy of Aleppo.\n\nAccording to some authorities the first to be engaged in the battle was At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn al-\u2018Ajem\u012b, with Malik al-\u2019Umar\u0101 S\u012b Bai, Deputy of Damascus, and the Kar\u0101ni\u015fah Memlooks, but not the imported Memlooks. These, accompanied by a number of Deputies, fought desperately and put to flight the troops of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, inflicting terrible losses and capturing seven standards, the guns on the carriages, and the musketeers.\n\nIbn \u2018Othm\u0101n, in consequence, thought seriously of a retreat or a surrender, as over 10,000 of his men had been killed. At first the army of Egypt was victorious; would that it had continued so! But a report reached the Kar\u0101ni\u015fah Memlooks that the Sult\u0101n had ordered the imported Memlooks not to go into action at all, but to let the Kar\u0101ni\u015fah Memlooks fight alone, which damped their ardour. Meanwhile At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn had fallen, also Malik al-\u2019Umar\u0101 S\u012b Bai, Deputy of Damascus, and a great number of the right flank turned defeated. This was followed by the flight of Kh\u0101ir Bey, Deputy of Aleppo, and the defeat of the left flank, Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh Ibn Sult\u0101n Chirkess being taken prisoner, some said killed. Moreover, Kh\u0101ir Bey was said to be secretly in league with Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n against al-Gh\u016br\u012b, a report which was confirmed later. He was, moreover, the first to fly before all the troops, and proclaimed defeat. But this loss was inflicted on the Egyptian troops by the will of Providence in fulfilment of His decrees.\n\nNow the Sult\u0101n was standing under the flag with a small body of Memlooks, and he began to call out: \u201cOh, sirs, now is the time to quit yourselves like men, this is the time to\nshow your valour.\u201d But none listened to him, and they began to leave him, whilst he told the Fa\u1e33\u012brs to pray to God for victory, \u201cfor now,\u201d said he, \u201cyour prayers are needed.\u201d But no help or succour came. The Sult\u0101n\u2019s heart became as a red-hot coal, which could not be extinguished. The day, too, was fiercely hot, and such a dust was raised between the opposing armies that they could scarcely see each other. God\u2019s anger was kindled against the Egyptian troops, and their hands seemed to be fettered so that they could not fight, [47] and their sight failed them. I wrote these verses about the battle:\n\nWhen our Sult\u0101n with his army\nMet the foe on the field of Merj D\u0101bek,\nHe cried, \u201cIs there any to succour me?\u201d\nThe tongue of events replied:\n\u201cThou hast exposed thyself to calamity and thou must be the butt of it.\u201d\nTerror struck the hearts of the foreign Memlooks,\nSo that they cried out \u201cWhere shall we hide?\u201d\nThe sordidness of their minds so filled them with the lust for plunder,\nThat it brought about their destruction.\n\nNow as the confusion and terror increased Am\u012br Tamr al-Zardk\u0101sh feared for the safety of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s standard, so he lowered it, folded it up, and concealed it. Then he approached the Sult\u0101n and said to him: \u201cOur King and Master, the troops of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n are upon us, save thyself and go back to Aleppo.\u201d When the Sult\u0101n understood this a kind of paralysis fell upon him, which affected one side, and caused his jaw to drop. He asked for water, and they brought him some in a golden cup, from which he drank a little. Then intending flight, he turned his horse round, moved on a few paces, fell off his horse, stood for a moment, and died from the shock of his defeat. It was said that his gall-bladder burst, and that red blood flowed from his throat.\nWhen his death became known Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops advanced against the men who were round the Sult\u0101n; they killed Am\u012br Baibars, one of the Commanders, and a number of the bodyguard and of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s servants. As to the Sult\u0101n, his body was not found amongst the dead, nor was it ever known what became of it; it was as if the earth had swallowed it up there and then. Therein is a lesson to him who considers.\n\nThe Ottoman troops then trampled down al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s tents and overthrew all the goods and provisions stacked round them. The copy of \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s Kor\u2019\u0101n was lost, they stamped upon the Fak\u012brs\u2019 flags and the Am\u012brs\u2019 banners, and plundered everything belonging to the Egyptian troops.\n\nThus the rule of al-Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b came to an end, in the twinkling of an eye, as though he had never been. Praise be to Him whose kingdom never wanes, and Who never changes! Thus he and his kingdom came to an end together; the kingdom of Egypt and the Dominion of Syria, over which he had reigned for fifteen years nine months and twenty days. The date of his accession was the 1st of Shaww\u0101l A.H. 906, and he died on the 25th of Rejeb, A.H. 922. During this period his subjects were in a miserable condition. Then I said:\n\nLook with wonder at al-Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b,\nWho, after his tyranny had reached its height in Cairo,\nLost his kingdom in an hour,\nLost this world and the world to come.\n\nThis battle lasted from sunrise till the afternoon, and ended as God had decreed. The killed on both sides were innumerable. Three of the Chief Am\u012brs were killed, At\u0101bek \u1e62\u016bd\u016bn al-\u2018Ajem\u012b, Baibars, the kinsman (?) of the Sult\u0101n, and Ak Bai al-Taw\u012bl. K\u0101ns\u016bh Ibn Sult\u0101n Chirkess was taken prisoner. The following were also killed: S\u012b Bai, Deputy of Damascus; Tamr\u0101z, Deputy of Tripoli; Tar\u0101 Bai, Deputy of \u1e62afad; and A\u1e63l\u0101n, Deputy of \u1e24om\u1e63; besides a great many Am\u012brs of Damascus, Aleppo, and Tripoli, a number of\nEgyptian Am\u012brs, Am\u012brs of the \u1e6cablkh\u0101nah, Am\u012brs of Tens and Guards.\n\nOf the Egyptian troops, the Kar\u0101ni\u015fah Memlooks suffered the most, but few of the imported Memlooks were in action; no feats of horsemanship were displayed by them; in fact, they drew neither sword nor lance, and might have been blocks of wood for all the stir they made.\n\nIt was a time to turn an infant\u2019s hair white, and to melt iron in its fury. Merj D\u0101be\u1e33 was strewn with corpses and headless bodies, and faces covered with dust and grown hideous. Dead horses lay everywhere, saddles were scattered about, also swords inlaid with gold, steel sets of horse-armour inlaid with gold, helmets, armour, and bundles of clothing. No one paid any heed to these things, for both armies were occupied with matters of more importance. A popular poem says:\n\nMy horse beat applause when I had touched my lute on the day of battle,\nAnd sharp swords sang East and West;\nThey struck again and again, hitting in the music of the blows\nThe heads of the enemy\u2014and dancing\nAs they entered into the fight.\n\nThen Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n advanced with his troops, and took possession of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s camp. He sat in the circular tent, took the wardrobe (?) and the costly goblets belonging to it, the armour-case, the weapons, the money-chest, and all articles of value, and each of his Am\u012brs took to himself a tent of one of al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s Am\u012brs. The troops occupied the tents of the Egyptian, Syrian, and Aleppo troops, thus exemplifying the maxim that \u201cThe misfortunes of some are the good fortunes of others\u201d. No Ottoman king has ever gained such a victory, but once Tim\u016brleng entered Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s country, and fought against one of his ancestors, named Yildirim, who was defeated, taken prisoner, and placed by Tim\u016brleng in an iron cage, and exposed to the ridicule of the people in Tim\u016brleng\u2019s country. Being unable to bear it he swallowed a diamond ring and died in the cage.\nNo Sult\u0101n of Egypt ever suffered such a reverse in one day, or died under his standard, having all his property and equipment captured by the enemy, except K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b.\n\nThus was it written in the Divine decrees. Neither the Sult\u0101n nor his Am\u012brs ruled the people justly; they reaped the reward of their evil doings, and were vanquished by Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. Truly it has been said, \u201cWhere are the kings who wrought oppression in the land, and from whom God has freed the country?\u201d\n\nThen the Sult\u0101n Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n left Merj D\u0101b\u0113k and entered Aleppo, taking possession of it without opposition; and he halted on the same Maid\u0101n that al-Gh\u016br\u012b had previously [49] occupied. This is the full account of the battle as received by us, and all that passed between al-Gh\u016br\u012b and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\nThe Am\u012brs and troops after their defeat made for Aleppo, but on trying to enter that town they were attacked by the inhabitants, who killed a number of the soldiers, taking their arms, horses, and equipment and laying hands on the things they had left in the town for security. Indeed, they suffered worse treatment at the hands of the people of Aleppo than they did from the soldiers of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. There had been bad feeling between the people of Aleppo and the Imperial Memlooks since they had gone on ahead of the Sult\u0101n from Cairo to Aleppo, along with K\u0101n\u012b Bey, Grand Master of the Horse. They had forced an entrance into the houses of the people, violating their women and children; so the people of Aleppo had suffered much injury from them. No sooner did they realize that these troops were beaten, than they set about to take their revenge.\n\nWhen the Am\u012brs and the remnant of the soldiers saw this they quitted Aleppo precipitately and made for Damascus, which they reached in the sorriest plight, deprived of clothing and horses. Most of the troops entered Damascus, some riding on donkeys, some on camels; many were almost naked, with just a cloak round them.\n\nNever before had such a disaster befallen Egyptian troops.\nThe Am\u012brs, the executive officers, and the soldiers remained in Damascus until the survivors should arrive and it should be known who had died and who was still alive. It was said that the Am\u012brs when in Damascus had no protection from the burning sun, until their servants made them shelters from branches of trees. As to Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, he took up his quarters in the Maid\u0101n of Aleppo. Then Am\u012br al-Mu\u2019m\u012bnin al-Mutewakkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h approached him and the three chief judges, Kem\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6caw\u012bl, Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn al-Dem\u012br\u012b, Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Fut\u016bl\u012b, of the Sh\u0101fi\u2019i M\u0101lik\u012b and \u1e24anbal\u012b sects respectively. K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Mahm\u016bd Ibn al-Shihnah had fled with the troops to Damascus, having been plundered of all his baggage and clothing. He arrived at Damascus in a miserable condition.\n\nIt was said that when the Am\u012br al-Mu\u2019m\u012bnin presented himself to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n in the Maid\u0101n, the latter treated him with respect and asked him to be seated. He inquired where he came from, and on being told from Baghd\u0101d promised to send him back there; but many different stories were circulated on the subject. When the Khal\u012bfah requested leave to depart the Sult\u0101n presented him with a robe of honour from his own clothing, and gave him a sum of money and sent him back to Aleppo, putting him under observation so that he should not escape.\n\nThe story told about the three judges was that the Sult\u0101n abused them and said that they took bribes for their administration of the Sacred Law, and canvassed for offices by bribery; that not one of them set an example of good conduct, for they did not prevent their Sult\u0101n from oppressing the people but looked on at this and did not condemn it. All kinds of strange stories were told and credited as true.\n\nI was informed by one who saw Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n that he was a square-built, broad-chested man, of a fair complexion, wide between the eyes, with an aquiline nose [perhaps a misprint for Akna\u2019l\u2019Anf(?)], a stout figure, with a moustache, but no beard, big-headed, wearing a small\nturban, smaller than those worn by his Am\u012brs. On his arrival at Aleppo, the people surrendered the town to him without opposition. K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Ashraf, Governor of the Citadel, fled with the troops to Damascus, leaving the gates [50] of the Citadel open.\n\nWhen this news reached Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n he sent off a man who was lame and beardless, with a wooden club in his hand, who went up to the citadel, entered it without opposition, affixed seals to the stores therein, and took possession of money, arms, and other articles of value. Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n did this that it might be said that he took the citadel of Aleppo by means of a lame man with a wooden club, and the weakest man in his army. Someone has said: \u201cTake care not to despise a weak foe, for a fly can make the lion\u2019s eye bleed.\u201d\n\nIt was reported that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n after capturing the town of Aleppo only entered it on three occasions. First when he went up to the citadel to inspect the stores, amongst which he found an amazing quantity of money, arms, and articles of value. The money amounted to about a million d\u012bn\u0101rs. He also found gilt horsings and stirrups, axes and saddles inlaid with gold and crystal, side-drums, studded bridles, costly rings, sets of painted steel horse-armour, splendid helmets and other weapons, such as neither he nor any of his ancestors had ever seen or owned before, nor any of the Emperors of Constantinople. For what al-Gh\u016br\u012b had collected by oppression and violence, and the valuables he had extracted from the treasuries of former kings of the Circassian Turks were quietly taken possession of by Sel\u012bm Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n without any trouble whatever. And not included in this was the property left in \u1e24alab by the Am\u012brs in Command, the Am\u012brs of the \u1e6cablkh\u0101nah and the Am\u012brs of Tens, and the executive officers and soldiers, in the shape of money, arms, clothing, and equipment. It was also said that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n took possession of thirteen citadels in the Sult\u0101n\u2019s dominions, and the property they contained. In fact, the quantity of money, arms, and valuables which he captured was unlimited. He became\npossessed of it all, by destiny. He also took innumerable horses, mules, camels, and tents. Bearing on which someone has said:\n\nDoes it not chance that one is deprived of his portion, though wide awake,\nWhile another obtains his, even while he sleeps.\n\nThe second occasion of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s visit to the citadel was when he went to say the Friday prayers in the mosque of al-\u016atr\u016bsh, where his name was mentioned in them. Prayers were also offered up for him from the pulpits in the town of Aleppo and the surrounding districts. The town was illuminated, candles lighted in the bazaars, and voices were raised in prayer for him as he passed by on his return from the mosque, and the people made great rejoicings.\n\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm al-Samar\u1e33\u0101nd\u012b, Y\u016bnus al-\u2018\u0100dil\u012b, and al-\u2018Ajem\u012b al-Shen\u1e33j\u012b declared themselves for him. These were close companions of al-Gh\u016br\u012b, but had been secretly in league with Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and in correspondence with him about the affairs of the Sult\u0101n and the country. When al-Gh\u016br\u012b was gone, they showed the same friendship to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and set to work to depreciate al-Gh\u016br\u012b and to enumerate his base actions to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, becoming at last his adherents, and forgetting all al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s kindness to themselves.\n\n[51] Another who had been secretly plotting against the Sult\u0101n was Kh\u0101ir Bey, Governor of Aleppo. He was the first to cause the Sult\u0101n\u2019s troops to break, when he deserted the left flank, and went off in the direction of \u1e24am\u0101h. When Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had taken possession of Aleppo he sent for Kh\u0101ir Bey and conferred a robe of honour upon him; he became one of his Am\u012brs and took to wearing the round turban and black tassel of a Turkoman, and clipped his beard short. Thus he tendered his submission to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, who called him Kh\u0101in Bey (traitor) because he betrayed his own Sult\u0101n.\n\nWhen this took place his own Memlooks deserted him, and went off with the troops to Egypt. This event bears a close\nresemblance to the case of Ibn al-\u2018Alkam\u012b, Vizir of Baghd\u0101d, who plotted against the Khal\u012bfah al-Must\u0101\u2018\u0161im Bi\u2019ll\u0101h. When H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b became Sult\u0101n of Baghdad, and killed the Khal\u012bfah, he became a close attendant on H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, who then turned against him and killed him, saying: \u201cYou were no good to your own master, and are not likely to be of any good to me.\u201d Very probably the same thing will happen to Kh\u0101ir Bey.\n\nThe third occasion on which Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n entered Aleppo was when he went in to the bath; and he then bestowed a considerable sum of money on the Mu\u2018allim.\n\nNow the Khal\u012bfah and the three judges, the Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b, the M\u0101lik\u012b, and Hanb\u0101l\u012b, remained interned in Aleppo, not leaving the city without the Sult\u0101n\u2019s permission. There also remained there, after the defeat, many leading men, including K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b \u2018Abd al-Ker\u012bm Ibn al-J\u012b\u2018\u0101n, Secretary to the Imperial Treasuries, \u2018Abd al-Ker\u012bm Ibn Fakh\u012brat, one of the Secretaries to the Memlooks, and \u2018Abd al-Ker\u012bm Ibn al-Adm\u012b, Accountant of the Armoury, Re\u2019\u012bs Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn al-Kais\u016bn\u012b, Im\u0101m to al-Gh\u016br\u012b, and a number of others whose names I do not remember. These persons remained behind in Aleppo after the defeat waiting for permission to leave.\n\nWhen Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n entered the town he proclaimed security to all, and announced that trade should be carried on as usual. He also ordered that all persons who had horses, arms, or clothing belonging to the Am\u012brs or the troops were to bring them in to him, and that anyone failing to do this, if denounced, was to be hung forthwith.\n\n[Here follows a list of Am\u012brs and others killed in the battle, or made prisoners, omitted in the translation.]\n\n* * * * *\n\n[52] Now let us return to what was taking place in Cairo. On the arrival of the letter from Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, the Sub-Daw\u0101d\u0101r, giving an account of the terrible battle, and of the loss of the Am\u012brs, nobles, and judges, there arose great lamentations in the family of At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn al-\u2018Ajem\u012b, for he\nwas a devout, good, and kind-hearted Am\u012br. He was known as S\u016bd\u016bn Ibn J\u0101n\u012b Bey, and was originally one of Ashraf K\u0101it Bey\u2019s Memlooks. He had held several high offices, including that of Am\u012br Mejlis and Chief Armour-bearer. He showed great courage in action, and splendid feats of horsemanship; he continued to a fight till he was killed on his horse. May the Lord have mercy on him. So there was mourning for the Sult\u0101n that day, and for the Am\u012brs and nobles, and lamentation and weeping in all the thoroughfares of Cairo, for [53] those who had fallen. Cairo and its people were in great agitation, confusion, and wild talk reigned everywhere.\n\nOn Sunday, the 17th Sha\u2018b\u0101n, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r heard that the Beni \u2018A\u1e6diyyeh and Na\u2018\u0101'im Arabs had plundered the estates of the Shark\u012beh province and carried off about 400 head of sheep belonging to the Sult\u0101n, and had gone into the W\u0101d\u012b \u2018Abb\u0101sah. On hearing this the Daw\u0101d\u0101r performed the midday prayers, and then rode out with five hundred Memlooks to meet the Arabs, came upon them suddenly, and they fled from before him, and the Am\u012br and his party recovered all the goods and sheep and crops and returned to Cairo the same day.\n\nDuring this month he conferred a robe of honour on Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101. He also went about Cairo issuing proclamations to restore public confidence, and to abolish the system of exactions known as monthly and weekly payments and all recent oppressive measures. He declared that Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 would continue in office and that no one was to invoke the protection of anyone against him. So the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s influence and the esteem felt for him became twice as great as before.\n\nHe combined many high offices, and was supreme over the affairs of the country.\n\nOn Monday, the 18th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r paid the troops in Cairo their wages. They were distributed by Am\u012br Takt\u0304 Bai, Deputy of the Citadel, at the steps. This was the occasion for much talk about the Sult\u0101n\u2019s death, and manifestations\nof distress thereat. On the same day the Daw\u0101d\u0101r ordered a parade of those in prison, including the women; and thereupon he set a large number at liberty, including J\u0101n Bey, Daw\u0101d\u0101r of Am\u012br Tar\u0101 Bai, who had been in prison at Maksharah for some time, on account of money which he had embezzled whilst he was pleader in charge of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s Privy Purse. He also released K\u0101d\u012b Bedr al-D\u012bn Ibn Tha\u2019lab, K\u0101d\u012b of Asy\u016b\u1e6d, who had also been imprisoned at Maksharah for arrears of fines. He further released his son Shems al-D\u012bn and his brother Nejm al-D\u012bn, together with \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 al-D\u012bn Ibn K\u0101tib Ghar\u012bb, the nephew of Ab\u016b al-Fadl, also the Mu\u2019allim, Shensh\u016b al-Yah\u016bd\u012b, a convert to Mu\u1e25ammedanism, whose imprisonment has already been mentioned. He also set at liberty the Mu\u2019allim Ya\u2018k\u016bb, the goldsmith, Mu\u2019allim at the Mint, and a large number of workmen, fella\u1e25\u012bn, and others, including the women who were in seclusion and nobles who were in prison, leaving in there only criminals and those charged with capital offences. He cut off the hands of a large number of the latter and let them go. He then cut in two a number of criminals, amongst whom was a man named \u2018Abd al-K\u0101dir ab\u016b Diyat, and cut off the hands of several thieves. He discharged K\u0101d\u012b \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 al-D\u012bn Ibn Ab\u012b al-Su\u2018\u016bd Ibn K\u0101d\u012b Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ibn Z\u0101hirah, K\u0101d\u012b of Mecca, who had been for some time in irons, in Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s house. The circumstances that led to his arrest were the following. A certain Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Samar\u1e33and\u012b preferred a complaint against him to the Sult\u0101n that he had found a quantity of hidden treasure at Mecca. The Sult\u0101n then summoned the K\u0101d\u012b from Mecca in disgrace; on his arrival the Sult\u0101n demanded the treasure from him. He denied the existence of it, and the Sult\u0101n put him in irons in charge of Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t, and he remained thus in his keeping for a long time though quite innocent.\n\n[54] On Tuesday, the 19th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r conferred a robe of honour on Shih\u0101b\u012b Al\u1e25med Ibn al-Mundh\u012br\u012b \u1e24asan Ibn al-T\u016bl\u016bn\u012b and restored him to the post of chief\nMu'allim, from which the Sult\u0101n had deposed him in favour of Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Alw\u0101l\u012b, guardian of Dahishah. On the same day the Daw\u0101d\u0101r made proclamation in Cairo that all the recent taxes were abolished, and that the decrees in force under Ashraf K\u0101it Bey were to be observed. This was received with general acclamation. Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 went throughout Cairo fixing the prices of commodities, so that a kind of vermicelli, which was being sold at four dirhems the ratl, was fixed at two dirhems; cheese and meat also came under the new tariff.\n\nDuring the same month Zein\u012b opened the dam at Ab\u016b Manja, the Nile having risen on that day to twenty cubits. This was on the 22nd day of T\u016bt, the first Coptic month. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r used during the Sult\u0101n\u2019s absence to ride out to Ma\u1e6dariyyah daily, and on his return to enter by the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r, preceded by the Chief Am\u012brs who had remained behind in Egypt, and a strong body of troops. Immediately in front of him were runners and naptha throwers (?), and his Memlooks wearing swords and carrying lances with coloured silk pennons.\n\nThese processions caused a great sensation in Cairo, and the people received him with shouts of welcome. He used to picture himself as Sult\u0101n before he became so; he had, in fact, become very powerful and was greatly feared.\n\nOn Friday, the 22nd, when the Sult\u0101n\u2019s death was confirmed, the preachers did not offer up prayers for the Sult\u0101n, nor was his name mentioned from the pulpits, but only the Khal\u012bfah\u2019s; and some said, \u201cMay God appoint our best over us, and not our worst.\u201d\n\nThis state of affairs went on for a long time, Egypt remaining without a Sult\u0101n, and likewise the dominion of Syria. During this time the Arabs committed depredations in the eastern and other districts. They plundered a number of dwellings, carrying off all the cattle and sheep, and even robbing the women of their jewellery. An enormous number of Fell\u0101h\u012bn were killed during these troubles besides messengers\nand others; the roads were closed to travellers, affairs grew even worse when the Sult\u0101n\u2019s death became certainly known, and confusion reigned in Egypt. All kinds of ill-omened reports were spread as to the fate of the Sult\u0101n and his army.\n\nThe most notorious in these depredations were the followers and a number of the \u2018Ash\u012br of the Arab Sheikh Am\u012br Ahmed Ibn Ba\u1e33ar. They committed excesses, specially amongst the soldiers and merchants, who came in with the caravans from Syria; they killed great numbers of them, stealing their property and camels. Those who escaped death were stripped bare. In fact, the troops suffered worse things at the hands of these Arabs than they did from Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n; and this after they had reached safety, between \u1e32atiy\u0101 and \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh.\n\nIt was also rumoured that the imported Memlooks had planned to come down from the barracks to loot and burn \u1e34\u0101n al-Khal\u012bl\u012b and kill the Turkish merchants there, for they said, \u201cThese merchants are on the side of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and exulted in the death of our master.\u201d\n\nWhen the Daw\u0101d\u0101r heard of this he summoned the officers [55] in charge and said to them, \u201cI look to you alone to prevent this sedition,\u201d and forbade them to leave the barracks. Had it not been for the timely intervention of the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, who smothered the smouldering insurrection, Cairo would have been completely wrecked by the imported Memlooks.\n\nDuring the same month the Daw\u0101d\u0101r gave his attention to the manufacture of certain weapons of war, such as wooden shields and muskets and other things of this nature. It was reported that he would become Sult\u0101n before the return of the army. The mover in this matter was Am\u012br \u1e6cak\u1e6d Bai, Governor of the Citadel, and Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, second Daw\u0101d\u0101r. As on the previous Friday the preachers did not mention the Sult\u0101n\u2019s name in the prayers.\n\nAfter Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n\u2019s letter giving an account of the defeat of the army and of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s fate, there was an entire absence of any authentic news for about forty days. All\nkinds of rumours were afloat, one to the effect that J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Governor of Damascus, had stopped any going to Egypt and had detained the army in Damascus.\n\nNews also arrived from Am\u012br \u1e24usein, Deputy of Jeddah, and al-Re\u02beis Selm\u0101n al-\u02bfOthm\u0101n\u012b, that on proceeding on the way to Hind (along the Arabian coast) with the army before mentioned and arriving at Kamr\u0101n (near Zab\u012bd, in Yemen), a Hind village, they built a fortress with flanking towers, completing it in about five months. Am\u012br \u1e24usein then dispatched a body of troops towards a place called al-Lihyah, and another to M\u016br\u0101, whilst he himself with the rest of the army remained at Beit al-Fityah for about a month. After that Am\u012br \u1e24usein and Re\u02beis Selm\u0101n proceeded with their troops against Zab\u012bd, in the possession of \u02bfAbd al-Malik, brother of Sheikh \u02bf\u0100mir.\n\nThis he besieged, and captured it on Friday morning, the 20th of Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u0100khirah, A.H. 922. They found a large population there. The same letter also announced that \u1e24usein, after taking Zab\u012bd, attacked the fortress of the town of Aden, and nearly took it. Also that they had appointed to the command of Zab\u012bd one of Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s Memlooks, one of the Am\u012brs of Tens named Bars Bai. The latter had with him some Memlooks and followers, being joined also by a body of about 10,000 Arabs. So when Bars Bai became possessed of Zab\u012bd he governed the place like a Sult\u0101n, and appointed a Daw\u0101d\u0101r, a treasurer, and officials as Sult\u0101n\u2019s do. He and his troops acquired great spoils there.\n\nDuring this month also the Daw\u0101d\u0101r inspected the troops in Cairo. The inspection took place from his house. He thought this necessary because he had intelligence that a number of ships had been sighted outside the frontier towns of Alexandria and Rashid; and he was afraid they might have been sent by Ibn \u02bfOthman. So he lost no time in parading the soldiers and telling them to be on the alert, and to get their kit (?) ready in case this news should be confirmed. Then the meeting broke up and the soldiers went off in frantic haste.\nOn Saturday, the first day of Ramad\u0101n, many of the Deputy Judges called on the Daw\u0101d\u0101r and congratulated him on the new month. The three Chief Judges and the Khal\u012bfah, being prisoners of Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n at Aleppo, were unable to return to Egypt. On Sunday, the 12th day of Ramad\u0101n, corresponding to the 1st of the Coptic month B\u0101bah, the Nile remained steady at 20 cubits; it had risen higher in the previous year, and continued unabated until the 1st of H\u0101t\u016br.\n\nThen came the news by a messenger [already related in pp. 46, 47] of the miserable condition of the troops who reached Damascus, of the treachery of al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s former friends, and that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was sole master from the Euphrates to Aleppo. When the Daw\u0101d\u0101r heard of this he ordered the V\u0101l\u012b to take possession of the houses belonging to Samar\u1e33andi and Y\u016bnus al-\u2018\u0100dil\u012b. So the V\u0101l\u012b went there and arrested their families and retainers, placed Samar\u1e33andi\u2019s servant in irons, and put seals on his stores and on those of Y\u016bnus al-\u2018\u0100dil\u012b. They had been in secret correspondence with Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, about the affairs of the Sult\u0101n and the country. But the master of the house has the best knowledge of what goes on in it.\n\nOn Friday, the 17th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r said the Friday prayers, and then went on to meet the Chief Am\u012brs, who were arriving from Damascus; he had heard of their reaching Belbeis. [The list of names is here omitted.]\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe remnant of the army came, in the most pitiful state of nakedness, hunger, and weakness, with their garments opened at the neck, and manifested their grief about the Sult\u0101n.\n\nThus the Am\u012brs and the army made their way in. [Another list of names is omitted.]\n\n* * * * *\n\nThursday, the 13th, witnessed the arrival of all the Am\u012brs that were left. After greeting them the Daw\u0101d\u0101r returned\nhome, and with them came Am\u012br K\u0101n\u015f\u016bh al-Ashrafi, who was in charge of the fortress at Aleppo. He it was who surrendered it with all it contained (see p. 48), although the citadel of Aleppo was strongly fortified. Therefore, when the Daw\u0101d\u0101r confronted him he severely reproved him, ordered his imprisonment in the citadel-tower, and threatened him with severe punishment.\n\nNow on the return of the Am\u012brs to Cairo, they were unanimous for the election of T\u016bm\u0101n Bai, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, as Sult\u0101n.\n\nBut he persisted in his refusal; the Am\u012brs replied that there was no one else but him, and that there was no way out of it, whether he wished it or not. Then the Daw\u0101d\u0101r mounted his horse and accompanied by a number of the leading Am\u012brs [list of names omitted] proceeded to Sheikh Ab\u016b Su\u2018\u016bd, who was at Kaum al-J\u0101ri\u1e25. When they were all seated they explained the matter to him\u2014of their desire that the Daw\u0101d\u0101r should be Sult\u0101n and of the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s refusal. Then the Sheikh produced a Kor\u2019\u0101n and made the Am\u012brs swear on it that if they made him Sult\u0101n they would not betray him nor intrigue against him, but would cheerfully accept what he said and did. And they all swore to this. The Sheikh made them also swear that they would not go back to their old oppression of the people, nor proceed against any except as laid down by law; that they would abolish the tyrannical innovations of al-Gh\u016br\u012b, including the impositions on the shops, and carry on affairs as in the day of al-Ashraf K\u0101it Bai, and conduct the Hisbah as did Yeshbek al-Jem\u0101li when he was Censor. Then they swore to all this, and the Sheikh told them that Allah had brought all these disasters and humiliations and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s victory only in response to the curses of the people upon them both on sea and land. To which they replied that they repented before Allah from that day forth for their acts of oppression.\n\nThen the meeting broke up and they left; the Sheikh Ab\u016b Su\u2018\u016bd agreed to appoint the Daw\u0101d\u0101r as Sult\u0101n. The Daw\u0101d\u0101r\naccepted their compact, confirmed by oath in his presence, and became Sult\u0101n.\n\nThe accession of the Daw\u0101d\u0101r to the Sul\u1e6d\u0101nat took place as will be described.\n\n[58] At this point we will return to Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b. [The story of al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s advance against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, his first success and subsequent defeat in the battle of Merj D\u0101bek, of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s death, and the disappearance of his body is here repeated, which have been already told in greater detail in pp. 41\u20134.]\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was extraordinary that al-Gh\u016br\u012b was not buried at the College on which he had spent some 100,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, thinking that he would be buried in a fine tomb, but it was destined to be otherwise, and he lay stretched out on the waste, the prey of wolves and leopards. He died at about the age of 78, having reigned over Egypt and Syria for 15 years 9 months 25 days, every day of which seemed to the people a thousand years.\n\nAs to his appearance, he was tall, bulky, big-bellied, fair-complexioned, round-faced, sleek-eyed, and loud-voiced; with a circular beard scarcely showing any white hair in it. He was looked up to with awe as a king, satisfying the eyes of all beholders with the magnificence of his pageants. Had it not been for his tyranny and exactions, he would have been one of the best of the Circassian Sul\u1e6d\u0101ns; and, indeed, one of the best of all the Sul\u1e6d\u0101ns of Egypt. On Mondays and Thursdays he used to go down to the Royal Enclosures (for game), and on Saturdays and Tuesdays to the Maid\u0101n. He used to go down by Sab\u2018 \u1e24adr\u0101t, preceded by a pair of horses with gold saddles and gold-embroidered saddle-cloths, and he would often make riding expeditions on Bedouin saddles and broad stirrups, and he used to fasten a golden girth round his waist instead of the Ba\u2018lbec waist-band. He used to wear rings of ruby, turquoise, emerald, diamond, and cats\u2019 eyes, and he was addicted to smelling sweet scents, such as musk, aloes,\nand amber. He was fastidious in his dress, fond of flowers, fruit, and other dainties. He probably inclined to the Nes\u012bmiyyeh views from his liking for associating with foreigners. He was fond of planting trees and of gardens, and of listening to singing birds, and of smelling fragrant flowers. He drank out of gold cups, was fond of pleasures, eating and drinking greedily. He was known as K\u0101n\u1e63\u016bh Ibn Bibardi al-Gh\u016br\u012b. He lived constantly in this luxurious way in the kingdom of Egypt, obeyed and feared by all, keeping a tight hold over the Am\u012brs and Naw\u0101bs and the soldiers. He was unthwarted until he and Selim Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, Emperor of Constantinople, quarrelled, and he went out, as I have related, to meet him, and such a tragedy happened as never happened to any other King of Egypt or elsewhere.\n\nI have perused the history of kings,\nAnd have not heard the like of such events;\nTime never ceases to work wonders and strange things amongst men,\nBut such an event has never before happened to Sult\u0101n or ruler.\nAl-Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b was our king.\nBut he practised tyranny and calumny amongst us,\nDeath rendered inevitable his defeat with his army,\nThat was written in the Divine Decrees;\nHis deeds have recoiled on himself,\nAnd time has brought the retribution of Fate.\n\nAmongst the Sult\u0101n\u2019s virtues it may be said that he was good-natured, controlled his temper, and considering his strong passions was not over-violent. He had a great belief in the dervishes and the pious, was a good judge of a man\u2019s capacities, and was not vituperative in fits of anger.\n\nHe understood poetry, and was fond of instrumental music and singing. He was not excitable. He was very fond of reading history and travels, and collections of poetry. He was affable, liking joking and jesting in his company; though rough-looking he was amiable and civil by nature\u2014contrary\nto the Turkish character. He had no haughtiness or self-glorification in him, nor the extreme effrontery shown by former kings in their doings.\n\nWhen Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn was hanged, the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n appointed Mu\u02bfallim Ya\u02bf\u1e33\u016bb, the Jew, to the Treasury. The latter acted as Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn had done. He considered himself entitled to do as he liked with the property of individual Mu\u1e25ammedans. In a single night the good silver ni\u1e63f turned into mere red copper. Adulteration of the coinage went on all through the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n\u2019s reign, up to his death. There is an axiom in the sacred tradition: \u201cHe who deceives us is not of us.\u201d\n\nAmongst the evil practices he used to appoint the inspectors and Arab Sheikhs over fief-lands and pious foundations, and these would take many times their due. From this period the affairs of the country steadily deteriorated. Damascus and Aleppo also declined; he used to make them liable for large sums every year, and they in turn would wring the money from their peasant subjects. So the owners of fiefs and settlements were anxious to leave their country for another, such was the oppression they suffered from their governors, more especially the Arabs of Jebel N\u0101bulus, on account of the contributions that had been laid upon them for the infantry at the time of the expedition. The result was anything but good to the Syrian population.\n\n\u1e24usein, Deputy of Jeddah, used to lay a tax of ten per cent on the goods of Indian merchants, so they gave up coming into the port of Jeddah, and its prosperity declined. There was a scarcity of cotton-stuffs in Egypt, and also of goods imported from Europe, of rice and of leather; the ports of Alexandria and Damietta similarly declined; European merchants refusing to enter them owing to the extortions practised there. He placed an impost on the sale of corn, three ni\u1e63fs being taken on every ardebb from the seller and buyer, and an equal amount on melons and pomegranates.\n\nHe even put an embargo on salt. He renewed many taxes of such a kind as were not even imposed by Huniades in his\ntime. No important trader escaped this system of extortion. He laid contributions on the Am\u012br of the Faithful al-Mu\u02bemin\u012bn al-Mustemsik Bi\u02bell\u0101h Ya\u02bfk\u016bb, and took a considerable sum of money from him. He incurred many debts, which led to his devising these schemes so as to pay the sum demanded of him. Many Am\u012brs died under his persecution, and several officials were imprisoned until death.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAmongst other wicked acts of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s was the expulsion of the Aul\u0101d al-N\u0101s from their lands and employments without due cause, putting imported Memlooks in their places. He suspended the payments to infirm people, orphans of both sexes, and children, which caused them grievous privations. He removed the marble which was in the court of Y\u016bsuf, Inspector of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s private domains, known as the Ni\u1e63f al-Duny\u0101, and put it in the Court of the Baisariyyeh in the citadel. He deprived the people of what they had been in the habit of receiving from the privy purse from time immemorial. He re-established the system of taxing the fief-holders before the rise of the Nile and the sowing of the land, subjecting them to insults and reducing them to misery. His avarice increased to such an extent that he wrung from the small cultivators a share of the profits they made from the cow-dung collected out of the gutters in the Maid\u0101n, making them pay it into the imperial coffers. Every functionary and employ\u00e9 suffered hardship from his daily extortions.\n\nAfter the death of Am\u012br Kh\u0101\u02beir Bey, the treasurer, the Sult\u0101n took to managing the Treasury himself. He used to spend some of the large sums of money he obtained, on buildings [61]which were of no benefit to his subjects, on the decoration of walls, and the gilding of ceilings. This was a sheer waste of the public money. He would run away from trials at law, as a child runs away from school. None of the trials with which he was concerned were conducted in a decent fashion, but under repulsive conditions. He used to pay no attention to cases of murder, but would hand them over to the sacred\ntribunal, and the rights of the people in this respect were disregarded.\n\nHe was very negligent about signing edicts, few, in fact, received his signature, and business suffered in consequence. This led to the purchase of old stamps for an Ashrafi, that they might be affixed to edicts for the transaction of business. To describe all his faults in detail would occupy far too much space.\n\n[Then follow the names of the Khal\u012bfah and the Judges, the secretaries, etc., here omitted.]\n\n* * * * *\n\n[62] Among the buildings which the Sult\u0101n erected in Cairo the following may be mentioned:\n\nThe Mosque and the College, which he built at Shar\u0101bishiyyin (i.e. the market of the makers of robes of honour, etc.), the depot, stores, and quarters behind the college, near the dye-works, and the double-pinnacled minaret which he added to the Mosque al-Azhar. He also built the quarters there, and the shops in the markets behind the Mosque, and the dwelling-places at Kh\u0101n al-Khal\u012bl\u012b. He restored the building of Kh\u0101n al-Khal\u012bl\u012b, and erected stores and shops there. He built two dwelling-houses and two shops at B\u0101b al-Kantarah, and two dwelling-houses between the two walls and the mill near the dye-works. He also built and highly decorated a house for his son at Bundu\u1e33\u0101niyyin, and erected a dwelling-quarter and an inn there. He made the Maid\u0101n below the citadel, and planted trees there brought from Syria, and arranged a supply of water by channels from the Nile. On this spot he constructed the belvederes and lake, the hall of justice, and the night-shelter. He also built a Mosque behind the Maid\u0101n and the Arab quarter, with a pulpit and a minaret. He restored the citadel building, including the Dah\u012bshah and Baisariyyeh Hall, and the Hall of Columns, and the Hall of the Fish-pond (?). He built the Coptic resting-place at al-Housh, and restored the kitchen at the citadel and the Fountain of the Faithful, giving a vaulted roof of masonry.\nHe also built the quarters and stores at the little market of 'Abd al-Mun'im, the quarters and the depot at the great bridge, and restored the buildings at Maid\u0101n Mah\u0101rah, near the Kan\u0101\u1e6dir al-Siba', building it of the famous bezil-stone, it being formerly of brick. He also constructed an aqueduct, bringing the water from the Derb al-Khaul\u012b to the Mauridat al-Half\u0101, restored the Nilometer, and at the same place he built the palace and the seats overlooking the river. He restored the Kantarah Ben\u012b W\u0101'il, the Kantarah Jedidah, the Kantarah al-H\u0101jib, and the Kantarah al-Kharn\u016bb\u012b, making them high enough for ships to pass through. He also restored the bridge of lions. He built the Ma\u1e63\u1e6dabahs (seats?), and placed over them the pillars near the cupola of Am\u012br Yeshbek at Ma\u1e6dariyyeh. He erected on the shore of the Salt Lake a handsome citadel with towers, and a mosque with a pulpit; and he built on to the fortress at Rash\u012bd a wall and watch-towers to protect it. He restored the towers at Alexandria, repaired the Ak\u0101bah road and the stone circle\u00b9 and built a caravanserai there, with towers at the gate. [63] He also made storehouses there for the property of the pilgrims. He built a caravanserai in Azlem, with warehouses in it, like the one in Ak\u0101bah. He also dug wells in various watering-places of the pilgrims.\n\nAt Mecca he built a college with a hostel for the students and hermits there; he also renewed the water-supply at B\u0101z\u0101n, which had been cut off for some years. At Jeddah he erected a sea-wall with several towers, to protect the port against the Franks; this wall was one of the best buildings there. Many other good buildings which were of service to the Mu\u1e25ammedans were erected under his auspices.\n\nTo sum up, it may be said that the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b was the best of the Circassian Sul\u1e6d\u0101ns, notwithstanding some crooked\n\n\u00b9 These \"consist of huge stone circles, some of them measuring 100 feet in diameter, having a cist in the centre covered with a heap of large boulders. These are nearly identical in construction with the Druidical circles of Britain\" (Palmer's Desert of the Exodus, pt. i, p. 140, Cambridge, 1871).\nways. No succeeding king acted like him, or possessed his soaring ambition and determination. He had the qualifications of an emperor, and was a striking figure in royal pageants. And there is no harm in quoting this \"zajal\" composed by Sheikh Bedr al-D\u012bn, may God preserve him, in lamentation over al-Malik, al-Ashraf, Kan\u015fuh al-Gh\u016br\u012b on the occasion of the revolution aforementioned and what befell him.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[64] The sun of the empire of al-Gh\u016br\u012b has set,\nAnd the star of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n has risen.\nThis is the decree of the Lord of Heaven,\nAnd the world turns round for ever.\nIbn \u2018Othm\u0101n showed open hostility to him by taking the citadel,\nAnd by preventing both the merchants and slave-dealers from bringing Memlooks into Egypt,\nOr furs or sables, squirrels and foxes.\nWe have no more woollen clothes; oh, the years we have waited for wool!\nBut no merchant brings any.\nThe Am\u012brs came to the king and said:\n\u201cIbn \u2018Othm\u0101n is rebelling against you.\u201d\nThe great Am\u012br was called S\u016bd\u016bn,\nHe bore the unusual surname of al-\u2018Ajem\u012b;\nAnd the exalted Ma\u1e33arr Ashrafi the Am\u012br of Arms, named Erkm\u0101s,\nAnd the chief of the guards named S\u016bd\u016bn,\nHe is as much trained as the other races.\nAnas Bai was the chief chamberlain, brave in battle, a fine swordsman;\nMu\u1e25ammed, called Chief Master of the Horse, was a son of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n,\nMost noble, valued, victorious;\nThe Sub-Daw\u0101d\u0101r was Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n; and if you would hear of the Chief Am\u012brs,\nThey were: Ibn Chirkess, a great leader, and Tamr, known as the Armourer;\nJ\u0101n Bal\u0101\u1e6d and Kurt Bai, some forty others, and more,\nBands heralding victory, mounted men in large number, and 'Asharaw\u0101ts of Turks.\n\nThese all held council together, and said:\n\n\"Our hearts and spirits are weary, but we are all going out to battle,\nWith led horses, arms, and accoutrements;\nWe unsheathe the sword to win victory for the Sult\u0101n,\nWe shall defeat the Turk and tread down his country.\"\n\nLike gamblers they wagered their lives, each one casting with it,\nNot knowing what all-conquering fate has in store for him.\n\nThe 15th of Rebi\u2018 al-\u0100khir, 922 (dated from the Flight of the Guide and Intercessor for mankind\n\nOn the Resurrection Day) was the date of the Sult\u0101n's departure\n\nOn the expedition against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, intent on conquering the dominion of Syria.\n\n[65] The Am\u012brs were arrayed in his service,\nVying with one another in the splendour of their retinue,\nWith their splendid Memlooks and battalions.\n\nThe departure from Cairo was under the decree of the Almighty;\nThe Sult\u0101n was accompanied by his chosen secretary, K\u0101d\u012b Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, in a litter\nWith the chief judges and their deputies, each doing his best,\nAnd the Khalifah, al-Mutewekkil, son of Ya\u2019k\u016bb Mu\u1e25ammed,\nWhose good deeds are commended;\nWith him also went his Chief Minister, with a view to the robes of honour,\nThe mouthpiece of his yea and nay;\n\nAl-Ka\u1e63r\u0101w\u012b was his chief executive officer and Commander-in-chief of his army.\n\nThey entered Syria with a cavalcade the like of which had never before been heard of nor seen;\nNor king, nor Sult\u0101n, nor any other had been attended by such a concourse.\n\nFrom Damascus, Aleppo was entered, and its rugged and smooth places traversed.\nSelim Sh\u0101h, hearing thereof, showed that his nature was struck with amazement.\nHe sued for peace, sending an envoy with gifts and costly garments.\nThey said: \"Peace is in the hands of the Lord of Decrees,\nWhosoever opposeth him turneth right guidance into error;\nMan is the bearer of the trust committed to him,\nThe lofty mountains refuse to carry it.\"\nOur Lord ordained the sparing of blood,\nAnd saved the believers the trouble of fighting.\nThe spies of al-Ashraf al-Gh\u016br\u012b returned;\nThey informed him of a plot against him.\nThey said: \"Beware of trusting to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s peace,\nAnd know that he is treacherous towards you.\"\nHe believed their words, and started for Aleppo with his hosts\nfor battle;\nHe found the Turks [R\u016bm] fully armed, and the quivers\nequipped with arrows.\nSuch a struggle took place between the armies as would have\nturned the hair of children white to hear of;\nAllah gave the Egyptians victory over the Turks.\nTheir cavalry was seen at noon bearing down upon them.\nMan knows not what is laid up for him,\nNor towards what destiny he is moving;\nIbn \u2018Othm\u0101n had troops lying in ambush on his left,\nWhilst our men were busy plundering the Turks,\nThey attacked on our right flank, and the Sult\u0101n gave a cry\nfor help.\nAnd there were robbers by him.\nHe was thrown from his horse, and lay moaning;\nHis cousin B\u012bbars and Ak Ba\u012b \u1e6cawil hurried up to his aid,\nBut courage cannot avail against numbers;\nThey cut them up with the sharp sword.\nGlory to the Lord of all movement!\nAll\u0101h makes a cause for the death of each.\nAl-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s defeat was a great surprise, written in history with\nletters of gold.\nWhat happened to him took place on the 2nd of Rejeb of the\nyear A.H. 922.\n\n[66] I ask God to brighten the future, and that He should\nmake the gainer into the loser once more;\nThat it may please him to remove shame from us by giving\nrevenge,\nBy bringing defeat on the head of the infidel;\nI desire revenge for the death of al-Gh\u016br\u012b, maybe I shall attain my wishes;\nJoy will be mine on that day, and they will sing to the string or the Tar;\nThen I shall not fear the bird of ill-omen, if it croaks in our house or flies over it.\nAl-Gh\u016br\u012b's end was a strange thing, he went stalking with his foot to his death;\nWe had taken all things into account, but that which befell him did not cross our minds.\nI weep for al-Gh\u016br\u012b, a well of blood flows for my grief;\nI long for eyes from the people [to help in my weeping];\nFrom early morning till the sun set.\nDuring the time of his reign happiness kept watch over him till the evil eye struck him;\nThe steed disappeared amongst the enemy, it threw him, he died, tears flowing from his eyes.\nAll who were jealous for him were glad when he had set out against the raider.\nI have likened this army to a garden,\nIn which the flowers on the branches are the horsemen,\nThe skirt on the coat of mail is the zephyr on the river,\nAnd lo, he [=Gh\u016br\u012b] appears like a drawn sword.\nThe vestment over the armour was as a full-blown red rose amongst gardens;\nThe bunting was like gilt branches of willow guarded by sword-poles [i.e. swords in lieu of poles];\nThe wounded bodies were like the jasmine, encircled by red poppies.\nIn the sky of the battle appeared horsemen like stars adorning their uniform;\nThe spear-points were like shooting-stars, and their helmets like stars on suns.\nThe Sult\u0101n was like the eclipsed moon amongst them, their strokes on the shields were like thunder.\nMethought arrows were being launched from the rainbow at the armies in a dust-storm like night;\nThe sky raining penetrating darts on the enemy and incessant rain.\nThese soldiers were like garden-fruits, their blood the spilt juice of the grape;\nThis one yellow as the colour of the apricot, another like the colour of the Jujube, another like that of a helmet.\nNo one has ever seen such an engagement as this one;\nDo not speak to me of N\u0101\u1e63ir, nor of Bark\u016bk.\nThe Am\u012brs resemble fruitful trees in the gardens, diffusing the most exquisite perfume;\nThe guns hurled large quinces, or pomegranates, and remind one (?) of the proud stallions (?).\nHow much do I try to console my heart, and say to it, \"Heart, reflect,\"\nWhere is Suleim\u0101n, where Nimrod, where Pharaoh, and where C\u00e6sar?\n[67] Where are the kings of other times, and he with the two horns, called Alexander?\nWhere Chosroes Naushirw\u0101n and his pavilion?\nHe is dead, and his palace (i.e. at Ctesiphon) remains deserted;\nEverything passes on by the decree of the Ancient of Days,\nIt is only the first and last who abides.\nWere but a porter of this town to bet on a game, and lose,\nWe of his kindred would be sorry for his defeat;\nWhat, then, say you to the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b, being stripped and killed and dying in distress?\nFifteen years nine months and twenty-five days it was exactly from the beginning of his reign.\nA marvel there was in the death of Gh\u016br\u012b, nothing fated can be averted by caution;\nThe day he rode out with the cavalcade he knew not what was written on his forehead;\nThe tongue of circumstance told him that there remained of his life three months.\nAwake from the sleep of carelessness, shorten the length of hope;\nNine days of the month must pass, and on the tenth comes thy destiny.\nThe Sul\u1e6d\u0101n was a chief courageous, the rear of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s army seemed to be wrecked;\nThe wind blew and loosened his boat, Ibn 'Othni\u0101n was floated off, and his victory was manifest;\nThe ships were sunk, and the sailors, with his sword he drove them all into the sea.\nTheir bodies and their blood made their sea into a land crowded with corpses;\nAnd when he sailed away their land was as a sea flowing with blood.\nThe Creator, our Lord, the Lord of Glory, had unveiled for him the bride of the beauty of his kingdom,\nBut hid from him that he would fall dead from his horse on the day of battle;\nIt was concealed from him that he would die defeated,\nAnd that his place of burial would never be known.\nHow many an augury he drew from the sand and the saint-augurs, God's augury is the most potent;\nSo all that he was depending on blew away, and this no bird had ever revealed to him.\nI begin and end my verse by praising the Chosen One;\nThe lizard and the shoulder of mutton and the camel spoke to him;\u00b9\nThe trees hastened to his service, and the gazelle, whose tradition is well known;\nThe stones in the palm of his hand spake to him;\nThe moon was slit in two for him, after it had reached its full size and brightness;\nHe satisfied his army with (a little ?) food, and the water flowed gushing from his finger.\nIf they say Ab\u016b al-Nej\u0101 al-'Auf\u012b is unequalled in the city for his poetry,\n[68] O thou who comest to hear the pearls of his verses,\nTake and write down the wonders of his chronicle;\n\n\u00b9 For these miracles vide Ab\u016b Nu'aim, \"Del\u0101'il Al-Nub\u016bwwah\" \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23. A Jewess named Zainab attempted to poison the Prophet at Khaibar by dressing a kid, and having steeped it in deadly poison placed it before the Prophet, who ate but a mouthful when the deed was discovered. Zainab was immediately put to death (Hughes' Dictionary of Islam).\nIf one comes to you demanding the time and the story of the Kings,\nTell him that the Sun of al-Gh\u016br\u012b has set, and the Sun of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n has risen.\nThis was the decree of the God of Heaven, and the world goes round for ever.\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE REIGN OF ASHRAF ABU AL-NA\u1e62R T\u016aM\u0100N BAI\n\nThis Sult\u0101n was the 47th of the Turkish Kings and their sons in Egypt, and the 21st of the Circassian Kings and their sons. He was originally one of the slaves of Ashraf K\u0101it Bai, having been purchased by the Sult\u0101n K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b, whose protection he sought on grounds of relationship. After purchasing him the Sult\u0101n presented him to K\u0101it Bai, for which reason he was called T\u016bm\u0101n Bai \u201cMin\u201d \u00b9 K\u0101ns\u016bh. He became one of his Kitabi Memlooks,\u00b2 and retained this position until the accession of Malik N\u0101\u1e63ir Mu\u1e25ammed Ibn K\u0101it Bai, who gave him horses, uniform, and slave boys, and he became one of the persons promoted by al-N\u0101\u1e63ir. For some time he was a page in waiting, then one of the personal suite, remaining in this position until the accession of his kinsman K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Gh\u016br\u012b. This latter conferred on him the rank of a Decurion, which he retained until the year A.H. 910; then when the Sult\u0101n\u2019s son died the Sult\u0101n gave him the Emirate of the \u1e6cablkh\u0101n\u0101h, and made him keeper of the cellars in the place of his deceased son.\n\nIn this post he remained until the year A.H. 913, but when the Am\u012br Azdamar Ibn \u2018Al\u012b Bai, Chie Dfaw\u0101d\u0101r, died, in the month Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u016al\u0101, whilst travelling in Jebel N\u0101bulus, the Sult\u0101n gave him a robe of honour, and made him Chief Daw\u0101d\u0101r instead of the deceased Am\u012br. He kept this office\n\n\u00b9 For use of \u201cMin\u201d see Sobernheim\u2019s article on J\u0101nbal\u0101t in Encyclopaedia of Islam.\n\u00b2 From ii, 92, it appears that these were Memlooks who were on a register.\nuntil the Sultan left on his expedition against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, when he was made Viceroy during the Sultan\u2019s absence [69]. He conducted the government during this time extremely well; the people were contented and the troops left behind in Egypt obeyed him. He combined the offices of Chief Daw\u0101d\u0101r, Lord High Chamberlain, Chief Inspector, and Viceroy. He used to ride out towards the Ma\u1e6dariyyeh every Monday and Thursday, passing through Cairo after entering it by the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r. He was preceded by a strong force of soldiers and chief Am\u012brs, by runners and slaves who fired naptha from instruments, and there was great commotion in Cairo as he passed through. He also opened the dam in the Sultan\u2019s absence, which occasion was observed as a public holiday.\n\n[Here follows the story already told on p. 57 of the choice of T\u016bm\u0101n Bai to be Sultan and his refusal, and of the Am\u012brs referring the matter to Sheikh Ab\u016b Su\u2018\u016bd.]\n\nT\u016bm\u0101n Bai pleaded a variety of excuses\u2014that there was no money in the Treasury, so he could not spend anything on the Army; that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was master of Syria and was advancing on Egypt, while the Am\u012brs would not consent to go upon a second expedition. He also said that if he became Sultan they would betray and depose him, and imprison him in the frontier town at Alexandria, and only retain him on the throne for a short time. Then followed the administering of an oath of fidelity to the Am\u012brs, and the acceptance of the sovereignty by T\u016bm\u0101n Bai. On Friday, the 14th of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n of this year, after saying the early morning prayers, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, accompanied by the chief Am\u012brs, and preceded by men carrying lamps and torches, rode up to the B\u0101b al-Silsilah and took up a position there. He had started from his house in the B\u0101b\u0101sha\u1e33 road by the \u1e62al\u012bbah Gate, wearing a light turban and a white cape\u2014the Am\u012brs accompanying him being similarly dressed\u2014and being greeted as he passed by voices praying for blessings on him, and by cheers from the women at their windows. On arrival at the B\u0101b al-Silsilah he sent for the Am\u012br of the Faithful\nYa\u02bfk\u016bb, father of the Am\u012br of the Faithful al-Mutewekkil \u02bfal\u0101 All\u0101h. The Am\u012br attended at the summons, accompanied by Seyyid H\u0101r\u016bn, son of the Khal\u012bfah Mu\u1e25ammed al-Mutewekkil \u02bfal\u0101 All\u0101h, and their cousins the children of Khal\u012bl.\n\nOthers attended with a number of Deputy Judges from Cairo. [Names omitted.]\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen all were assembled, including the chief Am\u012brs and others of high or low rank, and the troops, Am\u012br of the Faithful Ya\u02bfk\u016bb produced an authority from his son Mu\u1e25ammed al-Mutewekkil to represent him, with full powers in all matters concerning either himself or the Khalifate. He had sent confirmation of this by the hand of K\u0101d\u012b Shems al-D\u012bn Ibn Wah\u012bsh. This was accepted as correct. It had been rumoured that the Khalifate would be conferred on one of the sons of Seyyid Khal\u012bl, since the Khal\u012bfah al-Mutewekkil \u02bfal\u0101 All\u0101h was a prisoner in the hands of Ibn \u02bfOthm\u0101n, and his father Ya\u02bfk\u016bb had abdicated the Khalifate, but when this document was produced bearing the authority of his son the people were satisfied.\n\nOthers also, being prisoners in the hands of Ibn \u02bfOthm\u0101n, were not present at the ceremony of swearing allegiance. [Names omitted.]\n\n* * * * *\n\nNone of the distinguished Sh\u0101fi\u02bfi deputies were present at this ceremony except Sheref\u012b Yahy\u0101 Ibn Burd\u012bn\u012b.\n\nThe oath was administered to the Sult\u0101n by the Khal\u012bfah Am\u012br al-Mu\u02bemin\u012bn Ya\u02bfk\u016bb, and witnessed by Sheref\u012b Yahy\u0101 Ibn Burd\u012bn\u012b, and a number of deputy judges representing Mu\u1e25ammed al-Mutewekkil, the chief \u1e24anef\u012b Judge Mu\u1e25ammed Ibn Shal\u012bna also attended at the close of the ceremony.\n\nAs soon as the oath had been taken the royal insignia were brought to the Sult\u0101n, that is to say, the black cloak, the black turban, and the Bedawi sword. The rites of investiture were completely performed; he assumed the title of al-Malik al-Ashraf like his kinsman al-Gh\u016br\u012b. Then his\nspecial charger was brought up without either horse-cloth or gilt saddle, nor could they find for him in the armouries either parasol or bird, or gold drapery.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n rode from the \u1e24arr\u0101kah steps at the Silsilah Gate, preceded by the Khal\u012bfah, and went into the Great Palace by the private gate, and there took his seat on the imperial throne. Then the Am\u012brs kissed the ground before him, and the glad tidings were sounded from the citadel. His name was proclaimed in Cairo, voices were raised in prayer for him, and there was no one who was not glad at his accession. Being gentle, he was beloved by the people, and being free from pride he desired harm to no man. After the oath-taking the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on the Am\u012br al-Mu\u02bemin\u012bn, and went down to his palace in the midst of a grand procession.\n\nThus ended the reign of al-Gh\u016br\u012b. Praise be to Him whose kingdom never wanes; and to quote the words of Mu\u1e25ammed Ibn K\u0101ns\u016bh: \u201cAl-Gh\u016br\u012b has gone to his Lord in obedience to the decree of All\u0101h, to whom kingdoms belong, and to the sovereignty of which he appoints of his servants whom he wills.\u201d\n\nAt prayer-time on that Friday the Sult\u0101n (\u1e6c\u016bm\u0101n Bai) went out to prayers, and his name was mentioned in the sermon by Sheref\u012b Yal\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn Burd\u012bn\u012b, and likewise on succeeding Fridays. Moreover, the preachers made reference to the Sult\u0101n in their sermons on that day from the pulpits in the mosques in Cairo; for the previous fifty days no Sult\u0101n\u2019s name had been thus mentioned, nor prayers offered for him, but only for the Khal\u012bfah.\n\nOn this day the Sult\u0101n arrested K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Ashraf\u012b, Governor of the Citadel of Aleppo, who had surrendered without resistance to Ibn Othm\u0101n. So when this K\u0101ns\u016bh attended under escort the Sult\u0101n expressed his displeasure, and ordered his confinement in the Citadel Tower, until his wishes concerning him should be made known.\n\nOn Saturday, the 15th of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, there arrived a number\nof Am\u012brs, who had remained behind at Damascus after the troops had left. Amongst these were (1) Am\u012br J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Governor of \u1e24am\u0101h; he had aspired to the governorship of Damascus; (2) Am\u012br S\u016bd\u016bn Daw\u0101d\u0101r, [71] Chief of the Corps of Guards; (3) Am\u012br Kan\u1e63\u016bh Kurt, one of the chief Am\u012brs, who arrived sick. On their arrival they found that the Daw\u0101d\u0101r [T\u016bm\u0101n Bai] had succeeded to the throne. This gave offence to Am\u012br S\u016bd\u016bn, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, who, whilst he was absent in Syria, had been counting on becoming Sul\u1e6d\u0101n himself. His wish, however, was not realized.\n\nOn their arrival they went up to the citadel, made their obeisance to the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, and then went to their homes.\n\nThen came news from the Am\u012br of the Arabs of \u1e24am\u0101h, Am\u012br N\u0101\u1e63ir al-D\u012bn Ibn al-\u1e24anash, that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had sent a detachment under Ibn Suw\u0101r, who had declared his allegiance to him. At K\u0101b\u016bn, near Damascus, they were met by Ibn \u1e24anash, and a bloody battle ensued, in which a number of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s men were killed. The rivers of Damascus were let loose against them, their horses stuck fast in the mud, and a great number of them perished in this way, as told by the reports received. Then I wrote:\n\nTell Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, if you meet him, to take advice,\nNot to be rash and to beware,\nLest he withstand a Syrian without due forethought,\nAnd run against the sting of Ibn \u1e24anash.\n\nAlong with the Am\u012brs many of the notables of Damascus came with their families, for after the defeat of the army and the death of S\u012b Bai, the Governor, confusion reigned there. Some of the people of the city attacked the others, plundering the brokers\u2019 quarter, killing a number of persons, and taking their property. The Frank merchants were similarly treated, and terrible riots prevailed. The judges and leading native merchants of Damascus had their houses pillaged, and this and the troubles caused by Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and the general\nruin of affairs in Egypt and Syria led to the quitting of the city by the majority of them.\n\nWhen the Sultan learnt of the success of Nasir al-Din Ibn Hanash against the troops of Ibn Othman, he appointed him Governor of Homs. It was said that imperial instructions were sent to him to the effect that if he could defeat Ibn Othman\u2019s army the Sultan would make him Atabek of Damascus; and that Ibn al-Hanash replied that if the Sultan would assist him with troops, he would collect a force of Arabs and personally guarantee the defeat of Ibn Othman\u2019s army. One of al-Hanash\u2019s ancestors was formerly Governor of Homs.\n\nOn the same day a person named Inal, the squint-eyed, arrived. He had been appointed Deputy of Safad by Jan Birdi al-Ghazali. On sending his Dawadar and executive officials to Safad they were attacked by the inhabitants, and not allowed to enter the town, and some, it appears, were killed. So he went to Egypt to be invested, meaning to return and take revenge on the people of Safad.\n\nOn Monday, the 17th, the Sultan paid the troops in his private grounds. On the same day there arose a dispute among the Amirs as to their various offices; there was also a quarrel between Amir Allan, the Sub-Dawadar and Jan Birdi al-Ghazali, in which both parties overstepped the bounds of moderation. Then the Sultan gave orders for the inspection of the troops who had not taken part in the expedition, but remained behind in Egypt. He also proclaimed that any one who had taken possession of arms or clothing belonging to the troops was to restore them at once, under penalty, if denounced, of immediate death by hanging. Information had reached him that a number of servants and slaves on the expedition had stolen many things in the shape of money, arms, uniforms, etc.\n\nAmongst matters of less consequence it may be mentioned that the Sultan, on his accession, ordered the stone seat to be pulled down which al-Ghuri had put up in his private\ngrounds, in place of the dais\\(^1\\) which Ashraf K\u0101it Bai used to sit on; so the stone seat was replaced by the dais once more, and the Sult\u0101n used it. It had been broken, but he had it repaired, and made a yellow cloth covering for it. He used it as a judgment seat for hearing trials, like Ashraf K\u0101it Bai, and I said:\n\nThe Dais of Justice has come back,\nThe \"Mastabah\" of Injustice has been pulled down;\nT\u016bm\u0101n Bai has become amongst the people\nAs one who causes the wolf to live with the sheep in peace.\nOh! what a King he is! his justice has become notorious\nAmongst Arabs, and people of other countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 18th, the Sult\u0101n sat on the dais and reviewed the troops in his private grounds, and enrolled about two thousand Memlooks, and gave appointments to some six chief Am\u012brs who were in Cairo. He gave the command of the troops to Am\u012br J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who had aspired to be Governor of Damascus. On the same day the Sult\u0101n arrested the Miht\u0101r Mu\u1e25ammed Fuj\u016bl\u012b and his brother \u2018Ali, Superintendent of the Wardrobe in the service of the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b. He also arrested Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Alw\u0101l\u012b, Guardian at Dahishah. This was the Sult\u0101n T\u016bm\u0101n Bai\u2019s first judgment, given for the following reason. When he came to the throne he inspected the treasuries and found them empty, with neither a din\u0101r nor a dirhem in them. The Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b had, on the death of Am\u012br Kh\u0101ir Bey, appointed these two, Mu\u1e25ammed the Superintendent and Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn the Guardian, as financial advisers, and they did as they pleased with the money. They became insolent and interfered in affairs which were out of their province, never thinking that the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b would die when he did; and it was this belief of theirs that was one of the chief causes of their ruin. Some one rightly said: \u201cThese are things to make fools laugh, and the wise to weep at their consequences.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) Platform, high wooden sofa.\nOn Thursday, the 20th, the Sult\u0101n held a grand full dress court, he himself being seated on the dais in his private grounds, and conferred robes of honour on about twenty Am\u012brs [names omitted].\n\n* * * * *\n\n[73] On Tuesday, the 25th, the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on the Sheikh of the Arabs, Am\u012br A\u1e25med Ibn Bakar, and confirmed him in his appointment. The tribe of the Am\u012br had committed excesses during this year, such as do not occur at the hands of the Franks, murdering people and plundering property. Notable outrages were committed by Ibn al-Judh\u0101m\u012b on the troops returning after their defeat, and by the tribe of \u2018Abd al-D\u0101\u2019im in the east of the country, in the shape of plunder and murder, and no one troubled himself about it. However, a robe of honour was conferred on the Sheikh, and no more was heard of these doings.\n\nOn Thursday, the 27th, the Sult\u0101n gave robes of honour to several Am\u012brs [names omitted].\n\n* * * * *\n\n[74] On Saturday, the 29th, the Inspector of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s private domain came up with the festival robes and displayed them to the Sult\u0101n, spread out over the heads of the porters.\n\nOn Sunday, the last day of the month, N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b Mu\u1e25ammed Ibn Bal Bai al-Mu\u2019eyyed from Damascus arrived with the news that Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had taken possession of the city and citadel and had killed \u2018Al\u012b Bai al-Ashraf\u012b, Governor of the citadel, and thirty-six Am\u012brs of Damascus, besides some of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s subjects living there. This Ibn Bal Bai arrived dressed as an Arab, with a native cloak and head-dress.\n\nWhen it became known in Cairo that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was in possession of Damascus the people were terror-stricken, and said that it would be Egypt\u2019s turn next. They were firmly convinced that it would come to this, and some determined to fly to Upper Egypt. Both the Sult\u0101n and the Am\u012brs and all the people were much disturbed at this news, especially as it was the eve of the \u201cFestival of Fi\u1e6dr\u201d, and the\nsorrows of the people were still fresh, owing to the death of the Sult\u0101n, the defeat of the army, and the mourning for the men who had fallen. And I said:\u2014\n\nO Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, desist from taking Egypt,\nThe land which is dignified with the best of Im\u0101ms;\nOur chief Im\u0101m is al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b, a Polestar and a saint,\nThe son of Idr\u012bs, a pillar of Isl\u0101m.\nShe is called the Quiver, and whoever attacks her\u2014\nGod will break his back with a sword.\n\nOn Monday, the first day of Shaww\u0101l, the Sult\u0101n offered up the festival prayer, and conferred robes of honour on the Am\u012brs and the usual persons. The Sharaf\u012b Yahy\u0101 Ibn al-Burd\u012bn\u012b mentioned the Sult\u0101n\u2019s name in the Khutba, and a grand festival procession took place. On Friday, the 5th, corresponding to the 4th of the Coptic month \u201cH\u0101t\u016br\u201d, the Sult\u0101n exchanged his linen clothes for woollen; he did this too hastily.\n\nOn this day Am\u012br J\u0101nem al-Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u012b, one of the Am\u012brs of the Tablkh\u0101n\u0101h, died.\n\nOn Saturday, the 6th, two persons named \u2018Al\u012b Sha\u2018b\u0101n\u012b, the deputy of the Muhtesib, and Ibn Khab\u012bz, the corn-broker, came to the Sult\u0101n and pointed out to him that if he were to impose a fixed rate on the market dues and on the crops it would be no hardship to the Faithful. But the Sult\u0101n would not hear them, and flogged them both. He publicly exposed Sha\u2018b\u0101n\u012b in Cairo, causing him to walk bareheaded, and to be beaten as he went; whilst a crier proclaimed this to be the punishment for trying to re-establish unjust measures [75] under a just government, after they had been repealed. The Sult\u0101n then ordered Sha\u2018b\u0101n\u012b to be dismissed from the office of adviser about the control of the market, and it was reported that he died from the blows he had received.\n\nOn Monday, the 8th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r deputy of Gaza, known as \u2018Al\u012b Bey, the hunchback, arrived with the news that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had suffered a set-back since his entry into Damascus. Disease was rife amongst his troops, deaths occurring daily.\nHe also said that there was a scarcity of grain and fodder, that the Arabs were endeavouring to stop the supply of barley, wheat, and straw, and that when any of the soldiers went out into the villages they were killed by the Arabs. Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had penetrated so far that he could not withdraw; his cavalry horses were roaming about eating the leaves of trees, and were much emaciated. On the same day Khud\u0101 Bird\u012b, Governor of Alexandria, also arrived; he had gone there to carry out what had been settled; and Am\u012br Kh\u0101ir Bey, the architect, also arrived. He had been to the fortress of Rash\u012bd to see about the repair of the wall and the towers.\n\nOn the same day the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on a Turk named M\u0101l Bai al-Musharref, and appointed him to be personal steward instead of K\u0101ns\u016bh al-Ashraf\u012b, killed in the engagement with Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 9th, a quarrel occurred between al-Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 and Sheikh Ab\u016b al-Su\u2018\u016bd, which arose thus. A certain tanner and dealer in skins named Damr\u0101w\u012b agreed about the sale of some skins; Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 acted wrongfully towards him, and a quarrel was started between them. Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 determined to arrest him. Then Damr\u0101w\u012b went to Sheikh Ab\u016b al-Su\u2018\u016bd and implored his protection. The latter sent an abusive letter to Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 on the subject, which he took no notice of, but kept him waiting about the matter.\n\nThen the Sheikh summoned Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, and on his appearing before him at Kaum al-J\u0101ril\u012b, the Sheikh reproved him sharply, saying: \u201cYou dog, how you do oppress the Faithful!\u201d This infuriated Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, who left his presence in anger. So the Sheikh ordered his head to be uncovered, and that he be beaten with shoes on the head and body till he nearly died. Then after securing him he sent for Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, the Chief Daw\u0101d\u0101r, and said to him, \u201cPut him in irons and go and consult the Sult\u0101n about him, and inform him that the man is injuring the Faithful.\u201d The Sult\u0101n on hearing the case sent to Sheikh Abu Su\u2018\u016bd, telling him to act as he thought fit in the matter. The latter ordered Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 to be publicly\nexposed in Cairo and then hung at the Zawilah Gate. Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 was then brought out from the Sheikh\u2019s quarters at Kaum al-J\u0101r\u012bh, walking bareheaded and in irons. It was publicly proclaimed that this was the punishment of a man who oppressed the Faithful. He was thus escorted to the confines of Old Cairo, till at last they reached Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s, house at N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012byyeh. He desired to sign his death-warrant by hanging or drowning, but the people pointed out to the Sheikh that he owed the Sult\u0101n money, and that if he were hung the Sult\u0101n would forfeit it. So the Sheikh repealed the death-sentence, and Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 remained in irons at Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n\u2019s residence. Thus the affair between Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 and Sheikh Ab\u016b al-Su\u2018\u016bd was attended with grave consequences, which nearly culminated in the execution of the former.\n\n* * * * *\n\n[76] After all this trouble of Ibn M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s an enemy of his named Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Ibn al-\u1e62\u0101\u2019igh appeared upon the scene. He had taken steps against Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 during al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s reign; and when this affair occurred he again brought up a charge. So he said, \u201cI can bear witness to a debt of Ibn M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s to the Sult\u0101n to the extent of 100,000 d\u012bnars.\u201d Then Ibn al-\u1e62\u0101\u2019igh went to Ibn M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s house, accompanied by eunuchs and kavasses and a great many others, and attacked and arrested Ibn M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s women, plundering their house property and laying hands on his slaves, servants, and retainers.\n\nWhen the Sult\u0101n heard this he gave up persecuting Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, who then said that he could bear witness to a debt of 200,000 d\u012bnars against Ibn al-\u1e62\u0101\u2019igh, so the Sult\u0101n told Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n to send for Ibn al-\u1e62\u0101\u2019igh and have him put in irons until he should have settled his accounts. As to Sheikh Ab\u016b al-Su\u2018\u016bd, a storm of indignation arose against him, on account of his treatment of Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, and the poor people and others found fault with him, saying, \u201cWhat business has the Sheikh to interfere in the Sult\u0101n\u2019s affairs.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the 14th, the Princess, who was the daughter\nof Am\u012br Ak\u0331 Bird\u012b, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, and wife of the Sult\u0101n, went up to the citadel; her mother was the daughter of Kh\u0101ss Bey and sister of Ashraf K\u0101it Bai\u2019s wife. She went up at the time of morning prayers, with lanterns and torches, accompanied by a great number of princesses and ladies, and the wives of Am\u012brs and executive officers. They formed a procession until they reached the citadel, where she entered the Hall of Columns. The chief eunuch of the bedchamber staff held over her head the Umbrella and Bird until she took her seat on the throne. This day was observed in her honour, as one of special celebrations at the citadel.\n\nOn Sunday, the Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, paraded Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 and Ibn S\u0101\u2019igh. A sum of 20,000 din\u0101rs had been assessed against Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, of which amount half was to be applied to salaries, but he produced none of it. So the Am\u012br threw him down and beat him about twenty times, after which he promised to produce the amount. Then the Am\u012br summoned Al\u1e25med Ibn al-S\u0101\u2019igh and beat him over four hundred times, from which he nearly died; his death, in fact, was reported amongst the people.\n\nOn Thursday, the 18th, the Mahmal (the Holy Carpet) was not dispatched from Cairo; no one, in fact, made the pilgrimage owing to the disturbance caused by the rebellion of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. It was reported that he was going to send a number of his soldiers to Mecca, with coverings for the Ka\u2018bah, but this was not confirmed. Then the Sult\u0101n sent the eunuch Murhef by sea with the coverings for the Ka\u2018bah, and the purses for the people of Mecca and Medina; so he proceeded to Sinai, and down to the sea from there.\n\nOn Friday, the 19th, it was reported that Sheikh Ab\u016b al-Su\u2018\u016bd had sent and released Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 from irons, and showed that he had pardoned him, and he began to interfere in political matters, and the people disapproved of this.\n\n---\n\n1 Al \u1e32ubbah wa Al \u1e6cair, a term \u201capplied by historians to an umbrella surmounted by the figure of a bird which was borne over the head of a Sultan in certain pompous processions.\u201d (Lane\u2019s Modern Egyptians.)\nSaturday, the 20th, Zeyn\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 went to the Sult\u0101n requesting him to restore him to his office; but the Sult\u0101n paid no heed so he left him without effecting his purpose, and remained under observation until he should have completely satisfied the claims against him. He returned home greatly humiliated, after his quarters in the Milk Market had been illuminated in his honour and his adherents had perfumed themselves with saffron. Consequently they were much discouraged.\n\nOn Sunday, the 21st, the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on Sheref al-D\u012bn Ibn \u2018Iv\u0101d, and appointed him to be controller of the Treasury instead of Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 dismissed from this office.\n\nOn Monday, the 22nd, the Sult\u0101n sent instructions to the troops that on Tuesday the first instalment of pay would be issued. On the same day news came from India\\(^1\\) that the ships which the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b had dispatched had gone down with all guns and arms and other things on board. A quarrel had arisen between the commander, Salm\u0101n al-Othm\u0101n\u012b, and the local governor, al-Am\u012br \u1e24usein of Jeddah, and that each of them had gone to a different part of India.\n\nOn the same day the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on a Turk, Kajm\u0101s, formerly Steward in Benh\u0101 al-\u2018Asel, and appointed him to the Inspectorate of the Sharkiyyeh Province, after cancelling the previous appointment. The Sult\u0101n also issued pay to the troops detailed for active service, giving to each Memlook fifty d\u012bn\u0101rs. This they returned to him, and jabbered and went out of the gate of the grounds in a rage, intending to raise a revolt. But some of the Am\u012brs advised the Sult\u0101n to appease them by paying them a hundred d\u012bn\u0101rs each, as usual. So the angry soldiers were recalled, and on their return the Sult\u0101n paid each Memlook a hundred d\u012bn\u0101rs, and three months\u2019 pay, amounting to one hundred\n\n\\(^1\\) \u201cHind,\u201d according to Moslem geographers, was Southern India, including the Indian Archipelago, with a part of Southern China, and thence across the Indian Ocean to the east coast of Africa.\nand twenty din\u0101rs. On that day he paid the men of four barracks. It was reported that these troops were to march out to Gaza with the Am\u012brs, and to occupy the town until the departure of the great expedition in the spring. At this time the Sult\u0101n sent to arrest a number of Greeks of Kh\u0101n al-Khal\u012bl\u012b, said to be corresponding with Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n about Egyptian affairs, and to have spies with them from him. On arrest he put them in irons. The Sult\u0101n was reported to have summoned the little boy, called K\u0101sim Ibn Al\u1e25med Bey Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, who had accompanied al-Gh\u016br\u012b on the expedition. After the defeat of the army he had returned with the Am\u012brs to Egypt, and having heard of a plot against him the Sult\u0101n had fears for his life, so he brought him up to the citadel and gave him quarters by the reservoir, allowing him and his suite a competence.\n\nAt this time Sheref\u012b Yahy\u0101 Ibn al-At\u0101bek Ezbek Ibn \u1e6ca\u1e6dakh arrived in Cairo. He had been living at \u1e24am\u0101h, [78] but fled thence when the place was captured by Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and came to Egypt by sea from Tripoli.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on Am\u012br Ta\u1e33\u1e6d Bai, Chief Chamberlain, and appointed him as adviser in the Inspectorate of Bu\u1e25airah instead of Y\u016bsuf al-Bedr\u012b, in addition to the duties of his office.\n\nOn Friday, the 26th, K\u0101\u1e0di \u2018Abd al-Ker\u012bm Ibn al-Ji\u2018\u0101n, brother of Shih\u0101b\u012b Al\u1e25med Ibn al-Ji\u2018\u0101n, arrived in Cairo. He had been a prisoner with Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n in Syria, but escaped into Egypt disguised as a camel-driver, wearing an Arab cloak and a skull-cap. He was accompanied by Al\u1e25med al-Dimy\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, a merchant in al-Warr\u0101k\u012bn. He informed the Sult\u0101n that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s power had waned, that his troops were at variance with him, that his communications had been cut by N\u0101\u1e63ir al-D\u012bn Ibn al-Hanash, and that the Arabs were killing isolated soldiers in the villages. He also told that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had taken possession of the town of Damascus and its citadel, and the citadel of Tripoli and \u015eafad and their provinces, and was master of the country from\nDamascus to the Euphrates. A number of his Am\u012brs had been made governors in the towns he had captured, as in Aleppo, \u1e24am\u0101h, \u1e24om\u1e63, and other towns. It was said that Ibn al-\u1e24anash had sent an official communication to the Sult\u0101n to urge him to dispatch an expedition quickly, before Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had time to advance on Gaza. Then the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on K\u0101\u1e0d\u012b \u2018Abd al-Ker\u012bm, and went down to his house.\n\nOn Monday, the 29th, the Sult\u0101n gave a robe of honour to the son of the successor of Seyyid Al\u1e25med al-Bedaw\u012b, who had been killed by Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n in Aleppo, and appointed him in his father\u2019s stead. The newly appointed successor left the citadel with a great procession with banners held above him, and preceded by all the Almadiyyeh dervishes.\n\nAfter the conferring of the appointments they went down to the citadel, wearing their badges of honour, and were received with loud acclamations by the people of Cairo, who lined the streets to view the procession. These judges assumed their offices at a time when Cairo was in extreme consternation on account of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\nOn the same day the Sult\u0101n gave the final instalment of pay to the troops detailed for the expedition, and the latter began to make their preparations for departure to Gaza. It was said that the Sult\u0101n paid about 2,000 of these Memlooks.\n\nOn Friday Malik al-\u2019Umar\u0101 J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Governor of Damascus, went up to the citadel and joined the Sult\u0101n in the Friday prayers. Then the Sult\u0101n conferred on him a robe of honour and gave him the rank of Pasha in command of the troops detailed for the expedition. On leaving the citadel the Pasha went to his tent at Raid\u0101nniyyeh, [79] leaving the city without a regular procession, being preceded merely by some led horses, drummers, and torch-bearers and going before the Am\u012brs and troops.\n\nOn Saturday, the 5th, the Sult\u0101n ordered the expeditionary troops to leave the city that day, in order to join the Pasha, saying that whoever failed to start would be dealt with\naccordingly. However, a number of Memlooks appeared before him refusing to start until he paid them six Ashrafis, the price of a camel, and issued forage to them and meat ration money. This caused some excitement, and the Sult\u0101n left the assembly objecting to the claim. The troops were dissatisfied, affairs were unsettled, and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was advancing on Gaza; the Governor was asking for the dispatch of troops before Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n should capture the town of Gaza, and thus cause the Sult\u0101n the trouble of recapturing the country.\n\nOn Sunday, the 6th, one of the Am\u012brs, commanders of a thousand, of the expeditionary force left the city. He was daily followed into camp by others, the Pasha in command, J\u0101n Birdi, remaining at Raid\u0101niyyeh until the whole force should be complete.\n\nOn Monday, the 7th, the Sultan paid three months rations to the expeditionary troops; each Memlook also received about four and a half Ashrafis apiece as an extra gratuity.\n\nOn the same day arrived two of the Royal Memlooks, who had been in some of the villages with the Arabs, returning to Egypt disguised as servants. They brought the same stories of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s difficulties that had been told before [see p. 83], and some said that Kh\u0101ir Bey had been killed. This had no foundation in fact.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 9th, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r of Kh\u0101ir Bey, the Governor of Aleppo, arrived; he had made his escape from Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. He brought the news that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had dispatched a force of about five thousand cavalry under Ibn Suw\u0101r, who was on the point of taking Gaza; in fact, according to some accounts he had actually taken it, and the Governor of Gaza was reported to have fled.\n\nThis intelligence caused great consternation; the Sult\u0101n was deeply distressed; he gave orders for the force to march immediately, and that any absentees should receive the punishment deserved. On Thursday the troops marched\noff in hot haste. The Sultan also started, accompanied by all the Amirs, and people said that it was the Sultan himself who would encounter Ibn Othman. The Sultan took with him the Governor of Aleppo, the great Amir, in irons, and a number of the bodyguard of Gaza, also in irons. The Governor of Gaza had reported against them that they had corresponded with Ibn Othman, suggesting to him that he should come and take possession of Gaza unopposed. They, however, denied this before the Sultan, and said that Dolat Bey, the Governor, had a grudge against the Gaza guards, and had invented this false story against them.\n\nThe Sultan then gave them credit for speaking the truth, and sent Jan Birdi, Governor of Damascus, to acquit them of the idle charge made against them. The Sultan released those that were with him, and sent them to the Inspector-General of the army to have their cases inquired into.\n\n[80] On Friday, the 11th, further rumours were current to the effect that Ibn Othman had sent troops to Gaza, under the command of his Amirs, one of whom was Iskender Pasha and another Daud Pasha. It was also reported that they had captured Gaza, and burnt some of the houses that the Governor had fled, that Ibn Othman\u2019s troops were advancing on Egypt, and that affairs were in a bad way.\n\nWhen the Sultan felt convinced of the truth of this news it was reported that he would himself go out to meet Ibn Othman. He gave orders that the roughs, the mischievous boys, the maghribis, and whosoever was in hiding on account of a murder or was blood-guilty would receive a pardon on presenting himself. He would inspect them on the Maidan, and give them pay and an animal to ride, and they would be attached to the corps of armourers during the Sultan\u2019s advance. This proclamation gave offence to the people, who did not like his pardoning murderers; it would have been better to have said nothing about this.\n\nComplete confusion prevailed on that day throughout Cairo; the expeditionary soldiers left in a great hurry. Amir\nKhud\u0101 Bird\u012b al-Ashrafi, one of the chief Am\u012brs, formerly Governor of Alexandria, also left. He had no regular state-procession, but was preceded by led chargers, and escorted by a large body of his Memlook troops; some said three hundred Memlooks. All the people invoked blessings on his head, and prayed for victory for the troops, being terror-stricken on account of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\nOn Saturday, the 12th, the Sult\u0101n sitting on the dais in his grounds received the Am\u012brs and urged them to leave the city that day. Then Am\u012br Tak\u1e6d Bai, the Chief Chamberlain, said that he had decided to go to Bu\u1e25airah, as he had been appointed Inspector there. To this the Am\u012brs replied that it was much more important for him to go out to fight Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n than to go to Bu\u1e25airah, and they further told him that he did not go out with the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b when he went on his expedition, and that he had not been plundered of baggage and uniform. To this the Am\u012br made excuse that he was not well. A great quarrel ensued between them in the presence of the Sult\u0101n, and finally the imported Memlooks planned to go and pillage and burn his house. Some of the Memlooks are said to have struck him, and he suffered great indignities at their hands. Ultimately he agreed to accompany the Am\u012brs on the expedition, and the Sult\u0101n prevented the Memlooks from plundering his house.\n\nOn that day the Sult\u0101n ordered the whole of the troops to parade for inspection; also the Am\u012br, who had been made Governor of \u1e24am\u0101h instead of J\u0101n Birdi al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, left the city with a military escort.\n\nThat day Am\u012br Erzamak N\u0101shif, one of the chief Am\u012brs, also left the city. He formed a regular military procession, and was preceded by led horses and two drums, and had a banner held above his head. The Am\u012brs gradually left the city to join in the fighting against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\nOn Sunday, the 13th, the Sult\u0101n reviewed the expeditionary troops in the Maid\u0101n. He went through the enrolment list a second time, and only exempted a small number. He also\ninspected four barracks and registered most of the Memlooks in them for the expedition.\n\nThe same day the Sult\u0101n inspected a wooden vehicle drawn [81] by oxen, and carrying musketeers; there were about thirty or more of these vehicles. He also inspected camels carrying an arrangement for musketeers to shoot from, on their backs, also wooden shields as a protection against arrows. So the troops that day felt in good heart for the fight. The Sult\u0101n declared that he was going in person to take part in the battle against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n,\u2019 and he urged the rest of the Am\u012brs to leave with all haste for the fray. But he gave them no money, saying that they must go out and fight for themselves, their children, and their wives. \u201cThere is nothing left,\u201d he said, \u201cin the Treasury; I am one of yourselves; if you go out, I go with you; and if you sit still, I sit still with you; I have no money to give you.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the 14th, it was reported that the Sult\u0101n had become displeased with Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, and had restored him to internment, after he had seemed likely to be restored to his office. The Sult\u0101n had charged Ibn M\u016bs\u0101 with the payment of a certain sum, of which he produced only a small amount, pleading inability to pay more. When the soldiers had to be paid previous to their hasty departure, the Sult\u0101n put pressure on those who had debts owing, of whom were Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, and Mu\u1e25ammed, the Superintendent, and Jem\u0101l al-D\u012bn, Guardian of Dahishah, and others, from whom arrears of money were due to help towards the payment of the soldiers.\n\nOn the same day Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh al-F\u0101jir, one of the chief Am\u012brs, left the city to proceed on the expedition; also Am\u012br Takt Bai, Chief Chamberlain. The latter had a procession, two drums and fifes, and some led horses going before him, like Erzamak al-N\u0101shif.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 15th, the Sult\u0101n inspected the remainder of the troops in the Maid\u0101n, and ordered the Am\u012brs with all the troops who were still left to start forthwith under penalties\nfor disobedience. So the expeditionary army left in mid-winter, and suffered great hardships in consequence. On this day T\u0101n\u012b Bey Nejm\u012b, one of the chief Am\u012brs, left, having the recognized war procession.\n\nOn Thursday, the 17th, Am\u012br Elm\u0101s, V\u0101l\u012b of Cairo, started. Also on this day a foreigner, a sausage-maker, was arrested; he was found to have taken a fat black dog, and to have killed it, and made it into sausages. On his arrest he was taken before Am\u012br M\u0101m\u0101\u012b, the Inspector of Markets, who caused him to be beaten with rods, and publicly exposed in Cairo, with the dog hung round his neck. After taking him round the town, he was imprisoned at Makshara. The Franks had been constantly committing atrocious acts of this nature.\n\nOn Monday, 21st, this occurrence took place: certain of the royal Memlooks on their way out towards Ma\u1e6dariyyeh saw a party coming towards them from the direction of Birkah al-\u1e24ajj. These people when questioned said that they were emissaries from the Sult\u0101n Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n; they were about fifteen in number. The chief emissary was an old, white-bearded man, dressed in velvet. In their company was also a man from Egypt, \u2018Abd al-Barr Ibn Mah\u0101sin, who had been Treasury Secretary to At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn al-Ajem\u012b. When the latter was killed [82], and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n took Aleppo and Damascus, the secretary was won over by the influence of Y\u016bnus al-\u0100dili and al-Samar\u1e33and\u012b. When Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n sent these emissaries they dared not come by Gaza, as the Governor of Damascus, J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, was in the vicinity besieging a force of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s which was in Gaza. So they bribed some Arabs with a substantial sum to take them by the Sult\u0101n\u2019s road. This brought them by the desert to Ajrud, and before people were aware of their arrival they were in the centre of the town. The Memlooks, on meeting them, arrested the chief emissary and his party, including Mah\u0101sin and the three Arabs with them. Meanwhile, they were approached by three Greeks from Kh\u0101n al-Khal\u012bl\u012b, who saluted them and kissed their hands. The Memlooks promptly\narrested them, and asked how they knew that the emissaries were coming on this day, and said that they were spies of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s. After beating them they brought them to the house of Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, the great Daw\u0101d\u0101r. At the house they ordered the emissary to dismount and salute the Daw\u0101d\u0101r. This he refused to do, using violent language against them. He then drew his sword and threw himself on the Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u2019s people; seeing this the Daw\u0101d\u0101r ordered the Memlooks to compel him to dismount, who made him get off and took his sword from him. They then fell upon him and his Turkish companions, beat them, stripped them, and put them in irons, after subjecting them to outrageous insults.\n\nWhen the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n heard of this he summoned Am\u012br Moghul Bai Daw\u0101d\u0101r Sikk\u012bn, whom al-Gh\u016br\u012b had sent to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and who had suffered abominable insults at the latter\u2019s hands. He was now ordered to go down, and to subject Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s emissary to the same treatment.\n\nHe took his comrades and went with them to Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n\u2019s house, with a view to subjecting them to insults or to killing them (?). But Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n would not suffer this.\n\nThen they brought \u2018Abd al-Barr Ibn Mah\u0101sin to the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, in whose presence he expatiated on the merits and the greatness of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. He recounted how eight hundred Egyptians were beheaded by him in one day, on his entry into Aleppo, including the successor of the Seyyid Al-hmed al-Bedaw\u012b and other notables who had remained behind there. He further reported that the troops of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n amounted to over sixty thousand men; that the Kh\u016b\u1e6dbah was delivered in his name from Bagdad to Damascus, and that his coinage was current from Bagdad to Damascus. Also that on his entry into Syria he set about building a wall with towers from K\u0101b\u016bn to the extremity of Damascus, securing the town by gates in the walls; that he was animated by great enthusiasm, and boasted that he would not turn back till he had conquered Egypt and killed all the Circassian Memlooks there. He told how Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n would remain in seclusion\nfor a day at a time, while his soldiers killed the inhabitants and committed atrocities. He said that they did not fast during Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, drank wine and b\u016bzah, and smoked \u1e25a\u0161\u0161\u012bsh (?).\n\nNeither did Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n say the Friday prayers except occasionally; these ugly stories had been circulated about him, independently of Ibn Mah\u0101sin, by eye-witnesses of the doings of his troops in Aleppo and Damascus. After this long account of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s actions, the Sult\u0101n said in a fit of anger, \u201cYou are a spy of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s and have come here to obtain intelligence for him.\u201d He then ordered Ibn Mah\u0101sin\u2019s imprisonment in the citadel tower, where he remained some days, after which he was released at the intercession of At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r.\n\nThe hearts of the soldiers sank at this account. Then the Sult\u0101n ordered two of the Arabs to be hanged, who had guided the emissaries along their unknown route. It was also rumoured that a party of about forty of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s men had come with them, and were hidden in Cairo.\n\nOn learning this the Sult\u0101n issued instructions to Kh\u0101n al-Khalil\u012b that no one was to harbour any of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s men, on pain of being hanged forthwith.\n\nThen the Sult\u0101n sent for the letters brought by the emissaries, whom he had not given an interview. Amongst them were a number addressed to the Am\u012brs, executive officials, and Egyptian notables. It appeared after the Sult\u0101n\u2019s perusal of the letters that they were mostly expressed in Turkish, the purport of them being as follows: \u201cFrom his Majesty to Am\u012br T\u016bm\u0101n Bai. It has been revealed to me that I shall become the possessor of the east and west, like Alexander the Great.\u201d Much of the letter consisted of threats and violent language, as for example: \u201cYou are a Memlook, who is bought and sold, you are not fit to govern. I am a king, descended through twenty generations of kings, and have taken possession of the country by agreement with the Khal\u012bfah and the judges.\u201d After many similar\nexpressions, the letter continued: \"If you wish to escape violent treatment let an issue of coinage be struck in our name in Egypt, and let the Khu\u1e6dbah be delivered also in our name; and become our governor from Gaza to Egypt, while we will rule from Syria to the Euphrates. But if you do not obey us, then I will enter Egypt, and kill all the Circassians there, ripping open those with child and destroying the unborn.\" He made so great a display of grandeur and power that may be God will desert him on account of his excessive presumption.\n\nWhen this letter was read to the Sult\u0101n he wept and was terrified. The imported Memlooks had agreed that if the emissary came up to the citadel they would fall upon him with their swords, so he did not appear there. The contents of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s communication soon became known among the people, and led to great confusion. Everyone was on the watch for Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, saying: \"As his emissaries came to us when we did not expect them, so he may fall upon us unexpectedly.\" People began to make strongholds for themselves in the neighbourhood of the city, where they might be hidden if Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n entered Cairo. Others decided to take their families to Upper Egypt, should his approach be confirmed. A story was circulated that Kh\u0101ir Bey, Governor of Aleppo, who had rebelled and submitted to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, [84] had written to some of the chief Am\u012brs urging them to tender their submission to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, extolling his virtues and just treatment of his subjects, and assuring them that if he came into Egypt they might all retain their posts and salaries. All this was mere trickery and deceit to facilitate Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s entry into Egypt.\n\nThen the Sult\u0101n proclaimed that the next issue of pay would take place on Wednesday, the 23rd; he sat on the dais in his courtyard and the troops came up to receive it. Each Memlook had thirty din\u0101rs and three months\u2019 pay, amounting to twenty din\u0101rs; but they threw it down before him and said, \"We will not start until we have received one hundred din\u0101rs\napiece; moreover, we have neither horses, nor clothing, nor equipment, nor arms.\u201d They left the citadel in anger. The Sultan, extremely displeased, left the dais, and ( ? ? ? ). He said \u201cthat he could not manage to pay one hundred dinars to each Memlook, for the state coffers were empty; that if they were not content they might elect whom they chose to be Sultan, and he would go to Mecca or elsewhere.\u201d So there were disturbances that day. It was reported that some Memlooks said to the Sultan himself, \u201cIf you are Sultan follow the custom of the former Sultans; if you resign, may the curse of Allah be upon you, and another will succeed you.\u201d The Sultan said to the troops, \u201cYou received thirty dinars from the Sultan al-Ghuri, and then you did not fight, but forsook him and left him to his death.\u201d The troops went away in anger, and some said they quarrelled among themselves. On the same day the Sultan ordered all the Amirs of rank to come up early the next day for a final parade; the meeting was then dissolved.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th, the Sultan took his seat again on the dais, and all the Amirs and troops assembled. Seyyid Muhammed Ibn al-Sultan al-Ghuri also attended, and the Sultan said: \u201cHere is your Master\u2019s son, ask him if his father left any money in the Treasury; he will tell you, and if you like to make him Sultan, I will be the first to kiss the ground before him.\u201d To this the imported Memlooks replied, \u201cWe will march without pay, to avenge our Master.\u201d But the Karanishah Memlooks said, \u201cWe will not march unless we receive one hundred and thirty dinars, like those who went on the former expedition.\u201d Then the meeting dispersed, many still murmuring, and there was much irresponsible talk that day. Some reported that the Amirs said to the Sultan: \u201cDo as al-Ashraf Kait Bai and al-Ghuri did; take money from the lands and pious foundations and endowments and fief-holders, and pay the army in that way, so as to keep the enemy out of Egypt.\u201d But the Sultan did not approve. \u201cI will never introduce injustice,\u201d he said,\n\"during my government.\" This was gratefully acknowledged by the people, who blessed him for it. He would have been within his rights, and they would have excused him had he done it, as the object was to keep out their enemies, and he could have replenished his Treasury in this way. But God had disposed him to do good, and he will reap his reward for this hereafter.\n\n[85] On the same day it was reported that the Sult\u0101n had sent to tell the adherents of Mu\u2019ayyed and Mans\u016br, and the Am\u012brs who were in Egypt to make preparations and to set forth on the expedition, any man who did not go was to send a substitute. It was said that some of the executive officials, servants, and eunuchs were charged to provide a considerable sum of money to help the Sult\u0101n. He at once set about the sale of clothing, arms, provisions, woollen stuffs, furs, sables, Ba\u2019ilbec coats, and other things. He also took some money from the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s son with which to provide pay.\n\nIt was reported that the Sult\u0101n sent some of the court officials to At\u0101bek K\u012bt al-Rahb\u012b to escort him from the fortress of Alexandria to that of Damietta. He also sent imperial instructions to Z\u0101hir K\u0101ns\u016bh, at the fortress of Alexandria, that he was to reside in the palace of al-Malik al-Mu\u2019ayyed \u0101t Alexandria, that he was to ride to the mosque, and celebrate the Friday prayers with the people, and to make excursions in the direction of the gardens of Alexandria.\n\nOn Friday, the 25th, Am\u012br Kh\u0101ir Bey, Architect, one of the chief Am\u012brs, with Am\u012br Ezbek, the Gunner, left for the expedition with the usual military procession.\n\nOn Saturday, the 26th, the troops went up for an inspection parade, but none of the chief Am\u012brs paraded, and the Sult\u0101n concealed himself in Dah\u012bshah; so the troops returned to their homes after a fruitless errand.\n\nOn the same day the Sult\u0101n issued a proclamation forbidding all excesses by the people, and that no Jew or Christian was to sell wine, beer, or hashish, under penalty of being hanged.\nforthwith. But no one paid any attention to this order, and things went on just as before.\n\nOn Thursday, the 1st, the newly appointed judges of the previous month went to congratulate the Sultan on the new month, and then returned to their homes. The Sultan then informed the troops that pay would be issued on Saturday, the 3rd. He had agreed to pay fifty dinars to each Memlook, and also five months arrears of meat rations and forage allowance, which gave them satisfaction. The Sultan also appointed about ten members of the Court to be Amirs of Tens, amongst them one named Khair Bey al-Bajmakdar, one of the best Memlooks of Ashraf Kait Bai. He also, it was said, distributed one thousand dinars amongst the dervishes in the monasteries and shrines at Karafah and elsewhere. He further gave five ardebs of wheat to each monastery, desiring them to pray for victory to the Sultan and destruction to the enemy. He also caused to be read a number of khatmahs from the Koran at the shrines, including those of the Imam al-Shafi'i, the Imam al-Laith, and others.\n\nThe Sultan also urged the descendants of the Sultans, the Amirs, and executive officials to make early payment of the sums assigned them towards the pay of the troops. It was said that he took a considerable sum of money from the Sultan al-Ghuri's son, and that al-Ghuri had, before he left for Syria, assigned to his son the amount of one hundred thousand dinars; such at least was the report.\n\nOn Saturday, the 3rd, the troops went up to the citadel to receive their pay, in compliance with the Sultan's orders. [86] On that same day came the bad news that the army that had gone to Gaza had suffered defeat on Sunday, the 24th, of Dhu'l Ka'dah. Strangely enough, al-Ghuri's previous defeat took place on Sunday, the 25th of Rejeb, there being only a difference of one day in the two dates, a remarkable coincidence.\n\nBriefly the account was as follows: Jan Birdi al-Ghazali started for the expedition a few days in advance of the troops,\nthe latter and the Am\u012brs following in batches in a very dilatory manner. Seeing their delay in joining, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b collected a party of Arabs and, accompanied by Am\u012br Erzamak al-N\u0101shif, one of the chief Am\u012brs, who had been appointed Governor of \u1e24am\u0101h, and D\u014dl\u0101t Bai, Governor of Gaza, originally one of al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s Memlooks, with a body of the Sultan\u2019s Memlooks advanced to Gaza. Marching along the Sult\u0101n\u2019s road, they cut across Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s force, and a fierce battle ensued at al-Sher\u012b\u2018at near Bais\u0101n. The Ottoman troops were commanded by Sin\u0101n Pasha, who had Am\u012brs and a large body of Turkish troops under him. The force with J\u0101n Bird\u012b was only a small one. A most terrible fight ensued between them, enough to turn one\u2019s hair grey. It resulted in the defeat of J\u0101n Bird\u012b and his Am\u012brs and troops. Many Am\u012brs were amongst the slain. [Names omitted.]\n\n* * * * *\n\nAm\u012br J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and Am\u012br Erzamak al-N\u0101shif were reported wounded, a great number of the Royal Memlooks and servants were killed and their heads hacked about with swords.\n\nThis news was said to have come from al-Am\u012br Takt Bai, High Chamberlain. It was just after he had left to take part in the expedition, and was waiting at \u015eal\u0131hiyyeh, that some of the Royal Memlooks came and reported what had happened. So he sent to tell the Sult\u0101n of the terrible conflict. It was said that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s men had taken possession of the baggage of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and Erzamak al-N\u0101shif, after the battle, and that they were left with neither baggage nor arms, nor horses nor camels. This second victory added fresh vigour to the Ottoman troops. Of the Egyptians, only he escaped whose life was destined to be prolonged. It was said that al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019s Memlooks were those who had noticed the army (of the Turks), and were the first to flee, and so brought about this second defeat.\n\nIn view of the many different reports, Am\u012br Sunbul, chief\nof the Memlooks, was sent to \u015e\u00e2l\u00eehiyyeh to obtain intelligence, and he started at once.\n\nOn Sunday, the 4th, this terrible incident occurred: The Sultan went to the Maid\u00e2n and was joined by the Am\u00eers and troops. Suddenly a great clamour arose in Rumailah, and the report was spread that Ibn \u2018Othm\u00e2n\u2019s army had arrived at Raid\u00e2niyyeh. Then the Sultan said: \u201cHow many times have you been ordered to march off on the expedition, and have been unwilling to go; go out now and meet Ibn \u2018Othm\u00e2n!\u201d So the troops armed themselves and marched off; and there was a horrible clamour in Cairo, and people stored away their clothing in secret places. In the midst of all this confusion, [87] the troops mounted and proceeded to Raid\u00e2niyyeh, but finding that the Turks were not there, they returned to their homes, after Cairo had been convulsed and people had made up their minds to hide in the cemeteries. It then appeared that a party of Arabs had come down from the hills to Raid\u00e2niyyeh, and a man who saw them at a distance reported that they were Turks, and this false report was published in Cairo. To-day the Sultan released Am\u00eer K\u00e2ns\u00fbh al-Ashrafi, formerly Governor of Aleppo, who had surrendered the citadel without resistance (p. 73).\n\n* * * * *\n\nOn Monday, the 5th, the remnant of the Am\u00eers and troops who had been defeated at Gaza by Ibn \u2018Othm\u00e2n returned to Cairo. Among them was J\u00e2n Bird\u00ee al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee and Erzamak al-N\u00e2shif, and certain subordinate Am\u00eers. They arrived in the most pitiable state, the plunder and slaughter had been worse than before. Some of the imperial Memlooks came back on donkeys, some on camels, all having been deprived of uniforms, horses, and arms.\n\nNone survived, in fact, but a few for whom fate had so decreed. They said that some of Ibn \u2018Othm\u00e2n\u2019s troops were armed with hooks on their lances, with which they dragged the rider from his horse, and threw him on the ground. J\u00e2n Bird\u00ee said that he was thus thrown down,\nand had it not been for his servants who defended him from the Turks, they would have hacked his head, as they did that of Am\u012br Khud\u0101 Bird\u012b, who was killed.\n\nThey also said that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops were in numbers as swarms of locusts; that some of them were armed with muskets (firing a leaden bullet), and were carried in wooden carts, drawn by oxen and buffaloes, moving at the head of the advanced guard; and many other things of this nature.\n\nAmongst those who also returned were Am\u012br Dol\u0101t Bai, Governor of Gaza, and there at the time of the battle; Am\u012br Bakhsh Bai, Inspector of Granaries, brother of Am\u012br Kurt Bai, formerly V\u0101l\u012b of Cairo, wrongly reported as killed in the battle of Merj D\u0101bek; he had been hiding with the Arabs. There also returned one of the subordinate Am\u012brs, K\u0131rkm\u0101s al-Ra\u1e25b\u012b, reported killed in the same battle, and many others.\n\nOn the arrival of J\u0101n Bird\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and Am\u012br Erzamak al-N\u0101shif at the citadel, the Sult\u0101n clothed them in sleeveless robes, lined with ermine, and they returned to their homes. There was general rejoicing at their safety for they were Knights of Isl\u0101m, and bands played in their honour outside their houses.\n\nOn the return of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b with the Am\u012brs and troops, the correct list of losses was ascertained, and in every quarter there was mourning, as if it were the Days of Judgment.\n\nOrders were given by the Sult\u0101n that the first issue of pay would be on Tuesday, the 6th. Early on the morning of this day the troops went up to the citadel, and the Sult\u0101n began to pay them, giving each Memlook twenty-five din\u0101rs, including the usual money for the feast of \u201cSacrifices\u201d. He had first offered them thirty din\u0101rs each, and this they had refused; but when they saw how serious matters were, and [88] that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was advancing and had even reached \u1e32at\u012by\u0101, they agreed to accept twenty-five din\u0101rs. They went down from the citadel and set about arming themselves for departure.\n\nThe same day the Sult\u0101n received the bad news that\nSin\u0101n Pasha, one of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s Am\u012brs, who had taken possession of the town of Gaza, had put the people of the place to the sword, killing about a thousand\u2014men, women, and children.\n\nThis act was perpetrated for the following reason:\n\nDuring the engagement between al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and Sin\u0101n Pasha, a report was spread in Gaza that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b had gained a victory over the troops of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and had killed Sin\u0101n Pasha, whereupon \u2018Al\u012b Bai, Deputy Daw\u0101d\u0101r of Gaza, and his troops set to work to plunder the Turkish camp, burning their tents and killing those Turks who were in camp and in the town, about 400, including old men, children, and the sick. As soon as the battle had gone against the Egyptian troops and their Am\u012brs, Sin\u0101n Pasha returned to Gaza, where he discovered the destruction that had been wrought. He then assembled all the people of Gaza, and asked them who had committed such outrages; they replied, \u201c\u2018Al\u012b Bai, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r of the Deputy of Gaza, and his soldiers; we did none of it.\u201d Sin\u0101n Pasha then ordered a surprise search to be made in the houses of Gaza; uniform and horses were found in them belonging to the Turks. Then Sin\u0101n Pasha said, \u201cWhen we entered Gaza did we disturb any of you, or plunder you of anything?\u201d They replied, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy have you done so to our troops?\u201d to which they had no answer or excuse to make. Then he ordered his soldiers to put them to the sword, and they massacred a multitude of them; good and bad perished together. Such was the divine decree, and it has been rightly said, \u201cIf Fate brings thee into distress through the sins of thy past life, ask God to remove it, for He alone can do so.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the 7th, a number of nomad tribesmen of Ghaz\u0101lah, Mu\u1e25\u0101rib, and Huw\u0101r\u0101h, arrived at the royal gates. The Sult\u0101n had compelled the Arab Sheikhs to bring a number of their bravest Arab horsemen to accompany his troops on the expedition. The Arabs assembled in great numbers at Gizeh, and went thence to the R\u016bmailah to parade before the\nSult\u0101n in the Maid\u0101n. The prestige of the Memlooks had been damaged in the eyes of the Arabs and Fell\u0101l\u012bn on account of the defeats suffered at the hands of the Turks. Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was in possession of Syria, the people felt sure that the Circassian Dynasty was tottering, and that it was Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n who was master of the country. Some of the people in reply to a demand from their Sult\u0101n, said, \u201cWe cannot pay tribute until we are sure whether the country belongs to you or to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n; we do not want to pay it twice over. In fact, confusion reigns on land and sea; Heaven only knows what will happen.\u201d\n\nOn that day it was reported that the Sult\u0101n had given orders for the messenger, before mentioned, who came from Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, to be drowned; and it was said that he had been actually drowned by night, and the Turks who were with him.\n\nAt this time the Sult\u0101n began to distribute the grants to the troops for the Feast of Sacrifices, but he did not give any [89] to the Memlooks defeated with Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, saying, \u201cYou ran away and did not fight at all; you betrayed the Am\u012brs, so that they suffered a defeat.\u201d At this time also a rumour ran amongst the people that the vanguard of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s army had reached Kat\u012by\u0101, and had taken the citadel of T\u012bnah, which had been destroyed by its inhabitants. This report, however, lacked confirmation.\n\nSaturday, the 17th, was the Feast of Sacrifices, so the Sult\u0101n took part in the festival prayers, the Am\u012brs attending, as usual, in full-dress uniform. There was a grand festival procession, but the people were in great fear and trembling on account of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n . . . particularly on what they had heard of the plundering and killing of the people of Gaza, the taking captive of the women, and the massacre of the children.\n\nOn Monday, the 12th, the Sult\u0101n paraded the Royal ammunition column, which was to accompany the force. The wooden vehicles which he had made for the expedition were\ndriven past him, as he was seated on the Maid\u0101n. There were a hundred in all (known by the Turks as \u2018Arabahs), each one being drawn by a pair of oxen. They carried brass guns which fired leaden balls.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n came down from his seat and mounted his charger, holding a baton in his hand, and attended to the proper arrangement of the vehicles as they went by. Then wagons followed and two hundred camels bearing about 1,500 large shields, also powder, lead, iron, and wooden lances, etc. In front of the wagons were four drums and fifes; in front of all marched some two hundred sharpshooters, consisting of Turcomans and Maghribis carrying white Ba\u2018lbec standards, saying, \u201cGod make the Sult\u0101n victorious.\u201d They were also accompanied by a body of slaves and others, bearing naphtha to throw in front of the wagons. At the head of the column rode Am\u012br Moghul Bai, the Chief Armourer, and Y\u016bsuf, Second Armourer, a number of the armoury rank and file, and \u2018Abd al-B\u0101sit, Superintendent. Al-Shih\u0101b\u012b A\u1e25med Ibn T\u016bl\u016bn\u012b went with them, and a great number of carpenters and blacksmiths, who had been detailed for the expedition.\n\nThey went out into the Rumailah by the Maid\u0101n gate, passing by the tombs and on through Bastiyyin by the Zawilah-gate, and Cairo city. The streets resounded as they went through, and the people lined their shops to see the sight. It was a memorable day, and the people prayed for victory over Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, the rebel. They wept when they beheld these wagons and guns, and realized the great enterprise of the Sult\u0101n. The column continued its way through Cairo, and emerging at the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r, proceeded to Raid\u0101niyyeh, halting near the tomb of al-\u2018\u0100dil there. It was reported that a woman was crushed to death in the crowd. On the arrival of the wagons at the tomb of al-\u2018\u0100dil they were drawn up there to await the Am\u012brs; it was a day to be remembered as a spectacle.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 13th, some people interceded for the Memlooks from Gaza, who had not received the grant for the\nFeast of Sacrifices from the Sult\u0101n. So the latter paid them that day, after reprimanding them again, saying, [90] \u201cYou fled and brought a defeat on the Am\u012brs; you did not fight at all, and disgraced yourselves in the eyes of the people.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the 14th, al-N\u0101sir\u012b Mu\u1e25ammed Ibn Shems al-D\u012bn al-K\u016bs\u016bn\u012b, the Chief Doctor arrived at the Palace. He had been a prisoner of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s in Aleppo, and escaped thence with the Arabs, and for a considerable sum of money they brought him to Egypt. He went up and had an audience of the Sult\u0101n. He had altered his appearance, shaved his chin, and disguised himself as an Arab, and thus managed to escape. He told his story to the Sult\u0101n, and said that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops were mutinous; that he had lost an enormous number of camels and horses owing to snow in Syria; that the prices of everything were exorbitant; that the troops were suffering from the cold and the snow, and the loss of their horses. It was reported that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops had been in Gaza and had left it and were fleeing to the hills; and that the Arabs were killing many of those whom they found in the villages. On Thursday, the 15th, the soldiers went up to receive their pay, but the eunuchs said to them: \u201cSirs, there is no pay to-day; the country is laid waste, the roads are infested by the Arabs, and the collectors and the Sheikhs of the Arabs have not sent any of the amounts due from them. If by Monday any of it is received it shall be paid to you.\u201d So the troops left the citadel distressed. It was six months since they had received an issue of ration-meat, and their pay was in arrears as well.\n\nThe same day the Sult\u0101n conferred a robe of honour on K\u0101ns\u016bh Rajlah, one of the chief Am\u012brs, who had been Governor of Kat\u012by\u0101, and appointed him Inspector of the Shark\u012beh Provinces instead of Kajm\u0101s, who had been found incapable of improving their condition. Elm\u0101s, the Western Inspector, retained his post; and Am\u012br Abrak, the Vizir and Ust\u0101d\u0101r, also retained his; the latter\u2019s dismissal had been reported.\nEgyptian affairs had then fallen into great confusion owing to a variety of causes.\n\nOn Friday the Sult\u0101n took part in the prayers of the day. Then he conferred a distinction on At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn al-Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u012b, and appointed him to command the troops on the expedition. At this time, also, Am\u012br Ta\u1e33\u1e6d Bai, the Chief Chamberlain, arrived. He had started with the expedition to Gaza, but had declared himself ill and remained at \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh. After the defeat of J\u0101n B\u012brd\u012b al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, and his return to Egypt, the rest of the Am\u012brs remained at \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh waiting for the departure of the second expedition. So when Amir Ta\u1e33\u1e6d Bai arrived without the others, the Am\u012brs were distressed. The Am\u012brs and the troops considered him incapable; in fact, he was detested by the whole army. On this day the Sult\u0101n ordered the Arab tribesmen who had arrived in the city to return to their homes, as the Am\u012brs had pointed out to him that the Arabs would be of no use on the expedition.\n\nDuring this month the Sult\u0101n conferred a distinction on [91] Am\u012br \u012an\u0101l, treasurer to al-Am\u012br \u1e6car\u0101 Bai, one of the Am\u012brs of Tens, and appointed him Governor of Damietta, instead of the existing governor.\n\nOn Sunday, the 18th, the Sult\u0101n received the bad news that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n himself had left Syria with his army, and was marching on Egypt. He was said to have divided his forces into two, and to be sending one army along the royal route and another through the desert.\n\nOn receipt of this news the Sult\u0101n assembled the Am\u012brs, and a council of war was held. It was reported that he would himself go to Raid\u0101niyyeh and remain there, and that the troops would be formed into two forces, one going in the direction of \u2018Ajr\u016bd and the other to the place whence the messenger had come. The Am\u012brs had decided that the expedition should be dispatched at the beginning of the new year; but when this bad news reached them confusion reigned among them, and the Sult\u0101n ordered them to send out tents\nquickly to Raid\u0101niyyeh, and to be on the look-out, as Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had reached Gaza.\n\nIt was said that he had gone to visit Jerusalem, and would then march with his troops into Egypt. Some said one thing and some another, so that people were at a loss where to go till this trouble should be over. The Sult\u0101n ordered the Inspector of the troops to go round to all the Am\u012brs to urge them to send their tents to Raid\u0101niyyeh that day\u2014so this was done.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n also issued a proclamation to all Maghribis in Egypt and Cairo to parade for inspection the next day.\n\nOn Monday, the 19th, the Sult\u0101n took his seat on the dais in the courtyard, and a great number of the Maghribis came up, but on their arrival at the citadel the Sult\u0101n did not go out to meet them; he sent Am\u012br Sh\u0101d Bey, the \u201cone-eyed\u201d, to them, who said: \u201cThe Sultan commands you to select a thousand of your bravest men to take part in the expedition.\u201d Whereupon they sent to the Sult\u0101n, saying: \u201cIt is not our custom to go with the army; we are only to fight against the Franks, and not against Mu\u1e25ammedans,\u201d and they showed they were on Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s side.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n was annoyed by their reply, and sent to tell them that if they did not go out to fight the imported Memlooks would kill all the Maghribis in Egypt to the last man.\n\nAt this time it was reported that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n had sent a letter to the Sheikh of the Arabs, A\u1e25med Ibn Ba\u1e33ar, offering him a pardon, saying: \u201cEnter into our allegiance and receive our pardon, and meet us at \u1e62\u0101lihiyyeh with a thousand ardebbs of barley.\u201d It was said that \u2018Abd al-D\u0101\u2019im A\u1e25med Ibn Ba\u1e33ar, who was a rebel, had gone to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n to Gaza, and there were endless stories in circulation about Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n.\n\nOn this Monday also the Sult\u0101n ordered a parade of all ranks for the following day at Raid\u0101niyyeh, fully accoutred. The Sult\u0101n went down to the Maid\u0101n, said the afternoon prayers, then rode off to Raid\u0101niyyeh and remained in camp there, for the first time since his accession.\nOn Tuesday, the 20th, the troops paraded under arms for inspection of the Sult\u0101n. That day the chief Am\u012brs went out to Raid\u0101niyyeh, that is, the Am\u012brs detailed for the expedition. They went out in detachments fully armed ( ? ? ? ). [92] \u1e6cak\u1e6d Bai, Chief Chamberlain, was said to be excused for ill-health, but most probably he went. The rest of the chief Am\u012brs of thousands started off, all the Am\u012brs of Tablkh\u0101n\u0101h and Tens, and the Egyptian troops; only a small number of Am\u012brs and soldiers remained behind.\n\nThere were more troops employed on this expedition than under al-Gh\u016br\u012b, and this Sult\u0101n had displayed great energy in making wagons and forging guns, in the manufacture of muskets, and the raising of a very large number of musketeers. In all this he showed a great amount of energy and high purpose, hoping that Allah would give him the victory over Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, for the latter had attacked the Egyptian army without provocation, and for every tyrant there exists somewhere a place or mode of death.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n gave orders that when they fought in three days\u2019 time the big elephants should accompany the troops into battle. On their departure that day the Sult\u0101n rode from his camp to the Ma\u1e63\u1e6dabah at Raid\u0101niyyeh, the place where the rations were served out. He sat there while a great concourse of men assembled under arms, covering the whole plain. There also were gathered the great majority of the common people, and even the women; shouts were raised and prayers uttered for victory for the Sult\u0101n. It was a memorable day, and when the Sult\u0101n looked at the troops he did not inspect them there, but proclaimed that the troops of all ranks were to assemble at \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh for inspection, and that he would not go there until after the troops were assembled, and that he would then return to the citadel; the latter was the proper course to take.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th, the Sult\u0101n was still at Raid\u0101niyyeh, and on that day the remnant of the troops left. There was no excuse for their departure being prolonged, the Sult\u0101n having urged them to start with the utmost dispatch.\nWhen the Sult\u0101n left the citadel he took with him K\u0101sim Bey, one of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s sons, the boy of whom mention has been made. The Sult\u0101n had given him a special outfit and ornaments, and ordered him to go with the troops, and to stand, when in action, under the Royal Standard. It was said that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was uneasy about this boy, and that the majority of his soldiers were favourably inclined towards him, and said that if Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h were defeated they had no one but their master\u2019s son to succeed him.\n\nThe same day there was a report that the Ruler of Rhodes had sent the Sult\u0101n a thousand musketeers, and a number of ships containing powder; that these ships had entered the port of Damietta; and that they were sent by the Ruler of Rhodes to help the Sult\u0101n of Egypt against Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, who had designs upon Egypt. But nothing came of this; it was mere idle rumour without foundation.\n\nWhen the Sult\u0101n went out to Raid\u0101niyyeh it was said that he would proceed to \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh to meet Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s [93] forces, but the Am\u012brs prevented his going, telling him that fighting would only take place between them at Raid\u0101niyyeh.\n\nThe merchants began to transfer their goods from the shops in the market into secret places for safe keeping, but none of their goods escaped. On that day most people removed from the suburbs and went into Cairo, and lived there.\n\nThe well-to-do people moved their belongings to the monasteries, schools, and burial-grounds, and to the houses of the common folk in the grazing grounds for safe keeping; but none of their property escaped, as will be seen later.\n\nAt the end of this year Shih\u0101b\u012b A\u1e25med Ibn al-Am\u012br Asnbagh\u0101 al-\u1e6cayy\u0101r\u012b died; he was formerly Chief of the Guards, and belonged to a family of chiefs. He was a venerable and excellent chief; he was nearly 90 when he died, and one of the oldest inhabitants of the land.\n\nOn Thursday, the 22nd, news came that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\nhad left Gaza, and that his advanced guard had reached 'Ar\u00eesh. It was reported that the Sult\u00e2n had ordered a trench to be dug from the fountain of 'All\u00e2n up to Jebel Al\u00eemer (red mountain) and beyond the fields of Ma\u1e6dariyyeh, and he then erected large shields along that trench, the guns were drawn up and arranged round them and the wooden carriages, already mentioned as having been made at the citadel. Then the Sult\u00e2n ordered Am\u00eer M\u00e2m\u00e2y al-\u1e62agh\u00eer, the Inspector of Markets, to issue a proclamation to the shopkeepers, chandlers, bakers, and butchers in Cairo to bring their goods to the camp at the tomb of al-\u02bf\u0100dil, and establish a market there for the troops. The Sult\u00e2n instructed the V\u00e2li to proclaim that all the soldiers who had remained behind should go out to Raid\u00e2niyyeh. So the torch-bearers (?) gave it out in the quarters and streets that the Royal Memlooks were to go out to the camp that day, under penalty of being hung forthwith at their own doors. The Sult\u00e2n caused this to be proclaimed twice on that day, for he learnt that many of the Royal Memlooks used to go out early in the morning to the camp, so that the Sult\u00e2n might see them, and return to spend the night in their houses, and this displeased the Sult\u00e2n, and he ordered them to spend every night in camp.\n\nOn Friday, the 23rd, news came that Ibn \u2018Othman\u2019s advance guard had reached Ka\u1e6d\u00eey\u00e2, which greatly disturbed the people. On Saturday, the 24th, the Sult\u00e2n inspected the troops in camp, and the whole body of them paraded. The Sult\u00e2n promised them that if they fought bravely against Ibn \u2018Othm\u00e2n\u2019s army and defeated them he would pay them ten ashraf\u00ees each, and give each of them a sword and shield. He ordered Am\u00eer Ans Bai, Master of the Horse, to effect a reconciliation between the roughs of al-\u1e62al\u00eebah and the roughs of the town. It was reported on that day that the Sult\u00e2n set to work to construct a wall to protect the guns which he had posted at Raid\u00e2niyyeh, and that the Sult\u00e2n carried some of the stones himself with the workmen. When the soldiers saw that the Sult\u00e2n was carrying stones himself\nthe Memlooks set to work to do the same, and to help the workmen to excavate the ditch and make the wall for the protection of the guns.\n\nThen the news arrived that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops had [94] reached Belbeis.\n\nOn Sunday, the 25th, al-Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh al-\u2018Adil\u012b, the Inspector of the Shar\u1e33\u012beh, returned. The Sult\u0101n had sent him to find out information about Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s forces when they had arrived near \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh. When the Am\u012br K\u0101ns\u016bh reached \u0160\u0101lihiyyeh he saw that a party of Ibn \u2018Othman\u2019s men were there. He captured two of them, decapitated them, and brought their heads before the Sult\u0101n. With them was a man from Aleppo, belonging to Kh\u0101ir Bey, the Governor, who had intrigued against the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b and joined Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. This man gave the following information to the Sult\u0101n, T\u016bm\u0101n Bai:\n\n\u201cKh\u0101ir Bey, Governor of Aleppo, is coming against you with Ibn Suw\u0101r and a number of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s Am\u012brs and an advanced guard of 8,000 of his cavalry. But their horses are exhausted with fatigue and hunger, and food is scarce among the troops.\u201d On this man were found a number of letters from Kh\u0101ir Bey, Governor of Aleppo, to the chief Am\u012brs in Egypt. So the Sult\u0101n took the letters and put the man in irons.\n\nIt was reported that the commander of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s force, on entering into Belbeis, proclaimed pardon and security, promising that none of the inhabitants, nor the fell\u0101\u1e25\u012bn, should be ill-treated by the Turkish soldiers. Next came the news that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops were at \u2018Ikrishah.\n\nOn learning this the Sult\u0101n was anxious to go out with the troops and engage them then and there, but he was prevented by the Am\u012brs. It would have been for the best had he done so, as their horses were at a standstill from fatigue and hunger, and most of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s force had marched on foot from the time they left Syria and were extremely tired. The Sult\u0101n would probably have been able to defeat them before\nthey could reach Kh\u0101nk\u0101h and find supplies of fodder and drink and could rest from their fatigues. But the Am\u012brs would not have it so, and the Turks succeeded in entering Kh\u0101nk\u0101h. Then the Sult\u0101n ordered his troops to pass that night in front of the camp in the saddle, fully accoutred, and only to sleep in turns for fear of a night attack. An intense fear of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s forces now prevailed amongst the Circassians. On the approach of his army to Kh\u0101nk\u0101h most of the inhabitants left with their families and goods, and went into Cairo for fear of plunder and massacre by the Turks. Then the S\u0101lim\u012b Arabs began to lay hold of any Turks they could catch, and, decapitating them, brought their heads to the Sult\u0101n, who ordered them to be hung up on the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r, and Bab Zaw\u012blah.\n\nThe Sult\u0101n inspected the troops in Raid\u0101niyyeh, fully accoutred, with the chief and subordinate Am\u012brs; the former were accompanied by the drums and fifes, and it was an important day. The Sult\u0101n then went out to Birkah al-H\u0101j [95] with the Amirs and all the troops; he returned to camp preceded by torches, drums, and fifes.\n\nThe columns of troops extended from Jebel al-Al\u012bmer to the fields of Ma\u1e6dariyyeh, the whole plain was covered with them. It was said that the Sult\u0101n, on hearing that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n was at Belbeis, ordered that the granaries there and in the neighbourhood, and even those in Kh\u0101nk\u0101h, should be burnt. Great quantities of straw, bran, wheat, barley, and beans were burnt, to save them from Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s troops, who required them for themselves and their horses, and would have been thus strengthened for the fight.\n\nThe following incident was said to have happened before the end of this year. The Sult\u0101n was sitting in his tent when a Turcoman entered wearing a red cap and a quiver, with a muffler drawn over his face. The Sult\u0101n had a few of his suite with him. On approaching the Sult\u0101n he was pushed back by some of the eunuchs, who were standing by, and when his chest was touched a pair of long breasts were found,\nand the blanket being drawn off a Turcoman woman was revealed. The Sultan, suspecting she had come to murder him, ordered her to be taken out. They then found that the woman was wearing a coat of mail under her clothes, and was carrying a large dagger. The imported Memlooks, seeing this, struck at her with their swords. They felt sure she had meant to murder the Sultan. After she had been killed the Sultan ordered her to be suspended on the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r.\n\nThen the Sultan sent two heads by the V\u0101li\u2019s Daw\u0101d\u0101r; one was thought to be that of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Samarkand\u012b, and the other that of one of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s Am\u012brs. Both were fastened up over a shop by the Zaw\u012blah-gate.\n\nOne of the Arabs had plotted against Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Samarkandi; he had entertained him, and Samar\u1e33and\u012b spent the night with him; he had come with Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s forces. During the night the Bedouin cut his head off, and at daybreak took it to the Sultan, T\u016bm\u0101n Bai, and asked him what he would give to the person who would bring him Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Samar\u1e33and\u012b\u2019s head. The Sultan said: \u201cA thousand din\u0101rs.\u201d He then produced the head from under his cloak, saying, \u201cHere it is.\u201d After having this verified, the Sultan paid him the thousand din\u0101rs.\n\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm Samarkand\u012b came originally from al-Med\u012bnah. He travelled from Persia to Turkey, and was acquainted with the Turkish language. He went into Egypt and became one of the Sultan\u2019s al-Gh\u016br\u012b\u2019 personal friends. On the latter\u2019s defeat he joined Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, and became one of his suite. It was said that it was he who suggested to Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n that he should enter Egypt and take possession of it [96] and exterminate the Circassians. Samar\u1e33and\u012b was a great tyrant, and had he lived to see Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n in possession of Egypt the people would never have received any good from him, and he himself brought all sorts of charges against the dignitaries of Egypt. But Allah gave the people relief from his evil ways.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 28th, news arrived that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s\nadvanced guard was at Birkah al-H\u0101j, which put the military in Cairo into a state of great consternation. They closed the B\u0101b al-Fut\u016bl\u012b and B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r, and the B\u0101b al-Sha\u02bfriyyeh, also the B\u0101b al-Bal\u012br and the B\u0101b al-Kan\u1e6darah, and other gates of the town. The markets in Cairo were closed, the mills were stopped, and bread and flour became scarce.\n\nAs soon as the Sult\u0101n had confirmation of the reports that Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s army had arrived at Birkah al-H\u0101j, he sounded the alarm in camp. All the troops and chief Am\u012brs and the Am\u012brs of \u1e6cablkh\u0101n\u0101h and of Tens, and K\u0101sim Bey Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n mounted. The total of the assembled forces, including the Royal Memlooks and Arabs, amounted to some 20,000 horsemen, with about thirty standards. The drums and fifes sounded to battle, and the Sult\u0101n T\u016bm\u0101n Bai rode round, personally posted the Am\u012brs according to their ranks, and drew up his forces from Jebel Al\u1e25mer to the fields of Ma\u1e6dariyyeh. An immense force was assembled, and the Sult\u0101n displayed a lofty courage(?). Had the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b been alive he would not have done a fraction of what Sult\u0101n T\u016bm\u0101n Bai did. But Allah did not grant him the victory over Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n. No battle took place that day between the opposing forces, neither of them went out to meet the adversary. On that day a few Turks\u2019 heads were cut off and sent to be suspended on the gates of the city.\n\nOn Thursday, the 29th, a tremendous engagement took place, the mere mention of which is enough to strike terror into the hearts of men and its horrors to unhinge their reason.\n\nTo sum up, it may be said that the Sult\u0101n T\u016bm\u0101n Bai, after encamping at Raid\u0101niyyeh, fortified it with cannons and guns, arranged a line of shields and wooden defences for them, and dug a trench from Jebel Al\u1e25mer to the Ma\u1e6dariyyeh fields. In rear of the guns he placed about a thousand camel loads of sacks of forage, and on the pack-saddles he fastened white and red banners, which fluttered in the breeze. He also collected a number of oxen to draw the vehicles. He expected a long battle between himself and Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n, or even a long\nsiege; matters, however, turned out differently. Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s forces halted two days at Birkah al-\u1e24\u0101j, but the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e6c\u016bm\u0101n Bai did not venture to advance against them; he ought to have done so, and given them battle there, before they could get into Raid\u0101niyyeh. On Thursday Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s force came on, and his advanced guard reached Jebel Al\u1e25mer.\n\nOn learning this the Sul\u1e6d\u0101n sounded the alarm in camp, and ordered the troops to move out to engage Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s army. The drums beat to battle, the chief Am\u012brs and the whole force mounted, and extended across the plain. [97] Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s soldiers came on like locusts in multitude and they were superior in point of numbers. The two armies met in the outskirts of Raid\u0101niyyeh, and a terrible battle ensued, which it would take long to describe, a greater battle than that which took place in Merj D\u0101bek. Countless numbers of the Turks were killed, including Sin\u0101n Pasha, Ibn \u2018Othman\u2019s former tutor and his Chief Vizir, and a great many of his Am\u012brs. Their bodies lay scattered from \u2018All\u0101n\u2019s fountain (?) to the tomb of Am\u012br Yeshbek, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r. Then the Turks recovered, coming up from every direction like clouds. They divided into two forces, one advancing under Jebel Al\u1e25mer, and the other by the camp at Raid\u0101niyyeh. The noise of their musketry was deafening, and their attack furious. In a short time countless numbers of Egyptian troops had fallen, including a great many of the chief Am\u012brs, among whom was Ezbek, the Gunner. At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, was seriously wounded, some say that his thigh was broken and that he hid in a field there. Am\u012br \u2018All\u0101n, the Daw\u0101d\u0101r, was also wounded. In the short space of about sixty minutes the Egyptian army was defeated and in full retreat.\n\n\u1e6c\u016bm\u0101n Bai stood his ground about eighty minutes after this, and fought on with a few of his armed slaves and Memlooks, inflicting great losses on Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s men. Finally, when the Turks were too many for him, finding himself deserted by his troops, and fearing capture, he folded up\nthe Royal Standard, and ran and concealed himself; some say that he went towards Tar\u0101.\n\nThis was the third defeat the Egyptian army had suffered.\n\nThe Turkish force that had advanced under cover of Jebel Almer, came down upon the tents of the Sult\u0101n, plundering everything, kit, arms, horses, camels, and oxen, including the guns the Sult\u0101n had put into position there, with the shields and palisading, and the vehicles on which the Sult\u0101n had spent so much time, labour, and money, and from which he had reaped no advantage. Everything in the camp was plundered. Such was the decree of Fate.\n\nAfter the flight of the Sult\u0101n and the looting of the camp, numbers of Turks carried sword and violence into Cairo. Some proceeded to Maksharah, and burning the doors let out the prisoners, including a number of Turks whom the Sult\u0101n had imprisoned when he was at Raid\u0101niyyeh. They also released all those in D\u012blem and Rahbah.\n\nThen they went on to the house of Am\u012br Kh\u0101ir Bey, the architect, one of the chief Am\u012brs, and plundered that. The house of Y\u016bnus, the Interpreter, and those of many of the Am\u012brs, the leading executive officials, and people holding honourable positions were similarly treated. Rascals and slaves set to work to rob the houses under the mask of Turks, and firebrands were, as it were, thrown about amongst the people of the city. Many Turks entered the mills and took away the mules and worn-out horses and a number of camels belonging to the water-carriers. They plundered, in fact, everything [98] that came in their way, whether dry goods or anything else. The pillaging went on all that day until after sunset.\n\nThen they went to the granaries in Cairo and B\u016bl\u0101k, and plundered the grain which was public property. No one had thought that they would do this, but such was the decree of Fate.\n\nIbn Suw\u0101r was killed at Raid\u0101niyyeh in this engagement, and was buried in his grandfather\u2019s tomb, opposite the tomb of the Daw\u0101d\u0101r Yeshbek.\nSin\u0101n Pasha, Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s Viz\u012br, was also killed. Sheikh Bedr al-D\u012bn al-Zeit\u016bn\u012b wrote this lament:\n\n\u201cWe weep over Egypt and her people\u2014\nHer prosperous places have become desolate, and\nThe once glorious has become the inglorious!\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the last week of the year A.H. 922, the Am\u012br of the Faithful, Mohammed al-Mutewekkil \u2018al\u0101 All\u0101h, entered Cairo, accompanied by Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n\u2019s ministers, and a large force of Turkish soldiers. The following also returned:\n\n1. Malik al-\u2019Umara Kh\u0101ir Bey.\n2. Kcm\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Taw\u012bl, Chief K\u0101d\u012b of the Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b Sect.\n3. The M\u0101lik\u012b K\u0101d\u012b Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn al-Dem\u012br\u012b.\n4. The \u1e24anbali K\u0101d\u012b Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn al-Fut\u016bl\u012b.\n\nAll these had been prisoners of Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n since the death of the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b.\n\nThe Khal\u012bfah entered by the B\u0101b al-Na\u1e63r, and traversed Cairo, preceded by torch-bearers. He announced a public pardon, and general security and continuance of trade. No one was to be molested by the Turkish soldiers. It was further proclaimed that the door of oppression was closed and that of justice opened, and that whoever was found harbouring a Circassian Memlook would be hung forthwith.\n\nThe cry \u201cLong live the victorious King Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h!\u201d was raised on all sides.\n\nThese proclamations were, however, disregarded by the Turks, who fell to plundering people\u2019s houses and even the suburban villas under the pretext of searching for Circassian Memlooks. This pillaging and attacking the houses of the Am\u012brs, soldiers, and people continued for three days. Not a horse nor mule, nor clothing, nor anything great or small was left untouched.\n\nAbout that time Y\u016bnus al-\u2018\u0100dil\u012b returned, and Khushkadam, who had been Inspector of Granaries in Egypt and had fled from al-Gh\u016br\u012b to the Turkish dominions, and had instigated this great rebellion.\nOn Friday the Khu\u1e6dbah was delivered in the name of Sultan Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h from the pulpits in Egypt and Cairo. Some of the preachers in their addresses referred to him as follows: \"God save the Sultan, Ibn al-Sultan, King of the two continents and the two seas; conqueror of the two armies, Sultan of the two Ir\u0101ks, servant of the two sacred cities, the victorious King Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h. O Lord of both worlds, grant that he may ever be victorious.\"\n\nThis brings to a close our account of the events of the year A.H. 922.\n\nThe year ends with war and sorrow\u2014the people are in the direst extremities. All this has come upon them in accordance with the decree of Fate.\n\nThen commenced the year A.H. 923, the first day of Mu\u1e25arram being a Saturday.\n\nTo-day the Sultan Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h sent a body of Janissaries and posted them at the gates of the city to prevent the houses being plundered. After the defeat of the Egyptian army the Sultan Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h moved his camp from Birkah al-H\u0101j Raid\u0101niyyeh. The Turks set to work to catch the Circassian Memlooks, taking them from the tombs and cemeteries and from the gardens of Ma\u1e6dariyyeh, and bringing them before the Sultan, who ordered them to be decapitated.\n\nSome Arab Sheikhs arrested At\u0101bek S\u016bd\u016bn Daw\u0101d\u0101r\u012b and brought him before the Sultan Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h. The latter abused him, and though he found that he was wounded and had a broken thigh, and was in a dying condition, he had no pity on him, but mounted him on a donkey, with a blue turban on his head, and publicly exposed him in his camp. He even intended to exhibit him in Cairo; but he died on the back of the donkey. It was said that they cut off his head after his death and hung it up in the camp. And so this slaughter of the Circassians continued; it was said that over four hundred Circassian slaves and Arabs from the Shar\u1e33\u012beh and Gharb\u012beh provinces were slain.\n\nThen Ibn \u2018Othm\u0101n sent for His Highness Mu\u1e25ammed, son\nof the Sult\u0101n al-Gh\u016br\u012b, and dressed him in a green velvet and gold-embroidered kaft\u0101n, and an \u2018Osmanli turban, and gave him a paper guaranteeing his safety, and issued instructions for him to reside in the college which his father had built at Shar\u0101bish\u012by\u012bn.\n\nThen Am\u012br Y\u016bsuf al-Badr\u012b, the Vizir, went to the Sult\u0101n, received a pardon, was dressed in a velvet k\u0101ft\u0101n, and appointed Superintendent to the Gharbieh provinces. The Sult\u0101n conferred robes of honour on:\n\n1. Am\u012br F\u0101ris Seyfi Tamr\u0101z, and appointed him Inspector of Minieh and other places in the North.\n\n2. Al-Zein\u012b Berek\u0101t Ibn M\u016bs\u0101, and appointed him Inspector of Markets, empowering him to make what appointments he should think fit.\n\nOn Sunday, the 2nd, it was reported that the Sult\u0101n Sel\u012bm Sh\u0101h had moved his camp from Raid\u0101niyyeh to B\u016bl\u0101k, where it occupied the ground from the embankment to the end of the central island, and that the keys of the citadel were brought there; but he preferred to reside on the bank of the Nile.\n\nAs soon as a great many Turks had assembled in Cairo they began to reconnoitre the quarters, streets, and markets, and whenever they met people wearing red caps and small turbans they said to them, \u201cYou are Circassians,\u201d and beheaded them. So the people and even the Am\u012brs and royal princes took to wearing large turbans, and so the light turbans and caps were abolished in Egypt.\n\nOn Monday, the 3rd, the Sult\u0101n formed a cavalcade and entered Cairo by the B\u0101b al-Nasr, and went through the city, preceded by an immense number of led horses and a large force of infantry and cavalry, which occupied the whole of the streets; the procession went through the Zaw\u012blah Gate under the Rab\u2018, and on to B\u016bl\u0101k, to the camp under the embankment. As the Sult\u0101n passed through the city he was cheered by all the populace.\n\nHe was described as having a fair complexion, a clean-shaven chin, and large nose and eyes, as being short in stature,\nand wearing a small turban. He showed levity and restlessness, turning his head from side to side as he rode along. He was said to be about forty years of age. He had not the dignity of former Sult\u0101ns. He was of an evil disposition, blood-thirsty, violent-tempered, and intolerant of being answered. As he passed through Cairo he was preceded by the Khal\u012bfah, the four Judges, and a number of the executive officers. He issued proclamations daily in Cairo, assuring the public of security. Nevertheless, the plundering continued, his proclamations were ignored, and the people suffered extremely in consequence.\n\nAmongst other things related of him was that he had given out at some of his councils in Damascus that on entering Egypt he would burn all the houses and put the people to the sword; but the Khal\u012bfah was said to have induced him to give up that intention, otherwise there was nothing to prevent him carrying out his threat.\n\nThe damage inflicted by the Turks went on to such a degree that some of the upper classes and officials took to getting Turks to stand as guards at their doors, to prevent the spoiling of their houses. The Turks would arrest people in the streets, telling them they were Circassians; and when they declared that they were not, they would tell them to ransom themselves from death, and extort whatever sums of money they chose\u2014so that the people really became their prisoners. The scum and the scoundrels of Egypt used to inform the \u2018Osmanlis of the resources of the princesses and ladies, and their costly clothing was carried off. In short, the treasure houses of the land fell into the hands of the Turks in Egypt, with clothing and weapons, horses, and mules, male and female slaves, and everything of value. They obtained there what they had never had in their own country, and what none of them had ever seen before, not even their great Master.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created":
