J. Fornbauer\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. R. B. [Signature]\nTHE CUSTOM OF POLYANDRY IN CEYLON.\n\nBy R. W. LEVERS.\n\nREGARDING Ceylon literature on this subject, the first notice is in Knox's \"Historical Relation.\" Percival refers to it; and Cordiner writes at more length. As these books are not readily accessible, I have copied the passages in an appendix.*\n\nSir Emerson Tennent has discussed the question in his \"Ceylon\" (vol. II., part IX., chap. II.), and seems to correctly attribute the custom\u2014at least in its survival\u2014to the necessity of keeping the property together under the feudal service tenure which obtained under the Kandyan kings. He notes, however, the antiquity of the custom and its wide diffusion throughout many countries (including Ancient Britain) and amongst the tribes still extant in India, Thibet, Sylhet, Cachar, Mysore, and the Dekkan. The references which he gives may be consulted with profit.\n\nThe writers above-mentioned must be understood to refer to the Sinhalese alone, as there is no evidence that the custom ever existed among the Tamils, who seem to have preferred polygamy.\n\nAnd in speaking of the Sinhalese, their remarks only apply to the Sinhalese race which inhabited the territory ruled by the native kings, which was almost entirely cut off from intercourse with the \"low-country,\" or maritime districts, ruled by the Portugugese and Dutch. The king's territory only came under the British rule in 1815.\n\nUnder the Kandyan Law marriage was contracted by public recognition of the union, when the man and woman\n\n* See Knox's \"Historical Relation,\" 1681, p. 94. Percival: \"An Account of the Island of Ceylon,\" 1803, p. 176. Cordiner: \"A Description of Ceylon,\" 1807, p. 163.\nwent in procession to the house and a cloth was presented to the woman. It was, and still is, legally divorced by mutual consent or adultery or separation of the parties for a period of twelve months.\n\nThere are two kinds of marriage, one called \"Diga,\" in which the woman leaves her paternal home and relinquishes thereby her share in the paternal and maternal property; the other, \"Binna,\" in which a man is received into a family as husband of one of the daughters, in which case the daughter retains her share of the property. But in this case the man's tenure is precarious, as he is liable to be turned out at any time by the family, and \"the wife\" takes another husband, who may be more agreeable to her or to the rest of the family.\n\nIt is obvious that under such customs the disputes as to property of deceased persons were numerous, and the English Law attempted to remedy this by Ordinance No. 3 of 1870, which dealt with Kandyan marriages \"contracted according to the laws, institutions, and customs among the Kandyans,\" as well as for further marriages. To ensure validity the marriage must be registered, stating whether contracted in binna or diga, &c.\n\nHaving been for six years in charge of a Kandyan district (K\u00e9galla), and having to deal with land cases involving rights of inheritance, and having, as Registrar of Kandyan Marriages, to hear divorce cases, I found that the custom of polyandry was almost universal; and that in the case of a marriage registered under the Ordinance the name of the elder brother was given as that of the bridegroom, but every one was aware that the girl would regard the other brothers as being equally her husbands.\n\nMarriage among the Kandyans was a loose tie. It was described in the Legislative Council as being \"contracted with a wink and divorced with a kick.\" And as to polyandry, it was considered as natural and laudable a custom as \"marriage\" itself. In giving evidence as to paternity a\nwitness always spoke of his or her \"loku app\u00e1\" or \"kud\u00e1 app\u00e1,\" i.e., \"elder father\" or \"younger father.\"\n\nI was subsequently in charge of a Province (the North-Central) which, under the name of Nuwarakalawiya, formed part of the Kandyan territory. It is very curious that, although this Province was in some respects the most primitive in Ceylon, I found no custom of polyandry among the people, although it was known to have existed among the chief families, who, of course, were in touch with the families of the up-country Kandyans. The ancient village communal customs still exist there (as in \"the Aryan village\"), and if polyandry were a survival, it would surely be here rather than in the districts which were adjacent to, and more or less influenced by, Europeans.\n\nI am therefore inclined to believe that polyandry was evolved \"in the feudal times, when the rice lands would have gone to destruction during the long absences enforced on the people by the duty of personal attendance on the king and higher chiefs, had not some interested party been left to conduct their village.\"* The last dynasty of Kandyan kings were introduced from South India and obtained their queens from Madura, but it is very unlikely that these South Indian princes and their relatives introduced the custom of polyandry.\n\nIn my opinion, polyandry has not been \"a general system of marriage\" in Ceylon, while it is perfectly certain that \"group marriage\" never existed here during historic times, and the native records go back to the third century B.C. In my experience, the men in a polyandrous marriage were invariably brothers by birth and not by repute. The arrangement was a family one, and did not include connection with a man not a brother of the family. In such a case it would have been considered \"adultery,\" just as much as if it were a modern civilized marriage of one man and one woman. It is true that what we call\n\n* Tennent, loc. cit.\n\"cousins\" call each other \"brother\" and \"sister\" among the Sinhalese, but this is merely a term of affection, and not of actual relationship. It may, however, be noted that marriage of \"first cousins\" is preferred among the Kandyans, while at the same time there is no idea of \"tribal brothers and sisters.\"\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, February 23, 1899.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\n\nMr. R. G. Anthonisz. | Mr. P. Freudenberg.\nMr. A. E. Buultjens. | Mr. J. A. Henderson.\nMr. E. Booth. | Mr. P. E. Morgappah.\nMr. C. Drieberg. | Mr. F. H. Price.\nMr. J. Ferguson. | Dr. V. R. Saravanamuttu.\nMr. R. H. Ferguson. | Mr. G. H. Suhren.\n\nMr. F. C. Roles, Honorary Treasurer.\n\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nVisitors: Twelve gentlemen.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of General Meeting held on August 20, 1898.\n\n2. Mr. Harward read the following:\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1898.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report for the year 1898:\n\nMeetings.\n\nThree General Meetings of this Society were held during the year, at which the following Papers were read and discussed, viz.:\n\n(1) \"Contributions to Ceylon Malacology: Description of a new Helicoid Land Shell from the Southern Province,\" by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n\n(2) \"Aids to the Identification of Ceylon Birds: Part I.\u2014Introduction and Key to the Passeres,\" by A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\n(3) \"A Translation from the Dutch of Cornelis Taay van Wezel's Manuscript on Elephants in Ceylon, 1713,\" by F. H. de Vos, Barrister-at-Law.\n\n(4) \"Don Jeronimo de Azevedo, Governor of Ceylon, 1594\u20131611 A.D.,\" by A. E. Buultjens, B.A.Cantab.\n\nBesides these Papers, a Paper entitled \"Monumental Remains of the Dutch East India Company in Ceylon,\" by F. H. de Vos, was accepted by the Council to be printed, and forms part of the Journal for 1898.\nMembers.\n\nDuring the past year eleven new Members were elected, viz., I. Gunawardene; G. W. Suhren; W. H. Figg; E. E. Green; P. E. Morgappah; H. Fre\u00fcdenberg; J. Pieris; H. O. Barnard; Dr. V. R. Saravanamuttu; C. E. Haslop; and R. M. John.\n\nSix Members resigned, viz., A. E. W. de Livera; W. G. Haines, C.C.S.; N. Tyagar\u00e1ja; A. Tiruvilangam; Dr. J. L. Vanderstraaten; and T. J. Cooke.\n\nThe following names of Members have been removed from the roll for not conforming to No. 30 of the Society's Rules, viz., J. Caderamen, F. W. M. Karunaratne, S. Moonesinha, S. F. Nagapper, and J. P. S. Samarasekera.\n\nMr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner, was elected an Honorary Member in recognition of the valuable services rendered by him to the Society as one of its Honorary Secretaries for a period of seventeen years.\n\nMessrs. T. Berwick, A. M. Gunasekera Mudaliy\u00e1r, and F. C. Roles became Life Members during the year.\n\nThe Society now has on its roll 190 Members, including Sir John J. Grinlinton, 20 Life Members, and 10 Honorary Members.\n\nThe Council record with regret the death of the following Members:\u2014B. G. L. Bremner; R. L. M. Brown; J. M. Perera, J.P.; Dr. P. M. Lisboa Pinto; and J. Lemphers.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year numbered 309 volumes. The acquisitions are chiefly exchanges received from Societies. The Library is indebted for donations to the following:\u2014The Trustees of the Indian Museum; the Government of Bengal; the Government of India; J. P. Lewis, C.C.S.; F. Lewis; the Government of Ceylon; the Government of Madras; the Government of Bombay; the Secretary of State for India in Council; H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S.; the Colombo Museum; the Geological Survey of Canada; the Director of State Archives, the Hague; the Government of North-Western Provinces and Oudh; Ach\u00e1riya Sumanaj\u00f3ti Th\u00e9ra; and A. C. Cavadin, S.J., Bishop of Mangalore.\n\nValuable exchanges have been made during the year with the following Societies, &c.:\u2014The American Oriental Society; Bijl tot de Ta\u00e1l-Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie, the Hague; the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Royal Society of Victoria; the Geological Society of London; the Smithsonian Institution; K. K. Naturhistorischen Hofmuseums, Vienna; the Musee Guimet, Paris; Deutsche Morgenlandische Gesellschaft, Leipzig; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Imperiale des Naturalistes de Moscou; the Anthropological Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Bureau of Education, Washington; the Anthropological Society of Bombay; the Pekin Oriental Society; the Asiatic Society of Bengal; the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the Royal Colonial Institute; the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the University of Upsala; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique, Paris; Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, Batavia; the Royal Society of New South Wales; the Asiatic Society of Japan; South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia.\nThe Council desire to once more draw the attention of the Government to the want of adequate accommodation. Additional room is urgently required; and the necessity for the enlargement of the Museum building has been strongly represented to Government by the Museum Committee. The insufficiency of book room has existed for some years now; attention has been called to the fact more than once, and the Government has admitted the need. The difficulty of finding room for current accessions to the Library becomes daily greater. Confident expectation is entertained that the long-deferred extension of the Museum will be shortly undertaken. This will alone meet the emergency and relieve the congestion apparent everywhere.\n\n**Journals.**\n\nOne Number of the Journal has been published during the year (Vol. XV., No. 48, 1897). It contains, in addition to the Proceedings of the Council and General Meetings, the following Papers:\n\n(i.) \"Contributions to Ceylon Malacology: II.\u2014The Terrestrial Mollusca of Ambagamuwa,\" by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n\n(ii.) \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District: Dambadeniya,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\n(iii.) \"A Geological and Mineralogical Sketch of the North-Western Province, Ceylon,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\n(iv.) \"Some Illustrations from the Fauna of Ceylon of Wallace's Theory of Natural Selection,\" by A. Haly.\n\n(v.) \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey at Sigiriya (Third Season), 1897,\" by H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S.\n\nThe printing of the Journal for 1898, No. 49, is nearly complete; and it will be issued shortly.\n\n**Archaeology.**\n\nThe Council regret that this number will not contain the continuation of the Archaeological Commissioner's Interim Reports on Sigiriya, which have formed so interesting a feature in the recent numbers of the Journal. Further report has been deferred by the Commissioner, so as to include in it an account of final operations (undertaken by the directions of the Government) which are being carried on during the present year.\n\nThe study of the Archaeology of Ceylon is one of the most important of the objects of this Society, and it was mainly due to the activity of this Society that the Government of Ceylon decided to prosecute Archaeological research systematically by appointing an Archaeological Commissioner. A brief annual summary of the work kindly furnished by the Commissioner has for some years formed an important feature in the Society's Annual Report. The Commissioner has now been called upon to furnish the Government annually with a short general Administration Report, independent of Progress Reports issued from time to time, as plans, &c., are made ready. We are glad, however, to state that this will not prevent him from furnishing the Society with the usual annual summary, the publication of which in our Journal gives information as to the progress of the Commissioner's work to many readers who would be unlikely to see the official Administration Report.\nThe Archaeological Commissioner has favoured the Council with the following synopsis of work done by the Archaeological Survey during 1898:\n\n**Anur\u00e1dhapura.**\n\nComparatively little progress was made at Anur\u00e1dhapura last year, owing to the absence of the Archaeological Commissioner and his labour force at Sigiriya for seven months. Excavations were continued between Ruwanveli and Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma and at \u201cEll\u00e1la Sohona.\u201d On the \u201cY Road\u201d a solitary ruin of brick and mortar was unearthed. It proves to be an ancient Tamil k\u00f3vil.\n\n**Sigiriya.**\n\nThe usual season of four months was prolonged to August, in order to virtually close excavations upon, and at the base of, the Rock at Sigiriya. A good deal of work remains to be done in and near, the ancient Nuwara surrounding Sigiri-gala.\n\nThe maluwa, or uppermost terrace, at the foot of the present iron ladders on the north of the Rock was thoroughly laid bare, disclosing the claws of the once colossal brick and stucco lion, through whose jaws and body the covered staircase was carried upwards to the summit. The Mah\u00e1va\u1e47sa explanation of the name Siha-giri, or \u201cLion Rock,\u201d is thus fully justified. To the west of the Rock the terraces lying between the northern and southern stairways leading to the gallery were very completely excavated, as well as the caves beneath the boulders scattered round the \u201cAudience Hall Rock.\u201d\n\nThe floor and inner wall of the unique gallery itself have been strongly repaired to save them, as far as practicable, from further wear, and the wing walls of the south staircase\u2014the only possible approach nowadays\u2014partially rebuilt for greater security.\n\nThe Government has decided to conserve the whole area formerly covered by Sigiri Nuwara. The jungle will be kept down annually, and the excavations cleaned.\n\n**Circuit.**\n\nNo regular circuit work was attempted in 1898.\n\n**Clearing of Jungle at Anur\u00e1dhapura.**\n\nThe Government, recognizing the importance of further opening out the jungle-bound ruins of Anur\u00e1dhapura, sanctioned in 1898 an extra vote of Rs. 2,000 for the purpose. With this sum, and a moiety of the annual grant, the Archaeological Commissioner was enabled to clear and burn 500 acres and upwards of jungle outside the town. A similar vote has been allowed for the current year.\n\n**Reorganization of the Archaeological Survey.**\n\nUpon the recommendations of a Commission appointed by His Excellency the Governor, which have been approved, the Archaeological Survey will be materially strengthened from 1899.\n\nA Labour Assistant has, at length, been given to the Commissioner, relieving him of much of the outdoor and mechanical work which has hitherto unduly taxed his time for research, and delayed the publication of Progress Reports.\n\nIn addition, Messrs.

Bell, C.C.S.; Mr. J. Harward, M.A.; and Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nMr. Price, in putting the motion to the vote, said he took it for granted that those present approved of the election of the Members specified in the list. They saw from the Report just read how extremely well managed were the affairs of the Society for the past year. Not having the list of Members of Council for 1898 before him he imagined that the Members whose election he had just proposed were more or less identical with the Members for the past year. However that might be, he felt sure that the Members of the Society present would unanimously agree to elect the Members whose names he had just read.\n\nThe Chairman said he must thank them once more, on behalf of the Office-Bearers of the Society, for the honour which they had done in electing them. In many instances there was a great advantage in the re-appointment of those who had familiarized themselves with the working of an institution, and who had proved their willingness to attend the Meetings, and to give their time and interest to the objects of the institution. In some of their Office-Bearers that had evidently been the case; and he was sure the Society did right in re-electing the Treasurer, who had with so much real devotion to the interests of the Society performed with success during the past year the sometimes unpleasant task of \u201cdunning\u201d Members. It was a very satisfactory thing that they were able to hear in the Report that they need not be returning again persistently to that subject. However he had pleasure in dwelling upon it, as an illustration of the energy and zeal with which their Treasurer discharged the duty of his office. The Honorary Secretaries also were men who had served the Society very creditably. The two who were present, whose interest was unfailing, and whose care of their part of the business of the Society was most thorough and intimate, were, he thought, indispensable to the Society; and not least the-\nSecretary who surveyed all their views with most intelligent interest from a distance, and whose contributions, though they were comparatively few, were among the most valuable received: he meant Mr. Bell. He might mention, on behalf of the Members whom they had done the honour of re-electing, that they were also remarkably regular in their attendance, and although there were some Members of that Council who had dropped out through paucity of attendance, the remainder\u2014a large majority\u2014were remarkably regular; and, considering that these were men who were extremely busy, but who came in the afternoon and spent an hour or two there, they ought to feel indebted to them. There was only one Member on the list of officers whom it would be of great advantage to have afresh year after year, and that was the President. (\"No, no.\") He had the great pleasure of thanking them many times for his re-election; but he always felt that it was accompanied by a very serious disadvantage\u2014that was that they got no Presidential Address. He was very sorry for it, and he wished he could produce one annually. It must be remembered as his excuse that in those learned Societies at whose Annual Meetings the Presidential Address formed part, there was a new President each time. In conclusion, he tendered his apology if he had not been able to properly discharge in that particular the office of President. (Applause.)\n\n5. Mr. G. A. Joseph read portions of the following Note and Appendix:\u2014\nANTIQUARIAN DISCOVERY RELATING TO THE PORTUGUESE IN CEYLON.\n\nIn September, 1898, the attention of His Excellency the Governor was directed by His Excellency Monsignor Zaleski, the Delegate Apostolic, to the discovery of a Portuguese coat of arms with date 1501 (apparently) inscribed on a rock at the site of the old Breakwater Office in the Fort of Colombo.\n\nThe correspondence regarding the discovery was referred by the Director of the Colombo Museum to some gentlemen for their opinions; and interesting information of historical value has been elicited.\n\nAt the request of the Director of the Colombo Museum, the Government has placed the correspondence at the disposal of the Society with a view to publication.\n\nFrom the correspondence the following is selected, as bearing directly on the subject and recording facts of antiquarian interest. The letters, &c., are published in order to put on record information of value to the student of history, and also in the hope that further light may be thrown upon the interesting discovery.\n\nPr\u00e9cis of Appendix.\n\nI.\u2014Letter from the Delegate Apostolic to His Excellency the Governor drawing attention to the discovery of the stone.\n\nII.\u2014Account in the Ceylon Independent of September 7, 1898, regarding the discovery.\n\nIII.\u2014Report of the Assistant Engineer, Colombo, describing the boulder and forwarding photographs.*\n\nIV.\u2014Letter from Mr. Advocate F.

If the fact is rightly described, the discovery would be very interesting from an archaeological point of view, and would mean a rather important historical relic of Ceylon. The old Portuguese chronicles relate that when Don Lourenzo de Almeida, son of the Viceroy Don Francisco, and leader of the first Portuguese expedition to this Island, was about to leave Ceylon in December, 1505, he had the coat of arms of Portugal carved on a rock at the entrance of Colombo harbour.\n\nThe date 1501 given by the paper must be a mistake. The Portuguese coat of arms bearing this date may be found in Ceylon.\n\nI beg to remain, &c.,\n\nLADISLAUS MICHAEL,\nArchbishop of Thebes and Delegate Apostolic.\n\nII.\u2014Account in the *Ceylon Independent*, September 7, 1898.\n\nFootprints of Portugal.\u2014The old building at the root of the Breakwater, which for years did duty as headquarters of the Harbour Police, had always borne the reputation of being haunted, and a number of weird stories are related of the uncanny phantom one might meet about the spot. On Monday, while the coolies were at the work of demolishing the structure, a curious bit of engraving came to light. One of the large rocks at the bottom of the building was found to have carved on it an excellently executed Portuguese coat of arms, looking no older than a month, with the date 1501 rudely, but quite legibly, carved to the right of it. In the vicinity of the stone there were found a few human mouldy bones, which were taken by those acquainted with the tales of ghosts as evidence of their credibility. The discovery\nAntiquarian discovery under site of old Breakwater Office, Colombo.\nof the bones will, it is believed by the more superstitious, lay the ghost for ever. There is little doubt that the coolies are just now excavating about the grave of some Portuguese grandee of the beginning of the sixteenth century, to mark whose resting place the stone was placed by it, with the coat of arms carved on it. Nothing beyond bones have been found at the spot, and the Portuguese coat of arms with the date on it is the only but sufficiently acceptable evidence that the grave belongs to one of this Island's Portuguese conquerors.\n\nIII.\u2014Report of the Assistant Engineer, Colombo.\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith three photographs of the interesting discovery referred to, and to state that the shield and cross are cut on the north-east side of one of a series of large boulders, which were found under the site on which the old Breakwater offices stood. The boulder on which the shield is cut weighs about five tons. The upper portion of the shield is rather indistinct, evidently due to exposure for many years to the action of the weather before the boulder was covered with earth. At the foot of the boulder, in a recess under it, a few human bones were found.\n\nIV.\u2014Mr. F. H. de Vos to Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nGalle, November 9, 1893.\n\nSir,\u2014Referring to your letter No. 172 of the 8th instant, I have the honour to state that the arms in question are those of Portugal, and may be blazoned thus:\u2014\n\nDe ......... \u00e0 cinq \u00e9cussons 2, 1, 2, charg. chacun de cinq bes. 2, 1, 2, \u00e0 la bord de ......... ch. de sept tours, 3, 2, 2. Crest : une couronne surmont\u00e9e d'une croix patt\u00e9e.\n\nThe colours not being indicated, I have not supplied them.\n\nA stone slab bearing the same arms, but without the cross, was discovered by the Archaeological Commissioner at Menikkadawara (see Sessional Papers, Ceylon, 1891, Antiquarian Research, K\u00e9galla, p. 31, where a sketch of it is to be found). The \"croix patt\u00e9e,\" I think, is for the Order of Christ.\n\nIt is strange, however, that the \"\u00e9cussons\" should be placed 2, 1, 2 (saltire-wise), and not 1, 3, 1 (cross-wise), because the latter, I think, would be the correct way of depicting them, unless of course it be the fact (of which, however, I am unaware) that at a date early in the sixteenth century these charges were borne saltire-wise in the Royal arms of Portugal.\n\nI have looked into the original Portuguese of Cameons referred to by the Archaeological Commissioner in his report (page 31), and it is\nclear from him that the escutcheons should be, as he says, \"em cruz,\" or cross-wise (Os Lusiadas, canto III., lii. and liv.). The besants are, however, correctly placed saltire-wise.\n\nAs regards the characters 1501, they may either stand for the date 1501 or for some such words as \"Jesus Salvator Orientalium Indicorum.\" Here arises a difficulty. The Portuguese and Dutch historians of Ceylon fix the date of the arrival of the Portuguese in Ceylon as 1505, although they do not seem to be agreed whether they (the Portuguese) first landed at Galle or at Colombo (see *Ceylon Literary Register*, vol. IV., p. 188, 1896; vol. III., pp. 133, 143, and 180).\n\nI should, however, hesitate before I conclude that 1501 is a mistake. According to Mr. C. A. L. van Troostenburg de Bruyn, in his *Hervormde Kerke* (Reformed Church), p. 1, Vasco de Gama left Portugal for the East in 1497, taking with him in his ship two \"Trinitarian\" monks. One died on the voyage, the other, Pedro de Corilham, landed with him at Calicut on May 9, 1498, but suffered martyrdom the same year. So that three years previous to 1501 a Christian Mission was started in India not far from Ceylon.\n\nThe cross also is significant, and points to the engraving on the rock being the work of a Christian Mission to Ceylon about the year 1501.\n\nVasco de Gama's second voyage to the East was in 1502, when he took with him some missionaries of the Franciscan Order. It might be he touched at Colombo on his return voyage, which must have been about 1501. It must be noted that the cross is not so well engraved as the rest of the arms, being evidently done in a hurry.\n\nI venture to suggest that an ornamental railing should be put round the rock, and this very interesting relic of past times be thus preserved.\n\nI am, &c.,\nF. H. de Vos.\n\n---\n\nV.\u2014Mr. A. E. Buultjens to Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nColombo, November 25, 1898.\n\nSir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 14th instant on the above subject, I have the honour to send you some information (translations) from the Portuguese authors, and if I am permitted to make a personal examination of the boulder, I might be in a position to throw more light on the subject.\n\n2. Three questions suggest themselves with regard to the discovery:\n\n(a) What signification had the coat of arms, the cross, and the date?\n(b) Who engraved them?\n(c) At what time?\n(a) The historical evidence from the Portuguese authors, Joao de Barros and De Couto, abundantly proves that the boulder was not inscribed on to mark the site of the grave of a Portuguese grandee as has been conjectured, but was undoubtedly the *padrao*, which the Portuguese Lexicographer Vieyra explains as a post or pillar on which they engrave an inscription, as discoverers used to do in those countries they newly discovered. I have translated from the Portuguese those passages which bear upon the subject, from which may be seen that the *padrao* usually contained the escutcheon of the Royal arms of Portugal, the cross, the date, and several other particulars (*vide* Extracts A and B).\n\nThe first of these *padraos* was set up by order of the King of Portugal in 1484 at the river Congo. Vasco de Gama set up one in 1497 at Melinda, in East Africa, as a testimony of peace and friendship with that king (*vide* Extract C).\n\n(b) With regard to the question, who engraved the particular *padrao* now discovered at Colombo, there seems to be hardly any doubt, for we have a graphic description (*vide* Extract G) of how Gonzalo Gonzaives engraved a *padrao* at Colombo, by order of Don Lourenco, and put his name at the foot of it. The name is not visible yet, perhaps because immediately after the departure of the Portuguese ships the natives were incited by the Moors to kindle a large fire at the foot of the *padrao* and efface all trace of the Portuguese visit (*vide* Extract H). This *padrao* was put up in 1505, and was seen there in 1508 by the Portuguese Captain Nuno Vaz Pereira (*vide* Extract I).\n\n(c) As regards the date 1501, it must be a mistake, unless indeed two *padraos* were set up: one in 1501 by an unknown adventurous Portuguese sea captain, and another by Don Lourenco in 1505, which still remains to be brought to light; or it may be that one of the thirty captains who went to India as far south as Cochin with Pedralvares Cabral in 1500\u20131501, or one of the four captains who accompanied Joao de Nova in 1501\u20131502 (*vide* Extracts D and E), to all of whom Ceylon was well known, was the real discoverer in 1501, but that the honour and glory of the discovery were attributed to Don Lourenco, the son of the first Viceroy of India.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nA. E. Buultjens.\n\nTranslation of Portuguese Extracts.\n\nExtract A.\n\nAt first crosses of wood were set up as a sign of the discovery of new lands. Afterwards King Don John II., in his time, ordered monuments of stone with inscriptions, in which were mentioned the\ntime and by whom that country was discovered, and that was sufficient for royal possession (De Barros and De Couto, *Da Asia*, Dec. I., lib. II., chap. II., p. 148).\n\n**Extract B.**\n\n1484 A.D.\u2014The King Don Affonso ordered that Diogo Cam should take a monument of stone of the height of two men, with the escutcheon of the Royal arms of Portugal, and on the sides of it an inscription in Latin and another in Portuguese, which stated that the king sent him to discover that land; and at what time and by what captain that monument was set up there; and lastly, at the top a cross of stone inlaid with lead. And the first discoverer who took that monument was Diogo Cam, Knight of the Royal House, in the year 1484...........and he reached a famous river (in Congo), at the mouth of which he set up that monument, as he had taken possession of all that coast on behalf of the king. (Dec. I., lib. III., chap. III., p. 171.)\n\n**Extract C.**\n\n1497-1499 A.D.\u2014Vasco de Gama sailed from Lisbon in 1497, and after passing the Cape of Good Hope set up a *padr\u00e3o* on the east coast of Africa at Melinda, whence he sailed to India in April, 1498. This *padr\u00e3o* was set up with the consent of the King of Melinda, in the name of the Holy Spirit, as a testimony of peace and friendship with him. He remained at Calicut in India for some time, and reached Lisbon in July, 1499. (Dec. I., lib. IV., chap. II., pp. 276, 321.)\n\n**Extract D.**\n\n1500-1501 A.D.\u2014Pedralvares Cabral sailed from Lisbon on March 8, 1500, with 30 ships, reached Calicut where he remained for about three months, and went as far south as Cochin. Here he saw a vessel come from the Island of Ceylon with seven elephants, which were taken as merchandise by the Moors for the King of Cambaya; and news was brought that another ship had left the harbour of Ceylon laden with all sorts of spiceries. Pedralvares Cabral left India for Lisbon at the end of January, 1501. (Dec. I., lib. V., chap. VI., pp. 425, 459.)\n\n**Extract E.**\n\n1501-1502 A.D.\u2014King Don Manuel sent an armada of four ships under John de Nova, which reached Cochin, and returned to Lisbon on September 7, 1502. It was customary to send an armada every year to India from Lisbon in March.\n\n1501 A.D.\u2014King Don Manuel took the title of \"Lord of Navigation, Conquest, and Commerce,\" in 1501, after the arrival of Vasco de Gama, and especially of Pedralvares Cabral, who had in effect taken possession of all what was discovered, in accordance with the gift and grant of His Eminence the Pope (p. 11) ......... The second way of commerce at this time was that terms were agreed upon for ever with the king\nand the sovereigns of the country, that for a certain price they should give us their merchandise and receive ours, just as was agreed to with the kings of Cananor, Challe, Cochin, Coulon, and Ceylon, which are the chief places for all sorts of spiceries in India. But this method of contract is only as regards the spiceries which they give to the officers of the king, who reside there in their warehouses, for the cargo of the ships which go to that kingdom. (Dec. I., lib. VI., chap. I., pp. 11, 18, 19.)\n\nExtract F.\n\n1502-1504 A.D.\u2014Vasco de Gama went to India on his second voyage and reached as far south as Cochin in 1502. Affonso de Albuquerque in 1503 and Lopo Suares in 1504 were the captains of the annual fleet of ships to India, but neither of them touched Ceylon, although the produce of this Island, especially cinnamon and rubies (p. 177), had been known in Europe before the Portuguese came to Ceylon.\n\n1505 A.D.\u2014Don Francisco de Almeida was sent to reside in India as Captain-General, and was afterwards entitled Viceroy of India. Upon the occasion when he made solemn covenant with the King of Cochin an inscription was made on a padr\u00e3o that a yearly payment of six hundred cruzados* would be made by the latter. (Dec. I., lib. IX., chap. V., p. 356.)\n\nExtract G.\n\n1505 A.D.\u2014And therefore Don Lourenco asked some people of the country [Colombo] to come, and with their consent he set up a padr\u00e3o of stone on a boulder, and on it he ordered to inscribe a device to show that he had come there and discovered that island. Since Hercules cannot boast to himself with regard to the padr\u00f5es of his discovery; Gonzalo Gonzalves, who was the engineer of the work, had in this matter so great glory, since he placed his own name at the foot of it. And so Gonzalo Gonzalves became more truly the architect of that column than Hercules of the many which the Greeks attribute to him in their writings. (Dec. I., lib. X., chap. V., p. 425.)\n\nExtract H.\n\nAfter Don Lourenco set out for Cochin, one of his captains, Nuno Vaz Pereira, had the great yard of his ship broken in a storm, and he was therefore obliged, in order to repair it, to return once more to the harbour [Colombo], where he found that our padr\u00e3o was already singed by the fire which had been placed at the foot of it. Upon inquiring into the reason of this, the Moors who were there laid the blame upon the heathens of the country, saying that they were an idolatrous nation and had some superstitious reason for what they did. Nuno Vaz having admonished them about the matter by way of threats that they\n\n* Cruzado = two shillings and threepence.\nshould continue that no more, dissimulated about what had happened, and having repaired the yard of his ship returned to Don Lourenco, whom he met on the coast of India. (Dec. I., lib. X., chap. V., p. 429.)\n\nExtract I.\n\n1508 A.D.\u2014The Viceroy, Don Francisco de Almeida, sent Nuno Vaz Pereira in the ship Sancto Espirito to the Island of Ceylon to bring cinnamon, but he did not succeed, for the reason that the king of the country was very ill, and the Moors had corrupted the people to hatred against us. And though Nuno Vaz could have done harm to them by taking thither a regiment of the Viceroy, yet he did not make war by reason of the peace which his son Don Lourenco had agreed to, and of which there stood as a testimony the padrao, which was left behind at a place in Colombo, whither Nuno Vaz went. (Dec. II., lib. II., chap. I., pp. 228, 229.)\n\nVI.\u2014His Excellency the Delegate Apostolic to His Excellency the Governor.\n\nKandy, December 13, 1898.\n\nYour Excellency,\u2014I have received Your Excellency\u2019s letter of the 8th of this month, together with a copy of Mr. A. E. Buultjens\u2019 able remarks regarding the archeological discovery at the Colombo Breakwater.\n\nI have no objection whatever to my few remarks on the subject being communicated to the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nI beg to add to the extracts from Barros, given by Mr. Buultjens, a quotation from the manuscript of F. Fernao de Queiroz written in 1687, which shows that at this date the said stone with the Portuguese coat of arms was known and still exposed to public view.*\n\nThe stone cannot be properly called a padrao. The padrao had the shape of a pillar, as shown by those which still exist on the African coasts. On their voyages of discovery the Portuguese used to take with them ready-made padraos, to be placed on the shores of newly discovered countries of which they took possession.\n\nD. Lourenzo de Almeida had not provided himself with a padrao, as the end of his expedition was the Maldive Islands, and he landed at Ceylon accidentally, brought there by a storm.\n\nHe had therefore to content himself with engraving the traditional coat of arms on a boulder (rocha).\n\nWe have the example of another Portuguese coat of arms engraved on a boulder which can still be seen near the Zambezi falls.\n\n* Vide extract on next page.\nAs regards the date engraved on the rock, it seems to me clear enough to be 1561, not 1501.*\n\nIt is evident that the cross and the date are of another workmanship, and if examined seem to have been made with other rougher tools. They were probably added after the burial of the body whose bones were found on the spot, and which were not those of any Portuguese grandee, as they would have given him a more decent sepulchre. The place, on or about the above stated date, was the common Catholic burial ground of Colombo.\n\nI have carefully examined the stone to see if there be not some traces of the inscription of Gonzalo Gonzalves mentioned by Barros. I could see nothing on the stone, which is broken, or rather split; but afterwards examining the photograph of the stone through a magnifying glass (as obliterated inscriptions on stone appear often more clearly on photographs), I believe there can be seen at the left side of the splitting the trace of five letters, of which two only (N.S.) are legible and complete. The thing should be examined on the spot.\n\nIn any case the discovery would lose all its historical importance if removed from the spot; and if its removal should prove an unavoidable necessity, the stone should at least be placed in the nearest vicinity of its original site.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nLADISLAUS MICHAEL,\nArchbishop of Thebes and Delegate Apostolic.\n\nExtract referred to.\n\nO Capitao Mor ...... mandou abrir em uma rocha defronte da Bahia as quinas de Portugal memoria q. posto che gasta do tempo no nossa sempre alli permanecio.\n\nFernao de Queiroz\nConquista de Ceylao\nLivro 2, Capitulo 1.\n\n* His Excellency the Delegate Apostolic, in a previous letter dated November 15, 1898, before he inspected the stone, states: \"The carving of the Royal coat of arms on a rock was considered by the ancient Portuguese navigators as a very solemn act, something like hoisting the national flag, and there was no reason whatever to carve it in the year 1561, which was rather a dull and uneventful one in the history of the Portuguese in Ceylon.\"\u2014G. A. J.\nVII.\u2014Mr. F. H. de Vos to Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nI have read uncorrected proof of correspondence relative to the Portuguese Arms engraved on the rock recently discovered in the Fort of Colombo, and should like to offer the following remarks:\n\nAs regards the symbols,\n\n\\[ \\text{ISOL} \\]\n\n(which are, by the way, not correctly reproduced in the lithograph), it will appear that the first two are dotted with a small cross and the third with a round dot, and the fourth has no dot at all. If these symbols stand for 1501 the first and fourth symbols should be similarly written, but they are not. Then, why should the first two symbols be dotted with a cross unless they stand for \"Jesus Salvator\"? If the fourth symbol be taken to be the ninth letter of the alphabet, this will explain why it differs from the first symbol.\n\nAgain, was it customary in those days (circa 1500) to dot numerals? This can be answered by an expert on manuscript and handwriting of that age.\n\nVIII.\u2014Mr. A. E. Buultjens to Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nI have since carefully examined the stone on the spot more than once. It seems quite clear that on the right of the coat of arms what we find is the date 1501, and not the letters ISOI, nor the date 1561. True, there is a dot over the left of the O, but this cannot be a part of the figure 6, because there is clearly no line joining the dot to the O, and the surface between the dot and the O is level and intact. The conjecture that these are the letters ISOI, meaning \"Jesus Salvador Orientalium Indicorum,\" is certainly most ingenious; but Mr. de Vos has not given us any authority to corroborate his opinion and to show that the initial letters of the Latin phrase were used at any period of Portuguese history in connection with missions or discoveries. To me the second figure is clearly a 5, which was undoubtedly written in that way two or three centuries ago. For proof I would refer to the pages of Valentyn's Ceylon, p. 68, 73, &c., and to De Barros and Knox for several examples of 5 written like the one on the stone.\n\nIn the absence of any other evidence than what I have produced from De Barros, the conclusion is irresistible that the discovery is the identical padr\u00e3o of Don Lourenco mentioned by the contemporary writer De Barros, whose first decade was published in 1553. His Excellency the Delegate Apostolic, to whom our thanks are due for having invited public attention to the discovery, is of opinion that the\nstone cannot be properly called a *padrao* because it has not the shape of a pillar. But the essential part of the *padrao* is not the shape, but the fact of its containing the coat of arms, the cross, and the date, for Vierya further explains *padrao* as \"a monument, a memorial for after ages, a pillar, &c., raised in memory of some famous action.\" Nor is it historically true that Don Lourenco landed in Ceylon accidentally, for he was purposely sent by his father, the Viceroy of India, to discover the Island of Ceylon.* Don Lourenco was sent to Ceylon for three purposes: to discover the ships of the Moors, to obtain cinnamon, and to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship with the King of Ceylon. For carrying out this last object Don Lourenco sent to the King of Ceylon an ambassador, Payo de Souza, who was accompanied by the Secretary, Diogo Velho, and Fernao Cotrim and other persons, and though this embassy was partly unsuccessful through the trick of the Moors, yet we read (from Extract G) that Don Lourenco thought himself justified in setting up the *padrao*, a term applied by De Barros himself to the one set up by Don Lourenco:\u2014\"Metteo hum *padrao* de pedra em hum penedo\" (p. 425), and again, \"Onde achou que o nossa *padrao* estava ja chamuscado de fogo,\" p. 429.\n\nThe only difficulty is the puzzle as to why we have the date 1501 instead of the date 1505, which was the date of Lourenco's visit to Ceylon, according to both De Barros and Valentyn, who says, \"Don Lourenco came to Ceylon in 1505, and was the first Portuguese who came there.\" On mature consideration the difficulty disappears, for 1501 was the actual date of the discovery of Ceylon by the Portuguese. Ceylon was first known to the Portuguese in 1501. It is not mentioned earlier than 1501 in the long accounts of De Barros of the voyage of Vasco de Gama. It was in 1501 that Pedro Alvares Cabral, while at Cochin, first heard of Ceylon, for he saw a vessel from Ceylon with elephants and heard of another from Ceylon laden with spices in 1501 (Extract D). It was in 1501 that a treaty of commerce between the Portuguese and the King of Ceylon was made by Pedro Alvares Cabral. It was in 1501, after the return of this Captain to Lisbon, that King Don Manual of Portugal solemnly took the title of Lord of Navigation, Conquest, and Commerce in Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India. For these reasons I conclude that the date 1501 was inscribed upon the stone by Gonzalo Gonzalves deliberately to mark the date of the first discovery of Ceylon, and not the date of Don Lourenco's visit. Had Don Lourenco ordered the date 1505 to be inscribed as the date of discovery, that would have been an historical mistake, for the order of King Don John II. was that the time of discovery be inscribed on the *padrao*.\n\n---\n\n* O Viso-Rey como soube parte deste novo caminho que elles faziam, e assi da Ilha Ceilao, onde elles carregavam de canella ......... e ter des cuberto aquelle Ilha, e assi as de Maldiva, ......... determininon mandar seu filho D. Lourenco a este negocio. *De Barros*, Dec. 1, lib. X. cap. V., p. 424.\nIX.\u2014Note by Mr. D. W. Ferguson.*\n\nMr. Bell, Honorary Secretary, C. B. R. A. S., has asked me to give my views regarding the inscribed boulder discovered in September, 1898, under the site of the old Breakwater Office, Colombo. I am, however, somewhat at a disadvantage, as I am not able to inspect the boulder *in situ*, nor have I a photograph of the coat of arms and date (or letters) regarding which my opinion is asked. I have before me simply the lithographic drawing accompanying the Paper read at the Annual Meeting of the Society on February 23, 1899; and how far this is an accurate representation I am unable to judge.\n\nI have read carefully the letters of the Delegate Apostolic and of Messrs. F. H. de Vos and A. E. Buultjens. The so-called \"translations\" which the latter appends to his letter are mostly statements in his own words and are full of inaccuracies.\u2020\n\nMr. De Vos's remarks are worth consideration, though even he has fallen into some errors.\u2021\n\nI am unable to explain the saltire-wise arrangement of the escutcheons found in this stone and the Menikkadawara one. The two \"Trinitarian monks\" taken by Vasco de Gama in 1497 are held to be mythical by the best authorities (see *Vasco de Gama's First Voyage*, Hakluyt Soc., 1898, p. 177). Moreover, Vasco de Gama returned to Portugal in 1498, and not in 1501, as Mr. De Vos supposes.\n\nThe Delegate Apostolic quotes a passage from an unpublished manuscript by Fernao de Queiroz, written in 1687, which, he says, \"shows that at this date the said stone with the Portuguese coat of arms was known and still exposed to public view.\" The extract is so misprinted in the proof sent to me that I cannot be sure of the sense; but, if the Delegate Apostolic is correct as to its meaning, how is it that no other writers refer to this boulder? Whence did Fernao de Queiroz, so late a writer, get his information; and who was the \"Capitao M\u00f3r\" he speaks of? The statements of the Delegate Apostolic regarding Lourenco de Almeida's not having a *padrao* with him when he arrived at Ceylon, and having therefore to content himself with engraving the coat of arms on a rock, are contradicted by all the Portuguese historians.\n\nFor many years past the subject of the first visit of the Portuguese to Ceylon has occupied my attention, and I think I can assert with absolute confidence that Lourenco de Almeida's envoys were the very\n\n---\n\n* Received since the Annual General Meeting.\u2014Hon. Sec.\n\n\u2020 At paragraph (a) of his letter he refers to De Couto as an authority for the period under discussion, and quotes Vieyra in one line to contradict the assertion he confidently makes in the line before. The last paragraph of his letter is not reliable.\n\n\u2021 I do not know why Mr. De Vos describes the coat of arms in French; the jargon of English heraldry would have done as well.\nfirst Portuguese who ever set foot on the Island. The matter is too lengthy to be discussed in a note like the present, but I have abundant authority to prove my statement. That the date on the boulder is 1501 is, therefore, impossible.\n\nAs Mr. De Vos has pointed out, there is a conflict of opinion among the Portuguese historians as to the place where Don Lourenco landed and the date of the event. Costanheda implies that it was at Galle in November or December, 1505; Barros that it was at Galle about the middle of 1506; and Correa that it was at Colombo on August 18 or 19, 1506. All my attempts to discover the facts have, so far, been in vain.\n\nFrom the passages in the Ceylon Literary Register mentioned by Mr. De Vos, as well as that on page 149 of vol. III., it will be seen that the padr\u00e3o erected by D. Lourenco de Almeida was still standing in 1508, but had been destroyed by the \u201cMoors\u201d within the next decade.\n\nI cannot at present throw any further light on the inscribed boulder; but, in this connection, I may draw attention to the old tombstone, now in the Colombo Museum, described in vol. I. of the Monthly Literary Register, p. 14.\n\nD. W. Ferguson.\n\nCroydon, March 25, 1899.\n\nMr. Harward said he inclined to the view of Mr. de Vos, that the cross and lettering (not figures or date) were added to the boulder long after the coat of arms.\n\nMr. Price had inspected the stone and considered that different workmanship, probably at different times, was represented in this coat of arms as against the date.\n\nThe President suggested that it was possible a clever workman might have worked at the coat of arms and an inferior one on this date, and that further investigation should be directed to comparing other Portuguese figures of that particular age with those on the boulder, and noting whether they were shaped in the same way.\n\nMr. J. Ferguson said:\u2014It was his pleasing duty to propose a cordial vote of thanks to his Lordship the Bishop of Colombo for presiding over the Meeting that evening. With reference to what his Lordship had said about being their President for another year, and which office he had so pleasantly and cordially accepted, he might say that in their opinion the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society had never had an abler President, and could not find another in the Island more fit to preside over it. (Hear, hear.) If there had been a lack of Presidential Addresses, he might state the blame was more with the Members of the Society than with the President. There had been a great lack of Papers for some time, and it was impossible to expect their President to prepare an Address for them if they did not supply the means\u2014it would be like requiring him to make bricks without straw. He hoped that in the coming sessions Members\u2014young as well as old\u2014would send in more Papers. He could testify to the patience and attention his Lordship had given to the work of the Society, and\nalso at the Meetings of the Council, in dealing with the various Papers that were brought before him as President of that Society. He begged to offer, on behalf of those present, a cordial vote of thanks. (Applause.)\n\nThe Chairman thanked Mr. Ferguson for the very kind way in which he had proposed the vote of thanks, and the Members for the way in which they received it. He was very glad to hear the Secretary report that they had a considerable number of Papers in hand, and expected to have two or three good Meetings soon.\n\nThe proceedings then came to a close.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, March 15, 1899.\n\nPresent:\nMr. Staniforth Green, Vice-President, in the Chair.\nMr. J.

It was announced that since the last General Meeting Mr. K. S. Bhat, B.A., Mangalore, India, had been elected a Non-Resident Member.\n\n3. Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nA LETTER FROM THE KING OF PORTUGAL TO RAJA SINHA II.\n\nBy D. W. Ferguson.\n\nOn the 10th of January, 1645, the ten years' truce agreed to by the King of Portugal and the States-General of Holland was proclaimed in Colombo amid general rejoicing. Two years of the truce had, however, already expired; so that in Ceylon it was to have effect for only eight years. During this period the Portuguese, under the lax rule of the aged Manuel Mascarenhas Homem, took matters very easily; while the Dutch, on the other hand, were continually making preparations for a renewal of hostilities.\n\nIn writing to the Viceroy of India on 6th March, 1649, and 15th February, 1650, the king urged the greatest vigilance, as no faith was to be put in either the Dutch or the King of Kandy; and on 14th March, 1652, in acknowledging the receipt of a letter of 24th December, 1650, from the late Viceroy, Dom Philippe Mascarenhas, he wrote to the newly-appointed Viceroy, the Conde de Obidos,* impressing upon him the need of continuing this attitude of watchfulness and being ready to succour Ceylon at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIn addition to this letter the king addressed the following two to the Viceroy, with one to R\u00e1ja Sinha himself. This last epistle appears to be the only one that has come down to us of the letters addressed by the sovereigns of Portugal to the potentates of Ceylon: at least, I have come across no other. The Portuguese text of these letters I have transcribed from the copies in Additional Manuscript 20,878 of the British Museum Library.\n\n*The Conde de Aveiras, having been appointed Viceroy for the second time, left Lisbon early in 1650 to succeed Don Philippe Mascarenhas, but died on the voyage out; and the Government was therefore carried on by three Commissioners until the arrival at Goa, on 3rd September, 1652, of the Conde de Obidos, who had left Lisbon on 25th March.\u2014D.

Buultjens, B.A. Cantab.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Dutch manuscript, relating to Van Eck's expedition against Kandy, was purchased by me in Holland.\n\nBaron van Eck was the Dutch Governor of Ceylon, 1762\u20131765 A.D.\n\nThe route he took was via Negombo and Kurun\u00e9gala, not the usual road via Balana (near the Kadugann\u00e1wa pass), by which the Portuguese invaded the Kandyan Provinces.\n\nThis expedition in 1765 was, I believe, the only one against Kandy undertaken during Van Eck's r\u00e9gime, and if so Sir Emerson Tennent has antedated it, when he states (Vol. II., p. 61): \"The Dutch, by an exertion of unwonted vigour, conducted an army to Kandy, 1763 A.D., which they held for some months.\"*\n\nIn the Sinhalese History of Ceylon, by Mudaliy\u00e1r Simon de Silva, published by the Public Instruction Department, an expedition is mentioned (p. 131) which took Kandy in 1763 A.D. That account states that the Sinhalese prevented provisions from being taken from the maritime provinces to the Dutch army in Kandy, which thus suffered from famine and sickness. After remaining in Kandy for nine months the Dutch General considered it prudent to save the rest of the army by flight to Colombo. During the retreat the stragglers, weary and faint, were cut off by the Sinhalese, who fell upon them at S\u00edt\u00e1waka and slew 400 of them. The rest of the Dutch after suffering great hardship at last reached Colombo.\u2020\n\n* Sir E. Tennent may have copied the date 1763 from Pridham (Vol. I., p. 134), Forbes (Vol. II., p. 240), or Marshall (p. 59). Percival gives it as 1764. The Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nya, Eschelckron, Bertolaca, Haafuer, fix no year.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\n\n\u2020 Mudaliy\u00e1r Simon de Silva's History of Ceylon, p. 131.\u2014A. E. B. [Mudaliy\u00e1r S. de Silva states that his book was written some twelve years ago, though published only recently; that the authorities for this period which he followed were Pridham, Knighton, Marshall, and the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nya; that he also quoted from a Sighalese poem (since lost) called Lansi-hatana, the contents of which he has forgotten; further that he cannot remember where he got the number \"400\" in connection with the alleged slaughter at S\u00edt\u00e1waka. He probably took over the figures from Percival or Marshall, both of whom give it.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.]\nThe above account from the Sinhalese agrees in the main so closely with the Dutch manuscript account of the sufferings of the Dutch army at Kandy from want of food and from sickness, and with the massacre at Sit\u00e1waka (Letter G), that I am inclined to think the former is a description of what occurred in 1765 and not in 1763. If so, a modification of the account in that history is necessary, where it leads us to infer that Van Eck became Governor after that expedition against Kandy, and that he again made war against the Sinhalese king and devastated many districts in the Kandyan provinces.\n\nIt is probable from the internal evidence, especially Letter L, that the author of the Journal was Van Angelbeek, the Secretary of Van Eck. But whether he was the same as J. G. Van Angelbeek, who was Governor at the time of the cession of Colombo to the English in 1796, I have no means of ascertaining.*\n\nThe manuscript account ends with the tragic and sudden death of Van Eck, and the political confusion which resulted. From other sources we learn that this expedition after \"a protracted struggle terminated in 1766, under the judicious management of M.

After the midday meal at 2 o'clock he pursued his journey to Gonawielle and arrived there at 6 P.M. On arrival there it was learnt that Major Van Wezel had that morning set out thence with the necessary forces to take possession of Wisenaawe.* Accordingly, the tidings of this was brought on Thursday, the 17th. Nothing further of importance occurred here till\u2014\n\nSunday, the 20th, when at 8 A.M. His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by the Lieutenant-Colonel Feber and the above-mentioned Secretary, departed with the main body of the army from Gonawielle and at 2 P.M. arrived at Kattegampelle (which is situated further than the previous year's camp at Ettembie). There lay encamped the corps of Major De Reder,\u2020 who was found to be in a very pitiful and\n\n* General Macdonall's division retired from Kandy in 1803 by this route:\n\n\"Their fourth day's march completed forty miles, and brought them to Wisanaweh, where there is a Candian granary. This place lies almost due west of Candy, and the straight line of distance does not exceed twenty miles; but the ranges of mountains, which form the natural barriers of the Candian capital, render a direct approach to it impracticable.\" (Cordiner II., 197.)\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\n\n\u2020 Major de Reder's memorial inscription is given in Lap.Zeyl. 85.\u2014D.W.F.\nsickly condition. Wherefore on the following day, Monday, the 21st, he departed to Colombo for the sake of recovery from that sickness; and after His Excellency the Governor had marked out the camp at the above-mentioned Kattegampelle, and had appointed the Lieutenant Van der Veen to the command, he continued the march as before.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 23rd, at 7 A.M. and at 12 noon, he ordered the army to halt at Ettembole (the place of encampment the previous year). Thence they resumed the journey, and without any hostile encounter arrived at 3 P.M. at the chief camp at Wisenaue.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th, the body of cavalry on patrol returned at midday with various booty, consisting of grasshoppers,* muskets, and pikes.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 29th, at 4.30 A.M., Major Van Wezel set out with the advance guard by the direct road to Ohomize, and Captain Frankena made a detour to the right, with the intention of attacking the foe in front and flank at a concerted time and place. Accordingly His Excellency also, following the adopted plan, came right upon the enemy in good time at a plain near Ohomize. Although the forces of the enemy greatly exceeded ours, yet we attacked them with no small ardour and compelled them to take to flight. In this action one European, who was in the service of the enemy, was struck by a bullet from one of our horsemen, and thereby was laid low, but quickly slipped away. We had in this affair only one dead and three wounded out of the cavalry corps, but the loss of the enemy will possibly not be counted by them, for our patrols sent out afterwards discovered in the jungles at one time twenty dead and at another twelve. The encampment for our troops was at first located at the above-mentioned plain of Ohomize, but afterwards at Pidroewelle, situated half a league\u2020 further.\n\n* See supra, p. 76, and note.\n\u2020 The Dutch mile is 6,395 yards, and thus a little more than a \"league,\" by which word I have translated the Dutch myl.\u2014A. E. B.\nFEBRUARY.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2nd February, at 2 P.M., His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Feber and the Secretary, set out with the main body of the army from Wisenaue and arrived at Pidroewelle, a distance of fully two leagues, at 7 P.M.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 6th, early in the morning, Lieutenant-Colonel Feber set out with the advance guard from Pidroewelle and marched to Kornagalle as far as this side of that hill. In the meanwhile Captain Tornay, who had set out from Putulang with a corps of eight hundred men, arrived on the other side of the above-named hill. Upon a given signal from both sides a beginning was made to attack the foe in front and in rear, and thus to bring them between two fires, but this was of such consequence that the foe, foreseeing the difficulty, fired some shots upon our men, took to flight, and kept themselves divided into troops lower down at the foot of the hills on the road to Tilliagonne.\n\nCaptain Tornay then formed a conjunction of his troops with those of the Lieutenant-Colonel and marched further on. They were attacked by a great force of Sinhalese, and shot at during the onward march, till they approached a small plain before Tilliagonne, three-quarters of a league from Kornagalle. Here the firing became still quicker and heavier, but our troops spread themselves into various parties. One of these parties, with a handful of men and a small fieldpiece, under the command of Captain Van Sweinhauber,* pursued the foe for three-quarters of a league from Tilliagonne to a hill named Periekondemalle, and drove them out of one battery. In this skirmish we sustained a loss of four dead and seven wounded, but the loss of the enemy could not be ascertained, though along the footpaths much blood was found. Meanwhile the\n\n* This is probably the Schweinhauber mentioned in J. C. Wolf's Reizen naar Ceilon, pp. 214, 215, as having in 1764 improved horse-breeding in the island of Delft.\u2014A. E. B.\nLieutenant-Colonel ordered the army to encamp at Tilliagonne during this affair with the enemy, and Major Van Wezel, with the reserve corps, held the same quarter behind the hill of Kornagalle. But as everything had turned out according to our wish in regard to the advance guard, he was ordered on the receipt of a letter from the Lieutenant-Colonel to His Excellency the Governor to turn back again at 5 P.M. to the encampment at Pidroewelle.\n\nOn Thursday, the 7th, at 2.30 P.M., His Excellency the Governor and also Major Van Wezel set out with the rest of the army from Pidroewelle and arrived at 6.30 P.M. at Tilliagonne. The encamped army, when passing along at Kornagalle, observed on an unusually large granite rock a hewn gate leading into a cave, whither, according to common report, the king comes every year to perform his service of offerings. And not far from the same rock was seen a life-size image, skilfully carved, seated in a Heathen temple, with the legs crossed one over the other, and at the doorposts were two beautifully carved stone lions.\n\nOn Saturday, the 9th, at about 3.30 P.M., the Lieutenant-Colonel marched forth out of our camp with a force of 1,800 men with the intention of undertaking the attack against the enemy towards morning, and in the meantime of halting that night upon Periekondemalle.\n\nOn Sunday, the 10th, towards midday, there appeared at our camp a runaway young slave of the late Predikant Potken, who had concealed himself for the past four years in Kandie. He reported that the king had fled from his palace, and the inhabitants had scattered themselves in the kingdom of Kandie through fear of the flames of war, but yet that there were many in favour of a defence. Shortly afterwards was received the pleasant news of the good success of our arms under the leadership of the Lieutenant-Colonel Feber. This occurred in the following manner. Early this morning our troops began to march from the place where they lay encamped the previous night, and\nslowly approached a flat plain where the enemy were awaiting us after having arranged themselves in order of battle for that purpose. The Lieutenant-Colonel observed them, just before His Excellency appeared, and ordered the body of cavalry, together with a company of Malays, to advance to the left side, and the company of Marines, together with two companies of Malays, to the right side. They attacked the enemy on the flanks, while the Lieutenant-Colonel advanced with the main body and marched straight upon the enemy, the fieldpieces being meanwhile dragged on under cover of the companies. Accordingly the engagement was begun on this side and that, and lasted for a short time, till the Sinhalese took to flight with the loss of many men. After the enemy were driven from this place, it was learnt that the Sinhalese would have retired somewhat earlier, but that they had been given no time for flight by the Adigaar who was present at the action. Having obtained the victory the Lieutenant-Colonel advanced and, after the capture of three other batteries, arrived at Wewedde without any loss of men.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 12th, at 6.30 A.M., His Excellency the Governor departed with the rest of the army from Tilliagonne and at 11 o'clock A.M. arrived at Wewedde. Shortly afterwards an embassy of the royal Adigaar and the Dessaves presented themselves here and went away again. Likewise the late Koraal of this place and some lesser headmen appeared before His Excellency and declared their willingness to submit to the Dutch East Company.\n\nAt about 3 o'clock this afternoon His Excellency, accompanied by the Lieutenant-Colonel, the Secretary, and other officers, went on pleasure to the hill of Gallegiddere, situated two hours from Wewedde. This hill was captured yesterday by Captain Van Sweinhauber, as also six batteries which had been erected one behind the other across the road on the march up. There was built on this hill a square fortress of masonry with two moderate-sized gates,\none just opposite the other, and in front of it, but somewhat further off, is a very steep hill which cannot be climbed even by clambering with hands and feet. Every one must confess that Heaven has wonderfully stood by us in this victory.*\n\nOn Wednesday, the 13th, in the afternoon the Lieutenant-Colonel departed with the army from Wewedde, in order to take possession of Giriagamme, situated beyond Gallegiddere. Accordingly on Thursday the good news was received that the place, which was situated on a hill, and also provided with a fortress, was captured by His Honour without the least conflict of arms. The enemy could have easily defended that fort, which is sufficiently impregnable by nature, and could well have continued to remain there.\n\nThis noon a small embassy from Kandia arrived here bearing with it an ola, and it was sent back again with a reply at 8.30 P.M.\n\nOn Friday, the 15th, His Excellency the Governor, after the midday meal, departed with the main body of the army from Wewedde, and having passed by Gallegiddere arrived at 7 P.M. at Giriagamme. Having spent that night there he set out next morning, on Saturday, the 16th, from thence, and having crossed over the Hoenang oye arrived at 10.30 A.M. at the camp of the Lieutenant-Colonel, which lay on this side of the river Mahawile-gange, at the pass of Kattoegastotte. Here His Excellency the Governor made his entrance into the king's pleasure-house, and shortly after that there came a messenger from the other side of the river to ask His Excellency the Governor, in the name of the magnates of the court, whether he was inclined to receive them, as they were expressly come to treat with His Excellency about the peace. His Excellency granted them this, and at once fixed the time for the audience for 4.30 P.M. So, when they were allowed to cross over the river, to wit,\n\n* For descriptions of assaults on Galagedara Fort by Portuguese and British, see Ribeiro, p. 153, and Cordiner II., p. 177.\u2014D. W. F.\nthe first royal Adigaar, the three Dessaves of Oewe, Oedepallat, and Matule, together with the king's Maha mohotiaar, or Chief Secretary, and the Mohandiram of the royal guard, they were conducted according to their rank by the captains to the Governor's tent, and were seated each one on his usual stool round a table next to His Excellency, the Lieutenant-Colonel Major Van Wezel and the Secretary. The conference lasted for about half an hour, when they went away, at the Governor's desire, in order to ask from the king and bring a signed authority in writing for the conclusion of a legal peace.\n\nOn Sunday, the 17th, a letter was written to Colombo to hold a general thanksgiving service in the Dutch church* there on the following Sunday for the good success of the Company's arms. This forenoon the Dessave of Oedepallate came alone with a small retinue from the opposite shore to our camp. He went into the tent of His Excellency the Governor, and, having conferred with him, went back again. Shortly afterwards His Excellency gave orders to have in readiness next morning the necessary boats and vessels for the purpose of transporting a force of 1,000 men.\n\nOn Monday, the 18th, in the afternoon, there came over to us for the last time the above-named Dessave of Oedepallate and the Dessave of Oewe. They were granted an audience in the king's pleasure-house before a committee of the Lieutenant-Colonel and the Secretary, and then despatched, and on the following\u2014\n\nTuesday, the 19th, in the morning, a beginning was made to transport our troops over the river. Accordingly His Excellency the Governor also crossed over, and without any hindrance came to the king's palace at 10 A.M. and at once took up his residence there. Meanwhile the common soldiers turned everything topsy-turvy, and entering in carried out from there a very rich booty till evening, and\n\n* Probably the Wolfendahl Church.\u2014A. E. B.\nalso the day after. It consisted chiefly of all kinds of the most valuable stuffs and the finest linens, precious stones, gold and silver wares, and jewels, and even pieces of gold, fine pagodas,* ducats,* &c.\n\nWednesday and Thursday, the 20th and 21st February.\u2014Nothing particular occurred, except only that there appeared before His Excellency the Governor small parties of Kandians with white flags, and submitted themselves to the Company. Also a certain soldier, who had deserted at Gonaweie to the Sinhalese and again returned to us, was punished.\n\nOn Friday, the 22nd, the following appointments were made here:\u2014\n\nThe Chief Merchant and Acting President of the Political Council at Colombo, Mr. Marten Rein, to be Commandant of Candia.\u2020\n\nThe Lieutenant-Colonel Feber to be Colonel.\n\nMajor Van Wezel to be Lieutenant-Colonel.\n\nCaptain Frankenka to be Major.\u2021\n\nMr. Van Angelbeek to be Chief Merchant while continuing in the offices of Political Secretary and Secretary of the Secret Committee of the Government of Ceylon.\n\nThe news, both certain and sure, was received that the court was then held at a place called Hangoerankitti. To-day some sepoys, under the command of Captain Van Arnim, set out to a second palace of the king, situated about three hours from here, but returned again without being molested.\n\nOn Sunday, the 24th, at 4 P.M., there set forth from here a flying corps of 700 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Van Wezel with the object of dislodging the king from his residence at Hangoerankitti, situated ten hours away from here, and of destroying the place. Our men were\n\n* Gold coins.\u2014A. E. B.\n\n\u2020 Wolf (Vol. II., p. 69) says that he had been a tailor at Trincomalee.\u2014D. W.

Sec.\ncompelled to pass the night half way and undertake the affair on the following\u2014\n\nMonday, the 25th, very early in the morning. And after the capture of several of the fortifications of the enemy they pressed closer on them, and at last arrived before Hangoe-rankitti, where a considerable number of men was seen to escape to the mountains with tawny elephants and with palanquins. Of these last, indeed, one would have been caught in the trap, if the sound that the Lieutenant-Colonel ordered to be beaten on the drum in order to make the men gather together, who had scattered themselves too far, did not compel our men to return at once on hearing it; however one coolly was shot down from under a palanquin. The king's residence was plundered and set on fire, and our men began on\u2014\n\nTuesday, the 26th, their return march. But in an unexpected way they were surprised by the enemy on all sides and attacked, particularly the rear guard, which lost at one stroke ten horsemen and also many marines, both French and Javanese, among others Lieutenant Stroebel, who was severely wounded.\n\nThe Sinhalese, who in all probability had noticed the want of ammunition among our men, pursued them to half an hour from Kandia, and, indeed, amid such a continuous heavy firing, that our men, famished and as if half dead, came into the camp about an hour after midday. It was then perceived that the number of our dead and wounded amounted to quite over forty-eight men.\n\nBut Lieutenant Hunnold, who had been despatched the day before yesterday in the afternoon with a Sepoy and European militia to a fourth palace, in which, according to report, the royal family was concealed, returned again on\u2014\n\nWednesday, the 27th, at noon, without having had the slightest hostile encounter, bringing the news that in the above royal palace no living creature was found, and, as to booty, there was nothing of consequence.\nOn Thursday, the 28th, there arrived here the Predikant Philipsz and the Mohotiaar of the Gate, Don Simon de Zilva, who were summoned from Colombo, until the recovery from sickness of the Field Maha modliaar, Ilangacoon.\n\nMarch.\n\nOn Friday, the 1st March, Major Frankena, with a small force of men, undertook to make a tour to the Four Korles, and after some destruction returned. Only one man was lost, and the native soldiers received some wounds. On the return march two of our spies were found hanged, and in retaliation for this spiteful injury His Excellency ordered that three Sinhalese spies, who were caught by chance, should meet a similar death.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2nd, His Excellency the Governor despatched a letter to the assembly of the magnates of the court.\n\nOn Sunday, the 3rd, Captain Duflo, Lieutenant Legrand, and Ensign Lowendaal were engaged anew in the Company\u2019s service, the first as Major,* the second as Captain-Lieutenant, and the last as Lieutenant.\n\nOn Monday, the 4th, after His Excellency the Governor had entrusted the management and direction of affairs to Colonel Feber till the arrival of the Commandant Mr. Rein, who was expected, he set out after 6 A.M. from Kandia in company with Lieutenant-Colonel Van Wezel, the Secretary Van Angelbeek, and the Predikant Philipsz. They arrived at 12 A.M. at Giriagamme without any hostile encounter. But before His Excellency\u2019s arrival there were two Sinhalese from the enemy\u2019s stragglers that showed themselves on the hills in small parties and now and then fired some shots on our people, that did remain behind, and approached without\n\n* The Dutch Records, Colombo, contain many interesting letters in French from this Major Duflo, who seems to have been constantly employed in the field against the Kandyans during the prevalence of the tedious hostilities which preceded this expedition and culminated in the Peace of 1766.

One of these two was, however, caught and hanged aloft by his legs to a tree till he was dead.\n\nFrom this place His Excellency the Governor set out after breakfast at about 2 P.M. and arrived at Wewedde at 6 P.M. Having passed the night there, he departed on Tuesday, the 5th, at 7 A.M., for Pidroewelle, and arrived there in the evening at sunset. He departed from thence on the following Wednesday, the 6th, early in the morning, and took his breakfast at Wisenaue, but rested for the night at Kattegampelle, whence the journey was continued on\u2014\n\nThursday, the 7th, early in the morning. Towards midday he reached Gonawile and tarried there till the afternoon of Friday, the 8th. From this cantonment His Excellency the Governor set out at 3 o'clock, and having reached Tammerawile at 6.30 P.M. he dined there, and proceeded on his journey to Nigombo, where he arrived at 10 P.M. He was met at this fortress by the Commandant of Kandia, Marten Rein, Major Baron de Reder, the Bookkeeper Joan Philip Stork, together with the writers Zichtveld, Wyland, Bote, Beukman, Staats, Werdal, Hopman, and L\u00fcik. All of them were to depart to Kandia, except the Major Baron de Reder, who was to remain at Gonawile and take over the command from the Dissave Bauert.\n\nSaturday, the 9th.\u2014In the afternoon the above-named Commandant, together with the Major and the Bookkeeper, departed from Nigombo, His Honour intending to take with him on his march further from Gonawile the first sworn clerk of the Secret Committee, Johan Hendrik M\u00fcller, who was there, and whom His Honour had selected as his own Secretary, and in place of him was appointed the Bookkeeper Andries Nicolaas L\u00fcyk, who arrived to-day at Nigombo from Colombo.\n\nOn Sunday, the 10th, at 8 A.M., His Excellency the Governor accompanied by the Secretary Van Angelbeek, and also some officers come back from Kandia, entered into a boat which\nwas ready to row, and amidst the firing of twenty-one cannon set out from Nigombo, and arrived by the providence of God in complete health at 5 P.M. at the pass of Naklegam. Here His Excellency was welcomed by the gentlemen and ladies of distinction and other qualified persons, and proceeding into the castle was received with particular joy and gladness amidst the firing of the cannon on the walls.\n\nThus do I herewith bring this Journal to an end.\n\n---\n\nJournal of a Captain of the Candian Expedition.\n\nAt 6 A.M. on February 19 [1765] the advance guard with a large part of the corps crossed over the river, and His Excellency followed with the other troops, leaving a sentinel at the river as well as at all other places, and arrived at about 11 o'clock at the royal palace. This was inspected by all, each remarking to the other with great astonishment, how it was possible for a black king to have such a palace. Shortly after it was inspected this castle was plundered, and everything given up for booty. There was much treasure, consisting of gold, silver, precious stones, gold and silver cloths, velvets, silk stuffs, fine linen of all sorts, in abundance. For three days the men did nothing else but roam and plunder, so that everything has been ruined, both the walls and the doors, which were plated with silver, and now stripped of everything, it is a most miserable spectacle.\n\nOn the 25, while we were there, it was reported to His Excellency by a European that the king was at Hagerenkitti, and that there was a royal palace. At once a commander was despatched thither with the same orders to plunder everything. He returned in the evening with some booty.\n\nOn the 26th instant, a second commander set out to the same castle, robbed and plundered the remaining goods which were still there, and set fire to the rest, so that at\nonce the palace became a heap of ashes. But on our departure from that place the Sinhalese followed us till nigh unto Kandia, and we had some killed and wounded. No more were white flags seen to wave, no more was heard the word of peace, no more would the Sinhalese receive a letter from us, for they sent it back to us three times, and as for ambassadors still less would they hear. But every day at this time a commander was sent forth to roam and to burn and to murder everything if only it was Sinhalese; and if only damage could be done in anything, orders were given for that work, and they were executed, for none of their people appeared and their royal bridges were burnt.\n\nOn the 28th instant nothing particular occurred, except that commanders were sent out daily, always waiting for envoys from the king.\n\nOn March 4 His Excellency the Governor departed in the morning from Kandia to Colombo, where he arrived on the evening of the 10th instant at about 6 o'clock P.M. The Commandant departed from Kandia on March 28 and arrived at Colombo on April 6.\n\n---\n\n**LETTER A.**\n\nExtract from a letter written by His Excellency the Governor of Ceylon at the camp situated on this side of the river Mahawillegange, in the kingdom of Candia, dated February 17, 1765, to the Ministry at Colombo.\n\nThen since this course of arms has been successful on all sides, and thereby the kingdom of Candia is conquered so fortunately and with such a trifling loss, and brought to the Company's service, so that it must supplicate for peace and receive it as a gift from us, and we, in the first place, attribute it wholly to the particular help and blessing of God Almighty, and as therefore all honour, praise, and thanksgiving belong to Him, so may it please you to make this known to the venerable consistory of the church, and to request the brother ministers on the following Sunday, in public, to praise and thank God, the Lord, for the assistance and special favour which He has thus far granted to us, and also to be mindful of us further in our prayers, &c.\nLETTER B.\n\nExtract from a letter from ..........* a certain Principal Servant of the Honourable Company, written from Colombo to Mat\u00fcre, under date April 6, 1765.\n\nNotwithstanding that Colonel Feber's Company has been recommended to take over the command in Kandia from the Commandant Mr. Rein, while His Honour should come to serve here, in order to take over for a time the chief administration of this Island, together with the Commandant at Jaffnapatam, Mr. Mooyaart,\u2020 yet the above-named Colonel arrived here this afternoon, but what the reason of this may be I cannot yet know, perhaps later on.\n\nLETTER C.\n\nExtract from a letter dated April 10, 1765, from and to as above.\n\nI wrote to you in my previous letter that the reason was unknown to me why Colonel Feber, upon the letter of the Political Council here, which he had received at Catagampelle (a field station between Gonewille and Wisenawe), did not betake himself to Candia. But as I am now informed of it, I may mention here that as he had withdrawn all the field-posts behind him, to wit, from Candia up to Wisenawe, and had already advanced to Catagampelle, he found it impossible at once to enter again into possession of the places which the enemy had at once occupied, and to force a march to Candia, and the more so on account of the approaching rainy season, and the great want of the necessary coolies and provisions. For these reasons his departure was postponed till the time and the means should permit. Thus for the present the passage and communication have been cut off and rendered impossible, so that one may truly pity our people in Candia, the more so as I hear that sickness is raging there to a very great extent, and His Honour, Mr. Rein, is lying very ill, and also Mr. Stork, who at the time of the departure of the Colonel was beyond hope of recovery.\u2021\n\n* Lacuna in the manuscript.\u2014A. E. B.\n\u2020 Regarding Anthony Mooyaart see Lit. Reg. II., 63 ff.; V., 91 n., 92 n.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u2021 The withdrawal from the stations is so stupid and senseless that I do not know how it can be justified. One may say it was wise not to keep them in the rainy season, and there was no means of procuring provisions and means of living. But why then was Candia not abandoned and the men brought away, since by withdrawing the posts they stand always in the greatest danger of being massacred by the Siphalese (may God preserve them), when time and means permit our people in Candia to be killed.\u2014Marginal note.\nLETTER D.\n\nExtract from a letter written from Colombo by a Principal Officer under date April 6, 1765, to as above.\n\nAfter the death of His Excellency (namely, the Governor) a letter was at once written to Candia, that Mr. Rein should come away and manage affairs here, and that in his place the Colonel Feber should take up the administration and command there, and for that purpose that the Hussars, lately arrived from the Coast, should be sent up-country. But because the Colonel had already reached Wisenawe, and had withdrawn the posts between Candia and that place just before he had received the above-mentioned letter, so he continued his march hither, and is due to reach this before noon. Mr. Rein is left in the lurch in Candia (since now there is no longer any chance of his rescue except with great danger), and the administration falls to the members of the Political Council who are here, for it is not to be supposed that the infirm and aged Commandant Mooyaart will come here, though he has been requested to do so.\n\nWhat I shall write you of the affairs of war, my sentiments and weak judgment about matters, which are directed by a higher hand and power, very seldom do I willingly commit to paper. But what concerns the present circumstances, so far as I have learnt in the two days, has been made public for the first time. I have the honour to report that at some posts, principally at Gonewile, sickness is raging severely among the men. God forbid that it should continue any longer, or grow worse! The Sinhalese are still making some stir, and people are still living somewhat quietly; but if the death of our Governor will not make them somewhat bolder, at least more arrogant, I should not willingly encounter them. May God grant only that there * at Matire everything may continue in rest and peace, &c.\n\nLETTER E.\n\nExtract from a letter dated April 14, 1765, written from Colombo by a Principal Member of Council to.........\u2020\n\nWe have at last attained our object,\u2021 at least partly. We have become masters of Candia, in spite of jungles and steep mountains, which, according to the unanimous saying of all the officers, would have made the execution of the undertaking impossible, if we had not to deal with the most cowardly nation under the sky.

This was agreed to, and on the following day several magnates of the court, and among others the royal Adigaar, presented themselves rather as suppliants than as ambassadors. They begged for the Three and Four Corles, the Seven Corles, Saffragam, and the sovereignty of all the coasts of the whole Island, requesting at the same time that by God's will something more may be left to their king. His Excellency the Governor would certainly have accepted this proposition very readily, had not a certain Member of the Council* persuaded him to make the still further demand that the king must submit himself to be a vassal to the Company. This was the reason why the conference for peace was broken up, and the king (who would rather sacrifice some provinces than have the shame that his capital had fallen into the power of his enemies) left it as a prey and retired to the land of Oeva. Mr. Rein finds himself still at Candia, and will be compelled, owing to the hard monsoon being at hand, on account of which he will not be able to come away without great danger, to remain there till the month of August.\n\n[Postscript to the above, written in French,\u2020 as follows:\u2014]\n\nI have received confirmation, regarding that which I have the honour to inform you in my letter, from the Colonel and the principal officers (who have come) down from Candia. I have nothing to put forward from my Head. But I will add that Mr. Van Eck returned from his expedition more moody and depressed than ill, although he apparently had every reason for being cheerful and satisfied. I think that the disappointment had more to do with his death than had his illness, which at the outset was of no account.\n\nEight days after his return he shrank from seeing any one; and towards the end the sentries had even orders to allow no one to enter the courtyard. This order was enforced till the last day, when we were astounded to learn that he was in extremis. I was the first to hasten (to him); but it was too late: he had already lost the power of speech, and was unconscious.\n\nLetter F.\n\nExtract from a letter dated April 9, 1765, written from Colombo by .......... to ..........\u2021\n\nThe arrival of His Excellency Van Eck would have indeed reached your ears, as well as His Excellency's unexpected death on April 1 at 3 A.M.

And it appears that if there existed a grief, it may indeed almost be guessed, and will become public later on.\n\nOn the 28th March Colonel Feber set out from Candia with the companies of Europeans, Malays, and Sepoys, and withdrew all the posts up to Wisenaue, so that the road to Candia is now occupied for thirty leagues by the foes. The garrison in Candia, 1,600 men, strong enough in men and position, if God only grants them health and strength, to keep off the enemy who attack them every day, is very poorly provided, and that for no long time.\n\nMr. Rein was ill, Stork dangerously ill, and almost all the officers and many privates, so that there is some apprehension, and the present is little better than before for the Company; though some servants have fared well, yet all this will create some alarm.\n\nThe rest you can well comprehend; it goes on according to your prediction. If Candia can be held, and we are somewhat strengthened with men, the coming Governor can yet make a peace such as was offered. Would that we had it even now! In my humble opinion it was better than to have spent much blood and money on that wild-goose chase.\n\nMay God, who rulest all things, so direct it that our eyes may behold your Excellency's person as Governor of this place,* to the advantage of the Honourable Company and of the inhabitants of Ceylon!\n\n**LETTER G.**\n\n*Extract from a letter from Colombo by the above to a Principal Minister at Matiure, dated Colombo, April 11, 1765.*\n\nThe Colonel departed from Candia on March 28 with some companies of Malays, Europeans, and Sepoys, leaving there the Commandant Rein slightly ill, the Under Merchant Stork dangerously ill, almost all the officers sick, and many privates. He has left there 1,600 men in all, but very poorly provided with food. Moreover, all the posts from Candia up to Wisenaue have been withdrawn, so that the line of communication for 20 to 25 leagues is again occupied by the enemies. Great anxiety of mind prevails regarding Candia. May heaven be gracious to us and grant our men health and strength, otherwise it would be a dreadful calamity, and the situation would be somewhat worse for the Company than that of the past year. As for the booty of Candia, I hear there is nothing at all for the Company, though some of the servants have fared well. Think often of \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2020 It seems as if he had a prophetic spirit, because the present\n\n* The writer shows his concern about it!\u2014Marginal note.\n\u2020 Lacuna in manuscript.\u2014A. E. B.\nis just what he foretold. Mine eyes are eagerly longing to behold what my heart wishes.* As God wills it, so shall it happen.\n\nIt is reported that a large force of Sinhalese is encamped at Sitavake, having come with great reinforcements. At present their exasperation is great. They are cutting off the noses, ears, extremities, calves of the legs, heels, and necks of both blacks and whites, for since the capture of Candia they care no longer for peace.\n\n**Letter H.**\n\n*Extract from a letter dated April 15, 1765, written from Colombo.*\n\nAs regards the affairs of this Island I doubt not but that Mr. .......\u2020 has given you a general outline. After the capture of Candia Mr. Rein was sent thither as Commandant, with the Assistant Merchant Stork as \u201cDispencier,\u201d and several other servants. But after the death of His Excellency the Governor, Mr. Rein was again summoned hither by the local Political Council in order to carry on the administration here, after that he had entrusted everything to Colonel Feber. But just four days previously, Colonel Feber had set out thence for this place and had withdrawn several posts, so he considered it impossible to again undertake the return march, and thus he arrived here. The passage between this and Candia is at present barred in so far that no further interchange of letters can be had.\n\nThe said Mr. Rein was, according to the account of Colonel Feber and his own letters to me, lying sick of the ague, and Mr. Stork was sick unto death. Of the latter, the report is now current that he is dead. It is also said that most of the servants there are ill, and that all are suffering from great want of provisions, so that they can obtain nothing else but rice. At present the strong conviction, which will gain ground still more, is that it would have been a desirable thing if a peace had been concluded, seeing that it was brought by the Sinhalese themselves in the first instance, and proffered on the most favourable terms.\n\n**Letter J.**\n\n*Later extract from a letter from and to as above, dated May 20, 1765.*\n\nNow, as regards news, everything still appears very bad, for the road to and from Candia is still occupied and barred, so that letters cannot pass hither and thither. What the result of this will be, time alone will unfold. However, it would have been a desirable thing if the peace, which was so favourably proposed, had been accepted, and if a certain Albeschik;\u2021 well known to you, had not been in the game which he has pushed too far.\n\n---\n\n* The man longed to see me as Governor.\u2014Marginal note.\n\u2020 Lacuna in manuscript.\n\u2021 This \u201ccertain Albeschik\u201d is identified with the Secretary Angelbeek.\u2014Marginal note.

The first epithet I put on one side, as it cost some blood, so that I may ascribe it to chance. However, the praise lies on the side of the victor. As for the second, God grant that a happy result may crown our expectation. Every one however, makes reflections; in this case I know my own inability, as I am totally ignorant of Indian politics. Yet, however ignorant one may be of it, the present situation obliges me to make the following candid observations. Candia has been captured and plundered, and even the holiest temples and pagodas of the Candians and Sinhalese. Some of them, it is said, have been razed to the ground. Already there are diverse rumours, which give cause for thinking that because of these things every possibility of reconciliation, as well with the Emperor as with his subjects, has wholly and entirely disappeared.\n\nThe prince has retreated with most of his treasure and different armies to the mountains, which are far more inaccessible than Candia itself, and where they never can be starved out\u2014at least so say the natives. All their armies are in communication with each other, and it seems that as yet not the slightest attempt has been made to attack them there. With what forces can we do so? When the troops issue forth out of Candia, they come immediately and assail them in the rear. If the magazines are withdrawn, how will it be with the communications, for all the roads from Colombo to Candia are even yet quite dangerous?\n\nMay Heaven grant that these and many other of my innocent reflections may turn out for the best, and that, 'ere long, we may receive a new Governor of Ceylon, whose talents can overcome all old and new difficulties, &c.\n\nLETTER L.\n\nExtract from a letter dated May 1, 1765, written from Colombo by one of the Members of the Council to ..........\u2020\n\nThe spectacle of the confusion in which we live at present has so embroiled me also, that I do not know with what to begin and how to end. My last letter ended, however, with the march of our army to Candia. In order that I may mention to you, more or less in order, the events which have occurred, I shall begin only with the arrival of our advance guard, commanded by Mr. Feber, before the sacred river, at the distance of less than a league from the court of Candia. Here the king at once sent a letter with the request that we should not advance further. Meanwhile that he would at once send ambassadors\n\n* Lacuna in manuscript.\u2014A. E. B. \u2020 Lacuna in manuscript.\u2014A. E. B.\nto His Excellency the Governor to treat for peace, and so three Dessaves presented themselves and held a conference with His Excellency the Governor, and requested that the demands of the Company might be given to them in writing. This was done. Meanwhile the officers and the main body of the army came up as far as the river. Here the first Adigaar of the realm and two Dessaves, &c., appeared and had an audience, in which everything was agreed to according to the wishes of the Company, with the request not to approach further the town and palace of Candia. Thereupon Horatius Cocles* said with senseless arrogance: \"Your Excellency, now we have the rogues in a corner, now the time is ripe to make the king a vassal of the Company, and as a beginning he must first pay twice a hundred thousand pagodas, and after that lay down the crown and be again crowned by the Company, and, as a perpetual remembrance of his vassalage, he must deliver to the Company four elephants every year.\" All this the ambassadors were then given to understand. But they assured us that the king would not agree thereto, and that they were deprived of a basis for a convention; they would, however, report it to the king. Thereupon they went away. Thus, by the advice of the Company's great Sch\u2020 State Minister, they did not wait long to take Candia; and though Feber was also much against it, they crossed over the river with the whole army, plundered the palace and the city, and took possession of it. Then must they pursue the king to his other residences, and to this work Major Van Wezel with 900 men was ordered. By this circumstance the king easily escaped to the mountains. Dear friend, it was after this expedition\u2021 that the mistake was first seen, and that they sought to persuade the king to that peace which he himself had offered. But everything remains, and is still, unanswered. Rein still stays with 1,600 men in Candia, but we can receive no news from him. The gentlemen of the Secretariat are occupied with forming a new plan, and have settled, just like stock-jobbers, to go through the Three and Four Corles over Balane into Candia.\u00a7 However, they will have to bring it to a conclusion, and not merely have it in mind.\n\n* By this Horatius Cocles was intended the Secretary Van Angelbeek, because he was very squint-eyed, and Cocles, the brave Roman, had only one eye. So also the matter here related is in the usual imperious manner of speech of the said Angelbeek.\u2014Marginal note.\n\n\u2020 \"Sch\" here means \"squint,\"\u2014Marginal note.\n\n\u2021 Certainly after this expedition! For they came back to the city running in a most cowardly way with over 48 both dead and wounded.\u2014Marginal note.\n\n\u00a7 Time will show what will be the result of this dangerous expedition.\u2014Marginal note.\nLETTER M.\n\nExtract from a letter dated May 18, written from Colombo by a Captain of the Militia, who had accompanied the expedition to Candia.\n\nMr. Commandant Rein as well as Mr. Stork are at Candia, but ill. Of these two, it is doubted whether the latter is still living, for he was ill when I returned.* There is no news from Candia to this date, because all the posts from that place up to Wisenawe have been broken up and everything set on fire.\n\nAPPENDIX A.\n\n(Mah\u0101vanssa, XCIX., 110\u2013145.)\n\nNow, while this great king of great fame and great authority dwelt in the great city, defending the church and the kingdom, the Hollanders, who were powerful merchants, and had been appointed in the time of king R\u0101jas\u012bha to defend the (sea-coast of the) island, continued to perform the duties of messengers to the kings of Lank\u0101. It was their custom to bring presents of great value (to the king) of divers cloths and other goods wrought in other countries, and many costly things also that were fit for the enjoyment of kings, every year, with great honour and in great procession. Now at that time, by reason, perhaps, of some sin committed by the people of Lank\u0101, or of the neglect of the gods that were appointed to defend the religion and the land, they (the Hollanders) became exceedingly wroth and cruel, and began to vex the inhabitants of Layk\u0101 in manifold ways. And when the illustrious king heard tidings thereof, he thought it an unjust thing, and sent officers against them. And those officers went with the men of Layk\u0101, as they had been commanded, and carried on a fierce war with the Hollanders. And they destroyed the enemy, and burned their houses and forts, and, by manifold devices, struck terror into their hearts. And when the enemy was thus oppressed with fear, a certain stubborn, cruel, and vile man\u2014a sinner whose days were numbered\u2014assumed the leadership, and took with him a great number of followers consisting of many Malays and others, and in manifold ways began to lay waste divers parts of the country, and destroyed villages, vih\u0101ras, dev\u0101las, bridges, resting-houses, and the like.\n\nAnd although the officers who had been ordered by the lord of Lank\u0101 opposed him in divers places with men of valour skilled in war, and fought against him in divers ways and slew (many of) the enemy in every battle, yet were they not able to prevail against him, so that he began to march against the city. Thereupon the great military officers opposed the enemy in front, stopping the way in divers ways, that they might hinder him in his rapid progress. And in the mean-\n\n* See supra, p. 77, and note.\nwhile, the great king, the lord of Lank\u00e1, who was endued with great knowledge, knowing that the time (was unfavourable), and seeing that it was not possible to hinder the progress of the enemy who came on like a wild-fire, placed the venerable Tooth-relic, and his queen also, and younger sister, and all his best treasure, in the charge of the two sub-kings, and sent them on for safety into the heart of the country, which the enemy could not reach by reason of the fastnesses of the mountains and the forest.\n\nThereupon, all the forces of the enemy, like a fierce multitude of devils, entered the city and destroyed all religious books and other sacred things. And the great king put himself at the head of the army, and surrounded by valiant generals skilful in war, and great ministers who knew how to take advantage of opportunities, took up his position at divers places near the suburbs not far from the chief city, and besieged it on every side.\n\nAnd the inhabitants of Lank\u00e1, being attached to the religion of Buddha, acted according to the king's commands, and slew all those who went over to the enemy, wheresoever they found them, while the king's messengers and other officers defended the priesthood.\n\nAnd those brave men, valiant and strong, who were faithful to their king, fought with the enemy in their desire to defend the religion of the conqueror. And they surrounded themselves with strong men, and fought in divers ways with those who held the highway at divers points, and drove them away. And they began to fight with the enemy that was inside the city, and many times slew them. It is not a marvel to us that men carried out the wishes of the king with such zeal, for even the gods did likewise. And, indeed, there soon fell upon that most foolish leader of the enemy's hosts a fearful and terrible madness that was brought about by the power of the gods and by the power also of the king's merit, so that he abandoned that fine city, and left it ingloriously, and was consumed by the fire of death.\n\nAnd all the enemy's hosts who had come under the leadership of that foolish man became powerless and helpless, and were overtaken by calamities. Some fell victims to disease; others suffered great distress from hunger and sickness; some were slain in battle, and others betook themselves to mountain fastnesses.\n\nThus were these enemies, the vilest of men, destroyed and put to flight, and thus was this ruler of the land protected by gods and men! And the people said, \"Of a surety our king is a man of great power, he is a man of great good fortune!\" And, indeed, who, in this world, is able to override the authority of a king so great in power, so great in good fortune?\n\nAnd when the illustrious king, whose enemies had been driven away, saw that the forces of the enemy had disappeared, he caused the city to be cleaned as before, and the temple of the Tooth-relic and other sacred buildings to be especially decorated.\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nInstructions to Monsieur Pierre Du Flo, Major, and Commander of a Military Force intended to operate in the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and elsewhere, according to circumstances.*\n\n1. The object of this expedition being under Divine blessing to secure for us, by a show of force, a firm and creditable peace with the Kandyans, it has been deemed advisable that you should proceed via Kurun\u00e9gala into Bint\u00ebnna; thence to penetrate into the Province of Uva, of which Badulla is the capital, where in recent years the King of Kandy has resided; and from there to retreat to Batticaloa.\n\n2. Towards this end, you have been supplied with general reports drawn up from particulars furnished by persons who have lived in those Provinces, or have passed through them. The names of the villages or hamlets, which you will meet with en route, have been carefully noted down\u2014their respective distances, the nature of the route, the means of subsistence available\u2014in short, all that is likely to throw light on your line of march, and the measures necessary to be taken. The informants themselves will accompany you, as guides.\n\n3. Monsieur Frijtag, Commandant at Trincomalee, will make a diversion from that side with a small detachment, and will advance towards the Province of M\u00e1tal\u00e9 at the beginning of February\u2014exactly the date that you may yourself expect to reach the interior of the M\u00e1tal\u00e9 District. This excursion from the direction of Trincomalee is devised with the object of distracting the attention of the enemy from Badulla, and inducing the supposition that you intend to retreat on Trincomalee. Monsieur Frijtag\u2019s force will return to its station about February 25th; and at the commencement of March similar tactics will be adopted from the Batticaloa side, with a small detachment which will endeavour to unite with you, and will at any rate serve to hold the enemy in check, and make it doubtful which route you will follow. This plan will be greatly helped by the fact that the Kandyans (from certain information which I have obtained regarding the route from Badulla to the Walaw\u00e9) are persuaded that we shall make an attempt from the direction of Kataragama; and I have been at pains to spread the truth of that report.\n\n4. From Batticaloa you will march by the shortest route to Trincomalee. There you will arrange with Monsieur Frijtag to return by the same road that the lascaryns take when carrying despatches to Colombo. But if your force is not exhausted you should make a detour through the District of the Wanniya of Nuwarakal\u00e1viya, in order to punish him; and thereafter retreat on Aripu, Puttalam, or any other place from which you can notify us here of your return.\n\n* Translated from instructions in French copied from the Dutch Records, Colombo.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\n5. These instructions are not bound to be followed to the letter. For, should it happen that owing to desertion of coolies, sickness among the troops, or other untoward event, you find yourself unable to continue the march to Uva, you will proceed from M\u00e1tal\u00e9 or Bint\u00ebna to Trincomalee direct. Similarly, on reaching Batticaloa, should you be certified of a safe route by the sea coast as far as the District of M\u00e1tara, not necessitating a stay of over six or seven days in the District of Pan\u00e1wa, which is very unhealthy\u2014you may return by this way to the Company\u2019s territory.\n\nIf there is a road leading from Badulla to Sabaragamuwa\u2014which I have had no means of ascertaining\u2014your force can return by Saffregam.\n\nBroadly speaking, you are empowered to act during the conduct of this expedition as time and place may require\u2014not concerning yourself to carry out the present instruction strictly to the letter, but keeping in view the main object of your mission, viz., to forward by means of your expedition the conclusion of a peace with the Kandyans, as advantageous as lasting.\n\n6. You will be furnished with certain olas, in Sinhalese, which show that our efforts to avoid the disastrous result of war have failed owing to the obstinacy of the Kandyan Court, and despite the favourable terms that we have offered it. We have in these warned each and all not to bring on them the resentment of our arms, by an ill-advised resistance; and we promise to all who remain quiet, and supply us with provisions, or aid us by other means, that we will guarantee them against the loss of property and dwellings; to those who treat us as enemies we have employed the customary threats.\n\n7. Following [the intention of] this ola, you will be careful on the march to prevent pillage or sacking in places where you are met by no resistance from the inhabitants, so that when your humanity is noised abroad the Kandyans may be minded to help in provisioning your troops. But this humane treatment concerns the common folk alone; for, as touching the houses, plantations, stores, and other belongings of the King and the Principal Chiefs, you are under positive orders to sack all, &c. You will in like manner treat all those who set themselves to hamper the execution of our purpose by hostile acts; in that case you will make a point of wholly destroying their gardens and fruit trees.\n\nColombo, February 13, 1766.*\n\n* Apparently issued the day before the signing of the Treaty of Peace!\u2014B., Hon.

With this object the Commissioners appointed to define the boundaries will make the necessary arrangements regarding the collection of the revenue.\n\nFifth Article.\n\nOn the other hand, the illustrious Company recognizes the supreme rule of His Majesty as independent Lord Paramount of the other districts in the Island of La\u1e45k\u0101.\n\nSixth Article.\n\nThe several districts which the illustrious Company has taken by force of arms in this war will be restored to [His Majesty\u2019s] Supreme Government by the Company, from their love of peace and of pure freewill, excepting places, districts, and sundry coast line within two p\u0113yas\u2019 walk from the seashore, to which they are entitled in terms of the third Article.\n\nSeventh Article.\n\nAll servants and subjects, high and low, of His Majesty, will be permitted to remove as much salt as they reasonably need from l\u0113v\u0101yas and other salterns on the east [coast], and from Chilaw and Puttalam on the west [coast], without paying any charge to the Company or to any one on its behalf.\nEighth Article.\n\nIn like manner, the Company will be permitted to peel cinnamon from the whole extent of the Low country belonging to the Kandyan King, to wit, from Sabaragamuwa Dis\u00e1va, the Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, the Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, as far as Balana.\n\nNinth Article.\n\nThe cinnamon growing to the east beyond Balana-kanda in the hill-country, His Majesty will cause to be peeled by His Majesty\u2019s subjects, and deliver it solely to the Company at Galle, Colombo, and M\u00e1tara. Good, fine cinnamon will be paid for at the rate of five pagodas for each parduva: each parduva must weigh 88 lb.\n\nTenth Article.\n\nIvory, pepper, cardamoms, coffee, arecanuts, beeswax: the Company will have the monopoly of purchasing these articles:\n\n1 lb. pepper at 4 stuivers, or $\\frac{1}{2}$ part of a pagoda, but subject to a deduction of 5 lb. on every 100 lb. on account of the drying.\n\n1 lb. coffee at 2 stuivers, or $\\frac{1}{8}$ of a pagoda, similarly deducting 5 lb. on every 100 lb.\n\n1 amuna of 26,000 well-dried arecanuts at 3 rixdollars, or $1\\frac{1}{2}$ pagoda.\n\n100 lb. of well-cleaned beeswax at 25 rixdollars, or $12\\frac{1}{2}$ pagodas.\n\nEleventh Article.\n\nThe Company not having traded at any time here in ivory, and being unaware of its value, an arrangement will hereafter be come to in respect of this Article.\n\nTwelfth Article.\n\nFurther, in future if the Company requires anything from any part of the Kandyan King\u2019s territory, a fair price will be fixed for the same.\n\nThirteenth Article.\n\nAll lawful trade of every kind may be carried on between the subjects of the two parties. The subjects within His Majesty\u2019s dominions may come to Colombo, Galle, and every other place and buy and sell without prohibition, and with the same permission, tranquillity, and liberty that is enjoyed by the Company\u2019s subjects: in like manner the Company\u2019s subjects may trade within His Majesty\u2019s dominions. Thus the people of one nationality will not possess privileges greater than those of the other nationality: henceforth the people of the two nationalities will be regarded as one.\n\nFourteenth Article.\n\nIt being conducive to the benefit of both parties to endeavour to increase native products and to interdict illicit trade, His Majesty\u2019s Government and the Company undertake to do both, and pledge their word to assist each other. Further, should anything belonging to any of the Company\u2019s subjects happen to be seized within the Kandyan King\u2019s territory, it shall be confiscated for the use of the Kandyan King\u2019s Treasury without question; contrarywise should\nanything belonging to one of His Majesty's subjects happen to be seized within the Company's territories, it shall be appropriated for the use of the Company.\n\nFifteenth Article.\n\nIf the Kandyan Court requires any articles from a foreign country (provided always that the goods are to be had there), the Company will procure them for His Majesty according to samples.\n\nSixteenth Article.\n\nOn the other hand, His Majesty and the Principal Officers of the Kandyan Court undertake to deliver to the Company at Batticaloa and Trincomalee such timber as may be required by the Company.\n\nSeventeenth Article.\n\nAll captives, whether Hollanders, Malays, or Sepoys; and various deserters, whether Hollanders or native soldiers; and the many rebels who have fled from the Company's territory, shall be sent back with the utmost despatch, and the Company's cannon taken from Gurub\u0119vila and other places shall be restored to the Company.\n\nEighteenth Article.\n\nHereafter those who desert from either party, and slaves who have escaped, shall be seized and promptly handed over; and the owner of the slaves shall pay 10 rixdollars on account of each slave as a reward for the person who seized and returned them.\n\nNineteenth Article.\n\nIf any subject of the Company within His Majesty's dominions do any outrageous act, or commit an offence deserving of corporal punishment, he shall be seized by His Majesty's men and delivered to the Company, together with proofs of his crime. The Company shall then inflict on him suitable punishment, and shall mete out justice to the party wronged by paying compensation for loss sustained. If an inhabitant of His Majesty's country do any outrageous act or commit an offence within the Company's territories, the same action shall be taken by the Company.\n\nTwentieth Article.\n\nBy this means close friendly relations will be maintained between the two powers. Moreover, the powerful Company undertakes to afford protection to His Majesty and all the Royal domain in external disturbances of every kind; while His Majesty and the leading honourable Members of the Chief Council of Ministers of the Kandyan Court promise not only to assist the Company, on such an occasion, to the utmost of their power, whether by weapons, accoutrements, or by soldiers, or bearers, or in any other way, but to continue to render such assistance in full until the enemy is completely expelled from the Island of La\u1e45k\u0101.\n\nTwenty-first Article.\n\nNeither His Majesty nor the leading honourable Members of the Chief Council of Ministers of the Kandyan Court will form a\nfriendly alliance or make an agreement on lower terms with any European power, except only with the Hollanders. They promise not only to deliver over to the Company every person, every European penetrating into the interior, but also to abstain from making an agreement or pledge with any Indian prince to the prejudice of the interests of the Company.\n\nTwenty-second Article.\n\nIn like manner, the powerful Company pledges itself not to make an agreement with any power to the prejudice of the Kandyan Court at any time.\n\nTwenty-third Article.\n\nIn order to strengthen the friendly relations between the two parties, ambassadors will be despatched to and from each party. On such occasions all necessary particulars regarding the supply of salt and dried fish and the peeling of cinnamon may be discussed. Further, as befits intimate friends and those who enter into agreements, ambassadors of each party will be received with customary honours, and these customary honours will be paid in full to both parties alike.\n\nTwenty-fourth Article.\n\nThe Articles of the Treaty will be strictly and carefully observed and maintained by both parties. Should anything contrary to the purport of any Article of this Treaty, or of any matter appearing in the agreement, be neglected, peace and friendship shall not be ruptured thereby; but the aggrieved party must make complaint and ask for redress. Then arrangements will be made for [a settlement of] the matter within six weeks.\n\nTwenty-fifth Article.\n\nShould, however, notice have been given in any case, and satisfaction not have been afforded within six weeks, or dissatisfaction [at the decision expressed], then, as mentioned above, the defaulting party shall be deemed guilty of breach of the agreement. Moreover, it is not lawful, on that account, for the aggrieved party to show force of arms to the party in default.\n\nWe, the hereunder signed ambassadors of His Supreme Majesty of the hill-country, the Chief Emperor possessing universal dominion, and the subduer of powerful foes, in accordance with the command and intention of our Supreme Lord, hereby certify that we have concluded this Treaty, in peace and friendship as mentioned above, with Hot Pit Lednart de Kosta Oppra Kopman [sic], the Maha Dis\u00e1va of Colombo, and with Yo\u00e1n Verradwan \u00c1ngalb\u00e9k Oppra K\u00f3pman [sic], the Chief Secretary, who were specially commissioned for that purpose by His Excellency the Governor, Mester Wellam [sic] Palk; and, moreover, we hereby promise that the said agreement will be graciously accepted by the Supreme Lord, the Chief Emperor possessing universal dominion, and the subduer of powerful foes; that the leading very\nhonourable Members of the Chief Council of Ministers of the Kandyan Court will give their assent to the said agreement; that, further, His Majesty will affix his Royal Sign Manual; that the Chief Ministers of the Kandyan Court will affix their signatures, and that it will be attested by the Government Seals.\n\nAt Colombo, on the 14th day of the month of February, in the year One thousand Seven hundred and Sixty-six.*\n\n* No reference is made in the above Treaty to a heavy war indemnity and other humiliating conditions, the annual delivery of elephants, and the special transfer of the pearl fisheries to the Dutch\u2014all of which find a place in (A) Eschelckron and (B) Percival. Possibly there was a further Treaty.\n\nA.\n\n1. The Emperor shall keep within the mountains, and have nothing to do with the coasts, where the Company may throw up as many fences as they please, and increase or diminish them at pleasure.\n\n2. The Emperor shall pay all the extraordinary expenses incurred by the Honourable Company during this war, and occasioned by him, the whole amounting to 10,000,000 of piastres.\n\n3. And whereas the Emperor gives his word that he is not able to do this with specie, he shall therefore discharge it by three installations, partly in cinnamon, and partly in other articles of commerce.\n\n4. The Emperor shall by his subjects, the Cingalese, not only throw up again every fence, redoubt, &c., that has been destroyed, but shall likewise assist the Dutch, at his own expense, in every new fortification in future to be erected.\n\n5. Candia shall be restored again to the Emperor; and in other respects, all and every contract, made previously to this, is hereby confirmed and renewed. (Eschelckron, pp. 305-307.)\n\nB.\n\nAll those parts of the sea coast which had not formerly belonged to the Dutch were now conceded to them, with the addition of several other tracts which they reckoned advantageous for their purposes. They insisted that the king should have no intercourse with any other power whatever; and that he should deliver up all foreigners or subjects of other princes who should happen to come into his dominions. All cinnamon which grew on the coasts was to be considered as exclusively Dutch property; and the natives, by way of special privilege, were allowed quietly to cut and carry it to the several Dutch factories on the island. The cinnamon growing in the woods was allowed to be, in some degree, the property of the natives; they were obliged to peel it and sell it to the Dutch at a rix-dollar a pound. The King of Candy was also obliged to stipulate that his subjects should gather the pepper, cardamoms, coffee, and cotton growing in the interior, and sell them to the Dutch at certain very low prices. A certain proportion of elephants' teeth, arekanut, and betel leaf, together with a share of the precious stones found in their country, formed part of the tribute imposed\n5. At the request of Mr. Buultjens, Mr. Joseph read an extract from the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 referring to Van Eck\u2019s expedition.*\n\n6. Mr. Haly drew attention to the word \u201cgrasshopper,\u201d which was supposed to relate to a sort of firearm. He mentioned a most extraordinary kind of firearm from Kandy that had just been presented to the Museum by Mr. Kindersley, and which would answer the description very well.\n\nMr. White understood that \u201cgrasshopper\u201d\u2020 was a small fieldpiece\n\non the natives. The number of elephants to be delivered up was fifty in the two seasons; these the Dutch transported to the opposite coast of the continent, and sold to the native princes there at very high prices, as the elephants of Ceylon are accounted superior to all others. The pearl fisheries in the west and north-west shores where the pearl banks are situated formed another acquisition to the Dutch by this treaty. Several persons from the Malabar coast and other parts of the continent had established cotton manufactories in the northern town of the island, particularly at Jaffnapatam; all these were now given over to the dominion of the Dutch.\n\nIn return for all these valuable acquisitions, the Dutch acknowledged the King of Candy to be Emperor of Ceylon, with a long string of other sounding titles, which could only serve by their mockery to aggravate his mortification; and under these magnificent appellations they engaged, as his dutiful subjects, to pay him a tribute and to send ambassadors yearly to his court. The most valuable condition granted to him, and indeed that for which he had consented to the hard terms of this Treaty, was a stipulation on the part of the Dutch to supply his people with salt, free of expense, and in such a quantity as to equal their consumption. The tribute to be paid him was to consist of a certain part of the produce or its value, of the ceded tracts along the coast; but this article was soon infringed upon, and indeed scarcely one stipulation of the Treaty was fulfilled with good faith.\n\n(Percival.)\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\n\n* See Appendix A, ante.\n\n\u2020 Mr. White, in a subsequent communication to the Hon. Secretary, wrote:\n\n\u201cDavy, page 128, note, I think elucidates \u2018grasshoppers.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe jingal is a very small and long piece of ordnance light enough to be carried with ease by a single man, and very well adapted for a desultory warfare among mountains. It is fired on the ground resting on a long slender butt end and a pair of legs. They were carried by the Paduwa caste.\u201d\n\n[Mr. White was correct in his explanation of \u201cgrasshopper\u201d (Dutch sprinkhaan) as \u201ca fieldpiece with two small legs in the front,\u201d but it is curious that none of the speakers mentioned that the English name is \u201cgingall\u201d and the Sinhalese kodituvakkava. For the use of the former word in English the earliest date given in Yule\u2019s \u201cHobson-Jobson\u201d and the Hist. Eng. Dict. is 1818: but earlier instances occur in the narratives of the Kandyan campaigns. For instance, in Cordiner, II., 190, we read that in 1803, at Hangurank\u0113\u1e6da, the British troops \u201cfound nothing worth carrying away excepting a few Candian guns, commonly known by the\nwith two legs in front, something like an enlarged toy cannon resting on two legs. Even in field guns now in use there was a part called the \"hopper.\"\n\n7. Mr. Harward asked for information regarding the fate of the unfortunate Mr. Rein, Mr. Stork, and others, who were left in Kandy. The Paper left them in an extremely bad way.\n\nMr. Buultjens stated that the Dutch manuscript left it silent.*\n\n8. Mr. White mentioned the name of a Col. Vanneck, who inherited an Irish peerage, whom he had met, and compared it to that of Baron Van Eck. Perhaps there may have been some connection.\n\nThe President observed that the Vannecks were settled in England long before the period in question.\u2020\n\nMr. Gunaratna stated that the war referred to was versified in the Sinhalese poem called Mah\u00e1-hatana,\u2021 in which it was related that a great many of those stragglers were slain at Sit\u00e1waka.\n\nname of jinjal pieces, or grasshoppers.\" In the glossary at the end of Corderer's work we have: \"Jinjal. A matchlock, or large musket, which rests upon long legs, hence, also, called a grasshopper.\" The Sinhalese name appears to have been borrowed from the Tamil; but the last part is ultimately Turkish t\u00f3p, \"cannon.\" I do not know when kodituvakku were first used by the Sinhalese; but they are frequently referred to by the Dutch writers on Ceylon.\n\nThe late Mr. Wm. Skeen, in his valuable monograph on \"Adam's Peak,\" says (p. 124) that when he visited the Maha Saman D\u00e9val\u00e9 at Ratnapura in 1869, \"inside the hall were .......... six antique-looking gingalls, some of which we found to be of but very rough and modern manufacture. They were eighteen inches long, with an inch thickness of metal, and a bore an inch in diameter. Each was firmly fixed upon a three-legged carriage raised about eighteen inches from the ground.\" Opposite p. 97 is a woodcut (from a photograph, apparently), in which three of these curious pieces are shown. Mr. Bell, Archaeological Commissioner, noticed one at Medagoda Dewal\u00e9, Three K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, in 1890.\u2014D. W. F. in Ceylon Observer, July 15, 1899.]\n\n* Mr. Rein died shortly afterwards: as Wolf says cynically, the Commandant \"went over to Eternity, and left the corpse to its fate.\" He adds that Rein had been a tailor before he was appointed Commander of Trincomalee, and very skilful in making clothes for the wives of state officials; from which fact he draws a moral. Stork was more fortunate; he survived, and served the Government for many years after.\u2014D. W. F., loc. cit.\n\n\u2020 Vanneck is the family name of Baron Huntingfield, whose ancestor Joshua Vanneck, a wealthy London merchant, was created a baronet in 1751. He was, therefore, a contemporary of Baron Van Eck's.\u2014D. W. F., loc. cit.\n\n\u2021 An error. The Mah\u00e1-hatana relates to fighting between the Portuguese and Kandyans of a century and more earlier.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\n9. Mr. Buultjens, in answer to the Chairman, said that the letters he read were given in an appendix to the Dutch manuscript. They were probably all written by the same person.\n\n10. Mr. C. M. Fernando proposed a vote of thanks to the two gentlemen whose Papers were read that night. They had been much absorbed in the second Paper; but he ventured to think Mr. Ferguson's Paper was of equal interest. That Paper referred to history in the Portuguese era. It was very gratifying to note the interest Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Buultjens took in the history of Ceylon during the Portuguese and Dutch periods, and he hoped that out of their repertoire would come many more Papers relating to times of which so far the records were still scant. In this connection he was glad to see that Mr. Anthonisz was, on the orders of Government, looking into the old Dutch records preserved in the Record Office, Colombo, and elsewhere.\n\nAs regards this expedition he found two opposite versions. The author of Mr. Buultjens' Paper refers to the Sighalese as \"the most cowardly race under the sun,\" while in the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 extract which had just been read there was quite \"another story.\" The Sighalese kings had not all the resources of civilization at their disposal, and it was their policy to run away. When the expedition reached Kandy, the king, Kirti \u015ari R\u0101ja Sigha, fled to Hangurank\u0113\u1e6da. But the Dutch Governor made a great mistake in leaving all his forces in Kandy, and none between Kandy and Colombo. That was what his generals complained about. He stationed some 2,000 men there, and the Kandyan king did the best thing he could have done\u2014that was, ran away and left all these men to starve where they were. What the Dutch historian termed \"cowardice\" the Sighalese historian called \"tactics.\"\n\n\"He who fights and runs away,\nMay live to fight another day.\"\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nMr. Guneratna seconded the vote of thanks, which was carried unanimously.\n\n11. Mr. F. H. Price proposed a vote of thanks to the Bishop of Colombo for presiding. They were all aware how much the Society owed to the presence of the Bishop of Colombo at their Meetings; and they would support him in the assertion that, without the Presidency of the Bishop, the Society would lose very much of its prestige.\n\nMr. White seconded; and the vote was carried with acclamation. The Proceedings then terminated.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, June 20, 1899.\n\nPresent:\nMr. F. M. Mackwood in the Chair.\nMr. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my. | Dr. W. G. Vandort.\nMr. J.

C. B., R. A. S.,\nColombo, March 20, 1899.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Council of this Society to represent to the Government the desirability of undertaking and completing the work of indexing the manuscript records of the Dutch administration of the Island.\n\n2. It would appear that a rough index of a certain portion of the records was made, which it was the intention of the Government to amplify in time, but the index was lost.\n\n3. As regards the great body of the Dutch Records, it is therefore impossible to ascertain with any certainty their true contents.\n\n4. An excellent Handbook of Madras Records by Mr. J. Tolboys Wheeler, published in 1861, might serve as a precedent to the Ceylon Government for the compilation of a similar summary of the Dutch Records.\n\n5. The historical importance of, and interest attaching to, these records have been illustrated from time to time by the translations of extracts that have been published in the Society's Journals.\n\n6. The records, apart from being of interest to the students of Ceylonese history, are of special interest to the Government, as they comprehend every incident of the administration of the country from the largest question of State policy to the minutest details of social life from 1641 (two years after the Dutch first established a footing in Ceylon) to 1795, when their rule was displaced by the British.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nG.

The Chairman said there were two Papers to be read that evening. They were indebted to Mr. D. W. Ferguson for both. The first was a very interesting Paper produced by research into old archives. Lately the Society had had several very valuable Papers contributed, which had been brought about by the same cause\u2014the discovery of old mural tablets, stones, and such like: one was found at the root of the Breakwater only the other day, which elicited much information of antiquarian interest.\n\n4. Mr. Joseph read the following Paper:\u2014\nTHE INSCRIBED MURAL STONE AT THE MAHA SAMAN D\u00c9V\u00c1L\u00c9, RATNAPURA.\n\nBy D. W. FERGUSON.\n\n[In January, 1896, when I was last in Ceylon, Mr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner, sent me a copy of a photograph of the inscribed mural stone at the Maha Saman D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9, Ratnapura, taken by Mr. J. W. Robertson of the Survey Department, as well as an impression and an eye copy of the inscription made by Mr. Bell\u2019s Head Overseer. These I compared with the stone itself when visiting Ratnapura in September, 1896. Mr. Bell asked me to write a note on the subject for the C. A. S. Journal; and I should have done so were this had I not been under the impression that Mr. W. E. Davidson, C.C.S., intended to deal with the matter. Since my return to England I have made further research and inquiry; and though I have not been able to clear up all the mystery surrounding the stone, I hope that the following notes will enable some one else to do so.]\n\nThe late Mr. William Skeen, in chapter V. of his Adam\u2019s Peak, gives a pretty detailed description of the famous Hind\u00fa-Buddhist temple near Ratnapura, known as the Maha Saman D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9; and in the course of his description he says (pp. 125, 126):\n\nLet into a niche in the basement of the raised quadrangle, a little to the north of the flight of steps leading from the outer courtyard, is a mural stone of some historic value, and of singular interest from the strange and unexpected position in which it is found. On it, sculptured in bold relief, are two figures about half the size of life. They represent the closing event of a mortal combat between a Portuguese, armed cap-\u00e0-pie, and a Sighalese warrior. Conquered in the encounter, the latter has been stricken down; his sword and shield are cast despairingly aside; and his antagonist, trampling under foot his prostrate form, is now with one final blow about to deprive him of his life. The inscription below, partly in Roman and partly in Sighalese characters, is so much effaced as to be only very partially readable;\nMURAL STONE, MAHA SAMAN D\u00c9V\u00c1L\u00c9, RATNAPURA.\n\nPhoto by Mr. J. W. Robertson,\nSurvey Dept.\n\nEngraved by Messrs. W. L. H. Skeen & Co.,\nColombo and Kandy.\nsome portions of the figures are also damaged, seemingly from the action of the weather upon the stone. The whole is, however, most spiritedly executed, and enough of the inscription remains to show that the name of the Portuguese soldier was Gomez. The Sinhalese say the prostrate warrior was their champion, one Kuruwita Bandara, a dreaded enemy of the Portuguese, whose soldiers he had repeatedly cut off, and that some fifty had fallen by his hand ere he himself was slain. The sculpture was no doubt executed in Europe by royal or vice-regal command, and sent hither to do honour to the soldier whose valorous deed it commemorated.\n\nThe above is the only reference to this stone that I have met with in the many writers on Ceylon\u2014Portuguese, Dutch, and English\u2014whose works I have searched for information regarding it; and yet it is undoubtedly some three centuries old; though how long it has been in its present position, and whether it was originally placed near the spot it now occupies, are questions which may well arise in one's mind.\n\nMr. Skeen's description contains several errors. I think it more probable that the sculpture was executed in Ceylon, where there would be no lack of artists in the Portuguese ranks competent for the work. There are no Sinhalese characters in the inscription, which is entirely in Portuguese. Moreover the name of the Portuguese warrior (who is hardly \"armed cap-\u00e0-pie\") was not Gomez, though any one ignorant of Portuguese might easily conclude so from deciphering the first few letters.\n\nThe inscription, so far as I have been able to decipher it, is as follows (I expand the contractions, and separate the combined letters):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{COM} \\cdot \\text{ESTA}^* \\cdot \\text{RENDI} \\cdot \\text{ESTE}^\u2020 \\cdot \\text{HA} \\cdot 23^\u2021 \\cdot \\text{ANNOS} \\cdot \\text{QVE} \\cdot \\\\\n\\text{ANDO} \\cdot \\text{NA} \\cdot \\text{INDIA} \\cdot \\text{E} \\cdot \\text{HA} \\cdot 15^\u2021 \\cdot \\text{QVE} \\cdot \\text{SIRVO} \\cdot \\text{DE} \\cdot \\text{CA} \\\\\n\\text{PITAO} \\cdot \\text{E} \\cdot \\text{T\u00c3OQVE}\u00a7 \\cdot \\text{OS} \\cdot \\text{REIS} \\ldots \\text{DE} \\ldots \\text{E} \\cdot \\text{O} \\cdot \\text{REI} \\cdot \\\\\n\\text{DE} \\cdot \\text{IAFANAPATAO} \\cdot \\text{EV} \\cdot \\text{SIMAO} \\cdot \\text{PINHAO} \\cdot \\text{O VENCI}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n* Scil. espada. \u2020 Scil. homem. \u2021 Conjectural. \u00a7 Or ao que?\n\nTranscript.\n\n[Com esta rendi este, ha 23 (?) annos que ando na India, e ha 15 (?) que sirvo de capit\u00e3o; e t\u00e3oque (?) os reis...de...

But who was he? And who was the foe he overcame? And what was the event which the stone commemorates? These three questions I shall consider in their order.\n\n(1) Who was Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o?\n\nIt is unfortunate that the above inscription contains no date, and that the figures given are so worn as to be scarcely legible. We learn from it that our hero had been 23 (?) years in India, and 15 (?) years a captain, at the time when he performed the deed of valour which he thus blazons forth to an admiring world! This, however, does not help us very much. Having written to Sr. David Lopes of Lisbon for any information he could give me regarding Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, that gentleman very kindly applied to the authorities at the Torre do Tombo, who sent him the following document, which, they say, is the only one they know of referring to the person in question:\n\nDom Sebasti\u00e3o, etc.\u2014A todo Vos corregedores ouvydores Juizes e Justi\u00e7as de meus Reynnos e Senhoryos que esta minha carta de perd\u00e3o for mostrada e o conhecimento della com direito pertencer.

Greeting. I do you to wit, that Sym\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, minor son of Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, a man who lives by his fortune, a resident of the village of Punhete, sent to inform me by his petition that he had been imprisoned in the jail of the said village and accused by one Jorge Fernandes, a resident of the said village, of having given him a sword-cut on the face, for which cause he was condemned to five years\u2019 banishment in Africa with proclamation in court; and that before being released he escaped from the said jail by the door thereof, without breaking iron or wood, or breaching wall, or roof, or door; and as he went in hiding through fear of being captured, he therefore begged me to grant him the favour of pardoning him for his escape from the said jail. And having seen what he, the suppliant, sent thus to tell and beg me, if it is so as he says, and there is nothing besides, and desiring to grant him the favour, having seen a Praz-me* signed by the doctor Sim\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Cardoso of my council and my judge of the King\u2019s court and of petitions, to whom I have given authority so to do, I think right and it is my pleasure to pardon him and acquit him of the fault that he has committed in escaping from the jail at Punhete, of which he makes mention in his petition in the manner that is stated therein, and he shall pay three hundred reis for the expenses of the Supreme Court, and within thirty days from the giving of this he shall present himself before the judge of the case\n\n* Document commencing with the words \u201cIt is my pleasure.\u201d\u2014D.W.F.\nfor the execution of the sentence. And for as much as he paid the said three hundred reis for the expenses of the Supreme Court to Mateus Rodrigues, the authorized receiver of the money appropriated for the said expenses, I was certified thereof by a document signed by him, and by another from Paullo Correa, who entered them against him in the ledger for his father Baltesar de Freytas, scrivener of the said charge. I command you that if he fulfils what has been said from henceforth you do not seize him nor order him to be seized, nor do him or cause to be done to him any harm or any other wrong whatever by reason of the matter set forth in his petition and in this my letter; because my favour and will is to thus pardon him in the manner that has been said: which comply with and do not otherwise.\u2014Given in this city of Lisbon on the Eleventh day of the month of August. Our Lord the King commanded it by the doctor Sima\u00f5 Gon\u00e7alves Cardoso and by the licentiate Francisco Dias do Amaral, noble of his household and chancellor of the orders and masterships of our Lord Jesus Christ, St. James, and Avis, both of his council and his judges of the King's court and petitions. Antonio Pinheiro made it in the year of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, One thousand Five hundred and Seventy-one.\u2014Luis Fellgueira caused it to be written.\n\nThat the Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o of the above proclamation is identical with the hero of the Ratnapura inscription is, I think, extremely probable; and I have no doubt that his father was glad to ship him off to India to exercise his pugnacity in a direction that would not entail further demands on the paternal income. When he sailed for the East I cannot say; but after the lapse of a quarter of a century we again hear of him breaking out of prison! In a royal letter to the Viceroy of India, dated Lisbon, March 10, 1598, occurs the following*:\n\nThe licentiate Jusse Paes, judge of cases, wrote me by the ships of the past year .......... He says that to the office of judge of cases to which the viceroy\u2020 appointed him on coming from Malaca appertains the trial of the culprits concerned in the sack of the ship of the Melique which went ashore on the coast at Ba\u00e7aim, and that one Sima\u00f5 Pinha\u00f5 condemned in a sum of money towards my revenue escaped from the jail to this kingdom, upon which all diligence was used here to apprehend him; and I was informed that he had not embarked, and that he had remained in Cochim, wherefore it is needful to exercise diligence with regard to him, if it has not already been done.\n\n* I translate from the original as printed in the Arch.

F.\nOwing to the irreparable loss of Couto's eleventh Decade I am unable to furnish any details in connection with the facts referred to in the above passage; and I am even doubtful as to the identity of the culprit named with our Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o; for in Couto's twelfth Decade we find him referred to, even in 1597, as if he had been for some time in Ceylon. If the two are identical, I can only suppose that, for his offences of looting and prison-breaking, our hero was sentenced to the then very common punishment of banishment for a term of years to Ceylon. How he conducted himself in this Island we shall now see.\n\nIn chapter VI. of Book I. of his twelfth Decade* Couto describes how Dom Jo\u00e3o (Vimala Dharma S\u00faryaya I.), with the allied forces of the King of Uva and the princes of Dinavaca (Denavaka), planned an attack upon the lately erected fort of Corvite (Kuruvita); and how the commander of the fort, Salvador Pereira da Silva, learning of this intention, marched against the Kandyan camp with a small but picked body of men, and attacking the enemy unawares caused them to retreat in confusion with great loss. Couto adds that \"this victory was so famous, and created such amazement among the Chingal\u00e1s, that they henceforth bestowed upon Salvador Pereira the sobriquet of Corvite Capit\u00e3o.\"\n\nIn chapter XIII. of the same book\u2020 we are told how D. Jo\u00e3o dispatched against the Portuguese forces in the territories of Galle and M\u00e1tara \"a Prince called Madune Pandar,\"\u2021 and the rebel Sim\u00e3o Correa, brother of Domingos Correa Bicanarsinga, of whom I have spoken many times, whom D. Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo had ordered to be executed.|| .............

Sim\u00e3o Correa returned to the Portuguese side later on, but was always a suspect.\u2014D. W. F.\nThe Kandyan forces encamped six leagues from M\u00e1tara, where the Portuguese camp was, the captain-major of the latter being Dom Fernando Mudaliy\u0101r,* and the field-captain Salvador Pereira. The enemy chose an elevated site, which they strongly fortified, hoping by this means to dominate the whole of the surrounding territory. And now Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o enters on the scene. We read:\n\nOf this expedition and design D. Jeronymo de Azevedo was quickly advised, whereupon in great haste he dispatched Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o with six hundred native Lascarins and some Portuguese, with an order to take another hundred soldiers from the Fortress of Gall\u00e9, with which they would make up one hundred and fifty Portuguese and two thousand Lascarins, which was a force sufficient to attack that fort. D. Fernando Modeliar, as soon as this force joined him, at once proceeded to attack the enemy; and when he got to the top, they were already on their guard, and collected in the fort with a thousand firelock-men, leaving ambushed in the forest two thousand Lascarins with the most trustworthy Modeliars, with an order to fall on the rear of our troops when they were most fully engaged in the assault. D. Fernando took care not to delay the business, but at once with great determination attacked the enemy, to which end he had already brought many pavises, mantelets, and scaling-ladders; and in the assault on the stockades they encountered stakes, in which they became entangled, and stopped, becoming exposed to the firelock fire of the enemy, who took a pretty fair aim at them, several Lascarins falling and some Portuguese being wounded, among whom were Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o,\u2020 Pero de Abreu Modeliar, and others. Nevertheless our men pushed forward and attacked the fort with great courage, setting up the ladders, by which some began to mount. And while they were in this turmoil, those in ambush burst upon them with great uproar and attacked our men in the rear, who on feeling them relinquished the combat, and turned upon the enemy with great fury, and attacked them in such a fashion that they made them retire to the forests whence they came, leaving many dead.\n\nD. Fernando Modeliar seeing the result, and like a prudent man recognizing that if they retired from there the territories would be lost, fortified himself in the same place as well as he could, and sent to advise the Captain-General of everything, and of the state in which the enemy were. On receipt of this message he at once dispatched his brother D. Manoel de Azevedo with several companies of soldiers, whom he ordered to come from Seitavaca and from the garrisons on the frontier of Dinavaca, of which the tyrant D. Jo\u00e3o soon had\n\n* See regarding this man, Monthly Lit. Reg., vol. IV., p. 165 n.\u2014D. W. F.\n\u2020 The original has \u201co Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe (well-known) S. P.\u201d\u2014D.W.F.\nadvice: and with the same promptitude he dispatched the King of Uva with three thousand men to succour his forces, and with the order that before the succour reached our troops he was to try to unite and surprise and defeat them, which would be easy for him to do, as the road was shorter for him. And so he came with much promptitude and sat down three leagues from our camp, whence he sent to get information of the fort, and to those who were hidden in ambush, who were waiting ready to fall on our troops on all sides the next day.\n\nD. Manoel de Azevedo also made such haste, that he arrived almost at the same time. The night that the King of Uva arrived the Modeliar D. Fernando heard many firelock shots; and guessing what it was he sent a spy to inquire what had occurred, who shortly returned and said that it was the King of Uva, who was encamped a little over a league away; and having given an account of all to Salvador Pereira and the other captains, all were of opinion that they should attack him that same night in his encampment before he had joined the others. And he immediately dispatched Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o and D. Henrique Modeliar with all the native Lascarins; and such haste did they make, that in the third watch of the night they fell upon the enemy and attacked them with great determination and courage; and as they took them unawares they created great havoc among them; and not knowing what was the matter, they were like to have been totally routed, but, regaining their wits, they seized their arms and commenced to wield them with great spirit, so that our Lascarins were almost put to rout, if it had not been for the prowess of Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, who was greatly dreaded by the Chingal\u00e1s, who that day did such marvels, that he put the King of Uva to a total rout, and continued pursuing him for a long distance, in which he slew many of his men and captured many arms and spoils.\n\nAfter this victory our troops returned to the camp, and it gave such courage to the rest, that they at once proceeded to attack those in the stockade, some carrying cavaliers of wood, which they had manufactured for that purpose, in order to engage them with firelocks from above, which they did with such determination, and with so much damage to them, that they drove them to desperation, as they saw that our men did not attempt to take them by assault, but to destroy them little by little with their harquebusade until they could easily capture them; and seeing themselves so hard pressed they determined to escape one night at all risks; and so in the first watch they sallied forth from the stockade with their arms in their hands, and like desperate men attacked our forces to see if they could break their ranks and pass through them; but our men were not so much off their guard as not at once to perceive their purpose; and surrounding them they caused among them such great loss and destruction, that there escaped only the two rebellious princes, who during the confusion slunk away, and in the darkness of the night managed to conceal themselves in the forests. There died there the flower of the forces of Candea, and the chief\nModeliars, and those who more than all others made war on us. In the fort were left all the arms and spoils of the enemies, which were many.\n\nIn this engagement were present Salvador Pereira da Silva, Field-Captain, D. Manoel de Azevedo, Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, Antonio da Silva de Affonseca, Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Meirelles, Jo\u00e3o Serr\u00e3o da Cunha, Filippe de Oliveira,* Sim\u00e3o Rabello, Gregoris da Costa de Sousa, one Fo\u00e3o\u2020 Pereira, Pero de Abreu Modeliar, D. Henrique Modeliar, and many others who have not come to my notice, and D. Fernando Modeliar as Captain-Major, all of whom performed doughty deeds. This took place in the month of October past of 1597.\n\nIn the next chapter Couto records further prowesses of our hero\u2019s. He says:\u2014\n\nHaving gained these victories over this tyrant, D. Jeronymo de Azevedo ordered the camp to return to the fort at Batugedere,\u2021 on the frontiers of Dinavaca, the commander of which was Salvador Pereira, and with him Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, in order to make all the war they could in those parts on the tyrant, as well in the Seven as the Four Corlas, where the enemy also endeavoured to make war so as to divert the Captain-General from that which our troops were waging against him in the parts about Matur\u00e9, where there remained a sufficient force to do this, on account of the parts where the General ordered this war to be carried on being weak and of little power. And he had the courage given him for this by a victory which he won over the native people who were on our side, which was the cause of some vassals rebelling in those parts of Seitavaca and Cota; and these districts which thus rebelled the tyrant endeavoured to support and defend, for which purpose he ordered a fort to be erected on the confines of the Four Corlas, in which he placed a large and good garrison of soldiers and Modeliars. As soon as the General had advice of this he gave orders that all the soldiers whom he had sent to those parts should unite and fortify themselves in the village of Atanagale,\u00a7 where there\n\n* Afterwards so famous, especially as the conqueror of the kingdom of Jaffna, of which he became captain, dying there in March, 1627.

F.\n\n\u00a7 This, with the passage following, contains the only reference by Couto to Attanagalla. Bocarro (Dec. 13) also mentions the place once only, in chapter CLXVIII., where we read of Domingos Carvalho\u2019s coming to the camp of Luiz Gomes \u201cby the way of Atanagale\u201d; unless, indeed, the \u201cpagode ... called Tanagale,\u201d spoken of in chapters CXIII.\u2013CXIV., where the Captain-Major Manuel Cesar, in December, 1616, fortified himself with \u201ca stockade of varichas,\u201d be the same, as I suspect. Valentyn, in his Ceylon, mentions Attanagalla; and Ryklof van Goens, writing in 1675\nwas stationed as Captain Francisco Pimentel, it being a strong place and suited to withstand the enemy, and to make the rebellious territories return to obedience. This fort Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o caused to be made. This vexed the tyrant greatly, and he ordered that war to be pursued with much ardour: wherefore the whole force was concentrated in the fort of Atanagale, whence our troops made several incursions into the enemy's territories, in which they slew and captured many, whereupon part of the rebellious districts returned to obedience, and the tyrant began to retire, and our forces advanced a day's march forward in order to get near him, because they had a great desire to encounter him.\n\nThe tyrant, seeing himself so closely pursued, ordered a good fort to be made on the top of a range near our force, and within our territories, in order both to support those who were obedient to him, and the better to be able to secure his own, and the other fort which he had on the confines of the Four Corlas, which was that on which they relied more than all. Our troops, having learnt of the fort that had been made close to them on the top of the range, assaulted it as soon as it was completed, and entered it with such determination and courage that with the death of many of the enemy they captured it, and razed it to the ground; and as those who were in the stockade of the Four Corlas did not seem willing to retire completely from our territories, but were rather confident of dominating them from there by means of several fortifications, which they had made in the passes where our troops might attack them, the General ordered the camp to advance thither; and in several skirmishes that they had there with the enemy they defeated them and put them to flight, and captured all their fortifications, whereupon they vacated the districts, and retreated to the limits of Seitavaca, and our soldiers committed conspicuous cruelties on the inhabitants of the villages which had rebelled, as an example to the others.*\n\nThe tyrant having learnt this, and fearing that our troops would next attack his fort and his stockades, sought to divert them from this, wherefore he sent the greater part of his force to the two chiefs of the Corlas, in order that they with the other rebels should attack our\n\non the state of Ceylon, says (Val., *Ceylon*, p. 231):\u2014\u201cFrom here [Malv\u00e1na] a road goes north-east through the Hina Corla to, a famous hilly Rock or Rocky Hill Attenegale, which was often a hindrance to the Portuguese, on account of its rocky surroundings, through which one has to go, and with a few men can withstand a large army; but we have overcome the difficulty with great labour, so that one now goes unhindered right through by Dangowitta to the great pass of Alauw.\u201d I do not know if any traces of Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o\u2019s fort remain. James Alwis, in his description of the temple, &c. (*Attanagalu-vansa*, pp. 94\u201398), mentions none.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n* Couto does not enter into details of these atrocities as do Bocarro and Faria y Sousa.

F.\nstockades in the direction of Chilao on the border of the sea so as to call our troops thither, and by this means secure the territories that he desired. Of this the General soon had intelligence, and advised those in the camp of everything, in order that they might be ready and on their guard, so as to fall on the enemy suddenly, or endeavour to enter their territories in order to oblige them to desist from that purpose; and because the place in which they had their camp was far from ours, and in the way there were great impediments in the form of rivers and marshes, they would not be able to overtake them without being discovered; wherefore it seemed better to enter their territories and attack their city itself, the capital of the Seven Corlas,* where the principal rebels resided, who at that time had gone forth with all their forces, waging war on our territories, because in that city they had their riches, wives, and children. And so they went marching with all haste, without resting night or day, fighting with the enemies who were on guard at several passes; and reaching the city which they were in search of, albeit they found it fortified with stockades and ditches, they attacked it with such determination that they entered it, a Modeliar who was left there as captain being killed, and many people, and the city was immediately set on fire and burnt with all its wealth, which was much, in order that our men might not embarrass themselves in the sack.\n\nHaving done this, our troops proceeded to retreat in very good order, and avoiding the road by which the chiefs might come to succour their city; and yet in those by which they retreated they did not fail to have much trouble, for they spent a whole day fighting with garrisons which the enemy had in different passes, whom they always left more or less wounded.\n\nThis affair having come to the knowledge of the Princes who were carrying on the war in our territories, they left all and hastened thither; and on the march our troops fell upon them and attacked the garrisons that remained in their stockades, and with the death of some and the flight of others drove them out of our territories, and furthermore entered into those of the enemy, where they did much damage, and captured many spoils. This took place between November past and the end of April of this year in which we now are of 1598; the tyrant D. Jo\u00e3o felt these things most keenly, because, besides the reputation that he lost with the Chingallas, he was now less dreaded by our people, who had killed his chief Captains and Modeliars, the rest of whom were so cowed that they now carried on the war feebly, and against their wishes, which were new weapons with which our troops continued fighting with them.\n\n* I do not know if this was Kurun\u00e9gala or Matt\u00e9gama, which Father Manoel Barradas describes in 1613 as \"capital of the Seven Corlas or Conselhos.\" (See Monthly Lit. Reg., IV., p. 155.)\u2014D. W. F.\nAnd because the tyrant feared, that with the succour that was coming from India our troops would capture the fort that he had on the confines of the Four Corlas, in which all his strength consisted, and the security of those districts, he determined to undertake that affair in person, in order both the better to provide for the safety of that fort, and by his presence to give energy to that war, and provoke and animate those inhabitants that were obedient to us to rebel and go over to him, to discourage our people, and divert the General from sending to make war on him as he was doing in the interior at his very doors, and also to free his people from the evils with which they were continually menaced by the daring and the victories that our troops daily won. In this he did not succeed as he imagined, because the General set so many spies upon him, that he could not take a step or form a plan, of which he was not immediately advised; upon which he acted with the necessary promptness, because to this were always due the victories that he gained; and the tyrant, in order to effect what he aimed at, betook himself to Candea, and marshalled two armies\u2014one of a thousand picked soldiers, whom he dispatched to the regions of Putal\u00e3o, in order to assist all the people of that district and to go against Chilao by the borders of the sea; and another of three thousand men, whom he ordered to fortify themselves on the frontier of the Seven Corlas; and this they did on the skirts of a mountain range, with the design, that should the General order an attack on any of these they would fall upon our men in the rear, by which means they thought they would gain a certain victory over them.\n\nThe General having been apprised of everything reformed the camp, ordering all the native soldiery to join it, who would be about two thousand two hundred Portuguese soldiers, the commander of whom was Salvador Pereira, and of the native troops Pinh\u00e3o and Francisco de Brito; and he ordered them to fortify themselves in a place called Tranqueira Alanha,* where they made a strong stockade of wood with its traverses, sentry-boxes, and ditches, so as to remain there in the midst of these two armies of enemies at an equal distance from one and the other, in order by this means to curb the foe, and make them lose the pride and the hopes that they had of prevailing against us, because thus they would not be able to succour one another, in that their forces were divided; and after having well fortified themselves our troops sallied forth full of vain-glory, leaving the stockade well\n\n* Stockade of Alanha, i.e., Allawwa. Perhaps Alanha is a misprint for Alauha. Ribeiro (II., chapter XVII.) has Lahoa, and Bocarro has \"the river of Laoa.\" Valentyn, in his map of Ceylon, shows \"Alanha\" (and \"Arandery\") on the \"Caymelle\" river, while \"Alauw\" is shown on a road some way south of this river. In his description of Ceylon he in one place identifies \"Alanha\" with \"Alauw,\" while in another place he distinguishes them. They are evidently one and the same. In Baldaeus's map the place is entered as \"Alaune.\"\u2014D. W. F.\nsupplied, and with great mettle proceeded to attack the stockade on the side of Seven Corlas, upon which they fell in the morning watch so unexpectedly, that they took them before they had yet finished the fort that they were making there, which was in the spurs of a mountain range, the forests of which they had cut down round about, leaving no more entrance to the fort than by two gorges, which also they had fortified with strong stockades, and in them had placed two thousand men; and the rest of the army was on the summit of the range, with the order that, on being attacked by our troops, they were to issue forth by a side way and fall on them in the rear.\n\nAs soon as our men reached the gorges they at once attacked the enemy with great determination; but the latter discharged their ammunition, whereby they brought down several of our Lascarins, and the rest began to retire, upon which the Portuguese hastened up and passed to the front, and engaged the enemy with such spirit that, in spite of the stubborn resistance that they met with from them, they forced their way in with the death of one of the Captains or Modeliars and many of his men; and whilst they were occupied with this victory the rebel Sim\u00e3o Correa, who was the one that was stationed on the summit of the range, came upon them and attacked our forces in the rear; but as they were all flushed with pride they turned upon them with an astonishing fury, and after the battle had lasted a long time they put the enemy to the rout and flight, and in the pursuit they killed many, and by the great mercy of God returned laden with arms, without its costing them more than two Portuguese and some native Lascarins.\n\nHaving won this victory, Salvador Pereira, who was the Captain-Major of this expedition, dispatched a thousand native firelock men with some Portuguese to attack the camp at Putal\u00e3o, before they should have news of the defeat of this other one; and on reaching the fort which they had made there they attacked it with the greatest determination; for besides the state of enthusiasm in which they were they carried additional arms, since they had doubled their firelocks with those that they had taken in the late victory, and with the same facility they entered the fort with the death of many of the enemy, among whom were five hundred Bagad\u00e1s,* people of the other coast, men of mettle, who had come to the help of the tyrant. The which caused such fear among the rest who had come over to that\n\n* An error for Badag\u00e1s. Further on (in liv. V., cap. I.) Couto speaks of Dom Jo\u00e3o\u2019s \u201choping for a succour of Badagas from the other coast.\u201d Bocarro (cap. CXV.) mentions a reported confederacy in 1616 of Sangili, the King of Jaffna, \u201cwith the Naique and Badagas of the other coast.\u201d (The index to Bocarro has \u201cBadagos, potentate of Ceylon\u201d!)

F.\nIsland, and to the others, when the news reached them there of the bad entertainment that our people had given them, that they did not desire to try their luck again under the banner of the tyrant. After this victory our men returned to their fort.\n\nThis news having reached the camp which the tyrant had in the Four Corlas, fearing that they would be immediately attacked by our forces, they abandoned everything and retired to Candea, for it seems that they were advised of the communications that the General carried on with those inhabitants, to get them to return to the obedience from which they had rebelled through the industry of the tyrant D. Jo\u00e3o, besides which several leading persons had already been coming to treat of this matter with the General, which was carried into effect, and he dispatched them together with the whole army (having already learnt of the victories that our troops had gained) to go and attack that fort, which they had already vacated, and where there remained only what the soldiers could glean, and they utterly dismantled it, in which they had labour enough, it being a large stronghold, and of much workmanship. With these victories the enemy was much discomfited, and our forces greatly elated. There were present in these actions Filippe de Oliveira, Jo\u00e3o Serr\u00e3o da Cunha, Gaspar de Azevedo, Francisco de Macedo, Francisco Gomes Leit\u00e3o, son of the other of the same name, Antonio da Costa Monteiro, and other Captains of companies and camps.\n\nConto then turns from the affairs of Ceylon to deal with other matters; and takes up the thread of the Island's history once more in chapter I. of book III., where he describes the erection, in September\u2013December, 1598, of a stone fortress at Manicravar\u00e9 (Menikkadavara),* which the General himself with his army occupied in January, 1599, and whence he sent Salvador da Pereira da Silva with two hundred Portuguese and two thousand Lascarins to engage the combined forces of the kings of Kandy and Uva, numbering five thousand men. In two fierce encounters the Portuguese defeated the enemy with great loss.\u2020\n\nThe next chapter\u2021 runs as follows:\u2014\n\nThe King of Huva, ashamed at being defeated so many times, and fearing the tyrant D. Jo\u00e3o, preferred to remain in the Seven Corlas at a great distance from the forts in which our troops were, and from\n\n---\n\n* See Bell's Report on the Kegalla District, p. 31.\u2014D. W.

F.\nthe region of Galitota,* and there the greater part of the men who had escaped from that defeat once more joined him. The tyrant D. Jo\u00e3o, as soon as he saw that expedition lost, in which he had had great confidence, determined to unite his forces and prosecute anew the war in that part; which he was not able to do, because his people were so cowed by those successes, and so disgusted with that war, that they did not wish to come, upon which the tyrant practised great cruelties towards them, ordering many to be beheaded, and sent and summoned the King of Huva to come, and went in person through his territories, collecting men until he had formed a respectable army, with which he once more dispatched that King with the order to avoid our forces, and to hinder the designs of D. Jeronymo, which were to oblige the natives of the Corlas to submit to the obedience in which they were before, in order the more easily with that power to undertake the conquest of the Kingdom of Candea, and bring the war to his very doors, so as thus to pen him in in such a fashion that either he would abandon his territories, or he would so persecute him as to kill him, or get him into his hands\u2020; which the tyrant understood well, and strove all he could to prevent. And for this purpose he had secret understandings with the Lascarins of our army, which was on the frontiers of Dinavaca, and by force of bribes made them go over to him, whereby those districts underwent a change.\n\nAs soon as our troops saw that the Lascarins had gone over to the enemy, they retired to the forts of Corvite and Batugedere, where they remained shut in, as they thought that every one was against them. At this time the General was on the frontiers of Candea occupied with the conquest which he wished to make of that kingdom, whereby the enemy had an opportunity of regaining courage, and committed several outrages in our territories, and entered them as far as in front of the stockades at Malvana. D. Jeronymo having been advised of this provided the stockade of Manicravar\u00e9, in which he was, with three companies of soldiers, the captains of which were Thom\u00e9 Coelho, who was commander of all, Jo\u00e3o Serr\u00e3o da Cunha, and Diogo de Araujo, and with provisions and munitions for many days.\u2020 And he with a company of soldiers and eight hundred Lascarins betook himself to the city of Seitavaca on account of its being in the middle of the whole kingdom, and nearer to the frontier of Dinavaca, where the enemy were in action; against whom he dispatched Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o with another company of soldiers and eight hundred Lascarins, who\n\n* In chapter I. this place is called Adegalitota, and is described as being on \"a river that divides the Seven Corlas from the Kingdom of Cota and Ceitavaca\": hence I imagine that Degalatiriya, in Kanduaha Pattu, on the Gurugo\u00f1a-oya, is meant; as I cannot find any place on the Maha-oya with a name resembling this. Further on, it will be seen, we have yet another version of the name, viz., Balitota.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u2020 Cf. Bell's Report on the K\u00e9galla District, l. c.\u2014D. W. F.\nencountered them in the village of Sofrag\u00e3o; and after having had a very obstinate encounter with them our men drove them from the field, on which they left many dead; and thus Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o had time to visit the fortresses of Corvite and Batugedere, into which had retired those who had been operating in the regions of Dinavaca, as we have said, whom he provided with everything in plenty.\n\nFrom there the General ordered Pinh\u00e3o to proceed to the neighbouring territories of Malvana, where the rebels and the principal leaders of that rising already were. And the General himself also set out by another route, so that they had them in the midst, and surrounded them in such a manner that as they had no way of escape they surrendered and submitted, and the General ordered that those who had been the heads of that rising should have theirs cut off;* and afterwards he proceeded little by little, executing the most guilty, whereby he entirely extinguished that conflagration which had been consuming the land.\u2020 The tyrant went on putting all his strength into the Corlas, in order to carry out what he intended against the General and divert him from his purpose; wherefore he was obliged a second time to send the camp against that enemy, and in many encounters that they had there with his people our troops were always victorious, and returned with many captives and prizes. Our camp, which was quartered in the stockade of Balitote, was also at this time not idle, for the King of Huva sent to attack it with more than six thousand men; but the Captain Salvador Pereira, who had already been advised thereof, before he could arrive, sent the native Lascarins out of the stockades to lie in ambush in the forests, in order, when they attacked, to fall on their rear, and rout them, of which they were afraid, and for this reason would not invest the stockade, but remained ten days near it, attacking it by skirmishes, from which they always retired more or less wounded.\n\nAnd that the tyrant of Candea might leave nothing unattacked in order to divert and embarrass the General, he ordered at the same time the stockade of Manioravar\u00e9 to be attacked by a captain of four thousand men, which they did with great determination; and for the space of half a day they had a great skirmish of harquebus fire with our troops, by which many were left stretched on the field; and our men entertained them so badly, that the same day they retired, leaving the field strewn with many mangled corpses.\n\nThe King of Huva, who was near our fort of Balitote, seeing that he was wasting time to no purpose, and that he was in risk of being attacked and defeated by our forces, retired, because he knew also that the General was sending succour to that stockade; and from there he proceeded to the regions of Chilao, leaving at a league's distance from\n\n* The original has this play upon words.\u2014D. W. F.\n\u2020 Much is here again left to the imagination by the historian.\u2014D. W. F.\nthat stockade a body of a thousand men, most of them with firelock, in a stockade which he made in a pass, so that, when the people of the neighbouring villages had assembled there, they might close against our troops the entrances into those parts, because they feared them from all sides. The General having been advised of this sent to attack them a Captain with fifty Portuguese and three hundred Lascarins, who put them to rout, entering their stockade, with the death of many. After this affair the King of Huva at once retired from the regions of Chilao, whither he had proceeded, both because there also he had been badly received by our people, and because he feared that the General might send another force against him.\n\nThe tyrant of Candea seeing how badly all his stratagems succeeded, and how many men he had lost in those engagements, attributed all to the cowardice of the King of Huva, wherefore he commanded him to return to Candea; and he gave his office, which was that of Captain-General of the field, to a Prince of the blood of the ancient kings,* a youth held to be intrepid, who, wishing to show the tyrant that he had not been mistaken in that selection, at once set out with all the camp and men that he of Huva had had against the fortress of Balitote, which the General had already succoured with men and munitions, which he attacked with several firelock skirmishes. And Salvador Pereira, its Captain, seeing that the enemy dared not invest it, sallied forth on him with a body of men, and attacked him with such fury, that in a short space of time he put him to rout with the death of more than a hundred, this Prince being as unfortunate, in the first attack that he made, as the King of Huva, since he hid himself in the forests as fearful as the other; and his men who escaped, such was their fear, that they only stopped on reaching Candea. By this the Corlas were cleared, the Prince alone remaining on their confines, two leagues from our camp, without daring to go before the tyrant. This being known to those of the stockade of Balitote, they sallied forth from it at night in good order, and in the daylight watch fell upon him with such an uproar, that they put him to flight, and forced him once more to take refuge in the forests, and continued pursuing him, and burning many villages, towns, and pagodes: by which means the inhabitants of the Corlas, being undeceived of the idea that the tyrant could defend them, submitted themselves to obedience.\n\nThe references to Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o in the above chapter are the last that Couto makes. In the first chapter of book V. of this Decade he once more (and for the last time, except for some brief references) treats of events in Ceylon (from September, 1599, to the wet season or \"winter\" of 1600); but,\n\n* I am unable to identify this prince.\u2014D. W. F.\nthough Salvador Pereira is mentioned as leading an expedition against the Kandyan forces, we hear nothing of his rival Pinh\u00e3o. Had Couto lived to complete his twelfth Decade, we should probably have had from his pen some more graphic descriptions of engagements in which our hero took a leading part; but alas! death put an end to the aged chronicler's labours. And Antonio Bocarro, who in 1631 succeeded to the post so ably filled by Couto, when he undertook the task of continuing the history of the Portuguese in Asia, owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding* commenced his so-called \"Decade 13\" with the succession to the viceroyalty of Dom Jeronymo de Azevedo in December, 1612, thus leaving a gap of over twelve years, the events of which have been chronicled very inadequately by Manoel de Faria y Sousa.\u2020 Bocarro's \"Decade\" embraces only the five years of Azevedo's viceroyalty (1613\u20131617), and he mentions Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o but once, and that somewhat casually. This solitary instance occurs in chapter CXI., where he tells us that in September, 1616, a few months after he had assumed the office of Captain-General of Ceylon, Dom Nuno Alvares Pereira, after a successful incursion into H\u00e1rispattu\u2014\n\nOrdered an attack to be made on that part of Sofrag\u00e3o and the Two Corlas which had risen against us, whither he sent as Captain-Major Filippe Oliveira of the Seven Corlas, with four companies, the captains of which were Pedro Homem Serr\u00e3o, Gon\u00e7alo Mendes de Carvalho, Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, Andr\u00e9 Penedo, and the same disava of Sofrag\u00e3o\u2021 with his men. They went and found not a single enemy, inasmuch as they were occupied over a great rising which they had ordered of the whole Island, and so they burnt the villages that were almost deserted, and proceeded destroying the land without having any one to face them, nor even a sign of such a thing.\u00a7\n\n* See his letter of August 19, 1631, to the king, printed on page xvii. of the Lisbon Academy's edition of his work, where he says that he was told that Couto had written as far as the time of Dom Jeronymo de Azevedo, and that the Marquis of Castel Rodrigo had the manuscripts of some of these books.\u2014D.

F.\n\n\u00a7 Bocarro then proceeds to describe the rising instigated by the pretender \"Nicapety,\" and the events arising therefrom, in great detail. See English\nAs Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o must by this time have been over sixty years of age, we need not be surprised at his no longer taking a prominent part in the \"conquest\" of Ceylon. But another fact may have influenced him, namely, that he had a wife to think of. This we learn from a royal letter of February 21, 1615, printed in Documentos Remettidos da India, tome III., p. 263, which runs as follows:\n\nDom Hieronymo de Azevedo, friend, viceroy: I the King send you all greeting. I have seen what you wrote in reply to my letters, in which I ordered you to exercise diligence to find out the heirs that there were at present, in that State, of Raj\u00fa; and having considered what you represent to me, it is my pleasure that in case Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, who was married to Dona Maria Pereira, heiress of the said Raj\u00fa, owes my revenue what you declare, and that judgment is given in its favour as regards the houses of which you make mention, which the said Dona Maria possesses, they be restored to her again, because I hereby make her a gift of them; and I command that in this matter execution go no further; and when the pretensions of the said Dona Maria have been seen, I shall order that in the rescript regarding them she shall be granted whatever favour there shall be occasion for.

Reg., IV., pp. 23, 55, 56.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n* I can find only one letter referring to this subject in Doc. Rem. (II., p. 239): this is dated March 22, 1612, and the last paragraph runs:\u2014\n\n\"Dom Filipe, grandson of Raj\u00fa, who came to this kingdom, is dead; and as it is necessary to know who is his direct heir, I charge you to advise me of this by the first ships, and in what degree he is related.\" In a letter of January 18, 1607, to the viceroy Dom Martin Affonso de Castro, the king says that \"Dom Filipe of Ceitavaca and D. Jo\u00e3o of Candia\" had written to him asking permission to come to Portugal: this he grants, if the Archbishop of Goa and the viceroy approve. In a letter of February 26, 1605, to the same viceroy, the king mentions \"the youth D. Jo\u00e3o, grandson of Raj\u00fa, who is being educated in the said College of the Kings [Magi], to whom the kingdom [of Ceylon] belongs,\" and recommends his being sent to Ceylon to weaken the influence of the rebel Dom Jo\u00e3o (Kunnappu Band\u00e1ra). I am doubtful as to the relationship of these youths to R\u00e1ja Sinha I.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u2020 Here, as everywhere else in Portuguese writers, \"Raj\u00fa.\"\u2014D. W. F.\nWho this Dona Maria Pereira, described as the \"heiress of Raj\u00fa,\" was, I am unable to say: I have met with no mention of her name elsewhere. It was natural that after R\u00e1ja Sinha's death in 1592, when Kunnappu Bandara was able to obtain undisputed possession of the throne, members of the family of the old \"lion-king\" should seek an asylum with the Portuguese; and their \"conversion\" to Romanism would follow as a matter of course.* The bestowal of the hand of the \"heiress of Raj\u00fa\" upon Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o would be considered a great favour to the latter and a reward for distinguished services. Whether there was any family of the marriage, I know not.\n\nThe reference to Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o which I have given above from Bocarro is the latest that I have come across that mentions him during his lifetime; but, famous though he was, I have found no record of his death. That it took place in Ceylon, we may, I think, consider certain. It probably occurred circa 1620, when he would be between sixty and seventy years of age.\u2020\n\nTwo letters which I have met with among the copies of Portuguese records in the British Museum Library throw some further light on the history of our hero. The first occurs in Addl. MS. 20,870, and is as follows:\n\nConde V'Rey amigo,\u2014Eu ElRey vos envio muito saudar como aquelle que amo. Vy o que me representou por parte dos religiosos do convento de Santo Antonio de Columbo sobre lhe mandar entregar o\n\n* In a previous footnote I have given references to two alleged grandsons of R\u00e1ja Sinha; and Bocarro, in chapter CLXXIV. of his work, states that in May or June, 1617, Luiz Gomes captured in \"the deserts of Anorojapur\u00e9 a youth of twenty years, grandson of Raj\u00fa and nephew of Madune, who had been in Uva with Barreto, whence he had gone to this rebel, believing him to be what he called himself.\" The \"rebel\" referred to was \"Nicapety,\" of whom Bocarro tells us in chapter CXI. that he pretended to be \"the native prince of Ceillao who went to Portugal and died in Coimbra; because he had the same name of Nicapety.\" This prince may be the Dom Filipe mentioned in the previous footnote: his title was, I suppose, Nikapi\u1e6di Bandara, from Nikapi\u1e6diya in the Kanduaha pattu of the Paranakuru Koral\u00e9 (cf.

Joana de Mendon\u00e7a being at this court, represented to me that to Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, her uncle, were granted for the services that he did in that state two villages in Ceilla\u00f5 called Cotapite\u2020 and Panaique\u2021 for three lives, of which she was the last, and as such it was adjudged by a sentence of habilitation that she could send and take possession of the said villages, which she was prevented from doing in the year 1620 on account of the village of Cotapite\u2019s being occupied in the service of the garrison of Sofrag\u00e3o.\u00a7\n\nI charge you that, having seen what this village is worth, and what justice there is for giving her satisfaction of the gift of it, you order this matter to be settled as best may be, advising me of all in order that I may know it.\u2014Written in Lisbon, the 17th [?] of March, 1653.\u2014The King.\u2014Conde de Odemira.\n\nIn the first of the above letters we have a glimpse of our hero in a new character,\u2014that of the \u201cpious donor.\u201d What village it was that he \u201cgave as alms\u201d to the convent of Saint Antony in Colombo does not appear; but it was probably not far from Colombo.\u00b6\n\n* Sie. for \u201cdezasete,\u201d apparently.\u2014D.

Ribeiro (book II., chapter X.) states that in 1641 the disawa of Sabaragamuwa and two companies of soldiers were sent to this place by the field Captain-Major to meet the Prince of \u00dava, when he was coming over to the Portuguese. Ribeiro spells the name in the same way as above; the initial letter was dropped through being confounded with the Portuguese definite article o.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u00a7 This must refer to the expedition against \u201cMadune\u201d undertaken by Constantino de S\u00e1 during his first governorship, and described by his son in his Rebelion de Ceylan, chapters V., VI. (See C. A. S. Journal, XI., pp. 500-505, 508-511).\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u00b6 In Doc. Rem., tome I., pp. 384-5, are some documents relative to a petition from Helena de Goes respecting a grant made in 1596 by D. Jeronymo de Azevedo to her husband, Constantino Castanho, of the palm gardens of Raj\u00fa with their lands, the former extending from \u201cGurabebely\u201d (Gurubevila) to \u201cCanampely\u201d (Kanampella), and the latter comprising \u201cCapety, Bolata, Carrite, and Urgao Corla\u201d (Kahat\u00e1pit\u00edya, Bollat\u00e1wa, Korato\u1e6da, and H\u00e9w\u00e1gam k\u00f3ral\u00e9, or Udugaha pattuwa). These lands and gardens, one would suppose, would be claimed by Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o as husband of the \u201cheiress of Raj\u00fa.\u201d\u2014D. W. F.\nWe can picture the old warrior, whose whole career had been one of bloodshed, seeking to salve his conscience by this alms to the church.\n\nThe second letter is of even greater interest; for it gives us the name of Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o\u2019s niece (showing that he was connected with one of the noblest families in Portugal), and furnishes us with the information that in reward for his services (in Ceylon chiefly) he had been granted \u201cfor three lives\u201d (the usual term) the adjacent villages of \u00d3pan\u00e1k\u00e9 and Kutt\u00e1pi\u1e6diya on the confines of Sabaragamuwa and the Kandyan kingdom, where some of the fiercest fighting between the Portuguese and Sinhalese had taken place. The letter also proves, I think, that in 1620 Pinh\u00e3o was already dead.\n\nThese comprise all the references to Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o that I have been able to find; and it will be seen that, like a meteor, he suddenly appears, blazes for a while, and then disappears in obscurity.\n\n(2) Who was the foe Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o overcame?\n\n(3) What was the event which the stone commemorates?\n\nI shall consider both questions together. If it were possible to answer offhand the last question, the solution of the other would be easy. But, unfortunately, owing to the breaks in the history of the Portuguese in Ceylon to which I have referred, and the illegibility of portions of the inscription under consideration, we have no certain data from which to draw our conclusions, and are relegated to the region of hypothesis.\n\nA serious difficulty that presents itself at the outset of our inquiry arises from the fact that we cannot be absolutely certain that the stone has not been brought from some other locality; though this I regard as improbable.* Granted, then, that the event commemorated in the inscription took place at or near the site of the Maha Saman D\u00e9val\u00e9 where the Portuguese fort of \u201cSofrag\u00e3o\u201d undoubtedly, I think,\n\n* There may possibly exist Sinhalese documentary evidence regarding this.\nstood,\u2014when did it occur? If the whole of the inscription refers to one event, the mention of the King of Jaffnapatam limits our field of inquiry considerably. But this is by no means certain. In none of the passages from Couto that I have translated above is there any reference to the King of Jaffnapatam; and in the passages in Faria y Sousa, Bocarro, S\u00e1 e Menezes, where he is mentioned, I have failed to discover any connection with Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o or Sabaragamuwa. On the other hand, in the passages in these writers, where events in Sabaragamuwa are described, our hero\u2019s name does not occur; nor have we any account of an incident corresponding to that which the inscription commemorates.\n\nThe Sinhalese tradition mentioned by Mr. Skeen in the extract I have quoted at the beginning of this Paper only introduces a fresh element of confusion; for, according to Baldaeus* and van Rheede in Valentyn,\u2020 Kuruviti Ralah\u00e1mi, which I take to be identical with Kuruviti Band\u00e1ra, was the title of the renegade Antonio Barreto,\u2021 the prince or \u201cking\u201d of Uva referred to by Couto in the extracts given above. Now, the miserable ending of this man at the hands of some Lascarins, while lying on a bed sick and wounded in the mountain hamlet to which he had fled after the defeat of the confederates by Constantino de S\u00e1 in Sabaragamuwa, is told us by S\u00e1 e Menezes in his work;\u00a7 and there we have no mention of Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o (who was almost certainly dead at that time), nor were the circumstances attending Barreto\u2019s death such as to call for self-glorification on the part of his slayer. And yet, curiously enough, in close juxtaposition to this account of Barreto\u2019s defeat and death we have a description of the final downfall of the kingdom of Jaffnapatam and the capture and execution of the tyrant Sa\u1e45gili.\n\n---\n\n* Ceylon, chapters XI.\u2013XIV. \u2020 Ceylon, p. 279.\n\u2021 Beside Couto and the two Dutch writers named, see, regarding this remarkable man, Bocarro, chapter CXIV.; Reb. de Ceylan (in C.

Dr. Vandort remarked that the Society was under great obligation to Mr. D. W. Ferguson for the many contributions he had sent to the Society, especially in connection with personages and events connected with an important, and yet at the same time obscure, period in the history of Ceylon, namely, the period when the Island was occupied by the Portuguese. He could not sufficiently admire the scholarly research and the patient industry, as well as the linguistic attainments, that had been able\u2014from sometimes very few notes connected with personages who figured in Ceylon history\u2014to throw such a flood of light on some of the periods where there was so little information to be got from the ordinary histories available. From that little stone which the builders rejected, and the inscription on which had been so effaced that they could make very little out of what had been engraved, Mr. Ferguson had been able to write a most elaborate historical essay, and had made this character (Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o), about whom very little was known before, to appear conspicuously before them as one of the bravest Portuguese soldiers of that time.\n\nDr. Vandort proceeded to deal with the inscription, suggesting that the part which the author of the Paper had left blank should read: \"To him the kings generally rendered fealty (or submitted themselves),\" being followed by the words \"and the King at Jafanapt\u00e3o (Jaffnapatam), I, Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, conquered him.\" It was with great diffidence he put forward this suggestion, especially when he remembered that Mr. Ferguson had so intimate a knowledge of the Portuguese language.\n\nThe Chairman said they were greatly indebted to Dr. Vandort for his observations, and the possibility of a different reading. The subject was one of interest.\n\nMr. J. Ferguson said that the interesting part to him of the Paper was the vivid picture it afforded of the desultory warfare carried on between the Portuguese and Kandyans (as afterwards between the Dutch and Kandyans), and the very great difficulties attending such warfare from the absence of communications\u2014so that every hill had to be turned into a fortress, and campaigns were a continual series of surprises. The Kandyans to cover an attack on S\u00edt\u00e1waka or K\u00f3tt\u00e9 would make a dash towards Chilaw or M\u00e1tara, while the Portuguese paid them back by descending upon Kurun\u00e9gala, taking and burning it before relief could arrive. The wisdom of the British authorities in beginning their occupation of Ceylon by making roads through the mountain\ncountry and across the Island was well shown in the nature and results of Portuguese warfare. The spade or the mamoty was far more potent than the sword in such cases.\n\nAs Dr. Vandort had rightly said, it was a great matter to have one of their Members with the inclination and ability to elucidate obscure but interesting passages in past local history. Dr. Vandort's own ingenious alternative interpretation of a portion would no doubt receive due attention.\n\nADDENDUM.\n\nSince the above was printed, I have received from Sr. David Lopes the documents given below, which were communicated to him by General Brito Rebello and one of the keepers of manuscripts at the Torre do Tombo in Lisbon, Sr. M.

I have seen a decree of the council of state, which you forwarded in the dispatch of the 15th ultimo, regarding Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, captain of Gal\u00e9; and because it is stated that he, by his industry, assistance, and labour, and with very little expenditure of my revenue, has erected there a fortress very well built, which will shortly be finished, and will remain in a defensible condition, I think well that the count viceroy of India be written to, that, this being so, he grant in my name to Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o the habit of one of the military orders, with the ordinary allowance of twelve thousand rais.\u2014Written in Madrid, the 7th of March, 1623.\u2014The King Duque de Villahermosa, Conde de Ficalho.\u2014(For the governors of Portugal.)\n\nFrom the second of the above documents we learn two important facts regarding Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, viz., (1) that up to 1609 he had had nineteen years\u2019 service in India, so that he must have gone out in 1590\u2014probably with the viceroy, Mathias de Albuquerque, whose ship did not reach Goa until May, 1591, having been just over a year on the voyage; and (2) that his death took place before 1619.\u2020 It is evident, therefore, that the figures given on the mural stone at Ratnapura cannot be 23; but I have no data to prove what the figures really are.\n\nWith respect to Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o\u2019s nephew and heir, the captain of Galle Fort, I may say that on 1st March, 1625, the king wrote to the viceroy recapitulating his letter of 15th\n\n* Collec\u00e7\u00e3o do Mosteire de S. Vicente, vol. 19, fol. 124.\n\u2020 It must have occurred in 1617 or 1618, and the statement towards the end of my paper, that it \u201cprobably occurred circa 1620,\u201d needs correction. D. W. F.\nMarch, 1623 (which I have not found, but which seems to have been almost a duplicate of that of 7th March, 1623, given above), and ordering him to ascertain if Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o was worthy of the honour proposed to be bestowed upon him. Again, on 21st March, 1625, the king wrote to the viceroy reminding him that on account of the importance of the fortress at Galle, on which Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o was engaged, he had ordered him to assist the captain in every way until it was completed; to which the viceroy is stated to have replied, that he was waiting until Constantine de S\u00e1 e Noronha, who had been sent to Ceylon as captain-general of the island, had arrived there. The king thereupon asks what has been done; and again urges the importance of the fort, to resist attacks of enemies. On 25th February, 1627, the king again wrote to the viceroy, to the effect that, as, in reply to his last letter, the latter had stated that the information he had received regarding Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o did not correspond with that given by the Archbishop of Goa and D. Nune Alvares Pereira, his majesty wished for definite information. Whether or not this was furnished, I do not know, as I have not found any later reference to the matter; but it is noteworthy that S\u00e1 e Menezes, in his *Rebelion de Ceylan,* gives the entire credit of the construction of the fortress at Galle to his father, Constantino de S\u00e1 e Noronha! On 13th February, 1629, the king wrote granting the captaincy of Galle Fort to Antonio Barbalho. The cause of the vacancy of this post was evidently the death of Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, mentioned in the following document,\u2020 which I unfortunately overlooked when writing my paper:\n\nEu El Rey fa\u00e7o saber a vos meu V.

As from this latter we learn that Joanna de Mendon\u00e7a was the last of the \"three lives\" for which the grant was made, and as Sim\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o was the first, I think the second must have been Fern\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o, and that \"Jo\u00e3o\" in the above document is a copyist's blunder: at any rate, I have found no other reference to a Jo\u00e3o Pinh\u00e3o.\n\n6. Mr. Joseph read the following Paper:\u2014\nALAGIYAVANNA MOHOTT\u00c1LA, THE AUTHOR OF \"KUSAJ\u00c1TAKA K\u00c1VYAYA.\"\n\nBy D. W. Ferguson.\n\nMr. A. Mendis Gunas\u00e9kara, Mudaliy\u00e1r, the learned author of the \"Comprehensive Grammar of the Sinhalese Language,\" in his scholarly edition of Kusaj\u00e1taka K\u00e1vyaya (1897), says, on pp. xi\u2013xii. of the Preface:\n\nLike most other authors who flourished in this country in early times, very little is known of the author of Kusaj\u00e1taka K\u00e1vyaya. \"Mohott\u00e1la\" or \"Mukaveti\" affixed to his name designates his office, that of registrar held by him under the Dutch Government, or, as usually applied, \"secretary or writer to the household of a native chieftain of high rank.\" His father, Dharmadvaja, who was himself a poet and a man of great learning, was a native of Hisvella, a village which may be identified with the modern Hiss\u00e9lla in Ga\u1e45gaboda pattu of the S\u00edn\u00e1 k\u00f3rale, which, according to the Census of 1891, contained 340 inhabitants. It is possible that Alagiyavanna was born here and received his education under his father. Having received his appointment from King R\u00e1jas\u00edgha II. (1634\u20131684 A.D.) at the instance of the Dutch Government, he travelled in various parts of the maritime districts of Ceylon which were then under that Government, and collected materials for the compilation of the valuable Government record known as the Dutch \"Tombu.\"* It is said that he was invested with much authority, and had the power to sentence to death a number of persons not exceeding six at a time, and that accordingly a \"low caste\" man named Alagiya, who, on being asked for his name, impertinently replied \"That is the same as your own,\" was ordered by him to be put to death by his two legs being tied to the trunks of two adjoining arecanut palms brought together by ropes, which were afterwards cut asunder, so that the man's limbs were torn in two by the receding force of the two trees.\n\n*A correspondent of the Ceylon Observer (June 14, 1897) says:\u2014\"The Dutch in the 17th century, when the maritime provinces passed into their hands from the Portuguese, requested the help of R\u00e1ja Singha II. in drawing up a register of the inhabitants and lands of their new possessions. The services of Alageyawanna Mohotala, the eminent Sinhalese poet, were placed at their disposal, and the result was the compilation of the famous Lan\u00e7i Thombo, or the Sinhalese Domesday Book.\"\u2014D. W. F.\nAlagiyavanna was also author of the following works:\u2014S\u0113vul Asna alias Kukku\u1e6da Sand\u0113saya (cock\u2019s message), Subh\u0101shita (moral maxims), Nitiscaraya (moral laws), Mahaha\u1e6dana (on the wars between the Portuguese and the Sinhalese), Parangihatana (on the wars between the Dutch and Sinhalese), Dahamsonda J\u0101taka (a poetical version of a Buddhist birth story), Munigunaratnam\u0101laya (or Buddha\u2019s virtues), Dussilavata (on misconduct of Buddhist monks).\n\nHe is said to have repeated a stanza offhand while on his deathbed, in which he threatened the angel of death that if he should at any time succeed to his post, he (the poet) would make the angel and his wife dance on the outer verandah of their house, meaning that he would bring them to the situation in which he then was. This stanza is cited on page viii (supra). The dates of his birth and death are not known. This poem under consideration, according to its concluding stanza, was composed in the year 1532 of the Saka era, which corresponds with 1610 A.D.\n\nThis poem, according to its 19th stanza, was written at the request of a pious and learned lady named Menik S\u0101mi, wife of Attanayaka, a minister of R\u0101jasi\u1e45ha I. (1581\u20131592 A.D.), who made S\u012bt\u0101waka his seat of Government.\n\nMr. Gu\u1e47as\u0113kara has not given his authorities for the few details he records of the poet\u2019s career, but they are, I believe, taken from Mr. John Perera\u2019s Heladiv-rajaniya (p. 231); and, with regard to two of his statements, I think I can show that he is in error. I refer to the assertions that Alagiyavanna held the office of registrar \u201cunder the Dutch Government,\u201d and that he \u201creceived his appointment from King R\u0101jasi\u1e45ha (1634\u20131684) at the instance of the Dutch Government.\u201d\n\nIn vol. III. of the Orientalist were printed, under the heading \u201cDonatie die gedaen heeft den Coningh van Ceylon Dom Joan Pereapander,\u201d* a number of Dutch documents\n\n---\n\n* To this heading the editor of the Orientalist appended the following footnote:\u2014\u201cA Dutch translation, discovered by Mr. F. H. de Vos, of the deed of gift of the Island of Ceylon to the Portuguese, of which a translation from the original Portuguese by Mr. Donald Ferguson appeared on page 28 supra.\u201d This is a very misleading note, as only the first document is a Dutch translation of the deed of gift, the others being translations of Portuguese documents connected therewith, or relative thereto, of such importance that an English translation should have been given. Mr. de Vos ought also to have stated where he discovered these documents.\u2014D. W. F.\nsent to that periodical by Mr. F. H. de Vos, of Galle, one of which (p. 196) commences as follows (I translate):\n\nIn the year after the salutary birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, one thousand six hundred, on the 26th day of the month of March, in this city and fortress St. Lawrence of Colombo, on the Island of Ceylon, in the dwelling of Anthonio Vaz Freire, nobleman of the King's house and administrator of the royal revenues of the said Island and of the territories thereto appertaining, he himself being personally present, and in like manner present I, Balthasar Marinho, secretary of the royal administration, there appeared before us Dom Jeronimo Banaqua Ralle, chief moetjaer, Don Jeronimo Aliqua, late [oud] moetjaer, Dom Jeronimo Samara de Vagua [sic for \"Samaradevaquara\"?], moetjaer, and Annaas Ralla, moetjaer, and Dom Francisco Velqu\u00e3o, interpreter of this tombo, all of whom were summoned, at the request of the said royal administrator, for the fulfilment of this tombo; and the oath having been given to all to swear on the Holy Gospels, and an oath having been taken from Annaas Raale after the custom of the heathen, to sincerely and openly declare the truth of all that shall be asked of them, on condition, and warning given to the same, that in case at any time hereafter it should come to appear that they had said and answered other than the real truth, they should without any doubt be punished according to the form and justice of his Majesty.\n\nIt will be noticed that the above document professes to have been written in the year 1600. This is an error (of the Dutch translator's perhaps) for 1616. Ant\u00e3o Vaz Freire did not arrive in Ceylon as vedor da fazenda before the end of 1609 or beginning of 1610,* and left the Island at the end of 1616;\u2020 while Balthazar Marinho did not come to Ceylon as secretary of the fazenda before 1615.\u2021 We may take it as certain, therefore, that 1616 was the year in which the document was written; and the date March 26 is significant, for on March 1, 1616, Dom Nuno Alvares Pereira arrived at Colombo from India and took over the generalship of Ceylon from Manuel Mascarenhas Homem.\u00a7\n\nOf the four Mohottiy\u00e1rs mentioned, three, it will be noticed, were \"Christians,\" and all three, curiously enough,\n\n* See Monthly Lit.

Of the three, the name of most interest to us is that of \u201cDon Jeronimo Aliquia,\u201d this last word being an evident clerical error for \u201cAliguia.\u201d It was only when recently re-reading this document that the conjunction of this name with the title \u201cmoetjaer\u201d led me to the conclusion that the secretary-poet Alagiyavanna was referred to; and, by a remarkable coincidence, immediately after coming to this conclusion I lighted upon a document in the manuscript department of the British Museum Library which confirms the conclusion. It is contained in tome 8 of the series of Portuguese royal dispatches to the viceroys, proclamations, &c., comprising forty volumes, and numbered \u201cAdditional, 20,861\u201320,900.\u201d It is a letter from Philip III. to the Viceroy of India (the Conde de Redondo), dated March 24, 1620, and runs as follows:\n\nConde VRey amigo,\u2014Eu El Rey vos envio muito saudar como aquelle que amo. Por parte de Dom Jeronimo de Aliguiamana* Motiar do tombo das terras e Aldeas da Ilha de Ceilla\u00f5 se me fez peti\u00e7a\u00f5 em que pede o titullo de Mutiar de minha fazenda e que o feitor de Columbo continue com elle re\u00e7a\u00f5 e m\u0103timento ordinario que o geral e vedor da fazenda lhe ordenara\u00f5 e que se lhe restetuisse os peda\u00e7os de Aldeas e terras que se lhe tirou Dom Nunes Alures Peir\u2020 sendo geral de Ceilla\u00f5 estando lhe confirmados pella memera\u2021 e junta de Aldeas que vendesse esta sua preten\u00e7a\u00f5 me pareceo remetervola e vos encomendo que a vejaes em despacho e me consulteis sobre ella o que vos parecer pella Lista dos despachos. Escrita em Lisboa aos vinte quatro de Mar\u00e7o de mil seis centos vinte.\n\nTranslation.\n\nFriend, count, and viceroy,\u2014I the King send you all greeting as him whom I love. On the part of Dom Jeronimo de Aliguiamana, motiar of the lands and villages of the Island of Ceilla\u00f5, a petition has been presented to me, in which he begs for the title of mutiar of my fazenda, and that the factor of Columbo continue to him the allowance and ordinary sustenance that the general and the vedor da fazenda\n\n* Sic for \u201cAliguiauana.\u201d\u2014D. W. F. \u2020 Sic for \u201ccamara.\u201d\u2014D. W. F.\ncommanded, and that there be restored to him the portions of villages and lands that Dom Nunes Alures Peir\u00e1 when general of Ceilla\u00f5 took from him, they having been confirmed to him by the camara and junta of villages.* Having seen this claim of his, I have thought fit to remit it to you, and request you to consider it on receipt and advise me thereupon as to what you think right by the list of rescripts. Written in Lisbon on the Twenty-fourth of March, One thousand Six hundred and Twenty.\n\nFrom the above letter we learn that Alagiyavanna had been deprived of certain lands by Dom Nuno Alvares Pereira, who may possibly also have superseded him in his office of Mohottiy\u00e1r, since he is referred to in the document of March 26, 1616, as \"late moetjaer.\" Though the date of his petition is not stated, we may very well suppose it to have been written towards the end of 1618, shortly after Constantino de S\u00e1 took over (in September of that year) the reins of office from Nuno Alvares.\u2020 Whether Alagiyavanna succeeded in the object of his petition I am unable to say, as I have found no further reference to him.\n\nIt is evident from these documents that it was by the Portuguese, and not by the Dutch, that the poet-secretary was employed; and, as the Hollanders were not in a position to undertake tombo-making in Ceylon until half a century later,\u2021 it is extremely improbable that Alagiyavanna was then alive. Nor, had he been, is it likely that the Dutch would have consulted R\u00e1ja Sinha on the subject.\n\nA curious question arises out of the date, 1610, when the Kusaj\u00e1taka K\u00e1vyaya was written. The poet there writes as a Buddhist; in 1616 he was a (professed) Christian: his \"conversion,\" therefore, must have taken place between those two dates.\n\n* The camara or chamber of Colombo consisted of the vercadores, or aldermen, and other leading citizens. Regarding the junta, see the statement of S\u00e1 e Menezes, C. A. S. Journal, vol. XI., p. 532.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u2020 See C. A. S. Journal, vol. XI., pp. 494 and 495 (where \"1619\" is an error for \"1618\"); compare p. 513.\u2014D. W. F.\n\n\u2021 The earliest reference to the subject that I know of is that by Ryklof van Goens, in his \"Consideratien over Ceylon,\" dated June 21, 1661, as given in Valentyn (Ceylon), p. 157.\u2014D. W. F.\nI learn from Mr. D. M. de Z. Wickremasinghe that among the Sinhalese manuscripts in the British Museum Library is one (Or 4964) described as \"An anonymous account of the B\u00e1\u1e0d\u00e1ra and Malala families and of the titles and lands bestowed on some of the members from time to time by kings of Ceylon,\" in which (on folio 5) there is a reference to the poet-secretary, but no light is thrown by it on his history.\n\n7. The Chairman observed that the Paper contained a record of interesting research into a matter which to Sinhalese students was of great interest. The author of that very learned poem was, as Mr. Ferguson pointed out, at the time he wrote the poem, a Buddhist, and a few years after, apparently professed Christianity. The subject was not of such general interest as that dealt with in the previous Paper, but it was of interest to scholarly Sinhalese.\n\n8. The Chairman said that, if there was no one desirous of making any remarks on the second Paper, he would like to submit to them, in a formal manner, the purport of the observations made by Dr. Vandort, at the conclusion of the first Paper, and ask the Secretary to convey to Mr. D. W. Ferguson their appreciation of his kindness in assisting the Society's Journal, and also their appreciation of the research and trouble that he had taken in the preparation of the two Papers read. He moved that they place on record a vote of thanks to Mr. D. W. Ferguson for his two Papers.\n\nDr. Vandort seconded the motion, which was carried.\n\n9. Mr. Ferguson proposed a vote of thanks to the Chair, and in doing so said it was well deserved, for on their face the Papers for the evening were scarcely attractive enough to draw a special attendance. The second of the Papers, however, mentioned a fact which made it quite appropriate to have Mr. Mackwood (the Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce) presiding; for it told us that well nigh 300 years ago there was a \"Chamber of Colombo\" consisting of vercadores or aldermen and other leading citizens. Perhaps the Chamber of the present day would hand over the honour of succeeding the vercadores of old to the aldermen of the Town Hall (laughter); but still the fact remained. He was sure they would all cordially assent to the vote of thanks.\n\nThis was seconded by Dr. Saravanamuttu and carried by acclamation, Mr. Mackwood acknowledging the vote briefly with thanks.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, September 11, 1899.\n\nPresent:\n\nDr. W.

W. Ferguson.\n\nIn the Monthly Literary Register, Vol. IV., pp. 210-214, is given the translation of a \"Memorandum on the Affairs of Ceil\u00e3o,\" written about 1609, in which the anonymous writer refers, inter alia, to the tyranny exercised towards the natives by Portuguese officials and the rigorous treatment of new converts by the ecclesiastics. This was during the generalship of the cruel Dom Jeronymo de Azevedo; but matters do not seem to have improved under his immediate successors; and it was not until Constantino de S\u00e1 e Noronha assumed the command of the Island that the Sinhalese began to be treated more as human beings than as brutes. But even under the milder rule of S\u00e1 e Noronha the natives still had to endure many vexations and oppressions at the hands of officials and ecclesiastics, as is proved by the following report by Ambrosio de Freitas, vedor da fazenda or Accountant-General of Ceylon, in reply to a letter from the King, Philip IV. of Spain.\u2020 The writer of this report, Ambrosio de Freitas da Camara, left Lisbon in March, 1619, for India, to take up the post of vedor da fazenda in Ceylon, to which he had been appointed; but on reaching Goa he remained there as acting provedor mor dos contos (chief supervisor of accounts), and did not take up his substantive office at Colombo until the end of 1623 or beginning of 1624. We learn from J. R. de S\u00e1 e Menezes's Rebelion de\n\n* Paper not read, but printed in this Journal in accordance with the Council's Resolution No. 13 of January 25, 1900.\n\n\u2020 The letter and the report were printed for the first time by the late Sr. J. N. da Cunha Rivara, in the Chronista de Tissuary, tom. IV., p. 8, from the Portuguese records in Goa. I have collated the letter with the copy in Addtl.

F.\nCeylan* that Ambrosio de Freitas did not get on with Constantino de S\u00e1 e Noronha, and (about the end of 1624 apparently) sent in his resignation, which was accepted by the Viceroy, the Captain-General undertaking the late official's duties in addition to his own. The King, however, did not approve of this arrangement, and ordered Ambrosio Freitas to resume his office; but this he does not seem to have done until 1630,\u2020 the same year in which his report, given below, was written; and the fatal year, also, in which Constantino de S\u00e1 and the flower of the Portuguese forces in Ceylon were betrayed, defeated, and massacred in Uva.\n\nAmbrosio de Freitas did not remain much longer in Ceylon; for in a royal letter to the Viceroy, dated February 4, 1634, he is referred to as having been appointed for three years to the important post of Secretary of India, and a letter from him, dated December 25, 1634, is acknowledged, in which he asks for payment of the sums owing to him when he was vedor da fazenda in Ceylon. With regard to his report, I may add that, writing on March 27, 1631, the King says that he has seen the Viceroy's reply to his letter of January 25, 1629; and orders him to write to the vicars and parish priests of the villages referred to, enjoining on them not to illtreat their parishioners. In another letter, dated March 20, 1632, the King again refers to the laxity in religion amongst native converts and excesses of officials in Ceylon, resulting in the hindrance of the faith and insurrections such as that in which Constantino de S\u00e1 was killed. On January 7, 1634, the King acknowledges a letter from the Viceroy, dated October 7, 1632, stating that the possessors of villages did not hinder the natives from becoming Christians, but that those converted became like slaves of the parish priests, who in the name of doctrine kept them continually employed in their private service, and the donees of villages lost them, being without labourers. For this state\n\n* See C. A. S. Jl., vol. XI., pp. 569, 591.\u2014D. F.\n\u2020 See C. A. S. Jl., vol. XI., p. 541.\u2014D. F.\nof things the Viceroy confessed his inability to find a remedy; but the King orders him to confer with the Archbishop of Goa on the subject, as it is of great importance to remedy excesses. In 1636 the King again writes on the subject; but by means of various excuses on the part of the Viceroy and the ecclesiastics nothing was done; and soon the Dutch were knocking at the gates, and there were other matters to think of and write about.\n\nConde de Linhares, Viso-Rey da India, amigo.\u2014Eu El Rey vos envio muito saudar, como aquelle que amo.

(Livro das Mon\u00e7\u00f5es, No. 14, fl. 351.)\n\nTranslation.\n\nConde de Linhares, Viceroy of India, friend.\u2014I the King send you all greeting, as him whom I love. I have been informed that some of the possessors of villages in Ceilam for their private interests hinder the natives of the country from becoming Christians, one of the reasons alleged being that they do not work on holy days, as when they were heathens; and as I am greatly astonished to learn that vassals of mine can commit such great excesses, my and their chief obligation being to procure and facilitate the conversion of the heathen of those parts, being desirous to provide a suitable remedy in the matter, I think right to enjoin on you that as soon as you arrive\nin India you obtain by the most trustworthy means available to you exact information regarding what has been referred to; and if you find that the possessors of villages hinder the conversion of the Chingal\u00e1s you shall order that those who have offended in this matter, or shall do so in future, shall at once be deprived of the rentals of the villages that they hold, and shall be punished as they deserve in the most fitting manner, proceeding in the execution of this order with the necessary care, and always giving me a circumstantial account of what is done in the matter.\u2014Written in Lisbon, the 25th of January, 1629.\u2014The King.\u2014To the Conde de Linhares, Viceroy of India.\u20143rd copy.\u2014The Duque de Villa Hermosa, Conde de Ficalho.\n\nAgrees with the original, of which His Excellency ordered me to remit this copy to the vedor da fazenda in order to obtain information and furnish a report with his opinion, which he would send in quadruplicate, and in fulfilment thereof I made it in Goa the 8th of November, 1629.\u2014Francisco de Sousa Falcao.\n\nThe subject of which this letter of His Majesty treats is of great importance, as it relates wholly to the service of our Lord God and the conservation of this conquest, and as such must be treated with the best remedy that can be found, taking evidence from those who are of a good conscience and dispassionate, and who have sufficient experience of the affairs of this Island; and with what I possess from the six years that I have resided in it, I shall say what I think without worldly consideration, in great fear of the chastisement that God may give me if I should treat it in any other sentiment; and so I say that there is no cause to believe that any baptized Christian opposes in his heart the propagation* of this heathenry, but the devil who generally plans and tries to hinder it by a thousand methods. Two suggest themselves to me, which in my opinion weaken and retard it completely: the first is that many of the tenants of villages are not pleased to have Fathers in their village, lest they come and bear witness of their frailties and sensual appetites, and be a hindrance to them, and at the same time put a stop to the tyrannies which many of them are accustomed to exercise towards the natives of the said villages, and the great yoke that they put upon them in the matter of service, taking from them areca, pepper, and butter, fowls, and other similar things for the price they choose. The second, and of not less importance, is through the Rectors desiring to give fulfilment to the Constitutions\u2020 without exception from rich to poor, whereby is created in them a great dislike to baptism, because, as the Chingal\u00e1s by nature set such value on a larin, so it does not do to discontent them by the Rectors compelling them to the extent of ordering them to have\n\n* Sic! Either an error for \"conversion,\" or some words omitted, such as, \"of the faith.\"\u2014D. F.\n\n\u2020 Ecclesiastical laws.\u2014D. F.\nthree masses said for an alms of three larins to the funeral officers, being Christians only in name, and as much for the grave, burial, and solemnities, which comes to mount up to three xerains, when for two larins it is certain that any one of them would cut off the head of his own father. According to this, which is certain and infallible, it is necessary to discuss whether the Constitution should be carried out in its entirety in this part with this people, because there are some so poor that neither have they got a bit of cloth to cover their nakedness, much less to enshroud them, and to say masses, and perform their burial, as the said Constitutions order, which, nevertheless, always remain at the disposition of the Rectors, nor do all have the same consideration, and they force from them the alms which they cannot give them: so that for this reason as well as on account of other grievances of taking away their sons for doctrine up to eighteen and twenty years without their helping their fathers in their husbandry, and in other labours, in addition to the annoyances referred to of the tenants, and the orders of the Governors for the war, not only do they cling to their heathendom and avoid coming to a knowledge of their salvation, but rather give to the devil our holy law. God of his mercy grant them the remedy, since so long as they are treated with such rigours neither will they be Christians more than in name, if they are so and subject themselves to it, nor will the spiritual conquest ever have an end; and to this I set my hand.

COLLETT, F.R.M.S.\n\nIn a preliminary Paper on the Land Molluscan Fauna of this district, which I had the honour of reading before this Society two years since,\u2020 I gave some notes of the appearance and habits of thirty-eight species. With three exceptions\u2014hereafter notified\u2014all of these forms were previously known from Ceylon, they having been already recorded from other localities in the Island.\n\nThe present Paper, which deals with the remainder of my collected material, contains an account of an additional forty-one species and varieties, making a total of sixty-nine for the whole of Ambagamuwa. Of this number no fewer than eighteen have turned out to be new to Science.\n\nAt first sight this result would appear to indicate an extraordinary amount of success in my researches; but, in reality, the discovery of so large a number of previously unrecognized forms is simply due to the fact that our hill districts have been hitherto but very imperfectly examined.\n\nThe labours of the early Conchologists\u2014Benson, Layard, Nevill, Major Skinner\u2014were confined principally to the country lying between Colombo and Kandy, and to the northern (dry) region of the Island. In their time (1850-1870) few of our hill-country roads had been constructed,\n\n* Paper not read, but printed in this Journal in accordance with the Council's Resolution No. 13 of January 25, 1900.\n\u2020 Journal R.A.S., C.B., vol. XV., 1897.\nand the greater part of the forest land above an altitude of 2,000 ft. was still unopened.*\n\nIt is much to be regretted that we have, at the present time, no typical collection of Ceylon land shells available for purposes of reference and comparison. With one exception, the few collections that have been made appear to have been subsequently scattered or destroyed; the exception being that of Benson, which is still preserved in the Cambridge University Museum. I had an opportunity, while attending the Congress of Zoology at Cambridge last year, of examining the Benson collection. It consisted principally of low-country shells, the greater number of which were collected more than forty years ago.\n\nMost of the new species here enumerated were very kindly examined and determined by my friend, Mr. E. R. Sykes, the present Editor of the Zoological Record.\u2020 I am also much indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Godwin-Austen, F.R.S., for valuable Papers and assistance.\n\nIn conclusion, I may be permitted to point out that the study of the land mollusca of an agricultural country like Ceylon is (apart from its purely scientific interest) of special value, because it may furnish useful evidence on a problem of great economic importance. I refer to the question as to the nature of the relation which undoubtedly exists between land shells and plants and the soil, concerning which at the present time practically nothing is known. There remains open, therefore, a wide field for observation and experiment.\n\nI take this opportunity of correcting the following errors in my former Paper:\n\n2.\u2014*Helix acuducta* should be *Euplecta pr\u00e6amineons*, Sykes (*n. sp.*).\n\n---\n\n* In 1892 M.

The shell is pinkish-brown all over, and the peristome, which is white, has a pale chestnut margin. Like the other forms of *Acavus*, it is always coated with a green lichenous growth when full grown.\n\nThe animal is exactly similar in appearance to that of *A. roseolabiata* described in my former Paper.\n\n**Hab.**\u2014High up on the trunks of trees in damp localities.

W. Ferguson.\n\nIn the introduction that I wrote to the late Lieut.-Colonel H. H. St. George's translation of the Rebelion de Ceylan; printed in the Journal, R.A.S. (Ceylon), Vol. XI., 1890, I said of the author, Jo\u00e3o Rodriguez de S\u00e1 e Menezes, that his life history was unknown to me. Considering that he lived to the age of over seventy years, it is strange that the Portuguese biographical and bibliographical writers have so little to tell us regarding him. It is also curious, as I pointed out, that he should have waited for nearly fifty years after his father's death before writing the work in which, while describing the Island of Ceylon and recounting the stirring events that had taken place there, more particularly under his father's command, he strove to clear the latter's memory from the aspersions which his enemies sought to cast upon it. Another remarkable fact I also adverted to, namely, that his work, though published in Lisbon more than forty years after Portugal had once more shaken off the hated Castilian yoke, was written in Spanish.\u2020\n\nI have discovered no solutions for these mysteries: but in going through the volumes of Portuguese Royal Despatches, &c., in the British Museum Library (Addtl. MSS. 20,861-20,900) I have come across the following documents, which\n\n* Paper not read, but printed in this Journal in accordance with the Council's Resolution No. 13 of January 25, 1900.\n\n\u2020 F. F. da Silva, in his Diec. Bibl. Port., says: \"In spite of the bad taste that he showed in giving it in the Castilian language in preference to Portuguese,\" &c.

Joa\u00f5 Roiz de Sa\u00e1 de Menezes, son of Constantino de Sa\u00e1 de Noronha, who served many years in that State, and lastly as Captain-General of the Island of Ceila\u00f5, where the Chingalas killed him, represented to me here, that to his said father were still owing thirteen thousand five hundred xeralfins, the proceeds of an elephant which the Conde de Linhares\u2020 took from him in my name, when Viceroy of that State, as prepared from the confirmation which he left with his attorneys, with a letter of mine, in which it was ordered to pay him the said debt, and in addition two thousand eight hundred xeralfins of his salary, and four hundred of his allowance: begging me, that as his said father was left at his death with many embarrassments, and his creditors are suing him maliciously in the court of exchequer for some debts originated in my service without being willing to make abatement of them, his attorneys showing sufficient documents, I would do him the favour to order, that in recompense of the said debts a final statement be made regarding what may be found by law that his late father was still owing, and that out of what shall remain liquid payment be made him in the factory of Dama\u00f5 for a period of three years. And because it is not possible here to grant an order to this request, I strongly enjoin you, that, after the attorneys of Joa\u00f5 Roiz de Sa\u00e1 have furnished you with current papers of the debts of which mention has been made, and you have ascertained the facts with clearness, you order that payment be made to him of what shall be known to be owing to him.\u2014Written in Lisbon the 26th of March, 1665.\u2014King.\n\n* 1662\u201366. It was he who had, much against his will, to hand over Bombay to the English.\u2014D. F.\n\n\u2020 D. Migoel de Noronha, Viceroy, 1630\u201335.\u2014D. F.\nFrom the first of the above letters we find that in March, 1643, Joa\u00f5 Rodriguez de S\u00e1 e Menezes (who was then about thirty-five years of age) left for India in command of the usual annual fleet. That he had not been to the East before seems evident, the duty of taking care of his widowed mother and of his younger brothers having prevented his following in his father's footsteps. How long he remained in India I am unable to say; but I think it probable that he returned to Portugal in command of the ships of 1644.\n\nThe second letter furnishes fuller details of the sums due to Constantino de S\u00e1 e Noronha; and we learn that it was the Conde de Linhares who took from him, in the King's name, the elephant referred to in the first letter. As this nobleman became Viceroy only in March, 1630, and Constantino de S\u00e1 was killed in August of the same year, the transaction must have taken place between these months. S\u00e1 e Menezes says nothing of it; but he tells us (op. cit. p. 590) that the Count wrote twice to Constantino de S\u00e1 in harsh terms, upbraiding him for his inaction with regard to the Sinhalese enemy: and these letters seem indirectly to have hurried the unfortunate general to his fate. Ribeiro (Fat. Hist., p. 79) also mentions this fact: and Baldeus (Ceylon, chap. XVII.) professes to give the insulting terms in which the Viceroy wrote to the General.\n\nThe letter of 15th March, 1675, with its verbal repetition of the instructions issued ten years previously, and re-issued in 1670 and 1673, is the last reference to Joa\u00f5 Rodriguez that I have found in these despatches: whether the matter referred to was ever settled, and how, I am unable to say. But shortly afterwards (if he had not already done so, which is possible) S\u00e1 e Menezes took his pen in hand to write his book, which appears to have been submitted to the censors, for license to print, in 1678, though it did not appear until 1681, the year before he died.\n\nSince writing the above I have found the following record in Addtl. MS. 20,902 in the British Museum Library, which is entitled \"Rela\u00e7\u00e3o das N\u00e3os e Armadas da India, Com os\nsuccessos delas, que se puderam saber, para Noticia e instruc\u00e7\u00e3o dos curiozos, e amantes da Historia da India\u201d:\n\nANNO 1643.\n\nJo\u00e3o Roiz de S\u00e1 Capam Mor. 2 gale\u00f5es a 20 de Mar\u00e7o.\nPartiu a 20 de Mar\u00e7o com dous gale\u00f5es\nde q er\u00e3o Capit\u00e3es =\nO Capam M\u00f4r \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 no gale\u00e3o Sto Milagre\nPedro de Aranjo do Azevedo\u2014no gale\u00e3o Sta Margarida\n\nSuccesso: Vieram da India a 26 de Agosto de 1646 com\u00b0\nVizorrey o Conde de Aveiras.\n\nTranslation.\n\nANNO 1643.\n\nJo\u00e3o Roiz de S\u00e1 Captain-Major. 2 galleons the 20 of March.\nLeft the 20 of March with two galleons the\nCaptains of which were:\nThe Captain-Major\u2014\u2014\u2014-in the galleon Sto.

Grinlinton (non-resident), qualified as Life Members.\n\nThe Society now has on its roll 191 Members, including 20 Life Members and 10 Honorary Members.\n\nThe Council record with regret the death of Mr. G. C. Trask and the Hon. Mr. L. F. Lee, C.C.S.\n\nMr. Lee was for many years a Member of the Society. He contributed to the Society's Journal (Vol. V., No. 16, 1870) the following Papers:\n\n(1) \"A Prose Translation of the Introductory Stanzas of the Kusaj\u00e1taka.\"\n\n(2) \"Notes on a Sannasa.\"\n\n(3) \"The Romanized Text of the First Five Chapters of the B\u00e1lavat\u00e1ra.\"\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year numbered 329 volumes. The acquisitions are chiefly exchanges from Societies. The Library is indebted for donations to the Trustees of the Indian Museum; the Government of Bengal; the Government of India; the Government of Mysore; the Government of Madras; Cape of Good Hope Geological Commission; Australian Association for the Advancement of Science; Australian Anthropological Society; the Director of Public Instruction of Ceylon; H. Sastri; J. Harward, M.A.; T. B. Pohath; P. Arun\u00e1chalam, C.C.S.; O. Collett; W. H. Furness, M.D.; and the Colombo Museum Library.\n\nBesides those Institutions already on the exchange list, the Council have decided to exchange with the Director, Mission Arch\u00e9ologique d'Indo-China, Saigon.\n\nThe Council still constantly receive applications from Institutions for exchanges of the Journal of the Society. The Council regret having had to refuse some exchanges during the year, owing to the large number of Societies already on the exchange list.\n\n* Title since altered to \"A Chapter in Ceylon History in 1630.\"\nThe Council regret that the amount inserted in the draft Estimates for 1900 for the Museum extension was not passed. Confident hope was entertained that the Museum extension would have been started in 1900, and that the congested state of the Library of the Society would shortly have been relieved.\n\nThe need of relief for the overcrowded collections of books has been a crying want for a lengthy period. The Council have repeatedly in their Annual Reports and letters called the attention of Government to the growing difficulty of finding room for current accessions and for the books already in the Library. The Library of the Society and that of the Museum have outgrown the space available in the existing rooms; and it is necessary that there should be more accommodation for both. The Libraries need rooms large enough to allow for expansion, and at the same time to permit of a rational classification of the books on the shelves. Temporary measures have been adopted for some years to enable the Society to house the books in the room allowed to the Society. But the only real remedy for the present overflowing state of the Library is an extension of the building.\n\n**Journals.**\n\nVol. XV., No. 49, 1898, was issued during the year. It contains, in addition to the Proceedings of the Council and General Meetings, the following Papers:\n\n(i.) \"Contributions to Ceylon Malacology: (2) Description of a new Helicoid Land Shell from the Southern Province,\" by Mr. O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n\n(ii.) \"Aids to the Identification of Ceylon Birds: Part I.\u2014Introduction and Key to the Passeres,\" by Mr. A. Haly.\n\n(iii.) \"A Pertinent Account and Detailed Description of the Character, Nature, Coitus, and Production of Elephants in the Great Island of Ceylon,\" translated from the Dutch by Mr. F. H. de Vos.\n\n(iv.) \"Don Jeronimo de Azevedo, Governor of Ceylon from 1594 to 1611 A.D.,\" by Mr. A. E. Buultjens, B.A. Cantab.\n\n(v.) \"Monumental Remains of the Dutch East India Company of Ceylon,\" by Mr. F. H. de Vos.\n\nThe printing of the Journal for 1899, No. 50, is in hand.\n\n**Arch\u00e6ology.**\n\nA concluding Interim Report on the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner's operations at Sigiriya will in due course be read before a General Meeting of the Society.\n\nThe following is a synopsis of the work done by the Arch\u00e6ological Survey during 1899:\n\n*Re-organization of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey.*\n\nAs the result of the recommendations of the Commission appointed by His Excellency the Governor to report on the more efficient prosecution of the survey, the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner's hands were strengthened from January, 1899, by the:\n\n(a) Increase of the vote for Arch\u00e6ological purposes to Rs. 40,000.\n(b) Appointment of a Labour Assistant to the Archaeological Commissioner.\n\n(c) Attaching to the Department as Epigraphists Messrs. D. M. de Z. Wickramasingha and B. Gunasekara, Mudaliy\u00e1r and Chief Sinhalese Translator to Government.\n\nWith this aid, proportionate progress has been made. For the first time excavations have been carried on simultaneously at two centres (Anur\u00e1dhapura and Sigiriya); whilst preliminary work has been started in connection with the systematic and scientific publication of the ancient inscriptions of the Island (*Epigraphia Zeylanica*).\n\n**Excavations, &c.**\n\n*Anur\u00e1dhapura.*\u2014At Anur\u00e1dhapura half the labour force was continuously employed under Mr. C. E. Dashwood, Labour Assistant. Most of the year was occupied in pushing excavations southwards from *Th\u016bpar\u0101ma D\u0101gaba* towards *Ruvanveli D\u0101gaba*. In this long stretch of picturesque park little of the ancient ruins remains untampered with. Ill-considered later day reconstruction from older buildings has transformed the site generally into an irregular congeries of insignificant and uninteresting monks' dwellings, with attendant outhouses innumerable. Amidst the mediocre medley of ruins one or two stand out markedly\u2014*e.g.*, the beautiful pair of shrines, miscalled \"pavilions,\" square columned, with spreading dwarf-band capitals.\n\nIn the dry weather work was temporarily resumed at *El\u0101la Sohona*. Here the summit of the flat-topped mound (traditionally fixed as the tomb of the Tamil King El\u0101la) has been thoroughly dug, revealing walls and cross walls.\n\nTowards the close of the year the whole force of coolies was concentrated at *Bandara Puliyankulam*, 2\u00bd miles from the town, with the object of completing the excavation of the extensive Buddhist monastery situated to the east of the Jaffna road. Between thirty and forty *pirivenas*, lying regularly round and outside the main temenos containing the *d\u0101gaba* and three vih\u0101ras, have been laid bare; and at the magnificent *pilima-g\u0113* the re-setting of the fallen slabs of the stylobate revetment was nearly completed.\n\n*Sigiriya.*\u2014A final season was spent at Sigiriya in rounding off the fieldwork of the Archaeological Survey at Sigiri Nuvvura. The excavation of the summit and terraces at the base of the Rock was finished in 1898. The past year was devoted to the digging out of the numerous caves, beneath boulders dotted below the rock to the west, besides sporadic excavations at other promising sites (*e.g.*, three or four moated islands) within the *vil bemma*, or outermost ramp of the ancient city. In restoration steady progress has been made in the heavy task of re-building, on the old lines, (a) the southern approach to the gallery, (b) the staircase which terminated the gallery's tortuous climb to the Rock summits, and (c) the greatly wrecked portion of the gallery itself at its north end. The laying of a concrete bed in rock cut grooves for the foundations of the new brick-built wall to replace the ancient wall, involved constant risk to life, and great labour; but was safely accomplished by the end of the season. The preservation, as far as practicable, of the frescoes in the \"pockets\" was also commenced.\nPolonnaruwa.\u2014The \"camp\" and \"cooly lines\" for the occupation of the Archaeological Survey force are under construction at Topavewa. In 1900, after the necessary annual clearing, &c., of the ruins at Sigiriya, the Archaeological Commissioner will move on to Polonnaruwa, and break ground at that ancient capital.\n\nAward of a Gold Medal as an Encouragement to Oriental Learning.\n\nIn 1897 the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society established a Gold Medal to be awarded every third year as an encouragement to Oriental learning amongst English-speaking people. To meet the expenses incurred in preparing a design, engraving dies, and finding an amount to produce an income sufficient to defray the requisite charges, a sum of about \u00a3400 will be necessary. Subscriptions, with interest, of \u00a3300 have already been received, and a balance of about \u00a3100 is therefore still needed.\n\nDonations should be sent to the Chairman of the Medal Committee, Royal Asiatic Society, 22, Albermarle street, London.\n\nInternational Catalogue of Scientific Literature.\n\nThe Royal Society have undertaken to prepare and conduct a catalogue of all scientific literature published throughout the world. In pursuance of the scheme the Asiatic Society of Bengal has, at the request of the Royal Society, undertaken the formation and conduct of a Regional Bureau for India and Ceylon.\n\nThis Society has been invited to co-operate in the work, and the Council take this opportunity of directing the attention of the authors of Scientific Papers to the Circular on this subject, which is published as an appendix to this report. The slips there applied for may be forwarded to the Honorary Secretary of this Society.\n\nCouncil.\n\nMr. F. M. Mackwood was elected a Vice-President in place of Mr. Staniforth Green. The Council regret Mr. Green's departure from the Island. He was connected for many years with the Society, being a Member from 1866, and afterwards a Member of Council and Vice-President. Mr. Green always took an active interest in the Society's affairs, and his scientific attainments and general knowledge made him a most valuable Member of the Council.\n\nTwo Members of the Council of 1898, viz., Messrs. O. Collett, F.R.M.S., and P.

Booth.\n\nF. C. Roles,\nHonorary Treasurer.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nThe Royal Society's Scheme for an International Catalogue of Scientific Literature.\n\nBy the Honorary Secretary of the Committee of Control, Regional Bureau for India and Ceylon.\n\nI.\u2014Origin and Outline of the Scheme.\n\nAt an International Conference organized by the Royal Society, and held in London during July, 1896, it was considered \"desirable to compile and publish, by means of some international organization, a complete catalogue of scientific literature, arranged according both to subject-matter and to authors' names,\" in order that scientific investigators, by means of the catalogue, may be able readily to find out what has been published concerning any particular subject of inquiry.\n\nIn the following November a Committee was appointed by the Royal Society of London to study all the questions involved, and to frame a scheme for the work. The report of this Committee was issued on March 30, 1898, and during the following October a second International Conference was held in London to discuss the proposals of the Committee. This Conference, which included delegates from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Cape Colony, India, Natal, New Zealand, and Queensland, confirmed the general principle of the previous Committee, that a catalogue be published in the form of separate cards for each paper, as well as periodically classified in book form. It was decided to provide schedules for the internal classification of each of the following seventeen sciences:\n\nMathematics.  \nAstronomy.  \nMeteorology.  \nPhysics.  \nCrystallography.  \nChemistry.  \nMineralogy.  \nGeology (including Petrology).  \nGeography\u2014Mathematical and Physical.\n\nPalaeontology.  \nAnatomy.  \nZoology.  \nBotany.  \nPhysiology (including Pharmacology and Experimental Pathology).  \nBacteriology.  \nPsychology.  \nAnthropology.\n\nEach of these subjects will be distinguished by a separate registration letter, and the subdivisions indicated in the schedules by registration numbers designed purely for the guidance of the Central Bureau in arranging the cards in order for the compilation of a book-subject catalogue.\n\nCard Catalogue.\u2014The basis of the catalogue is the card or slip. For every communication containing scientific statements worthy of being indexed, whether appearing in a periodical or any other form of independent publication, at least one separate slip is to be prepared. These will be issued regularly to subscribers, and will enable them not only to keep themselves informed as to the progress of a science, but also easily to keep an \"account current\" of such progress.\nBook Catalogue.\u2014At determined regular intervals, not necessarily the same for all sciences, the Central Bureau in London will compile from the slips and issue in a book form an index to authors as well as an index to the subjects treated in the literature published within the determined period. The book catalogue will be obtainable in parts corresponding to the several sciences for which slips are provided, and in some cases, in Zoology for example, it may be found desirable to issue separate volumes for special sections of the subject. It is proposed also to supplement this frequent periodical publication of book catalogues by issuing collective indices covering periods of at least five or ten years. The titles of the publications and the subject entries will appear either in English, French, German, Italian, or Latin, and the titles of publications appearing in other languages will be translated into one of these five for the purpose of indexing, but the original title will be preserved and issued with the translation.\n\nThe final schedule of classification for each subject is now being worked out by an International Committee, which was appointed by the 1898 Conference for the purpose, but the schedules proposed by the Royal Society's Committee, whose work closed on March 30 of last year, may be taken as an example of the way in which the subjects will be subdivided and catalogued.\n\nAs an example, the schedule proposed for subject F, Chemistry, is given at the end of this note, and shows the elaborate system of classification which will enable the worker in any special branch to readily obtain the current literature bearing on his researches.\n\nWhere the different subjects overlap one another arrangements will be made as much as possible for similarity of numbering. Thus, in the case of Palaeontology, a publication will be numbered according to the system used in Geology for the stratigraphical horizon of the fossils referred to, according to the Zoological and Botanical systems to indicate their position in the animal or vegetable kingdom, and according to the scheme for Geography to show the country in which the specimens were found. A Paper, for instance, on Cretaceous Fishes from Asiatic Turkey would bear the symbol, K75, 14ei; K standing for Palaeontology; 75, the number for Cretaceous in the Geological schedule; 14, that for fishes in the Zoological; e, for Asia; and ei, for Asiatic Turkey and Arabia.\n\nThe systems of classification indicated above for Chemistry and for Palaeontology are sufficient to show the immense value the catalogues will be to special workers, who, under present circumstances, have no certain means of readily discovering the whole of the current literature bearing on their particular lines of research.\n\nII.\u2014The Formation of Regional Bureaux.\n\nThe Royal Society's Committee, by inquiry of experts in the various subjects, estimated that the number of communications to be analyzed and indexed would not fall far short of 40,000 in each year. To deal with such a body of literature, according to the detailed scheme indicated above, would naturally be beyond the powers of any one unaided Society, and the formation of Regional Bureaux was consequently undertaken.\n\nThe term \"Regional Bureau\" is introduced to indicate an organization, wherever established, for the purpose of collecting and indexing the scientific literature of a particular region. The region may be\neither a country or part of a country or several countries or parts of countries, which can for this particular purpose be conveniently grouped together.\n\nIt is proposed that such Regional Bureaux shall be entrusted with the task of preparing the slips required to completely index the scientific literature of the regions committed to their charge. The slips so prepared in the different regions will be regularly forwarded to the Central Bureau in London, to be checked according to the sanctioned schedules, and then printed, first in slip form and finally in book form, for issue to the subscribers.\n\nPrimary Slips.\u2014The slips forwarded to the Central Bureau from each region will be known as primary slips, and when these bear more than one registration letter, or more than one subject-entry (indicating that more than one subject is treated in the publication it refers to), copies will be printed, with or without alteration in the arrangement of the subject-entries, to permit the production of a full card catalogue for each subject. Such copies of the primary slip will be known as secondary slips, and will be prepared entirely in the Central Bureau.\n\nThe Regional Bureaux will be responsible merely for the preparation of the primary slips, each of which is to contain:\n\n(i.) A Title-entry\u2014giving the author's name and the full title of the communication, in the original language alone if the language be either English, French, German, Italian, or Latin. In the case of other languages, the title will be, as far as the Regional Bureau for India and Ceylon is concerned, translated into English; but the original title will also be added, either in the original script, or transliterated into Roman script. The title will be followed by every necessary reference, including the year of publication, and such other symbols as may be determined. In the case of a separately published book, the place and year of publication, and the number of pages, &c., will be given.\n\n(ii.) Subject-entries\u2014indicating as briefly as possible the principal subjects to which the communication refers. Such subject-entries will be given only in the original language of the communication, if this be one of the five previously referred to, but in other cases in India and Ceylon, English will be used.\n\nThe following specimens of primary slips prepared by the Royal Society's Committee will serve as a guide to authors, who, it is hoped, will assist the local committee in their preparation:\n\nSpecimen Primary Slips.\n\nMineralogy:\n\nFoote, H.

The Governments of India and Ceylon have been addressed on the subject, and, in addition to an annual grant sanctioned by the former Government to cover office expenses, they have directed all heads of Government Departments issuing publications on subjects included in the Royal Society's list to supply the Asiatic Society with primary slips of the kind described above; they have also instructed Local Governments and Administrations to supply periodical lists of books and journals published within their jurisdiction, with, as far as possible, copies of the publications.\n\nA Committee has been appointed by the Asiatic Society to control the work of this Regional Bureau, and each subject defined by the Royal Society is represented on the Committee by a Specialist, who will be responsible for checking or supplementing the primary slips relating to publications in his particular subject.\n\nTo Authors.\u2014But as there are some fifty periodicals to be examined, besides independently published works, the Committee feels that its self-imposed task will not be adequately carried out without the loyal assistance of authors themselves, who, naturally, can most rapidly and most accurately indicate the scope of their essays.\n\nThe working of this scheme will, moreover, be attended with certain advantages to the authors themselves; for the catalogues will be regularly printed and issued by the Royal Society to the subscribers, who will include, besides many of the chief workers in each science, the principal scientific institutions and libraries in the world. In this way all scientific papers and books published in India will be brought to the notice of the scientific world, and the present partial and unavoidable neglect of Indian publications will consequently no longer be possible. In fact, as far as the scientific world is concerned, work published in India will now receive, as it should do, exactly the same notice as it would if published by a leading society in Europe.\n\nThe assistance which the Committee ask of authors of papers coming within the scope of the catalogue is the preparation of a \"primary slip\" for each paper, prepared as already indicated and in a form similar to the two samples given above.\n\nIt is important to observe that what is required is not an index to the paper or book, but an index to the subjects treated, and the entries for these should be as brief and as few as is consistent with the scope of the paper. The author is not asked to enter the registration letters and numbers; that will be done by the Bureau, but he is requested to\nmake the subject-entries, and these should only be prepared for subjects which are so treated as to contain an addition or alteration to existing knowledge; subjects referred to merely as illustrations of the matters dealt with in the paper should not be indexed.\n\nIn the case of papers dealing with Palaeontology, Zoology, or Botany, the primary slip should contain a classified list of all new species described. If no new species are described the subject-entries should indicate the natural orders, families, or genera dealt with and the subject dealt with in relation to them.\n\nBooks or papers whose scope is completely or sufficiently indicated by the title will require no further subject-entries. Text-books and educational works whose scope is sufficiently indicated by their title require no subject-entries, except where they may contain additions to the existing knowledge of science, when subject-entries should be prepared for these parts only.\n\nThe Committee of the Regional Bureau have drawn up a list of periodicals, which are known by them to publish scientific papers, and which are received in the Library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal; but they have to trust to the quarterly reports from Local Governments for intimation of the publication of independent books and pamphlets. As these quarterly reports may appear some considerable time after the publication of a book, it is desirable for authors, to ensure immediate record being made of their work, to send a copy to the Asiatic Society, accompanied by a primary slip containing title and subject-entries. Societies and editors are similarly recommended to adopt the very useful practice now being followed by many scientific societies in Europe of issuing primary slips with each \"part\" of a journal. Such slips can best be prepared by the authors themselves, and sent to the editor of the journal in which his paper appears for transmission with the journal to the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nIV.\u2014Central Organization.\n\nFor the continuation and proper development of the work the Royal Society recommended, and the Conference held last October approved of, the organization of International Conventions to be held in London in 1905, 1910, and every tenth year afterwards. Such International Conventions will consist of delegates appointed to represent the various Regional Bureaux, for the purpose of revising as may be necessary the regulations for carrying out the work of the catalogue authorized by the International Conference of 1898.\n\nIt is also proposed to form an International Council composed of one member from each of the Regional Bureaux to act as a governing body of the catalogue. The reports of this Council, giving an account of the expenses of the scheme, will be distributed to the several Regional Bureaux, and will be published in recognized local periodicals.\n\nThe International Council will appoint for each science an International Committee of Referees to decide on questions of classification not provided for by the catalogue regulations, or in cases of doubt to pronounce an opinion as to the meaning of the regulations.\n\nThe actual routine work connected with the classification of primary slips received from the different regions and the printing and issue of the catalogues will be carried on in London by the Central Bureau, which will consist of a Director and staff of expert assistants.\nIt is impossible yet to fix the rates of subscription to the catalogues, but the scheme drawn up by the Royal Society's Committee provides for subscription to the slip catalogue and the book catalogue separately, both of which will be issued in parts devoted to the whole of a registered science when its literature is limited in amount, or to a special section of a science when its literature is extensive and capable of convenient subdivision. The Regional Bureaux will, later on, be provided with the scale of subscription, when steps will be taken to inform individuals or institutions likely to subscribe.\n\nThe preparation of the catalogue will date from January 1, 1900.\n\n**ABRIDGED SCHEDULE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR CHEMISTRY.**\n\n*Chemical Bibliography.*\n\n- **0000 Philosophy.**\n- **0010 History.**\n- **0020 Biography.**\n- **0030 Dictionaries, collected works, text-books.**\n- **0040 Pedagogy.**\n- **0050 Addresses, lectures, essays, and theses.**\n- **0100 Chemistry (Specific) of the Elements, to include all entries relating to the elements generally, or which cannot be referred to any one of the known elements.**\n- **0110 Aluminium.**\n- **0120 Antimony.**\n- **0130 Argon, followed by the other known elements at similar numerical intervals and arranged in alphabetical order up to\u2014**\n- **0840 Zirconium.**\n\nEntries made under any element may be further subdivided according to the nature of the compounds in which they occur, and are arranged into five further sections in such order that the entries relating, \\(a\\), to the history or origin of the substance shall come first, followed by, \\(b\\), its preparation or manufacture; \\(c\\), its structure, or theoretical nature; \\(d\\), its interactions or use; and \\(e\\), its compounds.\n\n- **0900 Laboratory Procedure.**\n- **1000 Organic (Carbon) Chemistry (Specific).**\n- **1010 Hydrocarbons generally, with the following recognized groups\u2014**\n  - **1020 Paraffins.**\n  - **1030 Unsaturated open chain hydrocarbons.**\n  - **1040 Benzenoid hydrocarbons.**\n  - **1050 Reduced benzenoid hydrocarbons (terpenes, &c.).**\n  - **1060 Unclassified hydrocarbons.**\n\nWhen necessary these groups of hydrocarbons are further subdivided into isologous groups, in each of which the compounds are entered in homologous order.\n\n- **1100 Alcohols and Ethers with subdivisions as in the case of hydrocarbons ranging from 1110 to 1150.**\n\n---\n\n*From the Report of the Royal Society Committee, March 30, 1898.

Collett then read the following Paper:\u2014\nPEARL OYSTERS AND PEARL FISHERIES.\n\nBy O. Collett, F.R.M.S., Corresponding Member of the Malacological Society of London, &c.\n\nThe Pearl Oyster Question, which has always had a special interest for the Members of this Society, has of recent years become one of growing general importance; for, in proportion as diamonds are becoming more plentiful, the demand for pearls, as ornaments, is likely to increase.\n\nIt might be said that there is little that is new to be discussed before this Society regarding pearl fisheries, seeing that the subject has already found able mention in two valuable contributions to our Journals.* But, hitherto, no attempt has been made to treat the matter from a zoological standpoint, or to go over the field of research systematically, with a view to show in what special particulars the methods employed in conducting the various pearling industries of the world chiefly differ.\n\nI now propose, therefore, to lay these aspects of the matter before you, and at the same time to endeavour to bring to a locus all the reliable information that is up to the present obtainable on the subject of pearl fisheries.\n\nAnd first let me remark, in regard to the term \"fisheries,\" that its employment here is, in a strictly scientific sense, incorrect, since the animals by which pearls are produced properly belong to the class Mollusca, and not to that of Pisces. However, in this connection we chance to have the opinion of an eminent zoological authority.\n\nLecturing, in 1895, at the Royal Colonial Institute\u2020 upon \"Whales and Whale Fisheries,\" the late Sir William Fowler,\n\n* (1) Vane, \"Pearl Fisheries of Ceylon,\" Journal, R.A.S. (C.B.), 1887, vol. X., No. 34; (2) A.M. Ferguson, C.M.G., Address on the \"Jubilee Pearl Fishery\" at the Conversazione of the R.A.S. (C.B.), November 26, 1887.\n\n\u2020 Proc. Royal Colonial Institute, 1895.\nthen Director of the British Museum (Natural History), remarked:\n\nIt happened to me a few years ago to receive a semi-official inquiry from the Colonial Office as to whether a lobster was a fish, because an important point in the dispute between the French and English about the Newfoundland Fisheries depended upon the interpretation of an old treaty in which the word \"fish\" occurs. After giving the modern naturalist's definition of a fish, by which a lobster is clearly excluded from the class, of course I found it necessary to remind my correspondents that in such a case the real answer to the question lay in the sense in which the word was used at the time of the treaty, and by those who were parties in drawing it up, and if that could be ascertained it would be more to the point than the strictest of scientific definitions. Now on turning to what was, in the beginning of the present century, our greatest authority on the meaning of words, I find in Johnson's Dictionary (I now quote from Todd's edition, 1818) \"fish\" defined as \"an animal that inhabits the water.\" Without doubt this was the general and popular view, as the universally used expression shell-fish, lobster and oyster fisheries, whale fisheries, and even seal fisheries, abundantly testify. I therefore cannot say that in a certain vague and antiquated sense of the word, \"fish\" may not be applied to the animals of which I propose to speak to you.\n\nThe seeker after detailed information concerning pearl oysters does not find an abundance of material at his command. On the contrary, the literature dealing with these animals is extremely poor and deficient. It is a remarkable fact that although countless references to pearls occur throughout history, and although the many published accounts of the pearling trade form quite a literature in themselves, there exists at the present time but one work in the English language devoted to pearls, their history, peculiarities, and various uses,* and no single work (so far as I am aware), in any language, which gives an account of the natural history, habits, and instincts of the animals by which pearls are produced.\n\nAt the present time information upon these points is only to be obtained by laboriously searching over the many\n\n* \"Pearls and Pearling Life.\"\u2014E. W. Streeter, London, 1886.\n\nNote.\u2014\"Gold, Gems, and Pearls in Ceylon and Southern India\"\u2014published by the Observer Press in 1888\u2014contains much valuable information on the Ceylon fisheries.\nscattered statistical reports issued from different pearling stations. As a rule, these reports are drawn up for purely commercial purposes, or with the object of laying down rules and regulations for the conduct of the fisheries. Yet, here and there, valuable zoological observations occur, by means of which it is possible to form some idea of the biological conditions which exist at different pearling centres. And from such sources as these a great part of the material here dealt with has been derived.*\n\nVarieties of Pearl Oysters.\n\nPearls are produced by quite a number of different molluscs, and some of these are very widely distributed. Among the bivalves, the great *Tridacna*, the common oyster (*Ostrea edulis*), and many species of *Pinna* produce pearls.\n\nThey are also found in certain species of *Unio* and *Anodonta*\u2014fresh-water shells\u2014which furnish the river pearls of Europe and North America. Certain univalve shells also produce pearls, for example:\u2014*Strombus gigas*, the giant \"conch-shell,\" and several species of *Turbinella*. These produce the pink pearls of the Bahamas and of the West Indies generally.\n\nThe ordinary pearls of commerce may be divided, roughly, into two classes, viz., false or \"seed\" pearls, and true or \"Oriental\" pearls. The two kinds differ greatly both in beauty and value, and are produced by two very distinct genera of shells. These are (1) *Placuna*, with a single pearl-bearing species, which belongs to the family of *Anomiidae*; and (2) *Meleagrina*, which includes several pearl-bearing species, and which belongs to the family of *Aviculidae*.\n\n*I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Mr. R. Etheridge, the Director of the Australian Museum, Sydney, N.S.W., and to Mr. Charles Hedley, the Conchologist of that Institution, for valuable reports and statistics. Also to Professor H.A. Pilsbry, of the Academy of Sciences, Philadelphia, U.S.A., and Mr. T. Nishigawa, of the Imperial Fisheries Bureau, Tokyo, Japan, for information kindly supplied. Further, I am under a special obligation to Mr. John Ferguson, of Colombo, who has most kindly placed at my disposal a valuable collection of Papers relating to various pearl fisheries.*\nPlacuna placenta, commonly known as the \"window-shell\" of the Chinese (because its semi-transparent valves are frequently used in China for illuminating dwelling-houses), is the \"pearl oyster\" of the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, Karatchi, the Bay of Tamblegam near Trincomalee, and the Eastern Archipelago generally as far as Hongkong. Although it produces only \"seed\" pearls, an immense number of people are annually employed in its collection. The pearls themselves are seldom of much value, though there is generally a demand for them in the markets of the East. They are, however, of little importance in the present inquiry; and so we need not further consider them here.\n\nTrue Pearl Oysters.\n\nAll of the species of true pearl oysters belong, as I have just said, to the family of Aviculidae\u2014or \"wing-shells\"\u2014and with this family it will now be necessary for us to form some acquaintance. In the first place, it is one of most respectable antiquity. No less than three hundred species have been recorded in the fossil state, some even from the lower Silurian strata. As a large number of these fossil forms have been discovered in northern latitudes, it is probable that at one time in the earth's history the family was very widely distributed, though it is now almost entirely restricted to tropical and temperate seas. At present only twenty-five recent species are known. Of this number, five, which belong to the genus Meleagrina, are now fished for pearls. These constitute the pearl oysters of Madagascar, Ceylon, Japan, the South Sea Islands, Panama, California, and the northern and western coasts of Australia. Zoologically speaking, they do not belong to the true oysters (Ostreidae), but are much more nearly allied to the mussels, being furnished with a byssus, or \"cable,\" by which they are in the habit of mooring themselves to rocks and other substances at the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe classification of the different species (and varieties) of Meleagrina has not yet been systematically worked out;\nconsequently, their correct identification is a matter of considerable difficulty. We find, for instance, quite a number of shells\u2014bearing both pearls and mother-of-pearl\u2014designated by the common name of *M. margaritifera*; whereas, in all probability, they belong to very distinct species. True, *M. margaritifera* (the mother-of-pearl oyster) does frequently produce pearls, but it differs in many important particulars from the other pearl-bearing species of *Meleagrina*\u2014the shells of which are not, as a rule, of any value as mother-of-pearl.\n\nThe geographical distribution of the pearl-bearing species of *Aviculidae* appears to be as follows:\n\n1. *Avicula (Meleagrina) margaritifera*, Lin.\u2014The large tropical pearl oyster of Northern Australia, the Pacific, and the South Seas generally. It is the mother-of-pearl shell of commerce, and although it often contains pearls it is chiefly fished for the sake of its shell alone.\n\n2. *A. (M.) imbricata*, Rve.\u2014The pearl shell of the northern coast of Western Australia. It is said to be closely allied to the Panama species. It produces pearls, but its shell is of little value.\n\n3. *A. (M.) fimbriata*, Dkr.\u2014The pearl oyster of the Gulf of California and the Bay of Panama.\n\n4. *A. (M.) Martensii*, Dkr. \u2014 The pearl oyster of the Japanese Seas.\n\n5. *A. (M.) fucata*, Gould.\u2014The pearl oyster of the Gulf of Mannar. It also occurs in the Torres Straits and (probably) in the Arabian Seas.*\n\n---\n\n*Mr. Holdsworth, the Naturalist engaged by the Ceylon Government in 1867 to investigate the pearl oyster question (but who unfortunately never had an opportunity of seeing a fishery, and, according to Sir William Twynam, never saw a pearl bank with oysters on it), was the first to point out the distinction between the Gulf of Mannar oyster and that of the Persian and Arabian Seas (*Placuna placenta*). Some shells from the Persian Gulf shown to Captain Donnan appeared to him to exhibit no differences from the Mannar species [*\u201cGold, Gems, and Pearls,\u201d p. 374*]\u2014from which I conclude, having regard to his (Captain Donnan\u2019s) great experience, that the Mannar oyster also occurs, though perhaps sparingly, in the Arabian Seas; and this may account for the occasional discovery of fine \u201cOriental\u201d pearls in that region.*\nThe pearls produced by the above five species are of every shade of colour, from the pale golden pearl of Northern Australia to the lustrous black gem of the Bay of Panama. Those most generally admired however, and which command the highest prices, are of almost transparent whiteness, with a slightly azure reflection. They are known as the \"pearls of the Orient,\" and are produced by the pearl oyster (*M. fucata*) of the Gulf of Mannar.\n\n**Nature and Formation of Pearls.**\n\nIt will be necessary for us to pause here for a moment to consider what is up to the present time known of the nature and formation of pearls, in order that this discussion may have a sound basis.\n\nPearls are an excretion of super-imposed concentric *lamin\u00e6* of a peculiarly fine and dense nacreous substance consisting of membrane and carbonate of lime. The question of their origin has a special attraction for the zoologist, since it still forms one of the unsolved problems of Science. Pliny held the belief that they were drops of dew or rain which fell into the shells when opened by the animals and were then altered by some power of the mollusc into pearls. This view obtained all over the East, and\u2014strange to say\u2014Columbus found the same belief popular among the natives of Mexico. Moore thus alludes to it in his poem \"Peri and the Pearl\":\n\n\"And precious the tear as that rain from the sky  \nWhich turns into pearls as it falls in the sea.\"\n\nAt the present day it is popularly supposed that all pearls have for a nucleus a grain of sand which has become coated with nacre by the animal; but this is simply a conjecture which has gradually become regarded as a fact. As a general rule, it is some organic substance, which behaves in the same way as epidermis when treated with certain chemical re-agents. In some districts one kind of nucleus seems to be more common than another, and this is how the different results obtained by observers in different localities\nmay be explained. The most generally prevalent nuclei appear to be the bodies or eggs of minute internal parasites\u2014such as *Filaria*, *Distoma*, *Bucephalus*, &c. This was pointed out by the late Dr. Kelaart, in his Report to the Ceylon Government on the Pearl Oyster of Aripo;* and his observations were supported by Humbert, the Swiss Naturalist, who accompanied him to the pearl banks in 1859. More recently, similar observations have been made by Mr. Edgar Thurston, of the Madras Museum,\u2020 and the latest conclusions of Science appear to be entirely favourable to the \"parasite\" theory.\n\nThe fact that pearls may be artificially produced by inserting small shot or grains of sand between the mantle and the shell of the animal has long been known. The Chinese have been specially successful in producing pearls in this way; but the best of them are of inferior colour and brightness, and their value is comparatively insignificant. Linn\u00e6us, who was aware of the possibility of producing pearls artificially, suggested the collection of a number of mussels, piercing holes in their shells with a fine auger to produce a wound, and afterwards \"parking\" them for five or six years to give the pearls time to grow. The Swedish Government consented to try the experiment, and long did so. Pearls were produced, but were of little value, and the enterprise was finally abandoned as unsuccessful.\n\nThe distinction between fine pearls and these intrusive bodies coated with nacre was recently demonstrated in an important Paper read before the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Paris, by M. Leon Diguet. He alleges that the latter have only the irridescence of mother-of-pearl, and are in origin analogous to the deposits which increase the shell. The true pearl, he contends, has no connection with the shell itself, but is a pathological calcification or \"stone,\" and seems to arise from parasites. It begins with a small sac of humour,\n\n* \"Report on the Natural History of the Pearl Oyster, Trincomalee,\" 1859.\n\u2020 \"Pearl and Chank Fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar,\" 1894, p.18.\nwhich becomes gelatinous and calcifies in a series of concentric layers, while at its centre may be found a cavity holding organic matter, the remains of the parasites which gave it birth.*\n\n\"Pearl,\" says Saville-Kent, \"is, unfortunately, one of the substances impermeable to the recently discovered R\u00f6ntgen rays; otherwise the solution of this mystery . . . might be easily achieved. May be, however, in the near future a new XX, XXX, or other occult luminant will be evolved which shall possess the property of laying bare and naked the nuclei of pearls.\"\u2020\n\nThe Pearl Fisheries of Australia.\n\nThe pearl fisheries of Australia, which have of late years developed considerable proportions, are conducted in the Torres Straits, on the coast of Queensland, and on the northern coast of Western Australia. Here the large pearl oyster *M. margaritifera* is fished, primarily for the sake of its shell, which furnishes the mother-of-pearl of commerce. Pearls themselves, when discovered, are regarded as more or less of a chance product, and are frequently appropriated by the hired diver and boats' crew\u2014and this may be said to be commonly the custom in all the pearl fisheries of the South Seas. The total value of the pearl-shell fishery of Queensland alone amounted in 1898 to \u00a3109,401 sterling.\n\nOn the northern shores of Australia, in addition to the mother-of-pearl shell (from which almost all Southern pearls are derived), there occur two other species, viz., *M. imbricata*, Rve., and *M. fucata*, Gould, which produce pearls. The latter is identical with the pearl oyster of the Gulf of Mannar, but is, curiously enough, regarded with disfavour in the Australian region, where it is known as the \"bastard\" shell,\u2014probably because its shell is of little value as mother-of-pearl, and also, perhaps, because it does not produce fine \"Oriental\" pearls in the Southern Seas.\n\n* \"Comptes Rendus,\" cxxviii., 1899, p. 1589-91.\n\u2020 \"The Naturalist in Australia,\" p. 201.\nThe pearling grounds of Australia are leased out to various companies and individuals by the Government. These leases are granted only to approved persons, and are subject to certain important conditions and stipulations. No shell below a certain standard of growth is allowed to be removed from the banks; and all shell shipped for exportation must be submitted to the inspection of a Government official specially appointed to guard the industry. Pearls may only be purchased by licensed dealers, and the Government reserves to themselves the right to prohibit at any time the collecting of pearls and pearl-shell on any particular part of the coast. A constant guard is maintained over the banks, and certain areas are prescribed by the Inspectors when they have reason to apprehend any danger to the oysters from the results of over-fishing.\n\nIn the Australian fisheries modern diving apparatus is largely employed, the same being periodically inspected by Government in order to prevent the use of defective gear. Diving for pearls by native divers without diving dress seems likely to be discontinued in this region\u2014especially as it is now found that, as a rule, the best pearl oysters flourish at depths beyond the reach of unprotected divers.\n\nOn the whole, these fisheries appear to be conducted upon a more up-to-date and advanced method than elsewhere. Some interesting experiments in cultivating pearl oysters were made by Mr. W. Saville-Kent, F.L.S., late Commissioner of Fisheries to the Government of Queensland and Western Australia; but the very short period over which his investigations extended, and the limited facilities which he enjoyed for the conduct of his research, rendered it impossible for him to achieve results of any value. He however showed that artificial fertilization and incubation are quite possible, though the questions of conservation and protection from enemies still remain to be dealt with.*\n\n* See Appendix to the Report of the Government Resident of Thursday Island for 1898, by S. Pace, F.Z.S.\nThe Pearl Fishery of Japan.\n\nIn the Bay of Agu, in the Province of Shima, Japan, an extensive pearl fishery exists. The pearl oyster of this region (*M. Martensii*) appears to be the most northerly situated of the pearl-bearing species of *Meleagrina*, and it lives under conditions which more nearly resemble those which obtain on the oyster banks of Europe\u2014where the true oyster (*Ostrea edulis*) is cultivated\u2014than those which surround its own congeners in tropical seas. The Japanese pearl oyster lives in quite shallow water, and is left exposed upon the banks at low tide. This condition of things would seem to present special facilities for artificial cultivation; but, unfortunately, on this very account large numbers of the shells perish of the cold in winter. Professor Mitsukuri, of the Imperial University, Tokyo, has inaugurated an elaborate system of cultivation, which gives promise of good results. One of the principal features of the scheme is the collection of the \"spat\" in shallow water, and its transference to comparatively deep water\u20146 to 7 fathoms\u2014where the temperature is more equable. Here the young oysters are constantly watched and protected against the attacks of predacious foes. I hope to be able to obtain further particulars of this interesting experiment as the work proceeds. At present fuller information is not available.\n\nArtificial cultivation after the Chinese method has also been attempted in Japan; but, so far, only hemispherical pearls, whose bulbs are attached to the shell, have been produced. Japanese pearls are not commonly seen in the markets of London and Paris, probably because there is always a demand for them at home.\n\nThe Pearl Fisheries of California and Panama.\n\nIn the time of the Jesuit Missionaries the Central American pearl fisheries were actively carried on, and produced great wealth to those engaged in the industry. But they afterwards fell into decay, and for many years the banks were thought to have been exhausted. More recently, however,\nthe industry has been revived\u2014chiefly owing to the introduction of modern diving apparatus, which has proved of great utility.\n\nMr. Townsend, of the U.S.A. Fish Commission, says: \"It is not unlikely that the adoption of the submarine engineer's suit by the pearl fishers of La Paz must have been the step which led to the continuance of the pearl fishing industry, for the search for shells can now be pursued into deeper waters than in the days of the naked divers, the best of whom could not descend a dozen fathoms. Half that is rather more than a practical working depth.\" And again, in the same report, Mr. Townsend says: \"Whatever of romance has hitherto enshrouded the naked diver for pearls in the sea, he is now practically a submarine labourer who uses all the modern diving paraphernalia available. No longer plunging for sixty seconds into the sunlit green water that covers a coral bank, he puts on a rubber suit with glass-fronted helmet, and, suitably weighted with lead, descends for hours to gather pearl oysters, which are hoisted in a wire basket by his companions in the boat above, who also supply him through a rubber tube with the air he breathes.\"\n\n*M. fimbriata* is the pearl oyster of this region, but *M. margaritifera* is also fished here as elsewhere in the Pacific. Here again, mother-of-pearl shell is the principal object of the search, its value being sufficient to pay the expense of the fishing, leaving any pearls which may be obtained a clear gain. In America also, as in Australia, the banks are rented out for fixed periods to different pearling traders.\n\nIn the Pacific the oysters are usually opened with a knife. This, if properly performed, is said to be the best plan, for pearls are considered liable to become discoloured if the animal is allowed to decompose before the shell is opened.\n\n*The Pearl Fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar.*\n\nThe principal fishery in this region is that conducted on the eastern side of the Gulf, in the neighbourhood of Aripo,\n\n---\n\n* Bulletin, U.S. Fish Commission., vol. IX., 1889, pp. 91-94.\nCeylon\u2014the pearl banks on the Indian coast having now almost ceased to be remunerative.\n\nAt the Conference Meeting of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in 1886 Sir James Longden (formerly Governor of the Island) remarked that the pearl fishery of Ceylon was \"one of the most ancient\u2014perhaps the most ancient industry of the world; that it was carried on to-day as it had been for two thousand to three thousand years; and that it owed little or nothing to modern civilization in the manner of getting from the depths of the sea that wonderful beautiful product of Nature, the pearl.\"*\n\nThe Ceylon fishery, besides being entirely carried on by unprotected native divers, is further distinguished from those which we have just been considering in being the only fishery in the Tropics where pearls alone are sought for, irrespective of the shells, the nacreous lining of the valves of the Gulf of Mannar oyster (*M. fucata*) being of little or no commercial value.\u2020\n\nIt will not be necessary for me to enter into details here regarding the methods employed in the conduct of the Ceylon fishery. They have already been fully described by Capt. Steuart, Sir Emerson Tennent, Mr. Vane, Mr. Edgar Thurston, and, quite recently, by Sir William Twynam in his very complete and elaborate report just published.\u2021 Let it suffice to say that the industry is now a Government monopoly, carried on under the inspection and control of specially appointed officers, the system which was formerly in vogue of renting the pearl banks having been entirely discontinued since the year 1837.\n\n* Proc. Royal Colonial Institute, 1886.\n\u2020 The mother-of-pearl oyster (*M. margaritifera*) also occurs, though very rarely, in the Gulf of Mannar. See Thurston, \"Pearl and Chank Fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar,\" 1894.\n\u2021 (1) Tennent, \"Nat. Hist. of Ceylon,\" p. 373; (2) Capt. Steuart, \"Account of the Pearl Fisheries,\" 1843; (3) Vane, \"Pearl Fisheries of Ceylon,\" R.A.S. Journal, vol. X., 1887; (4) Thurston, \"Pearl and Chank Fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar,\" 1894; (5) Twynam, \"Report on Ceylon Pearl Fisheries,\" 1900. See also the many valuable \"Inspection Reports\" by Capt. Donnan, Inspector of the Pearl Banks, for the last thirty-seven years.\nThere appears to have always been a considerable amount of uncertainty in respect of the amount of revenue derivable from this industry. Writing in 1697, for the instruction of the Political Council of Jaffnapatam, the then Commandant of that town justly remarked that \"the pearl fishery is an extraordinary source of revenue on which no reliance can be placed, as it depends on various contingencies which may ruin the banks or spoil the oysters.\" This statement holds good after a lapse of more than two centuries\u2014indeed, the periodical disappearance of oysters from certain of the banks, sometimes for many years at a time, may be said to form one of the peculiar characteristics of the Ceylon fishery.\n\nNevertheless, since the British occupation of the Island a sum equal to more than one million sterling has been derived from the fishery; and the matter is therefore one of immense importance to the Government of the Colony.\n\nConservation of Pearl Oysters.\n\nThe question as to whether any means can be adopted to conserve the oysters upon the beds, and thus to place the industry upon a more stable and permanent footing, must in the first instance depend upon a knowledge of the physical and biological conditions ruling upon the different banks. There are reasons for supposing that these conditions undergo frequent change; but the cause, or causes, thereof have yet to be definitely ascertained. It is well known that the northern and western coasts of Ceylon are being gradually uplifted from the sea.* On this account it is possible that an increasing amount of sand\u2014which is very injurious to all bivalve molluscs\u2014is finding its way from the northern rivers into the waters of the gulf.\u2020 It may also be that\n\n* Mr. Boake, in his Monograph of Mannar (1888), tells us that a pearl bank at one time existed on the north of that island; and, according to ancient Singhalese records, there were formerly pearl banks in the vicinity of Mount Lavinia. It is significant that of the 85 pearl banks in the Gulf of Mannar, viz., 19 on the Ceylon coast and 66 on the Indian, only two, the Cheval and Modragam banks, are now profitable.\n\n\u2020 \"Man-aar\" is Tamil for \"sandy river.\"\nchanges in the temperature, and in the degree of salinity of the water, have the effect of rendering certain of the banks untenable to the oysters for more or less prolonged periods. Further, it is stated upon good authority that the strong ocean currents from the Bay of Bengal, which sweep round the coasts of Ceylon and Southern India, contribute largely to the causes which denude the oyster banks. Altogether, it will be seen that this question is one of some difficulty, and that it must involve the solution of quite a number of local marine problems.\n\nOn the western coast of South America, which is likewise at present being upraised from the sea,* pearl fisheries formerly existed, which gave rise to wealthy and populous cities\u2014\"whose very ruins have now perished.\" Yet, doubtless, some day Science will provide means for the revival of these industries, possibly\u2014as in the case of the fisheries of California\u2014by the introduction of special diving apparatus; for, after all, it may be found that the oysters have merely migrated seawards into deeper and more sheltered waters.\n\nIn regard to the questions of artificial cultivation and conservation, it is important to observe that the pearl oyster\u2014like the Strassburg goose\u2014only becomes of special commercial value when it has developed certain conditions of organic disease. We have already seen that pearls must be regarded as a pathological product, and we find this conclusion well supported in the records of the fisheries. These contain frequent references to the number of pearls found in diseased and dying oysters; and experienced divers are apparently agreed that the probability of finding pearls is always greater when the oysters are crowded together, and become humped and distorted in shape,\u2020 and at the same time afford cover for all kinds of marine worms and parasitic creatures. Thus, unhealthy conditions of living must presumably be encouraged in order to promote the\n\n* Darwin, \"Naturalist's Voyage in the 'Beagle.'\"\n\u2020 These small thick oysters are called by the people \"Koddai-pakku,\" viz., \"arecanut oysters\" (Twynam's Report, p. 59).\ndiseases which lead to the formation of pearls. In the course of an address to the Malacological Society of London, in 1896, Professor Howes, referring to the peculiar characteristics of certain marine mollusca (chitons), remarked: \"In its bearings on the conditions of local distribution in shallow water, on bathymetric extension, and specific variation as related to these influences, the experimental method appears to me to give promise of most important results in Malacology. Just as the physiological graduates off into the pathological, the full significance of many a healthy or a diseased state becoming intelligible only on a knowledge of its opposite, so, in the hands of the experimentalist, the normal phenomena of animal life will most assuredly in course of time become illumined by prolonged and careful study of the organism under changed conditions. And from all that is now going forward it is plain that the pathologist holds the key to many a life problem.\"\n\n3. Captain DONNAN read the following Paper bearing on the subject:\u2014\nRemarks upon some of the Questions referred to in Mr. Collett's Paper on Pearl Oysters and Pearl Fisheries.\n\nPersian Gulf and Gulf of Mannar Pearl Oysters.\n\nIn regard to the remarks upon the similarity of the Gulf of Mannar pearl oysters to those of the Persian Gulf, and the suggestion that the former is comparatively rare in the Arabian Seas, I will relate how I came to ascertain that the Gulf of Mannar oyster is found in great abundance in the Persian Gulf. When I went to England in 1875 I took with me a small sample of Ceylon pearl oyster shells to ascertain if they were of any commercial value, and during my visit to London I went into the office in Mincing Lane of Messrs. Brooks & Faith, Produce Brokers, saw the head of the firm, and asked him if my sample of oyster shells was of any commercial value. He looked at them and said, \"These are what we call Lingas from the Persian Gulf.\" I replied, that they came from Ceylon. He said, \"Don't tell me that, I know better,\" and pointing to a shelf on which there were a large number of oyster shells said, \"There are your shells, they have come from the Persian Gulf, and large quantities of them are sent to us regularly from Bombay.\" He then examined my sample and said, \"You have been polishing them up, and if you had not done so they would have been worth thirty shillings per cwt.\" I replied that the only polishing they had was that of being exposed to the sun and rain on the beach at Sillavaturai for twelve months.\n\nThe Lingas on the shelf were similar in every respect to the Gulf of Mannar oysters.\n\nI have recently seen in print that the annual value of the Persian Gulf Pearl Fishery is \u00a3300,000.\n\nOn my return to Ceylon I obtained the sanction of Government to send home a trial shipment of pearl oyster shells, and in December, 1876, the shells of 12,000 oysters that had\nbeen lifted for a sample of pearls for the fishery of the following years were sent to the Crown Agents to dispose of, in communication with Messrs. Brooks & Faith, but subsequently they reported that the shells were of no value.\n\nHowever, the Gulf of Mannar pearl oyster shell must now be of some value, as during the recent fisheries men were sent by mercantile firms in Colombo to collect shells for shipment to Europe.\n\nMigration of Oysters and Employment of Divers with Diving Dress.\n\nIt has frequently been surmised when oysters were reported to have disappeared from a bed and no traces left of them, that they had probably migrated to some other more suitable locality, into depths beyond the capacity of native divers to reach; and that the employment of European divers with diving dress might be the means of tracing them or of finding new beds of oysters.\n\nMy experience of pearl oysters is that they only move about in their young stage, say up to one year old, and after that age they remain on the bed they settle down upon, if a rocky bed, until they come to ripe old age, unless they are forcibly removed; but if they happen to come on a sandy bed, they would have no means of holding on, and would most probably be drifted away and destroyed.\n\nI am led to this conclusion by observing that it is only during their young stage that I find, when at anchor on a bed of oysters, that they attach themselves to the vessel's cable. The fact of the oysters mooring themselves by such a strong cable as they do would also bear out this conclusion, for if they were in the habit of moving about always it would be unnatural for them to moor with many threads of their byssus, when one or two threads would be sufficient for a temporary resting-place. But, supposing they were in the habit of migrating and got into depths beyond the capacity of the native diver, say 10 fathoms as his greatest working depth, the configuration of the bed of the ocean in\nthe neighbourhood of the pearl banks is such, that a short distance westward of 10 fathoms would take them into depths beyond the capacity of even the diver with diving dress, as the edge of the bank of soundings is precipitous.\n\nIt has often been suggested also that better results would be obtained on the pearl banks by the employment of divers with diving dress, both at inspections of banks and at fisheries; but as a matter of fact, I have had experience of the diver with diving dress in both these cases.\n\nSome years ago a European diver was employed regularly at inspections of the banks, and in April, 1884, I had four European divers, along with native divers, employed in the fishing of a bank of oysters off Chilaw, when I found the native divers brought up in a day's work as many oysters per diver as the European divers.\n\nAt inspections of the banks it is necessary to get over the ground quickly, as there are very large areas to be examined, and the native diver, who can be taken about in a handy rowing boat, making a dive when wanted, during which he goes over a space of about 20 square yards and brings up a sample of what is on the bottom, over that area, all in about one minute, is just the man required. I have never known any of the native divers employed at inspections to give a false report of the state of the bottom, and I have found that I could form a far better idea of the state of a bank from their reports than I could from that of the European diver, who could not move about as quickly as the native.\n\nIn this connection I will relate an amusing incident that occurred during the fishery off Chilaw in April, 1884. One morning the European divers reported to me that there were no oysters where the vessel was anchored, and asked for it to be moved to another part of the bank. I knew from the native diver's report that the vessel was anchored on the best part of the bank, so I called up four native boats and told the tindals to work close round the ships, which they did, and their native divers sent up oysters, 50 to a dive. On seeing this the European divers began work again and found\noysters. Some time after they had been working, I was looking over the vessel's side, and observing the life line of one of the European divers being violently jerked, I called out to his attendants to haul him up quickly, believing that some accident had happened, and that the poor man might be hauled in unconscious or even dead; but when landed on the stage he was very much alive, for when the front piece of his helmet was removed, he bawled out in a stentorian voice, \"Where's the man who stole my oysters?\" He then explained that he had kept a basket at the foot of his ladder to hold the oysters as he gathered them up, and that when he returned to the basket with the last handful of oysters required to fill it, he found the basket empty and oysters gone, and that his rage at this mishap caused him to tug so violently at the life line. The oysters had been commandeered by one of the native divers (belonging to one of the boats working close by) while the European diver was away from his basket.\n\nThis I found out some time afterwards, but as there was no evidence available at the time the thief escaped punishment, much to the annoyance of the European diver.\n\nPhysical Changes in the Bed of the Sea on the Pearl Banks.\n\nAs far back as my experience goes there have been no material changes of this nature. It is true the divers at times reported small portions of the rocky part of a pearl oyster bed to be covered with a layer of sand a few inches deep, and on one occasion during a small fishery off Chilaw the divers reported the oysters were being covered up with sand, and that they had a difficulty in getting at the oysters, as they were swayed to and fro by the sea, although they were at a depth of nine fathoms. This was evidently caused by a heavy ground swell rolling in at the time, and if it swayed the divers about was also probably causing the silting up of sand on the oysters. These occurrences are, however, rare, or have been rarely noticed. The bed of the Cheval and Modragam Paars seem to remain undisturbed by physical changes, as the area and configuration of the rocky portions\nhave been fairly maintained during my time. No silting up or upheaval in their neighbourhood can be detected by the soundings, which have not decreased during the last seventy years. Changes, however, are taking place on the shore in that neighbourhood. The cliff opposite the \"Doric\" is gradually washing away, and much of the island of Karaitivu has disappeared since I first knew it. On the other hand, the spit forming the western side of Dutch Bay has been extended into the sea in a north-east direction about one mile during the last forty years.\n\nEnemies of the Pearl Oyster and Currents.\n\nThe enemies of the pearl oyster are no doubt many, as it seems to be the nature of all animal life in the sea to prey upon each other; but the chief ones to be feared and destroyed, if possible, are the various species of fish that feed on the bottom, and for that reason are commonly called rock fish. These, with the exception of skate, are however only destructive to the pearl oysters when they are young and their shells tender, say up to the age of eighteen months or two years, after which age the smaller kinds of rock fish, which appear to be most numerous, do not do much harm.\n\nGenerally speaking, when I have been at anchor on a bed of young oysters the crew of the vessel have caught many rock fish, the stomachs of which were found to contain many fragments of the young oyster shells, thus proving the source of their food.\n\nA bed of young oysters no doubt attracts these rock fish, which appear to come on it in great swarms, and although the young oysters are very numerous, and are generally very thickly spread over large areas\u2014I have counted as many as 40 attached to the fragment of an old oyster shell\u2014yet their enemies are numerous also, and are capable of causing much destruction, often completely annihilating the whole bed, leaving not a vestige behind when I visit the bank a year later; so that if some means could be devised of destroying or keeping these rock fish away from a bank of young oysters\nfor a couple of years, there would undoubtedly be more Pearl Fisheries. If, for instance, fishermen could be induced to take, say, 200 canoes to one of these beds of young oysters, and fish on it daily for two or three months, it would have a very good effect, and might possibly cause the dispersion of the fish, which readily take bait, and the numbers likely to be caught would well reward the fishermen.\n\nCurrents must also be classified amongst the enemies of the pearl oyster, for although they bring the spat on to the oyster beds, they also occasionally sweep mature oysters away from the beds.\n\nThe most noteworthy current on record is that which in December, 1887, swept away a very valuable bed of oysters, estimated at 155 millions, from the Cheval Paar. Ten millions of them were found during the fishery in the following March, from two to three miles in a south-easterly direction from their original position. Attributing this to a current, I inquired of the man in charge of the steam tug \"Active\" doing duty on the Cheval Paar at the time, and he reported that in the middle of December there was a strong current lasting a week, running in a southerly direction, and was so strong, about 4 knots, that he had to drop a second anchor to prevent the vessel being dragged away by it. The fishermen on Karaitivu island subsequently confirmed the existence of a strong southerly current running in December.\n\nThe loss of that bed of oysters was a loss to Government of at least 20 lakhs of rupees.\n\nOn this occasion I was able to make an interesting experiment as to the ability of pearl oysters to resist a current. The divers had brought up a large Pinna shell with several oysters attached to it by their byssus. The \"Active\" was got under way and the Pinna shell towed in the sea alongside. The oysters held on for an hour, while the \"Active\" was going at a speed of 4 knots, but when the speed was increased to 5 knots they shortly began to drop off one by one. Although the oysters resisted a 4-knot current for one hour,\nthey evidently had to give away when the strain of a current of that velocity was prolonged for a week. I doubt very much their ability to resist even a 3-knot current for that length of time.\n\nYoung oysters have a much stronger hold than oysters advancing to maturity. The divers often remark when on young oysters that they could not bring up many, as they were holding on fast; but when they come away easily the divers say they are fit for fishing.\n\nThere is no record of a current similar to that of December, 1887, having occurred previously, and I look upon that one as very exceptional, particularly as to its course, which was in a south-easterly direction.\n\nI am of opinion that it was caused by an unusually large volume of the north-east monsoon ocean current flowing into the Gulf of Mannar, and seeking an outlet by sweeping round the head of the gulf, and down its eastern shore, until it joined the main stream on its course from the coast of Ceylon towards Cape Comorin. It is well known that the current from the Bay of Bengal in November and December runs south along the east coast of Ceylon at the rate of 2 to 3 knots an hour. It curves round the south coast, and after rounding Galle takes a north-westerly course past Cape Comorin. Sometimes it follows the west coast of Ceylon to the north of Negombo, and then branches off towards Cape Comorin. A larger volume than usual coming this way would probably advance further up the coast than Negombo, say to Chilaw, and then branch off towards Cape Comorin, and in that case some portion of the stream might, before reaching Cape Comorin, be deflected along the Tuticorin shore and then follow the course I have described. I cannot account for a south-east current on the Cheval Paar in December in any other way.\n\nThere are also unknown enemies of the pearl oyster. For instance, when oysters too young for fishing are found dying off in large numbers, it has not yet been discovered what causes them occasionally to be in that condition.\nThe question of discovering means of successfully securing pearl oysters against their enemies is a most difficult one to solve. Currents are uncontrollable, and as regards living and unknown enemies, success against their predations appears to me to be very doubtful. Yet in these wonderful progressive times there is no knowing what the employment of scientific skill to deal with these questions might be able to accomplish.\n\nArtificial Cultivation of Pearl Oysters.\n\nI have tried a small experiment in cultivating pearl oysters by depositing a quantity of young oysters in an excavation which I had made for them in the Sillavaturai coral reef, three miles from the shore; but it was not successful.\n\nIn March, 1885, I had 12,000 oysters eighteen months old lifted from the Cheval Paar and placed in the tank on the reef three hours after they were lifted, having been kept in the meantime in a boat half filled with sea water; but when I returned to Sillavaturai the following year they had disappeared. I then constructed a new tank on a more sheltered part of the reef, 12 feet square and 4 feet deep at low water. Much mud was found between the branches of the coral, but it was all well cleared out, and a quantity of coral stone was placed in the bottom of the tank and around the side on the top of the reef, to protect the tank from the wash of the sea at high water.\n\nWhen this new tank was completed it seemed an ideal place for such an experiment,\u2014beautiful clear water in it and not a sign of mud. 5,000 oysterstwo and a half years old taken from the Cheval Paar were placed in it; and 1,000 in a large wooden cage, made for the purpose, which was weighted with stone and sunk in 9 feet of water, half a mile from the beach.\n\nI left Sillavaturai on that occasion in hope of my experiment being successful; but alas! on my return a year afterwards I found the oysters in the beautiful tank on the reef all dead\u2014having been smothered in 18 inches of mud at the bottom of it, which had been washed into it from\nadjoining parts of the reef by the south-west monsoon sea, and the cage was found broken up and the few oysters left in it were dead. And thus ended my experiments in artificial cultivation. I subsequently thought of making a preserve on some part of the eastern shore of the island of Karaitivu, but had to give up that idea, as I found on searching for a suitable spot that it was all muddy bottom, which would have been fatal to young oysters. There appears to be no sheltered spot on the west coast of Ceylon suitable for pearl oyster cultivation. Some of the bays in Trincomalee harbour might prove suitable, and if so, they would be, I believe, the only places likely to be found for this experiment in Ceylon. The late Dr. Kelaart succeeded in taking pearl oysters from Sillavaturai in chatties round to Trincomalee, and in keeping them alive for some time after.\n\nIn connection with this subject the question arises whether or not, in the event of pearl oysters being successfully reared in shallow water, it would be necessary to lay them out in their natural beds to produce pearl. During a visit I made in 1867 to the edible oyster preserves on Hayling Island, near Portsmouth, I was informed that it was necessary, when the young oysters had attained an age of one year or more in the preserves, to lay them out on their natural beds to fatten, and this might be found necessary also in the case of pearl oysters for the purpose of producing pearls. The native headmen who were employed at fisheries and inspection of the pearl banks years ago declared that oysters found in shallow water never contained pearls, and that only those found in deep water were of any value. I have not had an opportunity of testing this theory; but if it is correct, then any scheme of pearl oyster culture attempted hereafter would have to contend with the risk of young oysters, after transference to their natural beds, being at the mercy of their enemies almost as much as they are now; and in that case, Trincomalee would be too far away from the beds in the Gulf of Mannar, as the cost of transference of the large number of young oysters required to produce a fishery would\nbe prohibitive, even if found feasible. There are no known pearl oyster beds on the east coast of Ceylon. The headman's theory is, however, supported by the fact of a bed of pearl oysters on the Kondatchi Paar being abandoned in 1855, owing to the oysters being unremunerative in pearls. This bank lies in from 3 to $3\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms of water three miles from the shore.\n\nThe following quotation from Mr. Edgar Thurston's Bulletin No. 1, on Pearl and Chank Fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar, 1894, is significant:\n\nThe artificial cultivation of the pearl oysters was attempted some years ago in a nursery made in the shallow muddy water of the Tuticorin harbour without success; and in his final report to the Ceylon Government Mr. Holdsworth expresses his opinion, with which I thoroughly concur, that there is no ground for thinking that artificial cultivation of the pearl oyster can be profitably carried out on the Ceylon coast, as the conditions necessary for the healthy growth of the oysters are not to be found in the very few places where they could be at all protected or watched.\n\n4. Mr. Haly, on being invited to offer any remarks by H. E. the Governor, stated, that he knew nothing more about the Pearl Oyster\u2014nor did he take any more interest in it\u2014than any other invertebrate of the great Indo-Pacific Fauna. As to its migrations, it shares that habit with numerous species of widely different classes. Last year he accompanied Professor Gooderich to Trincomalee in hopes of obtaining certain species abundant there in 1887 and 1890; but although the whole coast and harbour were carefully searched not a single specimen was procured. In the same way a very large and handsome Aplysia or sea-hare and a species of Melibe (a most strange and remarkable mollusc) appeared in August and September in Weligama bay; this year the Aplysia cannot be found and the Melibe is scarce. When he expressed his surprise to Mr. Gooderich at the disappearance of the species formerly so abundant at Trincomalee, Professor Gooderich stated that the same phenomenon occurs on every coast. A scientific inquiry on a large scale, therefore, into the Pearl Oyster fishery could not fail to be of great benefit to the Museum as tending to throw more or less light on the habits of numerous species of widely remote classes.\n\nH. E. the Governor next called on Mr. Ferguson, who said:\u2014I suppose it is because I am the oldest member on the roll of the Society in Colombo that I have been asked to propose a cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Collett for the interesting and extremely useful Paper he has read to us this evening. In any case it gives me very great pleasure to comply with the request. It is interesting to note that from time\nimmemorial there have been fisheries of pearls and pearl shell all round the Indian Ocean, on the African, Asiatic, and Austral coasts; from Mozambique to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, to Karachi, the Gulf of Mannar; the Tinnevelly and Ceylon coasts; the Burmah coast at Bahrein; the Saigon, Philippines, and Bornean, as well as Chinese coasts, and up some of the Chinese rivers; and also round one-half of Australia. Our Ceylon fisheries are among the oldest and most famous, seeing that a European visitor found 8,000 boats at work about the middle of the 14th century. But, then, in the Book of Job, some 3,500 years ago, there was mention made of both \"coral and pearls.\" In Europe pearls of value have been got from the mussels fished in our Scottish rivers; the pearls in the Scottish Crown, now forming the regalia of Great Britain, were all got in the Tay, and the pearls gathered there in three years (1761\u20131764) were valued at \u00a310,000. A fine pearl similarly found in the Conway is said to be in the Royal Crown of England. Now, remembering that the Scottish mussel is allied to the so-called Ceylon pearl oyster, it will be seen that pearls can be cultivated in quiet river estuaries as well as in the deep water on Ceylon banks, and in the case of Australia inside the barrier reefs. I have taken a special interest in this question of pearl oysters and their culture ever since I visited Western Australia in 1875. Sir Wm. Robinson was Governor there, and he kindly put all available information about the local pearl shell and oyster fishing, then in their infancy, at my disposal. I met the gentleman who first discovered that the blisters on the inside of the large pearl shells contained fine pearls, of a golden yellow or white colour, some of which were valued up to \u00a31,500 each; while one cluster, known as the \"Southern Cross,\" was valued up to \u00a310,000. Captain Donnan may be surprised to learn that in those early days so plentiful were the oysters within the barrier reef on the west and north-west coast of Australia, that the pearlers simply waded in and pulled up from the reefs in shallow water an ample supply of large oysters, some of them with very fine pearls. This fact is also mentioned by Saville-Kent; but the case is very different now, all the fishing being in deep water\u2014only it seems to show that such oysters flourish and develop pearls even in comparatively shallow water.\n\nThe readiness with which pearl oysters adhere by their byssus is shown by some 40 being found on a single Pinna or Razor shell, and by Mr. Saville-Kent's experience of their growing above a mangrove swamp off N.-W. Australia. There is great encouragement, too, for culture when we know that the happy little family for which each oyster prepares a dainty home numbers, on an average, as many as 12 million eggs, and this when the parent is but one year old. An English dramatist has told us that \"an oyster may be crossed in love,\" but there is ample margin to go upon; and our little meleagrina is most enterprising and able both to climb a wall and take a walk, justifying that other poet of \"the Walrus and the Carpenter,\" wher\nhe said: \"Oh, oyster, come and walk with us.\" (Laughter.) I trust, therefore, that the step taken with so much promptitude and public spirit by Your Excellency and approved by the Secretary of State, in referring Sir William Twynam's Report for the highest scientific opinion in England, may result in a Scientific Mission of Inquiry and Experiment. Professor Ray Lankester would seem to be a little unjust to Mr. Holdsworth, who signed himself F.L.S., F.Z.S., and who first showed us the difference between certain pearl or pearl shell yielding oysters. But it was a fact that Mr. Holdsworth had never seen a fishery or even a bank covered with our oysters; and therefore there was much reason to hope that Professor Herdman, F.R.S.\u2014if he came out, now that he and the scientific world know so much more than in the \"sixties,\" and especially if he had the help and experience of our expert, Capt. Donnan, and was also lent the aid of Dr. Thurston by the Indian authorities (who ought to be asked to join in the Mission with Ceylon)\u2014would be able to give us results worthy of his high reputation and keen powers of observation. There was a great deal of literature, including accounts of Pearl Fisheries and experiments, to be collated\u2014there might even be later reports in reference to Californian and Central American Fisheries, than Mr. Collett or himself had obtained;\u2014but not the least interesting contributions to place before Professor Herdman would be both the valuable Papers read that evening; and Mr. Collett, by introducing the subject and giving the Society so good a Paper, had laid the Members and the whole intelligent community of Ceylon under a debt of gratitude, for which he deserved the cordial vote of thanks he thus proposed with great pleasure. (Applause.)\n\nDr. Van Dort:\u2014I have much pleasure in seconding the vote of thanks to Mr. Collett for the very interesting Paper he has just read to us. Although it professes to be only a resum\u00e9 of information derived mostly from sober scientific journals and statistical reports of a not especially enlivening nature, it has nothing of the dry-as-dust character traditionally associated with Scientific Papers, but reads more like an article intended for a popular monthly than a contribution to a staid Scientific Journal like ours. To some extent, no doubt, he has been inspired by his theme, which appeals to so many interests\u2014historic, poetic, economic, and even political\u2014over and above its scientific aspects, and has even allowed himself to subordinate the instincts of the born naturalist to the demands of literary art, as, for instance, in sandwiching the only technical portion of his Paper\u2014not the least important from a scientific point of view\u2014between a quaint disquisition on the right of an oyster to be called a fish (reminding one of Baron Cuvier's famous criticism of the French Encyclop\u00e6dist's definition of a crab), and an interesting speculation on the folk-lore relating to the origin of Pearls. I, for one, was hoping that while in this mood he would, even while accepting the ugly theory (if scientifically\nestablished, which I doubt) of the parasitic origin of pearls, have protested against the scientific barbarity, which has no excuse, of robbing the pearl oyster\u2014our Ceylon oyster\u2014of its legitimate time-honoured beautiful Greek name, associated with a thousand poetic legends and at least one great Biblical illustration, and substituting for it a vile inappropriate Latin term, which means, not only painted and coloured, but false and counterfeit. But, like a true Englishman, it is the commercial, practical aspect of the subject which has engaged his attention, rather than its aesthetic side, so I am not surprised to find him strike the keynote of his Paper in the introductory announcement, that since diamonds like South African shares are going up, the Ceylon Government and the Ceylon Public had better look after their interests in local fisheries, as pearls are sure to follow suit. After such a warning, it is hardly necessary to say that in the selection of his scientific facts he has collated them (if I may be excused the term) so as to keep in view all those that are likely to be of general interest, and eschew what would be technical and comparatively uninteresting. I should have wished, however, he had given the natural history of the bivalve he had selected for his subject, a little more of his attention on the Paper he has read to us, as no one could have dealt with it better with his extensive reading and special researches in this section of Natural Science. I have no intention of detaining the meeting at this late hour, and shall therefore confine myself only to one or two points of practical importance, on which I shall be glad to be enlightened by Mr. Collett. The first refers to the question mooted originally by Dr. Kelaart in his report of 1857\u2014Are oysters monoecious or dioecious?\u2014in other words, are the two sexes found in separate individuals, or are they all female or hermaphrodite capable of breeding by self-fertilization? Now, according to Dr. Kelaart, who is universally acknowledged to be the highest authority on the subject, there is no proper distinction between the two sexes except in the contents of the ovarium or egg-bag, which in 97 or 98 per cent. contain ova at all stages of growth even from birth, and only in one or two per cent. contains the fluid essential for cross fertilization and no ova at all. These oysters then represent the male individuals, though there is nothing in the external coat or internal structure to distinguish them from the others. The practical importance of this fact comes in with the light it throws on a possible frequent cause of the disappearance of oysters from old oyster beds. For, if cross fertilization be essential to the production of a healthy progeny, as Darwin has established, and large colonies of such progeny growing together are necessary to form a productive \"band,\" as Kelaart has shown, the destruction of the few males by any accidental cause may suffice for the extinction of an entire bank of oysters. Mr. Collett himself, to whom I referred this point before the lecture, was good enough to explain to me that he believed that the female oyster has it in her power to change her sex as often as she chooses, a wonderful fact, if it be the case; only it is\nto be hoped that Nature has limited this marvellous power of self-transformation to the oyster, which exceeds, I think, all that the new woman with all her claims for woman's rights could imagine in her wildest dreams. But I believe even Mr. Collett is not quite sure on this point, so that one of the most important problems connected with the life-history of this bivalve still remains to be solved by Science.\n\nAnother point on which I should wish to be enlightened by Mr. Collett is with regard to the formation of pearls. He has given in his adhesion to the parasitic theory, and even quotes Dr. Kelaart in support of it; but a careful reading of Dr. Kelaart's reports, both of 1857 and 1858, seems to me to show that while he only countenanced the parasitic theory as accounting for exceptionally, as it were, the formation of pearls in some cases, he never abandoned his original theory, made from actual observation, that the true nuclei of true pearls are the ova of the pearl oyster itself as a rule, and only exceptionally the ova of parasites that enter its body with its food, while only inferior and irregular false pearls result from the artificial intrusion of particles of sand, &c., to serve as nuclei. So far as my reading goes, Dr. Evarard Home, in the last century, was the first to advance the theory of abortive ova being the nuclei of pearls, and Dr. Kelaart at first accepted it with a modification by saying that it was not the ova which are left behind in the ovarium, but those which escape through the over-distended coat of the egg-chamber, when it ruptured as it may easily do near the hinge, when they would bury themselves in the interstices of the mantle and so become the nuclei of pearls. But in his later Report of 1859 he says he was so fortunate as to find an entire ovarium charged with no less than 32 pearls, and still another which he did not open, but which appeared to contain as many more\u2014thus completely confirming Dr. Home's theory. Both these specimens he sent to Dr. Owen, and are now to be seen in the Museum of the College of Surgeons in London.\n\nHow, or whence the nacre or pearl-lining substance was formed for these pearls in the ovary, Dr. Kelaart would not or could not determine, but he supposes with great probability\u2014that Science at the present day can easily confirm\u2014that the ovarium membrane can secrete it. For it is a curious circumstance that human pathology affords analogous illustrations both of abortive ova and even embryos becoming the centres of new and varied forms of all growth, and sometimes of concretions of an intensely hard character known as lithopadia; but, still more curiously, that the lining membrane of the ovary from which proceed these metamorphosed but unimpregnated ova sometimes secretes the most extraordinary structures, such as bones, teeth, hair, &c., without any trace of embryonic formation, which may even grow from the ovary of the embryo itself, and become serious pathological tumors in after life. It is unnecessary for me to point out the bearing that this theory of Dr. Kelaart's has on the proper method of oyster culture. Entirely opposed as it is to that now proposed, based on the theory that conditions which favour the entrance of parasites which\nfoster disease are the best for pearl formation. In conclusion, I am sure that Mr. Collett will do Dr. Kelaart the justice to acknowledge that although there may be no ponderous monograph in any language on the natural history of the oysters\u2014and a great book, according to the great proverb, is not seldom a great evil\u2014his reports on the subject, though written nearly fifty years ago, are as complete as far as they go on the subject as could be desired. There has been little that is new that has been discovered by naturalists since, to supply the desiderata Mr. Collett refers to in his Paper. I say this because I do not think Ceylon has sufficiently acknowledged the debt of gratitude she owes Dr. Kelaart for his researches in connection with the Ceylon pearl oyster. One of the earliest sons of the soil\u2014belonging to the Burgher community, who, having secured a British decree, entered the Army Medical Service, where his reputation as a scientist generally, as Geologist, as Botanist, as Zoologist, especially as a Conchologist in connection with the subject of Pearl Oysters\u2014has received the recognition of the whole scientific world. (Applause.)\n\n5. The vote of thanks to Mr. Collett for his Paper was carried by acclamation.\n\nMr. Collett, in replying, said he would like to answer one or two points raised by Dr. Van Dort. Firstly, he would refer to Sir W. Twynam as regards the pathological and zoological study of the oyster; that authority said that our knowledge in this respect was still almost nil. His own Paper had been entirely theoretical, summarizing the latest writings on the subject; and he (the speaker) had taken it up more as a zoological recreation for a busy planter than with any scientific experience of the subject. Dr. Van Dort had expected him to put into the Paper more than he (Mr. Collett) had intended. He was very gratified at the reception his Paper had received. He could feel that if it had done nothing else, it had elicited a most interesting discussion, and he thanked them all for their cordial vote of thanks. (Applause.)\n\n6. The Bishop of Colombo: I propose a very hearty vote of thanks to His Excellency for occupying the Chair this evening. In any assembly of the inhabitants of Ceylon we are very much pleased to have the Governor with us, and the Members of this Society felt that in a particular degree. We are very grateful to His Excellency for having made the effort to come out on this wet night. Cynical outsiders might say that a Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society would be the very place to come to on a wet night, because they would be sure to find something dry. (Laughter.) Such a person would have been hopelessly wrong on an occasion like that evening. I am not aware to what extent His Excellency gives a personal study, amidst his many vocations, to those matters which particularly occupy us as a learned Society, but it is quite certain that in one Branch of our proceedings His Excellency encourages us by.\nhis presence this evening, as in that part of our proceedings in which we try to lay or develop that scientific basis, upon which alone can be soundly erected any structure of utility in any work, especially of production of any kind. And His Excellency has shown us, by the interest that he has taken and the efforts he has made for promoting the scientific side of agriculture, and providing a scientific staff for placing upon the most sound basis the great industries and productions of the Island, that His Excellency recognizes what a Society like this tries to teach\u2014what it was trying this evening and on all similar occasions to teach\u2014to the people of Ceylon, i.e., that only upon a thorough scientific study of the facts and the natural laws, that commerce and production and works of usefulness can be well conducted. (Applause.) We are very glad that His Excellency is amongst us on such an occasion, and that we should have such support. There are many times when our Papers deal with matters, the utilitarian tendency of which cannot easily be discovered. The Society exists in a great measure in order to keep before the minds of men that knowledge is valuable for its own sake. There are also times when the bearing of knowledge, scientific knowledge in particular, upon the practical needs of men and Governments come within our purview, and on such occasions we are extremely thankful to have the presence of our Governor. (Applause.)\n\nMr. S. M. Burrows said that, while he felt a strong sense of his unworthiness for the task, he congratulated himself on the honour done to him that night in his being asked to second the vote of thanks to His Excellency the Governor for being present that evening. He said that His Lordship and he had often met on various boards that arranged, no doubt adequately, for the instruction of others. It was strange that they should thus meet on an occasion when arrangements had been made, no doubt equally adequately, for the instruction of themselves. He came to the meeting that evening knowing about as much of the pearl oyster as he did of Chinese, and he went away feeling he could pass a very fair examination on the many scientific aspects of its study\u2014from the highly technical terms so glibly mentioned by Mr. Collett to the case of the \"oyster crossed in love\" so unexpectedly brought in by a later speaker, Mr. John Ferguson. He begged to second a very hearty vote of thanks to His Excellency for presiding, a distinction which had heightened the interest of the gathering that night.\n\nHis Excellency, in returning thanks, said:\u2014I am extremely obliged to you\u2014to you, my Lord, for the gracious terms in which you have proposed; to you, Mr. Burrows, for the kindly terms in which you have seconded; and to you, ladies and gentlemen, for the cordial manner in which you have passed this vote of thanks, which is in no way merited by me. It is great pleasure to me to be present at the Meetings of this Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and I only wish\nmy duties would permit me to attend more frequently. Perhaps, on occasions when you are having a learned and scientific discussion I might feel like a fish out of water; or, to use a more appropriate simile, an oyster off its bed. (Laughter.) But when this Society is assembled to discuss an unusually utilitarian question, how to conserve, how to protect, and how to advance one of our great industries, I feel more at home. Nevertheless, I must confess that it was with conflicting emotions that I learnt that the Paper to-day was regarding Oysters and how to conserve them. A poet of old\u2014Virgil, I believe (Mr. Burrows will correct me if I am wrong)\u2014said there is no one more bitter than a beautiful woman whose charms have been spurned. There is here no lady who has been in that unpleasant position; but my charms have been consistently spurned by the oyster since I assumed the administration of this Colony. (Laughter.) And yet no man was more kindly disposed to the oyster than I was when I landed here. (Renewed laughter.) I looked forward keenly to making his acquaintance, and anticipated the great advantage that would follow upon such intimacy. (Laughter.) Indeed, I may say that I built castles in the air\u2014at any rate, on his shells I built many a railway and many an irrigation scheme. (Laughter.) Unfortunately I have been persistently boycotted by the oyster. (Renewed laughter.) And now my feelings toward the oyster have greatly changed, and I begin to remember that he has always been hostile to me personally; that I have never taken an oyster that has not disagreed with me. (Loud laughter.) Altogether I begin to look upon the oyster as a capricious, deceitful fish or mollusc, or, as Mr. Haly expresses it, an \"invertebrate\" creature. (Laughter.) These being the feelings I entertain towards the oyster, when I was called upon to consider measures, not for its destruction, but for its conservancy, I was greatly perplexed. It is difficult for a just man to satisfy his own private vindictive feelings and do his duty as Governor of the Colony; but happily the difficulty no longer exists. Thanks to Mr. Collett, these conflicting feelings have been reconciled, because he tells us that the pearl is a pathological product; that is to say, only disease in the dying oyster can produce the pearl, and therefore what we call the conservancy of the oyster is only to produce those unhealthy conditions of life which will make it diseased or dying. Under those circumstances I am one with you all in your desire to conserve the oyster. (Laughter and applause.) Joking apart, I think this talk on our fisheries will not be without its advantages, if it has induced us to consider and reflect whether more scientific treatment, more scientific procedure, could not be adopted than that of two or three thousand years ago. Mr. Haly is not, but no doubt ought to be, a Member of the Legislative Council; if he had been, he would have known that that wise and sagacious and far-sighted entity\u2014the Hon. Treasurer, who is present, will bear me out in describing it as such\u2014the Government of Ceylon (laughter)\u2014has already taken up the matter, and has approached the Secretary of State, and through the\nSecretary of State the learned Societies and the learned Professors of these Societies, on this subject, and that from two learned Professors\u2014Professor Ray Lankester and Professor Herdman\u2014we have had two very valuable reports. Professor Ray Lankester, as is the way with some scientific men, has, to use a vulgar term, opened his mouth too wide. He has seen the opportunity of enriching the scientific world at the cost of Ceylon, and he has proposed a costly mission, which will no doubt collect much valuable information, which would not only be to our advantage, but to the advantage of all oyster-bearing countries. Therefore, I think, Mr. Ferguson\u2019s suggestion is a good one, that the cost of such a mission might be divided between those countries interested\u2014India, ourselves, and others\u2014but if such co-operation is not possible, then, I think, we might adopt a middle course, such as Mr. Ferguson also suggested, and get Professor Herdman, if he can spare his valuable time to come over here; and in collaboration with Captain Donnan, our great practical expert, they will be, I am sure, able to give us some very valuable information, especially regarding that interesting-question, the Life-History of the Oyster. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we must all feel very grateful to Mr. Collett for the very interesting Paper he has read. He said it was his zoological recreation; to us it has not only been a zoological recreation, but zoological instruction; and I think we are much indebted to him for this practical and useful discussion which has followed the reading of his Paper. I thank you again for the very kind way in which you have received it. (Applause.)\n\nThe Meeting terminated at 11.15 p.m.\n\n[Several \u201carticles and books\u201d connected with Pearl Fisheries were exhibited at the Meeting. A section of a pearl under a powerful microscope; a display of different kinds of oysters, including the largest \u201cmeleagrina\u201d from Australia; copies of Mr. Saville-Kent\u2019s large and profusely illustrated books and other literature on Pearl Oysters and Fisheries were laid on the table; a coir basket in which oysters are gathered, and the diving stone, were suspended from the roof.]\nThe design of the Society is to institute and promote inquiries into the History, Religions, Languages, Literature, Arts, and Social Condition of the present and former Inhabitants of the Island, with its Geology and Mineralogy, its Climate and Meteorology, its Botany and Zoology.\n\nCOLOMBO:\nH.

Announced the election of the following Members since the last General Meeting:\u2014\n\n(1) M. K. Bamber.\n(2) A. W. Andree.\n(3) W. E. Byles.\n\n3. The Honorary Secretary read the following\u2014\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1900.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report for the year 1900:\u2014\n\nMEETINGS.\n\nTwo General Meetings of the Society were held during the year. The Annual Meeting was held on February 13, 1900, when the Annual Report was read and adopted and Office-Bearers for the year were elected.\nA Meeting was held on October 26 under the presidency of His Excellency the Governor, Patron of the Society, at which Mr. O. Collett read a Paper on \"Pearl Oysters and Pearl Fisheries.\" A discussion of some importance followed the reading of the Paper; and the Council hope that it will tend to promote scientific inquiry into the working and conservation of the Ceylon Pearl Fisheries.\n\nBeside the above Paper, the following Papers (not read at Meetings) have been printed in the Society's Journal for 1900:\n\n(1) \"Christianity in Ceylon in 1630,\" by Mr. D. W. Ferguson.\n(2) \"Contributions to Ceylon Malacology,\" by Mr. O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n(3) \"Jo\u00e3o Rodriguez de S\u00e1 e Menezes,\" by Mr. D. W. Ferguson.\n\nMembers.\n\nDuring the past year five new Members were elected, viz., Messrs. A. Chinniah, R. B. Campbell, J. W. Robertson, W. A. D. J. Perera, and A. F. Mahn.\n\nOne Member resigned, viz., Mr. J. E. Pohath.\n\nThe Society now has on its roll 191 Members, including 22 Life Members and 10 Honorary Members.\n\nThe Council record with regret the death of the following Members:\u2014Messrs. K. L. M. Abdul Karim, J. Caderaman, M. I. M. Haniffa, and A. Van Starrex.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year numbered 258 volumes. The acquisitions are chiefly exchanges received from Societies. The Library is indebted for donations to\u2014The Royal Anthropological Society of Australasia; the Hamilton Association; the Government of India; Messrs. Tha Do Oung, M. V. Portman, Carlos P. Salas, F. H. de Vos; Dr. O. M. Obeyesekere; Mr. A. K. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my; Professor W. Geiger; Messrs. S. M. Burrows, H. Dharmapala, S. R. Salgado, H. M. Bhadkamkar, B.A., A. R. Fernando, and Albert Grunwedel.\n\nValuable exchanges have been received during the year from the following Societies, &c.:\n\nAnthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland; Asiatic Society of Bengal; Asiatic Society of Japan; Biji tot de Ta\u00e1l-Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie, The Hague; Anthropological Society of Bombay; Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Imperiale des Naturalistes de Moscou; Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Geological Society of London; American Oriental Society; the Trustees of the Indian Museum; the Geological Survey of Canada; Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; Bureau of Education, Washington; the Royal Society of Victoria; the Royal Society of New South Wales; Free Museum of Science and Art, Philadelphia; Field Columbian Museum, Chicago; the Smithsonian Institution; K.K. Naturhistorischen Hofmuseums, Vienna; Deutsche Morgenlandische Gessellschaft, Leipzig; Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, Batavia.\nThe Council still constantly receive applications from Institutions for exchanges of our Journal. The Council regret having had to refuse some exchanges during the year owing to the large number of Societies already on the exchange list.\n\nACCOMMODATION.\n\nThe Council again directed the attention of Government to the congested state of the Library, and the necessity for the Museum extension referred to in the Annual Reports of the Society for the last ten years. A reply was received from the Government stating that His Excellency the Governor \"shares the regret of the Council that other more urgent claims on public moneys have prevented the provision of funds for the extension of the Museum.\"\n\nThe need of relief for the overcrowded collections of books has been a crying want for a lengthy period, and the Council trust that the long-deferred extension of the Museum building will be shortly undertaken. Want of accommodation is seriously interfering with the development and progress of the Libraries of the Museum and Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and the collections of the Museum.\n\nJOURNALS.\n\nOne number of the Journal has been published during the year (Vol. XVI., No. 50, 1899). It contains, in addition to the Proceedings of the Council and General Meetings, the following Papers:\n\n(1) \"The Custom of Polyandry in Ceylon,\" by R. W. Ievers.\n(2) \"Antiquarian Discovery relating to the Portuguese in Ceylon,\" by G. A. Joseph.\n(3) \"A Letter from the King of Portugal to R\u00e1ja Sinha II.,\" by D. W. Ferguson.\n(4) \"Governor Van Eck's Expedition against the King of Kandy, 1765,\" translated from the Dutch by A. E. Buultjens, B.A.Cantab.\n(5) \"The Inscribed Mural Stone at the Maha Saman D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9, Ratnapura,\" by D. W. Ferguson.\n(6) \"Alagiyavanna Mohott\u00e1la, the Author of the 'Kusaj\u00e1taka K\u00e1vyaya,'\" by D. W. Ferguson.\n\nCOUNCIL.\n\nMr. F. M. Mackwood having been elected a Vice-President of the Society, his place on the Council was filled by the appointment of Mr. S. M. Burrows. Two Members of the Council of 1899, viz., Messrs. E. S. W. Sen\u00e1thi-R\u00e1j\u00e1 and J. P. Lewis, M.A., having been by virtue of Rule 16 deemed to have retired by least attendance, the vacancies caused by their retirement were filled by the appointment of Mr. E. E. Green, F.E.S., and Mr. E. Booth.\n\nARCH\u00c6OLOGICAL SURVEY OF CEYLON.\n\nIt is with feelings of satisfaction that the Council refer to the progress that has been made during the year in the systematic survey of the Arch\u00e6ological remains of the Island.\nARCH\u00c6OLOGY.\n\nThe Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner has, as in past years, again presented the Council, for its Annual Report, with a summary of the operations carried on by the Arch\u00e6ological Survey during the past year.\n\nExcavations.\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura.\u2014The greater part of the year was spent in completing excavations in the area lying mainly between Basawakkulam tank and the Ruwanv\u00e9li D\u00e1gaba. Particular attention was given to properly opening up to view the two finest vih\u00e1ras (wrongly termed \"pavilions\") and their attendant pirivenas, in this section, by the removal of the earth on all sides, widely, to a depth of 3 to 4 ft. This wholesale action was demanded in order to ensure the happy grouping of these picturesque shrines and their satellites being clearly comprehended. Displaced columns, capitals, &c., have been adjusted, so far as practicable without the aid of special gear. The general effect of these compact, well-balanced, ruin clusters has been markedly improved.\n\nExcavation at the base of El\u00e1la Sohona, on the Kurun\u00e9gala road, was re-commenced during the dry months, and may be yearly continued until the broad cuttings on the north and east are united by a trench skirting the north-east quadrant of this circular ruin. The soil is being utilized gradually in filling up unsightly and pestilential ponds and low ground in the town.\n\nSome very desirable finishing work was done towards making the interesting regularly planned monastery at Band\u00e1ra Puliyankulam more conspicuous and easier of access from the two roads which pass it\u2014the high road to Jaffna and \"MacBride's Deviation.\" Forest trees have been freely thinned out, the stone-slab retaining wall of the quadrangle built afresh from the north portico to that on the east, the d\u00e1gaba basement restored, and the whole of the ground on the north-east as far as the road cut down to its former level.\n\nTo the west of the Jaffna road trial pits were dug in the unexplored raised site, upon which stands a single stone-pillared ruin of no importance. At a depth of 12 to 15 ft. a strange and hitherto unrecorded series of structures was come upon\u2014mere vertical crusts of brickwork, varying in shape and dimensions, and practically empty. Great antiquity is indicated by the exceptional size of the bricks and the thickness of the soil strata above these \"shells.\" Possibly they may have been kilns, where bricks for the larger d\u00e1gabas at Anur\u00e1dhapura were burnt.\n\nSigiriya.\u2014The annual clearing of the ruins, grass-covered and rain-worn, on the summit of Sigiri-gala and the terraces below it, was carried out in 1900. This precaution is essentially necessary, year by year, to preserve the excavated ruins in even fair condition, owing to their fragile nature and exposed position.\n\nLater, the gang got rid of a good portion of the detritus beneath which lie buried the minor terraces on the western slope of the \"half way\" maluva projecting from the Great Rock northwards.\n\nA set of monks' cells, &c., was thus laid bare immediately south of the so-called \"Prison Rock.\"\n\nSteady progress has been made in the rebuilding of the floor and the outer wall of the gallery at the north-west corner of the Rock, where it had long disappeared in whole or in part.\nFurther, the first length of an iron bridge, rock-held, to connect the west face gallery with what remains on the north, was fixed in position. Another season should see all the exceedingly difficult and break-neck work on this part of the gallery well nigh completed.\n\nPolonnaruwa.\u2014The Archaeological Survey started work at Polonnaruwa in May, 1900, and closed its first season there at the end of September. Proceeding from the outset systematically, as at Anuradhapura, excavations were concentrated during the four and half months at one point\u2014the ruins situated on the extensive promontory overlooking the tank (Topavewa). These ruins comprise\u2014\n\n(a) The \"Council Chamber,\" a building with massive stone pillars standing upon a lofty platform, stone-faced.\n\n(b) The \"Audience Hall,\" or \"Court of Justice,\" a large building of brick and mortar, stucco-plastered, and one-storied at its western end.\n\n(c) A \"Mausoleum\" (?), storied, brick-built, and ornamented with stucco-mouldings picked out in colours.\n\n(d) A \"Pavilion,\" partially walled, and floored in plaster, with short stone piers, from which an upper wooden storey may have risen. This building stood on an artificially constructed mound within the tank, but was formerly joined to the promontory bund and the buildings clustered west of (a), (b), (c) by a bridge.\n\n(e) The walls of buildings connected with some irrigation work lying immediately below the tank, and once fed from it by a sluice now blocked.\n\n(f) A pillared building, and brick-strewn mound, close to the Irrigation Bungalow on the tank bund.\n\nThe form and object of the ruins at these last-named sites (e,f) have yet to be ascertained by excavation.\n\nThe ancient city lies still for the most part buried in jungle, which is now being steadily cleared. Its main streets are well defined to this day, no less than its structures, and both can be laid down on a plan with absolute certainty; for the modern builder has not yet played havoc with the ruins of \"Pulastipura.\"\n\nEpigraphical.\u2014The first volume of the Epigraphia Zeylanica is in the hands of Mr. Don M. de Z. Wickremasingha being prepared for the press.\n\nFINANCES.\n\nThe Treasurership last year was undertaken by Mr. H. O. Barnard. The balance sheet annexed shows a satisfactory balance of Rs. 1,856-96, which, however, has since been somewhat reduced by the payment of outstanding accounts. Mr. E. Booth has been good enough to perform the duty of auditing the accounts.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nThe Council regret to report some falling off in the number of suitable Papers contributed by the Members of the Society. There is much ground still unbroken in the History and Archaeology of this Island (especially in the identification of ancient sites) and in the working out of the philological affinities of the Sinhalese language. The Council hope that more Members of the Society will contribute in the form of Papers the results of such researches as they are able to make into these, or other subjects, which come within the scope of the Society's objects.\nThe Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch.\u2014Statement of Accounts for the Year 1900.\n\n**Receipts.**\n\n| Rs. c. | Rs. c. |\n|--------|--------|\n| Balance brought forward | 1,603 2 |\n| Entrance Fees | 15 75 |\n| Annual Subscriptions:\u2014 | |\n| 1897 | |\n| 1898 | |\n| 1899 | |\n| 1900 | |\n| 1901 | |\n| Government grants | |\n| Sale of Journals Due to Honorary Treasurer | |\n\n**Expenditure.**\n\n| Rs. c. |\n|--------|\n| Books account | 249 17 |\n| Charges account | 296 27\u00bd |\n| Establishment | 270 0 |\n| Printing and Binding | 210 94 |\n| Due by Messrs.

His Lordship the Bishop said he had to thank them for the honour done him and the other Office-Bearers. He wished to speak on behalf of the others rather than of himself, because when he thought of those Office-Bearers he could, without shame or misgiving, speak for them, and feel that, in electing them, they had not made a mistake. (Laughter.) The labour of a Society like that fell upon the Secretaries and Treasurer, and in a greater or smaller degree upon others, and least of all perhaps upon the President. He could assure the Members of the Society that to their Secretaries and Treasurer, Mr. Roles, they were all very much indebted. (Hear, hear.) The pains which those gentlemen took in their work was beyond all praise. The Report read that evening showed how very large a part was still borne in the affairs of the Society by one who was absent and at a distance. He referred to Mr. H. C. P. Bell. A large part of that most interesting Report was prepared by him. Even in Mr. Harward's presence he could not restrain himself from thanking him for his devoted services and for the interest, amidst heavy calls upon his time, which he took in the Society. He always looked with fear upon the Annual Meeting, because he had one of two things to do: he had either to deliver his annual address, when he had one; or to say he had no address to deliver. (Laughter.) He would rather stand and deliver an address; but on the present occasion he had none; and he thought that was because they were re-electing one who discharged his services so inadequately. (No, no.) It was for them to put into his place some one who had not already said to them the little he knew, or whose studies were in such directions as would furnish him with something worthy to be laid before the Society. His studies for a long time had not furnished him with anything to lay before the Society, nor had he time to study current literature enough to give them a review of what\nhad been done during the year, which would, in some respects, be a suitable substitute for any original matter. He could only ask the Society to keep their eyes open, and put forward on a future occasion some one who would be able to serve them better and render something beyond thanks for the honour done him. He heartily thanked them for the honour done him. (Applause.)\n\n7. Mr. F. H. Price said he found himself in the unenviable position of disagreeing with what the President had just said. His Lordship had disclaimed the fair share of the support he gave the Society and the interest he took in it; but if it were not for His Lordship's assistance and interest the Society would not be what it now was. (Hear, hear.) In the presence of His Lordship he would not say what they all felt. They knew what His Lordship had done, and he was sure a vote of thanks to His Lordship would be carried with acclamation.\n\nMr. S. M. Burrows, in seconding, said that His Lordship bore up the Society as Atlas held up the world. They admired His Lordship's pose and applauded the athletic feat of their intellectual giant. (Laughter.)\n\nThe vote was carried with acclamation, and the proceedings ended.\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, September 30, 1901.\n\nPresent:\n\nMr. F. M.

Lewis forwarding a specimen page of a proposed \"Catalogue of Ceylon Timber Trees.\"\n\nA question was raised by Mr. Ferguson whether the Catalogue could be made to apply to the whole Island. Mr. Lewis (who happened to be at the Museum) was invited to answer this and other questions.

H. de Vos, Barrister-at-Law.\n\nFURTHER information, collected since the publication of the \"Monumental Remains of the Dutch East India Company in Ceylon,\" has suggested the desirability of a Supplementary Paper. All inscriptions in Dutch on old plate, medals, gateways, &c., that I have been able to discover in Ceylon are included in this Paper.

Navorscher, 249.)\n\nPlate 14, L.Z., Colombo.\n\nThere is no connection between the two epitaphs in Plate 14, L.Z., although, being placed as they are, one would think there was.\n\nCornelis van der Parra was the son of Rombout van der Parra, Dissave of Colombo, and Maria Strick.

It is supposed to have been placed by a Doctor Stutzer, whose son, an Ensign in one of the Ceylon Regiments under the British, was shot through the heart by an arrow while leading a reconnaissance into a defile during the first invasion of the Kandyan territory by the British. The correspondent says that he remembers the three daughters of the old Doctor. One married Captain Thompson of the 16th Regiment, and another Colonel Thomas Cockrane of the Ceylon Rifles.\n\nThere were, I find, in Ceylon, a J. S.

They had a son, Johan Theodore, born 19th August, 1603, Burgomaster of Dinsberg, who married Christina Holtmans, and had issue, a son, Johannes Willem, who married Willemina de Battem. The tenth child of this marriage was Rudolp, who married Theodora Krayenhoff, and had an only daughter, Johanna Wilhelmina Muntz, who died on the 22nd April, 1769, having married (1) Gerhardus Beylanus de Wendt, Brigadier, Batavia; and (2) 20th August, 1768, Werner Willem Muntz. The plate must therefore have belonged to the Brigadier. The wife of Governor Falck was Theodora Rudolphina de Wendt, of Batavia, a daughter of the Brigadier, and this fact explains the presence of the plate in Ceylon.\n\nTheodora Rudolphina de Wendt married, as widow Falck, in Colombo on the 26th October, 1785, Major Elias Paravicinni de Capelle, of Breda, the widower of Johanna van der Pool.\n\nSir Archibald Lawrie has several plates with the van de Graaff arms on them (see Plate 13, L.Z., Colombo) as depicted in the Lapidarium Zeylanicum, with the addition of two lions as supporters. The shield is surmounted by a ducal coronet.\n31\u2014Colombo.\n\nAn inscription on a silver tray in the possession of Mr. P.
