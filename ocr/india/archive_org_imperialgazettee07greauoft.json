Nor has it been thought necessary to mark vowels as long in cases where mistakes in pronunciation were not likely to be made.\n\nConsonants\n\nMost Indian languages have different forms for a number of consonants, such as d, t, r, &c., marked in scientific works by the use of dots or italics. As the European ear distinguishes these with difficulty in ordinary pronunciation, it has been considered undesirable to embarrass the reader with them; and only two notes are required. In the first place, the Arabic k, a strong guttural, has been represented by k instead of q, which is often used. Secondly, it should be remarked that aspirated consonants are common; and, in particular, dh and th (except in Burma) never have the sound of th in 'this' or 'thin,' but should be pronounced as in 'woodhouse' and 'boathook.'\nBurmese Words\n\nBurmese and some of the languages on the frontier of China have the following special sounds:\n\naw has the vowel-sound in 'law.'\n\u00f6 and \u00fc are pronounced as in German.\ngy is pronounced almost like j in 'jewel.'\nky is pronounced almost like ch in 'church.'\nth is pronounced in some cases as in 'this,' in some cases as in 'thin.'\nw after a consonant has the force of u. Thus, ywa and puwe are disyllables, pronounced as if written yuwa and puwe.\n\nIt should also be noted that, whereas in Indian words the accent or stress is distributed almost equally on each syllable, in Burmese there is a tendency to throw special stress on the last syllable.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe names of some places\u2014e.g. Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Cawnpore\u2014have obtained a popular fixity of spelling, while special forms have been officially prescribed for others. Names of persons are often spelt and pronounced differently in different parts of India; but the variations have been made as few as possible by assimilating forms almost alike, especially where a particular spelling has been generally adopted in English books.\n\nNotes on Money, Prices, Weights and Measures\n\nAs the currency of India is based upon the rupee, all statements with regard to money throughout the Gazetteer have necessarily been expressed in rupees, nor has it been found possible to add generally a conversion into sterling. Down to about 1873 the gold value of the rupee (containing 165 grains of pure silver) was approximately equal to 2s., or one-tenth of a \u00a3; and for that period it is easy to convert rupees into sterling by striking off the final cipher (Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100). But after 1873, owing to the depreciation of silver as compared with gold throughout the world, there came a serious and progressive fall in the exchange, until at one time the gold value of the rupee dropped as low as 1s. In order to provide a remedy for the heavy loss caused to the Government of India in respect of its gold payments to be made in England, and also to relieve foreign trade and finance from the inconvenience due to constant and unforeseen fluctuations in exchange, it was resolved in 1893 to close the mints to the free coinage of silver, and thus force up the value of the rupee by restricting the circulation. The intention was to raise\nthe exchange value of the rupee to 1s. 4d., and then introduce a gold standard (though not necessarily a gold currency) at the rate of Rs. 15 = \u00a31. This policy has been completely successful. From 1899 onwards the value of the rupee has been maintained, with insignificant fluctuations, at the proposed rate of 1s. 4d.; and consequently since that date three rupees have been equivalent to two rupees before 1873.\n\nFor the intermediate period, between 1873 and 1899, it is manifestly impossible to adopt any fixed sterling value for a constantly changing rupee. But since 1899, if it is desired to convert rupees into sterling, not only must the final cipher be struck off (as before 1873), but also one-third must be subtracted from the result. Thus Rs. 1,000 = \u00a3100 - $\\frac{1}{3}$ = (about) \u00a367.\n\nAnother matter in connexion with the expression of money statements in terms of rupees requires to be explained. The method of numerical notation in India differs from that which prevails throughout Europe. Large numbers are not punctuated in hundreds of thousands and millions, but in lakhs and crores. A lakh is one hundred thousand (written out as 1,00,000), and a crore is one hundred lakhs or ten millions (written out as 1,00,00,000). Consequently, according to the exchange value of the rupee, a lakh of rupees (Rs. 1,00,000) may be read as the equivalent of \u00a310,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a36,667 after 1899; while a crore of rupees (Rs. 1,00,00,000) may similarly be read as the equivalent of \u00a31,00,00,000 before 1873, and as the equivalent of (about) \u00a3666,667 after 1899.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the rupee is divided into 16 annas, a fraction commonly used for many purposes by both natives and Europeans. The anna was formerly reckoned as 1$\\frac{1}{2}$d.; it may now be considered as exactly corresponding to 1d. The anna is again subdivided into 12 pies.\n\nThe various systems of weights used in India combine uniformity of scale with immense variations in the weight of units. The scale used generally throughout Northern India, and less commonly in Madras and Bombay, may be thus expressed: one maund = 40 seers; one seer = 16 chittaks or 80 tolas. The actual weight of a seer varies greatly from District to District, and even from village to village; but in the standard system the tola is 180 grains Troy (the exact weight of the rupee), and the seer thus weighs 2\u00b7057 lb., and the maund 82\u00b728 lb. This standard is used in official reports and throughout the Gazetteer.\n\nFor calculating retail prices, the universal custom in India is to express them in terms of seers to the rupee. Thus, when prices change, what varies is not the amount of money to be paid for the\nsame quantity, but the quantity to be obtained for the same amount of money. In other words, prices in India are quantity prices, not money prices. When the figure of quantity goes up, this of course means that the price has gone down, which is at first sight perplexing to an English reader. It may, however, be mentioned that quantity prices are not altogether unknown in England, especially at small shops, where pennyworths of many groceries can be bought. Eggs, likewise, are commonly sold at a varying number for the shilling.\n\nIf it be desired to convert quantity prices from Indian into English denominations without having recourse to money prices (which would often be misleading), the following scale may be adopted\u2014based upon the assumptions that a seer is exactly 2 lb., and that the value of the rupee remains constant at 1s. 4d.: 1 seer per rupee = (about) 3 lb. for 2s.; 2 seers per rupee = (about) 6 lb. for 2s.; and so on.\n\nThe name of the unit for square measurement in India generally is the bigha, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. But areas have always been expressed throughout the Gazetteer either in square miles or in acres.\n\nMAPS\n\nBaroda . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . to face p. 64\nBengal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \" 336\nBerar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . at end\nBareilly Division.\u2014North-central Division of the United Provinces, lying below the Him\u0101layas between $27^\\circ 35'$ and $29^\\circ 58'$ N. and $78^\\circ$ and $80^\\circ 27'$ E. It is bounded on the north by the sub-Him\u0101layan tract of the Kumaun Division and by Nep\u0101l; on the west and south by the Ganges, which divides it from the Meerut and Agra Divisions; and on the east by the Lucknow Division of Oudh. The R\u0101mpur State forms a wedge of territory between the Districts of Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d and Bareilly, and political control is exercised by the Commissioner of this Division, whose head-quarters are at Bareilly city. Population decreased between 1872 and 1881, but has increased considerably since. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 5,252,325, (1881) 5,122,557, (1891) 5,344,954, and (1901) 5,479,688. The total area is 10,720 square miles, and the density of population 511 persons per square mile, compared with 445 for the Provinces as a whole. The Division is the sixth largest in area and the sixth in population in the United Provinces. In 1901 Hindus formed nearly 75 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns 24 per cent., while the other religions most largely represented were Christians (24,459, of whom 21,421 were natives), Aryas (14,993), Sikhs (3,334), and Jains (2,016). The Division includes six Districts, as shown below:\n\n| District       | Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bareilly      | 1,580                | 1,090,117        | 17,47                                                  |\n| Bijnor        | 1,791                | 779,951          | 16,63                                                  |\n| Budaun        | 1,987                | 1,025,753        | 14,98                                                  |\n| Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d     | 2,285                | 1,191,993        | 17,38                                                  |\n| Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur  | 1,727                | 921,535          | 13,40                                                  |\n| Pilibhit      | 1,350                | 479,339          | 8,39                                                   |\n| **Total**     | **10,720**           | **5,479,688**    | **88,25**                                              |\n\nThe northern portions of each of these Districts, except Budaun, reach to the damp submontane area called the tarai, and the Division\ngenerally is a fertile tract, especially noted for the production of sugar-cane. There are 65 towns and 11,403 villages. The largest towns are Bareilly (131,208, with cantonments), Shahjahanpur (76,458, with cantonments), Moradabad (75,128), Amroha (40,077), Sambhal (39,715), Budaun (39,031), Pilibhit (33,490), Chandausi (25,711), and Nagina (21,412). The chief places of commercial importance are Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Moradabad, Pilibhit, Chandausi, and Tilhar. Sugar and grain are dealt with also in many smaller places. Although ancient sites occur in many parts of the Division, Ramnagar is the only one which has been even partially explored. Budaun and Sambhal were early seats of Muhammadan governors; and Bareilly, Pilibhit, Rampur, and Aonla were important centres during the Rohilla rule in the eighteenth century. See Rohilkhand.\n\nBareilly District (Bareli).\u2014District in the Bareilly or Rohilkhand Division, United Provinces, lying between 28\u00b0 1' and 28\u00b0 54' N. and 78\u00b0 58' and 79\u00b0 47' E., with an area of 1,580 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Naini Tal; on the east by Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur; on the south by Shahjahanpur and Budaun; and on the west by Budaun and the State of Rampur. The District of Bareilly, though lying not far from the outer ranges of the Himayalayas, is a gently sloping plain, with no greater variety of surface than is caused by the shifting channels of its numerous streams. Water lies almost everywhere near the surface, giving it a verdure that recalls the rice-fields of Bengal. The most prominent physical feature is the Ranganga River, which traverses the south-western portion. Its channel has a well-defined bank at first on the south, and later on the north; but except where the stream is thus confined, the khadar or lowland merges imperceptibly into the upland, and the river varies its course capriciously through a valley 4 or 5 miles wide, occasionally wandering to a still greater distance. North of the Ranganga are numerous streams running south to meet that river. The chief of these (from west to east) are the Dojor\u0101, which receives the Kichh\u0101 or West Bahgul, the Deorani\u0101n, the Nakati\u0101, and the East Bahgul, which receives the Pangail\u012b. The Deoh\u0101 forms the eastern boundary for some distance. The gentle slope of the country makes it possible to use these rivers for irrigation in the upper part of their courses. Lower down, and more especially in the east of the District, they flow below the general level and are divided by elevated watersheds of sandy plains.\n\nThe District exposes nothing but alluvium, in which even kankar, or calcareous limestone, is scarce.\n\nThe flora resembles that of the Gangetic plain generally. In the north a few forest trees are found, the semal or cotton-tree (Bombax malabaricum) towering above all others. The rest of the District is\ndotted with fine groves of mangoes, while the j\u0101mun (*Eugenia Jambolana*), shisham (*Dalbergia Sissoo*), tamarind, and various figs (*Ficus glomerata*, *religiosa*, *infectoria*, and *indica*) are also common. Groves and villages are often surrounded by bamboos, which flourish luxuriantly. The area under trees, which is increasing, amounts to about 32 square miles.\n\nLeopards are frequently found in the north of the District, and wolves are common in the east. Antelope are seen in some localities, and p\u0101rha or hog deer haunt the beds of rivers. The ordinary game-birds are found abundantly, and fish are plentiful. Snakes are also very numerous.\n\nThe climate of the District is largely influenced by its proximity to the hills, Bareilly city and all the northern *parganas* lying within the limits of the heavier storms. The rainy season begins earlier and continues later than in the south, and the cold season lasts longer. The north of the District is unhealthy, on account of excessive moisture and bad drinking-water. The mean temperature varies from $54^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$ in January, and from $85^\\circ$ to $93^\\circ$ in May, the hottest month.\n\nThe annual rainfall in the whole District averages nearly 44 inches; but while the south-west receives only 39, the fall amounts to nearly 47 inches in the north and exceeds 48 in the north-east. Fluctuations from year to year are considerable; in 1883 less than 19 inches was received, and in 1894 nearly 65 inches.\n\nBefore the Christian era the District was included in the kingdom of Northern Panch\u0101la; and the names are known, from coins found at R\u0101mnagar, of a number of kings who probably reigned in the second century B.C. These kings were connected by marriage with a dynasty ruling in the south of Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and it has been suggested they were the Sunga kings of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as\\(^1\\). A kingdom called Ahichhatra, in or near this District, was visited by Hiuen Tsiang in the seventh century A.D., and is described as flanked by mountain crags. It produced wheat and contained many woods and fountains, and the climate was soft and agreeable.\n\nIn the early Muhammadan period the tract now known as Rohilkhand was called Katehr, and the R\u0101jputs who inhabited it gave continual trouble. Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn, or his general Kutb-ud-d\u012bn, captured Bangarh in Budaun District about the year 1194; but nothing more is heard of the Muhammadans in this neighbourhood till Mahm\u016bd II made his way along the foot of the hills to the R\u0101mgang\u0101 in 1252. Fourteen years later, Balban, who succeeded him, marched to Kampil, put all the Hindus to the sword, and utterly crushed the Katehriy\u0101s, who had hitherto lived by violence and plunder. In 1290 Sult\u0101n F\u012broz invaded\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal*, 1897, p. 303; A. Cunningham, *Coins of Ancient India*.\nKatehr again, and brought the country into final subjection to Musalm\u0101n rule, which was not afterwards disputed except by the usual local revolts. Under the various dynasties which preceded the Mughal empire, the history of Katehr consists of the common events which make up the annals of that period: constant attempts at independence on the part of the district governors, followed by barbarous suppression on the part of the central authority. The city of Bareilly itself was founded in 1527 by B\u0101s Deo and Barel Deo, from the latter of whom it takes its name. It was, however, of small importance till the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, when it took the place of Budaun. In 1628 Ali Kuli Kh\u0101n was governor of Bareilly, which had grown into a considerable place. In 1657 R\u0101j\u0101 Makrand Rai founded the new city of Bareilly, cut down the forest to the west of the old town, and expelled all the Katehriy\u0101s from the neighbourhood. A succession of regular governors followed during the palmy days of the great Mughal emperors; but after the death of Aurangzeb, in 1707, when the unwieldy organization began to break asunder, the Hindus of Bareilly threw off the imperial yoke, refused their tribute, and commenced a series of anarchic quarrels among themselves for supremacy.\n\nTheir dissensions only afforded an opportunity for the rise of a new Muhammadan power. Ali Muhammad Kh\u0101n, a leader of Rohilla Path\u0101ns, defeated the governors of Bareilly and Mor\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d, and made himself supreme throughout the whole Katehr region. In 1744 the Rohilla chieftain conquered Kumaun right up to Almor\u0101; but two years later the emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h marched against him, and Ali Muhammad was taken a prisoner to Delhi. However, the empire was too much in need of vigorous generals to make his captivity a long one, and in 1748 he was restored to his old post in Katehr. Next year he died, and a mausoleum at Aonla, in this District, still marks his burial-place. H\u0101fiz Rahmat Kh\u0101n, guardian to his sons, succeeded to the governorship of Rohilkhand, in spite of the crafty designs of Safdar Jang of Oudh, who dispatched the Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d against him without effect. H\u0101fiz Rahmat Kh\u0101n defeated and slew the Naw\u0101b, after which he marched northward and conquered Pilibh\u012bt and the tarai. The Oudh Waz\u012br, Safdar Jang, plundered the property of the Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d Naw\u0101b after his death, and this led to a union of the Rohilla Afgh\u0101ns with those of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d. Ahmad Kh\u0101n of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d defeated Nawal Rai, the deputy of Safdar Jang, besieged Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and took part of Oudh; but the Waz\u012br called in the aid of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and with them defeated Ahmad Kh\u0101n and the Rohillas at Fatehgarh and at Bisauli, near Aonla. He then besieged them for four months at the foot of the hills; but owing to the invasion of Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b terms were arranged, and Rahmat Kh\u0101n became the de facto ruler of Rohilkhand.\nAfter the accession of Shuj\u0101-ud-daula as Naw\u0101b of Oudh, Rahmat Kh\u0101n joined the imperial troops in their attack upon that prince, but the Naw\u0101b bought them off with a subsidy of 5 lakhs. Rahmat Kh\u0101n took advantage of the victory at P\u0101npat in 1761 to make himself master of Et\u0101wah, and during the eventful years in which Shuj\u0101-ud-daula was engaged in his struggle with the British power, he continually strengthened himself by fortifying his towns and founding new strongholds. In 1770 Najib-ud-daula advanced with the Mar\u0101th\u0101 army under Sindhia and Holkar, defeated Rahmat Kh\u0101n, and forced the Rohillas to ask the aid of the Waz\u012br. Shuj\u0101-ud-daula became surety for a bond of 40 lakhs, by which the Mar\u0101th\u0101s were induced to evacuate Rohilkhand. This bond the Rohillas were unable to meet, whereupon Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, after getting rid of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, attacked Rohilkhand with the help of a British force lent by Warren Hastings, and subjugated it by a desolating war. Rahmat Kh\u0101n was slain, but Faiz-ullah, the son of Ali Muhammad, escaped to the north-west and became the leader of the Rohillas. After many negotiations he effected a treaty with Shuj\u0101-ud-daula in 1774, by which he accepted nine parganas worth 15 lakhs a year, giving up all the remainder of Rohilkhand to the Waz\u012br (see R\u0101mpur State). Sa\u0101dat Ali was appointed governor of Bareilly under the Oudh government. In 1794 a revolution in R\u0101mpur State led to the dispatch of British troops, who fought the insurgents at Bhitura or Fatehganj (West), where an obelisk still commemorates the slain. The District remained in the hands of the Waz\u012br until 1801, when Rohilkhand, with Allah\u0101b\u0101d and Kor\u0101, was ceded to the British in lieu of tribute. Mr. Henry Wellesley, brother of the Governor-General, was appointed President of the Board of Commissioners sitting at Bareilly, and afterwards at Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d. In 1805 Amir Kh\u0101n, the Pind\u0101ri, made an inroad into Rohilkhand, but was driven off. Disturbances occurred in 1816, in 1837, and in 1842; but the peace of the District was not seriously endangered until the Mutiny of 1857.\n\nIn that year the troops at Bareilly rose on May 31. The European officers, except three, escaped to Nain\u012b T\u0101l; and Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, H\u0101fiz Rahmat Kh\u0101n's grandson, was proclaimed Naw\u0101b N\u0101zim of Rohilkhand. On June 11 the mutinous soldiery went off to Delhi, and Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur organized a government in July. Three expeditions attempted to attack Nain\u012b T\u0101l, but without success. In September came news of the fall of Delhi. Walid\u0101d Kh\u0101n, the rebel leader in Bulandshahr, and the Naw\u0101b of Fatehgarh then took refuge at Bareilly. A fourth expedition against Nain\u012b T\u0101l met with no greater success than the earlier attempts. On March 25, 1858, the N\u0101na S\u0101hib arrived at Bareilly on his flight from Oudh, and remained till the end of April; but the rebellion at Bareilly had been a revival of Muhammadan rule, and when the commander-in-chief marched on Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, the N\u0101na S\u0101hib fled back again\ninto Oudh. On the fall of Lucknow, Firoz Shah retired to Bareilly, and took Moradabad on April 22, but was compelled to give it up at once. The Nawab of Najibabad, leader of the Bijnor rebels, joined him in the city, so that the principal insurgents were congregated together in Bareilly when the English army arrived on May 5. The city was taken on May 7, and all the chiefs fled with Khan Bahadur into Oudh.\n\nAhichhatra or Ramnagar is the only one of many ancient mounds in the District which has been explored. It yielded numerous coins and some Buddhist sculptures. It is still a sacred place of the Jains. The period of Rohilla rule has left few buildings of importance; but some tombs and mosques are standing at Aonla and Bareilly.\n\nThere are 12 towns and 1,924 villages. Population has risen steadily during the last thirty years. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 1,015,041, (1881) 1,030,936, (1891) 1,040,949, and (1901) 1,090,117.\n\nThe District is divided into six tahsils\u2014Faridpur, Bareilly, Aonla, Mirganj, Baheri, and Nawabganj\u2014the head-quarters of each being at a place of the same name. The principal towns are the municipality of Bareilly and Aonla. The following table gives the chief statistics of area and population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Faridpur   | 249                 | 2               | 314      | 128,861    | 518                       | + 7.6                                                        | 2,635                                  |\n| Bareilly   | 310                 | 1               | 414      | 325,650    | 1,050                     | + 9.1                                                        | 17,111                                 |\n| Aonla      | 306                 | 3               | 320      | 211,836    | 692                       | + 8.1                                                        | 4,913                                  |\n| Mirganj    | 149                 | 1               | 158      | 103,198    | 640                       | + 8.3                                                        | 1,225                                  |\n| Baheri     | 345                 | 2               | 410      | 193,412    | 561                       | - 6.6                                                        | 2,522                                  |\n| Nawabganj  | 221                 | 3               | 308      | 127,160    | 575                       | + 2.2                                                        | 1,404                                  |\n| District total | 1,580             | 12              | 1,924    | 1,090,117  | 690                       | + 4.7                                                        | 29,810                                 |\n\nHindus form 75 per cent. of the total and Musalmans 24 per cent., while Christians number 7,148 and Aryas 1,228. The density is much higher than the Provincial average, and the rate of increase between 1891 and 1901 was larger than in most parts of the United Provinces. More than 99 per cent. of the population speak Western Hindi, the ordinary dialect being Braj.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu caste is that of Chamars (leather-workers and cultivators), 100,000. Other castes numerically strong in this District are: Kurnois (agriculturists), 94,000; Muraos (market-gardeners), 73,000; Kisains (cultivators), 67,000; and Kahars (cultivators and water-carriers), 56,000. Brahmins number 48,000 and Rajputs 38,000. Ahars, who are found only in Rohilkhand, but are closely allied to the\nAhirs of the rest of the Provinces, number 46,000. Daleras (1,724), who are nominally basket-makers but in reality thieves, are not found outside this District. Among Muhammadans, Shaikhs number 54,000; Julahas (weavers), 41,000; and Pathans, 41,000. The Mewatis, who number 9,000, came from Mewat in the eighteenth century, owing to famine. Banjaras, who were formerly army sutlers and are still grain-carriers, have now settled down to agriculture, chiefly in the submontane Districts, and number 9,000 here. About 66 per cent. of the population are supported by agriculture, 6 per cent. by personal services, and 4 per cent. by general labour. Cotton-weaving by hand supports 3.5 per cent. Rajputs, Pathans, Brahmins, Kayasths, and Baniyas are the largest landholders. Kurmis occupy nearly a quarter of the total area as cultivators, while Ahars, Kisans, and Brahmins each cultivate about 7 or 8 per cent.\n\nThere were 4,600 native Christians in 1901, of whom 4,488 were Methodists. The American Methodist Episcopal Mission was opened here in 1859, and has ten stations in the District, besides a theological college at Bareilly city.\n\nThe north of the District contains a damp unhealthy tract, where rent rates are low and population is sparse, while cultivation depends largely on the season. The central portion is extremely fertile, consisting chiefly of loam, with a considerable proportion of clay in the Mrganj and Nawabganj tahsils. In the south, watersheds of sandy soil divide the rivers; but these sandy strips are regularly cultivated in the Bareilly and Aonla tahsils, while in Faridpur much of the light soil is very poor and liable to be thrown out of cultivation after heavy rain. The alluvial strip along the Ramganga is generally rich, but is occasionally ruined by a deposit of sand. Excluding garden cultivation, manure is applied only when the turn comes round for sugar-cane to be grown, at intervals of from 3 to 8 years.\n\nThe tenures are those common to the United Provinces. Zamindari or joint zamindari tenures prevail in 5,547 mahals, 503 are perfect or imperfect pattidari, and 36 are bhatiyachara. The District is thus chiefly held by large proprietors. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown in the table on the next page, in square miles.\n\nThe principal food-crops, with their areas in square miles in 1903-4, are: rice (237), wheat (368), gram (201), bijra (166), and maize (115). Sugar-cane covers 71 square miles, and is one of the most important products; while poppy (23), oilseeds (27), cotton (13), and san-hemp (10) are also valuable crops.\n\nThe total cultivated area has not varied much during the last thirty years; but there has been a permanent increase to the west of Aonla and north of Faridpur tahsils, which is counterbalanced by a temporary\ndecrease in the north of the District owing to vicissitudes of the seasons. The principal changes in cultivation have been directed towards the substitution of more valuable crops for inferior staples. The area under bajra has decreased, while sugar-cane, rice, and maize are more largely grown. Poppy has been reintroduced recently, and the area sown with it is increasing. A rise in the area producing barley and gram points to an increase in the area double cropped. Very few loans are taken under the Land Improvement Loans Act; between 1890 and 1903 the total amounted to Rs. 41,000, of which Rs. 38,000 was advanced in the famine year, 1896\u20137. Nearly 1\u00bd lakhs was lent under the Agriculturists' Loans Act, of which Rs. 63,000 was advanced in 1896\u20137. In good seasons the advances are small.\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Faridpur | 249   | 196        | 34        | 19              |\n| Bareilly | 310   | 240        | 50        | 20              |\n| Aonla    | 306   | 240        | 56        | 27              |\n| Mirganj  | 149   | 111        | 17        | 14              |\n| Baheri   | 315   | 258        | 44        | 31              |\n| Nawabganj| 221   | 178        | 55        | 12              |\n| **Total**| **1,580** | **1,223** | **256**   | **123**         |\n\nThe cattle used for agricultural purposes are chiefly bred in the District or imported from the neighbouring submontane tracts, those bred in Pilibhit being called panw\u0101r. These varieties are small but active, and suffice for the shallow ploughing in vogue. Stronger animals, used in the well-run in the south-west of the District, are imported from west of the Jumna. Horse-breeding is confined to the R\u0101mgang\u0101 and Aril basins, where wide stretches of grass and in some places a species of Oxalis resembling clover are found. Four pony and two donkey stallions are maintained by Government and by the District board, and two donkey stallions are kept on estates under the Court of Wards to encourage mule-breeding. There has, however, been little progress in either horse or mule-breeding. Sheep are not kept to any great extent.\n\nThe soil of the District is generally moist, and in ordinary seasons there is very little demand for irrigation of the spring crops. In the north, where a regular supply of water is valued for rice and sugar-cane, the Rohilkhand canals are the main source. Elsewhere, wells, rivers, and jhils are used. In 1903\u20134 canals and wells supplied 76 and 75 square miles respectively, tanks or jhils 58, and other sources (chiefly rivers) 47. The canals are all small works and may be divided into two classes. Those drawn from the Bahgul, Kail\u0101s, Kichh\u0101, and Paha have permanent masonry head-works, with channels dug to definite sections, and are provided with subsidiary masonry works, regulators,\n&c., like the regular canals of the Do\u0101b. The others are small channels, into which water is turned from the rivers by earthen dams, renewed annually. Masonry wells are not constructed for irrigation, except by the Court of Wards. In most parts of the District the wells are temporary excavations worked by pulley, or by a lever, as the spring-level is high; but in some tracts to the south water is raised in a leathern bucket by a rope pulled by bullocks or by men.\n\nKankar or nodular limestone is scarce and of poor quality. A little lime is made by burning the ooze formed of lacustrine shells.\n\nThe most important industry of the District is sugar-refining. This is carried on after native methods, which are now being examined by the Agricultural department in the hope of eliminating waste. Coarse cotton cloth and cotton carpets or dar\u012bs are woven largely, and Bareilly city is noted for the production of furniture. A little country glass is also manufactured. The Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway workshops employed 81 hands in 1903, and a brewery in connexion with that at Nain\u012b T\u0101l is under construction. The indigo industry is declining.\n\nGrain and pulse, sugar, hides, hemp, and oilseeds are the chief exports, while salt, piece-goods, metals, and stone and lime are imported. The grain is exported to Calcutta, and sugar is sent to the Punjab, R\u0101jput\u0101na, and Central India. Bareilly city and Aonla are the chief centres of trade.\n\nThe main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway passes through the south of the District, with a branch from Bareilly city through Aonla to Aligarh. The north is served by the Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway, which is the only route to the hill-station of Nain\u012b T\u0101l, and by a line through Pilibhit and Sit\u0101pur to Lucknow, which leaves the Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway at Bhojupura, a few miles north of Bareilly city. Another metre-gauge line, recently opened, leads from Bareilly south-west through Budaun to Soron in Etah District.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is 139 miles and of unmetalled roads 186 miles. Of the former, 125 miles are in charge of the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 88 miles is met by Local funds. There are avenues of trees along 254 miles. The District is not well supplied with roads. Those which are metalled follow roughly the alignment of the railways, and there are no others, except the road from Aonla to Budaun. In the north communication is almost impossible during the rains; but the streams can easily be forded in the hot and cold seasons.\n\nBareilly is not liable to severe famine, owing to the natural moisture of the soil and the rarity of so complete failure of the rains as occurs elsewhere. It is also well served by railways, and a considerable portion can be irrigated. Ample grazing-\ngrounds for cattle are within easy reach. In 1803-4 distress was felt, and the spring crops were grazed by the cattle as no grain had formed. In 1819 and 1825-6 there was scarcity. The famine of 1837-8 followed a succession of bad years, and its effects were felt, but not so severely as in the Do\u00e1b. While famine raged elsewhere in 1860-1, Bareilly suffered only from slight scarcity, owing to the failure of the autumn harvest; and relief works, which were opened for the first time, alleviated distress. Relief works were also necessary in 1868-9, 1877-8, and 1896-7, but the numbers attracted to them never rose very high.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service, and by four Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. There is a tahsild\u00e1r at the head-quarters of each tahsil. The Executive Engineer of the Rohilkhand division (Roads and Buildings) and the Executive Engineer of the Rohilkhand Canals are stationed at Bareilly city.\n\nThere are three regular District Munsifs and a Subordinate Judge, and the appointment of Village Munsifs commenced recently. The District and Sessions Judge of Bareilly has civil and criminal jurisdiction in both Bareilly and Pilibhit Districts. Crime is very heavy, especially offences affecting life and grievous hurt. Religious feeling runs high, and quarrels between Hindus and Muhammadans, accompanied by serious rioting, are not infrequent. The thieving caste of Daleras has already been mentioned. Female infanticide is now very rarely suspected, and in 1904 only 130 names remained on the registers of proclaimed families.\n\nUnder the Rohillas proprietary rights did not exist, and villages were farmed to the highest bidder. After annexation in 1801 Rohilkhand was divided into two Districts, Mor\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bareilly. Sh\u00e1h-jah\u00e1npur District was formed in 1813-4; Budaun was carved out of both the original Districts in 1824; the south of Nain\u00ed T\u00e1l District was taken away in 1858, and sixty-four villages were given, as a reward for loyalty, to the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1mpur. Pilibhit was made a separate District in 1879. In the early short-term settlements the Rohilla system of farming was maintained till 1812, when proprietary rights were conferred on persons who seemed best entitled to them. The demand then fixed was so high that heavy balances were frequent, and many estates were abandoned. A more enlightened method of settlement based on a survey was commenced under Regulation VII of 1822, and the first regular settlement followed under Regulation IX of 1833. Different methods were adopted by the officers who carried this out. Some divided each village into circles according to soil and situation, while others classified villages according to their general condition as a whole. Rent rates were sometimes assumed for the various soils, while in other cases general revenue rates were deduced from the collections\nin previous years. The revenue fixed amounted to 11 lakhs on the present area. Another settlement was made in 1867-70. The rental 'assets' were calculated from rent rates selected after careful inquiry. A large area was grain-rented; and the rent rates for this tract were selected after an examination of the reputed average share of the landlord, and after experiments in the out-turn of various crops, the average prices for twenty years being applied to ascertain the cash value. The result was an assessment of 13.5 lakhs; but this was reduced by about Rs. 4,000 in 1874-6, owing to the assessment of too large an area in the north of the District, where cultivation fluctuates. The latest revision was carried out in 1898-1902. Cash rents were then found to be paid on about two-thirds of the total cultivated area, and the actual rent-roll formed the basis of assessment. Rents of occupancy tenants had remained for the most part unaltered since the previous settlement, and enhancements were given where these were inadequate. Grain rents, chiefly found in the north of the District, were largely commuted to cash rates. The demand fixed amounts to 15 lakhs, representing 45 per cent. of the net 'assets,' and the incidence falls at Rs. 1.7 per acre, varying from Rs. 1.3 to Rs. 2 in different parts.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|        | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue | 13.14  | 12.93  | 15.44  | 14.94  |\n| Total revenue | 16.67  | 20.45  | 25.13  | 26.01  |\n\nThere is one municipality, Bareilly City, and ten towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which has an income of 1.7 lakhs, chiefly from rates. In 1903-4 the expenditure on roads and buildings amounted to Rs. 63,000.\n\nThere are 22 police stations and 19 outposts, all but one of the latter being in Bareilly city. The District Superintendent of police has under him an assistant and 4 inspectors, besides a force of 112 subordinate officers and 587 men of the regular police, 374 municipal and town police, and 1,989 village and road chaukidars. The Central jail, which has accommodation for more than 3,000 prisoners, contained a daily average of nearly 1,800 in 1903, while the District jail contained 715. The latter was formerly used for convicts from Naini Tal and from Pilibhit, and is a Central jail for female prisoners.\n\nThe District takes a medium place as regards the literacy of its inhabitants, of whom 2.7 per cent. (4.7 males and 0.6 females) can read and write. The number of public institutions increased from 143 in 1880-1 to 154 in 1900-1, and the number of pupils from 5,033 to\n6,675. In 1903-4 there were 196 such institutions, with 9,636 pupils, of whom 996 were girls, besides 163 private schools with 2,479 pupils. Of the total, 3 were managed by Government, and 136 by the District and municipal boards, while 55 were aided. There is an Arts college at Bareilly city. In 1903-4 the expenditure on education was a lakh, of which Rs. 53,000 was derived from Local and municipal funds, Rs. 23,000 from fees, and Rs. 12,000 from Provincial revenues.\n\nThere are 13 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 287 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 114,000, of whom 3,068 were in-patients, and 2,815 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 30,000, most of which was met from Local and municipal funds. There is a lunatic asylum at Bareilly city with about 400 inmates.\n\nIn 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 36,000, representing a proportion of 33 per 1,000 of the population. Vaccination is compulsory only in Bareilly city.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1879, under revision); S. H. Fremantle, Settlement Report (1903).]\n\nBareilly Tahsil.\u2014Central tahsil of Bareilly District, United Provinces, conterminous with the pargana of Karor or Bareilly, lying between 28\u00b0 13' and 28\u00b0 37' N. and 79\u00b0 14' and 79\u00b0 38' E., with an area of 310 square miles. Population increased from 298,482 in 1891 to 325,650 in 1901. There are 414 villages and one town, Bareilly (population, 131,208), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 2,71,000, and for cesses Rs. 48,000. The high density of population, 1,050 persons per square mile, is due to the inclusion of a large city. There is some poor soil, but the tract across which the R\u0101mg\u0101\u1e45ga flows in a constantly varying channel is generally fertile. Five smaller streams flow from north to south and are used for irrigation. Sugar-cane is the most valuable crop, and is largely grown, while sugar is refined at many places, especially in Bareilly city. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 240 square miles, of which 50 were irrigated. Small canals drawn from the East Bahgul river irrigate 6 or 7 square miles, and wells 15 or 20. Tanks or jhils and rivers supply the remainder.\n\nBareilly City (Bareli).\u2014Administrative head-quarters of the Bareilly Division and District, United Provinces, with a cantonment, situated in 28\u00b0 22' N. and 79\u00b0 24' E., 812 miles by rail from Calcutta and 1,031 from Bombay. It lies at the junction of a branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Al\u012bgarh with the main line; and these are met by the narrow-gauge railways from Lucknow through Sit\u0101pur, from K\u0101thgod\u0101m at the foot of the hills, and from Soron through Budaun. Population has increased steadily. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 102,982, (1881) 113,417, (1891)\n121,039, and (1901) 131,208. These figures include the inhabitants of the cantonment, who numbered 13,828 in 1901. There are 67,000 Hindus, 59,000 Musalmans, and 3,000 Christians.\n\nTradition relates that the old city was founded in 1537, and derived its name of B\u0101ns Bareli from B\u0101s, a Barhel\u0101 by caste, or from B\u0101s and Barel, Katehriy\u0101 R\u0101jputs. The prefix is now usually interpreted as being the word b\u0101ns or 'bamboo,' and is still used by the inhabitants. About 1573 a subordinate post was established here, to check the turbulent Katehriy\u0101s of Rohilkhand, and a small town gradually grew up round the fort. By the close of Akbar's reign, in 1596, Bareilly had become the head-quarters of a mahal or pargana. In 1657 it was made the capital of Katehr (see Rohilkhand), and a new city was founded by Makrand Rai, who was appointed governor. As the Mughal empire decayed in the eighteenth century, the Rohilla power was consolidated by Ali Muhammad, who established his capital at Aonla, and Bareilly was for a time of small importance. H\u0101fiz Rahmat Kh\u0101n, who virtually succeeded Ali Muhammad, though nominally guardian to his sons, lived alternately at Pilibhit and at Bareilly, which again rose into prominence. The place fell, with the surrounding country, into the possession of the Naw\u0101b of Oudh after the defeat of the Rohillas by the combined British and Oudh forces in 1774, and passed to the British by cession in 1801, when it became the head-quarters of a District and of a provincial court. In 1816 an insurrection took place in consequence of the imposition of a house tax, and in 1837 and 1842 serious religious disturbances occurred between Hindus and Musalmans.\n\nDuring the Mutiny of 1857 Bareilly was an important centre of disaffection. The sepoys rebelled on May 31, and Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, grandson of H\u0101fiz Rahmat Kh\u0101n, was proclaimed governor. Most of the Europeans escaped to Nain\u012b T\u0101l. The rebel ruler found government no easy task, and the annals of his brief term relate many dissensions and difficulties. As British troops recovered ground to the south and west, the Naw\u0101b of Farrukh\u0101b\u0101d, the N\u0101na Sahib from Cawnpore, Firoz Sh\u0101h from Lucknow, and other leading rebels took refuge here. On May 5, 1858, a British army arrived before the city, and two days later the rebels fled into Oudh, and the British occupied Bareilly. In 1871 the peace of the city was again disturbed by serious religious riots, and since then religious differences have occasionally threatened to develop into actual fighting.\n\nBareilly stands on a plateau slightly elevated above the basin of the R\u0101mgang\u0101, a branch of which now runs under the city. The native quarter is traversed by a long, well-kept street, widening at intervals into markets. The houses are usually of brick coated with white plaster, which is sometimes adorned with tracery, but few have any pretensions\nto architectural beauty. The oldest building of any importance is the tomb of H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, close to the city on the Aonla road, which is an elegant building of plastered brick with gilded finials. It was built by his son in 1775 and repaired by his daughter in 1839, and was again repaired in 1891-2 at the cost of Government. The finest public buildings are the dispensary and Dufferin Hospitals, the tahs\u012bl\u012b and chief police station, and a triangular building containing the municipal hall, a literary institute, and the honorary magistrates' courthouse. The Central jail is situated north of the city on the Nain\u012b T\u0101l road. South of the city lies the civil station, which contains the high school, the American Methodist Orphanage and Theological Seminary, the District offices and District jail, and several churches. The cantonment lies south of the civil station, and contains a small fort built after the disturbance of 1816. The usual garrison consists of British artillery, British and Native infantry, and Native cavalry. Bareilly is the head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Division, and of the Executive Engineers of the Rohilkhand Canals and Rohilkhand division (Roads and Buildings).\n\nA municipality was constituted in 1858, which in 1901 had a population of 117,380. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged 1.2 lakhs. In 1903-4 the income was 2.1 lakhs, chiefly from octroi (1.5 lakhs). The expenditure of 2.2 lakhs included public works (Rs. 42,000), conservancy (Rs. 33,000), public safety (Rs. 31,000), and administration and collection (Rs. 19,000). An excellent water-supply is drawn from wells. In 1903-4 the income of the cantonment fund was Rs. 48,000, and the expenditure Rs. 49,000.\n\nThe chief industry of the city is sugar-refining, and about 20,000 tons of raw sugar are imported annually, while 10,000 tons of sugar are exported by rail alone. Bareilly is also noted for its furniture, made both of bamboo and of the ordinary timbers in use for this purpose. Cloth is woven and brass vessels are made; but these industries are not very important. The Rohilkhand and Kumaun Railway workshops employ about 80 hands, and there is a dairy farm in connexion with the lunatic asylum. The principal educational institution is the college, which contains 104 students. A new building for this institution will be erected shortly on a site in the civil station presented by the Naw\u0101b of R\u0101mpur. The District school has about 450 pupils and the tahs\u012bl\u012b school 370. The municipality maintains 21 schools and aids 3 others, with a total attendance in 1904 of 2,321. There are also three orphanages, maintained by the Arya Sam\u0101j, the American Methodist Mission, and a Muhammedan Association.\n\nBarel.\u2014Hill range in Cach\u0101r District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See Barail.\n\nB\u0101rendra.\u2014Ancient name given to the part of Eastern Bengal lying\nbetween the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 and Karatoy\u0101 rivers, and corresponding with the old kingdom of Pundra, and with the western portion of the modern R\u0101jsh\u0101hi Division. The name is said to have been conferred by king Ball\u0101l Sen in the eleventh century; and it still survives in the B\u0101r\u012bnd, an elevated tract on the confines of Dinajpur, M\u0101lda, R\u0101jsh\u0101hi, and Bogra Districts.\n\nBargarh.\u2014Western tahsil of Sambalpur District, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 45' and 21\u00b0 44' N. and 82\u00b0 38' and 83\u00b0 54' E., with an area, in 1901, of 3,126 square miles. The population in that year was 467,076, compared with 452,022 in 1891. In 1905 the Phuljh\u0101r zamind\u0101ri, with an area of 842 square miles and a population of 102,135 persons, was transferred to the Raipur District of the Central Provinces, and the adjusted figures of area and population of the tahsil are 2,284 square miles and 394,941 persons. The density is 160 persons per square mile. The tahsil contains 1,172 inhabited villages. Bargarh, the head-quarters, is a village of 3,609 inhabitants, 29 miles distant from Sambalpur town on the Raipur road. Excluding 206 square miles of Government forest, 69 per cent. of the available area is occupied for cultivation. The cultivated area in 1903\u20134 was 1,403 square miles. The demand for land revenue in the same year was Rs. 1,06,000, and for cesses Rs. 21,000. The tahsil comprises an open tract along the right bank of the Mah\u0101nadi, flanked by hill and forest country to the west and north. It contains nine zamind\u0101ri estates, with a total area of 1,204 square miles.\n\nB\u0101rh Subdivision.\u2014North-eastern subdivision of Patna District, Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 10' and 25\u00b0 35' N. and 85\u00b0 11' and 86\u00b0 4' E., with an area of 526 square miles. Owing to plague, its recorded population in 1901 was only 365,327, compared with 408,256 in 1891, the density being 695 persons per square mile. The subdivision consists of a long and somewhat narrow strip of country intersected by tributaries of the Ganges, and bordering that river. It contains two towns, B\u0101rh (population, 12,164), its head-quarters, and Mok\u0101meh (13,861), an important railway junction; and 1,075 villages.\n\nB\u0101rh Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Patna District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 29' N. and 85\u00b0 43' E., on the Ganges. Population (1901), 12,164. B\u0101rh is a station on the East Indian Railway, 299 miles from Calcutta, and has a considerable trade in country produce. Jessamine oil (chameli) of a superior quality is manufactured. B\u0101rh was constituted a municipality in 1870. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 6,700, and the expenditure Rs. 6,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 10,400, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax); and the expenditure was Rs. 9,500. The town contains the usual subdivisional offices, a sub-jail with accommodation for 28 prisoners, and an English cemetery.\nBarhaj. Town in the Deori tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 17' N.$ and $83^\\circ 45' E.$, at the terminus of a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and near the confluence of the R\u0101pti and Gogra. Population (1901), 10,054. The town is said to have been founded about 1770, but only rose into importance with the introduction of sugar cultivation in the neighbourhood. It is now the most important trade centre in the District, and is also remarkable for its filthiness. Grain, oilseeds, and sugar are largely exported by rail and river, and the insurance of the river traffic is part of the business of the town. Sugar is manufactured in about forty factories. The banks of the R\u0101pti are covered with immense piles of timber\u2014part for re-exportation, part for boat-building, and part for fuel in the factories. The town is administered together with Gaur\u0101 under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 3,400. The R\u0101j\u0101 of Majhuli collects octroi duties and bazar dues under (United Provinces) Act III of 1901, and pays Rs. 3,500 annually to the town fund. Barhaj contains a flourishing town school with 183 pupils, a girls\u2019 school with 26, and a dispensary.\n\nBarhalganj.\u2014Town in the B\u0101nsgaon tahsil of Gorakhpur District, United Provinces, situated in $26^\\circ 17' N.$ and $83^\\circ 30' E.$, on the north bank of the Gogra, and on the road from Gorakhpur to Azamgarh. Population (1901), 5,181. It is composed of a street of masonry shops lining the sides of the road, with a fine metalled market-place. The trade consists chiefly in the export of grain, and in the distribution of imported goods, but there is also some manufacture of sugar. Barhalganj is a port of call for the river steamers. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 1,100. It contains a town school with 113 pupils, a girls\u2019 school with 14, and a dispensary.\n\nBarhampur.\u2014Subdivision and town of Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal. See BERHAMPORE.\n\nB\u0101ri Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the district of the same name in the State of Dholpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $26^\\circ 39' N.$ and $77^\\circ 37' E.$, about 19 miles almost due west of Dholpur railway station and 45 miles south-west of Agra. Population (1901), 11,603. A strong masonry fort here is supposed to have been built in the fifteenth century, but the oldest building is a mosque which bears an inscription recording that it was constructed between 1346 and 1351. Three miles to the southeast are the remains of a palace, built about 1617 for prince Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n as a shooting lodge. In the vicinity of the town are sandstone quarries, which are being connected with the railway at Dholpur by a light steam tramway. The town possesses a post office, a primary vernacular school attended by 60 boys, and a dispensary.\n\nB\u0101ri Do\u0101b.\u2014A doab or \u2018tract between two rivers\u2019 (the Be\u0101s\nand R\u0101vi) in the Punjab, lying between $29^\\circ 22'$ and $32^\\circ 30'$ N. and $71^\\circ 6'$ and $75^\\circ 58'$ E., and comprising Amritsar District and portions of Gurd\u0101spur, Lahore, Montgomery, and Mult\u0101n. The name was formed by the Mughal emperor Akbar, by combining the first syllables of the names of the two rivers.\n\n**B\u0101ri Do\u0101b Canal.**\u2014A perennial irrigation canal in the Punjab, taking off from the left bank of the R\u0101vi, and watering the Districts of Gurd\u0101spur, Amritsar, and Lahore in the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b or tract of country between the Be\u0101s and R\u0101vi. The present undertaking originated in a project for the improvement of an older work, the Hasli canal, constructed about the year 1633 by Ali Mard\u0101n Kh\u0101n, the famous engineer of the emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. After the occupation of Lahore in 1846, Major Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magd\u0101la) turned his attention at once to this project, and set on foot the necessary surveys. The progress of the work was interrupted by the outbreak of war. After annexation the work was pressed on, because the immediate construction of the canal was regarded as almost a matter of political necessity to provide employment for the disbanded Sikh soldiers, who, having their homes in the centre of the tract, would otherwise have had little encouragement to turn to agriculture. The alignment of the Hasli canal proved on examination to be so defective that the officers in charge decided upon the adoption of an entirely independent line, parts only of the original channel being utilized as distributaries. Irrigation began in 1860\u20131, but the present permanent weir and other regulating head-works were not completed till after 1875. The head-works are at the village of M\u0101dhopur in Gurd\u0101spur District, where the river is crossed by a weir 2,700 feet long. The canal is capable of carrying 6,500 cubic feet per second: the highest average supply in the hot season is 4,850, while in the cold season it varies from *1,270 to 2,170 cubic feet per second. The main line terminates at its 31st mile, there separating into the Kas\u016br and main branches. The Kas\u016br branch 7 miles lower down gives off the Sobraon branch, and the main branch after 25 miles gives off the Lahore branch, the four branches following the crests of the ridges into which the tract is divided by its natural drainage. The total length of the main and branch canals is 369 miles, and there are 1,591 miles of distributaries, from which water is brought upon the fields by means of watercourses constructed and maintained by the cultivators. The canal is not navigable. The rainfall is heaviest in the upper part of the system, which has necessitated a special system of irrigation in Gurd\u0101spur District and in the portion of Amritsar District north of the North-Western Railway on the Kas\u016br and Sobraon branches. In that tract the distributaries are closed during the cold season after a watering has been given for sowing the spring crops, the winter rains with some help from wells being\nsufficient to mature those crops. The water thus set free has been utilized in extending irrigation in the driest part of Lahore District, where it borders on Montgomery\u2014a tract for which it would otherwise have been impossible to provide a perennial supply. The gross area commanded by the canal is 2,710 square miles in Gurdaspur, Amritsar, and Lahore Districts. The lower portion of the Do\u00e1b in Montgomery and Mult\u0101n is not irrigated, as there is not sufficient water available in the R\u0101vi during the winter. The area irrigated was 297 square miles in 1860, 677 square miles in 1880\u20131, 1,346 square miles in 1900\u20131, and 1,464 square miles in 1903\u20134. The total capital expenditure (exclusive of interest) up to the end of 1903\u20134 was 197 lakhs. The gross income for that year was about 33 lakhs, or, inclusive of the increase of land revenue due to irrigation (which is credited to the canal in the accounts), 36 lakhs. The working expenses amounted to 11 lakhs, leaving a net profit of 25 lakhs, or 12\u00b768 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nB\u0101rind.\u2014Elevated tract in Eastern Bengal and Assam, occupying a considerable area on the confines of the Districts of Dinajpur, M\u0101lda, Rajsh\u0101hi, and Bogra. It derives its name from the old Hindu kingdom of B\u0101rendra. It belongs to an older alluvial formation than the surrounding country, and is composed of argillaceous beds of a rather pale reddish-brown hue, often weathering yellowish, in which kankar and pisolitic ferruginous concretions frequently occur. It is covered in many places with a scrub jungle, the predominant tree being the s\u0101l (Shorea robusta). It is now being reclaimed by the Sant\u0101ls, Mund\u0101s, and Oraons, large numbers of whom have immigrated into this tract, attracted by the prospect of holding their new clearances rent-free for a few years. As soon as rent is demanded, they move on, leaving the fields they have cleared to be occupied by the less hardy Hindu cultivators, who have not the energy to clear land for themselves.\n\nBarip\u0101d\u0101.\u2014Capital of May\u016brbhanj, one of the Orissa Tributary States, Bengal, situated in 21\u00b0 56' N. and 86\u00b0 44' E., on the Burh\u0101balang river. Population (1901), 5,613. Barip\u0101d\u0101 is connected by a light railway (2 feet 6 inch gauge) with Rups\u0101 junction on the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway, and by metalled roads with Bahalda and Karanj\u0101, the headquarters of the B\u0101mangh\u0101ti and P\u0101ncp\u012br subdivisions, and with the towns of Balasore and Midnapore; several fair-weather roads run from it to other parts of the State. It is the seat of the administration, and contains the residence of the chief, a good dispensary, and a high school, besides criminal and civil courts, and a jail.\n\nBari S\u0101dri.\u2014Principal town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 24\u00b0 25' N. and 74\u00b0 29' E., about 50 miles east by south-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 4,063. On a hill to the south is a small fort, now almost in ruins. The estate, which is held by the senior noble of Mew\u0101r, who is styled R\u0101j,\nconsists of 91 villages. The income is about Rs. 48,000, and a tribute of Rs. 820 is paid to the Darb\u0101r. The chiefs of S\u0101dri are Jh\u0101la R\u0101jputs. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, one Ajja came to Mew\u0101r from Halwad in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and fought in 1527 on the side of R\u0101n\u0101 Sangr\u0101m Singh I against the emperor B\u0101bar in the famous battle of Kh\u0101nua. When the R\u0101na was wounded and was being carried off the field, Ajja took his place on his elephant and drew on himself the brunt of the battle. He did not survive the day; but his son received the fief of S\u0101dri, the title of R\u0101j, the seat of honour next to the R\u0101n\u0101, and the right of carrying the ensigns of Mew\u0101r and of beating his kettle-drums as far as the gate of the palace. These privileges are still enjoyed by his successors. Of the latter, one was killed at Chitor fighting against Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h in 1534, another at the same place fighting against Akbar in 1567, and a third at the battle of Haldigh\u0101t in 1576.\n\nBaris\u0101l Subdivision.\u2014Head-quarters subdivision of Backergunge District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated at its north-east corner, between 22\u00b0 28' and 23\u00b0 5' N. and 90\u00b0 1' and 90\u00b0 41' E., with an area of 1,110 square miles. The population in 1901 was 945,367, compared with 879,177 in 1891. It contains three towns, Baris\u0101l (population, 18,978), the head-quarters, and the important marts of Jh\u0101lak\u0101ti (5,234) and N\u0101lchit\u012b (2,240); and 2,048 villages. It is the most densely populated subdivision in the District, having 852 persons to the square mile. It is a deltaic tract, intersected by numerous rivers and water-channels. The level sinks to the north-west, and parts of this portion are covered with deep morasses.\n\nBaris\u0101l Town.\u2014Head-quarters of Backergunge District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 22\u00b0 42' N. and 90\u00b0 22' E., on the west bank of the Baris\u0101l river. Population (1901), 18,978. In the middle of the eighteenth century Baris\u0101l was an important salt chauki, or place where salt tax was paid. The head-quarters of the District, formerly at Backergunge, were transferred here in 1801. The Baris\u0101l river is navigable by steamers all the year round; and daily steamers ply to Khuln\u0101 and N\u0101r\u0101yanganj, establishing communication with Calcutta and Dacca respectively, the journey to the former occupying twenty-four hours and to the latter twelve hours. It has also steamer communication with Patuakh\u0101li in the District and Ich\u0101kh\u0101li and Bhaw\u0101niganj in No\u0101kh\u0101li. Baris\u0101l was constituted a municipality in 1876. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 31,000, and the expenditure Rs. 29,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 47,000, of which Rs. 10,000 was derived from a tax on persons (or property tax), and Rs. 12,000 from a conservancy rate; the income was also augmented by contributions of Rs. 4,000 for medical purposes and Rs. 10,000 for general purposes from Local funds and other sources. The expenditure in the same year was Rs. 35,000. The town has wide, straight, and\nwell-kept streets, the river-side road to S\u0101gardi being bordered by fine avenues; and it is intersected by numerous creeks, which are flushed twice a day at flood tide, and add much to the healthiness of the town. There are numerous tanks, of which four, unconnected with the river, are reserved for drinking purposes; a scheme to supply filtered water is under consideration.\n\nIn addition to the usual public offices and the jail, the town contains three churches belonging to the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations, and a public library founded in 1855. The District jail has accommodation for 580 prisoners, who are employed on oil-pressing, brick-pounding, brick-making, carpet and mat-making, weaving, and bamboo work. A first-grade college teaches up to the B.A. standard. A District school is controlled by a joint committee of the municipality and District board, and two girls' schools are maintained respectively by the Baptist Zan\u0101na Mission and by subscriptions; a technical school is affiliated to the District school. There are five printing presses, and three vernacular newspapers are published in the town.\n\nB\u0101riya State (Deogarh B\u0101riya).\u2014Tributary State in Rew\u0101 K\u0101ntha, Bombay, lying between 22\u00b0 21' and 22\u00b0 58' N. and 73\u00b0 41' and 74\u00b0 18' E., with an estimated area of 813 square miles. It is bounded on the east and west by the British District of the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls; on the north by the State of Sanjeli; and on the south by the State of Chota Udaipur. The extreme length, from north to south, is 39 miles. The country is hilly in the south and east, but flat in the west, and is divided into seven subdivisions\u2014Randhikpur, Dudhia, Um\u0101ria, Haveli, K\u0101kadkhila, S\u0101gt\u0101la, and R\u0101jgarh. Much of it is covered with forest. The climate is damp and unhealthy, fever being the prevailing disease.\n\nThe chiefs of B\u0101riya are Chaub\u0101n R\u0101jputs, who are said to have been driven south by the advance of the Musalm\u0101ns about the year 1244, and to have taken possession of the city and fort of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner. Here they ruled till defeated by Mahm\u016bd Begara in 1484, and forced to retire to the wilder parts of their dominions. Of two branches of the family, one founded the house of Chota Udaipur and the other the house of B\u0101riya. The connexion of this State with the British dates from 1803, when, in consequence of the help given by the chief to the British army in their operations against Sindhia, the Government subsidized a detachment of B\u0101riya Bhils at a monthly cost of Rs. 1,800. The State formed part of the Central India Agency up to 1825, when it was transferred to Bombay. The title of the chief is Mah\u0101r\u0101wal of Deogarh B\u0101riya, and he is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. He holds a sanad authorizing adoption. Succession follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nThe Census of 1901 showed a population of 81,579, or 100 persons per square mile, living in 483 villages. Hindus numbered 79,149, and Musalm\u0101ns 2,301. The chief castes are Bhils, Kolis, and Naikdas.\nOf the total area, only 20 per cent. is cultivated. The principal products are timber, maize, pulse, gram, and wheat. The State contains no mines and no manufactures. The chief has power to try his own subjects for capital offences.\n\nThe revenue in 1903-4 was 2 lakhs, of which Rs. 56,000 was derived from land and Rs. 18,000 from forests. The State maintains a quasi-military police force of 180 men. Of the public works constructed before 1876 under British management, the chief are the portion (21 miles in length) of the high road between M\u0101lw\u0101 and Gujar\u0101t lying within the limits of the State, and a branch 7 miles long connecting the village of B\u0101riya with the main road. Since 1892 the Anand-Godhra Railway has been extended to Ratl\u0101m, passing through B\u0101riya territory. The State supports a dispensary, which treated 4,331 patients in 1903-4, and 12 schools for boys, with an average attendance of 427 pupils. There is also one girls' school, with an average attendance of 48.\n\nB\u0101riya Village (Deogarh B\u0101riya).\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in the Rew\u0101 K\u0101ntha Agency, Bombay, situated in 22\u00b0 42\u2032 N. and 73\u00b0 51\u2032 E., 50 miles north-east of Baroda, about 5 miles from Limkheda on the Godhra-Ratl\u0101m branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. Population (1901), 3,717. It lies almost in the centre of the State, about half a mile from the Pan\u0101m river, in an angle formed by two lines of hills. The third side is enclosed by a wall built by R\u0101j\u0101 Prithwir\u0101j. About the end of the eighteenth century the town seems to have been of considerable importance. It was on a much-frequented route between Gujar\u0101t and M\u0101lw\u0101, the tolls levied at its gates generally exceeding Rs. 20,000 a year. Partly on the Deogarh hill and partly in the plain stands the B\u0101riya fort, with walls about 10 feet high in the plain and 6 feet on the hill slopes. On the top of the hill a small white building contains the tutelary deity of the B\u0101riya house. The story is that three generations after the fall of Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, when Dungar Singh was looking for a site for his capital, one of his Bhils, cutting wood on a hill, struck his axe against two round stones, blood gushed out, and the axe was shivered. Hearing his story, Dungar Singh visited the spot, called it Deogarh or 'God's fort,' installed the stones as the tutelary deity of the hill, and founded his capital at its foot. The stones are still visited with great pomp by the R\u0101j\u0101 every twelfth year.\n\nBarkal.\u2014Mart in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 22\u00b0 43\u2032 N. and 92\u00b0 25\u2032 E., on the right bank of the Karnaphuli river. Population (1901), 2,194. It gives its name to the hills in the vicinity. The river here forms rapids, and a tramway has been constructed by which passengers and goods are transhipped.\n\nB\u0101rkh\u0101n.\u2014Tahsil in the south-east of Loralai District, Baluchi-st\u0101n, lying between 29\u00b0 37\u2032 and 30\u00b0 21\u2032 N. and 69\u00b0 3\u2032 and 70\u00b0 4\u2032 E.,\nand bordering the Punjab, with an area of 1,317 square miles. The population in 1901 was 14,922, an increase of 4,276 on the rough estimate made in 1891. The head-quarters station, which bears the same name as the tahsil, is about 3,650 feet above sea-level. The number of villages is 114. The land revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 47,000. The frequent existence of occupancy rights is a special feature of the tenures of the tahsil. In the Legh\u0101ri-B\u0101rkh\u0101n circle, one-third of the revenue levied is paid to the Legh\u0101ri chief as superior proprietor of the soil, and he holds a revenue-free grant up to 1907. B\u0101rkh\u0101n rugs are well-known, but have recently deteriorated in quality.\n\nBarkhera.\u2014The name of four Thakur\u0101ts in Central India: two in the Bh\u014dp\u0101war Agency, distinguished as Mota and Chhota, and two in the M\u0101lw\u0101 Agency, known as Deo Dungri and Panth.\n\nB\u0101rk\u016br.\u2014Village in the Udipi taluk of South Kanara District, Madras, situated in 13\u00b0 29' N. and 74\u00b0 48' E. The traditional capital of Tuluva, the country of Tulu-speaking people, it was long the local seat of the representatives of the Hoysala Ballalas of Dorasamudra, who were Jains by religion. The local rulers attained practical independence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the most powerful of them being named Bh\u016bt\u0101l P\u0101ndya (circa A.D. 1250), confounded by some with the Bh\u016bt\u0101l P\u0101ndya to whom is ascribed the Aliya Sant\u0101na law of inheritance peculiar to the west coast, the origin of which is really much earlier. When the Vijayanagar kingdom was founded in 1336, Harihara, its first ruler, stationed a viceroy called the R\u0101yaru here and built a fort, remains of which are still to be seen. On the fall of Vijayanagar the Bednur kings asserted their authority; and in the ensuing struggle the Jains were almost extirpated and B\u0101rk\u016br was destroyed. Ruined tanks and Jain shrines and sculptures still abound, but its importance has vanished and not one Jain house remains.\n\nBarliy\u0101r.\u2014Village in the Coonoor taluk of the Nilgiri District, Madras, situated in 11\u00b0 20' N. and 76\u00b0 50' E., 6\u00bd miles from Coonoor, and half-way down the gh\u0101\u1e6d road from Coonoor to Mettup\u0101laiyam. Population (1901), 2,234. Mr. E. B. Thomas, a former Collector of the District, started a private garden here in 1857, which was afterwards taken over by Government. Experiments in tea cultivation and in the growth of medicinal plants, camphor, rubbers, &c., which like a warm, damp climate at a moderate elevation, have been made. The garden, which is the only one of its kind in the Presidency, is in charge of the Curator of the Government Gardens at Ootacamund.\n\nBarmanda.\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\nBarmer.\u2014Head-quarters of the Mall\u0101ni district in the State of Jodhpur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 25\u00b0 45' N. and 71\u00b0 23' E., on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway. Population (1901), 6,064. The present town is said to have been founded in the thirteenth century by a\nR\u0101j\u0101 B\u0101hada, and to have been called after him B\u0101hadamer (the meru or 'hill-fort' of B\u0101hada), since contracted to Barmer. It is substantially built on the side of a rocky hill, on the summit of which are the remains of an old fort; and it possesses a post and telegraph office, a vernacular school, and a hospital. Millstones constructed here are largely exported, and fuller's earth (used as a hair-wash) is found at K\u0101puri and other places in the neighbourhood. Barmer is also the name of one of the principal estates in Mall\u0101ni, consisting of sixty-six villages held by five different families, who pay between them a tribute of about Rs. 1,000 to the Darb\u0101r.\n\n**Barnadi.**\u2014A river of Assam which rises in the Him\u0101layas and enters the valley of the Brahmaputra at 26\u00b0 13' N. and 91\u00b0 48' E. From this point it once formed the boundary between the Districts of K\u0101mrup and Darrang, but the river has so often changed its channel that its present course is no longer recognized as the boundary. Near the hills the Barnadi flows through forest and grass jungle, but farther south villages appear on the banks. The most important places are Son\u0101rikh\u0101l, where two small fairs are held, and Magamuri market in the T\u0101mulpur tahsil, which is situated about 4 miles from the Barnadi, but is a considerable centre of river-borne trade. A ferry plies throughout the year at Dumunichaki on the trunk road. The river is largely used as a trade route, and boats of 4 tons burthen can proceed as far as Son\u0101rikh\u0101l throughout the year, and to Malmur\u0101gaon in the rainy season. It has a total length of about 100 miles.\n\n**Barnagar (Nolai).**\u2014Town in the Ujjain district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in 23\u00b0 4' N. and 75\u00b0 23' E., on the west bank of the Ch\u0101mla, a tributary of the Chambal river, and on the Khandw\u0101-Ajmer branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 10,856. The town grew rapidly between 1881 and 1891, owing to the opening of the railway, and in spite of the famine of 1899-1900 is still increasing. It belonged formerly to the Bahram Loth family of R\u0101jputs, who still hold a rent-free village in the neighbourhood; but in the eighteenth century it fell to Sindhia. Barnagar is managed by a municipality, constituted in 1901, which controls the lighting and sanitation, having an income of about Rs. 1,200 a year, chiefly derived from local taxes. A considerable trade in grain and opium has arisen since the opening of the railway. A State post office, a dispensary, a school, and a resthouse are situated in the town. Close to the railway station there is a British combined post and telegraph office.\n\n**Barnag\u0101r.**\u2014Ancient site in Gwalior State, Central India See BARO.\n\n**Barnagore.**\u2014Town in the Twenty-four Parganas District, Bengal. See BARANAGAR.\n\n**Barn\u0101la** (or An\u0101hadgarh).\u2014Head-quarters of the An\u0101hadgarh\nniz\u0101mat, Pati\u0101la State, Punjab, situated in $32^\\circ 23' N.$ and $75^\\circ 37' E.$, 52 miles west of Pati\u0101la, on the R\u0101jpura-Bhatinda branch of the North-Western Railway. Population (1901), 6,905. Rebuilt in 1722 by Ala Singh, R\u0101ja of Pati\u0101la, it remained the capital of the State until the foundation of the town of Pati\u0101la in 1763, and the hearths of its founder are still revered by the people. It is built in the form of a circle, and surrounded by a wall of masonry, within which is a fort. Lying in the centre of the Jangal tract, it is a mart for the export of grain, and the State has constructed a large market to foster its development. The town contains a dispensary, an Anglo-veracular middle school, and a police station.\n\nBaro (or Barnagar).\u2014Village and ancient site in the Gwalior State, Central India, lying in $23^\\circ 56' N.$ and $78^\\circ 14' E.$ Baro is now only a small village, with a population (1901) of 533; but the neighbourhood is covered with the remains of an ancient city of considerable size, the ruins extending to the neighbouring town of Path\u0101ri. The principal remains consist of Hindu and Jain temples, chiefly situated close to a large tank, the waters of which are held up by a fine old stone dam. The village stands at the foot of the Gayan\u0101th hill, a part of the arm of the Vindhyas which strikes north from Bhilsa. The sandstone and shales of the Vindhya series are well exposed here, and the former has been employed in constructing the temples and houses of Baro. The finest building is the Gadarmal temple, on the western bank of the tank; and though the existing structure is a restoration of the original shrine, as the heterogeneous nature of its spire shows, it is still a magnificent example of mediaeval Hindu architecture. The shape of the sanctuary is interesting, being oblong instead of square, and within it is an unusually fine sculptured figure. The temple formerly stood in a spacious courtyard and was surrounded by seven smaller shrines, now mere heaps of bricks. The entrance to the courtyard lay through a lofty gate of which one richly carved pillar is still standing. The temples in this group are all Saivite, there being no Jain sculptures, as Cunningham has erroneously stated. The other large temple is called the Jain Mandir, and has evidently been restored by Jains from the remains of a Hindu building. It is entirely enclosed by a high wall, in the centre of which there is a sam\u0101dhi or ascetic\u2019s tomb. A gallery runs round all four sides, the shrines, which number eighteen in all and are of various sizes, lying behind it. Six spires and several domes surmount the building, and have been made up of the remains of Hindu and Jain temples, carved with images peculiar to each religion. The cells, however, contain only Jain images. Tradition relates that Baro was once a large and wealthy city, but was destroyed at the end of the seventeenth century by Chhatars\u0101l, the chief of Pann\u0101, who sacked the town. It is, however, impossible that a Hindu should\nhave injured the temples, which show evident signs of Muhammadan violence.\n\n[A. Cunningham, Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. x, p. 71.]\n\n**Baroda State** (or Territories of the Gaikw\u0101r).\u2014An important Native State in direct relations with the Government of India, but geographically in intimate connexion with the Presidency of Bombay. The territories of the State are situated in Gujar\u0101t and in K\u0101thi\u0101war, but are so interlaced with British Districts that it is impossible, without reference to a detailed map, to realize accurately their position, extent, and boundaries.\n\nRoughly speaking, it may be said that the State lies between $20^\\circ 45'$ and $24^\\circ 9'$ N. and $70^\\circ 42'$ and $73^\\circ 59'$ E., with the exception of the Okh\u0101mandal tract, which lies between $22^\\circ 5'$ and $22^\\circ 35'$ N. and $69^\\circ 5'$ and $69^\\circ 20'$ E.\n\nThe name by which the natives recognize the territories of Baroda and the capital town is Wadodar\u0101, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the Sanskrit word *vatodar* ('in the heart of the banyan-trees'). At any rate, this name well describes the capital of Baroda, inasmuch as in the vicinity of the city banyan-trees exist in great numbers. But the capital had also another name, namely, Virakshetra or V\u012braw\u0101ti ('a land of warriors'); and this name deserves special notice, as it is mentioned (along with Wadodar\u0101) by the Gujar\u0101t poet Prem\u0101nand, who was a native of Baroda and flourished in the seventeenth century. Moreover, it is stated that the ancient name of the city was Chandanavati, and that it was so called after R\u0101j\u0101 Chandan of the Dor tribe of R\u0101jputs, who wrested it from the Jains. It is now almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; but early English travellers and merchants mention the town as Brodera, and it is from this that the name Baroda is derived.\n\nThe Gujar\u0101t portion of the State is divided into three great divisions or *pr\u0101nt*: namely, the Kadi *pr\u0101nt* to the north, the Baroda *pr\u0101nt* in the centre, and the Navs\u0101ri *pr\u0101nt* to the south; while the K\u0101thi\u0101war portion is usually known as the Amreli *pr\u0101nt*.\n\nA consideration of the boundaries of these four administrative divisions will make clearer the geographical position of the scattered territories of the State. The most northerly *t\u0101lukas* of the Kadi *pr\u0101nt* are bounded on the north and north-west by the P\u0101lanpur and R\u0101dhanpur States, while the southern half is bounded on the west by Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, and on the south by Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and Kaira. The eastern portion of the *pr\u0101nt* has for its boundary the Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101 States. The Baroda *pr\u0101nt* has on its northern side Kaira District, which juts in between the Petl\u0101d and S\u0101vli *t\u0101lukas*. The western side is bounded by a portion of Kaira, by Cambay, and by Broach District. To the south it is bounded by the river Narbad\u0101, a portion of Broach.\nDistrict, and a portion of the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 States, and on the east by the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls District and the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 States. The Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt is nearly split into two by a portion of Surat District which almost crosses it from north to south. Bearing this in mind, it may be said with tolerable accuracy that this pr\u0101nt is bounded on the north by Broach and the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 States, on the west by Surat District and the sea, on the south by Surat, the State of B\u0101nsda, and the D\u0101ngs, and on the east by Kh\u0101ndesh District. The chief portion of the scattered Amreli pr\u0101nt is surrounded by Jun\u0101garh and other K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r States, while the outlying Okh\u0101mandal subdivision adjoins the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Cutch, and is bounded on the land side by the State of Nav\u0101nagar.\n\nThe area of the State is now estimated at 8,099 square miles, made up as follows: (1) Kadi, 3,015 square miles; (2) Baroda, 1,887 square miles; (3) Navs\u0101ri, 1,952 square miles; (4) Amreli, 1,245 square miles. These figures differ from previous estimates by reason of the progress of a survey which is now almost completed.\n\nThe greater part of the State lies within the area of the coastal band of alluvium which has been formed by the encroachment on the shallow Gulf of Cambay of the detrital deposits brought down by the many rivers, large and small, which drain the province of Gujar\u0101t, the western slopes of M\u0101lw\u0101, and the southern parts of R\u0101jput\u0101na. The upward slope of this alluvial band is very gradual, so that, as a general rule, the face of the country appears to be a dead level, and it is only when the eastern side of the alluvial flat is approached that low hills begin to make their appearance.\n\nIn the Kadi pr\u0101nt the only eminences that diversify the general flat surface of the country are hillocks and ridges of blown sandy loam, which rise, on an average, not more than 50 or 60 feet above the general level, and only occasionally attain a height of 100 feet or a little more. In the Baroda pr\u0101nt the number of eminences deserving the name of hills is also very small, and the only ones claiming attention are in the Sankheda t\u0101luka in the east. Here is the Achali ridge, of which the highest point rises 888 feet above sea-level, and the Lachharas hill (508 feet). The Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt is much more diversified than the other divisions; and here the height of the hills ranges from about 400 feet to about 2,000, with the exception of the fortified peak of S\u0101lher, which attains a height of 5,263 feet, and is the third highest point in the northern section of the Western Gh\u0101ts. The greater part of the Amreli pr\u0101nt is occupied by rolling plains which, as a rule, are very treeless and cheerless in their aspect, and it is only in the Dh\u0101ri t\u0101luka that we meet with hills worthy the name. This t\u0101luka includes a great part of the well-known Gir forest, a tract zoologically interesting as being the last refuge of the Gujar\u0101t lion. In the Baroda section of the Gir\nthere are four groups of hills increasing in height from east to west: the Sarkala group, lying to the west and containing Sarkala peak (2,128 feet above sea-level); the Rajmal group, of which the highest point attains an elevation of 1,623 feet; the Nandivela group (highest point 1,741 feet); the Lapala group, with a culminating point of 1,547 feet. Across the northern ridge of this taluka runs a small range of much lower hills, which near its western end is cut through by the Shatranji river, 2\u00bd miles north-east of Dh\u016bri. Its highest point is Dharitor (893 feet above sea-level). The extreme northern part of the Kodin\u0101r taluka is also hilly, but on a much smaller scale, while in Okh\u0101mandal the highest elevation does not exceed 150 feet. The hills are mostly flat-topped, and form small plateaux which in most cases are more or less scarped round their summits.\n\nThe drainage of the Gujar\u0101t portion of the State falls westwards into the Gulf of Cambay, excepting that of the most northerly talukas, which are drained by the Banas and Saraswat\u012b rivers into the Rann of Cutch. The four principal rivers falling into the Gulf are the S\u0101barmati, the Mahi, the Narbad\u0101, and the T\u0101pti, all passing in some parts of their courses through the Baroda State. Of much smaller size are the Dh\u0101dhar, between the Mahi and the Narbad\u0101; the Kim, between the Narbad\u0101 and the T\u0101pti; and the Mindhola, the P\u016brna, and the Ambik\u0101 to the south of the T\u0101pti. The S\u0101barmati first touches Baroda territory at Virpur in the Kher\u0101lu taluka, and then flows through it for about 18 miles, thereafter entering Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District. It receives no affluent of any size in Baroda; but farther down it is joined by the Kh\u0101ri, the Meshwa, and the V\u0101trak, which drain outlying patches of the State. The Mahi only skirts the northern extremity of the S\u0101vli taluka, and receives the waters of the Mesri, and a little lower down the united Goma and Kar\u0101d, which flow for a few miles through part of S\u0101vli. The central part of the S\u0101vli taluka discharges its superfluous rain-water through the Meni, which falls into the Mahi, 8 miles west of Baroda. The Narbad\u0101 itself only skirts portions of the State; but its northern tributary, the Orsang or Or, after being joined by the Unchh and Hiran, which drain the eastern part of the Sankheda taluka, brings it an important accession of water. The T\u0101pti flows for a distance of 43 miles through and past Baroda territory in the Songarh and Vy\u0101ra talukas. Farther down it flows for 23 miles through the K\u0101mrej taluka, and to the north of Surat skirts the outlying Baroda township of V\u0101ri\u0101v for 2\u00bd miles. The only river of importance in the Amreli pr\u0101nt is the Shatranji, which rises in the highest part of the Gir forest and drains the central portion of the division.\n\nThe Baroda pr\u0101nt presents a great diversity of aspect, the reason for this being that south of the city of Baroda black soil extends for a distance of 40 miles to the Narbad\u0101, while all the country to the north\nof it is red soil. The black soil, although very fertile, is remarkable for\nthe desert-like appearance it gives to the country where it predominates,\nwhile where the surface soil becomes red, there is a complete change.\nThe latter is cultivated from one end to the other, there are high\nhedges between the fields, and the view is shut in on every side by\nlofty trees such as abound in the neighbourhood of the capital. It is\nfor this reason that the country between Baroda and Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d has\noften been said to present the appearance of an English park. The\nKadi pr\u0101nt, consisting of an uninterrupted plain sloping gently from\nnorth-east to south-west, has a much more uniform and conse-\nquently less picturesque aspect. The western portion of the division is\nespecially monotonous. The Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt is the most variegated of\nthe four divisions of the State, affording within a small compass the\nscenery of cultivated land, hills, rivers, forests, and seaboard. All the\ncountry to the north and north-east of Navs\u0101ri is thickly wooded, and\nthese woods run for some distance down into the more level plains of\nGujar\u0101t along the P\u016brna and Ambik\u0101 rivers. The most hilly portion of\nthe country is in the Songarh t\u0101luka. The inland t\u0101lukas to the south-\neast of Navs\u0101ri, and the country adjoining the B\u0101nsda State, are more\nlevel, but not so rich or well cultivated as the coast subdivisions. Still\nhere and there clumps of forest appear, which become larger and bolder\nas an approach is made to the D\u0101ngs, where the wood is very thick.\nThe Amreli pr\u0101nt, being, with the exception of the Gir, devoid of hills\nand containing no rivers of any importance, is decidedly unpicturesque.\nThe Okh\u0101mandal division is, however, attractive, as it is on the sea-\ncoast, and contains the important harbour of Dw\u0101rka.\n\nThere are no large natural lakes worthy of the name; but in the\nKadi pr\u0101nt artificial tanks of more than ordinary dimensions exist, of\nwhich the Sarmishta at Vadnagar and the tanks in Visnagar and near\nP\u0101tan may be specially mentioned. The Baroda pr\u0101nt contains several\nlarge tanks, the most extensive being that of Maval in the S\u0101vli t\u0101luka.\nThe most important is, however, the great reservoir, almost deserving\nthe name of lake, which has been constructed at Ajwa during the rule\nof the present Gaikw\u0101r, for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants of\nBaroda city with potable water.\n\nOur knowledge of the geology of the State is mainly due to Mr. R.\nBruce Foote of the Geological Survey of India, who, in the years 1892\u20134,\nvisited and carefully examined all the regions containing important\nminerals. The results arrived at by him were published in a memoir,\nentitled *The Geology of Baroda State*.\n\nIn the Gujar\u0101t portion, recent subaerial formations, consisting mainly\nof the great loess or blown-loam deposit, cover by far the greater part\nof the country. They are underlaid by the old alluvium of the great\nrivers, which is nearly coextensive with them in the same area,\nbut is, as a rule, exposed only in the deep-cut river valleys. To the south of Baroda city the loess itself is largely obscured by extensive sheets of black soil. The Deccan trap rocks stand second in respect of the area they occupy, and are followed, but at a long distance, by the eocene (Nummulitic) rocks. Archaean granites and gneisses, and the lower Cretaceous rocks, occupy about equal areas of small extent, while the Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner quartzites, &c., are exposed over an area of only about 3 square miles, in about twenty different small patches. The succession of the geological formations met with in the K\u0101thi\u0101war part of the State is shown in order in the following schedule:\n\nI. Recent  \n\\{ Alluvium and subaerial deposits.  \n\\{ Miliolite.\n\nII. Tertiary  \n\\{ Dw\u0101rka beds.  \n\\{ G\u0101j beds.\n\nIII. Cretaceous\u2014Deccan trap series.\n\nOf these the Deccan trap series is much the most important formation in every way, being in many parts of great thickness. The Tertiary G\u0101j and Dw\u0101rka beds are met with only in the Okh\u0101mandal t\u0101luka.\n\nThe vegetation of the greater part of Baroda territory is characteristic of a highly cultivated country, so that beyond the regular crops the plants consist mainly of field-weeds, water or marsh plants growing in or fringing rivers, and species generally met with in hedges. The hilly portions of the State have a flora that is more or less characteristic of the Western Gh\u0101ts generally. Among the weeds of cultivation the species are chiefly referable to the natural families Gramineae, about thirty species; Leguminosae, about twenty species; Compositae, Labiatae, and Cyperaceae, about ten each; Malvaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Convolvulaceae, Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Euphorbiaceae, from six to eight each. Aquatic or marsh plants include Jussiaca repens, Trapa bispinosa, Caesulia axillaris, Ipomoea aquatica, Hygrophila spinosa, Herpestis Monnieria, Polygonum glabrum, Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria spiralis, Ottelia alismoides, Aeluropus villosus, Nymphaea Lotus, Nelumbium speciosum (both confined to ponds), and various Cyperaceae. In waste places and by road-sides are found Tridax procumbens, Achyranthes aspera, Coldenia procumbens, Evolvulus alsinoides, Tephrosia purpurea, Heylandia latebrosa, Waltheria indica, various species of Sida and Hibiscus, Hypoxis aurea, Chrozophora plicata, Jatropha gossypifolia, Argemone mexicana, Tribulus terrestris, Calotropis gigantea, Echinops echinatus, Solanum xanthocarpum, Datura fastuosa, Adhatoda Vasica, Clerodendron phlomoides, Leonotis nepetaefolia, and various grasses such as species of Andropogon, Polytoca, and Apluda. Shrubs met with in waste places include Woodfordia floribunda, Cassia auriculata, and species of Capparis and Zizyphus. The more characteristic hedge-plants include species of Maerua, Cadaba, Capparis, Zizyphus, Alangium,\nCordia, Vitex Negundo, one or two of the cactus-like Euphorbias, species of Phyllanthus, Flueggea, Jatropha, and at times Streblus asper. Mixed with the shrubs in these hedges are often various trees, the most characteristic being Bombax malabaricum. Climbing in hedges are many Leguminosae, Menispermaceae, Convolvulaceae, and Asclepiadaceae. Among planted trees and shrubs, or sometimes semi-wild in the neighbourhood of villages, may be mentioned Michelia Champaca, Artabotrys odoratissimus, Polyalthia longifolia, Anona squamosa, Thespesia populnea, Grewia asiatica, Aegle Marmelos, Zizyphus Jujuba, Mangifera indica, Spondias mangifera, Moringa pterygosperma, Dalbergia Sissoo, Pongamia glabra, Poinciana elata, Parkinsonia aculeata, Tamarindus indica, Bauhinia variegata, Albizzia Lebbeck, Acacia arabica, Psidium Guyava, Punica Granatum, Opuntia nigricans, Cordia Myxa, Bassia latifolia, Mimusops Elengi, Millingtonia hortensis, several species of Ficus, Artocarpus integrifolia, Holoptelia integrifolia, Phoenix sylvestris, and Borassus flabellifer.\n\nThe wild animals to be found in the Baroda State are the same as those of Gujar\u0101t: namely, tiger, leopard, bear, hog, wolf, hyena, jackal, fox, s\u0101mbhar, spotted deer, barking-deer, chinkara, nilgai, antelope. Monkeys abound. Under game-birds may be noticed: the sparrow-winged goose, the common grey goose, wild duck, teal, peafowl, sandgrouse, partridge, quail, snipe, bustard, florican, plover, &c. Fish are to be found in great abundance in the Mah\u012b and the Narbad\u0101. Inland in the Navs\u0101ri division fishing is carried on in the P\u016brna, Mindhola, and Ambik\u0101 rivers.\n\nIn the Baroda pr\u0101nt the hottest months are May and June, when the maximum temperature is about 105\u00b0, though occasionally it rises to 107\u00b0 or even to 110\u00b0. The minimum temperature during this period is about 80\u00b0. The rainy season usually sets in about the middle or latter part of June, and ends in October. During this period the climate is hot, moist, and very relaxing, with a maximum temperature of about 86\u00b0 and a minimum of 78\u00b0. The cold season, which commences in November and lasts for about four months, is dry and cool, the average maximum being about 90\u00b0 and the minimum 50\u00b0. The coldest months are generally December and January, while the most unhealthy are September and October. The Kadi pr\u0101nt is the healthiest division of the State. In the hot season the temperature here is high, the average maximum being about 100\u00b0 and the minimum 72\u00b0; but the rainy season is pleasantly moist and cool, forming a great contrast to the Baroda division. Moreover, Kadi enjoys a moderately good cold season, lasting from November till the middle of February, with a maximum temperature of about 90\u00b0 and a minimum of 51\u00b0. In the Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt a distinction must be drawn between the r\u0101ni or forest mah\u0101ls of Mahuva, Vy\u0101ra, Songarh, and part of Vel\u0101chha, which are\nunhealthy, and the r\u0101sti mah\u0101ls of Navs\u0101ri, Pals\u0101na, K\u0101mrej, and Gandevi, where the climate is good. The r\u0101ni mah\u0101ls are at all times insalubrious. In the r\u0101sti mah\u0101ls, the healthiest tracts during the hot season are Navs\u0101ri, Gandevi, and Bilimora. Here the close proximity of the sea maintains a moist and temperate climate; and though the early part of the hot season is somewhat heavy and close, the regular sea-breezes, which set in towards the end of April, produce a most agreeable change. The maximum temperature during the hot season is 101\u00b0 and the minimum 74\u00b0. In the rainy season the corresponding figures are 91\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, and in the cold season 87\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. In the Amreli prant the climate, except in the Dh\u0101ri and Kodin\u0101r t\u0101lukas, which are malarious and enervating, may be described as dry and salubrious. The hot season, which lasts from March to June, has an average maximum of 98\u00b0 and a minimum of 84\u00b0. During this portion of the year fresh and cool breezes nearly always set in at evening. In the rainy season the maximum is 88\u00b0 and the minimum 77\u00b0, while in the cold season the corresponding figures are 88\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.\n\nIn 1881 it was calculated, probably on very imperfect data, that the average rainfall of the State amounted to 58 inches in Navs\u0101ri, 37\u00b73 in Baroda, 32 in Kadi, and 21\u00b74 in Amreli. The similar averages arrived at for the decades 1882-1891 and 1892-1901 give the following result:\n\n|        | 1882-91 | 1892-1901 |\n|--------|---------|-----------|\n| Inches | Inches  |\n| Navs\u0101ri| 53\u00b79    | 51\u00b79      |\n| Baroda | 37\u00b79    | 38\u00b71      |\n| Kadi   | 30\u00b71    | 27\u00b74      |\n| Amreli | 22\u00b73    | 21\u00b76      |\n\nIt will thus be noticed that, though the Southern Gujar\u0101t divisions are much more favoured than the northern ones, in the Navs\u0101ri division rainfall appears to be steadily diminishing, and the same remark holds good with reference to Kadi.\n\nThe history of the Baroda State as such dates only from the break-up of the Mughal empire. For previous events see History.\n\nBOMBAY PRESIDENCY and GUJAR\u0100T.\n\nThe first Mar\u0101th\u0101 invasion of Gujar\u0101t took place in 1705. A few years later, in 1712, a Mar\u0101th\u0101 leader, Khande Rao D\u0101bh\u0101de by name, became so powerful that he was able to exact a fourth of the effects of all travellers who did not purchase his passport. He afterwards took part in various battles with the Muhammadan viceroys, and finally returned to S\u0101t\u0101ra, where he was created Sen\u0101pati or commander-in-chief in 1716. Four years later the emperor Muhammad Sh\u0101h granted the Mar\u0101th\u0101s the right to levy chauth (a quarter of the revenues) in\nGujarat. Khande Rao was some time afterwards present at the battle of B\u0101lapur, where his troops behaved with great bravery; and it was on this occasion that one of his officers, D\u0101m\u0101ji Gaikw\u0101r, distinguished himself so much that he obtained the title of Shamsher Bah\u0101dur, or the 'illustrious swordsman,' a title which has been borne by the Gaikw\u0101rs ever since. In 1721 Khande Rao and D\u0101m\u0101ji both died, the former being succeeded by his son Trimbak Rao, and the latter by his nephew, Pil\u0101ji.\n\nPil\u0101ji Gaikw\u0101r, who may be considered as the founder of the present ruling family, obtained the command of a p\u0101ga, and thereafter distinguished himself by his incursions into Gujarat. But in consequence of internal dissensions he was obliged to remove to Songarh, and it was from here that he conducted his future raids. Not only was Songarh, therefore, the cradle of the Gaikw\u0101r house, but it continued to be their head-quarters till 1766. For several years Pil\u0101ji, aided by other Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs, invaded and exacted tribute from the Surat ath\u0101visi or 'twenty-eight subdivisions.' In 1723 he marched on Surat itself, defeated the governor, and from that time began regularly to levy tribute in Gujarat. Help was afterwards afforded him by the Desais of P\u0101dra, Chhani, and Bhayali, by whose assistance he was enabled to direct his ravages as far as the Mah\u012b river. In 1725, after establishing his claim to the districts south of the Mah\u012b\u2014namely, Baroda, N\u0101ndod, Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner, Broach, and Surat\u2014he returned to his stronghold of Songarh, while at about the same time his superior, the Sen\u0101pati, established himself at Dabhoi, not far from Baroda, making this place, which had been captured by Pil\u0101ji, his regular head-quarters. Reverses now began to befall the Mar\u0101thas, and for a time they almost lost the hold they had gained over Gujarat. Pil\u0101ji himself was forced to fly to Cambay, and thereafter to Sorath. But the Muhammadan viceroy, Sarbuland Kh\u0101n, owing to want of succour from Delhi, rapidly lost ground in his turn, and was obliged to cede to Pil\u0101ji a share in the chauth of the districts south of the Mah\u012b. On the other hand, as Pil\u0101ji was the agent of the Peshw\u0101's rival the Sen\u0101pati, the Peshw\u0101 directed his own adherent, the Ponw\u0101r, to drive Pil\u0101ji out. Sarbuland Kh\u0101n now came to terms with Peshw\u0101 B\u0101ji Rao, and promised him the chauth and sardeshmukhi (an additional tenth), on condition that the Peshw\u0101 should support him against Pil\u0101ji and other Mar\u0101th\u0101 leaders. Notwithstanding this, in 1727 Pil\u0101ji succeeded in capturing both Baroda and Dabhoi. The next event that happened was that Sarbuland Kh\u0101n's grants to the Peshw\u0101 were not ratified at the Delhi court, and he was replaced as viceroy in 1730 by Abhai Singh, R\u0101j\u0101 of Jodhpur. As soon as the latter was in power, B\u0101ji Rao concerted with him to oppose Pil\u0101ji, and, if possible, to turn him out of Baroda. For this purpose the Peshw\u0101 advanced to lay siege to that town in 1731,\nbut was called away by the news that Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk's army was preparing to attack him. During his march he met the main army of the Sen\u0101pati, who was supported by the Gaikw\u0101r, and utterly routed it. This was the celebrated battle of Bhilapur, which took place in 1731. Pil\u0101ji, who was grievously wounded, had again to retire to Songarh; but, fortunately for him, the Peshw\u0101 did not deem it politic to crush completely the other Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs, and so he nominated Pil\u0101ji as mut\u0101lik of the new Sen\u0101pati, Jaswant Rao D\u0101bh\u0101de (appointed in the place of his father, who had been slain in the battle). At the same time he conferred on Pil\u0101ji the title of Sena Kh\u0101s Khel ('leader of the sovereign band'). Pil\u0101ji, as mut\u0101lik, had now all the resources of the Sen\u0101pati at his disposal; but his energetic career was put a stop to in 1732, when he was assassinated at D\u0101kor by the agents of Abhai Singh.\n\nPil\u0101ji was succeeded by his son D\u0101m\u0101ji, who at the beginning of his career had many troubles to contend with. Abhai Singh, taking advantage of the confusion into which the death of Pil\u0101ji had thrown the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, marched rapidly on Baroda, and captured both the fort and the town. D\u0101m\u0101ji thereupon fell back upon Dabhoi, and busied himself with preparations for reprisals in the direction of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. This raid met with partial success, and he was also fortunate in other expeditions, the result being that Baroda was recaptured in 1734, since which date it has always been in the hands of the Gaikw\u0101rs. After this event the Gaikw\u0101r's power began to develop rapidly, and Abhai Singh was consequently constrained in 1737 to abandon Gujar\u0101t altogether. Thereafter Momin Kh\u0101n, who had succeeded Abhai Singh as Mughal viceroy, but found it difficult to maintain his position at Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, summoned Rangoji, D\u0101m\u0101ji's general, to his assistance, promising that he would, with certain exceptions, grant the Gaikw\u0101r one-half of the revenue of Gujar\u0101t. This viceroy remained the ally of the Gaikw\u0101r until his death, in 1742.\n\nAbout this period D\u0101m\u0101ji's power increased very rapidly, in both Gujar\u0101t and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. This may be inferred from his capture of B\u0101ns\u0101h, near Ahm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d, and from his demonstration against Broach, which was held by an agent for the Niz\u0101m, upon which occasion it is said that he succeeded in obtaining a share in the customs of the city. Moreover as the Sen\u0101pati, Jaswant Rao D\u0101bh\u0101de, had proved utterly incompetent for his situation, D\u0101m\u0101ji held the real power as agent for the late Sen\u0101pati's widow; so much so, that when she died in 1747, he was nominated deputy of the Peshw\u0101 in Gujar\u0101t. It was while his power was thus increasing that D\u0101m\u0101ji was incited to make an inroad into M\u0101lw\u0101, which was very successful. After Momin Kh\u0101n's death, Fida-ud-din was appointed viceroy. He began proceedings by vigorously attacking and defeating Rangoji; but on the return\nof D\u0101m\u0101ji from M\u0101lw\u0101, matters took a turn in favour of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Fida-ud-din fled the country, Rangoji captured Petl\u0101d, and D\u0101m\u0101ji's brother, Khande Rao, established the rights of his family to share in the city of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. Meanwhile, there had been dissensions at Surat, which resulted, in 1751, in a share of the revenue of that city being granted to D\u0101m\u0101ji, an equal share being subsequently allotted to the Peshw\u0101. In 1751 D\u0101m\u0101ji was called upon by T\u0101r\u0101bai of S\u0101t\u0101ra to rescue her grandson, the representative of Sivaji, from the Br\u0101hmans. In response to this request, he at once left Songarh with an army of 15,000 men, and attacked and defeated at Nimba a much stronger force which opposed his march. But disaster afterwards befell him, and he was finally hemmed in by the Peshw\u0101's army. D\u0101m\u0101ji then offered to come to terms with the Peshw\u0101; but the latter, pretending to consider the matter, enticed him into his neighbourhood, and then suddenly seized him and imprisoned him at Poona. The Peshw\u0101 now made great efforts to wrest Gujar\u0101t from the Mughal and the Gaikw\u0101r party; but failing in his attempts, he resolved to come to terms with D\u0101m\u0101ji, and the latter found himself obliged to accept the Peshw\u0101's conditions, which involved the cession of half of Gujar\u0101t and of all future conquests. He was also to maintain 10,000 horse, to assist the Peshw\u0101 in time of need, and to pay 5\u00bd lakhs as tribute. The next event of importance which took place was the campaign of D\u0101m\u0101ji and other powerful Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs in 1753, which resulted in the fall of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. From this time the Mughal authority in Gujar\u0101t practically came to an end, and the country was divided between the Peshw\u0101 and the Gaikw\u0101r, according to the terms previously settled.\n\nD\u0101m\u0101ji Gaikw\u0101r was one of the many great Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs who marched to fight Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni, and in the fatal struggle which took place on the plain of P\u0101nipat (1761) he and his troops distinguished themselves highly. He was fortunate enough to escape death, and to make an honourable return to Gujar\u0101t. There he continued with undiminished vigour to crush the combined efforts of the Musalm\u0101ns, who had hoped to win something by the great disaster which had befallen the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. It was shortly after this that D\u0101m\u0101ji transferred his capital from Songarh to P\u0101tan (the ancient Anhilv\u0101da). Between 1763 and 1766 he took possession of almost the whole of what is now the Kadi pr\u0101nt, and thereafter added very considerably to his power and revenue by conquests in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. He also levied tribute on the States of Idar and R\u0101jpipla. The disaster at P\u0101nipat was shortly followed by the death of the Peshw\u0101 B\u0101l\u0101ji, when the rule passed to the youthful M\u0101dhava Rao, who was soon thwarted by his ambitious uncle, Raghun\u0101th Rao (Raghuba), with whom D\u0101m\u0101ji elected to make a close alliance. But in 1768 M\u0101dhava Rao defeated the allies at Dhodap, and captured Raghun\u0101th Rao and D\u0101m\u0101ji's son, Govind Rao. The most\nonerous terms were again exacted from the Gaikw\u0101r by the Peshw\u0101; and as D\u0101m\u0101ji himself died soon after the battle, it appeared as if the prosperity of his house had come to an end.\n\nD\u0101m\u0101ji left behind him six sons, of whom the eldest, Say\u0101ji Rao, an idiot, and the second, Govind Rao, a weak and vacillating character, at once claimed the gaddi. These rivals were under the necessity of abiding by the arbitration of the Peshw\u0101, who thereupon released Govind Rao from his imprisonment at Poona, and confirmed him in the title, but only after he had agreed to pay a very large sum. In the meantime, Fateh Singh, the youngest son of D\u0101m\u0101ji, occupied the city of Baroda on behalf of Say\u0101ji Rao. In 1771 Fateh Singh proceeded to Poona, and there obtained a revision of the Peshw\u0101's decision. Say\u0101ji Rao, whose position, however, was always merely nominal, was now declared Sena Kh\u0101s Khel, and Fateh Singh was appointed his mut\u0101lik. These arrangements had, however, scarcely been completed, when Khande Rao, a younger son of Pil\u0101ji Gaikw\u0101r, on whom his father had bestowed the governorship of Kadi, began to disturb the country, first assisting one nephew and then the other, just as his policy dictated. Fateh Singh, being under the apprehension that in this disturbed state of affairs the Poona court would have little difficulty in acquiring Gujar\u0101t, returned from Poona to Baroda, and made overtures to the East India Company. In 1772, when Broach was taken by assault by the British, he entered into a treaty with the Bombay Government for a mutual participation in the revenues of the conquered districts. But further proposals of Fateh Singh being refused, he and Govind Rao were left for some time to fight out their quarrel by themselves. In the meanwhile, Raghuba, who had made himself Peshw\u0101, reversed the decision given in favour of Say\u0101ji Rao and recognized his old ally, Govind Rao, as Sena Kh\u0101s Khel. Raghuba himself was soon after ousted from Poona by a Regency established on behalf of his infant grand-nephew (M\u0101dhava Rao II); but in March, 1775, he obtained the support of the Bombay Government by the Treaty of Surat, under the sixth article of which he engaged himself to 'procure from the Gaikw\u0101r a grant to the Company for ever of his share in the revenues of the town and pargana of Broach.' On this treaty being disallowed by the Supreme Government and replaced by the Treaty of Purandhar with the Poona Regency, the rival Gaikw\u0101rs, who had been in continuous conflict, were again left to settle their own disputes. What followed is not accurately known; but the upshot was that in February, 1778, Fateh Singh obtained from Poona the title of Sena Kh\u0101s Khel, and Govind Rao had to be content with a j\u0101gir of 2 lakhs.\n\nFateh Singh devoted the first part of his undisturbed rule to an attempt to get back from the Company Broach and the districts\nadjoining, which had been handed over by the M\u0101r\u0101th\u0101s in virtue of the Treaty of Purandhar (1776); but his efforts were unsuccessful. In 1779 a second war broke out between the Poona Regency and the British, and Fateh Singh entered into an alliance with the latter. This was ratified by a treaty made at Kandila (Dabhoi) in January, 1780, by the terms of which Fateh Singh was to become independent of the Peshw\u0101, and was to retain his own share of Gujar\u0101t, while the British took the Peshw\u0101's portion. This arrangement was afterwards virtually cancelled by the Treaty of S\u0101lbai. In February, 1780, Holkar and Sindhia, as the Peshw\u0101's allies, crossed the Narbad\u0101 and attacked Dabhoi, a town which was bravely defended by Mr. James Forbes (well-known as the author of the Oriental Memoirs). The war afterwards dragged on without any decided results, Fateh Singh remaining faithful to the British, notwithstanding the efforts of Sindhia to win him over. It was concluded by the Treaty of S\u0101lbai (May, 1782), the general effect of which was to leave the Gaikw\u0101r in his old position. He retained what he had before the commencement of the war, but he was for the future to pay tribute to Poona as usual. Fateh Singh died in December, 1789.\n\nIn spite of the remonstrances of Govind Rao, another brother, M\u0101n\u0101j\u012b, at once assumed the reins of government, and paid a large sum to Poona as nazar. Sindhia, however, supported the cause of Govind Rao, and the rivalry between the brothers was kept alive until M\u0101n\u0101j\u012b's death, which occurred in August, 1793. The imbecile Say\u0101ji Rao had died in the previous year. Govind Rao was now allowed to assume, or rather to purchase, the title of Sena Kh\u0101s Khel. The demands made by the Poona court were so heavy that the Company was compelled to interfere in order to prevent the dismemberment of the Baroda State. Before entering his capital, Govind Rao had one more struggle, for a rebellion was raised against him by his own illegitimate son, Kanhoji. The latter was, however, betrayed by his own forces, and was obliged to surrender to his father. Afterwards he escaped and was joined in a fresh insurrection by Malh\u0101r Rao, the son of Khande Rao, previously mentioned, who had died in 1785. But the two quarrelled, Kanhoj\u012b was again betrayed and imprisoned, and Malh\u0101r Rao was forced to purchase peace. The matter of greatest interest which occurred during the rule of Govind Rao was his campaign against Aba Shelukar, who had been entrusted with the revenue management of the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d district on behalf of the Peshw\u0101. Several engagements took place, and finally Shelukar was betrayed by his own troops and imprisoned at Baroda. Hostilities now ceased, and the Peshw\u0101 in 1799, for the first time, leased the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d territory to the Gaikw\u0101r. Shortly afterwards, in September, 1800, Govind Rao died.\n\nAnand Rao, the eldest legitimate son of Govind Rao, succeeded;\nbut he was of weak mind, and his position was soon disputed by his illegitimate brother Kanhoji and the latter's old ally Malh\u0101r Rao. Both parties appealed to the Bombay Government, which decided in favour of Anand Rao; and in April, 1802, a force from Cambay entered Kadi and established Anand Rao's authority. This was the first of many services rendered to the Baroda State by the Bombay Government, and the latter was not slow to claim an ample reward. A treaty was signed in July, 1802, by which considerable territories were ceded to the Company, and the right of British interference in the case of anything improper or unjust being done by Anand Rao or his successors was acknowledged. From this time the authority of the British Resident at Baroda was paramount. It was at the same period that Holkar and Sindhia, who were at war with each other, covered Central India with their armies and threw covetous eyes on Gujar\u0101t. Holkar's attempt was at once frustrated; but Sindhia's designs were more alarming, as he sent an army of 12,000 or 14,000 men in the direction of the northern districts. He was, however, pacified when, with the assistance of the British, he received 10 lakhs which he claimed to be due to him. In 1804 the Peshw\u0101 again renewed the lease of the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d territory to the Gaikw\u0101r, for a term of ten years, at the rental of 4\u00bd lakhs per annum.\n\nIn April, 1805, a definitive treaty was concluded between the British Government and the State of Baroda, by which the establishment of a Subsidiary force and the cession of certain districts for its maintenance were settled. This treaty also contained articles to the effect that the foreign policy of the State should be conducted by the British, and that all differences with the Peshw\u0101 should be similarly arranged. Fateh Singh, a younger brother of Anand Rao, became a member of the State council in 1807, and gradually exercised increased powers. In 1812 the celebrated Gang\u0101dhar S\u0101stri became Minister. The restless intriguer, Kanhoji, again endeavoured to subvert his brother's administration; but the plot was discovered in good time, and Kanhoji was arrested and promptly deported to Madras. The long-pending claims of the Peshw\u0101 on the Gaikw\u0101r now came up for settlement; and, as the political relations between the States were anything but friendly, it was feared that the lease of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d would not be renewed. Gang\u0101dhar S\u0101stri was accordingly deputed to negotiate at Poona. As a result of intrigues, set on foot by Sit\u0101r\u0101m, a dismissed Minister of Baroda, the Peshw\u0101 refused to listen to the terms offered by the S\u0101stri, assigned the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d farm to Trimbakji Danglia, and left all other points unsettled. While negotiations were still being carried on, Gang\u0101dhar S\u0101stri was murdered. An attempt at a revolution in Sit\u0101r\u0101m's favour followed, but it proved abortive, and finally in 1816 the ex-Minister was deported to Navs\u0101ri.\nA confederacy of the great Mar\u0101th\u0101 chiefs had now been formed, and the Peshw\u0101 was tampering with Fateh Singh, while his agents were causing disturbances in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. The question of the Peshw\u0101's claims on the Gaikw\u0101r was opened afresh, and matters proceeded so far that every preparation for war between the British and the Peshw\u0101 had been made, when the latter suddenly gave way, the result being that a treaty was signed at Poona in 1817. Under this the Gaikw\u0101r became independent of the Peshw\u0101, who surrendered all past claims for an annual payment of 4 lakhs, the tribute of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r was ceded to the British, and Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d was farmed in perpetuity to the Gaikw\u0101r for 4\u00bd lakhs per annum. In November of the same year a supplemental treaty was entered into with the Gaikw\u0101r, by which the latter consented to make additions to the Subsidiary force, ceded his share of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d on payment of its estimated value, and obtained the province of Okh\u0101mandal and the island of Beyt, &c. It is unnecessary to describe here the wars which ensued almost immediately with B\u0101j\u012b Rao Peshw\u0101, the R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101gpur, the Pind\u0101ri hordes, and Holkar, during which Fateh Singh behaved as a stanch ally of the British. The reward for his valuable aid was the remission of the tribute of 4 lakhs, due to the Peshw\u0101, whose power was now destroyed. Shortly afterwards, in 1818, Fateh Singh died, and was succeeded in the regency by his younger brother, Say\u0101ji Rao. Anand Rao himself died in 1819, and Say\u0101ji Rao ruled in his own name.\n\nIn 1820 the commission, which, with the Resident at its head, had carried on the administration during the reign of Anand Rao, was abolished, and the Gaikw\u0101r appointed two Ministers, but, as he trusted neither, employed M\u012br Sarfar\u0101z Al\u012b to watch them both. The State was, however, in great pecuniary embarrassment; and as the Gaikw\u0101r refused to follow the advice of the Resident, affairs, both financial and political, rapidly grew worse. After much delay Say\u0101ji Rao consented to the issue of septennial leases of the mah\u0101uls to respectable men, instead of annual leases to persons of doubtful means and position. The intrigues which followed the adoption of this reform led to the dismissal of one of the Ministers and the appointment of two joint Diw\u0101ns. In 1828 Sir John Malcolm, Governor of Bombay, issued a proclamation announcing the temporary sequestration of Petl\u0101d, Dabhoi, Kadi, Amreli, &c., the annual value of which was estimated at 10 lakhs. And again in 1830, districts to the annual value of about 10 lakhs were attached, in order to provide for the reorganization of the Contingent of 3,000 horse; but this second sequestration was disapproved by the Court of Directors in 1832, and the territory was restored. In 1831 Sir John Malcolm was succeeded by Lord Clare, who attempted by conciliatory measures to undo the consequences of his predecessor's severity. Steps were taken to satisfy the creditors\nof the State, and the Gaikw\u0101r pledged himself to keep the Contingent in an efficient condition. Unfortunately, however, a period of misgovernment again began, and all remonstrances were unheeded. The deposition of Say\u0101ji Rao was contemplated in 1838, but in 1839 he made a complete submission and expressed his desire to conform to the wishes of the Government. A better system of administration was introduced into that portion of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r which belonged to the Gaikw\u0101r, and compensation was paid for robberies committed by Baroda subjects. But corrupt practices still prevailed at Baroda, not only in and about the court, but also in the Resident's office, and intrigues were rampant.\n\nIn 1847 Say\u0101ji was succeeded by his eldest son, Ganpat Rao, who introduced many reforms into the State. Influenced by the Resident, he built roads, bridges, and sarais, planted wayside trees, prohibited infanticide and the sale of children, settled claims for robberies committed in the State, and generally pursued a path of progress. In 1854 the political supervision of Baroda was transferred from the Government of Bombay to the Supreme Government. The last year of Ganpat Rao's life (1856) was marked by his cession of land required for the construction of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway.\n\nAs Ganpat Rao left no legitimate male issue, he was succeeded by the eldest of his surviving brothers, Khande Rao. During the Mutiny the young Gaikw\u0101r stood stanchly by the British, and assisted in maintaining peace and security in Gujar\u0101t. In 1862 he received the right of adoption. He was also created a G.C.S.I. Khande Rao, especially at the beginning of his reign, desired to improve the administration of the State, and introduced some beneficial changes; but his fondness for the chase, jewels, displays, and buildings left him no money to spend on useful public works. However, he constructed the branch railway from Miy\u0101g\u0101m to Dabhoi, attempted to improve the land revenue system, and commenced a revenue survey.\n\nAt the time of Khande Rao's death in 1870, his brother Malh\u0101r Rao, who had been engaged in a plot for his deposition, was a prisoner at P\u0101dra. But as he was the undisputed heir in default of legitimate sons, he was at once released and proclaimed Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. From the outset Malh\u0101r Rao determined to take revenge for the sufferings he had endured at P\u0101dra, and consequently ill-treated Khande Rao's servants and dependents. The administration rapidly deteriorated, the weight of taxation was increased, and folly, extravagance, and cruelty prevailed. The Bombay Government, to which the direction of affairs in Baroda had been restored in 1860, appointed Colonel Phayre as Resident, who devoted all his energies to exposing abuses. As a result of Colonel Phayre's strong representations, the Government of India appointed\na Commission of inquiry, which reported that the charge of general maladministration was proved. Malh\u0101r Rao was warned that he would be held responsible, and called upon to effect thorough reforms before the end of 1875. In consequence of the strained relations between the Resident and the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, it was determined to appoint Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly, in place of Colonel Phayre, as Special Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General. Meanwhile, in November, 1874, an attempt to poison Colonel Phayre was reported. Sir Lewis Pelly arrived in December and assumed the virtual direction of the administration. Inquiries were made into the poisoning case; and the Government of India issued a proclamation in January, 1875, notifying that the Gaikw\u0101r had been arrested, and that, pending the result of an investigation by a Commission, they had assumed the administration of the State. The Commission, which was presided over by Sir Richard Couch, Chief Justice of Bengal, was not unanimous in its finding. The three English members came to the conclusion that an attempt to poison Colonel Phayre had been instigated by Malh\u0101r Rao, while the three native members did not consider him guilty. It was finally decided, as stated in a proclamation issued in 1875, that the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 must be deposed, 'not because the British Government have assumed that the result of the inquiry has been to prove the truth of the imputation against His Highness, but because, having regard to all the circumstances relating to the affairs of Baroda from the accession of His Highness Malh\u0101r Rao, his notorious misconduct, his gross misgovernment of the State, and his evident incapacity to carry into effect necessary reforms,' the step was imperatively called for. In accordance with this resolution, Malh\u0101r Rao was at once deported to Madras, where he resided under the surveillance of a British officer until his death in 1893.\n\nJamn\u0101bai, widow of Khande Rao, returned to Baroda, and, with the consent of the Government of India, formally adopted as the son and heir of Khande Rao, with the name of Say\u0101ji Rao, a boy of thirteen years of age, who was descended from a distant branch of the family. During his minority the administration was conducted by R\u0101j\u0101 Sir T. M\u0101dhava Rao as D\u012bw\u0101n, and great reforms were inaugurated in every branch of the service. The finances were restored to a healthy condition, an efficient revenue system was introduced, vexatious taxes were swept away, the judicial, police, medical, and educational departments were reorganized, the system of railways was widely extended, and public buildings were erected in all parts of the State. In 1881 Say\u0101ji Rao, whose education had been carefully supervised by a European tutor, was formally installed and invested with full powers. He immediately commenced his career by entering vigorously into every detail of the administration, as will be described below. He\nbears the hereditary title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, and is entitled to a salute of 21 guns.\n\nThe style of architecture, as in the rest of Gujar\u0101t, is that sometimes called Jain, though many of the finest temples are Hindu. It is remarkable that the art is still living, and has not been replaced by inferior work in brick and plaster, as in some parts of India. The temples are distinguished by tapering spires or sikharas, ornamented gateways, halls or mandapas, and ornamental archways in front of the main buildings. The earliest buildings were probably of brick; but later the sandstone of northern K\u0101thi\u0101war came into use, while white marble was also employed, though the latter material has been carried away and burnt for lime. Many temples were destroyed by the Muhammadans. The chief remains now existing are at P\u0101tan, Siddhpur, Modhera, Dabhoi, and Vadnagar; but a number of places still await examination.\n\nThe table on p. 77 shows the chief statistics of population in 1901. The density of population for the whole State is 229 persons per square mile, ranging from 147 in Amreli to 288 in the Baroda prant, excluding the city. In the small island of Beyt and in the city of Baroda the density is far greater, rising to 1,153 and 11,532 persons per square mile. The rural population is about three times as great as that of the towns.\n\nIn 1872 the population was estimated at 2,004,442, while in 1881 it was 2,185,005, an increase of 9 per cent. In 1891 the number further rose to 2,415,396, or by 10.7 per cent. Ten years later the population was only 1,952,692, a decrease of 19 per cent. This diminution, chiefly due to the effects of plague and famine, was not uniform for all parts of the State; for while in Amreli and Navs\u0101ri the decrease was 3.7 per cent. and 5.9 per cent. respectively, in Baroda it was 22.8 per cent. and in Kadi 24 per cent. The city of Baroda lost 10.8 per cent. of its population in the same period.\n\nOf the total population in 1901, 1,546,992 were returned as Hindus, 176,250 as Animists, 165,014 as Musalm\u0101ns, 48,290 as Jains, 8,409 as P\u0101rs\u012bs, 7,691 as Christians, 38 as Sikhs, and 8 as Jews. Taking the three main sects of Hindus, Saivas numbered 276,489, S\u0101ktas 260,096, and Vaishnavas 1,010,351. The Jains are divided into three sects: the Swet\u0101mbari with 34,410 adherents, the Digambari with 9,599, and the Dh\u016bndhia with 4,281. Musalm\u0101ns have two main sects: the Sunnis, 129,508, and the Shias, 35,506. The P\u0101rs\u012bs may also be divided into two sects: the Shahansh\u0101his (or Shenshais), 6,010 in number, and the Kad\u012bmis, 2,399. Animists include all members of the forest tribes who are neither Hindus, Musalm\u0101ns, nor Christians.\n\nThe age statistics, as elsewhere, are unreliable, and only a few\ngeneral conclusions can be drawn from the results of the Census. Of the total population, children under the age of 5 formed only 10 per cent., those from 5 to 15 formed 25 per cent., adults between 15 and 40 formed 45 per cent., and those above 40 formed 20 per cent. These figures point to the effects of famine, and a comparison between the statistics of 1891 and 1901 shows still more clearly the disastrous nature of the decade. While the decrease in population at all ages was 19\u00b72 per cent., the number of children under 10 fell by 35\u00b76 per cent., and the number of persons over 60 by 40\u00b76 per cent. The mean age for males is 23\u00b756, and for females 23\u00b776.\n\nExcept in the city of Baroda, no rules are in force requiring the registration of births or deaths, but it has been the custom for the police and p\u0101tels to make monthly reports through the t\u0101huka officers to the Sanitary Commissioner. More effective regulations have, however, been made for the future. In 1899\u20131900 the recorded birth-rate was 13 per thousand, and the death-rate 54\u00b75. That year was, however, one of great distress, and during the previous five years mortality had averaged only 17\u00b77 per thousand. In 1904\u20135 the births reported were 22\u00b73 per thousand and the deaths 24\u00b77. More than half the deaths are ascribed to fever, but the diagnosis, as usual, is faulty. Guinea-worm is common in Okh\u0101mandal and Kodin\u0101r. Epidemics of cholera and small-pox are not uncommon, and 39,300 deaths from the former and 6,300 from the latter disease were recorded in the decade ending 1900\u20131.\n\nPlague made its first appearance in the latter part of 1897, and since that time has caused considerable ravages. By the end of 1904\u20135 the number of deaths due to this cause alone was 44,251, but here again the statistics are not very trustworthy. The worst year was 1903\u20134, in which nearly 15,000 deaths were recorded. In the beginning of the plague epidemic the measures resorted to by the State were much the same as those adopted in British territory. A great portion of the city of Baroda was evacuated, and the people were located in sheds erected in fields outside. Persons coming from other affected parts were quarantined for a minimum period of ten days. All houses were whitewashed, and disinfectants were freely used. A similar course was adopted at Petl\u0101d, Navs\u0101ri, and other towns. But as forcible segregation and other coercive proceedings led to no appreciable benefit, the only preventive measures now in force are thorough cleansing, disinfection, and the distribution of medicine.\n\nMales exceed females by 64,576, the former numbering 1,008,634 and the latter 944,058. This deficiency of females is a characteristic of Gujar\u0101t generally. Taking the different religions, it appears that among the Hindus there are 929 females to every 1,000 males, among the Jains 951, among the Musalm\u0101ns 956, among the Christians 819,\nand among the Animists 971. The Parsis form an exception, the rates for this community being 1,265 females per 1,000 males.\n\nOf the whole population, 35\u00b72 per cent. of both sexes are unmarried, 50\u00b71 per cent. married, and 14\u00b77 per cent. widowed. The following table compares the actual numbers of either sex in 1891 and 1901:\n\n|       | 1891          |       | 1901          |\n|-------|---------------|-------|---------------|\n|       | Persons       | Males | Females      | Persons       | Males | Females |\n| Married| 1,287,575    | 646,315| 641,260     | 978,626       | 487,550| 491,076 |\n| Unmarried| 889,992    | 541,592| 348,400     | 687,211       | 422,115| 264,796 |\n| Widowed| 237,829     | 65,076| 172,753     | 286,855       | 98,669 | 188,186 |\n\nAmong Hindus the first decade of life includes 1,584 widows and 21,431 wives, while the next age period (10-15) includes 4,287 widows and 54,955 wives. Thus before reaching what is considered in most countries the marriageable age, there are already in this State 5,871 widows and 76,386 girl-wives. At each age-period the number of widows increases until the maximum is reached at the ages 40-5. The number of widowers is also greatest at this period. Nearly 51 per cent. of Hindus are married, 48 per cent. of Jains and Musalmans, 47 per cent. of Animists, and 44 per cent. of Parsis.\n\nEvery Hindu considers that his eternal welfare depends upon his having a son, while the custom of marrying girls at a tender age is very common. Hence arise early and unequal marriages, polygamy, early maternity, a high birth-rate, a terrible mortality among children and child-mothers, early decay in both sexes, and a surplus of widows. Steps have, however, been taken to minimize these evils by the passing of Acts to legalize the remarriage of widows (1902), and to discourage the marriage of infants (1904). The latter measure forbids the marriage of girls under 12, except with the permission of a court, and in the first year of working 718 offenders were fined under its provisions. In such castes as the Audichya Brahmins polygamy prevails, because the number of marriageable girls is greater than that of the males. Polygamy is also found among the Rajputs and some other castes. Divorce is allowed among many castes of Hindus, especially the lower ones which permit widow remarriage. Sometimes it is obtained under caste rules, while at other times people resort to the courts.\n\nPractically the whole population speak languages of the Indo-European family, only 453 speakers of Dravidian languages, 4 of Mongolian languages, and 153 of Semitic languages being recorded. In the first group the number of persons speaking Gujarati is 1,773,594, Marathi 38,605, and Hindustani or Urdu 68,815. There are also many Bhil and Gipsy dialects, the former being spoken by 68,503 persons.\nAt the Census of 1901 castes were classified, according to the traditional arrangement, in four groups. Br\u0101hmans number 145,000, or 9 per cent. of the total Hindu population. The principal class is that of Gujar\u0101ti Br\u0101hmans, who number 128,000. Mar\u0101th\u0101 Br\u0101hmans are comparatively numerous (14,000). The representatives of the Kshatriyas (106,200) were arranged according to their traditional occupations as warriors (90,500), traders (11,500), and writers (4,200), the first class containing 59,000 Rajputs. Similarly the Vaisyas (459,000) may be divided into Bani\u0101s or traders (48,000), and Kunb\u012bs (411,000), who are agriculturists. The S\u016bdras are divided into \u2018clean\u2019 castes and \u2018unclean.\u2019 Among the former are found a large number of occupational groups, none of which is singly of great importance except the Kol\u012bs (325,000). More than half the unclean classes are included in the Dheds (94,000). Most of the Jains are Bani\u0101s (39,500). The Animists differ in physical type from the Hindus and Jains, being short in stature, with broad flat noses and faces, and much darker in colour. The most numerous of these tribes are the G\u0101mits (38,200), Bhils (37,700), Dubl\u0101s (28,500), and Chodhr\u0101s (23,300). Among Musalm\u0101ns the most numerous groups are Arabs (29,700) and Shaikhs (56,700), the latter being largely descended from Hindu ancestors.\n\nThe Gir\u0101si\u0101s, K\u0101this, Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and W\u0101ghers, whose traditional occupation is military service, have maintained this to some extent, but nowadays many have taken to agricultural or other pursuits. The cultivators, who are generally Kunb\u012bs, Kol\u012bs, or M\u0101lis, scarcely ever follow any other occupation. The Rab\u0101ris, again, who are graziers and cultivators, remain almost constant to their hereditary employment, only 10 per cent. resorting to other occupations. With the Br\u0101hmans the case is different, as many of the caste have taken largely to agriculture. Most of the Prabhus or writers are employed in service, while about one-third of the Bani\u0101s still follow their traditional occupation of trade and commerce, the remainder devoting themselves to service and agriculture.\n\nOf the total population, the number of actual workers of both sexes is about 47 per cent., and of these nearly 68 per cent. are males. Agriculture and pasture support 54 per cent. of the people, the preparation and supply of material substances 14 per cent., unskilled labour 13 per cent., personal services 5 per cent., and commerce 4 per cent.\n\nThe staple food of the higher-class Hindus consists generally of rice, wheat, pulse, and bajra. Vegetables of all kinds are freely used, cooked with gh\u012b, salt, spices, turmeric, &c. Cakes made from bajra and wheat-flour are partaken of with milk, for both dinner and supper. Among agriculturists, however, the usual food is khichri (a spiced mixture of rice and tuver) and curry. The poorer classes use jow\u0101r as their chief food-grain, and also kodra, bavto, and banti.\nDhotars or waistcloths form the common dress of Hindus. The upper garments worn by males of the better class are badans and bandis reaching from the neck to the waist, and angarkhas extending as far as the knees. Many educated Hindus, however, now wear shirts, coats, and pantaloons. Females wear chaniyas or petticoat sall\u00e1s, and cholis or bodices with sleeves as far as the elbows. The poorer classes do not use cholis.\n\nIn large towns the dwelling-houses are often situated in court-yards with one entrance only, called khadkis. This was necessitated by the want of safety in former days. The houses of the rich are built of brick, and have usually two storeys and an average of seven rooms. The poor live in mud huts with one floor only, and usually two rooms.\n\nThe chief outdoor games played by the young are gilli-dando, attiso-mattiso, amla-pipli, &c. These all involve running and catching, and are very popular. In towns indoor amusements, such as cards, chess, &c., are more resorted to.\n\nThe Dew\u0101li holidays, which occur during October or November, are the most noteworthy of the Hindu festivals. The temples are filled with devotees, the people put on their best attire, and the streets and houses are illuminated with lamps. At this time merchants and shopkeepers worship their account-books and open new ones. The Holi takes place in February or March, the Makar Sankr\u0101nti in January. Other festivals are the Mah\u0101 Sivar\u0101tri, the R\u0101ma Navami, and the Janma Ashtami. In the city of Baroda the Muhammadan festival of the Muharram is patronized by the Gaikw\u0101r, and many Hindus join in the procession. But the greatest of all attractions to the people is probably the Dasara procession, which generally takes place in October.\n\nThe soils are mainly alluvial, except in the hilly parts of the Navs\u0101ri and Amreli pr\u0101nts, and in the south-east corner of the Baroda pr\u0101nt, where they are mostly formed by the disintegration of the underlying rocks. These alluvial soils may roughly be divided into gor\u0101t or light red (sand and sandy loams), bes\u0101r or mixed (loams), and k\u0101li or black. The land is generally flat, here and there relieved by small hills, and in consequence the ground is easy to work. This, however, is not the case in the r\u0101ni mah\u0101ls of the Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt, which are mountainous, or in the eastern parts of the Baroda pr\u0101nt, which are hilly and wooded. The rainfall in different parts has already been referred to.\n\nCrops are mainly divided into the \u2018rains\u2019 or kharif crops and the \u2018dry\u2019 or rabi crops. The former are sown in June or July, and reaped in October or November; the latter are sown in October or November, and reaped in March or April. In the Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt the gor\u0101t lands\nproduce all kinds of *jar\u0101vat* or 'dry' and *b\u0101g\u012byat* or garden crops, while the crops raised on black soil are rice, cotton, *jow\u0101r*, wheat, *tuver*, *b\u0101jra*, and *adad*. Of these, rice and cotton flourish best, the remaining crops being deficient in out-turn and of inferior quality. In the Baroda *pr\u0101nt*, K\u0101hnam is famous for its superior black soil, which produces cotton and rice in abundance. This soil requires no manure, and is not irrigated, so that garden cultivation does not exist. The *gor\u0101t* soil is generally irrigated, and wherever this is possible it yields large returns. It is specially utilized for the growth of *b\u0101jra*. The best kind of *gor\u0101t* is found near Petl\u0101d, in Charotar, and is especially suited to tobacco. In the Kadi *pr\u0101nt* the soil is well adapted for the cultivation of poppy for opium, and in Amreli for the cultivation of cotton. The agricultural implements used in different parts of the State are of simple construction. They include the mattock (*kod\u0101li*), the hoe (*kharpi*), the small plough (*hol*), the large plough (*n\u0101gar*), and the sickle (*d\u0101tardu*). The small plough serves only to scratch up the surface of the soil. The *n\u0101gar*, which resembles the *hol* in construction but is much heavier, is employed mostly in the cultivation of sugar-cane.\n\nIn the whole State 1,014,027 persons, or 52 per cent. of the total, are supported by agriculture, of whom 45 per cent. are actual workers and 55 per cent. are dependents. The proportion is lowest in the Amreli *pr\u0101nt* (40.7 per cent.), as the soil here is difficult to work. It rises to 66.2 per cent. in Navs\u0101ri, because the only pursuit followed by the forest tribes, who are numerous there, is agriculture.\n\nThe principal crops are rice (*Oryza sativa*), *b\u0101jra* (*Pennisetum typhoideum*), *jow\u0101r* (*Sorghum vulgare*), wheat (*Triticum sativum*), *math* (*Phaseolus aconitifolius*), gram (*Cicer arietinum*), *adad* (*Phaseolus radiatus*), *tuver* (*Cajanus indicus*), *v\u0101l* (*Dolichos Lablab*), *chola* (*Vigna Catiang*), *kodra* (*Paspalum scrobiculatum*), *n\u0101gli* (*Eleusine coracana*), *bavto* (*Panicum frumentaceum*), *banti* (*Panicum spicatum*), *vatana* (*Pisum sativum*), *mag* (*Phaseolus Mungo*), castor-oil (*Ricinus communis*), *til* (*Sesamum indicum*), rapeseed (*Brassica campestris*), poppy (*Papaver somniferum*), cotton (*Gossypium herbaceum*), san-hemp (*Crotalaria juncea*), tobacco (*Nicotiana Tabacum*), sugar-cane (*Saccharum officinarum*), maize (*Zea Mays*), and *kasumbo* (*Carthamus tinctorius*).\n\nRice is generally manured with from five to ten cartloads of cattle-dung per *bigha*\\(^1\\). When available, tank mud is used as manure at the rate of ten to fifteen cartloads per *bigha*. With this treatment, it is calculated that from the best rice soils a return of 12 cwt. per acre may be expected. The crop is sown in June and July, and harvested in November.\n\n*B\u0101jra*, which is the staple food of the people, is generally sown as a mixed crop, except in Amreli. The land is manured either every\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Seven *bighas* are equal to 4 acres.\nyear, or every alternate year, with farm-yard manure, at the rate of five or six cartloads per bigha. The average yield per acre is from 5 to 9 cwt. It is sown in June and July, and harvesting begins in October.\n\nFor the growth of jowar, another staple food, five to eight cartloads of cattle manure are applied to each bigha, and the yield varies from 4 to 9 cwt. per acre. It is usually sown in July and harvested from November.\n\nIn Navsari wheat is grown without irrigation, while in Baroda, Kadi, and Amreli irrigation is necessary. In Amreli farm-yard manure is directly applied to the land set apart for wheat, but in other parts manure is used only for the kharif crops sown before the wheat. Of this grain there are about five kinds, and the yield varies from 4 to 11 cwt. per acre. It is sown in October and November, and reaped in March.\n\nGram is usually sown after the rice has been harvested, and gives an out-turn of from 7 to 11 cwt. per acre. It is sown in November and harvested in March.\n\nTuver is generally grown in gorat soil, the average yield being about 5 cwt. per acre. It is sown in June and July, and harvesting begins in January.\n\nThe best kind of rapeseed is grown in Kadi, on land which has been left fallow for four months. It is a crop which does not require any watering, and gives a yield of from 400 to 600 lb. per acre. It is sown in November and reaped in March.\n\nIt is a general rule when cotton is grown on black soil that the field remains fallow for one year, so that every year in cotton-producing tracts half the cultivable land remains untilled. It is generally sown mixed with rice in Baroda, and after the latter has been harvested the cotton grows rapidly. No manure is required, and the yield is from 4 to 6 cwt. per acre. Roji or indigenous cotton is also grown on gorat soil, and in this case farm-yard manure is applied. It is sown in June and July, and picking takes place in February and March, sometimes as early as December, and sometimes as late as April, according to the rainfall.\n\nIn the growth of sugar-cane a rotation is always observed. Its production so impoverishes the soil that it is not planted again in the same field for at least four or five years. In the Baroda prant san-hemp or jowar is sown as a green manure in the monsoon, and in winter the fields are ploughed and prepared for sugar-cane. In Navsari and Amreli the method followed is much the same, though the green crops previously sown are different. The juice of the cane is turned into molasses, a product widely exported to all parts of Gujar\u00e2t. In Navsari the canes are cut in November or December after a year's growth.\nTobacco is a staple produce of Petl\u0101d and the vicinity. It is grown in gor\u016bt soil and requires frequent irrigation, as well as from twelve to fifteen cartloads of farm-yard manure per bigha. In Petl\u0101d the crop can be grown continuously on the same field for some years; and then an interval of two years, during which rice or bajra is planted, must elapse before tobacco can again be sown. The yield is from 7 to 10 cwt. per acre. It is sown in nurseries in June, transplanted in about a couple of months, and cut in February or March.\n\nPoppy is grown in Kadi. Land intended for this crop is generally left fallow for about four months and ploughed several times before the seed is sown. In some places, however, it is usual to take a crop of bajra before utilizing the land for poppy. Manure is applied at the rate of twelve to fifteen cartloads per bigha every third year, and irrigation is necessary. The average yield is estimated at 12 lb. of crude opium per acre; but the out-turn is always a matter of uncertainty, as this crop is easily influenced by changes of weather. Poppy is sown in October or November, and the collection of the juice takes place in February and March.\n\nDuring the rainy season various species of Cucurbitaceae, suran or elephant-foot, sweet potatoes, &c., are grown; but most garden crops mature in the cold season or early summer. Potatoes are planted in small patches near the large towns. They require manure in the form of cattle-dung, oilcake, and night-soil, and also irrigation. Brinjals and chillies are cultivated wherever irrigation is available, the brinjals of K\u0101thor being especially famous. Onions are abundant, a white variety being largely cultivated in the Amreli pr\u0101nt at Kodin\u0101r. Garlic and radishes are plentiful everywhere. Ginger is largely grown in Baroda and Navs\u0101ri. For this crop it is found that bundles of rotten hemp form an excellent manure. Carrots are cultivated everywhere, and in some parts, chiefly in Amreli, are used exclusively for fodder. Various native vegetables are grown in abundance, and of late years tomatoes have been introduced. Among the chief fruits are the mango, plantain, pomegranate, pummelo, guava, pineapple, lime, custard-apple, fig, and melon.\n\nA table attached to this article (p. 77) gives statistics of cultivation for a series of years. In 1904\u20135 the total cultivated area was 3,751 square miles, of which cotton occupied 24 per cent., and bajra and jow\u0101r about 20 per cent. each.\n\nA State Agricultural department has been established, under a Director, to give assistance to the cultivators in all possible ways. A large farm, with a school attached, has been founded at Baroda, where assistant masters of vernacular schools are trained as agricultural teachers in village schools, a few officials are instructed in the principles of entomological research, and agriculture is taught to ordinary students.\nAt Songarh also a school has been opened, and the farm attached to it is entirely worked by the students. A class for sericulture was opened in 1904. The department also concerns itself with cattle-breeding, and the establishment of seed and manure d\u00e9p\u00f4ts. Travelling instructors have been appointed who lecture to cultivators, and endeavour to introduce new crops and improved methods and implements. The most successful innovation so far has been the introduction of the potato, but selected seed of crops already grown is also in demand. A State entomologist was appointed in 1905.\n\nExperiments in agriculture are carried on at the Baroda and Songarh model farms, and occasionally in the fields of intelligent cultivators. At the Baroda farm attention is chiefly paid to the improved growth of the principal crops of the vicinity, and also to the curing of tobacco leaf, while at Songarh jow\u0101r, rice, and cotton are mostly experimented on. The cultivators take much interest in these farms, and have begun to imitate some of the improved processes followed there.\n\nAdvances are regularly made for agricultural improvements, especially the construction of wells. In ordinary years from 1 to 2 lakhs are provided for this purpose, the loans being repayable in thirty years, and no interest being charged for advances of less than Rs. 500. Advances are also made, at easy rates, for the purchase of seed and bullocks, amounting to about 2\u00bd lakhs in 1902\u20133 and 1903\u20134. Owing to the unfavourable season larger amounts were advanced in 1904\u20135, the total being 4.8 lakhs.\n\nAgricultural banks have been opened at Songarh (1899) and Harij (1900), which are practically financed and managed by the State. Advances in cash or kind are made to cultivators at the rate of 6\u00bc per cent. interest, and the State profits are limited to 3 per cent., the surplus being credited to a reserve or distributed as a bonus. The banks also buy and sell produce and agricultural requisites. About Rs. 18,000 was advanced in 1904\u20135. An Act to regulate the formation of co-operative credit societies has recently been passed.\n\nThe indebtedness of the cultivators is considerable, and few men with average holdings do not owe something to the money-lender. Money is borrowed by the poorer ryots not merely for marriage and other festivals, but also for the purchase of grain and manure. The ordinary rate of interest varies from 9 to 15 per cent. As in British India, the cultivators still deal largely with money-lenders, instead of applying for loans from the State. Advances are regularly given to cultivators of poppy.\n\nThe horses and ponies of the country are very indifferent. The best breeds are to be found in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. Two breeds of cattle may be mentioned, the Desi and the K\u0101nkreji. The former are found in all parts of the Baroda and Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101ntas. They are of small size, the\ncows give little milk, and the bullocks, though fast, are unfit for heavy draught. The K\u0101nkreji breed is well-known throughout Gujar\u0101t, and is much esteemed for the size of the bullocks. These large and powerful animals are suited for ploughing and other heavy work. Good bullocks of this breed sometimes sell for Rs. 200 to Rs. 250 a pair. In the Amreli pr\u0101nt the Gir cattle are the most celebrated. They are smaller than the K\u0101nkreji kind, but the milch cows give a rich and abundant supply of milk. Buffaloes, goats, and sheep are kept everywhere, but there is nothing special to be noted about them. An attempt has been made to improve the breed of buffaloes.\n\nIn many villages pasture land is set apart for cattle. Bullocks employed in heavy work are fed on hay, millet stalks, and sometimes gram. Cotton-seed is given to buffaloes to increase the supply of milk. Grass is generally abundant in all parts of the State; but in the recent famines it failed, and many cattle were lost. Fairs are held in a few places for the sale of cattle. The most important is the weekly fair at Baroda.\n\nThe two most prominent cattle epidemics are rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. The former proves fatal in nearly all cases, while the latter is not so dangerous. There are two veterinary dispensaries, at Baroda city and Mehs\u0101na. The surgeons in charge are required to tour when cattle-disease breaks out, and give their advice and assistance. In 1904\u20135 the total number of animals treated in the dispensaries was 2,049.\n\nWith the exception of the black cotton soil, all the cultivable lands can be irrigated. The chief crops which require irrigation are tobacco, sugar-cane, poppy, and vegetables. Even the black cotton soil repays irrigation if water can be had at moderate depths.\n\nThe irrigation works constructed by the State include a number of tanks, with small distributing channels. Some of the larger works have not been successful, owing to deficient rainfall or the need for further storage reservoirs and other subsidiary works. The most important is a reservoir at Kadarpur in the Kadi pr\u0101nt, which cost 3-8 lakhs, and will irrigate about 1,500 acres. The largest project is the Orsang weir in the Sankheda t\u0101luka, which supplies a canal 6 miles long, and is designed to irrigate 20,000 acres. It has cost 5\u00b72 lakhs up to the present, and the completed works will cost about 20 lakhs. Indigenous irrigation is chiefly carried on by means of wells, as very few tanks hold a considerable supply of water after the close of the cold season. The country is not wanting in streams; but most of them either run dry in the summer months, or fall so low that water cannot be conveyed by canals to the land. The usual water-lift is a large leathern bag containing about 16 gallons of water, which is drawn up by a pair of bullocks moving down an incline. Two men are required, one to drive\nthe bullocks, and the other to empty the bag when it has arrived at the top of the well. The Persian wheel is also occasionally used. Where water is near the surface, it is raised in a supde or charaidu. The former is a rectangular vessel with a rope on each side, worked by two men, who simply scoop the water up. The charaidu is a vessel with its length greater than its breadth, and having one end broader than the other. It is fixed on a pivot, and the broad end is lowered into the water and then raised, so that the water flows down. The average cost of a masonry well varies from Rs. 200 to Rs. 2,000, while that of an unbricked well varies from Rs. 10 to Rs. 35, according to the depth of spring-level. The total irrigated area is estimated at 184,283 acres.\n\nIn addition to the land revenue, a cess is levied on irrigation. This takes different forms. In some tracts the cess is levied at varying rates according to the depth of subsoil water. In others all land round a well is charged, while sometimes the rate is paid on the well itself as long as it is used for irrigation. The nominal demand is about 2.7 lakhs, but scarcely half this sum is recovered.\n\nThe greater part of the State is held on ryotwari tenure, and the payments made by the cultivators are thus revenue rather than rent. Holders of large areas, however, being unable or unwilling to cultivate the whole of their land themselves, sublet to others at the highest rates they can obtain. In prosperous years the rents thus paid are sometimes double or treble the State assessment on the land. Persons holding on the narva, bhagdar, or bharkhali tenures, described below under Land Revenue (p. 64), also collect rent from the actual cultivators. In all these cases rent is sometimes paid in kind, at the rate of one-third or one-half of the crop grown.\n\nAmong skilled labourers the carpenter earns the highest wages. At Baroda his daily pay varies from 10 annas to a rupee or more, while elsewhere he receives from 8 to 12 annas. A blacksmith gets from 10 to 13 annas a day at Baroda, and 6 to 9 annas in other parts of the State. A mason can earn daily at Baroda from 10 to 14 annas, or from 8 to 12 annas outside the city. The rates for other classes of skilled labour vary from 4 to 6 annas. The wages of agricultural labour are fairly uniform throughout the State, varying from 3 to 4 annas a day. Labourers who work as porters earn similar amounts, but at Baroda and other important places which have railway stations their earnings often exceed 8 annas. The wages of other labourers vary from 2 to 3 annas a day.\n\nPayment of wages in kind still prevails, especially in villages. Agricultural labourers who are permanent servants are provided by their masters with food, clothing, &c., and a small annual cash payment. Casual labour, at the time of weeding and harvest, is in some places\nremunerated by cooked food once a day in addition to a small cash payment. Again, at marriages or on other occasions villagers often secure the services of artisans and labourers in return for their food and a small money allowance.\n\nStatistics of prices for a series of years are not available. There is little variation in different parts of the State. The following table gives average prices for the whole State, in seers per rupee:\n\n|        | Wheat | Rice | Bajra | Jowar |\n|--------|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 1902-3 | 11    | 9    | 16    | 18    |\n| 1904-5 | 12    | 9    | 14    | 16    |\n\nAs far as material condition is concerned, the people of the r\u0101sti (peaceful and populous) mah\u0101ls of Navs\u0101ri stand foremost. There are many well-to-do P\u0101rs\u012bs in this tract. Baroda comes next, while Kadi shows a little inferiority. As usual the Amreli pr\u0101nt, and especially Okh\u0101mandal, is the most backward. A middle-class clerk has a comfortable house, with decent furniture. His food is generally rice, tuver, wheat, and bajra, and he also partakes of milk and vegetables. His clothing, too, is good. The cultivators are not so well off. Their houses, even though sometimes large, are very scantily furnished and their food is poor. Their dress too is indifferent, consisting generally of angarkh\u0101s and badans (vests) of a coarse cloth called jota. The landless day-labourers are the worst off. Their usual food is kodra and jow\u0101r, their dress is ragged, and their abodes are poor.\n\nNavs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt contains the largest forest tract in the State. Smaller areas exist in Baroda and Amreli. In 1905 the total area \u2018reserved\u2019 was 680 square miles, in addition to which there are considerable stretches of grass land and scrub jungle not yet surveyed. All the forests may be classed as deciduous and mixed. The most important species of trees are s\u0101g (Tectona grandis), shisham (Dalbergia Sissoo), tanach (Ougeinia dalbergioides), khair (Acacia Catechu), bia (Pterocarpus Marsupium), sadad (Terminalia tomentosa), haladvan (Adina cordifolia), kalam (Stepheyne parvifolia), kagar (Acacia ferruginea), kati (Acacia modesta), dhaman (Grewia tiliacefolia), temru (Diospyros melanoxylon), bandaro (Lagerstroemia lanceolata), apta (Bauhinia racemosa), behedo (Terminalia belerica), kagdoli (Sterculia urens), babul (Acacia arabica), and bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea).\n\nSystematic management of the forests commenced in 1877, but the early administration was not successful. More satisfactory results have been obtained since 1891; and the department is now superintended by a P\u0101rs\u012b Conservator trained at Cooper\u2019s Hill, who has under him an assistant, a working-plan officer, 7 rangers, 7 sub-rangers, 202 guards,\nand 15 d\u00e9p\u00f4t keepers. The forests are administered under an Act passed in 1891, and have been completely demarcated and settled. Working-plans have been prepared for a large area, and others are being drawn up. The unreserved forests are managed by revenue officials, but the price of certain kinds of trees is credited to the Forest department. Up to 1901 no special steps had been taken for the prevention of forest fires; and though regulations are now in force, little has been done beyond clearing the lines of demarcation and the main forest roads. Artificial reproduction is being tried in a few places; and along the sea-coast at Umrath, in the Navsari pr\u0101nt, various trees have been planted to check the spread of sand-dunes inland.\n\n'Major' forest produce in areas outside the Reserves is sold by contract, while 'minor' forest products, such as lac, gum, resin, colouring bark, honey, wax, mahua flowers, &c., are collected by lessees. At the several d\u00e9p\u00f4ts which have been established permits are issued at fixed rates for the extraction of dry fuel, grass, reeds, bamboos, and other 'minor' produce which is not leased. Grazing is permitted in most of the Reserves, and fees are realized by levying certain rates per head of cattle grazed.\n\nUnder the rules at present in force every family in forest tracts is entitled to receive annually inferior timber worth Rs. 5 for repairs, and also timber worth Rs. 20 every ten years for reconstruction of huts. The villagers are also allowed fuel, grass, leaves, and thatching materials for their bona fide use, and minor produce for their own consumption, nothing being granted for sale or barter. In return for these concessions, the villagers are bound to help the subordinate officials in protecting the forests. Owing to the reckless damage done to the forests in former days, the value of the free grants has been reduced from about Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 8,000.\n\nIn the famine of 1899-1900, when there was no grass available in nearly the whole of Gujar\u0101t and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, the Songarh and Vy\u0101ra Reserves were freely thrown open, and enormous quantities of fodder were supplied to the Baroda and Kadi pr\u0101nts, as well as to K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r. In addition to this, about 55,000 cattle were sent from all parts of the State, and even from portions of R\u0101jput\u0101na, to these Reserves for grazing purposes. Similar assistance was given in the bad seasons which followed.\n\nThe average revenue realized from the forests during the decade ending 1890 was Rs. 70,200, while the expenditure was Rs. 29,500, giving an average surplus of Rs. 40,700. During the next ten years the revenue averaged Rs. 93,400, and the expenditure Rs. 59,600, the surplus decreasing to Rs. 33,800. In 1904-5 the income was 1-2 lakhs, the chief items being produce of clearing and improvement fellings\n(Rs. 33,400), and bamboos (Rs. 32,100), while the expenditure was Rs. 64,000.\n\nRich magnetic iron-sand is brought down in large quantities by the Tapti when in flood, and the alluvium deposited on the bank of the river is full of it. The ore seems to have been worked to some extent formerly, but the introduction of cheap iron from Europe has destroyed the industry. The establishment of smelting works in the Songarh taluka has been considered. Traces of gold have been found in the river-beds.\n\nGood sandstone is quarried at Songir on the left bank of the Hiran river, in the Sankheda taluka. The work is carried on by a private company, which pays 2 annas for every large and 1 anna for every small hand-mill stone removed from the quarry, and 12 annas for each cartload of building material. Other kinds of stone are common, but are not worked. Granite of a very handsome variety is found at Virpur in the Kadi prant, and at Bhulwan and Bodeli in the Baroda prant. Crystalline limestone of many colours occurs at Motipura, Harikua, and Wadeli, in the same prant. The green marble of Motipura, when cut and polished, has been described, on competent authority, as the most beautiful marble in India. In Amreli there are practically unlimited supplies of common building stone, such as basalt and miliolite, some of the latter being equal in quality to the best stone obtained in the famed Porbandar quarries.\n\nAs in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t, the hand-loom weavers are generally Dheds and Musalm\u00e1ns, though Khattris, Tais, and Vanjhas also practise the same handicraft. Coarse cotton cloth known as doti, khadi, or chophal, is woven in all parts, the products of the Amreli prant being perhaps the best. They are chiefly disposed of locally, as the erection of steam weaving-mills has almost destroyed the export trade in such material. Efforts are being made to introduce the use of looms of improved patterns. The Khattris of Baroda city turn out a rough woollen cloth which is often used for blankets. In the Kadi prant a large number of Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu women spin cotton thread, which is afterwards woven by Dheds. A more valuable industry is carried on at P\u00e1tan, where weavers manufacture mashr\u00fa, which is exported to Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and other places. Silk is also brought to P\u00e1tan from Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bombay, and there woven into gay\u00eds, pit\u00e1mbars, and the highly appreciated patolas. The sacred threads worn by P\u00e1rsis are largely made at Navs\u00e1ri by women of the priestly class, and exported to Bombay.\n\nAt Baroda embroidery with gold and silver thread is undertaken by a few artisans, and the work in both pattern and execution is of a superior description. The Kharadis of P\u00e1tan also turn out very good embroidery, while more simple work is prepared at Navs\u00e1ri.\nCarpets are made at the Baroda Central jail, and are purchased locally or exported to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, Bombay, and Poona.\n\nThere is nothing out of the common in the jewellery made in the State. Goldsmiths are found in every town, and in the marriage season their business thrives greatly. They manufacture ornaments of gold or silver, pearls being freely used in the case of gold ornaments.\n\nThe village blacksmith makes and repairs rude agricultural implements, and the wandering Pomalas visit every village to make native weights and the minor cooking utensils. At Atarumba, in the Kadi pr\u0101nt, knives and frying-pans of good workmanship are produced, and a sword-making industry on a small scale exists at Dehg\u0101m in the same division. At P\u0101tan good betel-nut cutters are prepared, which find a ready sale through all parts of Gujar\u0101t. In the Baroda pr\u0101nt, at Sojitr\u0101, V\u0101so, and Petl\u0101d, locks are manufactured.\n\nBrass and copper pots for the daily use of the people are manufactured throughout the State, but there is little else worthy of notice. Dabhoi is well-known for the elegance and finish of the articles turned out, and a similar remark may be made of the Kadi brass and copper work. Vismagar also is famous for the excellence of its brass-ware, much of which is exported to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and K\u0101thi\u0101war.\n\nEarthen jars for holding water or for storing grain, pipe-bowls, and clay toys are manufactured in great quantities for domestic use. The only ornamental pottery is made at P\u0101tan, and this, though thin, light, and fragile, is often pretty. Here are manufactured toys, hukkas, water-goglets, pipe-bowls, water-coolers, and similar articles.\n\nThe art of sculpture has almost died out, but specimens of stone-carving still existing prove how great was once the excellence attained in this direction. Splendid examples may be seen at Dabhoi, Ch\u0101ndod, P\u0101tan, Sidhpur, Modhera, and many other places. Though the art has decayed enormously, the stone-carvers of the country have done excellent work in the new palace and other buildings at Baroda.\n\nOrnamental wood-carving is chiefly confined to the Baroda and Kadi pr\u0101nts. In the former excellent workmen reside at Dabhoi and Sankheda, and fine specimens of their art may be seen on the doors and verandas of the houses. Similar examples may be found at V\u0101so, Sojitr\u0101, and Petl\u0101d. In the palace at Baroda there is much wood-carving which displays the same skill. In Kadi the best wood-carving is found at P\u0101tan, Sidhpur, and Vadnagar. Good turning is also done at P\u0101tan. Work in ivory is carried on to some extent at Baroda and P\u0101tan.\n\nA spinning and weaving-mill was established by the State at Baroda in 1883 at a cost of 6.4 lakhs. It contains nearly 15,000 spindles, 260 looms, and 40 gins. As signs of private enterprise had become apparent, the mill was sold for 5 lakhs in 1905 to a firm which has\nfloated a company to work it. Another mill is approaching completion, and others are projected. Ginning factories number 49 and cotton presses 4, while there is a single mill for each of the following industries: flour, dyeing, rice, oil, rope, and timber. Chocolate and matches are prepared in private factories. A sugar refinery was worked for some time without success, and was closed in 1894, but has recently been reopened. The total number of hands employed in the mills averaged about 730 during the last decade.\n\nThe export trade of the State consists mainly of agricultural produce, such as cotton, grain, oilseeds, opium, tobacco, and raw sugar, Bombay being the chief market. Brass and copper vessels are exported from Visnagar and Kadi to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and the silk fabrics of P\u0101tan are in wider demand. The imports consist of rice and other grains, refined sugar, metals, salt, piece-goods, spices, and kerosene oil. Goods are largely carried by rail, but there is some traffic by sea from the ports of Dw\u0101rka, Navs\u0101ri, and Bilimora. The harbours at the two last are being improved, and the formation of a harbour at Velam is under consideration.\n\nAs traders, petty shop-keepers, money-lenders, and bankers, the Bani\u0101s occupy a prominent position. Some of them also trade in cloth, but in this respect the Bhavsars (or Chhipas) perhaps excel them. Brass and copper vessels are dealt in by the Kans\u0101ras. The Gandhis, who are in general Jains, trade in groceries, spices, articles of common use as drugs, and medicines prepared according to native fashion. The sale of vegetables is almost exclusively appropriated by the K\u0101chhis, while the Gh\u0101nchis are dealers in vegetable oil and kerosene. They also sell milk and gh\u012b. The Bohr\u0101s have a special trade in iron vessels, such as frying-pans, buckets, &c., and in ropes of various kinds, while the petty Bohr\u0101s sell every kind of small article. Confectionery is dealt in by the Kandois, and the Tambolis sell betel-leaves, betel-nuts, and tobacco. Corn is sold by Bani\u0101s or Gh\u0101nchis. They purchase wholesale from the cultivators and then sell by retail in the markets. For molasses and sugar there are always special shops in large centres, but elsewhere as a general rule they are sold by the Gandhis.\n\nMost of the important towns in Baroda territory are either on the railway, or are connected by fair roads with stations at no very great distance. No railway passes through the Amreli pr\u0101nt, but part of it lies within easy reach of the Bh\u0101vnagar-Gondal-Jun\u0101gad-Porbandar Railway. One of the main lines from Bombay to Northern India passes through the State. The southern portion is the broad-gauge Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, which crosses parts of the Navs\u0101ri and Baroda pr\u0101nts.\nFrom Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d in British territory this line is continued northwards by the metre-gauge R\u0101jput\u0101na-Malw\u0101 Railway, passing through the Kadi pr\u0101nt. The value to the State of this through route has been greatly increased by the efficient system of branch lines, most of which have been built by the Darb\u0101r, though worked by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. Exceptions are the T\u0101pti Valley Railway, constructed by a company, which crosses portions of Navs\u0101ri from west to east, and the Baroda-Godhra chord line, which is part of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India system. The Baroda pr\u0101nt is well served by the Gaikw\u0101r's Dabhoi Railway (2\u00bd feet gauge), which branches south to Ch\u0101ndod, east to Bodeli, west to Miy\u0101g\u0101m, and north-west to Vishw\u0101mitri, the two last places being on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India main line. Another branch passes south-west from Vishw\u0101mitri to Masor Road. The total length of this system is 95 miles, and its cost to June, 1905, was 24.4 lakhs. The net earnings yielded 5 per cent. on the capital cost in 1904. The outlying t\u0101luka of Petl\u0101d is crossed by the broad-gauge line from Anand to Cambay, 22 miles of which belong to the State, and yielded a profit of nearly 6 per cent. on the capital cost of 11.5 lakhs in 1904. In the Kadi pr\u0101nt the Gaikw\u0101r's Mehs\u0101na Railway radiates from Mehs\u0101na north-west to P\u0101tan, north-east to Kher\u0101lu, and south-west to Viramg\u0101m, with a total length of 93 miles. The capital cost of this system was 34.2 lakhs to June, 1905, and in 1904 the net profit was 6 per cent.\n\nAnother metre-gauge line, 41 miles long, passes south-west from Vij\u0101pur to Kalol on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-Malw\u0101 Railway, and then west to Kadi. It has cost more than 13 lakhs, and yielded a net profit of 3 per cent. in 1904.\n\nThe railways constructed by the Darb\u0101r have increased in length from 113 miles in 1891 to 185 in 1900 and 250 in 1905. The total capital cost has been 83 lakhs, giving an average of Rs. 33,000 per mile, and the net profit in 1904 was 5.3 per cent. Cotton, grain, salt, oilseeds, and sugar are the principal commodities carried.\n\nGood roads are not numerous in Baroda, owing to the great expense involved in construction and up-keep, and it is probably cheaper, and certainly more effective, to make narrow-gauge railways. The main roads are the Bombay-Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d or old trunk road, passing through the Gandevi, Navs\u0101ri, and Vel\u0101chha t\u0101lukas, and the B\u0101rdoli-Surat road. Feeders connect important towns with railway stations, and a few miles of metalled road have been made in and around the capital. The up-keep of village roads has recently been entrusted to local boards.\n\nThe usual conveyance, as throughout Gujar\u0101t, is a large wagon called gadu, the general pattern of which is everywhere the same. It is simply a long cart with a yoke in front, movable sides, and two wheels, usually.\nbut not always tired. Another type, called a *damania*, is about half the length of the *gadu*, and is chiefly used for passengers, of whom it can convey four or five. It is usually drawn by two bullocks, but sometimes one only is used, and then the conveyance is called an *ekka*. Closed carriages, called *shigrams*, are used by wealthy people in large towns.\n\nIn connexion with the chief lines of traffic through the country, there are ferry-boats in many places in Baroda territory, some belonging to private owners, others to the State. The Mindhola river is crossed by four ferries, and the Ambik\u0101 by three. The T\u0101pti has eight, the Narbad\u0101 thirteen, the Mah\u012b seven, the Vishw\u0101mitri two, the S\u0101barmati one, while in Okh\u0101mandal there are ten.\n\nPostal arrangements are entirely under British jurisdiction, the State forming part of the Bombay circle. Telegraph offices have been opened in all the large towns. The following statistics show the postal business in the State for the year 1904\u20135:\n\n| Number of post offices | 203 |\n|-----------------------|-----|\n| Number of letter-boxes | 563 |\n| Number of miles of postal communication | 967 |\n\nTotal number of postal articles delivered:\n- Letters: 2,222,928\n- Postcards: 545,545\n- Packets (including unregistered newspapers): 235,738\n- Newspapers (registered as such in the Post Office): 338,225\n- Parcels: 23,021 Rs.\n\nValue of stamps sold to the public: 1,33,416\nValue of money orders issued: 16,26,490\n\nWhen there is scarcity of rain, the liability to famine varies in different parts according to the means of irrigation. Thus the *rani mah\u0101ls* of Navs\u0101r\u012b, with a stony and inferior soil, suffer as there is no possible way of irrigating the land. In the K\u0101hnam and Chor\u0101si tracts of Baroda wells can only be made with great difficulty, owing to the prevalence of black soil. Most of the Kadi *pr\u0101nt* is suitable for the sinking of wells, the exceptions being portions of the P\u0101tan and Sidhpur *t\u0101lukas*, the *peta mah\u0101l* of Harij, and the neighbouring parts of the Kadi and Vad\u0101vli *t\u0101lukas*, a part of the Kalol *t\u0101luka*, the *peta mah\u0101l* of Atarsumba, and the tract of country through which the S\u0101barmati flows. In Amreli the country bordering on the Gir, the southern portion of the Dh\u0101ri *t\u0101luka*, and the northern part of the Kodin\u0101r *t\u0101luka* have few wells, while on the sandy and almost rainless promontory of Okh\u0101mandal both soil and climate seem to combine to forbid cultivation.\n\nThe records of early famines are very scanty. There was certainly a great famine in 1791, and another in 1812\u20133, which prevailed most\nseverely in Kadi and Amreli. In 1819, 1834, 1838, 1877, and 1896 scarcity was experienced in portions of Baroda territory.\n\nIn consequence of the failure of the monsoon in 1899, the whole of Gujar\u0101t fell a prey to the most terrible famine within the memory of living men. In June the usual showers of rain fell in all parts of the State, and the first agricultural operations were carried out. But three months followed without rain, and all hopes for the year disappeared in October; numbers of cattle died in that month, prices rose very high, and a period of disaster set in. The total rainfall varied from 13 to 34 per cent. of the normal in most parts of the State. Up to February, 1900, the Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt, which had received about 34 per cent. of the normal rain, was considered free from famine; but an area of 6,245 square miles, with a population of 2,095,953, was severely affected from the beginning of the year.\n\nThe crops failed entirely in every part, and fodder was soon exhausted except in the forest tracts of the Navs\u0101ri pr\u0101nt. The prevalence of famine in the Deccan, R\u0101jput\u0101na, Central India, and other parts added to the distress, for the prices of b\u0101jra and jowar doubled. Wheat rose by only 60 per cent., and the price of rice was in some measure kept down by large importations from Rangoon.\n\nExtensive relief measures were undertaken by the State. Gratuitous relief was granted to those unable to work, 6.4 million units being aided at a cost of 2.6 lakhs. In addition, 4.6 million units were relieved by private charity at a cost of 2.5 lakhs. Cheap grain-shops were also opened and poorhouses established. Relief works were opened in many places, some of which were large protective irrigational works, such as the Kadarpur reservoir, the Orsang irrigation scheme, a new feeder for the Ajwa reservoir, tanks at Kar\u0101chia and Haripura, and drainage works at Sandesar and Karamsad. Roads and railway earthworks were also used to provide relief. The number of units on works was 19.2 millions, and the expenditure was 19.4 lakhs. Advances were freely made to agriculturists, amounting to 15.2 lakhs. The preservation of cattle was effected to some extent by giving free grazing wherever it was available, by the stoppage of the sale of grass on pasture lands, by the removal of duties on cattle-food, by the encouragement of the growth of fodder-crops, and by the direct supply of grass. The total quantity of grass so supplied amounted to 3,255 tons, and the cost was a lakh. Wells were sunk, specially in the Kadi division, at a total expenditure of 12.2 lakhs, and with the water so obtained fodder-crops were raised. The total expenditure during 1899-1900 on account of this great famine was 46 lakhs.\n\nIn the next three years the rainfall was unsatisfactory, and the whole country was infested with rats, which destroyed the crops wholesale. Considerable expenditure was required, amounting to 60 lakhs, of\nwhich 26 lakhs was spent on works and 16 lakhs on advances. In 1904-5 scarcity was again felt, and relief measures were required at a cost of 10 lakhs, including advances of 7 lakhs.\n\nAs the registration of births and deaths has only recently been organized, statistics of the effect on population are not very reliable. During the famine year the number of deaths recorded was 131,261, while the average mortality of the previous five years was only 42,723. The deaths are attributed to the following causes: cholera, 21,986; fever, 73,294; dysentery and diarrhoea, 8,560; other causes, 27,421. According to the famine report for the year 1899-1900, the number of deaths due to famine causes alone, to the end of July, 1900, was 68,674.\n\nThe State is in direct political relation with the Government of India, all communications passing through the Resident.\n\nThe administration is carried on by an executive council, subject to the control of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, who is assisted by a D\u012bw\u0101n and other officers. A number of departments have been formed, which are presided over by officials corresponding to those in British India, the principal heads of departments being members of the council. The revenue, financial, and settlement departments are at present controlled by Mr. R. C. Dutt, a retired Indian Civilian. Other departments deal with public works, medical, education, police and jails, judicial, military, records, and palace.\n\nThe State is divided into four pr\u0101nts, corresponding to the Districts of British territory, and each pr\u0101nt is subdivided into mah\u0101ls or t\u0101lukas, which number thirty-three, besides a few peta mah\u0101ls or sub-t\u0101lukas.\n\nA S\u016bbah or Collector is in charge of each pr\u0101nt, with an Assistant called the naib-s\u016bbah. A vahiv\u0101td\u0101r or tahsild\u0101r is in charge of each t\u0101luka. Corresponding to the Commissioner in British India is a Sar-s\u016bbah, who supervises the work of the S\u016bbahs, and is subordinate to the Revenue Minister. For some years attempts have been made to restore village autonomy, and since 1902 a panch\u0101yat has been formally constituted for each village with a population exceeding 1,000, smaller hamlets being grouped together. The number of members varies from five to nine, half being appointed by the district officials and half selected. The p\u0101tel or headman is president, and the accountant and schoolmaster are members ex officio. These bodies are in charge of various details connected with the administration, and form part of the scheme for local self-government, which is described below.\n\nBefore the administration of the present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 there were few published codes in force, and these dealt chiefly with civil and criminal procedure, stamps, and registration. In 1883 a law committee was constituted, consisting of the Naib D\u012bw\u0101n and the three Judges of\nthe High Court. The committee was replaced in 1904 by a legislative department, under a Legal Remembrancer. Bills are published in the official Gazette, and after consideration of the criticisms made by the public and officers of the State become law under the orders of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101.\n\nThe chief measures passed since 1884 are: Acts dealing with Police (1884 and 1898), Registration (1885 and 1902), Excise (1886 and 1900), Stamps (1889 and 1904), Small Cause Courts (1890), Municipalities (1892), Law relating to Possession (1895 and 1897), Court Fees (1896 and 1904), Civil Procedure (1896, 1902, and 1904), Easements (1896), Limitation (1896 and 1903), Penal Code (1896 and 1904), Criminal Procedure (1896 and 1904), Interest (1898), Inspection of Boilers (1898), Contracts (1898), Guardians and Wards (1898), Lunatic Asylums (1899), Arms (1900), Transfer of Property (1901 and 1902), Hindu Widow Marriages (1902), Opium (1902), Village Munsifs (1902), Primary Education (1904), Infant Marriage Prevention (1904), Local Boards (1904\u20135), Co-operative Credit Societies (1904\u20135), Religious Endowments (1904\u20135), Charitable Estates (1904\u20135), and Customs (1904\u20135).\n\nTill recently the subordinate revenue officials exercised magisterial powers, resembling those of a magistrate of the second or third class in British India. Since 1904, however, the vahiv\u0101td\u0101rs have been relieved of criminal work in almost every taluka, and cases are now tried by the Munsifs or subordinate civil officers. Naib-s\u016bbahs or S\u016bbahs have first-class powers, and the latter can transfer cases from one subordinate court to another.\n\nThe lowest civil courts of first instance are those of the mah\u0101l Munsifs, who can usually hear suits up to Rs. 7,000, and Small Cause suits up to Rs. 100 when sitting alone, and up to Rs. 300 when forming a bench with another Joint Munsif or a panch\u0101yat. A few Village Munsifs have also been appointed. The Munsifs have criminal jurisdiction as magistrates of the first class.\n\nThe pr\u0101nt Judges try original civil suits up to any amount, hear appeals from the Munsifs\u2019 decisions, and try Small Cause suits up to Rs. 750 when alone, and up to Rs. 2,250 when forming a bench with another Judge or with a panch\u0101yat. In criminal cases they can sentence to imprisonment for life, subject to the sanction of the High Court, and to death, subject to the sanction of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. In certain classes of criminal cases the trial is conducted with the aid of assessors, and the adoption of a jury system is under consideration. A separate pr\u0101nt Judge was appointed for Baroda city in 1905.\n\nThe chief tribunal is called the Varishth or High Court, and sits at Baroda. It possesses jurisdiction over the whole of the State, and hears all final appeals in civil and criminal cases. The Judges of this\ncourt, who are three in number, besides the Chief Justice, have also extraordinary powers to try an original case. Sentences of death, however, are subject to confirmation by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, who can also modify any order passed by the court.\n\nA special court, for the trial of civil and criminal cases affecting certain privileged persons, such as sard\u0101rs and darakd\u0101rs, sits at Baroda, and is known as the Sard\u0101rs' Court.\n\nMinor offences with regard to sanitation, petty quarrels, &c., are disposed of by the village p\u0101tels, who can fine up to Rs. 5, and inflict 48 hours' imprisonment in the village lock-up.\n\nCases of theft and robbery are more frequent than any others, and offences against the person rank next, although murders and other cases of grievous hurt are not prevalent. Offences against public tranquillity are comparatively rare. The following table gives statistics of crime and litigation for a series of years:\n\n| CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE |\n|-----------------------------|\n|                             | Average for ten years ending 1890. | Average for ten years ending 1900. | 1901. | 1904-5. |\n| Criminal.                   |                               |                               |       |         |\n| Number of persons tried     | 21,404                         | 30,816                        | 22,680 | 22,295  |\n| Civil.                      |                               |                               |       |         |\n| Suits for money and movable property | 14,912                     | 20,596                        | 13,450 | 11,904  |\n| Title and other suits       | 809                            | 1,903                         | 1,341  | 1,200   |\n| Rent suits                  | 188                            | 365                           | 736    | 501     |\n| Total                       | 15,909                         | 22,864                        | 15,527 | 13,605  |\n\nA Registration department was formed in 1885. In the decade ending 1900 the number of offices was 48, and the average number of documents registered was 15,945. In 1904-5 there were 49 offices, and 20,641 documents were registered.\n\nThe department of finance and accounts is usually controlled by an Accountant-General, and is modelled on the system in force in British India. In addition to the usual detailed examination of accounts at the head office, the officials of the inspection branch tour and examine the working of all disbursing offices, and check cash balances and stock.\n\nThe main items of revenue in the Baroda State are land revenue, tribute from other Native States in Gujar\u0101t and K\u0101th\u012baw\u0101r, opium, excise, stamps, and railways. The main items of expenditure are the palace, civil establishments, army, public works, police, and education.\nThe following table shows the revenue and expenditure for a series of years, in thousands of rupees:\n\n### State Revenue and Expenditure\n\n| Revenue                                      | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901 | 1904\u20135 |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------|--------|\n| Land revenue                                 | 1,0126                           | 9709                             | 8769 | 5803   |\n| Stamps                                       | 302                              | 581                              | 593  | 412    |\n| Customs (land, sea, and town duties)         | 1032                             | 760                              | 671  | 536    |\n| Miscellaneous taxes                          | 343                              | 266                              | 157  | 161    |\n| Forests                                      | 63                               | 108                              | 76   | 112    |\n| Registration                                 | 39                               | 51                               | 51   | 64     |\n| Other sources (chiefly tribute, excise, railways, opium, and interest) | 4038                             | 5011                             | 3344 | 4293   |\n| **Total revenue**                            | **1,5943**                       | **1,6486**                       | **1,3661** | **1,1381** |\n| Expenditure                                  |                                  |                                  |      |        |\n| Collection of land revenue, &c.              | 1938                             | 2868                             | 2711 | 2133   |\n| Huzir office establishment                   | 504                              | 512                              | 524  | 490    |\n| Judicial establishment                       | 320                              | 382                              | 400  | 310    |\n| Police                                       | 851                              | 774                              | 786  | 732    |\n| Education                                    | 273                              | 795                              | 807  | 674    |\n| Medical                                      | 159                              | 207                              | 218  | 164    |\n| Minor civil departments                      | 722                              | 774                              | 819  | 1592   |\n| Pensions, &c.                                | 997                              | 1000                             | 877  | 733    |\n| Public works (including irrigation and famine relief) | 1825                             | 2188                             | 3420 | 1629   |\n| Other charges (chiefly palace and military)  | 7512                             | 7459                             | 7362 | 6123   |\n| **Total expenditure**                        | **1,5101**                       | **1,7020**                       | **1,7924** | **1,4586** |\n\nThe disastrous famine year and its successor account for the diminished land revenue in 1901, and the increase of expenditure, due chiefly to protective relief works, in the same year. The large decrease in land revenue in 1904\u20135 is due to remissions and suspensions owing to scarcity.\n\nThe tributes from feudatory chiefs in K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, Rew\u0101 K\u0101ntha, and Mahi K\u0101ntha are chiefly collected by the British Government and are paid through the Resident. In 1904\u20135 they amounted to 5.9 lakhs.\n\nThe earliest coin struck in the Baroda State was issued, nominally under the authority of Sh\u0101h Alam II, at the close of the eighteenth century. Subsequently the Darb\u0101r issued its own money. The silver coins were called b\u0101b\u0101sh\u0101hi rupees, and the copper coins Baroda pice, and all were executed in the rudest manner, except the latest issue of the present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. This currency did not, however, circulate in all parts. In Navs\u0101ri and Amreli British coin was used, while in Kadi shikai rupees were current till 1896, when b\u0101b\u0101sh\u0101hi rupees were sub-\nstituted. Great inconvenience was caused by fluctuations in exchange, and British currency was introduced everywhere in 1901. The only trace still left of the old currency is in the Baroda print, where Baroda pice are still in use.\n\nA large proportion of the land has been alienated. These alienations extend not only to portions of the kh\u0101lsa or State villages, but also include whole villages, of which about 8 per cent.\n\nLand revenue. have been alienated. A general term applied to such lands is bh\u0101rkh\u0101li, the expression meaning those of which the produce is not brought into the State kh\u0101la or \u2018grain-yard.\u2019 Prominent among the holders of such land are the Gir\u0101si\u0101s, whose ancestors held estates under the Mughals, or rose to power subsequently. Some Gir\u0101si\u0101s are entitled to cash payments only, while others hold land and receive allowances as well. Land which is exempted from assessment is called nakari, and includes dharm\u0101daya, divasth\u0101n, and pirasth\u0101n, or lands for the support of charitable institutions or to maintain religious establishments. Ch\u0101karyat lands are those granted in lieu of cash for services rendered to the State, and the occupants have no power to sell, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of them. Pasaita lands are free grants to the different orders of village servants in Gujar\u0101t. There are also in\u0101mi grants and alienations given as rewards for services, military or civil, and many less important classes of tenure. Since 1880 alienations have been more carefully supervised than was usual in the past.\n\nThe principal tenure in the kh\u0101lsa area is ryotw\u0101ri, under which the State collects the revenue directly from each cultivator without the intervention of a third party. The land revenue is usually assessed in cash on the area of the land occupied, but in a small and backward tract it is still levied on the number of mattocks used. This tract is now confined to one corner of the State and is mostly forest land. The cultivators have full rights of sale and mortgage; but if a holding is sold in execution of a decree, sufficient land is reserved for the subsistence of the cultivator and his family.\n\nTwo tenures, which resemble to some extent the zam\u012bnd\u0101ri tenure of Northern India, are called narvad\u0101ri and bh\u0101g\u0101ri. The latter has practically disappeared. In the former a lump assessment is made on a whole village, on general considerations, and the narvad\u0101rs are left to make their own terms with the actual cultivators. As a rule, they set aside a portion of the village the produce of which meets the State demand. While nominally allowed to alienate their rights, they remain responsible for the full assessment. Under the ankadabandi and ekankadi tenures a lump sum is assessed on a whole village, and the cultivators are left to distribute the demand among themselves. The assessment is subject to revision in the case of the former, and is permanently fixed in the latter class.\nUnder the Mar\u0101th\u0101s tracts of land were leased to farmers, who extorted as much as they could from the cultivators. In 1864 Khande Rao commenced a scheme for settlement resembling that in the adjacent parts of Bombay. He also substituted payments in cash for division of the produce, and established a State service for the collection of revenue. The system was hardly successful, as the survey was incorrect, and the assessment was largely guess-work, while the tendency to pitch it too high was increased by the temporary demand for Indian cotton during the American Civil War. About ten years later, Sir T. M\u0101dhava Rao reduced the demand by 12 lakhs; and in 1883 a new survey and settlement were commenced under an officer of the Indian Civil Service. Operations were modelled on those followed in Bombay. The demand for a whole taluka was fixed on consideration of the fiscal history of the tract, and was then distributed after careful classification of the land according to its capabilities. The total demand was still further reduced by 8 lakhs, and the assessment was fixed for a period of fifteen years. A number of taxes on agriculturists were at the same time abolished. In 1904 the revision of this settlement commenced, also under the control of an officer of the Indian Civil Service, and it has been decided to fix the term of assessment at thirty years.\n\nTrade in opium is a monopoly of the State, and no cultivator is permitted to grow poppy without a licence. A special agency is maintained for supervising and regulating the growth of the plant, and the subsequent manufacture of opium. At present cultivation is confined to the Kadi pr\u0101nt. Licences are issued by the vahivadars or the opium superintendent to cultivators, who send their applications through the village accountants. Opium is collected from the cultivators at fixed places from April to June, and they receive payment immediately, at a rate fixed beforehand, which was Rs. 6 per seer in 1904\u20135. A sufficient quantity is reserved for use in the State, and the balance is sent to Bombay for sale in China. The latter is packed in chests containing $140\\frac{1}{4}$ lb. or half-chests of $70\\frac{1}{8}$ lb., and is subject to a transit duty at present amounting to Rs. 600 per chest, collected by the British Government at Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. Retail sale within the State is effected by licensed vendors. In Navs\u0101ri and Amreli the contract for sale throughout the whole pr\u0101nt is disposed of by auction, while in Baroda shops are let separately. In Kadi a selected licensee receives the contract. The area under poppy averaged 8,166 acres during the decade ending 1890, 6,223 acres during the following ten years, and was 6,973 acres in 1901 and 12,262 acres in 1904\u20135. The net revenue averaged 3\u00b73 lakhs from 1881 to 1890, and 4\u00b71 lakhs during the next decade. In 1904\u20135 sales within the State realized a net profit of 2\u00b75 lakhs, and 800 chests were exported at a profit of 3\u00b72 lakhs. Many causes affect the popularity of the cultiva-\ntion. The poppy is a difficult plant to bring under culture. It requires constant care and attention, and all the processes connected with it entail much labour. Rapeseed, wheat, and other crops compete with poppy. The price to be offered by the State is notified before issuing licences, and the people make a choice according to the conditions of the season.\n\nThe manufacture of salt is carried on only in Amreli. The product is sold in this prant, and cannot be exported to other parts of Baroda or to British India. Salt made at Kodin\u0101r is a State monopoly; but no restrictions are in force at Okh\u0101mandal, except the levy of an export duty on salt exported to Zanzibar and other foreign ports. In the rest of the State salt may not be manufactured. In 1904\u20135 the State realized Rs. 573 from export duty, and Rs. 348 from the monopoly, while it spent Rs. 230 on the latter and Rs. 864 on preventive establishment.\n\nThe principal sources of excise revenue are the manufacture and sale of country liquors and toddy, bhang, g\u0101nja, and other intoxicating drugs, and fees for licences for the sale of imported foreign liquors. In Amreli the out-still system is in force, under which the rights to manufacture and sell liquor are sold together. In other prants liquor is manufactured at a central distillery, still-head duty being levied at rates varying from 6 annas a gallon for liquor at 60\u00b0 under proof, to Rs. 2\u20138 for liquor 15\u00b0 under proof. Licences for retail vend are sold by auction. Toddy is sold in shops which are let singly or in groups of licensed vendors, and in addition a tree tax is levied. It is important only in Baroda and Navs\u0101ri. Licences for the sale of imported liquors are given at fixed annual rates, varying from Rs. 75 to Rs. 125. The excise revenue during the decade ending 1890 averaged 5\u00b744 lakhs, and during the next ten years 8\u00b75 lakhs. In 1901 the revenue was 5\u00b78 lakhs, and in 1904\u20135, 6\u00b78 lakhs. The chief heads of receipts in the last year were 5\u00b78 lakhs from liquors and Rs. 93,000 from toddy. The incidence of receipts per head of the population was R. 0\u20131\u20139 in 1881, R. 0\u20135\u20135 in 1891, R. 0\u20134\u20138 in 1901, and R. 0\u20135\u20136 in 1904\u20135. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Kolis, and labouring Hindus, the P\u0101rsis, and some of the Muhammadans consume country liquor; but as usual the greatest demand is in the capital and chief centres. In Navs\u0101ri there is a large consumption of toddy, because of the numerous palms that grow there, and the superior nature of the manufactured drink. Bhang, g\u0101nja, &c., are not used nearly so freely as liquor. The higher classes are as a rule strongly averse to the use of liquor, though some educated persons take a stimulant in case of illness. The wealthier part of the community, as for instance the P\u0101rsis, prefer imported spirits to the coarser country brands.\n\nThe Stamp department is conducted on methods analogous to those obtaining in British territory. Various kinds of stamps and stamped\npaper are supplied to selected vendors, who sell by retail to the people, and obtain a commission from the State. The revenue derived from stamps during the decade ending 1890 averaged 3 lakhs, and during the next ten years 5.8 lakhs. In 1901 it was 5.9 lakhs, and in 1904-5, 4.1 lakhs.\n\nTill recently a number of vexatious taxes were levied on professions and castes, forming 214 classes in 1905. They yielded only about Rs. 85,000, and have been replaced by an income tax, first levied, in part of the State, in 1901-2. This is assessed at about 1 per cent., incomes of less than Rs. 300 per annum being exempted. The revenue in 1904-5 was Rs. 99,000. An income of about a lakh is derived from rents paid for homestead land by non-agriculturists, licences to collect valuable shells, and taxes on pilgrims.\n\nImportant reforms have recently been made in the customs administration, which were formerly complicated and harassing to trade. In 1904 the frontier duties hitherto imposed in the Baroda and Kadi prants on 28 articles were abolished, leaving 8 on the schedule, and a similar reduction was made in the duties levied in towns, while export duties were remitted, except in the case of cotton and mahua. At the same time the assessment was simplified by levying it by weight, instead of ad valorem. A year later similar reforms were introduced in the Navsari and Amreli prants, and in addition octroi was completely abolished in several small towns. The customs revenue during the decade ending 1890 averaged 10.3 lakhs, and during the next decade 7.6 lakhs; in 1904-5 it amounted to 5.4 lakhs. In the last year the expenditure on establishment was Rs. 80,000.\n\nA scheme for local self-government came into force in 1905, when a taluka board was constituted in each taluka and a District board in each prant. Groups of villages and each municipality return a member to the taluka board, half the members of which are thus elected, the other half being nominated by the State. Half the members of the District board are similarly elected by taluka boards and large municipalities. Alienated villages are also represented on both District and taluka boards. The Subah presides over the former, and the naib-subah over the latter. A local cess is levied at the rate of one anna in the rupee on land revenue, but has not yet been extended to the whole State. From the proceeds a quarter is set apart for famine and other unforeseen expenditure, and the balance is placed at the disposal of the boards, amounting to 2.8 lakhs in 1905-6. Further grants are made for public works, vaccination, and village schools, the total income being 4.5 lakhs. The boards' functions resemble those entrusted to similar institutions in British India, such as public works, schools, temporary dispensaries, vaccination, sanitation, and arboriculture.\nIn 1877 municipalities were established in all towns containing a population of 10,000 persons and over, excepting Dw\u0101rka, and grants were made by the State at the rate of 4 annas per head of population. The grants sufficed only for a limited attention to conservancy, lighting, watering, &c., and were subsequently raised to 8 annas per head for all towns where the population is more than 7,000, and 6 annas per head in other cases. Municipalities were subsequently established in twenty-two other towns with a population of less than 10,000. From 1899-1900 (famine year) the grants were reduced to 4 annas, except in P\u0101tan. In 1905 separate sources of income were assigned to some municipalities. Thus Baroda city received a grant of 1.3 lakhs and the net receipts from octroi, while custom duties, tolls, local cess, and a proportion of the excise revenue raised in them were handed over to seven other towns, the ordinary grant being reduced or abolished. In 1905 there were altogether 35 municipal towns: Baroda city, with a population exceeding 100,000; 10 with more than 10,000 and less than 100,000; and 24 with less than 10,000. The total population within municipal limits was 412,626.\n\nWith the exception of Baroda city and seven other towns, the S\u016bbah appoints no less than half the members, who are from eight to sixteen in number, and hold office for three years. In making his nominations the S\u016bbah is expected to take into consideration the different castes of the inhabitants, and the nature of the trade carried on in the town. He can also appoint State servants, such as members of the medical and educational departments. In the more important towns, naib-s\u016bbahs help in the administration, and in the t\u0101luka towns the vahiv\u0101t-d\u0101rs. In 1905 a scheme was introduced by which half the members are elected in the seven towns referred to above. The principle of election has been introduced to a certain extent in other municipalities also.\n\nThe following table shows the expenditure of the municipalities, excluding Baroda city:\n\n|                          | 1889-90. | Average for the ten years 1891-1900. | 1900-1. | 1904-5. |\n|--------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Establishment            | Rs.      | Rs.                                 | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Public works             |          |                                     | 15,687  | 12,504  |\n| Planting of trees        | Details  |                                     | 10,271  | 13,224  |\n| Conservancy              | Details  |                                     | 191     | 202     |\n| Watering roads           | not available |                                     | 57,825  | 48,630  |\n| Lighting                 | not available |                                     | 3,480   | 2,377   |\n| Fire establishment       |          |                                     | 13,496  | 13,582  |\n| Tools and plant          |          |                                     | 579     | 918     |\n| Miscellaneous            |          |                                     | 776     | 1,378   |\n|                          |          |                                     | 1,226   | 4,736   |\n| Total                    | 70,812   | 1,23,194                            | 1,03,531| 97,551  |\nIn Baroda city the expenditure was 3\u00b74 lakhs in 1889\u201390 and 1900\u20131, and 2\u00b74 lakhs in 1904\u20135.\n\nThe public works department, which came into existence in 1875, is under the control of the Chief Engineer, the administrative part of the work being conducted by a secretary in the public works department, who is of the rank of Executive Engineer. Five divisions have been formed for the pr\u0101nt and Baroda city, at the head of each being an Executive Engineer with a qualified staff under him. There is a separate Executive Engineer for irrigation. It has also been found necessary to make a separate branch for landscape gardening, and to appoint at its head a European Garden Superintendent, who reports directly to the Chief Engineer.\n\nDuring the decade 1881\u201390 the expenditure averaged 16\u00b77 lakhs, while in the next ten years it rose to 18\u00b73 lakhs. In 1904\u20135 it amounted to 20\u00b71 lakhs, including 2 lakhs for famine relief. These sums do not include expenditure on the railways, which were not constructed by the department.\n\nThe following are the principal works that have been carried out since the accession of the present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101: The Dufferin, Jamn\u0101bai, and Military Hospitals, and a Lunatic Asylum at Baroda city, and 4 hospitals and 25 dispensaries in the districts; a college, Anglo-vernacular school, and female training college at Baroda, a high school at Amreli, and about 50 other schools; public offices at Baroda, Navs\u0101ri, Amreli, and Mehs\u0101na; a survey office and record office at Baroda; judicial courts and a Central jail at Baroda, and 4 District jails; a public park and museum at Baroda; cavalry and infantry lines, with officers\u2019 quarters at Baroda; the Ajwa reservoir and city drainage works for Baroda, and drainage and irrigation works in the districts; a lighthouse at Dw\u0101rka; roads from Baroda to Ajwa and Am\u0101ly\u0101ra, Petl\u0101d to Cambay, Sinor to Karjan, P\u0101tan to Harij, Bilimora to Gandevi, Songarh to Surat, Amreli to Chital, Dw\u0101rka to Koranga, and many others of short lengths. In addition, the magnificent Lakshmi Vil\u0101s palace at Baroda, and a palace at Umrath, have been constructed departmentally.\n\nThe State army, consisting of the regular and irregular forces, is under the command of the Sen\u0101pati, who is assisted by the military secretary. The regular forces include artillery, cavalry, and infantry, whose total strength in 1904\u20135 was 4,775 officers and men. The artillery forms a light field battery, 93 strong. There are four cavalry regiments, with a total strength of 1,500 men, and four infantry regiments with 3,182, including staff officers and the band. The irregular forces are also divided into horse and foot, the former numbering 2,000 and the latter 1,806. The total cost in 1904\u20135 was 17\u00b79 lakhs, of which 10\u00b76\nlakhs was spent on the regulars, 6\u00b75 lakhs on the irregulars, and the balance on pensions. In addition, the State pays 3\u00b77 lakhs annually to the British Government as commutation for the maintenance of the former Baroda Contingent, making a total military expenditure of 21\u00b76 lakhs. A regiment of native infantry of the Indian Army garrisons Baroda, which is a cantonment in the Mhow division of the Western Command.\n\nBefore 1860 the police administration was in the hands of the revenue farmers, who were permitted to exercise magisterial and police functions. The system was unsatisfactory, and consequently numerous changes and improvements were made; but the first thorough reform was introduced by Sir T. M\u0101dhava Rao, who separated the work of the magistrates from that of the police.\n\nThe present organization of the regular police is as follows: At the head of the department is a Commissioner. Each prant is under a district police officer, who is called police naib-s\u016bbah, corresponding in rank with the District Superintendent, and has under him a varying number of inspectors. The inspectors are in charge of subdivisions, which consist of three or more t\u0101lukas. Each t\u0101luka has a faujdar (chief constable). A t\u0101luka is subdivided into th\u0101nas (outposts), each th\u0101na containing a certain number of villages. Large and important th\u0101nas have chaukis under them for a small group of villages. The th\u0101nas are under naib-faujd\u0101rs, and the chaukis under havild\u0101rs or jemad\u0101rs. The sanctioned strength of the regular force in 1904\u20135 was 4,886, made up as follows: 60 officers, 4,622 subordinate officers and men, and 204 mounted police, besides 129 non-effectives. The actual strength was 4,660, and the total cost was 6\u00b74 lakhs. The sanctioned strength allows one man of the regular police to every 2\u00b79 square miles of country, and to every 690 inhabitants. The rural police are said to number about 10,000 men. These latter are, strictly speaking, subordinate to the village panch\u0101yats, but in criminal cases must give assistance and report to the regular police.\n\nThe system of recruitment of the regular police is almost the same as in British territory. Recruits must be men of good character, with a height not less than 5 feet 5 inches, and circumference of chest not less than 31 inches. After enlistment each recruit is trained at the head-quarters of the division for at least six months, and is taught drill and the use of the rifle. Those who cannot read and write receive oral instruction in their duties, and manuals are provided containing the chief points of the Police Act and other regulations. In 1904\u20135 about 63 per cent. of the force could read and write. Educated men have not shown much desire to enter this department; but a change seems to be setting in, and at the present time there are even a few\ngraduates in the service. The pay of the force has recently been raised.\n\nExcept in the city of Baroda there is no special branch for detective service. To aid in the detection of crime, the system of taking fingerprints was introduced two years ago and is now being developed throughout the State. Police on the State railways are under the control of the Police Commissioner, except on the Dabhoi Railway, which is under the Superintendent of Railway Police, Bombay.\n\nThe number of cases dealt with by the police and the main results are shown below:\n\n| Number of cases reported | Average, 1891-1900. | 1904-5. |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|---------|\n|                          | 5,807               | 4,263   |\n| decided in criminal courts | 3,387               | 2,276   |\n| ending in acquittal or discharge | 1,311               | 631     |\n| conviction                | 2,076               | 1,532   |\n\nThe Jail department is under the Police Commissioner. The State contains a Central jail at Baroda, 4 District jails, a subordinate jail, and 39 lock-ups. The Central jail and three of the District jails are in charge of Civil Surgeons, while the others are supervised by vahiv\u0101td\u0101rs or subordinate officials. The average daily number of inmates was 1,511 in 1881, 2,324 in 1901 (a famine year), and 915 in 1904-5. The mortality usually ranges from 25 to 35 per thousand, but in 1901 rose to 84, owing to the effects of famine on the population. The chief industry pursued in the Baroda Central jail is weaving. All the clothing required for the prisoners themselves, and for the police, is prepared here. Excellent carpets are also made, as well as cane baskets, boxes, chairs, &c. The produce is sold under a contract, and is exported in large quantities. In 1904-5 the total receipts from convict labour amounted to Rs. 25,000. The annual average cost of maintaining a prisoner was Rs. 69 in 1881, Rs. 76 in 1891, Rs. 81 in 1901, and Rs. 73 in 1904-5, the total expenditure in the last year being Rs. 67,000.\n\nUp to 1871 the State took no interest in schools and expended no money on education. The progress made since, which has raised education to a very high standard, is thus remarkable. Statistics will be found in a table at the end of this article (p. 78).\n\nIndigenous schools are usually conducted by Br\u0101hmans, the post of head master being hereditary. The fees are small, varying in the case of monthly payments from 1 anna to 4 annas. In other cases a small lump sum is given, or payment is made in grain. The ages of the boys attending these schools vary from 5 to 10 in towns, and from\nto about 13 in villages. The subjects taught do not go beyond reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic, though formulae of a moral and intellectual nature are learnt by heart. No books are used, and the school-house is either the master's own property or he is allowed to use a dharmasala. Many of these institutions have been replaced by State schools.\n\nIn 1871 five State schools were opened, two for Gujarati, two for Marathi, and one for English tuition. In 1875 a department of public instruction was established, and rapid extensions and developments then followed until the present system was established. The department, which is controlled by the Vidyadhikari or Minister of Education, is divided into two branches, the Anglo-vernacular and the vernacular branch. The staff of the Baroda College and high school inspect the former, while the latter is supervised by an Inspector in each prant, aided by eleven deputy-inspectors and a twelfth for Urdu and low-caste schools.\n\nThe Baroda College was founded in 1881, and recognized by the University of Bombay in the same year. It is fully equipped with chemical and physical laboratories, a botanical garden, an excellent library, and prepares students for the highest degrees in the faculty of Arts, the B.Sc., and also for the first LL.B. examination of the University. Close to the college building are large boarding-houses for the residence of students. In 1905-6 students from this college passed the following examinations: Previous 35, Intermediate 30, B.A. 19, B.Sc. 3, M.A. 1, and first LL.B. 13. A number of students have been sent at the State expense to continue their studies in England, America, and Japan.\n\nSecondary schools are divided into high schools and Anglo-vernacular schools. Their number has risen from 10 with 809 pupils in 1881 to 17 with 1,978 pupils in 1891, 21 with 2,926 pupils in 1901, and 21 with 3,095 pupils in 1904-5. In the last year the State maintained 3 high schools and 14 Anglo-vernacular schools, and aided the other institutions. The total expenditure was 1.5 lakhs, and the receipts from fees were Rs. 32,000. The proportion of the male population of school-going age under secondary instruction in 1904-5 was 1.83 per cent.\n\nIn the vernacular schools education is imparted in Gujarati, Marathi, or Urdu, and in the best of the Marathi and Gujarati schools there are seven standards, with Sanskrit as an optional subject. These schools are provided in all towns and villages with a population exceeding 1,000, though even smaller places possess them. Great attention is paid in primary schools to subjects of practical use, such as letter-writing, book-keeping, history and geography of the State, hygiene, village accounts, &c. Moral instruction is also given, and physical education is imparted. In some schools manual training has also been\nintroduced. Village schools were first opened in 1891, and the village schoolmaster is now recognized as one of the permanent members of the panchayat. The schools are opened in all villages where there are no regular schools, provided that at least sixteen pupils can be collected. The standard is lower than in regular schools, but in the upper classes boys learn village accounts, book-keeping, and a little surveying. In 1905 these schools were made over to local boards.\n\nAn experiment in compulsory education has been carried on in the Amreli taluka since 1893. In 1904\u20135, 66 schools were specially provided in 50 villages, and these were attended by 5,879 pupils, or 11 per cent. of the total population. An Act was passed in 1904 to provide for the extension of this system to other talukas. The age limit for compulsory attendance is 7 to 12 for boys and 7 to 10 for girls, but numerous exemptions are allowed.\n\nThe total number of vernacular schools rose from 180 with 17,465 pupils in 1881 to 503 with 50,979 pupils in 1891, 1,189 with 83,277 pupils in 1901, and 1,243 with 81,649 pupils in 1904\u20135. The latest figures include 496 State schools for boys, 94 for girls, and 653 village schools and other institutions. Nearly 40 per cent. of the villages in the State have schools, and 43 per cent. of boys of a school-going age are under instruction. The monthly pay of an assistant master ranges from Rs. 7 to Rs. 25, while a head master receives from Rs. 15 to Rs. 60.\n\nIn 1881 the number of girls\u2019 schools in the State was 8, with an average attendance of 554. In 1891 the number of schools was 39, and the average number on the rolls was 4,103. In 1901 the number of schools was 97, and, including girls educated in mixed schools, female pupils numbered 14,427. There were 94 girls\u2019 schools in 1904\u20135 with 8,086 pupils, while 5,027 girls were being educated in mixed schools, giving a total of 9 per cent. of the female population of a school-going age. In the small girls\u2019 schools, in addition to the ordinary literary subjects, needlework and singing are taught, and in the more advanced schools, embroidery, drawing, singing, and cooking. Zanana classes have been in existence for some time. They are attended by grown-up women, who are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and needlework, in convenient hours when they are free from domestic duties. In 1904\u20135 there were 140 students in these classes.\n\nA training class for female teachers was opened in 1881, and has been developed into a female training college under the charge of a Lady Superintendent. The number of students on the rolls in 1904\u20135 was 26, of whom 7 completed their course and were employed by the department. A similar school for male teachers was opened in 1885 but abolished in 1898. It was reopened in 1905, in connexion with the technical school described below, and has 66 pupils.\n\nIn 1890 a technical school, called the Kala Bhavan, was established\nin the city of Baroda, and has since been improved and extended. It now includes classes for art, architecture, mechanical and chemical technology, weaving, and watch-making. The number of pupils rose from 175 in 1901 to 364 in 1904-5, and only a small proportion of the candidates for admission to the engineering class can be accommodated. Industrial schools at Padra, Vadnagar, and K\u0101thor are in charge of the Principal of the Kala Bhavan. The total expenditure on these institutions in 1904-5 was Rs. 53,000.\n\nSince 1886 schools where music is taught on scientific principles have been maintained in Baroda and other places. These are exceedingly popular, and contained 638 pupils in 1904-5. Music is also taught to girls in the training college and in the higher classes of the vernacular girls' schools.\n\nIn 1881 there were only 13 Muhammadan students in secondary schools, while primary schools contained 1,456. In 1891 there was one Muhammadan in the Baroda College, besides 32 in secondary and 5,123 in primary schools. In 1901 the number of Muhammadan pupils in the college was 3, in the secondary schools 69, and in the primary schools 7,639. A further rise took place in 1904-5, when 9,418 boys and 447 girls were attending schools. Muhammadan education has thus made rapid strides, though the number of those who desire higher instruction is small. Special Urd\u016b schools, numbering 39, have greatly helped the community. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 has recently founded handsome scholarships to assist Muhammadans in pursuing a university career.\n\nSpecial schools are maintained for the jungle tribes and for the castes regarded as unclean. The former are taught reading and writing, and are also trained in carpentry and agriculture at Songarh. Less success has been obtained with the unclean castes, but in 1904-5 the number of pupils was 1,715, or 10 per cent. of the children of a school-going age, including 68 girls. Education in these schools is entirely free.\n\nThe total State expenditure on education amounted to 4\u00b79 lakhs in 1891, to 8\u00b72 lakhs in 1901, and to 6\u00b77 lakhs in 1904-5, or about 5\u00bd annas per head of the population. A number of scholarships are also granted from the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101's privy purse at institutions in Bombay and Poona.\n\nThe Census of 1901 showed that out of every 1,000 of the population 87\u00b77 could read and write, the proportion rising to 162\u00b77 in the case of males, and being 7\u00b76 for females. Among P\u0101rsis 60 per cent. were literate, and among Jains 36 per cent., while Musalm\u0101ns (9\u00b74 per cent.) were rather more advanced than Hindus (8\u00b75 per cent.). The Animists are the most backward community, with only 3\u00b76 per cent.\n\nSince 1881 several newspapers have been started, and at present there are five in existence. These papers contain information on local subjects and are useful to the people. The State has given much encouragement\nto the publication of vernacular works, including many translations from English and Sanskrit books, and also treatises on history, music, games, cookery, &c.\n\nBefore 1855 the practice of medicine was entirely in the hands of vaidas and hakims. They numbered about 50, and their most important duty was to attend on the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, his relations, and his immediate followers, though they also practised among the townspeople. Native systems of medicine were followed, and the practitioners had no acquaintance with European science. In 1855 a hospital was opened in Baroda city, under the superintendence of the Residency Surgeon, but it was not until 1876 that a medical department was established. A European medical officer was called in to commence the work, and rapid progress was made. Many of the vaidas and hakims were pensioned, and their places were filled by properly qualified practitioners. The Say\u0101ji Rao Military Hospital and the Jann\u0101bai Civil Hospital were opened in the city in 1877. Civil hospitals were founded at the head-quarters of each prant, and dispensaries at most of the taluka head-quarters. A central medical store d\u00e9p\u00f4t was also established, and a chemical analyst appointed. Afterwards a veterinary hospital was added. In 1886 the magnificent building now known as the Countess of Dufferin Hospital was erected to take the place of the old State hospital, which had become unsuitable.\n\nStatistics of the progress made in providing for the medical needs of the people are shown below:\n\n|                  | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1904-5 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Number of hospitals and dispensaries | 34   | 43   | 51   | 40     |\n| Daily average attendance of in-patients | 212  | 207  | 492  | 248    |\n| Daily average attendance of out-patients | 1,994| 3,192| 3,736| 3,946  |\n| Number of operations | 6,947| 10,940| 9,232| 9,466  |\n| Expenditure on establishment Rs. | 78,544| 1,42,911| 1,39,720| 1,16,611|\n| \" medicines, &c. Rs. | 96,358| 62,833| 79,016| 50,786 |\n\nA lunatic asylum was opened at Baroda city in 1898, with accommodation for 28 patients\u201416 males and 12 females. The number of lunatics treated in 1904-5 was 27, and the expenditure amounted to Rs. 2,785. Most of the cases of insanity are ascribed to the excessive use of liquor and to the smoking of g\u0101nja.\n\nA vaccination department has been in existence for many years, and vaccination has been freely carried on among all classes of the people. In the city of Baroda both animal lymph and lymph taken from vaccinated children are used, but in other parts of the State human lymph is generally used, which is revived by bovine lymph from time to\ntime. In 1904-5 the staff consisted of 4 inspectors and 35 vaccinators, besides probationers and servants, and 60,872 persons were successfully vaccinated, or 31 per 1,000 of the population, the total cost being Rs. 13,800.\n\nThe Sanitary Commissioner supervises sanitary arrangements in villages, and his instructions and regulations are enforced by the local revenue officers and the police patels. These officers have the power of fining persons who by storing manure or in any other way cause nuisances dangerous to health. In 1905 duties connected with village sanitation were entrusted to the local boards.\n\nThe system of measurement followed in the State is an improved combination of chain and cross-staff survey. Villages mapped by the chain survey are now being surveyed. All tal\u0101tis and tajv\u012bzdars (subordinate revenue officials) have to pass an examination in revenue survey, so that they may be able to check boundary marks according to the village maps, to help the taluka officers in cases where survey units are divided, and inquire into field boundary disputes, encroachments, &c. There are also trained inspectors appointed to the different talukas to examine the boundary marks, and to see that the survey is maintained in all its details.\n\n[James Forbes: *Oriental Memoirs*, 4 vols.

Pr\u0101nt.\u2014A pr\u0101nt or district of the Baroda State, lying between 21\u00b0 50' and 22\u00b0 45' N. and 72\u00b0 35' and 73\u00b0 50' E., with an area of 1,887 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Kaira District of Bombay; on the west by Broach, Cambay, and part of Kaira; on the south by Broach and the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101; and on the east by the Rew\u0101 K\u0101nth\u0101 and the P\u0101nch Mah\u0101ls. Most of the pr\u0101nt forms a compact block between the Narbad\u0101 and the Mah\u012b, but the Petl\u0101d t\u0101luka lies separate, north of the latter river. The southern portion of the pr\u0101nt is largely composed of black soil, which, though fertile, produces few trees. In the north the red soil is thickly wooded. The pr\u0101nt is either traversed or skirted by the rivers Mah\u012b, Dh\u0101dh\u0101r, Narbad\u0101, Vishw\u0101mitri, Sury\u0101, Meni, Or, Hiran, Unchh, and Oswan.\n\nThe country is largely under cultivation, and the vegetation therefore consists chiefly of the crops with their accompanying weeds. The hedges enclosing fields consist of shrubs like Macrura, Cadaba, Diospyros, Celastrus, with occasionally fleshy species of Euphorbia; associated with these shrubby species are trees of Bombax malabaricum. The climbing plants in the hedges include species of Leguminosae, Convolvulaceae, Menispermaceae, and Asclepiadaceae. In waste places and on waysides occur Tephrosia purpurca, Heylandia latiflora, Waltheria indica, Hibiscus Gibsoni, Argemone mexicana, and similar species. In the neighbourhood of dwellings are seen mangoes, tamarinds, baels, several species of Ficus, Anona squamosa, Jatropha Curcas, and other more or less useful planted or sub-spontaneous species.\n\nThe population in 1872 was estimated at 747,437, and at the next two enumerations it was (1881) 761,501, (1891) 817,023; while in 1901 it was only 644,971, of whom 523,999 were Hindus, 36,713 Animists, 64,148 Musalm\u0101ns, and 10,916 Jains. The terrible diminution in the population was due to the disastrous effects of famine and plague. The pr\u0101nt is divided into nine t\u0101lukas and two petas or sub-t\u0101lukas, the population of which in 1901 is shown in the table on the next page.\n\nThe principal towns are Baroda City, Petl\u0101d, Dabhol, Sojitr\u0101, V\u0101so, P\u0101dra, Nar, Pihi, and Sinor. Gujar\u0101t\u012b is spoken by 93 per cent. of the population, and Hindust\u0101ni by 5 per cent., while nearly a fourth of the inhabitants of the city use Mar\u0101th\u012b. In 1901 the pr\u0101nt contained 6,943 native Christians. The American Methodist Episcopal Mission has adherents in 125 villages and towns, numbering approximately 5,200. In addition to two orphanages, it provides a training school for teachers and preachers, and fifty-five day-schools.\n\nThe prevailing black soil is very fertile, and requires little manure or irrigation, while gor\u0101t or sandy loam needs both. The Petl\u0101d t\u0101luka is noted for the cultivation of tobacco. The chief crops are rice, bajra,\njow\u0101r, wheat, math, gram, adad, tuver, val, chola, tal, diveli, cotton, sugar-cane, kasumbo, and tobacco. Many other minor crops and vegetable products are raised for local consumption.\n\n| Taluka          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Baroda (city excluded) | 160                 | ...             | 110      | 60,428     | 332                       | -37\u00b74                                                        | 6,375                                  |\n| P\u0101dra           | 106                 | 1               | 82       | 73,395     | 374                       | -20\u00b75                                                        | 6,727                                  |\n| Petl\u0101d          | 181                 | 7               | 68       | 134,558    | 743                       | -14\u00b71                                                        | 17,001                                 |\n| S\u0101vli           | 188                 | 1               | 75       | 38,340     | 204                       | -14\u00b76                                                        | 3,250                                  |\n| Sisva           | 83                  | 1               | 30       | 43,491     | 524                       | -19\u00b74                                                        | 4,232                                  |\n| Chor\u0101nda        | 284                 | ...             | 99       | 48,758     | 208                       | -22\u00b72                                                        | 5,128                                  |\n| Vaghodia        | 143                 | ...             | 71       | 20,804     | 145                       | -23\u00b79                                                        | 1,087                                  |\n| Dabhoi          | 190                 | 1               | 102      | 49,977     | 258                       | -17\u00b78                                                        | 6,319                                  |\n| Sinor           | 139                 | 1               | 45       | 29,979     | 216                       | -23\u00b73                                                        | 4,339                                  |\n| Sankheda        | 280                 | 2               | 190      | 36,665     | 159                       | -35\u00b77                                                        | 3,072                                  |\n| Tilakw\u0101da       | 34                  | 1               | 32       | 4,816      | 141                       | -48\u00b72                                                        | 304                                    |\n| **Total**       | **1,878**           | **15**          | **904**  | **540,281**| **288**                   | **-22\u00b79**                                                   | **57,834**                             |\n| Baroda city with cantonment | 9                  | 2               | ...      | 103,790    | 11,532                   | -12\u00b72                                                       | 21,678                                |\n\nThe weaving of coarse cotton cloth is the chief industry. But in addition may be mentioned the manufacture of fine turbans at Dabhoi, of cloths at Sojitr\u0101, Petl\u0101d, and Bakrol, of embroidery with gold and silver thread at Baroda, and of gold and silver ornaments in most towns. Iron-work is poor, but good locks are made at Petl\u0101d, Sojitr\u0101, and V\u0101so. Excellent brass and copper pots are manufactured everywhere. The only cotton-mill is at Baroda, but there are twenty-six ginning factories. A dyeing factory has been working at Petl\u0101d for some years. The chief centres of trade are Baroda, Dabhoi, Ch\u0101ndod, and Petl\u0101d, which are connected by rail. The pr\u0101nt is well provided with communications, as the main line of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway runs from north to south, with a State branch from Anand to Petl\u0101d and Cambay, and narrow-gauge lines connect Dabhoi with Bodeli, Ch\u0101ndod, Sinor, and Mobha. In addition, the Baroda-Godhra chord line on the broad gauge crosses the pr\u0101nt. The chief roads are those from Baroda to P\u0101dra, Makarpura, Ajwa, and S\u0101vli, from Petl\u0101d to Sojitr\u0101, and from Ch\u0101ndod to Sinor.\n\nThe land revenue decreased from 37\u00b79 lakhs in 1881 to 36\u00b78 in 1891, but rose to 39\u00b78 lakhs in 1901. In 1904\u20135 the demand was 30\u00b77 lakhs, but owing to famine only 23\u00b78 lakhs was collected. The average assessment per bigha (\u00bc acre) varies from about R. 0\u00b73\u20139 in P\u0101dra to Rs. 4 in Sinor. The pr\u0101nt was settled for fifteen years between 1888 and 1893, and a revision is now in progress.\nBesides Baroda city the pr\u0101nt contains ten municipalities: namely, Dabhoi, Petl\u0101d, P\u0101dra, Sinor, Sojitr\u0101, V\u0101so, S\u0101yli, Bh\u0101dran, Sankheda, and Makarpura. Their funds, amounting to Rs. 14,800 in 1904\u20135, besides the income from customs, excise, and tolls in Dabhoi, are provided by the State. A District board and local boards were constituted in 1905.\n\nThe pr\u0101nt is administered by the S\u016bbah, whose head-quarters are at Baroda city. The pr\u0101nt Judge also holds his court at the same place.\n\nEducation is well provided for, there being a college in Baroda city and also a high school, while the number of Anglo-vernacular schools is 6, and of vernacular schools 476. These schools were attended in 1904\u20135 by 35,780 pupils. The pr\u0101nt contains a civil hospital, a leper hospital, a lunatic asylum, and 10 dispensaries, in which 131,322 patients were relieved in 1904\u20135, of whom 1,044 were in-patients.\n\nBaroda T\u0101luka.\u2014Central t\u0101luka of the Baroda pr\u0101nt, Baroda State, with an area of 160 square miles. Excluding the city, the population fell from 96,387 in 1891 to 60,428 in 1901. It contains 110 villages, besides the city and cantonment. The t\u0101luka is a level plain watered by five rivers, the Mah\u012b, Meni, Rungal, J\u0101mbva, and Vishw\u0101mitri. The prevailing soil is black, though two other classes, gor\u0101t, or sandy loam, and bes\u0101r, a mixed soil, are found interspersed with it. The chief crops grown are dangar, jow\u0101r, bajra, tuver, tal, math, shi\u0101lu, and cotton. In 1904\u20135 the land revenue was Rs. 3,68,000.\n\nBaroda City.\u2014Capital of the Baroda State, situated in 22\u00b0 18' N. and 73\u00b0 15' E., on the Vishw\u0101mitri river, 244\u00bd miles from Bombay by rail, and 61\u00bd miles south-by-south-east of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. The population at the last three enumerations was: (1881) 106,512, (1891) 116,420, and (1901) 103,790. In 1901 Hindus numbered 80,834, Musalm\u0101ns 18,770, and Jains 2,266.\n\nThe municipal board, reconstituted in 1906, has an income of about 2 lakhs, derived from octroi, fines levied for permission to erect new houses, &c., sales of land, and a conservancy tax. In 1904\u20135 the expenditure was 2\u00b74 lakhs, the chief items being roads (Rs. 91,000), conservancy (Rs. 61,000), and administration (Rs. 32,000). The aspect, comfort, and health of the city have recently been considerably improved. A free supply of filtered water, supplied from the Ajwa reservoir, is distributed to every street by means of pipes. Drainage works are being constructed to carry off storm water and sullage from the houses. New roads have been constructed, old roads have been made wider, new buildings have been erected on every side, old and inconvenient ones have been removed, the streets are clean and well lighted, and conservancy is carefully attended to.\n\nThe city proper is enclosed by the old walls of the fort. It is approached from the railway station by a road which, at first broad and\nstraight, gradually becomes narrower and more tortuous. Close to the station is the magnificent building erected for the Baroda College, at a cost of more than 6 lakhs. It is situated in a spacious compound, which also contains residential quarters for students, a fine botanical garden, a cricket ground, a tennis court, and a gymnasium. A little farther is the entrance of the public park, and across the Vishw\u0101mitri stands the Countess of Dufferin Hospital, a handsome modern building, with wards for male in-patients, and the Victoria Jubilee ward for female in-patients. Just beyond it, and on the same side, is the Say\u0101ji Rao Military Hospital, for the reception of the sick from all regiments of the Baroda forces. In the suburbs of the city stands the house of the famous minister Gang\u0101dhar S\u0101stri, while close by a steep ascent up a short hill leads to what is called the J\u016bna Kot, or old fort, probably the most ancient portion of the Hindu town of Baroda. The principal offices of the State are located here, and just opposite is the new Survey Office. A large building has recently been constructed for the safe custody of records. The State Library, a small but handsome erection, is close to the Record Office. From the Laharipura or western gate a broad and picturesque street leads through the city to the clock-tower. At right angles to this street branch off pots or wards belonging to distinct classes and castes of people, and forming culs-de-sac the entrances of which are barred by heavy doors. Close to the clock-tower is the old palace in which the Gaikw\u0101rs lived formerly; and immediately behind it, rising high above surrounding buildings, stands the white stucco Nazar B\u0101gh palace which was erected by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Malh\u0101r Rao. The Gaikw\u0101r\u2019s jewels, which are stored here, have been valued at over 3 crores. They include a diamond necklace, one of the stones of which is known as \u2018the Star of the South,\u2019 a brilliant of perfect water weighing 125 carats (originally 254\u00bd), estimated to be worth 9 lakhs, and a cloth embroidered with precious stones and seed pearls which was designed to cover the Prophet\u2019s tomb at Mecca. Not far from the Nazar B\u0101gh is an old building containing a fine library collected by Sampat Rao Gaikw\u0101r. The Nazar B\u0101gh adjoins a continuation of the Laharipura street, terminating in the eastern or Water Gate. On its southern side are the military office, and the lines where the gold and silver guns are kept. Just beyond the Water Gate is the arena where public sports are still held. From the clock-tower a road leads to the Ch\u0101mp\u0101ner Gate, and another to the Rhinoceros or South Gate. Near the western gate is the Surs\u0101gar, a large reservoir of water with stone banks, and masonry steps in places. The length of this tank is 1,057 feet, its width 665 feet, and its average depth 12 feet. In the neighbourhood is the Chimn\u0101bai Ny\u0101ya Mandir, or \u2018temple of justice,\u2019 occupied by the High Court, and named after the late Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u012b Chimn\u0101bai. Close to it are two other fine structures, the female\ntraining college and the Anglo-vernacular school. Another educational building is the Kala Bhavan, a technical institution where students learn dyeing, weaving, carpentry, smithy-work, drawing, &c. The Central jail is a carefully constructed building arranged on modern principles. The public park contains a museum, beautiful gardens, and a collection of wild animals. Just beyond the park is the lunatic asylum, a new and spacious building.\n\nBesides the Nazar B\u0101gh palace, the Makarpura palace is situated about 4 miles to the south of the city. It was originally erected by Khande Rao, but has been much enlarged and improved. It is now surrounded by fine gardens containing fountains, grottoes, and pergolas, and is used by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 as a country residence. The chief palace is, however, the Lakshmi Vil\u0101s, a building in the Hindu-Saracenic style, which cost about 60 lakhs. It contains a large Darb\u0101r hall, with mosaic decorations on the walls and a mosaic floor specially executed by Italian workmen, and covered wooden galleries reserved for ladies. The palace is well furnished, and contains bronze statues and costly paintings by European artists. The grounds have been laid out by an English landscape gardener, and add greatly to the attractiveness of the palace.\n\nThere are many other objects of interest in Baroda, of which perhaps the most notable are the Hindu temples which crowd the city. Close to the stone bridge which crosses the Vishw\u0101mitri are the temples raised to the memory of several members of the Gaikw\u0101r family, as well as two temples to Mah\u0101deo. Other temples of importance are Bande's, which has the largest allowance from the State; the Sidhn\u0101th temple, Lakshman Bava's Mandir, K\u0101lik\u0101's temple, and Bolai's temple, all of which are supported by the State. There are also the temples of Khandoba, the tutelary god of the Gaikw\u0101r family, and those of Bechr\u0101ji and Bh\u012bmn\u0101th, where Br\u0101hmans undergo penance for the spiritual welfare of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101's house. Ganpati's Mandir and the temple to K\u0101shi Vishveshvar mark the liberality and religious aspirations of the late Gop\u0101l Rao Mair\u0101l, banker, financier, and minister. The chief Gujar\u0101t temples are those of Narsinhji, Govardhan-N\u0101thji, and Baldevaji, while high above all other buildings in the city, except the Nazar B\u0101gh, towers the temple built by the followers of Sw\u0101mi N\u0101r\u0101yan.\n\nThere is no characteristic art in Barod\u0101 deserving of special mention. A few artisans are proficient in wood-carving, some in lacquer-work, and some in iron grille work suitable for balcony railings. Calico-printing is also carried on to meet the demand for cheap cotton s\u0101ris. Embroidery with gold and silver thread of a superior description is produced to a small extent. A cotton spinning and weaving-mill built by the State was transferred to a private firm in 1905, and other mills are being built.\n\nThe cantonment or Camp lies north-west of the city, from which it is\nseparated by the Vishw\u0101mitri. Its area is about 2 square miles, and its population (1901) 3,162. The garrison consists of a regiment of native infantry belonging to the Indian army. In or near the cantonment are the church consecrated by Bishop Heber in 1825, the Residency (just outside the boundary line), a stone column raised to the memory of Mr. Williams a former Resident, the American Methodist Episcopal Church and orphanages (280 boys, 260 girls), vernacular schools for boys and girls, and a school for European children maintained by the Government of India and the Baroda State jointly.\n\nBaroda Town.\u2014Town in the Sheopur district of Gwalior State, Central India, situated in $25^\\circ 29' N.$ and $76^\\circ 42' E.$ Population (1901), 6,381. Baroda is now the chief town of the Sheopur-Baroda j\u0101g\u012br, subordinate to Gwalior. The holders are Gaur R\u0101jputs from Bengal. In the twelfth century Bachh R\u0101j established himself at Ajmer, whence the family were driven by the Muhammadans about two hundred years later. For services rendered to the Delhi emperors certain lands were granted to them, including the territory lying between the P\u0101rbati and Kunt\u012b rivers; and Sheopur, 12 miles north of Baroda, became their head-quarters. During the Mar\u0101th\u0101 inroads of the eighteenth century the R\u0101j\u0101 was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Sindhia. Subsequently Daulat Rao Sindhia assigned the lands then held by R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101dhika D\u0101s of Sheopur to his general Jean Baptiste Filose, who compelled the R\u0101j\u0101 to relinquish them. R\u0101dhika D\u0101s was, however, permitted to retain a portion of his former territory, including twenty-three villages, and to take up his residence at Baroda. In 1813 twelve additional villages were assigned to him. In 1857 the R\u0101j\u0101 revolted and his estates were confiscated, but were restored in 1859, through the mediation of the Resident at Gwalior. The present holder is R\u0101j\u0101 Bijai Singh, who succeeded in 1865.\n\nBaroda.\u2014Village in the Goh\u0101na tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab. See Barauda.\n\nBarot.\u2014Town in the B\u0101ghpat tahsil of Meerut District, United Provinces. See Baraut.\n\nBarpet\u0101 Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, lying between $26^\\circ 5'$ and $26^\\circ 49' N.$ and $90^\\circ 39'$ and $91^\\circ 17' E.$, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, with an area of 1,274 square miles. In 1901 the population was 115,935, compared with 135,705 in 1891. It contains one town, Barpet\u0101 (population, 8,747), the head-quarters, and 600 villages. The land revenue and local rates amounted in 1903\u20134 to Rs. 2,54,000. The subdivision is sparsely peopled, and there are only 91 persons per square mile, as compared with 153 in the District as a whole. The decrease of nearly 15 per cent. in the last intercensal period was due to exceptional unhealthiness and to the damage done by the earthquake of 1897. The\nannual rainfall averages 96 inches at Barpet\u0101, but nearer the Him\u0101layas it is considerably higher. The subdivision has always been liable to injury from flood, and since 1897 this liability has been seriously increased. Mustard was at one time extensively grown on the marshes that fringe the bank of the Brahmaputra, but the land now frequently remains too cold and wet to admit of a crop being raised. In the northern mauzas, which are almost exclusively inhabited by Kach\u0101ris, rich crops of rice are raised on fields irrigated from the hill streams. Elsewhere bao, a long-stemmed variety of winter rice, is the staple crop.\n\nBarpet\u0101 Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in K\u0101mr\u016bp District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in 26\u00b0 19' N. and 91\u00b0 1' E., on the right bank of the Chaulkho\u0101, connected by a cart-road with the Khol\u0101banda gh\u0101\u1e6d on the Brahmaputra about 15 miles away. Population has steadily decreased during the last thirty years, and was only 8,747 in 1901. Barpet\u0101 is famous as the site of a sattra or religious college founded by the Vaishnavite reformer Sankar Deb at the end of the fifteenth century. The ground surrounding the sattra is considered holy, and is crowded with native huts, huddled together in the most insanitary propinquity. The town has always been liable to flood; but since the earthquake of 1897 the annual inundations have been more extensive, and for some time the prisoners, the treasure, and the office records had to be kept in boats. It contains a hospital with four beds, and a high school which in 1903-4 had an average attendance of 113 boys. Barpet\u0101 was formed into a municipality in 1886. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 10,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 9,000, including taxes on houses and lands (Rs. 3,500) and a grant from Provincial revenues (Rs. 2,500); while the expenditure was Rs. 16,000, the chief items being conservancy (Rs. 3,300) and public works (Rs. 10,000). Barpet\u0101 is one of the few places in Assam where the Assamese have displayed any commercial aptitude. They retain all business in their own hands, and there is a considerable trade in mustard seed and other country produce. The manufactures are not important, but include canoes, earthenware well rings, and artistic gold filigree work.\n\nBarrackpore Subdivision.\u2014North-western subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 35' and 22\u00b0 57' N. and 88\u00b0 21' and 88\u00b0 31' E., on the left bank of the Hooghly, with an area of 190 square miles. The subdivision, which was formed in 1904 from portions of the Sadar and B\u0101r\u0101sat subdivisions, consists of a long narrow strip of riparian land and contains a number of low-lying swamps, but the parts along the banks of the Hooghly are higher and healthier. The population in 1901 was 206,311, the density being 1,086 persons per square mile. The bank\nof the Hooghly north of Calcutta is lined with mills, which provide labour for a large industrial population. The subdivision contains twelve towns, all lying within this tract: Naihati (population, 13,604), Halisahar (10,149), Bhatapara (21,540), Garulia (7,375), Barrackpore North (12,600) and South (19,307), Titagarh (16,065), Panihatia (11,178), Kamarkati (13,216), Baranagar (25,432), and Dum-Dum North (9,916) and South (10,904). The remainder of the inhabitants live in 163 villages. The head-quarters of the subdivision are at Barrackpore, historically important as the scene of the outbreak of two mutinies. Cantonments are situated within the North Dum-Dum and South Barrackpore municipalities, and there is a Government ammunition factory at Dum-Dum. Barrackpore also contains the suburban residence of the Viceroy.\n\n**Barrackpore Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 46' N. and 88\u00b0 21' E., on the east bank of the Hooghly river, 15 miles above Calcutta. The town is comprised within two municipalities: North and South Barrackpore, containing, in 1901, 12,600 and 19,307 inhabitants respectively. South Barrackpore includes Barrackpore cantonment, with a population in 1901 of 9,888. The name is probably derived from the fact of troops having been stationed here since 1772; the natives call the place Chananak. To the south of the cantonment is Barrackpore Park, which has been laid out with much taste; it contains the suburban residence of the Viceroy of India, built by Lord Minto and enlarged by the Marquis of Hastings. The military force stationed at Barrackpore consists of a field battery, a company of British infantry, and a native infantry regiment.\n\nBarrackpore has played a part in two mutinies. In 1824, when Bengal troops were required to take part in the Burmese War, the 47th Bengal Infantry, which was stationed here, was warned for foreign service. Alarmed by rumours that they were to be transported to Rangoon by sea, the regiment mutinied on parade on October 30. After ineffectual attempts at conciliation, the regiment was paraded on November 1 in presence of Sir Edward Paget, the Commander-in-Chief, who directed them either to obey the orders to march or to ground their arms. Upon their refusal, a battery of European artillery, supported by two British regiments, opened fire upon the mutineers, who broke at once and made for the river, throwing away their arms. Some were shot, some drowned, and others hanged; and the number of the regiment was removed from the Army List.\n\nThe first sparks of the Mutiny of 1857 were kindled in Barrackpore. The excitement which had been rapidly spreading among the native troops culminated on March 29, when Mangal Pande, a sepoy of the 34th Native Infantry, attempted to kill one of the officers, Lieutenant\nBough, fired at a European sergeant-major, and called upon his comrades to join him. These outrages were committed within a few yards of the quarter-guard, which took no steps to interfere. As a punishment for this mutinous behaviour, the regiment was disbanded with ignominy on May 6, Mangal Pande and the native officer in charge of the guard having been previously tried by court-martial and hanged. A full account of these events will be found in Sir John Kaye's History of the Sepoy War, vol. i, pp. 266\u20139, 495.\n\nBarrackpore is an important station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, and the head-quarters of the recently constituted Barrackpore subdivision. It contains the usual public offices, a sub-jail with accommodation for 14 prisoners, and the Bhol\u0101 N\u0101th Bose Hospital with 18 beds. The town is a favourite residence of Europeans, and the Christian population numbers 914.\n\nThe North Barrackpore municipality was constituted in 1869. The income and expenditure during the eight years ending 1903\u20134 averaged Rs. 11,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 13,000, including Rs. 5,000 from a tax on persons and the same amount from a conservancy rate; and the expenditure was Rs. 11,600. The municipal office is at Naw\u0101bganj, the residence of the Mandal family of zamind\u0101rs. Within the municipal area is Palt\u0101, where the Calcutta water-works are situated, and Ich\u0101pur, where there is a Government rifle factory. The Garulia municipality was separated from North Barrackpore in 1896.\n\nThe South Barrackpore municipality was also constituted in 1869. Its area has been curtailed of late years by the separation of the Titagarh municipality in 1895 and of the P\u0101n\u012bh\u0101t\u012b municipality in 1900. The income during the four years ending 1903\u20134 averaged Rs. 10,000, and the expenditure Rs. 9,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 11,000, mainly from a tax on persons (or property tax), a conservancy rate, and a tax on houses and lands; and the expenditure was Rs. 9,000. The municipal office is at Khardah.\n\nThe receipts and expenditure of the cantonment fund during the decade ending 1901 averaged Rs. 25,000, and in 1903\u20134 they were Rs. 34,000 and Rs. 33,000 respectively.\n\nBarren Island.\u2014A volcanic island in the Andaman Sea, lying about 71 miles north-east of Port Blair. See Andaman Islands.\n\nBars\u0101na.\u2014Town in the Chh\u0101ta tahsil of Muttra District, United Provinces, situated in 27\u00b0 39' N. and 77\u00b0 23' E., 31 miles north-west of Muttra city. Population (1901), 3,542. According to modern Hindu belief, this was one of the favourite residences of Krishna's mistress, R\u0101dh\u0101. It lies at the foot and on the slope of a hill originally dedicated to Brahm\u0101. The hill has four peaks, each crowned with buildings erected during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; and the importance of the place dates from the settlement here of\na Br\u0101hma\u1e47 who had been family priest to the R\u0101j\u0101s of Bharatpur, Gwalior, and Indore early in the eighteenth century. In 1774 the J\u0101ts under Sumr\u016b were defeated near Bars\u0101na by the imperial troops, who plundered the town. A magnificent new temple is being built by the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Jaipur.\n\nB\u0101rsi T\u0101luka.\u2014T\u0101luka of Shol\u0101pur District, Bombay, lying between 17\u00b0 57' and 18\u00b0 26' N. and 75\u00b0 36' and 76\u00b0 7' E., surrounded on all sides by the Niz\u0101m's Dominions, with an area of 596 square miles. There are two towns, B\u0101rsi (population, 24,242), the head-quarters, and Vair\u0101g (5,163); and 122 villages. The population in 1901 was 139,435, compared with 140,322 in 1891. With the exception of the Shol\u0101pur t\u0101luka, B\u0101rsi is the most thickly populated in the District, with a density of 234 persons per square mile. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 2 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 14,000. The t\u0101luka is crossed by several streams, and is, on the whole, well wooded. The villages are small, and lie chiefly on river banks. B\u0101rsi has a better climate and a more plentiful and regular rainfall than the rest of Shol\u0101pur.\n\nB\u0101rsi Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the t\u0101luka of the same name in Shol\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 18\u00b0 14' N. and 75\u00b0 41' E. Population (1901), 24,242, including Hindus, 20,881; Musalm\u0101ns, 2,785; and Jains, 515. B\u0101rsi is an important centre of trade, with a large export of cotton, linseed and other oilseeds, chiefly to Bombay. There are seven cotton presses, employing about 500 persons. The town is connected with B\u0101rsi Road station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway by the B\u0101rsi Light Railway, opened in 1897. It possesses a fine temple of Bhagw\u0101n, richly ornamented. The municipality, constituted in 1865, had an average income during the decade ending 1901 of Rs. 36,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 51,000. B\u0101rsi contains a Subordinate Judge's court, eight schools, including one for girls, attended by 411 and 52 pupils respectively, and two dispensaries, one of which belongs to the railway company. The water-supply is obtained from a reservoir built in 1877 at a cost of Rs. 28,000. The reservoir, which covers an area of 65 acres near the town, is designed to contain 19,000,000 cubic feet of water.\n\nB\u0101rsi T\u0101kli.\u2014Town in the District and t\u0101luk of Akola, Ber\u0101r, situated in 20\u00b0 35' N. and 77\u00b0 7' E. Population (1901), 6,288. At this place there is a remarkably fine Hem\u0101dpanti temple, with an inscription giving the date Saka 1098 (A.D. 1176), which is probably the date of its construction.\n\nB\u0101rsoi.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Purnea District, Bengal, situated in 25\u00b0 38' N. and 87\u00b0 53' E., on the east bank of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101. Population (1901), 3,101. It is a railway junction on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, from which a branch runs to\nKishanganj. It has one of the largest weekly markets in the District, the chief articles of trade being dried fish, tortoises, gur, country-made cloth, chillies, turmeric, onions, jute, and mustard. Gunny-bags and mats of local manufacture are also largely sold.\n\nB\u0101ruipur.\u2014Town in the head-quarters subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in $22^\\circ 21'$ N. and $88^\\circ 27'$ E., on the banks of the Adi Gang\u0101 (original bed of the Ganges), 15 miles south of Calcutta. Population (1901), 4,217. The town was formerly the head-quarters of a subdivision of the same name, which was amalgamated with the Alipore subdivision in 1883. B\u0101ruipur derives its name from the extensive cultivation of p\u0101n (Piper Betle) by the B\u0101rui caste. The town is a mission station of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and contains a large church. B\u0101ruipur was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income during the decade ending 1901\u20132 averaged Rs. 4,700, and the expenditure Rs. 4,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 6,900, including Rs. 3,000 derived from a tax on persons; and the expenditure was Rs. 7,200.\n\nB\u0101rul.\u2014Village in the Asansol subdivision of Burdwan District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 44'$ N. and $87^\\circ 7'$ E. Population (1901), 532. It lies in the middle of the iron-ore tract and has given its name to the surrounding iron-ore field. The total amount of ore extracted in 1900 was 57,000 tons, or nearly three times the quantity obtained ten years previously.\n\nBar\u016br.\u2014Town in Amraoti District, Berar. See Warud.\n\nB\u0101ruva.\u2014Seaport and station on the East Coast Railway in the Sompeta tahsil of Ganjam District, Madras, situated in $18^\\circ 53'$ N. and $84^\\circ 36'$ E. Population (1901), 4,161. Coco-nut oil and coir rope are made in the neighbourhood. The port, which is open only to coasting trade, is marked by two obelisks 50 feet high, built on a site 15 feet above the sea, bearing north-west from the usual anchorage. Government has planted a casuarina grove to the south-west of the custom-house to protect the building from drifting sand, and this also serves as a landmark to mariners. The only steamers touching at the port are those of the British India Steam Navigation Company, which call weekly on their voyages between Cocanada and Rangoon. In 1903\u20134, 9,500 native passengers travelled to Burma and 7,650 returned by these boats. In the same year the exports to Burma, chiefly coir rope and dried fish, were valued at Rs. 13,000. There were no imports from Burma.\n\nBarw\u0101ha (or Barwai).\u2014Town in the Nim\u0101r district of Indore State, Central India, situated in $22^\\circ 15'$ N. and $76^\\circ 3'$ E., 33 miles south of Mhow cantonment on the Indore-Khandwa road and the Khandwa-Ajmer branch of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, which both cross the Narbad\u0101 by a fine bridge 2 miles south of the town. It\noccupies a picturesque site on the bank of the Choral, a tributary of the Narbad\u0101. Population (1901), 6,094. Barw\u0101ha, which is said to have been originally called Babulikhera, was founded in 1678 by R\u0101n\u0101 S\u016braj Mal, an ancestor of the present zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. It is a place of some importance, and was always a favourite resort with Sivaji Rao Holkar, who built a fine palace on the ridge overlooking the Choral valley. An old fort, now used for the district offices, and an old temple to Jayant\u012b M\u0101ta stand near the town. A municipal committee has been formed, which has an income of Rs. 1,300 a year, chiefly derived from octroi and other taxes. The town contains a British and a State post office, a school, a dispensary, a sarai, and a Public Works inspection bungalow.\n\n**Barw\u0101ni State.**\u2014A guaranteed chiefship in Central India, under the Bhop\u0101war Agency, lying between $21^\\circ 36'$ and $22^\\circ 7'$ N. and $74^\\circ 28'$ and $75^\\circ 16'$ E., along the left bank of the Narbad\u0101 river, with an area of 1,178 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Dh\u0101r State; on the north-west by Al\u012b-R\u0101jpur; on the east by a portion of the Indore State; and on the south and west by the Kh\u0101ndesh District of Bombay. The State lies generally in the hilly tracts division of Central India, but falls internally into two subdivisions: that of the Narbad\u0101 valley district, formed of a fertile alluvial plain; and the remainder of the State, which is rough and hilly. Much of the country is very picturesque, with a succession of ranges and valleys covered with thick forest. In these valleys many traces of former prosperity are met with, such as ruined forts, mosques, and dwelling-houses, now overgrown with jungle, but once used by the Mughal nobles and officials of the Bij\u0101garh sark\u0101r of the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. The climate is subject to greater extremes of heat than M\u0101lw\u0101, while the cold season is of short duration. The annual rainfall, as recorded at Barw\u0101ni, averages 22 inches.\n\nThe chiefs of Barw\u0101ni are Sesodia R\u0101jputs, connected with the house of Udaipur. Tradition traces their descent from the second son of B\u0101p\u0101 R\u0101wal, the founder of that house, one of whose descendants migrated in the eleventh or fourteenth century into the Narbad\u0101 districts, and fixed his residence at Av\u0101sgarh, a hill fort about 8 miles from Jalgun. The history of the line is for the most part lost in obscurity. According to the State records there have been in all fifty-one R\u0101n\u0101s; but little is known of them, and it is difficult to determine the time at which many of them lived. Paras R\u0101m (Pars\u0101n) Singh, the thirty-fifth chief, was defeated by the Muhammadans, and taken a prisoner to Delhi, where he embraced Isl\u0101m on the condition that he should be allowed to retain his ancestral estates. His successor Bhim Singh and the two R\u0101n\u0101s who followed, though nominally Hindus, were virtually Muhammadans. About 1650 Chandra Singh, forty-first of the line, finding that Av\u0101sgarh was too weak a position, moved the capital to Barw\u0101ni;\nand the State has since then been known by its present name. In the time of Mohan Singh, son and successor of Chandra Singh, the greater part of the State was seized by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. This period marks the decline of the house; and though the Barw\u0101n\u012b R\u0101n\u0101s managed to keep their independence, and were never actually tributary to any of the great M\u0101lw\u0101 chiefs, they were finally left with the small strip of territory they now hold instead of their former extensive domains. In 1794 R\u0101n\u0101 Mohan Singh II succeeded, and was ruling during the settlement of M\u0101lw\u0101 by Sir John Malcolm. He died in 1839 and was succeeded by his son Jaswant Singh, who, in 1861, was removed from the administration owing to his incapacity, but was restored to power in 1873, and dying in 1880 was succeeded by his brother Indrajit, whose administration was also not a success. On his death in 1894, his eldest son, Ranjit Singh the present chief, succeeded at the age of six. During his minority he was educated at the Mayo College at Ajmer. The chief bears the title of R\u0101n\u0101, and receives a salute of 9 guns.\n\nPopulation has been: (1881) 56,445, (1891) 80,266, and (1901) 76,136. The number increased by 42 per cent. between 1881 and 1891, but fell by 5 per cent. during the last decade. The density is 65 persons per square mile. Hindus number 38,670, or 50 per cent.; Animists (chiefly Bhil\u0101las), 32,894, or 43 per cent.; and Musalm\u0101ns, 4,197. The true percentage for Animists is higher than stated above, as large numbers of Bhil\u0101las returned themselves as Hindus, the total of those speaking Bhil dialects giving 68 per cent. of the population, which is nearer the truth. The State possesses one town, Barw\u0101n\u012b (population, 6,277), the capital; and 333 villages. Almost the entire population is composed of jungle tribes, who, though describing themselves as agriculturists, in fact do but little cultivation. Agriculture supports 65 per cent. of the inhabitants, and general labour 6 per cent.\n\nThe total area is thus distributed: cultivated, 302 square miles, or 26 per cent., of which 3 square miles are irrigated; forest, 566 square miles, or 48 per cent.; cultivable land not under cultivation, 152 square miles; waste, 158 square miles. Of the cropped area, jow\u0101r covers 61 square miles; b\u0101jra, 56; cotton, 39; t\u012bl, 31; maize, 20; wheat, 5; gram, 4 square miles; and poppy only 12 acres. Cattle-breeding has always been a speciality of this region, bullocks of the Nim\u0101r breed being much in demand, on account of their size and strength. Unfortunately, of late years breeding has not been very systematically carried on.\n\nThe rates of assessment are fixed according to the capability of the soil, varying from Rs. 2\u20136\u20135 to Rs. 8 per acre for irrigated land along the Narbad\u0101; from Rs. 2\u20136\u20135 to Rs. 3\u20131\u20130 per acre for unirrigated lands, and 6 annas for the rocky soils of the hills. Special rates are given to Bhil cultivators to induce them to settle, only Rs. 7\u20138\u20130 being\ndemanded from them per 'plough' (15 acres) of land, where other cultivators pay Rs. 20.\n\nThe distance of the State from all railways has delayed the development of trade, although much has been done of late years to increase facility of communication by the construction of feeder-roads in connexion with the Agra-Bombay trunk road, the principal route for traffic. In 1891 there were only 7 miles of metalled roads in the State. There are now 118 miles, providing feeders to the Agra-Bombay trunk road. The road from Barw\u0101n\u012b town to Julw\u0101nia is the general route for goods and passengers passing to the railway at Mhow, the nearest station, which is 80 miles distant from Barw\u0101n\u012b. Four British post offices are maintained\u2014at Barw\u0101n\u012b, Anjar, R\u0101jpur, and Khetia\u2014and State offices at other places, with a telegraph office at Barw\u0101n\u012b.\n\nThe State is divided into four parganas, each in charge of a kam\u0101sd\u0101r, with head-quarters at Anjad, P\u0101nsemal, Sil\u0101wad, and R\u0101jpur. The chief, when exercising powers, has complete civil and revenue control, but in criminal matters submits all cases punishable under the Indian Penal Code with seven years' imprisonment or over for trial by the Political Agent, while sentences by the chief of two years' imprisonment or over have to be confirmed by that officer. All appeals from subordinate courts lie to the chief. The British codes, modified to suit local usage, have been adopted in the courts. The State being at present under British administration owing to the minority of the R\u0101n\u0101, the general control lies with the Political officer. The medical and forest departments are in charge of the Agency Surgeon and Forest officer, respectively.\n\nThe total revenue is 4.5 lakhs, of which 1.9 lakhs is derived from land, Rs. 28,000 from forests, Rs. 30,000 from customs, and Rs. 29,000 from excise. The land revenue demand amounts to 15 annas per cultivated acre, and 4 annas per acre of total area. The chief heads of expenditure are general administration (Rs. 56,000), chief's establishment (Rs. 53,000), and public works (Rs. 1,10,000). The State pays no tribute to any Darb\u0101r and receives no allowances, but it contributes Rs. 3,389 yearly towards the up-keep of the M\u0101lw\u0101 Bhil Corps. The British rupee has been legal tender since 1892. The sale of g\u0101nja, bhang, and opium is controlled by the State. In the hills an excise rate of Rs. 2\u20138\u20130 is levied from each Bhil village through the headmen, the Bhils being then allowed to prepare their own liquor. A Central jail is maintained at Barw\u0101n\u012b, and a regular civil police force has been established. The first school in the State was opened in 1863. In 1898 the Victoria High School was affiliated to the Calcutta University. There are now 19 schools with 1,000 pupils. In 1901, 3 per cent. of the population (almost entirely males) could read and write. Six dispensaries have been opened in the State.\nBarw\u0101n\u012b Town.\u2014Capital of the State of the same name, in Central India, situated in $22^\\circ 2' N.$ and $74^\\circ 54' E.$, 3 miles from the left bank of the Narbad\u0101, and 80 miles from Mhow on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 6,277. The town is believed to have been founded in about 1650 by R\u0101n\u0101 Chandra Singh. Five miles from the town is B\u0101wangaja$^1$ ('52 yards') hill, a place of considerable sanctity among the Jains. Its name is derived from the popular idea of the height of the gigantic figure of the Jain teacher Gomatesvara, cut in the face of the hill about three-quarters of the way up the slope. On the summit is a small temple constructed from the remains of an older building, which contains two inscriptions dated 1166 and 1459. Large numbers of Jain pilgrims visit the place on the full moon of the month of Pausha (January). At the foot of the hill stand some modern Jain temples, which are examples of the degraded style of Hindu architecture followed in so many modern structures. A State guest-house, a hospital, British post and telegraph offices, a jail, and a school are situated in the town.\n\nBarw\u0101 S\u0101gar.\u2014Town in the District and tahsil of Jh\u0101nsi, United Provinces, situated in $25^\\circ 22' N.$ and $78^\\circ 44' E.$, on a branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1901), 6,355. The town stands near a fine lake formed by damming the Barw\u0101, an affluent of the Betw\u0101. The lake is used for irrigation, and the embankment and channels are in the charge of the Public Works department. Northwest of it stands a castle said to have been built by Udit Singh, R\u0101j\u0101 of Orchh\u0101. The neighbourhood is rich in antiquarian remains dating from the Chandel period or even earlier. Barw\u0101 S\u0101gar contains a school with 75 pupils. It is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 700. Ginger and vegetables are largely grown in the neighbourhood, and there is a flourishing local trade.\n\nBasantia.\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Jessore District, Bengal, situated in $23^\\circ 8' N.$ and $89^\\circ 22' E.$, on the Bhairab, 12 miles east of Jessore town. Population (1901), 1,420. It has a considerable trade in sugar and rice. Being the nearest point to Jessore to which boats of a large size can come, it may be said to serve as a port to that town; there is also a large country traffic by road between Basantia and Jessore.\n\nBasantpur.\u2014Headquarters of the Ar\u0101ri\u0101 subdivision of Purnea District, Bengal, situated in $26^\\circ 18' N.$ and $87^\\circ 33' E.$, on the right bank of the Pan\u0101r river. Population (1901), 2,792. Basantpur is 4 miles west of Ar\u0101ri\u0101 village, which gives its name to the subdivision, and it contains the usual subdivisional offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 17 prisoners.\n\n$^1$ Dr. Impey, *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Bombay Branch*, vol. xviii, p. 918.\nBas\u0101rh.\u2014Village in the H\u0101jipur subdivision of Muzaffarpur District, Bengal, situated in $25^\\circ 59' \\text{ N.}$ and $85^\\circ 8' \\text{ E.}$. Population (1901), 3,527. Bas\u0101rh is identified with the capital of the ancient kingdom of Vais\u0101li. In the sixth century B.C. a confederacy of the Lichchavis was predominant here, and was able to prevent the kingdom of Magadha from expanding on the north bank of the Ganges. Vais\u0101li was a great stronghold of Buddhism, and Gautama visited it three times during his life. Here was held the second Buddhist council which had so great an effect in splitting up the Buddhists into the Northern and Southern sects. The town was visited by Fa Hian and Hiuen Tsiang; the latter found it in ruins. The principal antiquarian feature of the place is a large brick-covered mound, measuring 1,580 feet by 750 and representing the remains of a vast fort or palace. In the neighbourhood is a huge stone pillar surmounted with the figure of a lion. This monolith, though locally known as Bhim Singh's l\u0101th, appears clearly to be one of the pillars erected by Asoka to mark the stages of the journey to Nep\u0101l which he undertook in order to visit some of the holy sites of Buddhism. It bears no inscription, but can be identified with one of the Asoka pillars mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang at the site of ancient Vais\u0101li.\n\n[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xvi, pp. 89\u201393; and Reports of the Archaeological Surveyor, Bengal Circle, for 1901\u20132 and 1903\u20134.]\n\nBasav\u0101patna.\u2014Deserted town in the Channagiri taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in $14^\\circ 12' \\text{ N.}$ and $75^\\circ 49' \\text{ E.}$, 16 miles from Channagiri town. It lies in a narrow valley enclosed by hills, and was the original seat of the chiefs who, when Basav\u0101patna was taken by the Bij\u0101pur army in the invasion of 1637, retired to Tarikere, and are commonly identified with the former place. It was the seat of government for this part of the country under Bij\u0101pur rule, and under the Mughals afterwards. Later it changed hands several times, and was held by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s for seven years. Haidar Ali dismantled the fort in 1763, and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s under Parasur\u0101m Bha\u03bf sacked the town in 1791. The fort was repaired in 1799, but the place never recovered its former prosperity. Near the fort was a mosque where B\u0101b\u0101 Budan lived before he settled on the mountain called after him.\n\nBashahr.\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 6'$ and $32^\\circ 5' \\text{ N.}$ and $77^\\circ 32'$ and $79^\\circ 4' \\text{ E.}$, with an area of 3,820 square miles. Population (1901), 80,582. Number of villages, 70. Between 1803 and 1815 Bashahr was held in subjection by the conquering Gurkhas. On the overthrow of the Gurkha power in 1815, the British Government confirmed the R\u0101j\u0101 of Bashahr, by a sanad, in possession of all his territories, subject to the payment of a tribute of Rs. 22,500. In 1847 the tribute was reduced to Rs. 5,910, as compensation for the abolition of transit duties. The present R\u0101j\u0101, Sham-\nsher Singh, who is a Rajput, tracing back his descent for 120 generations, succeeded in 1850. He is of weak intellect, and, since the death of his only son in 1898, the State has been managed by an official deputed by Government. The Raj\u0101 is required to furnish troops in aid of the British Government in time of war, and labour for the construction of roads in the Bashahr territory. The revenue of the State is about Rs. 85,000, the chief sources being land and forests. The forests are leased to the British Government for Rs. 10,000 per annum.\n\nBasi.\u2014Head-quarters of the Basi tahsil of the Kalsia State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 35' N. and 76\u00b0 54' E. Population (1901), 4,641. The income of the municipality, wholly derived from octroi, was Rs. 2,604 in 1903-4; and the expenditure was only Rs. 158. The town has a vernacular middle school and a dispensary.\n\nBasi.\u2014Head-quarters of the Amargarh niz\u0101mat, Patiala State, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 42' N. and 76\u00b0 28' E., 6 miles north of Sirhind. Population (1901), 13,738. Known in Mughal times as Basti Malik Haidar, the capital of the niz\u0101mat was established here, as Sirhind itself was held accursed by the Sikhs. It is a flourishing mart for agricultural produce, and has a considerable manufacture of cotton cloth. It is said to export Rs. 10,000 worth of pepper annually. The town is now connected with the North-Western Railway at Sirhind by a mono-rail tramway, 5 miles in length, which was opened in February, 1907. The town has a vernacular middle school and a police station.\n\nB\u0101sim District (or Washim in Mar\u0101th\u012b).\u2014District in Ber\u0101r, lying between 19\u00b0 25' and 20\u00b0 28' N. and 76\u00b0 40' and 78\u00b0 14' E., with an area of 2,949 square miles. In 1905 this District ceased to exist, its component taluks being divided between Akola and Yeotmal. It was bounded on the north by Akola and Amraoti Districts; on the east by W\u016bn District; on the south by the Pengang\u0101 river and the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State; and on the west by Buld\u0101na District.\n\nThe District is situated in the Bal\u0101gh\u0101t of Ber\u0101r, the table-land on the south of the P\u016brna valley. The B\u0101sim taluk, the most westerly, consists of a rich table-land of the average height of about 1,000 feet above sea-level, sloping down towards the west and south to the fertile valley of the Pengang\u0101. The other two taluks, Mangr\u016bl and Pusad, are mainly a succession of low hills covered with poor grass, the formation being trap. The soil of the hollows between the hills is usually of the best quality. Many of the hill peaks rise to a height of 2,000 feet, and along the ranges of the Pusad taluk stretch wide slopes of woodland, containing some teak. The scenery of the more hilly portions of the District is fine, especially in the rains and the early part of the cold season, when the hills are still covered with vegetation and the grass has not been burnt yellow by the sun.\nThe principal river is the Pengang\u0101, which, except in one corner of the B\u0101sim t\u0101luk, forms the boundary between the District and the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions. Entering the District near W\u0101kad on the west, it flows in a south-easterly direction as far as the south-eastern corner of the Pusad t\u0101luk. It then takes a sharp turn and flows in a north-westerly direction, resuming its original course, after another sudden bend, close to M\u0101h\u016br in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions. The P\u016bs is the principal affluent of the Pengang\u0101 in the District. It rises near B\u0101sim town and flows in a south-easterly direction through the Pusad t\u0101luk, joining the Pengang\u0101 at Sangam, after a course of 64 miles. The K\u0101ta P\u016brna runs from its source nearly due north until it reaches the slopes of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, where it inclines eastward, entering Akola District near Mah\u0101n. Other insignificant streams are the Ar\u0101n, K\u016bch, Adol, and Chandrabh\u0101ga, all tributaries of the Pengang\u0101.\n\nThe whole District, like the greater part of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, is covered with flows of Deccan trap, which were erupted at about the end of the Cretaceous times, the volcanic activity lasting, probably, till the beginning of the Tertiary period. The trap is covered, on the B\u0101sim plateau and also in the valleys, with black loam. Iron ore is found in the high lands, but probably not in workable quantities.\n\nThe commonest trees in cultivated lands are the bab\u016bl, the pipal, the mango, the tamarind, and the mahu\u0101. Forests will be noticed separately. The weed vegetation is that chiefly characteristic of the Deccan, including many small Compositae and Leguminosae.\n\nTigers, leopards, bears, wild hog, antelope, nilgai, spotted deer, and chink\u0101ra are fairly common; and the wild dog (Cyon dakhunensis), the jackal, the wolf, and the hunting leopard (Cynaelurus jubatus) are also found in the District.\n\nThe hot season is less severe than in the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t. The highest and lowest readings of the thermometer in May, July, and December, 1901, a normal year, were 114\u00b0 and 84\u00b0, 86\u00b0 and 76\u00b0, and 77\u00b0 and 68\u00b0. The climate is fairly uniform, but slightly higher temperatures are experienced in the river valleys. The hot season is intensely dry, and therefore healthy; the weather in the rains is usually cool and pleasant, and the cold season is temperate and healthy.\n\nThe rainfall, which is uniform throughout the District, exceeds the rainfall in the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t. In 1901, a normal year, nearly 41 inches were registered. The Pengang\u0101 sometimes rises, but no serious damage has ever been done by such floods; and the District has been fortunate in escaping serious natural calamities other than famine.\n\nB\u0101sim never existed as a separate political entity, and its history is chiefly bound up with that of the Province of which it has always formed part. In the days of the Mughal empire B\u0101sim was the head-quarters of a sark\u0101r, or revenue district, which extended on\nboth sides of the Pengang\u0101, and the Ain-i-Akbari makes mention of the Hatgars or Bargi Dhangars ('shepherd spearmen') inhabiting the hill north of the Pengang\u0101. They were proud and refractory, and possessed a force of 1,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry. These highland chiefs owned little more than nominal allegiance to the lowland rulers, whether Hindu or Musalm\u0101n, and thus they continued until the establishment of British rule. In 1671 the District was plundered by Prat\u0101p Rao, one of Sivaji's generals. In 1795, after the battle of Kardla, the pargana of Umarkhed, with other territory elsewhere, was ceded by the Niz\u0101m to the Peshw\u0101; and in 1818 B\u0101ji Rao Peshw\u0101, after the rout of Siwni, fled through Umarkhed before Sir John Doveton, whom he contrived to elude. In 1819 the Hatgar Naiks of the District broke the peace, and Naosaji Naik Muski gave battle to the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent troops under Major Pitman at Umarkhed. He was driven into his stronghold of Nowah, which was gallantly carried by assault, and the Naik was sent to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, where he died. After the Peshw\u0101's downfall the Umarkhed pargana was transferred by the East India Company to the Niz\u0101m. In 1858 a gang of plundering Rohillas were pursued by a detachment of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent into the village of Chichamb\u0101, near Risod, where, behind walls, they resisted an assault by the fatigued troops, in which Captain Mackinnon was killed.\n\nOn the Assignment, in 1853, when Ber\u0101r was divided into two Districts, B\u0101sim was included in West Ber\u0101r, and soon afterwards became the head-quarters of a subdivision. In 1868 the subdivisional officer was made independent of the Deputy-Commissioner at Akola, and in 1875 the subdivision was formed into a District under the charge of a Deputy-Commissioner.\n\nThe temple of Antariksha P\u0101rvan\u0101tha at Sirpur, in the B\u0101sim taluk, belonging to the Digambara Jain community, is the most interesting monument of the past in the District. An old tank at B\u0101sim is known as the Padma T\u012brtha, but the date of its construction cannot be ascertained. Pusad has two very fine Hem\u0101dpanti temples.\n\nThe number of towns and villages in the District in 1901 was 827. The population rose between 1867 and 1891, and then declined. The number at the four enumerations was as follows:\n\n(1867) 276,646, (1881) 358,883, (1891) 398,181, and (1901) 353,410. There has thus been a net increase of 76,764 since 1867. The great decrease during the last decade was due to the scarcity of 1896\u20137, the famine of 1899\u20131900, and mortality from epidemic disease. The District included the three taluks of B\u0101sim, Mangr\u016bl, and Pusad, named from the towns at which their headquarters are situated. It contained three towns: B\u0101sim, Pusad, and Mangr\u016bl.\nThe following table gives particulars of area, towns and villages, and population in 1901:\n\n| Taluk | Area in square miles | Number of | Population per square mile | Percentage of population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| B\u0101sim | 1,046                | 1         | 324                       | 153,320                                       | 147                                      | -13.5                                    | 4,193                                     |\n| Mangrol | 630                  | 1         | 202                       | 91,062                                        | 144                                      | +10.4                                    | 1,767                                     |\n| Pusad | 1,273                | 1         | 298                       | 109,028                                       | 86                                       | -21.6                                    | 2,816                                     |\n| District total | 2,949 | 3         | 824                       | 353,410                                       | 120                                      | -11.2                                    | 8,776                                     |\n\nB\u0101sim stood fourth among the Districts of Ber\u0101r as regards the density of its population (120 persons per square mile). More than 92 per cent. of the people are Hindus. The language usually spoken is Mar\u0101th\u012b, but the Musalm\u0101ns use a corrupt dialect of Urd\u016b, which is generally understood by all.\n\nIn B\u0101sim, as in all other Districts of Ber\u0101r, the Kunb\u012bs (110,000) are more numerous than any other caste; the Mah\u0101rs (50,700) come second, the Musalm\u0101ns (22,800) third, and the Banj\u0101r\u0101s (21,400) fourth, being more numerous than in any other District in the Province, except W\u016bn. Dhangars number 14,600, M\u0101lis 12,500, Br\u0101hmans only 7,700, and Telis 7,600. The Hatgars, specially mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as an important tribe in the sark\u0101r of B\u0101sim, now number only 577, and are, strangely enough, less numerous here than in any District in Ber\u0101r, except Amraoti and Ellichpur. The Banj\u0101r\u0101s in the sark\u0101r of B\u0101sim are mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as being under the headship of a woman; and it is known, from the change of surname among the local Naiks, who have their head-quarters at Narsi, in the Parbhani District of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, that the office has descended at least once in the female line. The figures for castes, given above, clearly indicate the principal occupation of the people. The District is essentially an agricultural one, over 76 per cent. of its population living by the land. The percentage of the industrial population is 11.\n\nThere is only one Christian mission, which is supported by the American Episcopal Methodist body, and has its head-quarters at B\u0101sim. Of 229 Christians enumerated in the District in 1901, 212 were natives.\n\nThe B\u0101sim taluk is a rich table-land, the trap flows being here covered with a layer of black cotton soil of varying but nearly always sufficient depth. This layer is deeper in the valley of the Pengang\u0101 than elsewhere, the conditions of this area being not dissimilar from those of the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t. The surface of\nthe Mangril t\u0101luk is more broken, but here too the soil is rich and of good quality, except on the hills. Pusad consists principally of a succession of low waste hills, the soil of which is often too poor to support anything but grass of an inferior quality; but in the hollows between the hills, and in the Pengang\u0101 valley, which is, however, very narrow here, the soil is rich and fertile. Cultivation depends almost entirely upon the south-west monsoon.\n\nAlmost the whole area is held ryotw\u0101ri; ij\u0101ra, j\u0101gir, and p\u0101lumpat villages cover only 33 square miles. The principal statistics relating to the land in 1903-4 are given below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forest |\n|-------|------------|-----------|------------------|--------|\n| 2,959 | 2,937      | 6         | 32               | 721    |\n\nThe staple food-grain is great millet (jow\u0101r), the area under which in 1903-4 was 822 square miles. Cotton, the most profitable crop, occupied 532 square miles, and the other important crops are wheat and oilseeds, which occupied 108 and 59 square miles.\n\nAfter the Assignment, when the people began to return to the land, the rich soil of the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t was the first to be taken up, and the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t remained comparatively neglected till later. In order to encourage cultivation in B\u0101sim District, it was considered desirable to lease entire villages on special terms to lessees who would be likely to repay themselves by importing sub-tenants, or, failing these, field labourers. Of these leased villages, forty-eight still remain. The measure undoubtedly gave an impetus to cultivation, but it may be doubted whether the wiser course would not have been to await patiently the extension, which was certain to come in time, of ryotw\u0101ri cultivation. For the last fifteen years the extension of the cultivated area has been steady and continuous. In agricultural practice there has, however, been no marked improvement. On the contrary, the cultivator here, as elsewhere in Ber\u0101r, has abandoned the cultivation of the fine quality of cotton for which the Province was formerly famous, in favour of a coarser but more prolific variety. The ryots have not in the past availed themselves freely of the Loans Acts; but the famine of 1899-1900 brought the advantages offered under these Acts into prominent notice, and loans were freely applied for and taken. During the prosperous years which ensued there have naturally been fewer applications for loans, but the solvent and thrifty cultivator has doubtless learnt that it is the Government, rather than the money-lender, who is his friend in need.\n\nThe principal breed of cattle is the Umarda, or smaller variety of the Ber\u0101ri breed; but the character of the cattle in the District has been\nmodified in the past by an admixture of the types found in the northern tracts of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, and more lately, since recent years of scarcity and famine, by the importation of cattle of the Nim\u0101r\u012b, Shol\u0101puri, and Labb\u0101n\u012b breeds. Buffaloes are chiefly of the Dakhani breed. The local breeds of ponies, sheep, and goats are inferior, and the breeders have neither the knowledge nor the means necessary to their improvement.\n\nOnly 6 square miles of the cultivated land were irrigated in 1903-4, consisting almost entirely of garden crops, watered from wells.\n\nOf the forest land, 266 square miles are reserved for the production of timber and fuel, 19 square miles are ramma land, and 436 square miles are grazing land. The forests producing timber are situated on the northern slopes of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, in the B\u0101sim t\u0101luk, on the hills north of the P\u016bs river between the Mangr\u016bl and Pusad t\u0101luk, on the hills forming the watershed between the P\u016bs and Pengang\u0101 rivers, and in the south-eastern corner of the Pusad t\u0101luk in the loop of the Pengang\u0101. All these forests contain teak, which varies in size and quality in different localities, the best being found in the Kinwat Reserve in the loop of the Pengang\u0101. Tiwas (Ougeinia dalbergioides) is also common in this Reserve, but rarer elsewhere. Ain (Terminalia tomentosa), dhaura (Anogeissus latifolia), lendia (Lagerstroemia parviflora), and dh\u0101man (Grewia tiliaefolia) are also common and useful trees. The following trees are common in both forest and cultivated land: bab\u016bl (Acacia arabica), hiwar (Acacia leucophloea), mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia), gular (Ficus glomerata), chinch or imli (Tamarindus indica), and ber (Zizyphus Jujuba). The mango is cultivated, but does not grow wild in the forests; bamboos are rare, and, where found, inferior.\n\nThe iron ore found in the Pusad hills, which has already been mentioned, seems to be the only mineral product of the District, and it is very doubtful whether it is of economic value.\n\nThere are no important manufactures. The principal industry is the preparation of cotton for the market. The District contained 16 ginning factories and 2 cotton-presses, all worked by steam.\n\nThe chief export is cotton, which is sent by road to Akola and thence by rail to Bombay. Some of the cotton from the south of the Pusad t\u0101luk finds its way to the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway. Oilseeds and grain and pulse are also exported. The principal imports are grain and pulse, sugar, salt, and oils, which come chiefly from Akola, having been brought thither by rail. Most of the internal trade is effected through the agency of the weekly markets at pargana towns. B\u0101sim has a cotton market. The traders are chiefly M\u0101rw\u0101ris and Komatis.\nThere is no railway in the District; but a project to connect the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d-God\u0101vari Valley Railway with Khandw\u0101, by means of a line which will run through B\u0101sim and Akola, is under consideration.\n\nThe total length of metalled roads is 62 miles, and of unmetalled roads 110 miles. All these, except 5 miles of the former and 27 of the latter which are maintained from Local funds, are in charge of the Public Works department. The principal road passing through the District is the Akola-Hingol\u012b road, which passes through Meds\u012b and B\u0101sim town, and is the highway from the latter place to the railway. The roads to Pusad and Umarkhed are metalled for a short distance only.\n\nAs regards liability to famine, the District cannot be differentiated from the rest of Ber\u0101r. The crops depend upon the south-west monsoon, the failure of which is not often so extensive as to cause severe distress. In 1896\u20137 the District suffered from scarcity owing to a partial failure of the rainfall, and in 1899\u20131900 the famine which was felt throughout Ber\u0101r afflicted B\u0101sim severely. The difficulty of coping with this calamity was increased by the immigration of large numbers from the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, where relief measures were less perfect than in Ber\u0101r. In May, 1900, when the distress was at its height, 103,215 persons were on relief works and 36,350 in receipt of gratuitous relief; and it is calculated that 24,000 cattle died.\n\nThe three taluks, at the head-quarters of each of which there is a tahsild\u0101r, have already been mentioned. The superior staff of the District consists of the usual officers.\n\nThe arrangements for the administration of justice are described in the article on Akola District. Dacoities, cattle-thefts, and house-breakings fluctuate in numbers, as elsewhere, with the state of the season, but are somewhat more numerous than in the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, owing to the large number of Banj\u0101ras in the District. These, however, are gradually being weaned from their criminal propensities. Murders, which are not common, are usually due to personal motives.\n\nAccording to the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b, the land revenue demand in the parganas composing B\u0101sim District was 6-8 lakhs, a sum which but slightly falls short of the land revenue demand in the same area in 1903\u20134, which was 8 lakhs. The extent to which B\u0101sim, in common with the rest of Ber\u0101r, suffered from the wars, maladministration, and natural calamities of the latter part of the seventeenth, the eighteenth, and the early part of the nineteenth centuries is illustrated by the striking fall in the land revenue demand, which in 1853, at the time of the Assignment, was returned by the Niz\u0101m\u2019s officers\u2014who had certainly no reason for understating it\u2014at 2-4 lakhs. Considering the extension of cultivation, and the rise in the price of produce since\nAkbar's time, it is evident that the present assessment, though absolutely somewhat higher than Akbar's, is relatively very much lighter.\n\nThe first regular settlement of the District after the Assignment was made between 1872 and 1875, and is now expiring; but in those tracts where it has already expired the introduction of the new rates, assessed in 1899, has been postponed, owing to the extent to which the District suffered from the famine of 1899-1900. Under the new assessment the maximum rate is Rs. 1\u201412 per acre, the minimum 7 annas, and the average 12 annas 4 pies. Land irrigated from streams is assessed at a special land and water rate of Rs. 8 per acre, except in the Pusad taluk, where, for the purpose of encouraging irrigation, it is assessed either as 'dry' land or as land irrigated from wells. Land irrigated from wells is assessed at the maximum rate for 'dry' land in the village in which it is situated where the wells have been sunk before the original survey; but land irrigated from wells sunk since that time is treated as 'dry' land. The average increase of the new rates over the old amounts to 32\u00b72 per cent. throughout the District, but in areas in which the increase is greater than 33 per cent. the enhanced rates are to be gradually introduced.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 5.90   | 6.02   | 6.23   | 7.15   |\n| Total revenue  | 7.23   | 8.63   | 15.68  | 9.18   |\n\nB\u0101sim town is administered by a municipality, and local affairs in the rest of the District were under the District board, with the three taluk boards subordinate to it. The expenditure of the District board in 1903-4 was Rs. 65,000, of which Rs. 25,000 was laid out on public works and Rs. 10,000 on education. The principal sources of income were Provincial rates, assessed taxes, and the Provincial contribution for primary education.\n\nThe District had 20 police stations, 4 outposts, and 3 road-posts, and the force under the District Superintendent of police numbered 413 of all ranks. The District jail at B\u0101sim was the only jail, and contained in 1904 a daily average of 44 inmates.\n\nB\u0101sim stood fifth among the six Districts of Ber\u0101r in the literacy of its population, of whom 3\u00b71 per cent. (6\u00b70 males and 0\u00b72 females) were able to read and write in 1901. Education is most advanced in the B\u0101sim taluk. In 1903-4 the District contained 73 public, 19 aided, and 30 unaided schools with a total of 4,881 pupils, of whom 4,083 were in public schools and 370 were girls. Of the\n74 primary schools, 69 were managed by the District board and 5 by the B\u0101sim municipality. The great majority of those under instruction were in primary classes, and no girls had advanced beyond this stage. Of the male population of school-going age, 6 per cent. were in the primary stage of instruction, and of the female population of the same age, 0.5 per cent. In recent years the experiment of combining elementary instruction in such handicrafts as cane-work and carpentry with the ordinary school course has been tried, but it is too soon to pronounce definitely on its success. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was Rs. 34,100, of which Rs. 29,000 was contributed by local bodies and Rs. 2,565 was realized from fees.\n\nThe District possessed one civil hospital and five dispensaries, with accommodation for 27 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 36,467, of whom 252 were in-patients, and 940 operations were performed. The expenditure was Rs. 7,365, of which the greater part was met from Provincial contributions.\n\nVaccination has made satisfactory progress in the District. In 1903-4 the proportion of persons successfully vaccinated was 33.7 per 1,000, the mean for the Province being 36.6. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipal town of B\u0101sim.\n\nOn the reconstitution of the six Districts of Ber\u0101r in August 1905, B\u0101sim ceased to exist as a separate District. The t\u0101luk of B\u0101sim and Mangr\u016bl were transferred to Akola and now form the B\u0101sim subdivision of that District, and the t\u0101luk of Pusad was transferred to W\u0101n, now designated Yeotm\u0101l District.\n\n**B\u0101sim Subdivision.**\u2014Subdivision of Akola District, Ber\u0101r, consisting of the B\u0101sim and Mangr\u016bl t\u0101luk.\n\n**B\u0101sim T\u0101luk.**\u2014Formerly the head-quarters t\u0101luk of B\u0101sim District, but since August, 1905, the southern t\u0101luk of Akola District, Ber\u0101r, lying between 19\u00b0 52' and 20\u00b0 25' N. and 75\u00b0 40' and 77\u00b0 28' E., with an area of 1,046 square miles. The population fell from 177,250 in 1891 to 153,320 in 1901, and its density, 147 persons per square mile, is less than in any other t\u0101luk except Mangr\u016bl. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,76,000, and for cesses Rs. 30,000. The t\u0101luk contains 324 villages and only one town, B\u0101sim (population, 13,823), the head-quarters of the t\u0101luk and of the B\u0101sim subdivision. The northern part of the t\u0101luk lies in the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, or southern plateau of Ber\u0101r, but the southern portion lies in the valley of the Pengang\u0101, which forms the southern boundary from P\u0101rd\u012b eastwards. The soil is fertile, especially in the Pengang\u0101 valley.\n\n**B\u0101sim Town** (or W\u0101shim).\u2014Head-quarters of the B\u0101sim t\u0101luk, Akola District, Ber\u0101r, situated in 20\u00b0 7' N. and 77\u00b0 11' E., at a height of 1,758 feet above sea-level; distant 52 miles south-south-east from Akola on the N\u0101gpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway,\nwith which it is connected by a good metalled road. Population (1901), 13,823. B\u0101sim is said to be a very old town, and to have been founded by Wachh, a Rishi. A legend tells of a king, V\u0101suki, afflicted with leprosy, who was cured by bathing in a pool outside the town, which he enlarged to a tank, known as Padma Tirtha, still largely resorted to for bathing. It is also said to petrify articles exposed to its action. The deshmukhs of B\u0101sim in the seventeenth century received large grants of land and perquisites from the Mughal emperors, and the family has always been of some consideration in South Ber\u0101r. After the Bhonsla ruler of N\u0101gpur ceased to receive a share (40 per cent.) of the revenue, the Niz\u0101m stationed troops and established a mint at B\u0101sim. The most striking buildings are the temple and tank of B\u0101l\u0101ji, constructed rather more than a hundred years ago by Bhaw\u0101ni K\u0101lu, a general of the Bhonslas. The municipality was created in 1867. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 13,400 and Rs. 12,700. In 1903-4 the receipts were Rs. 18,000, principally from taxes, the expenditure, mainly devoted to education and conservancy, being nearly the same. The town contains several ginning factories and a cotton-press. It was the head-quarters of B\u0101sim District till 1905, when that District ceased to exist as a separate administrative unit.\n\n**Basirh\u0101t Subdivision.**\u2014North-eastern subdivision of the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 31' and 22\u00b0 55' N. and 88\u00b0 33' and 89\u00b0 6' E., with an area of 1,922 square miles, of which 1,584 are included in the Sundarbans. The northern part of the subdivision consists of a fertile alluvial tract; but to the south, where the delta is in a less advanced stage of growth, there is a network of tidal creeks winding through numerous islands and morasses. The population in 1901 was 372,187, compared with 347,138 in 1891, the density being 194 persons per square mile. It contains three towns, Basirh\u0101t (population, 17,001), its head-quarters, B\u0101dur\u012b\u0101 (12,921) and T\u0101ki (5,089); and 920 villages.\n\n**Basirh\u0101t Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in the District of the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal, situated in 22\u00b0 40' N. and 88\u00b0 51' E., on the right bank of the Jamun\u0101 river. Population (1901), 17,001. Basirh\u0101t was constituted a municipality in 1869. The income and expenditure during the decade ending 1901-2 averaged Rs. 6,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 6,600, mainly from a tax on persons; and the expenditure was Rs. 6,300. Basirh\u0101t contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 12 prisoners. Basirh\u0101t is connected with B\u0101rasat, a station on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, by a metalled road 26 miles in length, along which a light railway with eight stations has recently been laid.\nBasmat Taluk.\u2014Eastern taluk of Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, with an area of 610 square miles. Including j\u0101girs, the population in 1901 was 79,569, compared with 117,344 in 1891, the decrease being due to the famine of 1900. The taluk contains one town, Basmat (population, 8,445), the head-quarters; and 215 villages, of which 21 are j\u0101gir. The land revenue in 1901 was 3.2 lakhs. The country is composed mainly of black cotton soil.\n\nBasmat Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the taluk of the same name in Parbhani District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, situated in 19\u00b0 20' N. and 77\u00b0 10' E. Population (1901), 8,445. Besides the tahsil and police inspector's offices, it contains three schools and a post office. Basmat is a busy centre of the grain trade.\n\nB\u0101soda (Naw\u0101b-B\u0101soda, Haidargarh-B\u0101soda).\u2014A mediatised chiefship in Central India, under the Bhop\u0101l Agency, situated on the M\u0101lw\u0101 plateau, with an area of about 40 square miles, and a population (1901) of 4,987. The town from which the State takes its name was founded by R\u0101j\u0101 Bir Singh Deo of Orchh\u0101 in the seventeenth century. It is often styled Muhammadgarh-B\u0101soda and Haidargarh-B\u0101soda, to distinguish it from the place of the same name in Gwalior State, but is generally called Naw\u0101b-B\u0101soda. The State is bounded on the west by the Sironj district of Tonk State, and a portion of Gwalior; on the north by the Saugor District of the Central Provinces, and the States of Path\u0101r\u012b, Korwai, and Muhammadgarh; on the east by Saugor District and Bhop\u0101l; and on the south by Bhop\u0101l.\n\nThe Naw\u0101bs of B\u0101soda belong to the Korwai family founded by Muhammad Diler Kh\u0101n, an Afgh\u0101n of the B\u0101rakzai Firoz Khel, in the eighteenth century. On his death the State was divided between his two sons, Korwai falling to the elder. The younger, Ahs\u0101n-ullah Kh\u0101n, settled at first at R\u0101kha and Bah\u0101durgarh, now Is\u0101garh in the Gwalior State, but being hard pressed by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, moved his capital to B\u0101soda in 1753. In 1817 the State fell into the hands of Sindhia, but was restored in 1822 on the mediation of the British authorities. The chief, though nominally subordinate to Sindhia, pays him no tribute, and in his relations with that Darb\u0101r receives the countenance and support of the Political Agent, who since 1822 has exercised the same general authority in this chiefship as in the guaranteed chiefships subject to his control.\n\nAhs\u0101n-ullah died in 1786, having alienated part of his possessions to form the State of Muhammadgarh. He was followed by Naw\u0101b Bak\u0101-ullah Kh\u0101n and Asad Ali Kh\u0101n, the last being at one time minister of the Bhop\u0101l State, from which he was, however, removed for intriguing with the pretender Dastg\u012br. The present chief is Haidar Ali Kh\u0101n, who succeeded in 1897, and bears the title of Naw\u0101b. The State contains twenty-three villages, and is fertile and produces good crops.\nAbout 10 square miles, or 25 per cent. of the total area, are cultivated, 126 acres being irrigated. The chief exercises the criminal powers of a first-class magistrate, all heinous crimes being dealt with by the Political Agent. The normal revenue of the State is Rs. 19,000, of which Rs. 16,000 is derived from land. The incidence of the land revenue demand is Rs. 2\u20139\u20133 per acre of cultivated area. B\u0101soda, the chief town, is situated in $23^\\circ 51' N.$ and $77^\\circ 56' E.$ Population (1901), 1,850. It contains a British post office, a jail, a school, and a dispensary.\n\n**Basr\u016br** (the Barcelore or Barkalur of early geographers).\u2014Village in the Coondapoor t\u0101luk of South Kanara District, Madras, situated in $13^\\circ 38' N.$ and $74^\\circ 45' E.$, 4 miles east of Coondapoor. It was once a large walled town with a fort and a temple, and carried on an important trade with Malabar and the Persian Gulf; but its decline set in after the establishment of the Portuguese at Coondapoor in the eighteenth century, and it is now an insignificant place. The ruins of Sir Thomas Munro's courthouse are still pointed out. As Major Munro he was the first Collector of the District. Population (1901), 1,757.\n\n**Bassein District.**\u2014District of the Irrawaddy Division, Lower Burma, lying between $15^\\circ 50'$ and $17^\\circ 30' N.$ and $94^\\circ 11'$ and $95^\\circ 28' E.$, with an area of 4,127 square miles. It forms an irregular wedge-shaped strip of coast land and delta country, narrowing from north to south, in the extreme south-west corner of the Province. It is bounded on the north by Henzada and Sandoway Districts; on the east by Ma-ubin and Myaungmya; and on the south and west by the Bay of Bengal, which curves round its southern and western edges at the elbow formed by Pagoda Point. The District is divided into unequal parts by the Arakan Yoma, which enters Bassein at its north-western corner, and runs down its western side at no great distance from the sea. The main portion lies to the east of this range, consisting of a flat alluvial plain, the northern end of which is rich rice land. Farther south, between the Ngawun and Dag\u0101 rivers, it is flooded and poor. To the east of the Dag\u0101 and southwards towards Bassein town the land is slightly higher and more fertile. To the west of the Ngawun, as far as the bifurcation of the Dag\u0101, the land is flooded and generally uncultivable. Below that point it is higher and of fair quality, while south of the town of Bassein it is typically deltaic, intersected by innumerable tidal creeks, marshy, and covered with mangrove jungle, with some stretches of rice land here and there. In the south the coast-line consists for the most part of a gently shelving sandy beach, backed by swampy forest land; in the west beyond Pagoda Point, where the hills enter the sea abruptly, the coast is rocky and difficult of approach. With the exception of the Arakan Yoma, which here is comparatively low, there is no high land\nin the District. The whole face of the country is intersected by tidal channels, but they are for the most part unimportant waterways. The principal river is the Ngawun (or Bassein), which, leaving the Irrawaddy a short distance above Henzada, pursues a course almost due south through the whole length of the District, till it falls into the sea at Hainggyi. Its chief tributaries are the Dag\u0101, joining it about 14 miles north of Bassein, and the Panmawadi, whose waters fall into it some 28 miles south of that town. The Bassein river has two mouths, but the eastern branch is silted up with sand and is useless for navigation. The western or main branch, on the other hand, is easily navigable by ocean-going vessels of a draught up to 27 feet, and is the main waterway to the town of Bassein.\n\nNumerous stretches of water are found in the District; but the one real lake, called the Inye, has a circumference of 7 miles, and averages 15 feet in depth in the dry season. It is situated in the Kyonpyaw township, about 4 miles from Kyonpyaw in the north-east of the District. Islands are plentiful in the lower reaches of the Bassein river; but the only two deserving of special mention are Ha'nggyi or Negrais, near Pagoda Point, where the first British trading settlement in Burma was started, and Diamond Island, called by the Burmans Thamihla ('beautiful daughter'), a low wooded islet about a square mile in area at the very mouth of the river.\n\nThe soil of a portion of the northern part consists of the usual agglomeration of clay and silt deposit common to alluvial rice-growing plains. North of Bassein town and east of Ngaputaw considerable beds of laterite are met with, covered in places with sandy deposits. On the west coast a remarkable patch of calcareous sandstone occurs. The Nummulitic or eocene group of rocks is well developed; in the Yoma and in the south these have been termed the Negrais beds. Subordinate to the sandstone an irregular bed of conglomerate occurs, which is, however, marked only near Ywatpa, where there is a so-called mud volcano. This is really only a small vent discharging marsh-gas, connected geologically, no doubt, with the mud volcanoes of Arakan. In the south, at Tonbo and Kyankthinhaw, limestone of the very best quality is found. The supply is practically inexhaustible, the locality is convenient for working, and in consequence this area has been largely drawn on by the railway for ballasting the lately completed line from Rangoon to Bassein. Soapstone in small quantities is found in the Arakan Yoma, chiefly on the western slopes.\n\nThe botany of Bassein is similar to that of Hanthawaddy District. Large areas of mangrove swamp are found near the rivers, and inland are evergreen tropical forests. Palms of various kinds are common. The main varieties of timber trees are enumerated under the heading of Forests.\nTigers are scarce; but elephants, *s\u0101mbar*, bison, leopards, and bears are fairly common in the western tracts towards the Yoma. The rhinoceros is nearly extinct, being ruthlessly hunted for its blood, which is accounted a valuable curative medium by the Burmans, among whom it sells for its weight in silver. In the less-developed parts the smaller kinds of deer and also wild hog were plentiful, but are being rapidly exterminated with nets. Crocodiles are found in most of the tidal creeks, and there are rich turtle-beds to the south near the coast.\n\nThe climate is rather relaxing, though the heat in summer is tempered to some extent by the strong sea-breezes which spring up in the afternoon. The mean of the maximum temperatures in the hotter months is generally about 95\u00b0, that of the minimum temperatures about 75\u00b0.\n\nThe rainfall is heavy, though, owing to the shelter afforded by the Arakan Yoma, it is not to be compared in volume with what the adjoining District of Sandoway receives. The annual average at the District head-quarters for the ten years ending 1904 has been 113 inches, while at the other recording stations it is highest at Ngaputaw in the south (129 inches), and lowest at Kyonpyaw in the north-east (88 inches).\n\nThe great cyclone of May 6, 1902, which affected the whole Burma coast, did some damage in the south and west of the District. Part of the central tract is inundated annually, but serious floods are not known.\n\nLittle is known of the early history of the District. Its Burmese name is Pathein, though how and when this was corrupted into Bassein is far from clear. In old Talaing histories the thirty-two cities of Bassein are mentioned in A.D. 625 as forming part of the newly established kingdom of Pegu. For many centuries after this Bassein was the scene of constant struggles between the Talaings and the Burmans. The port of Bassein has from early days been a trading centre of some importance. In 1687, after two unsuccessful attempts to obtain a footing on the Irrawaddy delta, the East India Company occupied Negrais, an island now known as Hainggyi, at the mouth of the Bassein river, and a trading settlement was established there. In 1757 the Company obtained from Alaungpay\u0101, the king of Ava, who two years previously had seized Bassein from the Peguans, the permanent cession of Negrais and of a piece of land at Bassein, in return for aid promised against the enemies of the Burmans. On October 5, 1759, however, nearly all the Europeans in the settlement were treacherously murdered by the Burmese officials, on suspicion of having helped the Talaings (or Peguans) against Alaungpay\u0101. The brick walls of the factory are still standing. Negotiations in 1801-2 to regain Negrais were fruitless; and the British envoy was treated with characteristic insolence, the king of Ava, Bodawpay\u0101, being then at the summit of his power. But in 1824, during the first Burmese War,\nBassein was taken and held as a pledge by the British till the evacuation of Pegu in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Yandabo. During the second Burmese War, in 1852, the town was stormed by the British troops, and finally occupied. Shortly after the annexation it was proposed to move the District head-quarters from Bassein to what was thought a more suitable site nearer the mouth of the Bassein river; but the beginnings of the new civil station, which was to have been called Dalhousie, were wrecked by a cyclone in 1856\u20137, and the scheme was abandoned. Since 1854, when organized crime was checked by Major Fytche, the District has been quiet, except during the Bogale rebellion, which broke out simultaneously with the guerrilla war in Upper Burma (1806). The District as at present constituted has, so far as its external boundaries are concerned, been in existence since 1893, when a portion of its area was added to the newly created District of Myaungmya.\n\nThe most important shrines are the Shwemoktaw, the Mah\u0101bawdi, the Tagaung, and the Shwezigon pagodas in the town of Bassein itself; the Shinthedat pagoda at Kanni; the Dipayon pagoda at Mezali; the Hmawdin pagoda on a sea-girt eminence at the southernmost extremity of the District.\n\nThe population at the last four enumerations was as follows: (1872) 202,428, (1881) 268,169, (1891) 320,973, and (1901) 391,427. The principal statistics of area and population in 1901 are shown in the following table:\n\n| Township          | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Bassein           | 563                  | 1               | 518      | 104,647    | 186                       | + 11                                                         | 26,262                                 |\n| Thabaung          | 1,118                | ...             | 440      | 47,802     | 43                        | + 23                                                         | 12,400                                 |\n| Ngaputaw          | 1,439                | ...             | 244      | 37,126     | 26                        | + 25                                                         | 9,444                                  |\n| Ngathainggyaung   | 345                  | 1               | 387      | 64,891     | 188                       | + 15                                                         | 20,205                                 |\n| Kyonpyaw          | 292                  | ...             | 466      | 70,010     | 240                       | + 40                                                         | 15,402                                 |\n| Kyaunggon         | 370                  | ...             | 562      | 60,951     | 181                       | + 29                                                         | 14,071                                 |\n| District total    | 4,127                | 2               | 2,617    | 391,427    | 95                        | + 22                                                         | 98,444                                 |\n\nThe growth of population has been rapid, amounting to 45 per cent. since 1872; but it is likely to be less marked in future, as the District is said to have fewer attractions for immigrants than the adjoining delta areas. Except in the Thabaung and Ngaputaw townships, where there are hilly tracts, the density is high. There are only two towns of over 5,000 inhabitants: Bassein, the head-quarters of the District, and Ngathainggyaung. The population is chiefly Buddhist (348,100, or 89 per cent.). Christians come next with 22,400; Hindus number 12,600, and Musalm\u0101ns 6,400.\nBurmese is spoken by 287,300 persons and Karen by 84,100, a figure which indicates that nearly all the Karens use their own vernacular. Though Talaings are numerous, the Talaing language appears to be hardly spoken at all in Bassein, while in the neighbouring District of Myaungmya it is still the speech of one Talaing out of four.\n\nBurmans numbered 271,800 in 1901; Karens, 85,300 (mostly Pwos); Arakanese, 6,300; Talaings, 4,700. There are 1,200 Chinese, only 280 of whom are females. More than half the Musalmans and nearly two-thirds of the Hindus live in Bassein town. The agricultural population in 1901 was returned at 259,100, or 66 per cent. of the total.\n\nThe large Christian population (more numerous than in any District of the Province except Toungoo) is chiefly due to the Karen converts of the American Baptist Mission, of whom 13,890 returned themselves as Baptists in 1901, and who also probably formed a large proportion of the 5,409 Christians who returned no denomination. Roman Catholics and Anglicans (principally natives) number more than 1,200 each. The total of native Christians was 22,000. The American Baptist Mission works among both the Karens and the Burmans. The Roman Catholics have three mission stations in the District.\n\nThe conditions of agriculture are generally uniform. The richest land lies to the north and north-east. In the north the soil is composed of a rich silt-impregnated loam, protected from inundation by an extensive system of Government embankments, while in the north-east the land consists of new clearings of rich tree-jungle. The southern portion of the tract north of the Dag\u0101 is liable to floods caused by the back-wash from the Ngawun. South of the Dag\u0101 the land is slightly higher and consequently of poorer quality, but it falls rapidly south of the town of Bassein. The Ngaputaw township, except for some high ground in the Thongwa circle, is flat and marshy, the soil is thin, and the surface of the land is intersected by tidal creeks. On the west bank of the Ngawun the lower levels are as a rule flooded, owing to the embankment on the east bank of that stream; and the ground gradually rises from the river to the hills, where cultivation is found only in minute patches on the gentler slopes, or in the valleys between the hill ranges. About 37 miles of the Ngawun embankment lie within the limits of the District. This work, with its continuation northward in Henzada, forms a raised embankment 151 miles in length, protecting from inundation about 1,600 square miles of country.\n\nThe methods of cultivation exhibit little variety in the different tracts. Ploughing is performed with a rough wooden plough, consisting of a transverse bar from 7 to 8 feet long, with seven, eight, or nine pointed wooden teeth fixed in it. This is drawn in every direction across the field, more or less frequently according to the quality of the soil. The\nrice is then ordinarily transplanted from the nurseries in which it has been raised. In the Ngaputaw township, however, the grain is generally sown broadcast, the soil here being poorer, and the cost of labour high. In the flooded portions of the District transplanting is not possible till October, and the success of the crop then altogether depends on the sufficiency or otherwise of the later rains.\n\nThe main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are shown below, areas being in square miles:\n\n| Township     | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Forests |\n|--------------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Bassein      | 563        | 244        | ...       |         |\n| Thabaung     | 1,118      | 81         | 1\u00b73       |         |\n| Ngaputaw     | 1,439      | 107        | ...       | 284     |\n| Ngathainggyaung | 345    | 136        | 0\u00b73       |         |\n| Kyonpyaw     | 292        | 171        | 0\u00b73       |         |\n| Kyaunggon    | 370        | 120        | 0\u00b71       |         |\n| **Total**    | **4,127**  | **859**    | **2**     | **284** |\n\nIn the same year 802 square miles were under rice (*kaukkyi*). *Mayin*, or hot-season rice, is grown, but only to a small extent. Garden cultivation covered 41 square miles, of which the plantain groves of the Kyonpyaw township on the banks of the Dag\u00e0 constitute about a third. The *dani* palm is cultivated in the Ngaputaw and Bassein townships on 2,100 acres, and tobacco on 2,700 acres in the Ngathainggyaung township in the north of the District. The size of the average agricultural holding is about 18 acres.\n\nNo efforts are made by the husbandmen to improve the quality of the crop by selection of seed, or to increase the out-turn by artificial manuring, though some years ago the properties of basic slag as a fertilizer were tested. Nor is any improvement likely to occur so long as the Bassein milling firms refuse to give higher rates for better-class paddy. Experiments in the cultivation of tobacco have not found favour with the local agriculturists. Agricultural advances, generally for purchase of cattle or seed-grain, are eagerly taken up, especially in the Bassein subdivision, where cattle-disease is particularly rife. The yearly loss of cattle is enormous, and more stringent measures to eradicate disease are required. The total amount advanced in 1903-4 was Rs. 15,140.\n\nThe cattle of Bassein are of the common breeds of the country, and, except in the Ngathainggyaung subdivision, are only of ordinary quality. In the north, however, where the grazing facilities are good, the live-stock, and especially the bullocks, are above the average. Scarcely any Indian cattle are kept, except in Bassein and Ngathainggyaung towns. As is usually the case in the delta Districts, where land communications are not good, ponies are scarce and the local breed is of\npoor quality. Beasts imported from Prome and other breeding centres command high prices. Goats are few in number.\n\nThe grazing is ample, and no difficulties are encountered in feeding stock. The grazing-grounds are, however, largely devoid of shade, and this fact and the badness of the water-supply in the hot season are the principal causes of disease. The total area of grazing-ground actually reserved is 104,852 acres, and the total number of cattle in 1903\u20134 was 153,700, showing about three-fourths of an acre per head of stock.\n\nNumerous fresh-water fisheries exist, a full account of which will be found in a report by Major Maxwell, published in 1904. They lie for the most part in the north-east of the District. The Fisheries, &c. most important fishery is the Inye Lake in the Kyonpyaw township, the lease of which fetches about Rs. 28,000 annually. Of turtles, both the loggerhead and the green variety are plentiful along the southern coast. The most valuable bank is that at Diamond Island, from which Major Maxwell estimates an out-turn of one and three-quarter millions of turtles\u2019 eggs annually, valued at more than a quarter of a lakh. The District fishery revenue amounted to 2\u00b79 lakhs in 1903\u20134.\n\nThe forests present two types. The first is found along both slopes of the Yoma, and is evergreen, interspersed with patches of bamboo. On the western slope it has been greatly overworked in the past, and steps are being taken to \u2018reserve\u2019 large portions. This tract contains pyingado, pyinma, and about thirty other kinds of timber, and provides large quantities of canes and bamboos used in the fisheries all over the delta and for building. The second type of forest is marshy and tidal, and contains various species of mangrove, kanazo, and other inferior woods, used mainly for fuel. Owing to unrestrained clearing of forest in the north-east, fuel will probably be scarce before long in that quarter. The area of protected and \u2018reserved\u2019 forests is 208 square miles, and that of unprotected but \u2018reserved\u2019 forests 76 square miles. The forest receipts in 1903\u20134 amounted to a lakh.\n\nThe only minerals are pottery clay, laterite, limestone, and sandstone, and they are of little commercial importance. The requirements of the newly constructed railway have brought about a temporary development of the limestone and sandstone industry; but, this demand satisfied, the further working of these mineral resources is likely to stop. Laterite is worked in a spasmodic fashion to meet the requirements of the Public Works department or the Bassein municipality, and pottery clay is collected by the pot-makers of Sinobo and Kwinlya; but there is no systematic working of minerals.\n\nA little gold and silver work is done in Bassein, but it is ordinarily of poor quality. The best-known hand industries are pot-making and the manufacture of umbrellas. Glazed pottery is made principally at\nSinobo near Bassein, and at Kwinlya below Ngathainggyaung. The Bassein umbrella is made of paper or pith, and is generally decorated with elaborate hand-painted floral designs. The country salt, known as kyinsa, is used largely in the making of ngapi, pressed fish or salted fish paste, which is extensively manufactured in the District. From 30 to 40 parts of salt are mixed with 100 parts of fish to make this. A full description of the methods of manufacture is given in the fishery report referred to above, which enumerates eighteen kinds of ngapi, all made in different ways and all bearing different names. It is customary in some cases for the bark of the ondon-tree (Tetrantha laurifolia) to be pounded up and mixed with the ngapi, its object being to prevent decrease of weight through shrinkage.\n\nThe principal factories of Bassein are the rice-mills, of which there are eight, five owned by British firms and three by German. Another, managed by a foreign firm, is in process of construction, and a few minor concerns are the property of residents of Bassein. The rice turned out is of the kind known as 'cargo rice,' i.e. one-fifth of the husk is left on the milled product.\n\nSaw-mills are the only other factories of importance, the most important being one owned by the Sgaw-Karen Baptist Mission. The number of logs sawn in it in 1901 was 4,500, but the completion of the railway and the consequent demand for sleepers has considerably increased the output since then. Pyingado is the principal timber dealt with in the mills. Salt is obtained in the Ngaputaw township by concentration under solar heat, and then by boiling.\n\nThe maritime export trade of Bassein is practically confined to rice, which is grown in the District and milled in the town into 'cargo rice' prior to export to Europe. In 1903-4 the exports of rice were 152,000 tons, valued at 104 lakhs. The total imports by sea in the same year were valued at only Rs. 1,35,000. Owing to the absence in most of the mills of plant for the production of 'white rice,' the exports to India are insignificant. Ordinarily the most important oversea imports are salt, coal, and coco-nuts. Salt comes mainly from Europe, coal from Calcutta, and coco-nuts from Madras or the Straits. A brisk trade in general merchandise is carried on by river steamers with Rangoon and other delta towns. The imports are piece-goods, hardware, and the like; and the exports are ngapi and other local products. The bulk of the petty trade is still in the hands of the Burmans, but natives of India and Chinamen also do a large and growing business.\n\nThe Bassein-Henzada-Letpadan railway, opened to traffic in 1903, passes through the District for 66 miles and taps the centre of it. The principal stations are Dag\u00e0, Athok, Yegyi, and Zayathla. The railway is already very popular with passengers, though it has so far attracted\nlittle goods traffic, and all the paddy still comes by river to be milled at Bassein.\n\nIn the south of the District, where communication is almost entirely by water, the roads are chiefly in the immediate neighbourhood of Bassein town. The total length of metalled roads outside the town is 42 miles, 15\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of which are kept up from Provincial and 26\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) from District cess or other Local funds. The total length of unmetalled roads is 53 miles, 24 being maintained from Provincial and 29 from Local funds. The principal roads are: the Bassein-Shwemyindin road, the Bassein-Henzada road, and the Bassein-Shanywa road. In the Ngathainggyaung subdivision the main highways are from Ngathainggyaung to Ataung (via Kyonpyaw), from Yegyi to Inma (via Athok), and from Inma to Kyonpyaw. In the north the embankments constructed by Government about thirty years ago to prevent the flooding of low-lying areas afford a convenient means of communication during the rains. The Ngawun and Dag\u0101 rivers are navigable practically throughout the District. No sea-going lines of passenger steamers call at the port of Bassein; but the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company runs steamers from Bassein three times a week to Rangoon via Myaungmya, Wakema, and Ma-ubin, and to Kyonpyaw, daily to Myaungmya, and twice a week to Ngathainggyaung, and in the rains onwards to Henzada. The south is served by private launches. The District east of the Yoma contains scarcely a single village of any size which is not supplied with some form of steamer service. Native boats, large and small, ply on all the inland waters, and numerous ferries are maintained.\n\nThe District is divided into two subdivisions, with head-quarters at Bassein and Ngathainggyaung. Each subdivision has three townships.\n\n**Administration.** The Bassein subdivision comprises the Bassein, Thabaung, and Ngaputaw townships; and the Ngathainggyaung subdivision comprises the Ngathainggyaung, Kyonpyaw, and Kyaunggon townships. Bassein is the head-quarters of the Bassein-Myaungmya Forest division, under a Deputy-Conservator of forests; and the Port Officer, Bassein, is collector of customs.\n\nThe District Judge exercises jurisdiction also over Henzada District, and the Bassein Small Cause Court judge is at the same time the judge of the Bassein township court. Two other judges relieve the township officers of the Ngathainggyaung, Kyaunggon, and Kyonpyaw townships of all civil work and have Small Cause Court jurisdiction locally; but in the remaining two townships the township officers are judges in their respective courts.\n\nCriminal justice is administered in the usual way by the executive officers, District, subdivisional, and township. In addition, a special magistrate has recently been appointed to exercise criminal jurisdiction within the limits of the Ngathainggyaung and Bassein sub-\ndivisions. Sessions cases are tried by the Divisional Judge, Bassein Division.\n\nCriminal work is heavy. Cattle-thefts are frequent, as also are robberies. Deterrent sentences have somewhat reduced the criminal use of the knife, but it is still unfortunately common. They have also had the effect of causing bullies to substitute for knives clubs, which in practice are nearly as dangerous. Gambling, with its lamentable predisposition to crime, is very prevalent in all parts of the District; and drunkenness cannot be called rare, although strenuous endeavours have been made in the past to reduce the facilities for drinking.\n\nDuring the first two years (1852-3) of the British occupation, the Burmese tax on cattle was continued by the new rulers, and an impost of Rs. 10 was levied on every pair of buffaloes or bullocks used for ploughing; but no land tax was then demanded of the people. In 1854 surveyors were brought down from Arakan, the different circles were measured and a scale of revenue rates was fixed, though it is not precisely known on what principles they were calculated. These rates were systematically and methodically revised in 1861, crop-cuttings being made and local prices considered. A summary enhancement of 25 per cent. was made in 1879; but during this and the following years a detailed cadastral survey was undertaken, and regular settlement operations at once followed (1879-83) over the whole District, except the Ngaputaw township, the maximum rate per acre sanctioned being Rs. 3-4-0, and the minimum 12 annas. Portions of the Ngathainggyaung and Kyonpyaw townships were dealt with in 1883-4 and 1884-5, and the Ngaputaw township was regularly settled during the season 1901-2. The settlement of 1879-83 was revised between the years 1897-9, the result being an enhancement in the Bassein subdivision of 20 per cent. and in the Ngathainggyaung subdivision of 48 per cent. The maximum rate on rice land now in force is Rs. 4 and the minimum 12 annas, the average being Rs. 2-4-0. The maximum on mixed gardens is Rs. 3 per acre and the minimum Rs. 2-8-0, the average being Rs. 2-12-0. Betel-vines are taxed at Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 per acre, dani palms at Rs. 4 to Rs. 5, and miscellaneous cultivation at rates varying from Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2-8-0.\n\nThe tax on salt is Rs. 2-3-6 per 100 viss (365 lb.) turned out. The system of raising the salt revenue by a tax on output was introduced in 1902 as an experiment, the arrangement previously in force having been to tax the cauldrons employed in boiling. After a brief strike the salt-makers acquiesced in this method of assessment. For the realization of the tax a staff of two inspectors and two assistant inspectors is employed.\n\nThe land revenue was 12.8 lakhs in 1900-1 and 13.8 lakhs in 1903-4. Comparative figures cannot be given for earlier years, owing to the\nmodifications that have taken place during the interval in the District boundaries, but it may be pointed out that the land revenue raised from an area larger than the present District was \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\) lakhs in 1886. The total revenue from all sources was 35.9 lakhs in 1900-1 and 29.3 lakhs in 1903-4.\n\nThe District cess fund, administered by the Deputy-Commissioner for the provision of roads, &c., is maintained by a 10 per cent. levy on the land revenue. Its income in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,65,000, and the chief item of expenditure was Rs. 52,000 on public works. Bassein and Ngathainggyaung with Daunggyi are the only municipalities.\n\nSouth of Cape Negrais, in 15\u00b0 42' N. and 94\u00b0 17' E., is the Alguada reef, on which a lighthouse was built in 1865. The structure is of granite, stands 144 feet high, and till 1902 exhibited a first-class catadioptric light visible at 20 miles. In 1902 a new light of 97,000 candle-power, visible 18 miles, was substituted for the old one.\n\nThe police are under a Superintendent, assisted by three Assistant Superintendents, in charge of the Ngathainggyaung and Bassein subdivisions and the town of Bassein respectively. The force consists of 3 inspectors, 2 chief head constables, 9 head constables, and 369 sergeants and constables, distributed in 20 police stations and outposts. The military police, who belong to the Toungoo battalion, number 199, and are posted as follows: 90 at Bassein, 34 at Ngathainggyaung, and the remainder at outlying township head-quarters.\n\nThe Central jail at Bassein has accommodation for 1,271 prisoners, and had an average daily population in 1903 of 730. The principal industry is mat-making, and the mats are taken as fast as they can be turned out for the shipping which visits Bassein. Furniture is also manufactured and is sold locally.\n\nThe percentage of literate persons in 1901 was 41 in the case of males and 7.5 in the case of females, or 25 for both sexes together. The number of pupils at school has increased from 8,630 in 1880-1 to 11,019 in 1890-1, and to 11,531 in 1903-4. In the last year the District contained 19 secondary, 218 primary, 6 special, and 230 elementary (private) schools, with 8,908 male and 2,623 female pupils. The principal educational institution is the Bassein municipal high school, in which instruction is given up to the ninth standard. The expenditure on education in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 68,600, of which municipalities contributed Rs. 16,700, the cess fund Rs. 14,500, and the Government Rs. 10,400, while Rs. 16,300 was collected in fees and Rs. 10,700 in subscriptions.\n\nThere are two hospitals, with accommodation for 75 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 24,853, including 1,389 in-patients, and 1,135 operations were performed. The income amounted to Rs. 20,300, the two municipalities contributing Rs. 14,500, private\nsubscriptions Rs. 2,300, and Local funds Rs. 2,500. A dispensary is about to be built at Kyaunggon.\n\nVaccination is compulsory only in the towns of Bassein and Ngathainggyaung, but progress in vaccination during recent years has been fair. In 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 16,320, representing 42 per 1,000 of population.\n\n[J. Mackenna, Settlement Reports (1899-1900 and 1903); Major F. D.

The two townships together had a population of 94,301 in 1891 and 104,647 in 1901, half the increase being due to non-agriculturists. They contained one town, Bassein (population, 31,864), the head-quarters; and 518 villages. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 244 square miles, paying a land revenue of Rs. 3,67,000.\n\n**Bassein Town (Pathin).**\u2014Head quarters of the Irrawaddy Division and of Bassein District, Lower Burma, situated in $16^\\circ 46'$ N. and $94^\\circ 46'$ E., on both banks of the Bassein river, 75 miles from the sea and 192 by rail from Rangoon. The population, including that of Bassein port, has increased steadily from 20,688 in 1872 to 28,147 in 1881, 30,177 in 1891, and 31,864 in 1901. It comprises Burmans, Karens, natives of India, and Chinamen, the first forming about two-thirds of the whole. The main portion of the town, consisting of the Athegyi, Talainggyaung, and Myothit quarters, which comprise the civil station and the bazar, lies on the left or eastern bank of the river, while the Thinbawgyin quarter on the western bank contains the principal mills. No trustworthy records of the early history of the town exist. One tradition puts its foundation in the thirteenth century, but old Talaing histories mention the thirty-two cities of Bassein (Pathein) much earlier. It is believed by some that the name is Talaing in origin; but the theory that Pathin has some connexion with Pathi, the Burmese name for a Musalm\u0101n, is not unreasonable, and it is indisputable that the town has long been inhabited by natives of India. Bassein has for centuries been a trading centre of some importance; and even if it be not identical with the ancient port of Cosmin, referred to by Cesare de' Federici and Gaspar Balbi, it is possible that Cosmin was within the limits of the existing District. The seizure of the town\nby the Burmese troops in 1755 was one of the first incidents in the great Alaungpaya's earliest campaign against the Peguans in the south. The British were at that time established as traders in Bassein, and in 1757 the East India Company obtained a piece of land in the town by treaty with the victorious monarch of Ava, and secured free trading rights within the port. Two years later all the Europeans were massacred. The town was captured in 1824 during the first Burmese War and held till the Treaty of Yandabo, to be finally occupied in the second Burmese War in 1852.\n\nThe town has an area of nearly 12 square miles, the greater part of which is wooded. The principal streets run parallel to the river, with short connecting roads. The most important is the Strand road, following the stream, from which the other main thoroughfares branch off. The total length of roads within municipal limits is $37\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. The Government offices and treasury are on the site of the old Zechaung fort, built after the province of Pegu was annexed. Around the fort lies the civil station. To the east is the Myothit quarter, through which run two main streets to a pagoda-covered plain, where all the local festivals are held. Close by the fort lie the other principal public buildings, post and telegraph offices, the Queen Victoria Memorial Library, the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, and the extensive premises of the American Baptist Mission. There are public gardens and a Jubilee Memorial Park. The town contains a number of pagodas, among the most sacred being the Shwemoktaw within the limits of the Zechaung fort, the Tagaung, the Pay\u0101gyigon, the Mah\u0101bawdi, the Shwezigon, and the Wethu.\n\nBassein is well served by the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, the steamers of which run eastwards to Rangoon and Myaungmya, and northwards to Kyonpyaw and Ngathainggyaung, and, during the rains, to Henzada. The new railway gives connexion twice a day with Henzada (82 miles), and once a day with Letpadan and Rangoon (192 miles). The principal industry is rice-milling; eight important mills and some smaller concerns turn out what is known as 'cargo rice' (one-fifth husk). The manufacture of earthenware and timber-sawing are also important local industries.\n\nBassein is almost exclusively an exporting market. In 1903-4, 152,000 tons of 'cargo rice,' valued at 104 lakhs, left the port, consigned entirely to Europe. Imports from foreign countries are insignificant; those from Indian ports were valued in 1903-4 at Rs. 89,000, comprising gunnies, betel-nuts, and other Indian commodities. A steady river-borne trade is carried on with Rangoon, and commerce with the rest of Burma is likely to be stimulated by the new railway.\n\nBassein is the head-quarters of the Judge of the Bassein Division. The town was constituted a municipality in 1874. The municipal\nincome during the ten years ending 1901 averaged 1\u00b72 lakhs, and the expenditure 1\u00b71 lakhs. The figures for 1903-4 were 1\u00b75 lakhs and 1\u00b76 lakhs respectively. The chief sources of revenue in the latter year were house tax (Rs. 28,000), lighting rate (Rs. 10,000), conservancy (Rs. 11,500), and bazars (Rs. 56,000); while the chief objects of expenditure were lighting (Rs. 12,000), conservancy (Rs. 25,000), hospitals (Rs. 20,000), schools (Rs. 7,500), and roads (Rs. 31,000).\n\nThe port is administered through a Port fund, which derives its income from shipping dues, &c., and bears the cost of lighting and buoying the channels. The Port fund income in 1903-4 was Rs. 37,000. There is a municipal high school, teaching up to the ninth standard, in addition to missionary schools, and a Convent school for girls. The civil hospital has 63 beds.\n\n**Bassein River (Ngawin).**\u2014A river of Burma, being the most westerly of the waterways through which the waters of the Irrawaddy find their way to the sea. It leaves the main channel a few miles above the town of Henzada, and flows in a south-westery direction, past the towns of Lemyethna and Ngathainggyaung-Daunggyi, through the flat delta country, to Bassein, and thence, after a total course of 200 miles, into the Bay of Bengal immediately north of the Alguada Reef lighthouse, at about the 16th parallel of latitude. Bassein, famous in the past as a commercial emporium, and still important as a rice-shipping centre, lies on its left or eastern bank, at a point about 75 miles from where it flows into the sea. Ocean steamers can proceed up as far as Bassein, and the river is navigable by light-draught launches throughout its entire length during the rainy season.\n\n**Bassein Taluka.**\u2014Western taluka of Th\u0101na District, Bombay, lying between 19\u00b0 16' and 19\u00b0 35' N. and 72\u00b0 44' and 73\u00b0 1' E., with an area of 223 square miles. It contains one town, Bassein (population, 10,702), the head-quarters, and 90 villages, including Ag\u0101shi (8,506). The population in 1901 was 80,251, compared with 76,110 in 1891. The density, 360 persons per square mile, largely exceeds the District average. Land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to 1\u00b78 lakhs. The taluka is formed of a portion of the mainland and of territory which was once the island of Bassein, but is now no longer an island, the narrow creek which divided it from the mainland having silted up. With the exception of two small hills, about 200 feet high, the surface of the island portion is flat, with a rich soil, yielding crops of rice, plantain, sugar-cane, and p\u0101n. On the mainland portion are the Tung\u0101r and K\u0101man hills, both over 2,000 feet in height, the last named, known as Bassein Peak or K\u0101mandrug, being 2,160 feet above sea-level. On the coast the climate is generally pleasant and equable; inland the heat is great, and in the rains much fever prevails.\nBassein Town (Fasai, that is, 'The Settlement').\u2014Head-quarters of the taluka of the same name in Th\u0101na District, Bombay, situated in 19\u00b0 20' N. and 72\u00b0 49' E., about 5 miles from the Bassein Road station of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, and 28 miles north of Bombay. Population (1901), 10,702. The town was constituted a municipality in 1864, the income in 1903\u20134 being Rs. 17,000. In that year the total value of the seaborne trade of Bassein was 13 lakhs, of which 5 lakhs represented imports and 8 lakhs exports. The town contains a dispensary, a Sub-Judge's court, an English middle school with 53 pupils, 8 vernacular schools for boys with 395 pupils, and one for girls with 71 pupils.\n\nBassein early attracted the notice of the Portuguese, as the river or strait separating the island from the mainland was a convenient rendezvous for shipping. In 1534 Bassein with the land in its neighbourhood was ceded to them by Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h, king of Gujar\u0101t, and two years later the fort was built. For more than two centuries Bassein remained in the hands of the Portuguese, and during this time it rose to such prosperity that it came to be called the Court of the North, and its nobles were proverbial for their wealth and magnificence. With plentiful supplies of both timber and stone, Bassein was adorned with many noble buildings, including a cathedral, five convents, thirteen churches, and an asylum for orphans. The dwellings of the Hidalgos, or aristocracy, who alone were allowed to live within the city walls, are described (1675) as stately buildings, two storeys high, graced with covered balconies and large windows. Towards the end of the seventeenth century Bassein suffered severely from outbreaks of the plague, so deadly that in 1695 one-third of the population was swept away. Notwithstanding the decay of Portuguese power in the seventeenth century, Bassein, as late as 1720, would seem to have retained much of its prosperity. In that year the population was returned at 60,499, and the revenue a few years later (1729) at as much as 4\u00bd lakhs (Xer. 914,125). But the wealth of one city was unable to stay the advance of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 power. In 1739 Chinn\u0101ji Appa, a distinguished Mar\u0101th\u0101 general, at the head of a powerful army, appeared before Bassein. After a siege of three months, conducted on both sides with the greatest skill and courage, the garrison was forced to capitulate, and the town and district of Bassein passed into the hands of the Peshw\u0101. Under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Bassein became the chief place in their territories between the B\u0101nkot river and Dam\u0101n; but they did not long keep possession of the city. In 1780, after a siege of twelve days, Bassein was captured by a British army under the command of General Goddard. By the Treaty of S\u0101lbai (1782) it was restored to the Mar\u0101th\u0101s; and in 1818, on the overthrow of the last of the Peshw\u0101s, it was resumed by the English and incorporated with Th\u0101na District. Here was concluded,\nin 1802, the treaty by which the Peshwa agreed to maintain a British subsidiary force, thus virtually dissolving the Mar\u0101th\u0101 confederacy.\n\nOf Old Bassein, the walls and ramparts remain in a state of good preservation. Within the enclosure, the ruins of the cathedral, of the Dominican convent, of the Jesuit Church of St. Paul, and of St. Anthony\u2019s Church, built as early as 1537, can still be identified.\n\n[Dr. Da Cunha, Antiquities of Bassein (Bombay, 1876).]\n\nBastar.\u2014Feudatory State in the Central Provinces, lying between $17^\\circ 46'$ and $20^\\circ 14'$ N. and $80^\\circ 15'$ and $82^\\circ 15'$ E., with an area of 13,062 square miles. It is situated in the south-eastern corner of the Province, and is bounded north by the K\u0101nker State, south by the God\u0101vari District of Madras, west by Ch\u0101nda District, Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, and the God\u0101vari river, and east by the Jeypore estate in Vizagapatam. The chief town is Jagdalpur (population, 4,762), situated on the Indr\u0101vati river, 136 miles south of Dhamtari. The town is well laid out, with many handsome buildings and two fine tanks. The central and north-western portions of the State are very mountainous. To the east, for two-thirds of the total length from north to south, extends a plateau with an elevation of about 2,000 feet above sea-level, broken by small isolated ranges. The old and new capitals, Bastar and Jagdalpur, are situated towards the south of the plateau. The Indr\u0101vati river, rising in the K\u0101l\u0101handi State, enters Bastar on the plateau near Jagdalpur, and flows across the centre of the State from east to west, dividing it into two portions. On reaching the border it turns to the south, and forms the boundary of Bastar until it joins the God\u0101vari below Sironch\u0101. At Chitrakot, where the Indr\u0101vati leaves the Jagdalpur plateau, is a fine waterfall, 94 feet high, while the course of the river through the western hills exhibits some extremely picturesque scenery. The rivers next in importance are the S\u0101bari, which divides Bastar from Jeypore on the east, and the Tel, which rises in the State and flows south-west to the God\u0101vari. The north-western portion of the State is covered by a mass of rugged hills known locally as the Abujm\u0101r, or country of the M\u0101ria Gonds. South of the Indr\u0101vati the Bail\u0101dila (\u2018bullock\u2019s hump\u2019) range runs through the centre of Bastar from north to south, its highest peaks being over 4,000 feet above sea-level, while smaller ranges extend in an easterly direction to the south of the plateau. The south-western tracts are low-lying, but are broken by ranges of sandstone hills, all of which run from north-west to south-east, each range ending in a steep declivity, a few miles south of which another parallel chain commences. Great boulders of vitrified sandstone strew the surface of these hills and gleam pink in the sun. The rock formation belongs partly to the gneissic and transition series, but is mainly the Lower Vindhyan, consisting of sandstones, shales, and limestones. The forests in the south-west contain a considerable\nquantity of teak, with which is mixed bijasal (*Pterocarpus Marsupium*). Towards the north-east the teak rapidly disappears, and is replaced by sal (*Shorea robusta*), which then becomes the principal timber tree, though much of the forest is of the nature of scrub. Frequently the undergrowth is replaced by patches of dense high grass, with scattered trees of *Diospyros* or ebony. The *Carvota urens* and the palmyra palm are found, the latter in the south and the former in the west and north. Cane brakes also occur by the hill streams. Bamboos, of which three species occur, are restricted entirely to the hills. The average annual rainfall exceeds 50 inches, and the climate on the plateau is pleasantly cool, 102\u00b0 being the highest recorded.\n\nThe family of the R\u0101j\u0101 is a very ancient one. It is stated to belong to the R\u0101jp\u016bts of the Lunar race, and to have come originally from Warangal about the commencement of the fourteenth century, driven thence by the encroachments of the Muhammadan power. The traditional founder of the family, Annam Deo, is said to have established himself in Bastar under the protection of the goddess Danteshwari, still the tutelary deity of the family and the State, who presented him with a sword which is held in veneration to the present day. The temple of the goddess at Dantew\u0101ra, at the confluence of the Sankan\u012b and Dankan\u012b rivers, was formerly the scene of an annual human sacrifice similar to that of the Khonds; and for many years after 1842 a guard was placed over the temple, and the R\u0101j\u0101 held personally responsible for its discontinuance. Up to the time of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s Bastar occupied an almost independent position, but a tribute was imposed on it by the N\u0101gpur government in the eighteenth century. At this period the constant feuds between Bastar and the neighbouring State of Jeypore in Madras kept the country for many years in a state of anarchy. The chief object of contention was the Kotapad tract, which had originally belonged to Bastar, but had been ceded in return for assistance given by Jeypore to one of the Bastar chiefs during some family dissensions. The Central Provinces Administration finally made this over to Jeypore in 1863, on condition of payment of tribute of Rs. 3,000, two-thirds of which sum was remitted from the amount payable by Bastar. By virtue of this arrangement the tribute of Bastar was, until recently, reduced to a nominal amount. The late R\u0101j\u0101, Bhairon Deo, died in 1891 at the age of 52. In consequence of the continued misgovernment under which the State had suffered for some years, an officer selected by the Local Administration had been appointed as Diw\u0101n in 1886. The late R\u0101j\u0101's infant son, Rudra Prat\u0101p Deo, was recognized as his successor, and during his minority the State is being managed by Government. For six years two European officers held the office of Administrator, but this post was abolished in 1904 and a native officer was appointed as Superintendent. The young chief,\nwho was twenty years old in 1905, has been educated at the Rajkumar College, Raipur.\n\nThe population in 1901 was 306,501 persons, having decreased by 1 per cent. during the previous decade. The State contains 2,525 inhabited villages, and the density of population is only 23 persons per square mile. About two-thirds of the inhabitants are Gonds, and there are also a number of Halb\u0101s. The Gonds of Bastar are perhaps the wildest tribe in the Province. In some localities they still wear no clothing beyond a string of beads round the waist, while the approach of a stranger is frequently a signal for the whole village to take to the jungle. The language principally spoken is Halb\u012b, a mixed dialect of Hindi, Oriy\u0101, and Mar\u0101th\u012b. Bhatr\u012b, a dialect of Oriy\u0101, is the speech of about 6 per cent. of the population, while the M\u0101ria Gonds have a language peculiar to themselves. More than 7 per cent. of the population speak Telugu. The Methodist Episcopal Church has a station at Jagdalpur.\n\nThe soil throughout the greater part of Bastar consists of a light clay with an admixture of sand, well adapted to the raising of rice, but requiring a good supply of water. There has been no cadastral survey except in 647 villages of the open country on the plateau, of which 486 have been regularly settled. No statistics of cultivation for the State as a whole are therefore available. The cultivation is, however, extremely sparse, as even in the regularly settled tract, which is the most advanced and populous portion of the State, only 25 per cent. of the total area available has been brought under the plough. Rice is by far the most important crop, but various small millets, pulses, and gram are also grown. There are a few irrigation tanks in the open country. About 9,800 square miles, or three-fourths of the whole area of the State, are forest or grass land, but only about 5,000 square miles contain regular forest. The remainder either has been wholly denuded of forest growth by the system of shifting cultivation, or is covered only by valueless low scrub. The moist or s\u0101l forests occur in the tract south of the Indr\u0101vati and east of the Bail\u0101dila range, principally occupying the valleys and lower hills and the eastern plateau. The dry forests, in which the principal tree is teak, are distributed over the south, west, and north-west of the State, and also cover the higher slopes of the hills in the moist forest belt. The commercial value of the forests is determined at present rather by their proximity to a market and the comparative facilities of transport than by the intrinsic quality of the timber. The principal products are teak and other timbers, myrabolams, lac, wax, honey, hides and horns, tanning and dyeing barks, tasar silk cocoons, and other minor articles. Rich and extensive deposits of iron ore occur, especially in association with the transition rocks. Mica has been found in several places, the largest plates discovered near Jung\u0101ni from surface deposits measuring about 5 inches across, but being cloudy\nand cracked. Gold in insignificant quantities is obtained by washing in the Indr\u0101vati and other streams in the west. The State contains 121 miles of gravelled and 191 miles of embanked roads; the principal routes are those leading from Jagdalpur to Dhamtari, to Jeypore, and to Ch\u0101nda. The bulk of the trade goes to Dhamtari station.\n\nThe State is in charge of a Political Agent for the Feudatory States, under the supervision of the Commissioner, Chhattisgarh Division. For administrative purposes Bastar is divided into five tahsils, each in charge of a tahsild\u0101r. The Superintendent of the State is at present an Extra-Assistant Commissioner and has two Assistants with magisterial powers. The State also employs European Forest and Medical officers. There are seven subordinate zamind\u0101ri estates covering 4,189 square miles, situated mainly to the south of the Indr\u0101vati. The total revenue in 1904 was 2.76 lakhs, the main items being land (Rs. 1,15,000), including cesses, arrears, and miscellaneous receipts, forests (Rs. 65,000), and excise (Rs. 70,000). A revised assessment of land revenue has recently been sanctioned. The net demand for land revenue in 1904 was only Rs. 83,000, a considerable proportion being \u2018assigned.\u2019 A cadastral survey has been effected in 647 villages of the Jagdalpur tahsil, and in most of these a regular settlement based on soil classification has been carried out. The remaining area is summarily settled, the rates being fixed on the seed required for each holding, or on the number of ploughs in the possession of the cultivators. The incidence of the land revenue per cultivated acre in the regularly settled tract is 5 annas 1 pie. The total expenditure in 1904 was 2.52 lakhs, the principal heads being Government tribute (Rs. 15,600), allowances to the ruling family (Rs. 24,000), administration (Rs. 32,000), forests (Rs. 15,000), excise (Rs. 15,000), land revenue settlement (Rs. 7,700), and public works (Rs. 37,000). The tribute is liable to revision. Since 1893 the State has expended 5.68 lakhs on public works, under the supervision of the Engineer of the Chhattisgarh States division. The works carried out include, besides the roads already mentioned, residences for the chief and the Administrator and for the zamind\u0101r of Bhop\u0101lpatnam, office buildings at Jagdalpur and the head-quarters of tahsils, and a school, dispensary, and sarai at Jagdalpur. The State maintains 51 schools, including an English middle school at Jagdalpur, 4 vernacular middle schools, and a girls\u2019 school, with a total of about 3,000 pupils. The expenditure on education in 1904 was Rs. 11,000. Only 1,997 persons were returned as able to read and write in 1901, the proportion of literate males being 1.2 per cent. Dispensaries have been established at Jagdalpur, Ant\u0101garh, Kondegaon, Bhop\u0101lpatnam, Kond\u0101, and Bij\u0101pur, at which 59,000 persons were treated in 1904, and Rs. 12,000 was expended on medical relief.\n\nBasti District.\u2014North-western District of the Gorakhpur Division,\nUnited Provinces, lying north of the Gogra river, between $26^\\circ 25'$ and $27^\\circ 30'$ N. and between $82^\\circ 13'$ and $83^\\circ 14'$ E., with an area of 2,792 square miles. It is bounded on the north by Nep\u0101l territory; on the east by Gorakhpur District; on the south by the Gogra, which divides it from Fyz\u0101b\u0101d; and on the west by Gond\u0101. Bast\u012b lies entirely in the submontane plain, with no natural elevations to diversify its surface. It is traversed by a considerable number of small streams, and the north-west corner resembles the rice swamps of the Nep\u0101l tarai. The whole of the drainage ultimately reaches the Gogra, but not within Bast\u012b District. The northern portion, extending 14 to 20 miles from the Nep\u0101l frontier to the R\u0101pti, has a much greater rainfall than the rest. Many small streams rushing down from the lower hills or rising in the Nep\u0101l tarai water this tract, chief among them being the B\u016brhi or 'old' R\u0101pti, the B\u0101ngang\u0101, and the Jamw\u0101r. South of the R\u0101pti the central plateau of the District extends almost to the Gogra, and is drained chiefly by the Kuw\u0101n\u0101, which has a course parallel to the R\u0101pti and Gogra. The Katnehi\u0101, Raw\u0101i, and Manw\u0101r are the principal tributaries of the Kuw\u0101n\u0101. Another small river, the Ami, crosses the upland between the R\u0101pti and Kuw\u0101n\u0101. There are many natural lakes or depressions, often formed in the old beds of rivers, the largest being the Bakhira, Chand\u016b, Pathr\u0101, Chaur, and Jaso\u0101 T\u0101ls.\n\nAs is usual in the submontane tracts, kankar or nodular limestone is scarce. No other rock of any kind is found in the alluvium of which the District is composed.\n\nThe flora resembles that of the submontane tracts. Forests formerly existed, but have been cut down. The District is, however, well provided with clumps of mango, bamboo, and mahu\u0101 (Bassia latifolia).\n\nWild hog, nilgai, wolves, and jackals are common. Spotted deer are occasionally seen. During the cold season wild-fowl and snipe abound in the numerous lakes and swamps. Fish are plentiful, and are much used for food. Snakes and crocodiles are also common.\n\nThe climate of Bast\u012b is distinctly milder than that of the more western Districts, and extremes of heat and cold are less marked. It is, however, not specially unhealthy, except at the close of the rains.\n\nThe annual rainfall averages 49 inches, ranging from 46 in the south-west to 52 towards the north. Near the Nep\u0101l frontier the fall is still heavier. Large variations occur from year to year. In 1877 only 24 inches were received, compared with 76 in 1894.\n\nMaterials for the history of the tract included in Bast\u012b District are unusually scarce. It possibly formed part of the great kingdom of Kosala. For some years Kapilavastu, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, was believed to have been situated at Bhui\u0101, 15 miles north-west of Bast\u012b town; but this\nidentification has been abandoned in favour of a site just outside the north-east angle of the District, in Nepal. The northern part had certainly relapsed into jungle by the fifth century A.D., when it was visited by Fa Hian, though the ruins of earlier buildings were numerous. The traditions of the Rajput clans who now hold the District point to the conclusion that they began to enter it late in the thirteenth century, displacing the Bhars and the Domkatars; but little reliance can be placed on them. A number of petty Rajas held the country and fought with each other. In Akbar's reign the Muhammadans penetrated the District after taking Gorakhpur, and maintained a garrison at Maghar; and Basti was included in the Subah of Oudh. About 1610 the Muslims were expelled; but they returned in force in 1680, and opened up the country. Most of the District was included in the Gorakhpur sarkar, and its later history is that of Gorakhpur District, from which it was only separated in 1865, though ceded to the British by the Nawab Wazir of Oudh in 1801.\n\nMany ancient mounds are found in the District, but few have been excavated. Bhuil\u0101, already referred to, was examined by General Cunningham and his assistant\u00b9. A stupa at Piprahwa in the north of the District was recently excavated, and yielded an interesting find of relics in an inscribed casket\u00b2. Gupta coins are occasionally found in various localities. The only Muhammadan building of interest is the shrine of Kabir at Maghar.\n\nBasti contains 4 towns and 6,903 villages. Population is increasing steadily. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 1,473,029, (1881) 1,630,612, (1891) 1,785,844, and (1901) 1,846,153. There are five tahsils\u2014Domariaganj, Bans\u012b, Haraiy\u0101, Basti, and Khalil\u0101b\u0101d\u2014the head-quarters of each being at a place of the same name. Basti, the District head-quarters, is the largest town. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil       | Area in square miles | Number of | Population per square mile | Percentage variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|              |                      | Towns     | Villages                   | Population                                             |                                          |\n| Domariaganj  | 593                  | 1         | 1,111                      | 322,321                                                | + 2.9                                    | 9,470                                    |\n| Bans\u012b        | 621                  | 1         | 1,343                      | 492,277                                                | + 10.9                                   | 9,938                                    |\n| Haraiy\u0101      | 478                  | ...       | 1,461                      | 333,801                                                | - 5.1                                    | 9,395                                    |\n| Basti        | 536                  | 1         | 1,600                      | 393,079                                                | + 4.0                                    | 12,808                                   |\n| Khalil\u0101b\u0101d   | 564                  | 1         | 1,388                      | 394,675                                                | + 3.7                                    | 10,393                                   |\n| District total| 2,792                | 4         | 6,903                      | 1,846,153                                              | + 3.4                                    | 52,004                                   |\n\n\u00b9 Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xii, p. 108.\n\u00b2 Journal, Royal Asiatic Society, 1898, p. 573.\nHindus form nearly 84 per cent. of the total and Muhammadans 16 per cent. The District is densely populated, and supplies a considerable number of emigrants to the West Indies and to Eastern Bengal and Assam. During the last decade it probably gained by immigration from the more distressed Districts south of the Gogra. Almost the whole population speak Bih\u0101r\u012b.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are: Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and cultivators), 278,000; Br\u0101hmans, 195,000; Ahirs (graziers and cultivators), 185,000; Kurmis (agriculturists), 148,000; Bani\u0101s, 52,000; R\u0101jputs, 50,000; Kah\u0101rs (domestic servants and cultivators), 48,000; and Kewats (cultivators), 40,000. The aboriginal Bhars, who once held the land, are now depressed and number only 50,000. Among Musalm\u0101ns may be mentioned Shaikhs, 50,000; Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 43,000; Path\u0101ns, 34,000; and R\u0101jputs, 34,000. Agriculture supports 66 per cent. of the total population, and general labour 9 per cent. Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs or Chhattris hold about two-thirds of the land, and Br\u0101hmans occupy a larger area than any other caste. R\u0101jputs, Ahirs, Kurmis, and Cham\u0101rs are also large cultivators, while the Koiris are noted for their skill.\n\nThere were only 53 native Christians in 1901, of whom 24 belonged to the Anglican communion. The Church Missionary Society has a high school at Bast\u012b, and there is also a Zan\u0101na mission.\n\nThe climate and soil are suitable for the growth of nearly all the more valuable products, and the comparatively heavy rainfall is especially favourable to rice. Wheat and poppy do best in the lighter loams, and are accordingly grown between the R\u0101pt\u012b and Gogra. North of the R\u0101pt\u012b late rice is the principal crop. In the inferior light soils barley takes the place of wheat, and kodon of rice. There is a tract of peculiar calcareous soil, known as bh\u016bt, along both banks of the R\u0101pt\u012b, which is very retentive of moisture and produces good crops without irrigation. In the bed of the Gogra strips of alluvial soil are liable to flooding in the rains, but are cultivated for the spring harvest.\n\nAbout one-third of the District is included in zam\u012bnd\u0101ri mah\u0101ls, and two-thirds in pattid\u0101ri, the area of bhaiyach\u0101r\u0101 mah\u0101ls being very small. A great many under-proprietors are found, called birtias. One class of birt is peculiar to the District, having been originally granted to a military colony of R\u0101jputs or Chhattris who were settled on the border as guardians against invasion. The main agricultural statistics for 1903\u20134 are given in the table on next page, in square miles.\n\nRice is the crop most largely grown, covering 1,000 square miles, or 50 per cent. of the net cultivated area, in 1903\u20134. The other food-crops of importance are wheat (377 square miles), peas and mas\u016br (325), gram (237), barley (208), and arhar (185). The most valuable\ncrops are, however, poppy, grown on 33 square miles, and sugar-cane, grown on 68. Oilseeds are also important, covering 136 square miles.\n\n| Tahsil     | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Domari\u0101ganj| 593   | 427        | 142       | 80              |\n| B\u0101nsi      | 621   | 493        | 144       | 64              |\n| Haraiy\u0101    | 478   | 338        | 211       | 75              |\n| Bast\u012b      | 536   | 387        | 238       | 70              |\n| Khalil\u0101b\u0101d | 564   | 394        | 234       | 76              |\n| **Total**  | **2,792** | **2,009** | **969**   | **365**         |\n\nAt the time of its cession to the British in 1801, the District was in a very depressed condition. A settled government soon gave an impetus to cultivation, and led to the introduction of the more valuable crops, sugar-cane and poppy. During the thirty years preceding the last settlement the cultivated area increased by 13 per cent., or, including the jungle grants in the north of the District, by 20 per cent. In the last fifteen years there has been a further small increase of about 2 per cent. and a still larger rise in the area double cropped. There has been no appreciable change in the staples grown. Advances are taken freely under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act, and amounted to a total of 1\u00b72 lakhs during the ten years ending 1901, of which Rs. 51,000 was lent in the famine year 1896\u20137. From Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 has been advanced annually since 1900.\n\nThe cattle of the District are generally inferior, but those bred in the Mah\u016bl\u012b pargana are a little above the average. Buffaloes are largely kept for milk. Ponies are used a good deal both for riding and as pack-animals, but are of a very poor stamp. Sheep and goats are chiefly kept for the supply of wool, skins, and manure.\n\nIn 1903\u20134, 323 square miles were irrigated from wells, 435 from tanks and swamps, and 211 from other sources. Wells are chiefly important in the southern half of the upland area between the Gogra and R\u0101pti, and their use decreases as the latter river is approached. North of the R\u0101pti they are hardly used at all. Water is invariably raised from them by the lever or by two pots slung on a wheel. The natural ponds and swamps, which are so numerous in the District, are everywhere used for irrigation, in addition to the small tanks which have been excavated. The swing-basket is used to raise water from these sources of supply. The larger rivers are not used at all for irrigation, as their beds lie too low; but the smaller streams are held up by small temporary earthen dams, and their water is turned into the rice-fields as required. In the north-east of the District two European grantees have constructed a series of works which effectually protect about 52,000 acres of rice land. The valleys of several\nsmall rivers have been dammed with earthen embankments provided with weirs and gates, so that sudden floods can be allowed to escape. Water is conducted by 82 miles of main canals and about 250 miles of distributaries to all parts of the estates. No water rates are charged, but the cultivators voluntarily keep the works in repair. This is the only considerable system of private canals in the United Provinces, and has been imitated with success by a native zamindar, who owns an estate close by. Except in the case of rice-fields, irrigation is chiefly required for the spring harvest. Water is usually sprinkled over the land with a wooden shovel; but poppy and garden crops are flooded.\n\nThe chief mineral product is kankar or nodular limestone, which is used for metalling roads and making lime. It is, however, scarce and of poor quality, and lacustrine shells are also used for making lime. Saltpetre is manufactured from the saline efflorescence called rih.\n\nThe District is exceptionally poor in industrial enterprise. Sugar-refining alone is of some importance. Agricultural implements, coarse cotton cloth, and the ordinary utensils for household use are made locally. Brass vessels are made at Bakhira, but these and also cloth are largely imported. A little chintz is made at Nagar and Bahadurpur.\n\nThe trade of the District with other parts of India is chiefly in agricultural produce. Rice, sugar, opium, saltpetre, oilseeds, and hides are exported; and cloth, metals, salt, cotton, and tobacco are imported. The through trade with Nepal is also of importance. Iron, drugs, spices, ghi, fibres, and rice come from Nepal; and raw sugar, salt, hardware, tobacco, coco-nuts, cotton yarn, and cloth are sent to that State. Uska and Mehndawal are the chief marts for the traffic of the north of the District with Nepal. The commerce of the south is partly carried by the Gogra; but the railway has largely replaced the river, as is usual where the two means of carriage compete. Cawnpore in the west and Calcutta in the east attract most of the trade of the District.\n\nThe Bengal and North-Western Railway main line crosses Basti from east to west, and Uska in the north-east corner is at present the terminus of a branch from Gorakhpur. It is, however, being connected with Tulsipur in Gonda District by a line which will pass very close to the border of Nepal and may be expected to increase the traffic with that State. Communications by road are not good. Out of 682 miles, only 113 are metalled. The metalled roads are in charge of the Public Works department; but the cost of all but 62 miles is charged to Local funds. The main lines are those from Gorakhpur to Fyzabad, from Basti town to Bansli, and from Uska towards the Nepal frontier. Bridges are still required on most of the unmetalled roads, which cross\nmany small streams by fords and ferries. Avenues of trees are main-\ntained on 127 miles of road.\n\nMention of the famines experienced in Basti District up to 1865,\nwhen it became a separate Collectorate, will be found in the article\non Gorakhpur District. In 1868\u20139 only slight\nFamine. scarcity was felt. The rains of 1873 were light and\nthe following spring crop could not be sown. Relief works were opened,\nand in May, 1874, the daily muster rose to 127,000; but it was held\nafterwards that relief had been too lavish. A similar failure of the\nrains in 1877 caused distress in 1878, and relief works were again\nrequired. In 1896\u20137 distress was felt; but this was due to the pressure\nof high prices on the labouring classes rather than to a failure of\nthe crops. Relief works were opened, but the proportion of the popu-\nlation who came to them was small.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by five Deputy-Collectors recruited\nin India, and a tahsildar is stationed at the head-\nquarters of each tahsil.\n\nThere are two District Munsifs, and the system of Village Munsifs\nwas introduced in 1902. Basti is comprised within the Civil and\nSessions Judgeship of Gorakhpur; but sessions cases are tried by the\nJudge of Jaunpur, who is a Joint Sessions Judge for this purpose.\nCrime is on the whole light, and the District is not noted for any\nparticular form. Infanticide was formerly suspected, but no villages\nare now proclaimed under the Act.\n\nBasti was acquired by cession in 1801, but up to 1865 it formed\npart of Gorakhpur District. The quarrels of the Rajas and the failure\nof the Oudh government to introduce any system of administration had\nreduced the country to a miserable state. The early settlements, based\nchiefly on the previous collections, were for short periods, and at first\nwere made with the Rajas or large proprietors at lump sums for whole\nestates. In 1838\u20139 the first regular settlement was made under Regu-\nlation IX of 1833. It was based on a survey, and it recognized the\nbirtias or under-proprietors, from whom engagements were taken direct\nfor the first time. The revenue fixed was 9\u00b77 lakhs, which was more\nthan double the former revenue. This settlement was revised between\n1859 and 1865 by various officers working on different methods, but\nprincipally relying on estimates of the rental \u2018assets,\u2019 and the demand\nwas increased to 12\u00b78 lakhs. The latest revision was made between\n1883 and 1890, and Basti was one of the first Districts to be resettled\non the basis of the actual rents paid. The revenue demand amounted\nto 19\u00b74 lakhs, or 46 per cent. of the corrected rent-roll, the incidence\nper acre being Rs. 1\u00b71, varying from Rs. 0\u00b78 to Rs. 1\u00b77.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources\nhave been, in thousands of rupees:\u2014\nThere are no municipalities, but three towns are administered under Act XX of 1856. Beyond the limits of these, local affairs are administered by the District board, which in 1903-4 had an income of 1.6 lakhs, chiefly derived from local rates. The expenditure was also 1.6 lakhs, including Rs. 92,000 spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police is assisted by 4 inspectors, and has a force of 97 subordinate officers and 378 constables, besides 52 town police and 3,201 rural and road police. There are 26 police stations. The District jail had a daily average of 247 prisoners in 1903.\n\nThe District contains few towns, and the proportion of literate persons is not very high; only 2.8 per cent. (5.5 males and 0.1 females) could read and write in 1901. Hindus (3 per cent.) were better educated than Musalmans (2 per cent.). The number of public schools increased from 154 with 5,037 pupils in 1880-1 to 290 with 11,286 pupils in 1900-1. In 1903-4 there were 308 such schools with 16,844 pupils, including 426 girls, besides 36 private schools with 459 pupils. The primary classes contained all but 1,400 pupils in both public and private schools. Two schools are managed by Government and 135 by the District board. Out of a total expenditure on education of Rs. 46,000, Local funds supplied Rs. 42,000, and the receipts from fees were only Rs. 3,800.\n\nThere are 8 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 51 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 90,000, including 417 in-patients, and 3,562 operations were performed. The expenditure in the same year amounted to Rs. 26,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nAbout 50,000 persons were successfully vaccinated in 1903-4, giving a proportion of 27 per 1,000 of population, which is below the Provincial average.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1881, under revision); J. Hooper, Settlement Report (1891).]\n\nBasti Tahsil.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Basti District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Nagar (East), Basti (East), Maghar (West), and Mahuli (West), and lying between 26\u00b0 33' and 27\u00b0 6' N. and 82\u00b0 37' and 82\u00b0 59' E., with an area of 536 square miles. Population increased from 377,935 in 1891 to 393,079 in 1901. There are 1,600 villages and only one town, Basti (population, 14,761), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4\nwas Rs. 4,22,000, and for cesses Rs. 78,000. The density of population, 733 persons per square mile, is the highest in the District. The tahsil stretches north from the Gogra in the upland portion of the District, and is crossed by the Kuw\u0101n\u0101 and a number of smaller streams. The area under cultivation in 1903-4 was 387 square miles, of which 238 were irrigated. Wells supply more than half the irrigated area, and tanks and swamps are a more important source than rivers.\n\n**Basti Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of Bast\u012b District and tahsil, United Provinces, situated in 26\u00b0 47' N. and 82\u00b0 43' E., on the Bengal and North-Western Railway and on the Gorakhpur-Fyz\u0101b\u0101d road. Population (1901), 14,761. The town became the residence of a local R\u0101j\u0101 in the seventeenth century, but was never of importance. For some time before the Mutiny it was the site of an opium storehouse and treasury, and in 1865 it became the head-quarters of a new District. Basti consists of the old village, in which the R\u0101j\u0101's fort is situated, a new bazar which has sprung up on the road south of this, and the civil station. It is the head-quarters of the Church Missionary Society in the District, which maintains the high school; and besides the usual offices there is a dispensary. The town is administered under Act XX of 1856, with an income of about Rs. 4,000. There is little trade. Two schools for boys contain 330 pupils, and a small girls' school has an attendance of 15.\n\n**Baswa.**\u2014Head-quarters of the tahsil of the same name in the Daosa niz\u0101mat of the State of Jaipur, Rajput\u0101na, situated in 27\u00b0 9' N. and 76\u00b0 36' E., on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway, 63 miles east-by-north-east of Jaipur city and 128 miles south of Delhi. Population (1901), 5,908. The mud walls which surround the town are breached in several places, and the small fort is in a dilapidated condition. The town possesses a post office, and three schools attended by about 160 boys. A fair, held yearly in April near the railway station, is visited by 7,000 to 8,000 Muhammadans. The town is locally famous for its red and black terra-cotta pottery; and in its neighbourhood are some very old palaces, a reservoir, and a temple attributed to a R\u0101j\u0101 named Har Chand.\n\n**Bat\u0101la Tahsil.**\u2014Tahsil of Gurd\u0101spur District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 35' and 32\u00b0 4' N. and 74\u00b0 52' and 75\u00b0 34' E., with an area of 476 square miles. It stretches south-east and north-west between the R\u0101vi and the Be\u0101s, and consists of strips of alluvial country along these two rivers, with a fertile plateau between them irrigated by the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b Canal and the Kiran (District) Canal. The population in 1901 was 305,867, compared with 300,644 in 1891. The head-quarters are at the town of Bat\u0101la (population, 27,365). It also contains the towns of Sr\u012bgobindpur (4,380) and Dera N\u0101nak (5,118); and 478\nvillages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 5,51,000.\n\n**Bat\u0101la Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the *tahsil* of the same name in Gurd\u0101spur District, Punjab, situated in 30\u00b0 49' N. and 75\u00b0 12' E., on the Amritsar-Path\u0101nkot branch of the North-Western Railway, 20 miles from Gurd\u0101spur town. It is distant by rail 1,272 miles from Calcutta, 1,303 from Bombay, and 859 from Kar\u0101chi. Population (1901), 27,365, including 17,876 Muhammadans and 9,071 Hindus. The town was founded about 1465, during the reign of Bahlol Lod\u012b, by Rai R\u0101m Deo, a Bhatti R\u0101jput, on a piece of land granted by T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, governor of Lahore. Akbar gave it in *j\u0101g\u012br* to Shamsher Kh\u0101n, his foster-brother, who greatly improved and beautified the place, and outside it built the magnificent tank, still in perfect repair. Under the Sikh commonwealth, Bat\u0101la was held first by the R\u0101mgarhias, and after their expulsion by the Kanhay\u0101 confederacy. On their return from exile the R\u0101mgarhia chiefs recovered the town, which they retained till the rise of Ranjit Singh. After the annexation of the Punjab, Bat\u0101la was made the head-quarters of a District, subsequently transferred to Gurd\u0101spur. The principal objects of antiquarian interest are the tank above mentioned, the massive tomb of Shamsher Kh\u0101n, and a handsome building known as the An\u0101rkali, erected by Sher Singh, son of Ranjit Singh, who held Bat\u0101la in *j\u0101g\u012br*. This is now occupied by the Baring high school. The central portion of the town is raised to some height above the surrounding level, and has well-paved streets, good drainage, and substantial brick-built houses; but its suburbs consist of squalid mud huts, occupied by Gujar shepherds and low-caste weavers, where filth accumulates to the great detriment of the general health.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1867. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 34,900, and the expenditure Rs. 34,100. The income in 1903-4 was Rs. 37,900, chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 38,500. The town has considerable manufactures, which include cotton, silk, and leathern goods. *S\u012bs\u012b*, a striped mixture of silk and cotton, used to be very largely made, but the manufacture has now been superseded by that of chintz. Carpets and woollen blankets are also woven. Soap is manufactured, and a good deal of cotton is ginned. Bat\u0101la has a large trade in grain and sugar, which, however, are bought and sold at a mart outside municipal limits. Its chief educational institutions are the Baring Anglo-vernacular high school for Christian boys and the A.I.O.E. Anglo-vernacular high school, both maintained by the Church Missionary Society, and two Anglo-vernacular middle schools, one maintained by the municipal committee and the other unaided. The municipality, aided by the District board, also supports two dispensaries.\n\n**Batesar.**\u2014Village in the Bah *tahsil* of Agra District, United Pro-\nvines, situated in $26^\\circ 56' N.$ and $78^\\circ 33' E.$, at a bend of the Jumna, 41 miles south-east of Agra city. Population (1901), 2,189. The place is celebrated for its fair, the largest in the District. Originally this was a religious festival, the great day being on the full moon of K\u0101rtik (October-November), but it is now also celebrated as a cattle fair. Horses, cattle, camels, and even elephants are exhibited, and remounts for the native army and police are often bought here. For convenience, a branch Government treasury is opened at the time of the fair. In 1904 the stock shown included 35,000 horses and ponies, 18,000 camels, 10,000 mules and donkeys, and 79,000 head of cattle; and Rs. 13,000 was collected on account of bridge tolls, registration fees, and shop rents.\n\n**Baud State.**\u2014The most westerly of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between $20^\\circ 13'$ and $20^\\circ 53' N.$ and $83^\\circ 35'$ and $84^\\circ 48' E.$, with an area of 1,264 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Mah\u0101nadi river, separating it from Sonpur and Athmallik; on the east by Daspall\u0101; on the south by the Khondm\u0101ls; and on the west by Patn\u0101 and Sonpur, from which it is separated by the Tel river.\n\nThe State is one of the oldest in Orissa, and is said to have been originally founded by a Br\u0101hman, but he being childless adopted a nephew of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Keonjhar, who is regarded as the founder of the present family. The list of chiefs contains forty-five names, who are said to have ruled for nearly 1,400 years. The State was formerly of considerable extent, but from time to time portions were wrested from it by more powerful neighbours, and Athmallik, which was for centuries part of Baud and acknowledged its suzerainty, is now quite separate. The large tract known as the Khondm\u0101ls, with an area of about 800 square miles, which originally belonged to Baud, was made over to the British Government in 1835 by the chief, who was unable to control the Khonds or to put a stop to their human sacrifices; and it was in 1891 formed into a subdivision of Angul District. The State as now constituted yields an estimated revenue of Rs. 64,000, and pays to the British Government a tribute of Rs. 800. The population decreased from 89,551 in 1891 to 88,250 in 1901. The falling off is due, as in the case of the Khondm\u0101ls, partly to the prevalence of epidemic disease and the general unhealthiness of the climate, and partly to the emigration of many migratory Khonds during the scarcity which occurred in 1900. The number of villages is 1,070, and the density is 70 persons per square mile. Of the total population, 87,988 claim to be Hindus, but many of them are really Hinduized aborigines. The most numerous castes are the Gours (23,000), Khonds (15,000), P\u0101ns (9,000), Sudh\u0101s (7,000), and Ch\u0101sas (4,000). The Khonds (*see* Khondm\u0101ls) are giving up their primitive customs and beliefs, and endeavouring to amalgamate with their Hindu neighbours. The land is fertile and is\nwell provided with wells, reservoirs, and other sources of irrigation. The Mah\u0101nadi, which forms the northern boundary of the State, and the Tel, which borders it on its west, afford excellent facilities for water-carriage; and rice, oilseeds, and such cereals as are produced in the State are exported in large quantities by boat down the Mah\u0101nadi. The State maintains a charitable dispensary, a middle English school, and 4 upper primary and 16 lower primary schools.\n\n**Baud Village.**\u2014Chief place of the Orissa Tributary State of the same name, Bengal, situated in $20^\\circ 50' N.$ and $84^\\circ 23' E.$, on the right bank of the Mah\u0101nadi. Population (1901), 3,292. The village contains several ancient temples. The most important are the Nabagraha temple, built of red sandstone, very profusely carved, and probably dating from the ninth century; and three temples of Siva with elaborately carved interiors.\n\n*[Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. xiii, pp. 118\u20139.]*\n\n**Baugh.**\u2014Archaeological site in Central India. *See B\u0101gh.*\n\n**Bauli\u0101ri.**\u2014Scaport in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, Bombay. *See Bavljari.*\n\n**Baura.**\u2014Village in the head-quarters subdivision of Jalpaiguri District, Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated in $26^\\circ 15' N.$ and $89^\\circ 5' E.$, on a small tributary of the Tista. Baura can be reached by boats of 30 or 40 tons burden all the year round, and is the principal river mart in the District, whence large quantities of tobacco, mustard seed, jute, cotton, and hides are exported by water to Sirajganj and Dacca. Baura is also served by the Bengal-Du\u0101rs Railway. The population in 1901 is not known. It was included for census purposes in manza Sibr\u0101m, the population of which was 5,157.\n\n**Bausi.** Village in the B\u0101nka subdivision of Bh\u0101galpur District, Bengal, situated in $24^\\circ 48' N.$ and $87^\\circ 2' E.$, near the base of Mand\u0101rgiri. Population (1901), 649. The numerous buildings, tanks, large wells, and stone figures found for a mile or two round the base of the hill show that a great city must once have stood here. The people of the neighbourhood say that it contained 52 markets, 53 streets, and 88 tanks. According to local tradition, a large building, the ruins of which still exist, and the walls of which contain an immense number of small holes, evidently intended to hold ch\u012br\u0101gs, or small native lamps, was formerly illuminated on the night of the Dew\u0101li festival by a hundred thousand of these lights, each householder being allowed to supply only one. How or when the city fell into ruin is not known, though popular tradition ascribes its destruction to K\u0101la P\u0101h\u0101r. A Sanskrit inscription on a stone triumphal arch seems to show that the city was in existence less than 300 years ago. After the destruction of the temple of Madhus\u016bdan on Mand\u0101rgiri hill, the image of the god was brought to Bausi, where it now remains. Once a year, on the Paus Sankr\u0101nti day, the image is carried from Bausi to the foot of the hill,\nand is swung on the triumphal arch. About 50,000 pilgrims assemble from all parts of the country, in order to bathe in the sacred tank at the foot of the hill, and a fair is held which lasts for fifteen days.\n\n**B\u0101vda (B\u0101vada).**\u2014Petty chiefship feudatory to the Kolhapur State, within the Political Agency of Kolhapur and the Southern Marath\u0101 Country, Bombay, lying between $16^\\circ 25'$ and $16^\\circ 44'$ N. and $73^\\circ 52'$ and $74^\\circ 8'$ E. *See Kolhapur State.*\n\n**B\u0101visi Th\u0101na.**\u2014Petty State in Mah\u012b K\u0101nth\u0101, Bombay.\n\n**Bavliari.**\u2014Seaport on the creek of the same name, in the Dhan-dhuka taluka of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d District, Bombay, situated in $22^\\circ 4'$ N. and $72^\\circ 7'$ E. Population (1901), 980. In 1903\u20134 the imports and exports were each valued at 8 lakhs, the chief articles of trade being cotton, grain, gh\u012b, piece-goods, coco-nuts, oil, molasses, and timber.\n\n**Baw.**\u2014One of the Southern Shan States, Burma. *See Maw.*\n\n**B\u0101wal Niz\u0101mat.**\u2014A niz\u0101mat or administrative district of the N\u0101bha State, Punjab, lying between $28^\\circ$ and $28^\\circ 25'$ N. and $76^\\circ 15'$ and $76^\\circ 45'$ E., with an area of 281 miles. The population in 1901 was 71,430, compared with 68,147 in 1891. It contains one town, B\u0101wal (population, 5,739), the head-quarters; and 164 villages. The land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903\u20134 to 2.2 lakhs. The niz\u0101mat consists of three separate pieces of territory: B\u0101wal proper, Kanti-Kalina, and the isolated village of Mukandpur Basi. B\u0101wal proper lies south of Rew\u0101ri, a tahsil of the British District of Gurgaon, and forms a wedge jutting southwards into the Alwar and Jaipur States of R\u0101jput\u0101na. It is separated by the Rew\u0101ri tahsil from the pargana of Kanti-Kalina, 21 miles long by $9\\frac{1}{2}$ broad, lying parallel to the Narnaul niz\u0101mat of the Pati\u0101la State. The whole niz\u0101mat is geographically a part of the R\u0101jput\u0101na desert, being an arid, rainless tract, singularly destitute of trees, streams, and tanks, though the S\u0101wi, a seasonal torrent which rises in the Jaipur hills, passes through the southern edge of the B\u0101wal pargana. It is divided into the two police circles of B\u0101wal K\u0101nti and Chauki Deb-Kal\u0101n.\n\n**B\u0101wal Town.**\u2014Head-quarters of the niz\u0101mat of the same name in N\u0101bha State, Punjab, situated in $28^\\circ 4'$ N. and $76^\\circ 36'$ E., 10 miles south of Rew\u0101ri. Population (1901), 5,739. Founded in 1205 by Rao Misw\u0101la, Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jput of Alwar, it eventually came under the Naw\u0101bs of Jhajjar and then passed to N\u0101bha. It has since greatly developed, though its trade suffers from competition with Rew\u0101ri. It contains several old buildings, the most interesting of which is a mosque built in 1560 and still in good repair. It possesses a police station, an Anglo-vernacular middle school, and a dispensary.\n\n**B\u0101wa Malang.**\u2014Hill fortress in Th\u0101na District, Bombay. *See Malanggarh.*\n\n**Bawlake.**\u2014One of the Karenni States, Burma.\nBawnin.\u2014Burmese name for one of the Southern Shan States, Burma.

See Buxar.\n\nBayan\u0101.\u2014Head-quarters of a tahsil of the same name in the State of Bharatpur, Rajputana, situated in 26\u00b0 55' N. and 77\u00b0 18' E., close to the left bank of the Gambhir river, a tributary of the Banganga, and about 25 miles south-by-south-west of Bharatpur city. Population (1901), 6,867. The town contains a vernacular school, attended by 150 boys, and a hospital. The ancient name of the place was Sripath\u0101. Two old Hindu temples were, till recently, used by the Musalmans as mosques, and each has a Sanskrit inscription. One of them, bearing date A.D. 1043, mentions a J\u0101don R\u0101j\u0101, Bijai P\u0101l, to whom is unanimously attributed the building of the well-known fort of Bijaigarh, which is situated on an eminence about 2 miles to the south-west, and is shown in all maps under the name of Badalgarh Kot. There are several old temples and remains in this fort; but the chief object of interest is a red sandstone pillar (l\u0101t) bearing an inscription of the Varika king, Vishnuvardhana, a tributary of Samudra Gupta, dated in A.D. 372. Bijai P\u0101l, whose descendants rule at Karauli, is said to have been killed about the middle of the eleventh century in a battle with Mas\u016bd S\u0101l\u0101r, a nephew of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni, when the fort was taken. It was soon after recovered by the R\u0101jputs, only, however, to be again stormed successfully by Abu Bakr, Kandah\u0101ri, whose tomb is still pointed out in the vicinity. Thenceforward, it seems to have been held by whatever dynasty ruled at Delhi. Muhammad Ghor\u012b took it in 1196 and Sikandar Lodi in 1492. Babar, writing in 1526, describes the fort as one of the most famous in India, and his son Hum\u0101y\u016bn took it from the Lod\u012bs in 1535. Bayan\u0101 is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u012b as having in former times been the capital of a province of which Agra was but a dependent village. It possessed a large fort containing many buildings and subterranean caverns, also a very high tower. The mangoes, some of which weighed above 2 lb., were excellent, and the place was famous for its very white sugar and its indigo, the latter selling at from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a maund.\n\n[Indian Antiquary, vols. xiv and xv; J. F. Fleet, Gupta Inscriptions, p. 253.]\n\n1 As much as 3,562 'great maunds of Indicoe Byana,' valued at 278,673 mahm\u016bdis (say \u00a314,000), was consigned to England in the Royal Anne, the ship which brought home Sir Thomas Roe in 1619.\nB\u0101z\u0101r.\u2014Valley in the Khyber Political Agency, North-West Frontier Province, running east and west between the Surghar range on the south, the Il\u0101cha Ghar or eastern extension of the Safed Koh on the east, and the Turo Sar range to the north, between $35^\\circ 38'$ and $35^\\circ N.$ and $70^\\circ 37'$ and $71^\\circ E.$ Its elevation ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 feet, and that of the enclosing hills from 5,000 to 7,000 feet. The valley is sterile in the extreme, save where the village lands are irrigated from the hill streams. The people are Afridis of the notorious Zakka Khel or clan, the most active thieves on the frontier, against whom on three occasions punitive expeditions have been sent. In 1878 their attacks on the line of communications in the Khyber during the second Afghan War compelled a punitive expedition. Major Cavagnari led an armed body of Kuki Khel Afridis, supported by guns, against them, and inflicted some punishment; but a regular expedition followed in December, which effectively chastised them at small cost of life. Nevertheless the clan continued to give trouble, and another expedition had to be sent into the valley in 1879, after which the clan submitted. In 1897 two columns under Sir William Lockhart entered the valley by the Chora and Il\u0101cha passes at its eastern extremity, and destroyed the principal villages.\n\nBe\u0101s (Hyphasis of the Greeks; Arjikuja of the Vedas; Sanskrit, Vip\u0101sa).\u2014One of the \u2018five rivers\u2019 of the Punjab from which the Province derives its name. Rising on the southern face of the Rohtang pass in Kul\u016b, 13,326 feet above the sea, the Be\u0101s traverses the State of Mandi and enters Kangra District at Sanghol, 1,920 feet above sea-level. During the early part of its course the fall averages 125 feet per mile. A fine suspension bridge spans the river at Mand\u012b town, and a bridge of boats is kept up during the cold season at Dera Gopipur in Kangra District. During its lower hill course the Be\u0101s is crossed by numerous ferries, at many of which the means of communication consists of inflated skins (durais). Lower down it meanders in a westerly course through hilly country, with a fall of 7 feet to the mile, and forms the main channel for the drainage of Kangra. Near Reh in that District it divides into three channels, which reunite after passing Mirthal, 1,000 feet above sea-level. On meeting the Siw\u0101lik Hills in Hoshiarpur, the river sweeps sharply northward, forming the boundary between that District and Kangra. Then bending round the base of the Siw\u0101liks, it takes a southerly direction, separating the Districts of Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur. In this portion of its course through the uplands of the Punjab plains, a strip of low alluvial soil fringes its banks, subject in flood-time to inundation from the central stream. The main channel is broad and ill-defined, full of islands and expanding from time to time into wide pools. The depth does not exceed 5 feet in the dry season, increasing to 15 feet during the rains. Broad flat-bottomed country\nboats navigate this portion of the stream throughout the year. No bridges span the Be\u0101s in the Districts of Hoshiarpur or Gurdaspur. After touching Jullundur District for a few miles, the river forms the boundary between Amritsar and the Kap\u016brthala State. At Be\u0101s station it is crossed by a railway bridge on the North-Western Railway; and a bridge of boats on the grand trunk road is also maintained there during the cold season. The channel shifts from year to year through the alluvial valley according to the action of the floods. Finally, the Be\u0101s joins the Sutlej at the south-western boundary of the Kap\u016brthala State, after a total course of 290 miles. It ranks sixth in size among the rivers of the Punjab.\n\nThe chief tributaries are the Chakki and the Bein. The Chakki collects the drainage of the Chamba hills and its main stream joins the Be\u0101s near Mirthal, while the other branch, formerly a tributary of the R\u0101vi, has been turned aside by the B\u0101ri Do\u0101b Canal and forced to return to the Be\u0101s lower down. The Bein\u2014called the 'Black' (S\u012bv\u0101h) Bein to distinguish it from the 'White' (Safed) Bein rises in the Siwaliks, and joins the Be\u0101s 10 miles above its junction with the Sutlej.\n\nThe old course of the Be\u0101s can be traced from its present point of junction with the Sutlej through Lahore and Montgomery Districts to the place where it used to join the Chen\u0101b, near Shuj\u0101b\u0101d, before the Chen\u0101b turned westwards. The united waters of the Jhelum, Chen\u0101b, and R\u0101vi joined the Be\u0101s in those days 28 miles south of Mult\u0101n. Since the end of the eighteenth century the course of the Be\u0101s has changed but little.\n\nBeauleah.\u2014Head-quarters of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi District, Eastern Bengal and Assam. See R\u0100MPUR BO\u0100LI\u0100.\n\nBe\u0101war (also called Nay\u0101nagar).\u2014Head-quarters of Merw\u0101ra District, Ajmer-Merw\u0101ra, situated in 26\u00b0 5' N. and 74\u00b0 19' E. Population (1901), 21,928: including Hindus, 15,547; Muhammadans, 3,947; and Jains, 2,094. Founded in 1835 by Colonel Dixon, afterwards Commissioner of Ajmer-Merw\u0101ra, in the neighbourhood of a now abandoned cantonment, Be\u0101war rapidly grew into a prosperous town, owing to its advantageous position between Mew\u0101r (Udaipur) and M\u0101rw\u0101r (Jodhpur). The town, which has wide streets and a surrounding stone wall with four gates, was regularly planned out from the beginning, and sites were allotted to traders who applied for shops. Be\u0101war is the only town in Merw\u0101ra District, and is a station on the main line of the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. The municipal income in 1902\u20133 was about Rs. 60,000. Be\u0101war is the chief cotton mart for Merw\u0101ra and the contiguous Native States of Mew\u0101r and M\u0101rw\u0101r, and possesses a flourishing cotton-mill. The United Free Church of Scotland has a mission establishment, and maintains an industrial school.\nBechr\u0101ji.\u2014Temple in the Kadi pr\u0101nt, Baroda State, situated about 23 miles from the town of Kadi, and about the same distance from Modhera. The temple has been built in the jungle, and is surrounded by large and costly works designed for the accommodation of pilgrims and others\u2014wells, tanks, dharmas\u0101las, dispensary, &c. In the months of Aswin (September\u2013October) and Chaitra (March\u2013April) crowds of devotees visit the shrine from all parts of Gujar\u0101t and make their offerings to the goddess. From these offerings and from the rich endowments given by former Gaikw\u0101rs the expenses of the temple are met.\n\nBedadan\u016bru Coal-field.\u2014Bedadan\u016bru is a hamlet in the Polavaram minor t\u0101luk of God\u0101vari District, Madras, situated in $17^\\circ 15'$ N. and $81^\\circ 14'$ E., about 10 miles from Jangareddigudem on the Ellore-Prakkilanka road. It is the centre of a small coal-field, where the Bar\u0101kar stage of sandstone outcrops over an area of about $5\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles. This is the only coal-field lying entirely within the Madras Presidency; but though prospecting has been carried on for some years, no paying seam has as yet been discovered.\n\nBedla.\u2014Principal town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $24^\\circ 38'$ N. and $73^\\circ 42'$ E., on the left bank of the Ah\u0101r stream, about 4 miles north of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 1,222. It contains a mission school attended by 30 boys. The estate is held by the second noble of Mew\u0101r, who is styled Rao. It consists of 111 villages, the majority of which are situated to the north of Chitor; among them is Nagari, one of the oldest places in R\u0101jput\u0101na and mentioned in the article on Chitor. The income is about Rs. 64,000, and a tribute of Rs. 4,100 is paid to the Darb\u0101r. The Raos of Bedla are Chauh\u0101n R\u0101jputs, and claim direct descent from Prithwi R\u0101j, the last Hindu king of Delhi. Bakht Singh, the great-grandfather of the present Rao, brought the European residents of Nimach from D\u016bngla to Udaipur during the Mutiny of 1857, by the order of Mah\u0101r\u0101n\u0101 Sar\u016bp Singh. For these services he received a sword of honour and was subsequently created a Rao Bah\u0101dur and a C.I.E.\n\nBednor.\u2014Estate and head-quarters thereof in Udaipur State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. See Badnor.\n\nBedsa.\u2014Village in the M\u0101val t\u0101luka of Poona District, Bombay, 5 miles south-west of Khadk\u0101la station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which gives its name to a group of caves of the first century A.D. Population (1901), 171. The caves lie in $18^\\circ 43'$ N. and $73^\\circ 35'$ E., in the Supati hills, which rise above Bedsa village to a height of about 300 feet above the plain, and 2,250 feet above sea-level. The two chief caves are a chapel or chaitya and a dwelling cave or layana, both of them imitating wooden buildings in style. The chapel is approached by a narrow passage 40 feet long between two blocks of rock about\n18 feet high. A passage 5 feet wide has been cleared between the blocks and the front of two massive octagonal columns and two demi-columns which support the entablature at a height of about 25 feet. The veranda or porch within the pillars is nearly 12 feet wide, and 30 feet 2 inches long. Two benched cells project into it from the back corners and one from the front, with, over the door, an inscription in one line recording: 'The gift of Pushyanaka, son of Ananda Shethi, from N\u0101sik.' The corresponding cell in the opposite end is unfinished. Along the base and from the levels of the lintels of the cell doors upwards the porch walls are covered with the rail pattern on flat and curved surfaces, intermixed with the chaitya window ornaments, but without any animal or human representations. This and the entire absence of any figure of Buddha point to the early or Hinayana style of about the first century after Christ. The d\u0101goba or relic shrine has a broad fillet or rail ornament at the base and top of the cylinder, from which rises a second and shorter cylinder also surrounded above with the rail ornament. The box of the capital is small and is surmounted by a very heavy capital in which, out of a lotus bud, rises the wooden shaft of the umbrella. The top of the umbrella has disappeared. The relic shrine is now daubed in front with red lead and worshipped as Dharmar\u0101j's dhera or resting-place. There is a well near the entrance, and about twenty paces away stands a large unfinished cell containing a cistern. Over the latter is an inscription in three lines of tolerably clear letters which records: 'The religious gift of Mah\u0101bhoja's daughter S\u0101madinik\u0101, the Mah\u0101dev\u012b Mah\u0101rathini and wife of Apadevanaka.' This inscription is of very great interest, being one of the earliest mentions of the term Mah\u0101ratha yet discovered. A relic shrine or d\u0101goba lies a short distance from the chapel cave and also bears a short inscription.\n\nBeehea.\u2014Village in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District, Bengal. See BIHIY\u0100.\n\nBeerbhoom.\u2014District in Bengal. See B\u012aRBH\u016aM.\n\nBegampur.\u2014Village in the Shol\u0101pur taluka of Shol\u0101pur District, Bombay, situated in 17\u00b0 34' N. and 75\u00b0 37' E., on the left bank of the Bhima river, about 25 miles south-west of Shol\u0101pur city. Population (1901), 2,304. The place takes its name from one of Aurangzeb's daughters, who died while her father was encamped at Brahmapuri on the opposite bank of the river. She was buried at this place, and her tomb is a plain solid structure in a courtyard 180 feet square. It overhangs the Bhima, from which it is guarded by a strong masonry wall now much out of repair. Round the tomb a market slowly sprang up, with the result that the suburb of Begampur outgrew the original village of Ghadeshwar, from which it is separated by a water-course. About Rs. 40,000 worth of thread, cloth, and grain change hands every year at the weekly market on Thursday. The village has\na little manufacture of coarse cotton cloth or kh\u0101di. It contains a primary school.\n\n**Beg\u0101ri Canal.**\u2014An important water-channel in the Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind, Bombay. It taps the Indus at its extreme south-eastern boundary, forming for about 50 miles of its course a well-defined line of demarcation between the Frontier District and Sukkur. In 1851 this canal was at its head only 50 feet wide, with a depth of 9 feet. It was enlarged in 1854, when the water was admitted into it from the Indus and reached Jacob\u0101b\u0101d, 50 miles distant, in sixteen hours. Subsequently, the tail of the canal was enlarged, and extended farther westward. Several improvements have been carried out during the last few years. The entire length of the main canal is 76 miles, and it serves the Districts of Upper Sind Frontier (202 square miles), Sukkur (46 square miles), Kal\u0101t (43 square miles), and L\u0101rkh\u0101na (300 acres). About five canals branch directly from it, the principal being the Nur Wah (19 miles) and Mirz\u0101 (10 miles). The canal is also connected with the branches of the Gh\u0101r Canal. The aggregate cost of these works up to the end of 1903\u20134 amounted to 17 lakhs; the receipts in the same year were about 4\u00bd lakhs, and the total charges (exclusive of interest) over one lakh. The gross income was thus 26 per cent. on the capital expended and the net receipts 18\u00b73 per cent. The area irrigated was 495 square miles. The canal is navigable for about 60 miles.\n\n**Beg\u016bn.**\u2014Chief town of an estate of the same name in the State of Udaipur, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in 24\u00b0 59\u2032 N. and 75\u00b0 1\u2032 E., about 90 miles east-by-north-east of Udaipur city. Population (1901), 3,625, about 70 per cent. being Hindus. The town contains a picturesque palace and a fairly strong fort. The estate, which includes the town and 127 villages, belongs to one of the first-class nobles of Mew\u0101r, who is styled R\u0101wat Sawai. The income is about Rs. 48,000, and a tribute of about Rs. 5,200 is paid to the D\u0101rb\u0101r. The R\u0101wats of Beg\u016bn belong to the Chond\u0101wat family of the Sesodia R\u0101jputs. In the estate is the village of Men\u0101l, formerly called Mah\u0101n\u0101l or the \u2018great chasm,\u2019 which possesses a monastery and Sivaite temple constructed, according to the inscriptions they bear, in 1168 by the wife of the famous Prithvi R\u0101j Chauh\u0101n, whose name was Suhav Dev\u012b, alias R\u016bthi R\u0101n\u012b (\u2018the testy queen\u2019).\n\n**Begusarai Subdivision.**\u2014North-western subdivision of Monghyr District, Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 15\u2032 and 25\u00b0 47\u2032 N. and 85\u00b0 47\u2032 and 86\u00b0 27\u2032 E., with an area of 751 square miles. The population in 1901 was 642,966, compared with 611,349 in 1891. It contains 755 villages, but no town; the head-quarters are at Begusarai. The subdivision, which forms a continuation of the fertile alluvial plain of T\u012brhut, and supports 857 persons to the square mile, is the most densely\npopulated part of the District. The cultivation of indigo is carried on, but the industry is declining.\n\n**Begusarai Village.**\u2014Head-quarters of the subdivision of the same name in Monghyr District, Bengal, situated in $25^\\circ 26'$ N. and $86^\\circ 9'$ E. Population (1901), 9,338. The village contains the usual public offices; the sub-jail has accommodation for 28 prisoners.\n\n**Behar.**\u2014Subdivision and town in Patna District, Bengal. See BIHAR.\n\n**Behir.**\u2014Tahsil in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District, Central Provinces. See BAIHAR.\n\n**Behror.**\u2014Head-quarters of a tahsil of the same name in the State of Alwar, R\u0101jput\u0101na, situated in $27^\\circ 53'$ N. and $76^\\circ 17'$ E., about 32 miles north-west of Alwar city, and 18 miles west-by-south-west of Ajeraka station on the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 Railway. Population (1901), 5,540. The town possesses a mud fort about 50 yards square, a fair bazar, a post office, a vernacular school, and a hospital with accommodation for 6 in-patients. A municipal committee supervises the lighting and conservancy, the income, derived mainly from octroi, being about Rs. 2,200 and the expenditure Rs. 1,800. The tahsil, which contains 132 villages besides the town, is situated in the north-west of the State, and has a population of 71,082. More than 35 per cent. of the inhabitants are Ahirs, who are the best cultivators in the State. Under the Mughals this tract was included in the S\u016bbah of N\u0101rnau\u0142, but the real rulers were the local Chauh\u0101n chiefs. In the first half of the eighteenth century the J\u0101ts of Bharatpur overran it, but they were ousted before the end of that century by Prat\u0101p Singh, the first chief of Alwar.\n\n**Beji.**\u2014River in Baluchist\u0101n. See N\u0100RI.\n\n**Bekal.**\u2014Village in the K\u0101saragod taluk of South Kanara District, Madras, situated in $12^\\circ 24'$ N. and $75^\\circ 3'$ E. It has a fine fort on a headland facing the sea, which was built by Sivappa Naik of Bednur about the middle of the seventeenth century. The defences are said to show traces of European science. The surrounding tract is really part of the Malay\u0101lam country, and was at one time subject to the Chirakkal R\u0101j\u0101s. Bekal formerly gave its name to the present taluk of K\u0101saragod, but it is now of no importance.\n\n**Bela.**\u2014Capital of the Las Bela State, Baluchist\u0101n, and residence of the J\u0101m, situated in $26^\\circ 14'$ N. and $66^\\circ 19'$ E. It lies near the apex of the Las Bela plain, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from the Por\u0101li river and 116 miles from Kar\u0101chi. Population (1901), 4,183. The majority were State servants, but 356 Hindus were included. The town is not walled and consists of 400 or 500 huts. The J\u0101m\u2019s residence, a tahsil, a treasury, a jail, and lines for the military police are the principal buildings. The ancient name of the town was Arm\u0101el or Arm\u0101bel. Sir Robert Sandeman died at Bela in 1892, and was buried on the south of the\ntown. His tomb, of granite and white English marble, is placed beneath a dome erected by the J\u0101m, and is surrounded by a garden. A small establishment is maintained in the town for purposes of conservancy. Cotton cloth and rice constitute the principal imports; oilseeds, gh\u016b, and wool the exports. Bel\u0101 crochet-work is well-known.\n\nBel\u0101 (or Bel\u0101 Part\u0101bgarh).\u2014Head-quarters of Part\u0101bgarh District and tahsil, United Provinces, situated in $25\u00b0\\ 55' N.$ and $82\u00b0 E.$, on the bank of the Sai, at the junction of the main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway with a branch from Allah\u0101b\u0101d to Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, and on a road between the same two places. Population (1901), 8,041. The town derives its name from the temple of Bel\u0101 Bhaw\u0101n\u012b near the river. It was founded in 1802 as a cantonment for the Oudh auxiliary force, and after the Mutiny became the head-quarters of a District. The town is well laid out and has been thoroughly drained. Besides the usual offices, it contains a general dispensary and a magnificent female hospital, and there is a branch of the Zan\u0101na Bible and Medical Mission. Bel\u0101 has been a municipality since 1871. During the ten years ending 1901 the income and expenditure averaged Rs. 10,000. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 14,000, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 8,000) and fees and rents; and the expenditure was Rs. 16,000. There is a flourishing trade in agricultural produce. Three schools have 340 pupils.\n\nBelagutti.\u2014Town in the Honn\u0101l\u012b taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in $14\u00b0\\ 11' N.$ and $75\u00b0\\ 31' E.$, 10 miles south-west of Honn\u0101l\u012b town. Population (1901), 2,799. The original form of the name was Belagavatti. It was the seat of a line of N\u0101ga chiefs who called themselves Sindas. They ruled during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, under the Ch\u0101lukyas, Hoysalas, and Seunas. The place stands in a plain of fertile black soil.\n\nBel\u0101pur.\u2014Village in the R\u0101huri taluka of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay, situated in $19\u00b0\\ 34' N.$ and $74\u00b0\\ 39' E.$, 15 miles north of R\u0101huri, on the Dhond-Manm\u0101d Railway. Population (1901), 4,630, including Bel\u0101pur-Khurd (1,167). It lies on the north bank of the Pravara, which in floods rises to the gates. On the river-side are some picturesque buildings belonging to the Naiks, an old Mar\u0101th\u0101 family. The chief traders are Marw\u0101ri V\u0101nis and Telis. In 1822 an attempt was made to make Bel\u0101pur the centre of a revolt. Troops were to be collected here and at Nandurb\u0101r in Kh\u0101ndesh, and in conjunction with the local Kolis were to make a general attack upon the British posts. The plot was, however, discovered and quashed.\n\nBelg\u0101mi (or Balg\u0101mi).\u2014Village in the Shik\u0101rpur taluk of Shimoga District, Mysore, situated in $14\u00b0\\ 24' N.$ and $75\u00b0\\ 15' E.$, 14 miles north-west of Shik\u0101rpur. Population (1901), 1,330. Its name appears in inscriptions as Ballig\u0101mve, Balligr\u0101me, Balipura, and similar forms. Even\nin the twelfth century it was of such antiquity as to be styled the mother of cities, the capital of ancient cities, the immemorial capital, and is said to derive its name from the giant Bali. On account of its religious merit it was called the Dakshina Ked\u0101ra, and also had the name Kamatha. Under the Ch\u0101lukyas and Kalachuris it was the capital of the Banav\u0101si 'twelve thousand' province. It contained five maths, with temples dedicated to Vishnu, Siva, Brahm\u0101, Jina, and Buddha, and three puras, besides seven Brahmapuris. At the Kodiya math of the Ked\u0101resvara temple medicine and food were dispensed to all comers. Of eighty-four inscriptions in the place most are of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Its prosperity continued under the Hoysalas and Seunas, but the city no doubt fell a prey to the Muhammadan invaders of the fourteenth century who overthrew the Hoysala power. The ruined temples are rich with carving equal to any in Mysore.\n\nBelgaum District.\u2014District in the Southern Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between 15\u00b0 22' and 16\u00b0 58' N. and 74\u00b0 2' and 75\u00b0 25' E., with an area of 4,649 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the States of Mir\u0101j and Jath; on the north-east by Bij\u0101pur District; on the east by the States of Jamkhandi, Mudhol, Kolh\u0101pur, and R\u0101mdurg; on the south and south-west by the Districts of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r and North Kanara, the State of Kolh\u0101pur, and the Portuguese territory of Goa; and on the west by the States of S\u0101vantv\u0101di and Kolh\u0101pur. The lands of the District are greatly interlaced with those of the neighbouring Native States, and within the District are large tracts of Native territory.\n\nThe country forms a large plain, studded with solitary peaks and broken here and there by low ranges of hills. Many of the peaks are crowned by small but well-built forts. The lower hills are generally covered with brushwood, but in some cases their sides are carefully cultivated almost to the very summits. The most elevated portion of the District lies to the west and south along the line of the Saby\u0101dri Hills or Western Gh\u0101ts. The surface of the plain slopes with an almost imperceptible fall eastwards to the borders of Bij\u0101pur. On the north and east the District is open and well cultivated, but to the south it is intersected by spurs of the Gh\u0101ts, thickly covered in some places with forest. Except near the Western Gh\u0101ts, and in other places where broken by lines of low hills, the country is almost a dead level; but especially in the south, and along the banks of the large rivers, the surface is pleasantly varied by trees, solitary and in groups. From March to June the fields are bare; and but for the presence of the mango, tamarind, jack, and other trees, reared for their fruit, the aspect of the country would be desolate in the extreme.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Kistna, here properly called the Krishna, flowing through the north, the Ghatprabha, flowing through the centre,\nand the Malprabha, through the south of the District. From their sources among the spurs of the Western Gh\u0101ts, these rivers pass eastwards through the plain of Belgaum on their way to the Bay of Bengal. They are bordered by deeply cut banks, over which they seldom flow. None is serviceable for purposes of navigation. In the west the rivers and wells yield a sufficient supply of good water; but towards the east the wells become brackish, and the water-bearing strata lie far below the surface. Except the Kistna, which at all times maintains a considerable flow of water, the rivers sink into insignificant streams during the hot season, and the supply of water falls short of the wants of the people.\n\nIn the south of the District is a narrow strip of Archaean gneissic rock, including some hematite schists of the auriferous Dh\u0101rw\u0101r series. In the centre quartzite and limestone of the Kal\u0101dgi (Cuddapah) group are found partly overlaid by two great bands of basalt belonging to the Deccan trap system, and in the north and west basalt and laterite occur. Several of the river valleys contain ancient alluvial deposits of upper pliocene or pleistocene age, consisting of clay with partings and thin beds of impure grits and sandstones. In the banks of a stream that flows into the Ghatprabha at Chikdauli, 3 miles north-east of Gok\u0101k, were found some remarkable fossil remains of mammalia, including an extinct form of rhinoceros\u00b9.\n\nOf the typical trees of the District, m\u0101ti (Terminalia tomentosa), j\u0101mbul (Eugenia Jambolana), n\u0101na, harda, sisva, and hasan (Pterocarpus Marsupium) yield valuable timber; k\u0101rvi (Strobilanthus Grahamianus) and small bamboos are used for fencing and roofing, and kumba (Careya arborea) is in demand for the manufacture of field tools. The harda and hela (Terminalia belerica) furnish myrabolams, and the shemba (Acacia concinna) supplies the ritha or soap-nut which is used in cleaning clothes. The chief fruit trees are the mango, jack, custard-apple, bullock's-heart, cashew-nut, j\u0101mbul, bael, wood-apple, pummelo, sweet lime, citron, lime, orange, kokam, avla, bor, turan, guti, agasti, horseradish tree, guava, pomegranate, papai, karanda, fig, mulberry, plantain, and pineapple. Among creepers the most noticeable are several species of convolvulus; and a large number of English flowers have been grown from seeds and cuttings.\n\nAntelope are found in the north and east. S\u0101mbar, deer, wild hog, and hyenas are not uncommon in the waste and forest lands. Of the larger beasts of prey, leopards are pretty generally distributed, but tigers are met with only in the south and south-west. Of game-birds there are peafowl, partridge, quail, duck, snipe, teal, kalam, and occasionally bustard.\n\n\u00b9 R. B.

The most agreeable climate is found in a tract parallel with the crest of the Western Gh\u0101ts between the western forests and the treeless east. The cold and dry season lasts from mid-October to mid-February, the hot and dry season from mid-February to early June, and the wet season from early June to mid-October. The heat of April and May causes occasional heavy showers, attended with easterly winds, thunder, lightning, and sometimes hail. Even in May the nights are cool, almost chilly. Near the Gh\u0101ts the south-west monsoon is very constant and heavy. Farther east it is fitful, falling in showers separated by breaks of fair weather. The rainfall at the District head-quarters averages about 50 inches. In the east it is as low as 24, while in Chandgad in the extreme west 107 inches are registered. From March to September the prevailing winds are from the west and south, and from October to February from the east and north.\n\nThe oldest place in Belgaum is Halsi, which, according to seven copperplates found in its vicinity, was the capital of a dynasty of nine Kadamba kings. In all probability the Early (550\u2013610) and Western (610\u2013760) Ch\u0101lukyas held Belgaum in succession, yielding place about 760 to the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas, a trace of whose power survived till about 1250 in the Ratta Mahamandaleshwars (875\u20131250), whose capital was first Saundatti and subsequently (1210) Venugr\u0101ma, the modern Belgaum. Inscriptions discovered in various parts of the District show that during the twelfth and early years of the thirteenth centuries the Kadambas of Goa (980\u20131250) held part of the District known as the Halsi \u2018twelve thousand,\u2019 and the Venugr\u0101ma or Belgaum \u2018seventy.\u2019 The third Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana or Bitti Deva (1104\u201341), held the Halsi division for a time as the spoil of battle; but the territory of the Goa Kadambas as a whole had by 1208 been entirely absorbed by the Rattas. The last of the Rattas, Lakshmideva II, was overthrown about 1250 by Vichana, the minister and general of the Deogiri Y\u0101dava, Singhana II; and from that date up to their final defeat by the Delhi emperor in 1320, the Y\u0101davas seem to have been masters of Belgaum and surrounding tracts. During the brief overlordship of the Delhi emperors Belgaum was administered by two Musalm\u0101n nobles, posted at Hukeri and at R\u0101yb\u0101g. About the middle of the fourteenth century, the District was partitioned between the Hindu R\u0101j\u0101s of Vijayanagar, who held the portion south of the Ghatprabha, and the king of Delhi, who held that to the north. On the foundation of the Bahmani dynasty in 1347 the territories contained in the latter half fell under the sway of that dynasty, which subsequently, in 1473, took the town of Belgaum and conquered the southern division.\nalso. During the next hundred years the Vijayanagar R\u0101j\u0101s made numerous efforts to recover their territories, in which they were assisted by the Portuguese; but they failed to make any lasting conquests, and were completely overthrown in the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101 (1565). For the next hundred and twenty years Belgaum may be said to have remained part of the territories of the Bijapur Sult\u0101ns. On the overthrow of Bijapur at the hands of Aurangzeb in 1686, the District passed to the Mughals and was granted as a j\u0101g\u012br to the Naw\u0101b of Savanur, who subsequently had to relinquish a share to the Niz\u0101m. Some part of it, however, appears to have been in the hands of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. About 1776 the whole country was overrun by Haidar Al\u012b, but was subsequently retaken by the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Peshw\u0101 with the assistance of the British. In 1818, after a period of great disorder, during which the country was alternately harried by the troops belonging to Sindhia, Kolhapur, Nip\u0101ni, and other chiefs, the country passed to the British and became part of the District of Dh\u0101rw\u0101r; but in 1836 it was considered advisable to divide the unwieldy jurisdiction into two parts. The southern portion therefore continued to be known as Dh\u0101rw\u0101r, while the tract to the north was constituted a separate charge.\n\nCopperplate inscriptions have been discovered at Halsi. The District contains some hill forts, the chief of which are Mahipatgarh, Kalanidhgarh, and P\u0101rgarh. Scattered temples are ascribed to Jakha-n\u0101ch\u0101rya but are really Ch\u0101lukyan, a very fine one being found at Deg\u0101nve. There is an interesting group of prehistoric burial dolmens at Konn\u016br. Many temples dating from the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries are scattered over the District, of which nearly all were originally Jain but have been converted into lingam shrines. The most noteworthy are a group in Belgaum fort; those at Deg\u0101nve, Vakkund, and Nes\u0101rgi in Sampgaum; groups at Huli, Manoli, and Yellamma in Parasgad; those at Shankeshwar in Chikodi, and at R\u0101mt\u012brth and Nandgaon in Athni. The finest Musalm\u0101n remains are the fort and Safa mosque at Belgaum, and the mosques and tombs at Hukeri and Sampgaon.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1872 the population of the District was 946,702. The next Census of 1881 returned 865,922, showing a decrease of over 9 per cent., due to the famine in 1876. In 1891 the population increased to 1,013,261, but again fell in 1901 to 993,976, owing to the bad years of 1892, 1896, 1899, and 1900.\n\nThe table on the next page gives statistics according to the Census of 1901.\n\nThe Chikodi and Sampgaon t\u0101lukas contain many large and rich villages and are well peopled. The chief towns are Belgaum, the head-quarters, Nip\u0101ni, Athni, Gokak, and Saundatti-Yellamma.\nClassified according to religion, Hindus form 86 per cent. of the total population, Musalmans 8 per cent., Jains 5 per cent. Among Hindus the only special class are the Lingayats, a peculiar section of the worshippers of Siva, numbering over 300,000, of whom a description will be found under Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District. The languages in use are Marathi, mostly in the south and west, and Kanarese generally over the greater part of the District. The latter is spoken by 65 and the former by 25 per cent. of the total. Hindustani is used by 8 per cent.\n\n| Taluka | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1901 and 1911 | Number of persons alike to parent |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Athni  | 816                | 1              | 82       | 113,077    | 139                       | - 8                                             | 5,249                           |\n| Chikodi| 836                | 2              | 210      | 304,549    | 364                       | + 3                                             | 15,714                          |\n| Gokak  | 671                | 1              | 113      | 110,127    | 173                       | - 2                                             | 3,754                           |\n| Belgaum| 644                | 1              | 201      | 137,562    | 214                       | - 7                                             | 9,839                           |\n| Sampgaon| 499               | ...            | 123      | 132,448    | 324                       | - 1                                             | 6,031                           |\n| Parasgad| 640              | 1              | 124      | 108,311    | 169                       | - 2                                             | 6,839                           |\n| Khanapur| 633              | ...            | 217      | 81,902     | 129                       | - 4                                             | 3,457                           |\n| District total | 4,649 | 6              | 1,070    | 993,976    | 214                       | - 2                                             | 50,883                          |\n\nThe chief castes and their occupations are: Br\u0101hmans, or priests, numbering 32,000. They are for the most part Deshasths (23,000), and employed as writers, merchants, traders, money-lenders, and landowners. Ayyas or Jangams (24,000) are Lingayat priests. Traders include Banjigs (26,000) and Adi-banjigs (13,000). There are numerous Jain cultivators and labourers, indicating the former supremacy of the Jain religion in the Bombay Carnatic. Other cultivators are Marathas and Maratha Kunbis (175,000), Chhatris (9,000), Hanbars (15,000), and Lingayat Panchamsalis (154,000). Craftsmen include Panchals (15,000) and Gaundis or Uppars, builders and stone-cutters (14,000). Lingayat Hongars or Malgars (11,000) are flower-sellers. Shepherds include two shepherd castes, Dhangars or Kurubas (73,000), and Gaulis who keep cows and buffaloes. The depressed classes are chiefly the Holiars or Mahars (48,000) and Mangs or Madigs (22,000). Along the banks of the Kistna, in the north of the District, are many Kaikadis, a tribe notorious for their skill as highway robbers; while the south of the District was much troubled in recent times by Bedars or Berads, a thieving caste that assisted in the plundering of Vijayanagar after the battle of Talikot\u0101. The agricultural population forms 66 per cent. of the total. Industry supports 16 per cent. and commerce 1 per cent. Weavers engaged in the hand-loom industry number more than 13,000, with 11,000 dependents.\nThe District has a considerable Christian population. Of the 5,366 native Christians in 1901 about 5,000 were Roman Catholics. The majority are Konkani or Goa Catholics, who are immigrants from Goa, and are under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of that place. The others include Madras Catholics and Protestants, who came from Madras about 1817. The chief missions are an Anglican Tamil Mission and the American Methodist Mission, with out-stations at Kanbargi, Nesargi, and Bail Hongal. Roman Catholic priests are resident in Belgaum, Kh\u0101n\u0101pur, and Godoli; and there are two orphanages and a rescue home in the District, which are managed by independent trustees, but belong to the Methodist Episcopal Mission. A mission to soldiers, known as the Soldiers' Home, is situated in the cantonment.\n\nThe chief varieties of soil are black and red. The black, which is by far the most fertile, is of two kinds. One variety is very friable, but when impregnated with moisture forms a tough clay-like substance, almost impervious to water, and therefore very valuable as a lining for tanks. The other kind is not so tenacious of moisture, and, unless it receives abundance of irrigation, either natural or artificial, not nearly so productive. In order to bring a waste of black soil under tillage, the field must receive three complete ploughings\u2014one direct, one transverse, and one diagonal. It does not receive any further ploughing; but annually before sowing the ground is cleared and the surface loosened with a small knife. The red and sandy soils are very apt to cake and harden after rain, so that the field must be ploughed every year\u2014if possible, once lengthwise and a second time transversely. This is done by a smaller plough of the same construction as the large plough used for black fields, but lighter. Fields of pure black soil do not receive manure; on the other hand, the out-turn from red and sandy lands seems to depend almost entirely on the amount of dressing they have received.\n\nOn 'dry' fields, most of the grain, pulses, oilseeds, and fibres are sown; some are cultivated on red and sandy soils during the rainy months; others are grown on black soil as a cold-season crop. Cotton is raised entirely on black soil as a cold-season crop.\n\nThe District is almost wholly ryotw\u0101ri. In\u0101m or j\u0101g\u0101r lands cover 983 square miles. The chief statistics of cultivation in 1903\u20134 are shown in the table on the next page, in square miles.\n\nJow\u0101r, the staple of the District, occupying 884 square miles, is grown in all parts, especially in Chikodi, Athni, Gok\u0101k, Parasgad, and Sampgaon. B\u0101jra covered 297 square miles, chiefly in Athni, Gok\u0101k, and Chikodi. The south-western portion, being too wet for millets, produces rice (176 square miles) and the coarse hill grains. Wheat (157 square miles) is the prominent crop of Parasgad. R\u0101le-kang or Italian millet occupied 118 square miles. Pulses occupied 333 square\nmiles; of these, 92 square miles were under tur, 98 under kulith or horse-gram, and 62 square miles under gram. Oilseeds were grown on 98 square miles. Chikodi is famous for its sugar-cane and fruit and vegetable gardens. Tobacco (35 square miles) is an important crop in Chikodi in gardens or on favourable plots near villages or along rivers and streams. Cotton, covering 352 square miles, is the most valuable crop grown in the District. It is especially important in Athni, Parasgad, and Gok\u0101k.\n\n| Taluka | Total area | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste | Forest |\n|--------|------------|------------|-----------|------------------|--------|\n| Athni  | 816        | 701        | 10        | 9                | 1      |\n| Chikodi| 837        | 689        | 28        | 20               | 33     |\n| Gok\u0101k  | 671        | 519        | 19        | 10               | 92     |\n| Belgaum| 644        | 399        | 7         | 18               | 135    |\n| Sampgaon| 410       | 348        | 9         | 10               | 25     |\n| Parasgad| 639       | 526        | 1         | 21               | 49     |\n| Kh\u0101napur| 633       | 243        | 6         | 22               | 340    |\n| **Total**| **4,620** | **3,335** | **80**    | **110**          | **675**|\n\n* Statistics are not available for 37\u00bd square miles of this area. These figures are based upon the latest information.\n\nAmerican cotton was introduced in 1845, and is planted to a small extent in Parasgad and Sampgaon. It has greatly degenerated in the course of years. The cultivators avail themselves freely of the Land Improvement and Agriculturists' Loans Acts. During the decade ending 1903\u20134 more than 17.4 lakhs was advanced, of which 4.2, 3.2, and 3 lakhs was lent in 1896\u20137, 1899\u20131900, and 1901 respectively.\n\nCattle of inferior quality are bred by Dhangars in the forest tracts of Kh\u0101napur and Belgaum, the majority of better breed being imported from Mysore and other places. Bullocks of eight breeds are found in all parts, the strongest and largest being imported from South K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, and the best-trotting oxen from Mysore. Of local breeds, the Nagdi are the most useful and hardy. Buffaloes do not thrive near the Western Gh\u0101ts; but the Gaulis, Hanbars, and Dhangars of Sampgaon, Gok\u0101k, and the eastern tract rear buffaloes of a good type. The so-called Nagdi buffaloes are reputed the best. Ponies of a small and ugly type are bred locally, as also are donkeys and pigs by Vaddars and other low-caste Hindus. Sheep of two breeds, the Kenguri with a soft red wool and the Velga with white or black, are reared by Dhangars, while goats of four varieties are ubiquitous. The best breed of the latter is known as Kuisheli.\n\nOf the total area cultivated, 80 square miles, or 3 per cent., were irrigated in 1903\u20134. Government canals supplied 15 square miles, tanks 16, wells 46, and other sources 10 square miles. The water-supply is plentiful except in the east. Irrigation is largely employed\nfor rice and vegetables in the best portions of the western half of the District. Of the recently improved reservoirs the chief is the Gadekeri lake about 15 miles south-east of Belgaum, in the Sampgaon taluka, which has an area of 129 acres and a maximum depth of 5 feet. The catchment basin measures 4.68 square miles, and the average rainfall is 29 inches. It supplied 337 acres in 1903-4. The most important water-work is the Gok\u0101k canal and storage reservoir. A masonry weir has been built across the Ghatprabha where its catchment area, including that of its chief tributaries the T\u0101mraparni and the Harank\u0101shi, is about 1,100 square miles, of which a large extent lies in the Western Gh\u0101ts. The storage work and the first section of the canal were completed at a cost of 12.2 lakhs, the capital outlay to the end of 1903-4 being 12.9 lakhs. The Gok\u0101k canals command 28 square miles, and irrigate an average of 16 square miles. Wells used for irrigation are most common in Chikodi and Belgaum. In Kh\u0101n\u0101pur no wells are used for this purpose. In 1903-4 wells and tanks used for irrigation numbered 12,660 and 1,161 respectively.\n\nIn the west of the District, among the spurs of the Western Gh\u0101ts, is a considerable area of forest land. Formerly large tracts were yearly destroyed by indiscriminate cultivation of shifting patches of fire-cleared woodland. This form of tillage has now been limited to small areas, specially set apart for the purpose. The District possesses 665 square miles of 'reserved' and 10 square miles of 'protected' forest. Of this total, 51 square miles are in charge of the Revenue department. It is very unevenly distributed, the large talukas of Athni and Parasgad having little or no forest, while Kh\u0101n\u0101pur has twice as much forest as tillage. The forest administration is under a divisional officer, assisted by a subdivisional officer. The Belgaum forests may be roughly divided into 'moist' and 'dry,' the 'dry' lying east of the Poona-Harihar road and the 'moist' lying west of the road. The latter includes the forests of Belgaum and Kh\u0101n\u0101pur, about 500 square miles. The 'dry' forest, about one-eighth of which is stocked with useful wood, is very poor and stony, yielding only firewood scrub with a few small poles fit for hut-building. The produce is chiefly cactus, four kinds of fig, dindal, and tarv\u0101r. The most important trees in the 'moist' forest are teak, black-wood, honne (Pterocarpus Marsupium), hirda or myrabolam, and jack-wood. There are also a few bab\u016bl Reserves. The forest supplies large quantities of firewood to the Southern Mahratta Railway. The total forest receipts in 1903-4 were 277 lakhs.\n\nDiamonds are said to have been found in the sandstone towards Kolh\u0101pur and gold in the valley of the Malprabha. Iron was formerly smelted in Belgaum, Gok\u0101k, and Sampgaon, and near the R\u0101m pass. The ore is generally peroxide of iron, with a mixture of clay, quartz,\nand lime. All the laterite of the District is charged with iron, though in too small a proportion to make it worth smelting. The manufacture of iron has now ceased, partly on account of the increased cost of fuel and partly because of the fall in the price of iron. Besides iron, the only metallic ore which occurs in any quantity is an earthy powdery form of peroxide of manganese, which is found among weathered dolomite at Bh\u012bmgarh.\n\nNext to agriculture, hand-loom weaving forms the chief industry of the District. The weavers are generally Ling\u0101yats or Musalm\u0101ns, with a small sprinkling of Mar\u0101th\u0101s. The finer sorts of cloth are manufactured only in two or three towns. With the exception of a small quantity of cloth sent to the neighbouring Districts, the produce of its hand-looms is almost entirely consumed in Belgaum. Simple dyeing and tanning are carried on over the whole District. Gok\u0101k town was once famous for its dyers, and is still noted for a coarse kind of paper made in large quantities. Gok\u0101k toys, made both from light kinds of wood and from a peculiar kind of earth, are also celebrated. They consist of models of men and gods, fruits and vegetables. A factory for spinning and weaving cotton yarn was established at Gok\u0101k, by an English company, in 1887. The mills are worked by water-power supplied from the falls of the Ghatprabha from a height of about 170 feet. The average daily number of labourers employed in the factory is 2,938, and the yearly out-turn amounts to 5,000,000 lb. The railway station for the mills is Dhupdh\u0101l.\n\nThe capitalists of the District are chiefly M\u0101rw\u0101ris and Br\u0101hmans, but in the town of Belgaum there are a few Musalm\u0101ns who possess comfortable fortunes. There is a considerable trade in cloth and silk, the chief exports being rice, jaggery, tobacco, and cotton, and the chief imports cloth, silk, salt, and grain. In several villages throughout the District markets are held at fixed intervals, usually once a week. These markets supply the wants of the country round within a radius of about 6 miles, containing as a rule from twenty-five to thirty villages and hamlets.\n\nThe West Deccan section of the Southern Mahratta Railway, crossing the District from north to south, was opened in 1887. The line passes through the Kh\u0101n\u0101pur, Belgaum, Chikodi, Gok\u0101k, and Athni t\u0101lukas. A considerable traffic which used to pass along the Poona-Harihar road, or coastwards by the gh\u0101t passes, is now carried by the railway. At Londa, a station in the Kh\u0101n\u0101pur t\u0101luka, the West Deccan section connects with the Bangalore and the Marmagao lines, and in the spring a large amount of produce finds its way to the sea by the latter route. The total length of metalled roads is 498 miles, and of unmetalled roads 515 miles. Of these, 449 miles of metalled and\n62 of unmetalled roads are maintained by the Public Works department. The chief roads are the Harihar road, the Belgaum-Amboli-Vengurla road, the Nip\u0101ni-Mahalingpur road, the road from Sankeshwar to Dh\u0101rw\u0101r via Hukeri, Gok\u0101k, and Saundatti, the road from Shedbal to Bij\u0101pur via Athni, and the Belgaum-Kh\u0101n\u0101pur road to Londa and Kanara.\n\nThe District has suffered from constant scarcities owing to the uncertainty of its rainfall. The earliest recorded failure of rain led to the great Durg\u0101-dev\u012b famine. Subsequent famines occurred in 1419, 1472\u20133 (exceptional distress), 1790 (caused by the raids of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s), 1791\u20132 (failure of early rain), 1802\u20133 (caused by the depredation of the Pind\u0101ris), 1832\u20133, 1853, and 1876\u20137. The need of Government help began about the middle of September, 1876. At the height of the famine in May, 1877, there were 43,196 persons on relief works and 7,641 in receipt of gratuitous relief. After fifteen years the District again (1892) suffered from famine, which chiefly affected three of its t\u0101lukas, Athni, Gok\u0101k, and Parasgad, and relief works were opened. In 1896 the rains were indifferent, and nearly one-third of the total area of the District was distressed, relief being again required. In 1899 the rains failed, bringing on intense scarcity in Athni, Gok\u0101k, Parasgad, and part of Chikodi. Relief works were opened in December, 1900, and continued till October, 1902. The highest number relieved in a day on works was 16,313 (excluding 5,672 dependents) in August, 1901, 5,876 being in receipt of gratuitous relief. It is calculated that the excess of mortality over the normal during the three years was 60,000, and that 100,000 cattle died. Exclusive of advances to the agriculturists and remissions, the famine in the District cost 5 lakhs. Remissions of land revenue and advances amounted to about 2 lakhs.\n\nThe District is divided into seven t\u0101lukas: Athni, Chikodi, Belgaum, Gok\u0101k, Sampgaon, Kh\u0101n\u0101pur, and Parasgad. The Collector Administration. is usually assisted by two officers of the Indian Civil Service and one Deputy-Collector recruited in India. There are three petty subdivisions (pethas): Murgod in Parasgad, Hukeri in Chikodi, and Chandgad in the Belgaum t\u0101luka.\n\nThe District and Sessions Judge at Belgaum is assisted by five Subordinate Judges for civil business. There are altogether seventeen officers to administer criminal justice in the District. The commonest offences are burglary and theft.\n\nOn the acquisition of Belgaum in 1818 the Mar\u0101th\u0101 assessment remained for a time unrevised, although B\u0101ji Rao\u2019s revenue-farming system, which had wrought great havoc in the District, was immediately suspended in favour of the personal or ryotw\u0101ri, then known as the Madras system. A survey was attempted during the first ten years\nof British rule, but no revision of assessment was carried out. The principal features of the land-rent settlement between 1818 and 1848 were a very high nominal demand and the annual grant of large remissions after inspection of the crops. The assessment both by village and holding was very unequally distributed. The settlement of the District began in 1848\u20139. It was at first introduced into 108 villages of the Parasgad taluka, and by 1860\u20131 the whole District had been surveyed and its assessment fixed for thirty years. The villages were arranged in five or more classes, the rate of assessment per acre for each class being fixed in accordance with climatic conditions, propinquity of markets, and other circumstances. The net result was the reduction of the total revenue from 6\u00b74 to 5\u00b75 lakhs. The revision survey settlement was introduced into the District in 1879 and was completed by 1897. The revision found an increase in the cultivated area of 2 per cent. and enhanced the total revenue from 8\u00b75 to 10\u00b79 lakhs. The average assessment per acre of \u2018dry\u2019 land is 13 annas, of rice land Rs. 3\u20138, and of garden land Rs. 2\u20137.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and revenue from all sources have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 17.68  | 21.63  | 20.26  | 22.55  |\n| Total revenue  | 24.05  | 31.04  | 35.96  | 31.50  |\n\nThe District contains six municipalities: namely, Belgaum, Nip\u0101ni, Athni, Gok\u0101k, Saundatti, and Yamkanmardi, the total annual income of which averages a lakh. Outside these, local affairs are managed by a District board and seven taluka boards, with an average income of 2\u00b72 lakhs. The principal source of their income is the land cess. The expenditure in 1903\u20134 amounted to 2\u00b73 lakhs, including one lakh spent on roads and buildings.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police is aided by two Assistants and two inspectors. There are fourteen police stations in the District. The police number 667, including 11 chief constables, 139 head constables, and 517 constables. The mounted police number 12, under 2 daffadars. There are 10 subsidiary jails in the District, with accommodation for 244 prisoners. The daily average number of prisoners in 1904 was 81, of whom 6 were females.\n\nBelgaum stands eleventh among the twenty-four Districts of the Presidency in regard to the literacy of its population, of whom 5\u00b71 (males 9\u00b78 and females 0\u00b73) could read and write in 1901. In 1881 the number of schools was 200, with 12,386 pupils. The latter number rose to 22,064 in 1891; and in 1901 there were 16,239 pupils, of whom 852 were in 47 private schools. In 1903\u20134 there were 352 schools,\nof which 37 were private institutions, attended by 12,927 pupils, including 1,867 girls. Of the public institutions, 2 are high schools, 6 middle, and 307 primary schools. Of the institutions classed as public, one is supported by Government, 220 are managed by local, 30 by municipal boards, and 64 are aided. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was 1.38 lakhs, of which Rs. 22,500 was derived from fees, and Rs. 34,000 was contributed by Local funds. Of the total, 75 per cent. was devoted to primary education.\n\nBelgaum District contains one hospital, five dispensaries, and one railway medical institution, accommodating 86 in-patients. In these institutions 48,000 patients were treated in 1904, including 714 in-patients, and 1,386 operations were performed. The total expenditure, exclusive of the railway dispensary, was about Rs. 14,500, of which about Rs. 6,000 was met from municipal and Local funds.\n\nThe number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1903-4 was 20,758, representing a proportion of 21 per 1,000 of population, which is lower than the average for the Presidency.\n\n[Sir J. M. Campbell, Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, vol. xxi (1884); J. F. Fleet, Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts (1896); E. Stack, Memorandum on Land Revenue Settlements (Calcutta, 1880).]\n\nBelgaum Taluka.\u2014Central taluka of Belgaum District, Bombay, lying between 15\u00b0 41' and 16\u00b0 3' N. and 74\u00b0 2' and 74\u00b0 43' E., with an area, including the Chandgad petty subdivision (petha), of 644 square miles. It contains one town, Belgaum (population, 36,878), the head-quarters; and 201 villages. The population in 1901 was 137,562, compared with 147,150 in 1891, the decrease being largely due to the ravages of plague. The density, 214 persons per square mile, is about the average for the District. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was 1.9 lakhs, and for cesses Rs. 16,000. In the north-west of Belgaum, long sandstone ridges border and in many places cross the central plain. In the west, close to the Western Gh\u0101ts, the climate is damp, while to the east it is more pleasant. The annual rainfall is fairly heavy, averaging 52 inches. Round Belgaum town the country is richly cultivated.\n\nBelgaum Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District of the same name in the Southern Division of the Bombay Presidency, situated in 15\u00b0 51' N. and 74\u00b0 31' E., at an elevation of nearly 2,500 feet above sea-level, on the northern slope of the basin of a watercourse called the Bellary nullah, and on the Southern Mahratta Railway. Population (1901), 36,878, including the cantonment (10,641) and suburbs (3,803). The municipality was established in 1851. During the ten years ending 1901 the income averaged about Rs. 50,000. In 1903-4 the income was Rs. 51,500, chiefly derived from octroi (Rs. 22,000), conservancy rates (Rs. 9,100), and taxes on houses and land (Rs. 4,600). The\nexpenditure amounted to Rs. 50,000, including general administration (Rs. 6,400), public safety (Rs. 2,300), conservancy (Rs. 15,900), public works (Rs. 4,000), and public instruction (Rs. 9,900). The average receipts of the cantonment funds are Rs. 25,000.\n\nThe native town lies between the fort on the east and the cantonment, which extends along its western front, separated from it by a watercourse. It forms an irregular ellipse, approximating to a circle, of which the shorter axis is about 1,300 yards. The rock on which the town is built consists of laterite, lying upon Deccan trap. The site is well wooded. Bamboos, from which Venugrama, the ancient name of the town, is said to be derived, are plentiful, and mangoes, tamarinds, and banyans also abound. The fort, about 1,000 yards in length and 700 yards in breadth and occupying an area of about 100 acres, is surrounded by a broad and deep wet ditch, cut in hard ground. It appears to have been built in 1519 and contains two Jain temples of great interest. The dargah of Asad Khan and the Safa Masjid will also repay a visit. Belgaum was the chief town of a district known as the Belgaum \u2018seventy\u2019 in 1160. About 1265 the Rattas captured it from the Goa Kadambas and made it their capital. In 1250 it passed from the Rattas to the Yadavas. In 1375 the fortress of Belgaum was included in Vijayanagar territory. After being held by Muhammadan rulers the fort passed to the Peshwas about 1754. In 1818, after the overthrow of the Peshwa, the place was invested by a British force. It held out for twenty-one days, after which the garrison of 1,600 men capitulated, having lost 20 killed and 50 wounded, while the British loss amounted to 11 killed and 12 wounded.\n\nBelgaum, since its acquisition by the British, has increased greatly in size and wealth. It was chosen as the civil head-quarters of the District in 1838. It is a military station of the Poona division of the Western Command, and is usually garrisoned by British and Native infantry and a battery of artillery. Of recent years it has suffered severely from recurring epidemics of plague, which have driven many of the residents to remove from the town site and to erect houses in the vicinity. The principal articles of trade are salt, dried fish, dates, coco-nuts, and coir, imported from the sea-coast, chiefly from the port of Vengurla. Grain of all kinds, sugar, and molasses are also brought from the country round. The city contains more than 300 hand-looms for the manufacture of cotton cloth. The water-supply is derived entirely from wells. Besides 9 municipal boys\u2019 schools with 980 pupils and 4 girls\u2019 schools with 323 pupils, there are two high schools with about 500 pupils, one a Government institution, the other belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Mission. There are also two schools for European and Eurasian boys and a Roman Catholic convent for girls. Belgaum is the residence of the Commissioner of the Southern Division. Besides the ordinary\nrevenue and judicial offices, the town contains a cantonment magistrate's court and a Subordinate Judge's court, a civil hospital, and a railway dispensary.\n\n**Beliapatam.** Village and river in Malabar District, Madras. *See Valarpattanam.*\n\n**Bellamkonda** ('the hill of caves').\u2014Hill fortress in the Sattanapalle taluk of Gunt\u00fbr District, Madras, situated in $16^\\circ 30'$ N. and $80^\\circ$ E. The works consist of a single stone wall, connecting the elevated points of the hill and having bastions at the south-east and north-west angles, which terminate the two extremities of the principal front. The entrance, which is in this front, at about a third of its length from the north-west bastion, is gained by a winding pathway from the foot of the hill near the village. In shape, the fort is roughly an equilateral triangle, enclosing an area of irregular elevation of about one-sixteenth of a square mile. The wall is in a very ruinous state, every shower loosening and bringing down parts of it. The two bastions are the most perfect parts, but even these from their overhanging position seem to threaten destruction to everything below. The interior is overgrown with bushes and long grass, which obstruct the passage to the eastern and western faces in many parts. There still remain some buildings of stone, the old magazine and storerooms. The highest point is 1,569 feet above the sea. The early history of the fortress is obscure. It is said to have been constructed by the Reddi kings of Kondav\u00eed. After their power had passed away in 1482 it perhaps fell into the hands of the Orissa kings, for Firishta says it was taken by the Sultan of Golconda from a Telugu R\u00e2j\u00e2 who was a vassal of Orissa. In 1531 the Orissa king took the place a second time by a general escalade, regardless of the loss of his best troops. It must afterwards have reverted to the kings of Vijayanagar, for it was finally taken by the Muhammadans in 1578, when they put an end to Hindu rule in this part of the country. At the close of the eighteenth century the English had a few troops stationed at the bottom of the hill in mud huts.\n\n**Bellary District** (*Ball\u00e2ri*).\u2014The westernmost of the four Ceded Districts in the Madras Presidency, lying between $14^\\circ 28'$ and $15^\\circ 58'$ N. and $75^\\circ 40'$ and $77^\\circ 38'$ E., with an area of 5,714 square miles. It is bounded on the west and north by the river Tungabhadra, which divides it from the Bombay Presidency and the Niz\u00e2m\u2019s Dominions; on the east by Kurnool and Anantapur Districts; and on the south by the State of Mysore.\n\nBellary lies on the northern slope of the Deccan plateau, and the trend of the country is towards the north-east, ranging from an elevation of over 2,000 feet above the sea on the south to about 1,000 feet in the north-east corner. The District is divided east and west by the range of hills in the\nmidst of which lies the Native State of Sand\u016br. To the west the surface of the country is broken by various ranges of small hills, especially in the K\u00fcdligi and Harpanahalli t\u0101luks, where the land rises to join the Mysore plateau, and is often well wooded and generally picturesque. To the east lies a vast expanse of level, almost treeless, dreary, black cotton soil, forming two-thirds of the District, which is broken only by two small groups of hills in the extreme north and south, and by those granite masses, springing abruptly from the surrounding country, which form such a characteristic feature of the Deccan. The central rock of these is usually surrounded by loose boulders, sometimes of enormous size, split off by the action of the weather, and of every variety of colouring from warm reds and browns to pale slaty greys. The principal hills outside of Sand\u016br are those round Kampli, Adoni, and R\u0101yadrug, and the Copper Mountain range. The Kampli group is an irregular semicircle of barren hills lying to the north of Sand\u016br on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and is mainly interesting as forming the site and natural fortification of the ancient city of Vijayanagar. The Copper Mountain, so called from mines no longer worked, is a small range 7 miles west of Bellary town, running parallel to the Sand\u016br hills and rising to a height of 3,285 feet. The hills at Adoni and R\u0101yadrug, on which stand the ancient forts of those towns, run up to 2,000 and 2,727 feet respectively. With the exception of the Sand\u016br range, there is very little vegetation on any of these elevations, and no real forest.\n\nThe river system of the District consists of the Tungabhadra and its tributaries. The Tungabhadra, formed by the junction of the Tunga and Bhadra, both rising near the south-western frontier of Mysore, skirts the District on its western and northern borders for about 195 miles and eventually falls into the Kistna near Kurmool. During the hot season its stream is low and easily fordable in many places; but from June to October, after the south-west monsoon, the waters rise from 15 to 25 feet and the river in several places exceeds half a mile in breadth. When not fordable, it is crossed (except in heavy floods) by means of coracles made of bamboo frames covered with hides. At Vijayanagar the river passes through a fine granite gorge, and below this its course is studded with rocks which render navigation impossible in the dry season. Its waters abound with crocodiles, and considerable quantities of fish are netted. It is crossed by the Southern Mahratta and Madras Railways at Hos\u016bru and R\u0101mpuram respectively. The more notable places upon its banks are Vijayanagar, Kampli, and Mail\u0101r. The Hagari or Ved\u0101vati, the main tributary of the Tungabhadra in the District, rises in Mysore, and after flowing through the R\u0101yadrug and Bellary t\u0101luks falls into the Tungabhadra at H\u0101lekota. It is a very broad and shallow stream, with a total length of about 280 miles, of which 125 are in this District, and rarely has any flow of\nwater for more than five months in the year. The sand from its bed, carried by the prevailing south-westerly winds, is perpetually encroaching on the land along its eastern banks. At Moka, 12 miles from Bellary, the sand-beds are nearly 2 miles broad. The channel of the river varies from a quarter to three-quarters of a mile in width, and even at flood-time the water rarely exceeds 4 feet in depth. The Southern Mahratta Railway bridges it at Param\u0101devanahalli. The Chikka Hagari is a small stream, also rising in Mysore, which, after crossing the western taluks, falls into the Tungabhadra at Kittan\u016bru. Though it comes down occasionally in heavy floods during the monsoons, it is perfectly dry for many months in the year. The irrigation from these rivers is referred to below.\n\nFive-sixths of Bellary is covered with Archaean rocks, granitoid and gneissic, and the little barren hills, characteristic of the Deccan, are formed of these. Superimposed upon them are four well-marked bands of the younger Dh\u0101rw\u0101r series, which run right across the District from north-west to south-east. The chief of these is the line forming the Sand\u016br hills, which is remarkable for the immense quantities of rich hematite it contains. There is also an old gold-mine in it. Quartz tops several of the hills, and trap dikes of great length and width are further characteristics of the geology of the District.\n\nIn the drier eastern taluks the flora consists largely of such drought-resisting plants as Euphorbias, acacias, and Asclepiads, and the Acacia arabica and the margosa (Melia Azadirachta) are the characteristic trees. In the west the growth is more luxuriant and date-palms flourish in the damper hollows. Over all the waste lands grow the yellow-flowered Cassia auriculata and the Dodonaea. The chief trees in such forests as the District possesses are referred to under Forests below.\n\nLeopards are fairly numerous in the hills of Sand\u016br and in the K\u016bdligi and Harpanahalli taluks, where their depredations on cattle are considerable. Bears are found in the western hills, and hyenas and wolves in Harpanahalli. Wild hog infest the Kampli hills and parts of the K\u016bdligi taluk, and do much damage to crops. There are also a considerable number of chink\u0101ra (gazelle) and antelope in the western taluks and in Adoni, but they are not often to be seen in the flatter eastern taluks. Of the larger game-birds, peafowl and bustard are found in Hadagalli and Harpanahalli. The former are especially common along the banks of the Tungabhadra.\n\nThe climate of the District is exceedingly dry throughout and correspondingly healthy. The only parts which are at all malarious are the K\u016bdligi taluk, where there are numerous hills and tanks (artificial irrigation reservoirs), and the irrigated cultivation along the Tungabhadra. The western taluks, especially Harpanahalli, where the temperature approximates to that of the Mysore plateau, are consider-\nably cooler than the eastern. The average mean of the year at Bellary town is $82^\\circ$, but this is considerably exceeded at Adoni. R\u0101mandrug, the little military sanitarium on the Sand\u016br hills, has an average temperature about $12^\\circ$ cooler than Bellary.\n\nLying almost in the middle of the Peninsula, the District gets rain from both monsoons, but only after their supply is almost exhausted. Though everywhere very light, the fall varies considerably in different parts. It is heaviest at R\u0101mandrug (39 inches), and the Adoni and Hospet t\u0113luks (27 inches) receive a good deal more than the western t\u0113luks or Bellary and R\u0101yadrug. In these last two the average fall is only 19 inches, and they form one of the driest tracts in the Presidency. Rather more than half the year\u2019s supply is received during the south-west monsoon. The rainfall is not only small but also very uncertain, and Bellary has suffered constantly from prolonged droughts and frequent deficiencies in the monsoons. Except for famine, it has, however, been peculiarly free of late years from serious natural calamities. In 1804, during the south-west monsoon, there was a series of terrific storms during which hundreds of tanks were breached; and again in 1851 a cyclone swept through the District, washing away several villages, and destroying many roads and irrigation works. The Hagari rose suddenly during this storm and overwhelmed the town of G\u016bliam on its right bank, drowning many of the inhabitants.\n\nThe country round Vijayanagar is the traditional scene of some of the most notable events in the R\u0101m\u0101yana. Inscriptions show that Bellary was intimately connected with the fortunes of History.\n\nthe early dynasties of the Western Ch\u0101lukyas and their successors the Hoysala Ball\u0101las. But little definite is known of the history of the District before the fourteenth century. In 1336 was founded on the banks of the Tungabhadra, near the present hamlet of Hampi, the famous town of Vijayanagar, \u2018the city of victory.\u2019 The town rapidly became the nucleus of a kingdom, and the kingdom grew into an empire. For two centuries its rulers succeeded in uniting the Hindus of Southern India and holding in check the Musalm\u0101ns who were advancing from the north. In 1565, at the battle of T\u0101likot\u0101, Vijayanagar was utterly overthrown by a combination of the Sult\u0101ns of the Deccan. The Musalm\u0101n dominion which followed was weak, and the country was split up into small principalities under chieftains known to history as polig\u0101rs. Locally, their powers were absolute and they used them mercilessly, so that the common people were everywhere ground into the dust. Aurangzeb annexed the dominions of the Musalm\u0101n kings; the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, and after them Haidar Ali of Mysore, followed and seized much of the District; the Niz\u0101m\u2019s rule succeeded; but through all these changes the polig\u0101rs continued to hold all local authority, and it was with them that the British had to\ndeal when the District was ceded to the Company. Bellary had fallen into the power of Haidar Ali of Mysore and his son Tip\u00fb in the latter part of the eighteenth century. At the partition of Tip\u00fb\u2019s territory in 1792, part of the District fell to the Niz\u00e2m. At the further partition which occurred after Tip\u00fb\u2019s defeat and death at Seringapatam in 1799, the Niz\u00e2m obtained the rest of it; but he ceded both portions and other adjoining territory to the British in 1800. Major (afterwards Sir Thomas) Munro was the first Collector of the country so obtained, called the Ceded Districts, which included the present Districts of Cuddapah, Bellary, Anantapur, and much of Kurnool; and his first care was to reduce to order the eighty polig\u00e2rs whom he found within it. Some of these were pensioned and the estates of the remainder were resumed. In 1808 the tract was split into two Districts, Cuddapah and Bellary. The latter then included the present District of Anantapur. This was formed into a separate Collectorate in 1882, and Bellary District as it now stands has thus been a separate Collectorate for only twenty-four years.\n\nMore palaeolithic and neolithic settlements and implements have been found in Bellary than in any other District in Madras, and some of them are of great interest. Round Gollapalle in the R\u00e2yadrug t\u00e2luk are hundreds of kistvaens of the usual pattern, some of which have been found to contain pottery, bones, &c. Jain temples are numerous, and in the western t\u00e2luks are a number of little Ch\u00e2lukyan shrines, covered with most delicate carving in steatite. These are described and illustrated in Mr. Rea\u2019s Ch\u00e2lukyan Architecture. At Adoni, Bellary, R\u00e2yadrug, and elsewhere are ancient hill fortresses of much interest. But the most important antiquities in the District are the extensive and impressive ruins, near Hampi, of the great capital of the Vijayanagar empire.\n\nThe District contains 10 towns and 929 villages. It is divided into 8 t\u00e2luks, the head-quarters of which are at the places from which each is named. Statistics of population according to the Population Census of 1901 are given in the table on next page.\n\nThe principal towns are the two municipalities of Bellary, the District head-quarters, and Adoni; and the eight Unions of Hospet, Yemmigan\u00fbr, R\u00e2yadrug, Kampli, Harpanahalli, Kosigi, Kott\u00fbru, and Siruguppa. The population of the District in 1871 was 911,755; in 1881, 726,275; in 1891, 880,950; and in 1901, 947,214. Hindus form 89 per cent. of the total and Musalm\u00e2ns 10 per cent. The famine of 1876-8 was very severely felt, and it was not until over twenty years afterwards that the population recovered the loss it then suffered. The percentage of increase during the last decade was a little above the average for the Presidency, in spite of considerable emigration to Mysore. The apparent decline in the Hadagalli t\u00e2luk is due to the total for 1891\nhaving been unduly inflated by the presence of numerous pilgrims at the great festival at Mail\u00e4r. Bellary is the least sparsely peopled District in the Deccan, the density being as much as 100 per square mile below the Presidency average. Kanarese is the prevailing language in the west and Telugu in the east. On the whole, 57 per cent. of the people speak the former and 30 per cent. the latter tongue.\n\n| Taluk   | Area in square miles | Number of | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1841 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|---------|----------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Adoni   | 839                  | 3         | 191        | 178,784                   | 213                                                      | 6,884                                  |\n| Alur    | 686                  | ...       | 106        | 98,568                    | 144                                                      | 3,666                                  |\n| Bellary | 962                  | 2         | 156        | 193,401                   | 201                                                      | 11,807                                 |\n| Rayadurg| 628                  | 1         | 71         | 82,789                    | 132                                                      | 2,555                                  |\n| Hospet  | 540                  | 2         | 121        | 101,947                   | 189                                                      | 4,939                                  |\n| Hadagalli| 585                 | ...       | 87         | 92,094                    | 157                                                      | 4,193                                  |\n| Kudligi | 863                  | 1         | 116        | 103,985                   | 120                                                      | 4,937                                  |\n| Harpanahalli| 611          | 1         | 81         | 95,646                    | 157                                                      | 3,981                                  |\n| District total | 5,714            | 10        | 929        | 947,214                   | 166                                                      | 430,52                                 |\n\nThe majority of the Hindus are Telugus or Kanarese. Of the Telugus, the Boyas (shikaris) and cultivators, and formerly the material from which many of the troops of the poligars and of Haidar were raised) are the strongest community, numbering 121,000, or more than in any other District. Then come the M\u00e4diga leather-workers (77,000), followed by the K\u0101pus, the great agriculturist class (48,000). Among Kanarese castes, the Kurubas (shepherds) are the most numerous (97,000). The Lingayats, a sect of Hindus who worship Siva and his symbol the lingam, and disregard the sacerdotal authority of Br\u00e4hmans, number 96,000 (which is nearly two-thirds of the total of the sect within the Presidency). The castes which speak neither Telugu nor Kanarese are divided almost equally between Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Tamils, and Lamb\u0101dis, the last of whom, a wandering gipsy community, are more numerous in Bellary than in any other District. The majority of the Musalm\u0101ns are Shaikhs, but there are nearly 10,000 of the mixed race of D\u016bdekulas. By occupation, nearly three-fourths of the total population are agriculturists or shepherds. Weavers are, however, more than usually numerous.\n\nThe number of Christians in the District is 5,066, or about five in every 1,000 of the population. About 3,700 of them are natives, and nearly three-quarters are Roman Catholics. The first priest to visit this part of the country was a Father Joachim D'Souza, who came to Bellary from Goa in 1775 and died in 1829. The natives called him Adikan\u0101da, and his memory is still held in veneration. The\nBellary mission continued under the charge of the Goa priests until 1837. In that year a chaplain was appointed by Government for the Roman Catholic troops at Bellary, and under the double jurisdiction which ensued many more churches and chapels were erected than the number of Catholics required. The Goa jurisdiction ceased with the establishment of the regular hierarchy by an apostolic letter of Pope Leo XIII in 1886. The mission is at present under the direction of the Roman Catholic chaplain, assisted by four Fathers from the Missionary Society of St. Joseph, London. The only Protestant mission in the District is that of the London Missionary Society. It was established in 1810 and has a staff of five missionaries, one of whom is a lady.\n\nThe soils of the District are classed as red, mixed, and black; the two former preponderate in the hilly western taluks, and the latter in the level tracts of Bellary, Alur, Adoni, and Rayadrug. The red ferruginous soils are derived from the decomposition of the granitic rocks, and are loams of a more or less sandy character. They are much less fertile than the black cotton soil of the eastern taluks. The average depth of this latter is about 4 feet, but a much greater thickness is found in certain localities. In Alur it is of particular richness, and the rates of assessment there are the highest in the District. A disadvantage, however, is that, owing perhaps to the underlying beds of soft calcareous limestone, trees will not flourish in it and the water in the wells is frequently brackish.\n\nThe seasons of cultivation on the red and mixed soils differ altogether from those on the black. On the former, 'dry' crops are sown at the beginning of the south-west monsoon in June; but the latter is held to require the thorough soaking obtainable only from the later rains of that monsoon, and korra (Setaria italica) and cotton are sown on it in August and other crops in November. On 'wet' lands rice is sown in May and January and sugar-cane in March. Like the other Deccan Districts, Bellary possesses several ingenious agricultural implements which are almost unknown elsewhere, among them the bamboo seed-drill, the bullock-hoe, and the big iron plough used for eradicating deep-rooted grasses.\n\nThere are no zamindaris in the District, but more than a fifth of the total area is inam land. Of the total of 5,714 square miles, the village accounts give particulars for 5,697. Details by taluks for 1903-4 are given in the table on the next page, areas being in square miles.\n\nThe two principal food-grains are cholam (Sorghum vulgare) and the korra already mentioned. The area under the former in 1903-4 amounted to nearly one-third of the total area cropped. Both are\nlargely grown in all taluks, but are especially favourite crops in Bellary, Alur, and Adoni in the east. Pulses are grown to a considerable extent; but, except in R\u0101yadrug, they are usually mixed with the cereals on no fixed principles, and the exact area is not ascertainable. Irrigation being rare, the rice crop is small, occupying only 63 square miles in 1903\u20134. The chief industrial crop is cotton, grown mainly on the black cotton soil in the four eastern taluks and in Hadagalli. In the red soils of K\u016bdligi, Harpanahalli, and Hadagalli, large quantities of castor and other oilseeds are raised. Sugar-cane is grown mainly in Hospet, where it occupies 5 per cent. of the cultivated area. It has not yet developed the disease which has appeared in other Districts, and the area under it is steadily increasing.\n\n| Taluk     | Area shown in accounts | Forests | Cultivable waste | Cultivated | Irrigated |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------|-----------------|------------|-----------|\n| Adoni     | 830                    | 59      | 34              | 666        | 7         |\n| Alur      | 686                    | 25      | 13              | 613        | 1         |\n| Bellary   | 962                    | 29      | 38              | 799        | 8         |\n| R\u0101yadrug  | 629                    | 49      | 81              | 440        | 22        |\n| Hospet    | 530                    | 131     | 34              | 253        | 27        |\n| Hadagalli | 587                    | 46      | 56              | 432        | 4         |\n| K\u016bdligi   | 862                    | 209     | 130             | 382        | 16        |\n| Harpanahalli | 611                | 86      | 43              | 375        | 5         |\n| **Total** | **5,697**              | **625** | **429**         | **3,960**  | **90**    |\n\nExcept in K\u016bdligi, the proportion of arable land to the total extent is high, but a considerable amount is still unoccupied, especially in the western taluks. The poorer soils there are frequently cultivated for a single year, and then abandoned and left to recuperate. The area occupied fluctuates considerably owing to the numerous bad seasons which have visited the District, but there has been a net increase during the last thirty years of rather more than 10 per cent. Except for the general introduction of iron ploughs during recent years, little has been done in the way of agricultural improvement. Attempts to introduce foreign varieties of cotton have been unsuccessful; and wells, owing largely to the great expense of constructing them in both the loose cotton soil and the rocky red land, are not popular.\n\nAbout 6\u00bd lakhs was advanced during the sixteen years following 1888 under the Land Improvement Loans Act. The greater part of this has been spent upon the reclamation of land overrun with deep-rooted grass and prickly-pear (Opuntia). Considerable sums have also been borrowed under the Agriculturists\u2019 Loans Act for the relief of distress, purchase of seed, and similar purposes.\n\nThe indigenous breed of cattle is small and weak. The best draught animals in use in the eastern taluks are brought from Nellore by travelling drovers. In the west, large numbers of cattle are imported\nfrom Mysore and sold at the two great annual fairs on the Tungabhadra at Mail\u0101r and Kuruvatti. A fine breed of pack-buffaloes, bred in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, is used in Kampli and the neighbouring villages. Ponies are not raised in the District in any number. There are two varieties of sheep, the black or long-fleeced and the white and reddish-brown long-legged variety. The latter are kept chiefly for their manure and flesh; but the former give a fair wool, which is largely used in R\u0101yadrug, K\u016bdligi, and Harpanahalli for the manufacture of the cheap black or black and white blankets which serve the ryot as bed, umbrella, portmanteau, or great-coat, as need may require. Goats are reared in large numbers for both milk and manure.\n\nCattle for the plough and milch kine are fed mainly on cholam stalks and cotton-seed. Sheep and the younger cattle are grazed in forest Reserves and on waste lands. Goats, owing to their destructive habits, are confined to waste lands and roadsides.\n\nThe area irrigated in 1903\u20134 was 90 square miles, or little more than 2 per cent. of the total area under cultivation. This was watered in almost equal proportions from Government channels, from tanks, and from wells. Practically the whole of the irrigation from channels is that fed by the Tungabhadra canals. This river is perennial, and provides the only unfailing source of supply in the District. There are ten dams across it, all of which were originally constructed by the Vijayanagar kings, though English engineers have done much to improve and regulate the supply drawn from them. Near one of them is an inscription recording its construction in A.D. 1521 by the famous king Krishna Deva R\u0101ya of Vijayanagar. The area irrigated by them collectively in 1933\u20134 was about 17,000 acres, of which 12,500 were in the Hospet t\u0101luks. The Tungabhadra runs in a deep bed and the ground slopes down towards it, so that it is impossible for them to command much land. Channels dug annually in the beds of the Hagari and Chinna Hagari irrigate small areas in the R\u0101yadrug and K\u016bdligi t\u0101luks. The great Tungabhadra irrigation project, designed to benefit not only Bellary but several other Districts also, is described in the separate account of that river.\n\nThe tanks of the District are usually small, irrigating on an average less than 50 acres apiece. The two largest are the Kanekallu tank in R\u0101yadrug and the Daroji tank in Hospet. The former, which is supplied by a channel from the Hagari, waters 2,300 acres. The Daroji tank, which is said to have been constructed by Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n, has an embankment 2\u00bd miles in length and in some places 60 feet in height. It irrigates about 1,800 acres. Irrigation from wells is commonest in K\u016bdligi and R\u0101yadrug. There is room for more of these sources in Harpanahalli and Hadagalli, but in the cotton-soil t\u0101luks irrigation is not popular.\nThough there is a considerable area in each taluk of so-called forest, the Reserves mainly consist of patches of more or less scanty scrub jungle, in which it is hoped that careful preservation extended over a number of years may induce a growth of larger timber. Tradition says that there were originally extensive forests in the District; but none has existed within living memory, and at present the resources of the Reserves are severely taxed to produce even the firewood required locally. Timber and bamboos are largely imported, chiefly from the Nallamalais. The Kudligi Reserves contain the largest growth, including a small amount of teak. *Anogeissus latifolia*, acacias, *Prosopis*, *Carissa*, and *Terminalia tomentosa* are the commonest forest trees. The growth on the hills in the Sandur State is finer than anywhere in the District proper; and 40,000 acres of this range are leased from the Raja at a rental of Rs. 10,000 and worked as part of the Bellary forests. The characteristic tree here is *Hardwickia binata*, one of the hardest and heaviest woods in India. A small amount of sandal-wood and teak is also cut, and it is hoped that it may eventually be possible to supply the Southern Mahratta Railway with fuel from these hills. Like other forest areas in the District they suffer severely from fires, owing to the extreme dryness of the climate.\n\nVery little has been done to exploit the mineral resources of the District, though they are considerable. Iron used until recently to be smelted in small quantities in Hospet and Kudligi to make boilers for the local manufacture of sugar, but it has now been ousted by the cheaper English product. With greater facilities for obtaining fuel this industry might be enormously extended, as the supply of hematite is unlimited and the Sandur hills contain what is possibly the richest ore in the whole of India. Manganese deposits also occur on this range, and several beds of mineral pigments. A small quantity of gold has been won in the past by washing in some of the jungle streams in Harpanahalli, but this part of the District has been prospected under European supervision without result. Among building materials may be mentioned seven beautiful porphyries, eminently suitable for decorative work, and the splendid varieties of ribbon jasper which occur in the Sandur hills. Neither of these has ever been worked.\n\nCotton and silk-weaving are important in all parts of the District, and the proportion of the population engaged in the former industry is unusually large. The cotton stuffs woven are of the ordinary coarse variety; but at the centres of the silk-weaving industry in Kampli, Hampasagaram, Rayadurg, and elsewhere handsome fabrics of various patterns are manufactured, which are exported to the Nizam's Dominions and Bombay. Both the cotton and silk are largely dyed locally. Coloured cotton rugs, manufactured\nat Adoni, mainly by Muhammadans, have a considerable sale all over the Presidency and also in other parts of India. Woollen blankets are woven in a large number of villages in the K\u00fcdligi and Harpanahalli taluks, chiefly by Kurubas, the wool being obtained locally. They are exported in large numbers to other Districts. A small amount of ordinary brass-ware is made at Hospet and one or two other villages; and a family or two in the K\u00fcdligi and Harpanahalli taluks make from soapstone small vessels and little images of Basava, the bull in whose form the founder of the Ling\u0101yat sect is worshipped.\n\nThere are seven steam cotton-presses or ginning factories in the District, two at Bellary and five at Adoni. The total number of hands employed in 1904 was 660. A spinning mill established at Bellary in 1894, which is fitted with machinery of the latest pattern, employed an average of 520 hands in 1903\u20134. The number of spindles was 17,800, producing 650 tons of yarn valued at 4\u00bd lakhs. Several tanneries are at work, but the only one of any size is at R\u0101yadrug, where 45 hands were employed in 1904. About 45,000 skins were dealt with, producing leather valued at Rs. 40,000. A small distillery at Bellary had an out-turn of 32,000 gallons of spirit, valued at Rs. 37,000.\n\nAs is natural from its geographical position, the chief trade of Bellary is with Bombay, the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, and Mysore, rather than with the rest of the Madras Presidency. From Bombay are imported rice, turmeric, chillies, metal and metal work (especially brass-ware from Hubli); and in return cereals, silk fabrics, cotton carpets, blankets, and jaggery (coarse sugar) are exported. Cattle, rice, timber, and coco-nut oil are received from Mysore, blankets, oilseeds, and cotton stuffs being exported thither. To the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions Bellary sends cholam, jaggery, cotton and silk fabrics, and receives in return chiefly raw cotton. Trade with other parts of the Presidency is principally in manufactured goods, the raw products of the District being sent in exchange. About three-quarters of the total output of cotton is sent to Madras city.\n\nThe chief centres of general trade are Bellary, Adoni, and Hospet, the large trade in cotton being confined to the first two of these. Hospet serves as an entrep\u00f4t for the exchange of the products of the western taluks with the Dh\u0101rw\u0101r District of Bombay and the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, while a great deal of business with both Mysore and Bombay is transacted at the annual fairs at Mail\u0101r and Kuruvatti. From the southern parts of the western taluks large quantities of merchandise are taken to D\u0101vangere in the Chitaldroog District of Mysore. The ordinary trade is mostly in the hands of the Chetti caste, but a colony of M\u0101rw\u0101ris at Bellary controls the export grain trade there. Besides the fairs above mentioned, there are numerous local markets for internal trade. The fees levied at them by the local boards yield about Rs. 7,000 annually.\nThe north-west line of the Madras Railway (standard gauge) traverses the two eastern taluks, passing through the town of Adoni and leaving the District by a large girder-bridge over the Tungabhadra at R\u0101mpuram. This section was opened in 1870. At Guntakal, just beyond the borders of Bellary, there is a junction between the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railways. The metre-gauge line of the latter crosses the District in a westerly direction, connecting Guntakal with Bellary and Bellary with Hospet and with Dh\u0101rw\u0101r in Bombay. Through Guntakal, Bellary is also connected southwards with Anantapur and Bangalore, and to the east with the Districts of Kurnool, Cuddapah, Gunt\u016br, and Kistna. The line from Guntakal to Bellary was finished in 1871, and was originally part of the Madras Railway and on the standard gauge. It was converted to the metre gauge in 1887. Two metre-gauge famine protective lines from Bellary to R\u0101yadrug and from Hospet to Kott\u016bru, 33 and 38 miles in length respectively, have recently been constructed.\n\nBellary has 271 miles of metalled and 582 miles of unmetalled roads, all of which are under the management of the local boards. More avenues along them are badly needed, only 112 miles being planted with trees, a shorter length than in any other Madras District except the Nilgiris. The main routes are the road from Bangalore, which passes through Bellary and Adoni on the way to Raich\u016br and Secunder\u0101b\u0101d, and that from Madras to Bombay through Bellary and Hospet. The eastern and western taluks are joined by roads passing to the north and south of the Sand\u016br hills, and by a third which crosses the State of Sand\u016br by means of two narrow gorges through the hills which enclose it. Were the roads kept in proper repair, the District would be amply supplied with means of communication; but money for bridges is scarce, and in the cotton-soil taluks road-metal is difficult to obtain.\n\nThe whole of Bellary lies within the famine zone, irrigation works are few, and any shortage in its scanty rainfall is liable to produce distress. It has in consequence suffered perhaps more than any other District in Madras from severe and protracted famines. There were scarcities in 1802\u20134, 1805\u20137, 1824, 1884\u20135, and 1900; and famines in 1833, 1854, 1866, 1876\u20138, 1891\u20132, and 1896\u20137; and it has been truly said that \u2018the unfortunate ryot has hardly emerged from one famine before he is submerged under another.\u2019\n\nIt has been calculated that during the last half-century alone the expenditure on relief and the loss of revenue due to bad seasons in Bellary have amounted to no less than 196 lakhs. The worst years were 1854, 1866, 1876\u20138, and 1896\u20137. In the famine of 1876\u20138 Bellary was very severely affected; more than a fifth of the population is computed to have perished from starvation or disease, and the mortality in the Adoni and Al\u016br taluks was as high as one-third. At the Census of 1891, fourteen years after the famine, the population of\nthe District continued to be less than at the Census of 1871, before this visitation. At the height of the famine one-half of the population were in receipt of relief in one form or other. The supreme difficulty that baffled the authorities was the absolute impossibility of getting grain to an area where the only means of transport was by bullock-cart and there was no fodder for the bullocks. The railways will now prevent the recurrence of such a disaster. The famine of 1896\u20137 was severely felt in all but the R\u0101yadrug and Harpanahalli t\u0101luks. In July, 1897, about 18,000 persons were receiving gratuitous relief by grain doles and 78,000 were employed on relief works. There was considerable mortality from cholera and measles, but, as far as could be ascertained, no deaths occurred from privation alone.\n\nFor administrative purposes Bellary is arranged into three subdivisions. The four western t\u0101luks of Hospet, Hadagalli, Harpanahalli, and K\u00fcdligi form one charge, known as the Hospet subdivision, under a Covenanted Civilian. The Bellary subdivision, consisting of Bellary and R\u0101yadrug, and the Adoni subdivision, consisting of Al\u016br and Adoni, are usually under Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. Besides the eight tahsild\u0101rs in charge of these eight t\u0101luks, deputy-tahsild\u0101rs are stationed at Siruguppa in the Bellary t\u0101luk and at Yemmigan\u016br in Adoni; and stationary sub-magistrates at Bellary, Hospet, K\u00fcdligi, and Adoni. The District Forest officer and the District Superintendent of police reside at Bellary, which is also the headquarters of the Inspector of Schools, Second Circle, of the Superintending Engineer, Third Circle, and of the Assistant Commissioner of Salt and Abk\u0101ri Revenue, Bellary Subdivision.\n\nFor purposes of civil justice, part of Anantapur (which was originally included in the old Bellary District) comes under the jurisdiction of the District Judge at Bellary; but on the other hand the Adoni t\u0101luk is within the Munsifi of Gooty, outside the District, appeals from which area lie to the District Court of Kurnool. There are two District Munsifs, one at Bellary and the other at Hospet. As a rule, fewer cases are dealt with by Village Munsifs in Bellary than in any other District. The number of revenue suits is also extremely small, there being no zam\u012bnd\u0101ris and but few large in\u0101ms.\n\nThe arrangements regarding criminal justice are also anomalous, the Court of Sessions at Bellary taking cognizance of sessions cases in all the t\u0101luks of Anantapur except Gooty and T\u0101dpatri, as well as those in Bellary. The Collector and the three divisional officers are first-class magistrates with the usual powers. All tahsild\u0101rs and deputy-tahsild\u0101rs, as well as the stationary sub-magistrates, have second-class powers, and in some cases the t\u0101luk sheristad\u0101rs are third-class magistrates. Usually very few of the village magistrates use the petty powers with which they are entrusted.\nThe distinctive criminal caste of the District is the Korachas, an incorrigible class who wander about in gangs. Several of their gangs have settled permanently in Bellary, and are greatly aided in their depredations by the proximity of the Niz\u0101m's Dominions, where they can easily take refuge and are difficult to trace. They are some of the most daring and best-organized dacoits in the Presidency. Murders, which are numerous, are mostly due to village factions. Other crimes, such as cattle-theft, are also common, and are traceable to the natural poverty of the District and the uncertainty of the seasons.\n\nNothing is definitely known of the revenue system under the Vijaya-nagar kings, but according to tradition the revenue was paid in kind in the proportion of half the gross produce. The Musalm\u0101n governments which followed apparently continued the same system, though, by some method not clearly ascertainable, a minimum amount was fixed as the assessment for the whole region now constituting the Ceded Districts. This was called the k\u0101mil assessment, and was retained by Aurangzeb and afterwards by Haidar Ali, though the latter and his son and successor Tip\u016b Sult\u0101n increased the revenue by a large resumption of in\u0101ms. After the overthrow of the Vijayanagar empire, the country was largely in the hands of the polig\u0101rs already mentioned, through whom a great part of the revenue was nominally collected. The amount which reached the central government naturally varied according to the relative power of the polig\u0101rs, and the result was an ever-increasing impoverishment of the cultivating classes.\n\nWhen the Ceded Districts were transferred to the East India Company in 1800, the whole tract was placed in charge of Munro. His first step was to do away with the interference of the eighty or more polig\u0101rs who were scattered over them, and to introduce a system of direct engagements with every cultivator for the revenue, the assessment varying according to the amount of land occupied. In conjunction with this, he instituted a survey, which ascertained not only the extent of the fields, but also the quality of the different kinds of soil.\n\nWhile this settlement was in progress, the Government of India directed that, as a preliminary step towards a permanent settlement of the land revenue on the Bengal system, the villages should be leased to renters for a fixed sum for three years, the lessee making his own arrangements with the cultivators. In spite of the strenuous representations of Munro and the opposition of the Governor of Madras, Lord William Bentinck, this system came into force in the Ceded Districts in 1808. Munro had taken leave shortly before this, and, on his departure, the present Districts of Bellary and Anantapur were constituted a Collectorate by themselves. Though the Collector reported very strongly against the triennial leases and their damaging effect on the condition of his charge, an extension in the shape of decennial leases was intro-\nduced by order of Government in 1812. The result was a complete failure. The renters were incompetent and merciless, the ryots were contumacious and obstructive, and large numbers of the former became unable to pay their dues to Government. Eventually the Court of Directors ordered a return to the ryotw\u0101ri settlement on the expiration of the leases, and the immediate surrender of the leases was accepted in all cases where the renters were willing to relinquish them at once. The result of this disastrous experiment was a great reduction in the wealth of the District, the villages being given up by the renters with their resources much impaired. From the introduction of the ryotw\u0101ri settlement in 1818 down to 1859 there were several general reductions in the assessment, rendered necessary both by a succession of bad seasons and also by the fact that Munro's original settlement had imposed a higher rate than the land was capable of bearing, especially since it was calculated on the basis of the grain prices in force at the beginning of the century and these had since fallen very greatly.\n\nIn 1882 seven of the southern taluks were formed into the separate District of Anantapur. A survey and settlement of the remaining taluks which constitute the present Bellary District were carried out between 1884 and 1896. The excess discovered in the cultivated area was about 5 per cent., and the increase in the assessment effected (which was especially lenient in consideration of the infertility of the District and its losses by bad seasons) was Rs. 85,000, or rather less than 7 per cent. The average assessment on 'dry' land in the cotton-soil taluks of Adoni, Alur, and Bellary is now R. 0-15-7 per acre (maximum Rs. 2-8, minimum 2 annas), and on 'wet' land Rs. 6-14-11 (maximum Rs. 11, minimum R. 1); while in the remaining red soil taluks the average 'dry' rate is R. 0-8-8 (maximum Rs. 2-4, minimum 2 annas), and the average 'wet' rate Rs. 5-6-3 (maximum Rs. 11, minimum R. 1). Owing partly to the small extent of irrigated land, the average extent of a holding is 15 acres, being greater than in any other Madras District except the Nilgiris.\n\nThe revenue from land and the total revenue in recent years are given below, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 18,18  | 19,63  | 20,79  |\n| Total revenue  | 28,10  | 30,26  | 32,30  |\n\nThere are two municipalities in the District, Bellary and Adoni, both established in 1867. Outside their limits local affairs are managed by the District board, and the three taluk boards of Bellary, Hospet, and Adoni, the jurisdictions of which correspond to the subdivisions of the same names. The expenditure of all these boards in 1903-4 was\n2\u00bd lakhs, of which nearly half was laid out on roads and buildings. The chief item in the receipts, as usual, is the land cess. Nineteen towns and villages have been constituted Unions under (Madras) Act V of 1884.\n\nThe police force is controlled by a District Superintendent and an Assistant Superintendent. In 1904 there were 61 police stations, and the force consisted of 13 inspectors and 1,141 constables, with a reserve of 89 men. There were also 974 rural police working in conjunction with the regular force.\n\nThe District jail at Bellary town has accommodation for 323 males and 23 females, exclusive of the observation cells and hospital, which will hold 27 and 36 inmates respectively. As this does not sufficiently provide for the needs of adjoining Districts, from which prisoners are sent to this jail, 100 more cells are being constructed. The only manufacture carried on in the jail is the weaving of the woollen blankets of the country. There are nine subsidiary jails. Seven are situated at the taluk head-quarters (except Bellary), and the other two at the deputy-tahsildars' stations at Siruguppa and Yemmiganur. They provide accommodation for a total of 161 prisoners.\n\nAs regards education, Bellary is one of the most backward areas in Madras. At the Census of 1901 it stood seventeenth among the twenty-two Districts of the Presidency in the literacy of its male population, and last in that of its females. Persons who could read and write formed only 4\u00b76 per cent. (8\u00b76 males and 0\u00b73 females) of the total. The Bellary taluk contained a considerably higher proportion than any other, but in Rayadrug only 3 per cent. were returned as literate. The total number of pupils under instruction in 1881-2 was 10,368; in 1890-1, 18,858; in 1900-1, 26,283; and in 1903-4 only 14,861. The number of educational institutions of all kinds in March, 1904, was 627, of which 604 were classed as public, and the remainder as private. Of the former, 11 were managed by the Educational department, 36 by the local boards, and 8 by the two municipalities; 314 received grants-in-aid, and 235, though not aided, conformed to the rules of the department. These institutions included 591 primary, 9 secondary, 3 training and other special schools, and the Wardlaw College at Bellary town. The number of girls in them was 1,504. As usual, the majority of the pupils were only in primary classes. The percentage of boys of school-going age in these classes was 18, and of girls 2. Among Musalmans the corresponding figures were 19 and 2. There are 13 Panchama schools in the District, with 479 pupils. The total expenditure on education in 1903-4 was 1\u00b722 lakhs, of which Rs. 34,000 was derived from fees. Of the total, Rs. 8,500 was devoted to primary education.\n\nBellary possesses seven hospitals. Two are maintained by the municipalities; of the other five, which are all kept up by the local\nboards, four are at taluk and one at a deputy-tahsildar's head-quarters. They have a total accommodation of 95 beds, 57 for males and 38 for females. The Bellary hospital, founded in 1842, with a small endowment of Rs. 2,500, has 40 beds. There are also five dispensaries maintained by the boards in certain of the larger villages, and two more by the municipality at Bellary. The total number of cases treated in 1903 was 129,000, of whom 900 were in-patients, and 3,000 operations were performed. The total expenditure was Rs. 31,000. There is a hospital for women at Bellary town, built from subscriptions to the Victoria Memorial Fund, and two others are to be opened shortly at Adoni and Hospet.\n\nVaccination has been efficiently performed in late years. In 1903-4 the number of persons protected was 32 per 1,000 of the population, compared with the average of 30 for the whole Presidency. Vaccination is compulsory in the two municipalities of Bellary and Adoni, but in none of the nineteen Unions.\n\n[For further particulars of the District see the Bellary Gazetteer, by W. Francis (1904).]\n\nBellary Subdivision.\u2014Subdivision of Bellary District, Madras, consisting of the Bellary and Rayadrug taluks.\n\nBellary Taluk.\u2014Eastern taluk of the District of the same name, Madras, lying between 14\u00b0 57' and 15\u00b0 44' N. and 76\u00b0 40' and 77\u00b0 10' E., with an area of 962 square miles. The population in 1901 was 193,401, compared with 180,353 in 1891. The taluk contains two towns, Bellary (population, 58,247), the head-quarters and the capital of the District, and Siruguppa (5,805); and 156 villages. The demand for land revenue and cesses amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 4,23,000, being the highest in the District. As much as four-fifths of the total area, a higher proportion than in any other taluk, is covered with black cotton soil, the remaining fifth being red land. Except in the extreme south, where it is bounded, and in places broken up, by the spurs of the Copper Mountain, it forms a wide level expanse diversified only by low granite hills. It slopes north and north-eastwards towards the Tungabhadra and the Hagari; the Pedda Vanka, one of the streams which carry its drainage into the latter, is of a respectable size. It is the largest, most populous, and best-educated taluk in the District; and it contains the highest proportion of Musalmans, nearly four-fifths of all the Christians, and an unusual number of the few Jains who are found there. More than half the population speak Kanarese, only a fifth speaking Telugu. The land served by the Tungabhadra channels about Siruguppa is the most fertile in the District. Cholam and korra are the staple crops, but the area under cotton is large and a considerable amount of cambu is grown. The forest area is smaller than in any taluk except Alur, and the rainfall is the lightest in the District.\nBellary Town.\u2014Head-quarters of the District and taluk of the same name, Madras, situated in $15^\\circ 9' N.$ and $76^\\circ 51' E.$ It is one of the chief military stations in Southern India, and is garrisoned by both British and Native troops. The force maintained is, however, considerably smaller than it used to be. Bellary is the seventh largest town in the Presidency. Its population in 1871 was 51,766; in 1881, 53,460; in 1891, 59,467; and in 1901, 58,247. The growth has thus been slow. The decline during the last decade was due to the removal of some of the troops. In 1901, 60 per cent. of the inhabitants were Hindus and 32 per cent. Musalmans; Christians numbered about 4,000.\n\nThe town stands in the midst of a wide, level plain of black cotton soil. The Southern Mahratta Railway passes through it, connecting it with Hubli on the west and with Guntakal junction on the east, by which route it is 305 miles from Madras. It also lies on the trunk road from Bangalore to Secunderabad. The most conspicuous objects are the Fort Hill and the Face Hill, the latter so called from the resemblance of certain rocks on its summit to a human face. They are bare, rocky elevations with hardly any vegetation on them. The fort on the former gave Bellary its ancient importance and led to its selection as the site of a cantonment. This fortress consists of an upper citadel on the rock, the top of which is 1,976 feet above the sea, and a lower enclosure at the foot. The citadel is guarded by three lines of strong fortifications, which are still in excellent repair, and contains a number of substantial buildings and an ample water-supply from reservoirs constructed in the clefts of the rocks. There is only one way up, which is strongly defended. The lower fort is surrounded by a rampart with numerous bastions, faced by a deep ditch and glacis. Magazines, the quarters of the guard in charge of them, the chief church of the civil station, and several public offices and schools are built within this. It used also at one time to contain an arsenal. The town includes the civil station to the east of the fort, the cantonment on the west, and on the south, between these two areas, the Cowl Bazar and the suburbs of Bruce-pettah and Mellor-pettah, named after two civil officers once stationed at Bellary.\n\nUntil the British made Bellary a cantonment it contained little but its fort. This was originally the residence of a chieftain called Hanumappa Naik, whose family held it as vassals of the kings of Vijayanagar and afterwards of the Sultans of Bijapur. About 1678 it was taken from them by the famous Maratha chief Shivaji, because as he was passing that way some of his foragers had been killed by the garrison; but he restored it again at once on condition that tribute should be paid him. About 1761 it became tributary to Basalat Jang of Adoni. The chief quarrelled with Basalat Jang and refused to pay tribute. The place was accordingly besieged by a force from Adoni. The chief applied for aid to Haidar\nAl\u012b, who made a wonderful forced march, which has been graphically described by Wilks, and routed the Adoni troops. He then, however, seized it for himself and erected the present fortifications. Tradition says that they were designed by a Frenchman in Haidar's service, and that Haidar, finding the fort was commanded by the Face Hill, hanged him afterwards at the main guard gate. The fort was in the possession of Mysore until 1792, when, with others of Tipu's territories, it was given to the Niz\u0101m. The Niz\u0101m ceded it to the British with the rest of the District in 1800. It did not become the head-quarters of the District until 1840, the Collector until that year living at Anantapur.\n\nThough Bellary is situated 1,400 feet above the sea, its climate is hot and very dry, but it is considered a healthy town. Its great want is a proper water-supply, and it is hoped that the completion of the great irrigation project connected with the Tungabhadra will supply this. Besides being the head-quarters of the District staff, it is also the residence of a Superintending Engineer and an Inspector of Schools. A company of the Southern Mahratta Railway Volunteer Rifles is also located here, and the town is the head-quarters of the Roman Catholic Mission and of the London Mission. It contains a District jail, with accommodation for 346 prisoners.\n\nThe chief educational institution is the Wardlaw College, which was founded as a school in 1846 by the Rev. R. S. Wardlaw, D.D., of the London Mission, and was raised to a second-grade college in 1891. It is the only Arts college in the Ceded Districts. In 1903\u20134 it had an average daily attendance of 319 students, of whom 17 were in the F.A. class. A high school is maintained by the municipality; and there is a technical class at St. Philomena's high school managed by the nuns of the Order of the Good Shepherd, the pupils of which are almost all Europeans or Eurasians.\n\nBellary was created a municipality in 1867. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902\u20133 averaged Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 85,000 respectively. The income in 1903\u20134 was Rs. 1,17,000, and the expenditure Rs. 90,000. Of the former, Rs. 44,000 was contributed by Government, and the rest was principally derived from the house and land taxes and tolls, while the chief items of expenditure included conservancy, roads and buildings, and education. The municipal hospital, known as the Sabh\u0101pati Mudaliy\u0101r Hospital, was founded in 1842 and has forty beds. The building was presented by the gentleman whose name it bears. There are two other dispensaries. The industries of Bellary include a small distillery, two steam cotton-presses, and a steam cotton-spinning mill. The latter, established in 1894 and fitted with machinery of the latest pattern, employs 520 hands. The number of spindles is 17,800.\n\nBell\u0101vi.\u2014Town in the Tumk\u016br t\u0101luk of Tumk\u016br District, Mysore,\nsituated in $13^\\circ 25' N.$ and $77^\\circ 1' E.$, 9 miles north-west of Tumk\u016br town. Population (1901), 1,669. A great weekly fair is held here, on which all the surrounding country depends, and which is an important mart for exports. The streets are wide, with uniform shops on either side. The municipality formed in 1870 was converted into a Union in 1904. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 960 and Rs. 700. In 1903-4 they were Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,700 respectively.\n\nBel\u016br.\u2014North-western taluk of Hassan District, Mysore, lying between $12^\\circ 58'$ and $13^\\circ 19' N.$ and $75^\\circ 44'$ and $76^\\circ 7' E.$, with an area of 339 square miles. The population in 1901 was 79,192, compared with 75,470 in 1891. The taluk contains one town, Bel\u016br (population, 3,862), the head-quarters; and 410 villages. The land revenue demand in 1903-4 was Rs. 1,81,000. The west is a part of the Malnad, and for a short distance is bounded by the Hem\u0101vati river. The Yagachi flows through the centre in a south-easterly direction, being joined in the north by the Berinji-halla. In the forests of the hill country to the west are coffee plantations, while rice is grown in the valleys. In the east are rocky hills, either bare or covered with scrub jungle. The centre is more level, with either gravelly and grassy plains, or stretches of rice land. Some small channels are drawn from the Yagachi and the streams falling into it. The soils are poor in the west but improve eastwards, much of the best description being around Halebid and Bel\u016br. In the south-west the high ground, instead of sloping gradually to the lower, drops abruptly in perpendicular scarps 50 to 100 feet high. Good tobacco is grown in the east.\n\nBemet\u0101ra.\u2014Northern tahsil of the new Drug District of the Central Provinces, which was constituted in 1906 from portions of Raipur and Bil\u0101spur. The tahsil lies between $21^\\circ 20'$ and $22^\\circ 0' N.$ and $86^\\circ 43'$ and $82^\\circ 2' E.$, and contains portions of three former tahsils. A tract of 363 square miles was taken from the west of the Mungeh tahsil of Bil\u0101spur; 614 square miles comprised in six zamind\u0101ri estates were transferred from the old Drug tahsil; and 589 square miles were transferred from the Simg\u0101 tahsil of Raipur. The Bemet\u0101ra tahsil is an irregularly shaped tract, nearly cut in two by the Khair\u0101garh State. Its area is 1,566 square miles, and the population of the tract now constituting the tahsil was 240,843 persons in 1901, compared with 290,238 in 1891. The density is 154 persons per square mile, and there are 874 inhabited villages. The head-quarters are at Bemet\u0101ra, a village of 1,197 inhabitants, 47 miles from Drug town by road. It includes the six zamind\u0101ri estates of Sahaspur-Loh\u0101ra, Silheti, Barbaspur, Gandai, Th\u0101kurtol\u0101, and Parpori, with a total area of 614 square miles and a population of 48,327 persons. About 308 square miles in the zamind\u0101ris are forest, but there are no Government Reserves. The western portion of the tahsil\nconsists of a fertile and closely cultivated black soil plain, while in the east the zamind\u0101ri estates border on the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills. The demand for land revenue in 1902\u20133 on the area now forming the tahsil was approximately 1,90 lakhs.\n\n**Benares Division.**\u2014South-eastern Division of the United Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 52\u2032 and 26\u00b0 12\u2032 N. and 82\u00b0 7\u2032 and 84\u00b0 39\u2032 E. The northern portion is traversed by the Ganges and in the east reaches to the Gogra, while the southern extends beyond the Kaimur range and the river Son to the East S\u0101tpur\u0101s. The head-quarters of the Commissioner are at Benares city. Population increased from 1872 to 1891, but fell during the next decade. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 4,395,252, (1881) 5,178,005, (1891) 5,368,480, and (1901) 5,069,020. There is reason to believe that the Census of 1872 understated the actual population. The decrease between 1891 and 1901 was due partly to an epidemic of fever following disastrous floods in 1894, partly to emigration, and partly to the effects of famine. The total area is 10,431 square miles, and the density is 486 persons per square mile, as compared with 445 for the Provinces as a whole. The Districts north of the Ganges include the most thickly populated area in the United Provinces. In 1901 Hindus formed more than 91 per cent. of the total population, and Musalm\u0101ns not quite 9 per cent. There were 2,949 Christians and 1,984 Sikhs. The Division contains five Districts, as shown below:\n\n| Area in square miles | Population, 1901 | Land revenue and cesses, 1903-4, in thousands of rupees |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Benares              | 1,008            | 882,084                                                | 10,45 |\n| Mirz\u0101pur             | 5,238            | 1,082,430                                              | 9,93 |\n| Jaunpur              | 1,551            | 1,202,920                                              | 14,60 |\n| Gh\u0101zipur             | 1,389            | 913,818                                                | 12,10 |\n| Balli\u0101               | 1,245            | 987,768                                                | 8,43 |\n| **Total**            | **10,431**       | **5,069,020**                                          | **55,51** |\n\nThis is the only considerable area in the United Provinces of which the revenue is permanently settled. Balli\u0101 District lies entirely in the Do\u0101b between the Ganges and Gogra, which form its northern and southern boundaries and meet at its eastern extremity. Jaunpur District is situated in the same Do\u0101b, but does not reach either of the rivers. Gh\u0101zipur, Benares, and Mirz\u0101pur lie on both sides of the Ganges; but while the first two Districts are situated entirely in the alluvial plain, Mirz\u0101pur stretches many miles south to the Vindhya and East S\u0101tpur\u0101s. There are 13,654 villages and only 38 towns; and the Division is remarkable for the number of small hamlets in almost every village, contrasting with the closely-packed central village sites of the Western\nDistricts in the United Provinces. The largest towns are: Benares (population, 209,331 with cantonments), Mirzapur (79,862), Jaunpur (42,771), and Ghazipur (39,429). There are few places of commercial importance, the chief being Benares, Mirzapur, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Shahganj, and Ahraur\u0101. Benares is one of the holiest centres of Hinduism, especially to the worshipper of Siva; and some interesting Buddhist remains have survived at Sarnath near it. Jaunpur was the seat of a powerful kingdom during the fifteenth century, and contains fine specimens of the Muhammadan buildings of that period.\n\nBenares District (Ban\u0101ras).\u2014District in the Division of the same name, United Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 8' and 25\u00b0 35' N. and 82\u00b0 40' and 83\u00b0 33' E., with an area of 1,008 square miles. Benares is bounded by Jaunpur and Ghazipur on the north; by the Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District of Bengal on the east; by Mirzapur on the south; and by Jaunpur and Mirzapur on the west. The District is part of the alluvial valley deposited by the river Ganges, and forms an irregular parallelogram, divided by the sacred stream. On each bank of the river is found a high ridge of coarse gravelly soil, mixed with kankar or nodular limestone, and scored by ravines. East of the Ganges the surface dips rapidly, and a large portion of this tract is under water during the rains, and is generally marshy. On the opposite bank the level is more uniformly maintained.\n\nThe Ganges first touches the District on the southern boundary, and after crossing it in a series of bold curves, with a general direction from south-west to north-east, leaves the northern border, at the point where it receives the Gumti, which forms the northern boundary for about 22 miles. Two small streams, the Barn\u0101 and N\u0101nd, drain the area on the left bank of the Ganges. The Karamn\u0101s\u0101 skirts the south-eastern border; it becomes a heavy stream after rain, and is subject to sudden floods, but is almost dry during the hot months. The District contains many small marshy lakes or jhils, some of which attain a length of several miles during the rains, but most of them are almost dry in the summer.\n\nBenares lies entirely in the Gangetic alluvium, and kankar is the only stone found. Saline efflorescences called reh are not uncommon, especially in the Chandauli tahsil.\n\nThe flora of the District presents no peculiarities. The mango and bamboo are largely planted, and fine groves are numerous. Fruit is also largely grown, and Benares is famous for its mangoes and guavas. There is very little jungle.\n\nOwing to the absence of uncultivated land, the wild animals found here are not important. A few antelope are seen north-east of the Ganges and along the Karamn\u0101s\u0101. Wild-fowl congregate in numbers on the rivers and lakes. Fish are caught abundantly in the Ganges.\nThe climate, except in the cold season, is moist and relaxing, and resembles that of Bengal. Even during the winter months the cold is much less marked than in the Districts farther west. In summer, though the heat is great, the west winds blow intermittently; but during the rains a fairly constant east wind prevails. The mean monthly temperature ranges from about $60^\\circ$ in January to $92^\\circ$ in May and June.\n\nThe annual rainfall over the whole District averages nearly 40 inches, varying from 38 in the west to 41 in the east. Fluctuations from year to year are occasionally considerable, but are not so violent as in Districts farther west. In 1876 the fall was only 26 inches, while in 1894 nearly 64 inches were received.\n\nBefore the Muhammadan invasion Benares City was at times the capital of a kingdom; but the records of the early period are vague and unreliable. Tradition relates that aboriginal races, such as the Bhars and Koiris, once held the District; but in the twelfth century they certainly owed allegiance to the R\u0101j\u0101 of Kanauj. Benares fell into the hands of Muhammad Ghori after the defeat of Jai Chand, and a governor was appointed to dispense justice and repress idolatry. In the fifteenth century the District formed part of the separate kingdom of Jaunpur till its fall; and in the struggles of the next century between Mughal and Path\u0101n it suffered much. Under Akbar it was included in the S\u016bbah of Allah\u0101b\u0101d, and enjoyed a period of peace until the eighteenth century, when it shared in the troubles that attended the fall of Mughal power. About 1722 the greater part of the present Benares Division was included in the territory governed by Sa\u0101dat Kh\u0101n, the first Naw\u0101b of Oudh, who sublet it to Mir Rustam Ali. The latter was expelled in 1738; and the grant was transferred to his agent, Mans\u0101 R\u0101m, an ancestor of the present Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, who had already acquired a fort in Jaunpur.\n\nMans\u0101 R\u0101m died in 1739; but his son, Balwant Singh, in whose name the grant had been made and who had received the title of R\u0101j\u0101, successfully followed his father\u2019s policy. Through a long course of years he endeavoured to make himself practically independent of the Naw\u0101b, his lord-paramount, by building or seizing a line of fortresses on a strong strategical base south of the Ganges. Step by step he acquired new strips of territory, and strengthened each acquisition by fresh military works.\n\nIn 1763 the R\u0101j\u0101 joined the emperor, Sh\u0101h Alam, and the Naw\u0101b, Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, in their invasion of Bengal. After the disastrous battle of Buxar, however, he went over to the British camp and prudently sought the protection of the conquerors. By an agreement of 1764, Balwant Singh\u2019s estates were transferred from Oudh to the Company; but the transfer was disapproved by the Court of Directors, and in 1765 the Benares territory was restored to Oudh, the Naw\u0101b consenting to\nguarantee the R\u0101j\u0101 in the quiet enjoyment of his possessions. Balwant Singh died in 1770, and the Naw\u0101b endeavoured to use the opportunity thus afforded him of dispossessing his powerful vassal. The British, however, compelled him to recognize the succession of Chet Singh, an illegitimate son of the late R\u0101j\u0101. Five years later, the Naw\u0101b ceded the sovereignty of the Benares estate to the British, who confirmed Chet Singh in his holding by sanad, dated April 15, 1776.\n\nIn 1778 a contribution of 5 lakhs was levied upon Chet Singh for the maintenance of a battalion of sepoys; similar demands were made in 1779 and 1780. In the latter year, British power in India being then threatened with a simultaneous attack on the part of Haidar Ali, the Niz\u0101m, and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, called upon the R\u0101j\u0101 to furnish a cavalry contingent of 1,500 men. The R\u0101j\u0101 returned evasive answers, but did not send a single trooper. For this conduct Hastings determined to inflict upon him a fine of 50 lakhs. In August, 1781, he arrived in person at Benares, and finding Chet Singh still insubordinate, gave orders that he should be arrested in his own house. A riot occurred, the little body of British troops was attacked and easily overcome, the R\u0101j\u0101 fled to one of his strongholds, and a general rising took place in the city. Hastings, shut up with his slender retinue in Benares, found himself in a most critical position, from which he extricated himself by flight to Chun\u0101r. The R\u0101j\u0101 remained in open rebellion till the end of September, when the British troops dispersed his followers. The Governor-General then returned to Benares, deposed Chet Singh, and recognized his nephew, Mah\u012bp N\u0101r\u0101yan, as R\u0101j\u0101. Chet Singh retired to Gwalior, where he died in 1810. The criminal administration of the whole estate and the civil and criminal administration of the city were taken from the R\u0101j\u0101 and assumed by the Company. For the later history of the family, see Benares Estate. When Wazir Ali, Naw\u0101b of Oudh, was deposed by the British in 1798, he received orders to live at Benares. In January, 1799, he attacked Mr. Cherry, the Governor-General's Agent, and murdered him with two other officers. The Magistrate, whom he proceeded to assail, defended himself in his house till the cavalry arrived from Bit\u0101bar and rescued him. Waz\u012br Ali escaped at the time, but was subsequently given up and confined for life in Calcutta\u00b9.\n\nFrom this period British rule was never seriously disturbed till the Mutiny of 1857. News of the outbreak at Meerut reached Benares on May 15. The 37th Native Infantry at once became disorderly, and it was determined to disarm them on June 1. They replied to the order with a volley; but when it was returned they shortly dispersed. The Sikhs and the Irregular Cavalry joined the mutineers. The civil officers, however, held the mint and the treasury, and the rebellion went\n\n\u00b9 Vizier Ali Khan, or the Massacre of Benares (1844; reprinted at Benares).\nfarther. Parties of Europeans passing up from Calcutta to the north-west sufficed to keep the city quiet, though in the District some disturbances took place. Early in June the Rajputs of Jaunpur marched to attack Benares, but on June 17 they were cut to pieces by a British force. Next day the erection of the fort at R\u0101jgh\u0101t was commenced on a site which commands the whole city, and no breach of the peace afterwards occurred.\n\nAncient remains are found in many places, the oldest being the group of Buddhist ruins at S\u0101rn\u0101th. The famous temples of Benares City are not conspicuous for architectural beauty or for antiquity; and the finest, together with the magnificent line of stone bathing gh\u0101ts along the Ganges, date principally from the eighteenth century.\n\nThe District contains 4 towns and 1,972 villages. Its population increased between 1872 and 1891, and then decreased owing to a series of bad seasons. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 794,039, (1881) 892,684, (1891) 921,943, and (1901) 882,084. It is probable that the Census of 1872 understated the population. There are three tahsils\u2014Benares, Gangapur, and Chandauli\u2014each named from its head-quarters. Benares City is the administrative capital, and Ramnagar, the residence of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, is the only other town of importance. The following table gives the chief statistics of population in 1901:\n\n| Tahsil     | Area in square miles | Number of Towns | Villages | Population | Population per square mile | Percentage of variation in population between 1891 and 1901 | Number of persons able to read and write |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Benares    | 464                  | 2               | 989      | 557,541    | 1,202                     | - 3\u00b79                                                    | 41,757                                 |\n| Gangapur   | 118                  | ...             | 280      | 86,703     | 735                       | - 3\u00b76                                                    | 2,895                                  |\n| Chandauli  | 426                  | 2               | 703      | 237,840    | 558                       | - 5\u00b74                                                    | 8,463                                  |\n| District total | 1,008              | 4               | 1,972    | 882,084    | 875                       | - 4\u00b73                                                    | 53,115                                 |\n\nThe density of population is extremely high, being nearly double that of the United Provinces as a whole. Hindus form more than 89 per cent. of the total, and Musalm\u0101ns more than 10 per cent. The language in common use is Bih\u0101ri, which is spoken by 90 per cent. of the population, while Western Hindi (chiefly Hindust\u0101ni) is spoken by 7 per cent. Owing to its religious reputation, there are large numbers of persons speaking Bengali, Mar\u0101th\u012b, and Gujar\u0101t\u012b in Benares city.\n\nThe most numerous Hindu castes are: Br\u0101hmans, 98,000; Cham\u0101rs (leather-workers and cultivators), 97,000; Kurn\u012bs (agriculturists), 83,000; Ahirs (agriculturists), 81,000; Rajputs, 53,000; and Koir\u012bs (cultivators), 42,000. Among the castes found chiefly in the east of the United Provinces are the high-caste Bhuinh\u0101rs, who claim to be\nBr\u0101hmans, 18,000; Bhars (an aboriginal tribe), 38,000; Luni\u0101s (labourers), 15,000; and Gonds (corresponding to Kah\u0101rs elsewhere), 12,000. Among Muhammadians the castes and tribes chiefly represented are the Jul\u0101h\u0101s (weavers), 28,000; Shaikhs, 26,000; and Path\u0101ns, 10,000. The principal landholders are Br\u0101hmans, Bhuinh\u0101rs, R\u0101jputs, various money-lending castes, and K\u0101yasths. Agriculture supports 57 per cent. of the total population, and general labour 6 per cent.\n\nThere were 669 native Christians in 1901, of whom 380 belonged to the Anglican communion. The Church Missionary Society commenced work here in 1818, and the London Missionary Society two years later. The Baptist and Wesleyan Societies also have branches.\n\nThe characteristic features of the portion of the District east of the Ganges are the absence of drainage and the clay soil in the centre. Rice cultivation is thus more important here than in the tract west of the river, and in ordinary years the spring crops are largely grown without irrigation. In the extreme east the soil turns to m\u0101r, the black soil of Bundelkhand. West of the Ganges the soil is lighter, and not so liable to waterlogging. The whole District is very closely cultivated. In the cold season the spring crops are often liable to attacks of rust.\n\nIn the portion of the District outside the Benares Estate the ordinary tenures are found, zam\u012bnd\u0101ri mah\u0101ls numbering 2,688, and pattid\u0101ri 1,972. Some of the mah\u0101ls are of the variety known as complex, which comprise portions of a number of separate villages. There are also tenants at fixed rates, who have a transferable as well as a heritable right, and under-proprietors called mukarrarid\u0101rs, who hold permanent leases. The main agricultural statistics for 1903-4 are given below, in square miles:\n\n| Tahsil | Total | Cultivated | Irrigated | Cultivable waste |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Benares | 464   | 326        | 159       | 59              |\n| Gang\u0101pur | 118   | 85         | 45        | 14              |\n| Chandauli | 426   | 332        | 89        | 33              |\n| **Total** | **1,008** | **743**    | **293**   | **106**         |\n\nRice and barley are the chief food-crops, covering 162 and 152 square miles respectively, or 25 and 23 per cent. of the net area cropped. Gram (77 square miles) and wheat (60) come next in importance; jow\u0101r, maize, b\u0101jra, and s\u0101w\u0101n are also grown. Maize is a favourite crop in the neighbourhood of the city and near village sites. Sugar-cane was grown on 21 square miles, hemp (san) on 17, and the District also produces poppy and oilseeds.\n\nBetween 1840 and 1880 the total cultivated area (excluding the\nGang\u0101pur (tahsil) increased by only about 4 per cent. The principal change in this period was the replacement of sugar by rice and hemp (saw), and there have been no striking alterations since. As a rule, few or no advances are made under the Loans Acts, but in 1896\u20137 Rs. 7,400 was lent.\n\nThe cattle of the District are very poor, and when better animals are required they are imported. The ponies are also inferior, and there is no peculiar breed of sheep or goats.\n\nIn 1903\u20134, 187 square miles were irrigated from wells and 59 from tanks. The tanks are chiefly natural depressions or jhils, and are used in October and November for rice cultivation, and later for the spring crops and for sugar-cane if the water is not exhausted. Wells can be made in most parts of the District, and are chiefly worked by bullocks. The rivers are hardly used at all for irrigation, as the lowlands in their beds do not require it, and the expense of raising water to a higher level would be prohibitive.\n\nKankar, or calcareous limestone, is the only mineral product, and is used for metalling roads and for making lime.\n\nExcluding the city of Benares, there are few manufactures, and these are confined to the preparation of a few classes of articles for local use, the weaving of coarse cotton cloth being the most important. The city is, however, celebrated for gold and silver jewellery, ornamental brass-work, embroidery, and silk-weaving. It also contains three ice factories, several printing presses, two chemical works, and two brick-making concerns.\n\nThere is little surplus agricultural produce in the District, and oil-seeds are perhaps the most important export. The manufactures of the city are, however, largely prepared for outside markets. The imports include piece-goods, salt, and metals. Benares city is the only trade centre, and absorbs a large part of the produce of the District, while it is the chief place for the distribution of imported goods. Railways have now taken the place of roads as trade-routes, and there is little traffic on the river except the carriage of stone and fuel from Mirzapur.\n\nThe District is exceptionally well served by railways and roads. The main line of the East Indian Railway traverses the eastern portion, and at Mughal Sarai gives off a branch to Gay\u0101 in Bengal. Mughal Sarai is also the terminus of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, which crosses the Ganges by a magnificent bridge, and then divides into two branches at Benares, and serves the western half of the District. Benares is the terminus of a branch of the Bengal and North-Western Railway which runs north. There are 577 miles of road, of which 127 are metalled. The latter are maintained by the Public Works department, but the cost of all but 51 miles is charged to Local funds. The main lines are: the grand trunk road, which traverses the south of the\nDistrict, crossing the Ganges at Benares; and a series of roads radiating from Benares city to Jaunpur, Azamgarh, and Gh\u0101zipur. Avenues of trees are maintained on 262 miles.\n\nBenares District suffers like its neighbours from drought, and from its natural consequence, famine; but it is less severely affected than the regions south or west of it. In 1770 Benares was visited by the famine which devastated Bih\u0101r and Northern Bengal. In 1783, though the dearth was more marked in the western Districts, Hastings described the country from Buxar to Benares as devastated, and serious riots took place. There was little distress in 1803\u20134, though bounties were given to encourage the import of grain from Bengal. The famines of 1837\u20138 and 1860\u20131 were also not felt here severely. High prices caused distress in 1869, in 1874, and in 1877\u20139, but to a much smaller degree than elsewhere. The monsoon of 1896 ceased prematurely, and the important rice crop yielded only one-eighth of the normal. Prices rose very high; but the distress was mainly confined to artisans and those who were unable to labour, and the numbers on the relief works opened did not reach 4,000, though 12,000 persons were in receipt of gratuitous relief.\n\nThe Collector is usually assisted by a member of the Indian Civil Service, and by five Deputy-Collectors recruited in India. A tahsild\u0101r is stationed at the head-quarters of each tahsil.\n\nThe civil courts of the District are those of the Munsif, Sub-Judge, Small Cause Court Judge, and District Judge; but these have no jurisdiction within the Benares Domains in cases which are in any way connected with land. The District Judge is also the Sessions Judge. Murders are not uncommon, and agrarian quarrels often lead to riots. Professional dacoity is rare. The Bhars, Musahars, and Doms of this District commit dacoities in Eastern Bengal. Infanticide was formerly suspected, but no villages are now proclaimed under the Act.\n\nAfter the cession to the British in 1775 the revenue administration was carried on for some years by the R\u0101j\u0101, who paid a fixed subsidy to the British Government. In 1787 Mr. Jonathan Duncan, afterwards Governor of Bombay, was appointed Resident at Benares, and was impressed by the mismanagement and extortion which prevailed. Reforms were commenced in the following year, and a settlement was made in which the annual value of each village was ascertained by applying rates calculated on the average produce. The \u0101mil\u2019s (native collector) fees of 10 per cent. and banker\u2019s dues were deducted, and half the balance was taken as revenue. The term then fixed was four years in part of the District and ten years in the remainder. In 1791\u20132 the Decennial Settlement was extended to the tract where engagements for a shorter period had been taken, and in 1795, with a few revisions,\nthe whole settlement was declared permanent. In 1818 the Districts of Gh\u0101zipur (then including Balli\u0101) and Jaunpur were formed, and in 1830 Benares was still further reduced by the formation of Mirz\u0101pur District. The permanent settlement had not been based on a survey, and no detailed record-of-rights was prepared, engagements being often taken from a few representatives of large bodies of co-sharers. Between 1833 and 1841 a survey was made, field maps were prepared, and detailed records drawn up. A second formal revision was made between 1882 and 1886, since which time annual papers have been prepared as in the rest of the Provinces. The revenue assessed in 1795 on the two tahsils outside the Benares Domains was 7\u00b79 lakhs, which by 1843 had risen to 8\u00b72 lakhs, owing to the assessment of alluvial land and resumption of revenue-free grants. In 1903\u20134 the demand was 7\u00b77 lakhs, and the demand in the Gang\u0101pur tahsil was 1\u00b72 lakhs.\n\nCollections on account of land revenue and total revenue have been, in thousands of rupees:\n\n|                | 1880\u20131 | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 8,95   | 9,02   | 9,04   | 8,98   |\n| Total revenue  | 13,93  | 18,67  | 20,34  | 21,13  |\n\nBenares is the only municipality in the District, but there are two towns administered under Act XX of 1856. Outside of these, local affairs are managed by the District board, which had an income of 1\u00b71 lakhs in 1903\u20134, about one-third of which was derived from local rates. The expenditure on roads and buildings amounted to Rs. 60,000, out of a total expenditure of 1\u00b72 lakhs.\n\nThe District Superintendent of police has a force of 4 inspectors, 121 subordinate officers, and 619 men, distributed in 22 police stations, besides 424 municipal and town police, and 1,460 rural and road police. There is a large Central jail with a daily average of 1,292 prisoners in 1903, while the District jail contained 411.\n\nThe District of Benares contains a higher proportion of persons able to read and write than any other in the United Provinces, except the Him\u0101layan Districts. In 1901, 4\u00b79 per cent. of the population (11\u00b72 males and 0\u00b78 females) were literate. The peculiar conditions of Benares city are largely responsible for this. The number of public institutions fell from 142 with 6,933 pupils in 1880\u20131 to 92 with 5,274 pupils in 1900\u20131. In 1903\u20134 there were 209 such institutions with 12,006 pupils, of whom 1,165 were girls, besides 130 private institutions with 3,471 pupils, including 879 girls. Three colleges and a collegiate school are maintained in Benares City, but the majority of schools are of the primary class. Four schools and colleges are managed by Government, and 118 by the District and Municipal boards. The total\nexpenditure in 1903-4 was 1.3 lakhs, of which Provincial revenues contributed Rs. 58,000, Local funds Rs. 29,000, and fees Rs. 25,000.\n\nThere are 11 hospitals and dispensaries, with accommodation for 330 in-patients. In 1903 the number of cases treated was 124,000, including 3,819 in-patients. The total expenditure was Rs. 27,000, chiefly met from Local funds.\n\nIn 1903-4 the number of persons successfully vaccinated was 26,000, representing a proportion of 28 per 1,000 of population. Vaccination is compulsory only in the municipality and cantonment of Benares.\n\n[District Gazetteer (1884, under revision); F. W. Porter, Survey and Revision of Records in Benares District (1887); A. Shakespear, Selections from the Duncan Records (Benares, 1873).]\n\n**Benares Tahsil.**\u2014Northern tahsil of Benares District, United Provinces, comprising the parganas of Deh\u0101t Am\u0101nat, Kasw\u0101r Sark\u0101r, Pandrah, Katehir, Sult\u0101nipur, Kol Aslah, Athg\u0101nw\u0101n, Shivapur, and J\u0101lhpur, and lying between 25\u00b0 12' and 25\u00b0 35' N. and 82\u00b0 40' and 83\u00b0 12' E., with an area of 464 square miles. Population fell from 580,167 in 1891 to 557,541 in 1901. There are 989 villages and two towns, including Benares City (population, 209,331), the District and tahsil head-quarters. The demand for land revenue in 1903-4 was Rs. 4,94,000, and for cesses Rs. 77,000. The density of population, 1,202 persons per square mile, is considerably above the District average, owing to the inclusion of a large city. The tahsil forms an elevated plain, bounded in part on the south and east by the Barn\u0101 and Ganges, and on the north by the Gumti. The northern portion is also drained by the N\u0101nd, a tributary of the Gumti. The soil is generally a rich loam, and irrigation is provided chiefly by wells, though tanks or jhils serve a small area. In 1903-4 the area under cultivation was 326 square miles, of which 159 were irrigated.\n\n**Benares Estate.**\u2014An estate, usually known as the Family Domains of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Benares, comprising the tahs\u012bls of Gang\u0101pur in Benares District and Korh or Bhadoh\u012b and Chaki\u0101 in Mirz\u0101pur District, United Provinces. The total area is 988 square miles, and the revenue due to Government from Gang\u0101pur and Korh is 3 lakhs, Chaki\u0101 being held revenue-free, while the rent-roll is about 10 lakhs. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 is exempted from the payment of cesses on account of the Domains, and under Act I of 1904 has recently been authorized to collect certain rates which will be applied in the same manner as local rates in ordinary Districts. Besides his Family Domains the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 owns a large area of zamind\u0101ri land in the Districts of Benares, Gh\u0101zipur, Balli\u0101, Jaunpur, Allah\u0101b\u0101d, Mirz\u0101pur, and Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d (Bengal), with a rent-roll of 7 lakhs, paying 3.9 lakhs revenue and Rs. 59,000 cesses. The founder of the family was Mans\u0101 R\u0101m, a Bhuinh\u0101r, who entered the service of Rustam Ali, governor of Benares.\nunder the Naw\u0101b of Oudh. In 1738 Mans\u0101 R\u0101m obtained the engagement for the revenue of the sark\u0101rs of Jaunpur, Chun\u0101r, and Benares in the name of his son, Balwant Singh, on whom the title of R\u0101j\u0101 was conferred. Balwant Singh was subsequently recognized as the zam\u012bnd\u0101r of Gang\u0101pur, and in 1754 he received a revenue-free grant of Chaki\u0101 on payment of Rs. 80,000. Later, on the accession of Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, half the revenues of Korb were granted to him in j\u0101g\u012br. In 1764, after the battle of Buxar, the territory held by Balwant Singh under the Naw\u0101b of Oudh was granted by the emperor to the Company, but the Court of Directors disapproved the treaty and restored the sovereign rights to the Naw\u0101b. Balwant Singh was succeeded in 1770 by Chet Singh; and the sovereignty of the tract under his control was ceded to the Company in 1775. An agreement was made with Chet Singh confirming him in his possessions subject to the payment of revenue. In 1778 the R\u0101j\u0101 was required to pay for the maintenance of three battalions of sepoys, and in 1780 he was further required to pay for cavalry for the general service of the state. Chet Singh manifested great reluctance to meet these demands, and was also believed to be disaffected, and to be holding correspondence with the enemies of the British Government. He was accordingly arrested in August, 1781, by order of Warren Hastings, who had come to Benares; but his retainers collected and cut to pieces the troops guarding the R\u0101j\u0101, and Hastings was compelled to withdraw to Chun\u0101r. A month later, when a sufficient force had been collected, the R\u0101j\u0101's strongholds were reduced, and Chet Singh fled to Gwalior, where he died in 1810. The zam\u012bnd\u0101ri was then granted to Mahip N\u0101r\u0101yan, a grandson of Balwant Singh, at an enhanced revenue; and the criminal administration of the province, as well as the civil and criminal administration of the city of Benares, together with control over the mint, was taken out of the new R\u0101j\u0101's hands. In 1787 Mr. Duncan, the Resident at Benares, called attention to the bad condition of the province, owing to maladministration, and was authorized to carry out a settlement of revenue with the actual landholders, and to institute other reforms. A formal agreement was concluded in 1794, by which the lands held by the R\u0101j\u0101 in his own right were separated from the rest of the province, of which he was simply administrator. The direct control of the latter was assumed by the Government, and an annual income of 1 lakh of rupees was assured to the R\u0101j\u0101, while the former constituted the Domains. Within the Domains the R\u0101j\u0101 has revenue powers similar to those of a Collector in a British District, which are delegated to certain of his own officials. All civil cases which are in any way connected with land, and all rent cases arising within the Domains, are tried in the R\u0101j\u0101's own courts. The Commissioner of the Benares Division is Superintendent of the Domains, and an appeal lies from all decisions of the R\u0101j\u0101's courts to\nthe Superintendent. The Deputy-Superintendent, who is a member of the Indian Civil Service stationed at Mirzapur, exercises most of the powers of the Superintendent, subject to the control of the latter. Appeals lie from the Superintendent or Deputy-Superintendent to the Board of Revenue, which stands in the place of the High Court for such land suits as would be tried by the ordinary civil courts. The tenures in the Domains differ in some respects from those in ordinary British territory. Under-proprietors are called manzirid\u0101rs or mukarrarid\u0101rs; the revenue payable by the former to the R\u0101j\u0101 is subject to revision at a settlement made under his orders, while the latter pay a fixed sum. The tenant rights resemble those of tenants at fixed rates and occupancy tenants in the neighbouring Districts; but the occupancy right is acquired after twenty years instead of twelve, and is transferable by sale, as well as heritable. The present R\u0101j\u0101, Sir Prabhu N\u0101r\u0101yan Singh, G.C.I.E., who succeeded in 1889, holds the personal title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 B\u0101h\u0101dur, and the privilege of being addressed by the title of 'Highness.' He is also authorized to possess 8 cannon and maintain 700 armed retainers.\n\n[Narrative of the Insurrection in the Zemeadary of Banari's (Calcutta, 1782, reprinted at Roorkee, 1853); A.

The city is the second largest in the United Provinces; but its population includes a large number of pilgrims and is liable to considerable fluctuations. The numbers at the last four enumerations were as follows: (1872) 175,188, (1881) 214,758, (1891) 219,467, and (1901) 209,331. In 1901 the population included 153,821 Hindus, 53,566 Musalm\u0101ns, and about 1,200 Christians. The cantonment contained a population of 4,958, included in the figures already given.\n\nThe ancient name of the city of Benares was V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b, the etymology of which is uncertain; its popular derivation from Varan\u0101 (Barn\u0101) and As\u012b, the names of the two small streams which confine the modern city, is, however, untenable. A more recent name, still commonly used by Hindus in all parts of India, is K\u0101si or Kasi, which is possibly taken from the name of a tribe of Aryas, though popularly explained as meaning 'bright.' In the eighteenth century the city was officially known as Mu\u1e25ammad\u0101b\u0101d. The great antiquity of Benares is attested by its mention in both the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101yana; but details of its history are very scanty, and even the Pur\u0101nas record only one dynasty of kings. It was close to Benares, in the deer-park which\nis identified with the country round S\u0101rn\u0101th, that Gautama Buddha commenced to preach. In the seventh century A.D., Hiuen Tsiang found the kingdom of Benares inhabited mostly by Hindus, and only a few followers of the law of Buddha. The city at that time contained twenty Hindu temples, with a gigantic copper image of Siva. It is probable that Benares was sacked by Mahm\u016bd of Ghazni early in the eleventh century, and nearly 200 years later it fell into the hands of Muhammad Ghori. Throughout the Musalm\u0101n period its political importance was slight, and the active cultivation of the Hindu religion was forcibly restrained. In the eighteenth century, as has been shown in the history of Benares District, the city and surrounding country gradually came under the R\u0101j\u0101 of Benares, and finally in 1775 were ceded to the British.\n\nBenares or K\u0101s\u012b is at the present time one of the holiest places to the orthodox Hindu, and attracts great concourses of pilgrims, while many of its inhabitants are persons who have settled there in the hope of salvation through a death within its sacred precincts. The native town lies for four miles along a kankar ridge on the north-west bank of the Ganges, which forms a slightly curved reach below it, thus permitting the eye to take in at a single sweep the long line of picturesque ghats surmounted by irregular buildings of various styles and proportions, the slender white minarets of Aurangzeb's mosque rising high above the general level. For a distance of from one to two miles from the bank the city consists of winding labyrinths and narrow alleys, lined by many-storeyed buildings used as shops or private houses, with innumerable shrines in every part, ranging from a shapeless fragment of stone smeared with vermilion to magnificent temples. R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh of Jaipur is said to have presented 100,000 temples to the city in a single day.\n\nThe ordinary throng of a large city is swollen by the presence of strings of pilgrims being conducted from one to another of the more important shrines, and by the number of sacred bulls which wander about the streets. Along the gh\u0101ts strange figures of religious mendicants and ascetics are to be seen, some superintending the ablutions of the pilgrims in the sacred stream of the Ganges, while others practise devotions or various forms of austerity. Within the city there are many handsome houses substantially built and elaborately decorated; but the narrow, dirty, and crowded environments usually disappoint the visitor, after the high expectations aroused by the view from the river. Even the temples are generally small, and are not more than a few hundred years old. From a religious point of view, the Bisheshwar or Golden Temple, dedicated to Siva, is the most important. Siva in the form of Bisheshwar is regarded as the spiritual monarch of the city, and this is the holiest of all the holy places in the sacred city. It contains\nthe venerated symbol of the god, a plain lingam of uncarved stone. The building is not of striking dimensions and has no great pretensions to beauty, but is crowned by a dome and spire covered with copper, which was gilded at the cost of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Ranjit Singh of Lahore. It was built by Ahaly\u0101 Bai, the Mar\u0101th\u0101 regent of Indore. Subordinate to Bisheshwar is Bhairon\u0101th, who acts as his minister and magistrate.\n\nThe other temples to which pilgrims are specially directed are those of Bhairon\u0101th, and his staff or Dandp\u0101ni, Ganesh or Dhundi R\u0101j, Vindum\u0101dhava or Vishnu, Durg\u0101, and Annpurna. These were chiefly built by Mar\u0101th\u0101s during the seventeenth century, and are all comparatively small. The Durg\u0101 temple is, however, remarkable for its simple and graceful architecture, and is situated in the outskirts on the bank of a large tank. Along the river front the Das\u0101shwamedh, Manikarnik\u0101, and Panchgang\u0101 gh\u0101ts are the most esteemed. At the first of these Brahm\u0101 is said to have performed ten horse-sacrifices. Near the second is situated the famous well, which Vishnu dug with his discus and filled with his sweat, forming one of the chief attractions for pilgrims, thousands of whom annually bathe in the fetid water. The Panchgang\u0101 gh\u0101t is so named from the belief that five rivers meet at it, but the Ganges alone is visible to the gross material eye. R\u0101j\u0101 Jai Singh\u2019s observatory, built in 1693, is a handsome and substantial building overlooking the M\u0101n Mandir gh\u0101t. It includes a number of instruments which have been allowed to fall out of repair. Close by stands the Nep\u0101lese temple, which is ornamented by a series of obscene wooden carvings. The huge mass of Aurangzeb\u2019s mosque, built from the remains of a temple, towers high above a steep cliff over the Panchgang\u0101 gh\u0101t, and is the most conspicuous building in the city when seen from the river. Another mosque, also built on the remains of a temple of Bisheshwar, stands close to the Gy\u0101n B\u0101pi or \u2018well of knowledge,\u2019 where Siva is said to reside. The older buildings and remains are found chiefly in the north and west of the present city, and the ancient site appears to have been situated on both banks of the Barn\u0101. This stream flows into the Ganges about a mile beyond the present northern limit of the city. West of the city lies the suburb of Sigr\u0101, the seat of the chief missionary institutions. Northwards, the Sikraul cantonments and parade-ground stretch away to the bank of the Barn\u0101, which is here crossed by two bridges, of stone and iron respectively. The civil station, including the courts and Central jail, occupies the northern bank. The most noteworthy of the modern buildings are the Mint, the Government College, the Prince of Wales\u2019s Hospital, built by the gentry of Benares in commemoration of the visit of His Majesty to the city in 1876, the police station, and the town hall, a fine building constructed at the expense of a Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 of Vizianagram. Benares is the headquarters of the Commissioner of the Division, who is also a Political\nAgent for the payment of certain pensions; of an Inspector of Schools, and of an Executive Engineer in the Roads and Buildings branch. It contains three male and three female hospitals, besides a lunatic asylum, a leper asylum, a poorhouse, and branches of the Church Missionary, London Missionary, Baptist, and Wesleyan Societies. Some members of the ex-royal family of Delhi reside at Benares in a large building called the Shiv\u0101l\u0101, which was once occupied by Chet Singh.\n\nA municipality was constituted in 1868. During the ten years ending 1901 the income averaged 4.8 lakhs, and the expenditure 5.8 lakhs; the latter, however, included capital expenditure on water-supply and drainage. In 1903\u20134, excluding a loan of 1.5 lakhs, the income was 4.7 lakhs, the chief items being octroi (3 lakhs), water rate (Rs. 83,000), other taxes (Rs. 34,000), and rents (Rs. 30,000). The expenditure amounted to 6.4 lakhs, including repayment of loans and interest (1.1 lakhs), water-supply and drainage (capital, 2.2 lakhs, and maintenance, Rs. 72,000), conservancy (Rs. 70,000), roads and buildings (Rs. 28,000), public safety (Rs. 50,000), and administration and collection (Rs. 40,000). An excellent system of water-works was constructed between 1890 and 1892, which has cost upwards of 26 lakhs. In 1903\u20134 the daily consumption of filtered water amounted to over 16 gallons per head of population, and there were more than 5,000 house-connexions. Water is pumped from the Ganges and filtered before use. An elaborate drainage scheme is still under construction, which is estimated to cost 15 lakhs. It includes a system of sewers, with house-connexions.\n\nThe cantonment is usually garrisoned by British and Native infantry. The receipts and expenditure of the cantonment fund during the ten years ending 1901 averaged Rs. 12,500. In 1903\u20134 the income was Rs. 12,700 and the expenditure Rs. 13,100.\n\nThe wealth of Benares depends largely upon the constant influx of pilgrims from every part of India, whose presence lends the same impetus to the local trade as that given to European watering-places by the season visitors. Some of the pilgrims are R\u0101j\u0101s or other persons of importance, who bring considerable retinues, and become large benefactors to the various shrines and temples. Hindu princes of distant States pride themselves upon keeping up a \u2018town residence\u2019 in holy K\u0101si. The city thus absorbs a large share of the agricultural produce of the District, and it also acts as a distributing centre. Its manufactures include ornamental brass-ware, silk, both plain and embroidered with gold and silver, jewellery, and lacquered wooden toys. The brass-ware has a considerable reputation among Europeans as well as natives. The trade in silk kamkhw\u0101b or kincob, woven with gold and silver, is decreasing as native taste inclines towards European fabrics. A good deal of German-silver work is now turned out in\nBenares, employing a number of workmen who formerly prepared gold and silver wire. This is perhaps the most flourishing industry of the place. The only factories are three ice works, two brickyards, two chemical works, and a few large printing presses.\n\nThe Benares College was opened in 1791, and the fine building in which it is now housed was completed in 1852. It is maintained by Government, and includes a first-grade college with 97 students in 1904, and a Sanskrit college with 427 students. The Central Hindu College, opened in 1898, is affiliated to the Allahabad University up to the B.A. standard. It contained 104 students in the college and 204 in the school department in 1904. It was founded largely through the efforts of non-Indian theosophists, and is intended to combine Hindu religious and ethical training, on an unsectarian basis, with modern Western education. The missionary societies maintain a number of schools for both boys and girls; and the Church Missionary Society is in charge of Jai Narayan's collegiate school, which was founded by a Hindu, after whom it is called, in 1818, and presented to the Society. The same society manages a normal school for female teachers. The municipality maintains fifteen schools and aids seven others, attended by more than 1,300 pupils. Benares has produced a number of Hindu scholars and authors, and was the residence of the celebrated religious teachers Vallabhacharya, Kabir, and Tulsidas, and the nineteenth-century author and critic, Harish Chandra. The Sanskrit college issues a periodical called *The Pandit*, dealing with Sanskrit learning, and a society called the Nagari Pracharini Sabha has recently commenced the publication of ancient vernacular texts. A few newspapers are published, but none of importance.\n\n[Rev. M. A. Sherring, *The Sacred City of the Hindus* (1868).]\n\n**Bendamurlanka.** - Village in Godavari District, Madras. See Bandamurlanka.\n\n**Bengal**\u00b9 (more precisely designated, Lower Bengal). - The largest\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The article was written before the changes were carried out which constituted the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. These were determined upon to lighten the excessive burden imposed upon the Government of Bengal by the increase of population, the expansion of commercial and industrial enterprise, and the growing complexity of all branches of administration. The Province had hitherto comprised an area of nearly 190,000 square miles, with a population of over 78 millions, and a gross revenue amounting to more than 1100 lakhs. In these circumstances, the relief of the Bengal Government had become an administrative necessity, and it was decided that it could be afforded only by actual transference of territory and not by organic changes in the form of government. Accordingly, on October 16, 1905, the Divisions of Dacca, Chittagong, and Rajahahi (except Darjeeling), the District of Malda, and the State of Hill Tippera were transferred to the newly formed Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, the area under the jurisdiction of the Bengal Government being thus reduced by 50,000 square miles and its population by\nand most populous Province in India. It lies between $19^\\circ 15'$ and $28^\\circ 15'$ N. and between $82^\\circ$ and $97^\\circ$ E., and contains four large sub-provinces, Bengal proper, Bih\u0101r, Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and Orissa. The two former comprise the lower plains and deltas of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur is a rugged tract and jungle, broken by deep ravines and river valleys. The greater part of Orissa belongs to the same formation as Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; but along the coast there is a narrow belt of alluvium, formed from the silt deposited by the rivers, which drain the hills as they find their sluggish way to the sea.\n\nThe Province is bounded on the north by Nep\u0101l and Tibet, and by the mighty chain of the Him\u0101layas; on the east by Assam and the continuation of the range of hills which divides Assam from Burma; on the south by the Bay of Bengal and Madras; and on the west by the United and the Central Provinces.\n\nThe whole Province forms a Lieutenant-Governorship with an area\\(^1\\) of 196,408 square miles, of which 84,728 square miles are included in Bengal proper, 44,259 in Bih\u0101r, 24,306 in Orissa, and 43,115 in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. These figures include an unsurveyed tract of swamp and jungle on the fringe of the delta, the extent of which is about 6,600 square miles. Of the total area, 157,796 square miles are British territory, while 38,612 square miles lie in the Native States attached to Bengal: namely, Cooch Beh\u0101r, Sikkim, Hill Tippera*, and the Tributary States of Orissa and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur.\n\nAccording to Hindu legend, king Bali of the Lunar race had five sons, begotten for him on his queen Sudeshn\u0101 by the Rishi Dirghatamas: namely, Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Pundra, and Suhm\u0101. Each of these sons founded a kingdom that was named after him. Vanga\\(^2\\) or Banga is said to have occupied the deltaic tract south of the Padm\u0101, lying between the Bh\u0101girathi and the old course of the\n\n\\(^{25,000,000}\\). The five Hindi-speaking Native States of Jashpur, Surguj\u0101, Udaipur, Kore\u0101, and Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r were at the same time transferred to the Central Provinces; while the District of Sambalpur with the exception of two zamindaris, and also the Oriy\u0101-speaking States of Patu\u0101, K\u0101l\u0101handi or Karond, Sonpur, Bamra, and Rai\u0101kh\u014dl in the Central Provinces, were attached to Bengal. The result of these transfers of territory is that the Province as now constituted comprises an area of 148,592 square miles, with a population of 54,662,529 persons. In order to show the effect of this change in the constitution of the Province, footnotes have been added, wherever possible, giving statistics for the new area; and the States, Divisions, Districts, and towns transferred from Bengal have been indicated by asterisks.\n\n\\(^1\\) Of the total area of 148,592 square miles now included in Bengal, 35,576 square miles are in Bengal proper (including 5,700 square miles in the Sundarbans\\(^1\\)), 43,524 square miles are in Bih\u0101r, 41,789 in Orissa, and 27,703 in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. Altogether, 115,819 square miles are British territory and 32,773 square miles are Native States.\n\n\\(^2\\) The word Vanga first appears as the name of a country in the \u0100itareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka (2\u20131\u20131), where its inhabitants are represented as eaters of indiscriminate food, and as progenitors of many children.\nBrahmaputra, and to have been conquered by the P\u0101ndava Bh\u012bm and also by Raghu. The inhabitants of this region are described in the Raghubansa as living in boats, and as growing transplanted rice for their staple crop. In the time of Ball\u0101l Sen the tract immediately to the east of the Bh\u0101girathi was called B\u0101gri, and Banga occupied the eastern portion of the delta. The tract west of the Bh\u0101girathi was known as R\u0101rh, which in Pr\u0101krit was softened to L\u0101la. Possibly Bengal or Bang\u0101la is a combination of Banga L\u0101la, and, in any case, there can be no doubt that the word is connected with the ancient Vanga. During the period of Muhammadan rule the term was applied specifically to the whole delta, but later conquests to the east of the Brahmaputra and north of the Padm\u0101 were eventually included in it. Under the British the name has at different times borne very different significations. All the north-eastern factories of the East India Company, from Balasore on the Orissa coast to Patna in the heart of Bih\u0101r, belonged to the 'Bengal Establishment,' and as its conquests crept higher up the rivers, the term continued to be the designation of the whole of its possessions in Northern India. From the time of Warren Hastings to that of Lord William Bentinck, the official style of the Governor-General was 'Governor-General of Fort William in Bengal.' In 1836, when the Upper Provinces were formed into a separate administration, they were designated the North Western Provinces, in contradistinction to the Lower Provinces; and although they, as well as Oudh, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, and Burma, were sometimes loosely regarded as forming the Bengal Presidency, the word was ordinarily used in this sense only for military purposes, to denote the sphere of the old army of Bengal, as distinguished from those of Bombay and Madras. In its ordinary acceptation, the term now covers only the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. The term 'Bengal proper' has a still more restricted meaning, and indicates, roughly speaking, the country east of the Bh\u0101girathi and Mah\u0101nand\u0101, where the prevalent language is Bengali.\n\nBengal contains tracts of very different physical features, including the alluvial plains of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and the deltas of those rivers, which form the greater part of Bih\u0101r and Bengal proper; the crystalline plateau of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, including the Tributary States of Orissa, and the hills stretching to the Ganges at R\u0101jmah\u0101l; the narrow strip of alluvium comprising Orissa; and lastly, a small portion of the sub Him\u0101layas, the Sikkim State, and a tract which once belonged to Sikkim but now forms the main part of Darjeeling District. It is thought that there was formerly a continuous chain connecting the R\u0101jmah\u0101l range with the remains of the 'peninsular system,' still in existence in Assam, and that their subsidence was due to the\nsame disturbances that resulted in the elevation of the Himalayas. The hollow thus formed has been filled in by the fluvial deposits of the Himalayan rivers; but the gradual raising of the surface has been, to a great extent, discounted by fresh subsidences, which have been accompanied by upheavals elsewhere. However this may be, the uplands of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur date from a very ancient period, while the Himalayas were thrown up at a time which, from a geological point of view, is comparatively recent, and the alluvium in the greater part of Bengal proper has been deposited at a much later date than that in the Bih\u0101r plain west of R\u0101jmah\u0101l.\n\nThe sub-province of Bih\u0101r occupies the north-western quarter of Bengal. It is divided by the Ganges into two parts\u2014north and south. North Bih\u0101r is a level plain falling very gradually from the foot of the Himalayas, and with a belt of fairly high land along the bank of the Ganges. Between these two extremes the general elevation is lower, and considerable areas are liable to damage by floods. The soil consists mainly of the older alluvium or b\u0101ngar, a yellowish clay, with frequent deposits of kankar; but in many parts this has been cut away by the torrents that rush down from the Himalayas, and the lowland, through which these rivers have at one time or another found an exit to the Ganges, is composed of more recent deposits of sand and silt brought down by them when in flood. In South Bih\u0101r the effects of recent fluvial action are less marked, especially towards the east, where the outlying hills and undulations of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau trench more and more upon the Gangetic plain until, at Monghyr, they extend as far as the river itself, and offer an effectual opposition to the oscillations in its course which the more yielding alluvial soil is unable to prevent elsewhere. The Bih\u0101r of our administration contains two tracts which do not properly belong to it. The Sant\u0101l Parganas in its physical and ethnic features is an integral part of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, while M\u0101lda* and the eastern part of Purnea belong to Bengal proper.\n\nThe latter sub-province naturally subdivides itself into four distinct parts. West Bengal, or the part west of the Bh\u0101girathi, lies outside the true delta. The eastern portion of this tract is low and of alluvial formation; but farther west laterite begins to predominate, and the surface rises and becomes more and more undulating and rocky, until at last it merges in the uplands of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. Central Bengal, or the part lying south of the Padm\u0101, between the Bh\u0101girathi on the west and the Madhum\u0101ti on the east, was formerly the Ganges delta; but it has gradually been raised above flood-level, and the great rivers which formerly flowed through it, depositing their fertilizing silt, yielding an ample supply of wholesome drinking-water, and draining it, have shrunk to insignificance. Their mouths have silted up and their banks are\noften higher than the surrounding country, which they are no longer able to drain. East Bengal, or the country east of the Madhumati, includes the present delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, where the process of land-formation is still going on; but in the south-east the hill range that divides Assam from Burma projects into it, while on the confines of Dacca* and Mymensingh* the Madhupur Jungle*, a tract of quasi-laterite, rises above the recent alluvium. North Bengal lies north of the Padma and is wholly alluvial, with the exception of the Himalayan State of Sikkim, the greater part of the District of Darjeeling, and an elevated tract known as the B\u0101rind*, similar to the Madhupur jungle, which occupies a considerable area on the confines of Dinajpur*, M\u00e1lda*, R\u0101jsh\u0101hi*, and Bogra*. In spite of its proximity to the hills, the general level of the alluvial country is very low, especially in Cooch Beh\u0101r, Rangpur*, and the central part of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi*: and it suffers from obstructed drainage, due to the silting-up of the rivers and the gradual raising of their beds.\n\nThe plains of Orissa are a flat alluvial tract of which the centre and south comprise the delta of the Mah\u0101nadi, and the north has been formed by the fluvial deposits of the rivers which drain the southern flank of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. Behind these plains rises a belt of hills, which gradually merge in the rocky uplands of the Tributary States.\n\nChot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, with the Sant\u0101l Parganas and the Tributary States of Orissa, belongs throughout to the same geological formation. On the whole, the level rises gradually towards the north and west, but some of the highest peaks are in the south.\n\nThe main axis of the Himalayas skirts the northern boundary of Sikkim, dividing it from Tibet; but one of the loftiest mountains in the world, Kinchinjunga (28,146 feet), lies within Sikkim, and three outliers project far into the plains of Bengal. The Sing\u0101lil\u0101 range strikes southward from Kinchinjunga in 88\u00b0 E., and forms the boundary between Nep\u0101l and Darjeeling, its highest peaks being Sing\u0101lil\u0101 (12,130 feet), Sandakph\u016b (11,930 feet), Phal\u016bt (11,811 feet), and Sabargam (11,636 feet), and the connected ranges and spurs covering the greater part of Darjeeling District. Fifty miles to the eastward, the Chola range runs southward from the Dongkya peak (23,190 feet), and divides Sikkim from Tibet and Bhutan on the east; it is pierced by the Jelep La Pass, at 14,390 feet, and separates the basin of the Tista on the west from that of the Tors\u0101 on the east. At Gipmochi (the tri-junction point of the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet boundary) this range bifurcates into two great spurs; one runs to the south-east and the other to the south-west, including between them the valley of the Jaldh\u0101k\u0101. From Chumalhari (23,933 feet) another great ridge strikes south through Bhutan between the basins of the Tors\u0101 (the Chumbi Valley).\nand Raid\u0101k rivers, terminating in the Sinchula hills which form the boundary between Jalpaiguri District* and Bhutan. The sub-Himalayan zone is represented by the Someswar hills (2,270 feet), which form the boundary between Champaran District and Nep\u0101l.\n\nThe Chot\u0101 Nagpur plateau is contiguous to the Vindhyan system and attains an elevation of 2,000 feet. There are in reality three separate plateaux divided by belts of rugged hill and ravine; and a confused mass of hills fringes the plateaux, extending in the R\u0101jmah\u0101l Hills and at Monghyr north-east to the Ganges, and southwards over the Orissa Tributary States, while outlying spurs project far into the plains of South Bih\u0101r and West Bengal. Parasn\u0101th (4,480 feet) in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh District is the loftiest of these spurs, and the Saranda hills in Singhbhum rise to 3,500 feet.\n\nOn the south-eastern frontier a succession of low ranges running north and south covers the east of the Chittagong Division* and Hill Tippera*. The S\u012bt\u0101kund* hill rises to 1,155 feet; but the ranges in the Chittagong Hill Tracts* attain a greater altitude, the highest peaks being Keokr\u0101dang (4,034 feet) and Pyramid hill (3,017 feet).\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the Province is its network of rivers\u2014the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, with their affluents and distributaries. These rivers are of use in many ways. They furnish an admirable and cheap means of transport; they contain an inexhaustible supply of fish; and they bring down vast quantities of fertilizing silt, which they distribute over the surface of the delta. The Ganges, which enters on the western frontier, flows almost due east, with numerous oscillations, as far as R\u0101jmah\u0101l, where it escapes from the restraining influence of the hard rocks of the Chot\u0101 Nagpur formation and enters the loose alluvium of Bengal proper. Until some 400 years ago, its subsequent course was due south, down the channel of the Bh\u0101girathi. By degrees this channel silted up and became unequal to its task, and the main stream of the Ganges was thus obliged to seek another outlet. In this way the Ich\u0101mat\u012b, the Jalangi, and the Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga became in turn the main stream. The river tended ever eastwards, and at last, aided perhaps by one of those periodic subsidences of the unstable surface of the country to which reference has already been made, it broke eastwards, right across the old drainage channels, until it was met and stopped by the Brahmaputra. The river, below the point where the Bh\u0101girathi leaves it, is known as the Padma.\n\nHaving its source at no great distance from that of the Ganges, but on the other side of the Himalayas, the Brahmaputra flows eastwards through Tibet, where it is known as the Tsan-po, until it reaches a point due north of the eastern extremity of Assam, when it takes a southerly course and, threading its way through the Eastern Himalayas, emerges in the plains of Assam. It then turns westwards and, after traversing\nthe Assam Valley, enters Bengal from the north-east. It formerly followed the contour of the Garo Hills and, bisecting the District of Mymensingh*, joined the Meghn\u0101, or the united channel of the rivers which drain the Surm\u0101 Valley and the surrounding hills of the Assam range and Lushai. This is the course shown on the maps of Rennell's survey in 1785; and it was not till the beginning of the nineteenth century that, having raised its bed and lost its velocity, it was no longer able to hold its own against the Meghn\u0101, and suddenly broke westwards. Its new course runs due south from Dhubri and joins the Padm\u0101 near Goalundo*. From this point these two great rivers travel down a common channel and vie with each other in depositing their silt in the eastern corner of the delta, where the land area is now being rapidly thrust forward. They discharge into the Bay of Bengal down the Meghn\u0101 estuary.\n\nAlong the northern frontier of Bengal numerous rivers debouch from the Him\u0101layas. There are reasons for supposing that formerly, when the Ganges and the Brahmaputra were still 150 miles apart, many of them united to form a great independent river which flowed southwards to the sea, sometimes east of the B\u0101rind down the channel of the Karatoy\u0101, and sometimes west of it by way of the Mah\u0101n\u0101nda. It has been suggested that the Haringh\u0101ta was the original estuary of the Karatoy\u0101 and its affluents, and it is possible that the Bhairab was the ancient channel of the Mah\u0101nand\u0101. Its tortuous course can still be traced on both sides of the Jalangi and the Mat\u0101bh\u0101nga: and it is only near the Padm\u0101, almost opposite the point where the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 flows into it, that all upward traces of this old river disappear. At the present time the chief Him\u0101layan tributaries of the Ganges in this Province are the Gandak, the Kosi, and the Mah\u0101nand\u0101, while the Tista\u2014the modern representative of the Karatoy\u0101\u2014is an affluent of the Brahmaputra. On its right bank the Ganges receives the Son from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; and its ancient channel, the Bh\u0101girathi, which, in the latter part of its course, is called the Hooghly, is augmented from the same direction by the waters of the Damodar and the R\u016bpn\u0101kay\u0101n. Farther south, in Orissa, several rivers, draining the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, find an exit to the sea independently of the great fluvial system described above. Of these the chief are the Subarnarekh\u0101, Baitarani, Br\u0101hm\u0101ni, and Mah\u0101nadi.\n\nIn a level alluvial country like Bengal, where the soil is composed of loose and yielding materials, the courses of the rivers are constantly shifting; land is cut away from one bank and thrown up on the other, and the definition and regulation of the alluvial rights of the riparian proprietors, and of the state, form the subject of a distinct branch of Anglo-Indian jurisprudence.\n\nIn spite of the dead level and the consequent absence of variety, the\nscenery of Bengal proper and Orissa has a distinct charm of its own. Even in the dry months the groves of bamboos and of mango, areca and coco-nut palm, tamarind, *pipal* and other trees, in which the homestead lands of the people are buried, afford a profusion of green vegetation very restful to the eye, while in the rains, from the time when the young rice seedlings cover the ground with a delicate green sward until December, when the golden heads of the mature plants fall before the sickle, the landscape verges very closely on the beautiful. In South Bih\u0101r, the village sites are, for the most part, devoid of trees, and the houses are crowded together in inartistic confusion. Except for occasional mango groves and the trees on the steeper hills or along some of the main roads, there is very little vegetation when the crops are off the ground, and the prospect is bare and arid, until the rains cause the maize, millets, and early rice to germinate. In North Bih\u0101r trees are more plentiful, though much less so than in Bengal proper. The Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau is a tangled mass of rock and forest. The outlook is always diversified, and from the higher points magnificent views are obtained.\n\nIn their upper reaches the rivers have a rapid flow and carry away the soil; but when they enter the level flats of Bengal proper, their speed is reduced, and their torpid current is no longer able to support the solid matter hitherto held in suspension. They accordingly deposit it in their beds and on their banks, which are thus raised above the level of the surrounding country, until at last the river breaks through to the adjacent lowland and makes for itself a new bed, where it repeats the process. Great marshes or *bils* are often found within the enclosures thus formed by the high banks of rivers. These are generally connected with the outside rivers by *kh\u0101ls* or drainage channels; but, owing to the tendency of all watercourses to silt up, they remain open only so long as the difference of level between the water in the basin and that outside is sufficiently great to maintain a flow which gives an efficient scour. The natural tendency of these swamps is to fill up; in the rainy season the rivers drain into them and deposit their silt, and decayed vegetable matter also gradually accumulates. In this way, but for the vagaries of the rivers and fresh subsidences of the surface, the irregularities in elevation would in course of time disappear. These marshes are met with all over Bengal proper; but they are especially numerous in the south of Far\u012bdpur* and the west and north-west of Backergunge*, where the whole country is a succession of basins, full of water in the rains, but partially or wholly dry in the winter months. The largest of these depressions is the Chalan B\u012bl*, lying partly in R\u0101jsh\u0101hi* and partly in P\u0101bna*, which has a water area varying from about 20 square miles in the dry season to 150 in the rains. The average depth of water during the dry season is about 3 feet; a tortuous navigable\nchannel runs through it, with a depth of from 6 to 12 feet all the year round. In Bih\u0101r the number of these marshes is comparatively small, and they usually dry up during the cold season. The only lakes, properly so called, are found in Champ\u0101ran, where a chain of them (forty-three in number), covering an area of 139 square miles, runs through the centre of the District, marking the old bed of some extensive river which has now taken another course.\n\nThe largest lake, if such it can be called, in the whole Province is the Chilka, in the south of Orissa, a pear-shaped expanse of water, 44 miles long, with an area varying at different seasons from 344 to 450 square miles. It was once doubtless a gulf of the sea, protected on the south by a barren spur of hills and on the north by the alluvial formation deposited by the Mah\u0101nadi and other rivers. These two promontories are now joined by a bar of sand, thrown up by the winds of the south-west monsoon, which is steadily growing in breadth. Early in the nineteenth century the only opening had silted up, and an artificial mouth had to be cut, which still connects it with the sea. From December to June the water is salt; but when the rivers which feed it are in flood, the salt water is gradually driven out, and it becomes a fresh-water lake. It is slowly filling up, and its average depth is now only 3 to 5 feet.\n\nThe process of land-formation, which is active along the shores of the Bay of Bengal, forms numerous islands, which tend to join the mainland as the intermediate channels silt up; many of them are, however, still separated from the shore by broad channels. Sagar Island, off the mouth of the Hooghly, has for centuries been famous as the scene of an annual bathing festival, at the point where the sacred Ganges merges its waters in the Bay. Dakhin Sh\u0101h\u0113zpur*, at the mouth of the Meghn\u0101, is the largest of the islands formed by the silt-laden waters of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, which have also created Sandw\u012bp* and H\u0101tia*; the former was long notorious as a nest of the Portuguese and Arakanese pirates who harried the coasts of Bengal in the seventeenth century. Kutubdi\u0101* is an alluvial island off the Chittagong* coast which has also been formed by deposits of silt washed down from the Meghn\u0101; the adjacent island of Maiskh\u0101l* has a backbone of low hills which rise abruptly from the sea.\n\nThe coast-line of the Bay of Bengal is everywhere alluvial, and the harbours are situated up the rivers which until recently carried all the commerce of the country. Calcutta, 80 miles from the mouth of the Hooghly, absorbs almost the entire trade of the Province, the value of its imports and exports in 1903\u20134 having been 113 crores, or 75 millions sterling, out of a total for all Bengal of rather less than 118 crores. Of the entire volume of its trade 101 crores is with foreign ports.\n\nChittagong*, 12 miles up the Karnaphuli river, on the east side of\nthe Bay, is a much older port than Calcutta, but has until lately served a very limited area, the principal business having been the shipment of jute carried in brigs from N\u0101rayanganj*. The Assam-Bengal Railway has now connected it with the Assam Valley, of which it promises to become the principal outlet. The value of its imports and exports in 1903\u20134 was 4 crores or nearly 3 millions sterling. The Orissa ports include Balasore, False Point, and Pur\u012b; but their trade is declining owing to the competition of the East Coast Railway, and it was valued in 1903\u20134 at only 83 lakhs.\n\nAs has already been stated, the greater part of the plains of Bengal is covered by alluvium. Little is known of the hills in the Chittagong Hill Tracts* and Hill Tippera*, except that they are composed of Upper Tertiary rocks, and geological interest is confined to the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau and to the portion of the Him\u0101layas contained in Darjeeling and Sikkim.\n\nGneissic rocks form the nucleus of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, and are fringed on all sides by transition rocks, and freely interbedded with micaceous, siliceous, and hornblendic schists. The transition or sub-metamorphic rocks form groups of isolated hills in South Bih\u0101r, known as the R\u0101jgir, Sheikhpur\u0101, Kharakpur,* and Gidhaur hills; and similar transition rocks are found in parts of M\u0101nbh\u016bm, Singhbh\u016bm, and R\u0101nchi Districts. The transition rocks carry metalliferous lodes of gold, silver, copper, and lead, but so far none of these have proved remunerative.\n\nSandstones, shales, and limestones belonging to the Sasar\u0101m Vindhyan system occur near Roht\u0101sgarh in Sh\u0101hab\u0101d District.\n\nThe Gondw\u0101na system contains coal-bearing strata, and is represented in the R\u0101jmah\u0101l Hills, the D\u0101modar valley, in several of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Districts, and in Orissa. At the base of this system lies the T\u0101lcher group of shale and sandstone, and above it the Karharb\u0101ri sandstones, grits, and conglomerates, with seams of coal. This is superposed by the D\u0101modar series, which comprises in ascending order the Bar\u0101kar group, ironstone shales, and the R\u0101niganj beds. The Bar\u0101kars consist of conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and coal; and above them, in the R\u0101niganj and a few other coal-fields of the D\u0101modar valley, there is found a great thickness of black or grey shales, with bands and nodules of clay ironstone. The R\u0101niganj beds comprise coarse and fine sandstones, with shales and coal-seams.\n\nLaterite (a porous argillaceous rock much impregnated with iron peroxide) is well developed on the west coast, and is traced northward from Orissa, through Midnapore, Burdw\u0101n, and Birbh\u016bm, to the flanks of the R\u0101jmah\u0101l Hills, where in places it is as much as 200 feet thick.\n\nGneiss of the well-foliated type, frequently passing into mica schist, constitutes the greater portion of the Darjeeling Him\u0101layas; but sub-\nmetamorphic or transition rocks, known as the D\u0101ling series, are well represented in the Tista and the Rangit valleys, and in the outer hills south of Kurseong, while sandstones, conglomerates, and clays, referable to the Upper Tertiary period, occur as a narrow band fringing the base of the Him\u0101layas. Intervening between the sub-metamorphics and the tertiaries there is a thin belt of Lower Gondw\u0101na rocks, which includes various alternations of sandstones or quartzite, shales, slates, and beds of friable coal.\n\nThe vegetation of Bih\u0101r and Bengal proper is \u2018diluvial\u2019: i.e. it is of the kind usually found in or near places liable to inundation, and most of the species, both wild and cultivated, if not cosmopolitan, are widespread in the eastern tropics. In Bih\u0101r the older alluvium, with mainly annual turf, has the crops and weeds of Upper India. Inundated tracts near rivers are often under tamarisk. Village shrubberies, except on abandoned sites, are scanty, and the forests in the south are open and park-like. Bengal proper has perennial turf. Except in the extreme north the forests are often mixed with reedy grasses, which are sometimes replaced by savannahs. The river-beds are wide and often bare. East of the Bh\u0101girathi the country is for the most part a half-aquatic rice plain, with patches of jungle on river banks, and shrubberies of semi-spontaneous species on the raised ground found near habitations and roadways. The marshes, pools, and sluggish streams are filled with water-plants. These conditions become intensified eastwards in the b\u012bls, which are rice swamps in the dry season but become inland fresh-water seas with grassy floating islets during the rains; and still more so in the Sundarbans, where the partially-submerged muddy islands lying among interlacing brackish creeks are densely covered with Malayan shore forest and mangrove swamps. The hills on the extreme south-east are covered with forest, Indo-Chinese in character, without s\u0101l (Shorea robusta), but with gurjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus), unknown elsewhere.\n\nIn the north the flora gradually changes from tropical to Him\u0101layan. The lower ranges and the tarai beneath are covered with dense forest. On sandy or gravelly soils, the s\u0101l is the typical tree, while in marshy tracts the g\u0101b (Diospyros Embryopteris) and other like species are found. A similar forest skirts and ascends the hills of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. The high lands above have a vegetation which is mainly of the Central Indian type, but that on the more elevated peaks is sub-temperate. The Orissa rice plain resembles that of Bengal proper. Except in the delta of the Mah\u0101n\u0101di, which is occupied by a mangrove swamp, it is separated from the sea by sand-dunes covered with Coromandel coast plants.\n\nIn ancient times Bengal was the home of numerous wild animals, and the elephant, rhinoceros, and wild buffalo frequented the dense\njungles which have long since given place to cultivation. These animals have now disappeared from all but the most remote tracts, such as the Sundarbans and the jungles of Chittagong*, Jalpaiguri*, and the Orissa Tributary States. Practically the only large game remaining are tigers, leopards, bears, deer, and wild hog. Tigers are comparatively scarce, but still do a great deal of damage in some Districts; leopards, deer, and wild hog are common in many parts; and bears abound wherever there are rocky hills. Owing possibly to the absence of suitable grazing, the domestic animals are of an inferior stamp. The cattle are small and weakly, and the buffaloes also are a very degenerate breed compared with the wild stock from which they are descended.\n\nAlthough Bengal is situated almost entirely outside the tropical zone, its climate for about two-thirds of the year, i.e. from the middle of March to the end of October, is of the kind usually characterized as tropical; it has a high temperature and humidity, and a dry and a wet season. During the other months the temperature is much lower, the humidity is slight or moderate, and the rainfall is generally scanty. The mean temperature during the cold-season months is about $64^\\circ$ and during the hot season about $83^\\circ$. About the beginning of March, as the sun gains a higher altitude and the days grow longer, the temperature increases rapidly. The process is aided, in the greater part of Bengal proper and Orissa, by moisture-laden southerly winds from the Bay of Bengal, which give a fairly copious rainfall when weather is disturbed\\(^1\\), while in Bih\u0101r and part of North Bengal hot and dry westerly winds are prevalent in the daytime, but die away at night. From about the middle of May the south-west wind-current steadily strengthens, and, being diverted northwards by the mountain range on the western side of Burma, causes increasing rainfall in East Bengal. By the middle of June, in normal years, the monsoon has attained its full strength, and, flowing northwards, is checked and turned westwards by the Him\u0101layan range. The moist current in its northward course is the cause of heavy rainfall near the coast and in the eastern Districts. Farther west the rainfall is more intermittent, and is due more to the cyclonic disturbances which develop at short intervals of two or three weeks in the north-west angle of the Bay and in Lower Bengal. These invariably move westwards, and in passing over the western Districts cause continuous and occasionally very heavy rainfall for several days at a time. From the beginning of September the south-west monsoon begins to fall off in strength. Cloud and rainfall are more intermittent, and are generally due to cyclonic storms, which begin to move more to the north and north-east than to the west. Temperature increases owing to the longer intervals of bright sunshine. Before the end of October\n\n\\(^1\\) The local hot-season storms are known as 'nor'-westers.' They are generally accompanied by heavy rain and occasionally by hail.\nthe south-west monsoon has ceased to affect the Province; and, as during the latter half of that month pressure becomes higher in Bengal than over the Bay, northerly winds begin to set in. Being land winds, they carry but a small amount of moisture, and coming from the colder region in the north, their advent is followed by an immediate fall of temperature. Hence, during the months from November to February, fine dry weather, with an almost entire absence of cloud and rainfall, prevails in all parts of the Province. Occasional disturbances originating in, or proceeding from, the north-west of India pass from west to east over Bengal in January and February. The cyclonic winds which they cause are followed by the formation of general cloud, with irregular, but at times heavy, rainfall.\n\nExcluding the Darjeeling hills, where the mountain slopes cause an annual rainfall varying from 209 inches at Buxa* to 122 inches at Darjeeling, the areas of greatest precipitation are in the south-east, where the rainfall ranges between 100 and 140 inches. In the rest of East Bengal it is between 70 and 80 inches, but again rises in North Bengal to 84 inches in Rangpur*, and to between 100 and 130 inches in the submontane plains. In the coast Districts of Central and West Bengal and in Orissa, where the effect of cyclonic storms from the Bay is chiefly felt, the annual fall is generally from 60 to 70 inches, but in places it exceeds 80 inches. In the other Districts of Bengal proper, and in the east of Bihar, where the influence of mountain ranges and cyclonic storms is less apparent, the rainfall is lighter and more uniform, being generally between 50 and 60 inches. Farther west it diminishes to 45 inches in Chota Nagpur and to 42 inches in South Bihar. In the submontane tracts of North Bihar the annual fall varies from 50 to 55 inches.\n\nThe rainfall depends largely upon local conditions, and the fluctuations are irregular; but generally it was very deficient in 1873, in 1883 and 1884, and in 1895 and 1896. The most marked deficiency was in 1873, when the fall was only between 50 and 60 per cent. of the normal. Heavy rainfall occurred throughout the Province in the years 1876, 1886, and 1899; in other years heavy local falls occurred, e.g. in Lower Bengal in 1893 and 1900. If the variability be shown by the absolute range, that is, the difference between the heaviest and lightest rainfall on record expressed as a percentage of the normal, we find that it is greatest in the north-west of the Province and diminishes southward and eastward. In Bihar it is 108, in Chota Nagpur 87, in Orissa 87, in the central Districts 83, and in North and East Bengal about 72.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features of the rainfall of Bengal is the occasional occurrence of excessive local precipitation. Thus, on September 25, 1899, a fall of 19\u00bd inches was registered in Darjeeling, causing numerous landslips and some loss of life. The natural effect\nof a heavy downpour is to cause the rivers to rise and overflow their banks, especially the rivers flowing from the Him\u0101layas, which collect the rain-water more rapidly than do those in the plains. The most disastrous flood of this nature on record occurred in 1787, when the Tista suddenly burst its banks and spread itself over the whole District of Rangpur*. It is estimated that the direct loss of life due to drowning, and the indirect mortality on account of famine and disease, amounted to one-sixth of the entire District population. In the case of non-Him\u0101layan rivers, the liability to damage is greatest where embankments have been thrown up to hold the river to its course. The effect of these embankments is that the water, which is flowing at a higher level than the surrounding country, suddenly rushes over them instead of rising gradually, as it would do if there was no embankment. Consequently, when a breach occurs, the water pours over the lower land beyond and does immense damage. In 1885, and again in 1890, when the great Lalit\u0101kuri embankment of the Bh\u0101girathi gave way, the flood-water swept right across Murshid\u0101b\u0101d and Nadi\u0101 Districts for a distance of more than 50 miles.\n\nThe Province suffers even more from cyclones, especially on the sea-coast of East Bengal, where they often cause an inundation of salt water. The most striking features in these cyclones are the great barometric depression in the centre and the magnitude of the storm area. These two causes produce a large accumulation of water at and near the centre, which progresses with the storm and gives rise to a destructive storm-wave when the centre reaches a gradually shelving coast. This conjunction of adverse circumstances occurs more or less regularly at intervals of ten or twelve years. The worst of the recent calamities of this nature was in 1876, when a great part of Backergunge* and the adjoining Districts was submerged to a depth of from 10 to 45 feet. Nearly 74,000 persons were drowned in Backergunge* alone, and the cholera epidemic which followed carried off close on 50,000 more. On October 24, 1897, Chittagong District* was devastated by a similar but more local catastrophe; 14,000 persons were drowned and nearly three times that number died of the diseases that followed. Tidal waves have more than once caused great damage to the shipping in the Hooghly; and although Calcutta itself is so far from the sea, it is by no means certain that it is beyond the reach of a bore of exceptional height and momentum. Great damage is occasionally caused by cyclones on the sea-coast of Orissa, and in 1885 a considerable area in Cuttack and Balasore was inundated and large numbers of human beings and cattle were drowned.\n\nIn the earlier part of this article reference has been made to the probability that in the distant past the surface of Bengal had been greatly affected by changes of elevation. Small earth tremors are still\nof constant occurrence, and on at least seven occasions in the past 150 years\u2014in 1762, 1810, 1829, 1842, 1866, 1885, and 1897\u2014earthquakes of considerable severity have taken place. By far the worst of these was that of June 12, 1897. Its focus is believed to have been somewhere near Cherrapunji in the Assam range, but it travelled with such rapidity that it reached the western extremity of Bengal in six minutes or even less. The violence of the shock in this Province was greatest in the Districts bordering on Assam, and it was comparatively slight west of the Bh\u0101girathi. In North and East Bengal most of the older masonry buildings fell or were severely damaged, and even in Central Bengal a considerable proportion of the larger buildings suffered. Some of the older ones collapsed altogether and many others were rendered unfit for occupation. In the alluvial tracts near Assam numerous long cracks and fissures opened in the ground, and circular holes were formed through which water and sand were ejected; wells were filled with sand, and many small river-channels were entirely blocked by the upheaval of their beds. The railways in the same localities were rendered impassable owing to the damage done to bridges and to fissures in the embankments, which in some places subsided altogether. The shock fortunately occurred in the daytime and the mortality was thus small; had it occurred at night, the number killed must have been very large. The previous earthquake (that of 1885) was felt chiefly in the same parts of Bengal, but it was more local; its area of maximum intensity was in the neighbourhood of Bogra*.\n\nThe people of Bengal appear from their physical type to belong to three distinct stocks\u2014Dravidian, Mongoloid, and Aryan. Except on the northern and eastern outskirts, the main basis is everywhere Dravidian; but in Bengal proper there is a strong Mongoloid element, while in Bih\u0101r the Dravidian type has been modified by an admixture of Aryan blood. Philologists hold that the earliest recognizable linguistic formation in India is the Dravidian. How the people who brought these languages with them entered India is a problem regarding which we can only speculate. They may have come from the north-west by way of Arabia, where (if so) the subsequent intrusion of a Semitic race has since obliterated all trace of them; or they may, more probably, have come from the south in the prehistoric time when it is thought that India was connected with Madagascar by a land area, known to naturalists as Lemuria, which subsequently broke up and sank beneath the sea, leaving as its only trace several huge shoals and a chain of islands, including the Seychelles, Chagos Islands, the Laccadives and Maldives. Dravidian languages still survive, not only in Southern India, where Tamil and Telugu are its leading representatives, but also in the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, where they are spoken by the Oraon, M\u0101le, and other tribes. Bengal was next over-\nrun, as far as Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, by tribes speaking languages of the family known as Mon-Anam or Mon-Khmer, which is still extant in Pegu, Cambodia, and Cochin China. These tribes probably came from the north-east by way of the P\u0101tkai pass and the valley of the Brahmaputra. The only dialect of this family which survives in Assam is the Kh\u0101si; in Bengal not a single representative is left, but indications of its former existence are perhaps disclosed by the Mund\u0101 family of languages\\(^1\\). These invaders from the north-east were followed by fresh hordes from the same direction, whose speech was of the type known as Tibeto-Burman, of which Tibetan and Burmese represent the two standards to which the other and ruder dialects tend to conform, and which is believed to have had its origin in Eastern Tibet or in adjacent territory now Chinese. The earliest of these later incomers were probably the ancestors of the Pods of Central and the Chand\u0101ls of East Bengal, who have long since abandoned their characteristic dialects, while the latest were the Kochs, Mechs, and G\u0101ros, many of whom still retain their tribal forms of speech. The Aryan invasion from the north-west, which took place while the incursions of Mongoloid tribes from the north-east were still in progress, was the last notable movement so far as this Province is concerned. Bih\u0101r was the seat of rule of Aryan princes, but in Bengal proper the stream of immigration was comparatively thin and attenuated. As the Aryan invasion spread, its character changed, and arms gave way to arts. Aryan priests, adventurers, merchants, and artificers found their way over and beyond Bengal, and by their superior intelligence and culture gradually imposed their religion and language on people whom they had never conquered, and sometimes even snatched the crown from the indigenous ruling families.\n\nThe province of Bih\u0101r is known to us from very early times. The ancient kingdom of Magadha comprised the country now included in the Districts of Patna, Gay\u0101, and Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d. Its capital was at R\u0101j\u0101griha (R\u0101jgir), some 30 miles north-east of Gay\u0101. North of the Ganges was Videha or Mithil\u0101, which was very early a great seat of Sanskrit learning, and included the modern Districts of Darbhanga, Champ\u0101ran, and North Muzaffarpur; the south of the latter District constituted the small kingdom of Vaisal\u012b. To the east lay Anga, including Monghyr, Bh\u0101galpur, and Purnea, as far as the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 river. There are constant references to these countries in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Magadha is even mentioned under the name of Kikot\u0101 in the Rig Veda, and Mithil\u0101 in the Satyapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. It was in Magadha that Buddha developed his religion, and that Mah\u0101v\u012bra founded the cognate creed of the Jains. Soon after Buddha\u2019s death,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There are traces of an alliance with the Mon-speaking races in the social organization of the Mund\u0101-speaking tribes and in the monoliths which some of them still erect.\na S\u016bdra, named Nanda, wrested the throne from the Kshattriyas and founded a new dynasty. He made his capital at the confluence of the Son and the Ganges near the modern Patna. Chandragupta, a contemporary of Alexander the Great, on the death of that monarch, organized a powerful force with which he expelled the Macedonians. He then turned his arms against Dhema Nanda, king of Magadha, and having defeated and slain him, seated himself on the vacant throne of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra and gradually extended his rule over the greater part of Northern India. He successfully resisted Seleucus, who had succeeded to the eastern portion of Alexander's empire. When peace was made, all the Indian provinces of Alexander, and probably also the Kabul valley, were ceded to Chandragupta, and a matrimonial alliance was effected between the two royal houses. Megasthenes was deputed by Seleucus as his ambassador at P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, and it was here that he compiled his work on India. The government of the Indian monarch is described as strong and well organized, and as established in a magnificent fortified city. The standing army numbered 60,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 elephants, and a multitude of chariots. On active service the army is said to have attained the huge total of 600,000 men. In 272 B.C. Chandragupta's grandson, Asoka, ascended the throne, and nine years later he added Kalinga to his empire. His experiences during this campaign impressed him so deeply with the horrors of warfare that he thenceforth turned his thoughts to religion and became the great champion of Buddhism. He sent his missionaries to every known country and himself took the vows of a Buddhist monk.\n\nIn the fourth century A.D. the Gupta dynasty rose to power. Their capital was also at Patna, and their supremacy was acknowledged by the kings of the different countries now included in Bengal. They were Hindus by religion. In Hiuen Tsiang's time (seventh century) North Bih\u0101r was divided into Vriji to the north and Vaisali to the south, both countries stretching eastwards to the Mah\u0101nand\u0101. South of the Ganges were Hiranya Parvana (Monghyr) and Champ\u0101 (south Bh\u0101galpur, the Sant\u0101l Parganas, and Birbh\u016bm). The rulers of both these kingdoms were probably Khetauris of M\u0101l origin. In the ninth century the Buddhist dynasty founded by Gopal included Bih\u0101r in its dominions. The last of this line was defeated in 1197 by Muhammad-i-Bakhty\u0101r Khilji, whose soldiers destroyed the capital at Odantapuri and massacred the Buddhist monks assembled there.\n\nVery little is known of Bengal proper until the rise of the P\u0101l dynasty. At the time of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, North and East Bengal formed, with Assam, the powerful kingdom of Pr\u0101gjyotisha, or K\u0101mar\u016bpa as it was subsequently called, and its ruler, Bhagadatta, was one of the great chiefs who fought in the battle of Kurukshetra. This\nkingdom stretched westwards as far as the Karatoy\u0101 river. It was ruled by a succession of princes of Mongoloid stock, and was still flourishing when visited by Hiuen Tsiang in the seventh century. South-west of Pr\u0101gjyotisha, between the Karatoy\u0101 and the Mah\u0101nand\u0101, lay Pundra or Paundravardhana, the country of the Pods, which, according to Cunningham, has given its name to the modern P\u0101bna*; its capital may have been at MAH\u0100STH\u0100N* on the right bank of the old Karatoy\u0101 river, or at Pandua*, near M\u0101lda*. This kingdom was in existence in the third century B.C., and Asoka's brother found shelter there in the guise of a Buddhist monk. It was still flourishing when Hiuen Tsiang travelled in India; and it is mentioned as a powerful kingdom in the eighth century A.D., and as a place of pilgrimage in the eleventh century.\n\nEast of the Bh\u0101girathi and south of Pundra lay Banga or Samatata. Its people are described in the Raghubansa as possessing many boats, and they are clearly the ancestors of the Chand\u0101ls, who at the present day inhabit this part of the country. On the west of the Bh\u0101girathi lay Karna Suvarna (Burdw\u0101n, B\u0101nkur\u0101, Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, and Hooghly), whose king, S\u0101s\u0101nka or Narendra, the last of the Guptas, was a fanatical worshipper of Siva, and invaded Magadha and cut down the sacred bodhi tree early in the seventh century. The capital was probably near R\u0101ng\u0101mat\u012b, in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d District. Lastly, there was the kingdom of T\u0101mralipta, or Suhm\u0101, comprising what now constitutes the Districts of Midnapore and Howrah. The rulers of this country seem to have been Kaibarttas.\n\nDuring the ninth century, the P\u0101l dynasty rose to power in the country formerly known as Anga, and gradually extended their sway over the whole of Bih\u0101r and North Bengal. Traces of their rule are very common in the south of Din\u0101jpur*, where the memory of Mahip\u0101l, in particular, is preserved both in the traditions of the people and in numerous names of places. Like the kings of Pundra, they were Buddhists, but they were tolerant towards Hinduism. They were driven from Bengal proper, about the middle of the eleventh century, by a king named Vijaya Sen of the Sen family, but they continued to rule for some time longer in Bih\u0101r. The Sens rose to power in East and deltaic Bengal towards the end of the tenth century, and eventually included within their dominions the whole of Bengal proper from the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 and the Bh\u0101girathi on the west to the Karatoy\u0101 and the old Brahmaputra on the east. The Sens were Hindus, and during their rule Buddhism was actively discouraged. The best remembered king of this dynasty is Ball\u0101l Sen, who reorganized the caste system and introduced Kulini\u015bm among the Br\u0101hmans, Baidyas, and K\u0101yasthas. To him is attributed the division of Bengal into four parts: namely, R\u0101kh, west of the Bh\u0101girathi, corresponding roughly to Karma Suvarna:\nB\u0101rendra, between the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 and the Karatoy\u0101, corresponding to Pundra; Bagri (B\u0101gdi) or South Bengal; and Banga or East Bengal. He conquered and annexed Mithil\u0101, where the era inaugurated at the accession of his son, Lakshman Sen, is still current. The latter was still holding his court at Nabadwip at the time of Muhammad-i-Bakhty\u0101r's invasion at the end of the twelfth century. He himself fled to Orissa; but his descendants exercised a precarious sovereignty in East Bengal, with their capital at Bikrampur* in Dacca District, for a further 120 years.\n\nAt the dawn of history Orissa formed part of the powerful kingdom of Kalinga, which stretched from the mouths of the Ganges to those of the God\u0101vari. It was conquered by Asoka, but by 150 B.C. it had again passed to the Kalinga kings. Jainism was then beginning to spread in the land; but about the second century A.D. it was succeeded, according to Buddhist tradition, by the latter creed, which was still flourishing in 640. Subsequently the power of the Kalinga dynasty declined, and Orissa seems to have become independent. In 610, however, an inscription of Sasanka, king of Magadha, claims it as a part of the dominions of that monarch, and in 640 it was conquered by Harshavardhana of Kanauj. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, Orissa is said to have been under the rule of the Kesari kings, to whose rule are ascribed the Saiva temples at Bhubaneswar and most of the ruins in the Alti hills; but the existence of such a dynasty is uncertain\u00b9.\n\nThen followed the dynasty founded by Chora Gang\u0101 of Kalinganagar. These kings were of the Vaishnava faith: they built the famous temple of Jagann\u0101th at Pur\u012b and the Black Pagoda of Kon\u0101rak. There were frequent wars with the Muhammadans, and about 1361 the emperor Firoz Sh\u0101h conducted an inroad into Orissa in person. In 1434 Kapileswar Deva, of the Solar line, usurped the throne. He extended his dominions to the south, where Muhammadan inroads had subverted the old order of things, as far as the Penner river; but his successors were gradually shorn of these additions by the Musalm\u0101n rulers of Golconda. In the north also the onset of the Muhammadans became more and more insistent; and at last in 1568, after a period of civil war, the last Hindu king, a usurper of the name of Mukund Deo, was overthrown by K\u0101la P\u0101h\u0101r, the general of Sulaim\u0101n Karr\u0101ram.\n\nMuhammad-i-Bakhty\u0101r Khilji, a Turk\u012b free-lance, who acknowledged the suzerainty of Muhammad Ghori, conquered Bih\u0101r about 1197. Two years later he advanced with a small troop of horsemen into Bengal, and took possession of Gaur* and Nabadwip without a\n\n\u00b9 The account of these kings given in the M\u0101dala Panjik\u0101, or palm-leaf records of the Temple of Jagann\u0101th, has been shown to be wholly unreliable, but several inscriptions have recently come to light which are thought by some to prove that the dynasty really existed.\nstruggle. He unsuccessfully invaded Tibet, and in his retreat lost the greater part of his army at the hands of the Mechs east of the Karatoy\u0101. The greater part of Bengal gradually came under the control of the Muhammadan governors, who ruled at Gaur or Lakhnauti, in loose subjection to the Delhi emperors.\n\nMugh\u012bs-ud-d\u012bn Tughril, the sixteenth governor, who had originally been a favourite slave of the emperor Balban, seeing that Balban was preoccupied with the advance of the Mongols from the west, rebelled and defeated in turn the imperial armies that were sent against him. Balban himself then took the field (in 1282), and having surprised and slain Tughril and put a great number of his followers to the sword, installed his son, N\u0101sir-ud-d\u012bn Bughr\u0101, as governor. In 1338 Fakhr-ud-d\u012bn Mub\u0101rak revolted against Muhammad bin Tughlak, and declared himself independent.\n\nEight years before this date South Bih\u0101r had been separated from Bengal and annexed to Delhi. North Bih\u0101r apparently belonged to Bengal for some time longer, as the Bengal king, H\u0101j\u012b Shams-ud-d\u012bn Ily\u0101s, is reputed to have been the founder of H\u0101jipur. In 1397 the whole of Bih\u0101r became part of the kingdom of Jaunpur; but a century later it was again taken possession of by the emperors of Delhi, who continued to hold it, except for a short time when the Bengal king, Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Husain, and his son, N\u0101sir-ud-d\u012bn Nusrat, obtained temporary possession of the country north of the Ganges. Under the Mughals the capital of the country was the town of Bih\u0101r in the south of the Patna District, and from this town the whole province took its name. A considerable part of North Bih\u0101r was under the rule of a line of Br\u0101hman kings, who were generally tributary to the Path\u0101ns, from the middle of the fourteenth to the middle of the sixteenth century. Another Hindu dynasty, possibly connected with them, ruled during the fifteenth century in Champ\u0101ran and Gorakhpur.\n\nFrom 1338 till 1539, when it fell into the hands of Sher Sh\u0101h, Bengal was ruled by various lines of independent kings, mostly of Path\u0101n or Turk\u012b origin. Some, however, were Abyssinian eunuchs, and one, R\u0101j\u0101 K\u0101ns or Ganesh of Din\u0101jpur*, was a Hindu; the latter's son, who succeeded him, became a convert to Isl\u0101m. The exact area of their dominions varied. Sometimes they were contracted by the encroachments of the kings of Kam\u0101t\u0101pur, Arakan, and Tippera*, while at others they were extended, notably by Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Husain, who in 1498 conquered the kingdom of Kam\u0101t\u0101pur in the north-east and overran Orissa and Bih\u0101r.\n\nAfter B\u0101bar had overthrown the Afgh\u0101n dynasty at Delhi, he turned his arms against the Afgh\u0101n rulers of Bih\u0101r. These were twice defeated in 1528 and 1529, and sought refuge with their compatriots in Bengal, who in their turn were worsted in a battle on the banks of the\nGogra. After B\u0101bar's death the Bih\u0101r Afgh\u0101ns rallied under a brother of the late Lod\u012b Sult\u0101n of Delhi, but were decisively vanquished by Hum\u0101y\u016bn in 1531 in an engagement near Lucknow. Meanwhile Sher Sh\u0101h, a descendant of the royal house of S\u016bri kings of Ghor, who rose from a humble executive office to the rank of prime minister of the Afgh\u0101n governors, or kings of Bih\u0101r, as they called themselves in B\u0101bar's time, had established himself at Chun\u0101r. Hum\u0101y\u016bn did not trouble to reduce him, but contented himself with a verbal submission; and the result was that during the next six years, while the emperor was engaged elsewhere, Sher Sh\u0101h became supreme on the borders of Bengal. In 1537 Hum\u0101y\u016bn marched against him, and after a siege of six months reduced his fortress of Chun\u0101r. At the same time Sher Sh\u0101h was himself engaged in the conquest of Bengal. He effected this; but when Hum\u0101y\u016bn, after taking Chun\u0101r, marched into Bengal, Sher Sh\u0101h shut himself up in Roht\u0101sgarh, which he had captured by a stratagem, and made no effort to oppose his advance. Hum\u0101y\u016bn spent six months in dissipation in Bengal; but then, finding that Sher Sh\u0101h had cut off his communications and that his brother at Delhi would not come to his assistance, he retraced his steps and was met and defeated near Buxar. Sher Sh\u0101h then ousted the Mughal governor who had been left at Gaur, and proclaimed himself king of Bengal and Bih\u0101r. A year later he again defeated Hum\u0101y\u016bn at Kanauj and became emperor of Delhi. He proved a strong and capable ruler; during his reign the country enjoyed peace and prosperity, and the people were secure from oppression and bribery. He died in 1545. Ten years later Hum\u0101y\u016bn recovered the throne of Delhi from his nephew, but the Afgh\u0101n governors of Bengal remained unconquered. R\u0101ju, better known as K\u0101la P\u0101h\u0101r, the general of Sulaim\u0101n Karar\u0101ni, who acknowledged the supremacy of Akbar, but was practically independent, conquered Orissa in 1568. Sulaim\u0101n's son Daud at first made his submission to Akbar. He subsequently rebelled, but was defeated; and Bengal was definitely annexed to the Mughal empire, to which it continued to belong practically till the disintegration of the empire after the death of Aurangzeb, and nominally until it passed into the possession of the East India Company.\n\nDuring the earlier years of Mughal rule, the governors were called upon to meet repeated risings of the previously predominant Afgh\u0101ns, who, when defeated, took refuge in Orissa. R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh inflicted a crushing defeat on them, but they were not finally subdued until 1611 in the viceroyalty of Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n. At this time the incursions of Maghs from Arakan, and Portuguese pirates from the islands at the mouth of the Meghn\u0101, had become so persistent that special steps had to be taken to resist them. With this object Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n removed the capital, which had usually been at Gaur or the neighbouring towns\nof Pandua and Rajmahal, to Dacca*, where it remained, except for a short interval, until Murshid Kuli Khan made Murshidabad his head-quarters a hundred years later. When Shah Jah\u0101n rebelled against his father, the emperor Jah\u0101ngir, in 1621, and after being defeated, fled to the Deccan, where he again suffered defeat, he determined to seize upon Bengal. He took Orissa by surprise, and subsequently, with the aid of the Afghans, overthrew the governor and took possession of the whole Province. He held it for two years, but was then defeated and made his submission. On the death of Jah\u0101ngir he became emperor, and in 1639 appointed his son Sultan Shuj\u0101 to be governor of Bengal. The latter subsequently fought against his brother Aurangzeb, but was defeated by Mir Jumla and fled to Arakan, where he died a miserable death. Mir Jumla was rewarded with the post of governor, which he filled with conspicuous ability. The most important event of his rule was his invasion of Cooch Behar and Assam in 1661 and 1662. He overran both countries; but the rigours of a rainy season in Upper Assam spread death and disease among his troops, and he was compelled to return, only to die of dysentery contracted during the campaign, shortly after his arrival at Dacca*.\n\nWhen Aurangzeb died, the governor of Bengal was Murshid Kuli Khan, a Brahman convert to Islam. He possessed great administrative ability; and, profiting by the dissensions at Delhi, he succeeded in making himself practically independent. From that time forward the supremacy of the Mughal emperors was little more than nominal.\n\nIn North Bengal various Mongoloid tribes rose in turn to power. When Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Husain overran the country at the end of the fifteenth century, the ruling monarch was Nil\u0101mbar, the third of a line of Khen chieftains. Shortly afterwards Biswa Singh, the progenitor of the Koch kings, founded a new dynasty, whose rule extended from the Karatoya to Central Assam; and it was not until 1661 that the country as far as Go\u0101lp\u0101ra was permanently acquired by Mir Jumla. Previous to the seventeenth century the Chittagong Division* was usually in the hands of the Tipperas or of the Maghs, and it was only after the transfer of the capital to Dacca* that this tract was gradually annexed.\n\nOrissa (including Midnapore), which had been wrested from the Hindu kings by K\u0101la P\u0101h\u0101r, remained in the possession of the Afghans until 1592, when M\u0101n Singh annexed it. It was placed under separate governors, but Midnapore and Balasore were subsequently transferred to Bengal. In 1751 Ali Vardi Khan ceded the province to the Bhonslas of N\u0101gpur, in whose possession it remained until its conquest by the British in 1803. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s made no attempt to establish any civil administration, and their rule was confined to a periodic harrying of the country by their cavalry, who extorted whatever they could from the people.\nChot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, including the Tributary States of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and Orissa, is called Jh\u0101rkand in the Akbarn\u0101ma. The country was ruled by chiefs of various aboriginal tribes, the Cheros being predominant in Pal\u0101mau, the Mund\u0101s in R\u0101nch\u012b, and the Bhuiy\u0101s and Gonds in the Orissa States. The south of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur proper was annexed by Akbar, and Pal\u0101mau by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. The remoter chiefs appear to have remained independent until their subjugation by the Mar\u0101th\u0101s towards the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nDuring Muhammadan rule the authority of the central government varied with the character of the king or governor for the time being. If he was energetic and masterful, the whole country accepted his authority; but if he was weak and indolent, the local rulers became practically independent. At all times their internal administration was but little interfered with, so long as they paid a regular tribute and furnished troops or supplies for troops when required to do so.\n\nSome of these local potentates were Hindu R\u0101j\u0101s and others were Muhammadan free-lances, who carved out kingdoms for themselves, and some, again, were agents of the central authority, who gradually secured a large measure of independence. The founder of the Burdw\u0101n R\u0101j family was a Punjabi Khattri, who had received an appointment under the Faujd\u0101r of Burdw\u0101n, and whose descendants acquired property and power by degrees, until, in 1753, one of them received from the emperor Ahmad Sh\u0101h a farm\u0101n recognizing his right to the Burdw\u0101n R\u0101j. The R\u0101j\u0101s of Bishnupur or Mall\u0101bh\u016bm were pseudo-R\u0101jputs of aboriginal origin, who were sometimes the enemies, sometimes the allies, and sometimes the tributaries of the governors, but were never completely subjugated. About the middle of the fifteenth century a Muhammadan adventurer, named Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, or Kh\u0101nja Al\u012b, obtained a j\u0101gir from the king of Gaur, and made extensive clearances in the Sundarbans, where he appears to have exercised all the rights of sovereignty until his death in 1459. A hundred years later, when Daud, the last king of Bengal, rebelled against the emperor, one of his Hindu counsellors obtained a Raj in the Sundarbans, the capital of which, near the K\u0101l\u012bganj police station in Khuln\u0101, has given its name to the modern District of Jessore. His son, Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya, was one of the twelve chiefs or Bhuiy\u0101s who held the south and east of Bengal nominally as vassals of the emperor, but who were practically independent, and were frequently at war with each other. He rebelled against the emperor, and, after some minor successes, was defeated and taken prisoner by R\u0101j\u0101 M\u0101n Singh, the leader of Akbar's armies in Bengal from 1589 to 1606. Amongst the other Bhuiy\u0101s who were ruling at the time of Ralph Fitch's travels (towards the end of the sixteenth century), may be mentioned Param\u0101nanda Rai, who ruled over a small kingdom at\nChandradwip in the south east of the modern District of Backergunge*, and Isa Khan, of Sonargaon* in Dacca*, who was \u2018chief of all the other kings\u2019 and powerful enough to make war on the Koch kings of Kamarupa.\n\nThe following is a chronological table of the Muhammadan rulers of Bengal:\n\n### Early Muhammadan Governors of Bengal\n\n| A.D. | Name |\n|------|------|\n| 1202 | Muhammad-i-Bakhtyar Khilji |\n| 1205 | Izz-ud-din Muhammad Shiran |\n| 1208 | Al\u00e2-ud-din Mardan |\n| 1211 | Ghiy\u00e2s-ud-din Iwaz |\n| 1226 | N\u00e2sir-ud-din Mahm\u00fbd, son of emperor Altamsh |\n| 1229 | Al\u00e2-ud-din Jan\u00ee |\n| 1229 | Saif-ud-din Aibak |\n| 1233 | Izz-ud-din Tughril Tugl\u00e2n |\n| 1244 | Kamar-ud-din Tamar |\n| 1246 | Ikhtiy\u00e2r-ud-din Y\u00fbzbak |\n| 1258 | Jal\u00e2l-ud-din Mas\u00fbd |\n| 1258 | Izz-ud-din Balban (afterwards emperor) |\n| 1260 | Muhammad Arsl\u00e2n Tatar Khan |\n| 1277 | Mugh\u00ees-ud-din Tughril |\n\n| A.D. | Name |\n|------|------|\n| 1282 | N\u00e2sir-ud-din Bughra (son of Balban) |\n| 1291 | Rukn-ud-din Kaikaus (son of Bughra) |\n| 1302 | Shams-ud-din Firoz (son of Bughra) |\n| 1318 | Shah\u00e2b-ud-din Bughra (son of Bughra, W.

The earliest European traders in Bengal were the Portuguese, who began to visit Chittagong* and Satgaon near Hooghly about the year 1530. They were well established at Hooghly when Ralph Fitch travelled through the country in 1586. Factors of the East India Company, coming from Surat by way of Agra, first visited Patna in 1620. About 1625 the Dutch settled at Chinsura and at Pipli in the north of Orissa, and about 1642 the first factory of the East India Company in this Province was established near Balasore. In 1650 a factory was started at Hooghly, where trade was greatly facilitated by a farm\u0101n obtained in the following year from the emperor Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n by a surgeon of the Company named Boughton, who had succeeded in curing a lady of the royal family. Shortly after this factories were started at Cossimb\u0101z\u0101r and Patna, and a few years later a fifth was opened at Dacca*. These settlements in Bengal were at first worked in subordination to Fort St. George at Madras, but in 1681 they were constituted an independent charge. The sole object of the Company at this time was trade, the articles most in demand being saltpetre, silks, and muslins. Their dealings were hampered by constant disputes with the Naw\u0101b and his local officials, who tried to exact what they could; and on more than one occasion hostilities broke out, in which, on the whole, the Company's servants held their own. S\u016bt\u0101nuti, the northern part of modern Calcutta, was occupied as his head-quarters by Job Charnock, temporarily in 1686, and permanently in 1690, and by 1710 the old Fort William had been constructed. In 1698 the Company was permitted to purchase, for Rs. 1,300, the three villages\nof Calcutta, Sutanuti, and Gobindpur, subject to a revenue of Rs. 1,195; and in 1717 the purchase was sanctioned of thirty-eight more villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 8,121.\n\nIn June, 1756, Siraj-ud-daula, the Nawab of Bengal, finding that the English, in fear of an attack by the French, who had established themselves at Chandernagore in 1688, were strengthening the fortifications of Calcutta without his permission, marched against the place and took it. It was then that occurred the massacre of the Black Hole. The European prisoners, 146 in number, were confined in a small room, only 18 feet by 14 feet, and next morning all but 23 were found to have died of suffocation. A force was immediately dispatched from Madras under Clive, who advanced in 1757 towards Murshidabad. The Nawab, with a large army, met him at Plassey, but was utterly defeated; Mir Jafar was appointed Nawab, but was soon afterwards ousted in favour of his son-in-law, Mir Kasim. The latter, exasperated by the exactions of the servants of the Company and their interference with the transit duties, engaged in hostilities, but was twice defeated. He fled to Oudh, after causing a number of English prisoners at Patna to be put to death. The Nawab of Oudh espoused his cause; but the combined armies were defeated by Major Munro at Buxar in 1764, and the Diwani or civil authority over Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa was conferred in perpetuity on the East India Company by the emperor Shah Alam\u00b9. The result was that the centre of British power was transferred from Madras to Calcutta, and that from 1774 to 1854 the Governorship of Bengal was merged in the Governor-Generalship of the Company's territories in India. The French Settlement at Chandernagore was captured at the same time, but was subsequently restored, and the place is still a French possession administered in subordination to the French governor of Pondicherry.\n\nIn 1765 was inaugurated Clive's celebrated 'dual system,' by which it was thought that the Company would get all the benefit from its new possessions, without the trouble and responsibility involved in their actual administration. Mir Jafar was reinstated as Nawab; but he was required to execute an agreement by which the Company received the revenues and undertook the military defence of the country, while he carried on the civil administration in return for a fixed stipend. The revenue was collected by Naibs or Deputy-Nawabs. This dual government was found most unsatisfactory; the people were subjected to great oppression, while the collections rapidly declined. In 1769-70 there was a terrible famine in which a third of the population is said to have perished, and which is believed to have been aggravated by the misgovernment of the agents of the Nawab and the ignorance of local\n\n\u00b9 Orissa was at the time in the possession of the Marathas, and it was not until 1803 that it was conquered and annexed by Lord Wellesley.\nconditions on the part of British officials. After several abortive experiments an entirely new system was introduced by Warren Hastings. European Collectors were appointed in each of the fourteen Districts into which Bengal was then divided, and the collection of the revenue was placed in their hands. They were also placed over the Diw\u0101ni Ad\u0101lat or civil courts, where they were assisted by the advice of experienced native officials. The Faujd\u0101ri Ad\u0101lat or criminal courts were still presided over by Muhammadan officials, but the Collector was required to see that all witnesses were duly examined and that the decisions were fair and impartial. Appeals from the local civil and criminal courts were allowed to two superior courts in Calcutta. Subsequently the European Collectors were replaced by native \u0101mis, and the superintendence of the collection of the revenue was vested in six Provincial Councils, at Calcutta, Burdwan, Dacca*, Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Din\u0101jpur*, and Patna. The \u0101mi's administered civil justice, while the criminal courts were presided over by native officers called faujd\u0101rs.\n\nFurther changes were made; but when Lord Cornwallis became Governor-General in 1786, the original system of Warren Hastings was reverted to, with this difference that the Collector was himself Civil Judge and Magistrate. For some years longer serious criminal cases were required to be referred for trial to the Deputy of the Naw\u0101b, but in 1793 four courts of circuit, superintended by covenanted servants of the Company, were established to try cases not cognizable by the magistrates. Separate judges were next appointed in each District, with native subordinates to deal with petty civil cases.\n\nVarious further improvements and alterations were from time to time effected, notably in 1829, when Commissioners of Revenue and Circuit were appointed, but it is unnecessary to discuss them in detail. The system of administration at the present day is the direct outcome by a gradual process of evolution of the arrangements made by Lord Cornwallis.\n\nIn 1836 the now overgrown Bengal Presidency\u00b9 was divided into two parts\u2014Fort William in Bengal, and Agra\u2014and a separate Lieutenant-Governor, subordinate to the Governor-General, was appointed for the latter. The former, which included the whole of what now constitutes the Province of Bengal and the territories comprised in the Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam\u00b2, remained under the direct control of the Governor-General, who was authorized, when absent from the Province, to nominate a Deputy-Governor from among the ordinary Members of his Council, to carry on the government. This arrangement continued\n\n\u00b9 The varying meaning of the term has already been explained on p. 195.\n\u00b2 Sylhet, Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, and the G\u0101ro Hills formed part of Bengal from the beginning of British rule; the Assam Valley proper was acquired from Burma in 1826, and the other tracts on different dates which need not here be detailed.\nuntil 1854, when the Governor-General was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal by the appointment of a permanent Lieutenant-Governor. The change was much needed, as the Governor-General being frequently absent, and his Deputy-Governor, who was usually the senior ordinary Member of Council for the time being, constantly changing, the element of personal continuity at the head of the Administration was sadly lacking. The names of the successive Lieutenant-Governors of Bengal are noted below:\n\n| Name                  | Year |\n|-----------------------|------|\n| Sir Frederick Halliday | 1854 |\n| Sir John Peter Grant   | 1859 |\n| Sir Cecil Beadon       | 1862 |\n| Sir William Grey       | 1867 |\n| Sir George Campbell    | 1871 |\n| Sir Richard Temple     | 1874 |\n| Sir Ashley Eden        | 1877 |\n| Sir Rivers Thompson    | 1882 |\n| Sir Steuart Bayley     | 1887 |\n| Sir Charles Elliot     | 1890 |\n| Sir Alexander Mackenzie | 1895 |\n| Sir John Woodburn      | 1898 |\n| Sir James Bourdillon   | 1902 |\n| Sir Andrew Fraser      | 1903 |\n\nThe events of the Sepoy Revolt took place chiefly in Upper India, and the rising in Bengal was comparatively unimportant. But the story of the greased cartridges had its origin at Barrackpore, and both there and at Berhampore, Dinapore, and Dacca*, the sepoys mutinied. They were, however, quickly suppressed; and it was only in Bih\u0101r that events for a time took a serious turn, especially in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, where the defence of the billiard-room at Arrah, by a handful of Civilians and Sikhs, against the onslaught of the sepoys mutineers from Dinapore and the levies of a local R\u0101jput zam\u012bnd\u0101r, forms one of the most splendid pieces of gallantry in the history of the British arms.\n\nIn 1864 repeated raids by the Bhut\u0101nese, and the barbarous outrages committed on the British Envoy sent to negotiate with the Bhut\u0101n government, led to a campaign in which the Bhut\u0101nese were worsted and the British troops took possession of the Du\u0101rs, i.e. the passes into the hills and the adjoining lowlands; and in 1865 a treaty was concluded by which those territories were ceded to the British Government in return for a fixed annual payment. In 1874 the Districts constituting the Province of Assam were separated from Bengal and placed under a Chief Commissioner. In 1888 the Tibetans having advanced into Sikkim, an expedition was sent against them. They were defeated with ease, the campaign ending with their complete expulsion from Sikkim, and that State was brought into closer relations with the British Government by the appointment of a resident Political officer. This was followed by the execution of a convention which provided for the improvement of the trade relation with Tibet; but the results in this respect were disappointing, and in 1904 a British Mission was sent into Tibet and penetrated as far as Lh\u0101sa, where a new convention was executed by the Tibetan authorities.\n\n* Short officiating appointments have been omitted.\nThe oldest remains of ascertained date are a series of inscriptions of Asoka, partly on rocks, as at Dhauli in Puri District and in a small cave high on the Chandan Pir hill at Sasaram, and partly on pillars, four in number, marking the route taken by the great king through Muzaffarpur and Champaran, on his visit to the sacred sites of Buddhism in what is now the Nep\u0101l tarat; of the latter the pillar near Lauriya Nandangarh is still almost perfect. Next, in point of time, come the caves on the Khandgiri and Udayagiri hills, in the District of Puri, which were long believed to be Buddhist but are now thought to be mostly of Jain origin. Their period is fixed by an inscription of Kharavela in 165 B.C. With the exception of the Sonbhandar cave at R\u0101jgir, dating from the third century A.D., these are the only Jain remains with any claim to antiquity. Buddhist relics, though frequently reduced to mere heaps of bricks, are far more plentiful, especially in South Bih\u0101r\u2014the ancient Magadha, the birthplace of Jainism as well as of Buddhism\u2014where the latter religion continued to flourish more or less until finally swept away by the Muhammadans.\n\nAt Buddh Gay\u0101 are still to be seen portions of an ancient stone railing, with interesting carvings in relief, dating from about the time of Asoka, which originally surrounded the holy pipal tree there. The present temple of Buddh Gay\u0101 was probably erected about A.D. 450, but it underwent many additions and repairs before it fell into ruins; its restoration was effected about twenty years ago under the auspices of Government, but the method in which the work was carried out has been much criticized. Interesting remains of the ancient city of P\u0101taliputra have recently been discovered at Patna by Major Waddell. Numerous mounds at Baragaon, 7 miles south of Bih\u0101r town, bury the remains of N\u0101landa, a famous seat of Buddhist learning in the days of the P\u0101l kings. The innumerable Buddhist images still to be seen in every village in South Bih\u0101r date from the same period.\n\nThe temple of Jagann\u0101th at Puri and the Saiva temples at Bhubaneswar have already been mentioned. The latter have recently been repaired, and efforts are now being made to remedy the inroads made by time and mischief in the temple of the Sun God at Kon\u0101rak, which was built by Nara Sinha Deva about A.D. 1275. Among other Hindu remains, which are far from numerous, may be mentioned the temples on the Mundeswari Hill in Sh\u0101hab\u0101d and at Afsar near Gay\u0101, both dating from the sixth or seventh century; a number of stone temples at Bar\u0101kar and elsewhere in the old tract of Jh\u0101rkand, some of which are upwards of 500 years old; and some Bengali brick temples, from 200 to 400 years old, of which those at Bishnupur in Bankur\u0101 and at Kantanagar in Din\u0101jpur* are typical examples.\n\nUnder the rule of the independent Muhammadan kings, Bengal proper developed a peculiar style of Path\u0101n architecture, the most\nstriking feature of which is the curved battlement, imitating the peculiar shape of a Bengali hut. Gaur and Pandua, in the District of Malda*, the ancient capitals of those dynasties, still contain the best specimens of this type, such as the B\u0101radu\u0101ri of R\u0101mkel, the D\u0101khil Darw\u0101za, the T\u0101ntip\u0101ra, Son\u0101, and Lotan mosques, the Kadam Ras\u016bl, and the Firoz Min\u0101r. The Adina mosque, at Pandua, was built by Sult\u0101n Sikandar Sh\u0101h in 1368. It is constructed almost entirely from the spoils of Hindu temples, which must have abounded in this neighbourhood\u00b9. Many of these are now being repaired. Among other buildings of this period may be mentioned the curious Sh\u0101t Gumbaz, a mosque with seventy-seven domes, near B\u0101gherh\u0101t in the District of Khuln\u0101, built by Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, whose tomb is close to the mosque. At a second Pandua, in Hooghly District, there is a large mosque and min\u0101r of about the year 1300, and close to it, at Tribeni, is the darg\u0101h of Zafar Kh\u0101n Gh\u0101zi and a mosque of the same period.\n\nThe short reign of Sher Sh\u0101h is still borne witness to by one of the finest specimens of Muhammadan sepulchral architecture, his own tomb at Sasar\u0101m, which place he originally held as his j\u0101g\u012br. His father\u2019s tomb in the same town, and the tomb of Bakhty\u0101r Kh\u0101n, near Chainpur, in the Bhabu\u0101 subdivision of Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d District, are similar but less imposing. The small hill fort of Shergarh, 26 miles southwest of Sasar\u0101m, dates from Sher Sh\u0101h\u2019s time, but at Roht\u0101sgarh itself little remains of his period; the palace at this place is attributed to M\u0101n Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general. The darg\u0101h of Sh\u0101h Daulat at Maner, near Dinapore, completed in 1616, is a fine specimen of architecture of the Mughal period; it is covered with most exquisite sandstone carvings. There are numerous other tombs and mosques of the same period at Patna, Bih\u0101r, R\u0101jmah\u0101l, Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Monghyr, Dacca*, &c.; but they are of little interest compared with similar buildings in other parts of India.\n\nThe distribution of the population\u00b2, as disclosed by the Census of 1901, is shown in Tables II and IIA at the end of this article (pp. 343\u20135).\n\nPopulation. The total population of the Province, including Native States, is 78,493,410, of whom 39,278,186 are males and 39,215,224 females. Of the total number, 74,744,866 are in British territory and 3,748,544 in Native States.\n\nIn the Province\u00b3 as a whole there are 400 persons to the square mile, but the density varies remarkably in different parts. It is greatest\n\n\u00b9 It has already been mentioned that Pandua is believed by many to be identical with the ancient Paundravardhana.\n\u00b2 The population of the Province as now constituted is 54,662,529, of whom 27,140,616 are males and 27,521,913 females. Of the total number 50,722,067 are in British territory and 3,940,462 in the Native States.\n\u00b3 The present area of Bengal contains 368 persons to the square mile.\nin North Bih\u0101r, where there are 634 persons to the square mile. Central Bengal and West Bengal are also thickly peopled. Then follow South Bih\u0101r, Orissa, East and North Bengal, and last the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, which, with only 152 persons per square mile, is the area of least dense population. The density is far from uniform even in the same natural division. In East Bengal, for example, Dacca District* has 952 persons to the square mile, while the Chittagong Hill Tracts* have only 24, and in North Bih\u0101r the number ranges from 908 in Muzaffarpur to 375 in Purnea. Howrah, with 1,668 persons to the square mile, is the most thickly-inhabited District in Bengal, while the most sparse population (21 to the square mile) is found in Sikkim and in the Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r* and Korea* Tributary States of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur (22 to the square mile). Marked variations are sometimes found even within the borders of a single District, e.g. in Dacca*, where the Srinagar police circle contains 1,787 inhabitants to the square mile compared with only 415 in K\u0101p\u0101sia. As a general rule it may be said that the tracts where cold-season rice is the chief staple of cultivation are capable of supporting the largest number of inhabitants. Some parts of Bih\u0101r, where other crops are mainly grown, have a fairly dense population; but their inhabitants are not wholly dependent on local sources of income, and a large proportion of the adult males earn their livelihood in other parts of the Province, whence they make regular remittances for the support of their families.\n\nIn the Province as a whole, out of every 100 persons, 95 live in villages and only 5 in towns\u00b9. Bengal is a distinctly agricultural country, and many even of the so-called towns are merely overgrown villages. The urban population is considerable only in Central Bengal, where the inclusion of Calcutta and its environs brings the proportion up to 19 per cent. The second place is shared by West Bengal, with its flourishing industrial centres at Howrah, Bally, Serampore, and R\u0101n\u012bganj; and by South Bih\u0101r, with its ancient towns of Patna, Gaya, Monghyr, and Bih\u0101r. In both these tracts 7 per cent. of the inhabitants live in urban areas. Orissa follows with an urban population of 4 per cent., then North Bih\u0101r and North Bengal with 3 per cent., and, lastly, East Bengal and the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau with only 2 per cent. The order in which the different tracts stand is sufficient to show the want of any connexion between the prosperity of the people and the growth of towns. The general standard of comfort is highest in East Bengal, although it has the smallest proportion of persons living in towns. South Bih\u0101r ranks comparatively high in respect of its urban population, and yet it includes the poorest part of the Province. The older towns, which usually owed their origin to the presence of a native court, have few industries, and such as they possess are for the most part decadent;\n\n\u00b9 Of the present population 94 per cent. live in villages and 6 per cent. in towns.\nwhile in the newer towns the industries are carried on by foreign capital, and even the employ\u00e9s come from other parts of the country. The mills of Howrah and the coal-mines of Asansol are alike worked, with British capital, by coolies from Bih\u0101r and the United Provinces, and the shopkeepers, who are enriched by the trade they bring, are also for the most part foreigners.\n\nThe population of Calcutta, as limited by the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation, is 848,000; but to this should be added that of its suburbs (101,000), and also of Howrah (158,000), which lies on the opposite bank of the Hooghly and is as much a part of Calcutta as Southwark is of London. With these additions, the number of inhabitants rises to 1,107,000, which is greater than that of any European city except London, Constantinople, Paris, and Berlin. Next to Calcutta Howrah is now the largest town in Bengal. It is of entirely modern growth, and owes its position to its growing importance as a manufacturing centre. The increase during the last decade has been 35 per cent., and it has grown by no less than 80 per cent. since 1872. Patna, which stands next, has a very ancient history, and its population was once much greater than at present. It was estimated by Buchanan Hamilton at 312,000; but his calculation referred to an area of 20 square miles, whereas the city as now defined has rather less than half that area. At the present time its prosperity is declining, owing to the gradual diversion of trade from the river to the railway. At the time of the Census plague was raging in the city, and the recorded population was only 134,785. Six months later, when the epidemic had subsided, a fresh count showed it to be 153,739, which was still less by nearly 17,000 than in 1881. Dacca* was also a flourishing city long before the days of British rule. For about a century it was the capital of the Naw\u0101bs, and its muslins were once famous throughout Europe. When the demand for these muslins declined, its prosperity was seriously affected, and in 1830 its inhabitants numbered only about 70,000. Since then the growth of the jute trade has caused a revival, and the population has now risen to 90,542.\n\nThe villages of Bengal vary greatly in different parts. In Bih\u0101r, especially south of the Ganges, the buildings are closely packed together, and there is no room for trees or gardens. As one goes eastwards, the houses, though still collected in a single village site, are farther apart, and each stands in its own patch of homestead land, where vegetables are grown, and fruit trees and bamboos afford a grateful protection from the glare of the tropical sun. Farther east, again, in the swamps of East Bengal, there is often no trace of a central village site, and the houses are found in straggling rows lining the high banks of rivers, or in small clusters on mounds from 12 to 20 feet in height laboriously thrown up during the dry months when the water temporarily disappears. The\naverage population of a village is 335, but the definition of this unit for census purposes was not uniform. In some parts the survey area was adopted; elsewhere the residential village with its dependent hamlets was taken; but in practice it was often found very difficult to decide whether a particular group of houses should be taken as a separate entity or treated as a hamlet belonging to some other village.\n\nThe information regarding the early population of Bengal is scanty and unreliable. In 1787 Sir William Jones thought that it amounted to 24 millions, including part of the United Provinces then attached to Bengal. Five years later Mr. Colebrooke placed it at 30 millions. In 1835 Mr. Adam assumed it to be 35 millions, but this estimate was thought too high and was reduced to 31 millions in 1844. In 1870 the population was held to be about 42 millions, or more than a third less than the figures disclosed by the first regular Census of the Province, which was taken in 1872. The changes recorded by subsequent enumerations are shown below:\n\n| Locality          | Percentage of variation |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|\n|                   | 1872-81 | 1881-91 | 1891-1901 | Net variation, 1872-1901 |\n| Province*         | + 11.5  | + 7.3   | + 5.1     | + 25.9                  |\n| West Bengal       | - 2.7   | + 3.9   | + 7.1     | + 8.3                   |\n| Central           | + 11.7  | + 3.1   | + 5.1     | + 21.3                  |\n| North             | + 5.3   | + 4.4   | + 5.9     | + 16.6                  |\n| East              | + 10.9  | + 14.1  | + 10.4    | + 39.9                  |\n| North Bihar       | + 14.0  | + 5.8   | + 0.1     | + 20.8                  |\n| South             | + 10.9  | + 2.6   | - 3.6     | + 9.7                   |\n| Orissa            | + 17.6  | + 6.8   | + 7.1     | + 34.5                  |\n| Chota Nagpur plateau | + 3.2   | + 13.5  | + 7.8     | + 61.8                  |\n\n* The corresponding percentages of variation for Bengal as now constituted are + 3.2, + 6.5, + 13.5, and + 24.7.\n\nBetween 1872 and 1881 the Chota Nagpur plateau showed the greatest apparent growth of population, but this was due mainly to the inaccuracy of the first Census in this wild, remote, and sparsely-peopled tract. Orissa, which came second, had suffered a terrible loss of population in the great famine of 1866, and its rapid growth was the natural reaction from that calamity during a period of renewed prosperity. In North and South Bihar, as in Chota Nagpur, the Census of 1872 was defective, and the increment recorded in 1881 was to a great extent fictitious. The decline in West Bengal was due to a virulent outbreak of malarial fever. Between 1881 and 1891 the apparent rate of development in East Bengal and Chota Nagpur was about the same, but the latter tract again owed part of its increase to better enumeration, and the real growth was greatest in East Bengal. Then followed Orissa and North\nBih\u0101r, then North Bengal, and then, in order, West Bengal, Central Bengal, and South Bih\u0101r. At the Census of 1901 East Bengal again heads the list, and is followed in order by the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, Orissa, West Bengal, North Bengal, and Central Bengal. The population of North Bih\u0101r is stationary, while that of South Bih\u0101r has suffered a loss of 3\u00b76 per cent.\n\nSo far as the figures go, the rate of growth in the Province as a whole shows a progressive decline, but this is due to a great extent to omissions at the earlier enumerations. The pioneer Census of 1872 was admittedly very incomplete. That of 1881 was much more accurate; and although it is impossible to estimate, even approximately, the extent to which this affected the comparative results of the two enumerations, it would probably be quite safe to say that, if the two enumerations had been equally accurate, the excess of the figures for 1881 over those for 1872 would have been less than the increment disclosed by the Census of 1901 as compared with that of 1891. But although the Census of 1881 was very much more complete than that of 1872, there were still tracts where the standard of accuracy fell considerably below that attained ten years later; and it has been estimated that of the increase disclosed by the Census of 1891, about half a million may be ascribed to the greater accuracy of that enumeration, but even so the increment then recorded exceeds that of the last decade by about 800,000. It is calculated that the plague, which appeared for the first time in 1898, accounted for 150,000 deaths; while the cyclone of October 24, 1897, which devastated large tracts in Chittagong*, is believed to be responsible, directly and indirectly, for a mortality of about 50,000. Apart from the deaths due to plague and cyclone, there seems no reason to believe that there has been any general increase in the death-rate, and the slower rate of growth seems to be due rather to a falling off in the birth-rate. In Orissa and Central and West Bengal the birth-rate prior to 1891 was abnormally high, owing to the recovery, in the one case, from the famine of 1866, and, in the other, from the ravages of malarial fever. In Bih\u0101r successive bad seasons have led to various preventive checks on the growth of the population; but, as noticed elsewhere, they do not appear to have affected the death-rate, and it is only among the wild tribes of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur that a certain amount of mortality was possibly attributable to famine.\n\nThe number of immigrants to Bengal from other parts of India, according to the Census of 1901, is 728,715, and the corresponding number of emigrants is 879,583. By far the greatest influx is from the United Provinces, which send a continually growing supply of labourers for the mills of the metropolitan Districts and the coal-fields of Burdwan and M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and for earthwork, p\u0101lk\u012b-bearing, &c., throughout the Province. The total number of persons born in the United Provinces\nand its States, but enumerated in Bengal, was 496,940 in 1901, compared with 365,248 in 1891 and 351,933 in 1881. These figures include the ebb and flow between contiguous Districts along the boundary line. If this be left out of account, the number of immigrants from the United Provinces at the Census of 1901 is about 416,000. Of these, nearly three-sevenths were residing in Calcutta, the Twenty-four Parganas, and Howrah\\(^1\\). The emigrants to the United Provinces number only 128,991, of whom all but about 32,000 were found in Districts contiguous to the District of their birth.\n\nThe emigrants from Bengal to Assam in 1901 numbered nearly 504,000, or 85,000 more than at the previous Census. Of these, 300,000 were from the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, which is the great recruiting ground for the tea gardens of Assam. About 157,000 persons born in Bengal were enumerated in Burma, compared with 112,000 in 1891. The majority were harvesters from the adjoining District of Chittagong*\\(^*\\); but many also were from Bih\u0101r, and some of these have been settled on waste-land grants in Upper Burma.\n\nOf migration within the Province, the most noticeable feature is the great movement from Bih\u0101r to Bengal proper in quest of employment in coal-mines and factories, or on earthwork, or as field-labourers. These immigrants are for the most part adult males who eventually return to their old homes. Their total number at the time of the Census was very little short of half a million. Another internal movement of a more permanent nature is that of the tribes of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, who, in addition to 300,000 persons enumerated in Assam, have given 400,000 to Bengal proper. The Sant\u0101ls have been working their way steadily north and east for seventy years or more, and are now found in considerable numbers in the elevated tract known as the B\u0101rind, in the centre of North Bengal, which they are rapidly bringing under cultivation. The other tribes are following their lead as pioneers of cultivation; many also take service in the coal-fields and in the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri\\(^*\\) and the Darjeeling tarai, and large numbers leave their homes every cold season to obtain employment on earthwork or as field-labourers.\n\nThe age return is so inaccurate that very little reliance can be placed on the absolute results. The degree of error may, however, be assumed to be fairly constant, and, if so, some interesting conclusions may be deduced by a comparison of the figures for successive Censuses. It would seem that the mean age of the population, which fell slightly in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Districts of the United Provinces from which most of the immigrants come are those in the extreme east: namely, Ballia, Azamgarh, Gh\u0101zipur, Gorakhpur, Benares, Jaunpur, Mirz\u0101pur, and Allah\u0101b\u0101d. Then come the Districts immediately to the west of these: namely, Fyz\u0101b\u0101d, Sult\u0101npur, Part\u0101bgarh, R\u0101e Bareli, Lucknow, Fatehpur, and Cawnpore.\n1891, has now risen to a somewhat higher figure than in 1881\\(^1\\). This is due mainly to the variations in the birth-rate. The population was growing more rapidly than usual in the decade ending 1891, which was a period of recovery from famine and disease, and the larger proportion of young children reduced the average age of the population as a whole. The higher castes appear to live longer than the aboriginal tribes, while the latter have larger families than any other section of the community. There does not seem to be much difference in the relative longevity of Hindus and Muhammadans, but the latter have a larger proportion of children than the Hindus, and the mean age of the community is consequently lower.\n\nBirths and deaths are recorded throughout the Province, except in Angul, the Chittagong Hill Tracts*, and the Feudatory States. The present system of mortuary registration was introduced in 1869. The duty of reporting deaths was imposed on the chaukid\u0101rs, or village watchmen, and not on the relations of the deceased. In 1876 the system was extended to births; but the returns received were so incomplete that they were soon discontinued and, except in towns, for which special legislation was undertaken in 1873, deaths alone were registered until 1892. In that year the collection of statistics of births as well as of deaths was ordered, and the system now in vogue was introduced. In the Chaukid\u0101ri Amendment Act of 1892, the reporting of vital occurrences was made one of the legal duties of the chaukid\u0101rs. The births and deaths occurring in each beat are entered on leaflets by the chaukid\u0101r, or, if he be illiterate, by the panch\u0101yat, and taken by the former to the police station when he attends his weekly muster. A consolidated monthly statement is compiled at the police station and submitted to the Civil Surgeon, who prepares a similar return for the whole District. The accuracy of the reporting is checked by the police and other local officers, but the most valuable testing agency is that of the vaccination establishments, who are required to make inquiries regarding vital occurrences when on their rounds to test the vaccination operations. Errors and omissions thus brought to light, which usually range from 1 to \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. on the total number of vital occurrences, are communicated to the District Magistrate and the chaukid\u0101rs at fault are punished. Under the special Act for towns the reporting of births and deaths by the nearest male relative was made compulsory. The information was collected for some time by the municipal authorities, but the results were not satisfactory, and the duty was subsequently transferred to the police.\n\n\\(^1\\) By mean age is meant the average age of the living, which (except in a stationary population) is not the same thing as the mean duration of life. The mean age of males is calculated to have been 24.2 years in 1881, 24.0 in 1891, and 24.3 in 1901. These figures, however, are mere approximations.\nThese measures have led to a great improvement in the accuracy of the vital statistics. The latest estimate of the birth and death-rates in Bengal is that of Mr. Hardy, F.I.A., F.S.S., based on the Census figures for 1891 and 1901, which places them at 43\u00b79 and 38\u00b79 per 1,000 respectively. The rates according to the returns are still below this estimate, but the figures reported from year to year show a gradual improvement; and they are now sufficiently accurate not only for the purpose of showing the relative healthiness or unhealthiness of the year, but also for calculating the approximate growth of the population. The increase shown by the Census of 1901, as compared with that taken ten years previously, in the areas for which vital statistics are collected, was 3,358,576, while that indicated by the excess of reported births over deaths was 3,159,200. In Noakhali* in 1900 the reported birth-rate was 52\u00b73 per 1,000 calculated on the population disclosed by the Census of 1901, and in Patna in 1901 the reported mortality was 56\u00b78.\n\nAccording to the returns, more than 70 per cent. of the total mortality is ascribed to fever. This is due mainly to the difficulty of diagnosing all but a few well-defined diseases. Cholera, dysentery, and small-pox are known, but most other complaints are classed indiscriminately as fever. It is impossible to say what proportion of the total is attributable to malarial affections, but it may safely be assumed that, wherever the mortality entered under 'fevers' is unusually high, the greater part of the excess over the normal is due to their prevalence. On an average, about one-twelfth of the total mortality is due to cholera, but the prevalence of this disease varies greatly from year to year and from District to District. In 1898 it was responsible for less than 1 death per 1,000 of the population of the Province, but in 1900 the mortality from it rose to nearly 5 per 1,000. In the latter year it killed off nearly 24 persons in every 1,000 in Purnea, while in Bankura only 1 person in 4,000 died from the disease. Dysentery and diarrhoea account for barely a quarter as many deaths as cholera, while small-pox claims only 1 victim in every 5,000 persons yearly.\n\nPlague first appeared in Bengal in 1898, when there were two outbreaks, one in Calcutta and the other in Backergunge*. In the early part of 1899 it again visited Calcutta, and there were also outbreaks in ten rural Districts; and in the cold-season months of 1900\u20131 the disease spread over a larger area, not less than 40,000 deaths being caused by it during that period. Plague has now become an annual visitation in many parts of the Province, altogether twenty-seven Districts being affected in 1905. In the eastern Districts the conditions, whether of soil, climate, or habitations, seem to be inimical to the propagation of the microbe; but in the north-western part of the Province, and particularly in the Patna Division, the disease has established itself firmly, coming and going with the seasons with\nwonderful regularity, being most prevalent in the winter, and then practically disappearing or remaining dormant throughout the hot and rainy seasons, to recrudesce in September with the advent of the cold season. The mortality from plague in 1905 was the highest on record since it first broke out in 1898, the total number of deaths being 126,000, as against 75,000 in 1904 and 58,000 the average of the preceding quinquennium.\n\nAs in other parts of India, so also in Bengal, the infant mortality is very high, and it was estimated in 1891 by Mr. Hardy that only 71 per cent. of male and 75 per cent. of female children survive the first year of life. During the second year the mortality is believed to be only one-third as great as in the first year, and it then continues to fall rapidly.\n\n### Vital Statistics as Registered\n\n| Year | Population under registration | Ratio of registered births per 1,000 | Ratio of registered deaths per 1,000 | Deaths per 1,000 from |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|      |                               |                                     |                                     | Cholera | Smallpox | Fever | Bowel complaints |\n| 1881 | 66,106,026                    | Not                                 | 19\u00b70                                | 1\u00b73     | 0\u00b74      | 15\u00b77  | 0\u00b79               |\n| 1891 | 70,388,083                    | available                            | 26\u00b79                                | 3\u00b73     | 0\u00b72      | 18\u00b79  | 0\u00b76               |\n| 1896 | 71,070,233                    | 38\u00b70                                | 34\u00b72                                | 3\u00b72     | 0\u00b72      | 24\u00b78  | 0\u00b77               |\n| 1901 | 74,428,193                    | 38\u00b76                                | 31\u00b70                                | 1\u00b75     | 0\u00b75      | 21\u00b77  | 0\u00b78               |\n\nThe actual population shows a slight deficiency of females, who number only 998 to every 1,000 males; but if the effects of migration be discounted by considering only the natural population, i.e. the persons born in the Province, it appears that the females exceed the males in the ratio of 1,003 to 1,000. They are in marked excess in Bih\u0101r and Orissa and, to a less extent, in West Bengal and the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. East of the Bh\u0101girathi, where the Mongoloid element in the population is largest, they are in a considerable minority. There has been a steady decline in the proportion of females since 1881, due to the fact that the most progressive tracts are, generally speaking, those where males predominate, while many of the Districts with the largest proportion of the other sex are stationary or decadent. In urban areas females are generally in marked defect, and in Calcutta they are only half as numerous as the males.\n\nThe most striking fact brought out by the statistics of marriage is the universality of this institution. The number of persons, other than those suffering from some bodily or mental affliction, who go through life unmarried is extremely small. About half the total number of males were returned at the Census as unmarried, but of these four-fifths were under fifteen years of age. Only one-third of the female popula-\n\n---\n\n1 In the present area of Bengal there are 1,015 females to every 1,000 males.\ntion was unmarried, and of these only 4 per cent. were over fifteen. The proportion of the widowed is about 1 in 25 in the case of males, but among females nearly 1 in every 5 is a widow.\n\nThe marriage practices vary greatly in different parts of the Province, especially in regard to females. The girls of the animistic tribes marry when they are about seventeen or eighteen years of age. Muhammadan girls marry earlier, but not so early as those of the Hindus, with whom marriage before puberty is the rule. In some parts of Bih\u0101r the Hindus give their children in wedlock much earlier than elsewhere, and in Darbhanga and the neighbourhood both boys and girls are frequently married before the age of five. Widows remarry most freely amongst the animistic tribes, and least so amongst the Hindus. Hindu widows of the higher castes are everywhere forbidden to take a second husband, and in Bengal proper the prohibition extends to all but the lowest castes. The result is that the proportion of Hindu women of childbearing age who are widowed is nearly twice as great in this tract as elsewhere. In the Province as a whole the age at marriage is gradually rising, while the proportion of the widowed is diminishing. The former circumstance is due, in part at least, to a genuine change in the customs of the people. In Darbhanga and the neighbourhood, infant-marriage is as prevalent as ever, but elsewhere the tendency is to postpone the age at which girls are given in wedlock. The decline in the number of widows is due partly to the fact that the Muhammadans, animistic tribes, and low Hindu castes, who permit their widows to marry again, are increasing more rapidly than the section of the community that forbids them to do so, and partly to the effect of the preaching of the Maulvis amongst the Muhammadans and to the gradual disappearance of their old Hindu prejudices against widow marriage.\n\nPolygamy is allowed among Hindus, Musalmans, and Animists alike, but in the case of the first-mentioned it is often accompanied by restrictions; many castes allow a man to take a second wife only when the first is barren or suffers from some incurable disease; frequently the permission of the caste panchayat has to be obtained, and in some cases that of the elder wife. With the Muhammadans there are in theory no restrictions on the practice, so long as a man does not exceed the limit of four wives prescribed by the Prophet, but in practice the poorer classes at least are almost invariably monogamous. The fraternal form of polyandry, where a man's younger brothers share his wife, still survives amongst the Bhoti\u0101s; but it seems to be dying out. The woman is regarded as the wife of the elder brother, and the children that are born of her call him 'father' and his brothers 'uncle.' The woman moreover can, if she wishes, withhold her favours from the younger brothers. A somewhat similar system prevails amongst the Sant\u0101ls.\nCivil condition.\n\n| Sex       | 1881          | 1891          | 1901          |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Unmarried |               |               |               |\n| Male      | 15,403,131    | 16,881,400    | 17,747,071    |\n| Female    | 9,820,370     | 11,096,693    | 11,701,711    |\n| Total     | 25,233,501    | 27,978,093    | 29,448,782    |\n| Married   |               |               |               |\n| Male      | 16,381,811    | 17,138,038    | 18,103,648    |\n| Female    | 16,445,679    | 17,257,257    | 18,151,092    |\n| Total     | 32,827,490    | 34,395,295    | 36,254,749    |\n| Widowed   |               |               |               |\n| Male      | 1,333,103     | 1,484,295     | 1,526,063     |\n| Female    | 7,195,705     | 7,382,018     | 7,515,281     |\n| Total     | 8,528,808     | 8,866,313     | 9,041,344     |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures are for British Districts only, and those for 1881 and 1891 exclude the Chittagong Hill Tracts* as civil condition in that District was not recorded at those enumerations.\n\nExcluding immigrants, the languages spoken in Bengal belong to one or other of four linguistic families: Aryan, Dravidian, Mund\u0101 or Kolarian, and Tibeto-Burman. Of these, the languages of the Aryan family are by far the most important, being spoken by no less than 95 per cent. of the total population. The Mund\u0101 family comes next, but its speakers represent only \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) per cent. of the total, while the other two families each claim less than 1 per cent. The Aryan languages are spoken in the plains by almost the whole population, while those of the other families are current only in the hills or among recent settlers in the plains. The home of the Mund\u0101 and Dravidian dialects is in the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. The Tibeto-Burman languages are found partly in Darjeeling and Sikkim and the adjoining District of Jalpai-guri*, and partly in the south-eastern corner of Bengal, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts* and Hill Tippera*. There are also a few scattered colonies of people speaking languages of this family in Dacca* and Mymensingh*. All these non-Aryan dialects are gradually dying out, and are being replaced by some Aryan form of speech. The main Aryan languages of Bengal are Bengali, Bih\u0101r\u012b, Eastern Hind\u012b, and Oriy\u0101. The Census does not distinguish Bih\u0101r\u012b from Hind\u012b. On the average, of every 1,000 persons in the Province, 528 speak Bengali, 341 Hind\u012b (including Bih\u0101r\u012b), 79 Oriy\u0101, and 1 Khas, leaving only 51 persons per 1,000 for all the other languages put together.\n\nLanguage spoken.\n\n| Language spoken | 1881          | 1891          | 1901          |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Bengali         | 35,785,208    | 37,898,102    | 40,714,099    |\n| Hind\u012b           | 24,390,566    | 25,985,028    | 26,151,361    |\n| Oriy\u0101           | 4,186,272     | 4,605,626     | 4,561,323     |\n| Mund\u0101ri         | 28,183        | 493,453       | 383,843       |\n| Ho              |               |               | 230,911       |\n| Sant\u0101li         | 1,004,239     | 1,360,220     | 1,510,881     |\n| Oraon           | 9,229         | 362,803       | 438,226       |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures are for British territory only.\n\nBengal proper, Bih\u0101r, and Orissa each has its own caste system, with\nmany castes not found elsewhere, and in the north there are numerous representatives of the caste system of Nep\u0101l. Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur is peopled mainly by Dravidian tribes who are still outside the pale of Hinduism, and on the eastern border there are many similar tribes of Mongoloid stock. The main characteristics of the Dravidians are a long head, a very broad bridgeless nose, a full round eye, thick protruding lips, hair inclined to be woolly, somewhat low stature, black colour, and absence of muscle on the limbs, especially the legs. The Mongoloid nose is also broad and bridgeless, but less so than the Dravidian: the head is short, the eye oblique and narrow, the cheek-bones very prominent, the hair coarse and straight, the colour inclined to yellow, and the figure short and clumsy, but very muscular. The Aryan type, which is comparatively rare in Bengal, except among some sections of the higher castes, differs markedly from the others. The head is long, like the Dravidian, but the features are finely cut, and the thin nose in particular is characteristic; the figure is tall and well shaped, and the hair is comparatively fine.\n\nOwing to the size of the Province and the inclusion within its limits of the dissimilar tracts described above, the number of its castes and tribes is exceptionally great. There are 66 castes with 100,000 members, and 15 with a strength of more than a million: namely (in order of numbers), the Ahir (or Go\u0101l\u0101), Br\u0101hman, Kaibartta, R\u0101jbansi (including Koch), Namasudra (Chand\u0101l), Sant\u0101l, Cham\u0101r (including Muchi), R\u0101jput, Kurmi, Teli, K\u0101yasth, Koiri, Dos\u0101dh, B\u0101bhan, and B\u0101gdi. The Ahirs, who number nearly four millions, are by far the most numerous; next follow the Br\u0101hmans with nearly three millions, the Kaibarttas with two and a half millions, and the R\u0101jbansi with over two millions. The Br\u0101hmans and K\u0101yasths are found everywhere, and so also are the Cham\u0101rs, Telis, and Ahirs, though to a less extent; the R\u0101jputs, Kurmis, Koiris, Dos\u0101dhs, and B\u0101bhans are, in the main, Bih\u0101r castes. The home of the Kaibarttas and B\u0101gdis is in West, of the R\u0101jbansi in North, and of the Namasudras in East Bengal; the Sant\u0101ls are one of the great non-Hindu tribes who inhabit the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau.\n\nThe persons who described themselves at the Census as Hindus constitute 63 per cent. of the total population\\(^1\\) of the Province, and the Muhammadans 33 per cent.; all other religions taken together make up only 4 per cent. of the population. Hindus are most numerous in Bih\u0101r (excluding M\u0101lda* and East Purnea), Orissa, and West Bengal, and Muhammadans in the Districts lying east of the Bh\u0101grathi and the Mah\u0101nanda. The Musalm\u0101ns of Bengal form more than two-fifths of the total number in India.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the present area of Bengal, Hindus constitute 78 per cent., Muhammadans 17 per cent., and other religions 5 per cent. of the population.\nThe actual numerical increase since 1891 is about the same for both the main religions; but compared with their previous strength, the followers of the Prophet have increased by nearly 8 per cent., while the Hindus have gained only 4 per cent. The most progressive part of the Province is that inhabited by Muhammadans, while Bih\u0101r, the stronghold of Hinduism, has returned a smaller population than in 1891; but this affords only a partial explanation of the figures, and the Muhammadans have gained ground in every Division as compared with their Hindu neighbours. The subject has been discussed at length in the Census Report for 1901, where it is shown that Isl\u0101m gains to some extent through conversions from Hinduism, but chiefly on account of the greater prolificness of its adherents. They have a more nourishing dietary, their girls marry later, and they permit widow marriage. They are also, in Eastern Bengal, more prosperous than the Hindus, as they have fewer prejudices about changing their residence and move freely to new alluvial formations, where the soil is exceptionally fertile. The advance made by Isl\u0101m is to some extent obscured by the fact that Hinduism has itself been gaining new recruits from the ranks of the animistic tribes\u2014the Sant\u0101ls, Mund\u0101s, Oraons, and other so-called aborigines. These tribes are very prolific, and yet the strength of the animistic religions has increased by only 1 per cent. The natural growth was probably at least 11 per cent., but this has been counterbalanced by conversions to Christianity and Hinduism. Christianity has taken some 60,000 during the decade. The rest (about 200,000) have entered the fold of Hinduism.\n\nThe conventional divisions of Hinduism are better known to the readers of textbooks than to the people themselves. In Bengal proper and Orissa, where the Vaishnava reformer, Chaitanya, gained a great following, the people may often give a definite reply to the question, whether they are followers of Vishnu or of Siva and his wife; but in Bih\u0101r it would be extremely difficult to collect accurate information on the subject. Moreover, it is only the members of the highest castes who concentrate their worship on the deities of the orthodox Hindu pantheon. The everyday religion of the lower orders consists largely of the propitiation of a host of minor deities and spirits. The personified powers of nature\u2014the Earth, Sun, planets, and certain mountains and rivers\u2014are worshipped everywhere; deified heroes are the main objects of veneration in many parts of Bih\u0101r, while in West and part of North Bengal snake-worship is widely prevalent. Farther east various aboriginal deities are adored as forms of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. In addition, almost every village has its special tutelary spirits, who preside over the welfare of the community and have their home in a tree or sacred grove somewhere within its precincts. There are again numerous disembodied spirits of persons who have met with a painful or violent death, e.g. of\nwomen who died in childbirth or of persons killed by wild animals. These hover round the scene of their former existence and cause various kinds of illness and misfortune, and they thus require to be propitiated. In the quaint and childish ceremonial observed at the worship and propitiation of these demons and spirits, the Br\u0101hman has, as a rule, no place.\n\nA third aspect of the amorphous collection of religious ideas known as Hinduism is furnished by the followers of the different persons who have from time to time set themselves up, sometimes as inspired teachers, but more often as incarnations of the supreme deity. The Kart\u0101bhaj\u0101s, for example, regard their founder, a man of the Sadgop caste, as an incarnation of the Divinity, and his descendants are held in equal veneration. The exhibition of fervid love is the only form of religious exercise practised by them, and indescribable excesses are said to take place at their secret nocturnal meetings.\n\nThe religion of the uneducated majority of the people is a mixture of Hinduism and Animism, in which the belief in evil spirits is the main ingredient. There must be something tangible to represent a beneficent or even a malignant spirit, on which vermilion can be rubbed, over which a libation can be poured, and before which a fowl, goat, or pig can be sacrificed. Accordingly, the simple villagers set up a shapeless stone or block, or even a mound of mud, to represent the spirit whom they worship, while side by side with it is a temple dedicated to one of the regular gods of the Hindu pantheon. The architecture of these temples varies greatly in different parts of the Province. In Bih\u0101r their distinguishing feature is a tall pyramidal spire, the outline of which appears originally to have been determined by the natural bend of two bamboos, planted apart in the ground, and drawn together at the top. In Lower Bengal the temples are dome-shaped structures, with a peculiar hog-backed roof, which has obviously been modelled on the form of the ordinary Bengali huts surrounding them.\n\nThe Muhammadans of Bengal are mostly, in name at least, Sunnis. But the great majority are of Hindu origin, and their knowledge of the faith they now profess seldom extends beyond the three cardinal doctrines of the Unity of God, the Mission of Muhammad, and the Truth of the Kor\u0101n. It was, until recently, the regular practice of low-class Muhammadans to join in the Durg\u0101 P\u016bj\u0101 and other Hindu festivals, and, although they have been purged of many superstitions, many still remain. In particular, they are very careful about omens and auspicious days. Dates for weddings are often fixed after consulting a Hindu astrologer; bamboos are not cut, and the building of new houses not commenced, on certain days of the week, and journeys are often undertaken only after referring to the Hindu almanac to see if the proposed day is auspicious. When disease is prevalent, S\u012bt\u0101la and Rakshy\u0101 K\u0101li\nare worshipped. Dharmar\u0101j and Manas\u0101 or Bishahari are also venerated by many ignorant Muhammadans. Sashthi is worshipped when a child is born. Even now in some parts of Bengal they observe the Durg\u0101 Puja and buy new clothes for the festival like the Hindus. In Bih\u0101r they join in the worship of the Sun, and when a child is born they light a fire and place cactus and a sword at the door to prevent the demon Jaw\u0101n from entering and killing the infant. At marriages the bridegroom frequently follows the Hindu practice of smearing the bride's forehead with vermillion. Offerings are made to the gr\u0101mya devat\u0101 ('village god') before sowing or transplanting rice seedlings, and exorcism is resorted to in case of sickness. These practices are gradually disappearing, but they die hard, and amulets containing a text from the Kor\u0101n are commonly worn, even by the Mull\u0101s who inveigh against these survivals of Hindu beliefs.\n\nApart from Hindu superstitions, there are certain forms of worship common among Muhammadans which are not based on the Kor\u0101n. The most common of these is the adoration of departed P\u012brs. When a holy man departs from this life, he is popularly believed to be still present in spirit, and his tomb becomes a place of pilgrimage to which persons resort for the cure of disease or the exorcism of evil spirits, or to obtain the fulfilment of some cherished wish. The educated stoutly deny that P\u012brs are worshipped, and say that they are merely asked to intercede with God, but among the lower classes it is very doubtful if this distinction is recognized. Closely allied to the adoration of P\u012brs is the homage paid to certain mythical persons, among whom Khw\u0101ja Khizr stands pre-eminent. This personage appears to have been a pre-Isl\u0101mic hero of the Arabs, and he is believed at the present day to reside in the seas and rivers of India and to protect mariners from shipwreck.\n\nThese unorthodox beliefs are violently inveighed against by numerous reformers, most of whom owe their inspiration to Ibn Abdul Wahh\u0101b of Nejd in Arabia, who, early in the eighteenth century, founded the sect called Wahh\u0101bi. He rejected the glosses of the Im\u0101ms, denied the superiority of the Ottoman Sult\u0101n, made comparatively light of the authority of Muhammad, and insisted on the necessity for waging war against all infidels. His followers in India at the present day do not accept all his views, and many now hold that India is not a country in which war against the infidels is lawful. But they are all united in their opposition to non-Isl\u0101mic superstitions, and in many places they seem to have succeeded to a great extent in eradicating them.\n\nIn Eastern Bengal the Wahh\u0101bi movement met with considerable success during the nineteenth century. The principal local reformers were Dudhu Mi\u0101n and Kar\u0101mat Al\u012b. The adherents of both are known as Far\u0101z\u012bs, or followers of the law; but there is a considerable difference\nbetween them, the latter being pure revivalists, while the former subscribe to the extreme views of the original Wahh\u00e1b\u00eds regarding infidels.\n\nThe aggregate Christian population in 1901 was 278,366, compared with 192,484 in 1891. Of the total number, 27,489, or 9\u00b79 per cent., belong to European and allied races; 23,114, or 8\u00b73 per cent., are Eurasians; and 227,763, or 81\u00b78 per cent., are native converts or their descendants. About nine-tenths of the Europeans are of British nationality. The great increase of the Christian population during the decade is due to new conversions, especially in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and more particularly in R\u0101nch\u012b, where the German Lutheran missionaries have met with great success. This District now contains 124,958 Christians, against 75,693 only ten years ago. Some other Districts in the Province which show a noteworthy increase in the number of Christians are noted below:\n\n| Number of Christians in | Calcutta. | Sant\u00e1l Parganas. | Darjeeling. | Jalpaiguri* | Burdwan. | Manbhum. | Mymensingh*. |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| 1891                    | 28,997    | 5,943           | 1,502       | 357         | 1,408    | 1,532    | 211         |\n| 1901                    | 37,925    | 9,875           | 4,467       | 2,486       | 2,960    | 2,910    | 1,291       |\n\nThe return of sects shows that 165,528 are Protestants and 108,194 Roman Catholics; the balance consists of persons who failed to specify their sect, and Armenians, &c. Of the Protestants, 61,024 belong to the Anglican communion, 69,580 are Lutherans, 21,621 Baptists, and 6,691 Presbyterians. The remainder belong to various miscellaneous sects.\n\nThe great centre of Roman Catholic missionary enterprise in this Province is R\u0101nch\u012b, where three-fifths of the total number of converts are found. The next largest community of Roman Catholic native Christians is in Dacca*, where they exceed 10,000 (partly descended from Portuguese settlers in the seventeenth century); the number is also considerable in Calcutta, the Twenty-four Parganas, Nadi\u0101, and Champ\u0101ran. The mission in the last-mentioned District is the oldest of all, dating from 1740.\n\nOf the Protestant missions the best known and most successful is that in R\u0101nch\u012b, which was started in 1845 by six German missionaries, under the name of Gossner's Mission. An unfortunate disagreement took place twenty-three years later, and the mission was split up into two sections, the one enrolling itself under the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the other retaining the original designation. The first mission of the Church of England was started in Burdwan in 1816; but the success here has not been so great as that of the offshoot of Gossner's Mission in R\u0101nch\u012b, which has already been mentioned, nor as that in the adjoining District of Nadi\u0101, which was founded by the\nChurch Missionary Society in 1831, and now claims nearly 6,000 native Christians. Among other missions of the Church of England, those in the Twenty-four Parganas, Calcutta, and the Santal Parganas are the most successful. The Baptists have their head-quarters in the swamps of Backergunge* and Faridpur*, where they have been working among the Chandals since 1824. The number of their converts now exceeds 7,000. The Cuttack mission, founded in 1822, claims 2,000 converts. The missionaries of the Church of Scotland have been at work since 1870 in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri* Districts with a fair measure of success.\n\nSo far as the Anglican Church is concerned, the whole of Bengal, with the exception of Chota Nagpur, which is under an Assistant Bishop, lies in the diocese directly administered by the Bishop of Calcutta, the Metropolitan of India. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church vests in an Archbishop resident in Calcutta, who has suffragan sees at Krishnagar and Dacca*; but certain small communities of Portuguese origin are under the Portuguese Vicar-General of Bengal.\n\nOf the other religions returned at the Census it will suffice to mention the Buddhists, numbering about a quarter of a million, found mainly on the confines of Burma and Nepal; the Jains (7,831), who are chiefly immigrant traders; and the Brahmos or Hindu Theists (3,171).\n\n| Religion    | 1881       | 1891       | 1901       |\n|-------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Hindu       | 43,267,460 | 45,217,831 | 46,737,543 |\n| Animist     | 1,668,266  | 2,294,506  | 2,242,770  |\n| Musalm\u0101n    | 21,492,766 | 23,437,352 | 25,265,342 |\n| Christian   | 127,412    | 190,829    | 275,125    |\n| Buddhist    | 155,269    | 189,122    | 210,628    |\n| Others      | 39,321     | 17,321     | 13,458     |\n\nNote.\u2014The figures are for British Districts only, and the details for 1881 and 1891 are the adjusted figures on the area of 1901.\n\nThe most striking feature of the return of occupation is the very large proportion of persons who are dependent on agriculture. Nearly two-thirds of the population are either landlords or tenants; 6 per cent. have been returned as agricultural labourers; and of the 7 per cent. shown as general labourers the great majority must also be mainly dependent on agriculture. About 12 per cent. of the total population (including dependents) are engaged in the preparation and supply of material substances; and of these half find a livelihood by the provision of food and drink, and a fifth by making and dealing in textile fabrics and dress. Domestic and sanitary services provide employment for very few, the number of persons who support themselves in this way being barely 2 per cent. of the population, or less than a third of the proportion so employed in England and Wales. Commerce, transport,\nand storage provide employment for 2 persons in every 100, of whom rather more than half are engaged on transport and storage, and slightly less than half on commerce. Professions, including the priesthood, are the means of subsistence of less than 2 persons per 100.\n\nIn East Bengal the cultivator takes as a rule three meals a day. He begins in the early morning with rice left over from the previous night's supper, parched or popped rice, and jack-fruit or mango when in season. The midday and evening meals have boiled rice as their foundation, and with it are mixed pulses of different kinds, fish, or vegetables. Muhammadans eat meat when they can afford it. Among the poorer classes in Bih\u0101r conditions are very different. The principal meal is taken at nightfall and consists of some coarse grain, such as maize or a millet, boiled into a porridge. A lighter meal of the same diet is taken at midday, but only the well-to-do enjoy two full meals a day. In Orissa rice again forms the staple diet, but the cultivator is content with a full meal in the evening of rice boiled with a little salt, some pulse or vegetables, and perhaps fish; in the morning he eats cold the remains of the evening meal. In Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur a cold meal is taken at noon, and a hot supper in the evening; the food consists sometimes of rice or maize, but more commonly of a millet such as maru\u0101 (Eleusine coracana) or gondli (Panicum miliare), pulses, oil, vegetables, &c. These are eked out with jungle fruits and roots, and especially with the blossoms of the mahua tree (Bassia latifolia) when in season.\n\nThe garments commonly worn by men are the dhoti or waist cloth and the ch\u0101dar or loose cloth worn over the shoulders; those who can afford it wear a pir\u0101n or coat. Among the strict Far\u0101zi Muhammadans of Eastern Bengal, the dhoti is worn as a lung\u012b or kilt, and is frequently of coloured cloth. Muhammadans wear a skull-cap, and Hindus a pagri. In Bih\u0101r the poorer classes wear only the dhoti, and the pagri is reserved for special occasions. For women the s\u0101r\u012b is almost universal, one end being worn over the head and shoulders and fastened to the waist-piece; a bodice is added by those who can afford it, and is commonly worn even by women of the poorest class in North Bih\u0101r. In the towns the men wear an English shirt over the dhoti, the tails hanging loose, and a ch\u0101dar over the shoulders; English socks, loose slippers or shoes, and an umbrella complete the costume. In the fields the agriculturist is content with an exiguous rag round his loins, and in Eastern Bengal a large wicker shield, and in Orissa a wicker hat, protects him from the weather. Girls up to the age of three and boys up to five years generally go naked. All but the very poorest women wear ornaments on wrist, neck, and ankle; these are generally of silver, brass, or lac.\n\nThe houses in Lower Bengal are not congregated into villages, but\neach homestead stands in its own orchard of fruit and palm trees. The sites have been laboriously raised by excavation, which has left tanks in every compound; and the houses are erected on mud plinths and built round a courtyard with wooden or bamboo posts and interlaced walls of split bamboo, with thatched roofs resting on a bamboo framework. The whole is encircled with a bamboo fence, and sometimes by a moat and a thorny cane or cactus hedge. In Bih\u0101r the compounds are smaller, and where the fields are low the houses cluster thickly on the raised village sites; the walls are of mud and the roof tiled or thatched. In the uplands of Bih\u0101r, and in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and Orissa, the homesteads are separate, though they generally adjoin one another; each house is surrounded by a well-manured patch of castor, tobacco, or some other valuable crop.\n\nThe Hindus bury small children who die during the first year after birth; all others are nominally burnt, but where fuel is scarce the cremation is often far from complete, and sometimes consists only of putting a few lighted sticks in the mouth and on the face, after which the corpse is thrown into the nearest river. In tracts near the Ganges it is the practice to carry dead bodies to burning gh\u0101ts on its banks, and in all parts it is considered right that the ashes and main bones should be thrown into the sacred stream. The Muhammadans bury their dead, and so do the Jugis of Eastern Bengal and various sects of ascetics, and also the low castes and most aboriginal tribes. The Jugis place the corpse in a sitting position, with the legs crossed in the conventional attitude of Buddha, and the face turned towards the north-east.\n\nThe chief amusement of the people lies in attending the fairs which are held all over the Province. These gatherings are at stated seasons, generally in connexion with some bathing festival or other religious ceremony, and are attended by numerous hawkers, who set up booths for the sale of miscellaneous articles, by religious mendicants, jugglers, conjurers, actors, and musicians, all of whom contribute their quota to the entertainment of the crowd. Every market is thronged by gaily dressed crowds, who exchange the gossip of the day and discuss the latest cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre while making their weekly purchases. The great annual religious festivals afford an excuse for merry gatherings, especially at the New Year in April, when numbers congregate in the fields and amuse themselves with wrestling, hook-swinging, which now takes the form of a merry-go-round, and gossip. Every one goes mad with merriment at the Holi festival, and many Musalm\u0101ns enjoy the fun as much as the Hindus. Their own religious festivals are attended by devout worshippers; they are very fond of religious discussions, and immense crowds gather when famous Maulvis are pitted against each other to argue some knotty point of law or practice. Football is by far\nthe most popular outdoor game, and huge crowds assemble on the Calcutta maid\u0101n to watch games under Association rules, at which Bengali boys are remarkably proficient. Among the aboriginal tribes hunting, cock-fighting, bull-baiting, drinking bouts, and saturnalian dancing are the chief amusements.\n\nHindu names are threefold. The third name is a family or caste title, such as, among others, Mukhop\u0101dhy\u0101ya (contracted to Mukharji) or Ach\u0101rjya in the case of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47, D\u0101s for a K\u0101yasth, Singh for a R\u0101jp\u016bt. The first two names are appellative, and the middle name is often dropped in actual intercourse. In Bih\u0101r there is generally no middle name. Common affixes denoting a town are -\u0101b\u0101d, -pur, and -nagar; -garh means a fort, -ganj a market, -gaon or -gram a village, and -b\u0101gh a garden: e.g. Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Ch\u0101ndpur, Krishnagar, Roht\u0101sgarh, Sir\u0101jganj, Bangaon, Kurigram, Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh.\n\nThe general characteristics which distinguish agricultural conditions in Bengal are a regular and copious rainfall, a fertile soil, and a dense population subsisting on the produce of the land; but within the Province conditions are by no means uniform, and the important factors of soil, surface, and rainfall vary widely in different localities. The soils may be classed as either gneissic, old alluvium, or recent alluvium, the first two classes being found for the most part to the west, and the last to the east, of the 88th degree of longitude, which passes a few miles west of Calcutta and Darjeeling. The gneissic tract comprises the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau and portions of the neighbouring Districts. Laterite soils are to be found sloping upwards towards the interior from beneath the old alluvium of Orissa and of West Bengal, and overlying part of the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau. For agricultural purposes the whole of this western tract, comprising the sub-province of Bih\u0101r with the exception of M\u0101lda District*, the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Division, and the Burdw\u0101n Division with the exception of Hooghly and Howrah Districts, may be distinguished from the eastern tract of recent alluvium which includes the excepted Districts, the R\u0101jsh\u0101hi*, Presidency, and Dacca* Divisions, the greater part of the Chittagong Division*, and the coast-line of Orissa. The gneissic, laterite, and old alluvial soils are alike mainly dependent upon artificial manures to maintain their fertility, whereas the recent alluvium is periodically fertilized by fresh deposits of silt from the overflowing rivers. The latter process is most active in Eastern Bengal, in the deltas of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, whose waters possess the fertilizing properties of the Nile.\n\nThe conformation of the surface in the old and the new alluvium is widely different, the former being in process of denudation and the latter of formation. In the tract covered by new alluvium the periodical deposits of river silt maintain a perfectly level surface, which is eminently\nadapted for rice cultivation. The surface of the old alluvium, on the other hand, is broken by the scouring action of the rivers and of surface drainage, and the level of the country rises and falls in parallel waves at right angles to the watershed, the crest of each wave lying midway between two rivers. In order to make this undulating surface fit for rice cultivation, an elaborate system of small terraces and low embankments has to be constructed to hold up the rain-water. Where the gradient is steep, the expense of this terracing is prohibitive, and on such slopes rice is generally replaced by some less thirsty crop.\n\nThere are of course local exceptions to this broad classification of soils and surface conditions. In North Bihar, for instance, there are numerous saucer-shaped depressions, sometimes of considerable extent, in which rice thrives. The soil in these depressions is generally a strong clay, with a much smaller admixture of sand than is found in the higher uplands which mark the deposits of some ancient river. Again, in the broad belt of hilly country which surrounds the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, rice can be grown only in the valleys. The hill slopes are steep, and are covered with forest and dense undergrowth, except where they have been artificially cleared. Scanty crops of millets and pulses are raised in patches on the hill-sides; and where the forest has been recently cleared, the primitive form of nomadic culture known as jhion is practised, as it is also in the Chittagong Hill-Tracts*.\n\nThe distinction between the east and west of the Province, due to the difference in soils and surface, is accentuated by the unequal distribution of rainfall, which is generally far less regular and copious in the west than in the east. The annual fall in the western tract averages only 52 inches, as compared with 73 inches in the east. Rain commences much earlier in North and East Bengal than it does farther west, and heavy showers in April and May facilitate the cultivation of jute and early rice. Moreover, the average yearly humidity in the east, including Orissa, is 86 per cent., as compared with only 74 per cent. in the west of the Province.\n\nNot only do the eastern Districts receive a great deal more rain, but, owing to the annual overflow of the great rivers that traverse them, they remain practically under water for six months in the year, and the people live on little island mounds and can move about only by boat. The surface of this tract is low and flat, and much of it is covered with huge marshes where rice and jute luxuriate. In fact, in the east of the Province rice and jute are grown almost exclusively, the former occupying two-thirds, and both together no less than three-fourths, of the gross cropped area.\n\nIn the west all this is changed. Rice is still the principal crop, but the rainfall is often insufficient to bring it to maturity, and has to be supplemented by artificial irrigation; fortunately the broken surface\nadmits of water storage, and there are numerous small streams which can be dammed. The products are far more varied; there is very little jute, and rice accounts for only half the cultivated area, the other crops most extensively grown being maize, barley, wheat, oilseeds, *maru\u0101* (*Eleusine coracana*), and gram. The most striking contrast to the monotony of cropping in East Bengal is furnished by West Bih\u0101r, where an astonishing variety of staples is raised, and where it is by no means unusual to find four crops, such as gram, wheat, sesamum, and linseed, grown together in the same field.\n\nReference has already been made to the nomadic form of cultivation locally known as *jh\u016bm*. A piece of forest land, generally on a hillside, is selected in April: the luxuriant undergrowth of shrubs and creepers is cleared away, and the felled jungle is left to dry till May and is then burnt. At the approach of the rains, small holes are made, and into each is put a handful of mixed seeds, usually cotton, rice, melons, pumpkins, maize, and yams. The crops ripen in succession, the harvest ending with the cotton in October. After a year or two the ground becomes choked with weeds and is abandoned for a new clearance, where the same process is repeated.\n\nIn the Darjeeling Him\u0101layas steep mountain slopes are terraced and revetted with stone for rice cultivation, wherever water is available for irrigation; elsewhere the mountain-sides are sown with maize or millets. In the R\u0101jmah\u0101l hills the level crests are cultivated with the ordinary plains crops, and it is not uncommon in these parts to find rice flourishing on a hill-top.\n\nMore than 56 millions, or 71 per cent. of the entire population of Bengal, are supported by agriculture; and of every 100 agriculturists 89 are rent-paying tenants, 9 are agricultural labourers, and 2 live on their rents. The proportion of field-labourers varies widely in different parts, being as high as 16 per cent. of the agricultural population in the Patna Division, and as low as 2 per cent. in the Dacca Division*. The agriculturists are far better off in the east of the Province than in the west. Not only are their profits much higher, especially from the very lucrative jute crop, but they enjoy a far larger measure of rights in the soil.\n\nNo record is maintained in Bengal of the cropping of each field from year to year, and accurate statistics of agriculture are not available. The District officers furnish periodical estimates to the Agricultural department of the areas in each District under each of the more important crops, and it is upon these estimates that the agricultural statistics of the Province are based. These are not sufficiently accurate to form the basis of a reliable comparison between the results of successive years, except in the case of such crops as jute and indigo, to which special attention is devoted. Such as they are, they apply to the whole of British territory, excluding the Chittagong Hill Tracts*\nand the Sundarbans. They show that of the total area\\(^1\\) of 1,46,132 square miles, 76,454 square miles, or 52.5 per cent., were cropped in 1903-4. Of the remainder, 4,372 square miles, or 3 per cent. of the whole, were covered with forests, 35,263 square miles (24.1 per cent.) were not available for cultivation, 19,470 square miles, or 13.3 per cent., were cultivable waste other than fallow, and 10,573 square miles (7.2 per cent.) were fallow. An area of 16,925 square miles, or 22 per cent. of the cultivated area, was returned as cropped more than once in the year.\n\nFood-crops occupy 82 per cent. of the gross cropped area; 6 per cent. is under oilseeds, 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. under fibres, and sugar-cane and tobacco each occupy about 1 per cent. Of the food-crops, rice is by far the most important, as it occupies 54,690 square miles, or 71 per cent. of the net cropped area. Next come various cereals and pulses with 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent., and these are followed by maize (4 per cent.), wheat and barley (3 per cent. each), and gram and maru\u0101 (2 per cent. each). Among the non-food-crops, jute (5 per cent.) occupies an area second only to that of rice. Of the oilseeds, rape and mustard, together covering 3,125 square miles, are grown most extensively.\n\nThere are innumerable varieties of rice, each possessing special characteristics which adapt its cultivation to particular localities. They may all, however, be classified, according to the harvesting season, under three main heads: the winter rice, occupying 42,970 square miles; the early rice, 10,940 square miles; and the spring crop, 780 square miles.\n\nThe winter rice is grown on low land. A piece of high ground is usually selected for a seed nursery, ploughed in May or June after the first rain, and sown broadcast. In July or August the seedlings are transplanted to flooded fields, which have been ploughed and re-ploughed till the whole surface is reduced to mud, and the crop is harvested between November and January. In the swamps of Eastern Bengal, however, a variety of long-stemmed rice is sown broadcast after one or two ploughings; by harvest-time the fields are several feet under water, and the rice, which rises with the flood-level, is reaped from boats, the ears only being cut. In West Bih\u0101r the fields are drained in September when the rice is flowering, and flooded when the grain is forming in October. It is this practice, known as nigarh, which makes\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In Bengal as now constituted, the net cropped area was 54,138 square miles, or 49.1 per cent. of the total area of 110,217 square miles. Of the remainder, 4,419 square miles, or 4 per cent. of the whole, were covered with forests, 26,161 square miles (23.7 per cent.) were not available for cultivation, 16,421 square miles (14.9 per cent.) were cultivable waste other than fallow, and 9,078 square miles (8.3 per cent.) were fallow. Altogether 10,369 square miles, or 9.4 per cent. of the net cropped area, were returned as cropped more than once in the year.\nrainfall or artificial irrigation in the beginning of October essential to a successful harvest.\n\nThe early rice is generally sown broadcast in April or May, though it is occasionally transplanted; the crop is harvested in August or September. Spring rice is grown on the low banks of rivers or on the edges of swamps. The seed is sown in a nursery in October and transplanted a month later; the crop is harvested in March and April. The yield per acre of cleaned rice is estimated at 11\u00b702 cwt. for winter rice and 7\u00b734 cwt. for the early and spring crops. This is the average yield for the Province; in the rich rice swamps of Eastern Bengal the return is at least half as much again, while on the sterile uplands of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur not half this estimate is realized. Unhusked rice or paddy yields about three-fifths of its weight as cleaned rice.\n\nMaize occupies 3,125 square miles, mainly in Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and in Darjeeling District. It is a valuable food-crop, yielding 7\u00b734 cwt. per acre; it is sown in June and harvested in September or October. Wheat and barley each cover about 2,344 square miles, and both are grown principally in Bih\u0101r, barley thriving best north of the Ganges, and wheat south of that river; both are sown in November and reaped in March. The out-turn of wheat is estimated at 8\u00b781 cwt. to the acre for Bih\u0101r, 7\u00b771 cwt. for Bengal, and 4\u00b704 cwt. for Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, the average for the Province being 5\u00b787 cwt. The normal yield of barley is 7\u00b788 cwt. per acre. Gram (Cicer arietinum) is a pulse which thrives on clay soils, and is grown on over 1,560 square miles, principally in Bih\u0101r and Central Bengal. It is in the ground from November to March, and yields about 7\u00b788 cwt. to the acre. Maru\u0101 is a valuable millet which occupies nearly 1,560 square miles in Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. It is sown in July and reaped in November, and the average yield is 7\u00b734 cwt. per acre. Jow\u0101r (Sorghum vulgare) and bajra or spiked millet (Pennisetum typhoideum) are grown in Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; they are sown in July and reaped in November\u2013December, and yield about 7\u00b734 cwt. per acre. Jow\u0101r is grown as a fodder-crop in Central Bengal.\n\nMore than 1,562 square miles, principally in Bih\u0101r, are under various cereals and pulses, which are sown in November and reaped in March or April. Among these are the china millet (Panicum miliaceum), peas, lentils, kalai (Phaseolus radiatus), kurth\u012b (Dolichos biflorus), and khes\u0101ri (Lathyrus sativus). Some other cereals and pulses are sown in July and reaped in December. These occupy 1,953 square miles, and include rahar (Cajanus indicus), gondli (Panicum miliare), kodon (Paspalum scrobiculatum), a species of kalai, and urd (Phaseolus Roxburghii).\n\nJute is commercially the most important crop in the Province, and its cultivation is developing rapidly. In 1872 it occupied less than 1,560 square miles, while at the present time the normal area is probably\nnot far short of 3,900 square miles, and the exports in 1900-1, a bumper year, were valued at 14 millions sterling. The tract in North and East Bengal which lies between 23\u00b0 and 26\u00b0 30' N. and 88\u00b0 and 91\u00b0 E. is by far the largest jute-growing area in the world. The crop is sown in April and reaped in August, and, after retting, the fibre is baled to save freight. The chief centres of the jute trade and baling are Narayan-ganj*, Sirajganj*, and Chandpur*. The average yield per acre is estimated at 10\u00b771 cwt.\n\nThe various oilseeds are commercially important, and collectively occupy nearly 6,250 square miles. Rape and mustard account for more than half this area, and are grown extensively in North Bengal and Mymensingh*. Linseed is commonly grown as a catch-crop after the winter rice has been reaped. Other oilseeds are til or gingelly (Sesamum indicum), castor, and sarguja or niger-seed (Guizotia abyssinica), the latter grown largely in Chota Nagpur. These are mostly spring crops, sown in October and harvested in March. Rape, mustard, and linseed yield about 4\u00b741 cwt. per acre, and the other crops about 3\u00b712 cwt.\n\nSugar-cane, with 1,020 square miles, is usually planted in February or March and occupies the ground for ten or eleven months; the normal out-turn is 22 cwt. per acre. The juice is boiled and sold as gur or jaggery, and is also refined into sugar; large refineries have recently been started at Ottur in Muzaffarpur, and elsewhere in North-West Bihar, where the cultivation of sugar-cane is to some extent replacing indigo. Tobacco is grown everywhere in small quantities and occupies 780 square miles; it is cultivated on a large scale in Rangpur* and the neighbouring Districts of North Bengal, whence the leaf is exported to Burma and made into cigars. The produce varies from 4\u00b741 to 8\u00b782 cwt. per acre in Bengal, and from 11\u00b775 to 14\u00b769 cwt. in Bihar; it is sown in November and reaped in March.\n\nIndigo occupies 390 square miles, chiefly in North Bihar, though it is still cultivated in Central Bengal; the area is shrinking, as the natural dye suffers from competition with the artificial substitute. Indigo is sown in March, and the leaf is cut in July and again in September; the yield of dye varies from 12 lb. per acre in Bengal to 20 lb. in Bihar. The general practice is for the planter to take a lease of a village, and then arrange with the cultivators to grow indigo, assisting them with seed and cash advances, though in some places the villagers grow it independently and sell it to the factory by weight.\n\nThe poppy is grown in West Bihar, and to a small extent in Chota Nagpur, and occupies 390 square miles. It is cultivated with the help of Government advances, and the opium is sold at a fixed rate to Government, as will be described in the section on Miscellaneous Revenue. The seed is sown in November, and the crop is collected in March and April; the yield varies from 10 lb. to 18 lb. per acre. Cotton\nis little grown; there is none in the plains of Bengal proper, and elsewhere it occupies only about 125 square miles. One crop is sown in July and harvested in November, and another is sown in October and harvested in April. Tea is cultivated on a large scale only in Jalpaiguri*, Darjeeling, and Chittagong*; in 1903 there were 422 gardens, with a total area of 210 square miles and an out-turn of 51,000,000 lb. The average yield from mature plants is 367 lb. per acre; but the out-turn varies in different parts, averaging 453 lb. an acre in Jalpaiguri*, 313 lb. in Chittagong*, and 288 lb. or less elsewhere. The value of the crop in 1901 was 1\u00bd crores, and the average price per pound in the same year was 5\u00bc annas, compared with 7\u00bd annas twelve years previously. This disastrous fall in prices is due mainly to overproduction; but during the last two or three years there have been very few fresh extensions of tea cultivation, and it may be hoped that better times are in store for this important industry. Ganja (Cannabis sativa) is a Government monopoly and is grown on 1,100 acres in Rajshahi District*; the yield varies from 10 to 21 cwt. per acre. It is sown in August and harvested in February.\n\nAmong non-food-crops grown in the rains are hemp and mulberry, the latter chiefly in Malda*, Murshidabad, Rajshahi*, and Bogra*. In the winter are grown condiments, such as chillies (Capsicum frutescens) and onions, the safflower dye, and oats, which are generally used for fodder. Turmeric is sown in June and harvested in March, and ginger is sown in June and harvested from December to February. The pan creeper (Piper Betle) is planted in May or June in a thatched enclosure, and the leaves are ready for picking in twelve months. Among other condiments are garlic, coriander, cumin, and aniseed. Large areas are given up to thatching grasses, such as ulu grass (Imperata arundinacea) and kus (Saccharum spontaneum). In the Santal Parganas and parts of Chota Nagpur sabai grass (Ischaemum angustifolium) grows on the hilly slopes and is carefully preserved; it is used locally for twine and rope, and it is also extensively employed in the manufacture of paper. Reeds, such as the hogla (Typha elephantina), nal (Amphidonax Kaika), and sitalpati (Phrynium dichotomum), are extensively grown and woven into mats.\n\nA strong prejudice exists against night-soil or bonemeal as manure, and chemical manures are practically unknown. Cattle-dung is used wherever it can be spared, but it is largely burned as fuel, and little or no use is made of the urine. The feeding of the cattle is also so poor that their dung is not rich in manurial constituents. House-sweepings are freely utilized, generally in the form of ashes. What little manure is available is mostly applied close to the homesteads for garden crops, and for maize, tobacco, castor, and poppy. Castor and mustard-cake are occasionally used as a top-dressing for sugar-cane and\npotatoes. In East Bengal rice straw is sometimes burnt as a manure, and sugar-cane, garden crops, potatoes, and tobacco are generally manured, though the quantity applied is very small. In Bih\u0101r refuse indigo is used with avidity where it is available in the neighbourhood of factories, and pond mud is very highly valued.\n\nClay soils grow winter rice year after year; occasionally a catch-crop of *khes\u0101ri* is taken as a fodder, or, if the land continues moist until harvest time, it may be ploughed and sown in East Bengal with *kalai*, and in Bih\u0101r with gram and peas or barley. Lighter soils generally bear two crops in the year\u2014in the rainy season, early rice or jute in North and Lower Bengal, and maize or some of the inferior millets in Bih\u0101r or Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; in the winter a pulse or an oilseed in Bengal, and a mixture of various pulses and oilseeds with wheat or barley in Bih\u0101r. Potatoes often follow maize in Bih\u0101r, and jute or early rice in North and Lower Bengal, and jute itself is sometimes rotated with early rice. Sugar-cane is an exhausting crop and is generally rotated with rice. The mixture of pulses and cereals serves the purpose of rotation, as the pulses belong to the leguminous family and enrich the soil with nitrogen.\n\nAmong the cultivated fruits are the mango (*Mangifera indica*), plantain (*Musa sapientum*), pineapple (*Ananassa sativa*), jack-fruit (*Artocarpus integrifolia*), guava (*Psydium pomiferum*), custard-apple (*Anona squamosa*), *l\u012bch\u012b* (*Nephelium Litchi*), and several varieties of fig and melon. Many parts of East Bengal are studded with coco-nut plantations. The mangoes of Darbhanga and M\u0101lda* enjoy a high reputation. Vegetables are everywhere cultivated in garden plots for household use, and also on a larger scale in the neighbourhood of large towns. The favourite are the egg-plant or *baigun* (*Solanum Melongena*), ground-nut (*Trichosanthes dioica*), pumpkin (*Lagenaria vulgaris*), gourd (*Benincasa cerifera*), and arum (*Colocasia Antiquorum*) grown in the rains, while in the winter potatoes, yams, melons, and radishes are largely cultivated. Cauliflowers and cabbages are also common, and spinach and onions are universal. Potatoes are extensively grown on the rich soils bordering the Ganges in West Bih\u0101r, and in the Hooghly and Burdwan Districts of West Bengal; they yield about 2 tons to the acre.\n\nThere has been a steady increase of cultivation during the last twenty years, but the earlier statistics were so defective that they do not afford evidence of this increase. Tillage is extended by felling the forests on upland tracts and in the submontane *tarai*, by reclaiming the sandy islands which are constantly forming in the big rivers, by embanking lands in the littoral tracts, and by cultivating the swamps of Eastern Bengal, the level of which is being gradually raised by silt deposits.\n\nAn Agricultural Institute under the Government of India has been opened at P\u016bsa in Darbhanga District. Experimental farms under the\n-superintendence of the Agricultural department are established at Sibpur, Burdw\u0101n, and Dumraon, and demonstration farms have recently been started at Chittagong* and Angul. Experiments have been made with improved varieties of rice, wheat, sugar-cane, and potatoes, and with manures for these crops; the cultivation of potatoes has been extended, and Burdw\u0101n sugar-canies have been introduced into Bih\u0101r. Useful work has been done in the direction of stimulating the out-turn of raw silk, by training the rearers to eradicate pebrine and other diseases of the silkworm. An agricultural class is attached to the Sibpur Engineering College, but it has not been successful; it is to be moved to P\u016bsa. The department has recently extended its sphere of activity in many directions. Special investigations have been made into the alleged deterioration of jute, efforts have been made to extend the cultivation of cotton, aid has been given to indigo research operations, and an experimental farm has been started at Cuttack to show cultivators what can be done with water always at command. Besides this, agricultural associations, working in co-operation with the department, have been established in order to help it with advice, to disseminate agricultural knowledge by communicating the results of its operations to the people, and to awaken further interest in the development of the agriculture of the Province. A Central Association has been formed at Calcutta, and Divisional and District Associations are being formed in the interior, which will work in concert with this central body.\n\nLoans are rarely taken from Government, and in 1903-4 the total sum amounted to only 3.6 lakhs, of which nearly half was advanced in Pal\u0101mau District. It is too early to pronounce an opinion on the prospects of the Agricultural banks which have recently been started; but 58 banks are now in existence, and some of them seem to be working successfully.\n\nLittle attention has been directed in Bengal to the subject of the indebtedness of the cultivators, and in the Province generally the question has never reached an acute stage. In a great part of Bengal proper a system akin to peasant proprietorship prevails, and the rich profits of jute cultivation are shared by all the cultivating classes. In Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur the peasantry are as a class impoverished, but there is little evidence to show the extent of their indebtedness. In Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and the Sant\u0101l Parganas, the Bengali money-lender at one time threatened to oust the improvident aborigines from their lands; but land transfer to Bengalis has now been prohibited, and the prohibition is strictly enforced at the time of rent settlement. In various parts of the Province a survey and record-of-rights are in progress, which aim at securing to the ryots the fixity of status and the immunity from arbitrary enhancement which the Tenancy Act prescribes, and the Settlement officers have made careful inquiries as\nto the extent of indebtedness in Gay\u0101, Champ\u0101ran, and Muzaffarpur Districts, where, if anywhere in the Province, it might be expected to be serious. The inquiries in Muzaffarpur and Gay\u0101 show that cultivators owe on the average Rs. 2\u20136 a head and cultivating labourers Rs. 1\u20135, and that indebtedness is decreasing. In Champ\u0101ran the tenantry are badly off, and, during the decade preceding the settlement, 14 per cent. of the cultivators' holdings had been sold or mortgaged to money-lenders. The people are thriftless, and the majority are in debt to the mah\u0101jan. In S\u0101ran only one-fifth of the cultivators are in debt, and their total indebtedness is estimated at less than a crore, whereas the net profits of cultivation amount to over $3\\frac{1}{2}$ crores. In the whole Province only 7,000 holdings were purchased by money-lenders in 1902, and there is no indication that the peasantry as a body are in danger of losing their lands to money-lenders. A common rate of interest is 36 per cent. per annum.\n\nThe implements in universal use are the plough, harrow, sickle, and hoe, and they vary in size and shape according to the strength of the draught cattle in use, the texture of the soil, and the description of cultivation practised. The ploughs in Bih\u0101r are generally heavier and more effective than in Bengal, and work the soil to a depth of 5 inches, whereas those in use in North Bengal scratch the surface to a depth of only 2 inches. The Cuttack and No\u0101kh\u0101l\u012b* ploughs are very heavy, and the two sides are shaped like mould-boards, giving them the appearance of ridging ploughs. The Bibiyy\u0101 sugar-cane mill, made in Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, and a similar type of mill made at Kushtia in Nadi\u0101 are the only improved implements which are really popular; they have largely superseded the native wooden mills.\n\nThe cattle are generally poor, especially in the east of the Province, where pasture is deficient; in the north-west some improvement has been effected by crossing with bulls imported from the United Provinces. The chief breeds of cattle are the Patna, Sit\u0101marhi, Bachaur, and Bh\u0101galpuri in Bih\u0101r, and the Siri and Nep\u0101li in Darjeeling. These are worth from Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a head, though the Patna milch-cattle, which were crossed half a century ago with an imported short-horn strain, sell for Rs. 80. Good buffaloes are to be found in the forests and swampy island flats, and are much prized for their milk. The only horses bred in Bengal are the weedy indigenous ponies or t\u0101ts, which are found everywhere and are worth from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 each. Goats abound, but are very small. Sheep are bred in Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; the Patna breed is the best.\n\nPasture is plentiful in the neighbourhood of the few forests and on the river islands; but it is very scanty elsewhere, especially in Bengal proper, where every inch of land grows rice and the cattle have to be\ncontent with such scanty herbage as the roadsides, tank banks, and field boundary ridges afford. Cart bullocks and plough bullocks are partly stall-fed on chopped rice straw when at work, and milch-buffaloes are carefully tended; but the cattle generally are under-fed and miserably housed, and no attempts are made to improve the breed. In Bih\u0101r and elsewhere dedicated bulls roam the countryside and feed on the fat of the land, but they are not selected for breeding. The cattle suffer from rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, haemorrhagic septicaemia, and malaria, and occasionally from anthrax. The Civil Veterinary department trains young men at the Bengal Veterinary College at Belg\u0101chia, and distributes them to the District boards and other bodies requiring their services; the total number of passed students from this college who were employed as veterinary assistants or in other capacities under these bodies and under Government in 1903\u20134 was 46.\n\nA large number of cattle and horse fairs are held, the largest being those at Sonpur, S\u012bt\u0101marhi, S\u016bri, and Kalimpong. At these fairs cattle shows are held, and prizes are given for the best specimens exhibited.\n\nThe copious and regular rainfall renders irrigation far less essential than in other parts of India, and it is almost unknown in a great part of Bengal proper. Statistics are available only for the areas irrigated from Government canals; and in 1903\u20134 less than 2 per cent. of the rice crop and only about 2 per cent. of the wheat crop were supplied with water from this source. The principal crops irrigated are winter rice, wheat, barley, poppy, sugar-cane, and potatoes. Of these, winter rice is by far the most important. It is not irrigated in East or North Bengal, and but seldom in the Presidency Division, while in North Bih\u0101r it is only irrigated near the foot of the Him\u0101layas, where the hill streams can be dammed without much difficulty. In Orissa there are large irrigation works, but they are not much resorted to in normal years. In the Burdw\u0101n and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur Divisions, however, and in South Bih\u0101r, the natural supply of rain-water is insufficient, and rice can be grown only with the aid of artificial irrigation. This is chiefly necessary in October; but if the rains are late in starting, water is also required for the seed-beds, and again at the time of transplantation. Wheat and barley are commonly grown without irrigation, except in the vicinity of homesteads in North Bih\u0101r, where they get two or three waterings from wells in November and December. The poppy is generally irrigated from wells and requires weekly watering. Sugar-cane is irrigated, except in North Bih\u0101r and North Bengal; it is watered once a fortnight during April, May, and June, and once a month in November and December. Potatoes are irrigated once a fortnight in Burdw\u0101n, Hooghly, Patna, and Cuttack, but not usually elsewhere.\nBengal possesses three important systems of irrigation canals\u2014the Son, the Orissa, and the Midnapore. The Son Canals in Bih\u0101r are fed from the Son river by means of a weir at Dehri; they supply water to Sh\u0101hab\u0101d District on the west and to Gay\u0101 and Patna Districts on the east. The system comprises (1903\u20134) 367 miles of main and branch canals, of which 218 are navigable, with 1,217 miles of distributaries, and 3,237 miles of village channels which are private property. The supply of water available for the kharif or autumn irrigation is about 6,500 cubic feet per second. For the rabi or spring crops the supply is always ample. The demand fluctuates greatly according to the rainfall in September and October; the area irrigated in 1903\u20134 was 790 square miles, compared with 756 square miles in 1902\u20133. In the hot season the supply of water is very limited, but there is usually sufficient for the irrigation of about 25,000 acres of sugar-cane.\n\nThe Orissa Canals are fed mainly from the Mah\u0101n\u0101di river, but derive part of their supply from the Br\u0101hman\u012b and Baitaran\u012b, there being in all seven anicuts or weirs. The country served by these canals lies chiefly in the delta of the Mah\u0101nadi, and, being liable to inundation, it has been necessary to protect the irrigated tracts by marginal flood embankments. Four main canals\u2014the T\u0101ldanda, the Kendr\u0101p\u0101ra, the M\u0101chgaon, and the High Level\u2014comprise 301 miles of main and branch canals, of which 205 miles are navigable, and 1,166 miles of distributaries. There are no village channels. The supply which can be given in the kharif season is 4,550 cubic feet per second. During the rabi season there is very little demand for water. Sugar-cane is little cultivated in these parts.\n\nThe Midnapore Canal is supplied from the K\u0101sai river. It is 72 miles in length and is navigable throughout, and possesses 267 miles of distributaries and 30 miles of village channels. The capacity of discharge is 1,500 cubic feet per second. The supply at the end of the kharif season is, however, uncertain, and in a dry autumn there is frequently difficulty in meeting the demand for water. There is little irrigation in the rabi season.\n\nIn the north-west corner of Champ\u0101ran District the Triben\u012b Canal is being constructed as a protective work. It is designed to carry enough water to irrigate about 178 square miles.\n\nTable III at the end of this article (p. 346) gives the principal figures connected with these systems of canals; the falling off in navigation tolls is due to the development of railways.\n\nThe \u2018minor\u2019 irrigation works maintained by Government are the S\u0101ran, the Eden, and the Tiar or Madhuban canals. The S\u0101ran canals have a head sluice on one of the side channels of the Gandak river. There is no weir, and, owing to alterations in the main channel, it is\nvery difficult to feed the canals, which for the present are closed. The Eden canal takes off from the D\u0101modar river in Burdwan. It was intended primarily to supply fresh water to some old river-beds as a sanitary measure, but it is also used for the irrigation of about 42 square miles. The Tiar canal in the north of Champaran is supplied from the stream of the same name, and can irrigate 9 square miles.\n\nThe sale of water for irrigation is regulated by Act III (B.C.) of 1876, which provides that it shall only be supplied on a written request. For rice, leases are entered into for a term of years in which the lands to be irrigated are specified in detail; the quantity of water to be given is not mentioned, but there is an implied obligation to supply what is needed. In charging for the irrigation of rabi and sugar-cane, it is not practicable to determine beforehand precisely which lands are to be supplied, and the principle of the Northern India Act is adopted, i.e. an acreage rate is charged on those fields which are actually irrigated.\n\nThe principal private irrigation works are reservoirs and water channels. This form of irrigation is mainly practised in the gneissic and old alluvial tracts, where the broken surface facilitates water-storage. In hilly country the reservoir is made by throwing an embankment across a drainage channel, but on more level ground the surface-water is confined in an artificial catchment basin, of a more or less rectangular shape, by an embankment raised on three sides of the rectangle. Artificial channels are dug parallel to the beds of rivers which have a steep gradient, to irrigate high lands down stream; many of these are large works with numerous branches and distributaries. Comparatively little use is made of wells for irrigation, though a good deal of land along the banks of the Ganges in Patna and Muzaffarpur Districts is watered from earthen wells, and small masonry wells are to be found near the houses in Bih\u0101r, and are used for irrigating poppy and other crops. The cost of a masonry well varies from Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 and of a kachcha well from Rs. 2 to Rs. 5. Tanks are used to a considerable extent for irrigating rice, especially in Burdwan.\n\nNumerous water-lifts are used, such as the lever and bucket or skin bag, the swing-basket, and the spoon irrigation lever. The first-mentioned lever is fitted to a forked tree or masonry pillar, and counterpoised by clods of earth. When bullocks are used, they are yoked to a rope which passes over a pulley carried on a cross-beam, supported on two masonry pillars. The basket is swung by two men with the aid of ropes tied to the corners, and is used for raising water from a river or tank. The spoon irrigation lever is a canoe-shaped dug-out working on a pivot. When the level of water is very low, two or more successive lifts are required.\n\nThe importance of the Bengal fisheries may be gauged from the fact\nthat 1\u00b76 per cent. of the population is engaged in catching, curing, and selling fish, a percentage which rises to 2\u00b76 in the Presidency, Rajshahi* and Dacca* Divisions; moreover, one cultivator in every twenty is returned as a fisherman also. The waters of the Bay, the rivers, and swamps swarm with fish, and every ditch and puddle furnishes small fry to eke out the frugal diet of the people. The best salt-water fish are the bokti, tapsi or mango-fish, mullet, pomfret, and sole. Inland the hilsa (Clupea ilisha) is found in shoals in the Ganges, while the rohu (Labeo rohita) and the kat\u00e1l (Catla buchanani) abound everywhere, as do also innumerable other varieties much esteemed by the Bengalis; prawns and crabs are caught in myriads. The mahseer is found in the higher reaches of the rivers which debouch from the Himalayas, and in some of the rivers of the Chot\u00e1 Nagpur plateau.\n\nThe Bengali is a very clever fisherman. In the Bay of Bengal he practises deep-sea fishing, drying his catch ashore on stakes driven into some sandy beach. The larger rivers are trawled from a sailing boat, and the smaller streams are fished from weirs. The tanks and ditches are periodically dragged, the fish at other times being angled or caught in a cast-net. Every streamlet is studded with hundreds of wicker fish-traps, while prawn cages are ubiquitous. The wonder is that any living fish escapes, so persistent and remorseless is the hunt for the finny tribe. Every other interest is subordinated to its pursuit, and not only is navigation impeded, but the drainage of the country is blocked by the obstruction of every channel and outlet.\n\nThe right of fishery in all but the largest rivers has generally been alienated by Government to private persons, having been included in the 'assets' on which the permanent settlement of estates was based, but in some cases the fishery itself is a separate 'estate.' In tanks the right of fishing vests in the owner or occupant; in the Bay and large rivers fishing is free to all.\n\nThe conditions which determine the rent paid by the actual cultivator to his immediate landlord vary widely in different parts of the Province, and even in different estates. In some large estates it is paid according to rates current throughout a village, while in others lump-rents prevail. In Orissa and the Sant\u00e1l Parganas the rents have been fixed by Settlement officers. In Bengal proper, lump-rents are generally paid, except for newly reclaimed lands, and inquiry often fails to detect the existence of any standard rates known to the people. In large estates in Bih\u00e1r, on the other hand, it is usual to find the rent calculated according to rates applied to different classes of soil or to particular crops. Generally speaking, the principal factors which affect the incidence of rent are the fertility of the land, the density of population, the antiquity of the holding, the social position of the tenant, and the position and character of\nthe landlord. Where the population is dense, there is a keen demand for arable land and rents rule high. On the other hand, rents which were fixed some years ago are lower than those recently settled, because prices and rent rates have steadily increased for many years. A Br\u0101hman, again, usually pays a lower rate than a man of low caste. The highest rents prevail where the landlord is a petty proprietor or a middleman resident in the village. Specially high rent rates are usually paid for land under special crops, such as sugar-cane, p\u0101n, mulberry, and poppy. The cultivators have been protected from arbitrary rent enhancement and eviction by the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885, but, owing to the apathy and ignorance of the peasantry, the Act has remained a dead letter over a great part of the Province. In Bih\u0101r, especially, the tenant is still very much at the mercy of his landlord, who rarely gives him a written lease. In Eastern Bengal conditions are different. Documents are far more freely interchanged, the demand for cultivators to till the land is keen, and the tenant has the best of the bargain.\n\nLittle accurate information is available in Bengal regarding rates of rent, but the following are the average rates per acre ascertained by Settlement officers. In Eastern Bengal Rs. 4 is paid in Tippera*, and Rs. 5\u201312 in Chittagong*, where rents rule very high: the ordinary minimum and maximum rates probably range from Rs. 3 to Rs. 12. In Orissa rents vary from Rs. 1\u20138 to Rs. 4, the average being Rs. 2\u20138. In Central Bengal they run from Rs. 3\u20134 to Rs. 8\u201311, the average being Rs. 5\u20138, and in North Bih\u0101r the limits are Rs. 1\u201314 and Rs. 4\u20135, the average being about Rs. 3\u20132 an acre. In Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur the rents are much lower, varying from 8 annas to Rs. 2, with an average of Rs. 1\u20134, while in the Sant\u0101l Parganas the average is Rs. 4\u20134, the limits being Rs. 3\u201312 and Rs. 6\u201312. The rates of rent for special crops occasionally rise much higher, the maximum rates recorded for tobacco being Rs. 37\u20138; for sugar-cane, Rs. 18; for potato and poppy, Rs. 20; and for p\u0101n, Rs. 75.\n\nRent is extensively paid in kind in Gay\u0101, Sh\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d, and Patna Districts, where the character of the country renders the maintenance of an elaborate system of irrigation necessary; but to a less extent such rents are to be found throughout the Province. Different methods of payment prevail; sometimes the grain is divided on the threshing floor, or the standing crop is appraised, while sometimes a fixed payment in grain is made irrespective of the yield. In Bengal newly reclaimed lands are often tilled by temporary settlers, who contract to raise a crop and give the landlord half of it; they erect temporary shelters for the season, and throw up the land at the end of it.\n\nWages for all kinds of labour are lowest in Bih\u0101r and highest in Bengal, Orissa occupying an intermediate position. The actual daily\nrates for skilled and unskilled labour in the different sub-provinces and in the three chief cities are shown below:\n\n| Sub-provinces | Cities |\n|---------------|--------|\n|               | Bengal | Orissa | Bihar | Calcutta | Dacca* | Patna |\n| Skilled labour | A. P. 7 | A. P. 10 | A. P. 5 | A. P. 3 | A. P. 9 | A. P. 8 | A. P. 11 | A. P. 6 | A. P. 7 | A. P. 3 | A. P. 0 |\n| Unskilled do. | A. P. 4 | A. P. 1 | A. P. 2 | A. P. 9 | A. P. 2 | A. P. 6 | ... | A. P. 3 | A. P. 4 | A. P. 2 | A. P. 0 |\n\nIn Bih\u0101r there has been a nominal rise of 7 per cent. in the wages of unskilled labour during the last decade, and in Bengal of 14 per cent.; in Orissa, on the other hand, wages are reported to have fallen 12 per cent. during the same period. In Patna city they have increased 9 per cent., while a decrease of 2 per cent. has taken place in Dacca*. The wages of skilled labour have increased by 11 per cent. in Bih\u0101r, 15 per cent. in Orissa, and 5 per cent. in Bengal; they have increased in Calcutta by 20 per cent., while in Patna and Dacca* they are reported to have fallen by 5 and 13 per cent. respectively.\n\nThe remuneration of village servants is fixed by custom. In Bih\u0101r each artisan takes his recognized share of grain when the crop has been reaped and brought to the threshing-floor; he often holds in addition a small plot of land rent-free, in remuneration for services rendered to the zam\u012bnd\u0101r. In Orissa the village employ\u00e9s serve a fixed circle of from 30 to 50 families and receive small monthly payments of grain and money, with other customary perquisites. This system is not found in Bengal proper, where the village organization, with its complete equipment of servants and artisans, never seems to have been developed.\n\nThe rise in wages has not kept pace with the increase in the price of food-grains, for, whereas during the last twenty years the price of rice has risen by 38\u00b75 per cent., the wages of unskilled labour have risen by only 15 and of skilled labour by 25\u00b74 per cent. during the same period. The fact is that wages are largely governed by custom, and it seems probable that the increased demand for labour due to the development of railways and to industrial expansion has had more to do with the rise in wages than the increase in the price of food-grains. The payment of day-labourers and village artisans and servants in kind also tends to keep down wages in spite of high prices.\n\nThe average prices of certain staples at important centres during the last three decades and for the year 1903-4 are shown in Table IV at the end of this article (p. 347). The increase during the years 1890-1900 was due to the famines of the decades, which caused a heavy drain of food-stuffs from this Province,\nThe masses are much better off and enjoy a more generous diet in Lower Bengal and Orissa than in Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. The annual cost of living per head of an average adult cultivator is estimated at Rs. 15 in Bih\u0101r, Rs. 20 in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and Rs. 35 to Rs. 45 in Lower Bengal and Orissa. An ordinary hut costs from Rs. 5 to Rs. 40, and a well-to-do family has three or four of them. The furniture consists of mats, one or two wooden boxes, bamboo baskets, earthen pots and pans, and brass utensils. To dress himself and his family costs a well-to-do cultivator from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per annum, while he may spend Rs. 5 or Rs. 10 in brass and silver ornaments. The landless day-labourer is generally attached to the household of his master, and lives in a wretched hut on his employer's land. He gets one full meal at midday and a scanty breakfast and supper.\n\nThe middle classes comprise those who live on land rents, members of the learned professions, merchants and shopkeepers, and persons in Government or private employment. The joint family system which furnishes a common fund for all the members is a relief to those earning small salaries. Their food consists of rice, pulses, vegetables, fish, gh\u016b, oil, milk, sugar, flour, and sweetmeats, and occasionally meat. The ornaments of a married woman of this class are usually not worth more than Rs. 50. One or two bedsteads, a few cane or wooden stools, a few cheap boxes, some coarse mats, together with a number of brass and bell-metal utensils, make up the furniture of an ordinary house, except in the towns, where it may include a table, a couple of chairs, and one or two benches. The cost of living in Calcutta is estimated at Rs. 50 to Rs. 70 a month for an ordinary family, and in the country at from Rs. 30 to Rs. 50.\n\nThere is no doubt that the standard of living has improved of late years in North and East Bengal, where better clothes are worn, earthenware is giving place to brass-ware, and vegetable oils to kerosene. In Bih\u0101r progress is slower, though the improvement in communications has facilitated migration to Bengal, where the remarkable industrial expansion of recent years has created a great demand for labour. The same causes have benefited Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, but here the people are primitive in their habits, and they have not yet taken to growing produce for export on a large scale; the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway has, however, done much to open up this part of the country. The middle classes suffer from high prices, unless they have an interest in land, as many of them have; and this is probably the class which has made least progress.\n\nThe history of the Government forests in Bengal is similar to that of the forests in other parts of India. When the East India Company first began to acquire sovereign rights, its officers were naturally impressed by the great extent of the\nforests, rather than by the benefits to be derived from them; and for many years their sole aim was to expedite their conversion into cultivated fields. Many of the best forests were alienated, and reckless exploitation ran riot. The work of destruction was hastened by the wasteful form of shifting cultivation known as *jh\u00fbm*, the constant occurrence of forest fires, and the direct and indirect demands for railway construction. But with the growing scarcity of valuable timber, and the observed bad effects upon climatic conditions of the wholesale removal of forest growth, a reaction set in; and scientific forest management and conservancy in Bengal dates from the year 1854, when the first Conservator of Forests was appointed. As in other Provinces, rules were then laid down for the control of forest matters, which eventually led up to the passing of the Indian Forest Act, VII of 1878.\n\nUnder this enactment land at the disposal of the state may be divided into 'reserved,' 'protected,' and 'village' and 'unclassed' forests, and powers are also taken for the issue of orders with the object of preventing the destruction of private forests. No such orders have hitherto been issued in Bengal, and there are no 'village' forests. The arrangements for conservancy are most complete in the case of 'reserved' forests. These are permanently demarcated; private rights, where they exist, are defined, commuted, or provided for elsewhere, and every effort is made to prevent damage by fire. Timber is extracted from the greater part of these forests in accordance with scientific working-plans, and the regeneration of suitable species is carefully attended to. In 'protected' forests the arrangements are less elaborate: private rights are recorded but not defined, and the efforts of the Forest department are directed mainly to the prevention of reckless felling and to securing to Government its dues on account of forest produce extracted. As cultivation extends, the area of these 'protected' forests tends to become more and more restricted. There are also, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts*, certain waste lands at the disposal of Government, in which even this modified control is considered inadvisable. The forests on such lands are known as 'unclassed,' and their management is regulated by executive orders.\n\nIn consequence of the permanent revenue settlement, there is very little land at the disposal of Government in the greater part of Bengal proper and Bih\u00e2r, and the forests there have long since yielded to the axe and the plough. Owing to the moisture-laden winds of the southwest monsoon, and the generally low and level surface of the country, which prevents rapid draining and denudation, their disappearance has not been accompanied by the ill effects which have supervened in other less favourable conditions. Except in a few limited areas, vegetation is sufficiently plentiful; and the bamboos, palms, and fruit trees grown by the villagers suffice to meet all their ordinary requirements. For other\npurposes, however, such as sleepers for railways, timber for bridges and large buildings, tea boxes, and to meet the fuel demand in cities, the only important sources of supply, with the exception of the forests in a few Native States and the timber imported from Nep\u0101l or from abroad, are the Government forests which have been \u2018reserved\u2019 or \u2018protected\u2019 in the tracts lying outside the area which was permanently settled: namely, in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, the Sant\u0101l Parganas, the Jalpai-guri Du\u0101rs*, Darjeeling, Chittagong*, Angul, and Puri Districts, the Chittagong Hill Tracts*, and the Sundarbans. The Government forests in these tracts\u00b9 in 1904 covered an area of 9,581 square miles, of which 6,014 square miles were \u2018reserved,\u2019 and 3,567 \u2018protected,\u2019 while there were also 3,753 square miles of \u2018unclassed\u2019 forests in the Chittagong Hill Tracts*. With a few exceptions, the whole of this area is under the control of the Forest department of the Province. At the head is a Conservator of Forests, and under him are deputy, assistant, and extra-assistant Conservators, who are in charge of or attached to Forest \u2018divisions\u2019 (twelve in number), and a subordinate staff of rangers, deputy-rangers, and foresters. In matters of general Forest administration, the divisional officer is the assistant of the Collector of the District, or in some cases of the Commissioner, while as regards technical matters, accounts, establishments, and the like, he is directly under the Conservator.\n\nThe forests of Bengal contain a great number of species, and their composition is very varied in character. The principal types are briefly: (a) The tidal forests situated in the delta of the Ganges, known as the Sundarbans, where the sundri (*Heritiera littoralis*) is the most important species; (b) the dry forests of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and the Sant\u0101l Parganas, where the sal tree (*Shorea robusta*) largely predominates; (c) the forests in the hilly portions of Orissa, where the sal occurs sometimes in pure forests, but usually in conjunction with several species of *Terminalia*, *Diospyros*, *Albizia*, *Dalbergia*, and bamboo; (d) sal forests in the Du\u0101rs* and tarai at the foot of the Eastern Himalayas and on the drier spurs of the lower hills, and those of *Dalbergia Sissoo* and *khair* (*Acacia catechu*) on the gravel and boulder deposits along the rivers of that part of the country; (e) the hill forests of British Sikkim and Bhut\u0101n, stocked chiefly with oaks, magnolias, and rhododendrons; and lastly (f) the Chittagong* forests, of which bamboos, j\u0101rul (*Lagerstroemia Flos Reginae*) and gurjan (*Dipterocarpus turbinatus*) are the most important products.\n\nTimber and other forest produce are, for the most part, now removed\n\n\u00b9 The Jalpaiguri Du\u0101rs, Chittagong, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts have been transferred to Eastern Bengal and Assam. The Government forests in the present area of Bengal cover 7,806 square miles, of which 4,244 square miles are \u2018reserved,\u2019 and 3,562 square miles are \u2018protected.\u2019\nby purchasers, and departmental working is resorted to only for the supply of sal sleepers to railways, and of fuel to the Commissariat department at Darjeeling. Water-carriage is little used save in the forests of Angul, the Sundarbans, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts*, and to some extent in the Jalpaiguri* and Buxa* forests. The practice of shifting cultivation, which is most injurious not only on account of the destruction of forest growth, but also because the fires employed for clearing the felled areas often spread in all directions, is now almost everywhere forbidden, though it is still allowed in the 'unclassed' forests of the Chittagong Hill Tracts* and in the 'protected' forests in the Sant\u0101l Parganas. The most valuable minor products of the forests are bamboos, golp\u0101\u1e6d\u0101 (palm) leaves, mica, honey and wax, thatching grass and sabai grass (*Ischaemum angustifolium*), the last named being largely used in the manufacture of paper.\n\nThe experiment of cultivating rubber (*Ficus elastica*) has been tried in the Darjeeling tarai, the Tista valley, and Chittagong* with some success, but the plantations are still on a very small scale.\n\nMeasures for protecting the forests from fire were commenced in 1872, and have now been extended to all the more valuable areas. At the beginning of the dry season fire-lines, as well as all boundaries and forest roads, are cleared of grass and jungle, and a number of fire-watchers are employed to assist the ordinary protective establishment in patrolling the forests. In many parts, e.g. in the Sundarbans, the forests are not inflammable, and in others, owing to the damp climate, fire-protection is an easy matter. It is in the dry climate of Chot\u0101 Nagpur and Orissa that forest fires are most to be feared, and the greatest care has to be taken; but, in spite of all precautions, large areas in these portions of the Province are frequently burnt. Of the total area of 2,169 square miles in 1903\u20134, over which protection from fire was attempted, 94\u00b798 per cent. was successfully protected at a cost of Rs. 7\u20138\u20137 per square mile.\n\nWith the exception of a small area in Jalpaiguri District*, there are no special fuel and fodder Reserves. In the temporarily settled estates of Orissa, however, lands have been set apart in many villages, during the recent settlement operations, for grazing purposes, while in the Government estates of the Kolh\u0101n and Pal\u0101mau and in some recently settled tracts in Singhbh\u016bm District blocks of waste land have been detached from the 'protected' forest areas and included in the limits of villages, to meet the possible requirements of the villagers in respect of fuel-supply and pasture grounds. In the case of famine or fodder scarcity, the 'reserved' forests in the affected area are thrown open for the free removal of fruits and roots, and in some cases for grazing.\n\nDuring the ten years ending 1890, the forest revenue, expenditure, and surplus averaged, respectively, 6\u00b751, 3\u00b786, and 2\u00b765 lakhs; and for\nthe ten years ending 1900, 9-45, 4-86, and 4-59 lakhs. In 1900 the gross revenue was 12-34 lakhs, the expenditure 5-78 lakhs, and the net surplus 6-56 lakhs; and in 1903-4 the gross revenue\\(^1\\) was 10-47 lakhs, the expenditure 6-89 lakhs, and the net surplus 3-58 lakhs.\n\nCoal is the chief mining industry. The Bengal mines furnish more than 83 per cent. of the total output of coal in India, and nearly the whole of the coke. With the exception of a narrow unworked field of crushed anthracitic coal of Gondwana (upper palaeozoic) age in Darjeeling District near the Nep\u0101l frontier, the coal seams lie mainly in the valleys of two rivers, the Bar\u0101kar and the D\u0101modar. The principal fields at present worked are at Giridih, or Karharb\u0101ri, in the valley of the Bar\u0101kar, and at Jherr\u012ba and R\u0101niganj in the valley of the D\u0101modar. These fields are estimated to be capable of yielding 14,000,000,000 tons of coal, excluding 67,000,000 tons already extracted. They all lie within 200 miles of Calcutta and have been made accessible by rail. The R\u0101jmah\u0101l fields give a small output, and Daltonganj, which has recently been connected by rail with Barun, is being developed. Of the unworked fields, Karanpur\u0101 with nearly 9,000,000,000 tons of coal is perhaps the most important. The Aurang\u0101, Bok\u0101ro, Hutar, and R\u0101mg\u0101rgh fields are also of value, but they have not yet been opened out by the construction of railways. These fields contain fair steam coals; some are very good, but they all contain a rather high percentage of ash. Many of them yield a good firm coke suitable for furnaces.\n\nThe maximum thickness of the seams is 95 feet, and the portions worked vary in thickness from \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 45 feet. As a rule, a quarry is commenced at the outcrop; and as it pays to remove a large overburden from thick seams, a number of huge open excavations are formed. When the cover overlying a seam is too thick to be economically removed, or when the seam is thin, galleries from 8 to 12 feet wide are driven, both on the dip and along the strike of the seam, leaving pillars of coal the size of which varies according to the method of working and the thickness of the seams cover. A system which provides for 12 feet galleries and 12 feet pillars yields at once three-quarters of the coal; but the remaining quarter, which is left in pillars, can seldom be won. A system allowing 12 feet galleries and 60 feet pillars yields 30 per cent. of coal in the first working, and 70 per cent. is left in pillars; but unless the seam be more than 20 feet thick, a large proportion of the latter can be obtained in the second, or pillar, working. Pillar working is mainly confined to European-managed mines, as there is always danger of a fire breaking out in large areas of pillars. In driving galleries it is usual to start from the top of the seam with\n\n\\(^1\\) The corresponding figures for Bengal as now constituted are: receipts, 8-6 lakhs; expenditure, 5-45 lakhs; and net surplus, 3-15 lakhs.\na height of 6 feet, and, after this drive has advanced some distance, to deepen it to the full height of the seam by cutting out the remainder of the coal in successive steps. In a few mines the galleries are commenced in the lower portion of the seam, and are heightened by dropping the coal left above. In the East Indian Railway collieries in the Giridih coal-field the coal is extracted by a combination of the pillar and long wall methods. The lower portion of the seam is cut up into pillars 6 feet in height, and the latter are thinned down till they are only just able to carry the weight of the overlying coal. These thinned pillars are then blown down by dynamite, and the top coal (17 feet thick), which comes away readily from a strong sandstone roof, falls on the floor. When a large area of coal has been extracted, a rib of coal is left against the worked-out portion, or goaf, and a new set of workings is started.\n\nThe methods of raising the coal to the surface vary from the primitive means of baskets carried on the heads of cooly women to hauling sets of 5 or 10 tubs on inclines provided with rails, or hoisting in well-fitted shafts up to 640 feet in depth by direct-acting engines. All three methods are in vogue in the chief coal-fields. The coal is cut with picks of English pattern and make by natives of many castes, including the aboriginal Santals, Mundas, and Oraons, and the semi-Hinduized Musahars, Bauris, Bagdis, Ghautwals, Mahlis, Turis, Chamars, Telis, and Pasis. The majority are recruited from the villages surrounding the coal-fields, and from the adjoining parts of Bankura, Manbhum, Birbhum, and the Santal Parganas.\n\nThe underground work is performed at a fixed price per tub of coal by families, or gangs of men, women, and children, who choose their own hours of labour. The men cut the coal, and the women and children carry it to the tubs. As a rule, they also push the tubs to the shaft or incline, but at one colliery 110 horses and ponies are employed to 'lead' the coal underground. A man can cut about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ tubs ($1\\frac{1}{4}$ tons) of coal per day of eight hours; but he seldom works more than five days in the week, and strictly observes all high-days and holidays. The number of working days per year varies from 200 to 300. The total value of coal at the pit's mouth in 1901 was 1.54 lakhs; and as there were 79,652 persons employed, the value of each person's out-turn for the year was Rs. 191. Of this sum, the colliery owner's profit, the landowner's rent or royalty, the cost of stores, tools and equipment, and the superior establishment take about Rs. 98, leaving about Rs. 93 a year as the earnings of each person, or about Rs. 15\u20138 a month per family.\n\nIn 1774 Mr. S. G. Heatly (the reputed discoverer of Bengal coal) and Mr. J. Summer applied to Government for the right of working coal at Raniganj. In 1777 six mines were worked and 90 tons of coal were\nobtained. Nothing further was done till about 1815, when a Mr. Jones mined coal from pits and was the first to sell it in the general market. The industry progressed slowly till 1840, when the imports to Calcutta from R\u0101n\u012bganj reached 36,200 tons. From 1840 to 1845 there was a constant increase in output, which in 1845 amounted to 62,400 tons. The East Indian Railway tapped the fields in 1854, and in 1858 the out-turn had increased to 220,000 tons. In 1903 the out-turn exceeded 3,000,000 tons, obtained from 142 mines employing 34,000 persons daily. The R\u0101n\u012bganj field contains two valuable coal series, which are separated by ironstone shales 1,000 feet thick. The Giridih field was worked from 1857 to 1861, when it was closed for a time; it was reopened and worked systematically in 1871, and in 1903 its yield was 767,000 tons, from nine mines employing 10,700 persons. It possesses two valuable seams in the lower coal series, and one of the shafts has a depth of 640 feet. Jherri\u0101 was opened in 1894, but its output in 1903 had already risen to 2,746,000 tons, from 115 mines employing 28,000 persons. As at R\u0101n\u012bganj, two coal series exist, the lower one containing eighteen, and the upper one two, valuable seams. Of these seams, twelve are being worked. The East Indian Railway Company at Giridih, and the Bengal Coal Company in the Daltonganj, Giridih, and R\u0101n\u012bganj coal-fields, each raise more than 600,000 tons yearly; and the output of the Equitable, New Birbh\u016bm, and the Bar\u0101kar Coal Companies exceeds 300,000 tons each. The European-owned collieries raise between them more than 4,000,000 tons, and those owned by natives have an output exceeding 1\u00bd million tons. The capital invested in joint-stock companies is about 115 lakhs, and there is also a large but unknown investment by private owners. The total output of the Province in 1881 was 930,000 tons. In 1891 it had risen to 1,747,000, in 1901 to 5,704,000, and in 1903 to 6,566,000 tons.\n\nThe railways consume one-third of the total output. The imports of foreign coal into Calcutta, the only important distributing port, which were 70,000 tons in 1880, had dwindled to 2,000 tons in 1901. The exports to foreign ports amounted to 8 tons in 1880, 26,000 tons in 1890, a quarter of a million tons in 1897, and more than half a million in 1901. In Bombay English coal still competes with Indian, for although the latter can be bought in Calcutta for Rs. 7 per ton, the steamer freight and other charges raise its price to Rs. 15 at Bombay, which is only Rs. 2 less than the cost of English coal of better quality. Indian coal reaches Suez on the west and Singapore on the east; at the latter port it competes with the supply from the Japanese mines.\n\nAbout 1,700 persons are employed in iron-mining, and practically all the mineral won is dispatched to the works at Bar\u0101kar, near Asansol, where pig-iron, pipes, and various kinds of castings are turned out. The ore is found in thin alluvial deposits at a number of places, as\nmasses of hematite and magnetite in metamorphic rocks at K\u0101lim\u0101ti and in the ironstone shales of the R\u0101niganj coal-field. The alluvial deposits were at one time worked by natives. The K\u0101lim\u0101ti quarries are shallow, and were opened in 1901, when they produced 7,800 tons of ore, rising in the following year to 10,382 tons. The R\u0101niganj ore is in the form of carbonate below ground, but it readily weathers, and at the surface consists of hematite and limonite. The beds vary from 2 to 8 inches in thickness and form one-seventeenth of the whole series, which is 1,000 feet thick. About 50,000 tons of ore were won in 1901 from shallow trenches and pits. The output of the Province rose from 20,000 tons in 1891 to 58,000 tons in 1901 and to 72,000 tons in 1902. The success of the industry depends in a great measure on the coking qualities of the Bengal coal. Attempts at steel-making have proved unremunerative.\n\n**Details of Output and Labour for Each Coal-field in 1903**\n\n| Particulars                  | Total | Giridih | Jherri\u0101 | R\u0101niganj | Daltonanj (Palamau) | R\u0101jmahal |\n|------------------------------|-------|---------|---------|----------|---------------------|----------|\n| Number of mines              | 27    | 9       | 115     | 142      | 2                   | 4        |\n| Output in thousands of tons  | 6,566 | 767     | 2,745   | 3,020    | 34                  |          |\n| Average number of persons employed daily | 73,928 | 10,691  | 28,114  | 33,854   | 1,235               | 34       |\n| Underground                  | 49,274 | 7,739   | 17,789  | 22,913   | 823                 | 10       |\n| Men                          | 33,372 | 5,436   | 10,622  | 16,611   | 697                 | 6        |\n| Women                        | 14,744 | 2,213   | 6,510   | 5,892    | 125                 | 4        |\n| Children (under twelve)      | 1,158  | 90      | 657     | 410      | 1                   |          |\n| Aboveground                  | 24,654 | 2,952   | 10,325  | 10,941   | 412                 | 24       |\n| Men                          | 15,113 | 2,155   | 6,109   | 6,570    | 262                 | 17       |\n| Women                        | 8,231  | 618     | 3,557   | 3,916    | 133                 | 7        |\n| Children (under twelve)      | 1,310  | 179     | 659     | 455      | 17                  |          |\n\nMica is found over a large area in Gay\u0101, Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, and Monghyr Districts. It occurs in dikes and masses of pegmatite, as more or less defined shoots and patches which, in many cases, are found at the surface during the rains and are worked in the cold and hot seasons. In 1903 there were 251 mines and quarries, employing about 6,500 labourers daily. With the exception of Bendi, all the quarries and mines are worked by primitive native methods. Haulage and pumping are done by women, who are seated on ladders and pass up, from hand to hand to the surface, earthen pots filled with water or baskets with\nmica. The output in 1901 was 914 tons, valued at 4\u00bd lakhs, or seven times the quantity obtained ten years previously. Of this amount, 628 tons were obtained by a European firm, which owns a large area of land outside the Kodarm\u0101 Government forests, where most of the other mines are situated. In 1903 the output had fallen to 692 tons.\n\nRecent gold-bearing sands are widely distributed, and yield poor wages to a few Jhor\u0101s working with wooden dishes. Numerous veins of vitreous white quartz and grey quartzites occur in Singhbhum District, and in 1895 several small shafts were sunk. Assays give results varying from 1 to 7 dwts. per ton. A small amount of prospecting work was done in 1901. Copper pyrites are found at B\u0101raganda, in a band of mica and talcose schists varying from 12 to 40 feet in thickness. The only mine hitherto worked was closed in 1891. The rock contains 3 per cent. of copper, which was increased by concentration to 12 per cent., and the concentrates were carted to Giridih and smelted. In all, 1,100 tons of copper were obtained. At R\u0101jdoha also copper has been worked in small quantities. Alluvial tin is reported from Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, but it has not yet been found in paying quantities.\n\nThe saltpetre of Indian commerce is obtained mainly from the Patna Division and Monghyr. It occurs as a natural efflorescence on the surface of the ground, and its manufacture affords employment to a large number of people belonging to the caste (Nuni\u0101) named after it. The quantity produced in 1900 is estimated at 160,000 cwt., valued at 12 lakhs, or rather less than the out-turn in 1891. In 1903 the out-turn was 382,000 cwt., of a total value of 22\u00b733 lakhs.\n\nSlate has been quarried in Monghyr for many years, and is now mined. The industry gives employment to nearly 400 persons, and 1,600 tons were produced in 1903. There are two beds of slate on edge, 13 and 9 feet thick respectively. Owing to 'creep' in the hill-side, quarrying has been given up and underground chambers are now cut, from 15 to 25 feet in height, leaving a minimum cover of 30 feet. The slates are thicker than Welsh slates, but are strong and suitable for the flat roofs of Indian bungalows. The castes employed are chiefly Koras, Musahars, Beld\u0101rs, Gonrs, Nuni\u0101s, Cham\u0101rs, and Go\u0101las.\n\nLimestone is widely distributed in the nodular form known as kankar, except in the deltaic tract east of the Bh\u0101girathi. In 1900 the out-turn was 100,000 tons, valued at three-quarters of a lakh. Sandstone, suitable for building and road-making, is found in the coal-fields. An output of 40,000 tons, valued at a quarter of a lakh, was reported in 1900. Laterite is found in Bih\u0101r and Orissa; 100,000 tons, valued at half a lakh, were raised in 1900. Granite and other igneous rocks are used in Gay\u0101 and Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh for road-metal. Soapstone occurs in M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and is made into cups and images, but the industry is small.\nThroughout the Province various handicrafts are carried on, but, as a rule, the articles manufactured suffice only to meet the local demand. **Dacca** and **S\u0101ntipur** were formerly famous for their fine muslins; and early in the nineteenth century the quantity exported to Europe, and especially to France, was very great. From Dacca* alone the exports in 1817 were valued at 152 lakhs. Ordinary cotton goods were also in great demand for the European market, and as early as 1706 efforts were made to induce weavers to settle in the neighbourhood of Calcutta. The introduction of machinery in Europe has not only killed the export trade, but has flooded the country with cheap piece-goods and seriously crippled the local weaving industry. Country-made goods, however, are more durable, and, in the more remote parts, country weavers have maintained their business. The weavers of **Serampore**, who use an improved loom, still hold their own, and so do those of Dacca*, where a carefully bleached white cloth with a border of gold thread is made; while in Patna District the trade in cotton goods and cheap muslins made at Dinapore is still fairly brisk. Cotton-spinning, except as a domestic industry, no longer exists, and the weavers generally work with imported yarn or cotton twist.\n\nJute is worked up into cloth for gunny-bags, sails, and quilts, mainly in Hooghly and Dacca*, but smaller quantities are manufactured in most parts of Bengal proper. This work is the speciality of the Kap\u0101li caste. The yarn is prepared by the men, and the women weave the cloth. Jute is also twisted into twine from which ropes are afterwards made.\n\nThe silkworm is reared in West Bengal and in the tract where the Presidency and R\u0101jsh\u0101hi* Divisions meet. The industry was threatened with extinction, owing to diseases among the worms; but the subject has been investigated by Government agency, and remedies have been applied with a fair measure of success. Silk-reeling is carried on in both European and native filatures, and raw silk is largely exported, the value of the exports amounting in 1903\u20134 to 47 lakhs. Silk thread is twisted from the reeled silk by women, and is knotted and uneven. The cloth woven is thus of a rough quality, but in spite of this silk-weaving was once a flourishing industry. Of late years it has suffered greatly from the competition of silks made in Japan, China, and Italy, and the value of manufactured silk exported in 1903\u20134 was estimated at only 6 lakhs compared with 18 lakhs in 1881. The weaving of mulberry silk, which is made chiefly for export, is carried on in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d and several Districts of West Bengal. That of *tasar* silk, which is in demand among natives, who wear it when performing religious ceremonies, has its head-quarters in West Bengal, M\u0101nbh\u016bm, and Gay\u0101; the business is still fairly prosperous, but, as the worm\nis not cultivated and the cocoons are collected in the jungle, the supply is very fluctuating. In East Bengal muga silk from Assam is woven, and in North Bengal a rough cloth is made by the Mech women from the silk of the eri worm. A mixed cloth, the warp of which is tasar silk and the woof cotton, is woven at Dacca*, Bhagalpur, and Bankura.\n\nLocally made cloths and English cloths of similar texture are embroidered in coloured silks and cottons at Santipur by the women of the weaving class, but the arrangement of colours is not very pleasing. Embroidered caps are made at the town of Bihar. Skilled embroiderers in gold and silver are found at Patna and Murshidabad, but their work is chiefly confined to caps and to the trappings of horses and elephants. In Calcutta and the neighbourhood, the fancy work known as chikan is a thriving industry, and there is a considerable demand for it in Europe.\n\nCotton carpets are made at Nisbetganj in Rangpur* and at a few places in Bihar. The weaving of woollen goods is carried on only in Bihar and in part of Murshidabad District; but the industry is almost entirely confined to the manufacture of blankets, which are made for the most part by the shepherds themselves. The cloth is woven in narrow strips which are afterwards stitched together. Woollen carpets of good texture are made at Obra in Gay\u0101 District.\n\nThe filigree gold- and silver-work of Cuttack and Dacca* is well-known. The silver-work of Kharakpur in Monghyr is famous, and there are also skilled workers in Calcutta. Blacksmiths and workers in iron are found everywhere, but most of them are employed in the manufacture and repair of agricultural implements and other articles of general use. In Patna, Calcutta, and Kishanganj (Purnea), iron cages, platters, spoons, chains, bolts, &c., are made. A few cutlers work in the suburbs of Calcutta, at Kanchannagar near Burdwan, and at one or two other places. Padlocks and keys are manufactured on a small scale at Natagarh and elsewhere. Monghyr was famous for its iron-workers before the days of foreign competition, and it still holds a relatively high position. Its speciality is the making of shot-guns; but during the last few years the business has declined, and in 1901 only 463 guns were manufactured, or less than one-sixth of the out-turn four years previously. The number of fire-arms exported in 1903-4 was 899. This is attributed by the dealers in arms partly to the effect of foreign competition, and partly to the reduced number of gun licences issued in recent years. The manufacture of brass and copper utensils is the one indigenous industry which has not suffered from foreign competition. Figures, supports for hukkas, hinges, and the like are sometimes moulded; but the chief articles manufactured are domestic utensils, vessels of brass being used by Hindus and of copper\nby Muhammadans. They are made either by casting and moulding, or by joining together pieces of beaten-out metal, which at the present day is usually imported in sheets from Europe. The methods employed are of the simplest, and practically no machinery is used.\n\nThe manufacture of earthen vessels is carried on everywhere in Bengal, but the best ware is made in Burdw\u0101n District, on the banks of the Bh\u0101girathi, where the clay is especially suitable for the manufacture of durable pottery. Black earthen jars are exported in large quantities from the S\u0101tkhira subdivision of Khuln\u0101, and are used for storing oil and grain. In Monghyr porous water vessels are made, and decorated pottery of graceful form is produced at Sasar\u0101m. Ornamental pottery is also made at Siw\u0101n in S\u0101ran, which is remarkable both for its shape and decoration. The vessels are baked in earthen jars to prevent contact with the flames; they thus become black when baked, and are then glazed with a mixture of clay and fuller's earth. Owing partly to the absence of suitable clay, and partly to the fact that Hindus think it necessary to change their earthen vessels constantly, nothing has yet been done in Bengal towards the production of porcelain or white earthenware. Glazes also are rarely resorted to. Occasionally vessels are smeared, before burning, with a mixture of fine clay, but the art of fusing glazes is not understood. Clay figures of some merit are moulded at Krishnagar, and idols with no pretensions to artistic skill are made everywhere.\n\nStone-carving, as an art, is practised only in Gay\u0101, where small statues of gods and figures of animals are made of granite; the carving of stone for the decoration of temples and buildings has almost entirely died out in Bengal. Glass-ware is made, chiefly in Patna, from Son river sand mixed with carbonate of soda. The glass is green and clouded, but at Patna a fair amount of white glass is now made. Bottles for holding perfumery, lamps for illuminations, and glass bangles are the chief articles produced. Bracelets of coarse glass are also made at Bh\u0101galpur.\n\nThe ordinary carpenter of Bengal is a very rough workman, and is capable of little beyond the making of ploughs and other simple articles in common use among the people. In North and East Bengal, Orissa, and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, the number even of such carpenters is deficient. Carving in wood was formerly practised as an adjunct to architecture, and there are traces of the skill of former workmen in the carved balconies of Patna, Gay\u0101, and Muzaffarpur. This sort of work has almost entirely died out; and the only indigenous wood-carving deserving of mention at the present time is that of the ebony workers of Monghyr, who make pieces of furniture, boxes and other small articles, which are inlaid with patterns in horn and ivory. In some parts, especially in the Patna Division, carpenters have been taught by Europeans to make\narticles of furniture from European models, and they often acquire great accuracy and finish. In Calcutta there are now numerous cabinet-makers who learnt their art in the English shops. In Muzaffarpur hukka stems are turned, and over 200,000 are exported yearly; p\u0101lkis and cart-wheels are also manufactured on a large scale.\n\nConch-shell bracelets are made chiefly in Dacca*. They are sawn out by a large metal disk, and are then polished and coloured. Bengal has always been famous for its ivory-carving, the peculiar feature of which is the minuteness of the work, which requires about eighty different tools. The number of persons now employed is, however, very small, and consists only of a few families in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, Rangpur*, and Cuttack. Metal inlaying is practised in a few places, the best known being the so-called bidri work of Purnea and Murshid\u0101b\u0101d, which was introduced from the Deccan, and consists of inlaying with silver a sort of pewter, which is made black with sulphate of copper.\n\nMat-making is largely carried on in South Midnapore, whence comes the cyperus matting sold in Calcutta, and mats of fine reeds are woven in various parts of East Bengal. Bamboo mats and baskets are made everywhere, and fancy baskets of coloured grasses in Bih\u0101r. The indigenous Cham\u0101r, or leather-dresser and cobbler, is found all over the Province; but his work is very rough and is confined to meeting the simple requirements of ordinary village life\u2014the supply of leather straps for plough yokes, rough shoes, and the like. In Calcutta a number of shoemakers working in the European style are found, comprising both Chinamen and natives of the country. Leathern harness is made on a small scale in Calcutta and Patna.\n\nThe extended use of jute, as a fibre, dates from 1832, when experiments made in Dundee showed that it could be used as a substitute for hemp; and a further impetus was given to the demand when the difficulties which once existed in bleaching and dyeing it were overcome. It is used not only for the making of gunny-bags and coarse cloth, but also in the manufacture of carpets, curtains, and shirtings, and is largely mixed with silk or used for imitating silk fabrics. The rapid spread of jute cultivation during recent years has already been described. The whole of the raw material, except such as was required for the hand-looms of the villages, was formerly exported to Europe, mainly to Dundee; but of late a flourishing local industry has been established, and the banks of the Hooghly are now lined with jute-mills, which are rapidly growing in number and importance. In 1903-4 there were 36 mills with 18,000 looms, employing 122,724 hands, compared with 25 mills with 9,000 looms and 66,000 hands in 1892-3. Nearly half the raw jute produced in Bengal is now consumed in these mills; the value of gunny-bags, rope, and other goods exported in 1901-2 was 859 lakhs, against only 100 lakhs twenty years previously; and the\nexport had further increased by 1903-4 to 936 lakhs. Jute presses are also increasing rapidly in number; in 1903 there were 155, compared with 37 in 1892 and only 4 in 1882.\n\nThe great centre of the Indian cotton-manufacturing industry is in Bombay, but it is steadily growing in importance in Bengal, and there are now ten mills employing about 11,000 hands, compared with an average of six mills employing 6,000 hands in the decade 1881-90. In 1903-4 the out-turn of yarn exceeded 46,000,000 lb. and that of cloth was nearly 700,000 lb. The capital invested has risen from 83 to 177 lakhs.\n\nThe principal statistics in connexion with the jute and cotton industries are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year   | Number of Mills | Number of Looms | Number of Spindles in Thousands | Average Daily Number of Persons Employed |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Jute-mills: |                |                 |                                 |                                         |\n| 1880-1 | 19              | 4,893           | 66                              | 33,994                                  |\n| 1890-1 | 25              | 8,066           | 162                             | 61,503                                  |\n| 1900-1 | 34              | 15,169          | 314                             | 110,951                                 |\n| 1903-4 | 36              | 18,234          | 373                             | 122,724                                 |\n| Cotton-mills: |            |                 |                                 |                                         |\n| 1880-1 | 6               | 126             | 167                             | 4,166                                   |\n| 1890-1 | 8               | ...             | 297                             | 8,790                                   |\n| 1896-7 | 9               | 200             | 348                             | 10,900                                  |\n| 1900-1 | 10              | 209             | 411                             | 8,930                                   |\n| 1903-4 | 10              | 213             | 451                             | 10,230                                  |\n\nThere were in 1903 four paper-mills with a capital of 50 lakhs, employing on the average nearly 900 hands each, and producing nearly 36,000,000 lb. of paper. The capital invested and the production have quadrupled since 1881-90. Other large industries are also growing apace, such as iron and brass foundries, oil-mills, silk, soap, and lac factories, potteries, rope works, &c.; and for miles above Calcutta the banks of the Hooghly present a scene of industrial activity which bids fair in time to rival that of the largest towns in Europe. The principal statistics of these undertakings are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year   | Number in Iron and Brass Foundries | Oil-mills | Lac Factories | Potteries | Rice-mills | Rope-works | Silk Factories | Silk Mills | Soap Factories |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|------------|---------------|\n| 1881   | 4                                 | ...       | 1             | 1         | 3          | 2          | 20             | 4*         | 1             |\n| 1891   | 15                                | 32        | 39            | 1         | 2          | 5          | 80             | 2*         | ...           |\n| 1901   | 25                                | 47        | 16            | 2         | 1          | 7          | 71             | 10         | 1             |\n| 1903   | 38                                | 63        | 48            | 1         | 1          | 7          | 62             | 8          | 1             |\n\n* These figures include some weaving establishments, the number of which was not reported.\nThese industries are at present worked chiefly under European supervision and supported by European capital. It may be hoped that in time the natives of the country will follow the lead thus given them.\n\nIt is said that the supply of labour for these large industries has not kept pace with the rapidly growing demand, but in spite of this the number returned as employed in 1902 aggregated 253,000, compared with 247,000 ten years earlier. The real increase is much greater, as many industries employing less than twenty-five persons have been left out of account in recent years; and if allowance be made for these, the total number of labourers employed in 1902 may be estimated at 275,000. The returns for 1903 show altogether 261,656 persons employed. These labourers come chiefly from Bih\u0101r and the United Provinces and, to a less extent, from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. The wages offered by the mills are nearly double those obtained by unskilled labourers in the tracts whence they chiefly come; and, although the cost of living is also higher, there is no doubt that the rapid expansion of this field of employment is a great boon to the poorer classes. Their main object is to save as much money as they can for the support of their families at home or as a provision for their old age. In the meantime, they live huddled together in crowded lodging-houses as close as possible to the mills and factories where they work; but in other respects they fare far better than they would do in their own country, and their dietary is much more liberal and of a far better quality than that to which they are accustomed at home.\n\nBritish trade with Bengal commenced about 1633; but prior to the acquisition of the Province it was on a very small scale, and in 1759 only thirty vessels with an aggregate burden of less than 4,000 tons sailed from Calcutta. The chief exports were opium from Bih\u0101r and Rangpur*, silk manufactured goods and raw silk from Murshid\u0101b\u0101d and R\u0101jsh\u0101hi*, muslins from Dacca*, indigo and saltpetre from Bih\u0101r, and cotton cloths from Patna. Little except bullion was imported. The 150 years of British rule have witnessed a commercial revolution. Hand-woven silks and cottons are no longer exported, and machine-made European piece-goods have taken the first place among the imports. On the other hand, owing to the increased facilities for the transport of goods, the food-crops have been largely displaced by fibres and oilseeds, which now figure largely among the exports. The principal imports are yarns and textile fabrics, metals and machinery, oil, and sugar; and the principal exports are raw and manufactured jute, coal, tea, opium, hides, rice, linseed, indigo, and lac. Bengal enjoys a practical monopoly of the export of coal, raw and manufactured jute, lac, saltpetre, and raw silk, and has a large or preponderating share in that of opium, indigo, rice, hides, and tea.\nThe maritime trade of the Province is concentrated in Calcutta. Chittagong*, the terminus of the Assam-Bengal Railway, exports jute, rice, and tea, and imports salt and oil; but its total trade is still comparatively small. The Orissa ports do an insignificant rice trade. The head-quarters of the jute trade are N\u0101r\u0101yanganj*, Sirajganj*, Chandpur*, and Madaripur* in East Bengal, and Jalpaiguri* in North Bengal; the jute-mills line both banks of the Hooghly river from 10 miles below to 30 miles above Calcutta. Patna is still a market for grain, but the East Indian Railway has robbed it of much of its importance. R\u0101niganj, Asansol, G\u012brid\u012bh, Jherri\u0101, and Bar\u0101kar are the centres of the coal trade. Calcutta, with its suburbs of Howrah, Garden Reach, and Chitpur, is the centre of the commercial and industrial activities of the Province.\n\nThe Bengal Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1834, and represents all the large commercial interests of Calcutta. The Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and the Calcutta Trades Association have been formed to protect the interests of native merchants and of the retail trading community. The affairs of the Calcutta and Chittagong ports are administered by Port Trusts.\n\nBroadly stated, the imports into Calcutta represent the convergence of the products of the country to the chief seaport for shipment overseas, and the exports from Calcutta the distribution inland of foreign imports; the principal articles of export and import are thus the same as have already been enumerated for the Province as a whole.\n\nThe registration of internal trade is defective, except for Calcutta, and complete returns exist only for rail-borne traffic. The Province is divided for registration purposes into eight blocks. The articles most largely exported from the Eastern block are jute, grain and pulses, timber, kerosene oil, and fodder; from the Northern block jute, grain and pulses, tobacco, and tea; from the Dacca* block jute; and from Bih\u0101r grain, pulses, oilseeds, stone, and lime. All the blocks obtain their piece-goods from Calcutta. Calcutta receives rice from East and West Bengal; coal from West Bengal and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; jute from Dacca* and East and North Bengal; timber from East Bengal; grain and pulses from West, East, and North Bengal, Dacca*, and Bih\u0101r; and oilseeds, opium, and indigo from Bih\u0101r. West Bengal imports salt, oilcake, wrought iron and steel, and sugar from Calcutta; coal and timber from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; and grain, stone, lime, and oilseeds from Bih\u0101r. East Bengal draws its supplies of salt and railway material from Calcutta; coal from West Bengal and from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur; and jute and rice from North Bengal. Bih\u0101r imports coal and timber from Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur.\n\nThe railways, rivers, canals, and roads carry country produce to the ports for export, and distribute the imports: the main routes of traffic will be described under the head of Communications. Calcutta,\nthe chief receiving and distributing centre, is connected with all parts of the Province by the railways, which carry the bulk of the internal trade. Next in importance as a channel of communication are the Calcutta and Eastern Canals, which carry enormous quantities of rice and jute from the eastern Districts into Calcutta.\n\nJute is either exported from Calcutta or manufactured in the mills on the Hooghly. In the former case it is pressed into bales to reduce the freight. One-third of the jute pressed at N\u0101r\u0101yanganj* finds its way to Chittagong* by the Assam-Bengal Railway, and is thence shipped direct. The presses and the mills obtain their jute from the cultivator through native brokers, and the trade in Calcutta is largely in the hands of European brokers. Tea grown in North Bengal is taken to Calcutta by rail, but most of that produced in Assam is carried thither by steamer, and shipped thence to London either by the producers, or by brokers who purchase it at auction. Considerable and increasing quantities of Assam tea are, however, now sent by the Assam-Bengal Railway to Chittagong*, and are shipped thence direct to England. Coal is carried by rail from the mines to Calcutta, whence it is shipped to Bombay and other coast ports. Opium intended for export is also brought to Calcutta, where it is sold at auction by the Board of Revenue. Imported foreign goods are bought by native merchants, through European brokers, from the consignees, and distributed up-country.\n\nOnly 8 per 1,000 of the population are engaged in commerce. A great part of the trade is in the hands of enterprising merchants from M\u0101rw\u0101r, chiefly Agarw\u0101ls and Osw\u0101ls; the indigenous dealers belong in Bengal to the Sunri, K\u0101yasth, Teli, Subarnabanik, and Br\u0101hman castes, and in Bih\u0101r to the Rauni\u0101r and Kalw\u0101r castes. The M\u0101rw\u0101ris are bankers and money-lenders, and dealers in piece-goods and country produce; of the other castes mentioned, the Br\u0101hmans and K\u0101yasths are engaged as brokers, money-lenders, and bankers, while the others are for the most part petty shopkeepers.\n\nStatistics of the value (i) of the trade with other Provinces and States in India, (ii) of the foreign maritime trade, and (iii) of the foreign land trade are given in Tables V\u2013VII on pp. 348\u201350. Of the trade by sea with other Provinces the largest share, both in imports and exports, is with Burma, which sends rice, timber, and kerosene oil to Bengal, and receives from it coal, tobacco, gunny-bags, and betel-nuts. Next comes the Bombay Presidency, which supplies Bengal with cotton goods and salt, in exchange for coal, rice, gunny-bags and cloth, and tea. The trade by land with Provinces other than those named is carried by rail and river, and much of it is due to the position of Calcutta as a seaport and medium of trade with other countries. The largest share of this trade is with the United Provinces, whence are received opium,\noilseeds, grain and pulses, hides and skins, and wool manufactures, and to which are sent cotton piece-goods, gunny-bags and cloth, metals, and sugar. From Assam, Calcutta receives tea, oilseeds, grain and pulses, and stone and lime, and sends in return cotton piece-goods, metals and manufactures of metals, oils (mostly rape and mustard), and salt. Excluding the trade with Calcutta, the imports of Bengal consist mainly of the staple products of the United Provinces, Assam, and the Central Provinces, and the exports consist mainly of grain and pulses, coal, jute, gunny-bags and cloth, spices, and sugar.\n\nOf the foreign trade by far the largest part is with countries in Europe; and of this the greatest share is with the United Kingdom, from which two-thirds of the imports come. Kerosene oil is imported from Russia, sugar and piece-goods from Germany, wrought iron and steel from Belgium, and sugar from Austria-Hungary and from the Straits. The United Kingdom takes one-third of the total exports, and Germany as much as all the other countries combined.\n\nThe foreign land trade is insignificant except with Nep\u00e1l, which absorbs about 92 per cent. of the total. Tibet still presents a practically closed door to the Indian trader, and with Sikkim and Bhutan the trade is trifling. About half of the imports consists of grain and pulses (largely rice); the exports are cotton yarn and piece-goods (European and Indian), metals, provisions, and salt.\n\nThe total length\\(^1\\) of the railways in the Province in 1904 was 4,578.4 miles, of which the state owned 3,894.8 miles, 971.3 being worked by the state and 2,923.5 by companies, while 616.7 miles belonged to assisted companies, 33.3 miles to an unassisted company, and 33.6 to Native States; no lines are owned by guaranteed companies. Of the total length, 2,932.6 miles belonged to inter-Provincial railways; these are the East Indian, Bengal-Nagpur, Assam-Bengal, and Bengal and North-Western Railways.\n\nThe East Indian Railway, a broad-gauge line owned by the state, the length of which in Bengal is 1,211.6 miles, connects Bengal with the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the same year the railways in Bengal as now constituted had a length of 3,484.9 miles, of which 3,040.5 miles were owned by the state, 377.5 miles by assisted companies, 33.3 miles by an unassisted company, and 33.6 miles by Native States. Of the state-owned railways, 2,808.8 miles were worked by companies, and 231.7 by the state. Of the total length, 3,049.6 miles belonged to inter-Provincial railways: namely, the East Indian, Bengal-Nagpur, Bengal and North-Western, and Eastern Bengal State Railways.\n\nAs a result of the partition the following railways now lie entirely outside the Province: the Assam-Bengal (193.9 miles), Bengal-Duars (152.3), Mymensingh-Jamalpur-Jagannathganj (51.4), and Noakhali (34.9) Railways. The Eastern Bengal State Railway now lies partly outside Bengal, 231.6 miles being included in the Province and 739.6 miles in Eastern Bengal and Assam. The length of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway within Bengal has at the same time been increased by 79.2 miles.\nUnited Provinces, and for many years was the only connexion between Calcutta and Bombay. It enters Bengal on crossing the Karamn\u0101s\u0101 river a little west of Buxar, and has its terminus on the west bank of the Hooghly at Howrah, which is connected with Calcutta by a pontoon bridge. There is also a short link-line which connects the East Indian Railway at Hooghly with the Eastern Bengal State Railway at Naih\u0101ti.\n\nThe earliest alignment of the East Indian Railway ran due north from Howrah to S\u0101hibganj, where it struck the Ganges, and then swung westwards along the south bank of that river. This is now known as the loop-line, and has been replaced for through traffic by a chord-line from Luckeesarai to Kh\u0101na junction. Another chord-line from Mughal Sarai via Gay\u0101 and Katrasgarh to Sit\u0101r\u0101mpur was opened in 1907.\n\nThe East Indian Railway is the main carrier between Bengal and the United Provinces, and it taps the coal-fields in the neighbourhood of R\u0101niganj. This railway is worked by a company, which also works the South Bih\u0101r and T\u0101r\u0101keswar Railways, two small broad-gauge lines owned by assisted companies.\n\nThe Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway is owned by the state, but is worked by a company of that name. It is a broad-gauge line with a length of 855\u00b74 miles within Bengal, and a terminus at Howrah; it forms a connecting link between Bengal and Madras, and provides an alternative and shorter route to Bombay. The bifurcation of the lines to Madras and Bombay takes place at Kharakpur, 70 miles west of Calcutta, whence the Madras line runs south through Orissa, while the Bombay line passes west through Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur to the Central Provinces. This line taps the Jherri\u0101 coal-field, and competes with the East Indian Railway as a coal-carrier to Calcutta.\n\nThe Assam-Bengal Railway is also a state line worked by a company. It is a metre-gauge line with a length of 193\u00b79 miles within Bengal. The terminus is at Chittagong* and the main line runs north-east to Assam. From L\u0101ksh\u0101m* a branch runs west to Ch\u0101ndpur* on the Meghn\u0101, whence communication with Calcutta is established by steamer to Goalundo*; and another branch from L\u0101ksh\u0101m* to No\u0101kh\u0101l\u012b* has also been opened by the company, to whom land was given free of charge. This line competes with the river steamers in carrying tea from Assam, and it also brings N\u0101r\u0101yanganj* jute from Ch\u0101ndpur* to Chittagong* for shipment.\n\nThe Bengal and North-Western Railway, a metre-gauge line, connecting North Bengal and Bih\u0101r with the United Provinces, belongs to an assisted company, which also works the Tirhut State Railway, and has a length in this Province of 671\u00b77 miles, including 535 miles of the Tirhut State Railway. The metre-gauge line from Sagauli to Raxaul, 18 miles in length, was purchased from a company and incorporated with the Tirhut State Railway. It is linked with the\nEastern Bengal State Railway at Katihar, and with the East Indian Railway by ferries across the Ganges.\n\nThe railways lying wholly within Bengal are the Eastern Bengal State (including the former Bengal Central), the Noakhali\u00b9 (Bengal), the Mymensingh-Jamalpur-Jagannathganj\u00b9, the South Bihar, the Bengal-Duars, the Calcutta Port Commissioners', the Darjeeling-Himalayan, the Deogarh, the Tarakeswar and the Cooch Behar Railways, and the Howrah-Amta, Howrah-Sheakhala, Tarakeswar-Magr\u0101, Bakhtiyarpur-Bihar, Barasat-Basirhat, and Baripada light railways.\n\nThe Eastern Bengal State Railway is of different gauges: 278.7 miles on the 5 feet 6 inch gauge and 20.3 miles on the 2 feet 6 inch gauge are on the south of the Padma, and north of that river 637.6 miles are on the metre-gauge and 34.8 miles on the 2 feet 6 inch gauge. The Cooch Behar State Railway, on the 2 feet 6 inch gauge, which is also on the north of the same river, forms part of the Eastern Bengal State Railway system. The terminus is at Sealdah in Calcutta. The main line runs north to the foot of the Himalayas at Siliguri, crossing the Padma by a ferry at S\u0101ra*. From Poradaha a branch line runs east to the steamer terminus at Goalundo*; and from P\u0101rvatipur*, north of the Ganges, branches run east to Dhubri in Assam and west to Katihar, where a junction is effected with the Bengal and North-Western Railway. Branch lines run south from Calcutta to Diamond Harbour, Budge-Budge, and Port Canning; and an isolated branch from N\u0101rayanganj* runs north to Dacca* and Mymensingh*, and thence to Jagannathganj* via Singhani. This railway brings to Calcutta large quantities of jute and tea from North Bengal and of jute from East Bengal.\n\nThe Bengal Central Railway, on the 5 feet 6 inch gauge, is a state line formerly worked by a company, which has been worked by the Eastern Bengal State Railway since July 1, 1905, the date of the termination of the contract between the Secretary of State for India and the company. It runs north-east from its terminus at Sealdah to Khulna, with a branch from Bangaon to R\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t, and carries a large jute traffic. The Bengal-Duars Railway on the metre-gauge traverses Jalpaiguri District*, and is connected with the Eastern Bengal State Railway system at Jalpaiguri* and Lalmanir H\u0101t*. It serves the sub-Himalayan tea district known as the Duars. The Calcutta Port Commissioners' Railway on the 5 feet 6 inch gauge connects the Eastern Bengal State Railway north of Calcutta with the docks; a short branch runs on the Howrah bank from Telkal Gh\u0101t to Shalim\u0101r. The Deogarh Railway is a metre-gauge line of short length running from Baidyan\u0101th, a station on the East Indian Railway, to Deogarh, a popular place of Hindu pilgrimage. The Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway, which is\n\n\u00b9 Transferred entirely from Bengal.\nassisted by Government, runs from Siliguri, the northern terminus of the Eastern Bengal State Railway, to Darjeeling. The ruling gradient is 1 in 28, and curves with radii varying from 60 feet (the sharpest) to 1,000 feet are almost continuous on the hill portion of the line.\n\nThe Howrah-Amt\u0101 Light Railway, like most of the other light lines, receives a 4 per cent. guarantee from the District board, and any profits above that figure are divided equally between the board and the company. Several similar lines have been constructed of late years, the most recent being the B\u0101r\u0101sat-Bas\u012br\u0101t Railway opened in 1905. The T\u0101rakeswar-Magr\u0101 Light Railway is also on the 2 feet 6 inch gauge. The Barip\u0101d\u0101 Light Railway, a feeder-line with a 2 feet 6 inch gauge, opened in 1905, connects the May\u016brbhanj State with the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway system.\n\nThe rapid extension of railways has revolutionized agricultural and trade conditions. They have rendered the greater portion of the Province immune from famine, and have greatly reduced the difficulty of battling with it in the few Districts still liable to its attacks. The railways have also done much to level prices and to moderate their fluctuations; and by putting food-grains in circulation, they have led to a vast increase in the cultivation of fibres, oilseeds, and other non-food crops of commercial value.\n\nThe principal statistics in connexion with the Provincial railways are given in Table VIII at the end of this article (pp. 351-2).\n\nRoads are classed as Provincial or District roads, the former being maintained from Provincial and the latter from District funds. Provincial aid is occasionally given to the District boards for the construction of new roads, especially for those intended to serve as feeders to railways. Minor roads are classed as municipal, Local fund, military or cantonment, and village roads.\n\nThe total length\\(^1\\) of Provincial roads, which was 1,663 miles in 1890-1 and 1,659 in 1900-1, increased to 2,406 in 1903-4. During the same periods the length of District roads increased from 32,110 to 37,728 and to 50,631 miles respectively; the last figure includes a great many village roads already in existence but not previously taken into account. The maintenance of Provincial roads cost 6.27 lakhs in 1890-1, 12.29 lakhs in 1900-1, and 9.99 lakhs in 1903-4. The corresponding figures for District roads were 22.09, 22.81, and 21.16 lakhs. The increase in the cost of maintenance of Provincial roads in 1900-1 was due to the expenditure of 7.34 lakhs on the Darjeeling roads after the cyclone. The grand trunk road traverses the Burdw\u0101n, Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, and Patna Divisions, from Calcutta to the western frontier, with a total\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The total length of Provincial roads in 1904-5 in the Province as now constituted was 2,362 miles, and of District roads 36,367 miles. The cost of maintenance of Provincial roads was 8.21 lakhs, and of District roads 14.45 lakhs.\nlength in the Province of 390 miles. The Orissa trunk road runs from Calcutta via Cuttack to the Madras border, the length being 320 miles. The R\u0101niganj-Midnapore road has a length of 101 miles, and the Bar\u0101kar-R\u0101nchi road of 120 miles. The Ganges-Darjeeling road runs from near Katihar to Siliguri for 124 miles. These roads are metalled. An important unmetalled road runs from Chittagong* to Daudk\u0101ndi*, a distance of 124 miles.\n\nIn the alluvial soil of Bengal proper it is very difficult to make good roads. The roads are raised by embankments above the level of the swamps with earth dug from the roadsides, but, stone not being available locally, very few of them can be metalled. Those which are metalled are soled with brick and dressed with broken brick. Stone is employed only in Calcutta and Chittagong*, to which ports ships bring stone in ballast. Elsewhere in the Province laterite and kankar make excellent road material, and stone also is sometimes available. The construction of railways has diminished the importance of the trunk roads, some of which have consequently been made over to District boards for maintenance. On the other hand, the increased facilities afforded by the railways for the export and import of goods have created a demand for numerous feeder-roads.\n\nThe ordinary country cart of Bengal consists of a framework of bamboo, supported on two wooden wheels and a wooden axle. The body is in the shape of a triangle tapering down towards the front, and it is drawn by a pair of bullocks which are yoked to a cross-bar about 4 feet long. The felloes of the wheels are made of six segments of sissu wood, and there are six spokes arranged in parallel pairs. The ekka is a light two-wheeled trap, drawn by a single pony. The body consists of a framework covered with coarse cloth with new\u0101r tape woven across. It can be used over the most uneven ground. The manjh\u014dli and the champani are both drawn by a pair of bullocks. The former is similar to an ekka, but the yoke consists of a beam of wood at right angles to another long beam projecting from the body of the cart. The champani is a two-wheeled, and sometimes a four-wheeled, light carriage similar in construction to an omnibus. It has, however, no benches within to sit on, and the travellers squat or lie down as they please. It has a pole with a cross-bar, which rests on the necks of the bullocks which drag it.\n\nOn the hill roads of Darjeeling a very heavy strongly made cart is used. In Bih\u0101r a distinction is made between the large heavy country cart or chakr\u0101 and the s\u0101gar, which is rougher, lighter, and cheaper, but otherwise very similar. In Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and the Orissa Tributary States, where the s\u0101gar is also in use among the villagers, the wheels do not exceed $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in diameter, and are made by joining three pieces of solid wood hewn out of a mango or mahua tree; being low and narrow, it is well suited for rough work and bad roads. The Oriy\u0101 cart is\npeculiar. It consists of two poles of sal wood or bamboo tied together at one end and about 3 feet apart at the other, and joined by cross-bars at intervals. The framework rests on a pair of wheels about 4 feet high and about 4 feet apart, and there is as much behind as in front of the axle-bar. The bullocks are yoked one on each side of the narrow end, and will drag half a ton 15 or 20 miles a day on a metalled road. For carrying grain a long coffin-shaped basket of split bamboo holding some 10 mounds is fitted on to the body of the cart, while in towns the body itself is often made in the shape of a box for transporting road materials. In Cuttack town, with the advent of the railway, the light little Madras hackeries drawn by a single bullock have become common.\n\nSeveral steam tramways have been opened in rural areas; but these would be more properly described as light railways, and as such have been mentioned in the section dealing with railways. The only tramway in urban areas is that serving the city of Calcutta, which is owned by a private company. This tramway was formerly dependent on horse traction; but the unsatisfactory condition of the tramway lines and of the traction employed led in 1900 to the framing of a new agreement between the Corporation and the company, the main features of which were the introduction of electric traction by means of overhead wires, the postponement of the Corporation's right to purchase the tramways to 1931, and the restriction of the fixed track rents payable by the company for the existing tramways to Rs. 35,000 a year. An arrangement has recently been made with the Calcutta Tramways Company for the introduction of a similar electric tramway service in Howrah.\n\nThe Calcutta and Eastern Canals are a system of improved natural channels connected by artificial canals, which carry the produce of East Bengal and of the Brahmaputra Valley to Calcutta. The total length is 1,127 miles, and the capital outlay amounts to 77.1 lakhs. The net revenue in 1903-4 was 1.3 lakhs, and in the same year the value of the goods carried was estimated at 512 lakhs.\n\nThe Hijili Tidal and Orissa Coast Canals run from the mouth of the Rupnarayan river to Chandbali in Balasore District, with a total length of 159 miles. The capital cost of the two canals has been 26.15 and 44.79 lakhs respectively. Their gross revenue in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 42,000 and Rs. 34,000 respectively; the former showed a small profit and the latter a loss on the year's working. The Bengal-Nagpur Railway has diverted much of the traffic from these canals, as it has also from the Midnapore and Orissa Canals, which, like the Son Canals, were constructed primarily for irrigation. The Midnapore Canal is navigable for 72 miles, and the tolls collected in 1903-4 amounted to Rs. 47,153. The Orissa Canals are navigable for 205 miles, and carried in 1903-4 cargo valued at 74 lakhs, the tolls aggregating Rs. 70,336. The Son Canals are navigable for 218 miles. The East Indian Rail-\nway has killed the traffic on them, and in 1903\u20134 they carried cargo valued at only 16 lakhs, the tolls amounting to Rs. 22,708.\n\nFinally, the Nadi\u0101 Rivers are a group of spill channels of the Ganges, which are kept open by artificial means in the dry season, and are navigable for 472 miles. In 1903\u20134 the cargo carried by them was valued at 205 lakhs; the gross revenue amounted to Rs. 88,402, but there was a loss of Rs. 15,986 on the year's working.\n\nIn the east of the Province the rivers and estuaries carry the bulk of the country trade, and the roads are little used, especially in the rainy season. The chief waterways are the Ganges and Brahmaputra, and their joint estuary the Meghn\u0101, which are navigable throughout their course in Bengal by river steamers and large country boats. Both rivers throw off in their lower reaches innumerable distributaries, which intersect the country in every direction and enable boats to find their way to every village and almost to the door of every cottage. The eastern deltaic offshoots of the Ganges feed the Calcutta and Eastern Canals. The Gandak in North Bih\u0101r still carries a heavy traffic, and the Mah\u0101nad\u012b and Br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b tap the hinterland of Orissa.\n\nWeekly steamers ply to Chittagong* and to Chandb\u0101li on the Orissa coast; small steamers also run from Chittagong* to Cox's B\u0101z\u0101r*. Goalundo*, at the confluence of the Padm\u0101 and Brahmaputra rivers, is the terminus of a great steamer traffic up the Ganges to Gh\u0101zipur, and up the Brahmaputra to Dibrugarh. A daily service to N\u0101r\u0101yanganj* connects Dacca* with Calcutta, while mail steamers to Chandpur* link up the Assam-Bengal with the Eastern Bengal State Railway. Steamers ply daily from Calcutta through the Sundarbans to Assam, via Baris\u0101l*, Chandpur*, and N\u0101r\u0101yanganj*. On the Hooghly river steamers run daily up to K\u0101lna, and down to Budge-Budge, Ulub\u0101ria, and Gh\u0101t\u0101l. On the Padm\u0101 steamers ply between D\u0101mukdia Gh\u0101t and R\u0101mpur Bo\u0101li\u0101* and God\u0101g\u0101ri*, with a continuation to English B\u0101z\u0101r (M\u0101lda)*, and between English B\u0101z\u0101r* and Sult\u0101nganj. From Khuln\u0101 steamers run to Baris\u0101l*, No\u0101kh\u0101li*, N\u0101r\u0101yanganj*, M\u0101d\u0101ripur* and other places, and there is a daily service on the Brahmaputra from Goalundo* to Phulchari*. Backergunge District* is also well served by steamers.\n\nSeveral lines of steamers connect Calcutta with London, the principal being those of the Peninsular and Oriental and the British India Steam Navigation Companies, and the City, Clan, Harrison, and Anchor Lines. The Hansa Line has a steamer service to Hamburg and Bremen, the Austrian-Lloyd Steam Navigation Company to Trieste, and the Brocklebank Line to Antwerp. The South African mails are carried by the Natal Line, while the steamers of the Indian and African Line also ply between Calcutta and Durban. The chief steamers running to Australia are those of the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Currie and Commonwealth Lines. A steamer of the Messageries\nMaritimes Company plies regularly between Calcutta, Pondicherry, and Colombo, where it connects with the main line between Marseilles and the Far East. Vessels belonging to the fleet of the British India Steam Navigation Company carry passengers and cargo to Penang and Singapore, and also to Chittagong*, Akyab, Rangoon, Moulmein, and various coast ports on both sides of the peninsula. The Calcutta-Hongkong Line of Messrs. Apcar & Co. maintains a regular service to Penang, Singapore, and Hongkong; while the Asiatic Steam Navigation Company carries the mails to Port Blair, and has a line of steamers running weekly to Burma and fortnightly to the coast ports and Bombay.\n\nCountry boats are of all shapes and sizes, and the largest carry some 150 tons. They are generally very broad in the beam and of light draught. All carry a great square sail, the larger boats adding a topsail. Against wind they are rowed, or poled if the water be shallow, and against tide or current they are towed from the bank. The cargo boats are always decked over. Passengers use the budgerow, a broad-beamed craft with ample cabin space and room for a galley in the stern. The bhauli\u0101 is a smaller and more lightly built passenger boat. On the smaller streams and across the swamps light dug-outs carry all the traffic. They are poled in shallow water and paddled on the deeper channels.\n\nThe larger rivers are rarely bridged, and passengers, carts, and cattle cross in ferry-boats. These ferries are leased annually at auction for a considerable sum. Some are Provincial, but most have been made over to District boards and municipalities. The total receipts from ferries in 1903-4 were 6.5 lakhs, of which 5 lakhs was credited to District boards and 1.5 lakhs to municipalities. Steam ferries ply across the Ganges, connecting railway systems; the most important are at S\u0101ra, Mokameh, and Palez\u0101 Gh\u0101t. A steam ferry crosses the Hooghly from Diamond Harbour to Geonkh\u0101li.\n\nThe Province is divided for postal purposes into three circles\u00b9, of which the Bengal circle (which includes K\u0101tm\u0101ndu in Nep\u0101l) is under a Postmaster-General, and the East Bengal and Bih\u0101r circles under Deputy-Postmasters-General. Each circle is subdivided into divisions managed by Superintendents. The table on the next page shows the remarkable advance which has taken place in postal business, for the three Bengal circles taken together.\n\nThe business is, however, still very small in comparison with the population, and the number of postal articles of all kinds delivered in 1903-4 works out to only two per head of the population. The figures relate to both the Imperial and District post. The latter system was a substitute for the official posts which under ancient custom\n\n\u00b9 In 1905 the Province, as reconstituted, became a single circle, the Bih\u0101r circle being abolished.\nBengal landowners had to maintain. A tax, known as the D\u0101k cess, was levied, and expended in maintaining postal communications required for administrative purposes, the up-keep of which was not warranted on commercial principles. The District Magistrate decided what communications were to be opened and maintained, but their management was in the hands of the Postal department. The expenditure from this cess, which was fixed for each District according to its requirements, averaged 3.58 lakhs annually for the five years ending in 1903\u20134. In 1903\u20134 the offices numbered 292, the length worked was 11,832 miles, and the expenditure amounted to Rs. 3,53,384. In 1906 the tax was abolished, and the District post was amalgamated with the Imperial system.\n\n|                      | 1880\u20131. | 1890\u20131. | 1900\u20131. | 1903\u20134 |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of post offices and letter boxes | 4,671   | 8,089   | 9,927   | 11,204  |\n| Number of miles of postal communication | 21,498  | 25,672  | 27,686  | 28,347  |\n| Total number of postal articles delivered (in thousands):\u2014 |         |         |         |         |\n| Letters              | 28,550  | 37,636  | 57,538  | 56,495  |\n| Postcards            | 3,433   | 24,922  | 53,678  | 64,307  |\n| Packets              | 382     | 2,524   | 6,747   | 4,803   |\n| Newspapers           | 2,229   | 5,394   | 9,388   | 10,248  |\n| Parcels              | 213     | 407     | 804     | 1,182   |\n| Rs. in thousands.    |         |         |         |         |\n| Value of stamps sold to the public | 11,91   | 12,53   | 31,35   | 36,16   |\n| Value of money orders issued | 1,20,24 | 5,08,02 | 7,99,03 | 8,81,87 |\n| Total amount of savings bank deposits | ...    | 1,54,46 | 2,93,62 | 3,39,80 |\n\nIn an agricultural country like Bengal the failure of the crops must always cause considerable distress, the degree of which varies with the nature and extent of the failure, the material condition of the people, and their character, and lastly the accessibility or otherwise of the tract affected.\n\nFamine. The great cause of deficient harvests is insufficient or badly distributed rainfall. Sometimes much damage is done by floods, and sometimes, though more rarely, by blight or locusts; but in such cases the area affected is generally limited.\n\nThe crop which is most sensitive to a short or badly distributed rainfall is the winter rice, which requires copious showers in May and a punctual commencement of the monsoon, but is especially dependent on the continuance of the rainfall throughout September and the early days of October; it is this crop which is most liable to fail in adverse\nseasons. It follows that, if the rainfall is uncertain, the tracts most liable to famine are those in which the winter rice is most largely grown. In the favoured Districts of Eastern Bengal the winter rice is the staple crop; but there a serious failure of the annual rains is unknown, and the subsoil water-level is so high that, in years when the rainfall is only moderately deficient, the ground retains sufficient moisture to prevent anything approaching a total loss of the crops. The whole of the Dacca* and Chittagong* Divisions are therefore excluded from the list of tracts liable to famine. Here the only danger of disaster arises from the cyclonic storm-waves which, at intervals, burst over the country and carry in their train widespread ruin and desolation. In other parts of Bengal proper, where also the winter rice is as a rule the principal crop, the immunity from famine is less complete; but the rainfall is usually ample, and the areas liable to famine are less extensive than in the other sub-provinces. From time to time the submontane tracts have been swept by disastrous floods; and, when the embankments on the left bank of the Bh\u0101girathi give way, floods occasionally break across Murshid\u0101b\u0101d and Nadi\u0101 Districts. The D\u0101modar also sometimes inundates the country on its right bank.\n\nIn Bih\u0101r the conditions north and south of the Ganges differ considerably. The latter has a more scanty rainfall; but it enjoys an extensive system of irrigation, partly from the Son Canals constructed by the Government, and partly from reservoirs constructed by the ryots themselves on the slopes of the undulations which characterize that part of the country. A great variety of crops are grown, and it rarely happens that famine obtains a grip over any considerable area. North of the Ganges the rainfall is more copious than on the south bank, but it is more capricious than in Bengal proper. In S\u0101ran and the south of Muzaffarpur there is a good deal of irrigation from wells or streams, and the crops are divided almost equally among the three great harvests of the year, so that a total crop failure is practically impossible. Elsewhere, and especially in the northern part of Champ\u0101ran, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhanga Districts, which borders on the Nep\u0101l tarai, winter rice is the main crop. In normal years the fertile soil yields bountiful crops without irrigation, which has not been adequately provided and which is necessary only in seasons of drought; but the population is dense, wages are low and rents high, and when the rains fail the distress is great. This is the zone described by Sir Richard Temple as the \u2018blackest of black spots on the famine map.\u2019 There has scarcely ever been a year of distress or scarcity in any part of Bengal when North Bih\u0101r did not bear the brunt of it. Orissa suffered terribly from famine in 1866 and 1867; but, since the construction of the canals now in existence, there has been no widespread crop failure, and it is only in Puri District that famine on a large scale is at all likely to occur. Chot\u0101\nN\u0101gpur is a sparsely populated region, inhabited by wild tribes; and its liability to famine is due mainly to its inaccessibility, which makes it difficult to import food-grains, and to the suspicious and restless nature of the ignorant aborigines, who shun relief works as they would the plague.\n\nThe danger of widespread famine is gradually being reduced, owing to the improvement in the material condition of the people, the growing demand for labour in the coal-mines, jute-mills, and other non-agricultural undertakings, the great improvement that has been made in communications, and especially the rapid growth of railways, which now tap nearly every District in the Province, and the construction of protective canals in the tracts where the danger of famine due to insufficient rainfall is greatest. In the whole Province it is estimated that an area of 74,500 square miles is liable to famine; and of this area 28,500 square miles are in the sub-province of Bih\u0101r, 27,000 in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, 14,500 in Bengal proper, and 4,500 in Orissa. The population of this area is 29,000,000; and if all these tracts were simultaneously affected by severe famine, it might be necessary to provide relief for 2,000,000 persons.\n\nThe first great famine of which we have any trustworthy record is that which devastated the Province in 1769\u201370, when Bengal, though under British control, was still under native administration. Eastern Bengal alone escaped, and, except for the importation of a small quantity of rice from this favoured tract, it does not appear that any public measures for relief were taken. One-third of the population of Bengal is believed to have perished in this terrible catastrophe. The next really serious scarcity in Bengal was the memorable Orissa famine of 1865\u20137. The full extent of the crop failure consequent on the scanty rainfall of 1865 and the exhaustion of the local food supplies was not realized by the authorities in time; and when at last, in June, 1866, an effort was made to provide the starving people with food, the south-west monsoon prevented the ships, lying laden with grain in the port of Calcutta, from reaching the stricken people\\(^1\\). It is said that a quarter of the population died of starvation and of the diseases which resulted. This disaster, appalling as it was, had one good result\u2014it led to a firm determination to prevent all similar occurrences in future, and from that time dates the earnest watchfulness which has never since been relaxed. At the next serious crop failure in 1874 scarcity prevailed chiefly in North Bih\u0101r and also, in a lesser degree, in South Bih\u0101r and North Bengal. On this occasion relief measures were undertaken in ample time, and all serious loss of life was prevented. The defect, if any, in the administration of this famine was that money was expended too\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The monsoon of 1866 was as heavy as that of the previous year had been light, and in low-lying tracts the rice was destroyed by floods. On this occasion ample relief was given.\nlavishly, and the object in view might perhaps have been effected at a lower cost than the 6 crores actually spent.\n\nIn 1891 the early close of the monsoon and the absence of the cold-season rains caused much damage to the winter rice and rabi crops, and relief operations were necessary in parts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Monghyr, Bhagalpur, Purnea, and Dinajpur*. The largest number on relief works on any one day was 83,000, and on gratuitous relief 4,700: the total cost of the operations was rather less than 5 lakhs.\n\nThe famine of 1896-7 was far more serious. The causes of the crop failure were a very unfavourable distribution of the rainfall early in 1896 and its entire absence after the early part of September. There had been a very poor harvest of winter rice in 1895, and in 1896 it was again this crop that suffered most. The brunt of the famine fell upon the Districts of Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, and Saran, and especially upon the tracts near the Nep\u00e1l frontier, where the proportion of rice cultivation is highest. In the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur plateau, Pal\u0101mau, Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, M\u0101nbhum, and two tracts in the Sant\u0101l Parganas were seriously affected. Relief works were opened in November, 1896, and by the close of the year 45,000 persons were employed on them. In March, 1897, the distress deepened rapidly, and the numbers on relief rose steadily until May, when 402,000 persons were employed on famine works, and 426,000 were in receipt of gratuitous relief. As soon as the monsoon had fairly set in, the numbers quickly diminished, and during September and October relief operations were brought to a close. The total expenditure was nearly 110 lakhs, in addition to advances to cultivators aggregating nearly 3 lakhs, donations of nearly 20 lakhs from the Charitable Relief Fund, the outcome of voluntary subscriptions in India, England, and other countries, and private relief by zamindars and others. The measures adopted were most successful in saving life; and the vital statistics, which are confirmed by the results of the last Census, show that, except in the wilder parts of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, the mortality was actually below the normal during the famine year\u00b9. The birth-rate was very little affected; it fell slightly in 1898, the year after the famine, but rose so much higher than usual in the following year, that the mean birth-rate of the two years taken together was considerably above the average for the decade.\n\nIn 1899 the monsoon was very capricious in parts of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur and Orissa. There was excessive rain in July, but exceptionally little in August and September. The crops were very poor throughout the area affected, but actual famine supervened only in about half of R\u0101nchi and a small part of Pal\u0101mau District.\n\nAs already stated, the immediate control of the Province of Bengal\n\n\u00b9 This subject is fully discussed in the Bengal Census Report for 1901, paragraphs 181, 184, 186, 199, 202, and 397.\nwas vested in the Governor-General of India till 1854, when a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed. He has a staff of five secretaries\u2014three for the ordinary civil administration and two for Public Works. The former are the Chief Secretary, who is in charge of the Revenue, Political, and Appointment departments, the General Secretary in the Judicial and General departments, and the Secretary in the Financial and Municipal departments. One of the Public Works Secretaries is concerned with irrigation, marine, and railways, and the other with roads and buildings. The Judicial department was formerly under the Chief Secretary, and revenue matters were dealt with by the General Secretary; but recently (1905) a redistribution of work has been introduced by which the Revenue department has been transferred to the Chief Secretary, and the Judicial department to the General Secretary. The branches of work now under the Chief Secretary include land revenue, surveys and settlements, agriculture, forests, mines, police, registration, and political matters; those under the Judicial and General Secretary include prisons, education, and emigration; and those under the Financial and Municipal Secretary include separate revenue, opium, local self-government, medical, and sanitation.\n\nThe control of all matters connected with the collection of the revenue and the administration of the land is vested in the Board of Revenue, which was constituted by Regulation III of 1822. There are two members, one of whom deals with land revenue, surveys and settlements, land registration, the management of wards' estates, the collection of cesses, &c., and the other with miscellaneous revenue, including excise, opium, income-tax, salt, customs, and the like. Each member is vested with the full powers of the Board in respect of his own department, and can act for his colleague if the latter is absent.\n\nFor administrative purposes Bengal is divided into nine Divisions, each of which is superintended by a Commissioner. Of these, five\u2014the Burdwan, Presidency, Rajshahi*, Dacca*, and Chittagong* Divisions\u2014lie within the limits of Bengal proper; two\u2014Patna and Bhagalpur\u2014make up the sub-province of Bihar, while Orissa and Chota Nagpur each forms a separate Commissionership. The average area\\(^1\\) of a Commissioner's Division is rather more than 17,000 square miles, and the average population is a little more than 8 millions. The Chota Nagpur Division with 27,000 square miles is the largest, while the most populous is the Patna Division with \\(15\\frac{1}{2}\\) millions, or about the population of the Bombay Presidency, excluding Sind. The Commissioner exercises a general control over the conduct of affairs within his Division. He is responsible for seeing that the local officers duly\n\n\\(^1\\) Bengal now consists of six Divisions, the average area being a little over 19,000 square miles.\nperform the duties required of them, and that the orders issued by Government are carried into effect. He is addressed by the local officers when they are in need of instructions, and he refers to Government or to the Board of Revenue all questions which he is not competent to dispose of himself. He also assists Government and the Board with his advice when called upon to do so.\n\nThese Divisions are again subdivided into Districts, each under a District officer, known as the Magistrate and Collector in regulation, and the Deputy-Commissioner in non-regulation tracts. Including Angul and the Chittagong Hill Tracts*, but excluding Calcutta, there are in all forty-seven Districts. The two largest are Hazaribagh and Ranchi, each extending over more than 7,000 square miles, or about half as large again as Wales, while the smallest is Howrah with only 510 square miles. The greatest number of inhabitants is found in Mymensingh*, whose population of 4,000,000 does not fall far short of that of the whole of Upper Burma. The average area of a District exceeds 3,300 square miles, and the average population is more than 1\u00bd millions.\n\nThese Districts again are usually partitioned into two or more subdivisions, the head-quarters subdivision being usually administered by the District Magistrate and each of the others by a Joint, Assistant, or Deputy-Magistrate subordinate to him. The total number of these subdivisions is 134. Their area is on the average 1,177 square miles, and their population more than 559,000. The last and smallest unit of administration is the police circle or thana. This is primarily the unit of police administration, and is usually in charge of a sub-inspector; but it has also come to be the acknowledged unit of territorial partition and is used in all administrative matters. The number of thanas in Bengal is 569, or about 12 per District; their average area is 277 square miles, and their population about 130,000 persons. The fiscal divisions of the Muhammadans, called parganas, formed the basis of the British revenue system; but they are wanting in compactness and, except for the purpose of land revenue payments, they are no longer of any practical importance.\n\nThe mainstay of the British administration is the District officer. He is the executive chief and administrator of the tract of country committed to him, and all other magisterial, police, and revenue officers therein employed are subordinate to him. As District Magistrate he is\n\n---\n\n* The non-regulation Districts are those in which some at least of the general laws and regulations are not in force. They form the 'Scheduled Districts' referred to in Act XIV of 1874 (see Vol. IV, p. 131).\n\nThere are now thirty-three Districts, the average area being 3,500 square miles.\n\nThere are now 100 subdivisions, the average area being 1,170 square miles and the average population 504,000.\nthe head of the department of criminal justice, which is charged with\nthe trial of all but the more important charges; the latter are committed\nto the Court of Sessions, if inquiry goes to show that a prima facie case\nhas been established. He is assisted in police matters by the District\nSuperintendent of police, who is allowed a free hand in all purely\nadministrative details. He is ex-officio chairman of the District board,\nand, as such, is in charge of all local public works, village sanitation,\nand education; he is assisted in these matters by the District Engineer\nand the Deputy-Inspector of schools. The municipalities of the Dis-\ntrict are sometimes presided over by official, and sometimes by non-\nofficial, chairmen, but in either case the District officer is expected to\nexercise a general supervision and control. He is also ex-officio Regis-\ntrar of assurances. As Collector he is responsible for the realization of\nall kinds of revenue and taxes, for the management of Government\nestates, the assessment of the income-tax, the settlement of, and super-\nvision over, excise and opium shops, &c., &c. The officers in charge\nof subdivisions exercise in their own jurisdictions, in subordination to\nthe District officer, the powers of chief local magistrate; certain other\npowers are also delegated to them, but they do not usually collect land\nrevenue, and in police matters they have only judicial and not executive\ncontrol.\n\nThe Magistrate-Collector is assisted in the criminal and revenue\nadministration of the District by a subordinate staff\u2014a Joint-Magis-\ntrate, Deputy-Magistrate-Collectors, Assistant Magistrate-Collectors, and\nSub-Deputy Magistrate-Collectors. Joint-Magistrates and Assistant Ma-\ngistrates are junior officers of the Indian Civil Service; the other officials\nare recruited in India, and are members of the Provincial or the Subor-\ndinate civil service. All these officials are stationed either at District\nor at subdivisional head-quarters.\n\nThe village watch are paid from taxation assessed and collected in\nthe villages by the panch\u0101yats, who represent all that remains in Bengal\nof village autonomy. These panch\u0101yats assist in the registration of vital\nstatistics; and recently, in order to develop the system of village govern-\nment, it has been decided that the presidents of the panch\u0101yats are to\nbe ex-officio visitors of primary schools aided from public funds or\nunder public management, and also of pounds, public ferries, and\npublic sarais in their Unions. In some Districts the presidents have\nalso been granted certain magisterial powers. In Chota N\u0101gpur village\ncommunities are still to be found, and some account of the system is\ngiven in the article on the Mund\u0101 tribe.\n\nThe following are the Native States under the control of, or in\npolitical relations with, the Government of Bengal\u00b9:\u2014\n\n\u00b9 In 1906 Sikkim and Bhutan were placed in direct relations with the Government\nof India.\nSikkim lies to the east of Nep\u0101l and is bounded on the north and north-east by Tibet, on the east by Bhut\u0101n, and on the south by Darjeeling District. Early in the nineteenth century Sikkim was menaced by the Gurkhas, but its independence was secured by the treaty made with Nep\u0101l in 1816, at which time it included the greater part of the present District of Darjeeling. In 1835 part of the hilly tract west of the Tista was ceded to the British Government, for the purpose of a sanitarium; and in 1850 the rest of it and the tarai, i.e. the Siliguri th\u0101na, were annexed on account of the R\u0101j\u0101's misbehaviour. For many years the State was left to manage its own affairs, but for some time prior to 1888 the Tibetans were found to be intriguing with the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, who became more and more unfriendly. Affairs reached a climax in 1888, when an expedition was sent against the Tibetans, who had advanced into Sikkim and built a fort at Lingtu. The Sikkim State was occupied by British troops, and the Tibetans were driven off with ease. Since 1889 a Political officer has been stationed at Gangtok, to advise and assist the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and his council. No precise rules have ever been laid down for the civil and criminal administration. All except very trivial cases are tried at Gangtok, either by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 himself or by the Political officer, or by one or other of them in association with some member of the council. Appeals are heard by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, sitting with one or more members of the council, or by a committee of the council. Capital sentences passed by other authorities require the confirmation of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. The annual budget estimates of income and expenditure are, in the first instance, approved by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 and the council, and are then submitted for the sanction of the Government by the Political officer.\n\nBhut\u0101n lies east of Sikkim and Darjeeling and north of Jalpaiguri* and of the Go\u0101lp\u0101ra, K\u0101mr\u016bp, and Darrang Districts of Assam. It is internally independent, and there is no British Resident. Repeated outrages on British subjects by the hillmen, and the brutal treatment of a British envoy, led in 1864 to the hostilities already described, which resulted in the confiscation of the Du\u0101rs*, or submontane tracts, with the passes leading into the hills, in return for which an annual subsidy of Rs. 50,000 is paid at Buxa*. Since then relations with Bhut\u0101n have, on the whole, been of a friendly character; and under the ascendancy of the Tongsa Penlop, who, in the name of the Deb R\u0101j\u0101, controls all public affairs, the country enjoys the advantage of a settled government. The Political officer in Sikkim now conducts relations with Bhut\u0101n also.\n\nThe Feudatory State of Cooch Beh\u0101r lies in the plains at the foot of the Bhut\u0101n hills, between the District of Rangpur* and the Jalpaiguri Du\u0101rs*. It is the only remnant of the great Koch kingdom founded by Biswa Singh in the early part of the sixteenth century;\nwhich, under his son Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan, extended from the Mah\u0101nand\u0101 as far east as Central Assam. On Nar N\u0101r\u0101yan\u2019s death the kingdom was divided into two parts, and only the western portion remained in the possession of the ancestors of the present Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, who accepted the Muhammadans as their overlords. Their power gradually declined, and from time to time they were shorn of outlying parts of their dominions. Early in the eighteenth century the Bhoti\u0101s began to interfere, and by 1772 they had taken possession of the R\u0101j\u0101 and of his capital. British aid was then sought, and, in consideration of the cession in perpetuity of half the revenues as then ascertained, the Bhoti\u0101s were driven out. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 administers the State with the assistance of a council, of which he is the president, and which includes the Superintendent of the State, a British officer, who is vice-president, and two State officials\u2014the D\u012bw\u0101n, who is revenue member, and the Civil and Sessions Judge, who is the judicial member. The executive control is vested in the Faujd\u0101ri Ahlk\u0101r, who corresponds to the Magistrate of a British District, and is subordinate to the Superintendent of the State. The Civil and Sessions Judge occupies much the same position as the corresponding officer in Bengal regulation Districts. Sentences of death require the confirmation of the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. The budget is passed by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101, and does not need the sanction of any other authority; but a general control over the affairs of the State is exercised by the Government of Bengal in the Political department.\n\nHill Tippera* lies to the south of Tippera District* and, like Cooch Beh\u0101r, represents the last fragment of a once powerful kingdom, which formerly extended far into the plains of East Bengal and South Assam, and which long bade defiance to the Muhammadan Naw\u0101bs\u00b9. The Tippera kings were gradually deprived of their rule in the plains, and at the time of the acquisition of Bengal by the East India Company they exercised sovereign powers only in the hill tract now ruled by them. The R\u0101j\u0101, however, derives the greater part of his income from certain large estates in British territory which he holds as zam\u012bnd\u0101r. No formal treaty regulates the relations between the British Government and the R\u0101j\u0101 of Hill Tippera*, but the succession of a new R\u0101j\u0101 has always been subject to recognition and investiture by the British authorities. No control was exercised in respect of the internal administration until the year 1871, when an English officer was appointed to reside in the State as Political Agent, to protect British interests and advise the R\u0101j\u0101. This officer was subsequently withdrawn, and his duties now devolve on the Magistrate and Collector of Tippera District*, who is ex-officio Political Agent for Hill Tippera*. He is\n\n\u00b9 The R\u0101jm\u0101la, or Chronicle of the Kings of Tippera, has been analyzed by the Rev. J. Long, in a paper in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. xix, p. 533.\nrequired to maintain a close watch over the affairs of the State, and it is to him that Government looks for information regarding all important occurrences there. All correspondence passes through him, and an annual report on the administration of the State is submitted to him for transmission to Government, through the Commissioner of the Chittagong Division*. The chief is himself the highest court of appeal in all civil and criminal matters, and sentences of death passed or confirmed by him are final.\n\nThe Orissa Tributary States\u00b9 are 17 in number: namely, Athgarh, T\u0101lcher, Mayurbhanj, Nilgiri, Keonjhar, P\u0101l Lahar\u0101, Dhenk\u0101n\u0101l, Athmallik, Hindol, Narsinghpur, Bar\u0101mb\u0101, Tigiri\u0101, Khandpar\u0101, Nay\u0101garh, Ranpur, Daspall\u0101, and Baud. These were acquired at the conquest of Orissa from the Mar\u0101th\u0101s in 1803; but as they had never been brought under complete control by the native governments, they were exempted from the operation of the general Regulations. Treaties were made with the several States on various dates between 1803 and 1829. It has been held that these States do not form part of British India, and the status, position, and power of the chiefs are defined in their sanads. The chiefs administer civil and criminal justice under the supervision of the Commissioner of the Orissa Division, who is ex officio Superintendent of the Tributary States. All capital cases, and, except in special cases when a chief\u2019s powers have been increased, all heinous offences which require more than two years\u2019 imprisonment, are committed by the Assistants to the Superintendent of Tributary Mah\u0101ls for trial. One of these is a special native Assistant, who tries sessions cases from certain States and such other cases as the Superintendent may make over to him; the others are the Magistrates of Cuttack, Puri, and Balasore, and the Deputy-Commissioner of Angul, who are ex-officio Assistant Superintendents, but, with the exception of the two last mentioned, they do not often deal with criminal cases. The Assistant Superintendents have the power of District Magistrates and Sessions Judges, while the Superintendent has the powers of a Sessions Judge, and also, in respect of the proceedings of his subordinates, those of a High Court.\n\nIn Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur there are seven Tributary and two Political States\u00b2. The former, including Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r*, Korea*, Jashpur*, Surguj\u0101*, Udaipur*, G\u0101ngpur, and Bonai, were tributaries of the Bhonsla dynasty\n\n\u00b9 Owing to the territorial change effected in October, 1905, the number of these States has been increased from 17 to 24, as two States, G\u0101ngpur and Bonai, have been transferred from the Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur States, and five more, namely, B\u0101mr\u0101, Kair\u0101kh\u014dl Sonpur, Patn\u0101, and Kal\u0101handi, have been transferred from the Central Provinces.\n\n\u00b2 The Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur States now include only the two Political States of Khars\u0101wan and Saraikela. Of the other States, G\u0101ngpur and Bonai have been transferred to the Orissa Tributary States, and the rest, namely, Ch\u0101ng Bhak\u0101r, Korea, Jashpur, Surguj\u0101, and Udaipur, have been transferred to the Central Provinces.\nof N\u0101gpur, and were ceded under the provisional agreement concluded with M\u0101dhuji Bhonsla in 1818. The tribute was then fixed at a lower rate than that levied under the Mar\u0101th\u0101 government, and the settlements with the chiefs were made for a limited period. Fresh settlements for a nominal term of five years were made in 1827, but were not renewed until 1875, when they were made for a period of twenty years. The latter were renewed in 1889, when the tribute was fixed for a further period of twenty years, and the States having in the meantime been declared by the Secretary of State to be outside British India, the relations between them and the British Government were defined in their new sanads. The chiefs of these States are under the control of the Commissioner of Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. They are permitted to levy rents and certain other customary dues from their subjects. They are empowered to pass sentences of imprisonment up to five years and of fine to the extent of Rs. 200; but sentences of imprisonment for more than two years, or of fine exceeding Rs. 50, require the confirmation of the Commissioner. Heinous offences calling for heavier punishment are dealt with by the Deputy-Commissioners of R\u0101nchi, Pal\u0101mau, and Singhbhum, who exercise the powers of District Magistrates and Assistant Sessions Judges; the Commissioner and Judicial Commissioner in respect of such cases occupy the position of a Sessions Court, while the functions of a High Court are performed by the Government of Bengal.\n\nThe two Political States of Saraikel\u0101 and Khars\u0101w\u0101n lie in Singhbh\u016bm, and control over them is exercised by the Commissioner through the Deputy-Commissioner of that District. They were claimed as feudatories by the R\u0101j\u0101 of Por\u0101h\u0101t, whose territory was confiscated in 1857 for rebellion, but was in 1895 restored as a revenue-free zamind\u0101ri to his son. It is believed that engagements were taken from the chiefs of these States, but they are not now forthcoming. They have now, however, received sanads similar to those described above, and their general position is much the same as that of the R\u0101j\u0101s of the Tributary States, except that they do not pay tribute.\n\nThe laws in force in Bengal consist of (1) Acts of Parliament relating to India; (2) certain still unrepealed Regulations of what was known as the Bengal Code, framed by the Executive Government before the creation of the legislative bodies; (3) Acts of the Governor-General\u2019s Legislative Council, now constituted under the Indian Councils Acts, 1861 and 1892; (4) Regulations for certain backward tracts issued by the Government of India under the Statute 33 Vict., c. 3; and lastly, (5) Acts of the Bengal Legislative Council. The Bengal Council came into existence on January 18, 1862, under a proclamation by the Governor-General-in-Council which extended the provisions of the Indian Councils Act,\n1861, to the Bengal Division of the Presidency of Fort William. The Council at first consisted of twelve members and a president, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal; but this number has been raised to twenty under the Indian Councils Act, 1892. By regulations made under this Act, it has been provided that of the twenty members not more than ten shall be officials; of the non-official members seven are nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor on the recommendation of certain local bodies and associations, and three at his own discretion.\n\nThe financial position of the Government of Bengal is explained in Council every year, and is there open to criticism, so far as it concerns the branches of revenue and expenditure that are under the control of the Government of Bengal. There is also a right of interpellation, which is limited to matters under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor, who may disallow questions which appear to him to be inconsistent with the public interest. No resolution can be proposed or division taken in connexion with the financial statement.\n\nAmong the legislative measures enacted since 1880, which specially affect this Province, the following deserve mention:\n\nAct of the Indian Council\n\nThe Bengal Tenancy Act (VIII of 1885).\n\nActs of the Bengal Council\n\nThe Bengal Drainage Act (VI of 1880).\nThe Cess Act (IX of 1880).\nThe Bengal Municipal Act (III of 1884).\nThe Bengal Local Self-Government Act (III of 1885).\nThe Calcutta Port Act (III of 1890).\nThe Public Demands Recovery Act (I of 1895).\nThe Calcutta Municipal Act (III of 1899).\n\nIn respect of civil justice the High Court at Calcutta (more properly designated the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal) is a court of record and equity, and is constituted under the Indian High Courts Act, 1861, as the supreme court in Bengal, exercising both original (including ecclesiastical, admiralty, and bankruptcy) and appellate jurisdiction. Below the High Court are the District and Additional Judges, the Small Cause Courts, the Subordinate Judges, who are sometimes also appointed to be Assistant Judges, and the Munsifs. Of these, the District, Additional, and Assistant Judges also exercise the powers of a criminal court; the others are purely civil judges, with the exception of a few Munsifs who are vested with magisterial powers.\n\nThe ordinary jurisdiction of a Munsif extends to all original suits cognizable by the civil courts in which the value of the subject matter\n\n---\n\n1 As regards legislation and the functions of the Provincial Legislative Councils, see Vol. IV, chap. v.\nin dispute does not exceed Rs. 1,000, or, if specially extended, Rs. 2,000. The jurisdiction of a Subordinate Judge or District Judge extends to all original suits cognizable by the civil courts. It does not, however, include the powers of a Small Cause Court unless these have been specially conferred.\n\nAppeals from Munsifs lie to the District Judge, or to the Subordinate Judge, if the High Court, with the sanction of the Local Government, so direct. Appeals from Subordinate Judges lie to the District Judge, except when the value of the subject-matter exceeds Rs. 5,000, in which case the appeal lies to the High Court. Appeals from the decrees and orders of District and Additional Judges lie to the High Court. An appeal may, subject to certain restrictions, be preferred from the High Court to the Privy Council in England, if the amount in dispute exceeds Rs. 10,000.\n\nThe powers of Courts of Small Causes are regulated by Act IX of 1887. Subject to certain exceptions, their jurisdiction extends to all suits of a civil nature of which the value does not exceed Rs. 500, a limit which may be increased to Rs. 1,000 by a special order of the Local Government. The Local Government is empowered, under Act XII of 1887, to invest Subordinate Judges and Munsifs with Small Cause Court jurisdiction for the trial of cases not exceeding Rs. 500 in value in the case of Subordinate Judges, and Rs. 100 in the case of Munsifs. In civil suits above a certain limit Calcutta is under the original jurisdiction of the High Court. The Small Cause Court of Calcutta has a purely local jurisdiction and is regulated by a special Act.\n\nThe principal statistics\\(^1\\) relating to civil justice are embodied in the statement below:\n\n| Class of suits          | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901   | 1903   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Suits for money and movable property | 255,630                          | 297,137                          | 284,017| 298,686|\n| Title and other suits   | 35,653                            | 63,234                           | 76,271 | 79,350 |\n| Rent suits              | 180,650                           | 247,787                          | 286,201| 339,099|\n| Total                   | 471,933                           | 608,158                          | 646,489| 714,135|\n\nCriminal justice is administered by magistrates (of whom there are three classes), the Courts of Sessions, and the High Court. Subject to the maximum punishment prescribed by law for each offence, a magistrate of the first class has power to sentence offenders to imprisonment,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The corresponding number of suits instituted in 1903 in Bengal as now constituted was:\u2014Suits for money and movable property, 161,173; title and other suits, 46,914; rent suits, 211,783; total, 419,870.\neither rigorous or simple, up to two years, including solitary confinement, or to fine to the extent of Rs. 1,000, or to imprisonment and fine combined, or to whipping as a separate or an additional punishment. A magistrate of the second class can award imprisonment up to six months, fine up to Rs. 200, or both, and also whipping, if specially empowered in this behalf. A magistrate of the third class may imprison up to one month or fine up to Rs. 50, or he may combine these punishments. Benches consisting of two or more honorary magistrates, sitting together, have been appointed at almost all the District head-quarters, and at most of the subdivisional stations in Bengal. An honorary magistrate, if specially empowered, can also sit singly for the trial of cases. Honorary magistrates are ordinarily appointed for a term of three years, which is renewable. Their powers vary according to circumstances; but, generally speaking, benches of honorary magistrates are invested with second or third-class powers, and the majority of honorary magistrates sitting singly with the powers of a magistrate of the second class. The Magistrate of the District exercises first-class powers, and hears appeals against convictions by magistrates of the second and third classes. Such appeals may also be heard by any magistrate of the first class duly empowered by the Local Government. Magistrates of the first class and benches of magistrates of the second and third classes may try certain offences summarily when specially empowered to do so, but in such cases the sentence may not exceed three months' imprisonment.\n\nIn Calcutta criminal justice is administered by three stipendiary Presidency Magistrates a municipal magistrate appointed to try offences under the Municipal Act, and several benches of honorary magistrates.\n\nThe Courts of Sessions are presided over by a single Judge, who tries, with the aid of a jury or assessors, all cases committed to him by the magistracy, and decides, sitting alone, all appeals from convictions by magistrates of the first class, other than those in cases tried summarily, when the magistrate passes a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding three months, or fine not exceeding Rs. 200, or of whipping only, or in petty cases, when the sentence does not exceed one month's imprisonment or Rs. 50 fine. The Sessions Judge is also empowered to call for and examine the record of any proceeding before a subordinate court, for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the correctness and legality of any order passed. The powers of a Sessions Judge are limited only by the maximum punishment fixed for each offence in the Penal Code, but sentences of death are subject to confirmation by the High Court.\n\nThe High Court, on its original side, tries, by a single Judge with a jury, all cases committed to it by the Presidency Magistrates, and also\ncertain cases in which the accused are European British subjects, which may be committed for trial by magistrates in the interior. On its appellate side the High Court, by a bench of two or more Judges disposes of appeals in respect of convictions on trials before a Court of Sessions. It revises, upon reference from Sessions Judges or magistrates, the decisions of inferior courts, when in error upon points of law, deals with appeals which the Local Government may prefer against acquittals, and confirms, modifies, or annuls all sentences of death passed by Sessions Courts.\n\nThe table below contains some of the more important statistics relating to criminal justice. During the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of offences against property, which is said to be due to the high price of food-grains.\n\n| Number of persons tried: | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | 1901 | 1903 | Percentage of convictions, 1903 |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------|------|-------------------------------|\n| (a) For offences against person and property | 89,832                           | 95,346                           | 99,834 | 98,852 | 38.8                          |\n| (b) For other offences against the Indian Penal Code | 36,569                           | 37,249                           | 33,313 | 33,742 | 61.2                          |\n| (c) For offences against special and local laws | 98,302                           | 130,487                          | 111,425 | 121,052 | 84.3                          |\n| Total                    | 224,703                          | 263,082                          | 244,572 | 253,646 | 63.5                          |\n\nThe registration of assurances is effected under the same law (Act III of 1877) as in other parts of British India. The cost is met by fees levied from persons presenting documents for registration or desiring copies of registered documents, according to a scale prescribed by Government. The Registration department is presided over by an Inspector-General. The District Magistrates, who are ex-officio Registrars, have full powers of inspection and control over all registration offices in their Districts, and are responsible for the proper conduct of the work. At the head-quarters of each District there is a salaried officer, known as the special sub-registrar, who deals with the documents.\n\n1 The following table gives the corresponding figures for 1903 for Bengal as now constituted:\n\n| Number of persons tried | Percentage of convictions |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (a) Offences against person and property | 68,916 | 40.3 |\n| (b) Other offences against the Indian Penal Code | 22,781 | 62.7 |\n| (c) Offences against special and local laws | 99,858 | 87.4 |\n| Total                   | 191,555 | 67.5 |\npresented for registration there, and assists the Registrar in the supervision of the proceedings of all other registration officers in the District. The number of the latter, who are called rural sub-registrars, varies according to local requirements. Formerly the special sub-registrars used to receive, in addition to their salaries, a commission on the documents registered by them, while the rural sub-registrars were remunerated only by fees on a sliding scale and were entitled to no pension or gratuity on retirement. A new scheme for the reorganization of the department has, however, recently been introduced. The system of payment of commission has been abolished, and both the special and rural sub-registrars have been graded on fixed salaries, the services of the latter, like the former, being made pensionable. In Calcutta the Registrar is a separate officer on a fixed salary. The chief statistics connected with registration operations are exhibited below. The number of documents registered in 1901 was more than double the average of the decade 1881-90, and the receipts exceeded those of the same decade by more than 50 per cent.\n\n|                  | 1881-90 | 1891-1900 | 1901   | 1903* |\n|------------------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Number of offices| 297     | 395       | 442    | 454   |\n| Number of documents registered | 709,642 | 1,226,997 | 1,442,347 | 1,448,010 |\n| Annual receipts Rs. | 10,58,365 | 14,42,331 | 16,51,822 | 16,41,989 |\n| Expenditure Rs. | 5,62,043 | 8,18,406 | 8,83,927 | 8,90,418 |\n\nThe corresponding figures for the present area of Bengal are: number of offices 272; and of documents registered 806,920; annual receipts Rs. 10,44,127; and expenditure Rs. 5,20,618. These figures include the portion of Sambalpur District not transferred to Bengal, separate statistics for which are not available.\n\nThe present Provincial system of finance dates from 1871, when the financial management of the great spending departments of registration, jails, police, education, medical (except medical establishments), printing, and certain branches of public works expenditure was entrusted to the Government of Bengal, a fixed assignment of 117 lakhs being made to meet the charges. In 1877 the process of decentralization was continued by the transfer to the Local Government of other items of expenditure, together with the assignment, on progressive terms, of certain heads of revenue which it was thought would benefit by careful local management, including salt, stamps, excise, Provincial rates, and assessed taxes; an equilibrium being established between the income from these sources and the expenditure, as estimated for the first year of the contract, by means of a fixed money contribution. The receipts and expenditure on state railways and canals were also made over to the Local Government. It was anticipated that the interest charges on account of their cost of construction would exceed the net earnings, and the Local\nGovernment was empowered to meet the deficiency by taxation to be raised by a special public works cess imposed under Act II (B.C.) of 1877. This settlement was made for a period of five years.\n\nOn its expiry, a new settlement was arranged, on very similar terms, but a proportion of the land revenue was given instead of the fixed money contribution required to produce an equilibrium between revenue and expenditure, and the public works cess, being no longer regarded as hypothecated for the payment of interest on the capital cost of Provincial public works, became merged in the general revenues of the Province. In the three quinquennial settlements which followed, no material advance in the system of decentralization was made; but the shares of the Provincial and Supreme Governments in the three principal heads of land revenue, stamps, and excise were redistributed, the Local Government obtaining in 1887 and 1892 one-quarter of the receipts from land revenue and excise, and three-quarters of the stamp revenue. Meanwhile, the management of all but a few minor lines of railway was gradually resumed by the Government of India, the last railway to be transferred from local control being the Eastern Bengal State Railway. This was in 1897; and in order to compensate for the loss of this progressive source of revenue, the Provincial share of the receipts from excise was raised from one-quarter to one-half. At the same time, the receipts and expenditure of the Salt department were reserved as wholly Imperial. The settlement of 1897 was, as usual, fixed originally for five years, but was extended by two years and did not expire until March 31, 1904.\n\nThe latest settlement marks a great advance in decentralization. The previous five-year settlements began with undue economy and ended with extravagance. The difficulty has been to devise a scheme which should be permanent, but which should not involve unfairness, or risk of unfairness after a lapse of years, to the Supreme Government or to the Local Government. For this problem a simple solution has been found. The present settlement is neither for five years nor is it permanent, but it will last for an indefinite period, and it is subject to revision if over a long period of years it is found to be unfair to one side or the other. Another principle laid down was that when heads of revenue or expenditure were divided, the Local Government should have the same share both of the revenue and of the expenditure under the same head. This has, however, been departed from in the case of land revenue, the expenditure on which has been made wholly Provincial, although the Local Government gets only one-quarter of the receipts. The Local Government gets the whole of the receipts under registration, one-half of those under stamps, seven-sixteenths of those under excise, and one-quarter of those under assessed taxes and forests, and bears the same proportion of expenditure in each case.\nThe result of this arrangement has been to reduce the annual net addition to the Provincial revenue by about one-fourth. Previous settlements involved a revision at the end of five years, which meant that the Local Government gave up part of its income to the Supreme Government. As such revisions are no longer to be made, it is obvious that the rate of expenditure must be fixed on a somewhat lower level. On the other hand, the Local Government will not benefit from the absence of revision until the expiry of five years, when the first revision would otherwise take place; and to make up for this, the Supreme Government made a grant to the Local Government of a lump sum of 50 lakhs, on the understanding that its expenditure was to be spread over several years. The net result of the changes under the present settlement is that the charges made over to Provincial management exceed the Provincialized receipts by 49 lakhs, and this deficit is made good annually by a fixed assignment under the Land Revenue head.\n\nThe general financial results, so far as the Province of Bengal is concerned, will be seen from Tables IX and X at the end of this article (pp. 353\u20134). The most noteworthy features are the expansion of the revenue under the headings excise, Provincial rates, registration, stamps and forests, and of the expenditure under superannuation, law and justice, police, contributions to Local funds, medical, and general administration. The growth of the excise revenue has been due to various causes, of which the more important are enhancement of the rates of duty levied, increase of population, greater prosperity of the people, which has enabled them to spend more on luxuries, improvement in the efficiency with which the department is administered, and not least the general rise of prices, which has affected excisable equally with other articles, and has swelled the receipts of the venders and the public revenue. The avowed policy of the Government has been to restrict the consumption of drugs and spirits by raising the duty charged on them. The steady expansion under Provincial rates, which are assessed on the annual value of land, is due mainly to periodic revaluations, and not to any change in the rate at which the cess is levied, which has for many years stood at the maximum allowed by law. The registration receipts, though they still show an upward tendency, increased most rapidly during the early years of the system of Provincial contracts, when registration offices were freely opened wherever there appeared to be a reasonable demand for them, with the result that many more documents were brought under registration than had been the custom in previous years. In 1887 it was decided that process-serving fees in revenue courts and copying fees should in future be levied in court-fee stamps and not in cash, and this led to a marked improvement in the stamp revenue. Apart from this, the development of this source of revenue is the outcome of growing prosperity and industrial and com-\nmercial development, and that under forests is due to more efficient management coupled with an increasing demand for forest produce.\n\nThere has been a rise on account of salaries in various departments. Exchange compensation allowance has been granted to European officials, and in several departments there has been a reorganization of establishments and a general increase of pay. During the currency of the settlement of 1884-5, an additional yearly expenditure of 43 lakhs was incurred under 'judicial courts,' the result of an increase in the number of Subordinate Judges and Munsifs and of judicial establishments generally. About the same time the reorganization of the police department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Police Commission of 1891, led to an additional yearly expenditure of about 6 lakhs. In recent years the expenditure under medical has been swollen by charges incurred in connexion with the suppression of plague; but large sums have also been spent on works of general utility, such as the building of the Bhawanipur Hospital, the remodelling of the General Hospital, and the extension of the Medical College in Calcutta. The increased contributions to Local funds were made partly to aid them in the arrangements they had to carry out for the prevention of plague or in the repairs of damages caused by the disastrous earthquake of 1897, and partly to assist them to provide feeder-roads for railways and improve communications generally. The ordinary income of the District boards is not capable of much expansion, and those bodies have to rely on subventions from Government to meet their growing needs, while the amount of aid which the latter is able to render varies with its own financial position.\n\nThe transfer of a number of Districts to Eastern Bengal and Assam has reduced the Provincial revenues to about 463 lakhs (estimate for 1906-7), to which is added a fixed contribution of 11 lakhs from Imperial funds.\n\nThe current land revenue demand for the year 1903-4 was more than 4 crores, or one-fifth of the principal heads of receipts in the Province. Four-fifths of the land revenue was permanently settled at the end of the eighteenth century; and since that date the zamindars and their tenants have shared between them the entire benefit of the enormous increase in the value of the produce of land which has taken place, including that of waste land since brought under cultivation. The result is that Bengal pays a lower\n\n---\n\n1 The Provincial finances were seriously crippled in 1897 by an expenditure of 271 lakhs on famine relief, besides nearly 5 lakhs granted as compensation for the dearness of food to the lower-paid servants of Government, and a heavy expenditure on account of plague; it was thus necessary to withhold the much-needed aid to local bodies until equilibrium was restored by a special contribution of 17 lakhs from the Government of India.\n\n2 The demand in Bengal as now constituted was 284 lakhs, or nearly 3 crores.\nrevenue than any other Province, with the single exception of the Central Provinces, and the incidence of the land revenue per acre is only Rs. 0-13-2 as compared with Rs. 1-7-8 for India as a whole.\n\nAccording to valuation returns furnished by zamind\u0101rs and tenure-holders under the Cess Act, the total rental of the Province amounted in 1903-4 to 17-84 crores. Of this sum, the land revenue absorbs less than one quarter, and the remainder is shared by the zamind\u0101rs, tenure-holders, revenue-free proprietors, and rent-free holders. These figures illustrate the huge financial sacrifice involved in the permanent settlement, for, after deducting the gross rental of revenue-free estates, rent-free holdings, and temporarily settled estates, the 'assets' of the permanently settled revenue-paying estates may be estimated at 147 lakhs; and if the revenue had been periodically resettled, their assessment would probably now be not less than half the gross rental, i.e. 736 lakhs, or considerably more than double the actual figures of 323 lakhs.\n\nThe earliest assessment known to have been made in the Province was Todar Mal's great settlement of 1582, according to which the revenue of Bengal, Bih\u0101r, and Orissa amounted to 185 lakhs of rupees. The principle of Todar Mal's settlement was to ascertain the produce of each field, and to take as the revenue a share of it, estimated by different authorities at one-third or one-fourth. Bengal, however, being an outlying Province of the empire, was not measured, and Bih\u0101r was only partially surveyed; the assessment was therefore made on the basis of the reports of village accountants, and cannot be said to have borne any ascertained relation to the produce of the soil. Such as it was, however, it remained the basis of all subsequent Mughal settlements, and practically of the Decennial Settlement also.\n\nTodar Mal's revenue was enhanced by the successive Mughal governors of Bengal, the increases being due partly to territorial acquisitions, partly to abw\u0101bs or proportionate additions to the original assessment of Todar Mal, and partly to the taxation of newly cultivated or improved lands. By 1765, when the British acquired the Diw\u0101ni or financial administration of the Province, the nominal revenue had risen to 312 lakhs, though it is doubtful whether so large a sum was ever realized.\n\nIn 1790-1 the Decennial Settlement, which in 1793 was declared permanent, was carried out by British officers, and the total assessment, including that of two Districts in Assam, amounted to 268 lakhs of si\u010dca rupees, or 286 lakhs of Company's rupees. It was made on the basis of preceding temporary settlements; and detailed inquiries regarding out-turn and rates of rent were expressly forbidden, as the Directors were anxious to avoid any investigations of an inquisitorial character. It is impossible, therefore, to determine the proportion which the\nassessment bore either to the produce of the land, or to the rental received by the zamindars. It was believed at the time, however, that it amounted to 90 per cent. of the gross rental; and Sir John Shore estimated that, of the gross produce of the soil, the British Government received 45 per cent., the zamindars and their under-renters 15 per cent., and the cultivators 40 per cent.\n\nThe increase in the revenue of the permanently settled estates, from 286 lakhs in 1790-1 to 323 lakhs in 1903-4, was due to the resumption and assessment, during the first half of the nineteenth century, of a large number of estates which had been claimed as free of revenue. During the same period, however, the gross rental of these estates has risen from 318 to 1472 lakhs (assuming that the assessment of 1790 was equivalent to 90 per cent. of the gross rental); in other words, the Government share of the rental has fallen during this period from 90 to 24 per cent.\n\nThe operations of the Permanent Settlement did not include the unsettled part of Chittagong*, the Kolhan estate in Singhbhum and other tracts in Chota Nagpur, the Daman-i-Koh in the Santal Parganas, or the Sundarbans. These tracts are temporarily settled, as are also many alluvial islands and estates which have escheated, or been purchased from time to time by the Government at revenue sales. Tracts acquired since 1793 are also temporarily settled: namely, the sub-province of Orissa, acquired from the Marathas in 1803; the Khurda estate in Puri, confiscated in 1804; the District of Darjeeling, acquired partly from Sikkim in 1835 and 1850, and partly from Bhutan in 1864; the estates of Banki and Angul, confiscated in 1839 and 1847; and the Western Duars*, taken from Bhutan in 1864. Cachar and the Assam Valley proper were acquired on various dates between 1826 and 1842; but in 1874 they and the permanently settled Districts of Sylhet and Goalpara were separated from Bengal and formed into a separate administration. A brief review of the revenue history of the separate tracts is given below.\n\nOrissa was settled in 1845 at a revenue of 13.84 lakhs for a period of thirty years, which, however, was extended in consequence of the famine of 1866. In 1897 it was resettled for 21.05 lakhs, or 54 per cent. of the 'assets,' which amounted to 38.68 lakhs. The incidence of the new revenue is Rs. 1-1-10 per acre, and the period of settlement thirty years. The Khurda estate was settled ryotwari in 1875 for 2.68 lakhs. In 1897 the estate was resettled for fifteen years at a revenue of 3.46 lakhs, the increase being effected by an enhancement of 3 annas in the rupee. The incidence of rent per acre is Rs. 1-10-6.\n\nThe resettlement of the Palamau estate in 1896 for a term of fifteen years resulted in the increase of the rental from Rs. 58,000 to Rs. 74,000, mainly on the ground of extension of cultivation; the average rate of\nrent paid by settled ryots is Rs. 1-2-3 per acre. By the settlement of the Darjeeling tarai in 1898 the revenue was raised from Rs. 93,000 to Rs. 1,12,000, the assessment being made at rates varying from 4 annas to Rs. 2 per acre, and the term being fixed for twenty years. The B\u00e2rki estate in Cuttack District was resettled in 1891, the revenue being increased from Rs. 21,000 to Rs. 29,000, mainly on account of extensions of cultivation. The revenue of Angul, resettled in 1892, was increased from Rs. 46,000 to one lakh for the same reason, but the enhancement was introduced on the progressive system. The Western Duars* were resettled in 1895, when the revenue was increased from 2\u00b734 to 3\u00b775 lakhs.\n\nThe temporarily settled estates in Chittagong* were settled in 1848 and in 1881, the aggregate revenue amounting to 3\u00b785 lakhs. This was raised by the settlement of 1897 to 6 lakhs, the enhancement being due chiefly to extension of cultivation. The settlement was made partly with middlemen, who were allowed to retain, on the average, 41 per cent. of the 'assets,' and partly with the ryots direct. The average rate of rent paid by settled ryots is Rs. 5 pe: acre. The term of this settlement is thirty years.\n\nThe settlement of the Jaypur Government estate in Bogra District* in 1898 increased the revenue from Rs. 39,000 to Rs. 51,000, while the resettlement of a number of petty Government estates in the Sundarbans and elsewhere raised the demand from 4\u00b720 to 5\u00b741 lakhs.\n\nIt has already been stated that the revenue\\(^1\\) of the permanently settled estates has risen from 286 to 323 lakhs. The revenue of the temporarily settled estates, which was nil in 1790, was in 1903\u20134 36 lakhs, and that of estates held direct by Government 46 lakhs, the total revenue of the three classes of estates taken together being 405 lakhs, compared with 347 lakhs in 1850, 379 lakhs in 1882, and 383 lakhs in 1892. The formation of the Province of Assam in 1874 deprived Bengal of a total land revenue of 30 lakhs, of which 4\u00bd lakhs was due from the permanently settled estates of Sylhet and Goalpara and the remainder from other areas.\n\nThe number of permanently settled estates is increasing very rapidly owing to partitions; this is especially the case in the Patna Division, where the number has almost trebled in thirty-eight years. Revenue-paying estates\\(^2\\) in 1903\u20134 numbered 190,000, of which 176,000 are permanently and 10,500 temporarily settled, and the remainder are held\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the present area of Bengal the current demand from permanently settled estates in the same year was 228\u00bd lakhs, from temporarily settled estates 29\u00bd lakhs, and from estates held direct by Government 25\u00bd lakhs.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the same year the number of revenue-paying estates in the present area of Bengal was 122,000, of which 110,000 were permanently and 10,000 temporarily settled, the remainder being held direct by Government.\ndirect by Government. Only 474 estates are large properties of over 20,000 acres, while 90 per cent. of the total number comprise less than 500 acres apiece.\n\nIn addition, 56,000 revenue-free estates and 110,000 rent-free holdings are assessed to road and public works cesses. At the time of the Permanent Settlement large areas were claimed revenue-free, and the authority to scrutinize such revenue-free grants, and, if invalid, to resume them, was specially reserved. They were divided into two classes, according as they had been granted by the Mughal emperor direct, or by the officials of the empire. The former were recognized as valid if the holder could prove that his grant was hereditary and that he was in possession. The latter were accepted as valid if dated prior to 1765; all grants of a subsequent date were resumed, but those given between 1765 and 1790 were assessed at privileged rates. All rent-free grants made by zamindars after 1790 were invalidated, and zamindars were authorized to nullify their own grants. Resumption proceedings were systematically undertaken by special Commissioners between the years 1830 and 1850, when some thousands of estates were added to the revenue-roll. The revenue-free estates are those which escaped resumption during these proceedings, and their number has been swelled by redemption of the land revenue, which is permitted in the case of very petty estates. The rent-free holdings are small areas which were assigned in former times by zamindars for religious or charitable purposes.\n\nThe land revenue is realized with remarkable punctuality. In 1903-4 no less than 97.8 per cent. of the current demand was realized within the year, the percentages in the three classes of permanently settled, temporarily settled, and directly managed estates being 98.9, 96.7, and 89.3 respectively. The revenue of estates belonging to the first two classes is realized under the Sale Law, which renders an estate liable to summary auction sale if the revenue is not paid in full by a fixed date. The revenue is payable by instalments which have been fixed for each District with reference to the date of the harvests, so that the instalments may be paid from the sale proceeds of the surplus produce. Arrears of rent in estates under direct management are recovered under the 'certificate procedure': in case of default the Collector certifies the amount due, and his certificate has the force and effect of a decree of court, and is executed accordingly.\n\nIn early Mughal times the only zamindars recognized were the territorial chiefs, who were left in possession on grounds of policy, on condition that they agreed to pay into the imperial treasury a certain proportion of the revenue collected from their villages; with this exception, the ordinary revenue system was to collect a share of the produce direct from the cultivators through their headmen. With the\ndecay of the Mughal power, however, the practice of farming the revenues grew up, and the ex-officials, court favourites, and men of local influence who undertook to farm the revenues gradually acquired the name and position of zam\u012bnd\u0101rs.\n\nOriginally the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs paid into the treasury the whole amount collected by them from the cultivators, less a definite allowance for maintenance, for collection charges and the up-keep of accounts, and for expenditure on charity. Gradually, however, the contributions to the treasury tended to become fixed, though always liable to enhancement, and meanwhile the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs exploited new sources of income over and above the rental upon which their revenue was calculated. They acquired private lands, realized rent from the cultivators of waste lands, imposed cesses or additions to the rent rates, and levied dues on fisheries and tolls on markets. By degrees also the zam\u012bnd\u0101r's office became hereditary, and the practice of obtaining a fresh grant or authority to succeed from the ruling power dropped into desuetude.\n\nDuring the two centuries which followed Todar Mal's settlement, the farmer class of zam\u012bnd\u0101rs had acquired a position similar to that of the original landholders of the Province, and they were recognized as proprietors of the soil by Lord Cornwallis, who was 'persuaded that nothing could be so ruinous to the public interest as that the land should be retained as the property of Government.' This bias was shared by the Directors in 1792, and they were 'for establishing real, permanent, valuable rights in our Provinces, and for conferring such rights upon the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs.' The proprietary title of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs was therefore not questioned at the time of the Permanent Settlement; and the Regulation which gave it the force of law prescribed that the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, with whom the Decennial Settlement had been made, and their heirs and lawful successors, should be allowed to hold their estates at the same assessment for ever. The right of transfer of their estates was also conferred upon them. The present right of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, therefore, is freely heritable and alienable. It is, however, limited by the rights of their tenure-holders and ryots, and also by the Government prerogative to sell the estate in default of full payment of revenue on the due date.\n\nThere are two main classes of tenants\u2014tenure-holders and ryots. It is often difficult to distinguish between the two classes in individual cases, but broadly a tenure is an intermediate interest between the zam\u012bnd\u0101r and the cultivating ryot. For practical purposes the essential difference between a tenure-holder and a ryot is that the former can sublet to an under-tenure-holder or to a ryot, while the sub-tenant of a ryot must necessarily hold the inferior status of an under-ryot. The distinction is of importance, because a sub-lease to an under-tenure-holder or ryot commands a bonus, which is not ordinarily the\ncase with a sub-lease to an under-ryot; but, on the other hand, the position of a settled ryot, who holds an occupancy right in all lands held or acquired by him in a village, is much coveted by the tenure-holder, whose rights are more restricted.\n\nTenures are distinguishable into four classes according to their origin. Many ancient tenures existed before the creation of the zam\u012bnd\u0101ris to which they are now subordinate. At the time of the Permanent Settlement, many of these tenures, known as taluks, were separated from the zam\u012bnd\u0101ris, and formed into distinct estates, paying revenue direct to Government. A large number of the smaller tenures, however, remained subordinate to the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs. A second class of tenures was created by the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, with a view to protect their property from the ruin which involved so many estates immediately after the Permanent Settlement. The patni taluk, which originated in Burdw\u0101n and has since spread over other parts of Bengal, is an estate within an estate, the rent being fixed in perpetuity and the tenure being saleable by the Collector at the zam\u012bnd\u0101r's instance for arrears, precisely in the same way as the parent estate. In some parts the process of sub-infeudation has proceeded much farther; the patnid\u0101r has given his lands in permanent lease to dar-patnid\u0101rs, and the dar-patnid\u0101rs have done the same to s\u012b-patnid\u0101rs.\n\nThe reclaiming tenure is a bait which tempts the petty capitalist to spend his resources on the land. It is found all along the coast, where the low mud flats are being gradually raised by deposits of silt. The great rivers discharge into the Bay of Bengal an immense mass of sand, clay, and vegetable d\u00e9bris, which is again carried inland by the action of the tide. The coast-line is ever encroaching on the Bay, and as the deposits rise above water-level they become clothed with mangrove jungle, and if left to themselves would in time rise to high spring-tide level. But the impatience of the reclamer forestalls this natural process, and soon after the surface emerges, an earthen embankment is thrown round it to exclude the salt tidal water, and the newly-formed islet is cultivated. The natural growth of the surface is thus arrested, and the deposit of silt is confined to the beds of the tidal channels, which gradually rise until they threaten to overwhelm the new reclamation. Perpetual leases at low rents are needed to persuade the capitalist to undertake the heavy initial and recurring expenditure required for the protection of such reclamations, and similar leases are often granted in the case of waste land when heavy expenditure has to be incurred in felling dense forests and undergrowth.\n\nThere is a fourth class of tenures, which is probably the most numerous of all, and which may be described as the land-jobbing tenure. This class is to be distinguished from the reclamation leases described above, though the nomenclature is generally the same. It is found in\nenormous numbers in Backergunge* District, where, probably owing to the depredations of Arakanese raiders in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, reclamation in the coast tract was arrested until the surface had risen above flood-level, and where comparatively small expenditure on embankments is required. The profits of agriculture are very great in this District, as plentiful crops are reaped which find a good market in Calcutta, and the rich soil, which is periodically fertilized by silt deposits from the overflow of the great rivers, requires no manure. The price of rice is also steadily rising, owing to the rapid growth of population, the extension of non-food-crops, such as jute, and the inflation of the currency caused by the export of jute from East Bengal. The profits of agriculture are therefore steadily increasing, while at the same time the practice of granting perpetual leases has stereotyped rent rates. The cultivator is not, however, allowed to absorb the whole of the increase in agricultural profits, but is compelled to disgorge a portion of it in the shape of abraubs, or cesses proportionate to his rental, and each new cess affords subsistence to a land-jobbing tenure-holder. The ryot, moreover, ekes out his income by subletting at rack-rates to under-ryots, and the rents paid by the latter are perpetually rising.\n\nThe system may best be illustrated by taking the simplest case of a zamindar who has given a perpetual lease to a ryot. The ryot grows rich, and the zamindar is in need of money: he offers the lease of a tenure of his holding to the ryot at a reduced rent, upon payment of a bonus equivalent to twenty years' purchase of the difference between the two rents. If the ryot refuses, a third person is offered the tenure, and he probably squeezes a cess out of the ryot. The same process is repeated shortly afterwards, either by the zamindar, who may create a tenure between himself and the new tenure-holder, or by the latter, who creates an under-tenure between himself and the ryot. The creation of each new tenure is the occasion for the payment of a substantial bonus, for which the lessee recoups himself by extracting a cess from the man below him, which is ultimately passed on to the ryot.\n\nTenures of the classes described above are usually hereditary and held at fixed rates of rent. Temporary farming leases are common in Bih\u0101r and on Government estates; they are granted for a short term, either at a fixed rent or a percentage of the rental of the farm.\n\nThe status and privileges of all classes of tenants have been secured by the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885. When Lord Cornwallis settled the revenue of the zamindars in perpetuity in 1793, he apparently intended to confer upon the ryots a similar immunity against enhancement of their rents, and power was reserved to legislate in future, if necessary, for the protection and welfare of the tenantry. The matter was, however, lost sight of for half a century. The terms at which the\nDecennial Settlement had been concluded were severe at the time, while the proprietors were unaccustomed to the punctual payments necessary to protect their estates from sale. The consequence was that many proprietors defaulted and their estates were sold, and the attention of Government was for twenty years concentrated on efforts to realize the revenue with punctuality. The zam\u012bnd\u0101rs complained of the difficulty they experienced in collecting rents punctually from their tenants, and in 1799 special powers were given them to seize the person of a defaulting ryot and to distrain on his crops summarily. These powers were grossly abused and led to much oppression, but it was not until 1859 that a remedy was found. Act X of that year conferred on the ryots a right of occupancy in lands cultivated by them for twelve years, and protected occupancy ryots from enhancement of rent except on certain specified grounds; the landlord's power of distrainment was also restricted. This Act failed, however, to give the needed protection to the tenantry; and after prolonged discussion a new Tenancy Act was passed in 1885, which provided that every ryot who has held any land in a village for twelve years acquires thereby a right of occupancy in all the land he may hold in the village. The result is that a proportion of all the ryots in the Province, varying from four-fifths to nine-tenths, have occupancy rights in their lands. In the case of such ryots, enhancement by contract is limited to an addition once in fifteen years of one-eighth to the previous rent, and a civil court can enhance the rent only on certain specified grounds, and even then only once in fifteen years. Whether such holdings are transferable or not depends on local custom. A small number of ryots hold at fixed rates of rent, and the remainder are without a right of occupancy. Even the latter, however, cannot be ejected except in execution of the decree of a competent court, nor can their rents be enhanced at shorter intervals than five years.\n\nProduce rents are to be found all over the Province, and are especially common in South Bih\u0101r, where landlords maintain irrigation works or embankments. Sometimes the value of the standing crop is estimated, and the share to be paid as rent is fixed accordingly; sometimes the grain is divided on the threshing-floor. The landlord generally takes about half the crop, exclusive of the straw.\n\nNo attempt has yet been made to check the transfer of land by ryots, except in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, the Sant\u0101l Parganas, Angul, and the K\u0101limpong Government estate, where transfers to non-agriculturists, or, in some cases, to any outsider, are forbidden, and where the prohibition is strictly enforced at the time of settlement of the rents.\n\nIn the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885 power was taken by Government to order a survey and record-of-rights in any local area; such operations have since been completed in the four North Bih\u0101r Districts of S\u0101ran, Champ\u0101ran, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhanga, and are in progress in\nportions of Monghyr, Bhagalpur, and Purnea Districts, and in Ranchi and Backergunge*. The object of these operations is to frame an authoritative record of the status and rents of the tenantry, with a view either to protect them against arbitrary eviction and illegal enhancement, or to compose or avert agrarian disputes. Similar operations have been conducted on a large scale in estates under the administration of the Court of Wards, with a view to preparing correct rent-rolls, and also in a number of estates upon the application of the proprietors.\n\nThe land revenue in Bengal is so small a fraction of the produce that it can have no bearing on the ability of the people to withstand famine. The produce may be valued at not less than Rs. 20 per acre, or 9796 lakhs for the Province as a whole, of which the total cropped area was estimated at 76,454 square miles in 1903-4. The rental of 1670 lakhs, therefore, represents 17 per cent., and the revenue of 400 lakhs only about 4 per cent. of the value of the produce. Remissions and suspensions of the revenue are very rarely granted in permanently settled estates, as the incidence of the revenue is so light that they are unnecessary. In temporarily settled and Government estates, however, remissions are allowed for special reasons, among which are deterioration of land, drought, and damage caused by floods and cyclones.\n\nThe production of opium in Bengal and the United Provinces is a Government monopoly, and the administration of the operations is in the hands of the Board of Revenue, Bengal, under whom are two Agents, stationed at Patna and Ghazipur respectively, and a subordinate staff of sub-deputy and assistant opium agents. The poppy is grown in ten Districts in Bengal and in thirty-six Districts of the United Provinces. The total area under cultivation (deducting failures) averaged 823 square miles during the ten years ending 1890, and 820 square miles in the subsequent decade. In 1900-1 it was 948 square miles, of which 345 square miles were in Bengal and 603 square miles in the United Provinces; and in 1903-4 it was 1,004 square miles, of which 324 square miles were in Bengal and 680 in the United Provinces. The process of manufacture is carried on in factories at the head-quarters of each Agency. The legal position is governed by the provisions of Acts XIII of 1857 and I of 1878.\n\nThe cultivation of the poppy is permitted only under annual licences granted for the purpose; sowing is restricted to the area applied for, and the whole of the produce must be sold to Government at a fixed rate, which for some years has been Rs. 6 per seer (2 lb.) of 70\u00b0 consistency. Advances free of interest are given to the cultivators, whose accounts are adjusted after the opium has been taken over. Application for a licence is entirely optional.\n\nThe opium is manufactured in two forms: 'provision opium' for\nexport principally to China and the Straits Settlements, and 'excise opium' for consumption in India. The difference lies in the consistency and size of the cakes and the method of packing. 'Provision opium' is dispatched to the warehouses of the Board of Revenue in Calcutta, where it is sold at public auction, the number of chests to be offered for sale during the year being fixed by the Government of India, with reference to the quantity manufactured and the stock held in reserve. During the period 1881-90, a yearly average of 54,664 chests (each containing 40 cakes weighing about 140 lb.) was exported from Calcutta, and 43,164 chests during the succeeding decade. In 1900-1 47,950 chests, and in 1903-4 48,218 chests, were shipped, and the normal sale standard is now 48,000 chests per annum. The gross value of the chests sold averaged about $6\\frac{1}{2}$ crores between the years 1881 and 1890, and a little over 5 crores between 1891 and 1900. In 1900-1 it amounted to about $6\\frac{1}{2}$ crores, and in 1903-4 to just over 7 crores. 'Excise opium' is supplied to all Government treasuries for sale to licensed vendors. The price, which is fixed by Government, varies in different parts of the Province. At the present time it ranges from Rs. 28 to Rs. 31 per seer in Bengal proper; in Orissa it is Rs. 33; and in the Patna Division, where the danger of smuggling is greatest, it is only Rs. 17 per seer. With the retail sale of the drug to the actual consumers the Opium department has no concern; this is under the control of the Commissioner of Excise, as described farther on.\n\nThe net yearly revenue of the Opium department averaged $4\\frac{1}{4}$ crores from 1881 to 1890; from 1891 to 1900 it was a little over 3 crores; in 1901 it amounted to about 4 crores, and in 1903 to 3.98 crores. The revenue varies from year to year according to the quantity of opium available for sale and the price realized for it. A standard quantity to be produced yearly is periodically fixed by Government, and the maximum area to be cultivated is calculated accordingly; but the area actually under poppy depends also on the willingness of the cultivator to grow it. The crop, though on the average a remunerative one, is very sensitive to climatic conditions, and a series of unfavourable years may create a prejudice against it. The amount realized by the sale of 'provision opium' depends partly on the quantity offered for sale, and partly on the nature of the season in China and the area under cultivation there. Differences in the rate of exchange between the two countries may have a disturbing influence upon the market, and the interest charged by the Calcutta banks also affects it.\n\nThe administration of excise, including the retail sale of opium, is vested in the Excise Commissioner, subject to the general control of the Board of Revenue. In the Districts the Collector is in charge, assisted by a Deputy-Collector (who is, in the more important Districts, a special officer) with a clerical, preventive, and, where Government\ndistilleries have been established, a distillery staff. The revenue is derived from imported liquors; country spirits, including country rum; fermented liquors made in India, including beer, *tari* (fermented date juice), and *pachwai* (rice beer); hemp drugs, including *ganja*, *siddhi* or *bhang*, *charas*, and *m\u0101jum*; opium; and cocaine. The revenue is derived from (a) the duty levied on excisable articles passing into consumption, other than imported liquors the duty on which is credited to the Customs revenue, (b) the fees paid for a licence to manufacture and sell excisable articles, and (c) the fees paid on spirits manufactured in distilleries.\n\nThe following figures show the excise revenue\\(^1\\) for the decades 1881\u201390 and 1891\u20131900 (averages), and for the years 1900\u20131 and 1903\u20134, in thousands of rupees:\n\n| Heads of revenue | 1881\u201390 | 1891\u20131900 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|------------------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Imported liquors | Rs. 2,07 | Rs. 2,67 | Rs. 3,30 | Rs. 3,77 |\n| Country spirits manufactured after the native method | Rs. 48,05 | Rs. 55,36 | Rs. 67,67 | Rs. 79,03 |\n| Country spirits, including country rum, manufactured after the English method, and beer | Rs. 1,01 | Rs. 3,58 | Rs. 3,48 | Rs. 2,34 |\n| *Tari* | Rs. 7,00 | Rs. 9,89 | Rs. 10,39 | Rs. 10,96 |\n| *Pachwai* | Rs. 1,82 | Rs. 3,83 | Rs. 5,34 | Rs. 5,98 |\n| Hemp drugs | Rs. 20,26 | Rs. 26,26 | Rs. 30,20 | Rs. 34,55 |\n| Opium | Rs. 19,85 | Rs. 23,09 | Rs. 25,91 | Rs. 25,92 |\n| Miscellaneous | Rs. 7 | Rs. 14 | Rs. 19 | Rs. 41 |\n| **Total excise revenue** | Rs. 1,00,13 | Rs. 1,24,82 | Rs. 1,46,48 | Rs. 1,62,96 |\n| Customs revenue from imported liquors | Rs. 14,20 | Rs. 18,49 | Rs. 20,99 | Rs. 22,32 |\n\nThe causes leading to this rapid expansion have been indicated in the section on Finance. The incidence of excise revenue per head of the population was \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\) annas in 1881\u20132, \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) annas in 1891\u20132, \\(3\\frac{1}{6}\\) annas in 1901\u20132, and \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\) annas in 1903\u20134.\n\nCountry spirits and *tari* are preferred in the dry Districts, such as those of Bih\u0101r and Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur, with pronounced hot and cold seasons, and containing a large non-Muhammadan population. The aboriginal tribes brew *pachwai* at home, but consume the stronger spirit when it is within their means. The consumption of *ganja* is very general; it is greatest in wet and malarious Districts, such as those of Bengal proper and part of the Bh\u0101galpur Division. Opium is also in general use, but chiefly in the Districts lying on the seaboard and where the Muhammadan population is large.\n\nThe consumption of excisable articles is closely watched, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The excise revenue in Bengal as now constituted was Rs. 1,42,13,000 in 1904\u20135.\nfacilities for obtaining them are allowed only in order to meet an ascertained demand, or for the prevention of illicit practices. The number of licences issued is carefully considered, and the sites for licensed shops are selected with due regard to local feeling. The fees for a licence are ordinarily settled by auction, subject to a minimum which is fixed with reference to the estimated sales at each shop and the average fees previously paid for the licence. Educated opinion is opposed to the use of stimulants, and the general feeling of the people condemns over-indulgence. The consumption has, however, increased rapidly among the educated classes, who, next to Europeans, are the chief purchasers of imported liquors, and especially of the cheap brands manufactured from German spirit and sold, under English names, in bottles with attractive labels. These brands compete with the country-made spirit in cheapness, and are believed to be stronger.\n\nThe revenue on salt is levied mainly in the shape of an import duty\u2014formerly Rs. $2\\frac{1}{2}$, reduced in 1903 to Rs. 2, in 1905 to Rs. 1\u20138, and in 1907 to R. 1 per maund of 82 lb.\u2014which is realized by the Customs authorities. There are also certain miscellaneous receipts, of which the most important are the rents paid for the storage of salt in Government warehouses and the fees realized upon the passes granted for its removal. The Bengal coast is unsuitable for the local manufacture of salt, by reason of the dampness of the climate and the large amount of fresh water discharged into the Bay of Bengal by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and the manufacture of salt in the Province has been discontinued since 1898 and is now forbidden. The quantity annually manufactured by Government and private individuals during the ten years 1881\u201390 averaged about 280,000 maunds, and during the succeeding seven years about 120,000 maunds. The quantity imported yearly from within India and from other countries during the periods 1881\u201390 and 1891\u20131900 averaged 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and 10 million maunds respectively. In 1900\u20131 it was about 9 million maunds, and in 1901\u20132 about 13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) million maunds. The average consumption of salt per head of the population during each of the four years 1880\u20131, 1890\u20131, 1900\u20131, and 1903\u20134 was 5\\(\\frac{3}{6}\\), 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), 5\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\), and 5\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) seers respectively. The gross revenue from this source, exclusive of miscellaneous receipts, averaged 2\u00b718 crores between the years 1881 and 1890, and 2\u00b759 crores between 1891 and 1900, while in 1900\u20131 it amounted to 2\u00b766 crores, and in 1903\u20134 to 2\u00b727 crores.\n\nThe course of the salt trade has been greatly influenced by the substitution of steamships for sailing vessels and by the improvement in the means of communication in India. The former circumstance has given a great impetus to the practice of bonding salt, as steamers are unable to waste time in port. The opening of the East Coast Railway encouraged the importation of Madras salt into Orissa, and it\nis now acquiring a firm hold of the markets there. At the present time the United Kingdom supplies about half the salt imported by sea, Aden and the Red Sea ports about 31 per cent., Germany approximately 10 per cent., while the remainder comes from the Persian Gulf, Port Said, and Madagascar. The quantity supplied from the United Kingdom is declining, owing to competition from other sources, and especially from the Red Sea ports. Preventive establishments are employed to cope with the illicit manufacture of salt along the coast and in other saliferous areas, and the possession and transport of salt are regulated by a system of passes.\n\nThe stamp revenue is collected under the Indian Stamp Act (II of 1899) and the Court Fees Act (VII of 1870). Stamps are broadly divided into 'non-judicial,' or revenue stamps, and 'court-fee,' or judicial stamps. Of non-judicial stamps there are two main classes, adhesive and impressed. Adhesive stamps include share transfer stamps, foreign bill stamps, and stamps for use by notaries, advocates, r\u0101k\u012bs, and attorneys. Impressed stamps comprise impressed stamp paper and impressed labels, and forms of different descriptions, such as skeleton cheques, &c. For the distribution of stamps a central d\u00e9p\u00f4t is maintained at Calcutta, while every treasury is a local, and every sub-treasury a branch d\u00e9p\u00f4t. There are, in addition, numerous licensed vendors, who are allowed a discount on the stamps purchased by them. The net revenue derived from the sale of judicial stamps\\(^1\\) during the decades 1881\u201390 and 1891\u20131900 averaged 93 and 117 lakhs respectively; in 1900\u20131 it was 131 lakhs, and in 1903\u20134 it was 143 lakhs. The revenue from non-judicial stamps\\(^1\\) during the same four periods amounted to 34, 44, 49, and 50 lakhs respectively.\n\nThe growth of litigation mainly accounts for the progressive increase in the sale of judicial stamps, but probate duty also shows a tendency to yield larger receipts. The revenue derived from non-judicial stamps develops along with the normal progress of the country, but in particular years the state of the harvests causes fluctuations.\n\nIncome-tax is levied on non-agricultural incomes under the provisions of Act II of 1886 as recently amended (see Vol. IV, chap. viii). The minimum income assessable under the original Act was Rs. 500, but this has now been raised to Rs. 1,000 per annum, upon which, and up to Rs. 2,000 a year, the tax is levied at the rate of 4 pies in the rupee. On larger incomes the rate is 5 pies in the rupee.\n\nThe assessment and collection of the tax outside Calcutta are subject to the control of the Collector, under the supervision of the Commissioner and the Board of Revenue; but the actual administration of the Act is in the hands of a Deputy-Collector, who is usually\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1904\u20135 the net receipts from the sale of judicial stamps in Bengal as now constituted was 94.38 lakhs, and from the sale of non-judicial stamps 34.49 lakhs.\nin charge of excise duties also. For Calcutta, which, with the town of Howrah, constitutes a separate District for income-tax purposes, there is a special Collector of Income-tax. Since the enhancement of the minimum taxable income, assessors are appointed to Divisions, and the work of assessment in the different Districts in each Division is distributed among them by the Commissioner in consultation with the District officers. The rates of pay of the assessors are Rs. 100, Rs. 90, and Rs. 80 a month. In Calcutta seven assessors are employed, who belong to two grades with pay of Rs. 250 and Rs. 200 respectively.\n\nThe net revenue derived from the tax on incomes during the five years 1886-90 averaged 37.5 lakhs. During the next ten years it averaged 45.7 lakhs, and in 1901 it amounted to 54.4 lakhs; in 1902-3 it was 56.5 lakhs, but in 1903-4 (after the increase of the minimum assessable income) it fell to 47.7 lakhs. The incidence of the tax per head of the population during the same five periods averaged 0.06, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.06 of a rupee, while the average number of assesseees was 109,000, 119,000, 134,000, 135,000, and 56,000, or 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.8, and 0.8 per 1,000 of the population respectively.\n\nThe work of the Calcutta Custom House is directed by a Collector of Customs, who is subject to the control of the Board of Revenue as the chief Customs authority, and is assisted by five Assistant Collectors. The examination of goods and their valuation for customs purposes are entrusted to a staff of eighteen appraisers, while the guarding of vessels and patrolling of the port in order to prevent smuggling, the control over the discharge of cargo, and the loading or unloading of salt at the gol\u0101s (warehouses) rest with a special establishment of about 205 officers under the orders of the Superintendent of the Preventive Service and Salt department.\n\nInformation as to the tariff is given in Vol. IV, chap. viii, and it will suffice to state here that the ordinary import duty is 5 per cent., either ad valorem or on a tariff valuation. The most important exceptions are cotton piece-goods, assessed at 3\u00bd per cent.; iron and steel, at 1 per cent.; petroleum below a certain flashing point, at 1 anna per imperial gallon; and machinery, railway material, and raw cotton, which are free. The duty on salt has varied; it was reduced from Rs. 2\u201314 to Rs. 2 per maund in 1882, but was again raised to Rs. 2\u20138 per maund in 1888, at which figure it continued till March, 1903, when it was again reduced to Rs. 2 per maund. It has recently (1907) been still further reduced to R. 1 per maund. A duty was first imposed on kerosene oil in 1888; and in 1899 countervailing duties were placed upon bounty-fed sugar.\n\nThe total customs revenue in Bengal averaged 247 lakhs during the period 1881-90, and 352 lakhs during the following decade. In\n\n---\n\n1 The revenue from the income-tax in Bengal as now constituted was 41.83 lakhs in 1904-5.\nit amounted to 427 lakhs\\(^1\\), and in 1903-4 to 384 lakhs. Excluding the receipts from salt and rice, the import duties in 1903-4 yielded 150 lakhs, to which cotton-goods contributed 51 lakhs, mineral oils 18 lakhs, metals 16 lakhs, and sugar (inclusive of countervailing duties) 9 lakhs. The only export duty is that on rice, which realized 18 lakhs in 1880-1, nearly 22 lakhs in 1900-1, and 19 lakhs in 1903-4.\n\nIn discussing the rise and present position of local institutions it is necessary to distinguish between town and country. In towns the need for proper roads, water-supply, and sanitary arrangements is far greater than in rural tracts, while, as their area is limited, it is comparatively easy for the representatives of the people to deal with these matters. The inhabitants of towns are also more advanced and better able to express their requirements than those of the scattered villages in the interior. It follows that the first steps in the direction of delegating to the natives of the country a share in the administration of public affairs were taken in towns, and in this, as in other matters, Calcutta naturally led the way.\n\nOutside towns the rise of local self-government in Bengal dates from 1870, when District committees were created for the administration of the funds set apart for the construction, repair, and maintenance of roads, bridges, &c., which were derived mainly from the road cess. They consisted of the District Magistrate and other officers of the District staff, and of a certain number of payers of road cess appointed on the nomination of the local authorities. District school committees, consisting partly of officials and partly of private persons nominated as above, were at the same time formed for the control of education, and were made responsible for the supervision of all Government schools and the allotment of the sums set aside for grants-in-aid of private schools. Owing partly to the constitution of the committees, and partly to the fact that the powers delegated to them were very circumscribed, these measures were not attended with much success, and local self-government in the Districts was for some years little more than a name.\n\nAt the instance of Lord Mayo, a fresh scheme was drawn up by Sir Ashley Eden, the Lieutenant-Governor, with the threefold object of relieving the Provincial authorities of some portion of the ever-growing details of the work of administration, of reconciling the public to the burden of local taxation, and of conferring on the people or their representatives greater powers of control over expenditure on objects of local importance. This scheme was the foundation of the Local Self-Government Act, III (B.C.) of 1885, which is still in force.\n\n\\(^1\\) These figures exclude collections in inland treasuries on bonded salt. The receipts on their account averaged 8 lakhs a year between 1895 and 1900, and in 1900-1 and in 1903-4 amounted to 26 lakhs.\nThis Act provides for the constitution of three classes of local authorities\u2014the District board with jurisdiction over the whole District, a local board for each subdivision, and Union committees for smaller areas where circumstances may indicate the desirability of appointing them. The District board is the principal local authority, and the local boards and Union committees work in subordination to it, exercising such powers and administering such funds as the District board may direct. District boards have been constituted throughout Bengal, save only in Darjeeling and a few remote tracts; local boards have also been formed in most Districts. On March 31, 1904, there were 42 District boards and 104 local boards in Bengal. The system of village Unions has not yet been fully developed, and only 58 have been created, chiefly in the Burdwan and Presidency Divisions. Half the members of District boards are appointed by Government and half are elected by local boards; where there are no local boards, the District board consists entirely of members appointed by Government. On March 31, 1904, the 42 District boards contained in all 846 members. Of these 221 were members ex officio, 292 were appointed by Government, and 333 were elected by the local boards. The Collector of the District has in all cases been appointed chairman. The area dealt with by each board is so large, and the interests of different parts of it are so divergent, that no non-official member would be able to perform effectively the executive duties of the post or to weigh impartially the conflicting claims of different localities. The members of local boards are appointed partly by nomination and partly by election, one or more members being elected for each thana. All residents who possess a small property qualification are entitled to vote, but the number who actually do vote is usually very small. Similar rules have been framed for the constitution of Union committees.\n\nThe District boards have full control over all roads and bridges, save on a few main lines of communication of more than local importance. They are also entrusted with the maintenance and supervision of all primary and middle schools, the management of pounds and most of the public ferries, the control over and upkeep of dispensaries, the provision of a proper water-supply, village sanitation, &c. When scarcity occurs, it becomes their duty to subordinate all other objects to the special consideration of saving life, and they are expected to devote their whole available resources to affording relief. If the scarcity is not serious or widespread, the District board is left to cope with it, with\n\n---\n\n1 The number of District boards in Bengal after the recent territorial changes was 29 and of local boards 76.\n2 The number of members of District boards in Bengal as now constituted was 580 in 1904, of whom 148 were members ex officio, 188 were appointed by Government, and 244 were elected.\nsuch financial assistance as may seem to be needed; but when famine supervenes, the management of relief operations is taken over by Government. The immediate administration of the roads and buildings under the control of the District board is vested in the District Engineer, who is appointed and paid by the board, while that of the schools subordinate to it lies with the Deputy-Inspector of schools, an officer of the Educational department, who, in respect of these schools, works in subordination to the board.\n\nThe chief functions hitherto delegated to local boards are the care and maintenance of village roads, the management of pounds, and the charge of ferries. In a large number of cases they have also been entrusted with powers of varying extent with regard to primary education, and in a few cases with the control of dispensaries and the maintenance of District roads. As at present constituted, local boards have not been a very great success, and several of those at the head-quarters of Districts have recently been abolished.\n\nThe Union committees exercise control over pounds, village roads, sanitation, and water-supply. In regard to primary schools, their authority is restricted to inspection. Their income consists of the receipts from pounds situated within the Union, a lump sum granted by the District board for village roads, sanitation, and water-supply, and funds raised under section 118 of the Act. In some Districts these committees are reported to have done useful work within the narrow limits of their powers and resources.\n\nNearly 53 per cent. of the income of District boards is derived from the road cess levied on land, under the provisions of Act IX (B.C.) of 1880. A considerable sum is also derived from pounds and ferries and special grants made by Government. The main heads of expenditure are public works (59 per cent. of the total), education (22 per cent.), medical (5 per cent.), and general administration (4 per cent.). Statistics of income and expenditure are given in Table XI at the end of this article (p. 355). The duties of the boards tend to outgrow their income, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to spare money for the construction of feeder-roads to railways and other new works. Government has therefore recently helped to restore the equilibrium by assigning to the Commissioner of each Division a considerable sum to be allotted by him to the boards which stand most in need of assistance. The total of the special grants thus made amounted to 15 lakhs on April 1, 1904; and in 1905 a further grant of 12\u00bd lakhs was made from Imperial funds to the District boards.\n\nThe history of municipal government in Calcutta is dealt with in the article on that city. The first enactment having for its object the creation of local bodies elsewhere was Act XXVI of 1850, which authorized the Lieutenant-Governor, on the application of the inhabitants of\nany place of public resort or residence, to extend the Act to it and to appoint commissioners who, by the levy of a rate on houses or of town duties or otherwise, were to make better provision for purposes of public health or convenience. The Darjeeling municipality was constituted in 1850 under the provisions of this Act; but otherwise very little advantage was taken of it or of a subsequent Act (XX of 1856), the main object of which was to make better provision for the appointment of police chaukidars in towns, but which also provided that any surplus funds raised in a town, primarily for the above purpose, might be applied to cleansing or lighting or otherwise improving it. These two Acts were superseded in the larger towns by Act VI of 1868, which repeated their provisions in a modified form. The first real attempt at inaugurating municipal government was made in 1864, when the District Municipal Improvement Act was passed. This Act authorized the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint municipal commissioners for any town to which it was extended, with power to levy certain rates and taxes to meet the cost of conservancy, general improvement, and police.\n\nThe enactments were consolidated and amended by Act V (B.C.) of 1876, in which year there were in existence 24 municipalities under Act III of 1864 and 2 under Act XXVI of 1850, 70 'unions' under Act XX of 1856, and 95 'towns' under Act VI of 1868. The new Act recognized four classes of municipal institutions: namely, first and second-class municipalities, 'unions,' and stations. The elective principle was allowed in the case of municipalities, provided that one-third of the ratepayers desired it; but this condition was fulfilled in respect of only three municipalities. The Magistrate of the District or of the subdivision, as the case might be, was as a rule ex-officio chairman of all municipalities situated within his jurisdiction; power was given to the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint other persons, but it was exercised only in a single case.\n\nThis Act was, in its turn, superseded by Act III (B.C.) of 1884, which is still in operation, and which provides for the election of a majority of the commissioners and gives to them a far greater degree of independence. By this Act the distinction between first and second-class municipalities was abolished, and the other corporate bodies known as 'unions' and 'stations' were extinguished. Under its provisions the ratepayers of 125 municipalities, out of a total of 161, have obtained the privilege of electing two-thirds of their commissioners, and in 109 cases the latter have been empowered to choose their own chairman. In the remaining towns, which are either very backward or are divided by contending interests or strong party feeling, Government has reserved to itself the power of appointing the commissioners or the chairman, but in only twenty-seven municipalities does it appoint both. Except in Howrah, the municipalities have been relieved of the charges on\naccount of the local police, over which they exercised practically no control, on the understanding that the funds thus set free must be spent on works of general utility and may on no account be devoted to the reduction of taxation. The charges previously borne by Government on account of dispensaries and hospitals within municipal limits have at the same time been transferred to these bodies. The municipal law has now been extended to all places of an urban character, where alone it can be satisfactorily worked.\n\nAct III of 1884 has been amended by Acts IV (B.C.) of 1894 and II (B.C.) of 1896. By these enactments the elective principle has been further developed, and the powers and responsibilities of the municipal commissioners have been enhanced. The scope of municipal expenditure has been extended, and now includes the establishment and maintenance of veterinary institutions and the training of the requisite staff, the improvement of breeds of cattle, the training and employment of female medical practitioners, the promotion of physical culture, and the establishment and maintenance of free libraries. The commissioners may order a survey and organize a fire brigade; they may control the water-supply when its purity is suspected, even to the extent of interference with private rights; larger powers of precaution are conferred in the case of ruined and dangerous houses and other erections, as well as increased powers for the general regulation of new buildings.\n\nOut of the total number of municipalities\u00b9 in existence on March 31, 1904 (excluding Calcutta), only two, Howrah and Patna, contained over 100,000 inhabitants; 98 contained from 10,000 to 100,000, and in 61 there were less than 10,000 inhabitants. The total population within municipal limits was 2,874,249, and the incidence of taxation per head of the population was Rs. 1-3-11. The total number of municipal commissioners was 2,236, of whom 1,160 were elected and 1,076 appointed; 336 were official members, and 1,900 non-official; 261 were Europeans and 1,975 natives. The land holding classes and members of the legal profession provide about 50 per cent. of the commissioners, and of the remainder the majority are Government servants or traders. Statistics of municipal finance are given in Table XII at the end of this article (p. 356).\n\nThere are two branches of the Public Works department, one of which is in charge of roads and buildings and miscellaneous public improvements, and the other controls irrigation, marine matters, and railways. Each branch is under\n\n\u00b9 In the present area of Bengal, there were 127 municipalities in 1904, of which 75 contained from 10,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, while 50 had less than 10,000 inhabitants. The total population within municipal limits was 2,554,180, and the incidence of taxation was Rs. 1-4 per head. The total number of municipal commissioners was 1,753, of whom 913 were elected and 745 were nominated; 249 were official and 1,504 non-official members; 231 were Europeans and 1,522 were natives.\na Chief Engineer, who is also secretary to Government. The Roads and Buildings branch administers five circles\\(^1\\), three of which are controlled by Superintending Engineers and two by Executive Engineers, who are designated Inspectors of Works, and whose duties are to inspect the work done under the Engineers employed by the District boards and to exercise professional control over their proceedings. The Imperial and Provincial buildings and roads in these circles are in charge of the District Engineers, where the District boards concerned have accepted the responsibility for their up-keep, and of the Inspectors of Works in certain Districts in which those bodies have not accepted such a responsibility. The Superintending Engineers have control of Public Works divisions held by Executive Engineers, and they also act as Inspectors of Works in their circles. The Roads and Buildings branch also includes a temporary charge, comprising the buildings connected with the Imperial Agricultural Institute at P\u016bsa, which is under the control of a superintendent of works.\n\nThe Irrigation branch comprises four circles, each of which is under a Superintending Engineer. In Irrigation circles the Executive Engineers also carry out the works of the Roads and Buildings branch within the limits of their divisions, and the Superintending Engineers act as Inspectors of Works. Three revenue divisions formed for the assessment and collection of canal water rates are held by Deputy-Collectors under the control of the Superintending Engineer of this branch. The main lines of railway and their branches are administered directly by the Government of India, the Government of Bengal controlling only a few minor railways undertaken by private enterprise.\n\nRapid progress has been made in all departments since the introduction of Provincial finance in 1871. The Northern section of the Eastern Bengal State Railway was opened in 1878. The Orissa, Midnapore, and Hijili Canals were completed in 1873, and, with the exception of the Calcutta and Eastern Canals, the entire Provincial canal system has been constructed since that date. The canalization of the Bh\u0101ngar channel in 1899 and the opening of the Madhumati Bil route in 1902 have greatly facilitated navigation by the Calcutta and Eastern Canals. As regards roads, the operations of the department are limited to the maintenance of a few trunk lines, and the initiative in the construction of new roads has been transferred to the District boards. Special efforts have, however, been directed to the improvement of communications in the Western Du\u0101rs\\(^*\\), and to the construction of feeder-roads to the railways.\n\nGreat improvements have been effected in the public buildings both\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The number of circles in Bengal, as at present constituted, is four, of which three are controlled by Superintending Engineers and one by an Executive Engineer, who is designated Inspector of Works.\nin Calcutta and in the Districts. The antiquated structures in which the courts and public offices were formerly accommodated have been replaced by more spacious edifices built with some pretensions to architectural effect. Munsifs' courts, in particular, are being gradually transformed from primitive mat-and-thatch structures into permanent buildings of brick and mortar, and educational institutions are being provided with more suitable accommodation than was formerly thought sufficient for them, while the jails are being altered to meet modern sanitary requirements and to prevent overcrowding.\n\nAmong more or less recent buildings in Calcutta may be mentioned the Imperial Secretariat, Writers' Buildings, the General Post Office, the Telegraph Office, the Surveyor-General's Offices, the Government of India Central Press, the High Court, the Office of the Geological Survey department, and the Economic and Art Museum. Of educational buildings, the most important are the Senate House, Presidency College, Hare School, School of Art, and the additions to the Medical College. The Eden, Ezra, Sambhu N\u0101th Pandit, and Victoria Zan\u0101na Hospitals and the Leper Asylum are new, and the Presidency General Hospital has been reconstructed.\n\nMuch attention has been devoted to the preservation of antiquities at Pandua* and Gaur*, and the Kon\u0101rak temple and the Bhubaneswar temples in Puri have been protected from decay.\n\nDrainage schemes have been undertaken in Hooghly District at a cost of 26 lakhs, whereby an area of 370 square miles has been drained and cultivation rendered possible.\n\nExtensive waterworks have been constructed at Dacca*, Bhagalpur, Mymensingh*, Howrah, Burdwan, Arrah, Murshidabad, and Darjeeling; a complete drainage scheme has been carried out at Patna, and electric lighting has been introduced at Dacca* and Darjeeling.\n\nThe strength of the army stationed within the Province in June, 1903, was 7,866, British troops numbering 3,221 and Native troops 4,645. Bengal is garrisoned by the Lucknow division of the Eastern Command. The troops are distributed at eleven military stations. At Fort William in Calcutta there are British and Native infantry, British artillery, and a submarine mining company; and there are Native infantry and cavalry at Alipore. British and Native infantry and British artillery are cantoned at Barrackpore, and British and Native infantry and British artillery at Dinapore. Darjeeling with Lebong has British infantry and artillery, and a British regiment is stationed at Dum-Dum. The remaining cantonments of R\u0101nchi, Buxa, Cuttack, and Gangtok are manned by Native infantry. No recruitment takes place among Bengalis.\n\nThere is an arsenal at Fort William, a foundry and shell factory at\nCossipore, an ammunition factory at Dum-Dum, and a rifle factory at Ich\u0101pur.\n\nVolunteer corps have their head-quarters at Calcutta, Muzaffarpur, Darjeeling, R\u0101nchi, Jam\u0101lpur, Bankipore, Dacca*, and Chittagong*: and the head-quarters of the Bengal-N\u0101gpur Railway Volunteer Rifles are at Kharakpur. The following table gives the total strength of all the corps in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903:\n\n|                | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Naval          | Nil  | 280  | 200  | 307  |\n| Artillery      | Nil  | 218  | 561  | 422  |\n| Engineers      | Nil  | Nil  | 100  | 126  |\n| Light Horse or Mounted Rifles | 61   | 822  | 1,106 | 1,049 |\n| Rifles         | 2,081| 3,443| 5,376| 5,610|\n| Total          | 2,142| 4,763| 7,343| 7,514|\n\nThe Calcutta police force, of which an account will be found in the article on Calcutta, has a history of its own, and has always been independent of the police system in other parts of the Province. In the early days of British rule the Bengal zamind\u0101rs were required to keep up establishments of police for the maintenance of peace, but by Regulation XXII of 1793 this system was abolished; the police were placed under the exclusive control of Government officers, and the zamind\u0101rs were forbidden to maintain any such force\u00b9. Every District was divided into police circles, with an area of about 400 square miles, and a d\u0101roga, with a staff of subordinate officers, was appointed to each. To meet the cost of these measures, a police tax was imposed on traders and others who were specially interested in the maintenance of the force and who made no other direct contribution to the State; but this tax was abolished in 1797, when court-fees and stamp duties were introduced. The functions of the new force were at first confined to the arresting of accused persons; but in 1797 the police d\u0101rogas were directed to inquire regarding unnatural deaths, and in 1807 the Magistrate was authorized to order a police inquiry when he saw reason to distrust the truth of a complaint. From this small beginning was soon evolved the regular system of police inquiries now in vogue, which was placed on a legal footing by Regulation XX of 1817.\n\nIn 1808 Superintendents of police were appointed to certain\n\n\u00b9 In 1807 the experiment was tried of associating landholders and others with the police, and of authorizing them in certain cases to receive charges and arrest accused persons and send them to the d\u0101rogas; but it proved a failure and was abandoned in 1810.\ndivisions, where they exercised concurrent jurisdiction with the Magistrates of Districts and cities. These posts were abolished in 1829, but they were again revived in 1837. The civil police force in that year consisted of 444 d\u0101rogas, 1,353 subordinate officers, called muharris and jemad\u0101rs, and 6,699 barkand\u0101z or constables.\n\nThe whole force was reorganized and placed on its present footing by Act V of 1861. An Inspector-General of police was appointed, with complete powers of control in all departmental matters, and under him were 6 Deputy-Inspectors-General, 52 District Superintendents, 111 Assistant Superintendents, 570 inspectors, 936 sub-inspectors, 2,234 head constables, and 25,000 constables: these figures include the police in Assam, who were not separated from the Bengal police till 1871. The annual cost of the police force in Bengal rose from 36.6 lakhs in 1881 to 40.8 lakhs in 1891, to 51.7 lakhs in 1901, and to 54.9 lakhs in 1903. The composition of the force in those years is shown below:\n\n| Grade                                      | Number in |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                                            | 1881     | 1891     | 1901     | 1903     |\n| Deputy-Inspectors-General                  | 2        | 2        | 2        | 2        |\n| District and Assistant Superintendents     | 73       | 71       | 75       | 88       |\n| Inspectors                                 | 143      | 155      | 169      | 175      |\n| Sub-inspectors                             | 697      | 903      | 1,649    | 1,719    |\n| Head constables                            | 2,191    | 2,357    | 1,704    | 1,722    |\n| Constables, including municipal police     | 20,170   | 18,122   | 20,322   | 20,552   |\n\nNote.\u2014These figures are exclusive of the Calcutta force, the aggregate strength of which in 1903 was 3,323, and also of the railway and military police; they refer only to the executive force together with the reserves, both ordinary and armed.\n\n* The corresponding figures for Bengal as now constituted were:\u2014\n\n| Grade                                      | Number |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Deputy-Inspectors-General                  | 2      |\n| District and Assistant Superintendents     | 57     |\n| Inspectors                                 | 110    |\n| Sub-inspectors                             | 1,241  |\n| Head constables                            | 1,586  |\n| Constables, including municipal police     | 16,101 |\n\nThe Deputy-Inspectors-General are, in the main, inspecting officers, but they also arrange the posting of officers below the rank of Assistant Superintendent. The District Superintendents are in charge of the police of their Districts, but in all save purely departmental matters they are subordinate to the District Magistrates. Inspectors are employed chiefly on inspection, and the greater part of the investigations is conducted by sub-inspectors; much of this work was formerly done by head constables, but of late years it has, as far as possible, been taken out of their hands.\n\nThe higher grades of the police are filled on the results of a competitive examination in England and a competitive examination in\nIndia, restricted to nominated candidates, a certain number of appointments being also given by nomination to natives of the country. The competitive examination held in India is now, however, to be abolished. Inspectors are almost invariably promoted sub-inspectors, but in future a certain number are to be appointed direct. Sub-inspectors are appointed either by open competition or by nomination. As a result of the Police Commission of 1903, it has been decided that there is to be no competitive examination for the recruitment of sub-inspectors, but that they shall be, as far as possible, recruited direct, and that a maximum proportion of appointments shall be fixed for promotion from the rank of head constable. In every case they have to go through a year's training in the Bh\u0101galpur Training School, where they are taught law, the Police Manual so far as it concerns them, the reading and recording of finger-impressions, riding, and drill. Head constables are, as a rule, promoted constables. Constables are recruited at the head-quarters of each District. The percentage of foreigners (i.e., men of another District) which it is permissible to enlist varies in different Districts from 30 to 80. Constables receive some training at the head-quarters before being sent out to investigating centres, and when stationed at head-quarters they also get some instruction in drill. In future they will be trained at central schools which are now being established for the purpose.\n\nService in the police has, till very lately, been unpopular with educated natives. The appointment of the Police Commission and the hopes of an improved service have, however, of late led many well-connected natives to apply for direct appointment to sub-inspectorships.\n\nThe rural police force of chaukid\u0101rs or village watchmen is a very ancient institution, and, except in East and North Bengal, it is for the most part descended from the old Hindu village system, under which they were remunerated by small assignments of land. The village watchmen were placed under the d\u0101rogas by the Regulation of 1793 already referred to. Between 1813 and 1816 provision was made for the maintenance of chaukid\u0101rs at all Magistrates' head-quarters, who were paid monthly stipends by the residents of the towns in question; and a somewhat similar arrangement was soon afterwards introduced generally in all Districts where the indigenous system mentioned above did not exist. The powers and duties of the chaukid\u0101rs were laid down in detail in Regulation XX of 1817. In 1838 their number was estimated to be 190,000. In 1870 a new law was enacted (VI (B.C.) of 1870) detailing their duties and providing for the levy of their pay through the agency of local committees, called panch\u0101yats, who were empowered not only to fix their pay at any rate between Rs. 3 and Rs. 6 a month, but also to appoint and, if necessary, dismiss\nthem. The latter powers are now exercised by the District Magistrate; the necessary funds are still usually collected by the panchayat, but the Magistrate may, in certain cases, appoint a tahsildar for the purpose. The chaukidars are required to attend the police station at regular intervals, usually once a week, in order to report the births and deaths occurring in their beats, and to give information regarding the movements of bad characters and other matters. They are also required to give immediate notice of the occurrence of all heinous offences, and are empowered to arrest and take to the police station persons caught red-handed. In order to provide a link between the regular police and the village chaukidars, daffadars have been appointed over groups of from ten to twenty chaukidars. The rural police are not legally subordinate to the regular police, to whom they merely report. They are under the control of the District Magistrate, who can, however, delegate his powers to the District Superintendent of police. In some Districts he delegates all his powers, keeping in his own hands only the general power of control; in some Districts he delegates his powers in the head-quarters subdivision only; in others, again, he delegates powers to punish and reward within fixed limits. There are now 153,000 chaukidars, and the value of their annual emoluments is estimated at about 79 lakhs\\(^1\\). Most of them are now under Act VI (B.C.) of 1870, but about 5,000 still hold service-lands in lieu of salary; about 4,500 are under Regulation XX of 1817, and upwards of 9,000, in Chota Nagpur, are under a special Act (V (B.C.) of 1887) passed for that part of the Province.\n\nThe only criminal tribe having its head-quarters in Bengal that need be noticed is the Magahiya Doms. These are most numerous in Saran and Champaran Districts, where an attempt has been made to reclaim them by inducing them to settle down as agriculturists. Settlements have been formed on land given for the purpose by zamindars, and allowances for the purchase of seeds, &c., have been made to them by Government. Enough has been done to make it possible for them to live honestly if they choose to do so, but there has so far been no very marked improvement in their habits; their location in settlements, however, gives the local authorities some hold over them.\n\nReformatory schools are maintained at Alipore and Hazaribagh; these contained 383 boys at the end of March, 1904, the total cost to Government during the year being Rs. 58,000. Boys of the agricultural classes are sent to the Hazaribagh school, where cultivation and gardening are specially taught, while boys belonging to the industrial castes are sent to the Alipore school, where they are instructed in various industries. The kindergarten system of teaching has been\n\n\\(^1\\) The number of chaukidars in Bengal as now constituted is 106,500, and the value of their annual emoluments is estimated at nearly 49 lakhs.\nintroduced at Alipore: drill and gymnastics are included in the training at both schools, and games are played. A number of boys are provided with work outside the schools under a system of licences, and the Educational department endeavours to follow up the history of each boy for three years after his release.\n\nOn an average, 134,000 cases were reported yearly by the police between 1896 and 1901, of which 67,000 were dealt with by the criminal courts, 56,700 or 84.6 per cent. ending in conviction and the remainder in discharge or acquittal. During the same period 32,000 cases were on the average dealt with yearly by the Calcutta police, the nature of whose work is very different; of these, 29,800 were referred to the courts, and all but 950 ended in conviction.\n\nThe plan of identifying criminals by means of head measurements was introduced by Sir Edward Henry, when Inspector-General of Police; but he subsequently replaced it by the system of finger-prints, which is now in vogue everywhere. The record of finger-impressions, which in 1897 consisted of only 8,000 slips, had risen to nearly 56,000 in 1901, and to nearly 80,000 in 1903, when 1,555 men were thus identified, compared with 345 in 1898, the first complete year of working.\n\nA special reserve of from twenty to fifty constables, armed with converted Sniders (now being replaced by converted Martini-Henry carbines) under a sub-inspector, is maintained at the head-quarters of each District, and four military police companies of 100 each, armed with Martini-Henry rifles, are stationed at Dacca*, Bhagalpur, Dumk\u0101, and Hooghly. In accordance with the recommendation of the Police Commission, these reserves are to be strengthened and placed in charge of European inspectors, and all members of the force are to pass periodically through them for courses of training. A separate railway police was formed in 1867, and now comprises 2 Assistant Inspectors-General, 17 inspectors, 44 sub-inspectors, 154 head constables, and 731 native and 14 European constables.\n\nThe jails of Bengal are divided into three classes\u2014Central, District, and subsidiary. The Central jails, which are in charge of whole-time officers, are intended for the confinement of persons sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Including the Presidency Jail in Calcutta, where European convicts are incarcerated, there are now eight Central jails; in 1881 there were nine, and in 1891 seven. At the head-quarters of Districts where there is no Central jail, there is a District jail, which, except at Darjeeling, is supervised by the Civil Surgeon. Prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years are transferred to a Central jail. There are subsidiary jails at all subdivisional head-quarters for the detention of under-trial prisoners,\n\n* There are six Central jails in Bengal as now constituted.\nand of those sentenced to imprisonment for not more than fourteen days. It is proposed to detain only under-trial prisoners in these small jails as far as is practicable. Detailed statistics are given in Table XIII at the end of this article (p. 357).\n\nThe modern administration of the Jail department, which is controlled by an Inspector-General, dates from the period between 1877 and 1881, when many improvements were effected\u2014the superintending staff was strengthened, and the pay and prospects of the subordinates were improved; new jails were built, discipline was made more strict, and greater care began to be taken to see that the prisoners were properly housed, clothed, and fed, and that medical aid was promptly rendered to those in need of it. The result of these measures has been most satisfactory. In 1881 and for twenty years previously, the mortality amongst prisoners had exceeded 61 per 1,000; in the next decade it fell to 45; between 1892 and 1901 it was only 32, and in 1903 only 23.7 per 1,000. The chief jail diseases are dysentery, pneumonia, malarial fevers, and cholera. Dysentery is becoming less common: in 1903, in spite of a greatly increased jail population, the deaths from this cause numbered only 91, compared with 475 twenty years earlier. Cholera has almost ceased to be a jail disease; in 1903 there were only 24 cases and 15 deaths. Fewer deaths than formerly are now ascribed to 'fever,' but this is due in part to better diagnosis: and the same cause may also perhaps account for the reported increase in tuberculosis, which, like pneumonia, often results from overcrowding.\n\nIn the District jails the prisoners are employed on simple forms of labour, such as brick-pounding, flour-grinding, and oil-pressing; but in the Central jails special industries are carried on to meet the requirements of various Government departments. In the Presidency Jail much of the Government printing is done; at Buxar tents and cotton cloth are made; at Midnapore the prisoners work in cane, coir, and aloe fibre, and so on. The earnings aggregated nearly 6 lakhs in 1903, compared with 5\u00bd lakhs in 1881, but the provision of hard labour for the prisoners is considered of more importance than the amount earned. The expenditure is steadily rising, but this is due largely to the increased cost of food-stuffs.\n\nBengal has always contained a large number of ordinary village schools or p\u0101ths\u0101las. These were used mainly by the higher Hindu castes and gave instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but the education they afforded was very elementary: it consisted largely in learning by rote, and especially in committing elaborate arithmetical tables to memory. Br\u0101hman pandits taught Sanskrit to their disciples, who were mostly Br\u0101hmans and Baidyas, and there were also some indigenous medical schools. Muhammadan children attended maktab, or elementary schools where boys\nlearnt to recite the Kor\u0101n, and madrasas, or more advanced schools teaching Persian and Arabic. Under the Company's Charter Act of 1813 a lakh of rupees a year was allotted for expenditure on education, and in 1823 a Committee of Public Instruction was appointed. This Committee sought to encourage the learning and literature respected by the people and to foster high education as it was then understood, but no attempt was made to arrange for any general system of education.\n\nUnder Lord William Bentinck the cause of English education, which had hitherto been fostered mainly by the independent efforts of missionaries, rapidly gained ground; and in 1835 it was decided, through the influence of Macaulay, to impart instruction in the higher schools through the medium of English. The abolition in 1837 of Persian as the court language gave a great stimulus to the study of English, and about the same time the education grant was raised to 4\u00bd lakhs; a system of scholarships was created for English schools, and Bengal was divided into nine educational circles, in most of which there was a central college, while every District was provided with a school to teach both English and the vernacular.\n\nThe Committee of Public Instruction was replaced in 1842 by a Council of Education. A system of examinations and scholarships was devised, and steps were taken to obtain employment in the public service for the most successful students. Model vernacular schools were established, and arrangements were made for the periodical examination of indigenous schools. Books were lent to these schools, and money rewards, amounting to about Rs. 5,000 a year, were given to deserving teachers and pupils.\n\nThe celebrated educational Dispatch, issued by the Court of Directors in 1854, gave a great impulse to education in India, and led in Bengal to the appointment in 1855 of a Director of Public Instruction and of a certain number of inspectors and sub-inspectors of schools, and also, shortly afterwards, to the constitution of a University Committee. This was followed by the establishment of a regular department of Public Instruction. From that date the progress of education in Bengal has been rapid and sustained. Systematic inspection was introduced, the scholarship system was developed, and grants-in-aid were given to private schools and colleges. All grades of education were fostered, and a complete system of examinations was organized. Encouragement was afforded to elementary education by means of small scholarships offered to the best pupils of vernacular schools. The most advanced boys from the District schools competed every year for higher scholarships tenable in colleges. Grants-in-aid were given to 70 English and 140 vernacular schools, and the School Book and Vernacular Literature Societies were established, both of which published useful works.\n\nIn Bengal proper the colleges established prior to 1857 were fourteen\nin number, the earliest and most important being the Calcutta Madrasa, which was founded by Warren Hastings in 1781. In 1817 the Hindu College, which was subsequently merged in the Presidency College, was founded for the teaching of the English language and European science. A college was established by the Baptist missionaries at Serampore in 1818. The Sanskrit College dates from 1824, and in 1830 Dr. Duff founded the General Assembly's Institution. The schism in the Scottish Church in 1843 led to the establishment of the Free Church Institution. The Hooghly College was opened in 1836, and the Patna College in 1855-6. Besides these, there were Government colleges at Dacca*, Berhampore, Midnapore, and Krishnagar. The Doveton, La Martini\u00e8re, and St. Paul's Colleges in Calcutta were private foundations, and the Bhaw\u0101nipur College was maintained by the London Missionary Society.\n\nThe Educational department is divided into four sections: namely, the Imperial service, the Provincial service, the Subordinate service, and the Lower Subordinate service. The Imperial service consists of 31 officers appointed in England, comprising the Director of Public Instruction, Assam, the Assistant Director of Public Instruction, Bengal, 6 principals of colleges, 15 professors and 5 inspectors of schools, and 3 to fill vacancies. The post of Director of Public Instruction is not included within the Indian Educational service. The Provincial service, which is filled mainly by recruitment in India, consists of 109 officers: namely, 6 divisional inspectors of schools, 7 assistant inspectors, 7 principals of colleges, 56 professors of colleges, 23 head masters of collegiate and training schools, and 10 other officers. The Subordinate service, which includes all deputy-inspectors of schools, head masters of District schools, some assistant masters in District schools, foremen at technical institutions, &c., comprises 464 appointments. The minimum pay is Rs. 50 a month. The Lower Subordinate service consists of 1,112 persons.\n\nThe Director is the chief controlling officer of the department. Below him the chief executive officers are the divisional inspectors of schools, one for each Commissioner's Division, who, with the help of\n\n---\n\n1 Owing to the recent transfer of officers to the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, the strength of the Indian Educational service in Bengal has been reduced to 27 officers. It includes 2 divisional inspectors of schools, the inspector of European schools, the inspectress of schools, the Assistant Director of Public Instruction, 5 principals and 14 professors of colleges, and 3 officers to fill vacancies. After the transfer of 27 officers to the new Province, there remain 81 officers in the Bengal Provincial service: namely, 4 divisional inspectors and 5 assistant inspectors of schools, 5 principals and 42 professors of colleges, 16 head masters of collegiate and training schools, and 9 other officers. Altogether 101 officers have been transferred to the new Province from the Subordinate Educational service, which now comprises 346 officers exclusive of the sub-inspectors of schools.\n330\n\nBENGAf.\n\nassistant inspectors, supervise all schools in tlicir Divisions. Usually\neach District is in charge of a deputy-inspector, who is assisted by a\nsub-inspector in each subdivision and guru instructors in each thdna.\nThe District boards have control over education more or less elementary in rural tracts, but in some cases they have delegated their duties\nin regard to primary education to local boards. In the few Districts\nwhere these boards do not exist, the local control is vested in special\ncommittees.\nThe department^ maintains ii Arts colleges, including one for girls ;\n9 professional colleges, of which 7 are law colleges attached to and\nforming part of the same number of Arts colleges ; 77 secondary schools,\nincluding 2 high and one middle English school for girls; 123 primary\nschools, including one for girls; and also 145 schools for special instruction, including a Government college and 4 Government vernacular\nschools for medicine.\nThe teaching institutions fall into three main groups : namely. University education, or the advanced instruction given to candidates for\ndegrees ; and secondary education, or the instruction given to boys and\ngirls who have passed beyond the third or elementary stage, known as\nprimary education.\nThe rise of the Calcutta University dates from 1856, when rules were\nformulated for conducting examinations and granting degrees in Arts,\nLaw, Medicine, and Engineering, and the Presidency College was\nplaced upon an improved footing. The Act of Incorporation of the\nCalcutta University was passed in January, 1857. In 1859 the intermediate examination in Arts was established, the degree of ' Licentiate '\nwas created in the Faculties of Law and Engineering, and that of\nDoctor in the Faculty of Law. The degree of M.A. was conferred for\nthe first time in 1862, and that of Bachelor of Science in T901-2.\nIn 1904 the Indian Universities Act was passed, which gives greater\ncontrol in academical matters to the teachers who are connected with\ncolleges affiliated to the University ; it also aims at improving the\nstandard of education in colleges, imposes more stringent conditions\non affiliation, and provides for periodical inspection by experts.\nThe Viceroy is Chancellor of the L^niversity. The Fellows are\nappointed by him, but some of them are selected on the suggestion\nof graduates and of the Faculties of the Senate. The Vice-Chancellor\nis appointed by the Governor-General-in-Council from the Fellows.\nThe University is not a teaching University in the ordinary sense of the\n* In the new Provincial area the department maintains S Arts colleges, one of\nwhich is for girls ; 6 professional colleges ; 59 secondary schools, including one high\nand 2 middle English schools for girls; 86 primary schools, one of which is for girls;\nand 103 special schools, including one Government college and 3 Government\nvernacular schools for medicine.\n\n\f\nterm; its principal functions are to affiliate colleges, to recognize high schools, to prescribe courses of study for colleges and the upper classes of high schools, to hold examinations, and to grant certificates and diplomas to the successful candidates. The Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, and Fellows constitute the Senate, which meets once a year, and also when convened by the Vice-Chancellor on the requisition of any six members. It is divided into the Faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine, and Engineering, to which a Faculty of Science has now been added. These Faculties are appointed by the Senate at its annual meeting, and each elects its own president; every member of the Senate is a member of at least one Faculty. The executive government of the University is vested in a Syndicate, consisting of the Vice-Chancellor and ten of the Fellows, who are elected for one year by the several Faculties. Boards of Studies consisting of from six to sixteen members are appointed for the principal departments of studies; their duties are to recommend textbooks and the courses of study in their respective departments, and to advise the Syndicate regarding the appointment of examiners and upon any other matter that may be referred to them. The expenditure of the University in 1903-4 was 2.29 lakhs, which was entirely met from the fees paid by candidates at the examinations.\n\nIn 1857, 10 Arts colleges were affiliated to the Calcutta University. The number had risen to 34 in 1891, to 44 in 1901, and to 46 in 1903-4. These are divided into two grades: the first-grade teach up to the B.A. standard of the University, while in the second-grade colleges the course prescribed for the intermediate examination in Arts, or a course of a similar standard, is taught. An undergraduate of the University may appear for the B.A. or B.Sc. examination, provided he has prosecuted a regular course of study in any affiliated institution for not less than four academical years, and if he passes, he may appear at the M.A. examination whenever he pleases. Of the 46 affiliated colleges, 11 are maintained by Government and one from municipal funds; 6 are aided and 28 unaided. The Presidency, Patna, and St. Xavier's Colleges were affiliated to the B.Sc. standard of the Calcutta University in 1901. The Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science has also been affiliated to this standard. In addition to those just mentioned, the Dacca* College, the General Assembly's Institution, the Duff College, the Metropolitan Institution, the Ripon and the Bangab\u0101si Colleges are the most important Arts colleges. The total expenditure incurred on Arts and Professional colleges in 1903-4 was 12.73 lakhs, of which 5.87 lakhs was derived from Provincial revenues and 4.92 lakhs from fees.\n\nA Law department was attached to the Presidency College and affiliated to the University in 1857. This example was soon followed,\nand the number of colleges teaching law had grown to 12 in 1890-1, and to 17 in 1900-1, the number falling to 16 in 1903-4. The opening of law classes in other Calcutta institutions greatly reduced the attendance and income of those at the Presidency College, which were therefore abolished. The Calcutta Medical College was founded in 1835 by Lord William Bentinck, and affiliated to the Calcutta University in 1857. For the students of this college University standards of various descriptions have been prescribed. Institutions for medical education are now controlled by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals. The Civil Engineering College was opened in November, 1856, as a department of the Presidency College, but in 1880 it was replaced by the Government Engineering College at Sibpur (see Howrah), which was affiliated to the University; the instruction was made more practical, and classes were opened for civil engineers, mechanical engineers, overseers, and mechanical apprentices. A few appointments under Government are guaranteed to the students of this college.\n\nStudents not living with their parents or guardians are now required to reside at duly authorized hostels. The number of such hostels in 1903-4 was 411, with 14,045 inmates; and they were maintained at a cost of 10.95 lakhs, of which Rs. 51,000 was paid from public sources.\n\nThe results of the most important examinations in each of the years 1880-1, 1890-1, 1900-1, and 1903-4 are shown below:\n\n| Passes* in | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Matriculation | 1,184 | 1,816 | 2,812 | 2,394 |\n| First or Intermediate in Arts degree | 320 | 693 | 1,039 | 1,198 |\n| Ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree | 126 | 231 | 329 | 295 |\n| Higher and special degrees | 30\u2020 | 57\u2021 | 91\u00a7 | 74\u2016 |\n\n* Including private candidates.\n\u2020 In M.A. only. Besides, there were 35 passes in B.L., 17 in L.M.S., one in Honours in Medicine, 9 in M.B., 10 in L.E., and 3 in B.E.\n\u2021 In M.A. only. Besides, there were 128 passes in B.L., 13 in 2nd L.M.S., one in Honours in Medicine, 3 in 2nd M.B., one in M.D., 3 in L.E., and 2 in B.E.\n\u00a7 In M.A. only. Besides, there were 160 passes in B.L., 64 in 2nd L.M.S., 3 in 2nd M.B., and 10 in B.E.\n\u2016 In M.A. only. Besides, there were 136 passes in B.L., 50 in 2nd L.M.S., 3 in 2nd M.B., 12 in B.E., and 5 in B.Sc.\n\nSchools which have classes where students are prepared for the University Matriculation examination are classed as 'high schools,' and all other secondary schools are 'middle schools.' The latter, again, are divided into two classes, according as English is or is not included in the curriculum. This language is the medium of instruction in the first four classes of high schools, and it is taught as a second language in all but the lowest classes of both high and middle English schools. There is a tendency to convert middle vernacular into middle English schools, and to raise the latter to the rank of high schools; the middle English\nnow outnumber the middle vernacular schools, and also contain considerably more pupils. The attendance at schools of this class is improving, and is now about the same as in high schools. The total number of secondary schools for boys in 1903-4 was 2,465, of which 74, or 3 per cent., were directly managed by Government, and 186, or 7.5 per cent., by District or municipal boards; 1,584, or 64.3 per cent., were aided from public funds, including Native State revenues, while the rest were unaided. The number attending these schools was 252,000, or 4.4 per cent. of the boys of school-going age.\n\nPrimary schools are intended chiefly for the masses. They are divided into two grades\u2014upper and lower. In the latter the elements of reading, writing, simple arithmetic, and agriculture are taught. It is now proposed to establish in purely agricultural areas rural schools with shorter and simpler courses suited to the needs of the agricultural population. In the upper primary schools the curriculum is a little more advanced, though considerably below the final course prescribed for middle schools; it includes the elements of history, geography, geometry, and science, in addition to the study of vernacular literature. A few primary schools are managed by the Educational department or by local bodies; but the great majority are merely aided by the grant of monthly or quarterly stipends, supplemented by grants made on the result of local inspection and depending upon the number of pupils under instruction, the stage of instruction reached, the qualifications of the gurus, the nature and condition of the school-house, and other factors which go to make up a successful school. This system of payment was until recently the usual one, except in backward localities, but it has been held not to work satisfactorily. It has now been decided to pay all the gurus by fixed stipends, and an additional grant of 5 lakhs has been set aside by the Local Government for this purpose. In 1903-4, 122 primary schools were wholly maintained by the department, 18 by District or municipal boards, and 304 by Native States; nearly 82 per cent. of the total number were aided in the manner described above, and a few were aided by Native States; the remainder were unaided. The average yearly pay of the teachers of upper primary schools was about Rs. 136 in 1900-1, and rose to Rs. 148 in 1903-4; that of the teachers of lower primary schools rose in the same period from Rs. 56 to Rs. 63. In recent years no systematic attempt has been made to train gurus, but training schools for them are now being started in each subdivision.\n\nThe promotion of female education in Bengal is beset with difficulties. There is no general demand for it as a means of livelihood; the parda system and early marriage stand in the way, and, until recently, the curriculum was not suitable for girls. New standards, containing more congenial subjects such as literature, history, domestic economy, and\nneedlework, have now been prescribed for schools in and about Calcutta, and are being gradually introduced in the Districts.\n\nGirls' schools in advanced tracts are aided from Provincial revenues, and model primary schools for them have been started in every District. Training classes, aided from Provincial revenues, have been recently opened in connexion with mission and other schools, and orthodox Hindu and Muhammadan female teachers have been appointed to further the spread of zan\u0101na education. Zan\u0101na teaching is also carried on by Christian missionaries and by several Hindu and Brahmo associations, especially in Calcutta.\n\nThe number of Arts colleges and schools for girls rose from 831 in 1881 to 2,362 in 1891, to 2,973 in 1901, and to 5,005 in 1904. In the same years the numbers of girls in colleges were respectively 5, 40, 72, and 98; in secondary schools, 6,000, 5,500, 5,600, and 5,600; and in primary schools, 29,000, 75,000, 91,000, and 147,000. The percentage of girls under instruction to the number of school-going age was 0.87 in 1880\u20131, 1.61 in 1890\u20131, 1.8 in 1900\u20131, and 2.8 in 1903\u20134. The Bethune College, La Martini\u00e8re, and Loretto House are the principal centres of female education. In all twelve high schools for girls were aided by Government or by District or municipal boards in 1903\u20134.\n\nDistrict boards spent Rs. 25,000 on girls' schools in 1890\u20131, Rs. 38,000 in 1900\u20131, and Rs. 80,000 in 1903\u20134. The boards have also created special scholarships for female pupils in primary schools. To encourage their education up to higher standards at home, Government has recently ruled that girls may draw scholarship stipends without attending schools, if they can prove that they have attained a higher standard by home study. There are an inspectress and assistant inspectress of girls' schools, whose duty it is to look after female education.\n\nThe establishment of normal schools for training teachers other than gur\u016bs dates from 1855, but it was not until 1874 that they became at all numerous. There were then 56 in all. There are 10 medical schools as compared with 5 in 1884; of these 4 are Government institutions, and the rest are unaided. Among other special schools may be mentioned 4 engineering and survey and 4 art schools. There were 27 industrial schools with 806 pupils in 1903\u20134, against 4 with 144 pupils twenty years previously. Madrasas (for the teaching of Arabic and Persian) have increased during the same period from 7 to 83. Various other educational institutions, such as recognized tols (for the teaching of Sanskrit), reformatory schools, music schools, and schools for the deaf and dumb, number in all 590. An agricultural department attached to the Sibpur Civil Engineering College was attended in 1903\u20134 by 25 students, 11 in the first year class and 14 in the second year; it has not been very successful and will shortly be removed to Pusa.\nFixed grants were formerly given to certain European schools in Bengal, but since 1882 the annual grants have been based partly on the returns of attendance, and partly on the results of examinations. The primary and secondary schools, taken together, numbered 55 with 5,000 pupils in 1883, and 69 with 7,000 pupils in 1891; while 80 schools with 8,000 pupils were returned in 1903\u20134. The number of pupils who passed the various code examinations was 65 in 1883, 247 in 1891, and 543 in 1903\u20134: the numbers who passed the entrance examination of the Calcutta University in the same three years were 38, 95, and 16 respectively. A few boys of the better class are provided with appointments in the Police, Opium, and Accounts departments. Some have obtained situations in railways, mercantile offices, tea-gardens, and jute factories, and some have continued their education in the Medical College or at the Sibpur Engineering College. The girls have become teachers, typewriters, or shop assistants, and a few of them have entered the medical profession.\n\nAlthough some improvement is observable of late years, Muhammadans are still backward in respect of education. In proportion to the relative populations, Hindus gained twelve times as many University degrees in 1901 as Muhammadans, and they sent thrice the number of pupils to secondary schools. In the same year only 9 per cent. of Muhammadans of school-going age attended primary schools, as compared with 11\u00b79 per cent. among Hindus. The comparison, however, cannot fairly be made solely on a numerical basis; the great majority of the Muhammadans of Bengal are converts from the lower strata of the population, and it is doubtful if they are worse educated than the Kochs and Chandals and cognate Hindu castes from whose ranks they have sprung. Moreover, their instruction in the ordinary schools is retarded by the long course of religious training which a devout Musalman must undergo before he may turn his thoughts to the acquisition of secular knowledge. In order to foster Muhammadan education, steps have been taken to improve the Maktaba and Koran schools by offering subsidies to teachers who adopt the departmental standards, by replacing teachers of the old type by better qualified men, and by increasing the number of Muhammadans on the inspecting staff. Muhammadan pupils in high schools are allowed additional free studentships and enjoy the benefits of the Mohsin fund, under which they obtain part remission of fees in schools and colleges. Several special scholarships have also been created, with a view to enable Muhammadans to receive collegiate education.\n\nThe great home of the aboriginal races is in the hills and uplands of the Chota Nagpur plateau and the adjacent country. Special attention has been given to the requirements of these rude tribes by Government and the District boards, and excellent service has been\nrendered by missionaries, who have established many schools in their midst. The Dublin University Mission has started a college at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh for the promotion of their higher education, and a Government high school at R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti is also chiefly intended for aborigines. In the Sant\u0101l Parganas a special inspector has been appointed to visit Sant\u0101l schools. In all 8,000 Christian and 34,000 non-Christian aborigines attended school in 1903-4.\n\nThe expenditure on the various classes of educational institutions in 1900-1 and in 1903-4, with the sources from which the funds were derived, is shown in Table XIV at the end of this article (p. 358).\n\nThe number of children attending schools represented 10.2 per cent. of the total population of school-going age in 1881, 13.5 in 1891, 14.2 in 1901, and 16.5 per cent. in 1903-4. The number of persons returned as literate at the Census of 1901 was 4,259,000, or 5.5 per cent. of the total population; for males the percentage was 10.5 and for females 0.5. During the last decade the number of literate males shows an increase of 15 per cent., while that of females has risen by 63 per cent. In every 10,000 persons of each sex, 89 males and 6 females can read and write English. The Burdwan, Presidency, and Orissa Divisions are the most advanced in the matter of education. Among religions, Christians take the lead, followed, in the order mentioned, by Buddhists, Hindus, Musalmans, and Animists. Of the Hindu indigenous castes, the Baidyas and K\u0101yasths have the largest proportion of literate persons, and the depressed race-castes of Bih\u0101r have the smallest.\n\nThe fees in Government colleges vary from Rs. 12 a month in the Presidency College to Rs. 2 in the Calcutta Madrasa and the Sanskrit College; those in aided colleges range from Rs. 5 to Rs. 3, and those in unaided colleges from Rs. 5 to Rs. 2-8. In Government high schools fees range from R. 1 to Rs. 5; in aided high schools from annas 8 to Rs. 2, and in unaided high schools from annas 4 to Rs. 2. In Government middle schools the fees vary from annas 2 to R. 1, in aided middle schools from 2 to 8 annas, and in unaided middle schools from 1 to 8 annas. In primary schools the fees are from 1 to 4 annas.\n\nThe principal statistics of colleges, schools, and scholars for each of the years 1890-1, 1900-1, and 1903-4 are shown in Table XV at the end of this article (p. 359).\n\nLeaving out of account the Sam\u0101ch\u0101r Darj\u0101n, which was started long ago at Serampore by Baptist missionaries, and the Sam\u0101ch\u0101r Chandrik\u0101, a Calcutta publication, it is doubtful whether even half a dozen vernacular newspapers were in existence in Bengal before 1860. In 1863, when a weekly official report on native papers was instituted, the total number was 20, of which one was published in English and Urd\u016b, 3 in Persian, one in Hindi, and 15 in Bengali. No\n\n---\n\n1 The Raj College at Burdwan charges no fees.\nless than 7 of these papers were entirely devoted to religious and social topics. The numbers of these newspapers stood at 40 in 1873, at 50 in 1881, at 71 in 1891, at 55 in 1901, and at 70 (4 only being Muhammadan) in 1903-4. In that year there were also 22 native-owned English newspapers and 4 Anglo-veracular papers. Owing to the spread of vernacular education and the growth of a reading public, the native newspaper press has now, in its own way, become a power in the country. A great change has gradually taken place in its character, tone, and literary style. In 1863 and for some years afterwards the papers devoted small space to the discussion of political questions or large administrative measures, and items of news and speculations on religious and social subjects constituted the major portion of their contents. Politics received very meagre treatment; the writers offered their opinions with diffidence, and their tone was always respectful: their literary style was stiff and sanskritized. The principal characteristics of such papers at the present time are the increasing prominence given to political and administrative questions, a reckless, exaggerated, and occasionally disloyal tone, and a colloquial, ungrammatical, and anglicized style. With the spread of English education, the papers published in English by Bengalis are rapidly growing in importance.\n\nThe vernacular papers have, as a rule, a very limited circulation, and only about 15 are of much importance. The Hitabadi and Basumati occupy the first place in respect of circulation; the latter paper has, however, less influence than the Bangabasi, the organ of the orthodox Hindus. The Sanjibani is the mouthpiece of the Brahmos, and the Habl-ul-matin and Mihir-o-Sudhakar represent the Muhammadans.\n\nThe number of publications received in the Bengal Library during 1903-4 was 2,905, of which 2,089 were books and 816 were periodicals. These publications deal with literary, social, political, religious, and economic subjects; but, with the exception of a few important scientific publications, they display little original research.\n\nMost of the chief medical institutions of the Province are in Calcutta. Among the Mofussil institutions the largest and most important is the Mitford Hospital at Dacca*, which was built in 1858 at a cost of over Rs. 76,000; it has accommodation for 170 patients. The Bankipore Hospital, for which a new building is being provided, has now 124 beds; the Cuttack General Hospital has 82 beds; the Burdwan Hospital, 76; the Darbhanga Hospital, 65; the Midnapore Hospital, 77; and the Gay\u00e3 Pilgrim Hospital, 84 beds. The Lady Dufferin Zanana Hospitals in Bettiah and Darbhanga, maintained, respectively, by the Bettiah and the Darbhanga Rajas, and the Lady Elgin Zanana Hospital at Gay\u00e3 are also doing excellent work.\n\nMEDICAL\n\n* Medical.\nThere are dispensaries at all District and subdivisional head-quarters and wherever there are municipalities, and also at many places in the interior; all the former and many of the latter of these have accommodation for in-patients. They are for the most part maintained by the municipality or District board concerned, with the aid of grants from Government and public subscriptions. The total number of these dispensaries in 1903 was 614, compared with only 237 twenty years earlier. For further details Table XVI at the end of this article may be referred to (p. 360).\n\nThere are 5 lunatic asylums in the Province, situated at Bhaw\u0101n\u012bpur in Calcutta, Dacca*, Patna, Cuttack, and Berhampore. Of these, the first is reserved for Europeans and Eurasians, and the others for natives; the latter, with the exception of that at Dacca*, will soon be replaced by a single central asylum. The alleged causes of insanity among Europeans are chiefly the abuse of alcohol among males and heredity in the case of females; g\u0101nja-smoking and heredity are the chief causes assigned for lunacy among natives.\n\nThere are 8 asylums for lepers, at Gobr\u0101, Deogarh, Pur\u016blia, R\u0101n\u012bganj, Asansol, B\u0101nkur\u0101, Bh\u0101galpur, and Loh\u0101rdag\u0101. The six last mentioned have been established by the Society for Missions to Lepers in India and the East, and the Gobr\u0101 asylum is a Government institution managed by a body appointed by Government. The total number of inmates in October, 1904, was 1,179, of whom 622 were in the Pur\u016blia asylum. The Lepers Act, III of 1898, which came into force in Bengal in 1901, provides for the segregation and medical treatment of pauper lepers and for the control of lepers following certain trades connected with the bodily requirements of human beings.\n\nIn former times the practice of inoculation was widespread. The operation was preceded by a ceremony performed in honour of S\u012bt\u0101la, the goddess of small-pox: a twig of a mango-tree was dipped in a pitcher of water, some mantras or charms were recited by a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and offerings of milk and sweetmeats were made. The patient was then inoculated with the crust of small-pox on the right forearm, if a male, or on the left forearm, if a female. He was bathed on the second day, to bring on fever, and was then confined for twenty-one days, after which a mixture of turmeric, n\u012bm leaves, and coco-nut oil was rubbed over the body. Inoculation is still practised clandestinely in parts of Orissa and Bih\u0101r, but it is becoming more and more rare, and vaccination is rapidly taking its place. Vaccinators are licensed by District Magistrates, and their work is supervised by the Civil Surgeons and the Superintendents of Vaccination. Where the older method survives, the vaccinators are usually recruited from the ranks of the former inoculators, but in the Province as a whole barely a quarter of the staff belongs to this class.\nThe chief statistics of hospitals, lunatic asylums, and of vaccination are shown in Table XVI at the end of this article (p. 360).\n\nIn order to bring quinine within the reach of all, the system of selling it through the agency of the Postal department, in pice-packets, each containing 5 (now 7) grains, was inaugurated in 1892. The drug is manufactured at the Government factory in Darjeeling, and is made up into packets at the Alipore jail, whence it is supplied to all post offices in Bengal. The postmasters receive a small commission on the sales effected by them. The system has met with considerable success; in 1903 nearly 3,000,000 packets of this valuable febrifuge were sold, compared with one-eighth of a million in 1893.\n\nThe difficulties in the way of promoting village sanitation in India are enormous, the chief being the ignorance and prejudices of the people and the absence of an educated and trustworthy local agency. Something has been done to improve the water-supply by providing tanks and wells, and disinfecting them either periodically or when epidemic disease breaks out; and grave sanitary evils which affect the public health and so constitute a public nuisance, are dealt with under Chapter XIV of the Indian Penal Code. The Local Self-Government Act (III (B.C.) of 1885) contains provisions for enforcing sanitation, but they have not yet been applied. A Sanitary Board was constituted in 1889, but it is merely a consultative body, and at present attention is directed mainly to the education of public opinion in municipalities. It is hoped that in time, with the diffusion of education, a knowledge of sanitary requirements will gradually spread to rural areas; but until it does so very few improvements are feasible.\n\nThe basis of all surveys in Bengal is the Grand Trigonometrical Survey which was carried out early in the nineteenth century. A general revenue survey commenced in 1835, and by 1872 the operations had been extended to the whole Province except Midnapore District (which was surveyed in 1872\u20138), the Sundarbans, Hill Tippera*, the Chittagong Hill Tracts*, the Santal Parganas, Angul, and the Chota Nagpur Division. Most of these tracts were topographically surveyed during the same period on scales varying from $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch to 1 inch to the mile. The revenue survey was preceded by a demarcation of villages and estates, which was known as the th\u0101k survey, and was generally made on the scale of 4 inches to the mile. The boundary of each village and estate was separately surveyed; the maps showed also important topographical details, but were on too small a scale to indicate field boundaries. From these surveys District maps have been prepared on $\\frac{1}{4}$ and 1 inch scales.\n\nBetween 1863 and 1869 a di\u0101ra\u00b9 survey was made along the banks of the Ganges from the point where it enters Bengal down to its junction\n\n\u00b9 Di\u0101ra means an alluvial flat or island.\nwith the Brahmaputra, and all changes due to alluvion and diluvion which had taken place since the revenue survey were mapped. In 1874-6 this survey was continued down to the sea. About the same time a number of surveys were made in different parts of the Province, either in order to resettle the revenue of Government estates, as in the case of Chittagong* and Khurd\u0101, or to assess gh\u0101\u1e6dw\u0101l\u012b lands in Chot\u0101 N\u0101gpur. These surveys were generally on a scale of 16 inches to the mile and showed field boundaries, but they were with some exceptions partial and unprofessional, and were lacking in accuracy and finish. In 1889 it became necessary to survey the sub-province of Orissa and the District of Chittagong*, in order to resettle the revenue of time-expired estates, and professional detachments of the Survey department of the Government of India were organized for this purpose. In 1890 it was decided to prepare a survey and record-of-rights in the North Bih\u0101r Districts, and similar methods were adopted. The total area dealt with by parties of the Survey of the Government of India between 1889 and the end of September, 1904, has been 32,915 square miles, as shown below:\n\n| District       | Area in square miles | District       | Area in square miles | District       | Area in square miles |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Chittagong*    | 2,003                | Cuttack        | 2,269                | Purnea         | 2,408                |\n| Muzaffarpur    | 3,046                | Balasore       | 1,733                | Backergunge*   | 2,126                |\n| Champ\u0101ran      | 3,280                | Pur\u012b           | 1,134                | R\u0101nchi         | 1,344                |\n| S\u0101ran          | 2,510                | Tippera*       | 554                  | Other District areas under 200 square miles | 853 |\n| Gay\u0101           | 546                  | Pal\u0101mau        | 294                  | Total          | 32,915               |\n| Darbhanga      | 3,397                | Bh\u0101galpur      | 3,849                |                |                      |\n| Monghyr        | 1,449                | Darjeeling     | 210                  |                |                      |\n\nThese surveys have been made on a scale of 16 inches to the mile (larger scales have sometimes been employed for crowded village sites), and the maps show the boundary of each field as well as all topographical features. In addition to the area shown above, similar operations have been carried out in the Sant\u0101l Parganas, Singhbh\u016bm, No\u0101kh\u0101li* and elsewhere, by parties working under the supervision of revenue officers, the field-to-field measurements in this case being sometimes preceded by a professional traverse survey. A large number of petty estates have also been surveyed at the request of the proprietors. Taking all these surveys together, cadastral maps of about 36,405 square miles, or nearly a quarter of the area of British territory in the Province, have been prepared since 1889.\n\nIn 1892 an officer of the Survey of India was appointed, with the title of Director of Bengal Surveys, to administer the Bengal Survey directly\n\n---\n\n1 Lands held, in lieu of pay, for police services. Disputes had arisen as to what lands were so held, and as to the services to be rendered.\nunder the Bengal Government. His post was abolished in 1895, and the appointment of Superintendent of Provincial Surveys created in its stead.\n\n[Vincent A.

Ich\u0101mat\u012b, Baral, and Hur\u0101s\u0101gar rivers. Population (1901), 1,675, and including its adjacent hamlets, 5,417. Ber\u0101 is a market with a considerable trade, especially in jute, and two European firms have branches here.\n\nBer\u0101r (otherwise known as the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Assigned Districts).\u2014A province, lying between 19\u00b0 35' and 21\u00b0 47' N. and 75\u00b0 59' and 79\u00b0 11' E., which has been administered by the British Government on behalf of His Highness the Niz\u0101m of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d since 1853. It consists of a broad valley running east and west, between two tracts of hilly country, the G\u0101wilgarh hills (the Melgh\u0101t) on the north, and the Ajanta range (the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t) on the south. The old name of the central valley was P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t; and these three names\u2014Melgh\u0101t, P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, and B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t\u2014will be used to define the three natural divisions of the province. The area of Ber\u0101r is 17,710 square miles.\n\nThe origin of the name Ber\u0101r, or Warh\u0101d as it is spelt in Mar\u0101th\u012b, is not known. It may possibly be a corruption of Vidarbha, the name of a large kingdom in the Deccan, of which the modern Ber\u0101r probably formed part in the age of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The popular derivation from certain eponymous Warh\u0101dis, who accompanied Rukmin and Rukmini to Amraoti when the latter went to pay her vows at the temple of Amb\u0101 Devi before her projected marriage to Sisup\u0101la, must be set aside as purely fanciful; and Abul Fazl's derivation of the name from Wardh\u0101, the river, and tat, a 'bank,' is of no more value.\n\nBer\u0101r is bounded on the north by the S\u0101tpur\u0101s and the T\u0101pti, which separate it from the Central Provinces; on the east, where again it adjoins the Central Provinces, by the Wardh\u0101; along the greater part of its southern frontier, where it adjoins the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, by the Pengang\u0101; while on the west an artificial line cutting across the broad valley from the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills to the Ajanta range, and produced southwards over those hills, separates it from the Bombay Presidency and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d.\n\nThe G\u0101wilgarh hills attain their greatest height along the southernmost range, immediately overlooking the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, where the average elevation is about 3,400 feet, the highest summit being 3,989 feet. These hills decrease in height as they stretch away towards the north, the average elevation of the range overlooking the T\u0101pti being no more than 1,650 feet. The plateaux of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t do not attain the height of the hills of the Melgh\u0101t, the elevation of Buld\u0101na, B\u0101sim, and Yeotm\u0101l being only 2,190 feet, 1,758 feet, and 1,583 feet, respectively. The general declination of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t table-land is from west to east, or in the direction of the Wardh\u0101 river, that of the G\u0101wilgarh hills being in the contrary direction.\nThe principal rivers of Ber\u0101r are the T\u0101pti, the P\u016brna, the Wardh\u0101, and the Pengang\u0101. The T\u0101pti runs from east to west and the Pengang\u0101 from west to east, each following the general declination of the range from which it receives its principal affluents. The Wardh\u0101 rises in the S\u0101tpur\u0101s and flows in a southerly direction, receiving the Pengang\u0101 at the south-eastern corner of the province. The P\u016brna, which is a tributary of the T\u0101pti, drains the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, rising in the lower slopes of the G\u0101w\u012blgarh hills in Amraoti District, and running westward through the valley until it leaves the province at the northernmost corner of the Malk\u0101pur t\u0101luk. The Pengang\u0101 rises in the hills near Deulgh\u0101t in Buld\u0101na District, traverses that District in a south-easterly direction, and enters the B\u0101sim t\u0101luk near W\u0101kad. From Yeoti eastwards it forms the southern boundary of Ber\u0101r till it meets the Wardh\u0101 at Jug\u0101d. Its principal tributaries are the P\u016bs, Arna, Ar\u0101n, W\u0101gh\u0101ri, K\u016bni, and Vaidarbha, which rise in the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t and flow to meet it in a south-easterly direction.\n\nThe only lake in Ber\u0101r is the salt lake of Lon\u0101r in Buld\u0101na District.\n\nThe scenery of the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t is monotonous and uninteresting. The wide expanse of black cotton soil, slightly undulating, is broken by few trees except bab\u016bls and groves near villages. In the autumn the crops give it a fresh and green appearance; but after the harvest the monotonous scene is unrelieved by verdure, shade, or water, and the landscape is desolate and depressing. The B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is more varied and pleasing, though here also the country has a parched and arid appearance in the hot season. The ground is less level and the country generally is better wooded. It stretches in parts into downs and dales, or is broken up into flat-topped hills and deep ravines, while in its eastern section the country is still more sharply featured by a splitting up of the main hill range, which has caused that variety of low-lying plains, high plateaux, fertile bottoms, and rocky wastes found in W\u016bn District. The scenery of the Melgh\u0101t is yet more picturesque, the most striking features of this tract being the abrupt scarps of trap rock near the summits of the hills, the densely wooded slopes, and the steep ravines. The undulating plateaux are rarely of great extent.\n\n1 With the exception of the south-eastern corner, comprising a portion of W\u016bn District, the whole of Ber\u0101r is covered by the Deccan trap flows. In the south-eastern corner the trap has been removed by atmospheric agencies, exposing small patches of the underlying Lameta beds, and the great God\u0101vari trough of Gondw\u0101na rocks, which are let down into very old unfossiliferous Pur\u0101na strata, are regarded as pre-Cambrian in age, and are known in other parts of peninsular India as Vindhyaans, Cuddapahs, &c. The Deccan trap is itself covered with\n\n1 From a note supplied by Mr. T. H. Holland, Director of the Geological Survey of India.\nalluvium in the valley of the P\u016brna. The groups represented in Ber\u0101r can be tabulated thus:\n\n| Group       | Age                        |\n|-------------|----------------------------|\n| Alluvium    | Recent and pleistocene     |\n| Deccan trap | Upper Cretaceous or lower eocene |\n| Lameta      | Upper Cretaceous           |\n| Gondw\u0101na    | Permo-carboniferous to Jurassic |\n| Pur\u0101na      | Pre-Cambrian               |\n\nThe old rocks of the Pur\u0101na group come to the surface on the south-eastern margin of the great cap of Deccan trap, occupying the border out to the main boundary of the Gondw\u0101na strata. They are covered by two small isolated patches of Deccan trap\u2014outliers south-east of K\u0101yar\u2014and with some outliers of Gondw\u0101na beds in the Vaidarbha valley and farther west. In one or two small hills in this corner of the province the distinction between the Pur\u0101na sandstones and the much later sandstones belonging to the Kamptee division of the Gondw\u0101na system is seen. Y\u0101nak hill (1,005 feet) is formed of Pur\u0101na sandstones, and several bands of conglomerate occur containing pebbles of hematite, from which the iron ore formerly made at Y\u0101nak was obtained. Shales, slates, and limestones of the Pur\u0101na group prevail to the west of the sandstone bed in W\u016bn District, giving some magnificent sections in the Pengang\u0101 and its tributaries.\n\nThe Gondw\u0101na rocks are especially worthy of notice, on account of their coal-measures. It has been estimated that about 2,100,000,000 tons of coal are available in W\u016bn District. Direct evidence of the occurrence of coal has been obtained throughout 13 miles of country from W\u016bn to P\u0101p\u016br, and for 10 miles from Jun\u0101ra to Chincholi. It is estimated that there are 150,000,000 tons above the 500 feet level between Jun\u0101ra and Chincholi; and the existence of thick coal has been proved in the Bar\u0101kars which crop out near the Wardh\u0101 river, in the south-eastern part of W\u016bn District.\n\nThe Deccan trap, with which the greater part of Ber\u0101r is covered, was erupted towards the end of Cretaceous times, the volcanic activity stretching on, probably, into the beginning of the Tertiary period. At the base, and stretching beyond the fringe, of the Deccan trap, there is often a fresh-water, or subaerial, formation, composed of clays, sandstones, and limestones, representing the materials formed by weathering or actually deposited in water on the old continent over which the Deccan lava flows spread.\n\nThe hollow containing the lake of Lon\u0101r in Buld\u0101na District was probably caused by a violent gaseous explosion long after the eruption of the Deccan trap, and in comparatively recent times.\n\nAn interesting feature of the alluvial deposits in the valley of the P\u016brna is the occurrence of salt in some of the beds at a little depth below the surface. Wells used formerly to be sunk on both sides of\nthe river for the purpose of obtaining brine from the gravelly layers. The absence of fossils supports the idea that the salt is not derived from marine beds, but is in all probability due to the concentration of the salts ordinarily carried in underground water through the excessive surface evaporation which goes on in these dry areas for most of the year.\n\nThe Melgh\u0101t hills are forest-clad, the constituent vegetation being that characteristic of the S\u0101tpur\u0101s generally. The most plentiful species is Boswellia, accompanied by Cochlospermum, Anogeissus latifolia, and Lagerstroemia parviflora. Where the soil is deeper more valuable species, such as Tectona grandis, Dendrocalamus strictus, and, more sparingly, Hardwickia binata, are found occupying the valleys and ravines. Scattered throughout the forest occur Ougeinia dalbergioides, Adina cordifolia, Stephegyne parvifolia, Terminalia tomentosa, Schrebera swietenioides, Eugenia Jambolana, Bridelia retusa, Terminalia Chebula; some heavy creepers, such as Bauhinia Vahlii; and species of Millettia, Combretum, Vitis, &c. On lighter gravelly soil, both in Northern and Southern Ber\u0101r, forests with Hardwickia binata are met with. Pterocarpus Marsupium occurs near the edges of most of the high plateaux, with occasional trees of Dalbergia latifolia.\n\nWhere the soil in the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is thin, the slopes and plateaux are covered chiefly with Boswellia; but in deeper soil Anogeissus latifolia, Diospyros melanoxylon, and Terminalia tomentosa are the principal species. Along river banks considerable quantities of Terminalia Arjuna and Schleichera trijuga are sometimes met with. In the bottoms of the ravines are scattered clumps of Dendrocalamus strictus. The hills are often bare and grass-clad, the most striking species being large Andropogons, Anthistirias, Iseilemas, &c. In level tracts, mangoes, tamarinds, mahu\u0101s, and pipals abound, with groves of Phoenix sylvestris. Stretches of bab\u016bl jungle are characteristic of the province. In cultivated ground the weed vegetation is that characteristic of the Deccan, and includes many small Compositae.\n\nThe principal wild animals are the tiger, the leopard, the hunting leopard, and the wild cat among Felidae. Deer and antelopes are represented by the s\u0101mbar, the spotted deer, the barking-deer, the common Indian antelope, the nilgai, the four-horned antelope, and the chink\u0101ra; and Canidae by the Indian wolf, the Indian fox, the wild dog, and the jackal. The striped hyena, the wild hog, and the Indian black or sloth bear are of frequent occurrence, the last especially in the Melgh\u0101t. Monkeys are represented by the langur.\n\n1 Memoirs, Geological Survey of India, vol. xiii; Records, Geological Survey of India, vol. i, part iii; General Report of the Geological Survey of India (1902-5).\n\n2 From a note supplied by Major D. Prain, I.M.S., Director of the Botanical Survey.\nand the smaller red monkey, the latter being found in the Melghat only, while the former is common throughout the province.\n\nThe climate differs very little from that of the Deccan generally, except that in the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t the hot season is exceptionally severe. During April and May, and until the rains set in about the middle of June, the sun is very powerful, and there is by day severe heat, but without the scorching winds of Northern India. The nights are comparatively cool throughout, and during the rains the air is moist and fairly cool. The climate of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t is similar to that of the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, but the thermometer stands much lower than in the plains. On the higher plateaux of the G\u0101wilgarh hills, the climate is always temperate, and at the sanitarium of Chikalda the heat is seldom so great as to be unpleasant.

In this epic the R\u0101j\u0101 of V\u012bdarbha, Rukmin, is represented as an arrogant and presumptuous prince, who vainly attempted to prevent the marriage of his sister Rukmini to the demi-god Krishna, and who subsequently so disgusted the P\u0101ndavas by his pretensions that they declined his assistance in their quarrel with the Kauravas, leaving him to retire in dudgeon to his own dominions.\nThe next mention of Vidarbha is in connexion with the famous Oriental romance of Nala and Damayanti. Nala, R\u0101j\u0101 of Nishadha (M\u0101lw\u0101), loved Damayanti, the daughter of Bhima, R\u0101j\u0101 of Vidarbha. It is unnecessary to pursue this story, which is mainly mythical, through its intricacies of detail; but we learn from it that the kingdom of Vidarbha had for its capital a city of the same name, with which the city of Bidar in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions has been identified. If the identification be correct, and it is supported by legend as well as by etymology, we may conclude that the ancient kingdom was far more extensive than the modern province of Ber\u0101r. Tradition says that its kings bore sway over the whole of the Deccan.\n\nThe authentic history of Ber\u0101r commences with the Andhras or S\u0101tav\u0101hanas, of whose dominions it undoubtedly formed part. In the third century B.C., the Andhras occupied the deltas of the God\u0101vari and Kistna, and were one of the tribes on the outer fringe of Asoka\u2019s empire. Soon after the death of that great ruler their territory was rapidly enlarged, and their sway reached N\u0101sik. The twenty-third king, V\u012bliv\u0101yakura II (A.D. 113\u201338), successfully warred against his neighbours, the western Satraps of Gujar\u0101t and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r, whose predecessors had encroached on the Andhra kingdom. A few years later, however, the Satraps were victorious and the Andhra rule appears to have come to an end about 236. The next rulers of the province of whom records have survived were the R\u0101j\u0101s of the V\u0101k\u0101taka dynasty, of whom there were ten. This dynasty was probably feudatory to the Vallabhis, but their chronology is very uncertain. The Abh\u012bras or Ahirs, who succeeded the V\u0101k\u0101takas, are said to have reigned as independent sovereigns for only sixty-seven years; but Ahir and Gaoli chieftains continued long afterwards to hold important forts in Ber\u0101r and the neighbouring country, giving their names to their strongholds, as in the case of Gaoligarh in Kh\u0101ndesh, As\u012brgarh (Asa Ahir Garh) in the Central Provinces, and G\u0101wilgarh in Ber\u0101r. The Ch\u0101lukyas next rose to power in the Deccan. Their dominions included Ber\u0101r, and they reigned until 750, when they were overthrown by the R\u0101shtrak\u016btas, who ruled till 973, when the Ch\u0101lukyas regained their ascendancy, which they retained, though not without vicissitudes, for two centuries. On the death, in 1189, of Somesvara IV, the last R\u0101j\u0101 of the restored Ch\u0101lukya line, his dominions were divided between the Hoysala Ball\u0101las of the south, whose capital was Dorasamudra or Dw\u0101r\u0101vati-pura\u00b9, and the Y\u0101davas of Deogiri, the modern Daulat\u0101b\u0101d, Ber\u0101r naturally falling to the share of the latter. R\u0101j\u0101 Bhillama I, the founder of this dynasty, established himself at Deogiri in 1188; and the Y\u0101davas had reigned with some renown for rather more than a century, when, in\n\n\u00b9 Haleb\u012bd, in Hassan District, Mysore.\nthe reign of R\u0101mchandra, the sixth R\u0101j\u0101, the Deccan was invaded by the Musalm\u0101ns.\n\nIn 1294 Al\u0101-ud-din, the nephew and son-in-law of F\u012broz Sh\u0101h Khilji, Sultan of Delhi, invaded the Deccan by way of Chanderi and Ellichpur. After defeating the Y\u0101dava R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101mchandra, styled R\u0101mdeo by Muhammadan historians, at Deogiri, he was attacked by the R\u0101j\u0101's son, whom also he defeated. He was then bought out of the country by a heavy ransom, which included the cession of the revenues of Ellichpur, the district remaining under Hindu administration. On his return to Hindust\u0101n Al\u0101-ud-din murdered his uncle at Kar\u0101 and usurped the throne. Throughout his reign he dispatched successive expeditions into the Deccan, but in the confusion which followed his death in 1316 Harp\u0101l Deo of Deogiri rose in rebellion. He was defeated by Kutb-ud-din Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h I in 1317\u20138, and was flayed alive, his skin being nailed to one of the gates of Deogiri. His dominions were annexed to the Delhi empire, and thus Ber\u0101r for the first time became a Muhammadan possession, which it has remained ever since. Ber\u0101r gained considerably in importance during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlak of Delhi, who in 1327 transferred the capital of his empire from Delhi to Daulat\u0101b\u0101d (Deogiri). In the latter years of this emperor's reign the Am\u012brs of the Deccan rebelled, and in 1348 Hasan Gang\u016b, Zafar Kh\u0101n, was proclaimed Sult\u0101n of the Deccan under the title of Al\u0101-ud-din Bahman Shah\u00b9.\n\nAl\u0101-ud-din Bahman, shortly after he had ascended the throne, divided his kingdom into four provinces or tarafs, of which Ber\u0101r, which included M\u0101h\u016br, R\u0101mgarh, and P\u0101thri, was the northernmost. During the next 130 years Ber\u0101r furnished contingents in the innumerable wars waged by the Bahmani kings against the R\u0101j\u0101s of Vijayanagar, Teling\u0101na, Orissa, and the Konkan, the Sult\u0101ns of Gujar\u0101t, M\u0101lw\u0101, and Kh\u0101ndesh, and the Gonds. It was overrun by Musalm\u0101ns from the independent kingdoms on its northern frontier, by Gonds from Ch\u0101nda, and by Hindus from Teling\u0101na. Ahmad Sh\u0101h Wali, the ninth king of the Bahmani dynasty, found it necessary to recapture the forts of Mah\u016br and Kalam in Eastern Ber\u0101r, which had fallen into the hands of the infidels. In 1478 or 1479 Ber\u0101r, which had hitherto been an important province with a separate army and governed by nobles of high rank and position, was divided into two governments, each of which was known by the name of its fortress capital, the northern being called G\u0101wil and the southern Mah\u016br. At the same time the powers of the provincial governors were much curtailed, all important forts being placed under the command of kilad\u0101rs, who were immediately subordinate to the Sult\u0101n.\n\n\u00b9 Most historians have erred in respect of the title under which Bahman ascended the throne. His correct title is given as above in a contemporary inscription.\nThese salutary reforms came too late to save the Bahmani dynasty from ruin; and in the reign of the fourteenth Sult\u0101n, Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h II, the principal tarafd\u0101rs, or provincial governors, proclaimed their independence. Im\u0101d-ul-mulk, who had formerly been governor of the whole of Ber\u0101r and now held G\u0101wil, proclaimed his independence in 1490 and soon annexed M\u0101hur to his kingdom. He was by race a Kanarese Hindu, who had been made captive as a boy in one of the expeditions against Vijayanagar and brought up as a Musalm\u0101n by the governor of Ber\u0101r, to whose place he ultimately succeeded. Im\u0101d-ul-mulk died in 1504 and was succeeded by his son Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Im\u0101d Sh\u0101h, who made G\u0101wilgarh his capital and waged fruitless war against Amir Barid of Bidar and Burh\u0101n Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h of Ahmadnagar. Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn was succeeded on his death in 1529 by his son Dary\u0101 Im\u0101d Sh\u0101h, and he, after a peaceful and uneventful reign, by his son Burh\u0101n Im\u0101d Sh\u0101h (1560\u20131). This prince, shortly after his accession, was imprisoned in Nam\u0101la by his minister, Tuf\u0101l Kh\u0101n, who declared himself independent. In 1572 Murtaz\u0101 Niz\u0101m Sh\u0101h of Ahmadnagar invaded Ber\u0101r with the avowed intention of releasing Burh\u0101n from confinement. Tuf\u0101l Kh\u0101n, his son Shams-ul-mulk who had surrendered G\u0101wilgarh, and Burh\u0101n were captured shortly afterwards, and were imprisoned and put to death. Thus ended the rule of the Im\u0101dsh\u0101hi dynasty in Ber\u0101r, after a duration of eighty-five years.\n\nThe Ahmadnagar dynasty was not long destined to hold possession of the prize. At home it could do nothing to quell civil broils and allay dangerous feuds. Even when the famous Ch\u0101nd Bibi became queen-regent there was no chance of upholding a tottering state. In 1595 Sult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, the fourth son of the emperor Akbar, besieged Ahmadnagar, but raised the siege, early in 1596, on receiving the formal cession of Ber\u0101r.\n\nIn those times the Deccan swarmed with adventurers from every nation in Asia and even from the African coast of the Indian Ocean. These men and their descendants settled in the towns, and their chiefs occupied most of the high military and civil offices; but the Musalm\u0101n rulers of the Deccan did nothing to disturb the routine of ordinary revenue collections and the administration of the internal affairs of villages and parganas, so that the old Hindu organization, with its hereditary pargana and village officials, the relic, perhaps, of a civilization older still, was allowed to remain, recognized by the conquerors as a more convenient administrative machine than any which they could devise. There are now in Ber\u0101r several Muhammadan families of deshmukhs (former pargana officials); but they are all believed, and for the most part admit themselves, to be descendants of Hindus who in the reign of Aurangzeb accepted Isl\u0101m in preference to relinquishing their hereditary offices. They may be distinguished from other Musal-\nm\u0101ns by their antipathy to beef, and frequently by a partiality for Hindu names, while in one case there are in neighbouring parganas two families of deshmukhs, one Musalm\u0101n and the other Hindu, acknowledged cousins, both of them claiming to be R\u0101jputs by caste. Of the principal Mar\u0101th\u0101 families enumerated by Grant Duff as holding good positions under the Bahmani monarchy, that of J\u0101don Rao is the only one belonging to Ber\u0101r. In lineage and historical repute it yields to none, even if its claim to descent from the Y\u0101dava R\u0101j\u0101s of Deogiri be discredited; and the line is not yet extinct.\n\nSult\u0101n Mur\u0101d, after the annexation of Ber\u0101r to the Mughal empire, founded a town about 6 miles from B\u0101l\u0101pur, which he named Sh\u0101hpur, making it his residence: and the newly won province was divided among the Mughal nobles. After Mur\u0101d's death in 1598 Akbar formed the design of conquering the whole of the Deccan. Ahmadnagar was besieged and captured; and D\u0101niy\u0101l, the emperor's fifth son, was appointed governor of Ahmadnagar, Kh\u0101ndesh, and Ber\u0101r. He died in 1605, in the same year as his father, Akbar. For the greater part of the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br, Akbar's son and successor, Ber\u0101r was in the possession of Malik Ambar, the Abyssinian (died 1626), who represented the independence of the moribund dynasty of Ahmadnagar, and to whose military genius and administrative capacity a generous tribute is paid in the Tuzak-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, the official record of Jah\u0101ng\u012br's reign.\n\nIn the first year of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, Ber\u0101r passed once more under the Mughal sway. In 1636 the whole of that part of the Deccan which was in the possession of the Mughals was divided into four S\u016bbahs, or provinces, one of which was Ber\u0101r, with Ellichpur as its capital and G\u0101wilgarh as its principal fortress. Aurangzeb, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's third son, was appointed viceroy of these four S\u016bbahs. After Aurangzeb deposed his father, the resources of Ber\u0101r were taxed to the utmost by his campaigns in Bijapur, Golconda, and Southern India, and at the same time the province was the prey of Mar\u0101th\u0101 marauders. In 1680 it was overrun by Sambh\u0101ji, the son of Sivaji; and in 1698 R\u0101jar\u0101m, the half-brother and successor of Sambh\u0101ji, aided by Bakht Buland, the Gond R\u0101j\u0101 of Deogarh, who had embraced Isl\u0101m in order to obtain Aurangzeb's support, again devastated the province.\n\nIn 1718 Abdullah and Husain Ali Kh\u0101n, the Saiyid ministers of the emperor Farrukh Siyar, formally recognized the claim of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, who periodically overran Ber\u0101r, to chauth, or blackmail, to the extent of one-quarter of the revenue, and also permitted them to levy from the ryots the contribution known as sardeshmukhi, which seems to have been a royalty on appointments to or recognitions of the old Hindu office of deshmukh, and amounted to 10 per cent. of the revenue collections.\n\nA year later Muhammad Sh\u0101h ascended the throne of Delhi, but the\ngovernment was still in the hands of the two Saiyids. Chin Kilij Kh\u0101n, afterwards known as Asaf J\u0101h, who had distinguished himself in the later wars of Aurangzeb, had been appointed viceroy of the Deccan under the title of Niz\u0101m-ul-mulk, but was opposed by the court party at Delhi, who sent secret instructions to Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, governor of Kh\u0101ndesh, urging him to withstand Asaf J\u0101h by force of arms. In 1724 a battle was fought at Shakarkhelda in Buld\u0101na District, in which Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n was utterly defeated. This battle established the virtual independence of Asaf J\u0101h, the founder of the line of the Niz\u0101ms of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, who, to celebrate his victory, renamed the scene of it Fathkhelda, or \u2018the village of victory\u2019; and from that day Ber\u0101r has always been nominally subject to the Niz\u0101m. The Bhonsla R\u0101j\u0101s of N\u0101gpur posted their officers all over the province; they occupied it with their troops; they collected more than half the revenue, and they fought among themselves for the right to collect; but the Niz\u0101m constantly maintained his title as de jure ruler of the country, with the exception of Mehkar and some parganas to the south, which were ceded to the Peshw\u0101 in 1760 after the battle of Udgir, and Umarkhed and other parganas ceded in 1795 after the battle of Kardla. This struggle between Mughal and Mar\u0101th\u0101 for supremacy in Ber\u0101r commenced in 1737 between Asaf J\u0101h and Raghuji Bhonsla. It ended in 1803, when, after the defeat of the Mar\u0101th\u0101 confederacy at Assaye and Argaon, and the capture of G\u0101wilgarh by General Arthur Wellesley, the Bhonsla R\u0101j\u0101 signed a treaty by which he resigned all claim to territory and revenue west of the Wardh\u0101, G\u0101wilgarh and Narn\u0101la, with a small tract of land afterwards exchanged, remaining in his possession.\n\nThe injury caused to Ber\u0101r by the wars of the eighteenth century must have been wide and deep. Described in the Ain-i-Akbari as highly cultivated and in parts populous, supposed by M. de Thevenot in 1667 to be one of the wealthiest portions of the Mughal empire, it fell on evil days before the close of the seventeenth century. Cultivation fell off just when the finances were strained by the long wars; the local revenue officers rebelled; the army became mutinous; and the Mar\u0101th\u0101s easily plundered a weak province when they had severed its sinews by cutting off its trade. Wherever the Mughals appointed a collector the Mar\u0101th\u0101s appointed another, and both claimed the revenue, while foragers from each side exacted forced contributions, so that the harassed cultivator often threw up his land and helped to plunder his neighbour. The Mar\u0101th\u0101s by these means succeeded in fixing their hold on the province; but its resources were ruined, and its people were seriously demoralized by a r\u00e9gime of barefaced plunder and fleecing without the semblance of principle or stability.\n\nBy the partition treaty of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d (1804) the Ber\u0101r territories ceded by the Bhonsla R\u0101j\u0101 were made over to the Niz\u0101m. Some\ntracts about Sindkhed and J\u0101lna were also restored by Sindhia to the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State.\n\nThe Treaty of Deogaon had put a stop to actual warfare in Ber\u0101r, but the people continued to suffer intermittently from the inroads of Pind\u0101ris, and incessantly from misgovernment; for the province had been restored to the Niz\u0101m just at the time when confusion in his territories was at its worst. 'The Niz\u0101m's territories,' wrote General Wellesley in January, 1804, 'are one complete chaos from the God\u0101vari to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d'; and again, 'Sindkhed is a nest of thieves; the situation of this country is shocking; the people are starving in hundreds, and there is no government to afford the slightest relief.'\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war of 1817-8, which did not seriously affect the tranquillity of Ber\u0101r, a treaty was made in 1822 which fixed the Wardh\u0101 river as the eastern frontier of the province, the Melgh\u0101t and the subjacent districts in the plains being restored to Hyder\u0101b\u0101d in exchange for the districts east of the Wardh\u0101 and those held by the Peshw\u0101. The treaty also extinguished the Mar\u0101th\u0101 claim to chauth.\n\nBetween 1803 and 1820 the revenue of Ber\u0101r had declined by one-half owing to the raids of Pind\u0101ris and Bhils, while the administration was most wasteful, no less than 26,000 troops being quartered on the province. General Wellesley had advised in 1804 that the local governor should be compelled to reform his military establishment, foretelling the aggravation of civil disorder by the sudden cessation of arms. The disbanded troops were too strong for the weak police, while the spread of British dominion established order all around, and drove all the brigands of India within the limits of Native States. So Ber\u0101r was harried from time to time by bands of men under leaders who on various pretexts, but always with the real object of plunder, set up the standard of rebellion. Sometimes the British irregular forces had to take the field against them, as, for instance, in 1849, when a man styling himself Appa S\u0101hib Bhonsla, ex-R\u0101j\u0101 of N\u0101gpur, was with difficulty captured. Throughout these troubles the Hindu deshmukhs and other pargana officials were openly disloyal to the Niz\u0101m's government, doing their best to thwart his commanders and abetting the pretenders. The last fight against open rebels took place at Chichamba, near Risod, in 1859.\n\nAfter the old war-time came the 'cankers of a calm world,' for then began the palmy days of the great farmers-general at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. Messrs. Palmer & Co. overshadowed the Government and very nearly proved too strong for Sir Charles Metcalfe when he laid the axe to the root of their power. The firm had made large loans at 24 per cent. for the numerous cavalry maintained in Ber\u0101r. Then Puran Mal, a great money-lender of Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, got most of Ber\u0101r in farm; but in 1839 he was turned out, under pressure from the Resident, in favour of\nMessrs. Pestonji & Co. These were enterprising Parsi merchants, who in 1825-6 made the first considerable exportation of cotton from Berar to Bombay. They gave liberal advances to cotton-growers, set up presses at Kh\u0101ngaon and other places, and took up, generally, the export of produce from the Nizam's country. In 1841 Chand\u016b L\u0101l, the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d minister, gave them large assignments of revenue in Berar in repayment of loans to the State; but in 1843 the minister resigned, having conducted the State to the verge of bankruptcy, and Pestonji was subsequently forced to give up his Berar districts.\n\nAll these proceedings damaged the State's credit, as Chand\u016b L\u0101l's financing had hampered its revenue; and in 1843 and several succeeding years the pay of the Irregular Force maintained under the treaty of 1800 had to be advanced by the British Government. In 1850 it had fallen again into heavy arrears, and in 1853 the debt due to the British Government on account of this pay and other unsatisfied claims amounted to 45 lakhs. The bankruptcy of the State disorganized the administration, and the non-payment of the troops continued to be a serious political evil. Accordingly, in 1853, a new treaty was concluded with the Niz\u0101m, under which the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent was to be maintained by the British Government, while for the payment of this force, and in satisfaction of the other claims, districts yielding a gross revenue of 50 lakhs were assigned to the Company. The Berar districts 'assigned' by this treaty are now popularly understood to form the province of Berar, which was administered on behalf of the Government of India by the Resident at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, though they coincide in extent neither with the Berar of the Niz\u0101ms nor with the imperial S\u016bbah. The territory made over under this treaty comprised, besides Berar, the districts of Dh\u0101r\u0101seo and the Raich\u016br D\u014d\u0101b. It was agreed that accounts should be annually rendered to the Niz\u0101m, and that any surplus revenue should be paid to him. His Highness was released from the obligation of furnishing a large force in time of war, and the Contingent ceased to be a part of his army, and became an auxiliary force kept up by the British Government for his use.\n\nThe provisions of the treaty of 1853, which required the submission of annual accounts to the Niz\u0101m, were, however, productive of much inconvenience and embarrassing discussions. Difficulties had also arisen regarding the levy of customs duties under the commercial treaty of 1802. To remove these difficulties, and at the same time to reward the Niz\u0101m for his services in 1857, a new treaty was concluded in 1860, by which a debt of 50 lakhs due from him was cancelled; and he also received the territory of S\u016br\u0101pur, which had been confiscated for the rebellion of the R\u0101j\u0101, and the districts of Dh\u0101r\u0101seo and Raich\u016br were restored to him. On the other hand, he ceded certain districts on the left bank of the God\u0101vari, traffic on which river was to be free\nfrom all duties, and agreed that Ber\u0101r should be held in trust for the purposes specified in the treaty of 1853.\n\nThe history of Ber\u0101r from 1853 to 1902 is marked by no important political events other than the changes made by the treaty of 1860. Its smooth course was scarcely ruffled even by the cyclone of 1857. Whatever secret elements of disturbance may have been at work, the country remained calm, measuring its behaviour not by Delhi, but by Hyder\u0101b\u0101d. In 1858 T\u0101nti\u0101 Top\u012b got into the S\u0101tpur\u0101 Hills, and tried to break away to the south that he might stir up the Deccan, but he was headed at all outlets and never reached the Ber\u0101r valley.\n\nThe management of Ber\u0101r by the Niz\u0101m's officials had been worse than the contemporary administration of the adjoining N\u0101gpur territory, which was, during a long minority, under British regency, and was subsequently well governed until it lapsed. There had consequently been wholesale emigration from Eastern Ber\u0101r to the Districts beyond the Wardh\u0101. When Ber\u0101r came under British management the emigrants, with the usual attachment of Indian cultivators to their patrimony, the value of which had in this case been enhanced by much of it having remained fallow for some time, returned in thousands to Ber\u0101r. This was only one mode out of several, which it would be tedious to detail, whereby cultivation was restored and augmented. Then supervened the American Civil War. The cultivation of cotton received an extraordinary stimulus, the cultivators importing their supply of food-grains so that all available land might be devoted to the cultivation of the more profitable crop. Cotton requires much manual toil in weeding, picking, ginning, packing and the like, and the increase in the area under it created a great demand for rural labour, which operated to raise the standard of wages. A great export of cotton to Bombay was soon established; and as the importation of foreign produce was far from proportionate, much of the return consisted of cash and bullion, so that prices rose and the labouring and producing classes were rapidly enriched. At the same time a line of railway was being laid across the province, causing the employment of all labour, skilled and unskilled, that could be got on the spot, and also introducing a large foreign element. The people became prosperous and contented, and progress in all departments was vast and rapid.\n\nThe Census Report of 1881 showed material advance. The cultivated area had increased by 50 per cent. and the land revenue by 42 per cent. since 1867. But although Ber\u0101r escaped the widespread famine of 1876\u20138, the poorer classes undoubtedly suffered much hardship at that time, and cattle died by thousands for want of fodder. The next ten years were, on the whole, prosperous, though cholera, which generally appeared in an intense form every other year, caused great mortality.\nThere was, however, an increase in trade, cultivation, and manufactures, and the population rose by 8 per cent. The ten years preceding 1901 were not, owing to natural causes, marked by a general increase in prosperity, but the province displayed considerable stability and power of resistance. There was but one year in the decade, 1898, which could be described as very favourable, and even then the rabi crops partially failed. The other nine years were marked by unseasonable or deficient rainfall, poor harvests, sickness, and high mortality, culminating in 1899 and 1900, when famine was sore in the land. The population decreased by 5 per cent. during the decade. But, notwithstanding all this, other statistics show steady progress and development. Cultivation has extended; the value of the import and export trade has increased; and the number of steam factories has risen by 84 per cent.\n\nIt had gradually become apparent since 1860 that the maintenance of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent on its old footing as a separate force was inexpedient and unnecessary, and also that the administration of so small a province as Ber\u0101r as a separate unit was very costly. In 1902, therefore, a fresh agreement was entered into with the Niz\u0101m. This agreement reaffirmed His Highness's rights over Ber\u0101r, which, instead of being indefinitely 'assigned' to the Government of India, was leased in perpetuity on an annual rental of 25 lakhs; and authorized the Government of India to administer the province in such manner as it might deem desirable, as well as to redistribute, reduce, reorganize, and control the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent, due provision being made, as stipulated in the treaty of 1853, for the protection of His Highness's dominions. In pursuance of this agreement the Contingent ceased, in March, 1903, to be a separate force, and was reorganized and redistributed as an integral part of the Indian army.\n\nIn October, 1903, Ber\u0101r was transferred to the administration of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. For the present the rental paid to the Niz\u0101m is charged with an annual debit of 10 lakhs, towards the repayment of loans made by the Government of India for famine expenditure in Ber\u0101r and for famine and other expenditure in the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State. When these loans have been repaid, the Niz\u0101m will receive the full rent of 25 lakhs. The advantages secured to him by the new agreement are manifest. His rights over Ber\u0101r have been reaffirmed, and he will receive 25 lakhs per annum, compared with a sum of between 8 and 9 lakhs which was the average surplus paid to him under the former treaties.\n\nThe principal remains of archaeological or historical interest in Ber\u0101r are the small cave monastery and the shrine of Shaikh B\u0101ba at P\u0101t\u016br; the chhatri of R\u0101j\u0101 Jai Singh and the fort at B\u0101l\u0101pur; various massive stone temples attributed to the era of the Y\u0101dava R\u0101j\u0101s of Deogiri, and locally known as Hem\u0101dpanti temples, in the Ch\u0101lukyan style; some\nJain shrines, particularly that at Sirpur; the hill forts of G\u0101w\u012blgarh and Narn\u0101la; and the mosques at Fathkheld\u0101 and Rohankhed. The principal Hem\u0101dpanti temples are those at Lon\u0101r, Mehk\u0101r, B\u0101rs\u012b T\u0101kli, and Pusad, but many others are scattered throughout the province.\n\nThe population of Ber\u0101r in 1901 was 2,754,016, or 155 persons per square mile. The distribution varies in accordance with the natural advantages of the three divisions of the province. Thus the density in the twelve t\u0101luks of the P\u0101y\u0101ng\u0101t varies from 150 to 311 persons per square mile, and that of the nine t\u0101luks of the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t from 85 to 150, while the population of the Melgh\u0101t is very sparse, the density being no more than 22 persons per square mile.\n\nThe table on the next page shows the population of the six Districts of the province in 1901. In 1905 the six Districts were rearranged; Ellichpur, W\u016bn, and B\u0101sim have been abolished, and a new District of Yeotm\u0101l has been formed. The present distribution of area and population will be found in the several District articles.\n\nThe term 'village' denotes in Ber\u0101r the area demarcated for revenue purposes as a mauza or kasba, mazras or hamlets being reckoned for census purposes as part of the principal village. The term 'town' includes every municipality and civil station and villages with a population of 5,000 or more. The villages are agricultural communities, each with its hereditary officers and servants, the former paid by a percentage on collections and the latter by customary dues in kind. The gaoth\u0101n, or village site, on which the houses are collected together, is not surrounded by a wall; but each village has its garh\u012b, or fort, usually of earth, in which the village officers possess hereditary rights, but which was formerly used as a place of refuge by the whole community in troublous times.\n\nThe first Census of Ber\u0101r, which was taken in 1867, disclosed a total population of 2,227,654. By 1881 this had increased to 2,672,673, and by 1891 to 2,897,491. The Census of 1901 showed a decrease to 2,754,016, or by 4.9 per cent., due to the famines of 1896\u20137 and 1899\u20131900, and to abnormally high mortality from disease in the years 1894\u20137 and 1900. One feature of the decade was the gravitation of an unusually large proportion of the people towards the towns, the percentage of urban population to the whole being 15.2 in 1901, compared with 12.5 in 1881.\n\nThe deductions to be drawn from the age statistics in the Report on the Census of 1901 may be thus summarized: infant mortality is greatest between the ages of one and two; the mortality among children born in the first half of the decade ending 1901 was considerably less than that among children born in the second half, the difference being attributable\n### Distribution of Population in Berar, 1901\n\n| District | Area in square miles | Number of towns | Number of villages | Total Population | Urban Population |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|          |                     |                 |                    | Persons | Males | Females | Persons | Males | Females | Persons | Males | Females |\n| Amravati | 2,759               | 15              | 1,057              | 307,104 | 135,173 | 172,931 | 70,756 | 35,378 | 35,378 | 135,173 | 64,447 | 70,756 |\n| Akola    | 2,678               | 10              | 966                | 307,104 | 135,173 | 172,931 | 70,756 | 35,378 | 35,378 | 135,173 | 64,447 | 70,756 |\n| Ellichpur| 2,605               | 6               | 788                | 286,693 | 124,156 | 162,537 | 69,153 | 34,576 | 34,576 | 124,156 | 60,997 | 69,153 |\n| Balhaina | 2,809               | 6               | 870                | 265,917 | 122,958 | 142,959 | 60,997 | 30,499 | 30,499 | 122,958 | 59,959 | 60,997 |\n| Wtn      | 3,910               | 4               | 1,205              | 245,830 | 122,915 | 122,915 | 59,959 | 29,980 | 29,980 | 122,915 | 59,959 | 60,997 |\n| Bastin   | 2,949               | 3               | 824                | 225,638 | 112,819 | 112,819 | 54,358 | 27,160 | 27,160 | 112,819 | 54,358 | 58,461 |\n| **Total**| **17,710**          | **44**          | **5,710**          | **1,359,716** | **679,451** | **679,451** | **216,994** | **108,457** | **108,457** | **679,451** | **350,997** | **328,454** |\n\nPersons per square mile in rural areas:\n\n- Amravati: 179\n- Akola: 134\n- Ellichpur: 81\n- Balhaina: 136\n- Wtn: 112\n- Bastin: 132\nto the harder conditions of life in the second quinquennium; there is a general tendency to understate the age of marriageable girls; the last quinquennial period of life exhibited in the tables (55\u201360) is the most fatal; and famine and disease have principally affected the youngest and the oldest of the females, and the youngest and those over thirty among the males.\n\nThe registration of births and deaths is carried out with greater accuracy in Ber\u0101r than in most of the Provinces of British India proper, though the entire population is not under registration. The following table shows the birth and death-rates and the principal fatal diseases in 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1903:\n\n| Year | Population under registration | Ratio of registered births per 1,000 | Ratio of registered deaths per 1,000 | Deaths per 1,000 from |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|      |                               |                                     |                                     | Cholera | Smallpox | Fever | Bowel complaints |\n| 1881 | 2,630,018                     | 39\u00b79                                | 29\u00b71                                | 1\u00b73     | 0\u00b71      | 15\u00b78  | 4\u00b75               |\n| 1891 | 2,840,406                     | 42\u00b78                                | 40\u00b76                                | 2\u00b78     | 0\u00b71      | 17\u00b75  | 7\u00b77               |\n| 1901 | 2,717,346                     | 30\u00b78                                | 27\u00b76                                | 0\u00b7006   | 0\u00b707     | 13\u00b79  | 4\u00b74               |\n| 1903 | 2,721,342                     | 48\u00b716                               | 41\u00b774                               | 0\u00b703    | 0\u00b704     | 11\u00b757 | 5\u00b774              |\n\nThe variation between the birth and death-rates in the different Districts is not constant, and it can hardly be said that any one District is conspicuously more healthy or unhealthy than the rest. The birth-rate seems to be usually highest in Buld\u0101na. Throughout the early part of the decade ending 1901 birth and death-rates were consistently lower in Wun than elsewhere; but this was probably due to defective registration, as the District is no longer exceptional in this respect. Both birth and death-rates were seriously affected by the famine of 1899\u20131900.\n\nThe most prevalent disease is fever, the deaths from which about equal in number those from all other causes. Bowel complaints are the next most frequent cause of death. Plague did not appear in Ber\u0101r till 1903, and the Administration, in coping with it, profited by the experience gained in other Provinces. Evacuation and disinfection were the principal measures adopted.\n\nMales outnumber females by 34,584. It has been observed since 1881 that male births outnumber female, but that throughout the first decade of life females outnumber males. It may therefore be inferred, allowing for the habit of understating the age of marriageable daughters, that female infanticide is unknown in Ber\u0101r. The ratio of females to males is less in towns than in villages, for the towns contain male workers who leave their families behind them. The same circumstances affect the population of certain taluks. The greater the\ncommercial element in a taluk, the less is the proportion of females to males.\n\nThe following table gives statistics of civil condition for 1891 and 1901:\n\n| Civil condition | Persons | Males | Females | Persons | Males | Females |\n|-----------------|---------|-------|---------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Unmarried       | 943,040 | 572,594 | 370,446 | 897,929 | 552,329 | 345,600 |\n| Married         | 1,044,458 | 833,575 | 810,883 | 1,450,454 | 752,746 | 755,708 |\n| Widowed         | 309,993 | 85,657 | 224,336 | 347,633 | 89,225 | 258,408 |\n| Total           | 2,897,491 | 1,491,826 | 1,405,665 | 2,754,016 | 1,394,300 | 1,359,716 |\n\nOf the male population 40, 54, and 6 per cent., and of the female 25, 56, and 19 per cent. are single, married, and widowed respectively. Married males and females are fairly evenly balanced, so that it is evident that polygamy, though permitted by all the religions the followers of which are numerically important, is but sparingly practised. No relics of polyandry survive. Widow remarriage is prohibited, not only among the higher castes of Hindus, but also among the well-to-do in inferior castes, such as members of deshmukh families among Kunbis. It is allowed and extensively practised among most of the agricultural castes, and is known as p\u0101t or mohtur, in contradistinction to lagna, a word which is applied only to the marriage of a virgin bride. Among some tribes, Banj\u0101r\u0101s and Gonds for example, the levirate prevails, i.e. it is the duty of a man to take to wife the widow of his deceased elder brother, though to marry a younger brother's widow would be regarded as incestuous. Child marriage is the general rule among the higher castes of Hindus. Animists usually defer marriage until after the attainment of puberty, and allow greater freedom of choice to the parties concerned.\n\nThe joint-family system is the rule among Hindus in Ber\u0101r. Ignorant Musalm\u0101ns too will assert in civil suits that they are members of an undivided family when they believe that the assertion may suit their interests.\n\nMar\u0101th\u012b is spoken by nearly 80 per cent. of the population. The Musalm\u0101ns, 212,000 in number, speak a corrupt dialect of Urdu, popularly known as Musalm\u0101n\u012b; other dialects of Western Hindi, returned as Hind\u012b and Hindust\u0101n\u012b, are spoken by immigrants from the United and Central Provinces. The M\u0101rw\u0101r\u012b dialect of R\u0101jasth\u0101n\u012b was spoken in 1901 by 41,521 traders and bankers from M\u0101rw\u0101r. Gipsy dialects, of which Banj\u0101r\u012b or Labh\u0101n\u012b is the most important, were spoken by 68,879 persons. Of Dravidian languages Gond\u012b and its dialects, of which the principal is Kol\u0101m\u012b, were spoken by 83,217 persons, and Telugu by 85,431, mostly dwellers in the south of W\u016bn.\nDistrict on the banks of the Pengang\u0101. The only important Munda language is Kork\u016b, spoken by the Kork\u016bs in the Melgh\u0101t and its neighbourhood. Nih\u0101li is a moribund language of uncertain affinities, returned as the mother-tongue of 91 Nih\u0101ls, who, however, probably speak Kork\u016b, defining it as Nih\u0101li. English was returned as the mother tongue of 653 persons.\n\nIn this small province nearly four hundred castes and tribes are represented. The three chief groups coincide generally with the main religious divisions, Hindu, Muhammadan, and Animistic. Musalm\u0101ns call for little notice in this connexion. Many of them are descendants of converted Hindus. Shaikhs number 134,000; Path\u0101ns, 52,000; Saiyids, 19,000; and Mughals, 4,000.\n\nThe Kunb\u012bs, the great cultivating caste of the Provinces, are the most important of the Hindu castes. They number 791,000, and predominate in every t\u0101luk except the Melgh\u0101t. Very similar to them in all respects are the M\u0101lis, numbering 193,000. The Kunbi is usually of medium height, dark-skinned from exposure, and wiry. As a cultivator he is moderately industrious, but devoid of enterprise and intelligent energy. Next to the Kunbis the Mah\u0101rs, numbering 351,000, are the most numerous caste. The Mah\u0101r occupies an important, if humble, place in the village system of the Deccan. Socially he is regarded as an unclean outcaste whose touch is pollution. Similar to the Mah\u0101rs, but even more unclean, are the M\u0101ngs, who number 49,000. Other numerically important castes are: Telis (77,000), Dhangars (75,000), Br\u0101hmans (73,000), Banj\u0101r\u0101s (60,000), W\u0101nis (41,000), and R\u0101jputs (36,000). The indigenous R\u0101jputs are not favourable specimens of their class, and it is doubtful whether their claim to pure descent would be admitted in R\u0101jasth\u0101n.\n\nThe two principal aboriginal tribes are the Gonds and the Kork\u016bs, the former ordinary Dravidian and the latter Munda. The Gonds number 69,000, or, if the cognate Kol\u0101ms and Parah\u0101ns be included, 96,000. They are very dark and usually slight and undersized, though exceptions are found among the division known as R\u0101j Gonds. The Kork\u016bs number 26,000, and have their home in the north of the province among the G\u0101wilgarh hills. Their physique is superior to that of the Gonds, and they are well-built and muscular, but their personal appearance is not pleasing. They are distinguished principally by their small eyes, large mouths, flat noses, and large and prominent ears.\n\nThe table on next page gives statistics for religions in 1891 and 1901. Hindus constituted 86.7 per cent. of the total population in the latter year. Since 1891 Hindus have lost absolutely 143,775 persons, Musalm\u0101ns have gained 4,359, and Animists have lost 7,144. All other religions, the followers of which are not numerous, have\ngained in all 3,085. There has been a large increase in Sikhs, which is rather apparent than real, as it is attributable solely to more correct enumeration. The increase among Musalmans seems to have been due partly to their superior fecundity and partly to proselytizing efforts.\n\n|          | 1891 Persons | Percentage | 1901 Persons | Percentage |\n|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|------------|\n| Hindus   | 2,531,791    | 87.3       | 2,388,016    | 86.7       |\n| Animists | 137,108      | 4.7        | 129,964      | 4.7        |\n| Musalmans| 207,681      | 7.1        | 212,040      | 7.6        |\n| Christians\u2014Native | 711 | 0.2 | 1,748 | 0.06 |\n| Other    | 648          | 0.2        | 627          | 0.02       |\n| Others   | 19,552       | 0.6        | 21,621       | 0.7        |\n\nOf all the gods of the Hindu pantheon Mah\u0101deo and M\u0101ruti (Hanuman) probably receive the most attention. The latter has a shrine in every village. The cultivator propitiates Kh\u0101t Deo, the fertilizing god, who has his habitation in a white stone set up in a field, and local gods such as Chindiya Deo, \u2018the lord of tatters,\u2019 are worshipped. The \u2018godlings of disease\u2019 are propitiated as occasion arises. The only heterodox sect which calls for notice is that of the Mah\u0101nubhavas, or black-robed devotees, of whom a description is given in the account of R\u012btpur, their principal place of pilgrimage. This movement, which is a protest against polytheism, Br\u0101hmanism, and, in a less degree, the caste system, is rapidly declining. Isl\u0101m presents no extraordinary features in Ber\u0101r. Here, as elsewhere in India, the Musalm\u0101n villager has borrowed or inherited from his Hindu neighbour or ancestor many practices which precians would condemn as superstitious. The Gonds and Kork\u016bs, though still Animists, are tinged with Hinduism and worship Mah\u0101deo as well as other Hindu gods, and the Kork\u016bs worship also their own ancestors, both male and female.\n\nThe oldest Hindu temples of Ber\u0101r are the Hem\u0101dpanti, already referred to. More recent temples have no distinctive features. In mosques examples of both the Path\u0101n and the Mughal styles are found.\n\nThere are 14 Christian missions at work in the province\u2014two Roman Catholic, one Church of England, and eleven other Protestant, among whom the Methodists and Presbyterians are the most important. The activity of these missions is evidenced by the fact that native Christians more than doubled in number between 1891 and 1901. The Christian missionaries did excellent work in the famines of 1896\u20137 and 1899\u20131900. For purposes of ecclesiastical jurisdiction Ber\u0101r is in the Anglican and Roman Catholic dioceses of N\u0101gpur. Of the Christians in 1901, 888 belonged to the Roman, and 626 to the Anglican Church.\nAgriculture supports 73 per cent. of the population, and of every 100 persons so supported 71 are workers. The preparation and supply of material substances provide a living for \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\) per cent. of the people, the principal sub-orders under this head being, in the order of their importance, (1) cotton; (2) textile fabrics and dress; (3) food, drink, and stimulants; (4) wood, cane, and leaves. Commerce supports \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) per cent., and unskilled labour, not agricultural, nearly 2 per cent.\n\nThe food of the agricultural and labouring classes consists chiefly of unleavened cakes of jowar (great millet) meal, with a seasoning of green vegetables, onions, gh\u012b, chillies, or pulse, or a combination of two or more of these. Milk is an important article of diet; wheat and rice are luxuries. Goat\u2019s flesh is extensively eaten by Musalm\u0101ns, and less so by those Hindus to whom flesh is not forbidden as an article of diet. Few Musalm\u0101ns, except those living in towns and in some of the larger villages, eat beef. It is necessary for those in smaller villages to respect the prejudices of their Hindu neighbours, many of which they have adopted. The Mah\u0101rs, who are scavengers, are habitual eaters of beef in the form of carrion.\n\nThe ordinary dress of the cultivator or labourer consists of a dhoti, a short jacket, an uparna or upper cloth, and a red or white turban, the former being the favourite colour. The jacket is often discarded. Br\u0101hmans and other respectable castes wear long coats, and finer uparnas and turbans. Musalm\u0101ns frequently, though not invariably, substitute pa\u012bj\u0101mas and a long coat for the dhoti and short jacket, and their turbans display a greater variety of colour. The dress of the women consists of a lugade and a choli. The former is the principal garment and corresponds to the s\u0101r\u012b, being tied round the waist; the long end is taken over the head, and the front of the portion forming the skirt is carried back between the legs and tucked in at the waist behind, giving the wearer a singularly bunchy and ungraceful appearance. The choli is a scanty bodice which confines the breasts. Muhammadan women often wear the common combination of trousers, shift, or choli, and scarf, which is tied round the waist and carried over the head. Gond and Kol\u0101m women do not wear the choli, but conceal the breasts by drawing the end of the lugade across them. The dress of the Banj\u0101r\u0101 women is especially picturesque.\n\nThe dwelling-houses of the agricultural classes are mostly of sun-dried brick roofed with thatch or tiles. Dh\u0101b\u0101s, or flat roofs of earth, are also common. The houses of labourers consist of one or two rooms, with a small \u0101ngan or yard enclosed by a mud wall in front of the house. The houses of the well-to-do are more pretentious, consisting of several rooms opening into a rectangular courtyard, along one side of which the cattle are usually stalled. The poorest classes live in huts of hurdles or grass mats daubed with mud. In the early part of the hot\nseason, while the grain is being threshed and garnered, cultivators move with their cattle into their fields, where they live in spacious sheds in the vicinity of their threshing-floors.\n\nThe higher castes among the Hindus burn their dead; Musalm\u0101ns, Hindus of the lower castes, and aboriginal tribes bury them. The Kork\u016bs erect posts of teak, curiously carved, at the heads of graves. Among the Mah\u0101nubhavas and some other orders of ascetics the dead are buried in salt, in a sitting posture.\n\nThe tastes of the agriculturist are principally domestic; he has few amusements beyond his family circle except the enjoyment of village gossip, a weekly trip to the nearest market village, an occasional visit to a jatra or religious fair, or, more rarely, a pilgrimage to a shrine of more than local celebrity.\n\nThe principal festivals observed are the M\u0101ndosi, the Akshayatritya, the N\u0101gapanchami, the Pol\u0101, the Mah\u0101lakshmi, the Pitrapaksha, or feast to manes of male ancestors, the Dasara, the Div\u0101li, the Sivar\u0101tri, and the Shimg\u0101 or Holi. The three most important feasts to the cultivator are the Holi, the Pol\u0101, and the Dasara; and at these burning questions of social precedence, often ending in criminal complaints, arise between different branches of the families of p\u0101tels or hereditary headmen of villages. At the Pol\u0101 festival the plough cattle are worshipped. A rope called toran is then stretched across two upright poles, and the cattle of the villagers, gaily decorated, are led beneath it, headed by those belonging to members of the p\u0101tel\u2019s family in the order of their seniority.\n\nHindus of all castes in Ber\u0101r have three names. The first is the personal name and corresponds to the Christian name of a European, the second is the father\u2019s personal name, and the third is the family surname. Thus Ganpat Raoji Sindhya would be Ganpat, the son of Raoji, of the Sindhya family or clan.\n\nThe three natural divisions of Ber\u0101r have already been described. The Melgh\u0101t or northern division is extremely rugged, and is broken into a succession of hills and deep valleys. The hilly portion consists of basaltic and calcareous rock, and the soil in the valleys and ravines is a light brown alluvium, overlying basalt accumulated from superficial rainwash from the hills. This light-brown soil, extending to about 8 or 10 miles from the foot of the hills towards the valley of the P\u016brna, is cultivable, but is less rich than the soil of the valley itself. The B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t, or southern division, is formed of undulating high land of the Deccan trap. The plateaux are covered with fairly rich soil, and the soil of the intermediate valleys is an alluvium of loam of remarkably fine quality and very suitable for wheat.\n\nThe P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t, or central valley of Ber\u0101r, contains the best land in\nthe province: a deep, rich, black, and exceedingly fertile loam, often of great depth, with very thick underlying strata of yellow clay and lime. Where this rich soil does not exist, as in the immediate vicinity of hills, murum and trap are found with a shallow upper crust of inferior light soil. A great deal of the Purna alluvium produces efflorescences, chiefly of salts of soda, and many of the wells sunk in this tract have brackish water. The climate of Berar has already been described. It may be briefly characterized as intensely hot and dry in the months of March, April, and May, and temperate for the rest of the year, with moderate rainfall between June and October.\n\nCotton, jowar (great millet), tuar (pulse), and sesamum are the kharif or monsoon crops; and wheat, linseed, and gram the principal rabi or cold-season crops. In 1903\u20134, of the total area cropped, nearly 87 per cent. was devoted to kharif and 13 per cent. to rabi, only \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) per cent. being irrigated.\n\nThe areas sown with kharif and rabi crops vary according to the rainfall and market prices, and their extent is also partly regulated by the system of rotation of crops in vogue. If the rains begin well in June, a large area is sown with kharif, but if they are late more land is kept for rabi. Thus in 1891, 1,390 square miles were sown with wheat, the principal rabi crop, while in 1903\u20134, after several years of inadequate late rains, the area so sown had fallen to 710 square miles.\n\nThe cultivator generally commences the preparation of his field in January. The rich black soil of the plains is not worked with the nangar or heavy plough for several years together, unless it should be overgrown with grass or weeds; but the lighter soil of the upland country is ploughed nearly every year, especially when the land is reserved for a rabi crop. Ploughing is generally commenced soon after the crop of the year has been removed from the ground; if it be deferred longer, the soil dries and hardens and becomes difficult to work. Land that has been lying fallow cannot be ploughed until the first monsoon rain has fallen. Parallel furrows are not considered sufficient for hard soil, which is therefore cross-ploughed, the second operation being at right angles to the first. Harrowing succeeds, or, in the case of fields which do not require ploughing every year, takes the place of ploughing. The first harrowing is done with the moghada, a large, heavy harrow drawn by four bullocks. This turns up the earth in large clods, and brings roots, grass, and weeds to the surface. The soil is then cross-harrowed with the wakhar, a lighter implement drawn by two bullocks, which breaks up the clods and cleans the soil. In some cases the soil is harrowed again at intervals of a few days, in order that it may be thoroughly levelled and pulverized. The kharif sowings take place immediately after the first regular monsoon fall of rain in June, and the rabi sowings in September or October.\nWeeding is commenced when the soil dries during the first break in the rains. It is done with the daora, a two-bladed hoe which is drawn by two bullocks, and removes the weeds from two of the interstices between the rows of plants at once, the weeds growing among the plants being removed by hand. Three or four weedings in a season are generally considered sufficient, but the more industrious cultivators often use the hoe every fortnight until the crop is sufficiently strong to smother all surface weeds.\n\nCotton pods are usually ready for picking about the end of October, and this light work is generally done by women and children. Payment is, as a rule, made in kind, each labourer receiving from one-twelfth to one-eighth of the day's picking. From the short staple variety of cotton which the Ber\u0101r cultivator now grows he can obtain, if the crop is good, from five to seven pickings at intervals of fifteen or twenty days; but the superior bani and jari varieties, the latter of which is now extinct in Ber\u0101r, will not yield a second picking under a month, and the crop is generally exhausted in three pickings. The cultivator finds that the short staple is easier to raise and pays him just as well, for although he gets a lower price the crop is more plentiful.\n\nBefore the establishment of ginning factories in the province almost every cultivator had his own seed for sowing cleaned by hand. Ginning by steam-power was first introduced in 1887\u20138, in which year there were only four factories working. In 1901 these had increased to 121, and there is every prospect of a further development of this industry.\n\nJow\u0101r ripens early in December, and is reaped by men, the ears being afterwards separated from the stalks by women. The stalks, called kadba or kadbi, are stacked, and furnish the principal fodder-supply for cattle. The ears are conveyed to the threshing-floor, where bullocks tread out the grain, moving round a central pole. Six bullocks can thresh a hhandi (about 14 cwt.) in two days. The threshed grain is winnowed in a breeze. One man stands on a tripod, while another hands up to him a basketful of grain from the threshing-floor. As he slowly empties the basket, the chaff is carried away by the wind and the grain falls to the ground.\n\nOf the total population of Ber\u0101r in 1901, 73\u00b72 per cent. were supported by agriculture. The figures are as follows:\n\n| Persons interested in land, landholders, tenants, co-sharers, &c. | 561,912 |\n| Agricultural labourers, &c. | 1,452,221 |\n| Growers of fruit, vegetables, &c. | 586 |\n| **Total** | **2,014,719** |\n\nThe principal crops in the order of their importance are cotton, jow\u0101r, wheat, linseed, gram, tuar or arhar, and sesamum. Jow\u0101r and wheat are the staple food-grains, rice and bajra, and, among pulses, tuar.\nand gram, being subsidiary food-crops. Oilseeds are represented by sesamum and linseed; fibres by cotton; condiments by chillies; and drugs and narcotics by tobacco. The cotton crop comes into the market at the end of October or beginning of November, and the supply is maintained by successive pickings throughout the cold season. Jowar is not available till later, about January and the beginning of February. Owing to recent years of famine and scarcity, there has been an increase in the area under jowar. In 1903-4 jowar occupied 4,414 square miles, or 38 per cent. of the whole cultivated area of the province; and cotton 4,455 square miles, also 38 per cent.\n\nThe approximate yield per acre of the principal crops is as follows, to the nearest hundredweight: cotton, uncleaned 4; cleaned 1; jowar, 8; wheat, 6; linseed, 4; gram, 6; sesamum, 3; tuar, 3.\n\nThe Berar cultivator manures very little, not because he fails to appreciate the advantages to be derived from manure, but because he is unable to obtain a sufficient supply. Cattle-dung is generally the only kind procurable, and so much of this is used as fuel that little remains for the fields.\n\nIn 1903-4 only 0.7 per cent. of the cropped area was irrigated, wells being practically the only source of irrigation, which is confined, with few exceptions, to garden produce.\n\nThe necessity of a rotation of crops, to prevent exhaustion of the soil, is thoroughly understood. On light soil cotton and jowar are grown in alternate years; on the rich black soil of the plains cotton, jowar, and rabi crops succeed one another. In the third year a plurality of crops will probably be grown, wheat, gram, and linseed or lakkh being raised in various plots of the same field. In the present decline of rabi cultivation, cotton and jowar follow one another year after year on the same land, the fertility of which is thus much impaired, as the smaller cultivators cannot afford to let their fields lie fallow.\n\nThe following figures show the increase of cultivation in Berar during the last twenty-four years, figures being in square miles:\n\n| Year     | Assessed cultivable land in occupation | Assessed cultivable land under cultivation |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 1881     | 11,425                               | 10,377                                     |\n| 1891     | 12,053                               | 10,414                                     |\n| 1901     | 12,593                               | 10,989                                     |\n| 1903-4   | 12,717                               | 11,465                                     |\n\nThe occupied land not cropped is principally reserved for grazing. Except in Wun District, where about 7 per cent. remains to be taken up, and in the Melghat, where nearly 30 per cent. is still unoccupied, most of the cultivable land is now occupied. In Basim District much of the excess grazing land has recently been set aside for cultivation. The demand for land in Wun District is steadily increasing year by year. A decrease of cultivation in the Melghat is due to the emigration\nof Kork\u016bs in the famine of 1899\u20131900. Liberal concessions, which should tend to restore prosperity, have been granted.\n\nLittle is done towards the improvement of the quality of crops by selection of seed or by the introduction of new varieties, and there is no experimental farm in the province. As already remarked, the cultivator has allowed the quality of the cotton crop to deteriorate in order to obtain a greater yield. Seed separated from the fibre by the steaming-ginning process is said to be less fecund than the seed of hand-ginned cotton.\n\nA department of Land Records and Agriculture was formed in 1891, but its work has hitherto been confined to survey and settlement.\n\nThe benefits of the Agriculturists' Loans Act and the Land Improvement Loans Act are naturally appreciated most highly in years of scarcity and famine. The delay in disbursing loans allowed under these Acts was for a long time an obstacle in the way of their popularity, but experience gained in years of famine has led to the simplification of procedure; and there seems to be a fair field for the success of agricultural banks.\n\nThe very few horses in Ber\u0101r are inferior animals and merit no notice. Ponies are more numerous, but are weedy. An attempt was made by Government for a few years to improve the breed by keeping Arab stallions at the head-quarters of Districts, but was abandoned about 1893 as a failure. The breed of cattle proper to the province is known as Gaorani or Ber\u0101ri, of which there are two distinct varieties, the Umarda and the Kh\u0101mgaon, the former being the smaller. Animals of this breed are hardy, active, and enduring, and can easily cover 30 miles within six or eight hours. A pair will sometimes cover 40 or 50 miles in a day. The Kh\u0101mgaon breed is more adapted to heavy draught. This breed is found in the Kh\u0101mgaon, B\u0101l\u0101pur, Chikhli, Jalgaon, and part of the Akot t\u0101luks; the Umarda breed elsewhere. Indiscriminate crossing, the neglect of stock cattle, and fodder famines have contributed to the deterioration of both breeds. On the eastern borders there are very distinct indications of the influence of the Arv\u012b or Gaulgani breed, and on the southern border of that of the breeds of cattle found in the Niz\u0101m's Dominions. The recent prevalence of famine has necessitated the importation of working, and, to a smaller extent, of milch cattle. The breeds most commonly imported have been the Nim\u0101ri, Shol\u0101puri, Labb\u0101ni, and Hoshang\u0101b\u0101di; cattle of the M\u0101lwi, Gujar\u0101ti, and Surati breeds are less frequently seen.\n\nBuffaloes in the north and east of the province are of the N\u0101gpuri, and elsewhere of the Dakhani breed. Since the famine of 1899\u20131900 buffaloes have been imported from Central India. These, which are distinguished by the comparative smallness of their heads and horns, are locally known as M\u0101lwi. The sheep and goats are inferior animals,\nand the herdsmen, mostly Dhangars, lack the means and the knowledge necessary to the improvement of the breed. In towns goats of the Gujar\u0101t breed are found, and these are said to be good milch animals.\n\nLarge Umarda bullocks fetch about Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 each, small Umarda bullocks from Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, and Kh\u0101mgaon bullocks from Rs. 50 to Rs. 70. Bullocks of other breeds cost from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40 each, and cows from Rs. 10 to Rs. 25, the Ber\u0101r cow being a poor milch animal. Buffaloes are sold at from Rs. 20 to Rs. 70 each, sheep at from Rs. 2\u20138\u20130 to Rs. 3\u20138\u20130, and goats at from Rs. 3 to Rs. 10. The price of a pony varies from Rs. 25 to Rs. 50.\n\nCattle suffered severely in the scarcity of 1896\u20137 and the famine of 1899\u20131900, and the mortality was great; but large importations have gone far towards making good the deficiency. The grazing lands are sufficient, except in parts of the P\u016brna valley, such as the Akot and Dary\u0101pur t\u0101luks. In the upland country almost every village has a certain area of land set apart for free grazing. In 1903\u20134 the grazing area was 335 square miles, of which 245 were Government land set apart for free grazing and 90 were held by private occupants. Kadba, or jow\u0101r stalks, form the principal fodder-supply, and the plough cattle of the richer cultivators are partly fed on cotton seed.\n\nThere is only one cattle fair in the province, held at Wun in February or March. Some fine cattle are brought to this fair and fetch good prices; but the fair has not been regularly held of late years, for fear of importing plague. Ponies are brought in considerable numbers to the De\u016blgaon R\u0101j\u0101 fair in Buld\u0101na District, held in September in connexion with the festival of B\u0101l\u0101ji. The principal weekly cattle markets in the province are those at Umarda, Digras, and Nand\u016bra.\n\nRinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, and anthracoid diseases, such as charbon symptomatique, are the commonest infectious diseases, the two former being much more frequent than the third. Anthrax is rare, and surra has occurred only once among the ponies on a d\u0101k line. The Civil Veterinary department has published a leaflet of instructions for the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases. This has been widely circulated; a system of registration of cattle disease has been introduced; and on receipt of reports of outbreaks veterinary assistants are deputed to carry out suppressive measures and to treat the sick. Veterinary dispensaries are being established at t\u0101luk head-quarters. The publication of a manual of simple veterinary instructions in the vernacular has been delayed for want of funds. Bacteriological researches have been commenced, and inoculation with anti-rinderpest serum is carried on.\n\nIrrigation is rare except for garden crops, which are irrigated almost entirely from wells, the water-lift being the mot or leathern bucket, raised by two bullocks. The average cost of construction of a permanent well\nis from Rs. 300 to Rs. 500 when specially expensive blasting operations have not to be undertaken, or from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per foot of depth; and the area irrigated by a single well is about four acres. The depth of permanent wells varies from 20 to 90 feet. Temporary wells, such as those found in Gujar\u0101t, are not in use in Ber\u0101r, as the water is not sufficiently near to the surface; but excavations known as jhiras are very commonly made in the beds of streams, in the hot season, for the purpose of obtaining drinking-water.\n\n**Statistics of Agriculture in Ber\u0101r**\n\n(In square miles)\n\n|                      | 1881-90 (average) | 1891-1900 (average) | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total area           | 17,715           | 17,737             | 17,744 | 17,763 |\n| Total uncultivated   | 7,489            | 7,479              | 5,211  | 4,650  |\n| Cultivable, but not  | 2,830            | 2,604              | 1,270  | 2,181  |\n| Uncultivable         | 4,959            | 4,890              | 384    | 378    |\n| Total cultivated     | 10,226           | 10,228             | 10,651 | 11,465 |\n| Irrigated from canals| Nil              | Nil                | Nil    | Nil    |\n| \" \" wells            | 66               | 85                 | 106    | 58     |\n| \" \" other sources    | 2                | 2                  | 1      | 1      |\n| Total irrigated      | 68               | 87                 | 107    | 59     |\n| Unirrigated area     | 10,158           | 10,171             | 10,544 | 11,406 |\n| Cropped area.*       |                  |                    |        |        |\n| Rice                 | 35               | 57                 | 80     | 54     |\n| Wheat                | 1,346            | 926                | 389    | 707    |\n| Jow\u0101r                | 3,495            | 3,594              | 4,520  | 4,414  |\n| Pulses               | 849              | 786                | 798    | 929    |\n| Oilseeds             | 964              | 732                | 570    | 606    |\n| Cotton               | 3,266            | 3,302              | 3,819  | 4,455  |\n| Condiments and spices| 47               | 49                 | 93     | 68     |\n| Orchard and garden   | 24               | 37                 | 65     | 44     |\n| Tobacco              | 36               | 27                 | 25     | 23     |\n| Miscellaneous        | 254              | 202                | 288    | 193    |\n\n**Note.**\u2014Up to 1896 the figures are for the year ending March 31, and subsequently for the year ending July 31.\n\n* This includes the area double cropped, which amounted to only 5 square miles in 1900-1, and to 30 square miles in 1903-4.\n\nBer\u0101r being settled on the ryotw\u0101ri system, the rent of a cultivator may ordinarily be taken as the land revenue paid by him to Government. In the comparatively few villages held under other tenures, the holder of the village is not in any way restricted by legislation as regards the rent which he is entitled to demand, except that in ij\u0101ra villages those tenants who occupied their holdings when the village was leased are entitled to hold at rates not exceeding those demanded by Government for similar land in adjacent kh\u0101lsa villages. This privilege is restricted to land actually held before the lease. The control of rent by legislation has not been found necessary, for rack-renting is impossible at present. Statistics of rent actually paid in alienated villages are not\navailable; but the Government assessment per acre, which may be taken as a fair standard, varies from Rs. 2-12-0 to Rs. 1-14-0 in the P\u0101y\u0101ngh\u0101t and from Rs. 2-0-0 to Rs. 1-2-0 in the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t. Of tenants holding under occupants there are three classes: tenants paying money rent, tenants paying rent in kind on the batai system, and potl\u0101wanid\u0101rs or tenants-at-will, who pay rent either in money or in kind, the landlord meeting the revenue demand. The batai sub-tenure, which is in all respects similar to the messadria or metayer system, is very common in Ber\u0101r, but less so than formerly, as it is being replaced by leases for money, owing to much of the land having fallen into the hands of classes which do not cultivate. Statistics of the money rent usually paid are not available. The ordinary conditions of batai are that the lessor receives half the produce and pays the land revenue, while the lessee bears all the expenses of cultivation and takes the other half. Sometimes the lessee contributes a proportion, not exceeding one-third, of the land revenue, or agrees to pay half the land revenue and hands over to the lessor one-fourth only of the produce. For garden land the lessee, as a rule, delivers only one-third of the produce, as the expense of cultivating land of this class is heavy.\n\nThe average daily wage for the last thirty years is R. 0-11-7 for skilled and R. 0-3-4 for unskilled labour, the rates for the province in different years ranging between R. 0-12-9\u00bd and R. 0-9-1 and R. 0-3-11 and R. 0-2-7. The lowest rates are those of the famine year 1899-1900, when food was only less costly than it was in the following year. There was a similar though far less marked fall of wages in 1896-7, which was a year of scarcity and high prices, and it has been observed that wages do not rise with the rise in the price of food. In years of famine, however, Government steps in as an employer of labour, and provides all those in actual want with a living wage.\n\nWages vary from year to year in different Districts and localities, but the variations are not constant and are due to ephemeral and not to permanent local conditions. The Melgh\u0101t taluk, where wages are ordinarily lower than elsewhere, is an exception. Though wages have from time to time fluctuated during the past thirty years, they have, on the whole, varied so little that it cannot be said that they have been affected by the introduction of factory labour. The railway has, however, reduced wages for skilled labour, which could always command R. 1 per diem before the railway, by facilitating communication, brought the rate down to that which prevailed in other Provinces.\n\nThe average prices of the principal food-grains, in seers and chittacks per rupee, in 1903-4 were as follows: jow\u0101r, 22-1; wheat, 10-7; gram, 14-13; rice, 8-12. These are slightly above the standard, but prices were much disturbed by the famine of 1899-1900, and are returning to the normal by slow degrees. Prices vary considerably\nin different Districts from year to year; but as the variations are not constant, they furnish no materials for an estimate of the conditions of any particular locality.\n\nThe increase in the cultivated area seems to have had no effect on prices, but the natural tendency of this increase towards the reduction of prices may have been counteracted by the improvement in means of communication. This improvement has not affected the price of jow\u0101r, which is not grown for export; and though wheat is dearer now than it was thirty years ago, it is doubtful whether the rise in price is due to increased facilities for exportation. The effect of famine on prices is very marked. Thus in 1895\u20136 jow\u0101r sold at nearly 23 seers for the rupee, while in the following year, which was a season of scarcity, only $11\\frac{2}{3}$ seers could be obtained for that sum. In 1898\u20139 a rupee purchased $27\\frac{2}{3}$ seers, but in the famine year which followed it would purchase no more than $18\\frac{1}{3}$ seers, in spite of low prices in the early part of the year; while in 1900\u20131 the average rate was $11\\frac{1}{2}$ seers for the rupee, 5, 6, or 7 seers being the ordinary rate during the first six months of the year 1900, when the effects of the famine were most severely felt.\n\nAnother cause sometimes operates to reduce the price of grain. Thus, in 1880\u20131, 38 seers, and in 1884\u20135, $30\\frac{1}{2}$ seers of jow\u0101r could be purchased for a rupee. The fall in price was attributed in each case to the late rains, which in the former year made it impossible to store grain, and in the latter damaged the grain already stored.\n\nThe standard of comfort in Ber\u0101r, though not high, is probably no lower than in any other rural tract in India. The house of the middle-class clerk, for which he probably pays a rent varying from Rs. 2 to Rs. 10 a month, is scantily furnished. His food costs him but little, for he is, in all probability, a Br\u0101hman, and therefore a vegetarian; but he uses such luxuries as wheat, rice, milk, gh\u012b, and sweetmeats more freely than does the cultivator. His clothes are of fine cotton cloth, the dhoti having usually a border of silk, and he wears a silken turban; but the whole outfit is so seldom renewed that it costs him comparatively little. The cultivator's style of living and the character of his house depend on the size of his holding; but the distinction between the well-to-do and the impoverished cultivator consists largely in the quantity and quality of the jewellery worn by the women of the family. The cultivator's clothes are of coarse cotton cloth. The labourer's standard of living is similar to the cultivator's, but lower. His house is smaller and meaner, his cooking pots fewer, his food scantier, and his family jewellery less costly. There has been no perceptible change in the standard of living of these classes. So little does the cultivator understand physical comfort that when he was suddenly and temporarily enriched by the rise in the price of cotton, which was one of the results\nof the American Civil War, he was sometimes unable to find a better outlet for his wealth than the replacement of his iron ploughshares and cart-wheel tires by shares and tires of silver.\n\n**PRICES OF CERTAIN STAPLES IN BERAR**\n\n|                | Average price (in seers per rupee) for ten years ending |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                | 1880 | 1890 | 1900 | 1903-4 |\n| Jowar          |      |      |      |        |\n| Wheat          | 21.5 | 26.15| 20.1 | 22.04  |\n| Gram           | 14.9 | 18.7 | 12.5 | 10.46  |\n| Rice           | 15.5 | 21.6 | 14.0 | 14.81  |\n| Salt           | 9.13 | 10.0 | 8.0  | 8.78   |\n\n*Average for seven years only.*\n\nThe Berar forests are divided into three classes: (A) areas reserved for the production of timber and fuel; (B) *ramnas*, or areas reserved for the growth of grass for fodder; and (C) grazing lands. The tree growth has already been described under Botany.\n\nThe forests are under the control of a Conservator, subordinate to whom are five Forest officers in charge of divisions, which are conterminous with administrative Districts except in the case of the Buldana division, which includes both Buldana and Akola Districts. Forests of Class A are carefully protected from fire and grazing, except during a severe famine, when they are sometimes thrown open to grazing. The forests of Class C, which are primarily pasture lands, fall under two divisions: those in which grazing is regulated and paid for, and those in which grazing is free.\n\nOnly a small proportion of forest produce is extracted by departmental agency. The greater part is removed by purchasers and privilege-holders, or by those to whom special free grants have been made. The administration of the forests has been sympathetic, and the relations of the Forest department with the people are generally excellent. The forests supply the local demand for timber, fuel, bamboos, and fodder, exports beyond the limits of the province being usually unimportant: they also serve as reserves of fuel and fodder, the existence of which was much appreciated by the people in the famine of 1899\u20131900, when the opening of forests of Class A to grazing saved the lives of thousands of cattle and provided large supplies of fodder.\n\nPreventive measures against fire are carried out. Such fires as occur are usually the result of carelessness and neglect of forest regulations.\n\nThe area of forest lands in the province in 1903\u20134 was 3,941 square\n\n---\n\n1 A new class of state forests called 'Village fuel and pasture reserves' will shortly be formed, and will remain under the control of the Revenue department.\nmiles, of which Class A forests occupied 1,770, Class B 83, and Class C 2,088 square miles. The average revenue, expenditure, and surplus for the ten years ending 1900 were Rs. 4,64,000, Rs. 2,32,000, and Rs. 2,32,000, respectively, while in 1903-4 the revenue was Rs. 6,13,000, the expenditure Rs. 2,56,000, and the surplus Rs. 3,57,000.\n\nThere are at present no mines, but the prospects of successful coal-mining in the south-eastern corner of the province are good.\n\nThe manufactures are few and unimportant. They are chiefly confined to twist and yarn, coarse cotton cloth, and the productions of unskilled craftsmen. Silk-weaving is carried on at Kholapur in Amraoti District, where pitambars are made; cotton carpets are woven at Akot and Ellichpur; siris, turbans, khedis, and blankets are made in several parts of the province, and khedis of different textures and colours at Ellichpur and Wun. There are also communities of dyers in some towns and villages, but their work calls for no special notice. The only spinning and weaving-mill in the province, at Badnera, is the property of the Berar Manufacturing Company, Limited. It started work in 1885, and produces yarn and cotton cloth. The following table gives some statistics of its progress:\n\n|                  | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of looms  | 214    | 248    | 248    |\n| Number of spindles| 16,580 | 16,992 | 16,336 |\n| Hands employed   | 843    | 1,228  | 882    |\n\nIn 1891 it worked up 17,128 cwt. of raw cotton into yarn and cloth, and in 1901 it similarly worked up 25,288 cwt. of raw cotton. The out-turn in 1902-3 was 21,337 cwt. of yarn and 9,689\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) cwt. of cloth. The greater part of its produce is sold locally. The monthly wages of skilled labour in this factory vary from Rs. 35 to Rs. 5-4-0, and those of unskilled labour from Rs. 8 to Rs. 5. The most important industry in the province is the ginning and pressing of cotton in steam factories. The following table shows the rapid advance made during the last twenty-four years:\n\n|                  | 1881 | 1891 | 1903 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|\n| Number of ginning factories | ...  | 48   | 153  |\n| Number of steam presses     | 6    | 27   | 59   |\n\nMigration from rural areas into towns is principally due to the growth of this industry. The supply of labour is adequate, and the great majority of the hands employed belong to the province. A man earns on an average Rs. 9 to Rs. 9-8-0, a woman from Rs. 4-12-0 to\nRs. 5, and a child from Rs. 4-3-0 a month. The material condition of the factory hands is good.\n\nThe only information concerning the trade of Ber\u0101r prior to the Assignment in 1853 relates to raw cotton, the principal product of the province. The first exportation direct to Bombay was made by Messrs. Pestonji & Co., merchants of Bombay and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, in 1825\u20136. It consisted of 500 bullock-loads, weighing 120,000 lb. and valued at Rs. 25,000. General Balfour, writing in 1847, said that the trade had by that time been principally diverted to Bonibay, but that most of the Ber\u0101r cotton had formerly been taken 500 miles on pack-bullocks to Mirz\u0101pur and there shipped in boats for Calcutta. After the Assignment, the extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Bhus\u0101wal to N\u0101gpur and the construction of metalled roads greatly stimulated the trade with Bombay, and the pack-bullock became a thing of the past.\n\nThe chief centres of trade are Amraot\u012b, Akola, Kh\u0101ngaon, and Shegaon; and the channels of trade are the N\u0101gpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and the metalled roads connecting it with trade centres of minor importance. The table on the next page shows the general character of the trade of Ber\u0101r. The enormous increase in the importation of grain and pulse in the decade ending 1900\u20131 is attributable to the large importations during the years 1896\u20137 and 1899\u20131900, which were years of scarcity and famine. There is no Chamber of Commerce in the province.\n\nThe internal trade is unimportant and calls for little notice. The agriculturist or labourer buys what he wants at weekly markets held at the old pargana towns and other large villages. Cotton cloth and yarn manufactured in the Badnera mills, and silken pit\u0101mbars or lugades made in the province, are among the principal articles of internal commerce besides agricultural produce. The weaving castes are the S\u0101lis and Kosht\u012bs, and the Mah\u0101rs weave coarse blankets. K\u0101s\u0101rs and Loh\u0101rs make the ordinary utensils of brass, copper, and iron. The ordinary earthen utensils used by the people are made by Kumh\u0101rs, the tiles used for roofing purposes being made principally by members of this caste from Northern India, who visit Ber\u0101r during the cold and hot seasons, returning to their homes before the rains break.\n\nBer\u0101r, being an inland province, has no registered trade beyond the frontiers of India, but the greater part of the surplus produce of raw cotton and grain and pulse is exported by sea from Bombay.\n\nExperience has shown that the road-borne trade is not worth registering; and the external trade of the province may be briefly described as consisting of the export by railway of agricultural produce, chiefly raw cotton, and the import by the same means of simple necessaries of life, manufactured articles, and a few luxuries not produced locally.\nStatistics of the Value of the Trade of Ber\u0101r with other Provinces of India for the Years 1890\u20131, 1900\u20131, and 1903\u20134\n\n(In thousands of rupees)\n\n| Imports | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cotton twist and yarn | 8,71 | 5,99 | 7,04 |\n| ,, piece-goods | 43,13 | 41,21 | 48,15 |\n| Grain and pulse | 17,17 | 91,09 | 55,77 |\n| Metals and manufactures of metals | 16,02 | 21,02 | 58,20 |\n| Oils | 10,79 | 9,82 | 13,18 |\n| Provisions | 18,96 | 25,52 | 30,63 |\n| Salt | 14,01 | 13,49 | 12,66 |\n| Spices | 14,18 | 12,68 | 13,86 |\n| Sugar | 22,52 | 30,47 | 35,02 |\n| All other articles | 22,88 | 21,50 | 72,22 |\n| **Total** | **1,88,37** | **2,72,79** | **3,46,73** |\n| Treasure | ... | 1,65,96 | 2,43,25 |\n\n| Exports | 1890\u20131 | 1900\u20131 | 1903\u20134 |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cotton goods | 11,11 | 47,16 | 7,23 |\n| ,, raw | 3,20,97 | 3,37,44 | 5,87,19 |\n| Grain and pulse | 14,16 | 7,54 | 84 |\n| Oilseeds | 36,17 | 41,92 | 32,75 |\n| Provisions | 3,04 | 2,16 | 1,47 |\n| Spices | 84 | 1,55 | 88 |\n| Sugar | 42 | 2,03 | 1,96 |\n| All other articles | 14,51 | 14,93 | 26,11 |\n| **Total** | **4,01,22** | **4,54,73** | **6,58,43** |\n| Treasure | ... | 22,03 | 82,39 |\n\nBer\u0101r is traversed from east to west by the N\u0101gpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the length of the line in the province being 152 miles. From this main line two small state railways branch off, one from Jalam to Kh\u0101mgaon (8 miles) and the other from Badnera to Amraoti (6 miles). The Kh\u0101mgaon and Amraoti State Railways are worked by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company. The capital outlay on the former was 5\u00b72 lakhs, and on the latter 4\u00b75 lakhs. During the ten years ending 1901\u20132 their receipts averaged Rs. 52,100 and Rs. 98,800, and their expenditure was Rs. 30,600 and Rs. 59,000; and their net profits averaged Rs. 21,500, or 4\u00b712 per cent. on the capital outlay, and Rs. 39,900, or 8\u00b782 per cent. on the capital outlay. There is one mile of railway in the province to every 107 square miles of country.\nThe railway has proved to be of the greatest use and benefit to the people in years of famine, large supplies of food-grains having been imported, especially in 1899-1900, from long distances, as in the case of rice, which was imported from Burma via Calcutta. The tendency of railway traffic is to bring about uniformity of prices. Thus scarcity in other parts will now undoubtedly cause a rise in prices in Ber\u0101r, which would probably not have occurred at all, or would have been more gradual and less marked, before the introduction of railway communication; but, on the other hand, the railway prevents countless deaths from starvation when the crops in Ber\u0101r fail, so that the advantages of railway communication in this respect far outweigh its disadvantages. The railway may have removed or modified some caste prejudices; but, so far as has been observed, these prejudices seem to be merely in abeyance during a journey, the social habits of the people being unaffected by the temporary relaxation of customary restrictions. The effect on language in Ber\u0101r is not noticeable.\n\nThe railway has altered the entire course of communications. Instead of the single line of communication provided by the old N\u0101gpur d\u0101k road, which traversed the province from south-west to north-east, we have the main line of communication provided by the railway, with a system of feeder-roads running north and south from it. Thus to the south there are roads connecting the railway (1) with Yeotm\u0101l, W\u016bn, and D\u0101rw\u0101h\u0101; (2) with K\u0101ranja and B\u0101sim; (3) with B\u0101sim, Pusad, Um\u0101rkhed, and Hingoli; and (4) with Buld\u0101na, Chikhli, and Me\u1e25kar; while to the north roads run (1) to Mors\u012b and Warud, (2) to Ellichpur and Chikalda, (3) to Dary\u0101pur, (4) to Akot, and (5) to Jalgaon. The result of this extension of the road system has been that wheeled transport has completely displaced pack transport, and the Banj\u0101r\u0101 has lost his former means of livelihood. The main lines of roads are Provincial, the District boards having as yet taken charge of very few roads. There was no important change in the road system of the province between 1891 and 1903. The total length of Provincial roads in 1891 was 857 miles, and in 1903 862 miles, the cost of maintenance per mile being Rs. 436 in 1891, and Rs. 202 in 1903. For roads maintained at the cost of Local funds no figures are available. These consist principally of a few fair-weather tracks, unmetalled and practically unbridged.\n\nThe conveyances in general use are the band\u012b, a large cart used for carrying cotton and other agricultural produce; the k\u0101char, a two-wheeled cart capable of holding several persons; and the reng\u012b, a small and very light cart drawn by trotting bullocks, and capable of holding one or at most two persons besides the driver.\n\nBer\u0101r forms, for postal purposes, a part of the Central Provinces and Ber\u0101r Circle, which is in the charge of a Deputy-Postmaster-\nGeneral. The following statistics show the advance in postal business in the province since 1880:\n\n|                      | 1880-1 | 1890-1 | 1900-1 | 1903-4 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of post offices | 102    | 69     | 164    | 186    |\n| Number of letter-boxes | 167\u2020   | 116\u2020   | 125\u2020   | 156    |\n| Number of miles of postal communication | 939    | 1,567  | 1,485  | 1,251\u00bd |\n| Total number of postal articles delivered:\u2014 |        |        |        |        |\n| Letters               | 2,614,485\u2020 | 2,925,579\u2020 | 2,649,296 |        |\n| Postcards             | 1,176,734\u2020 | 2,254,284\u2020 | 2,667,730 |        |\n| Packets               | 122,513\u2020  | 411,026\u2020  | 242,034\u2020  |        |\n| Newspapers            | 311,397\u2020  | 244,394\u2020  | 435,474\u2020  |        |\n| Parcels               | 26,002\u2020   | 42,992\u2020   | 39,384    |        |\n| Value of stamps sold to the public Rs. | 42,688\u2020 | 88,169\u2020 | 1,16,624\u2020 | Not available |\n| Value of money orders issued Rs. | *       | 27,26,810\u2020 | 45,66,560\u2020 | 37,92,138 |\n| Total amount of savings bank deposits Rs. | *       | *       | 8,68,905\u2020 | 12,07,720 |\n\n* The figures are included in those given for the Central Provinces.\n\u2020 The figures marked thus include the figures for the post offices in Hyderabad State included in the Central Provinces and Berar Postal Circle.\n\u2021 Including unregistered newspapers. || Registered as newspapers in the Post Office.\n\nThe statistics given above relate to both the Imperial and the local or District post. The latter system provided postal communications required for magisterial and police purposes, the upkeep of which was not warranted under the commercial principles of the Post Office. It was maintained by contributions from District boards supplemented by a Government grant. The number of District post offices in 1904 was 30, and the total length of District post mail lines 554 miles. Official correspondence conveyed entirely over District post lines was carried free. The two systems were amalgamated in 1905.\n\nBerar was for many years considered to be specially favoured by nature; and so lately as in 1893 it was officially reported that no programme of relief works was required, as the province was immune from famine. The Administration was thus utterly unprepared to cope with distress arising from scarcity when in 1896 the crops partly failed.\n\nScarcity and famine in Berar, as in most other parts of India, are due to the failure of the south-west monsoon, and the intensity of the calamity varies with the extent of the failure; but oppressively high prices are liable to occur even when the harvest in Berar has been fairly good, if severe famine in other parts of India stimulate the export of grain.\n\nThe Melghat is more liable to famine than any other part of Berar, owing to the comparative poverty of the soil and the thriftlessness of the aboriginal cultivators, but no distinction can be drawn between\nother parts of the province. It so happened, both in 1896\u20137 and in 1899\u20131900, that W\u00fcn District, in the south-eastern corner of the province, suffered less than other Districts, but its more favourable circumstances were purely fortuitous.\n\nThe staple food-grain of the province, jow\u0101r, and also the pulse most commonly eaten being both khar\u012bf crops, this harvest is naturally the more important. The only important food-grain grown as a rabi crop is wheat, which, though eaten by the well-to-do, is regarded more as a crop for export than as an addition to the food-supply. Moreover, the rabi harvest, never very important as a source of food-supply, has for some years past continuously decreased, owing to the failure of the late rains.\n\nHitherto indications of famine have been slower to declare themselves in Ber\u0101r than elsewhere, and the first warning of the calamity has been a sudden rise in the price of grain, owing to exports. The partial failure of the crops and the appearance of wanderers in search of work are the next symptoms. In the famine of 1899\u20131900 immigration from the Niz\u0101m\u2019s Dominions, where relief measures were imperfect, was so extensive as seriously to embarrass the Administration, and immigration from that State will probably be a factor to be reckoned with in any future programme of relief measures.\n\nHad the history of Ber\u0101r been more carefully studied, it is probable that the optimistic views advanced in 1893 would never have found expression; for, though the province may have been, on the whole, more fortunate than other parts of India, there is ample evidence that it has, in the past, suffered severely from famine.\n\nIn the reign of Muhammad Sh\u0101h Bahmani (1378\u201397) Ber\u0101r, in common with the rest of the Deccan, was devastated by a terrible famine; and it is highly improbable that it escaped the famine of 1417, which affected the greater part of the Deccan. Again in 1472\u20133, M\u0101lw\u0101 and the Deccan, including Ber\u0101r, were wasted by a famine which lasted for two years and caused wholesale emigration to Bengal and Gujar\u0101t. In 1630\u20131, the fourth year of the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, there was a terrible famine throughout Gujar\u0101t, Kh\u0101ndesh, Ber\u0101r, and the province of Daulat\u0101b\u0101d. The flesh of dogs was sold by butchers as goat\u2019s flesh, the crushed bones of the dead were mingled with the flour exposed for sale, and parents devoured their children.\n\nIt is unnecessary to discuss distress and scarcity due directly to misrule and to intestinal wars and disturbances, since these are no longer a factor in the liability of the country to famine. Ber\u0101r did not escape the famine of 1833, which caused considerable distress, as did also the famine of 1839 and the scarcity in 1862.\n\nIn 1896 there was a partial failure of the rains; and though the province produced grain sufficient for its own needs, the simultaneous\nappearance of famine in other parts of India stimulated the export of grain and caused distress by raising prices. Actual famine conditions prevailed in the Melgh\u0101t, Akola District, and the Malkapur taluk.\n\nAn almost total failure of the rains in 1899 was followed in 1900 by a severe famine. Except in W\u016bn District, the failure of crops was complete; and the distress lasted till late in 1900, when copious rain and the prospects of a good harvest caused a fall in prices and restored the labour market to its normal condition.\n\nA general increase in mortality during a famine is inevitable. In Ber\u0101r it has been found that the mortality increases gradually until the hot season has set in. It then increases more rapidly, but does not reach its highest point until a considerable quantity of rain has fallen. Thus, in 1900 the highest death-rate (12 per 1,000 in the month) was not reached till August. The rapid increase after the commencement of the rains is due to inevitable exposure, to bowel complaints caused by the consumption of foul water and rank green-stuff, and to endemic diseases, the virulence of which is naturally more marked when large numbers are predisposed to disease. A very distinct decrease in the birth-rate is observable in the year following a famine.\n\nAn extensive system of irrigation is impracticable in Ber\u0101r, though storage tanks might perhaps be constructed in the Melgh\u0101t and the B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t. Protective measures, other than the maintenance and extension of railway communication, are therefore confined to preparation for emergencies. Programmes of large and small relief works are maintained, and during a famine a system of village relief by the distribution of cooked and uncooked food is inaugurated. Poorhouses are opened for the decrepit and deformed, loans are freely granted to cultivators under the two Acts which govern their issue, private charity is stimulated, and those whose scruples prevent them from receiving gratuitous relief are helped by the opening of cheap grain-shops.\n\nFrom the Assignment in 1853 until 1903, the administration of Ber\u0101r was conducted by the Resident at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d, who exercised, in respect of the province, the powers of a Chief Commissioner. His Secretariat consisted of his two Assistants, besides a Secretary and an Assistant Secretary in the Public Works department, while the Comptroller at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d exercised a general control, under the Resident, in financial matters. In 1903 the administration of Ber\u0101r was transferred, in pursuance of the agreement of 1902, from the Resident at Hyder\u0101b\u0101d to the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces.\n\nThe province forms one Division, under a Commissioner, and up to 1905 was divided into six Districts\u2014Amraoti, Ellichpur, W\u016bn, Akola, Buld\u0101na, and Basim\u2014each under the charge of a Deputy-Commissioner. These have now been rearranged and form four Districts: Amraoti,\nAkola, Buldana, and Yeotmal. The Deputy-Commissioners have a staff of Assistant Commissioners and Extra-Assistant Commissioners, who exercise magisterial, civil, and revenue powers, and tahsildars, who exercise criminal and revenue powers. Each tahsildar has charge of a taluk, of which there are twenty-two in the province. Assistance in petty magisterial cases is rendered by special or honorary magistrates, of whom there are 31, including 23 who sit as benches, in five of the most important towns. A Superintendent of Police manages the police of each District, in subordination to the Deputy-Commissioner, and there are three Assistant Superintendents in the province. The District jails are under the charge of the Civil Surgeon at the headquarters of each District. The province is divided into five Forest divisions, each of which is managed, under the control of the Deputy-Commissioner of the District within the limits of which the forests are situated, by a Deputy, Assistant, or Extra-Deputy-Conservator. These officers are subordinate in departmental matters to the Conservator of Forests in Berar.\n\nThe last link in the chain of administration consists of the village officers, the patel and the patwari, whose offices are hereditary. The patel has generally both revenue and police duties. He collects the revenues in his village, and is superintendent of the jaglyas or village watchmen. He is bound to give timely information of all crimes, and in cases of necessity may make arrests. In some large villages the offices of police and revenue patel are held by different individuals. The patwari is the village accountant. He prepares the annual jamabandi or statement showing the occupant, area, rental, and crop of every field in his village or circle, keeps all the village papers and registers, applications for and relinquishments of land, and statements showing transfers. He and the patel are responsible that every payment of revenue is duly written up in the receipt-book which every registered occupant of land holds. Patels and patwaris are remunerated by a fixed percentage of the land revenue, forest dues, and town fund taxes collected by them. The work of the patwaris is immediately supervised by munsarins, of whom two or more are attached to each taluk. Munsarins will soon probably be replaced by circle inspectors under the supervision of District inspectors.\n\nBerar has no local legislature, and Acts of the Indian Legislative Council do not apply proprio vigore to the province, which is not legally a part of British India. They are, however, generally made applicable to it by executive order of the Governor-General-in-Council, and the same authority makes local laws and rules for the province. The Resident at Hyderabad was formerly, and the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces is now, empowered to make subsidiary rules under Legislation and justice.\ncertain Acts and laws. Owing to the extensive application of Acts of the Legislative Council to the province, the administration of civil and criminal justice is in all respects similar to the administration of justice in a non-regulation Province of British India. The chief local laws passed since 1880 have been the Excise Law (1897), the Rural Boards Law (1885), the Municipal Law (1886), the Land Revenue Code (1896), the Ber\u0101r Courts Law, and the Ber\u0101r Small Cause Courts Law (1905).\n\nIn 1905, after the transfer of Ber\u0101r to the Central Provinces, the Ber\u0101r Courts Law and the Ber\u0101r Small Cause Courts Law came into force; and the province is now divided, for the purposes of the administration of justice, into the two civil districts of East Ber\u0101r, consisting of the revenue Districts of Amraot\u012b and Yeotm\u0101l, and West Ber\u0101r, consisting of the revenue Districts of Akola and Buld\u0101na. In each of the two civil districts a District Judge hears civil suits without limit as regards value, and is assisted by an Additional District Judge. Subordinate Judges, with powers to try and determine suits of which the value does not exceed Rs. 5,000, hold their courts at Amraot\u012b, Morsi, Ellichpur, Dary\u0101pur, and Yeotm\u0101l in East Ber\u0101r, and at Akola, B\u0101sim, Kh\u0101mgaon, and Buld\u0101na in West Ber\u0101r; and Munsifs, with power to try and determine suits of which the value does not exceed Rs. 500, sit at Amraot\u012b, Morsi, Ellichpur (where there are two), Yeotm\u0101l, and D\u0101rwh\u0101 in East Ber\u0101r, and at Akola, B\u0101sim, Malk\u0101pur, and Mehkar in West Ber\u0101r.\n\nAppeals from the decrees of subordinate courts lie to the District and Additional District Judges; and appeals from the District courts lie to the court of the Additional Judicial Commissioner in N\u0101gpur, which is the Provincial High Court. Appeals from this court, when allowed by law, lie to the Privy Council.\n\nCourts of Small Causes, with power to try suits of a civil nature not exceeding Rs. 1,000 in value and cognizable by such courts, are established at Amraot\u012b in East Ber\u0101r and at Akola and Kh\u0101mgaon in West Ber\u0101r.\n\nThe limits of the two Sessions divisions coincide with those of the civil districts, in which the District and Additional District Judges exercise the powers of Sessions Judges. Sessions are held in alternate months at Amraot\u012b and Yeotm\u0101l in East Ber\u0101r, and at Akola and Buld\u0101na in West Ber\u0101r. Deputy-Commissioners as District Magistrates are empowered under section 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try as magistrates all offences not punishable with death, but they exercise this power only in exceptional circumstances. Subdivisional magistrates, with power to hear appeals from convictions by magistrates of the second and third classes and to call for records, are stationed at Ellichpur, B\u0101sim, and Kh\u0101mgaon.\nAppeals lie from the Courts of Session to the Additional Judicial Commissioner at Nagpur, by whom also all sentences of death must be confirmed. Original and appellate jurisdiction over European British subjects in Berar is exercised by the High Court at Bombay.\n\nThe number of criminal cases brought to trial varies but slightly from year to year; but in years of scarcity a great increase is always noticed in the number of serious offences against property, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in petty cases of assault, trespass, and the like. At such times a marked decrease occurs in civil litigation, followed, on the return of prosperity, by an abnormal increase, especially in suits affecting real property.\n\nThe Registration department is controlled by the Inspector General of Registration. In each District a District registrar is appointed, usually an Extra-Assistant Commissioner, to whom sub-registrars of circles, who are the actual registering officers in all ordinary cases, are subordinate. The average number of registration offices during the decennial periods ending 1890 and 1900 was 59 and 66. In 1903 there were 68 offices. The number of documents registered in the two decennial periods averaged 25,500 and 34,500, and was 37,400 in 1901.\n\n**Table showing the Number of Criminal Cases brought to Trial in Berar**\n\n| Number of persons tried: | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 | Percentage of convictions |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (a) For offences against person and property | 12,962 | 15,224 | 11,962 | 5,636 | 15 |\n| (b) For other offences against the Indian Penal Code | 1,273 | 1,708 | 869 | 776 | 29 |\n| (c) For offences against special and local laws | 5,082 | 1,713 | 13,571 | 7,256 | 88 |\n| **Total** | **19,317** | **18,645** | **26,402** | **13,668** | **88** |\n\n**Table showing the Number of Civil Suits instituted in Berar**\n\n| Suits for money and movable property | Average for ten years ending 1890 | Average for ten years ending 1900 |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Title and other suits | 22,431 | 21,173 | 21,141 | 14,618 |\n| Total | 24,792 | 24,900 | 27,606 | 20,538 |\nThe following figures, showing, in thousands of rupees, the revenue collected under various heads in 1853\u20134, the year after the Assignment of Ber\u0101r, indicate the principal sources of revenue under native rule:\n\n| Source                  | Amount |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| Land revenue            | 19,15  |\n| Frontier and transit duties | 1,95   |\n| Akkari                  | 90     |\n| S\u0101yav, or town duties   | 71     |\n| Salt wells              | 19     |\n| Miscellaneous           | 22     |\n\nAbout 74 per cent. of the revenue raised by or for the Niz\u0101m represented the assessment on the land. Other relatively important headings, such as transit and town duties and salt wells, have long since disappeared from the public accounts.\n\nFormer methods of taxation were most oppressive, for the greater part of the province was usually leased out to bankers in payment of debts due to them by the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d State, and they levied what they could. All were not equally extortionate, but the uncertainty of their tenure offered no inducement to ameliorate the condition of the cultivator. The last of these great farmers had to give up his lease in 1845; and for the next eight years the kh\u0101lsa land was administered by officers of the Niz\u0101m\u2019s government, whose yoke was probably no lighter than that of the farmers. It was customary for an officer appointed to any important administrative post to pay, on his appointment, a large donation, which he recovered from his charge. The people had scarcely recovered from these imposts, when the t\u0101lukd\u0101rs got wind of the Assignment to the British, and promptly raised the land revenue demand, in order that they might carry off as much as possible. So much had Ber\u0101r suffered that, when it was \u2018assigned,\u2019 the revenues of this rich province were estimated, by a government which certainly had no temptation to underestimate them, at little more than 30 lakhs, while the actual collections in 1853\u20134 fell short of 26 lakhs. In 1860\u20131 they had risen to 40 and in 1869\u201370 to 83\u00bd lakhs.\n\nThe Provincial contract system was introduced in 1880, the Resident\u2019s expenditure under the heads \u2018Civil,\u2019 and \u2018Public Works, including Railways,\u2019 being limited to 54 per cent. of the gross revenue. From the year 1882\u20133 the percentage was reduced to 52, and again in 1887\u20138 to 50, which rate, although fixed for five years, was found to be insufficient, and was raised to 51 in 1889\u201390. The percentage was again reduced to 50 for the quinquennium which ended in 1896\u20137, and this arrangement continued until the lease of Ber\u0101r to the Government of India in 1903.\n\nThe following figures show, in lakhs of rupees, the principal variations in land revenue collections since the Assignment, the years selected being those in which the variation has been most marked:\n\n| Year    | Amount |\n|---------|--------|\n| 1853\u20134  | 19     |\n| 1872\u20133  | 53     |\n| 1875\u20136  | 67     |\n| 1902\u20133  | 74\u00bd    |\nCollections in 1901-2 amounted to more than 89\u00bd lakhs, but this total included many arrears. The remarkably rapid increase in the course of the twenty years which followed the Assignment is attributable rather to the extension of cultivation than to enhancement of the demand. Excise revenue has similarly increased, but more gradually and less continuously. It reached nearly 17 lakhs in 1891-2, but declined from that year onwards owing to the abolition, in the more populous parts of the province, of the out-still system and the introduction of a more elaborate system of excise administration. The disappearance of some heads of revenue from the public accounts has already been mentioned. Their loss has been much more than counterbalanced by the revenue raised from sources untapped under the former rule. Stamps were introduced in 1857, and by 1869-70 realized 4\u00b76 lakhs. In 1903-4 the income from this head amounted to 8 lakhs.\n\nForests are another source from which former rulers drew no revenue; but the control and administration of the forests was undertaken shortly after the Assignment, and forest revenue, which in 1869-70 was less than 2 lakhs of rupees, amounted in 1903-4 to Rs. 6,12,527. Registration was first introduced in 1877-8. The discovery of new sources of revenue has been accompanied by the opening of new channels of expenditure. Education was not provided by the state till 1862, and ten years later the expenditure amounted to less than 2\u00bd lakhs. In 1903-4 it was more than 5 lakhs. Medical relief was also unknown under native rule. In 1870-1 little more than a lakh was spent under this head. Rather more than 1\u00bd lakhs is now spent annually; but in 1900-1, the year after a severe famine, the expenditure was 2\u00bc lakhs. The expenditure on public works increased steadily until 1892-3, when it reached nearly 15 lakhs. Since that time more rigid economy has been practised, and the expenditure has gradually declined.\n\nA distinctive feature of Berar finance before the lease was the heavy military expenditure, which was necessarily an important item, for the province was specially assigned for the maintenance of the Hyderab\u0101d Contingent, a force which consisted of four regiments of cavalry, four batteries of artillery, and six regiments of infantry. Statistics of this expenditure will be found on p. 405. They show, as might be expected, a steady and progressive increase, due to the necessity of maintaining the standard of efficiency attained by the regular Indian army.\n\nBerar has been settled on the Bombay ryotwari system, under which each field forms a holding for which the occupier engages separately with Government. The whole province, with the exception of the Melgh\u0101t and some uncultivated tracts in Yeotm\u0101l and Akola Districts, was measured, classified, and assessed, field by field, by the close of 1878. The settlements, which were for a term of thirty years, commenced to expire in 1891. Revision\noperations have now been completed for the whole province except the taluks of Kelapur, Yeotmal, and Wun in Yeotmal District, where the work did not commence till 1904.\n\n**Principal Sources of Provincial Revenue in Berar**\n\n(In thousands of rupees)\n\n|                        | Average for ten years ending March 31, 1890. | Average for ten years ending March 31, 1900. | Year ending March 31, 1901. | Year ending March 31, 1904. |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                        | Total amount raised (Imperial, Provincial, and Local), credited to Provincial revenues. | Total amount raised (Imperial, Provincial, and Local), credited to Provincial revenues. | Total amount raised (Imperial, Provincial, and Local), Amount credited to Provincial revenues. | Total amount raised (Imperial, Provincial, and Local). |\n| Land revenue           | 63.98                                       | 64.25                                       | 80.17                      | 78.30                      |\n| Opium                  | 1.85                                        | 1.60                                        | 1.50                       | ...                        |\n| Stamps                 | 6.60                                        | 8.31                                        | 6.74                       | 8.48                       |\n| Excise                 | 13.45                                       | 13.78                                       | 9.85                       | 19.94                      |\n| Provincial rates       | 4.73                                        | 5.87                                        | 6.37                       | 6.47                       |\n| Customs                | ...                                         | ...                                         | 15                         | 17                         |\n| Assessed taxes         | ...                                         | 69                                          | 89                         | 142                        |\n| Forest                 | 3.30                                        | 4.72                                        | 3.03                       | 6.07                       |\n| Registration           | 56                                          | 84                                          | 81                         | 97                         |\n| Other sources          | 2.80                                        | 4.79                                        | 3.27                       | 5.21                       |\n| **Total**              | 97.27                                       | 104.92                                      | 114.19                     | 127.03                     |\n\nThe holder of a field or 'survey number' is called the registered occupant or kh\u0101ted\u0101r, and he holds on condition of paying the assessment and other dues. Failure to pay these dues renders him liable to forfeit the right of occupancy and all rights connected with it, such as those over trees and buildings on the land. Land thus forfeited reverts to Government, and the right of occupancy is put up to sale by auction after due notice. No occupant is bound to hold his land for more than a single year. He may, on giving due notice, relinquish it, or he may dispose of the occupancy right by sale or otherwise to another; but he is responsible for the revenue of the year in which he relinquishes or transfers his right. An occupant may, if he chooses, retain his occupancy right for ever, subject to the payment of the assessment and dues, which are liable to revision once every thirty years. He may also sublet his holding, but only by private arrangement, which finds no place in the revenue records.\n\nThis description applies to the ryotw\u0101ri tenure, which is the ordinary tenure of Berar. The extraordinary tenures are j\u0101g\u012br, in\u0101m, ij\u0101ra, and p\u0101lampat. The term j\u0101g\u012br means any rent-free holding of one or more villages. Nearly all the j\u0101g\u012brs in Berar have been granted either by\nthe Delhi emperors or by the Niz\u0101ms, one or two only by the Peshwas. The term *in\u0101m* is applied to fields as *j\u0101g\u012br* is to villages. *In\u0101ms* have been granted for charitable objects, for service in villages, offices, or in temples, and sometimes as purely personal favours. *P\u0101lampat* tenure is similar to tenure in *j\u0101g\u012br*, but the holding is not entirely free. A fixed proportion of the rent is paid to Government. *Deshmukhs* and *deshp\u0101ndyas* in W\u016bn District hold a few *p\u0101lampat* villages under ancient grants.\n\n**Principal Heads of Provincial Expenditure in Ber\u0101r**\n\n(In thousands of rupees)\n\n|                                | Average for ten years ending March 31, 1890 | Average for ten years ending March 31, 1900 | Year ending March 31, 1901 | Year ending March 31, 1904 |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Opening balance                | 42.92                                       | 41.18                                       | -16.58                    | ...                       |\n| Charges in respect of collection (principally land revenue and forest) | 15.27                                       | 17.49                                       | 18.08                     | 16.82                     |\n| Salaries and expenses of civil departments\u2014 |                                             |                                             |                           |                           |\n| (a) General administration     | 2.41                                        | 2.97                                        | 3.17                      | 1.96                      |\n| (b) Law and justice            | 3.13                                        | 4.31                                        | 5.27                      | 3.80                      |\n| (c) Police                    | 5.35                                        | 5.93                                        | 6.30                      | 5.57                      |\n| (d) Education                 | 1.82                                        | 1.93                                        | 1.96                      | 2.55                      |\n| (e) Medical                   | 1.32                                        | 1.50                                        | 2.09                      | 1.72                      |\n| (f) Other heads*              | 22                                           | 30                                          | 2.3                       | 2.3                       |\n| Pensions\u2020 and miscellaneous civil charges\u2021 | 4.90                                         | 7.37                                        | 7.92                      | 2.57                      |\n| Famine relief                 | ...                                         | 4.04                                        | 80.39                     | ...                       |\n| Irrigation                    | ...                                         | ...                                         | ...                       | ...                       |\n| Public works                  | 10.76                                       | 9.19                                        | 4.68                      | 6.09                      |\n| Other charges and adjustments | 1.84                                        | 2.31                                        | 1.76                      | 25.65                     |\n| Expenditure on account of the Hyder\u0101b\u0101d Contingent | 31.32                                       | 38.62                                       | 39.12                     | ...                       |\n| Total expenditure             | 78.34                                       | 95.96                                       | 170.97                    | 66.96                     |\n| Closing balance               | 41.18                                       | -16.58                                      | -77.60                    | ...                       |\n\n* Includes the heads 'Ecclesiastical' and 'Scientific and other minor departments.'\n\u2020 Includes also the head 'Assignments and compensations.'\n\u2021 Includes the heads 'Stationery and Printing' and 'Miscellaneous.'\n\nThe *ij\u0101rad\u012br* is the lessee of an integral waste village, holding under a lease from Government, which may be for any term not extending beyond the next settlement of the *tiluk* in which the village is situated. For the first three years no rent is paid. In the fourth year either one-fifth or one-tenth of the full assessment has to be paid; in the fifth year\nthe rent is doubled, in the sixth trebled, and so on, until the full assessment is reached. The object of the lease being to encourage the breaking-up of the land for cultivation, tracts containing valuable timber are excluded, and quarrying or mining is prohibited; but special arrangements are made in the lessees' favour in the case of an excess of uncultivable land, and special rules are laid down with regard to grazing. During the currency of the lease the *ij\u0101rad\u0101r* is *p\u0101tel* and *patw\u0101ri* of the village: and at its expiry, when the village is liable to be surveyed and to have its assessment revised, the offices of *p\u0101tel* and *patw\u0101ri* are offered to him, and he is registered as the occupant of all land then actually occupied by him. Such are the rules of 1880, which are now in force. Under the former rules of 1865 the term of the lease was limited to thirty years; and the lessee had the option, on the termination of his lease, of constituting the village his property in perpetuity, subject to the payment annually to Government of one-half of a fair assessment, liable to revision every thirty years, upon the whole of the cultivated and cultivable area.\n\nIn 1901 the number of villages held under each class of tenure was as follows: *ryotw\u0101ri*, 6,133; *j\u0101gir*, 211; *ij\u0101ra*, 449; *p\u0101lampat*, 16. Of the assessment of *ryotw\u0101ri* villages amounting to 70.6 lakhs, land assessed at Rs. 75,500 was occupied by *in\u0101md\u0101rs*.\n\nPersons holding by cultivation occupancy may be thus classified:\n\n(a) Registered occupants holding direct from Government, the fields being registered in their names;\n\n(b) Persons possessing interests similar in kind to that of registered occupants; and\n\n(c) Tenants.\n\nThe position of the registered occupant has already been described. Those who possess an interest similar to his are co-sharers and co-occupants. A co-sharer is a partner in a whole field, cultivating jointly with the occupant on the co-operative system; a co-occupant occupies and cultivates a specific portion of a field. Co-sharers and co-occupants may have co-sharers and co-occupants claiming under them and not directly from the registered occupant. There are two exceptional varieties of co-sharers: one who obtains a share in the profits by personal labour in the field, and one who obtains a share by supplying bullocks. The latter variety of sub-tenure is rare.\n\nThe land revenue of Ber\u0101r in 1903\u20134 was 85 lakhs. It is estimated that, when the enhanced assessment of the *t\u0101luks* of Murtaz\u0101pur, Amraoti, Morsi, B\u0101sim, Mangr\u016bl, Ellichpur, D\u0101rwh\u0101, and Pusad\u2014the levy of which has been postponed in order to allow time to recover from the effects of the famine of 1899\u20131900\u2014is realized in 1906, the land revenue of the province will amount to 99 lakhs.\n\nThe unit of calculation in the land revenue assessment is, as has\nbeen explained, the field or 'survey number,' but when a taluk is to be assessed it is divided into groups of villages, classified according to the productiveness of soil and such adventitious advantages as means of communication and proximity to markets or railways. A maximum rate per acre is fixed for each group of villages, and in assessing single fields the fertility of the soil of each is considered. Soils are divided into three classes, for each of which a maximum assessment per acre is fixed. In determining the assessment the depth of the soil, and any defects, such as the presence of sand, of limestone nodules, or of a flow of water over any portion of the field, are considered.\n\nThe land revenue demand in the reign of Akbar amounted to 161\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs, and fell in the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n to 137\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lakhs. The famine of 1630\u20131 may account for the decrease, but it is probable that it was partly due to an equitable assessment based on Malik Ambar's settlement of 1612 and to the relinquishment of paper claims against Gond chieftains. These figures are, however, of little use for comparison with those of the present day, for Ber\u0101r was, in the days of Akbar and Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, approximately twice as large as the present province. Moreover, we have no means of estimating the population of the province in Mughal times, or the area of the land actually under cultivation. All, therefore, that can be asserted is that the mean between the figures for the two reigns is approximately double the present assessment of Ber\u0101r, so that, taking gross area alone into consideration, the Mughal cash assessment was about equal to the British cash assessment, notwithstanding the rise in the money value of agricultural produce. No margin remains to counterbalance the hardships entailed by former methods of collection. We know that in other parts of the empire, near the capital city and immediately under the eye of Todar Mal, who perfected Akbar's land revenue system, the rapacity of the karoris or collectors brought upon them cruel punishments. It is not likely that provinces at a distance from the capital, often the seat of war, and overrun by troops, fared any better. The miserable condition of the province in the days of the later Mughal emperors, and during and after the Mar\u0101th\u0101 and Pind\u0101ri Wars, has been described. During the period which elapsed between the overthrow of the Pind\u0101ris and the Assignment of Ber\u0101r to the East India Company, nobody but the revenue collectors and the ryots knew the rates at which land revenue was actually levied, for the province was leased out to farmers, who with perhaps a single exception squeezed as much as they could out of it.\n\nThe number of holdings in ryotw\u0101ri villages in Ber\u0101r in 1901 was 392,123, the corresponding assessment being 67.8 lakhs, so that the incidence per occupant was very nearly Rs. 17\u20135. It is estimated that the land revenue demand amounts to 7 per cent. of the gross produce.\nThis being so, it is obvious that the assessment has no bearing whatever on the ability of the people to withstand famine, for in a prosperous year the cultivator would not feel a deduction of 7 per cent. from his gross produce. When crops failed completely\u2014a phenomenon of very rare occurrence\u2014he might be able to meet the demand from savings; but should he be unable to do this the demand would be postponed for a year at least, so that in the year following the failure of crops he would be able to pay 14 per cent. of the gross produce without hardship.\n\nThe principle observed in suspending and remitting land revenue in times of scarcity is that nobody should be compelled to borrow in order to meet the demand. Tahsildars are required to prepare lists of all landholders known to be able to meet the demand, and to recover it by the ordinary procedure. It is ordinarily assumed that recent purchasers, mortgagees in possession, occupants other than agriculturists, and occupants of fields which have yielded half of a normal crop are able to pay. The Deputy-Commissioner is empowered to suspend collections of land revenue due from persons who, by reason of their known inability to pay, have not been entered in the tahsildar's list. When the prospects of the next kharif crop can be estimated with some degree of accuracy, the Deputy-Commissioner submits to the Commissioner his proposals regarding the collection of arrears. Remissions of land revenue are few because, owing to the light assessment, they are generally unnecessary.\n\nThe cultivation of the poppy has not been allowed in Berar for many years, all opium required for local consumption being imported from either Indore or Bombay. The right to sell opium, whether wholesale or retail, is sold annually by auction. Wholesale vendors receive licences to import opium, which is stored by them at sub-treasuries or authorized storerooms, and may be sold to none but licensed retail vendors. The latter receive licences authorizing them to open shops in localities approved by the Deputy-Commissioner for the sale of opium to the general public, and in certain circumstances are permitted to import opium.\n\nThe following statement shows the net revenue realized from opium since 1881:\n\n| Year Range | Revenue (Rs.) |\n|------------|---------------|\n| Average    |               |\n| 1881-90    | 2,97,000      |\n| 1891-1900  | 3,00,000      |\n| 1903-4     | 4,17,000      |\n\nThe figures for 1881-90 and 1891-1900 do not accurately represent the revenue derived from opium alone, for until 1893-4 the right to sell hemp drugs was included in the opium licences, and separate figures are not available.\n\nThe cultivation of the hemp plant in Berar has hitherto been\nprohibited; and hemp drugs, i.e. ganja and bhang, are imported by licensed vendors from the Government warehouse at Khandwa under conditions similar to those which govern the importation of opium. Figures showing the revenue realized from hemp drugs alone are not available for years before 1894-5; but the average revenue for the six years ending 1899-1900 was Rs. 23,500, the actual revenue for 1903-4 being Rs. 51,000.\n\nThe manufacture and supply of country liquor (mahu\u0101 spirit) is regulated by two distinct systems. That known locally as the Madras contract distillery system prevails in the Districts of Amraoti, Ellichpur, and Akola, and in the Malkapur taluk of Buldana District. These areas are supplied by two distilleries: one at Ellichpur, which supplies Amraoti and Ellichpur Districts, and the other at Akola, which supplies the other areas. In all other parts of Berar the out-still system prevailed till recently, the right to manufacture and sell country liquor in approved localities being sold annually by auction. From April 1, 1905, the distillery system was introduced.\n\nThe annual net revenue derived from country spirits rose from an average of 10.5 lakhs between 1881 and 1890 to an average of 11 lakhs in the next decade. The revenue declined almost continuously from 1893-4, the decrease being attributable to the introduction of the contract distillery system, and in later years to famine. But since 1901 there has been a great improvement in the revenue from this source. In 1903-4 the receipts amounted to 20 lakhs.\n\nThe revenue derived from imported liquors is trifling. For the seven years preceding 1901 the receipts averaged Rs. 1,947.\n\nEach District treasury is a local depot for the sale of stamps, and every taluk treasury is a branch depot. The treasurers or pott\u0101rs are ex-officio vendors of stamps. Besides the ex-officio vendors there are licensed vendors, including sub-postmasters, who are respectable men appointed by the Deputy-Commissioner, and receive discount according to the nature and value of the stamps sold and the place of sale.\n\nThe following table shows the net revenue from judicial and non-judicial stamps for the last twenty years:\n\n|                | Average, 1881-90 | Average, 1891-1900 | 1901 | 1902 |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------------|------|------|\n| Judicial stamps| Rs. 3,73,000     | Rs. 4,69,000       | Rs. 3,70,000 | Rs. 4,73,000 |\n| Non-judicial stamps | Rs. 2,55,000    | Rs. 3,12,000       | Rs. 2,60,000 | Rs. 3,32,000 |\n\nIncreases in the sale of hundi and receipt stamps are favourable signs, being usually attributable to briskness of trade, following a good cotton crop. Bad seasons have a marked effect on the sale of judicial stamps.\nfor two reasons: namely, that the people cannot afford to go to law, and that the prospect of recovering anything, even if a suit be successful, is poor. Similarly, by affecting trade, they cause a decrease in the sales of general stamps, though this effect is largely counteracted by the necessity for borrowing. Plague in Bombay has had a detrimental effect on trade, and consequently on the sale of general stamps in Ber\u0101r.\n\nDuring the period of the Assignment income-tax was not levied in the province, except from officers of the administration. It has been introduced since the lease.\n\nThe Ber\u0101r Rural Boards Law (1885) was the enactment which introduced local self-government into the province; but the first Local and municipal. elections for t\u0101luk boards did not take place till late in 1888 and early in 1889. The District of W\u016bn was at first excluded from the operation of the law, which was only extended to it in 1892, and the Melgh\u0101t t\u0101luk has always been unrepresented.\n\nThe newly constituted District boards commenced their work in 1890; and although the law, the rules made, and the system of accounts laid down were not at first clearly understood, the working of the newly formed bodies has been on the whole satisfactory, and the members have displayed some interest in their duties.\n\nThere are now twenty-one t\u0101luk boards, one for each t\u0101luk outside the Melgh\u0101t, and six\u00b9 District boards. The latter were composed in 1901 of 152 members, of whom 122 were elected. The t\u0101luk boards had 373 members, of whom 243 were elected. The functions of District boards are generally those mentioned in Vol. IV, chapter ix; and their principal duties are in connexion with the upkeep of roads, schools, dispensaries, resthouses, and drinking-water sources. The t\u0101luk boards form, in practice, the electorate for the District boards; and they constitute the local agencies for the carrying out of District board works, and for representing to the District boards the needs of their t\u0101luks.\n\nSpeaking generally, it cannot be said that the principles of local self-government have made much headway. The percentage of actual voters to those entitled to vote is usually about 8 or 9, and sometimes as low as 3 or 4. Nine candidates out of ten would probably think it a greater honour to be appointed by Government to the membership of a board than to be elected.\n\nMunicipal administration was introduced into the towns of Amraoti, Akola, Ellichpur, B\u0101sim, Yeotm\u0101l, and Kh\u0101mgaon in 1869, under special rules for the working of municipal committees drawn up under section 10 of Act XV of 1867. The committees were composed of both\n\n\u00b9 Reduced to four in 1905.\nofficial and non-official members, the latter being in some committees nominated by the Resident and in others elected by the ratepayers. The elective principle was afterwards abandoned. The small town of Yeotmal could not maintain a municipality, and the committee there soon ceased to exist. In 1881 Shegaon in Akola District was added to the list of municipal towns. In 1883 a conference was held to consider the best means of extending municipal self-government in Berar, and municipalities were invited to submit proposals. The next reform was the application of Punjab Act IV of 1873 to Berar, and in 1884 Akot, in Akola District, was made a municipal town. The Berar Municipal Law was passed in 1886, but did not come into full force till 1889\u201390. Since then elections have been regularly held under that law.\n\n### Income and Expenditure of District Boards in Berar\n\n| Income from\u2014 | Average for ten years 1891-2 to 1900-1. | 1901-2 | 1903-4 |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|              | Rs.                                   | Rs.    | Rs.    |\n| Land revenue | 3,596                                  | 1,725  | ...    |\n| Provincial rates | 3,33,576                              | 3,19,646 | 3,40,111 |\n| Interest     | 317                                    | ...    | ...    |\n| Education    | 47,461                                 | 35,664 | 37,502 |\n| Medical      | 16                                     | ...    | 245    |\n| Scientific, &c. | 3,250                                | 1,905  | 2,100  |\n| Miscellaneous | 96,192                                 | 1,33,148 | 1,26,531 |\n| Public works | 6,585                                  | 5,134  | 14,169 |\n| Pounds       | 19,692                                 | 5,466  | 13,117 |\n| Ferries      | 862                                    | 2,170  | 2,153  |\n| **Total income** | **5,11,547**                          | **5,04,858** | **5,35,928** |\n\n| Expenditure on\u2014 | | | |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Refunds         | 42     | ...    | ...    |\n| Land revenue    | 600    | ...    | ...    |\n| General adminstration | 38,335 | 40,282 | 41,012 |\n| Education       | 1,92,148 | 1,90,880 | 1,25,190 |\n| Medical         | 9,621  | 14,028 | 22,546 |\n| Scientific, &c. | 10,393 | 8,779  | 16,589 |\n| Miscellaneous   | 51,472 | 52,368 | 48,972 |\n| Public works    | 2,87,342 | 1,99,162 | 2,69,950 |\n| **Total expenditure** | **5,90,903** | **5,05,499** | **5,24,259** |\n\nThere were, in 1904, twelve municipalities in Berar. The committees of these municipalities consisted of 173 members, of whom 81 were elected; 54 were officials and 119 non-officials; 28 of the members were Europeans. The attention of municipalities has been mainly devoted to surface drainage and general improvement of sanitation, the upkeep of roads, education, and public health. The resources of most of the municipalities in Berar were severely strained by the famine of\n1899\u20131900, and assistance by means of grants from Provincial revenues was found necessary. The municipalities generally have shown some remissness in the collection of arrears of taxation. The financial condition of all places, except Akola, Kh\u0101mgaon, and the Amraoti civil station, is now satisfactory, and in these three an increase of taxation is possible.\n\nElectoral privileges are not highly valued. When the elective principle was first introduced, it was believed that the apathy of the electorate was due to ignorance, and that as the privileges of self-government came to be understood they would be appreciated. These anticipations have not been realized. The proportion of actual voters to the whole body of the electorate varies much at different times and in different municipalities, but a study of the figures for the period from 1889\u201390 to 1900\u20131 can only lead to the conclusion that interest in municipal self-government has declined and is declining.\n\n### Income and Expenditure of Municipalities in Ber\u0101r\n\n| Income from\u2014 | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Tax on houses and lands | 6,389   | 35,377  | 37,040  |\n| Other taxes  | 57,576  | 64,999  | 97,542  |\n| Rents        | 16,390  | 15,936  | 19,472  |\n| Loans        | 13,766* | 31,000  |         |\n| Other sources\u2020 | 3,78,882| 2,13,519| 1,32,847|\n| **Total income** | **4,73,003** | **3,59,031** | **2,86,901** |\n\n| Expenditure on\u2014 | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Administration and collection of taxes | 18,399  | 24,879  | 24,076  |\n| Public safety   | 9,399   | 9,149   | 10,310  |\n| Water-supply and drainage\u2014 |         |         |         |\n| (a) Capital     | 26,017  | 2,752   | 20,527  |\n| (b) Maintenance | 25,116  | 16,592  | 18,072  |\n| Conservancy \u2021   | 61,211  | 66,976  | 73,711  |\n| Hospitals and dispensaries | 8,081   | 8,810   | 6,499   |\n| Public works    | 28,725  | 1,37,170| 31,394  |\n| Education       | 24,491  | 39,085  | 41,376  |\n| Other heads     | 1,93,168| 2,06,440| 54,123  |\n| **Total expenditure** | **3,94,607** | **5,11,653** | **2,80,088** |\n\n* Figures for three years, 1803, 1804, and 1900.\n\u2020 'Other sources' includes income from pounds, hackney carriages, sale-proceeds of lands and produce of lands, conservancy receipts other than taxes and rates, fees from institutions, markets, slaughter-houses, &c., interest on investments, grants and contributions, and recoveries on account of services.\n\u2021 Including road-cleaning and watering and latrines.\n\nThe province is divided into two Public Works divisions, each under the charge of an Executive Engineer. The East Ber\u0101r division consists of the Districts of Amraoti and Yeotm\u0101l, and the West Ber\u0101r\ndivision of the Districts of Akola and Buldana. These two divisions are controlled by a Superintending Engineer, who was formerly also Secretary in the Public Works department to the Resident at Hyderab\u0101d, and had his head-quarters at Bolarum; but since Ber\u0101r has been transferred to the administration of the Central Provinces the head-quarters of the Superintending Engineer have been moved to N\u0101gpur.\n\nThe department carries out all Provincial public works and repairs, and also original works debitable to incorporated Local funds costing over Rs. 1,000. District boards carry out incorporated Local fund public works costing Rs. 1,000 and less, and all repairs in works other than Provincial public works.\n\nThe sum available for expenditure during the ten years ending 1891-2 averaged 11.1 lakhs, and for the next decade 14.6 lakhs. The normal expenditure was less in the latter than in the former period, but the large expenditure of 60 lakhs necessitated by the famine of 1899-1900 led to the increase in total expenditure during the latter decennium. The expenditure on civil works in 1901-2 and 1903-4 was 7.1 lakhs and 6.5 lakhs respectively.\n\nBer\u0101r contains no notable public works; but it is very well provided with roads, and communications are the principal item of expenditure. Civil buildings, such as court-houses, schools, dispensaries, police stations, &c., come next in importance to, but far behind, communications. No large schemes of municipal drainage have been taken in hand. A drainage project for Amraoti, the cost of which is estimated at nearly 5 lakhs, was prepared in 1891-2, but has not been begun owing to want of funds. The town and civil station of Amraoti, and the towns of Akola, Kh\u0101mgaon, and Buldana each have a system of artificial water-supply which, though ordinarily good, cannot withstand a long drought.\n\nThe number of soldiers stationed within the province on June 1, 1903, was 629, nearly all of whom belonged to the Native army. Ber\u0101r lies partly within the Mhow division of the Western Command and partly within the independent Secunderab\u0101d division. The only military station, Ellichpur (since vacated), was in the latter. The Ber\u0101r Volunteer Rifles, who numbered 125 in 1903, have their head-quarters company at Amraoti, and a second company at Akola.\n\nSoon after the Assignment steps were taken to organize a regular police force for the province. In 1870 this consisted of 2,613 officers and men, or one policeman to every 6.77 square miles of country and to every 849 of the population. Since then the increase has been trifling, and has failed to keep pace with the increase of population. The number of\nofficers and men in 1903 was 2,900, giving one policeman to every 6.1 square miles of country and to every 949 inhabitants. There are no rural police.\n\nThe force is recruited principally in the province, and the sanction of the Inspector-General of Police is necessary for the enlistment of men who are not natives of Ber\u0101r or the Deccan. The enlistment of Gurkhas, Sikhs, and frontier Path\u0101ns is prohibited; and the authorized proportions of various classes in the police are 40 per cent. Musalm\u0101ns, 20 per cent. Hindus of Hindust\u0101n, and 40 per cent. Hindus of the Deccan and other classes. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining suitable Hindus, it is sometimes necessary to enlist Musalm\u0101ns in excess of the fixed proportion.\n\nThe newly enlisted policeman is trained in each District in a school, where reading, writing, elementary arithmetic, drill, and the laws and departmental rules which apply to the duties of the police are taught. Four standards of examination have been framed for non-gazetted officers and constables, and promotion is chiefly regulated by the results of these examinations. Service in the police cannot be said to be popular among educated natives.\n\nNo special measures have been taken of late years to improve the status and character of the police force. The principal measure adopted for the repression of organized and habitual crime has been the closer supervision of Banj\u0101r\u0101 encampments or t\u0101nd\u0101s, which have in most cases been moved closer to the sites of the villages in the lands of which they are situated. Banj\u0101r\u0101s were formerly employed as detectives, but the measure was only partially successful; for they were not always trustworthy, and were of no further use when their occupation became known to their fellows. Anthropometry has been abandoned as a means of identifying criminals, and dactylography has taken its place. The finger-print records have been largely increased of late years, and the police should soon have a complete record of habitual criminals in the province.\n\n| Supervising Staff | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1904 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| District and Assistant Superintendent | 8    | 8    | 8    | 8    |\n| Inspectors        | 18   | 19   | 19   | 19   |\n\n| Subordinate Staff |      |      |      |      |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Chief constables  | 501  | 526  | 113  | 113  |\n| Head constables   | 430  | 430  |      |      |\n| Constables        | 2,134| 2,323| 2,330| 2,330|\n\nTotal | 2,651 | 2,876 | 2,900 | 2,900 |\nOf the District police, 56 are armed with batons only, 1,799 with swords, and 1,018 with smooth-bore carbines.\n\nThe railway police force consists of one inspector, 2 chief constables, 12 head constables, and 58 constables. Their range is the branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway which traverses the province, and they are under the control of the District Superintendents of Amraoti and Akola.\n\nThe table on p. 414 gives the sanctioned strength in the various ranks of the police at different periods:\n\nThe following table gives statistics of cognizable crime:\n\n|                                | Average for five years ending 1901 | 1903 | 1904 |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of cases reported       | 10,323                            | 9,318| 8,966|\n| Number of cases decided in the criminal courts | 7,374                            | 7,323| 6,883|\n| Number of cases ending in acquittal or discharge | 642                              | 499  | 488  |\n| Number of cases ending in conviction | 6,704                            | 6,858| 6,343|\n\nThe following table exhibits statistics of jails for the years 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1904:\n\n|                                | 1881    | 1891    | 1901    | 1904    |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of Central jails        | 2       | 2       | 2       | 2       |\n| Number of District jails       | 4       | 4       | 4       | 3       |\n| Number of Subsidiary jails (lock-ups) | 1       |         |         |         |\n| Average daily jail population: |         |         |         |         |\n| (a) Male                       |         |         |         |         |\n| In Central jails               | 1,033-53| 739-88  | 1,055-18| 543-49  |\n| In other jails                 | 181-86  | 214-85  | 256-11  | 153-13  |\n| (b) Female                     |         |         |         |         |\n| In Central jails               | 44-93   | 29-49   | 35-76   | 13-35   |\n| In other jails                 | 11-48   | 15-06   | 10-10   | 14-36   |\n| Total                          | 1,271-80| 990-28  | 1,357-15| 724-24  |\n\nRate of mortality per 1,000\n\nExpenditure on jail maintenance Rs.\n\nCost per prisoner Rs.\n\nProfits on jail manufactures Rs.\n\nEarnings per prisoner Rs.\nSince the redistribution of the Districts in August, 1905, the jails in Berar are classified as follows: the jails at Amraoti and Akola are Central jails, those at Buldana and Yeotmal District jails, and those at Ellichpur and Basim subsidiary jails.\n\nThe principal industries are: in the Amraoti jail, the lithographic printing of forms for official use, and weaving; and in the Akola jail, the manufacture of police and prison clothing, and weaving. Blankets are woven in both jails. In the small District jails coarse weaving, blanket-weaving, and oil pressing are the principal industries; and the prisoners in all jails provide for their own needs by tilling the jail gardens and grinding their own meal. Stone-breaking is the commonest form of unskilled labour. Different departments of the administration take the greater part of the jail produce. Textiles, such as towels, dusters, tape, &c., are sold by private arrangement.\n\nNeither under Hindu nor under Muhammadan rule were there any schools in Berar expressly supported by the Government. Brahmins in receipt of money-grants and inams taught Sanskrit and Marathi, in most instances for payment; and schools in which the Arabic of the Koran, Persian, and Urdu were taught were supported by wealthy Musalmans as a work of merit. The profession of teaching was regarded as derogatory, and was compared to the herding of cattle. In 1862 a few Marathi and Anglo-Marathi schools were established and placed under District officers; and in 1866, when there were 35 schools with an attendance of 1,881 pupils, a department of Public Instruction was organized under the control of a Director, assisted by a Deputy-Inspector for each District. Two European Inspectors were next appointed, but after 1873 there was only one Inspector for the whole province. In 1903 the administration of Berar was transferred to the Central Provinces, and the supervising agency under the Director of Public Instruction for both areas now consists in Berar of one European Circle Inspector, and eleven Deputy and Sub-Deputy-Inspectors.\n\nThere is no college in Berar, but scholarships are tenable in the Arts, Science, and Medical colleges of the Bombay Presidency by candidates from the Berar high schools. The educational authorities in Berar are not directly concerned with the further education of those who proceed to these colleges. In 1881 nine, in 1891 fifteen, and in 1903 twenty-seven students from Berar matriculated, and the average annual number of graduates for the last fourteen years has been two.\n\nSecondary schools are of two classes: namely, high and middle schools, English being taught in both. There are seven standards in the curriculum of English education, the first three of which form the middle school course. The first English, which succeeds the fourth vernacular standard, includes arithmetic to the end of compound pro-\nportion, reading and writing the vernacular, history and geography, and elementary instruction in English. These subjects, together with grammar, constitute the middle school course, a wider knowledge of each subject being of course required in each successive standard. The high school course begins with the fourth standard. To the subjects already taught elementary algebra and drawing are added, a classical language, Sanskrit or Persian, may be substituted for the vernacular, and geography and history are taught in English. In the fifth standard Euclid and easy English composition are begun. The sixth standard is similar, but more advanced; and the seventh is the matriculation standard of the Bombay University. There is a private unaided high and middle school at Amraoti. The proportion of boys undergoing secondary instruction to the total male population of school-going age in 1904 was 6.05 per cent.\n\nThere are six purely vernacular standards. In the first standard the pupil learns reading, the writing of the alphabet, and elementary arithmetic; in the third, geography; in the fourth, elementary hygiene and history; and in the sixth, the first book of Euclid and\u2014as an optional subject\u2014land measurement are added to the curriculum.\n\nPrimary schools are under the management of municipalities and District boards. In addition to the cess of 3 pies per rupee of land revenue, the contribution of Government towards their maintenance consists of a grant from Provincial revenues, which is made over to District boards. Municipalities supply two-thirds of the expenditure on primary schools in towns, one-third being contributed from Provincial revenues. A few municipalities receive subsidies from District boards. The pay of teachers in primary schools ranges from Rs. 10 to Rs. 35. A tendency to cultivate the memory rather than the intelligence of pupils is still noticeable, but it is probable that this defect will disappear by degrees, now that the proportion of trained teachers is increasing. The proportion of boys under primary instruction to the total male population of school-going age in 1904 was 17.21 per cent.\n\nFemale education has not yet advanced beyond the primary stage. The number of girls' schools was 12 in 1881, 48 in 1891, and 47 (including 3 private institutions) in 1904: the proportion of female scholars to the female population of school-going age in those years was 0.14, 0.22, and 1.12 per cent. Girls' schools are supported and managed by municipalities and District boards. The subjects taught are reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, plain needlework, knitting, and fancy work. Progress has been fairly satisfactory; but the people in general still need to be convinced that female education is a good thing. A great obstacle in the way of any thorough teaching is the practice of withdrawing girls from school at a very early age, due, among Hindus, to the custom of infant marriage, and, among Muhammadans, to the general\nfeeling that a girl who has attained the age of puberty, which may be fixed at about twelve, is better at home than at school.\n\nThe training school for teachers at Akola is a useful institution. It contains Marathi and Hindustani divisions, and was attended in 1881 by 71 teachers, in 1891 by 91, and in 1904 by 47. The Government industrial school at Amraoti is at present an unimportant institution, with an attendance of 12. The Alliance Mission Workshop at Akola is an industrial school under competent management, with an attendance of 29. Instruction is given in ironwork, carpentry, and other handicrafts, and the pupils are generally well started in the world. In the Korku Mission school at Ellichpur, 62 pupils are taught masonry, painting, smiths' work, and carpentry.\n\nThe Convent school and the Anglican school at Amraoti are the only schools for Europeans and Eurasians in the province. Both are mixed schools. In 1904 the former had on its rolls 17 boys and 27 girls, and the latter 11 boys and 3 girls. The highest standard in the former was the seventh, and in the latter the fifth, and the two schools received monthly grants of Rs. 100 and Rs. 40. Boys have usually proceeded from these schools to others before making a start in life.\n\nFrom the following table, which shows for the three census years 1881, 1891, and 1901 the percentage of Muhammadan and Hindu boys attending secondary and primary schools to the total male population of school-going age of each class, it will be seen that in Berar Musalmans are not behind Hindus in appreciating the benefits of education:\n\n|                  | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 |\n|------------------|------|------|------|\n| Musalmans        |      |      |      |\n| In secondary schools | 0.03 | 0.08 | 1.46 |\n| In primary schools | 17.07| 9.45 | 25.91|\n| Hindus            |      |      |      |\n| In secondary schools | 1.36 | 1.24 | 1.13 |\n| In primary schools | 12.28| 19.91| 10.0 |\n\nThese figures, however, include all classes of Hindus, the more backward castes among whom have hardly been touched by education; and it must be understood that Musalmans as a class are far less anxious for education than Brahmins and other advanced castes among Hindus. Satisfactory progress has, nevertheless, been made. The establishment of separate Hindustani schools, the existence of which dates back almost to the introduction of a system of education, can hardly be mentioned as an instance of special encouragement, for the Musalman has as much right to receive instruction through the medium of his mother tongue as the Maratha has to receive it through the medium of his. Musalmans are, however, encouraged by being treated leniently in the matter of fees. The standards and the subjects taught in Hindustani schools are similar to those in the curriculum for Marathi schools; but instruction\nis conveyed in Urdu, and in the first standard no Marathi is taught. In the second and subsequent standards the pupil learns Marathi; but after the fourth standard he may proceed to the middle-school course, when he may abandon Marathi and take Urdu as his sole vernacular language, or he may complete his vernacular education by going on to the fifth and sixth standards.\n\nIt has occasionally been necessary to open here and there special schools for the lowest castes, such as Mahars and Mangs, but the last of these schools was closed in 1902 for want of attendance. The need for these institutions no longer exists, as the prejudice which prevented low-caste boys from attending ordinary schools has given way to a more enlightened feeling.\n\nThere are two schools in the Melghat for Korkus, among whom education is making fair progress, though none have yet passed beyond the primary stage. In 1891 only 127 Korkus attended school, and in 1904 the returns show only 38 Korku girls at these schools.\n\n### Educational Finance in Berar, 1903-4\n\n| Expenditure on institutions maintained or aided by public funds from | Provincial revenues | District and municipal funds | Fees | Other sources | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Secondary schools | Rs. 59,048 | Rs. 184 | Rs. 17,073 | Rs. 7,574 | Rs. 83,876 |\n| Primary schools | Rs. 25,977 | Rs. 228,800 | Rs. 20,226 | Rs. 23,708 | Rs. 298,711 |\n| Training and special schools | Rs. 8,863 | Rs. 1,082 | Rs. 295 | ... | Rs. 10,240 |\n| **Total** | Rs. 93,888 | Rs. 330,063 | Rs. 37,594 | Rs. 31,282 | Rs. 392,847 |\n\nThe following figures show the percentage of males and females of school-going age under instruction in the three last census years:\n\n| Year | Males | Females |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1881 | 6.41 | 0.14 |\n| 1891 | 7.0 | 0.22 |\n| 1901 | 12.12 | 1.12 |\n\nEducation has made considerable progress. In 1901, 8.53 per cent. of the male and 0.31 of the female population could read and write. Ellichpur and Amraoti Districts are the most advanced, and Wun is the most backward in respect of education. The Brahmins are the most highly educated section of the indigenous population, and the Kolams, among whom not a single person can read or write, the most ignorant. The Banjaras, Andhs, and Mangs are little better than the Kolams.\n### Educational Statistics in Berar\n\n| Class of institutions | Number of institutions | Scholars | Number of institutions | Scholars | Number of institutions | Scholars | Number of institutions | Scholars |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|----------|------------------------|----------|------------------------|----------|------------------------|----------|\n|                       |                        | Male     | Female                 | Male     | Female                 | Male     | Female                 | Male     | Female                 |\n| **Public**            |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |\n| Secondary schools:    |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |\n| Upper (High)          | 2                      | 54       | ...                    | 2        | 491                    | ...      | 3                      | 570      | ...                    |\n| Lower (Middle)        | 5                      | 196      | ...                    | 24       | 4,268                  | ...      | 25                     | 3,613    | ...                    |\n| Primary schools       | 867                    | 31,507   | 393                    | 1,247    | 43,659                 | 1,764    | 999                    | 39,080   | 2,835                  |\n| Training schools      | ...                    | ...      | ...                    | 1        | 91                     | ...      | 1                      | 57       | ...                    |\n| Other special schools | 1                      | 71       | ...                    | 1        | 25                     | ...      | 3                      | 93       | ...                    |\n| **Private**           |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |\n| Advanced              | ...                    | ...      | ...                    | 6        | 99                     | ...      | 2                      | 65       | ...                    |\n| Elementary            | ...                    | ...      | ...                    | 6        | 32                     | 3        | 3                      | 145      | 213                    |\n| Total                 | 875                    | 31,828   | 393                    | 1,287    | 48,575                 | 1,767    | 1,036                  | 43,623   | 3,952                  |\n|                       |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |          |                        |\n\nBERAR\nMonthly fees in primary schools range from 2 annas for the first two standards to 6 annas for the sixth; in middle schools from 8 to 12 annas; and in high schools from Rs. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2-0-0.\n\nNo English newspapers are published. In 1904 six Marathi papers were published, one of which had English columns. Their circulation is local, and they have little influence. Twelve books, all in Marathi, were registered in 1904. The books published in the province deal principally with religious and social subjects, and cannot be said to contain evidence of original research.\n\nSoon after the Assignment in 1853, steps were taken to provide medical aid by the establishment of hospitals and dispensaries, the administration of which was entrusted to Civil Surgeons of Districts. By 1871 there were 3 civil hospitals and 20 charitable dispensaries in the province. The progressive increase in the number of these institutions is shown in the table below. In 1895 a hospital for females was opened in Amravati under the auspices of the Lady Dufferin Fund Committee. This institution has made satisfactory, though not rapid, progress. The average annual numbers of in-patients, out-patients, and operations since its establishment have been 159, 6,069, and 153.\n\n**Statistics of Medical Institutions and Vaccination in Berar**\n\n| Hospitals, &c. | 1881 | 1891 | 1901 | 1903-4 |\n|---------------|------|------|------|--------|\n| Number of civil hospitals and dispensaries | 36   | 44   | 47   | 47     |\n| Average daily number of:\u2014 |      |      |      |        |\n| (a) In-patients | 77.25| 100  | 161.08| 126.15 |\n| (b) Out-patients | 1,437.17| 1,803.97| 2,103.10| 2,056.98 |\n| Income from:\u2014 |      |      |      |        |\n| (a) Government payments | Rs. 81,614| Rs. 82,975| Rs. 60,035| Rs. 65,312* |\n| (b) Local and municipal payments | Rs. 8,064| Rs. 20,119| Rs. 20,234| Rs. 15,788* |\n| (c) Fees, endowments, and other sources | Rs. 10,062| Rs. 4,940| Rs. 4,405| Rs. 8,294* |\n| Expenditure on:\u2014 |      |      |      |        |\n| (a) Establishment | Rs. 74,058| Rs. 76,959| Rs. 48,987| Rs. 52,567 |\n| (b) Medicines, diet, buildings, &c. | Rs. 18,564| Rs. 22,405| Rs. 27,113| Rs. 28,274 |\n\n**Vaccination.**\n\n| Population among whom vaccination was carried on | 2,672,673| 2,897,040| 2,897,040| 2,754,016 |\n| Number of successful operations | 81,000| 102,596| 86,483| 100,751 |\n| Ratio per 1,000 of population | 30.8| 36| 29.9| 36.58 |\n| Total expenditure on vaccination Rs. | 17,192| 16,660| 17,626| 17,325 |\n| Cost per successful case Rs. | 0.35| 0.27| 0.33| 0.29 |\n\n* These figures are for the calendar year 1903. Information for the official year 1903-4 is not available.\nNo lunatic asylum has been established in the province, and lunatics for whose custody it is necessary to provide are sent to the asylum at Nagpur. The principal causes of insanity are said to be the abuse of alcohol and narcotic drugs, enforced widowhood among Hindus and the zanana system among Musalmans, physical ailments, and pecuniary losses.\n\nThere was no indigenous method of inoculation in Berar before the introduction of vaccination by the British Government, and it seems that vaccination was at first regarded, if not with disfavour, at least as an innovation of doubtful utility. This feeling has been gradually removed.\n\nThe pice-packet system of selling quinine through the agency of the Post Office was introduced in January, 1895, in which year 1,337 packets were sold. In 1896 the aid of the Forest department was enlisted. In 1904 the total number of packets sold was 281,729, and it is evident that the people are awakening to the value of this drug.\n\nVillage sanitation is attended to by village officials and by rural boards under the advice and encouragement of District sanitary boards and of officials on tour; but very much remains to be done in this direction, and it cannot be said that any considerable number of the people have as yet any knowledge of elementary sanitary principles.\n\nThe revenue survey of Berar was begun in 1853-4, the year of Assignment, in the Malkapur taluk. In 1855-6 and 1857-8 the B\u0101l\u0101pur taluk was surveyed, and the survey of the taluks which then existed proceeded in the following order: Jalgaon (1857-8), Mehkar (1860-1), Akot, Chikhli, Daryapur, and Murtazapur (1861-2). In the Berar revenue survey areas are calculated by the English acre, divided into 40 guntas, each gunta being subdivided into 16 'annas.' The chain used is 33 feet long, and is composed of 16 links. A gunta is one square chain, and an 'anna' is one chain long by one link broad. Native surveyors survey with the chain and a cross staff, and a proportion of their work is checked by the survey officer. The original survey of the province was generally checked and revised between 1891 and 1901, but the survey of the Kelapur and W\u00fcn taluks has yet to be revised. Munsarims, under the control of Deputy-Commissioners and the department of Land Records and Agriculture, are entrusted with the duty of keeping surveys up to date. Many of the patw\u0101ris go through a course of surveying in the Survey Training School at Akola.\n\n[A. C. Lyall, Berar Gazetteer (1870); The Gazetteer of Aurangabad (1884); Dr. R. G.

Population (1901), 4,276. Under Akbar, Berasi\u0101 was included in the sark\u0101r of Raisen in the S\u016bbah of M\u0101lw\u0101. In 1709 Dost Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n acquired the neighbouring country on lease, and by rapidly extending his dominions founded the Bhop\u0101l State. In the eighteenth century the tract was seized by Jaswant Rao Ponw\u0101r of Dh\u0101r, and subsequently fell to Amir Kh\u0101n, who made it over in j\u0101g\u012br to the famous Pind\u0101ri leader Kar\u012bm Kh\u0101n. After the suppression of the Pind\u0101ris in 1817 it was restored to Dh\u0101r, but was confiscated in 1859, and in the following year was made over to Bhop\u0101l as a reward for services rendered during the Mutiny. In the town stands a mosque built by Dost Mu\u1e25ammad in 1716, which contains the tomb of his father, N\u016br Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n. Besides the usual offices, a school, a dispensary, and a British and a State post office are maintained here.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata":
