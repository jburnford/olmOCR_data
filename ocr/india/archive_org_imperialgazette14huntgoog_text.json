Bounded on the north by the Orissa Tributary States of Nay\u00e1garh, Daspalla, and Bod, of Bengal; on the east by the Bengal District of P\u00fari and the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by the Feudatory States of Kal\u00e1h\u00e1nd\u00ed and Patn\u00e1 of the Central Provinces, and Vizagapatam District of the Madras Presidency. Area, 8311 square miles, of which 5205 square miles are in the Agency or Hill Tracts. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,749,604. In point of size, Ganj\u00e1m District ranks sixth amongst the Districts of the Madras Presidency. Geographically the District divides itself into the M\u00e1li\u00e1hs or Hill Tracts, and the Plain country, and contains 16 large and 35 minor zamind\u00e1r\u00eds or proprietary estates, besides 3 Government t\u00e1luks. There are altogether 16 towns, of which 2 are municipalities, and 6879 villages; of the latter, 2706 are in the Agency Tracts. Berhampur is the chief town of the District, and is also a military cantonment.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is mountainous and rocky, but interspersed with valleys and fertile plains. In shape it resembles an hourglass, contracted in the centre, where the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts nearly meet the sea, and widening out in the north and south into undulating plains. Pleasant groves of trees give to the scenery a greener appearance than is usually met with in the plains farther to the south; whilst rugged mountains, frequently covered with dense jungle, relieve the eye. A chain of fresh-water or brackish lakes runs all along the coast, being separated from the sea by narrow strips of sand. Salt swamps and backwaters are also not uncommon. The chain of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, known as the M\u00e1li\u00e1hs\nor M\u00e1liy\u00e1s, which occupies the western portion of the District, has several well-defined gaps. On the Bod frontier it has a general elevation of about 2000 feet (the axis of the chain being here farther eastward and about 2500 feet high); west of Daringabadi the peaks rise above 4000 feet, and the general elevation exceeds 3000 feet. A gap occurs where the chain is pierced by the 'Hot Springs' Pass, and here 1800 feet is the summit level for some distance. In the Pedda Kimedi and Parla Kimedi Hills, the chain is over 3000 feet, and the peaks approach to near 5000 feet. The principal peaks are\u2014Mahendragiri (4923 feet), Singh\u00e1r\u00e1j (4976), and Deodong\u00e1 (4534). The passes which lead from the low country of Ganj\u00e1m into the M\u00e1liy\u00e1s, along their entire length of some 140 miles, are very numerous; but only one, the Kalinga Gh\u00e1t, possesses a road available for wheeled traffic. Many of the passes are, however, practicable for elephants and other beasts of burden, although the paths are generally rocky, rugged, and steep. The chief rivers are\u2014(1) the Rishikulya in the north, which rises in the hills beyond the District boundary, and, after a course of about 100 miles, falls into the sea near Ganj\u00e1m town; this river is not ordinarily navigable, but rafts can be floated down it in the flood season between June and November: (2) the Vamsadh\u00e1ra, which rises in the Jaipur (Jeypore) Hills, and, after a course of about 145 miles, falls into the sea near Kalingapatam in the south of the District; it is more or less navigable for about 70 miles from its mouth: (3) the L\u00e1nguliya, which takes its rise in Kal\u00e1h\u00e1nd\u00ed, and, after flowing for about 115 miles, enters the sea near M\u00e1ph\u00faz Bandar. Besides these rivers, there are numerous mountain streams and torrents, which are utilized for the purposes of irrigation. The banks of the rivers are usually steep and high, and there is in all of them a great tendency to accumulate silt. Their channels dry up in the hot season, but during the rains between June and November they are usually in full flood. Owing to the vicinity of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts to the sea, however, the floods subside with rapidity; and from the same cause the rise of the waters in the rivers is frequently so great as to cause considerable damage to property, and not unfrequently loss of life. Sea and river fisheries form an important industry, and the fishing castes were returned in 1881 at 41,856, or 2\u00b748 per cent. of the Hindu population. Pearl oysters, of an inferior quality, are found in the Son\u00e1pur backwater, and in the canal which runs from the Chilk\u00e1 Lake to the Rishikulya river. Iron-ore, limestone, building stone, sandstone, talc, and crystal comprise the mineral products. Timber forests are numerous and extensive, consisting chiefly of s\u00e1l, with satin-wood, sandal, and ebony in smaller quantities. Beeswax, honey, turmeric, and myrabolans are jungle products, and important articles of commerce, being sold by the hill Kandhs (Khonds) to the low-country merchants. Wide grazing grounds\nexist, which afford pasturage to large herds of cattle. Wild beasts are numerous in the hills.\n\n**History.**\u2014Ganj\u00e1m anciently formed part of the southern kingdom of Kalinga. Its early history is involved in obscurity, and it was not until the long line of Gajapati or Ganga-vansa kings (1132\u20131532) occupied Orissa that the adjoining District of Ganj\u00e1m was annexed to that Province. Owing to the nature of the country, Ganj\u00e1m was only nominally reduced by the Musalm\u00e1ns, who overran Orissa from Bengal for the first time about 1568. In 1641, the king of the Kutab-Sh\u00e1hi kingdom sent a deputy, Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, to Chikakol (Chicacole) to rule over the country as its first Faujd\u00e1r. The present District of Ganj\u00e1m formed under the Musalm\u00e1ns a part of the Chikakol C\u00edrcar, and the country south of the Rishikuliya river at Ganj\u00e1m, as far as K\u00e1sib\u00fag\u00e1, was known by the name of the Ich\u00e1pur Province. Successive Faujd\u00e1rs and N\u00e1ibs continued to rule over the Chikakol C\u00edrcar until 1753, in which year the Northern C\u00edrcars were granted to the French by the Niz\u00e1m, Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Jang, to cover the pay and equipment of the French auxiliaries in his service. M. de Bussy, who managed the affairs of the French at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d in the Deccan, proceeded to the Northern C\u00edrcars in person in 1757, in order to secure the revenues on behalf of his native allies. After reducing the country as far as G\u00famsar, on the south-west border of Ganj\u00e1m, M. de Bussy was obliged to return, being recalled by M. Lally, the Governor of Pondicherri, who required his services at the siege of Madras (1758). In 1759, an expeditionary force under Colonel Forde, sent from Bengal by Clive, was successful in taking Masulipatam; and upon the key of their position in the Northern C\u00edrcars falling into the hands of the English, the French found themselves obliged to abandon Ganj\u00e1m and their other factories in the north. In 1765, the Northern C\u00edrcars were granted to the English by the Mughal Emperor's *farm\u00e1n*, dated the 12th August 1765; but it was not until the 12th November 1766, that Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed, the S\u00fabah of the Deccan, agreed to ratify this *farm\u00e1n* by actually ceding the country to the English. In August 1768, Mr. Edward Cotsford took possession of Ganj\u00e1m as the first English Resident, and founded an English factory there, which he secured by means of a small fort. From 1768 down to 1802, the Ichh\u00e1pur Province was ruled by a succession of Residents, Chiefs in Council, and Collectors; and in the latter year, the country south of the P\u00fandi river, as far as Chikakol, was formed into the present District of Ganj\u00e1m. The earlier records (1768\u20131802) of the District show that the *zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs* were accustomed to pay their tributes only under actual pressure; and that the country was continually in a state of disturbance and confusion. Plunder, rapine, murders, and incendiarism were common; and one *zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r* had to be reduced by troops. In 1815, a severe epidemic fever prevailed in\nthe town of Ganj\u00e1m, and carried off about 20,000 people in the course of the three years that it raged in the District. In 1816, the Pind\u00e1ris came down upon the Parla Kimedi zamind\u00e1rs, and spread fire and sword from Ichhapur to Ganj\u00e1m. In 1819, the disturbances in the Parla Kimedi and Mohirr zamind\u00e1rs had risen to such a height, that Government sent Mr. Thackeray to Ganj\u00e1m, as Special Commissioner, to devise means for quieting the country. It needed the presence of a strong body of regular troops to crush the spirit of insubordination which had been fostered in the District by many years of a weak and vacillating policy. In 1834-35, the Parla Kimedi campaign took place, Brigadier-General Taylor in command. The judicious measures of Mr. George Russell, the Special Commissioner in this and the two succeeding G\u00fams\u00far campaigns of 1835-37, did much to place the country on a more satisfactory footing, by reducing the two most refractory and influential zamind\u00e1rs in the District. The first contact of the English with the aboriginal KANDHS (Khonds) occurred in 1836, when it was discovered that they were addicted to the practice of human sacrifice (meriah). A special Agency, under European officers, was deputed to the tract, and succeeded in inducing the Kandhs to abandon the rite. In 1865, a partial rising of the Kandhs took place, but it was of an unimportant character, and was suppressed without the aid of regular troops. Since then the District has enjoyed undisturbed peace. (For further details, see Hunter's Orissa, vol. i. 18, ii. 49-53, and article KANDHS.)\n\nPopulation.\u2014A Census of the District taken in 1871 returned a total population of 1,520,088, inclusive of the people of the hills. The last Census of 1881 returned the number at 1,749,604, or an increase of 229,516 in ten years. Of the whole number returned in 1881, 246,303 inhabited the Hill Tracts, namely, 130,042 males and 116,261 females. The remainder, namely, 739,423 males and 763,878 females, total 1,503,301, inhabited the plains portion of the District. Scattered over the lowlands and highlands are 16 towns and 6879 villages. The number of houses is 336,646, of which 58,565 are in the Hill Tracts. This gives a proportion of 5\u00b74 persons per house in the plains, and 4\u00b72 in the hills. In density of population, Ganj\u00e1m ranks third among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. The proportion in the plains is 484 persons to the square mile, being next to Tanjore and Vizagapatam Districts, and more than double the average. The proportion of males to females is 497 to 503 in every 1000 of the population. The number of children under 10 years were returned at 449,071, or 221,590 boys and 227,481 girls; between 10 and 20 years there were 159,293 males and 141,948 females, total 301,241. So that nearly half the population of the District are under 20 years of\nThe population is composed almost entirely of Hindus, of whom there were\u2014males 865,229, females 875,945, total 1,741,174, or 99\u00b758 per cent., distributed as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 127,869; Kshatriyas (warriors), 4,143; Shettis (traders), 23,683; Vall\u00e1lars (agriculturists), 461,995; Idaiyars (shepherds), 56,567; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans), 44,970; Kanakkan (writers), 25,665; Kaikalars (weavers), 38,104; Vanniy\u00e1ns (labourers), 42,712; Kushaw\u00e1ns (potters), 15,660; S\u00e1t\u00e1n\u00eds (mixed castes), 29,670; Shambadavans (fishermen), 41,856; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1ns (toddy-drawers), 44,467; Ambattans (barbers), 25,206; Vann\u00e1ns (washermen), 40,462; Pariahs, 198,179; other castes not specified, 464,853. The Muhammadans numbered only 6073; Christians, 1551, of whom 129 were Europeans, and 222 Eurasians; Jains and Buddhists, 270; and \u2018others,\u2019 536. Sixty per cent. of the Christians are Roman Catholics. The distribution by occupation was as follows:\u2014Under Class I., or professional, 29,843, or 1\u00b771 per cent.; under Class II., or domestic, 22,133, or 1\u00b726 per cent.; under Class III., or commercial, 21,523, or 1\u00b723 per cent.; under Class IV., or agricultural, 568,843, or 32\u00b751 per cent.; under Class V., or industrial, 180,382, or 10\u00b731 per cent.; and under Class VI., or indefinite and non-productive, 926,880, or 52\u00b798 per cent. Of the total population, 53\u00b787 are employed in work, while 46\u00b713 are dependent on them for support. Of the males, 63\u00b727 per cent., and of the females, 44\u00b759 are employed. There were in the plains, educated or under instruction, 61,406 persons, including 4268 females. The languages of the plains of Ganj\u00e1m are Telugu and Uriy\u00e1, while Kandh and Savar\u00e1 are the languages of the tribes in the hills known by those names. The aboriginal tribes are principally Kandhs and Savar\u00e1s, who have now nearly all embraced some form of Hinduism, and are included in the general number of Hindus returned above. Ethnically, the Uriy\u00e1ns (777,558) form the largest part of the District population, the remainder being for the most part Telugus (692,931). Their manners and customs differ, and they speak a distinct language. The Uriy\u00e1ns are chiefly found in the north of the District, extending as far south as Parla Kimedi. South of K\u00e1sib\u00fag\u00e1, and throughout the Chikakol taluk, the larger number of the inhabitants are Telugus. There is, however, no clearly-defined line between the country occupied by the two races. The principal towns in Ganj\u00e1m are\u2014Berhampur (1881), 23,599; Parla Kimedi, 10,812; Chikakol, 16,355; Ichhapur, 5528; Baruva, 4298; Raghunathapuram, 7634; Kalingapatam, 4465; Aska, 3909; Ganjam, 5037; Gopalpur, 2675; Boyarani, 3339; Harimandalam, 3089; Mandasa, 4671; Narsannapet, 8230; Purushottapur, 3962; and Surada, 3594. Gop\u00e1lpur is the chief seaport of the District: the others are Ganj\u00e1m, B\u00e1r\u00edva, and Kalingapatam. The only municipalities are Berhampur and Chikakol.\nAgriculture.\u2014Agricultural operations commence in June, during which month the rains of the south-west monsoon usually begin to fall. In June the early dry grains and rice intended for transplanting are sown. Rice is sometimes sown broadcast, but is usually transplanted from specially prepared seed-beds. In July and September an ample and continued supply of water is essential to the growth of the young plants. The reaping of the rice crop commences soon after the 1st November, and sometimes lasts until the 15th January, according as the season has been early or late. An early season betokens, as a rule, a favourable harvest. The dry grain crops (i.e. those grown upon unirrigated land) and early rice are reaped between the 1st September and the 15th October. The after-crop of dry grains continues, however, to be reaped from the middle of February to the beginning of April. A second crop of rice in Ganj\u00e1m is almost unknown; it occurs, however, in a tract of land not far from Ich\u00e1pur, bordering upon the sea. Neither cotton nor fibre cultivation is pursued to any considerable extent. The sugar-cane grown in Ganj\u00e1m is of excellent quality, and is said to be the best in India. It demands more care and attention, however, than any other crop, and is never grown for two years in succession on the same land. The soil requires to be well manured with oilcake or other suitable manure. Sugar-cane is estimated to require one-third more water than rice, and takes ten months before it reaches maturity. In spite of these drawbacks, however, the crop is exceedingly profitable to the peasant who can afford to grow it. Sugar-cane is chiefly cultivated about Aska. The total area of the District amounts to 8311 square miles, of which 5205 are comprised in the M\u00e1liy\u00e1 Hill Tracts, and 3106 form the plains portion. The total cultivated area returned in 1881\u201382 was 428,337 acres (or nearly one-twelfth of the total area of the District), of which 203,184 acres were irrigated. The uncultivated area consisted of 70,763 acres of cultivable land, 28,139 acres of pasture and forest lands, and 147,090 acres of uncultivable waste; the total area assessed was 495,824 acres, and the total assessment amounted to \u00a397,059. Of the cultivated area, cereals occupied 353,333 acres; pulses, 19,755 acres; orchards and garden produce, 14,838 acres; tobacco, 2015 acres; condiments and spices, 2090 acres; sugar-cane, 4123 acres; oil-seeds, 27,564 acres; and fibres, 4445 acres, including 4093 acres under cotton. The Imperial and minor irrigation works of the District comprise 45 irrigation channels, 112 large and 2661 minor tanks, which irrigated in 1881\u201382 a total area of 268,135 acres, yielding a water revenue of \u00a354,517. Rice occupies about two-thirds of the area under grain cultivation. The agricultural stock of the District in 1881\u201382 consisted of 26,537 buffaloes, 81,400 bullocks, 66,279 cows, 157 horses and ponies, 561 donkeys, 1827 pigs, 25,768 goats, 12,093\nsheep, 13,874 carts, and 47,440 ploughs. The peasantry, as a class, are poor, and generally in debt to the money-lenders, forestalling their crops by borrowing, or by selling the produce at a cheap rate for payment in advance. An average holding consists of about 8 acres, paying a yearly rental of about \u00a32. The average rates of wages in 1881-82 were, for ordinary labourers, from 2d. to 3d. per day; and for blacksmiths, carpenters, and other skilled labourers, 6d. to 8d. Prices of rice and food-grains have risen to more than double the rates prevailing in 1850, and in the case of rice, to treble the former rates. The rates in 1881, per maund of 80 lbs., were as follow:\u2014Rice, 4s.; ragi (Eleusine coracana), 2s. 2d.; kambu (Panicum spicatum), 2s.; millet, 2s. 3d.; wheat, 5s. 1d.; pulses, from 5s. 3d. to 2s. 6\u00bdd.; salt, 6s. 10\u00bdd.; sugar, 21s. 10d.; gingelly, 6s.; tobacco, 22s.; cotton, 14s. 2d.; and sheep, 3s. 6d. each. Tenures are of three kinds\u2014(1) R\u0101y\u0101ntvadri, or small farms held by individuals direct from Government; (2) koshtigutta, in which whole villages unite in holding lands in common, direct from Government, with joint responsibility for rent; (3) mustas\u0101dri, or the farming-out system, which is confined to the zamind\u0101r\u012b tracts. By the last system lands are put up to auction, either in lots or entire villages, and knocked down to the highest bidder, who is left to make what profit he can out of the actual cultivators.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Famines, caused by flood and drought, are the principal natural calamities to which the District is liable. The chief scarcities have been in 1789-92, 1799-1801, 1836-39, and 1865-66. The great famine of 1865-66 was principally confined to the northern portion of the District, but its ravages did not reach the same intensity as in Orissa. This famine was caused by the failure of the rains, following upon two years of partial scarcity in 1863 and 1864. It is estimated that 60,000 persons perished, either from starvation or from diseases induced by privation. The cost of relief was about \u00a337,500.\n\nCommunications, Manufactures, etc.\u2014The District contains 664 miles of made roads and 26 miles of canals in the plains, besides 323 miles of roads in the hill country. A tidal canal, 9 miles long, connects the Chilk\u0101 lake with the Rishikulya river. Ganj\u0101m was formerly the seat of an important factory of the East India Company, and its looms supplied a considerable share of the annual 'Investment' from the Madras coast. The manufactures of the District are now chiefly confined to those required for local consumption. Muslin, handsomely finished with gold thread, is made in Chikakol. Sugar and rum factories exist at Aska. The sugar manufacture is a modification of the German method. It consists in chopping up the cane into small shavings by rapidly-revolving knives, and extracting the juice by\nthoroughly saturating the cane in water. Fine white sugar can be refined within 48 hours after commencing the process. In 1880, the out-turn by the German process was valued at \u00a316,000. The rum is manufactured chiefly out of the surplus syrup which it is not found profitable to convert into sugar. For making country spirits, rice and mahua flowers (Bassia latifolia) are used. Cognac and milk punch are also manufactured in the Aska sugar factory. Annual out-turn of rum, 150,000 gallons. The season of sugar manufacture is from January to the end of March. Salt manufacture is a Government monopoly, and is carried on at Ganjam, Naupada, and Vomaravilli.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District, which contains, besides the Hill tracts, the three Government taluks of Berhampur, Chikakol, and Gumsar, is administered by a Collector-Magistrate, who is the chief executive and revenue officer, aided by 3 European Assistants, a District Judge, 4 District munisifs, a superintendent of police, and a staff of subordinate English and native officials. The Agency tracts are administered by a judge and 4 munisifs. In 1805-6, the total revenue amounted to \u00a388,512, and the expenditure to \u00a361,43; in 1850-51, the revenue was \u00a3136,144, and the expenditure \u00a322,325; while by 1881-82, the gross revenue had increased to \u00a3395,879. The principal items of Imperial revenue are land, which yielded in 1881-82, \u00a3118,459; excise, \u00a312,077; assessed taxes, \u00a31225; sea customs, \u00a313,270; salt, \u00a3237,938; and stamps, \u00a312,912. For the protection of person and property, there are 26 magisterial and 13 civil and revenue courts in the District. The regular police numbered 1356 officers and men of all ranks in 1881-82, costing \u00a321,612, and showing a proportion of 1 policeman to every 6\u00b71 square miles of country, and to every 1290 of the population. The average daily number of prisoners in the District jail at Berhampur was 130, and at Russellkonda Hill jail, 126, maintained at a total cost of \u00a31967, or \u00a37, 12s. 9d. per head of average strength. Education is comparatively forward, 8\u00b73 per cent. of the population of the plains being able to read and write. In 1881-82 there were in the District 850 schools, attended by 17,312 pupils, besides 17 hill schools, attended by about 960 boys.

Area, 553 square miles, with 300 villages. Population (1881) 78,513, namely,\n39,357 males and 39,156 females; number of houses, 13,651. Hindus numbered 78,309; Muhammadans, 196; and Christians, 8.\n\n**Ganj\u00e1m.**\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 22' 27\" N., long. 85\u00b0 7' E. Formerly the capital of the District to which it gives its name, situated at the mouth of the Rishikuliya river, 697 miles north-east of Madras, 315 miles south-west of Calcutta. Population (1881) 5037, namely, 4995 Hindus, 27 Muhammadans, 14 Christians, and 1 unspecified. The town itself and the remains of the old pentagon fort are on a rising slope; but north of the town the ground is low and feverish. It was formerly a seat of considerable trade, and of a Factory and Fort (1768) presided over by a Chief and Council; but since the removal to Berhampur of the head-quarters of the District in 1815, Ganj\u00e1m has declined in size and importance. The removal was occasioned by an epidemic fever which carried off a large proportion of the inhabitants, both European and native. The sanitary condition of the town has been much improved of late. While it remained the chief town, Ganj\u00e1m was remarkable for the magnificence of its European residences. Some of these still exist, as also the remains of the old forts (see Hunter's Orissa, vol. i. p. 17). The Government salt manufacture forms now the principal industry. The fort of Ganj\u00e1m is situated at the mouth of the Rishikuliya river, but has no harbour, and the heavy surf and constant shifting of the sand-banks render it difficult of access. There is a mud dock for the repair of native vessels. European steamers occasionally visit the port. The chief trade consists of the export of rice.\n\n**Ganj\u00e1m.**\u2014River in the Madras Presidency.\u2014See RISHIKULIYA.\n\n**Ganj\u00e1m.**\u2014Suburb of SERINGAPATAM, in Mysore District, Mysore State. Lat. 12\u00b0 24\" N., long. 76\u00b0 47' E. It occupies the eastern or upper portion of the large island in the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, on which Seringapatam is built. It was established by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, who transported hither thousands of families from Sira. Now the most thriving part of the island, and the residence of several well-to-do merchants, with manufactures of cotton cloth. The Karigh\u00e1ta j\u00e1ttra or festival held in February or March is annually attended by 20,000 persons.\n\n**Gantang.**\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, over the range dividing Kun\u00e1war from Chinese territory. Lat. 31\u00b0 38' N., long. 78\u00b0 47' E. The highest part lies within the limit of perpetual snow. Scenery wild and rugged; the Rishi Gantang mountain rises over the pass to a height of 21,229 feet above sea-level, while the crest of the pass itself has an elevation of 18,295 feet. Fuel can be obtained with great difficulty, and the pass is consequently but little frequented.\n\n**Ganut\u00eda.**\u2014Town in B\u00edrbh\u00fam District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 52' 30\" N., long. 87\u00b0 52' 45\" E. Situated on the north bank of the river Mor, and\nfamous as the centre of the silk industry of B\u012brbh\u016bm. The Ganuti\u00e1 factory was established in 1786 by Mr. Frushard, a merchant, who engaged to supply the East India Company with silk at fixed rates. Mr. Frushard\u2019s story is typical of the \u2018private adventurers\u2019 of the last century. It is told at length in Hunter\u2019s *Annals of Rural Bengal*, p. 357 et seq., 5th edition. He met with much opposition from the District officials in his endeavours to become a producer of B\u012brbh\u016bm silk on a large scale. The natives charged him the highest prices for everything, and the Company allowed him the smallest. At length, in 1790, he was compelled to make a final appeal to the Government for relief; and in 1791, Lord Cornwallis commanded all his arrears of revenue to be remitted, and his rent to be reduced by about one-half. Thus relieved, Mr. Frushard began to prosper. He converted the forest and waste around Ganuti\u00e1 into thriving and prosperous villages, and founded little tributary factories throughout the whole north-eastern jungle of B\u012brbh\u016bm. His factory, rebuilt several times, now forms the most imposing edifice in the District, and is the property of an English firm in Calcutta. The single process of winding off the cocoons formerly employed 2400 artisans, and it has been calculated that the factory supported 15,000 persons; its average annual outlay was unofficially returned in 1868 at about \u00a372,000. At present (1883), owing to the decaying state of the silk industry, the Ganuti\u00e1 factory only employs about 530 persons.\n\n**Garag.**\u2014T\u0101luk or Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 699 square miles; contains 3 towns and 97 villages. Population (1881) 100,333, namely, 49,506 males and 50,827 females. Hindus number 88,853; Muhammadans, 10,314; \u2018others,\u2019 1166. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1nds), 2; regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chauktiddrs), 334.\n\n**Garag (Gadag).**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Garag, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency; 43 miles east of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town. Lat. 15\u00b0 24' 50' N., long. 75\u00b0 40' E. Population (1881) 17,001. Hindus number 13,460; Muhammadans, 3176; Christians, 331; and Jains, 34. Together with the neighbouring town of Betigeri, Garag forms a municipality, with a municipal revenue (1882\u201383) of \u00a31548; rate of taxation, 1s. 5\u00bdd. per head of the joint population (17,001) within municipal limits. Garag is a flourishing town, with considerable trade in raw cotton and cotton and silk fabrics, the cotton trade alone amounting to upwards of \u00a350,000 a year. There is a sub-judge\u2019s court, a telegraph and a post-office, together with the chief revenue and police offices of the Sub-division; a weekly market is held.\n\n**Gar\u00e1i (Gorai).**\u2014The name given to the upper reaches of the Madhumat\u00ed, the largest and most important river in Jessur District, Bengal. The Gar\u00e1i is one of the principal channels by which the\nwaters of the Ganges are carried to the sea; its chief tributary is the Kum\u00e1r, which was formerly itself the main stream, the Gar\u00e1i being then a feeder. Below Kushti\u00e1, the Gar\u00e1i throws off several cross streams towards the Kum\u00e1r, the most considerable being the K\u00e1ligang\u00e1. During the rains so much water flows through this channel into the Kum\u00e1r that at R\u00e1mnagar, near M\u00e1gura, the latter has to get rid of the surplus, and discharges part of its waters back again into the Gar\u00e1i channel. But in the cold season, when but little water comes down the Kum\u00e1r, this cross stream flows in the opposite direction, and brings down the waters of the Gar\u00e1i towards M\u00e1gura with the Nabagang\u00e1. The Gar\u00e1i flows in a southerly direction from Ganespur to Haripur, about 35 miles; it is 420 yards wide in the rains, and navigable by steamers all the year round.\n\n**Garamli Moti.**\u2014Petty State in South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Population (1881) 327. Estimated revenue, \u00a3200, of which \u00a319, 12s. is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and \u00a32, 8s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Garamli N\u00e1ni.**\u2014Petty State in South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Population (1881) 400.

Lat. 23\u00b0 40' N., long. 78\u00b0 9' E. Noted for some fine ancient buildings elaborately sculptured, and carved out of the sandstone of the neighbouring hills.\n\n**Garden Reach.**\u2014A suburb of Calcutta; situated on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, 3 miles south of the city. Lat. 22\u00b0 32' 35\" N., long. 88\u00b0 21' 40\" E. The Peninsula and Oriental Navigation Company and the Messageries Maritimes have large establishments here, where passengers for Europe by their mail steamers embark. The small forts of Aligarh, on the left or Garden Reach side of the river, and Tann\u00e1, on the opposite bank, were taken by Lord Clive in the recapture of Calcutta, December 1756. Branch dispensary. The suburb was long a favourite place of residence for the European inhabitants of Calcutta, and contains many fine houses, situated in large 'compounds.' These houses are said to have been built between 1768 and 1780. The residence of the ex-King of Oudh has been fixed here by the Government, and he occupies a series of magnificent mansions on the river bank, with menagerie and pleasure-grounds attached.\n\n**Garg\u00e1on.**\u2014Ruined town and fort in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam.\u2014See GARRGAON.\n\n**Gargariba.**\u2014Town in Maldah District, Bengal.\u2014See HAIATPUR.\n\n**Garh (Gad).**\u2014Petty State of the Sankhera Mehv\u00e1s, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north and east by\nChhota Udaipur, on the south by the Narbad\u00e1 river separating it from Kh\u00e1ndesh, and on the west by the estates of Palasni and Virpur. The estate includes 103 villages and is the largest in the Sankhera Mehv\u00e1s, having an area of 128 square miles, and an estimated revenue of about \u00a32000. Pays a tribute of \u00a347, 10s. to Chhota Udaipur. Population almost wholly Bhil. The chief, who is a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput, represents a younger branch of the Chhota Udaipur house.\n\nGarh\u00e1.\u2014Ancient town in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces; 90 miles south-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor). Lat. 23\u00b0 10' N., long. 79\u00b0 56' 30\" E. Population (1881) 5587, as returned by the Deputy Commissioner, but the town is not shown separately in the Census Report. The figures probably include neighbouring villages. Garh\u00e1 was formerly the capital of the Gond dynasty of Garh\u00e1 M\u00e1ndla, whose ruined keep, built about 1100 A.D., by Madan Singh, and known as the Madan Mahal, still crowns the low granite range, along the foot of which the town stretches for about 2 miles. Under the Mahal, to the west, is the beautiful Gang\u00e1 S\u00e1g\u00e1r tank, and near it the large sheet of water called the B\u00e1l S\u00e1g\u00e1r. Garh\u00e1 has an excellent Government school, with about 125 scholars. The trade is insignificant, its decline dating from the removal of the Gond dynasty to Singaurgarh. The Garh\u00e1 mint, which coined an inferior rupee called the B\u00e1l\u00e1 Sh\u00e1hi, formerly current throughout Bundelkhand, was in full operation when Mr. Daniel Leckie passed through the place in 1790.\n\nGarh\u00e1.\u2014Petty State of the G\u00fana (Goona) Sub-Agency, under the Gwalior Agency of Central India.\u2014See GHARRA.\n\nGarh\u00e1 Kal\u00e1n.\u2014Village in Banda District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 2000, consisting chiefly of Br\u00e1hmans and Cham\u00e1rs. Founded about 500 years ago, and burnt during the Mutiny by troops of the rebel N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o of Karw\u00e1, in revenge for the inability or unwillingness of the inhabitants to provide supplies.\n\nGarh\u00e1kota.\u2014The chief town of a tract of the same name in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Lat. 23\u00b0 47' N., long. 79\u00b0 11' 30\" E.; situated in an angle formed by the rivers Son\u00e1r and Gadha\u00edri, 27 miles east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r; about 1435 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 11,414, namely, Hindus, 7701; Sikh, 1; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 7; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 1293; Muhammadans, 1897; Jains, 474; Christians, 5; aboriginal religions, 36. Number of houses, 3473. It was probably founded by the Gonds, who held it until about 1629, when a R\u00e1jput chief from Bundelkhand, named Chandra S\u00e1h, expelled them, and built the fort. In 1703, Hirde S\u00e1h, son of the famous Chhatra S\u00e1l, the Bundela R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pann\u00e1, took the fort, giving the R\u00e1jput chief in lieu the single village of Naiguw\u00e1n, in Rehl\u00ed, still held at a quit-rent by a descendant of Chandra S\u00e1h. Hirde S\u00e1h built another town east of the fort, on the other side of the river, and called it after himself, Hirdenagar. Five years after his death,\nwhich happened in 1739, dissensions arose between Subh\u00e1 Singh and his younger brother Prithwi Singh. The latter invited the Peshw\u00e1 to his assistance, promising in return a fourth of the revenues, and by these means succeeded in constituting himself ruler of the town and tract of Garh\u00e1kota. In 1820, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur invested the fort. Mardan Singh, a descendant of Prithwi Singh, was killed in a skirmish, and his son, Arjun Singh, applied to Sindhia, offering to cede one-half of the territory in payment for his protection. Sindhia accordingly despatched an army under Colonel Jean Baptiste, who defeated the N\u00e1gpur troops, and retained M\u00e1loth and Garh\u00e1kota for Sindhia, leaving for Arjun Singh the country of Sh\u00e1gharh, with other territory. Baptiste remained for some time at Garh\u00e1kota, as governor of the fort. In 1819, however, Arjun Singh seized the fort by treachery, and held it for six months, when he was ejected by a British force under General Watson. From that time the English administered the country on behalf of Sindhia, till in 1861 an exchange was effected, and Garh\u00e1kota became British territory.\n\nGarh\u00e1kota really consists of two towns, divided by the river Son\u00e1r\u2014Garh\u00e1kota and Hirdenagar, in the latter of which all the trade of the place is carried on. The chief manufactures are red cloths called adhi and pathi, worn chiefly by women. Gur, or coarse sugar, is largely produced and exported; and grain, especially rice and wheat, sent both north and south. Besides the market held every Friday for the sale of grain, cattle, and native and English cloth, there is a large cattle fair, beginning on the 18th January, and lasting for six weeks, which is attended by about 30,000 persons from Gwalior, Bhop\u00e1l, Bundelkhand, and most Districts of the Central Provinces. In 1868-69, the imports of Garh\u00e1kota amounted to \u00a316,958, the exports to \u00a320,068. There is a District post-office, and schools for boys and girls. The fort is solidly constructed on a lofty eminence east of the town, between the rivers Son\u00e1r and Gadh\u00e1iri, with an artificial moat on its unprotected side. The inner walls enclose a space of 11 acres, mostly covered with buildings. These, however, are in ruins, as also are the outer walls and bastions, which were partly levelled by sappers, after Sir Hugh Rose captured the fort in 1858. About 2 miles north of the town, on the borders of the Garh\u00e1kota Ramna, stand the remains of a large summer palace built by Mardan Singh. The square tower is still in fair preservation. At the base, each side measures about 15 feet; and the tower rises to the height of 100 feet, in 6 storeys, each slightly tapering upwards. There is a winding stone staircase the whole way up. Near these ruins Sir Herbert Maddock, when Agent to the Governor-General at S\u00e1gar (Saugor), built a large flat-roofed house, which has lately been placed in charge of the Forest Department. Dispensary and police station.\nGarhakota Ramna.\u2014Teak forest in S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces.

Police station.\n\nGarhbori.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, containing 129 villages, with an area of 576 square miles. A hilly and thickly-wooded tract, intersected from north to south by four branches of the Andh\u00e1rfi river, and rendered picturesque by several magnificent tanks or lakes. The soil is chiefly red, and devoted to rice and sugar-cane. The population mostly consists of Kor\u00eds and M\u00e1n\u00e1s.\n\nGarhbori.\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; on a branch of the Andh\u00e1rfi river, 16 miles north-north-west of M\u00fal. Lat. 20\u00b0 18' N., long. 79\u00b0 38' 30\" E. Population (1881) 1269. Manufactures a s\u00e1ri (native female garment) of a peculiar pattern, and produces excellent p\u00e1n. The houses cluster round a fortified hill, with forests on all sides; and near the town are quarries of freestone and limestone. Garhbori has Government schools for boys and girls, and a police outpost.\n\nGarhchiroli.\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; on left bank of the Waingang\u00e1 river, 23 miles east-north-east of M\u00fal.

Brisk trade in cotton, cotton cloth, tas\u00e1r cocoons and thread, jungle produce, carts, and salt. Government schools for boys and girls, and police outpost.\n\nGarhdiw\u00e1la.\u2014Town in Hoshi\u00e1rpur tahsil, Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 44' 30\" N., long. 75\u00b0 47' 30\" E. Population (1881) 3438, namely, Hindus, 2037; Muhammadans, 1024; Sikhs, 337; and Jains, 40. Number of houses, 621. A third-class municipality.

Average attendance, 20,000 persons.\n\nGarhgaon (spelt in Assamese, Gargdon).\u2014Ruined town and fort in Sibs\u00e1gar District, Assam. The earliest seat of government of the Aham princes, and the capital of their kingdom till the prosperity of the dynasty began to wane, when it was transferred to Rangpur in the same\nDistrict about 1698. The fort and palace of Garhgaon are situated on the banks of the Dikhu river, to the south-east of Sibs\u00e1gar town. The fort had bastions at the corners, but they are now destroyed. The magazine was situated a short distance east of the fort. The royal palace, one of the oldest buildings in the Province, is described by Robinson, in his *Descriptive Account of Assam*, as having been 'surrounded by a brick wall about 2 miles in circumference;' but the whole town and its suburbs appear to have extended over many square miles of country. The ruins of gateways, built chiefly of masonry, are still to be seen within the fortified circumvallations which surrounded the town. It may be observed that one of the gateways is composed principally of large blocks of stone bearing marks of iron crampings, which show that they once belonged to far more ancient edifices. From this evidence alone, were there no other, it might safely be presumed that, long antecedent to the conquest of the Ahams, the country had been inhabited by a race far advanced in some of the arts of civilised life.' This ancient building has fallen into complete ruin, though not altogether by the hand of time; for the fort and site were purchased from Government many years ago, on a thirty years' lease, by the Assam Company, for the sake of the bricks, which have been removed for the purpose of erecting fresh buildings on the Company's tea estates.\n\n**Garhi** (also known as *Bhaisa Khert*).\u2014Guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate of Dh\u00e1r State, under the Deputy Bhfl (Bheel) Agency of Central India.

The administrative head-quarters are at Pauri, but Srinagar is the chief town of the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Garhw\u0101l consists for the most part of rugged mountain ranges, the central peaks or outliers of the main Him\u0101layan chain, tossed about in the most intricate confusion, and severed by narrow valleys, which may rather be described as gorges\nor ravines. The broadest among them, that of Srinagar, measures barely half a mile in width, and has an elevation of 1820 feet above sea-level. A narrow strip of bh\u00e1bar, or waterless forest, some 2 or 3 miles in breadth, intervening between the southern bases of the hills and the alluvial lowlands of Rohilkhand, forms the only level portion of the District. To the north, the mountains belong to the central upheaval line of the Him\u00e1layas, the principal peaks within the boundaries of Garhw\u00e1l being\u2014Tris\u00fal, 23,382 feet; Nand\u00e1 Devi, 25,661 feet; D\u00fanagiri, 23,181 feet; Kamet, 25,413 feet; Badrin\u00e1th, 22,901 feet; and Ked\u00e1rnat, 22,853 feet. North-westward from this massive chain, the mountains fall away to the elevated plateau of Tibet, scored by the valleys of the Saraswat\u00ed and the Dhauli, through which the MANA and NITI PASSES respectively lead across the frontier into Chinese territory. Southward from the main range, again, parallel spurs run towards the plain in a direction from north-east to south-west, while cross systems of irregular hills connect their lines from time to time, interspersed with occasional ridges of greater elevation, which reach a height of from 10,000 to 12,000 feet. South of the river Ny\u00e1r, however, the ranges assume a direction more parallel to the plains, and nowhere exceed an elevation of 7500 feet. Along the larger rivers, the hills present a gradual slope at their bases, and end in a succession of dry terraces, which are generally cultivated by artificial irrigation. Above, a belt of forest clothes their flanks; while the actual summits rise high into the region of perpetual snow. The ALAKNANDA RIVER, one of the main sources of the Ganges, marks the central line of greatest depression, and with its affluents receives the whole drainage of the District. The Alaknanda forms one of the holiest amongst Indian objects of reverence, and each of the points where it meets a considerable confluent is regarded as a sacred station in the pilgrimage which devout Hindus perform to Him\u00e1chal. At Deopray\u00e1g, a place of special sanctity, it joins the BHAGIRATHI, and the united streams thenceforward assume the name of GANGES. The only important river in Garhw\u00e1l that does not fall into the Ganges within the borders of the District is the R\u00e1m-gang\u00e1, which rises near Lobha, and, flowing through Kum\u00e1un and the plains of Rohilkhand, finally debouches into the great stream in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Navigation is impracticable on all the rivers, owing to their great velocity, and the existence of shoals or rapids; but several of them afford a waterway for rafting timber. The southern portion of the District is still covered with primeval forest, and tiger-haunted jungles abound in the central tract; but cultivation encroaches year by year on the wild lands, and the people are encouraged to settle and reclaim the soil by grants at a nominal rent.\n\nHistory.\u2014In the almost total absence of written records, the annals of Garhw\u00e1l have to be constructed partly from local tradition and partly\nfrom inference. About five hundred years ago, the valley of the Alaknand\u00e1 was divided into 52 petty chieftainships, each chief having his own independent fortress (garh), from which the country is said to have derived its name. Between four and five centuries ago, Ajai P\u00e1l, ruler of Ch\u00e1ndpur, reduced all these minor principalities under his own sway, and became the founder of the Garhw\u00e1l kingdom. He placed his capital at Srinagar, where he built a palace, the ruins of which still remain in tolerable preservation. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of his line, known as the Ch\u00e1nd Dynasty, ruled over Garhw\u00e1l and the adjacent Tehri State until their expulsion by the Gurkh\u00e1s in 1803. The succession appears to have been strictly hereditary. One of the line, Pr\u00eddhiman S\u00e1h, was chosen ruler of Kum\u00e1un; but on his father's death, he preferred the certain tenure of his ancestral dominions to the precarious throne of the neighbouring State, which lay at the mercy of the party from time to time in power at Almora. The Ch\u00e1nd R\u00e1j\u00e1s seem generally to have ruled with justice and moderation, and their country attained a considerable degree of prosperity for a mountain principality. Twice they successfully repelled an invasion of the Rohill\u00e1s\u2014on one occasion when the freebooters attacked them through Kum\u00e1un, and again when they attempted to enter the hill country through Dehra D\u00fan. But a constant predatory warfare existed between Garhw\u00e1l and Kum\u00e1un, each party making forays into the territory of their rivals whenever opportunity offered, and plundering all that came in their way. To the present day, a slumbering animosity between the inhabitants of the two Districts is only kept in check by the British authority.\n\nIn 1803, the Gurkh\u00e1s, then the dominant race in Nep\u00e1l, made their way westward, conquering everything before them, and drove Pr\u00eddhiman S\u00e1h, the Ch\u00e1nd R\u00e1j\u00e1, into the plains. For twelve years they ruled with a rod of iron over the whole of Garhw\u00e1l and Dehra D\u00fan, and impoverished the country by their tyranny. They divided the District into a number of petty military fiefs, in which each commandant exacted as much as he was able in addition to the demand of the central power. The villages were left waste; the inhabitants fled into the most impenetrable jungles; and to this day the name of Gurkh\u00e1 forms a popular synonym for all that is cruel and tyrannical. Years of our rule have hardly sufficed to obliterate the effects of this terrible invasion, which threw back the progress of the country for at least a quarter of a century. The Gurkh\u00e1s then commenced a series of petty encroachments on the British territories at the foot of the Him\u00e1layas, which were not resisted with any vigour until the attention of our Government was attracted in 1812 by their outrageous aggressions on the Gorakhpur and Tirh\u00fat frontier. After an unsuccessful attempt at conciliation, war broke out in November 1814. The events of the\ncampaign, which resulted in our capture of Almora and the reduction of the two Districts, belong rather to the history of Kumaun. At the close of the war, the Tehri principality, known as Independent Garhwal, was restored to Sendurshan Sah, whose grandson, Pratap Sah, still retains it; but the valley of the Alaknanda was erected into a British District, and organized on the usual model. Under our strong and peaceful administration, British Garhw\u00e1l has risen from a state of desolation scarcely paralleled elsewhere in India, to a height of material prosperity which it never before enjoyed. Cultivation has rapidly increased; and the growth of tea culture has opened the District to British capital and enterprise, which are turning this once wretched tract into an important and wealthy region.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 was taken over an area approximately estimated at 5500 square miles; it disclosed a total population of 310,288 persons, distributed among 3944 villages or townships, and inhabiting 57,293 houses. The last Census in 1881 returned the population at 345,629, showing an increase of 35,341, or 11.4 per cent. during the nine years. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Estimated area of District, 5500 square miles; members of villages, 3862; houses, 47,736. Total population, 345,629, namely, males 170,755, and females 174,874; proportion of males, 49.4 per cent. Average density of population, 62.8 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0.70; persons per village, 89.5; houses per square mile, 8.6; persons per occupied house, 7.2. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Garhw\u00e1l is almost exclusively a Hindu District, as many as 343,186 persons, or 99.4 per cent., being returned as adherents of the ancient creed; while the Muhammadans number only 2077, or 0.6 per cent. The Musalm\u00e1ns live in such scattered localities that they possess little or no social influence. Jains number 69, and Buddhists 55. There is a mission at Chapra, near Pauri, and 242 persons were returned in 1881 as being Christians. Of Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans number 77,960; R\u00e1jputs, the great bulk of the population, 204,519; Baniy\u00e1s or traders, 3657; Gos\u00e1ins, 2620; and Doms, 52,060. The great Hindu temples of Badrinath and Kedarnath attract large numbers of pilgrims, and have produced a deep influence on the history and manners of the people. They lie among the inmost recesses of the snowy range. The sanctity of these shrines has contributed to render the inhabitants superstitious and bigoted; but the yearly influx of pilgrims adds greatly to the wealth of the District.\n\nThree principal races inhabit the southern slopes of Garhw\u00e1l. The Dh\u00fams (who are not returned separately in the Census Report) appear to be the descendants of aboriginal tribes, and now form the menial class throughout the District. They differ totally in\nfeatures, habits, and religion from the other castes by whom they have been brought into subjection. The Khasiy\u00e1s evidently came from the plains of Hindust\u00e1n, but they preserve no memory of their immigration. They comprise many castes of Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, etc., all of which, however, are regarded by the orthodox Hindus as S\u00fadras. They reside principally in the central and northern parg\u00e1ns, and resemble the Gurkh\u00e1s in appearance, from which fact it may perhaps be inferred that they are not free from a Nep\u00e1lese admixture. The third class includes the true Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs, most of whom arrived in the country after the establishment of a settled government. Some of the Br\u00e1hmans trace back their immigration to the times of Kanak P\u00e1l, who first settled in Ch\u00e1ndpur and built a fort, the ruins of which are still in existence. A totally distinct race inhabits the region lying within the snowy range. These are the Bhuti\u00e1s, a tribe of Indo-Chinese origin, much intermixed with Hindu elements. They talk the H\u00fania or Tibetan language, as well as Hindi, and have besides a patois of their own. They are few in number, but they control the whole carrying trade with Tibet. Both men and women are powerfully built, dirty in their habits, and greatly addicted to drink. Among the social customs of Garhw\u00e1l generally, must be noticed the universal prevalence of polygamy. Wives are looked upon in the light of beasts of burden, so that every man obtains as many as his means will afford. Desertion and suicide are common, in spite of all the efforts of the British officials in ameliorating the condition of women. The District contained no place in 1881 with a population exceeding 5000 persons. Paur\u00ed, the head-quarters station, can hardly claim any higher rank than that of a hill village; and Srinagar, in the valley at its foot, is the only place which reaches the dignity of a town. Of a total of 3862 villages in 1881, 3582 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 270 had from two to five hundred; and only 9 from five hundred to a thousand.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of an estimated area of 5500 square miles, only 173 were returned in 1881 as under cultivation. Nevertheless, this amount is nearly treble of the tilled land in 1815. Agriculture is carried on with considerable skill and great industry. Taking into account the steep nature of the country, it must be allowed that the people deserve great credit for the manner in which they have divided it into terraces, some of the fields having a breadth of only 3 yards. Wheat, rice, and mandu\u00e1 form the staple crops; and the quantities grown not only suffice for local wants, but leave a surplus for exportation to the neighbouring District of Bijnaur (Bijnor) and to Tibet. The chief food of the lower classes is mandu\u00e1, which yields a larger return than any other crop. Cotton is little cultivated, as it can be purchased elsewhere at a cheaper rate than that for which it could be\nproduced in the District. The people have grown richer of late years, and are enabled to keep more cattle than formerly, and consequently to employ more manure for their fields. Abundant pasture lands stretch along the upper slopes of the snowy range, affording excellent grazing for large herds of goats and sheep during the rains. Unlimited pasturage also exists in the valleys and in the bh\u0101dbar at the foot of the hills, but this has been preserved by the Forest Department, which levies dues on all animals permitted to enter its boundaries. Cattle in numbers come for grazing from the western pargands of Kumaun, where no pasturage is found. The cultivators chiefly consist of petty proprietors, and the peasantry as a whole are well-to-do and free from debt. Rents are generally paid in cash, except by tenants-at-will, who pay in kind at the rate of from one-fourth to one-third of the crop. Irrigation is practised wherever water can be obtained; and two small canals in the bh\u0101dbar supply an area of 1300 acres. The regular rotation of crops consists of rice, followed by wheat, and then by mandu\u00e1; after which the land lies fallow till the next rice season. Tea-planting is carried on under European supervision to a considerable extent. The planters give occupation to about 400 permanent and 600 short-service labourers, the latter being employed during the tea-picking season. Wages have more than doubled during the last thirty years. In 1850, ordinary coolies obtained 4\u00bdd. per diem; they now receive 3d. per diem. Smiths, braziers, and carpenters used to get from 3d. to 4\u00bdd.; they are now paid from 4\u00bdd. to 9d. Agricultural day-labourers are unknown in Garhw\u00e1l. The ordinary price of mandu\u00e1 varies from 30 to 40 sers per rupee, or from 3s. 9d. to 2s. 10d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Floods occasionally occur on the Alaknand\u00e1, one of which, before the Gurkh\u00e1 conquest, swept away half the town of Sr\u012bnagar. In 1868, again, an inundation of the same river inflicted considerable damage. Droughts also affect the District from time to time; but owing to the high ranges of hills on every side, they are never general, though they may extend over so wide a tract as to make their effects felt throughout the whole country. The last great scarcity from this cause took place in 1867, when the r\u0101b\u012b crops in all the lower and more fertile portion of Garhw\u00e1l almost entirely failed. Government made an advance of \u00a31000, and grain purchased in the bh\u0101dbar was carried up by the people themselves for sale at certain established centres. Money was plentiful in the District at the time, so that most purchasers paid in cash, only a few giving labour in exchange for food. The kharif crops of the same year proved excellent in their yield, and entirely relieved the temporary distress. Garhw\u00e1l suffered but little from the terrible famine of 1868\u201370, and probably gained in the end, as measures were taken to prevent the export of grain or the ingress of pilgrims; and the crop of 1869 turning out a good one, the\npeople sold large quantities of grain after the removal of the embargo, at very high rates, to the inhabitants of Bijnaur. This famine also acted as an incentive to increased cultivation. The District suffered severely in 1877-78, when about \u00a31200 worth of grain was advanced to the people to carry them over the scarcity. Want of carriage forms the great difficulty in relieving distress among the Garhw\u00e1l hills, since supplies can only be drawn from the bh\u00e1bar, or the adjacent plain Districts; and to reach these places a very malarious jungle must be traversed. Sir H. Ramsay has done much to avert the recurrence of dearth by his settlements in the bh\u00e1bar of Kum\u00e1un, but the similar tract in Garhw\u00e1l does not possess like capacities for cultivation. Famine rates are reached when wheat sells at 8 sers per rupee, or 14s. per cwt., and mandu\u00e1 at 10 sers per rupee, or 11s. 2d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The Bhuti\u00e1s carry on a considerable traffic with Tibet, to which country they export grain, sugar, cloth, and tobacco; while salt, borax, wool, gold, and precious stones form the chief staples of the return trade. Sheep and goats imported from Chamba are employed as beasts of burden on these routes, which lie over the lofty crests of the M\u00e1na and N\u00edti Passes. Bird-skins and the pods of musk-deer formerly ranked as main items in the exports southward; but owing to the reckless way in which the animals were destroyed, measures have been taken to preserve them, which cause a temporary interference with the trade. Several valuable minerals are found in Garhw\u00e1l, including copper, iron, lead, silver, and gold; none, however, occur in paying quantities or positions. Coin accumulates from year to year, mainly through the influx of pilgrims to the great temples. Tea-planting has not hitherto proved remunerative, but its financial prospects are improving, as the planters gradually learn to economize labour and to reduce expenditure. No railway station exists nearer than Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, distant from Pauri about 100 miles. Good hill roads, from 10 to 12 feet in width, intersect the District in every direction. Most of them are bridged throughout. The total length of roads amounts to about 1000 miles. The chief routes, in a commercial point of view, are those\u2014(1) from Sr\u00ednagar to N\u00edti, 125 miles, which serves the Tibet trade; (2) from Sr\u00ednagar to Kotdw\u00e1ra, 55 miles, which serves the traffic to the plains; (3) from Kain\u00far to the great trading mart at R\u00e1m\u00f1agar, which carries the hill produce; and (4) from Pauri to Almora, connecting the two head-quarters stations.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a senior-Assistant Commissioner, who resides at Pauri, and possesses criminal and revenue jurisdiction. The office is now held by a military officer in civil employ, assisted by an extra-Assistant Commissioner and a tahsild\u00e1r, both of\nwhom are stationed at Pauri. The Civil Judge, who exercises revenue and criminal powers, also resides at Pauri, which is the head-quarters as well of the native civil judge. In 1822 the total land revenue amounted to \u00a35851; by 1875 it had risen to \u00a39555; and by 1882 to \u00a312,167. There is no regular police except at headquarters, and little crime of any kind. Long-term prisoners are sent to the jail at Almora, and the only place of confinement in Garhw\u00e1l is a lock-up at Pauri. Education has made much greater progress among these mountain valleys than in the plain country at their feet. The total number of Government inspected schools in the District in the year 1883 amounted to 67; and the total number of pupils on the rolls to 3314. These figures show an average of 1 school to every 82 square miles of area, and 9 scholars per thousand of the population. This, however, is exclusive of uninspected schools, for the Census Report of 1881 returns 3744 boys and 177 girls as under instruction, besides 12,278 males and 135 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. For administrative purposes, the District is divided into 11 pargangs and 86 pattis. The number of registered proprietors at the last settlement amounted to 31,118. There are no municipalities in Garhw\u00e1l.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014For six months in the year the climate of Garhw\u00e1l is damp and rainy; but during the remaining half of each twelvemonth it is dry and bracing. The natural features of the country, however, introduce many minor modifications in various portions of the District. Towards the Niti and M\u00e1na Passes, in the Bhuti\u00e1 country, periodical rains do not occur, and the climate is always cool. In the valleys, intense heat prevails during the summer months, while the nights and mornings in the cold season are bitterly cold. The average annual rainfall at Pauri is about 48\u00b74 inches, and at Sr\u00ednagar about 37\u00b71 inches. Fevers and bowel complaints form the chief endemic diseases, but cholera prevails to a much greater extent than in the plains. The total number of deaths recorded in 1881 was 6910, or 20 per thousand of the population. Small-pox formerly ravaged the District, but owing to the vaccination arrangements lately made, this annual plague has ceased to recur with its former regularity. There are 7 charitable dispensaries\u2014at Sr\u00ednagar, Karnpray\u00e1g, Ukhimath, Chimauli, Joshim\u00e1th, Ganai, and Bikhia-kasain. During the year 1882 they gave relief to 18,861 patients. [For further information regarding Garhw\u00e1l, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vols. x. and xi., by E. T. Atkinson, Esq., C.S. (Government Press, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1882 and 1884). Also the Census Report for the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in 1881; together with the Provincial Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nGarhw\u00e1l (or Tehri).\u2014A Native State in political relationship with\nthe Government of the North-Western Provinces; lying between lat. 30\u00b0 2' and 31\u00b0 20' N., and between long. 71\u00b0 54' and 79\u00b0 19' E. It extends over the south-western declivity of the Himalayas, and consists throughout of a vast range of mountains of enormous height, intermingled with several valleys, the drainage of the whole ultimately finding its way to the Ganges. The chief town is Tehri, by which appellation the State is sometimes mentioned. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garhw\u00e1l, Prat\u00e1p S\u00e1h, is a Kshatriy\u00e1 of the Lunar race. The early history of the dynasty is obscure; but it appears that they exercised authority over the whole of Garhw\u00e1l for many generations, paying, however, a small tribute to the Emperor of Delhi. In 1804, the Gurkh\u00e1s overran the country and expelled the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but he was replaced by the British after the Nep\u00e1l war of 1815, and that portion of his hereditary possessions which lay to the west of the Alaknand\u00e1 river was restored to him; the lands to the east, the Dehra D\u00fan and the District of Garhw\u00e1l, being retained by the British Government. (See Garhw\u00e1l District.) During the Mutiny of 1857, the R\u00e1j\u00e1, Sudar Shan S\u00e1h, rendered valuable assistance to Government. He died in 1859 without legitimate issue, and, in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the State lapsed to Government; but, in consideration of the services of Sudar Shan S\u00e1h, his eldest illegitimate son, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Singh, was allowed to succeed. Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Singh subsequently received a sanad giving him the right of adoption. He was succeeded in 1871 by his eldest son, Prat\u00e1p S\u00e1h, the present ruler, who was born about 1850. The State pays no tribute. The area of Garhw\u00e1l is about 4180 miles; the population in 1881 was returned at 199,836 persons, inhabiting 2249 villages and 22,728 houses. Hindus numbered 198,738; Muhammadans, 1089; and Christians, 9. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's estimated revenue is \u00a38000 per annum. The hills are generally very steep, and a large portion of the territory is covered with forests, which include valuable deodar tracts. These were leased to the British Government in 1864.\n\nGarnimetta (Gurnimetta).\u2014Town in V\u00e1yalp\u00e1d taluk, Kadapa (Cuddapah) District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 13\u00b0 48' N., longitude 78\u00b0 56' E. Population (1881) 3934, namely, 3808 Hindus and 126 Muhammadans; houses, 929.\n\nG\u00e1ro Hills.\u2014The District of the G\u00e1ro Hills forms the south-western corner of the Province of Assam. It lies between 25\u00b0 9' and 26\u00b0 0' N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 52' and 91\u00b0 3' E. long. Bounded on the north by Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District; on the east by the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills; on the south and west by the Bengal Districts of Maimansingh and Rangpur. According to the recent survey, it contains an area of 3146 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 109,548 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the station of Tura, on the mountain range of the same name.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The entire District, as implied by its name, is a mountainous tract, forming the western end of the great chain which runs between the Surma and Brahmaputra valleys. On the north, near the Brahmaputra river, the hills are low, and covered only with grass or scrub jungle; but they gradually increase in height towards the interior of the District. The two principal ranges are known as the Tur\u00e1 and Arbel\u00e1 Hills, which run parallel to one another east and west. Their greatest height is 4650 feet, which is attained by two peaks in the Tur\u00e1 range. As is the case with all the mountains on the northeast frontier of India, these ranges take the form of a series of long even ridges, with deep valleys between, occasionally diversified by peaks or towering masses of rock. Except on the rare spots where j\u00fam cultivation has been introduced, they are clothed with dense forest, containing timber trees of majestic dimensions. From the summit of Tur\u00e1 Hill a magnificent view can be obtained over the flat Districts of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, Rangpur, and Maimansingh, and the sweeping course of the Brahmaputra can be traced for a distance of upwards of 100 miles. On a clear day in the months of October and November, the eye can discern the snowy peaks of the Him\u00e1layas, far beyond the distant station of D\u00e1rjiling. In the valleys, also, the scenery is of a very picturesque character. The hill streams break through rocky gorges, which are overgrown to the water's edge with forest trees, creepers of many varieties, and gigantic ferns.\n\nThe Brahmaputra, called the Songdi by the G\u00e1ros, nowhere touches the boundary of the District; but several tributaries of that river take their rise among the hills, and find their way into the Districts of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and Maimansingh. Of these, the five most important are the Krishnai, Kalu, Bhogal, Nitai, and Someswari, all of which are used for floating down timber rafts, and can be navigated by canoes during the cold season. The Tur\u00e1 range constitutes the watershed of the District, all the streams north of that line draining into Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, while those to the south flow into Maimansingh. The streams abound in fish, which the G\u00e1ros are expert in catching by several ingenious devices.\n\nThe extensive forests of the District are too remote from means of communication to yield much profit at present. The valuable s\u00e1l tree is very abundant, and the t\u00fan, kurd\u00ed, and aj\u00e1r are also felled for timber. In recent years, the British authorities have adopted the policy of taking into their own hands the entire management of the forests, after compensating the zamind\u00e1rs and the hillmen for the rights which they formerly enjoyed. It is proposed to plant nurseries of s\u00e1l in spots convenient for water carriage, and carefully reserve them from the fires of j\u00fam cultivation. At present the woodcutters take out licences to fell timber within certain limits. In the year 1881-82, the revenue derived\nfrom this source amounted to \u00a3907, but the collections are very fluctuating.\" The jungle products are\u2014lac, beeswax, various fibres, used for making string and cloth, and a few dyes. Wild animals and large game abound, including elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, wild dogs, buffaloes, mithun or wild cows, and many kinds of deer. Government has recently asserted its prerogative to the sole right of capturing wild elephants. It has been estimated that the District can annually supply nearly 200 of these valuable animals for several years to come, which alone would more than repay all the local expenses of administration.\n\nThe mineral products known to exist are\u2014coal of fair quality and under a large area, building stone, and lime. No metals have hitherto been discovered.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Garo Hills were first constituted a separate administration in the year 1866. Previous to that date, the independence of the tribes living in the remote hills had been tacitly recognised. From the time when the British obtained possession of the diwani of Bengal in the last century, numerous Garo villages along the foot of the hills were included within the Districts of Goalpara and Maimansingh. The frontier, however, was always very ill-defined, being fixed neither by geographical nor ethnical principles. The boundaries were finally settled by the survey executed between 1870 and 1875. Towards the east a line has been drawn along rivers and other natural boundaries, to demarcate the Garo from the Khasi Hills. On the north and west, some tracts previously included within Goalpara District have been definitely attached to the Garo Hills; and the dues and cesses formerly levied by the lowland zamindars are now collected on their account by the direct agency of Government. On the south side, towards Maimansingh, a similar principle has been adopted; and a long-standing dispute has been terminated, which dated back to the Permanent Settlement. The Raj\u00e1 of Susang and other Maimansingh zamindars had persistently asserted their claim to a large portion of the hills, as having been originally included within their permanently-settled estates; and they urged, accordingly, that such portion of the hills lay within the jurisdiction of the Collector of Maimansingh. These claims, however, were never admitted by the Government. In 1866 the boundary was roughly drawn at its present line, and the Maimansingh landholders' claims were finally satisfied by money payments, and the land attached to the Garo Hills.\n\nBut though a British officer was appointed to the Garo Hills in 1866, the mountainous interior still remained a terra incognita, and its inhabitants continued to be known as the Independent Garos. In December 1867, the Deputy Commissioner took up his quarters at Tur\u00e1, and by the end of 1871 nearly 100 villages had tendered their submission. In that year, however, there occurred the unfortunate incident which led\nto the armed expedition of 1872-73. After the conclusion of the survey of the adjoining Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, the survey party was deputed to explore the country of the Independent G\u00e1ros. At first no active opposition was encountered, though it was found that the hillmen gradually ceased to offer ready assistance. Their suspicions evidently were aroused. In March 1871, two Bengali coolies of the survey party, who had been detached to procure labour from the secluded villages of Rangm\u00e1giri and Phar\u00e1mgiri, were treacherously attacked, and one of them was murdered. This outrage was followed by several raids on the part of the Independent G\u00e1ros against their countrymen who lived under British protection. The Deputy Commissioner immediately occupied the rebellious villages with bodies of police, but he was not strong enough to pursue the inhabitants into their retreat amid the forests. Accordingly it was determined to take advantage of the cold season of 1872-73, in order to enforce the authority of the British Government throughout the whole country, and to receive the submission of about 60 villages that still held out. The expedition consisted of three strong detachments of police, operating from separate points, and three companies of the 43rd Assam Light Infantry. The military, however, were never required to advance farther than the frontier of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills. After one engagement, in which the G\u00e1ros suffered some loss, the three police parties effected their junction, having marched through the country in all directions. Every one of the independent villages now tendered their submission. They surrendered the heads of the persons killed by them in their several raids, and paid the fine that was inflicted on them. At the same time, permanent measures were adopted for maintaining order in the future. Every part of the lately independent country was thoroughly examined, the number and size of the villages noted, and arrangements made for the appointment of lashkars or heads of circles. Every village was compelled to contribute to the revenue, according to an assessment levied on each house. By the end of May 1873, a map of the entire G\u00e1ro Hills District had been prepared, on the scale of four miles to the inch; and the wild interior was thus robbed of its chief protection, which our ignorance had conferred upon it. The results of this expedition have been most beneficial, and the civil administration has since been conducted with little or no trouble.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No attempt at a regular enumeration of the inhabitants has ever been effected in the G\u00e1ro Hills. The Deputy Commissioner in 1870 estimated the population at from 80,000 to 100,000. The Census of 1881 was only carried out in certain tracts, and careful estimates made from them for the remainder. The Census Report returns the total population at 109,548, of whom 23,914 reside in the plains, and 85,634 in the hills. In the hills proper, the only race to\nbe found is the G\u00e1ro itself, with the exception of one small isolated village called Th\u00e1p\u00e1, which is inhabited by R\u00e1bh\u00e1s. But several villages on the plains, which have recently been included within the boundaries of the District, are peopled by R\u00e1bh\u00e1s, Kochs, R\u00e1jbans\u00eds, D\u00e1lus, Mechs, and a few Musalm\u00e1ns. All these tribes possess ethnical features in common with the G\u00e1ros, but the latter retain sufficient national characteristics to be classed as a people by themselves. They are thought to represent the primitive stock, of which the R\u00e1bh\u00e1, Mech, and Koch represent offshoots that have been modified by life on the plains and contact with Hinduism. According to local tradition, the G\u00e1ro Hills were once occupied by Kochs, who were gradually driven northward by an invasion of G\u00e1ros; and it is a fact that the Kochs at the present day claim land in the hills.\n\nThe G\u00e1ros proper are a robust and active race, capable of enduring a great amount of exertion. They are of about the middle height, and of a dark-brown swarthy colour. Neither the men nor women have any pretensions to good looks. Their cheekbones are prominent, noses broad, lips thick, ears large, and eyes of a hazel colour. The men are remarkable for deficiency of beard, whatever hair grows on the face being carefully plucked out. The hair of the head with both sexes is never cut, but either tied up in a knot or kept off the face by means of a piece of cloth. The dress of the men consists merely of a strip of home-spun cotton cloth, about a yard and a half in length, which is passed round the waist and between the legs, and then tied at the back. The dress of the women only differs in being slightly more extensive. In addition, both sexes carry a small blanket, usually made from the bark of a tree. This is manufactured by steeping the bark in water, beating it out, and afterwards drying it well in the sun. In the eastern hills, the G\u00e1ros have adopted the short fringed jacket, which is characteristic of the Kh\u00e1s\u00edas. Both men and women are inordinately fond of personal ornaments. The males wear three or four brass earrings, and as many bead necklaces as they can afford. Men of hereditary rank wear an iron or brass armlet above the elbow, and a peculiar ornament round the head, which consists of brass plates connected by a string. It is said that this last may only be assumed by one who has slain an enemy in battle. The women wear, besides necklaces of glass and bell-metal beads, ear-rings of enormous size and weight. It is a coveted mark of distinction to have the lobe of the ear altogether torn away by the strain thus caused, in which case the ear-rings are suspended from a string passed over the top of the head. The weapons of the G\u00e1ros consist of spear, sword, and shield. The sword, which is peculiar to these hills, is a two-edged instrument with an abrupt point, the blade and handle forming one piece. Besides being a weapon, it is used for every variety of domestic and agricultural purpose. The shield is com-\nposed of thin strips of bamboo ingeniously worked together, so as to be almost proof against a spear-thrust. In the back of the shield is a receptacle for bamboo spikes, which form an essential item in the equipment of a Garo warrior. These spikes are intended to be planted in the ground, so as to block the way against a shoeless enemy; and they have been found to answer their purpose very effectually. In food, the Garos may be styled omnivorous; they eat not only beef and pork, but also tigers, dogs, snakes, and frogs. Their staple diet is rice, and their drink rice beer. Milk they altogether eschew, as do all the aboriginal races inhabiting the hills between the Surma and Brahmaputra. They are great smokers of tobacco, but touch no intoxicating drug. Their villages are usually placed on the side of a hill, some distance from the crest, and within easy reach of water. The houses, as is the case among many other tribes of the north-east frontier, are built on piles, and are frequently of considerable size. The materials are bamboo and thatch. The structure is usually divided into the following compartments:\u2014A large room where the family live, an apartment for the women, a place where the cattle are kept, and verandahs in front and behind. A rude fireplace, consisting merely of smoothed clay, occupies the middle of the house; and the smoke is left to escape as best it can. During the agricultural season, the entire body of villagers occupy temporary huts in the immediate neighbourhood of the common cultivation.\n\nThe most remarkable domestic custom of the Garos is one which they share with the Khasias. The wife is regarded as the head of the family, and through her the descent of property is traced. This custom is apparently a survival of the system of polyandry. That system still exists intact among Himalayan tribes; for example, among the tribes between Simla and Tibet. It is also practised among the Nairs and the aboriginal Todas of Southern India. According to this system when in full force, a woman is the lawful wife of a family of brethren, and a man's property descends, not to his own, but to his sister's children. Among tribes who have advanced so far as to give up the practice of polyandry, but who still preserve its traditions, it leaves behind curious customs of inheritance, such as that just described among the Garos and Khasias. Property still descends through the females, and the sons receive nothing, but have to look to the family into which they marry for their advancement in life. As among the Khasias, the women enjoy a position of the highest consideration in all domestic matters, and it is said that their voice has great weight also in public councils. Marriages are arranged by the parents, and concluded when the parties are of fit age. No dower is demanded on either side. The husband immediately migrates to the house of his wife's family, and becomes one of her clan. Intermarriages between\nmembers of the same clan are not permitted, but otherwise no regard is paid to the ties of consanguinity. A second wife cannot be taken without the consent of the first. Adultery is punished by a fine.\n\nThe funeral ceremonies of the G\u00e1ros imply the belief in a future state. The body is burned, and the ashes finally buried near the hut-door. At the time of cremation, dogs are sacrificed, in order that they may direct the spirit on his way. Up to a very recent period, human victims were offered on the occasion of the death of a chief. If no slaves were available, a foray was made into the plains to bring back heads. The G\u00e1ros believe in a supreme being called Saljang, who is impersonated in the sun. But the real objects of their religion are numerous malignant demons, to whom is attributed every physical and moral evil, and whose wrath requires to be appeased by bloody sacrifices. It is the duty of the priest or kam\u00e1l to determine by certain omens which particular evil spirit is at work, to arrange the ceremonies, and repeat the necessary incantations. Like the aborigines of Central India, the G\u00e1ros are excessively superstitious, and believe in the existence of witches and imps of all kinds. They have a curious idea that certain persons are capable of leaving their human frames, and taking up their abode in the body of a tiger or other animal.\n\nThe G\u00e1ro villages vary greatly in size. Some may have as many as 2000, others no more than 30 inhabitants. Tura Station, with only 744 inhabitants, is the only place possessing any special characteristics. It is situated on a spur of the Tur\u00e1 range, about 2000 feet above sea-level, and the same distance from the summit. It contains houses for the Deputy Commissioner, Police and Medical Officers, barracks and huts for 200 constables, and the school-house of the American Mission. The stockade by which it was originally protected, and a small outpost station, have now been suffered to fall into decay. Water is plentiful in the immediate neighbourhood, and an aqueduct has recently been cut, running right through the station.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The G\u00e1ros cultivate their land on the system known as jum. A spot of land is selected on the hill-side, and the jungle cut down during the cold season. Towards the end of March, the trees and brushwood are burned as they lie; and the rice crop is planted in April, at the commencement of the rains. Shortly afterwards, the seeds of vegetables, cotton, pepper, and pulses are sown in the same clearing; and each crop is reaped in rotation, as it comes to maturity. In the second year, rice only is grown; and after two years' cultivation, the clearing is abandoned and suffered to lie fallow for about ten years. The sole implement of agriculture is the large knife or sword, called \u00e1te by the G\u00e1ros. Neither plough nor spade is used, except in the few Hinduized villages bordering on the plains. The rice crop generally raised corresponds to the \u00e1us of Bengal; the out-\nturn is estimated at about 4\u00bd cwts. per acre, valued at 15s. The cotton is short in staple and poor in quality, but has been found suited for mixing with woollen fabrics. Several experiments have been made with seed from Hingangh\u00e1t, but hitherto without any success. The attempted introduction of the Kh\u00e1sia potato has also resulted in failure. Among miscellaneous crops may be mentioned\u2014arhar (Cajanus indicus), reared as food for the lac insect, indigo, ginger, turmeric, and p\u00e1n or betel-leaf. Domestic animals are not used for agriculture. Cattle are purchased from the plains for sacrifice; pigs, goats, and fowls are reared for food. Every village contains several watch-dogs, and numbers of dogs are imported from the plains for food.\n\nThere are but few regular day-labourers in the District. A fair remuneration for the G\u00e1ro casually engaged to carry baggage, would be from 4d. to 6d. a day. The work at the station is mainly carried on by coolies imported from the plains, but G\u00e1ros now visit Tur\u00e1 in small numbers in search of work. The G\u00e1ros have no weights nor measures of quantity, but they are extremely acute in guessing the amount of the commodities they barter with Bengali traders. In 1881, the price of the best cleaned rice at Tur\u00e1 was 13s. 8d. per cwt.; of common rice, 5s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nNo such calamity as blight, flood, or drought sufficient to cause famine has been known to occur in the G\u00e1ro Hills, although distress has occasionally occurred, as in 1879, when the remoter villages on the north-eastern boundary suffered to some extent. The country is well watered both by streams and rainfall, but the average harvest of rice is barely sufficient for the local consumption. In the improbable contingency of distress from a failure of the dus crop, the inhabitants could be best relieved by the establishment of food dep\u00f4ts at the hill passes, which would prevent a turbulent population from crowding into the plains. A bridle-path joins Tur\u00e1 with Dhubr\u00ed in the Assam valley, and there is also a cart-road to Dalu in Maimansingh District. Along the former route the telegraph line will be laid. The latter is the line by which Tur\u00e1 draws its supply of food. In 1882, means of communication were afforded by 156 miles of navigable rivers, 37 miles of first-class, and 31 miles of second-class roads.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014There are no special local manufactures in the hills. The G\u00e1ro women weave a coarse cotton cloth for the scanty garments of themselves and the men, using a loom which has evidently been borrowed from Bengal. The cloth is dyed blue with indigo, and generally ornamented with red stripes. A rude pottery is made in certain villages, but all metal utensils are imported. The District trade is entirely conducted at the small markets situated at the passes leading into the plains. The principal articles of export are\u2014cotton, timber, boats, bamboos, firewood, rubber, and lac; the imports received\nin exchange consist of\u2014rice, dried fish, cattle, goats, fowls, pigs, cloth, and ornaments. The raw cotton grown on the j\u00fams is brought up by M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants, to be shipped to Sir\u00e1jganj. In 1881, about 30,000 cwts. of uncleaned cotton were exported, valued at 11s. per cwt. The exports of lac are estimated at about 1600 cwts., worth about \u00a33 per cwt.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In the year 1869-70, the total revenue derived from the G\u00e1ro Hills was \u00a3798, while the expenditure on administration amounted to \u00a36476. By 1881 the revenue had risen to \u00a35041, of which \u00a3610 was collected on account of certain samind\u00e1rs in Go\u00e1l-p\u00e1r\u00e1 District; and the expenditure to \u00a313,271.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainy season generally lasts from about the middle of June to the end of October, but occasional showers set in as early as May. The cold weather lasts from November to February; and the months of March and April are usually dry and warm. During the ten years ending 1881, the average annual rainfall registered at Tur\u00e1 station was 126\u00b725 inches. The chief diseases affecting strangers to the hills are fevers of a malarious type, sometimes complicated with enlargement of the spleen or liver, diarrhoea, dysentery, rheumatism, chest affections, and ulcers. The G\u00e1ros, in addition, suffer from bronchocele and elephantiasis. In 1871, a severe epidemic of cholera broke out at the station of Tur\u00e1. Out of 80 persons attacked, as many as 32 died. [For a further account of the G\u00e1ro Hills, see Hunter's Statistical Account of Assam (London: Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1879).]\n\nGarol.\u2014Petty State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. It has been lately transferred to the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls District; but the tribute of \u00a33 is still paid to the Ga\u00e9kw\u00e1r of Baroda through the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha Agency.\n\nGarol\u00e1.\u2014Rent-free estate in S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; consisting of one village, with an area of 5479 acres, and yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a3164. Population (1881) 1017; number of houses, 235. The village became the head-quarters of a tract bestowed by the Emperor of Delhi on R\u00e1o K\u00e1m Chandra, the greater part of which was resumed by the Peshw\u00e1 in 1746. Garol\u00e1 contains a small fort, and is surrounded by a stone wall. To the east is a fine lake, covering 76 acres; the soil around is fertile. Government school for boys.\n\nGarotha.\u2014The north-eastern tahsil of Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a hilly country, gradually sloping down to the plains along the Betwa and the Dhas\u00e1n rivers, and much intersected by native territory. Area, 501 square miles, of which 232 are cultivated. Population (1881) 87,897, namely, males 45,591, and females 42,306; number of villages, 176. Land revenue, \u00a313,965;\ntotal Government revenue, \u00a315,340; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a329,231.\n\nGarrauli.\u2014One of the petty States of Bundelkhand in the Central India Agency, under the Government of India. Gop\u00e1l Singh, the first j\u00e1gird\u00e1r, and the father of the present chief, was one of the most active and daring of the military adventurers who opposed the occupation of Bundelkhand by the British in 1803. He had been in the service of Darjan Singh and Hari Singh, the grandsons of Chhatars\u00e1l Singh, in J\u00e1so; and on the invasion of Al\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, he seized the pargan\u00e1 of Kotr\u00e1 for himself. For years he resisted all efforts of persuasion or force to reduce him to submission; but being at last convinced of the hopelessness of the unequal contest, he submitted on condition of obtaining a full pardon and a provision in land. Accordingly, in 1812, he received the grant of the Garrauli j\u00e1gir. He was succeeded by his son, Diw\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Parichit, a Hindu of the Bundela caste, who is the present chief or j\u00e1gird\u00e1r. He has received a sanad of adoption. The State contains an area of 25 square miles, with 16 villages and 913 houses. Total population (1881) 4976, namely, Hindus, 4779; Muhammadans, 195; and aborigines, 2. Estimated revenue of the chief, \u00a31600. The military force consists of 75 men.\n\nGar\u00fada-giri (or Gardan-giri).\u2014Hill peak in K\u00e1d\u00far District, Mysore State; 3680 feet above sea-level. Latitude 13\u00b0 29' N., longitude 76\u00b0 17' E.\n\nGar\u00fadanadi (or Gaddilam).\u2014River in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. It rises in the Yegal Tank, in Kallakurchi taluk, and is fed by the Mallat\u00e1r, which connects it with the Ponni\u00e1r. Its bed is sandy, and its banks for the most part low. After a course of 59 miles, passing on its way Fort St. David and Cuddalore, it falls into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nGarum\u00e1ri.\u2014Forest reserve in Darrang District, Assam; containing valuable s\u00e1l timber (Shorea robusta). Area, 205\u00b718 acres.\n\nGarvi.\u2014Petty Bhil (Bheel) State in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\nGarw\u00e1.\u2014Town and municipality on the Dauro river, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 9' 45\" N., long. 83\u00b0 51' 10\" E. The chief distributing centre for the surplus produce of Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division, and of a great part of Sarguj\u00e1 and the tributary States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Population (1881) 6043, namely, Hindus, 4977; Muhammadans, 1063; 'others,' 3. Area of town site, 2412 acres. The Garw\u00e1 market is held in the dry season, on the sands of the Dauro river; and here sticklac, resin, catechu, cocoons of tasar silk, hides, oil-seeds, ghi, cotton, and iron are collected for exportation; the imports are food-grains, brass vessels, piece-goods, blankets, silk, salt, tobacco,\nspices, drugs, etc. Municipal revenue (1882-83) \u00a3225, or 8\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Gathar.**\u2014Town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) under 2000. Lies on the Kambar-Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d road. Well known for its rice.\n\n**Gauh\u00e1li.**\u2014Mew\u00e1s State, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area unknown; population (1881) 1946; supposed gross revenue, \u00a32200. The country is extremely mountainous, covered with dense forests, and only partially cultivated. Principal produce, timber and bamboos, for the most part sold in the Taloda market. Climate unhealthy. The chief is a Bh\u00edl Hindu of the Gir\u00e1s family, and holds no patent allowing adoption. He resides at Raisinghpur. He is one of the superior chiefs of Kh\u00e1ndesh; and being a minor, the State is for the present under the direct management of the Political Agent.\n\n**Gauh\u00e1ti (Gowhatt).**\u2014Chief town of K\u00e1mru\u00fap District, Assam; situated on both sides of the Brahmaputra, but principally on the left or south bank, in lat. 26\u00b0 11' N., and long. 91\u00b0 48' E. Population (1881) 11,695, namely, Hindus, 9220; Muhammadans, 2333; and Christians, 142. Area of town site, 2172 acres. Municipal taxation (1882-83), \u00a31347; average rate of taxation, 2s. 2\u00bdd. per head. Gauh\u00e1ti was the ancient capital of the Hindu kingdom of Assam previous to the conquest of the western portion of the valley by the Ahams. It then became the seat of the Bar Ph\u00fakan, or Viceroy of the Aham kings, whose capital was in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District. When Assam was conquered from the Burmese in 1825, Gauh\u00e1ti was selected as the head-quarters of the administration of the Province. On the constitution of the Chief-Commissionership of Assam in 1874, the administrative head-quarters were removed to Shillong in the Kh\u00e1si Hills. Gauh\u00e1ti is, with the exception of Barpet\u00e1 in the same District, the most populous town in the Brahmaputra valley, and spreads over an area of 2 square miles. According to local tradition, it is identified with the city of Pray\u00e1gajyotishapura, the capital of King Naraka and his son Bhagad\u00e1tt\u00e1, monarchs mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. Of its former glories, whether as the capital of a Hindu King or of an Aham Viceroy, the only relics which exist are the mounds and extensive lines of brick fortifications which lie scattered along the banks of the Brahmaputra. The gateways which gave access to the enclosures within the fortifications, and which existed at the beginning of the present century, have now entirely disappeared. A large proportion of the soil in the cultivated fields in the neighbourhood is composed of brick, mortar, and pottery; and carved stones and beautifully-finished slabs, the remains of once noble temples, are frequently found beneath the surface. The numerous tanks, which attest the command of labour possessed by its former rulers, are now, in many cases, choked up with weeds and jungle, or are entirely effaced.\nby a false though luxuriant soil that floats on the stagnant waters concealed beneath.\n\nThe site of the town is regarded, with some justice, as very unhealthy. The Brahmaputra is here almost surrounded by a circle of hills to the north, west, and east, and the basin thus formed is cut off from the breezes which at other points on the river purify the atmosphere. The houses of the European residents are situated along the southern bank of the Brahmaputra, on comparatively high ground; the bazaars lie behind them inland; and beyond these, for a distance of six or seven miles, to the skirts of the Kh\u00e1si Hills, stretches a malarious swamp, partly cultivated with rice, and partly covered with marsh vegetation. Some improvement has been effected in recent years in the sanitation and drainage of the town, and in cleaning and improving the tanks in its immediate neighbourhood. Projects for a more extensive drainage, and for the provision of a pure water-supply, are now (1883) under consideration, and a matured scheme has been drawn up and submitted to the Chief Commissioner, with an application for a loan. Gauh\u00e1ti was formerly a military station, occupied by one of the Assam regiments, but the cantonments have now been abandoned, with the exception of a few military buildings for the accommodation of troops passing through. Gauh\u00e1ti is an important centre of river trade, and one of the largest seats of commerce in Assam. In 1876-77, European piece-goods were imported to the value of \u00a316,000, and cotton twist to the value of \u00a310,500. No later statistics of local traffic are available, the river traffic being now registered only at the border of the Province. An excellent cart road leads south to Shillong, a distance of 63\u00bd miles. The High School at Gauh\u00e1ti formerly possessed a College Department, teaching up to the university examinations; but it was very poorly attended, excessively expensive, and was abolished by Colonel Keatinge, Chief Commissioner of the Province, the money thus saved being expended to better advantage in primary and middle-class education. There is also a Persian School frequented by the children of a small body of Muhammadans settled here. In the immediate neighbourhood of the town is a frequented place of Hindu pilgrimage, the temple of K\u00e1m\u00e1khy\u00e1 (a name of Durg\u00e1). A picturesque temple to Siva, under the title of Um\u00e1nanda, situated on a rocky island in the mid-channel of the Brahmaputra, immediately opposite the centre of the town, is also an object of veneration.\n\nGaur (or Lakhnauti).\u2014Ruined city and ancient capital of Bengal, Maldah District; situated on a deserted channel of the Ganges, in lat. 24\u00b0 52' N., long. 88\u00b0 10' E. The time of the foundation of the city is involved in obscurity, and the whole course of its history, down to the day when it was finally deserted, is only to be conjectured. With\nregard to its origin, it is known that it was the metropolis of Bengal under its Hindu kings. Local traditions connect some of its ruins with the oft-recurring names of Adis\u00far, Ballal Sen, and Lakshman. The most ancient name for the city itself seems to have been Lakshman\u00e1wat\u00ed, corrupted into Lakhnauti. The name Gaur is also of great antiquity, but it is probable that this name was more strictly applicable to the kingdom (called Gauriya Bengala) than to the city. The ascertained history of Gaur begins with its conquest in 1204 A.D. by the Muhammadans, who retained it as the chief seat of their power in Bengal for more than three centuries. At the close of this period were erected the numerous mosques and other Muhammadan buildings, which yet remain in a tolerable state of preservation. When the Afgh\u00e1n kings of Bengal established their independence, they transferred the seat of government to Panduah, a Hindu outpost of Gaur, also in Maldah District and to build the public structures of their new capital, plundered Gaur of every monument that could be removed. Hence it is, that while the ruins of Panduah are covered with stones bearing Hindu sculptures, scarcely a single relic has been found on the site of Gaur that could be definitely referred to a Hindu building. Panduah was soon afterwards deserted, and the royal residence re-transferred to Gaur, which continued, under the name of Janat\u00e1b\u00e1d, to be the capital of Bengal so long as its Muhammadan kings retained their independence. During the latter years of the Afgh\u00e1n dynasty, the seat of government was again removed to Tand\u00e1n or Tangra, a few miles south-west of Gaur, on the bank of the then main channel of the Ganges, which was gradually receding farther and farther west, and disturbing the drainage of the country east of its course.\n\nThis change of the seat of government was made on account of the change in the course of the Ganges, and the alteration of the face of the country and of communications, as well as owing to the unhealthiness of Gaur from its malarious surroundings, after the recession of the Ganges. The fall of Gaur was hastened by its being sacked by Sher Sh\u00e1h and his Afgh\u00e1ns in 1537. It finally disappears from history in 1575. During these last years of its greatness, it suffered many vicissitudes. It was plundered by its own kings, repeatedly besieged, and more than once taken by storm. D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n was the last of the Afgh\u00e1n dynasty. His refusal to pay homage to the Mughal Emperor at Delhi led to the final subjugation of Bengal. A large army under Mana'im Kh\u00e1n finally defeated D\u00e1\u00fad in 1575, and occupied during the rainy and unhealthy season the already decaying city of Gaur. A pestilence broke out, by which thousands of the troops and inhabitants died daily. The people were unable to bury or burn the dead; corpses of Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns were thrown into the moats and tanks, and into the adjoining river Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. The few\npeople that survived the plague left the city, which was never again populated to any extent. The imperial general, who had resolved to maintain Gaur as the seat of government, and to restore its former magnificence, fell a victim to the general contagion.\n\nHenceforth the name of Gaur is scarcely to be found in Muhammadan annals, and the city was never reoccupied after this depopulation. Such appears to be the true account of the desertion of Gaur. But Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton discredits the story of the pestilence, and states that the Mughal viceroys of Bengal used occasionally to reside at the fortified palace at Gaur; and that as late as 1639, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, the brother of Aurangzeb, added buildings to the palace fort in the city. This prince made R\u00e1jmahal the capital of Bengal; and from that time, according to Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, dates the actual abandonment and desolation of Gaur. He thinks that 'the city then went to instant ruin, not from any great or uncommon calamity, but merely from the removal of the seat of government.' The ruins have been a quarry, not only for the brick houses of the neighbouring towns and villages, but also for the mosques, palaces, and public monuments of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is said that the Commercial Residency at English Bazar was constructed with bricks from Gaur. Dense jungle now reigns supreme over the half broken-down ruins of walls, forts, and palaces. Tigers, rock pythons, and pelicans were the chief inhabitants of Gaur for centuries; but during the last twenty years, extensive clearances of jungle have been effected, and the whole area of the city is now more or less under cultivation. As the few ruins left crumble away, and as cultivation extends, only the ramps and ditches and old tanks, and remains of roads, will mark the site of the city of Gaur.\n\nThe ruins were first explored by Mr. H. Creighton in 1801, and afterwards by Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton in 1810. This latter gentleman has left an elaborate description of the ruins as they then appeared, from which the following account is mainly condensed. It must be remembered, however, that their dilapidation, partly from natural causes, but chiefly by the hand of man, has rapidly advanced since that time.\n\nThe city, with its suburbs, covered an area variously estimated at from 20 to 30 square miles. The situation is somewhat elevated, and the soil is clay, affording good material for bricks, and well suited to preserve the houses from inundation, and the site of the city from diluvion. Countless millions of small, thin bricks were used in building Gaur. The dimensions of the city proper, i.e. the part within the great continuous embankment (partly natural and partly artificial), were about $7\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length from north to south, and from 1 to 2 miles in breadth, giving a total area of about 13 square miles. The west side of the city was throughout washed by the main stream of the Ganges, the eastern side being protected partly by the Mah\u00e1nad\u00e1 and partly by a line of\nperennial swamps, which were formerly a channel of the Ganges. To the south but little protection was needed, for the junction a little lower down of the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 and the Ganges would have prevented an invader from choosing such a circumscribed base of operations. To the north, which was the most accessible quarter, an artificial bulwark was required. A line of fortifications, about 6 miles in length, extends in an irregular curve from the old channel of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed at Sont\u00e1l\u00e1 to near the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 at Bholah\u00e1t. This rampart, mainly composed of brick, is about 100 feet wide at its base. At each end, where it touches on the rivers, it is cut off by a ditch 120 feet wide. At the north-east part of this curve is a gate, protected by a strong projecting outwork in the form of a quadrant, through which a high embanked road passes north and south. This outwork contains many tanks, and the monument of a Muhammadan saint. It seems to have been the station of the police officer who had charge of this part of the city.\n\nNear the north-east corner of the outwork, at the confluence of the K\u00e1lindr\u00ed with the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1, stands a min\u00e1r or tower, which, although now fallen to ruin, still presents a striking object as viewed from the ferry at Min\u00e1sar\u00e1i. North of the rampart, and entirely apart from the city, are the sites of two isolated ruins, connected with the names of Adis\u00far and Ballal Sen, early Hindu kings of Bengal. Close by is the site of the ruins of the palace where Ballal Sen is said to have resided, consisting, like the palace at Dacca, of a square of about 400 yards, surrounded by a ditch. Behind the rampart is the northern suburb of the city. It is of vast extent, in the shape of a quadrant of a circle, with an area of about 6000 yards. It does not appear to have been at any time thickly inhabited. The eastern portion is now occupied by marshes; but the western portion, near the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, is enclosed by earthworks, and contains many public buildings. Here is situated the large S\u00e1g\u00e1r D\u00edgh\u00ed, the most celebrated artificial piece of water in Bengal. It was formed by uniformly deepening, and embanking from north to south, natural hollows existing in the high clay lands. The place was probably used extensively for a long time for brickmaking before it was converted into a tank. Its dimensions are almost 1600 yards from north to south, and more than 800 from east to west. The banks are built of brick, and the water remains pure and sweet to the present day. This was a Hindu structure; and in the neighbourhood are the two most frequented places of Hindu pilgrimage in the District, namely, V\u00e1dull\u00e1pur gh\u00e1t and the Durbasine shrine. The banks, however, are now occupied with Muhammadan buildings, of which the most conspicuous is the tomb of Mukhdam Sh\u00e1h Jal\u00e1l, a saint who is stated to have exercised great influence in the time of the early Musalm\u00e1n kings of Bengal. Near this tomb is a small mosque. Both these buildings are supported\nby an endowment, and tolerably well cared for. Opposite this suburb, at a market-place now called S\u00e1dull\u00e1pur, is the chief descent (gh\u00e1t) to the old bed of the Ganges. To this spot dead bodies of Hindus are still brought from great distances to be buried. It is said to have been the only burning gh\u00e1t allowed to the Hindus in Gaur by their Muhammadan rulers.\n\nImmediately to the south lies the city itself, which, towards each suburb and along the Ganges, has been defended by a strong rampart and ditch. On the side facing the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 the rampart has been double, and in most parts there have been two immense ditches, and in some parts three. These works were designed for embankments against inundation, and were utilized for drains and for fortifications. The double embankment appears to have been constructed to prevent the Ganges from cutting away the site of Gaur, when the main body of its water east of the city began to gravitate westwards. This is known to have occurred in the early part of the sixteenth century. The hardness of the clay highlands on which Gaur was built, and these works, resisted encroachments by the river; and the Ganges cut fresh channels west of the embanked city, instead of sweeping away and levelling the city as might have been expected. The base of the outer embankment was in one place measured by Mr. Creighton, and found to be 150 feet thick.\n\nBy far the greater portion of the 13 square miles thus enclosed appears to have been thickly inhabited. Small tanks are everywhere to be seen, as well as many foundations of houses and the remains of small places of worship. Broad roadways from east to west traverse this northern part of the city at irregular intervals. There were also communications by water within the city, and a regular system of internal drainage for carrying off the rain-water to the large natural and artificial reservoirs. In the southern part there have been numerous roads, raised very high, and so wide that, in many places, small buildings of brick were erected, with rows of trees in front, on their sides. These were probably chapels, or other places of public resort; while the dwelling-houses were huddled together along the sides of the tanks. Somewhat to the south, on the banks of the Bh\u00e1gfrath\u00ed, was the citadel or kil\u00e1, a work evidently of the Muhammadan period. It extends about a mile in length from north to south, by about 600 to 800 yards broad. The rampart which encircles this area has been very strongly built of brick, with many flanking angles and round bastions at the corners. The palace, at the south-east corner of the citadel, was surrounded by a wall of brick about 40 feet high and 8 feet thick. In the interior, the remains of several cross-walls are visible, but the arrangement of the apartments cannot be ascertained. Indeed, almost the whole site is now under cultivation. A little north of the palace are\nthe royal tombs, where Husain Sh\u00e1h and other independent kings of Bengal lie buried. This building has been almost entirely destroyed, but it had evidently considerable pretensions to elegance. The floor was paved with stone, and the graves were covered with slabs of polished hornblende. Not one of these stones, however, now remains.\n\nWithin the citadel, also, are two mosques, the larger of which has fallen into ruins. The smaller, built by Husain Sh\u00e1h, or by his successor, Nazrat Sh\u00e1h, known as the Kadam R\u00e1s\u00fal Mosque, is in good preservation, being supported by an adequate endowment. Just outside the east wall of the citadel stands a lofty tower of brick, up the centre of which runs a winding stair leading to a chamber at the summit. It is known as the Pfr As\u00e1 Man\u00e1ra, but no object is assigned for its erection by the natives. Mr. Fergusson, however, in his History of Eastern Architecture, states that it is evidently a pillar of victory, a Jay\u00e1 Stambh\u00e1, such as the Kutab Min\u00e1r at Delhi.\n\nAbout a mile and a half north of the citadel is a place of 600 square yards, surrounded by a rampart and ditch, known as the Flower-Garden. South-east of this is the Piy\u00e1sb\u00e1ri, or 'Abode of Thirst,' a tank of considerable dimensions, but containing bad brackish water. A tradition states that condemned criminals were allowed to drink nothing but water from this tank, and thus perished of thirst. There are many other large tanks within the city walls, some containing crocodiles, which are fed by the resident f\u00e1kirs. Of these, the finest is the small S\u00e1g\u00e1r D\u00edgh\u00ed, which is inferior in size only to the tank of the same name in the north suburb. Between the Piy\u00e1sb\u00e1ri and the citadel is the Great Golden Mosque, reckoned the grandest building in Gaur. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton thought its proportions mean. It is 180 feet from north to south, 60 feet from east to west, and 20 feet high to the top of the cornice. It is a perfect parallelopiped without projection or recess, except that it was formerly covered with 33 domes. The only other structure of interest is the fine central gate in the south wall of the city. It is called the Kotw\u00e1li Darw\u00e1z\u00e1, presumably from the circumstance that the superintendent of police was stationed here. This gate is still in good preservation (1883).\n\nSouthwards from this gate stretches an immense suburb as far as Pukhariy\u00e1, a distance of about 7 miles. Its width is comparatively small, but it bears abundant traces of having been at one time densely populated. It was called Firozp\u00far, from Firoz Sh\u00e1h, the second of the two kings of Bengal of that name. Towards the east and south lay an embankment and ditch, probably designed to ward off the floods, which have now created large marshes in that direction. This southern suburb contains a good number of public buildings. The most prominent among these are the Lesser Golden Mosque, which Dr.\nBuchanan-Hamilton describes as 'one of the neatest pieces of architecture in the whole place;' and the tomb of Ni\u00e1mat-ull\u00e1h-W\u00e1li. This person was the spiritual guide of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, and his monument, which is small and clumsy, is to this day carefully tended by his descendants.\n\nSuch are the ruins of Gaur. No doubt many of the accounts of its vast population are oriental exaggerations. But even according to Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, who places the inhabited area at 20 square miles, it would have contained over 600,000 or 700,000 souls. The actual city of Gaur was long entirely deserted, and was formerly overgrown with dense jungle; but cultivation is gradually spreading, and clusters of habitations and new villages are appearing here and there amid the ruins of the ancient city.\n\n**Gaura.**\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Gora.\n\n**Gaura Jam\u00fan.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Musafirkh\u00e1na tahsil, Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh. Area, 93 square miles, of which 49 are under cultivation. Population (1881) 47,749, namely, males 23,282, and females 24,467; average density, 513 persons per square mile; 91 villages. Land revenue, \u00a36153.\n\n**Gaurangdih\u00ed.**\u2014Hills in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal. Three conical hills at a village of the same name, 24 miles from B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, on the road to Raghun\u00e1thpur; about 300 feet above the level of the surrounding country, covered with tree jungle, and so steep as to be only accessible to men. Lat. 23\u00b0 26' N., long. 86\u00b0 48' 45\" E.\n\n**Gaurih\u00e1r.**\u2014One of the petty States in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency; situated between 25\u00b0 14' and 25\u00b0 26' N. lat, and between 80\u00b0 12' and 80\u00b0 21' E. long. It is bounded on the east by B\u00e1nda District and part of Ham\u00edrpur, on the north and west by B\u00e1nda, and on the south by the Chhatarpur State. The area of the State is 72'7 square miles; it contains 14 villages and 1903 houses. Total population (1881) 10,691, namely, Hindus, 10,295; Muhammadans, 394; 'others,' 2. The estimated revenue of the chief is \u00a35000 a year. The predecessor of the last ruler was a guerilla leader of importance during the period of anarchy in Bundelkhand which prevailed at the close of the last century. He received a grant of the Gaurih\u00e1r j\u00e1tir in 1807. The last chief, R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Rudra Singh, did good service, at great personal loss, during the Mutiny of 1857; for which he received the title of R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur, a dress of honour worth Rs. 10,000, and the privilege of adoption, which was subsequently confirmed by sanad. Rudra Singh died in 1877, and was succeeded by an adopted son, Gajadhar Pr\u00e1s\u00e1d, the present chief. He maintains a military force of 3 guns, 35 cavalry, and 240 foot soldiers. Gaurih\u00e1r town is situated in lat. 25\u00b0 16' N., and long. 80\u00b0 14' E.\n\n**Gauripur.**\u2014Village in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam, on the right bank\nof the Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r river. Lat. 26\u00b0 11' N., long. 90\u00b0 7' E. Population (1881) 1900. It is the residence of one of the wealthiest landowners in the District, and a busy centre of river traffic. A large trading fair is held here during the Durg\u00e1-Puj\u00e1 festival in October or November. In 1876-77, Gauripur exported to Sir\u00e1jganj, in P\u00e1bna District, 28,900 maunds of jute.\n\nGavipur.\u2014Village in Bangalore District, Mysore State; 1 mile southwest of the fort of Bangalore. Latitude 12\u00b0 56' N., longitude 77\u00b0 36' E. Population (1881) 624. Celebrated for the cave-temple of Gavi Gang\u00e1dharesvara, constructed in the time of Kempe Gauda (1537). The emblems of Siva\u2014the trident, the umbrella, and the double drum\u2014are carved out of the solid rock on a colossal scale, each being 15 feet high.\n\nGavrid\u00e1r.\u2014Petty State in H\u00e1l\u00e1r pr\u00e1nt or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 6 villages, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Population (1881) 3055. The original seat of the chiefs of P\u00e1lit\u00e1na, with which place it is connected by a made road. Mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed and the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahm\u00e1di. Estimated revenue, \u00a31300; tribute of \u00a3101 payable to the British Government, and \u00a361 to Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\nG\u00e1wilgarh.\u2014Hill range, a branch of the S\u00e1tpura mountains, in Ber\u00e1r; situated between 21\u00b0 10' and 21\u00b0 46' 30\" N. latitude, and between 76\u00b0 40' and 77\u00b0 53' E. longitude; so named from the Gauli tribe. Immediately east of Bet\u00fal District the S\u00e1tpuras divide into two distinct chains\u2014the one running on to the west coast between, and nearly parallel to, the T\u00e1pti and Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) rivers; whilst the other, passing in a south-westerly direction through Bet\u00fal, the Melgh\u00e1t or upland country of Ellichpur, and the southern portion of Nim\u00e1r, terminates at the junction of the T\u00e1pti with its principal tributary, the P\u00farna. In Melgh\u00e1t, the crest of the range attains an average elevation of 3400 feet above sea-level, the highest point, Bair\u00e1t, being 3987 feet. The main height of the lower hills, bordering upon the T\u00e1pti, is about 1650 feet. The chief passes are\u2014Malh\u00e1ra on the east, Dulgh\u00e1t on the west, and Bing\u00e1ra on the extreme west; the first two have been made practicable for wheeled vehicles; several other roads are in course of completion or projected, which will open out this difficult portion of country entirely. There are also several smaller intermediate tracks, used by the Kork\u00fas in bringing their wood and forest produce for sale in the markets at the foot of the hills.\n\nG\u00e1wilgarh.\u2014Hill fortress in the G\u00e1wilgarh range, in the Melgh\u00e1t Sub-division of Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r; situated on the watershed between the P\u00farna and T\u00e1pti rivers. Latitude 21\u00b0 21' 30\" N., longitude 77\u00b0 24' 30\" E.; elevation, 3595 feet above sea-level. The hill was first fortified\nby the Gaul\u00eds, a tribe from whom it takes its name, and who are still numerous here. The fortress, however, dates from 1420, its construction being assigned to Ahmad Sh\u00e1h of the B\u00e1hmani dynasty. It was held at different times by the Niz\u00e1m and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, being captured from the latter by the British in December 1803. At that time it consisted of one complete inner fort facing the steepest part of the mountain, covered by an outer fort, defending its approaches to the north and north-west. The walls were strongly built, and fortified by towers and ramparts. The communications with the fort are through three gates\u2014one to the south with the inner fort, one to the north-west with the outer fort, and one to the north\u2014and by a road made, after the capture, up the western face of the hills. A handsome mosque occupies one of the highest points of the fort, and in it are eight tanks, four only of which contain water during the warm season. The march of General Stevenson up the hills through the Malh\u00e1ra Pass eastward of G\u00e1wilgarh, and round to Lab\u00e1da on the northern side of the fort, is described by Sir Arthur Wellesley as one of the most difficult, as well as successful, operations he had witnessed. The fort was breached by batteries from Lab\u00e1da, and gallantly carried by storm on the 15th December 1803. The fort was dismantled in 1853, and the only buildings now standing are two mosques, the powder factory, and Shora-kh\u00e1na.\n\nGay\u00e1.\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 17' and 25\u00b0 19' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 4' and 86\u00b0 5' E. long. It is bounded on the north by Patn\u00e1 District, on the east by Monghyr, on the south and south-east by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and Haz\u00e1r\u00edbagh, and on the west by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, the boundary line being formed by the river Son (Soane). Area, 4712 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 2,124,682. The chief place in the District is Gay\u00e1 town, but the civil station and administrative headquarters are at S\u00e1hibganj, which is distinct from, although adjoining Gay\u00e1 town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The southern boundary of Gay\u00e1 is formed by an irregular ridge of hills of no great height, but prettily wooded, and full of game. These hills may be regarded as part of the Vindhyan system, by which the great Gangetic plain is bounded on the south; from them the District slopes gently northward towards the Ganges. The country is generally flat, but here and there hills are found, either isolated or in groups, the higher ones covered with jungle and coarse grass, the others rocky and bare. The loftiest of these peaks is M\u00e1her Hill, about 12 miles south-east of Gay\u00e1 town, which rises to a height of 1620 feet above the sea. The only other remarkable clusters of hills in the District, besides the southern range already referred to, are the Bar\u00e1b\u00e1r, or, as they are called in old maps, Currumshaw Hills; and a range\nwhich forms portion of the boundary between Gay\u00e1 and Patn\u00e1, and contains (on the Patn\u00e1 side) R\u00e1jgriha, the famous sacred mount, a place of great antiquarian interest.\n\nThe eastern part of Gay\u00e1 is highly cultivated; the portions to the north and west are less fertile, and the remainder of the District consists of hills and jungles, which are full of wild animals, and in which the hunters collect tasar silk, beeswax, resin, gums of all kinds, and the valuable fruit of the mahu\u00e1 tree. This part of the country was formerly thinly peopled and little cultivated, but of late years much of the jungle has been cleared away, and the cultivated area is rapidly increasing. The soil generally is alluvial. Most of the rivers of the District take their rise in the southern mountains, and flow from south to north; the principal of them, however, the Son, which forms the boundary between Gay\u00e1 and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts, rises in the Central Provinces. It contains water at all seasons of the year, and in every part of its course; and its channel here is almost equal in size to that of the Ganges. After heavy rains this channel is almost filled, and the rapidity of the current is such as to render up-stream navigation almost impossible. But generally speaking, during the rainy season, boats of twenty tons burthen traverse the whole extent of Gay\u00e1 District, and small boats of under a ton can navigate throughout the year. The Son derives its name from the golden colour of its sand, with which are intermixed many small pebbles, some of them prettily coloured, and susceptible of polish. The next river of importance is the P\u00fanp\u00fan, which rises in the extreme south of the District, and flows in a north-easterly course towards the Ganges. During the driest part of the year there is always some stream; and the water is extensively used for irrigation by the neighbouring villages. Small channels called pains, often continuing for a considerable distance, distribute the river water over the fields, or flow into large public reservoirs, ahars, where it is stored until required by the cultivators. The Ph\u00e1lg\u00fa, formed by the junction of two hill torrents, flows through the District, and is chiefly noteworthy for the reverence in which it is held by the pilgrims who flock in large numbers to Gay\u00e1; during the hot weather the stream dries up. The other rivers of the District are the Dh\u00e1rh\u00e1r, the Dong\u00e1, the Tiliy\u00e1, the Dhanarj\u00ed, the Shob, the K\u00fasi, and the Sakr\u00ed, all used for irrigation.\n\nGay\u00e1 District is traversed by two important lines of canal, the Eastern Main Canal from the Son to the P\u00fanp\u00fan river, a distance of 8 miles; and the Patn\u00e1 Canal, which branches off about 4 miles from the Son Canal, and flowing northwards as nearly as possible parallel to the Son, joins the Ganges in Patn\u00e1 District between B\u00e1nkipur and Dinapur, after a course of 79 miles, of which 43 miles lie in Gay\u00e1 District. Another principal branch of the Son Canal system, the Western Main\nCanal, takes off from the other side of the river opposite the Eastern Canal, and flows through Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District. The wild animals of the District comprise tigers, found in the southern hill ranges; leopards and bears in most parts of the District. Antelope and hog are common, and different varieties of deer are numerous in the south. Hyenas abound; wolves are very troublesome, and deaths from these animals are common, especially in Naw\u00e1da Sub-division. Smaller game include jungle-fowl, pea-fowl, wild duck, teal, quail, snipe, and partridge.\n\n**History.**\u2014Materials for the administrative history of Gay\u00e1 are scanty, as the records were burnt during the Mutiny. After the acquisition of the Province of Behar by the English in 1765, the management was entrusted to a distinguished native, Shit\u00e1b R\u00e1i. Gay\u00e1, as at present constituted, then formed part of the District of Behar, and its history for the first fifty years of British rule does not admit of separation from the Province of the same name. In 1814, the south of the District was placed under the jurisdiction of a special Joint Magistrate, stationed at Shergh\u00e1t\u00ed. In 1825, Gay\u00e1 was constituted an independent Collectorate, with a jurisdiction including the present Sub-division of Behar. For revenue purposes, the Collector was under the jurisdiction of the Board of Commissioners at Patn\u00e1 and Benares, created in 1817. For judicial purposes, there were native *munsifs*, under a Judge-Magistrate; from whom, again, an appeal lay to the Provincial Civil Court at Patn\u00e1. In 1829, this Court, and also the Board, were abolished, and their powers were vested in a Commissioner at Patn\u00e1, acting under the orders of the Board in Calcutta. In 1831, increased powers were given to the Judge-Magistrate of Gay\u00e1 as a Sessions Judge, and his magisterial powers were made over to the Collector. Thus the present unit of administration, the Magistrate-Collector, was created. In 1845, the offices of Magistrate and Collector were separated, to be reunited by order of the Secretary of State in 1859.\n\nThough Gay\u00e1 was not the scene of fighting during the Mutiny of 1857, yet an incident took place in the District worthy of record. The Sepoys in the neighbouring cantonments at Dinapur mutinied in July, and escaped into Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. After the first attack upon them by a British force had resulted in disaster, orders were issued by the Commissioner of Patn\u00e1 to all the civil officers within his jurisdiction to withdraw their establishments and retire on Dinapur. A small garrison of the 64th Regiment, together with a few Sikhs, were then stationed at Gay\u00e1 town. In obedience to the written orders of the Commissioner, the handful of soldiers and civilians at Gay\u00e1 started on the road to Patn\u00e1, leaving behind about 7 *l\u00e1khs* of rupees (\u00a370,000) in the treasury. But on the way bolder counsels prevailed. Mr. Money, the Magistrate of the District, and Mr. Hollings, an uncovenanted official\nin the opium agency, determined to return to Gay\u00e1 and save what they could from the general pillage that would inevitably follow upon the abandonment of the town. The detachment of the 64th was also sent back. The town was found still at peace. A few days were spent in providing carriage for the treasure. But the Patn\u00e1 road had become unsafe, and the only means of retreat now open was by the Grand Trunk Road to Calcutta. As soon as the little party had started a second time, they were attacked by a mixed rabble of released prisoners and the former jail-guards. After repulsing the attack, Mr. Money conveyed his treasure safely to Calcutta, where his arrival was welcomed with enthusiasm.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the District, according to the Census of 1872, was 1,947,824 persons, dwelling in 6530 villages or towns, and 327,845 houses, the average density of the population being 413 persons to the square mile. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 2,124,682, showing an increase of 176,858, or 9\u00b707 per cent., in the nine years. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1882 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 4712 square miles; number of towns and villages, 9657; number of houses, 372,648, of which 346,794 are occupied and 25,854 unoccupied. Total population, 2,124,682, namely, males 1,043,441, and females 1,081,242. Average density of population, 451 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 2\u00b705; persons per village, 220; houses per square mile, 79\u00b71; persons per house, 6\u00b713. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 1,891,484, or 89\u00b70 per cent., and Muhammadans 213,141, or 11\u00b70 per cent.; Christians and \u2018others,\u2019 100. Of aboriginal and semi-Hinduized tribes, the most numerous are the Dos\u00e1dhs, of whom there are 108,249; the Bhuiy\u00e1s, who number 83,469; and the Kharw\u00e1rs, 3569. These aborigines, who in religion profess some sort of Hinduism, live chiefly in the south of the District, and support themselves on the produce of the jungles, or by thieving, cattle-lifting, and hunting. The high-caste Hindus include\u2014Brahmans, 79,750; R\u00e1jputs, 114,402; B\u00e1bhans, agricultural Br\u00e1hmans who have lapsed from pure Brahmanhood by reason of their occupation, 152,646; Baniy\u00e1s or traders, 49,304; K\u00e1yasths, Government officers, clerks and landholders, 43,965.\n\nAmong the 79,570 Br\u00e1hmans of Gay\u00e1 are included a number of persons who, though not regular or orthodox Br\u00e1hmans, are allowed a kind of brevet rank as such. Of these the most remarkable are the Gay\u00e1w\u00e1ls, of whom there are about 300 families in the District. Although they are held in great esteem at the places of pilgrimage in Gay\u00e1 town, respectable Br\u00e1hmans look down upon them; they live an idle, self-indulgent life, but are very wealthy, extorting large sums out of the numerous pilgrims. A detailed account of the origin and customs of\nthis curious class of men is to be found in vol. xii. of the Statistical Account of Bengal (pp. 35, 49, 77).\n\nThe agricultural and pastoral castes include\u2014Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, 309,871 in number, the most numerous caste in the District; Koer\u00eds, 144,675; K\u00farm\u00eds, 43,791; Garer\u00eds, 15,597; Baru\u00eds, 5863; and M\u00e1ls, 7740. The principal artisan castes are the Barh\u00e1\u00eds, or carpenters, 36,166 in number; Kumbhars, potters, 22,282; Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths, 21,425; and Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths, 15,863. Other respectable S\u00fadra castes, mainly engaged in personal service\u2014N\u00e1pits, barbers, 37,838; Dhob\u00eds, washermen, 16,733; Kah\u00e1rs, domestic servants, palanquin-bearers and labourers, 116,961; M\u00e1las, 11,906; K\u00e1ndus, confectioners, 23,784; and Madaks, preparers of parched food-grains, 12,900. Other castes\u2014Tel\u00eds, oil-sellers, 57,379; Nuniy\u00e1s, labourers, 16,621; T\u00e1twas, weavers, 5051; Sunr\u00ed\u00eds, wine-sellers, 6643; P\u00e1s\u00eds, palm toddy sellers, 39,293; Rajw\u00e1rs, labourers, 43,773; Cham\u00e1rs, leather dressers and labourers, 78,552. The Muhammadan population are divided into\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 207,241; Shi\u00e1s, 3383; and unspecified, 22,474.\n\nSix towns contain more than 5000 inhabitants\u2014namely, Gay\u00e1, with a population (1881) of 76,415; Tikari, population 12,187; Daudnagar, population 9870; Sherghati, population 5862; Jahanabad, population 5286; and Hasua, population 5019. Of the 9657 towns and villages in the District, 6395 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 2460 from two to five hundred, 629 from five hundred to a thousand, 154 from one to two thousand, 10 from two to three thousand, 3 from three to five thousand, 4 from five to ten thousand, 1 from ten to fifteen thousand, and 1 upwards of fifty thousand.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male population into six main classes, as follows:\u2014(1) Professional, including Government officers and servants and professional men, 17,481; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house servants, etc., 52,642; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 31,546; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, herdsmen, etc., 283,197; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 84,208; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 157,396 general labourers, and 416,971 male children and persons of no specified occupation), 574,367.\n\nThe District of Gay\u00e1 is full of places of the greatest sanctity. The rocky hills, which here run out far into the plain of the Ganges valley, teem with associations of the prehistoric religion of Buddhism, many of which have been diverted to new objects by modern superstition. The Br\u00e1hmans stamped out the Buddhist faith, but they have utilized its local traditions to their own profit. At the present day, the chief pilgrims to the sacred tree at Budh Gay\u00e1 are devout Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who come to pray for the souls of their ancestors in purgatory. As a place of Hindu pilgrimage, the town of Gay\u00e1 is of comparatively modern\ninterest. The name is derived from that of a pagan monster, whose fate is recorded in the *V\u00e1yu Pur\u00e1na*. His only crime was his desire to save sinners from perdition. Accordingly, Brahma himself undertook the task of putting a stop to his career. This he effected by treacherously persuading him to lie down, and then placing a heavy stone upon his body. When the monster struggled to get free, the gods prevailed upon him to keep quiet, by the promise that they would come and take up their abode on the spot, and that all pilgrims who worshipped there should be delivered from the pains of hell. The profitable lesson of this legend has been turned to good account by the Gay\u00e1w\u00e1s, or Br\u00e1hman priests, who possess the monopoly of pointing out the sacred spots, and reciting the appropriate prayers.\n\nThe pilgrim who would effectually secure admission for his ancestors into heaven, must scrupulously perform the whole routine of duties, each one of which involves presents to the priest. Before leaving his home, he must first walk five times round his native village, calling upon the souls of his ancestors to accompany him on his journey. Arrived at Gay\u00e1, he is forthwith placed in charge of a special Br\u00e1hman guide. There are 45 sacred localities, which he should visit in proper order and on particular days. The full round occupies 13 days; but for those who have not sufficient devotion, or sufficient wealth, 38 shrines, two, or even only one, will serve the desired purpose. Each of these sacred places, *bed\u00ed*, *tirat*, or *tirtha*, is supposed to represent the footprint of some deity. At each, a *pind\u00e1* or ball of rice and water has to be deposited by the pilgrim, while a hymn is chanted by the attendant Br\u00e1hman. Some of the spots lie a considerable distance beyond the city walls, on the summit of steep hills, the ascent of which demands not a little enthusiasm on the part of the devotees. Others are crowded together within the walls of old narrow temples. The popularity of Gay\u00e1 appears to have increased with the growth of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. The records frequently refer to the arrival of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princes, as matters of political importance during the early years of British rule. Towards the end of last century, a Peshw\u00e1 is said to have expended \u00a310,000 upon a pilgrimage to Gay\u00e1. The average number of pilgrims in the year is now estimated at 100,000; and it has been calculated that a poor man might accomplish the full round at a cost of \u00a32. The pilgrim-tax, varying from about 4s. to 28s. per head, levied under the native government, was abolished during the early years of British rule.\n\n*Tikari*, on the Murhar river, contains the fort of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Tik\u00e1ri; *Jahanabad* and *Daudnagar* are chiefly interesting as having formerly contained flourishing cloth factories established by the East India Company. Among the other noteworthy villages in the District are *Arwal* on the Son, once famous for its paper and sugar manufactories,\nand now the centre of the only indigo concern in Gay\u00e1; Deo, the seat of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of that name, one of the most ancient families in the District; Naw\u00e1d\u00e1, Waz\u00edrganj, Bela, Has\u00fa\u00e1, and W\u00e1ris\u00e1lganj, considerable trading places. At BUDDH (or BODH) GAY\u00c1, about 6 miles south of Gay\u00e1, and a few hundred yards west of the Ph\u00e1lgu or Nil\u00e1jan river, there are ruins of great sanctity. Here dwelt S\u00e1kya Muni, the founder of the Buddhist religion, and here is the pipal tree under which he sat in mental abstraction for five years. Here, too, are extensive remains of temples and monuments, and of the R\u00e1j\u00e1sth\u00e1n or palace, said to be the residence of Dharma Asoka, and some of his successors on the throne of Magadha. Close at hand is a convent, the mahant or abbot of which shows the place to visitors. Another place of interest in the District is a temple of great antiquity, which crowns the highest peak of the Bar\u00e1b\u00e1r Hills. This temple is sacred to Sidhesw\u00e1ra, and contains a ling\u00e1 said to have been placed there by B\u00e1r\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, the Asar King of Din\u00e1jpur. In September, a large fair, attended only by men, is held here. The pilgrims, who number between 10,000 and 20,000, spend a night on the mountain. Near the foot of the hill are some caves cut in the rock about 200 B.C., and in the immediate neighbourhood are a sacred spring and tank, and several sculptures of great interest to the antiquary.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The most important crop of the District is rice, which is sown in June or early in July. The bhaddi crop is reaped in August or September; the kharif crop is transplanted in July or August, and cut in December or January. Wheat is sown broadcast in September and October, and reaped in March. Among the other cereals grown are barley, Indian corn, maru\u00e1, and kodo. The chief leguminous crops are khes\u00e1rt, gram, peas, and beans. The other crops include yams and potatoes, hemp and flax, cotton, oil-seeds, opium, indigo, sugar-cane, and p\u00e1n. Rotation of crops is common in the District, and irrigation is much practised, the means used being natural and artificial watercourses, reservoirs, and wells. Manure is always used for cotton and opium. The area ordinarily cultivated with rice is about 900,000 acres, producing over 400,000 tons, of which a fourth part is exported; the wheat-growing area has been estimated at nearly 170,000 acres, producing about 60,000 tons, of which about a half is exported; and the area devoted to oil-seeds is about 35,000 acres. The area under opium cultivation in Gay\u00e1 cannot be given exactly, as the boundaries of the opium sub-divisions are not conterminous with those of the District; but the two sub-divisions of Teht\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1 are almost co-extensive with Gay\u00e1 District, and the sum of their areas is but little in excess of the opium area. In 1872\u201373, the area under cultivation in these two opium sub-divisions was 67,858 acres, the amount of crude opium produced being 668 tons,\nand the average produce per acre about 22 lbs. In 1880-81, the estimated area under opium in Gay\u00e1 District was 63,940 acres, the produce amounting to 501 tons, of the value of about \u00a3263,250. There is only one indigo factory under European management in the District, and for some unexplained reason the dye here cannot be brought to such a state of perfection as it attains north of the Ganges. The area under sugar-cane has been estimated at 13,000 acres. Speaking roughly, a fifth of the total area of the District still lies uncultivated. A fair out-turn of paddy or unhulled rice from an acre of good land would be 30 cwts., value \u00a32, 14s.; from inferior lands, 18 cwts., value \u00a31, 12s. 5d. The out-turn of wheat or barley, and their value, is much the same as in the case of paddy; but the cultivation of these crops is less expensive, and the net profit to the cultivator is consequently higher. Wages for labour are generally paid in kind. There seems to have been little or no variation in money wages during the last quarter of a century, but at an earlier period they were 25 per cent. less than at present. The money wage of a day-labourer is now 3d., that of a smith, bricklayer, or carpenter, from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. per diem. Prices seem to have fallen of late years. In 1859, 1860, and 1870, the prices of the best cleaned rice were respectively 6s. 0\u00bdd., 7s. 6d., and 4s. 5d. per cwt.; in the same years the prices of common rice were 5s. 4d., 6s. 10d., and 3s. 9d. per cwt. respectively. Prices, however, were high in 1882, the rates in the month of September for that year being returned at 9s. 4d. per cwt. for best cleaned rice, and 6s. 0\u00bed. for common rice.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Gay\u00e1 does not suffer from blight or flood to any great extent, but droughts are very common, and seriously affect the prospects of the District. The Son Canals, recently completed, will no doubt prevent much of the loss arising from dry seasons. The District suffered considerably from the famine of 1866, and the mortality was increased by an outbreak of cholera which took place in the middle of July in the town of Gay\u00e1, and spread through the greater part of the District. The number of recipients of gratuitous relief never exceeded a daily average of 1200, and the average daily number of persons employed on relief works was about 350. The maximum price of common rice was 18s. 6d., and of paddy, 9s. 3d. per cwt.; but prices in Gay\u00e1 are not by any means a trustworthy index to the pressure from scarcity. The famine of 1873-74 did not affect the District seriously; the food-supply was augmented by private trade, and the Government had only to supplement this supply by a small amount of grain, and by the provision of relief works on the canals.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014No important manufactures are carried on in Gay\u00e1. Common brass utensils for bengal black stone ornaments, pottery, tasar silk cloth, and paper and sugar grass called\nsabih, are manufactured. Cloth and paper were formerly the principal manufactures, but these industries have now almost entirely died out. Soda effloresces in parts of the District, and a considerable quantity of saltpetre is manufactured and despatched to Calcutta. The principal exports are\u2014food-grains of all kinds (especially rice), oil-seeds, indigo, crude opium (sent to Patna for manufacture), saltpetre, sugar, blankets, brass utensils, etc. Among the imports are\u2014salt, piece-goods, cloth, cotton, timber, bamboos, tobacco, lac, iron, spices, and fruits. The principal trade with other Districts is by the State Railway from Bankipur to Gay\u00e1, which was opened for traffic in March 1879. Its total length is 57 miles; gross earnings for the year 1881\u201382, \u00a354,819; working expenses, \u00a334,241; net earnings, \u00a320,578, or a return of 534 per cent. on the capital outlay.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Owing to the loss of all office records at the time of the Mutiny, it is impossible to give the revenue of Gay\u00e1 District before 1858\u201359. In that year the net revenue was \u00a3213,125; in 1870\u201371, the net revenue was \u00a3192,870; and in 1882\u201383, \u00a3255,464. The land revenue constitutes in Gay\u00e1, as elsewhere in Bengal, the most important item of the revenue; in 1870\u201371, it amounted to \u00a3138,032; and in 1882\u201383, to \u00a3143,688. Sub-division of estates has progressed very rapidly in Gay\u00e1; the number of estates in 1871 was 4411, and the number of registered proprietors, 20,453. The average payment, therefore, from each estate was \u00a331, 5s. 10d., or from each individual proprietor, \u00a36, 14s. 11d. By 1881\u201382, the number of estates had increased to 5614, and the registered proprietors to 59,172, the average payment from each estate being \u00a326. Comparing these figures with the corresponding ones for 1789, found in an old register in the Patna office, it appears that in eighty years each estate had on an average split up into eight, and where there had in 1789 been one proprietor there were in 1881 over fifty. The land revenue in the former year was \u00a3104,170; the subsequent increase has not been great, as remissions have been granted to the Deo R\u00e1j\u00e1s and others for military services. The machinery for the protection of person and property in the District has been steadily increasing in strength. There are now 12 magisterial and 5 civil courts, besides 3 honorary magistrates\u2019 courts. For police purposes, Gay\u00e1 is divided into 14 th\u00e1n\u00e1s, with 24 outposts. The regular District police consisted at the end of 1882 of 3 superior and 99 subordinate officers, and 475 constables; the municipal police at the same time consisted of 318 officers and men; and the village watch numbered 13,126 men. Included among these last is a body of digw\u00e1rs or road policemen, maintained by the landholders. These digw\u00e1rs are peculiar to Gay\u00e1, and appear to have been first appointed early in the present century, in consequence of frequent accidents to travellers on roads and hill passes.\nHighway robbery, once very prevalent in the District, is said to have almost entirely ceased since the introduction of the digw\u0101ri system. The total cost of maintaining the regular and municipal police in 1882 was \u00a311,914, equal to a charge of 1\u00bdd. per head of the population. Burglary and dakhiti are still very common; the criminal classes are principally recruited from the B\u00e1bhans, Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, Dos\u00e1dhs, and Doms. There were 4 jails in the District in 1882\u2014the District jail at Gay\u00e1, and Sub-divisional lock-ups at Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Naw\u00e1d\u00e1. In that year the daily average number of prisoners in the Gay\u00e1 jail was 298\u00b748. Education (specially primary) has made rapid progress of late years. The number of pupils subject to the Education Department increased from 574 in 1856\u201357, to 8139 in 1873\u201374, and to 19,118 in 1882\u201383; the total number of schools in 1873\u201374 was 446, and in 1882\u201383, 1476, or 1 school to every 3\u00b72 square miles of area, and 1 pupil to every 111 of the population. Of the boys of school-going age; 1 in every 6\u00b75 is under instruction.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the District is parcelled out into 4 Sub-divisions\u2014the sadr or head-quarters Sub-division, with an area of 1839 square miles; Naw\u00e1d\u00e1, 1020 square miles; Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1246 square miles; and Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-division, 607 square miles.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Gay\u00e1 is dry, and the District is regarded as very healthy. The average temperature is about 79\u00b098\u00b0 F.; maximum in May 1882, 111\u00b05\u00b0; minimum 68\u00b01\u00b0; maximum in July 95\u00b02\u00b0; minimum 73\u00b00\u00b0; maximum in December 81\u00b09\u00b0, minimum 47\u00b02\u00b0. Average annual rainfall at the town of Gay\u00e1, 39\u00b78 inches. The wettest month is July, and in that month the average rainfall is 11\u00b737 inches. Among the diseases of the District are cholera, leprosy, small-pox, neuralgia, headache, and the 'Gay\u00e1 sore.' Cholera breaks out every now and then in some part of the District. Small-pox is endemic, owing to the objection of the people to vaccination. Neuralgic headache occurs in a very intense form; it often returns periodically, and in some cases defies treatment. Total number of registered deaths in 1882\u201383, 1416, or 19\u00b749 per thousand of the population.\n\n[For further information regarding Gay\u00e1, see The Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xii.

Area, 1839 square miles, with 3719 villages or towns, and 137,370 houses. Population (1881) 805,364, namely, 395,836 males and 409,528 females. Classified according to religion, there are 706,127 Hindus, 99,161 Muhammadans, and 76 Christians. Average density of population, 438 persons per square\nmile; villages, 2\u00b702 per square mile; houses, 78\u00b79 per square mile; persons per village, 217; per house, 5\u00b78. The Sub-division comprises the 5 police circles (th\u00e1nds) of Gay\u00e1, Atr\u00ed, Tik\u00e1ri, Shergh\u00e1t\u00ed, and B\u00e1r\u00e1chati. In 1882, it contained 9 magisterial and 4 revenue courts; with a regular police force of 277 officers and men, besides 6590 village watchmen.\n\nGay\u00e1.\u2014Chief town and (with S\u00e1hibganj) the administrative headquarters of Gay\u00e1 District; situated on the right bank of the Ph\u00e1lgu river. Lat. 24\u00b0 48' 44\" N., and 85\u00b0 3' 16\" E. long. The town consists of two distinct portions adjoining each other\u2014the old town or Gay\u00e1 proper, which contains the residence of the priests; and S\u00e1hibganj, the trading quarter, and also the seat of administration, where the civil offices and the dwelling-houses of the European residents are situated. The streets are wide, but the native houses are generally small and insignificant. Besides the ordinary official courts, S\u00e1hibganj contains the jail, police lines, hospital, circuit bungalow, and church. There is also a public library, billiard-room, swimming-bath, and racecourse. Gay\u00e1 with S\u00e1hibganj forms one municipality. The population of the united towns in 1881 amounted to 76,415, namely, 38,493 males and 37,922 females. Hindus numbered 60,181; Muhammadans, 16,161; and Christians and 'others,' 75. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a37253, of which \u00a33807 was derived from taxation, mainly from houses and lands; expenditure, \u00a36593; average incidence of taxation, 11\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. The town police force consists of 73 officers and 138 men. For the history and shrines of Gay\u00e1, see ante, Gay\u00e1 District.\n\nGazzalh\u00e1tti ('The Elephant Track').\u2014Pass in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 11\u00b0 33' N., longitude 77\u00b0 3' E. Formerly the principal pass from Coimbatore into Mysore, one track leading from Satyamangalam, and another from Coimbatore town via Denaiakenkota to the foot of the gh\u00e1t. An old-fashioned bridge at the foot still stands, but the road is no longer kept in order. Pack-bullocks and donkeys still cross it in considerable numbers. The head of the pass, 2800 feet above sea-level, is 17 miles from the Mysore frontier.\n\nGedi.\u2014Petty State of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r pr\u00e1nt or division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 2 villages, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Nine miles distant from Limbdi railway station. Population (1881) 901. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a3428; tribute of \u00a3120 is payable to the British Government and \u00a313, 18s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nGeonkh\u00e1li (Cowcolly).\u2014Village and lighthouse, on the H\u00fagli river, 13 miles east of Contai, and about 40 miles below Calcutta in Taml\u00fak Sub-division, Midnapur District, Bengal. Lat. 21\u00b0 50' 15\" N.,\nlong. $87^\\circ 59' 15''$ E. The cyclone of October 1864, with its accompanying storm-wave, visited this place and the surrounding country with terrific force. For a full and interesting account of it, given by the lighthouse superintendent, see *Statistical Account of Bengal*, vol. iii. pp. 220-226. The village contains a travellers' bungalow and police outpost station. At this point commences the Hijili (Hidgellee) tidal canal, which runs to Balasor in Orissa.\n\n**Georgegarh.**\u2014Village in Jhajjar tahsil, Rohtak District, Punjab, with remains of an old fort. Lat. $28^\\circ 38' N.$, long. $76^\\circ 37' E.$ Built by the adventurer George Thomas during his temporary dominion over this part of India. He was besieged here by the Marathas in 1801, but succeeded at the head of a small body of cavalry in cutting his way through the investing lines to Hansi, where he was finally overthrown. Two important cattle fairs are held here annually, about March and September.\n\n**Gewarda.**\u2014Estate in Chand\u00e1 District, Central Provinces.\u2014See GIWARDA.\n\n**Gh\u00e1g\u00e1r.**\u2014River rising in the Kotw\u00e1lip\u00e1r\u00e1 Marshes, Far\u00eddpur District, Bengal, in lat. $23^\\circ 1' 45''$ N., long. $90^\\circ 8' 45''$ E. It flows south into the Madhumati (lat. $22^\\circ 48' 30''$ N., long. $89^\\circ 57' 15''$ E.), a distributary of the Ganges, and is called the S\u00e1l\u0111aha in the lower part of its course. Navigable throughout the year by large boats.\n\n**Ghaggar.**\u2014River in the Punjab and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Once an important confluent of the Indus, but now a comparatively insignificant stream, which loses itself by evaporation in the deserts of Bhatner. The Ghaggar rises among the Him\u00e1layan slopes in the Native State of N\u00e1han or Sirm\u00far (lat. $30^\\circ 41' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 14' E.$), leaves the hills a few miles above the town of Mani M\u00e1zra, and crosses Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) District at its narrowest point; thence it traverses the Native State of Pati\u00e1la, flowing close to the British frontier, and passing only 3 miles to the west of Amb\u00e1la city, where it actually touches the borders of our territory; emerging into Hiss\u00e1r District near the town of Akalgarh, it divides into two channels, and formerly passed on to Sirsa with a very uncertain water-supply, but the whole amount is now diverted in Hiss\u00e1r itself for purposes of irrigation. Another branch, however, reaches Sirsa from Pati\u00e1la direct, and crosses the District into the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na deserts. The water penetrates no farther than the fort of Bhatner, just beyond the frontier, but the dry bed may be traced as far as Mirgarh in Bah\u00e1walpur State.\n\nIn ancient times the lower portion of the river appears to have borne the name of its confluent the SARASWATI or Sarsuti, which joins the main stream in Pati\u00e1la territory. It then possessed the dimensions of an important channel, receiving the whole drainage\nof the lower Him\u00e1layas between the Jumna (Jamna) and the Sutlej (Satlaj), and debouching into the Indus below the junction of the five great Punjab rivers. At present, however, every village through which the stream passes has diverted a portion of its waters for irrigation, no less than 10,000 acres being supplied from this source in Amb\u00e1la District alone. The dams thus erected check the course of the stream, while the consequent deposit of silt, greatly facilitated by the dams, has permanently diminished the power of the water, both in the main stream and its tributaries, to force its way across the dead level of the Kam\u00e1l and Pati\u00e1la plains. In Sirsa District the river expands into three jhils or lakes, on which a few Persian wheels are worked for purposes of irrigation. The Ghaggar water, in or near the hills, when used for drinking, produces disastrous results upon the health, causing fever, enlarged spleen, and goitre; families die out, according to report, in the fourth generation; and the villages along its banks are greatly under-populated. Only the prospect of obtaining exceptional returns for their labour can induce cultivators to settle in such an unhealthy region. During the lower portion of its course, in Sirsa District, the bed of the Ghaggar is dry from November to June, affording a cultivable surface for rich crops of rice and wheat. Even in the rains the water-supply is very capricious, and from time to time it fails entirely, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the hills.\n\n**Ghagra.**\u2014River of Oudh.\u2014See Gogra.\n\n**Gh\u00e1ibi Dero** (or *Dero Kot*).\u2014J\u00e1gir or revenue-free town in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lies on the Pauh\u00e1ro-Kambar road, 32 miles north-north-west of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. Latitude 27\u00b0 36' N., longitude 67\u00b0 41' E. Population under a thousand; the Muhammadans are mainly Ch\u00e1ndias. It is the principal town in the j\u00e1gir of Gh\u00e1ibi Kh\u00e1n Ch\u00e1ndia, the chief of the Gh\u00e1ibi Kh\u00e1n and Ch\u00e1ndia tribes, long established in Chandko.\n\n**Ghamar.**\u2014Town in Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Gahmar.\n\n**Gh\u00e1n.**\u2014River of Ber\u00e1r, rising in the table-land north of the Pen-gang\u00e1 valley, Buld\u00e1na District, Ber\u00e1r, in latitude 20\u00b0 26' 30\" N., longitude 76\u00b0 23' 30\" E. The stream, which dries up in the hot weather, flows in a northerly direction past Pimpalg\u00e1on and N\u00e1ndwa, and joins the P\u00farna in latitude 20\u00b0 55' N., and longitude 76\u00b0 33' E. Commonly known as the Dnyan Gang\u00e1.\n\n**Ghara.**\u2014A name sometimes applied to the united stream of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) and the Sutlej (Satlaj), from their confluence at Endr\u00eds\u00e1 to their junction with the Chen\u00e1b. Below the latter point the whole river bears the title of Panjnad. The length of the course between these points amounts to about 300 miles.\nGharapuri ('Hill of Purification'), sometimes also vulgarly called Garipuri; the Galipouri of Du Perron and Niebuhr; spelt Garapuri, and translated 'Town of Excavations' by Dr. Stevenson.\u2014See Elephanta.\n\nGh\u00e1ro.\u2014Village in Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 24\u00b0 44' 30\" N., longitude 67\u00b0 37' 30\" E. Population (1881) under 2000, chiefly occupied in grain trade with Kar\u00e1chi, Tatta, and Mirpur Sakra. The Kar\u00e1chi-Kotri Railway, which runs within 8 miles, has diverted much of the former trade from this place. A bridge of four arches spans the creek of Gh\u00e1ro.\n\nGharra.\u2014Petty State under the G\u00fana (Goona) Sub-Agency of Central India. Population (1881) 9544. Revenue about \u00a31700. This State is feudatory to Gwalior, and was formerly a portion of the Rajhugarh j\u00e1gir, which was divided in 1843 amongst the three principal members of the Kh\u00edch\u00ed family of R\u00e1jputs. During the minority of the present (1883) chief, Balbhaddar Singh, the management of the State is carried on by a k\u00e1mdar under the superintendence of the Political Assistant at G\u00fana.\n\nGh\u00e1t\u00e1l.\u2014Sub-division of Midnapur District, Bengal. Area, 317 square miles, with 913 towns and villages, and 50,144 houses. Population (1881) 287,333, namely, males 138,706, and females 148,627. Average density of population, 906 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 2.9; persons per village, 314; houses per square mile, 173; persons per house, 5.7. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 274,310; Muhammadans, 13,006; Christians, 6; and Sant\u00e1ls, 11. The Sub-division comprises the three police circles (th\u00e1nds) of Gh\u00e1t\u00e1l, Chandrakon\u00e1, and D\u00e1spur. It contained in 1883, 1 criminal and 2 civil courts; strength of regular police force, 113 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 1295.\n\nGh\u00e1t\u00e1l.\u2014Town and municipality in Midnapur District, Bengal, and head-quarters of Gh\u00e1t\u00e1l Sub-division; situated on the Sil\u00e1\u00ed river, near its junction with the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, and transferred a few years ago to Midnapur from H\u00fagl\u00ed District. Lat. 22\u00b0 40' 10\" N., long. 87\u00b0 45' 50\" E. Population (1881) 12,638, namely, males 6261, and females 6377. Hindus numbered 12,311; Muhammadans, 320; and 'others,' 7. Area of town site, 2560 acres. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3481; expenditure, \u00a3394. Gh\u00e1t\u00e1l is an important commercial town, carrying on trade in rice, silk, sugar, cotton cloth, etc.\n\nGh\u00e1tampur.\u2014Southern tahsil of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the banks of the Jumna, and traversed by a branch of the Lower Ganges Canal. The tahsil may be roughly divided into two portions, the river Non marking approximately the boundary between them. The northern is a tract of fertile loam (dumat), while the southern is occupied by the soils peculiar to the\nneighbourhood of the Jumna, and in parts is cut up by wild and bare ravines. Area, 336 square miles, of which 208 are cultivated. Population (1881) 113,946, namely, males 57,836, and females 56,110. Hindus numbered 108,532; and Muhammadans, 5414. Land revenue, \u00a329,204; total Government revenue, \u00a332,708; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a347,516. Of the 275 estates in the tahsil at the time of the recent settlement, 171 were zamindari, 96 pattidari, 7 bhaydchara, and 1 muafi or revenue-free.\n\nGh\u00e1tampur.\u2014Town in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Gh\u00e1tampur tahsil, situated on the Ham\u00edrpur road, 26 miles west of Cawnpur city. Population (1881) 4916. The town was formerly a stronghold of the Bais clan, who expelled the Ahirs about five centuries ago, and gave the town the name of their leader Gh\u00e1tam Deo. The principal building is a picturesque Gosain temple, situated in a mango grove south of the town. The public buildings comprise the tahsil, first-class police station, dispensary, school, and post-office. There is also an encamping-ground for troops.\n\nGh\u00e1tampur.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh. A small pargan\u00e1, 8 miles long by 7 broad. Area, 26\u00bd square miles, or 16,937 acres, of which 12 square miles are cultivated. Government land revenue, \u00a32247, or an average of 2s. 7\u00bdd. per acre. Land is held under the following tenures:\u2014Zamindari, 15,056 acres; talukdari, 267 acres; and pattidari, 1414 acres. Population (1881) 15,469, namely, 7615 males and 7854 females. The B\u00e1is Kshatriyas form the most numerous caste. Number of villages, 29; average density of population, 620 per square mile.\n\nGh\u00e1tampur Kal\u00e1n.\u2014Town in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 18 miles south-east of Un\u00e1o town, and 12 south of P\u00farwa. Lat. 26\u00b0 22' N., long. 80\u00b0 46' E. Said to have been founded many centuries ago by an eponymous Tiw\u00e1ri Br\u00e1hman, whose heirs are still in possession. Noted for excellence in goldsmiths\u2019 and carpenters\u2019 work. Population (1881) 1668 Hindus, and 45 Muhammadans; total, 1713, dwelling in 372 houses. Four Hindu temples.\n\nGh\u00e1tkul.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; consisting of 81 villages, with an area of 368 square miles. Hilly and densely wooded, except in the east along the Waingang\u00e1 river, where the black-loam produces good crops of rice, sugar-cane, and wheat. Population chiefly Teleng\u00e1s. At the beginning of this century, plunderers from the opposite side of the Wardh\u00e1 constantly overran the pargan\u00e1, and many villages remain desolate to this day.\n\nGh\u00e1ts (meaning etymologically \u2018a pass through a mountain,\u2019 or \u2018landing-stairs from a river;\u2019 in this case the \u2018passes\u2019 or \u2018landing-stairs\u2019 from the coast to the inner plateau).\u2014Two ranges of mountains, forming the eastern and the western walls which support\nthe triangular table-land of Southern India. The Eastern and the Western Gh\u00e1ts pass through many Districts, and their sections are treated in detail in the articles on the Administrative divisions in which they are situated. The present notice of them must therefore be a very general one. **The Eastern Gh\u00e1ts** run in fragmentary spurs and ranges down the Madras side of India, receding inland, and leaving broad tracts between their base and the coast. **The Western Gh\u00e1ts** form the great sea-wall for the Bombay Presidency, with only a narrow strip between them and the shore. At one part they rise in magnificent precipices and headlands out of the ocean, and truly look like colossal 'landing-stairs' from the sea. The Eastern and the Western Gh\u00e1ts meet at an angle near Cape Comorin, and so complete the three sides of the interior table-land. The inner plateau itself lies far below the snow-line, and its ordinary elevation seldom exceeds from 2000 to 3000 feet. Its best known hills are the Nilgiris (Blue Mountains), which contain the summer capital of Madras, Utakamand (Ootacamund), 7000 feet above the sea. The highest point is Dodabetta Peak, 8760 feet, at the southern extremity of Mysore. This wide region of highlands sends its waters chiefly to the eastern coast. The drainage from the north edge of the three-sided table-land falls into the Ganges. The Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) runs along the southern base of the Vindhyas which form that edge, and carries their drainage due west into the Gulf of Cambay. The T\u00e1pti flows almost parallel to the Narbad\u00e1, a little to the southward, and bears to the same gulf the waters from the S\u00e1tpura Hills. But from this point, proceeding southwards, the Western Gh\u00e1ts rise into a high unbroken barrier between the Bombay coast and the waters of the inner table-land. The drainage has therefore to make its way right across India to the eastwards, now twisting round hill ranges, now rushing down the valleys between them, until the rain which the Bombay sea-breeze drops upon the Western Gh\u00e1ts, finally falls into the Bay of Bengal. In this way the three great rivers of the Madras Presidency\u2014namely, the Godavari, Kistna, and Kaveri (Cauvery)\u2014rise in the mountains overhanging the Bombay coast, and traverse the whole breadth of the central table-land before they reach the ocean on the eastern shores of India.\n\nThe entire geography of the two coasts of the Indian Peninsula is determined by the characteristics of these two mountain ranges. On the east, the country is comparatively open, and everywhere accessible to the spread of civilisation. It is here that all the great kingdoms of Southern India have fixed their capitals. Along the west, only a narrow strip of lowland intervenes between the barrier range and the seaboard. The inhabitants are cut off from communication with the interior, and have been left to develop a civilisation of their own. Again, the east coast is a comparatively dry region. Except in the deltas of the great\nrivers, the crops are dependent upon a local rainfall which rarely exceeds 40 inches in the year. The soil is poor, the general elevation high, and the mountains are not profusely covered with forest. In this region the chief aim of the Forest Department is to preserve a sufficient supply of trees for fuel.\n\nOn the west, all these physical conditions are reversed. The rivers are mere hill-torrents, but the south-west monsoon brings an unfailing rainfall in such abundance as to clothe even the hill-slopes with a most luxuriant vegetation. The average fall all along the coast from Kh\u00e1ndesh to Malab\u00e1r reaches 100 inches, and in many exceptional spots high up among the mountains more than 200 inches of rain are registered in every year. What the western coast loses in regular cultivation it gains in the natural wealth of its primeval forests, which display the most magnificent scenery in all India. The mountains of K\u00e1nara, Malab\u00e1r, Mysore, and Coorg furnish the Forest Department with the richest supplies. Along the highest ridges, on both slopes, grow the trees constituting what is technically known as 'the evergreen forest.' Chief among these is the p\u00fan (Calophyllum angustifolium), which often attains the height of 100 feet without branch or bend. No other tree in the world is better suited in every respect for supplying ships' spars and masts. Other timber-trees in this region are the jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), iron-wood (Mesua ferrea), Indian mahogany (Cedrela toona), ebony (Diospyros ebenaster), and champak (Michelia champaca). Interspersed among the tall trees grow an infinite variety of shrubs and creepers, among which latter pepper and cardamoms may be noticed for their commercial value. Farther east, sloping towards the plateau of Mysore, but still within the influence of the south-west monsoon, comes the region of 'deciduous forests,' in which the characteristic trees are blackwood (Dalbergia latifolia), teak (Tectona grandis), sandal-wood (Santalum album), and bamboo.\n\nIn both these forest tracts European enterprise has recently introduced the successful cultivation of coffee. In wild beauty, nothing can surpass the luxuriance of a Coorg forest, as viewed from the summit of one of the peaks of the Western Gh\u00e1ts. A waving sea of green, broken into terraces of varying elevation, extends beneath on every side. North and south run parallel ranges of peaks, wooded almost to the summit; while to the west, many thousand feet below, the view is bounded by the blue line of the Arabian Ocean. Wild animals of all kinds swarm in the jungle, and haunt the grassy glades. Of these the most characteristic are the elephant, the tiger, the still more furious bison, the s\u00e1mbhar deer, and the jungle sheep or ibex.\n\nThe following details must here suffice with regard to the Gh\u00e1ts the reader being referred for further information to the separate articles on the Districts in which they are situated:\u2014\nThe Eastern Ghats commence in Balasor District, Orissa, and form a continuation of the hills which close the south-western side of the Gangetic valley. They pass southwards through the Districts of Cuttack and Puri (in Orissa), enter the Madras Presidency in Ganjam District, and sweep southwards through the Districts of Vizagapatam, Godavari, Nellore, Chengalpat, South Arcot, Trichinopoly, and Tinnevelly. They run at a distance of from 50 to 150 miles from the coast, except in Ganjam and Vizagapatam, where in places they almost abut on the Bay of Bengal. Average elevation, about 1500 feet. Geological formation, granite, gneiss, and mica slate, with clay slate, hornblende, and primitive limestone overlying. 'The surface of the country,' says Thornton, 'appears to consist of the debris of granitic rocks as far north as the Pennar (Ponnaiy\u00e1r), in approaching which, the laterite or iron clay formation expands over a large surface. From the Kistna northwards, the granite is often penetrated by injected veins of trap and dikes of greenstone. Passing on to Vizagapatam and Ganjam, syenite and gneiss predominate, occasionally covered by laterite.'\n\nThe Western Ghats start from the north of the valley of the T\u00e1pti, and run southwards through Kh\u00e1ndesh, N\u00e1sik, Th\u00e1na, Sat\u00e1ra, Ratn\u00e1giri, K\u00e1nara, and Malab\u00e1r, and the Native States of Cochin and Travancore. Length of range from the T\u00e1pti to the P\u00e1lgh\u00e1t gap, 800 miles; south of this pass they run for about 200 miles farther, to Cape Comorin. The coast-line from the sea to their base is generally flat and low, but the hills rise abruptly on the western side to an average height of 3000 feet. On the eastern side, the slope is more gradual. Highest peaks in the northern section\u2014Mah\u00e1baleshwar, 4700 feet; Purandhar, 4472; and Sinhgarh, 4162. South of Mah\u00e1baleshwar, the elevation diminishes to about 1000 feet above sea-level. Farther south the elevation again increases, and attains its maximum towards Coorg, where the highest peaks vary from 5500 to 7000 feet; and where the main range joins the Nilgiris. South of the P\u00e1lgh\u00e1t gap, many peaks rise to the same elevation. 'Geologically,' says Thornton, 'it may be observed generally, that the great core of the Western Ghats is of primary formation, enclosed by alternating strata of more recent origin. These strata, however, have been broken up by prodigious outbursts of volcanic rocks; and from Mah\u00e1baleshwar to the T\u00e1pti, the overlying rock of the Western Ghats is stated to be exclusively of the trap formation. . . . In consequence of the boldness of the declivities and the precipitous character of the faces of the trap rocks, the summits in many parts of the range are nearly inaccessible. The natural strength of these portions has in many instances been increased by art; and the hill forts in all ages of Indian history have been regarded as the bulwarks of the Deccan. The trap formation terminates southward on\nthe sea-coast in about lat. 18\u00b0 N., and is succeeded by laterite. This last-mentioned formation extends southwards as the overlying rock, almost without interruption, to Cape Comorin, covering the base of the mountains and the narrow strip of land that separates them from the sea.'\n\n**Gh\u00e1z\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d.** \u2014 South-western tahsil of Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the parg\u00e1ns of D\u00e1sna, Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Loni, lying along the bank of the river Jumna; traversed by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi, and the East Indian Railways; intersected by the Hindan river, and irrigated by the Ganges and Eastern Jumna Canals. Area, 494 square miles, of which 353 are cultivated. Population (1881) 244,815, namely, males 131,400, and females 113,415. Hindus numbered 190,670; Muhammadans, 53,628; Jains, 256; and 'others,' 261. Land revenue, \u00a339,532; total Government revenue, \u00a343,089; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a378,786; incidence of Government revenue per assessed acre, 2s. 6d. The tahsil or Sub-division contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 7 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1ds); strength of regular police, 94 men; village watchmen (chawkidd\u00e1rs), 597.\n\n**Gh\u00e1z\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d.** \u2014 Town and municipality in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil. Lat. 28\u00b0 39' 55\" N., long. 77\u00b0 28' 10\" E.; distant from Meerut 28 miles southwest. Population (1881) 12,059, namely, Hindus, 8,293; Musalm\u00e1ns, 3,592; Jains, 37; Christians, 130; and 'others,' 7. Area of town site, 102 acres. Has risen greatly in importance of late years, owing to the junction of the East Indian Railway with the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi line at this point. The branch to Delhi also diverges from Gh\u00e1z\u00ed\u00e1b\u00e1d junction. Founded in 1740 by the Wazir Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn, brother of Sal\u00e1bat Jang, ruler of the Deccan, from whom it derived its original name of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn-nagar, shortened to the present form on the opening of the railway. In May 1857, a small British force from Meerut here encountered and defeated the Delhi rebels, who had marched to attack them. Several s\u00e1rd\u00eds, tahsil, school-house, municipal hall, police station, 6 mosques, several Hindu temples (the handsomest known as Mandir Dudheswarn\u00e1th). Numerous barracks, bungalows, and houses for native employ\u00e9s have sprung up in the neighbourhood of the railway station. The town has a rapidly increasing trade, and is now an important grain mart. Weekly market for hides and leather manufactures. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a31057; from taxes, \u00a3763, or 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur.** \u2014 District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 18' 29\" and 26\u00b0 56' N. lat, and between 83\u00b0 21' 26\" and 84\u00b0 0' 7\" E. long. Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur is a District in the Benares Division. It is bounded on the north by Azamgarh; on the west by Benares and Jaunpur; on the south by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d;\nand on the east by Ballia. Area, 1473 square miles; population (1881) 1,014,099 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Gh\u00e1zipur town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Gh\u00e1zipur forms part of the great alluvial plain of the Ganges, stretching in equal portions on either side of the river. The northern part lies between the G\u00famti and the Sarju, whose confluences with the main stream mark its western and eastern limits respectively. The southern tract is a much smaller strip of country, enclosed between the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1 and the great river itself. No hill or natural eminence is to be found within the District on either side; but both north and south of the Ganges the country may be divided into an upland and a low-lying tract. The higher land consists of the ancient alluvial bed, deposited at some very early period by the vast streams which carried down toward the sea the detritus of the Him\u00e1layan range. Through this elevated plateau, the modern rivers at a later date have cut for themselves broad channels, flooded at certain periods of the year, but forming the low-lying tilth in the harvest season. The process of denudation still goes on with every inundation, and the upland slopes are gradually diminishing in extent under the erosive action of the torrents. The principal rivers are the Ganges, Sarju, G\u00famti, and Mangai. The first three are permanent streams, which flow during the dry season in narrow channels, cut through their own alluvial deposits. A few lakes are scattered over the District, formed where a river has deserted its former channel, and a bank of silt has dammed up the abandoned bed. The soil in many portions of the upland shows a tendency to develop the noxious saline efflorescence known as reh, the frequency of which is increased by the obstruction to drainage arising from the cultivation of rice. With this exception, however, the greater part of Gh\u00e1zipur is fertile and fully cultivated. Game is comparatively scarce, owing to the general prevalence of tillage; and deer, which prove so destructive to the standing crops in neighbouring Districts, are here almost unknown.\n\nHistory.\u2014Tradition refers the foundation of the city of Gh\u00e1zipur to a mythical hero, R\u00e1j\u00e1 G\u00e1dh, who is said to have called his stronghold G\u00e1dhipur. The name, however, as will be presently proved, is of Musalm\u00e1n origin, and, in fact, the town was not really founded until the 14th century A.D. Nevertheless, the District can boast a long history of its own, stretching far back into the earliest days of Aryan colonization. Carved monoliths bear witness to a very ancient Hindu civilisation; and one in particular, at Bhitri, contains an inscription of Samudra Gupta, who probably reigned over the surrounding country as far as Kanauj about the end of the 4th century A.D. Indeed, the monuments found in Gh\u00e1zipur have been of inestimable value in\nenabling us to unravel the intricate history of the Ganges valley before the advent of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The result of late investigations, as applied to these remains, may thus be briefly summarized. At the time of S\u00e1kya Muni (Buddha), 550 B.C., the country from Sayyidpur to Baxar was already the seat of a civilised Aryan nationality, whose metropolis was situated near the former town, where numerous ruins and architectural remains of the earliest age are still found. The country embraced the religion of the new teacher, and formed a portion of the Buddhist Empire under Asoka, who reigned about 250 B.C. Asoka erected here one of his well-known pillars, and at least two stupas. From the 4th to the 7th century of our era, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur was included in the territories of the Gupta dynasty of Magadha, in whose columns and coins the District is unusually rich. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese pilgrim, about 630 A.D., found this tract inhabited by a mixed population of Buddhists and Hindus. He visited a monastery built by Asoka, and mentions many other buildings, whose sites have been identified with a high degree of probability. After the extirpation of Buddhism by Br\u00e1hmanism in Northern India, the aborigines appear to have recovered these regions from their Aryan lords, who were perhaps weakened by internecine religious strife.\n\nIn the interval between the Gupta monarchy and the Muhammadan conquest, an age of darkness supervenes, during which Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur was apparently in the hands of Bhar chieftains. The ancient Aryan civilisation would seem to have been utterly trampled out, as no great monuments or architectural remains mark this intermediate period. But just before the Musalm\u00e1n inroads, the Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs from the north and west, driven from their own homes by the advancing wave of Isl\u00e1m, moved eastward to occupy the neglected tracts which had fallen for awhile into the hands of the indigenous races. The descendants of this second Aryan colony form the modern landowning class of the District; but they have no traditions with respect to their predecessors, and attribute the ancient monuments of their fellow-tribesmen to the Bhar R\u00e1j\u00e1s, whom their fathers found in possession of the soil. The R\u00e1jput settlers, however, did not long enjoy their independence in the new home to which they had migrated. The aggressive Muhammadan power followed eastward close upon their heels. In 1193, Behar and the middle Ganges valley were conquered by Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, the general of Muhammad Ghori, first Musalm\u00e1n Emperor of Delhi. He had defeated and slain the Hindu champion, Jai Ch\u00e1nd, Rahtor R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares and Kanauj, in the Jumna ravines of \u00c9t\u00e1wah; and the whole country as far as Bengal lay at the feet of the conqueror. During the succeeding century we hear little of the present District; but about the year 1330, the city of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur was founded (according to a probable tradition) by a Sayyid chief named Mas\u00e1\u00fad, who slew the\nlocal Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 in battle. Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Tughlak thereupon granted him the estates of his conquered enemy, with the title of Gh\u00e1st, or 'Champion of the Faith,' which gave the name to the newly-founded city. From 1394 to 1476, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur was incorporated in the dominions of the Sharki dynasty of Jaunpur, who maintained their independence for nearly a century as rival to the Lodhi rulers of Delhi. After their fall, it was reunited to the dominions of the Western Sult\u00e1ns, and was conquered, like the surrounding country, by the Mughal Emperor B\u00e1bar in 1526. In 1539, however, the southern border of the District was the scene of a decisive engagement between the Afgh\u00e1n Prince Sher Sh\u00e1h and Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, the son of B\u00e1bar, at Baxar, just within the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d border, in which the latter was utterly defeated and driven out of the country.\n\nSher Sh\u00e1h's victory settled the fate of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur for the next twenty years. It remained in the undisturbed possession of the Afgh\u00e1ns, not only through the reigns of the three intrusive emperors belonging to the dynasty of S\u00far, but throughout the restored supremacy of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan. It was not till the third year of Akbar that Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur was recovered for the Mughal throne by Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n, Governor of Jaunpur, from whom the town of Zam\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 derives its name. After his rebellion and death in 1566, the District was thoroughly united to the Delhi Empire, and organized under the subah of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. During the palmy days of Akbar's successors, the annals of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur are purely formal and administrative, until the rise of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs of Oudh at the beginning of the last century. In 1722, Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n made himself practically independent as Viceroy of Oudh: About 1748, he appointed Shaikh Abdull\u00e1, a native of the District who had fled from the service of the Governor of Patn\u00e1, to the command of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur. Abdull\u00e1 has left his mark in the city by his splendid buildings, the chief of which, now in ruins, is known as the Palace of the Forty Pillars. He also constructed a garden, the Naw\u00e1b's B\u00e1gh, near which he was buried under a handsome mausoleum. His son Fazl Ali succeeded him, but, after various vicissitudes, was expelled by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Balwant Singh of Benares. Balwant Singh died in 1770, but the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr permitted his illegitimate son, Chait Singh, to inherit his title and principality. In 1775, the suzerainty of the Benares Province was ceded to the British by the Waz\u00edr Asaf-ul-daul\u00e1. The new Government continued Chait Singh in his fief until the year 1781, when he was deposed by Warren Hastings. From this final introduction of the British rule till the Mutiny, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur enjoyed undisturbed peace.\n\nIn 1805, Lord Cornwallis died here, and a monument, with a marble tomb adorned with a statue by Flaxman, was erected to his memory. In 1857, order was preserved till the mutiny at Azamgarh became known, on 3rd June. The fugitives from Azamgarh arrived on that\nday, and local outbreaks took place. The 65th Native Infantry, however, remained staunch, and 100 European troops on their way to Benares were detained, so that order was tolerably re-established by the 16th June. No further disturbance occurred till the news of the Dinapur mutiny arrived on the 27th of July. The 65th then stated their intention of joining Ku\u00e1r Singh's force; but after the rebel defeat at Arrah, they were quietly disarmed, and some European troops were stationed at Gh\u00e1zipur. No difficulties arose till the siege of Azamgarh was raised in April, when the rebels came flying down the Gogra and across the Ganges to Arrah. The disorderly element again rose, and by the end of June the eastern half of the District was utterly disorganised. In July 1858, a force was sent to Ballia which drove the rebels out of the Do\u00e1b, while another column cleared all the pargan\u00e1s north of the Ganges. The pargan\u00e1s south of the river remained in rebellion till the end of October, when troops were sent across which expelled the rebels and completely restored order.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Gh\u00e1zipur is one of the numerous Districts which, after suffering a loss of population about the middle of the present century, has partially recovered its lost ground of late years. In 1853 the total number of inhabitants was returned at 1,596,324. In 1865 it had sunk to 1,342,455, showing a decrease of 253,869 persons, or 16 per cent., in spite of an intermediate enlargement of its area by 41 square miles. By 1872, however, although 55 square miles of territory had been transferred to other Districts, the population had risen again to a total of 1,345,570, which showed an increase of 3115 persons, or 2 per cent., although, allowing for the present further decreased area, the population in 1872 was but 873,299. By 1881 the population had increased to 1,014,099, being 140,800, or 16\u00b71 per cent., over the population in the same area in 1872. The statistics of density display these changes even more conspicuously and truthfully than a mere enumeration upon a constantly-shifting area. The Census of 1853 gave an average of 732 persons to the square mile; that of 1865 showed only 604 to the square mile; while that of 1872 disclosed a density of 621 to the square mile, and that of 1881, 688 to the square mile. The enumeration of 1881 was taken over an area of 1473 square miles, and it returned a total population of 1,014,099 persons, distributed among 2606 villages or towns, and inhabiting 166,789 houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 688; villages per square mile, 1\u00b77; houses per square mile, 113; persons per village, 389; persons per house, 6\u00b70.\n\nClassified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 507,117; females, 506,982; proportion of males, 50\u00b70 per cent. As regards religion, Gh\u00e1zipur contains about the average proportion of Hindus and Muhammadans which is found throughout the North-Western Pro-\nvinces. The Census showed 913,764 adherents of the Hindu faith, or 90.1 per cent., as against 99,678 Musalmans, or 9.8 per cent. There were also 648 Christians, 8 Jews, and 1 Parsi. The higher Hindu castes were returned as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hman, 67,840; R\u00e1jput, 91,675; K\u00e1yasth, 15,421; and Baniy\u00e1, 4251. The lower castes are represented by the Ah\u00edr, cattle breeders, milkmen, and cultivators, 154,246, the most numerous caste in the District; Cham\u00e1r, leather-workers, labourers, etc., 130,716; Kachhi, cultivators and gardeners, 77,262; Bhuinh\u00e1r, landholders and cultivators, 47,181; Bhar, the early aboriginal rulers of the country, now cultivators and labourers, 43,846; Kah\u00e1r, cultivators, palanquin-bearers, and domestic servants, 35,989; Teli, oil-makers, 22,478; Loh\u00e1r, blacksmiths, 21,419; Lon\u00eda, salt-workers by hereditary occupation, but now spadesmen and field labourers, 18,633; Kumbhar, potters, 14,247; Mallah, boatmen, 14,029; Kalw\u00e1r, distillers, 13,239; K\u00farm\u00ed, landholders and cultivators, 10,023; Gadari\u00e1, shepherds, 8554; N\u00e1i, barbers, 8536; Son\u00e1r, goldsmiths, 7813; Dhobi, washermen, 7079; and Tambul\u00ed, betel-leaf sellers, 6269. Amongst the Musalmans, the Sunnis numbered 96,787; and the Shi\u00e1s, 2891.\n\nThe panch\u00e1yats, or caste guilds, have here as elsewhere very much the practical effect of trades-unions; and they also regulate matters of social arrangement, petty debt, occupancy of land, and domestic questions generally. The District is permanently assessed, and both landowners and cultivators are richer and more independent than in the country farther west. In the poorer parts, the peasantry are generally in debt; but in the more fertile tracts, where they have mostly rights of occupancy, they are well-to-do, and are (perhaps in consequence) the most litigious community in the North-Western Provinces. There are seven towns in the District with a population (1881) exceeding 5000 souls\u2014namely, GHAZIPUR, 32,885; GAHMAR, 10,443; RIOTIPUR, 10,297; SHERPUR, 9030; NARHI, 5415; ZAMANIA, 5116; and BAHADURGANJ, 5007. These give a total urban population of 78,193 souls, leaving the remainder, 935,906, as forming the village and rural population. Of the 2606 towns and villages in the District in 1881, 1300 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 726 from two to five hundred, 385 from five hundred to a thousand, 145 from one to two thousand, 28 from two to three thousand, 11 from three to five thousand, 8 from five to ten thousand (including scattered hamlets attached to four villages), 2 from ten to fifteen thousand, and 1 over thirty thousand. As regards occupation, the Census Report classified the male population into the following six groups:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil and military, all Government employ\u00e9s, and the learned professions, 6865; (2) domestic servants, board and lodging-house keepers, 1859; (3) commercial, including\nmerchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 9585; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 236,517; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 54,230; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 14,026 labourers and 184,035 male children or persons of unspecified occupation), 193,061.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The greater portion of the cultivable soil in Gh\u00e1zipur is already fully tilled, there being a total of 1006 square miles under cultivation, with an available margin of only 132 square miles. The black earth called kardil, resembling the m\u0101r of Bundelkhand, is common in the lowlands and in the plateau south of the Ganges. It produces a good spring crop without irrigation, but its character is much improved if sand is spread over the surface; otherwise it is liable to dry up into deeply-fissured masses of hardened clay. In all the Gangetic lowland, the upper layer of a well-raised tract always consists of alluvial mould; but the sub-soil is sandy. The rivers which have had the longest course from the hills, deposit mud; the others leave behind them beds of sand; but the Ganges forms alternate layers of each. Hence a flood from the Sarju is injurious to the fields, while an inundation of the Ganges benefits the crops. The harvests are those common to the whole north-western plain. The khartf crops are sown after the first rains in June, and reaped in October or November. The early rice, however, is sometimes harvested as soon as the end of August, while cotton is not ready for picking till February. The other autumn staples are the millets b\u00e1jra and jodr, and moth. The rabi or spring crops are sown in October or November, and reaped in March or April. They consist of wheat, barley, oats, vetch, and pulses. Manure is used, where it can be obtained, for both harvests; and land is allowed to lie fallow whenever the cultivator can afford it. As a rule, spring and autumn crops are not taken off the same land, but sometimes a plot of early rice is reaped in August or September, and a second crop of some kind is sown in its place for the spring harvest. If rain is delayed beyond the 20th June, this keeps back the sowing and endangers the yield of the early autumn crops.\n\nAt the Land Settlement of Gh\u00e1zipur District, made in 1789, and subsequently declared permanent, fraternities or brotherhoods belonging to various Hindu and Muhammadan tribes were recognised by Government, in the great majority of cases, as the owners of the soil. The settlements were concluded with a few head-men on each estate, who were the representatives of the whole community. In some cases, by accident rather than by design, the head-man of a proprietary community was treated as sole owner. In no instance did Government admit the existence of any divided ownership, or of superior and inferior proprietary rights. No tal\u00fakd\u00e1rs were therefore recognised, though there were immense taluks, or single estates formed of many villages, held by brotherhoods of shareholders. A detailed record of the rights\nof ownership of the various shareholders was not attempted till 1840. Meanwhile, estates were sold for arrears of revenue; and, till after the Land Act of 1859, the purchasers were constantly at law with the old landowners, who rented and cultivated the fields they formerly possessed. The adult male agriculturists in the District in 1881 numbered 235,971, cultivating an average of 2.73 acres each. The total agricultural population dependent on the soil, however, was 726,369, or 71.62 per cent. of the District population. Of the 1,473 square miles of area, 1,470 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of this, 1,006 square miles are under cultivation, 131.5 square miles are available for cultivation, and 332.5 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3129,963, or an average of 4s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3223,254, or an average of 6s. 11d. per acre. Wages ordinarily rule as follows:\u2014Coolies and unskilled labourers, 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. per diem; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bdd. to 3d. per diem; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s. per diem. Women are paid about one-fifth less than men, while boys and girls get from one-half to one-third the wages of adults. Agricultural hands are most frequently paid in grain. In villages, payments for labour are made daily. The following were the average prices-current of food-grains in 1883:\u2014Wheat, 18 sers per rupee, or 6s. 3d. per cwt.; best rice, 11 sers per rupee, or 10s. 2d. per cwt.; common rice, 16\u00be sers per rupee, or 6s. 9d. per cwt.; jodr, 32\u00be sers per rupee, or 3s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt.; bajra, 27\u00be sers per rupee, or 4s. 0\u00bdd. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is not specially subject to flood, drought, or blight, and it has suffered from no great famine during the present century. It possesses ample means of external communication in the rivers Ganges and Gumti, the East Indian Railway, and the branch railway from Dildarnagar to the bank of the Ganges opposite Ghazipur town. In 1783, severe scarcity occurred from the failure of the rains in the previous year, but there were no deaths from famine as far as known. In 1803, the rice crop was destroyed and the spring harvest endangered. In 1837\u201338, there was again a scarcity, but no actual famine occurred. There were also partial droughts in 1859\u201360, 1864\u201365, and 1865\u201366, besides floods in 1871\u201372. Another scarcity occurred in 1868\u201369, when only 21 inches of rain fell in twelve months. The greater part of the autumn and about half the spring crops were lost, and severe distress resulted. Relief operations were set on foot, and continued from June to September 1869, but no actual deaths from famine occurred. The last year of scarcity was 1878, when prices rose very high owing to the scanty rainfall of 1877, and Government relief works were necessary from June to August 1878.\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The chief imports into the District are English piece-goods and yarn, cotton, salt, spices, and grain. The principal exports are country cloth, sugar, fuller's earth, oil-seeds, and hides. The head-quarters of the Government Opium Department for the North-Western Provinces are at Gh\u00e1zipur. The poppy has been cultivated in India since the 16th century; and when the English first acquired the Benares Province, they farmed the monopoly to contractors. In 1797, an opium agent was appointed for Benares, but natives still managed the manufacture, and were paid by commission. In 1852, Lord Dalhousie introduced the present system. There are 10 deputies under the agent, and each of these has one or two European assistants. The 10 divisions are again sub-divided into 39 offices, each supervised by a native overseer. Licences are granted and advances made to the cultivators, who in return engage to place a certain amount of land under opium. After the fields are sown, they are measured carefully, and estimates made of the quantity of opium which each cultivator ought to produce. In March and April the opium is collected and brought to the factory, where it is weighed, and its consistence is tested, before the cultivator is paid for it. The amount disbursed in working expenses at the Gh\u00e1zipur factory is about \u00a310,000 per annum. The opium is classified according to its consistence, and is then made up into special balls, which are packed in boxes and despatched to Calcutta for sale by auction. Carbonate of soda is manufactured from the reh or saline efflorescence of the barren \u00fasar plains, and exported to Calcutta. Saltpetre is also largely prepared from the same source. The pargan\u00e1s south of the Ganges are traversed by the East Indian Railway for a length of 24 miles; there are three stations within the District\u2014at Zam\u00e1ni\u00e1, Dild\u00e1rnagar, and Gahmar. Three stations in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District are also situated within easy distances from portions of Gh\u00e1zipur. A branch State line has been constructed from Dild\u00e1rnagar to Tari-gh\u00e1t opposite Gh\u00e1zipur town, and is worked by the East Indian Railway. Total length of railways, 35 miles. Much of the heavy commerce of the District is still conveyed by the Ganges. Good roads, to the length of 568 miles, of which 112 miles are metalled, connect all the principal centres with one another and with the adjacent towns. A bathing fair is held on the full moon of K\u00e1rtik, in October, at Chochakpur, which attracts some 10,000 visitors.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary District staff consists of a Collector-Magistrate, a Joint Magistrate, and 3 Deputy Magistrates. Gh\u00e1zipur is the seat of a Civil and Sessions Judge, who is also Judge of Balli\u00e1. The whole amount of revenue raised in the District, for imperial, municipal, or local purposes, amounted in 1882\u201383 to \u00a3140,000, being at the rate of 2s. 9d. per head of the population. In the same year, the\ntotal strength of the regular police force was 392 officers and men, besides a municipal or town police of 161 men; the cost of their maintenance was returned at \u00a35799, of which \u00a34793 was paid from Provincial sources, and \u00a31006 from municipal funds. These figures show 1 policeman to every 2'7 square miles of the area, and to every 1834 of the population. The District jail is at Gh\u00e1zipur town. In 1882 it contained a daily average of 459 prisoners, of whom 34 were females. The District possesses 17 imperial and 1 local post-office; and telegraph offices are connected with each of the stations on the East Indian Railway. Education was carried on in 1882-83 in 150 Government-inspected schools, with a total roll of 5524 scholars, being an average of 1 school to every 9'8 square miles, and 5 scholars per thousand of the population. This is exclusive of unaided schools, for which no returns are available. The Census Report in 1881 returned 5870 boys and 200 girls as under instruction, besides 24,489 males and 456 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. For fiscal purposes, Gh\u00e1zipur is sub-divided into 4 tahsils and 13 pargans. The District contains only one municipality, that of Gh\u00e1zipur town.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014Gh\u00e1zipur is one of the hottest and dampest Districts in the North-Western Provinces. In 1869, the mean annual temperature was 80\u00b0 F.; the lowest monthly mean was 61\u00b0 in January, and the highest 98\u00b0 in May. The average annual rainfall for the thirty years ending 1881 was 37'99 inches; during this period, the maximum was 50'5 inches in 1861, and the minimum was 21'5 inches in 1868. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 was 31,877, or 32'49 per thousand of the population. There are 3 dispensaries in the District, at Gh\u00e1zipur, Sayyidpur, and P\u00edrnagar. During the year 1882 they afforded relief to 24,393 persons, of whom 689 were in-door and 23,704 out-door patients.\n\nGh\u00e1zipur.\u2014Central tahsil of Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the north bank of the Ganges. Area, 440 square miles, of which 264 square miles are cultivated, 73 square miles cultivable, and 103 square miles uncultivable waste. Population (1881) 332,408, namely, males 168,751, and females 163,657. Hindus numbered 299,770; Muhammadans, 32,244; and 'others,' 394; land revenue, \u00a332,118; total Government revenue, \u00a335,604; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a371,870; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. 3\u00bdd. per acre. In 1883 the tahsil contained 4 civil and 8 criminal courts, with 7 police circles (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 95 men; village watchmen (chaukiddrs), 745.\n\nGh\u00e1zipur.\u2014City, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the low alluvial northern bank of the Ganges, 44 miles north-east of Benares.\nLat. 25\u00b0 35' 0\" N., long. 83\u00b0 38' 7\" E. Population (1881) 32,885, namely, males 15,961, and females 16,924. Hindus numbered 21,824; Muhammadans, 11,047; and Christians, 14. Founded, according to Hindu tradition, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 G\u00e1dh, an eponymous hero, from whom it took the name of G\u00e1dhipur: according to Muhammadan history, by the Sayyid chief Mas\u00e1\u00fad, about the year 1330, from whose title of M\u00e1lik-us-Sa\u00e1dat Gh\u00e1zi the city really derives its name. For later history and Mutiny narrative, see GHAZIPUR DISTRICT. The city stretches along the bank of the Ganges for nearly two miles, with a breadth from north to south of about three-quarters of a mile. Palace of the Forty Pillars, built by Shaikh Abdull\u00e1, governor under the Oudh viceroys, now lies in ruins. Tombs of Mas\u00e1\u00fad, Abdull\u00e1, and Fazl Al\u00ed also adorn the city. Monument to Lord Cornwallis, who died here in 1805, consisting of a domed quasi-Grecian building, with a marble statue by Flaxman. Trade in sugar, tobacco, coarse long-cloth, and rose-water. Head-quarters of the Government Opium Department, where all the opium from the North-Western Provinces is collected and manufactured under a monopoly. Two weekly vernacular newspapers are published in the town. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a32962; from taxes, \u00a32439, or 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population (43,232) within municipal limits.\n\nGh\u00e1z\u00edpur.\u2014Central southern tashil of Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the north bank of the Jumna, and consisting of the parg\u00e1ns of Ayah Sah, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur, and Muta\u00far.

Population (1881) 2134, chiefly R\u00e1jputs. Said to have been founded in 1691 by Araru Singh, the ancestor of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Asothar. The fort here was the chief stronghold of the family. Police station and post-office.\n\nGh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn-nagar.\u2014Town in Meerut District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See GHAZIABAD.\n\nGharm\u00ed.\u2014Town and fortress in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; situated on the left bank of the river of the same name, 85 miles south-west of K\u00e1bul, 233 miles north-east of Kandah\u00e1r, 145 miles north-east of Kalat-i-Ghilzai, 264 miles west of Koh\u00e1t by Kuram, 283 miles north-west of Der\u00e1 Ismail Kh\u00e1n by the Gumal road, and 295 miles north-east of Quetta. Lat. 33\u00b0 34' N., long 68\u00b0 19' E. The town may be described as an irregular square, each side averaging 500 yards. Its circumference\nwas measured in 1880, and was found, excluding the citadel, to be 2175 yards. The citadel and town are thus described by Captain Larminie, a member of Sir D. Stewart's staff, who wrote in 1880:\n\n'With a few slight exceptions, nothing whatever either in the shape of repairs or new buildings appears to have been done since the date of our last occupancy, nearly forty years ago; hence the whole has fallen into a state of ruin and decay. A ruined citadel, broken and useless parapets, cracked and tumble-down towers, crumbling curtain walls, and a silted-up ditch, are all that remain of the once famous stronghold of Ghazni.' The town is surrounded by a high wall, and flanked at irregular intervals by towers. The city itself is composed of dirty irregular streets of houses, several storeys high, and will not bear comparison with either K\u00e1b\u00fal or Kandah\u00e1r. The houses are built of mud, and variously estimated at from 900 to 3500; the inhabitants are composed principally of Afgh\u00e1ns, about 200 families of Haz\u00e1ra labourers, and about 150 Hindu shopkeepers, bankers, and traders, the latter paying a small tax as infidels. With the exception of poshtins (sheepskin coats) there are no manufactures. Ghazn\u00ed is celebrated for its apricots, apples and melons, which go to K\u00e1b\u00fal in large quantities.\n\nThe climate of Ghazn\u00ed, for several months of the year, is extremely cold, and snow lies on the ground from November to March. In summer it is not so hot as K\u00e1b\u00fal or Kandah\u00e1r, but at that season there are constant dust-storms. Three miles to the north-east of Ghazn\u00ed are the ruins of the old city, destroyed in the middle of the 12th century by the Prince of Ghor, who, however, spared the tomb of the renowned Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed. The citadel is situated at the north angle of the town, and commands the city completely. Ghazn\u00ed was captured by Sir John Keane's force during the first Afgh\u00e1n war, being carried by storm on the 23rd July 1839. At the time of the Afgh\u00e1n rising in 1841, the citadel was garrisoned by the 27th Bengal Native Infantry. The place was besieged by the Afgh\u00e1ns, and the garrison forced to retire to the citadel. The little force held out, after suffering great privations, from November 1841 till the 6th March 1842, when, their supply of water failing, they were forced to evacuate the fort, and afterwards to surrender to the Afgh\u00e1n chief. The officers were brutally treated, and the Sepoys either sold into slavery or murdered. In September 1842, General Nott recaptured Ghazn\u00ed. The citadel was destroyed before the withdrawal of General Nott's army to India. During the Afgh\u00e1n War of 1879\u201380, Ghazn\u00ed was twice visited by a British force, namely, in April 1880 by Sir Donald Stewart, when marching from Kandah\u00e1r to K\u00e1b\u00fal, and in August of the same year by Sir Frederick Roberts, when returning from K\u00e1b\u00fal to Kandah\u00e1r. On the former occasion an unimportant engagement\nwith the Afgh\u00e1ns took place at Arzu, 6 miles south-east of Ghazn\u00ed. Ghazn\u00ed lies beyond British India, and does not, therefore, come within the strict scope of this work. But its former importance as a great military centre on the north-western frontier deserves a passing word. It gave its name to the founder of the Musalm\u00e1n Empire of India, and Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed (997-1030) was only the forerunner of a long series of invaders who streamed eastwards over the passes from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.\n\n**Gheri\u00e1.**\u2014Town and fort in Ratn\u00e1g\u00edrl District, Bombay Presidency. \u2014See VIJAIADRUG.\n\n**Gheri\u00e1.**\u2014Small town to the south of S\u00fati, Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 30' 15\" N., long 88\u00b0 8' 15\" E. Famous as the scene of two important battles\u2014the first in 1740, when the Naw\u00e1b \u00c1lf Vard\u00ed Kh\u00e1n defeated Sarfar\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, his rival for the government of Bengal; the second in 1763, when M\u00edr K\u00e1sim, Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, after declaring war upon the East India Company, was finally defeated and the throne bestowed for the second time upon M\u00edr Jafar.\n\n**Ghes.**\u2014Estate or zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces, about 43 miles west of Sambalpur. Population (1881) 7030, residing in 25 villages, on an area of 30 square miles, of which three-fifths are cultivated, chiefly with rice. The principal village, Ghes, situated in lat. 21\u00b0 11' 30\" N., long. 83\u00b0 20' E., contains a population (1881) of 979. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r's family are Banj\u00e1ras. The estate occupies a small tract in the south-west corner of the District, and is much overrun by scrub-jungle, and the soil is inferior. The population is mainly agricultural, composed of Banj\u00e1ras, and aboriginal Gonds and Kandhs. A few Kalit\u00e1 families hold the best villages. Staple products, rice and oil-seeds. Only 4 villages contain a population of between 500 and 1000, the remainder having less than 500. The estate is said to have been granted to an ancestor of the present family by the Sambalpur R\u00e1j\u00e1 two centuries ago, free of rent, but subject to a light tribute. In 1857, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r joined in the rebellion of Surendra Sah, but was pardoned under the amnesty of 1858. He was afterwards, however, convicted of harbouring proclaimed rebels, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He died in jail, and was succeeded by his son Ujal Singh, who still (1883) holds the estate.\n\n**Ghodbandar.**\u2014See GHORBANDAR.\n\n**Ghogh\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Goco.\n\n**Ghogh\u00e1ro.**\u2014Town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.

Agb\u00e1 fell on the field, where his tomb may still be seen; and hard by is the 'Ghor\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t,' so called from B\u00e1gb\u00e1's fabled leap across the\nWardh\u00e1. On the bank of this river, between Ghugus and Ch\u00e1ndur, a seam of coal, 33 feet thick, crops out on the surface, and is estimated to cover 3 square miles. An experimental shaft was sunk, but has now been abandoned.\n\n**Ghusal.**\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, across the range of the Him\u00e1layas which forms the southern boundary of Kun\u00e1war. Lat. 31\u00b0 21' N., long. 78\u00b0 13' E. Two other passes, the Gun\u00e1 and the N\u00edtrang, lie within half a mile to the north-west; but Thornton states that only one of the three is ever practicable at any particular season. They lead from Sangla to Chu\u00e1ra. Elevation above sea-level, 15,851 feet.\n\n**Ghusri.**\u2014Village in Howrah District, Bengal. Manufacture of *dhut\u00eds* and *s\u00e1ris* carried on according to European methods. Permanent market, with large trade in agricultural products.\n\n**Ghutas\u00e1n Dev\u00ed.**\u2014Hill pass in Sirmur (Sarmor) State, Punjab, lying over the crest of a low transverse ridge, which runs across the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan from the sub-Him\u00e1layan chain to the Siw\u00e1liks. Lat. 30\u00b0 31' N., long. 77\u00b0 28' E. Thornton says that the ridge divides the waters of the Bhuta, a tributary of the Jumna, from those of the Markanda, flowing south-west toward the Sutlej. The route from Dehr\u00e1 to Nah\u00e1n runs through this pass. Elevation above sea-level, 2500 feet.\n\n**Ghw\u00e1l\u00e1ri.**\u2014A pass leading from Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n to the Der\u00e1j\u00e1t in the Punjab, across the Sulaim\u00e1n range; much frequented by the Povindah traders on their journeys from K\u00e1b\u00fal and Kandah\u00e1r to the Punjab. This route should be termed Gomal rather than Ghw\u00e1l\u00e1ri, the latter name being properly applicable only to a pass at the east end of the defile. Water and forage abundant; the former in one or two places is, however, brackish.\u2014See GOMAL.\n\n**Gidhaur.**\u2014Town in Monghyr District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 51' 20\" N., long. 86\u00b0 14' 25\" E. Station on the East Indian Railway. The site of a deserted hill frontier town, and interesting as the seat of one of the oldest of the noble families of Behar. In the neighbourhood are the ruins of an ancient castle, the erection of which is often attributed to Sher Sh\u00e1h, but it is probably of much earlier origin. The Gidhaur family, which now after twenty-two generations is still wealthy and influential, was founded about 1066 A.D. by B\u00edr Vikram Singh, a R\u00e1jput of the Chandrabans\u00ed or Lunar sept. Puran Mall, the roth R\u00e1j\u00e1, built the great temple of BAIDYANATH; and in the Sanskrit verse inscribed above the inner door of the sanctuary he is called *ure pati*, or 'king of men,' a title that bears witness to the position of the family centuries ago. Sir J\u00e1i Mangal, who has lately died, was created a Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1865, and a Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1866, in consequence of his loyal exertions on our behalf during the Sant\u00e1l Rebellion of 1855 and the Mutiny of 1857.\nGidhaur Gala.\u2014Pass in Peshawar District, Punjab, lying on the old road from Peshawar to Attock, 5 miles north-west of the latter town. Lat. $33^\\circ 56'$ N., long. $72^\\circ 12'$ E. Derives its name ('the Jackal's alley or lane') from its extreme narrowness, being not more than 10 or 12 feet wide, and bounded on either side by considerable hills. Its military importance is slight, from the facility with which it may be turned.\n\nGidu-jo-Tando.\u2014Town in Haidarabad (Hyderabad) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Latitude $25^\\circ 22' 15''$ N., longitude $68^\\circ 21'$ E. Population (1881) under 2000. Situated on the Indus, and connected by a fine road, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length, with the city of Haidarabad, in which municipality it is included. Large transit trade, chiefly in cotton and grain. A steam ferry connects Gidu-jo-Tando with the railway station of Kotri on the opposite bank of the Indus.\n\nGigasaran.\u2014Petty State in South Kathiawar, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 4 independent tribute-payers. Population (1881) 632. Lies 24 miles south of Kunkawav station on the Bhaunagar-Gondal railway. Estimated revenue, \u00a3500. The tribute due is paid by Amreli in lieu of certain villages taken possession of by that State.\n\nGijgarh.\u2014Town in the Native State of Jaipur (Jeypore), Rajputana. Population (1881) 5171, namely, 4932 Hindus, 127 Muhammadans, and 112 'others.'\n\nGilgaon.\u2014Ancient estate or zamindari in Chandia District, Central Provinces; area, 60 square miles, with 14 villages or hamlets, and 235 occupied houses. Population (1881) 1211. Most of the area is covered by hill and forest, the latter containing some good timber, mostly sal and bijesal. Gilgaon village is situated in lat. $20^\\circ 0' 30''$ N., long. $80^\\circ 5' 30''$ E. Population (1881) 503.\n\nGilghit.\u2014Valley and district in Kashmir State, Punjab, lying on the southern slope of the Hindu Kush, or perhaps more correctly the Himalayas, between Baltistan and Yasin. The town of Gilghit, which gives its present name to the valley, lies in latitude $35^\\circ 55'$ N., longitude $74^\\circ 22'$ E. The river Yasin or Gilghit traverses the centre of the valley, and finally joins the Indus six miles north of the village of Binji, Bunji, or as the Sikhs call it, Bawanji. Binji was at one time a flourishing settlement with 8 forts, but was almost ruined in the course of a war, undertaken by the rulers of Yasin and Chitral, which led to the Sikh occupation of the valley of Gilghit. The lower part of the valley of the Gilghit river, nearly 40 miles in length, forms the Gilghit district. The town of Gilghit is distant 24 miles from the Indus, with an elevation above sea-level of 4890 feet, a central position, good climate, and a considerable extent of fertile land.\n\nThe ancient name of the place was Sargin; later the name of Gilit\nwas given to it, and this was changed to Gilghit by its Sikh conquerors; among the inhabitants it is still known as Gilit or Sargin-Gilit. The settled population of the Gilghit district, which is very mixed, amounts to about 4500. The language spoken is Shina, though the Shins are numerically inferior to the rest of the population. The former rulers had the title of R\u00e1, and there is reason to suppose that they were at one time Hindus, but for the last five and a half centuries they have been Muhammadans. The names of the Hindu R\u00e1s, who were also called Sh\u00e1hrefs, have been lost, with the exception of the last of their number, Sr\u00ed Baddat; and tradition relates that he was killed by a Muhammadan adventurer, who married his daughter and founded a new dynasty called Trakhan\u00e9. The present holder of the title of R\u00e1 is Alid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, who belongs properly to the ruling family of Nagar, but was installed as representative of the Trakhan\u00e9 on account of his descent from that family through his mother.\n\nThe population of the Gilghit valley must at one time have been large, as traces of cultivated terraces high up on the mountain-sides to an elevation of 10,000 feet distinctly prove; and the period of greatest prosperity was probably under the Shin R\u00e1s. According to tradition, Sr\u00ed Baddat\u2019s rule extended over Chitr\u00e1l, Yass\u00edn, Tangir, Darel, Chil\u00e1s, Gor, Astor, Hanza, Nagar, and Haramosh. A glance at the map will show that the Gilghit country is situated in the centre of the most mountainous region of the Him\u00e1layas. Nowhere else in the world, probably, is there to be found so great a number of deep valleys and lofty mountains in so small an area. Within a radius of 65 miles from Gilghit town, the survey maps show, amidst innumerable smaller peaks, eleven varying from 18,000 to 20,000 feet, seven from 20,000 to 22,000 feet, six from 22,000 to 24,000 feet, and eight from 24,000 to 26,000 feet, while half of the tract thus included still remains to be surveyed. A rival to Mount Everest and K\u00e1nchanjanga may yet be found among the lofty mountains of these parts.\n\nFrom Gilghit mountain roads radiate into all the surrounding valleys, and its position in the centre of the valley shows how favourable it is for the establishment of the head-quarters of a confederacy of small States. The lofty mountains around it, though barren and rocky at their bases, are covered with verdure higher up. Everywhere above 7000 feet are fine thick forests, grassy glades, deep glens, and running streams, of which a view of the mountains from below gives little promise. On the lower and more barren hills below the forest, are to be found numerous flocks of the wild sheep (Ovis Vignei). At an elevation of 11,000 feet, wild onions grow in great profusion, and to this fact the range is indebted for its Chinese name, Tsungling ('the Onion mountains').\n\nThe principal difficulty in communication is caused by the rivers,\nwhich in winter shrink to small dimensions, but in summer, fed by snow-fields and glaciers of enormous extent, become impassable torrents, bringing down tons of soil in their turbid waters. Many of the streams are rich in gold, especially those flowing from the great Rakiposh mountains, and it is probable that a scientific search for minerals would be well repaid. The natives believe that the gold is generated by the glaciers, because the greatest quantity is found in the glacier mud, and there are traditions of small but rich veins of earth having been occasionally laid bare by earthquakes. Gold-washing is only practised by the poorest in winter, but is sometimes very remunerative, the best gold being of 20 carats.\n\nNearly half-way between Gilghit town and the Indus is the Bagrot valley, which contains several flourishing villages. This valley is celebrated for the quantity and quality of its gold production, and there are many signs of mineral wealth. It was a favourite resort of the old Gilghit rulers, and was their last place of refuge, when hard pressed by external enemies. The Bagrot people belong almost entirely to the Shin caste or clan.\n\nThe Hanza river joins that of Gilghit, a mile below the town. Though fordable in winter, in summer it is a deep and rapid torrent, more than a hundred yards in breadth. Kashmir jurisdiction extends some 25 miles up the valley to a point at which the river makes a sudden bend from a westerly course to the south-east. Immediately above the bend of the river is the district of Chaprot, consisting of the fort and village of that name, and three other villages. This district has always been a fruitful source of contention among the rulers of the three States of Gilghit, Hanza, and Nagar, between which it is situated, chiefly on account of the fort, which is locally considered impregnable. It is situated in the angle formed by the junction of two streams, with high precipitous banks, and can therefore only be approached on one side. It has belonged in turn to all three States, but at present is garrisoned by Kashmir troops. Continuing up the valley to the eastward, at about 52 miles from Gilghit town, the residences of the rulers of the two States of Hanza and Nagar are reached, the river forming the boundary between them.\n\nThe great Rakiposh mountain, as viewed from the north, rises from the water's edge without a break for 19,000 feet to its topmost peak, which is over 25,000 feet above sea-level. Above Hanza the course of the Hanza river, which rises in the Hindu Kush, lies entirely in Hanza territory. The people of Hanza and Nagar are of the same stock as those of Yasin, Ponyal, and the majority of the people of Gilghit and the neighbouring valleys. They are Muhammadan Shi'as, and slavery does not exist among them. Their rulers are called Thum, and their families are descended from twin brothers, Moghlot and Girkis, who\nlived about the end of the 15th century. Although it is the smaller of the two States, Nagar has the larger population, owing to the greater amount of cultivable land which it contains; the country is famous for its apricots, which are dried and exported to the Punjab in considerable quantities, and its streams are rich in gold. Nearly opposite Hanza, the Myetsil river joins the main stream from the south-west. The fort of Nagar and the Th\u00fam's residence are on the southern side of this stream, about 3 miles from the junction, and at an elevation of 8000 feet above the sea. The valley forms the eastern boundary of the Nagar State. In the prosperous times of Shin rule, the Th\u00fams of Nagar acknowledged the R\u00e1s of Gilghit as their feudal superiors.\n\nAt the time of the Sikh occupation of Gilghit, a very close connection existed between the rulers of the two States of Gilghit and Nagar. Since 1868, Nagar has been tributary to Kashmir, to which it makes an annual payment of 21 tolas (a tola = nearly \u00bd ounce) of gold, and two baskets of apricots. Hanza has an agricultural population of about 6000 souls. North of the great range of peaks which bisects the principality from south-east to north-west, the country opens out into rolling steppes. This tract is known as Little G\u00fajhal to distinguish it from Wakh\u00e1n, and supports a scattered pastoral population. Farther to the north-east of the principality are the two small communities of Pakhp\u00fa and Shaksh\u00fa, said to contain between them nearly 10,000 souls. Both pay tribute to the ruler of Hanza. These curious people, of whom very little is known, are of Aryan race, handsome, very fair, and of ruddy complexion. Nearly due north of Hanza is the small mountain State of Sirikol. The ruling family of Hanza is called Ayeshe (heavenly). The two States of Hanza and Nagar were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the R\u00e1s, the ruling family of Gilghit, whose seat of government was Nagar. Hanza used once to be the chief place of resort for slave merchants from Badaksh\u00e1n. The principality is divided into 8 districts, each having its own fort.\n\nThe people of Hanza and Nagar belong to the caste called Yeshk\u00fan by the Shins of Gilghit, but known amongst themselves as B\u00farish. The Yeshk\u00fans, besides being numerically superior in Gilghit, form nearly all the population of Y\u00e1sin, Sai, Darel, and Astor. They are great wine drinkers, and are reproached by their neighbours for their readiness to eat unorthodox food, and for the immorality of their women. Muhammadanism sits but loosely on them. The most remarkable peculiarity of the Shins of these parts is their feeling with regard to the cow, in spite of their conversion to Muhammadanism. Orthodox Shins will not eat beef, drink cow\u2019s milk, or touch a vessel containing it. A sucking calf or any portion of a dead animal is especially unclean, and it is not uncommon for a Shin to make over his cow and calf to a Yeksh\u00fan neighbour, to be restored to him when the calf is weaned. The Shins also\nregard the domestic fowl as unclean, and in districts inhabited by them not a single fowl is to be seen. These peculiarities are strictly confined to the Shins, and they afford good grounds for supposing that they were a race of Hindus who came from the south, and pressing up the Indus valley, established a Hindu State in these remote regions, under the crest of the Hindu Kush. In Gilghit itself there are a great number of Kashmiris, or, as they are here called, Kashir\u00fas, whose forefathers settled in the place in the time of Ahmad Shah Abdali, about A.D. 1760. They now form the largest section of the Gilghit population, and the shrewdness which forms so distinctive a part of the character of the ordinary Kashmiri has suffered little by transplanting. Some are said to have penetrated into Chitr\u00e1l, where they have since become merged in the regular population. Those in Gilghit are weavers and carpenters, and they are regarded with some contempt both by Shins and Yeshk\u00fans.\n\nThe Pony\u00e1l district, 19 miles above Gilghit town, stretches for some 22 miles up to the Y\u00e1sin frontier. Of old an appanage of Gilghit, Pony\u00e1l became in later times a bone of contention between the rulers of Y\u00e1sin and Gilghit, who each possessed it in turn for a time, till it finally came into the possession of Kashmir in 1860.\n\nHanza raids against Gilghit villages were frequent, but in 1869 they were put an end to by the Th\u00fam of Hanza yielding allegiance and paying a yearly tribute of two horses, two hounds, and twenty ounces of gold dust. The elevation of Hanza is 8400 feet. Cultivation in this tract extends about 7 miles in length by 1\u00bd in depth. The Th\u00fam lives at Baltit. He is addressed as Soori or Sri, an appellation of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. In cutting the throat of an animal for food, the people of Hanza make a practice of turning it towards the Th\u00fam's abode, even when many miles distant, instead of in the orthodox direction of Mecca.\n\nGinaur.\u2014North-western tahsil of Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the northern bank of the Ganges.\u2014See Gunaur.\n\nGingi (Chenji).\u2014Fort in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 12\u00b0 15' 19\" N., longitude 79\u00b0 26' 8\" E.; situated on the road from Kistnagiri to the coast, about half-way between Tindivanam and Trinomalai; 82 miles south-west from Madras, and 50 north-east from Cuddalore, the chief town of the District.\n\nFormerly there was no village of Gingi beyond a few houses near the foot of the hills; but now, in order to perpetuate the name, which is well known in history, Government have directed that the neighbouring village of Bagayah should be called Gingi. The interest of the place is exclusively historical. The fortress consists of three strongly-fortified hills, connected by long walls of circumvallation. The highest and most important hill is called R\u00e1j\u00e1giri; the two others being known as\nKistnagiri and Chendrayan Dr\u00fag. R\u00e1j\u00e1giri is about 500 or 600 feet high, and consists of a ridge terminating in an overhanging bluff, facing the south, and falling with a precipitous sweep to the plain on the north. On the summit of this bluff stands the citadel. The walls of circumvallation, already alluded to, enclose an area over 7 miles in circumference. Before the fortifications existed, the summit of the R\u00e1j\u00e1giri bluff must have been utterly inaccessible on all sides but the south-west. At this point, where the crest of the ridge meets the base of the bluff, a narrow and steep ravine probably gave a difficult means of access to the top, across which the Hindu engineer built three walls, each about 20 or 25 feet high, rising one behind the other at some little distance, and rendering an attack by escalade in that direction almost impracticable. On the north side, a narrow chasm divides a portion of the rock from the main mass. This chasm, the fortifiers of the rock artificially prolonged and heightened; and where it had a width of about 24 feet, and a depth of about 60, they threw a wooden bridge over it, and made the only means of ingress into the citadel through a narrow stone gateway facing the bridge, and about 30 yards from it, with flanking walls fitted with embrasures for guns and loopholed for musketry.\n\nIt is not known with certainty who constructed the fort. It is probable that the site was originally built on by the Chola kings, and quasi-authentic history attributes the commencement of the great fort to a son of Vijaya Rang\u00e1 Naik, the Governor of Tanjore in 1442. The works were completed during the time of the Vijayanagar kings. The martello towers and cavaliers show traces of European supervision, and some of the more modern embrasures were the work of the French. The great lines of fortification which cross the valley between the three hills were evidently built at different periods. In their original form, they each consisted of a wall about 5 feet thick, built up of blocks of granite, and filled in with rubble; but subsequently a huge earthen rampart, about 25 or 30 feet thick, has been thrown up behind these walls, and riveted roughly on the inside with stone, while at intervals in this rampart are barracks or guard-rooms.\n\nSeveral ruins of fine buildings are situated inside the fort. Of these, the most remarkable are the two pagodas, the Kaliy\u00e1na Mahal, the Gymkh\u00e1na, the Granaries, and the I'dgah. There are various mandaps (porches) on each of the hills, and a large granary on the top of Kistnagiri. The most noticeable building of all, perhaps, is the Kaliy\u00e1na Mahal. This consists of a square court surrounded by rooms for the ladies of the Governor's household. In the middle of this court is a square tower of eight storeys, and altogether about 80 feet high, with a pyramidal roof. The first six storeys are all of the\nsame size and pattern, namely, an arcaded verandah running round a small room, about 8 feet square, and communicating with the storey above by means of small steps. The room on the seventh storey has now no verandah, but there are indications of one having existed formerly. The topmost room is of smaller size than the others. The only other interesting feature in the building is an earthenware pipe leading to the sixth storey, and brought all the way from a tank 600 yards off, outside the walls of the fort, and carried under the wall to the back of the ladies' quarters, and thence over the roof to the Mahal.\n\nOne of the most singular features about Gingi is the water-supply. There are two perennial springs of excellent water on the top of R\u00e1j\u00e1giri\u2014one outside the gateway of the citadel, and the other on the very summit of the rock. At the foot of the ridge at the back of R\u00e1j\u00e1giri, and between it and Chandrayan Dr\u00fag, are two tanks, and on the western side of the bluff is a third reservoir constructed to catch the surface drainage. The principal objects of interest are\u2014the great gun on the top of R\u00e1j\u00e1giri; the R\u00e1ja's bathing-stone, a large smooth slab of granite, 15 feet square and 4 or 5 inches thick, near the spot where the palace is said to have stood; and the prisoners' well. This latter is a very singular boulder, about 15 or 20 feet high, poised on a rock near the Chakrakulam and surmounted by a low circular brick wall. It has a natural hollow passing through it like a well, and the bottom, having been blocked up with masonry and the upper edges smoothed with a little masonry work plastered with chunam, a natural dry well was formed, into which prisoners are said to have been thrown and allowed to die of starvation. The top of the boulder can only be reached by means of a ladder, but the hollow has now been filled up with rubbish. The metal of which the gun is made has little or no rust. It has the figures 7560 stamped on the breech. A little to the south of R\u00e1j\u00e1giri is a fourth hill called Chakli Dr\u00fag. The summit is strongly fortified, but these fortifications are not connected with those of Gingi.\n\nHistory.\u2014As mentioned above, Gingi was a stronghold of the Vijayanagar power, which was at the height of its prosperity towards the close of the 15th century, and was finally overthrown by the allied Muhammadan kings of the Deccan in 1564, at T\u00e1l\u00edkot. It was not till 1638, however, that Bandull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the Bij\u00e1pur general, captured the fort of Gingi, after joining his forces to those of Golconda, which were then beleaguering the place. The division of the Bij\u00e1pur army that effected this was commanded by Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, father of Sivaji the Great. In 1677, the fort fell to Sivaji by stratagem, and remained in Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 hands for twenty-one years. In 1690, the armies of the Delhi Emperor, under Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, were despatched against Gingi with a view to the final extirpation of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. The siege was prolonged for\neight years, but the fort fell in 1698, and afterwards became the head-\nquarters of the standing army in Arcot. In 1750, the French under\nM. Bussy captured it by a skilful and daringly-executed night-sur-\nprise, and held it with an efficient garrison for eleven years, defeating\none attack by the English under Major Kineer in 1752. Captain\nStephen Smith took the place after five weeks' siege in 1761. In\n1780 it was surrendered to Haidar Ali, but subsequently it played no\npart of importance in the wars of Southern India. Gingi has long\nenjoyed the reputation of being one of the most unhealthy localities\nin the Karn\u00e1tic. The French are said by Orme to have lost 1200\nEuropean soldiers during their eleven years' tenancy of it, and their\ngarrison of Europeans rarely exceeded 100 men. There is no trace,\nhowever, of any burial-ground where these men were interred. The\nplace is now deserted, but Government allows an annual grant for the\npreservation of the ruins.\n\nGingi.\u2014River of South Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See\nARIAKUPUM.\n\nGir (Geer).\u2014Range of hills in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency, ex-\ntending over 40 miles in length, commencing from a point about 20\nmiles north-east of Diu island. Captain Grant of the Indian Navy was\ncaptured in 1813 by an outlaw named H\u00e1w\u00e1w\u00e1la, who kept him a\nprisoner on these hills for two and a half months. The region consists\nof a succession of rugged ridges and isolated hills covered with\nforest.\n\nGirar.\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; 37 miles south-\neast of Wardh\u00e1 town. Lat. 20\u00b0 40' N., long. 79\u00b0 9' 30\" E. The shrine\nof the Musalm\u00e1n saint, Shaikh Khw\u00e1j\u00e1 Far\u00edd, crowns the summit of a\nneighbouring hill, and attracts a continual flow of devotees, both Hindus\nand Musalm\u00e1ns. This holy man was born in Hindust\u00e1n, and, after\nwandering for thirty years as a fak\u00edr, he settled on the Girar Hill about\n1244. Two travelling traders once mocked the saint, on which he\nturned their stock of cocoa-nuts to stone; then moved by their suppi-\ncations, he created a fresh stock from dry leaves. The traders were\nso struck by these wonders, that they attached themselves to the saint's\nservice, and their two graves may yet be seen on the hill. The shrine\nabsorbs the revenues of five villages, Girar itself, however, not being\namong the number. The town has a police outpost, a good village\nschool, and a weekly market. Population (1881) 1548.\n\nGird\u00e1b\u00e1di.\u2014One of the peaks of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, in Chinna\nKimedi zamind\u00e1rt, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 29'\n44\" N., long. 84\u00b0 25' 18\" E.; 3399 feet above sea-level. A Great\nTrigonometrical Survey station.\n\nGiridhi.\u2014Sub-division of Haz\u00e1risb\u00e1gh District, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur,\nBengal. Giridhi station is the terminus of a branch line from Madhu-\npur on the East Indian Railway. This branch is at present 23 miles in length, and opens up the important Karharbari (Karharbali) coal-field. A convenient route to P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th is obtained by proceeding by railway to Giridhi, and thence 20 miles by palanquin or horseback to the foot of the sacred hill. Area of the Sub-division, 2446 square miles; number of villages, 3553; houses, 70,631. Total population (1881) 432,504, namely, males 216,027, and females 216,477. Hindus numbered 356,230; Muhammadans, 45,321; Christians, 172; Sant\u00e1s, 28,043; Kols, 2649; other aboriginal tribes, 89. Average density of population, 177 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.45; houses per square mile, 29.96; persons per village, 121; persons per house, 6.12. The Sub-division comprises the five th\u00e1nds or police circles of Pachamba, Gawan, Karagdiha, Kodarma, and Dumurhi. It contained in 1883, one civil and two criminal courts, a regular police force of 113 officers and men, and a rural police or village watch numbering 881.\n\nGiriy\u00e1k.\u2014Village on the Panch\u00e1na river, Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 1' 45\" N., long. 85\u00b0 34' E. South-west of the village, and on the opposite side of the river, stands the peak at the end of the double range of hills commencing near Gay\u00e1, which General Cunningham identifies with Fa Hian's Solitary Mountain, suggesting at the same time that its name is derived from ek-giri, or 'one hill;' but this statement has been doubted. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton has described the ruins of Giriy\u00e1k, which are full of arch\u00e6ological interest. They were originally ascended from the north-east; and remains of a road about 12 feet wide, paved with large stone blocks, and winding so as to procure a moderate gradient, still exist. It could, however, never have been practicable for wheeled carriages. At the west end of the ridge, a steep brick slope leads up to a platform, on which there are some granite pillars, probably part of an ancient temple. East of the ridge is an area 45 feet square, called the chabutara of Jarasindhu, the centre of which is occupied by a low square pedestal supporting a solid brick column 68 feet in circumference and 55 feet in height. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton considers the general impression that the ruins on this hill are the remains of Jarasindhu's country house erroneous for the ascent to Giriy\u00e1k must always have been too arduous to render it a place of luxurious retirement. The popular belief is that Krishna, on his way to challenge Jarasindhu to combat, crossed the river at this point, and a bathing festival is annually held at the spot in the month of K\u00e1rtik to commemorate the event.\n\nGirn\u00e1r.\u2014Sacred hill, with ruined temples, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bomoay Presidency; situated about 10 miles east of Jun\u00e1garh town. Lat. 21\u00b0 30' N., long. 70\u00b0 42' E. The hill rises to about 3500 feet above sea-level, and forms one of the sacred seats of Jainism, only second in\nimportance to P\u00e1lit\u00e1na. A rock at the foot of the hill outside the town is covered with a set of Asoka's inscriptions, 250 B.C. Another inscription (150 A.D.) relates how the local monarch, Rudra Dama, defeated the king of the Deccan; while a third (457 A.D.) records the bursting of the embankment of the Sudarsana tank, and the rebuilding of a bridge which was destroyed by the flood. There are, however, no remains of any ancient city, temples, or ruins of a corresponding age to these inscriptions, and but for their dates the place would have seemed to be unknown before the 10th century.\n\nThere are six parabs or rest-houses on the ascent to the temple of Nemin\u00e1th. The temple of Ambam\u00e1ta, which crowns the first peak of the hill, is much resorted to by newly-married couples of the different sub-divisions of the Br\u00e1hman caste. The bride and bridegroom have their clothes tied together, and attended by their male and female relatives, present cocoa-nuts and other offerings to the goddess, whose favour is sought to secure a continuance of wedded felicity.\n\nMr. James Fergusson, in his History of Indian and Eastern Architecture (John Murray, 1876, pp. 230-232), thus describes the architectural features of Girn\u00e1r:\u2014'The principal group of temples at Girn\u00e1r, some sixteen in number, is situated on a ledge about 600 feet from the summit, and nearly 3000 feet above the level of the sea. The largest and possibly the oldest of these is that of Nemin\u00e1th. An inscription upon it records that it was repaired in A.D. 1278, and unfortunately a subsequent restorer has laid his heavy hand upon it, so that it is difficult now to realize what its original appearance may have been. The temple stands in a courtyard measuring 195 feet by 130 feet over all. Around the courtyard are arranged 70 cells, with a covered and enclosed passage in front of them, each of which contains a cross-legged seated figure of the Tirthankar to whom the temple is dedicated (Nemin\u00e1th), and generally with a bas-relief or picture representing some act in his life. Immediately behind the temple of Nemin\u00e1th is a triple one, erected by the brothers Tejp\u00e1la and Vastup\u00e1la, who also erected one of the principal temples in Abu.'\n\nG\u00edrwa.\u2014River of Nep\u00e1l and Oudh; a branch of the Ka\u00farial\u00e1, leaving that stream on its eastern bank a mile below the point where it emerges through a gorge in the Himal\u00e1yas known as Sh\u00edsha-pan\u00ed or 'Crystal waters.' Some years ago, the G\u00edrwa was a mere watercourse, but its volume has gradually increased till it is now considerably larger than the parent stream. Both are rapid rivers; their beds covered with large pebbles, often a foot in diameter, particularly at the fords where they are broad and shallow, enabling elephants to cross generally without difficulty. Both streams are about 400 yards broad, and from 3 to 4 feet deep; they are unfordable by men, except at one or two\nplaces. The G\u00edrwa in particular is a beautiful stream, its banks being covered with dense sal, with the mountains showing over the tree-tops. In many places the river has worn for itself large clearings amid the jungle, several miles broad, through which the water passes in several clear channels. The islands thus formed are generally covered with shishdm trees and thickets of willow. Diagonally across the stream in its upper course extend ridges of kankar or conglomerate limestone, forming rapids, and causing a complete obstruction to navigation. In its lower course, the G\u00edrwa enters Bahr\u00e1ich District, and finally reunites with the Kauri\u00e1la a few miles below Bharthapur. The stream is navigable by large boats up to Dhanaura, just beyond British territory. The waters of the Kauri\u00e1la and G\u00edrwa, afterwards swelled by the Sarju and Chauka (or Sard\u00e1), finally become the Gogra, or great river of Oudh.\n\nGirw\u00e1n (or Sihonda).\u2014South-westerly tahsil of Banda District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of hilly eminences sloping down into an elevated plain, with detached granite rocks. Area, 331 square miles, of which 183 are cultivated. Population (1881) 88,651, namely, males 44,558, and females 44,093. Hindus numbered 82,129; Muhammadans, 6517; and 'others,' 5. Number of villages, 176; land revenue, \u00a314,802; total Government revenue, \u00a316,529; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a327,409. The tahsil, which is usually called Sihonda, although its head-quarters are at Girw\u00e1n town, contains the famous fortress of Kalinjar.\n\nGoa.\u2014Portuguese Settlement on the western coast of India, lying between 14\u00b0 53' and 15\u00b0 48' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 45' and 74\u00b0 24' E. long., about 250 miles south-south-east from Bombay. Bounded on the north by the river Tirakul or Auraundem, separating it from the Sawantwari State; on the east by the range of the Western Ghats, separating it from the District of Belgaum; on the south by North Kanara District; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. Extreme length from north to south, 62 miles; greatest breadth from east to west, 40 miles. Total area, 3370 square kilometres or 1062 square miles. Population (1881), including Anjediva, 445,449, or 419\u00b74 persons per square mile. Number of towns, 4; villages, 400; parishes, 100; and houses, 87,196.\n\nGoa forms a patch of foreign territory on the coast of the Bombay Presidency, surrounded on all sides, except to the seaward, by British Districts. It comprises the following 9 Districts, namely (Old Conquests), Ilhas (population 48,847); Salsette (109,620); Bardez (109,951); (New Conquests), Pernem (population 33,012); Sanquelim (45,179); Ponda (39,998); Sanguem (20,592); Quepem (19,663); and Canacona (18,490). It was not practicable to extend to this settlement the minute statistical survey which was carried out in British territory, and a personal visit disclosed the impossibility of\nadhering to the same arrangement. The following account was kindly drawn up for the Imperial Gazetteer by Dr. Jose Nicolau da Fonseca, President of the Sociedade dos Amigos das Letras, from official sources in Goa; it is now printed (as requested) with as few modifications as possible, although in a much condensed form, and with some historical amplifications.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Goa is a hilly country, especially that portion which was most recently acquired, known as the Novas Conquistas (New Conquests). Its distinguishing feature is the Sahy\u00e1dri Mountains, or Western Gh\u00e1ts, which, after skirting a considerable portion of the north-eastern and south-eastern boundaries, branch off westwards across the territory into numerous spurs and ridges. Of the isolated peaks with which these ranges of mountains are studded, the most conspicuous are, on the north\u2014Sons\u00e1g\u00e1r, 3827 feet above sea-level; Catlanchimauli, 3633 feet; Vaguerim, 3500 feet; Morlemchogor, 3400 feet, all in the Sat\u00e1ri mahal or District; on the east and west\u2014Sidnato at Ponda, Chandarnate at Chandrawadi, Consid at Astragar, and Dudeagar at Embarb\u00e1kam.\n\nThe territory is intersected by numerous rivers, which are generally navigable. Beginning on the north, the eight principal rivers are\u2014(1) The Tirakul or Auraundem, so called from the fortress of that name guarding its estuary; has its source in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, in the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri State, flows south-west for 14\u00bd miles, and, after forming the northern boundary of the District of Pernem, and also of the territory of Goa, discharges its waters into the Arabian Sea: (2) the Ch\u00e1por\u00e1 or Colvalle, 18 miles long, rises at R\u00e1m Gh\u00e1t, and, after separating the Districts of B\u00e1rdez, Bicholim, and Sanquelim from Pernem, takes a zigzag direction to the south-west through the villages of Salem, Revora, Colvalle, and empties itself into the sea close to the village of Ch\u00e1por\u00e1: (3) the B\u00e1ga, only 1 mile long, rises in B\u00e1rdez, and passes a redoubt of the same name: (4) the Sinquerim, 3\u00bd miles long, also rises in B\u00e1rdez close to the village of Pilerne, and, after describing almost a right angle, westwards and southwards, and forming the peninsula of Aguada, falls into the bay of the same name: (5) the Mand\u00e1vi, 38\u00bd miles in length, is the most important stream in the territory, both the ancient and modern metropolis being situated on its banks; it rises at Parvar Gh\u00e1t in the District of Sat\u00e1ri, first runs north-west of Ponda, and then south-west of Bicholim and B\u00e1rdez, and, after forming several islands and passing Panjim or New Goa, discharges its waters into the Bay of Aguada; its principal offshoots pass the villages of Mapuca, Tivim, and Assonora, watering the Districts of Bicholim, Sanquelim, and Zambaulim, and are locally known by those names: (6) the Juari, 39 miles in length, rises at the foot of Digny Gh\u00e1t in the District of Embarb\u00e1kam, runs northwards,\nseparating Salsette from Ponda, and falls into the Bay of Murmagao; like the Mand\u00e1vi, it has numerous offshoots, one of which joins the former river between Marcaim and Sao Louren\u00e7o after forming the island of Tissuadi: (7) the S\u00e1l, 15 miles long, runs close to the town of Margao, and discharges itself into the sea near the fort of Bet\u00fal: (8) the Talpona, 7 miles long, rises at Ambugh\u00e1t in the District of Astragar, and, running westwards through the District of Canacona, falls into the sea near the small fort of Talpona. The boats by which these rivers are navigated are called *tonas*, and the ferries across them are designated *passa-gens*.\n\nThe territory of Goa possesses a fine harbour, formed by the promontories of B\u00e1rd\u00e9z and Salsette. Half-way between these extremities projects the *cabo* (cape) from the island of Goa, dividing the harbour into two anchorages, known as Alguada and Murmagao. Both are capable of accommodating safely the largest shipping from September to May. Alguada is virtually closed to navigation during the southwest monsoon, owing to the high winds and sea, and the formation of sandbanks in the estuary of the Mand\u00e1vi at that period; but Murmagao is accessible at all times. A consequence of the intersection of numerous rivers, is the formation of many islands, of which the chief number 18.\n\nThe rainfall for the three years ending 1875, as registered by the Meteorological Department, averaged 100.22 inches. The prevailing diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, diarrhoea, and dysentery.\n\nLaterite is the stone most abundant throughout the territory. Iron is found at B\u00e1ga Sat\u00e1ri, Pernem, and especially in the District of Zambaulim. The geological resources of Goa have not yet been scientifically explored.\n\nStately forests are found in the Novas Conquistas. The reserve and other forests scattered over an area of 30,000 hectares, or 74,133 acres, have an aggregate value, according to the Report of the Forest Committee of 1871, of \u00a3700,000. The wasteful practice of *kumri* or nomadic cultivation, till lately prevalent, has denuded them of valuable trees. More attention is now paid to this branch of public administration, which is entrusted to a special department. In 1874, the forest revenue amounted to \u00a31040, 7s. 6d., and the expenditure to \u00a3429, 16s.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Goa Proper, in 1800, i.e. the Velhas without the Novas Conquistas, was calculated at 178,478; composed of 91,436 males and 87,042 females. The whole population of the Velhas (old) and Novas (new) Conquistas, according to the Census of 1851, was 363,788; showing a density of 342.54 to the square mile.\n\nThe population of the territory of Goa in 1881, according to the\nCensus Report of that year, was 445,449, as shown by the table on the opposite page, being an increase of 81,661 since 1851, or 22.4 per cent. in 30 years.\n\nThe inhabitants are divided into three classes\u2014(1) Europeans, (2) the descendants of Europeans, and (3) Natives. The last class may be again sub-divided into Christians and Pagans. The native Christians, who constitute a little more than half of the total population, are the descendants of Hindus converted to Christianity on the subjugation of the country by the Portuguese, and can still trace the caste to which they originally belonged. The predominating caste among the Pagans is that of Shenvis, or Saraswati Br\u00e1hmans. Chitp\u00e1wans and Kar\u00e1d\u00e1s are also to be found, as well as the low or depressed castes, such as Mah\u00e1rs, Cham\u00e1rs, etc., who are generally to be distinguished by their darker colour. The few Musalm\u00e1ns are, as a class, in a poor condition. The males among native Christians for the most part adopt European costumes, while the females still wear the indigenous s\u00e1ri. The ordinary expenses of a middle-class family seldom exceed \u00a33 a month. All classes of the people, except Europeans, use the Konk\u00e1ni language, with some admixture of Portuguese words. But the official language is Portuguese, which is commonly spoken in the capital and the principal towns, as well as by all educated persons. French is understood by some, and English chiefly by those who have resided for a long time in British territories.\n\nThe majority of the population profess the Roman Catholic religion, and are subject in spiritual matters to an Archbishop, who has the title of the Primate of the East, and exercises jurisdiction over the Catholics of all the Portuguese colonies in the East, and of a great portion of British India. His nomination rests with the King of Portugal, subject to confirmation by the Pope. There are altogether 96 Christian churches in Goa, mostly built by the Jesuits and the Franciscans prior to the extinction of the religious orders in Portuguese territory. The chief of these churches is the cathedral or metropolitan church, called the S\u00e9 Primacial de Goa. The religious orders have been abolished in Portuguese India, and the churches are under the charge of secular priests, all of whom are natives of Goa. The Catholics of Goa are very regular in the fulfilment of religious duties, and celebrate the chief festivals sanctioned by the Catholic Church with much devotion and pomp. The Hindus and Muhammadans enjoy perfect liberty in religious matters, and have their own places of worship. The chief Hindu temples are those of Mangesh, M\u00e1ls\u00e1, S\u00e1nt\u00e1durg\u00e1, Kapleshwar, N\u00e1gesh, and Ramn\u00e1th, all of which are situated in the Novas Conquistas.\n\nAt the conquest of Goa by Alfonso de Albuquerque in 1510, the [Sentence continued on p. 92.]\n### Population of the Portuguese Settlement of Goa in 1881\n\n#### Details of the Population\n\n| Districts | Total Population |\n|-----------|------------------|\n| I.

Albuquerque carefully maintained the constitution of the villages, and avoided all appearance of fresh taxation. The same policy was followed by his successors; and in 1526, a register was compiled, called *Foral dos usas e Costumes*, containing the peculiar usage and customs of the communities, and the privileges enjoyed by them from time immemorial. This register served as a guide-book to subsequent administrators. But in time the communities were burdened with additional imposts, and placed under certain restrictions. At present they are under the supervision of Government, which appoints in each District (*conselho*) of the Velhas Conquistas, an officer called Administrador das Communidades, to watch rigidly over their proceedings. They are precluded from spending even the smallest sum without Government sanction, and have to pay certain contributions to the parish churches and for the construction and repair of roads, the establishment of schools, etc. The staff of village servants is not the same in all parts, but it usually comprises the following members:\u2014The tax-collector (*sacador*), the clerk (*escrivao*), the carpenter (*carpinteiro*), the barber (*barbeiro*), the shoemaker (*alparqueiro*), the washerman (*mainato*), the crier (*parpoti*), and the mahdar (*faras*). There is, however, no village head-man. On questions affecting the interests of a whole village, a sort of *panchdyat* or council is held, composed of one or more members of each clan (*vangor*), and the decisions are determined by the majority of votes. In the Velhas Conquistas, a great portion of the land is held by the village communities, which, after paying the rent and other Government taxes, divide the annual produce amongst themselves; while in the Novas Conquistas the lands are distributed among the *vangors*, who cultivate them and enjoy their net produce. The total number of village communities is 421. The aggregate revenue of the villages comprehended in the Velhas Conquistas amounted in 1872 to \u00a377,111, 16s., against an expenditure of \u00a326,436, 6s. 8d.\n\n*Agriculture.*\u2014The entire territory of Goa contains 679,680 acres, of which 234,754 acres are stated to be under cultivation, thus distributed among the different crops:\u2014Rice, 122,566 acres; other cereals, vegetables, etc., 77,076; cocoa-nut trees, 33,194; areca palms, 565; and fruit trees the remainder. The soil is chiefly argillaceous, but also contains light sand and more or less decayed vegetable matter. In many parts it is full of stone and gravel. Its fertility varies according to quality and situation in reference to the supply of water. Manure, consisting of ashes, fish, and dung, is largely employed. As a rule, the Velhas Conquistas are better cultivated than the Novas Conquistas. In\nboth these divisions of the Goa territory, a holding of 15 or 16 acres would be considered a good-sized farm, though the majority of holdings are of smaller extent.\n\nThe staple produce of the country is rice (Oryza sativa), of which there are two harvests\u2014(1) the winter crop, called sorodio, and (2) the summer crop or vangana, raised by means of artificial irrigation from the rain-water accumulated in reservoirs, ponds, and wells. For the sorodio crop, the field is ploughed before the commencement of the monsoon, the seed scattered in May or June, and the crop harvested in September; while as regards the vangana, the ploughing operations begin in October, the sowing in November, and the harvesting in February. Rice is cultivated in low lands (casana or cantor) situated near the banks of rivers, slopes of hills (molloy), stiff grounds (dulpan or dulip), and sandy soils (quero). The proportion of produce to seed is roughly estimated as follows:\u2014Near the banks of rivers, fifteen-fold; in dry and stiff soils, six-fold; and in other places, eight-fold. The quantity of rice produced is barely sufficient to meet the local demand for two-thirds of the year. Next to rice, the culture of cocoa-nut trees (Cocos nucifera) is deemed most important, from the variety of uses to which the products are applied. They grow in luxuriant groves on all lands not hilly or serviceable for the production of rice, and along the sea-coast. Areca palm (Areca catechu) is chiefly cultivated in the Novas Conquistas on lands irrigated from rivulets. Hilly places and inferior soils are set apart for the cultivation of such cereals as nachinim (Dolichos biflora), urid (Phaseolus max), culita (Dolichos uniflorus), orio (Panicum italicum), mug (Phaseolus radiatus), tori (Cytisus cajan). Of fruit-trees the most important are mango (Mangifera indica), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), cashew (Anacardium occidentale). Among the various kinds of vegetables are potato (Convolvulus batata), radishes (Raphanus sativus), yams (Dioscorea sativa), melons (Cucumis melo), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), bendas (Abelmoschus esculentus), etc. Besides these\u2014chillies (Capsicum frutescens), ginger (Zinziber officinale), turmeric (Curcuma longa), onion (Allium cepa), and certain vegetables of daily consumption are extensively cultivated in some villages. In the District of Satari a party of enterprising foreigners rented some years ago from Government certain plots of ground for coffee plantations. Several experiments were tried, but the result did not prove encouraging.\n\nGoa is seldom subject to great floods, though some of its Districts occasionally suffer from partial inundation during heavy rains. In times of drought, the agricultural classes sustain heavy loss, but the people at large are supplied, though at great cost, with rice from British territory. It is only when a general famine occurs beyond the frontier that signs of extreme distress are visible amongst the inhabitants.\nof Goa. Formerly the country was frequently subject to famine. The years 1553, 1570, and 1682 are said to have been seasons of great scarcity. In subsequent years, the constant incursions of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s occasioned much distress.\n\nThe condition of the agricultural classes in the Velhas Conquistas has of late improved, owing partly to the general rise in prices of all kinds of agricultural produce, and partly to the current of emigration to British territories. In the Novas Conquistas, however, the cultivators are said to have been reduced to great want and misery through the oppression of the landowners.\n\nCommerce and Manufactures.\u2014In the days of its glory, Goa was the chief entrep\u00f4t of commerce between the East and West. But with the downfall of the Portuguese Empire, it lost its commercial importance, and its trade has now dwindled into insignificance. Few manufacturing industries of any importance exist, but the country is not devoid of skilful artisans, such as goldsmiths, carpenters, blacksmiths, shoemakers, etc. Some of the articles produced are disposed of privately, while others are exposed for sale at the annual and weekly fairs held in various places. The principal exports are\u2014cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, mangoes, water-melons, jack, and other fruits; cinnamon, pepper, salt fish, gum, coir-work, firewood, fowls, and salt. Of these the last forms one of the principal sources of profit, the numerous salt-pans that exist in the country yielding a large quantity of salt over and above the local demand. The chief articles imported are\u2014rice, cloth, refined sugar, wines, tobacco, glass-ware, hardware, and other miscellaneous goods. The value of the imports largely exceeds that of the exports, thus causing a drain of money which would certainly have materially affected the financial condition of Goa, had not a stream of coin flowed constantly into the country from the savings of those of its inhabitants who reside temporarily in British territory. In 1874, the customs revenue amounted to \u00a321,388, 18s. The total number of vessels of every kind that entered the port of Goa in the same year was 1075, with 97,900 tons of cargo, while the number of those that left was 2084, with 119,756 tons.\n\nA line of railway now connects Murmagao with Hubli on the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway, the length of line to Hubli being 124 miles, of which 49 miles lie in Goa territory. Several new roads have recently been made, and others are in course of construction. According to the report of the Committee of Engineers, published in 1870, there were in that year 31 roads, complete and incomplete; of these the chief runs northwards from Verem, opposite Panjim, through the villages of Pilerne, Saligao, Parramaprica, and Assonora, meeting at Sankarwalle the road constructed in British territory.\n\nThere are no banking establishments or professional money-lenders\nin the country; but in cases of necessity, money can be borrowed from wealthy proprietors or religious confraternities at 5 per cent. In districts inhabited by Hindus, however, the current rate of interest is about 10 per cent. Landowners not unfrequently advance petty sums, or their equivalent in kind, without interest, to such of the cultivators or labourers as are their dependants, or live in their oarts (palmares), deducting the debt by monthly instalments from the wages due. In the Novas Conquistas, the rate of interest charged for an advance of grain is generally half as much as the value of the advance.\n\nOwing to the want of labourers, and the comparative increase in the price of grain, wages have of late risen considerably. Formerly they varied from 2d. to 3d. a day, but at present a male labourer earns as much as 6d., and a female 2\u00bdd. Agricultural labourers generally receive their wages in kind, either daily or weekly. Good masons and carpenters are paid at the rate of 1s. per diem; and male servants at about 4s. per month, besides food. Wherever female servants are employed, they, as a rule, receive no fixed wages, but it is usual to give them periodically some suits of clothes, and jewels on the occasion of marriage. The average price of a cow is about \u00a31; of a pair of oxen, \u00a35; of a pair of buffaloes, \u00a35; of a pig, \u00a31; of a score of fowls, 10s.; and of a score of ducks, \u00a31. In 1874-75, rice sold at 26 lbs. per rupee (2s.); urid, at 30 lbs.; culita, at 50 lbs.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Previous to 1871, Goa possessed a comparatively large Native army, but owing to the rebellion which broke out in that year it was disbanded, and a battalion composed wholly of Europeans was obtained from Portugal. The force now consists of 313 men of all ranks. The entire strength of the police is 919 men. The total expenditure on the public force was in 1874, \u00a349,687, 6s.\n\nThere is at present no naval force at Goa; but in the year 1874-75, the Settlement contributed a sum of \u00a39815, 15s. towards the maintenance of the Portuguese navy.\n\nThere is one telegraph office in Goa, at Panjim, maintained jointly by the British and Portuguese Governments, the latter contributing yearly the sum of \u00a3160, besides paying \u00a33 monthly as house rent. The receipts amounted to \u00a3198, 3s. 9d., and the expenditure to \u00a3256, 11s. 6\u00bdd. The head-quarters of the post-office are also at Panjim, with branches at Margao, Mapu\u00e7a, Ponda, Bicholim, Chinchinim, and Pernem. Letters sent from Goa to any part of British India, or vice versa, bear the postage stamps issued by both Governments. The total postal receipts in 1874-75 were \u00a31815, 6s.\n\nThere are two hospitals\u2014one for military men; and the other for the poor and destitute, called 'Hospital da Santa Caza de Misericordia' (Hospital of the Holy House of Mercy). In the year 1875, the latter contained 520 inmates, of whom 226 were females. The most\nimportant charitable institutions are\u2014the Santa Caza de Misericordia (Holy House of Mercy), at Chimbela; Sociedade de Caridade (Charitable Society), at Panjim; Hospicio de Sagrado Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Maria (Asylum of the Sacred Heart of Mary), at Margao; and Asilo de Nossa Senhora de Milagres (Asylum of our Lady of Miracles), at Mapu\u00e7\u00e1. The first is coeval with the conquest of Goa by the Portuguese, and maintains the hospital alluded to above and two establishments for the reformation and education of females. In 1874, these two houses contained a total of 48 inmates.\n\nOf late years, education has made considerable progress in Goa. In 1869\u201370 there were 137 lower schools, of which 52 were public and 85 private, with 6027 pupils of both sexes; 29 higher schools, of which 21 were public and 8 private, including 1 national lyceum or college, with 2433 pupils; 1 medical school, with 60 pupils; 1 school of chemistry, with 48 pupils; 1 mathematical and military school, with 137 pupils; 1 seminary for priests, with 92 pupils. Besides these, there are 3 public schools for girls. Since 1870 the military school has been closed, and a college for practical sciences, called Instituto Professional, established in its place. Besides the Government Gazette, called Boletim do Governo, there are five weekly periodicals\u2014viz. (1) A Gazeta de B\u00e1rdos, (2) A India Portuguesa, (3) A Nova Goa, (4) A Patria, and (5) O Ultramar, all edited in the Portuguese language by natives. In addition, there is a Portuguese religious paper called A Cruz, and a Marathi newspaper called Desha Sudh\u00e1rnech\u00e1. Of the four literary associations established in the country, the most important is the Instituto Vasco da Gama.\n\nThe total revenue in 1873\u201374 was \u00a3108,148, 10s., and the expenditure, \u00a3107,145, 18s. The sources of revenue are\u2014tithes at 10 per cent. on rice, cocoa-nuts, and salt, customs and postal dues, seal and stamp duties, tobacco licences, taxes on liquor-shops, etc.\n\nGoa is regarded as an integral portion of the Portuguese Empire, and, with Dam\u00e1n and Diu, forms, for administrative purposes, one Province subject to a Governor-General, who is appointed directly by the King of Portugal, and holds his office for five years. Besides his civil functions, he is invested with the supreme military authority in the Province. His personal staff consists of two aides-de-camp, and a secretary styled the Chief Secretary of the Governor-General of Portuguese India, and likewise appointed by the king. Although he is the chief executive functionary, the Governor-General cannot, except in cases of emergency, impose new taxes, or abolish the existing ones, contract loans, create new appointments, or reduce the old ones, retrench the salaries attached to them, or generally incur any expenses not sanctioned by law; nor can he, under any circumstances, leave the Province without the special permission of the Home Government.\nIn the administration of the Province, the Governor-General is aided by a council composed of the Chief Secretary, the Archbishop of Goa, or, in his absence, the chief ecclesiastical authority exercising his functions, the Judges of the High Court, the two highest military officers in Goa, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of the Junta de Fazenda Publica (council of public revenue), the Health Officer, and the President of the Municipal Chamber or Corporation of the Capital (camara municipal de capital). As a rule, all the members give their opinions, and vote in every matter on which they are consulted by the Governor-General. There are also three other Juntas or councils, called the Junta Geral da Provincia (general council of the Province), the Junta da Fazenda Publica (council of public revenue), and the Conselho de Provincia (the council of the Province). The first of these is composed of the Chief Secretary, the Archbishop or his substitute, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of the Junta da Fazenda Publica, the Director of Public Works, the Health Officer, a Professor of the Medico-Surgical College, a Professor of the Instituto Professional, a Professor of the Lyceum, a Professor of the Normal School, and a representative from each of the municipal corporations of the Province. This Junta discusses and decides all questions relating to public works, and the expenses necessary for their execution, the preservation of public health, the establishment of schools, the alteration of custom duties, etc. The Governor-General is empowered to suspend the operation of any resolution passed by this Junta, pending a reference to the Home Government. The second council consists of the Governor-General as President, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of the same council, and the Accountant-General. This Junta exercises a direct and active control over the public revenues, making the requisite provisions for their proper collection and expenditure; and no public expense can be made without its sanction. The third council is altogether of inferior importance.\n\nIn addition to the above machinery of administration, there are subordinate agencies for the local government of the different districts. In connection with these agencies, the entire territory of Goa is divided into two tracts, known as the Velhas and Novas Conquistas (old and new conquests). The former tract is sub-divided into three districts (conselhos)\u2014viz, the Ilhas, B\u00e1rdez, and Salsette\u2014and each of these again into parishes, of which there are 85 in all. Every district has a municipal corporation, and is placed under the charge of a functionary called Administrador da Conselho. This officer is appointed by the Governor-General, and is entrusted with duties of an administrative character, besides those connected with the public safety and health. Every parish has likewise a minor council, called Junta da Parochia, presided over by a magistrate, called Regedor, whose duties are to\ninspect and direct the police establishments of the parish, keep a strict surveillance over liquor-shops, gaming-houses, etc., open wills and testaments, and report generally every important occurrence to the Administrador. Similarly in each of the six divisions into which the Novas Conquistas are sub-divided, there is an officer called Administrador Fiscal, whose duties are almost identical with those of the Administrador da Conselho. The functions of a Regedor are here exercised by a village kulkarni. Of the above-named six divisions, the first is Pernem; the second, Sanquelim, or Sat\u00e1ri and Bicholim; the third, Ponda; the fourth, Sanguem, or Astagr\u00e1r and Embarb\u00e1kam; the fifth, Quepem, or Bally, Chandorowadi, and Cacora; and the sixth, Canacona with Cabo de R\u00e1ma. Each of the sub-divisions of the Velhas and Novas Conquistas is also known by the name of Province. The offices of Governor, Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, and some other important ones are almost invariably filled by Europeans; while those of Administrador da Conselho and Regedor are held by natives. As stated above, there are three municipalities in the Velhas Conquistas, the chief being that of the Ilhas. The municipal receipts in 1874\u201375 amounted to \u00a31232, 15s.\n\nGoa and its dependencies in India, viz. Dam\u00e1n and Diu, together with Mozambique, Macao, and Timor, constitute, for judicial purposes, but one judicial district. This district is divided into Comarcas, which are sub-divided into Julgados, and these again into Tregulsias or parishes. Each parish is superintended by a justice of the peace, whose appointment is honorary. It is the duty of this functionary to arbitrate between litigants in civil suits, except those affecting the interests of minors, and those relating to mortmain; to institute preliminary inquiries into criminal matters previous to their submission for trial; to try municipal offences, and decide petty suits not exceeding in amount or value 2500 reis (12s.). Against his decision an appeal lies to the court of a judge of higher jurisdiction called Juiz Ordinario.\n\nIn every Julgado there is a Juiz Ordinario, with an establishment consisting of a sub-delegate of the Attorney-General, two clerks, two or more bailiffs, and a translator or interpreter. All these officials are paid by Government, and are besides entitled to fees, except the clerks, who receive fees only. A Juiz Ordinario holds his sittings twice a week, for the purpose of deciding civil and criminal cases within his jurisdiction. The former are chiefly connected with disputes concerning landed property not exceeding the value of \u00a32, or moveable property not exceeding \u00a36. The latter relate to offences for which no higher punishment can be awarded than a fine of 15s., or three days' rigorous imprisonment.\n\nThe Juiz de Direito holds the next grade, in charge of a Comarca, with a staff composed of a delegate of the Attorney-General, three\nclerks, one interpreter and translator, an accountant, four or five bailiffs, all of whom, except the clerks and accountant, receive, in addition to certain fees, fixed salaries. A judge of this class exercises ordinary and extraordinary jurisdiction in matters both civil and criminal. He is required to go on circuit annually to the Julgados, where he hears complaints against subordinate functionaries, examines their proceedings and registers, and sometimes tries those suits within his jurisdiction which may not have been submitted to his tribunal by the ordinary judges. His decision in suits relating to landed property exceeding in value \u00a310, and moveable property above \u00a315, are subject to appeal to the High Court of Goa. Within the limits of the Julgado, where the seat of his tribunal is fixed, this officer exercises the functions of a judge of ordinary jurisdiction as well as those of a district judge.\n\nThe supervision of all the above judges is entrusted to a High Court (Tribunal da Rela\u00e7\u00e3o), whose seat is in Nova Goa (New Goa), in consequence of which it is sometimes called Rela\u00e7\u00e3o de Nova Goa. This court consists of a Chief Justice (Presidente) and 3 puisne judges, with a staff consisting of an Attorney-General, an assistant, a registrar, 2 assistant registrars, an accountant, and 2 bailiffs, all drawing salaries from the public treasury besides certain perquisites. The High Court has jurisdiction, both ordinary and extraordinary, in all cases, whether civil or criminal, and is invested with appellate powers. Its decisions are final in all suits except those relating to immoveable property exceeding in value \u00a3150, and moveable property above \u00a3250, in which an appeal lies to the Supreme Tribunal of Portugal. Besides the High Court, there are in Goa 3 courts of the Juiz de Direito, established in the three Comarcas of the Ilhas, B\u00e1rdez, and Salsette. The Ilhas are divided into two Julgados\u2014(1) Panjim, and (2) Ponda. B\u00e1rdez into four\u2014(1) Mapu\u00e7a, the chief town of the Comarca, (2) Calangute, (3) Pernem, (4) Bicholim. Salsette into three\u2014(1) Margao, (2) Chinchinim, and (3) Quepem. The offices of the judges of the High Court, and of Comarcas, are filled by Europeans, and those of the Julgados by natives. The total sum spent on judicial administration in 1873-74 amounted to \u00a35551, 16s. The following are the statistics of the High Court in 1874:\u2014Civil judgments, 167; criminal judgments, 164; total, 331.\n\nHistory.\u2014Certain inscriptions lately deciphered corroborate the evidence of the Pur\u00e1ns that Goa was in ancient times known under the various names of Gomanchala, Gomant, Goapuri, Gopakapur, and Gopa-Kapatanua; while recent investigations prove its identity with the Sind\u00e1bur of Arab writers. The accounts handed down from antiquity teem with legendary tales, on which little reliance can be placed. In the Sahy\u00e1di Kh\u00e1n\u1e0da of the Skanda Pur\u00e1\u1e47\u00e1, it is recorded that at an early period the Aryans settled in Goa, having been brought\nby Parasur\u00e1ma from Trihotrapur or Mithila, the modern Tirh\u00fat. Some of the inscriptions referred to above show that Goa afterwards passed under the sway of the Kadambas or Banaw\u00e1si, whose first king, Trilochana Kadamba, is supposed to have flourished in K\u00e1liyug 3220, or about A.D. 109-110. This dynasty continued to rule until 1312, when Goa fell for the first time into the hands of the Muhammadans, under Malik Kafur. They were, however, compelled to evacuate it in 1370, having been defeated by Vydy\u00e1ranya M\u00e1dhawa, the Prime Minister of Harihara of Vijayanagar, under whose successors Goa remained for about 100 years. In 1449 it was conquered by Muhammad Gawan, the general of Muhammad II, the 13th B\u00e1hmani King of the Deccan, and incorporated into the dominions of that sovereign. After the downfall of this house, Goa became subject to the Adil Sh\u00e1hi dynasty reigning at Bij\u00e1pur, about the time that Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut in 1498. This dynasty retained possession until the 17th February 1510, when Goa was captured by Alfonso d'Albuquerque.\n\nThe Portuguese fleet, consisting of 20 sail of the line, with a few small vessels and 1200 fighting men, hove in sight of the harbour. A holy mendicant or jogi had lately foretold its conquest by a foreign people from a distant land, and the disheartened citizens rendered up the town to the strangers. Eight leading men presented the keys of the gates to Albuquerque on their knees, together with a large banner which was only unfurled on State occasions. Mounted on a richly caparisoned steed, Albuquerque entered the city in a triumphal procession, drums beating, trumpets sounding, with the Portuguese banners carried by the flower of the Lisbon nobility and clergymen at the head, amidst the acclamations of an immense multitude, who showered upon the conqueror filagree flowers of silver and gold. Albuquerque behaved well to the inhabitants, but was shortly afterwards expelled by the Bij\u00e1pur ruler.\n\nYusaf Adil Sh\u00e1h, King of Bij\u00e1pur, marched against the place with a considerable force, and after several sanguinary contests, retook it from the Portuguese on the 15th August of the same year. Reinforced, however, by the large armament which opportunely arrived from Portugal about this time, Albuquerque hastened back to Goa with his fleet, and conquered it a second time on the 25th of November. With 28 ships, carrying 1700 men, he forced his way into the town after a bloody assault, in which 2000 Musalm\u00e1ns fell. For three days the miserable citizens were given over as a prey to every atrocity. The fifth part of the plunder, reserved for the Portuguese Crown, amounted to \u00a320,000. Albuquerque promptly occupied himself in fortifying the place, embellishing the city, and establishing the Portuguese rule on a firm basis.\nFrom this time Goa rapidly rose in importance, and eventually became the metropolis of the Portuguese Empire in the East, which is said to have comprehended an area of about 4000 leagues. In 1543, during the governorship of Martin Alfonso, who came to India together with the celebrated St. Francis Xavier, the two important Provinces or mahals of B\u00e1rdez and Salsette were ceded to the Portuguese by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h, who, however, not long afterwards, attempted to regain them, but was foiled in his endeavours by the intrepidity of Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro. To provide against any future invasion on the part of the Muhammadans, the eastern part of the island of Goa was protected by means of a long wall. In 1570, Al\u00ed Adil Sh\u00e1h besieged the city with an army of 100,000 men; but it was so bravely defended by the little garrison under the Viceroy Dom Lu\u00eds de Atha\u00edde that the Muhammadan army, greatly thinned in number, retreated precipitately after a tedious siege of ten months' duration. About this period, the Portuguese were alarmed by the appearance on the coast of India of a new enemy. The Dutch, having shaken off the Spanish yoke, assumed a warlike attitude towards the Portuguese, owing to the intimate connection between Portugal and Spain.\n\nThe subsequent history of the town has been one of luxury, ostentation, and decay. After bearing a siege by the King of Bij\u00e1pur, and suffering from a terrible epidemic, Goa reached the summit of its prosperity at the end of the 16th century. During the very years when the English Company was struggling into existence under Elizabeth, 'Goa Dourada,' or Golden Goa, seemed a place of fabulous wealth to the plain merchants who were destined to be the founders of British India. 'Whoever hath seen Goa, need not see Lisbon,' said a proverb of that day. Indeed, if the accounts of travellers are to be trusted, Goa presented a scene of military, ecclesiastical, and commercial magnificence which has had no parallel in the European capitals of India. The descriptions that have been left of Calcutta in the last and during the first quarter of the present century, leave behind them a feeling of insignificance compared with the accounts of Goa, written nearly three hundred years ago. To find a parallel, we must go to the travellers' tales regarding Agra and Delhi during the zenith of the Mughal prosperity. The brilliant pomp and picturesque display of Gea was due to the fact that it was not only a flourishing harbour, but also the centre of a great military and ecclesiastical power. The Portuguese based their dominion in India on conquest by the sword. They laboured to consolidate it by a proselytizing organization, which throws the missionary efforts of every other European power in India into the shade. The result has proved how rotten was this basis, and how feebly cemented was the superstructure reared upon it. But during the greatness of Goa it had all the splendours which the church and a powerful military court could cast around it.\nAfter the genius of Albuquerque and the energies of the early Viceroys had spent themselves, these armaments constituted a vast idle population in the capital. The work of conquest was over, and it left behind it a gay and wealthy society of conquerors who had nothing to do. Every Portuguese in India, says a traveller, set up as a 'Fidalgo' (sic). These gentlemen had to be amused. There were no hotels or inns in the city, but many boarding-houses and gambling saloons. The latter, writes a voyager in the 17th century, were sumptuously furnished, and paid a heavy tax to the Government. People of all classes frequented them, and entertainments were provided for the lookers-on by jugglers, dancing girls, musicians, wrestlers, and native actors or buffoons. 'Those who were inordinately fond of gambling stayed there sometimes for days together, and were provided with board and lodging.'\n\nSuch gambling houses were not places for respectable women, and while the male society thronged their saloons, the Portuguese ladies were rigorously shut up at home. The family income was derived from the labour of slaves, and as no 'Fidalgo' (sic) could follow a trade or calling without disgrace, so neither could his wife busy herself in domestic affairs without losing her social importance. The society of Goa, therefore, divided itself into two idle populations\u2014an idle population of men in the streets and gambling houses, and an idle population of women in the seclusion of their own homes. This was one of the first results of the intensely military spirit, with its contempt for peaceful forms of industry, on which rested the Portuguese power in India. The ladies of Goa soon obtained an unenviable notoriety in books of travel. Excluded from male society, they spent their time in indolence, quarrelling, and frivolous pursuits. A European zan\u00e1na life grew up, and brought with it some very ugly consequences. A lady valued herself in her female coterie upon the number and the daring of her intrigues. Almost every traveller who visited Goa during its prime tells the same curious story regarding the rashness with which the Portuguese matrons pursued their amours. Both Pyrard and Linschoten relate, in nearly the same words, how the ladies of Goa were wont to stupefy their husbands with dhat\u00edra, and then admit their lovers. The perils of such interviews became almost necessary to give a zest to their profligacy, and the Goanese became a byword as the type of an idle, a haughty, and a corrupt society.\n\nStrangers are inclined to laugh at Englishmen for adhering in India to the British costumes devised for a more temperate zone. There can be no doubt that the Dutch in Java have adapted their clothing much better to the climate than we have in Calcutta. But the very rigidity with which English society in India insists upon matters of dress is not without its value. It forms a perpetual check upon the tendency to fall into the slip-shod habits of Oriental domestic life. In Goa, these\nhabits were carried to an extreme length. At home, both ladies and gentlemen dressed very much like the natives, except for the large rosaries which they wore round their necks. While untidy and careless in their dress at home, they made an ostentatious display when they stirred abroad. When a gentleman rode out, he was attended by a throng of slaves in gay and fanciful liveries, some holding large umbrellas, others bearing richly inlaid arms; while the horse itself was loaded with gold and silver trappings, the reins studded with precious stones, with jingling silver bells attached, and the stirrups wrought into artistic shapes in gilt silver. The poor followed the example of the rich, and resorted to amusing makeshifts to maintain an air of dignity and grandeur. The gentlemen who lived together in a boarding-house had a few suits of silk clothes between them in common. These they used by turns when they went out, and hired a man to hold an umbrella over them as they strutted through the streets.\n\nHolland, having thrown off the Spanish yoke, began to assert herself in the East. While our own East India Company was struggling into existence during the last years of Elizabeth, the Dutch were preparing to dispute with the Portuguese for the supremacy in the Indian Ocean. In 1603 they blockaded Goa. The attempt proved abortive; but it left behind it a struggle between the two nations, which, during the next seventy years, shattered and dismembered the Portuguese power in India. One by one, the Portuguese possessions fell into the hands of the Dutch; their fleets were captured, or driven within the shelter of their forts, and their commerce was swept from the seas. Goa suffered not only from these disasters, but also from a return of the fever which had afflicted the city in the preceding century. It broke out again in 1635, and raged for several years. Towards the end of this visitation, the Dutch once more blockaded Goa in 1639, but were again compelled to withdraw.\n\nA period of pride and poverty followed, during which the splendour of the previous century was replaced by shabby devices to conceal the decay that had blighted the Portuguese power. In 1648, Tavernier admired the architectural grandeur of Goa, but was struck with the indigence of several Portuguese families whom he had seen in affluence and prosperity during his first visit. He says that many who had six years previously enjoyed an ample income, were now reduced to the necessity of secretly begging alms. 'Yet they did not put aside their vanity. The ladies were particularly observed going in palanquins to seek charitable relief, attended by servants who conveyed their messages to the persons whose assistance they implored.' 'The city,' says Thevenot in 1666, 'is great and full of beautiful churches and convents, and well adorned with palaces. There were few nations in the world so rich as the Portuguese in India; but their vanity is the cause of their\nruin.' In 1675, Dr. Fryer described Goa as 'Rome in India'\u2014'looks well at a distance\u2014stands upon seven hills; everywhere colleges, churches, and glorious structures; but many houses disgracing it with their ruins.'\n\nThe Portuguese, indeed, were becoming unable to hold their capital even against the native banditti. In 1683 it narrowly escaped falling into the hands of Samb\u00e1j\u00ed at the head of his roving Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who plundered up to the very gates of the city. All hopes of resistance were abandoned, when a powerful Mughal force suddenly made its appearance from the Gh\u00e1ts, and compelled the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s to come to terms. This unexpected deliverance was ascribed to the miraculous interposition of St. Francis Xavier. Subsequently the Bhonsl\u00e1s from the State of S\u00e1wantw\u00e1di invaded the Goa territory; but though at the outset they obtained partial successes, they were eventually defeated by the Portuguese, who conquered from them the islands of Corjuem and Panelem, and destroyed their fortress at Bicholim. To defend the place against future inroads, the Viceroy, Vasco Fernandes Cesar de Minezes (1712-1717), built a fortress on the frontiers of B\u00e1rdez, and another at Ch\u00e1pora. During the administration of the Count of Sandomil (1732-41), the Portuguese became once more involved in a war with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and lost some of their most important possessions towards the north of Goa. In 1741 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s invaded the peninsulas of B\u00e1rdez and Salsette, and threatened the city of Goa itself. At the same time the Bhonsl\u00e1s availed themselves of the opportunity to overrun the settlement. At that critical period a new Viceroy arrived at Goa, the Marquis of Louri\u00e7al, bringing with him from Europe a reinforcement of 12,000 men. With this army he encountered and defeated the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at B\u00e1rdez with great slaughter, captured the celebrated fortress of Ponda and other minor forts, and compelled them to retire from Goa. He then marched against the Bhonsl\u00e1s, and forced them to sue for peace, making their chief, Khem S\u00e1want, a tributary of the Portuguese. Shortly afterwards, however, the Bhonsl\u00e1s renewed hostilities, but were defeated by the Marquis of Castello-Novo, who conquered Alorna (whence his later title), Tiracol, Neutim, Rarim, Sanquelim, or Sat\u00e1ri.\n\nIn 1750 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Bhonsl\u00e1s jointly attacked the fortress of Neutim, which they closely invested both by sea and land. The Viceroy, the Marquis of Tavora, hastened to the relief of the place with all his available forces, and compelled the enemy to raise the siege, after which he turned his arms against the King of Sunda, and captured the fortress of Piro (Sad\u00e1shivgarh). His successor, Count of Alva, prosecuted successfully for a time the war against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, but eventually lost Rarim and Neutim, and was killed at the siege of one of the fortresses which had fallen into the hands of the\nenemy. About this period, the Court of Lisbon sent peremptory orders to the Viceroy, Count of Ega, to restore the fortresses of Piro and Ximpem to the King of Sunda, and Bicholim, Sanquelim, and Alorna to Khem S\u00e1want II. Subsequently, however, the former allowed the Portuguese to possess themselves of Ponda, with the adjacent territory of Zambaulim, Cabo de R\u00e1ma, and Canacona, during the time that his dominions were invaded by Haidar Ali. After some years of repose, Khem S\u00e1want again attempted to disturb the Portuguese; but being defeated, had to surrender to them Bicholim, Sanquelim or Sat\u00e1ri, Alorna, and Pernem.\n\nThe decay of the capital had become so notorious that the Portuguese Government in Europe determined to rebuild it at a great cost. After a century of fruitless efforts and foolish expenditure, Old Goa still lay in ruins, and the remnants of the population drew themselves together at Panjim or New Goa, at the mouth of the river. The changes in the river itself had contributed to render Old Goa still more unhealthy than of old, and to make the navigation of its channels dangerous even for the comparatively small class of ships which the Portuguese employed. During the 18th century, the decayed settlement, instead of being a centre of military pomp and courtly display, had become a burden on the Home Government, and cost Portugal a considerable sum of money annually. It required a force of 2000 European soldiers to protect it from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; the privates receiving a miserable subsistence of rice and fish, and the captains drawing a salary of 6 rupees (12 shillings) a month. Such commerce as survived was in the hands of the Jesuits. This fraternity still preserved the traditions, and something of the energy, of the proselytizing era. Captain Hamilton, early in the 18th century, declared that he counted from a neighbouring hill nearly eighty churches and convents. He states the number of Roman Catholic priests at 30,000 for the city and settlement. The native merchants had been driven away by oppressions and insults; and during the first half of the last century, the Jesuits monopolized the remnants of the trade, which still clung to the capital. In 1739, when the territory was overrun by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the nuns and monks had streamed forth in panic to the refuge of Murmagao. Nevertheless, high offices and military commands were still lavished among the poverty-stricken remnants of the Portuguese in India. All the talk at Goa was about fine titles. 'A post which would be filled by a small tradesman everywhere else, needed a general.'\n\nFrom 1794 to 1815, the Government of Goa and other Portuguese Settlements in India received little attention from the Court of Lisbon, owing to various causes, the chief of which was the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by the French. To protect Goa against any contingency, an English auxiliary force was obtained to garrison the two\nfortresses commanding the port, until the general peace in Europe after\nthe battle of Waterloo. In 1817, the Viceroy, the Count of Rio Pardo,\nrepelled the inroads of the predatory forces from the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1di\nState, capturing the fortress of Uspa and Rarim. This Governor was,\nhowever, deposed in consequence of a revolution which took place in\nGoa in 1821. In 1835, a native of the place, named Bernardo Peres\nda Silva, was appointed Governor and Prefect of the Portuguese State\nof India by Dona Maria II., in reward for his adherence to the House\nof Braganza during the usurpation of Dom Miguel. But his reforms in\nGoa during the 17 days of his government ended in an \u00e9meute and his\nflight to Bombay.\n\nFor about sixteen years after this event, Goa was undisturbed\neither by external foes or internal dissensions, except a brief\nmilitary revolt, which resulted in the deposition of the Governor,\nLopez de Lima. During the administration of Pestana, in 1845, the\ndisturbances at S\u00e1wantw\u00e1di, and the shelter afforded at Goa to the\nrioters who had fled thither, threatened for a time to bring about a\nrupture with the British Government of Bombay. In 1852, the R\u00e1n\u00eds\nof Sat\u00e1ri, headed by Dip\u00e1ji, revolted. In 1871, a rebellion broke out\namong the native army at Goa, in consequence of the Portuguese\nauthorities making a stand against its exorbitant demands. To sup-\npress this insurrection, the Court of Lisbon despatched a reinforce-\nment, accompanied by the king's own brother, Dom Augusto. On the\nrestoration of peace, the native regiments that had revolted were dis-\nbanded, and the colony is now held by 313 Portuguese soldiers. The\nformer army has not been reorganized, as native regiments could only\nbe dangerous to the handful of European troops; and the peace\nmaintained throughout India by the British supremacy renders them\nunnecessary for any practical purposes.\n\nThe chief towns in the territory of Goa are\u2014Nova Goa or Panjim,\nwith 1185 houses, and a population of 8440 souls; Margao, 2522\nhouses, population 11,794; and Mapu\u00e7a, 2285 houses, population\n10,286.\n\nGoa City.\u2014The capital of the Portuguese territory of the same\nname; situated near the mouth of the river Mand\u00e1vi, in 15\u00b0 30' N. lat.,\nand 73\u00b0 57' E. long. Population of Old Goa (1881), 1882, dwelling in\n469 houses.\n\nGoa is properly the name of three cities, which represent three\nsuccessive stages in the history of Western India. The earliest of\nthe three was an ancient Hindu city, before the invasion of the\nMuhammadans; the second, known as Old Goa, was the first capital\nof the Portuguese, and is still the ecclesiastical metropolis of Roman\nCatholic India; the third, commonly called Panjim, is the present\nseat of Portuguese administration. The original city of Goa (Goa\nVelha), built by the Kadamb\u00e1s, was situated on the banks of the river Juary. No traces of buildings exist at this day. The next town of Goa (Velha Cidade de Goa), generally known to foreigners as Old Goa, situated about 5 miles to the north of the Hindu capital, was built by the Muhammadans in 1479, nineteen years before the arrival of Vasco da Gama in India. This famous city, conquered by Albuquerque in 1510, became the capital of the Portuguese Empire in Asia; as such it was once the chief emporium of commerce between the East and West, and enjoyed the same privileges as Lisbon. It reached the climax of its splendour during the 16th century; but with the decline of the Portuguese power in the following century, it began gradually to lose its significance in every respect, save as an ecclesiastical metropolis.\n\nThe frequent plagues by which the population was repeatedly thinned, together with the removal of the seat of Government to Panjim, and the suppression of the religious orders, contributed finally to effect its complete downfall. Instead of the 200,000 inhabitants which once formed its population, hardly 2000 poverty-stricken creatures remain to haunt the few ecclesiastical edifices still standing. Foremost among the surviving edifices is the Cathedral dedicated to St. Catherine by Albuquerque, in commemoration of his entry into Goa on the day of her festival. Built as a parochial church in 1512, it was reconstructed in 1623 in its present majestic proportions, having been about a century before elevated to the rank of a primatial see, which it has ever since retained. Service is regularly held every day by the Canons attached to the Cathedral. The Convent of St. Francis, originally a Muhammadan mosque, converted into a church by the Portuguese, was the first structure consecrated to Catholic worship in Goa. Its chief portal, curious as being the earliest of its kind in Portuguese India, has been preserved intact to this day, though the convent itself was rebuilt in 1661. The Chapel of St. Catherine was erected in 1551, on the site of the gate of the Muhammadan city through which Albuquerque entered. The Church of Bom Jesus, commenced in 1594, and consecrated in 1603, is a splendid edifice, enjoying a wide renown for the magnificent tomb holding the remains of the apostle of the Indies, St. Francis Xavier, the events of whose life are represented around the shrine. The Convent of St. Monica, commenced in 1606, and completed in 1627, was constructed for a community of nuns, now represented by a single venerable member. The Convent of St. Cajetan, erected in the middle of the 17th century by the order of the Theatines, is noted for its resemblance to St. Peter's at Rome, and is in excellent preservation.\n\nOf the other historical edifices with which Old Goa was formerly embellished, but few traces remain to give a conception of\ntheir pristine beauty and magnificence. The once renowned palace of the Viceroy's, the spacious custom-house, and many other public buildings, have been completely destroyed. The College of St. Roque, belonging to the order of Jesus, the Senate-house, the once famous Palace of the Inquisition, the Church of the Miraculous Cross, the College of St. Paul, the Hospital of St. Lazarus, the Church and Convent of St. Augustine, as well as the college of the same name close by, are all in ruins. The arsenal, the chapel of the Cinco Chagas (the Five Wounds), and the ecclesiastical jail, still remain standing in a dilapidated condition, but every year their walls yield to the crumbling finger of decay. The sites of the vanished buildings have been converted into cocoa-nut plantations, the ruins are covered with shrubs and moss, and the streets are overrun with grass. But though Old Goa has long since lost its civil importance, forming at present only a suburb of Panjim, its ecclesiastical influence as the See of the Primate of the East still remains; and, as long as it can boast of its noble monuments of Christian piety, and retains the shrine of the great Eastern evangelist, it will not cease to attract pilgrims from the most distant parts of the Catholic world.\n\nThe history of Goa has been very fully given in the preceding article. As far back as 1759, the ruin of the old city was complete. The governor changed his residence to Panjim, near the mouth of the river, and in the same year the Jesuits were expelled. With them went the last sparks of commercial enterprise. In 1775, the population, which at the beginning of the century had numbered nearly 30,000, was reduced to 1600, of whom 1198 were Christians. Goa remains in ruins to this day. Every effort to re-people it has failed, and Old Goa is now a city of fallen houses and of streets overgrown with jungle. Almost the only buildings which survive are the convents and churches, with miserable huts attached. In 1827, the Superior of the Augustinian Convent thus wrote: 'Il ne reste plus de cette ville que le sacre : le profane en est enti\u00e8rement banni.' The stately mansions and magnificent public buildings of Old Goa are now heaps of bricks covered with rank grass, and buried in groves of cocoa-nut trees. 'The river,' wrote Dr. Russell in 1877, 'washes the remains of a great city,\u2014an arsenal in ruins; palaces in ruins; quay walls in ruins; churches in ruins; all in ruins. We looked and saw the site of the Inquisition, the bishop's prison, a grand cathedral, great churches, chapels, convents, religious houses, on knolls surrounded by jungle. We saw the crumbling masonry which once marked the lines of streets and enclosures of palaces, dockyards filled with weeds and obsolete cranes.'\n\nNova Goa, the present capital of Portuguese India, comprehends Panjim, Ribandar, as well as the old city of Goa, and is 6 miles in extent. It is situated on the left bank of the river Mand\u00e1vi, at a distance of\nabout 3 miles from its mouth. The suburb of Ribandar is connected with the central quarter of Panjim by a causeway about 300 yards long, through which lies the main road leading to Old Goa. Panjim occupies a narrow strip, enclosed by the causeway on the east, the village of St. Ignez on the west, the river on the north, and a hill which walls it on the south. In the last century it was a miserable village, inhabited by a few fishermen dwelling in adjan huts, and remarkable only for the fortress built by Y\u00fasaf Adil Sh\u00e1h, which is now transformed into a viceregal palace. As in the case of Bombay city, the surface has been gradually formed by filling up hollows and reclaiming large tracts of marshy land. The present (1881) population, exclusive of Goa Velha, or Old Goa, is returned at 8440 persons, dwelling in 1185 houses.\n\nPanjim was selected as the residence of the Portuguese Viceroy in 1759; and in 1843 it was formally raised by royal decree to rank as the capital of Portuguese India. From the river, the appearance of the city, with its row of public buildings and elegant private residences, is very picturesque; and this first impression is not belied by a closer inspection of its neat and spacious roads bordered by decent houses. Of public structures, the most imposing are the barracks, an immense quadrangular edifice, the eastern wing of which accommodates the College or Lyceum, the Public Library, and the Professional Institute for teaching chemistry, agriculture, and other sciences. The square facing this wing is adorned by a life-size statue of Albuquerque standing under a canopy. The other buildings include the cathedral, the vice-regal palace, the high court, the custom-house, the municipal chamber, the military hospital, the jail, the accountant-general's office, and the post-office. For trade, etc., see pp. 94, 95.\n\nGo\u00e1l\u00e1nda.\u2014Sub-division of Far\u00eddpur District, Bengal; extending from 23\u00b0 31' to 23\u00b0 55' N. lat., and from 89\u00b0 22' to 89\u00b0 54' E. long. Area, 428 square miles; number of villages or townships, 1223; number of occupied houses, 47,287. Population (1881) 321,485, namely, males 163,433, and females 158,052. Hindus, 123,262; Muhammadans, 198,073; Christians, 137; and Buddhists, 13. Number of persons per square mile, 751\u00b713; villages per square mile, 2\u00b786; persons per village, 263; houses per square mile, 114; persons per house, 6\u00b78. Go\u00e1l\u00e1nda Sub-division includes the three th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles of Go\u00e1l\u00e1nda, Balyak\u00e1ndi, and P\u00e1ngs\u00e1. It contained in 1883, 2 civil and 2 criminal courts, with a regular police force of 71 officers and men, and a rural constabulary or village watch numbering 584.\n\nGo\u00e1l\u00e1nda.\u2014River mart and municipality in Far\u00eddpur District, Bengal; situated in 23\u00b0 50' 10\" N. lat., and 89\u00b0 46' 10\" E. long., at the confluence of the main streams of the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Fifteen years ago but a small fishing village, with an evil reputation for river dak\u00e1iti, Go\u00e1l\u00e1nda has now become one of the most important\ncentres of trade in Bengal, and has taken the place of Kushtia as the terminus of the Eastern Bengal Railway and the point of departure of the Assam steamers. The population of the town, which in 1872 was estimated at about 1000, had at the time of the Census of 1881 increased to 8652, namely 4508 Hindus, 4130 Muhammadans, and 14 'others.' Area of town site, 2364 acres. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3350, or at the rate of 9\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nThe modern career of Goalanda has not been without vicissitudes; and it is possible that the irresistible waywardness of the rivers, which have brought to it its prosperity, may again in a few years divert commerce to another direction. The town, which consists of little more than a railway station, a bazar, and a court-house, stands upon an alluvial tongue of land lying at the junction of two great river systems. During the cold weather, a temporary line of rail is laid down to the river bank, and the process of transhipping goods from steamer or boat to railway truck is conducted safely on the water's edge. But when the two rivers rise in flood about July, the operations of commerce are driven back inland. The river bank over which trains were running a few weeks before, becomes a boiling sea of waters, where even the steamers find a difficulty in making headway. At this season, the eye may look north or east over 3 or 4 miles of uninterrupted water. When a storm comes on, the native craft flee for shelter to various creeks. The railway extension from Kushtia to Goalanda was first opened in 1870; and up to 1875 the station stood upon an artificial embankment near the water's edge, protected by a masonry spur running out into the river. From first to last, about \u00a3130,000 was spent upon these protective works, and it was hoped that engineering skill had conquered the violence of the Gangetic flood. But in August 1875 the river rose to an unprecedented height. The solid masonry spur, the railway station, and sub-divisional offices were all swept away; and at the present time there is deep water over their site. A new terminus, which it was hoped would prove permanent, was afterwards erected about two miles from the river bank, but this was also soon afterwards washed away. The site of the terminus has frequently been changed owing to the shifting of the river channel, and none but temporary buildings are now erected.\n\nThe trade of Goalanda consists almost entirely in the transhipment of goods from river to rail. In addition to a large through traffic conducted direct with Assam, the agricultural produce of the surrounding Districts is here collected for despatch to Calcutta. In the year 1882, the value of the total trade, including both exports and imports, was returned at \u00a3788,981. The principal item is jute, of which 2,184,393 maunds were received during the year, valued at \u00a3436,878. The aggregate amount of oil-seeds (chiefly mustard) was 87,614 maunds,\nvalued at \u00a330,488; of food-grains (chiefly rice), 478,400 maunds, valued at \u00a399,578; of tobacco, 4578 maunds, valued at \u00a32299. The most important articles obtained in exchange from Calcutta are European piece-goods and salt. In 1882, the imports of cotton goods were valued at \u00a37700, entirely by rail; the importation of salt was 100,014 maunds, valued at \u00a335,005. The steamers of three companies touch at Go\u00e1l\u00e1nda, running to Assam, Sirajganj, Dacca, and Cachar; but the greater portion of the trade is still carried in country boats, of which it is estimated that 100,000 passed Go\u00e1l\u00e1nda in 1882. This number does not include the fleets of fishing boats, which add so much to the liveliness of the scene. A good deal of hilsa fish is exported to Calcutta, but not to such an extent as formerly, the fisheries being less productive. Only a small quantity is cured, the drawback duty of Rs. 2. 12. 0 a maund on salt formerly allowed by Government being now discontinued. The merchants of Go\u00e1l\u00e1nda are chiefly M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, locally called K\u00e1yas. There are also many Beng\u00e1li and Musalm\u00e1n traders. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r is held daily, and is largely frequented both by wholesale dealers and petty shopkeepers.\n\nGo\u00e1lp\u00e1ra.\u2014The most westerly District of the Province of Assam, forming the entrance to the upper valley of the Brahmaputra. It lies on both sides of the great river, extending from 25\u00b0 45' to 26\u00b0 54' N. lat., and from 89\u00b0 44' to 92\u00b0 14' E. long. It is bounded north by the mountains of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and south by the newly-formed District of the G\u00e1ro Hills. It contains an area of 3897 square miles; and the population, according to the Census of 1881, numbers 446,232 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Dh\u00fabri Town, situated on the right or north bank of the Brahmaputra.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The permanently-settled portion of the District (as distinguished from the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs portion, which is under the regular Assam land system of yearly settlements) occupies the narrow valley of the Brahmaputra, at the corner where the great river leaves Assam proper and turns due south to enter the wide plain of Bengal. It is very irregularly shaped, extending for only 65 miles along the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, and for 120 miles along its southern bank. The level land on the south bank forms but a narrow strip, in some parts not more than 8 miles across, being shut in by the ridges of the G\u00e1ro Hills. On the north, the cultivated plain gradually merges in the low jungle of the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs. The scenery throughout is of a striking character. Along the channel of the river grow dense clumps of cane and reed. Farther back, the wide expanses of rice cultivation are only broken by the fruit-trees surrounding the village sites. In the background rise forest-clad hills, crowned in the far distance by the snow-capped peaks of the Him\u00e1layas. The soil of the hills and of the higher ground consists of a red ochreous earth, interspersed with large\nblocks of granite and sandstone. The latter are subject to disintegration from exposure to the weather. In the plains, the soil is of alluvial formation, being either tenacious clay or clay more or less mixed with sand. Earthquakes are common in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and very severe shocks have occasionally been experienced.\n\nBesides the Brahmaputra, the three following tributaries of the great river on its northern bank are navigable for boats of considerable size throughout the year:\u2014The Man\u00e1s, Gad\u00e1dhar, and Gang\u00e1dhar or Sankos. These all rise in the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, and flow through the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs into Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. Several other minor streams become navigable during the rainy season. Alluvion and diluvion are continually taking place in the course of the Brahmaputra, as testified by the numerous islands and sandbanks that dot its broad channel. This river, also, annually inundates a large tract of country on both its banks; and the flood-water stands all the year long in the wide bils or marshes, some of which cover an area of from 6 to 12 square miles. In the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, the Government reserved forests form an important department of the administration, covering an area of 447 square miles. There are also valuable forests in private hands, estimated to yield about \u00a33000 a year to their proprietors. The financial results of the working of the Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 forests in 1880\u201381 showed a surplus of \u00a31233 of receipts over expenditure. Wild animals of all kinds abound in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, including tigers, rhinoceros, and buffaloes. It is on record that, about twenty-five years ago, more money was annually expended in rewards for the killing of wild animals than was realized from the land revenue. Even in the three years ending 1870, the average number of deaths from wild beasts and snake-bite averaged 116 annually. No coal or other minerals have been found in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, but the hills abound with large stones which might be utilized for building purposes.\n\nHistory.\u2014Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 has always formed the frontier between Bengal and Assam, and has participated to the full in the vicissitudes attending such a position. In the earliest times it must have constituted part of the legendary Hindu kingdom of K\u00e1m\u00e1r\u00fap, which is said to have extended from the head of the Assam valley far across the plains of Bengal to what are now the borders of Purniah District. The only remains of this period may perhaps be found in the ruined temple of Th\u00e1keswari. The next dynasty which can be localized in this region is that of the early Koch R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kuch Behar, whose empire was almost as extensive as that of the fabled K\u00e1m\u00e1r\u00fap. But it fell to pieces by subdivision in the generation after it was founded; and the present R\u00e1ja of Bijni, who owns a large samind\u00e1ri in the settled portion of the District, claims to be descended from a younger son of a Kuch Behar king, and to hold his lands as a royal appanage. About 1600 A.D., two armies of invaders were closing upon Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 from different\ndirections, and the divided kingdom could offer no resistance. From the east, the wild Ahams gradually spread down the valley of the Brahmaputra, to which they subsequently gave their own name of Assam; while, from the west, the Mughals pushed forward the limits of the Delhi empire and of the faith of Isl\u00e1m. The Muhammadans first appeared on the scene; and thus Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 was definitively assimilated to Eastern Bengal in administration and ethnical characteristics. It was in the year 1603, twenty-seven years after Bengal had been wrested from the Afgh\u00e1ns by Akbar's generals, that the Mughals first reached the Brahmaputra, and annexed the Assam valley as far as the present District of Darrang. But here they soon came into collision with the Ahams. After a decisive defeat in the neighbourhood of Gauh\u00e1ti, in 1662, Mfr Juml\u00e1, the well-known general of Aurangzeb, was obliged to retreat; and the Muhammadan frontier was permanently fixed at the town of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. At this place and at R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti, on the opposite bank of the Brahmaputra, military officers were stationed, among whose duties it was to encourage the growth of jungle and reeds, to serve as a natural protection against the inroads of the dreaded Ahams. About this time, also, the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs fell into dependence upon Bh\u00fat\u00e1n.\n\nThis was the position of affairs when the British obtained possession of the d\u00edw\u00e1n\u00ed of Bengal in 1765. The comparatively small extent to which the Mughals here assimilated their conquest may be judged from the fact that the Musalm\u00e1n element in the population of the District now amounts to 22 per cent., as against 51 per cent. in the neighbouring jurisdiction of Rangpur. Another significant feature in the Mughal administration of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 was the lightness of the revenue assessment. The land was left in the hands of border chieftains, whose residence in some cases lay beyond the recognised frontier, and who paid a merely nominal tribute. This system was stereotyped in the Permanent Settlement of 1793, by which the land revenue of the District was fixed in perpetuity at the trifling total of \u00a31170. At the present day, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is the paradise of great landlords. There are altogether only 19 estates in the permanently-settled tract; and it is estimated that the average rentals exceed the amount paid to Government by fifty-fold. The average rate of assessment throughout the settled portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is less than rd. per head of population, as compared with 1s. 5d. in Assam generally, and 1s. 2d. in Bengal.\n\nDuring the early years of British administration, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 was administered as an integral portion of Rangpur District; but in 1822 it was formed into an independent jurisdiction under a Commissioner. This step was taken with a view to establishing a special system of government over the G\u00e1ros and other wild tribes on the frontier. It was also thought desirable to place a European officer at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1\ntown, which was then the outpost station towards the disturbed frontier of Assam. This town had long occupied a peculiar position of commercial and political importance. So far back as 1788, a European merchant, Mr. Raush, who settled there, is stated to have despatched at his own charges an armed force of 700 men to assist the Assam Raj\u00e1 in quelling an insurrection of the Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1s; and as the opposite bank of the Brahmaputra lay within Assamese territory, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 had become a sort of free port for river traffic. After the conquest of Assam by the British in 1825, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District was immediately annexed to the new Province, though for revenue purposes the administration has always continued to be conducted in accordance with the Bengal Regulations. The Bh\u00fat\u00e1n war of 1864 brought about another change. The Dw\u00e1rs ceded by the Bhuti\u00e1s were attached partly to the newly-formed District of Jalp\u00e1guri and partly to Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1; and the whole tract, together with the State of Kuch Behar, was erected into the Kuch Behar Commissionership under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. But this severance was not of long duration. In 1868, the civil and criminal jurisdiction of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 was again transferred to the Judicial Commissioner of Assam; and in 1874, when Assam was constituted a Province independent of Bengal, the entire administration in all departments was included in the new Province. The Deputy Commissioner, as the chief European officer is now styled, exercises the powers possessed in Bengal by a Magistrate and Collector, and also those of a subordinate judge; while the functions of a civil and sessions judge rest with the Judge of the Assam Valley.\n\nPeople.\u2014Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, as forming part of the Bengal District of Rangpur, was included in the statistical survey conducted by Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton in the beginning of the present century. He estimated the total number of inhabitants at 176,000, within an area of 2915 square miles. There can be no doubt that the population has largely increased since that date. The regular Census of 1872, which was confined to the permanently-settled tract of 2571 square miles, disclosed a total population of 407,714 persons, dwelling in 1330 maus\u00e1ds or villages, and in 65,767 houses. The last Census in 1881, taken over the entire District, including the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, returned a population of 446,232 on an area of 3897 square miles, residing in 1225 villages and 87,362 inhabited houses; average density of population, 114\u00b75 per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b731; inhabitants per village, 364; inmates per house, 5\u00b711. Divided according to sex, the males numbered 229,149, and the females 217,083. Classified according to religion, persons professing Hinduism were returned at 329,066; Muhammadans, 104,777; Sikhs, 14; Christians, 513; Buddhists, 79; Jains, 39; Br\u00e1hmos, 32; and aboriginal hill tribes, 11,712.\n\nGenerally speaking, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 presents the ethnical aspects of a\nfrontier District, in which the hill tribes have been imperfectly assimilated by the Hindus. The aborigines of the Census Report are chiefly represented by the three kindred tribes of R\u00e1bh\u00e1, Mech, and K\u00e1ch\u00e1ri or Cachari, who are now returned as Hindus in religion. Next come the G\u00e1ros, numbering 11,710, who are immigrants from the neighbouring hills on the south, and are fully described in the article on the GARO HILLS DISTRICT. The great majority still hold their primitive aboriginal faiths, although an American Baptist Mission for G\u00e1ros has been established in the south of the District. The great bulk of the semi-Hinduized aborigines consists of the Kochs, who are properly an aboriginal tribe, akin to the K\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds and Mechs; but since the high position attained by the conquering R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kuch Behar, their tribesmen have been admitted within the pale of Hinduism under the high-sounding title of R\u00e1jbansi. The term 'Koch,' also, is vaguely used at the present time as applicable to all new converts made by the Br\u00e1hmans; and members of every rank in society may be found included in this caste. Among Hindus proper, the Br\u00e1hmans number 2970, and chiefly belong to the Vaidik sept, who are said to have migrated from Hindust\u00e1n at a remote period; the R\u00e1jputs number only 57; the K\u00e1yasths, 1733. By far the most numerous caste is the Jal\u00edy\u00e1 (19,230), whose occupation is that of fishermen, and who are supposed to be connected with the well-known Kaibarttas of Bengal. Next in number come the Kol\u00edt\u00e1s (11,299), a caste peculiar to Assam, who exercised priestly functions under the native dynasty before the advent of the Br\u00e1hmans. They now rank as pure Sudras, and are chiefly employed in agriculture. They are found in greater numbers in the Districts of Upper Assam.\n\nA branch of the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j was established by Bengali immigrants in 1868, but theistic principles have not made progress among the natives of the District. Mention is made of a peculiar sect called Mah\u00e1pur\u00fashiy\u00e1 Bhakat, whose members meet at night to eat flesh and drink wine. The Jains are represented by a few M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri traders from the north-west, settled at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 town. Of the Musalm\u00e1n population, a few of those residing in the towns have adopted the Far\u00e1izi or reforming creed, while many in the interior are described as scarcely differing from their Hindu neighbours in their rites and image-worship. The native Christians are mainly G\u00e1ros, dwelling on the southern boundary of the District, under the charge of the American Baptist Mission.\n\nThe population of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is entirely rural. There is only one place with more than 5000 inhabitants, GOALPARA TOWN, containing in 1881, 6697 inhabitants, which is the chief centre of trade. Dhubri is the present head-quarters of the District; and as the terminus in this direction of the Northern Bengal State Railway, is the principal point\nwhere passengers for Assam are taken on board the Brahmaputra river steamers. Gauripur, Bagribari, and Lakhipur possess a thriving trade in timber, and are the residences of wealthy zamind\u00e1rs.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The staple crop of the District is rice, which is not, however, cultivated so exclusively as in Upper Assam. The principal harvest is the haimantik, s\u00e1l\u00ed, or \u00e1man rice, sown on low lands about June, transplanted a month later, and reaped in mid-winter. Next in importance is the \u00e1us rice, sown about March on comparatively high lands, from which a second crop of pulses or oil-seeds can be taken later in the year, and reaped about July. B\u00e1o or long-stemmed rice is cultivated in marshes, being sown in March and reaped in October. Neither of these last two varieties is transplanted. Mustard is largely grown as an oil-seed on the chars and alluvial accretions in the bed of the Brahmaputra. The acreage under jute has rapidly increased in recent years, and this fibre, with oil-seeds, now furnishes the staple export from the District. The less important crops include many varieties of pulses and vegetables, wheat, sugar-cane, and p\u00e1n or betel-leaf. The estimated area under the different crops in 1880\u201381 is returned as follows. Rainy season crops\u2014Rice, 361,312 acres; other food-grains, 2143; jute, 74,425; cotton, 19,895; sugar-cane, 1742; tea, 342; and indigo, 500 acres. Dry season crops\u2014Wheat, 9765; other food-grains, 38,620; and oil-seeds, 61,198. Total cultivated area, 569,942 acres.\n\nManure, in the form of cow-dung, is used on \u00e1us or high lands, especially for the sugar-cane crop. Irrigation is only practised in the neighbourhood of the northern hills, where the villagers combine to divert the hill streams over their fields by means of artificial channels. Land is nowhere suffered to lie fallow all the year through; but, for the most part, only one crop in the year is taken off the same field. A fair out-turn from an acre of s\u00e1l\u00ed land would be 18\u00bd cwts. of unhusked paddy, worth about \u00a33; from an acre of \u00e1us land, 15 cwts. of paddy, worth about \u00a32, 8s. Under favourable circumstances, a second crop from either description of land might raise the total value of the annual out-turn to nearly \u00a34. As Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra (excepting the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs tract) is a permanently-settled District in accordance with the Regulations prevalent in Bengal, the rates of rent are not fixed by Government as in Assam proper, but vary on the estates of the several zamind\u00e1rs. According to official returns furnished in 1870, the rent paid for basti or homestead land varies, in the different parg\u00e1ns, from 3s. to 14s. an acre; for s\u00e1l\u00ed land, from 2s. 7d. to 6s. 3d.; and for \u00e1us land, from 1s. to 5s. The forms of land tenure resemble those in the neighbouring Districts of Bengal. Various classes of under-tenants intervene between the zamind\u00e1r and the actual cultivator of the soil; and in many cases the cultivator has no recognised interest in the\nland, but is merely a labourer paid by a certain proportion of the produce. The most numerous class of under-tenants with permanent rights are those styled jotd\u00e1rs: while praj\u00e1, \u00e1dhid\u00e1r, and chuk\u00e1nid\u00e1r are the common names for subordinate cultivators, the amount of whose service or remuneration varies in each case. Rights of occupancy are almost unknown.\n\nRates of wages have approximately doubled within the past twenty-five years. Ordinary labourers, when paid in cash, now receive from 14s. to 18s. a month; skilled artisans can earn as much as \u00a32. The price of food-grains has also risen greatly. In 1882-83, common rice sold at 4s. 9d. per cwt.\n\nThe District is not specially liable to any form of natural calamity. Blights, caused by worms and insects, have been known to occur; and in 1863 the country was visited by swarms of locusts. These visitations, however, have never been on such a scale as to affect the general harvest. Similarly, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is exposed to river floods, especially in the upper part of the District, where there is great need of protective embankments; but no inundation has ever produced a scarcity. Partial droughts are caused by deficiency of the local rainfall; but in such cases the sterility of the higher levels would be compensated by the increased area of marshy land brought into cultivation. If the price of common rice were to rise in January to 14s. a cwt., that should be regarded as a sign of approaching distress later in the year.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The manufactures of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 consist of the making of brass and iron utensils, gold and silver ornaments, the weaving of silk cloth, basket work, and pottery. It is said that in recent years the competition of the cheaper Bengal articles has seriously injured the local industries, which used to be of a highly artistic character and of honest workmanship. A speciality still remaining is the thagi or sardi, a silver tray occasionally inlaid with gold. Silk cloth is woven from the cocoons of the er\u00edd and mug\u00e1 worms. The former, which is the more domesticated variety of the two, is fed on the leaves of the castor-oil plant; the latter on the saola or s\u00fam tree. The silk of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is regarded as inferior in texture, but superior in durability, to that of Upper Assam. The cultivation and manufacture of tea has been introduced only recently into Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. In 1880 there were 342 acres under cultivation (including newly-opened gardens), with an estimated out-turn of 41,305 lbs., the average yield being 160 lbs. per acre of mature plant. None of the labourers employed were imported under contract from Bengal, although all the immigration traffic passes by way of Dhubri town.\n\nThe external commerce of the District is entirely conducted by means of the Brahmaputra, the chief centres of traffic being Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1\ntown, Dhubri, Jogighop\u00e2, and Singim\u00e2ri. The local trade is principally in the hands of M\u00e2rw\u00e2r\u00ee merchants from R\u00e2jput\u00e2na. It is carried on at permanent b\u00e2s\u00e2rs, weekly h\u00e2ts or markets, and periodical fairs held on the occasion of religious festivals. The chief exports from the District are mustard-seed and jute from the plains, and cotton, timber, and lac from the hills; there is also some export of silk cloth, india-rubber, and tea. The commodities received in exchange comprise rice, European piece-goods, salt and hardware, oil and tobacco.\n\nThe chief means of communication are the rivers, especially the Brahmaputra, which is navigated by steamers and the largest native boats all the year through. The Assam Trunk Road, running south of the Brahmaputra from a point opposite Dhubri to the K\u00e2mr\u00fbp border, is the mail route, and much travelled by foot passengers. The roads in the District are in fair order, and are now all in charge of District Committees, constituted under the Assam Local Rates Regulation of 1879. Dhubri, as already mentioned, is the terminus of the Northern Bengal State Railway, a daily communication being kept up with Kaunia on the T\u00eest\u00e2 by a service of small steamers, together with a tramway service between the T\u00eest\u00e2 and Dharla, and between the Dharla and the Brahmaputra. Communication within the District is composed of 500 miles of navigable rivers, 265 miles of first-class roads, 143 miles of second-class roads, and 76 miles of third-class roads.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870\u201371, the net revenue of Go\u00e2lp\u00e2r\u00e2 District (including the Eastern Dw\u00e2rs) amounted to \u00a318,309, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a34235, and the excise \u00a36225; the expenditure was \u00a320,266, or nearly \u00a32000 more than the revenue. The balance in the treasury is adjusted by the receipt of \u00a36770 from Kuch Behar, being the tribute of that State, which is still paid at Go\u00e2lp\u00e2r\u00e2. The total of the land revenue is extremely small, but it has increased somewhat since the annexation of the Eastern Dw\u00e2rs. By 1874\u201375 it had risen to \u00a36229, of which only \u00a31170 was obtained from the permanently-settled portion of the District. In 1880\u201381, while the total land revenue had risen to \u00a39391, that derived from the permanently-settled estates had slightly fallen to \u00a31141. It is curious to observe that, in the matter of excise, Go\u00e2lp\u00e2r\u00e2 clearly manifests its character of a border region. Under this item, the incidence of taxation is 3\u00bdd. per head of population, against 8\u00bdd. in Assam generally, and 2d. for the whole of Bengal. In 1880 there was 1 European officer stationed in the District, and 7 magisterial and civil and revenue courts were open. For police purposes, Go\u00e2lp\u00e2r\u00e2 is divided into 4 th\u00e2nds or police circles, with 15 outpost stations. In 1880 the regular police force consisted of 322 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a36062. There is a small municipal police\nforce of 6 men, and a chaukid\u00e1ri or rural force of 621 men, costing \u00a32787. There are two prisons in the District, one at Dhubri, with a daily average population in 1880 of 25\u00b730; and one at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra, with a daily average of 17\u00b789 inmates in the same year.\n\nEducation had not made much progress in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra until within late years. In 1856 there were only 15 schools in the District, attended by 194 pupils. By 1870, after a temporary decline, these numbers had increased to 31 schools and 862 pupils. The reforms of Sir G. Campbell, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the village schools or p\u00e1th\u00e1s\u00e1l\u00e1s, raised the total number of inspected schools in 1873 to 92, and of pupils to 2137; while by 1880 the schools had further increased to 96, and the pupils to 2355. The chief educational establishment is the Higher-Class English School at Dhubri. This school was formerly situated in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra town, but it fell into a declining state on the removal of the head-quarters station, and the number of pupils steadily decreased. Since the removal of the school to Dhubri, the attendance increased, and in March 1881 the school was better attended than for the five previous years. The American Baptist Mission is assisted by Government in maintaining a normal school and 9 p\u00e1th\u00e1s\u00e1l\u00e1s among the G\u00e1ros, who live on the southern boundary of the District.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra is divided into 2 Sub-divisions, including the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, and into 4 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, with 15 outpost stations. In the permanently-settled tract there are 17 pargan\u00e1s or fiscal divisions, with an aggregate of 19 estates, of which only 7 date from a period subsequent to the Permanent Settlement. The temporarily settled estates in the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, the engagements for which are made yearly with the actual cultivators, numbered in 1880\u201381 no less than 14,606. Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra town was constituted a municipality in 1875, under Act vi. of 1868. The average municipal income is about \u00a3400, of which the greater part is expended on sanitation.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainy season or monsoon lasts for five months, from the middle of May to the middle of October. It is succeeded by the cold weather, which is marked by heavy fogs during the early morning. The prevailing winds are easterly; but during the three months from March to May, hot winds occasionally blow from the west, and thunderstorms come up from the south-west. The mean annual temperature is returned at 75\u00b0 F. In 1880, the maximum recorded was 92\u00b79\u00b0 in the month of July; and the minimum, 49\u00b73\u00b0, in December. The average annual rainfall at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra town for the five years ending 1880\u201381 is 100\u00b746, and at Dhubri, 97\u00b754 inches. The rainfall in the latter year, however, was only 72\u00b766 inches at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra, and 62\u00b766 inches at Dhubri.\nGo\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District is considered very unhealthy both for Europeans and natives, especially during the rainy season. The whole country round Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 town is charged with malarious exhalations. The prevalent diseases are\u2014intermittent and remittent fevers, complicated with affections of the spleen; diarrhoea, dysentery, rheumatism, and chest affections. Epidemic outbreaks of cholera are frequent, and small-pox annually appears, owing to the popular custom of inoculation. The vital statistics for 1881 returned a registered death-rate of 13\u00b772 per thousand, but this is admittedly below the truth. Out of a total of 5855 deaths, 4840 were assigned to fevers, 57 to cholera, 87 to small-pox, and 389 to bowel complaints. There are 4 charitable dispensaries in the District, which were attended in 1881 by 353 indoor and 5121 out-door patients; the total expenditure was \u00a3608.\n\nGo\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam; containing a population (1881) of 164,222 persons, residing in 563 villages or towns, and 36,092 houses. Hindus numbered 137,903; Muhammadans, 15,420; and \u2018others,\u2019 10,899. The Sub-division comprises the 2 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and S\u00e1lm\u00e1ra. It contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; a regular police force of 94 officers and men, besides 264 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\nGo\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 Town.\u2014Chief town and formerly head-quarters station of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam; situated on the south or left bank of the Brahmaputra. Lat. 26\u00b0 11' N., long. 90\u00b0 41' E. Population (1881) 6697, namely, males 4330, and females 2367. Hindus numbered 4151; Muhammadans, 2373; and \u2018others,\u2019 173. Municipal income in 1882\u201383, \u00a3253; incidence of taxation, 9d. per head of population. Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is said to derive its name from a colony of Hindu Go\u00e1l\u00e1s or cowherds who settled here in early times. It was the frontier outpost of the Muhammadans in the direction of Assam, and afterwards a flourishing seat of trade before the British annexed that Province. In 1788, the name of a Mr. Raush appears as a merchant settled here, who sent a force of 700 armed guards to assist the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Assam against his revolted subjects. The civil station is built on the summit of a hill, rising 260 feet above the plain, which commands a magnificent view over the valley of the Brahmaputra; bounded north by the snow-capped Him\u00e1layas, and south by the G\u00e1ro Hills. The native town is situated on the western slope of this hill, and the lower portions of its area are subject to inundations from the marshy land which stretches all around. The town is regularly laid out, but the houses are almost all made of wooden posts, mats, and thatch, so that destructive fires are of frequent occurrence. Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is still an important centre of river trade, but Dhubri is now the depot for the timber floated down from the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs. In 1876\u201377, the imports from Bengal included 153,400 maunds of rice, 97,400 maunds of salt, and\nEuropean piece-goods valued at \u00a364,700. Communication is main-\ntained with Dhubri on the opposite bank of the Brahmaputra, about 50\nmiles distant, by the Assam Trunk Road, and by a steam service branch\nof the Northern Bengal State Railway.\n\n**Gobardanga.**\u2014Town and municipality in the north of the District\nof the Twenty-four Parganas, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 52' 40\" N., long. 88\u00b0\n47' 55\" E.; situated on the eastern bank of the Jamuna. Population\n(1881) 6154, namely, Hindus, 4264; and Muhammadans, 1890. Area\nof town site, 1920 acres. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3390; rate\nof taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head of population. Police force, 18 men.\nEnglish school, branch dispensary. Export of jute, molasses, and\nsugar. Tradition points out this village as the spot where Krishna\ntended his flocks.\n\n**Gobardhan.**\u2014Ancient town and place of pilgrimage in Muttra\n(Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 29' 55\" N.,\nlong. 77\u00b0 30' 15\" E.; lies among the low rocky hills on the western\nfrontier. Noticeable only for its antiquarian remains, which include\u2014the\nsacred tank of Manasi Gang\u00e1, where the pilgrims bathe at the close\nof the rains; the temple of Hari Deva, erected during Akbar's reign\nby R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s of Ambar, governor of the Punjab; the two\ncenotaphs of Randhir Singh and Baldeva Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bharatpur, who\ndied in 1823 and 1825; and the monument of Suraj Mall, erected by\nJawahir Singh, his son, soon after his death at Delhi in 1764. The\nlast-named memorial comprises three cenotaphs, nine kiosks, and a\nlarge garden with an artificial lake.\n\n**Gobardhangiri.**\u2014Fortified hill on the frontier between Shimoga\nDistrict, Mysore State (latitude 14\u00b0 9' N., longitude 74\u00b0 43' E.), and the\nMadras District of South K\u00e1nara, commanding the old pass that leads\nby the famous Falls of Gersoppa. Annually traversed by 50,000 pack-\nbullocks. The fort is in fair repair, but abandoned.\n\n**Gobindpur.**\u2014Sub-division of M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal. \u2014 See\nGovindpur.\n\n**Gobra.**\u2014Solitary village in the Khulna portion of the Sundarbans,\nBengal. Cited as a proof that this tract was once inhabited. Ruins of\nmasonry buildings still exist; but embankments alone prevent Gobra\nfrom being washed away by the Kabadak.\n\n**Gobra.**\u2014Village in R\u00e1ipur tahsil, R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces.\nPopulation (1881) 2368, namely, Hindus, 2097; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 111;\nSatn\u00e1m\u00eds, 146; Muhammadans, 13; and Jain, 1.\n\n**Godagari.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle, R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed\nDistrict, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 28' N., long. 88\u00b0 21' 33\" E.; situated in the\nextreme west of the District, on the banks of the Ganges. An important\ntrading village, with a considerable river traffic with the North-Western\nProvinces.\nGod\u00e1vari.\u2014British District of the Madras Presidency. Lies between 16\u00b0 15' and 17\u00b0 35' N. latitude, and between 80\u00b0 55' and 82\u00b0 38' E. longitude. Area, 7345 square miles, inclusive of the Agency Tract, which comprises 820 square miles. Population (according to the Census of 1881) 1,791,512, including 10,899 inhabitants of the Agency Tract. Bounded on the north by the Bast\u00e1r State of the Central Provinces and by Vizagapatam District; on the north-east by Vizagapatam District; on the east and south by the Bay of Bengal; on the south-west by Kistna District; and on the west by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions. In point of size God\u00e1vari District ranks tenth among the Districts of the Madras Presidency, and in point of population seventh. The plains are divided into 10 Government taluks, area 6635 square miles; and there are 3 zamind\u00e1ri divisions in the hilly portion, with an area of 710 square miles. The two taluks of Bhadrachalam and Rekapalle, whose area is 911 square miles, were transferred to this District from the Central Provinces in 1874. These, together with the Rampa country, are included in the Agency Tract under the Collector of God\u00e1vari. In 1881 the District contained 2249 inhabited villages, including 13 towns. Land revenue, \u00a3461,011; gross revenue, \u00a3641,744. Administrative head-quarters and chief town, Cocanada.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is divided into two parts by the God\u00e1vari river. At Dowlaisvaram, 30 miles inland, the river separates into two main branches, enclosing the taluk of Amal\u00e1pur, the central delta of the river. The eastern delta comprises the taluk of R\u00e1m\u00e1chandrap\u00far with the zamind\u00e1ri of Cocan\u00e1da; the western, the taluks of Nar\u00e1pur, Bh\u00edmavaram, and Tan\u00faku. These deltas are flat, in some places even marshy. They present a vast and unbroken expanse of rice cultivation, dotted by villages, and varied only by clusters of palmyra, cocoa-nut or betel-nut palms, and mango groves. North of the delta the land gradually undulates, and the horizon is broken by scattered conical hills. Farther north, the hills come closer together, and are thickly covered with jungle; but there is no real range of mountains met with till the long broken table-land of Papikonda (2709 feet) is reached. Here the God\u00e1vari river is completely shut in by hills, forming a magnificent gorge, in some places only 200 yards wide; whereas the river attains a breadth of about 3 miles at Raj\u00e1mahendri (Rajahmundry), 50 miles lower down. The hills in all parts of the District are covered with jungle more or less dense. They are never quite inaccessible, but the numerous blocks of gneissic rock with which they are strewn render the construction of any road through or over them almost impossible. Teak is found here and there, and some of the higher hill ranges are covered with clumps of the feathery bamboo.\n\nThe only navigable rivers of the District are the God\u00e1vari and the\nSABARI, which joins the former at Vaddigudem in Rekapalle tdluk. The God\u00e1vari has seven mouths, viz. the Tulyabh\u00e1ga, the Atreya, the Gautami, the Vruddhagautami, the Bharadwajam, the Kausika, and the Vasishtha. The large town of Nars\u00e1pur is situated at the mouth of one of the two main branches, the French Settlement of Yan\u00e1on at the mouth of the other. Thirty miles up the river is the famous Dowlaishvaram anicut; 4 miles farther on, the town of R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (Rajahmundry). Northwards still, is the picturesque island of P\u00e1tapatteshim, covered with pagodas, and a favourite resort of pilgrims; and close to it, the timber market of Pol\u00e1varam. The shipbuilding trade of the District is carried on at Tallarevu, on the Coringa branch of the river. Owing to the volume of the God\u00e1vari, and the quantity of silt brought down by it, not only the islands of the river (termed lankas), but the sea-coast itself, are continually changing in form. Each of the seven mouths of the river is deemed holy, and the God\u00e1vari is one of the 12 rivers of India at which the feast of Pushkaram is celebrated. The bed of the God\u00e1vari, at the point where it enters the District, is sandy; but gradually turns into alluvial mould in its course through the delta. The only lake of importance is the Koleru, which is studded with islands and fishing villages. Sea-fishing is carried on along the coast. Building and lime stone are found in abundance in the uplands, and iron is smelted in small quantities. The forest tracts are those of Rampa, Yem\u00e1gudem, Juddangi, Dutsarti, Guditeru, and Bhadr\u00e1chalam. Chief jungle products\u2014myrabolans, soap-nuts, tamarind, bamboo-rice, honey, and beeswax. The wild animals comprise the tiger, leopard, hy\u00e6na, bison, nilgai, sambhar, wild-boar, antelope, deer, wolf, and bear. Game birds are plentiful.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present District of God\u00e1vari formed part of what is known as the Andhra division of the Dr\u00e1vida country; the tract to the north-west of the river having probably been part of the kingdom of Kalinga, and more or less subject to the Orissa kings; while the south-western tract belonged to the Vengi kingdom, and owed allegiance to the Ganapatis of Warangal. The District formed for centuries a battle-field, on which the Ch\u00e1lukyas, Narapatis, the Reddi-war chiefs, and the aboriginal hill tribes, fought with varying success, until the arrival of the Muhammadans in the beginning of the 14th century. After a struggle lasting a century and a half between the Hindu chiefs and the Musalm\u00e1n invaders from the west and north, the contest ended in the subjugation by the latter of nearly the whole of this District (1471-77). Subsequently, Krishna R\u00e1ya, the King of Vijayanagar, overran the country in 1516, and for a time restored the ancient Hindu kingdom. Lesser Hindu chiefs temporarily asserted and maintained their independence; but the whole of the country\nmay be regarded as having passed under Muhammadan domination from the commencement of the 16th century. In 1687, the rule of the Kutab Sh\u00e1hi kings was succeeded by that of the Delhi Mughals; Aurangzeb, after a long struggle, having succeeded in overthrowing the independent Bij\u00e1pur and Golconda dynasties. Thenceforward the District became known as the Naw\u00e1bship of R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (Rajahmundry) in the Subahat of Golconda, under the governorship of the Niz\u00e1m, Asaf Jah. From the death of Asaf Jah in 1748, commenced the struggles between the English and the French in the Deccan and Karn\u00e1tic, which terminated in the final overthrow of the French power in the East. By 1753, God\u00e1vari had become a French Province, but in that year it was overrun by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, then at the zenith of their power.\n\nLong anterior to this, the English, French, and Dutch had placed factories within the District. The English settled at Masulipatam in 1611, the Dutch in 1660, and the French in 1679; in 1686, the Dutch seized the administration of the town. The English opened factories at Pettapalam, Vir\u00e1vasaram, and Madapolliem in the 17th century, at Injeram, and Bandam\u00farlanka early in the 18th; the Dutch held P\u00e1lakollu, Nars\u00e1pur, and Cocan\u00e1da in 1650; the French occupied YANAON a century later (1750). In 1756, the French captured without resistance the English factories at Madapolliem, Bandam\u00farlanka, and Injeram; but Lally's ill-advised recall of Bussy to aid him in the Karn\u00e1tic in 1758 soon put an end to the French domination in the Northern Circars. In the latter year, Colonel Forde's expedition (consisting of 500 Europeans, 2000 sepoys, and 100 lascars) marched into the District, and in December completely routed the French army under Bussy's successor, the Marquis de Conflans, at Condore.\n\nThe battle of Condore (Chandurti) was the most important ever fought in the District. The English forces have been enumerated: those of de Conflans were 500 Europeans, 6000 sepoys, and a great number of local troops, including 500 cavalry. The fortune of the day, at one time adverse to Colonel Forde, was turned by the precipitous pursuit of the French after the English sepoys, while the whole European battalion, hitherto concealed behind the lofty stalks of an Indian corn-field, seized the opportunity and moved out to the attack. The French were taken by surprise. Thirty pieces of ordnance were captured, and 6 French officers, with 70 men, were killed. M. de Conflans galloped to R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (40 miles), and reached the town at midnight without having drawn rein. The battle resulted in releasing the Northern Circars from French dominion. It was followed by the capture of Nars\u00e1pur and Masulipatam, which practically left the Circars (including what now forms God\u00e1vari District) in English hands,\u2014a state of things confirmed by Imperial Sanad in 1765. Until 1823\nthe Company paid an annual tribute to the Niz\u00e1m for the Northern Circars. In that year it was commuted for a lump payment of \\(1\\frac{3}{4}\\) l\u00e2khs (\u00a3117,500).\n\nTill 1794 this new acquisition of the East India Company was administered on the old system, namely, by a Chief and Provincial Council. As that arrangement was not found satisfactory and proved unequal to the suppression of risings, such as those in Polavaram and G\u00fat\u00e2la (1785\u20131787), a system of Collectories was adopted; and three of these, under a principal Collector at Masulipatam, nearly represented the present God\u00e1vari District. In 1793, Lord Cornwallis had permanently settled Bengal, and it was believed that a permanent settlement might also be with advantage applied to Madras. The Madras Government expressed its willingness to see the system introduced into the Northern Circars, although even there a great part of the country was held directly by the State. As in the case of Bengal, Lord Cornwallis formally reserved to Government the right of passing any laws which might be considered expedient for the protection of the ray\u00e2ts. From 1794 till 1802\u20133, when the Permanent Settlement was introduced, the history of the District is one continuous struggle with recusant zam\u00eend\u00e2rs. The Settlement, owing to insufficient knowledge, was unequal in its incidence, and consequently unsuccessful. Constant sales, lawsuits, and distraints were the result. The downfall of the proprietary estates, of small and large zam\u00eend\u00e2rs alike, was equally rapid and equally sad. The failure of the system was pointed out by Sir Thomas Munro in 1822; but it was not till 1843, after several seasons of famine, distress, and steady decline in wealth and population (the latter decreased 30 per cent. in twenty years), that Sir Henry Montgomery was appointed to inquire and report. The reforms instituted on his representations practically put an end to the Permanent Settlement in this District. In thirty years the population has doubled; and, thanks to the splendid system of navigable irrigation works, the agriculture and commerce of the District are now in a most prosperous condition. In 1859 the boundaries were readjusted, and the three Districts of Gunt\u00fbr (Guntoor), R\u00e1j\u00e2mahendri (Rajahmundry), and Masulipatam became the present Districts of Kistna and God\u00e1vari. In 1874, the t\u00e2luks of Bhadr\u00e1chalam and Rekapalle were transferred to this District from that of Upper God\u00e1vari in the Central Provinces; and in 1881, the hill muttahs of Dutsarti and Guditeru from Vizagapatam District.\n\nPopulation has increased largely of late years. In 1856, the number of inhabitants was returned at 1,081,703; in 1861, at 1,366,831; in 1871, at 1,592,939; while in 1881 the number had risen to 1,719,512, on an area, inclusive of Bhadr\u00e1chalam and Rekapalle, of 7345 square miles, and occupying 319,733 houses. Males numbered 888,969, females 902,543; proportion of females to males (in the plains) in every\n1000 of the population, 504 to 496. In point of density, Godavari District ranks ninth among the Districts of the Madras Presidency, the number of persons per square mile being 234, but excluding the agency tracts, 273. The population per house, exclusive of Bhadrachalam and Rekapalle, is 5\u00b76. Classified according to religion, there were 1,748,734 Hindus, or 97\u00b76 per cent. of the total population; 38,798 Muhammadans, or 2\u00b72 per cent.; 3893 Christians; 17 Jains; and 70 \u2018others.\u2019 Of children under 10 years there were 251,926 boys and 252,322 girls, total 504,248. Between the ages of 10 and 20 there were 190,300 males and 168,638 females, total 358,938. The classification according to caste showed the Hindu population to be distributed as follows: Br\u0101hmans, 89,412; Kshatriyas (warriors), 46,661; Shettis (traders), 43,171; Vell\u0101lars (agriculturists), 535,854; Idaiyars (shepherds), 66,151; Kamm\u0101lars (artisans), 35,678; Kanakkans (writers), 4306; Kaikalars (weavers), 71,776; Vanniyans (labourers), 56,424; Kushavans (potters), 13,240; S\u0101t\u0101ni (mixed castes), 17,078; Shembadavans (fishermen), 3702; Sh\u0101n\u0101ns (toddy-drawers), 161,268; Ambattan (barbers), 19,011; Vann\u0101ns (washermen), 45,631; Pari\u0101hs, 423,218; \u2018others,\u2019 116,153. The distribution of the total population by occupation was as follows:\u2014Class I., or professional, 21,092, or 1\u00b718 per cent.; Class II., or domestic, 8275, or 0\u00b746 per cent.; Class III., or commercial, 27,931, or 1\u00b756 per cent.; Class IV., or agricultural, 513,451, or 28\u00b766 per cent.; Class V., or industrial, 191,613, or 10\u00b769 per cent.; and Class VI., or indefinite and non-productive, 1,029,150, or 57\u00b745 per cent., of whom 6\u00b709 were occupied. About 48 per cent., or a little less than half the population, were returned as workers, while the remaining 51\u00bd were dependent on them. Of the males 65\u00b762 per cent., and of the females 31\u00b789 per cent., were workers. Excluding the hilly portion of the District, there were educated, or under instruction, 76,026 persons, of whom 3846 were females. Only 8\u00b717 per cent. of the male population, and 0\u00b743 per cent. of the female, were returned as educated. The Christian population consists of 250 Europeans, 412 Eurasians, 2582 native Christians, and 649 Christians whose nationality was not stated; total, 3893. Of these, 921 were Baptists, 1011 Protestants, 602 Roman Catholics, 5 followers of the Greek Church, 61 Lutherans, 12 belonged to the Church of Scotland, and 420 to the Church of England. The creed of 861 was not returned. The following are the principal towns of the District:\u2014Ellore, 25,092; Rajamahendri, 24,555; Cocanada, 28,856; Pithapuram, 11,693; Peddapuram, 11,278; Dowlaisvaram, 8002; Amalapuram, 8623; Narsapur, 7184; Palakollu, 7510; Attili, 7080; Achanta, 6568; Kapileswarapuram, 5067; Mandapeta, 5914; Velpuru, 6282; Nagavaram, 5839; Chamarlakotta, 4962; Coringa, 4398; Sanavarapeta, 3200; Relangi,\nGODAVARI.\n\n5058; Attaravadi, 5747; Palekuru, 5141; Perur, 5264; Mumidivaram, 5409; and Palevellla, 5561. Besides these there are 136 towns and villages of over 2000 inhabitants. Under Act iii. of 1871, three towns were constituted municipalities, viz. Ellore, Rajamahendri, and Cocanada, with an aggregate population of 78,503; total municipal income (1881), \u00a35910, or at the rate of 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head of municipal population. The municipal income in 1882 was \u00a37084. Coringa, Cocanada, and Narsapur are the ports of the District. The two first-named places are the two principal ports on the eastern seaboard of India. Telugu, spoken by 1,727,733 persons, is almost the only language of the District.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The total area of the District, including recent transfers, is 7345 square miles, of which (in 1881\u201382) 2914 square miles, or 1,865,328 acres, were Government land; inam lands occupied 448,495 acres. Of the Government land, 605,238 acres were under cultivation, 433,986 acres were cultivable, 417,831 acres were pasture and forest lands, and 408,273 acres uncultivable waste. The total area assessed was 827,771 acres, bearing a total assessment of \u00a3162,075. The remaining area is comprised in the samindari estates (for which no detailed information exists), or is forest land. In 1882\u201383, the total area assessed was 865,673 acres, the amount of assessment being \u00a3164,181. This area was Government land exclusive of inams. Of the cultivated Government area (1881\u201382), cereals occupied 697,681 acres; pulses, 66,904 acres; orchards and garden produce, 28,021 acres; tobacco, 8803 acres; condiments and spices, 13,282 acres; sugar-cane, 5762 acres; oil-seeds, 133,692 acres; indigo, 1677 acres; and fibres, 18,250 acres.\n\nThe Imperial and minor irrigation works of the District consisted, in 1881\u201382, of 85 large and 928 minor tanks, which irrigated a total area of 107,738 acres, realizing a water revenue of \u00a324,891. By far the greater portion of the cultivated land is under rice. The chief crops of the District are:\u2014(1) Cereals\u2014(a) rice transplanted (white paddy), five varieties, sown in May and July, and reaped in November and January; two other sorts are sown in June and reaped in October; all these crops are grown on irrigated land; (b) black paddy, sown in June, and harvested in October; (c) cholam, sown in June and reaped in November and January; (d) ragi, sown in May and June, and reaped in September; these last are grown on dry lands: (2) Green crops\u2014(a) gram (4 varieties), sown in December and reaped in February; (b) red-gram, sown in June and reaped in December: (3) Fibres\u2014(a) cotton, sown in October and gathered in March; (b) jute, and (c) hemp, sown from June to August, and harvested from September to January; these are grown on dry land. The District\nalso produces large quantities of gingelly, tobacco, sugar-cane, and indigo.\n\nThe land on which tobacco is grown consists for the most part of alluvial islands lying within the banks of the God\u00e1vari river, called lank\u00e1s, which are generally flooded every year. The soil of these islands, in the low parts, is covered with deep layers of coarse sand, and in other parts varies from a light friable loam to a stiff loam. The former, being composed of the finer parts of the silt brought down by the river, is the best for tobacco, though it seems to be grown on any part of the lank\u00e1s almost indifferently. It is grown even on coarse sand, provided that it is not too deep, and that there is a layer of good soil not more than a foot or so below the surface. The seed is sown about September or October, in seed-beds which are very carefully prepared, cleaned, and heavily manured, the land being frequently stirred with the native plough until a good depth of loose mould is formed. The amount of seed allowed is 1 lb. for 8 acres, or 2 oz. per acre; and at the time of sowing it is mixed with fine sand in the proportion of 1 to 16, and sown broadcast over the area of the seed-beds. The beds are thereafter watered lightly three or four times a day for some time, and the plants come up in a week after sowing. The preparation of the tobacco ground begins after the last freshes have passed down the river. The plants are then transplanted into holes 2 to 3 feet apart, and are watered by hand from pots daily for a month or more. The leaf, after being cured, is exported to British Burma to be manufactured into cigars. The leaf is cured after the crude native method; but if a higher class of cured leaf could be turned out by persons properly trained to the work, the tobacco of the lank\u00e1s would command a good price in European markets.\n\nGreat improvement has taken place of late years in the quality of the rice and other food-grains raised in the District, owing to the extension of irrigation by canals. A farm 100 acres in extent is considered a large holding for an agriculturist, one of about 30 acres a middling-sized one, and one of 5 acres a very small one. Government tenants have a permanent right of occupancy in their lands so long as they pay the Government demand. In zamind\u00e1ri estates, on the other hand, the cultivators are mostly yearly tenants. A few holders of service lands cultivate their fields for themselves without assistance. A number of landless day-labourers are employed in cultivation, paid sometimes in money, and sometimes at a fixed rate in grain, but never by a regular share in the crop. The agricultural stock of the District, in 1881\u201382, comprised 88,289 buffaloes, 171,932 bullocks, 110,737 cows, 70 horses, 2320 ponies, 3125 donkeys, 101,162 sheep and goats, 30,468 pigs, 1131 boats, 7815 carts, and 100,674 ploughs. The prices ruling in the District in the same year, per maund of 80 lbs., were as follow:\u2014for\nrice, 4s.; for ragi (Eleusine coracana), 2s.; for cholam (Sorghum vulgare), 2s.; for kambu (Panicum spicatum), 2s. 2d.; for maize, 3s. 5d.; for wheat, 6s. 4d.; for gingelly, 6s. 1\u00bdd.; for oil-seeds, 5s.; for gram, 2s. 6d.; for tobacco, 25s. 6d.; for sugar, 28s. 7d.; for flax, 8s.; for cotton, 7s. 1\u00bdd.; and for sheep, 4s. 1d. each. Wages have doubled since 1850. A carpenter, smith, or bricklayer now (1882) earns from 10d. to 1s. a day, and an agricultural labourer from 3\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. Women employed in weeding and transplanting are paid at from one-half to two-thirds of the rates for men, while children receive a yet lower rate.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014God\u00e1vari District was formerly liable to severe floods caused by a sudden rising of the river, but these are now controlled by the embankments. No great famine has occurred since 1833. In that year, a famine caused by want of rain lasted from March to September, and numbers of the inhabitants fled the District. Private charity was widely extended, but no relief works were opened. Pressure from high prices was also experienced in 1876\u201377; but the mass of the people being themselves cultivators, and irrigation being abundant, the distress did not require extraordinary relief.\n\nMeans of Communication, Manufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014The District is well supplied with means of communication by 692 miles of good road, 511 miles of canals, and 352 miles of communication by river. Principal manufactures\u2014cotton and woollen carpets, woollen blankets, Upp\u00e1da cloths and sugar; chiefly conducted by the people on their own account. Indigo manufacture is also carried on by natives. The chief articles of trade are grain, cotton, jaggery, turmeric, cocoa-nut, flax cloth, onions, garlic, lace cloth, tobacco, gingelly seed, lamp-oil seed, salt, tamarind, cattle, teakwood, hides, opium, indigo, etc. The commerce of God\u00e1vari District has been rapidly increasing. The largely augmented area under cultivation since the completion of the great God\u00e1vari anicut, and the system of water communication in the Delta and with the adjoining District of Kistna, have applied an impetus to trade. Cocan\u00e1da is the port through which the new trade must flow, and it is possible that an attempt will be made to remove the bar of accumulated silt that now forms the obstacle to a good harbour. The lighthouse at Cocan\u00e1da was erected in 1865. Many of the native craft that enter the port hail from the Maldive Islands. The trade is carried on along the coast and in large towns and ports by means of permanent markets, and in almost all other places by fairs. The principal seats of commerce are Cocan\u00e1da, Ellore, R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri, Mandapetta, Jaggampetta, Hasanbada, Nars\u00e1pur, Pal\u00e1kollu, Dowlaishvaram, Ambajipetta, Jagann\u00e1thpur. The estimated value of imports in 1881\u201382 was \u00a3219,931, exclusive of treasure, which amounted to \u00a364,511. Estimated value of exports, \u00a31,247,330, exclusive of \u00a375,000 of treasure.\nAdministration.\u2014The Government revenue has steadily increased. In 1860\u201361, the first year after the present District was constituted, the total revenue amounted to \u00a3421,246, and the expenditure on civil administration to \u00a348,017. In 1870\u201371, the revenue was \u00a3531,043, and the civil expenditure \u00a323,368. By 1881\u201382, the revenue had reached \u00a3641,744, while the expenditure was \u00a328,362. The principal items of Imperial revenue are land, which yielded in 1881\u201382, \u00a3461,011; excise, \u00a343,931; assessed taxes, \u00a32819; customs, \u00a34544; salt, \u00a387,065; and stamps, \u00a335,353. For the protection of person and property, there were in 1881\u201382, 29 magisterial and 19 revenue and civil courts in the District. The regular police and municipal police force in 1881 numbered 1469 officers and men, costing \u00a321,528, and showing a proportion of 1 policeman to every 5 square miles of the area, and to every 1219 of the population. In 1881\u201382, there were 915 schools, with 25,435 pupils; of these schools 681 were maintained or supported by the State. There were also 1091 indigenous schools, with 27,607 pupils. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Cocan\u00e1da; but the Judge\u2019s court and the District jail are at R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri. Daily average number of prisoners in 1881 in R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri Central Prison, 958; and in the District jail, 162; expenditure for the year\u2014Central Prison, \u00a37064; District jail, \u00a31201: total, \u00a38265.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The prevailing endemic diseases of God\u00e1vari District are beri-beri and fevers. Beri-beri is a rheumatic affection attended with dropsical swelling. Among Europeans its occurrence is very rare. It is more prevalent on the coast than inland. There is both an acute and a chronic form. It is a disease of middle life, and is said to be peculiar to the male sex. Cholera is prevalent during the hot seasons of the year; small-pox also occurs at the same periods; fevers come after the cessation of rain. Cattle diseases are also prevalent. Cholera is usually imported by travellers coming from the north. The average annual rainfall from 1871\u201372 to 1881\u201382 was 40\u00b742 inches; the highest rainfall being in 1878\u201379, when 62\u00b729 inches were registered, and the lowest in 1877\u201378, when only 27\u00b746 inches fell. The mean temperature for each month during 1881 at R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri was\u2014January 85\u00b0 F., February 89\u00b0, March 97\u00b0, April 90\u00b0, May 80\u00b0, June 84\u00b0, July 86\u00b0, August 83\u00b0, September 74\u00b0, October 75\u00b0, November 74\u00b0, and December 74\u00b0. The number of births per 1000, registered in 1882, was 21\u00b76; number of deaths per 1000, 16\u00b79.\n\nStorms.\u2014A destructive inundation took place at Coringa in 1787. The first great cyclone recorded was in 1832. The sea broke in at Coringa, and destroyed a great number of people, cattle, and houses; a small village near Coringa was entirely swept away, and the country was laid under water for many miles inland. Again, on the 16th\nNovember 1839, a similar storm destroyed great parts of Cocan\u00e1da, Coringa, Tallarevu, and Nilapalli. Most of the vessels lying near these places were wrecked, and the value of the property lost was estimated at \u00a3100,000. Nars\u00e1pur, as it lies on the banks of the God\u00e1vari, has always been exposed to inundations during the high freshes of the river. Two cyclones visited the District in 1878, one on the 5th November and the other on the 6th December. The first commenced about 8 A.M., and continued up to 4 P.M. Considerable damage was done, but there was no encroachment of the sea upon the land. The second was accompanied with heavier rain, and lasted for more than a day. Many canals, tanks, and roads were breached, and much damage done to houses and trees.\n\nGod\u00e1vari (Godavery).\u2014A great river of Central India, which runs across the Deccan from the Western to the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts; for sanctity, picturesque scenery, and utility to man, surpassed only by the Ganges and the Indus; total length, 898 miles; estimated area of drainage basin, 112,200 square miles. The traditional source is on the side of a hill behind the village of Trimbak, in N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency, about 50 miles from the shore of the Indian Ocean. At this spot is an artificial reservoir, reached by a flight of 690 steps, into which the water trickles drop by drop from the lips of a carven image, shrouded by a canopy of stone. From first to last, the general direction of the river is towards the south-east. After passing through N\u00e1sik District, it forms for some distance the boundary between Ahmadnagar and the dominions of the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. It then crosses into the territory of the Niz\u00e1m, running for more than 500 miles of its course through a country that has been little explored. Near Sironcha, where it again strikes British territory, is the confluence of the Pranhita, itself a noble river, which brings down the united waters of the Wardha, the Penganga, and the Wainganga. From Sironcha to the point where it bursts through the barrier range of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, the south bank of the God\u00e1vari continues to lie within the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions; while on the north stretches the narrow strip of country known as the Upper God\u00e1vari District, in the Central Provinces. In this portion of its course it is joined by the Indr\u00e1vati, the Tal, and the Sabari.\n\nOn reaching this stage, the God\u00e1vari has grown into an imposing stream, with a channel varying from 1 mile to more than 2 miles in breadth, occasionally broken by long alluvial islands. The British bank is for the most part rocky and steep, and covered with primeval jungle. Parallel to the river run long ranges of hills, which at places advance their abrupt spurs almost to the water\u2019s edge. On the opposite side, the country is more open and cultivated. Several flourishing towns are to be seen, and the plain stretching away southwards, which\nincluded the capital of the ancient kingdom of Teling\u00e1na, is thickly dotted with tanks for irrigation. Below the junction of the S\u00e1bari, the scenery assumes the character which has earned for the God\u00e1vari the name of the Indian Rhine. The channel begins to contract; the flanking hills gradually close in on either side, until the precipitous gorge is reached, only 200 yards wide, through which the entire volume of water is poured upon the alluvial plain of the delta, about 60 miles from the sea. This mountain range, and the remainder of the course of the river until it reaches the Bay of Bengal by three principal mouths, is entirely included within the Madras District of God\u00e1vari. The head of the delta is at the village of Dowlaisvaram, where the main stream is crossed by the irrigation anicut. The largest of the three branches, known as the Gautami God\u00e1vari, turns eastward, and, after passing the quiet French settlement of Yan\u00e1on, enters the sea at Point Koringa, not far from the port of Cocan\u00e1da. The most southerly branch, or the Vashista God\u00e1vari, debouches at Point Nars\u00e1pur, after throwing off the third offshoot called the Vainateyam God\u00e1vari.\n\nThe peculiar sacredness of the God\u00e1vari is said to have been revealed by R\u00e1ma himself to the rishi, or sage, Gautama. The river is sometimes called God\u00e1, and the sacred character especially attaches to the Gautami mouth. According to popular legend, it proceeds from the same source as the Ganges, by an underground passage; and this identity is preserved in the familiar name of Vriddha-gang\u00e1. But every part of its course is holy ground, and to bathe in its waters will wash away the blackest sin. Once in every twelve years a great bathing festival, called Pushkaram, is held on the banks of the God\u00e1vari, alternately with the other eleven sacred rivers of India. The spots most frequented by pilgrims are\u2014the source at Trimbak; the town of Bhadr\u00e1chalam on the left bank, about 100 miles above R\u00e1j\u00e1-mahendri (Rajahmundry), where stands an ancient temple of R\u00e1ma-chandrau, surrounded by twenty-four smaller pagodas; R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri itself; and the village of Kotipalli, on the left bank of the eastern mouth.\n\nThroughout the upper portion of its course, the waters of the God\u00e1vari are scarcely at all utilized for irrigation; but within recent times, the entire delta has been turned into a garden of perennial crops by means of the magnificent anicut constructed at Dowlaisvaram. This great work was first projected towards the close of the last century by Mr. Michael Topping; but it was not until 1844, when the impoverished condition of the people, from repeated failures of the harvest, forced the matter on the attention of Government, that it became the subject of a special report from Sir H. Montgomery. It was resolved by Government to undertake irrigation works on a comprehensive scale; and the management was entrusted to Captain (now Sir Arthur)\nCotton, who had experience of the successful works on the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) in Tanjore District. Operations were commenced in 1847, and completed according to the original design by 1850. Up to 1853, the total expenditure had been \u00a3153,000. From March 1847 up to April 1850, there had been expended in daily wages for the labourers \u00a323,913. In the year of the most extensive building operations there were in constant employment 641 bricklayers, 365 stonemasons, and, upon an average, 6500 coolies or ordinary labourers.\n\nThe principal work is the anicut or weir at Dowlaisvaram, at the head of the delta, from which three main canals are drawn off. The river channel here is about 3\u00bd miles wide, including the space occupied by islands. The anicut itself is a substantial mass of stone, bedded in lime cement, about 2\u00bd miles long, 38 feet above mean sea-level, 130 feet broad at the base, and 12 feet high. The stream is thus pent back, so as to supply a volume of 3000 cubic feet of water per second during its low season, and 12,000 cubic feet at time of flood. As is the case with all deltaic streams, the river runs along the crest of a natural embankment several feet above the alluvial plain. Dowlaisvaram is about 20 feet above the lowest level, and therefore easily commands the whole area of the delta. The total length of the main channels of distribution is estimated at 528 miles, capable of irrigating 612,000 acres. In 1882-83, the area actually irrigated from the God\u00e1vari Delta system was 504,213 acres; profit during the same year, \u00a384,583, equal to an interest of 7.68 per cent. on the total capital outlay. Of the 528 miles of canal, 458 miles are also used for navigation. In 1864, an extension of the original scheme was sanctioned, by which water communication has been opened between the river systems of the God\u00e1vari and the Kistna. Completion estimates for the entire God\u00e1vari Delta system, amounting to \u00a31,303,265 for direct and indirect charges, were sanctioned by the Secretary of State in 1882. For a detailed account of the history of these irrigation works, see *The Manual of the Godavery District*, by Mr. H. Morris (Tr\u00fcbner, 1878).\n\nThe more recent project for opening for navigation the upper waters of the God\u00e1vari has not been crowned with equal success. In 1851, before the railway had penetrated through the heart of the peninsula, it was hoped that the God\u00e1vari, or rather its tributary the Wardha, might supply a cheap means of carriage for the cotton and other agricultural produce of the Central Provinces. This line of navigation would have had its upper terminus at the mart of Nachangi\u00f3n, not far from N\u00e1gpur and Amr\u00e1oti; and it would have passed by the great cotton emporium of Hinghangh\u00e1t, and the towns of W\u00fan and Ch\u00e1nda, reaching the sea by the flourishing port of Cocan\u00e1da. During nine months of the year\nthere is sufficient water for shallow river steamers; and the force of the current does not exceed 3 miles an hour. There are, however, three great obstructions to navigation, caused by rocky barriers and rapids. The first of these barriers is at D\u00famag\u00fadiem, about 115 miles above R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri; the second about 68 miles higher up, just below the confluence of the Pr\u00e1nhita; the third is on the Wardha, about 75 miles above the second. It was proposed to construct canals round these barriers by means of anicuts and locks, and to clear the river-bed in other places by blasting. Between 1861 and 1863, about \u00a3700,000 was expended upon the navigation works; but comparatively little real progress had been made, and the prospects of any remunerative return had become more than doubtful. Finally, in October 1871, the entire undertaking was abandoned, in accordance with instructions from the Secretary of State. The navigation on the canals of the delta has already been alluded to.\n\n**Godd\u00e1.**\u2014Sub-division of Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; situated between 24\u00b0 30' and 25\u00b0 14' N. lat., and between 87\u00b0 5' and 87\u00b0 38' E. long. Area, 966 square miles, with 1758 villages and 58,195 houses. Total population (1881) 348,493, namely, males 173,004, and females 175,489. Average density of population, 360 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b78; persons per village, 255; houses per square mile, 61\u00b76; persons per house, 6. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 190,900; Muhammadans, 25,273; Sant\u00e1ls, 112,583; Kols, 929; other aboriginal tribes, 16,227; Christians, 84; unspecified, 2497. This Sub-division, which was constituted in 1856, consists of the th\u00e1nd or police circle of Godd\u00e1. It contained in 1883, 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 52 men; village watchmen, 666.\n\n**Godhr\u00e1.**\u2014Sub-division of P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 598 square miles; contains 1 town and 232 villages. Population (1881) 78,318, namely, 40,895 males and 37,423 females. Hindus number 64,015; Muhammadans, 7712; 'others,' 6591. The Sub-division is well wooded and well tilled in the west, but in the north becomes a plain country of brushwood and forest with rough and scanty cultivation. The climate is unhealthy. Average annual rainfall, 45\u00b77 inches. The M\u00e1hi and the P\u00e1nam flow through the Sub-division. The rates of settlement were fixed for 30 years in 1873\u201374; average incidence of land revenue per acre, 1s. 5d. In 1873 there were 6430 holdings with an average of 14 acres each, and paying an average rent of 13s. 10d. Maize is the staple of cultivation. The Sub-division in 1883 contained 1 civil and 5 criminal courts; police station (th\u00e1nd), 1; regular police, 195 men. Land revenue, \u00a35903 in 1884.\n\n**Godhr\u00e1.**\u2014Chief town of Godhr\u00e1 Sub-division, District of the\nPanch Mah\u00e1ls, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzerat), Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 46' 30\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 40' E.; situated on the main road from Nimach (Neemuch) to Baroda, 52 miles north-east of Baroda town, and 43 west of Dohad. Population (1881) 13,342. Hindus number 5927; Muhammadans, 6339; Jains, 623; Christians, 41; Parsis, 12; and 'others,' 400. The town is almost surrounded by jungle. Formerly it was the head-quarters of a provincial governor under the Muhammadan kings of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. In addition to the usual District head-quarters offices and courts, there is a sub-judge's and mamlatddir's court, a post-office, a dispensary, and a subordinate jail for short-term prisoners. Godhr\u00e1 is also the head-quarters of the Rewa-K\u00e1ntha Political Agency, transferred from Baroda in 1880, consequent on its amalgamation with the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. A considerable area of rice land is irrigated from a large tank in the neighbourhood. The extension of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, 17 miles from Pali, across the river Mahi, has reached this town and increased its importance in trade by a revival of the old route from M\u00e1lwa to Gujar\u00e1t. A line to connect Godhr\u00e1 with the opium mart of Rutlam was begun in 1884-85.\n\nMunicipal income (1880-81), \u00a3612, and \u00a3504 in 1882-83; incidence of taxation per head of municipal population (10,641), 1s. 2d. in 1880-81, and 9d. in 1882-83. Oil-pressing was started in 1867, and a steam mill was erected in that year. The mill, however, ceased working in 1877. Near the town is an embanked lake 70 acres in area. Godhr\u00e1 has 3 vernacular schools.\n\nGodn\u00e1 (or Revelganj).\u2014Town and municipality in S\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 46' 56\" N., long. 84\u00b0 41' 7\" E. Situated just above the junction of the Ganges and Gogra (Ghagr\u00e1), and built along the banks of the latter river; the largest mart in S\u00e1ran District. Its trade may be classed under two heads:\u2014(1) Its local trade as the port of S\u00e1ran, representing also Champ\u00e1r\u00e1n and Nep\u00e1l; exports\u2014maize, barley, peas, oil-seeds, saltpetre, sugar, cotton, and wheat; imports\u2014rice, salt, and piece-goods; (2) Its through trade between Bengal and the North-West. Godn\u00e1 is the great changing station, where the boats from Lower Bengal transship their cargoes of rice and salt into the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) and Gorakhpur boats, which give in exchange wheat, barley, pulses, and oil-seeds. Several Calcutta firms are represented in the town. The population of Godn\u00e1 in 1872 was returned at 13,415; and in 1881 at 12,493, namely, males 5683, and females 6810. Area of town site, 2560 acres. Hindus in 1881 numbered 10,399; and Muhammadans, 2094. Municipal revenue (1876-77), \u00a3812; (1881-82), \u00a31169; incidence of taxation, 1s. 7d. per head.; municipal police, 41 men. Dispensary, b\u00e1sdr, and fair held twice a year. The native name of this town is Godn\u00e1. It is celebrated as the residence of Gautama, the founder of the school of Ny\u00e1y\u00e1 philosophy or Indian logic. No\ntraces of his dwelling exist: but a wretched hovel and a pair of shoes are still pointed out to pilgrims.\n\nThe commercial importance of Godn\u00e1 dates from the end of the last century. In 1788, Mr. Revell, collector of Government customs, was deputed to open a custom-house and b\u00e1s\u00e1r at this place. After his death he became an eponymous hero. To the present day his tomb is visited as a shrine by the market people, and his name is invoked on all occasions of calamity. The chief business done is in oil-seeds, brought down the Gogra from the Districts of Oudh, and here trans-shipped into larger boats for conveyance to Patn\u00e1 and Calcutta. The traders are mostly agents of firms at those two cities, and they transact business on commission. The principal European firm represented is that of Messrs. Ralli Brothers. A distinction in their course of business is observed by European and native merchants. The object of the Europeans is to use the railway at Patn\u00e1 to the utmost. They therefore have their oil-seeds cleaned at Patn\u00e1 by a special class of women. The rate of freight from Godn\u00e1 to Patn\u00e1 is 1 anna per bag, or Rs. 3 per 100 maunds; the voyage takes two days during the rainy season and three days at other times of the year. From Patn\u00e1 the cleaned seed is despatched by rail to Calcutta. The native merchants scarcely use the railway at all. They buy up oil-seeds when the prices are low, and store them along the river bank until they can obtain a good market at Calcutta. Then they despatch them all the way by boat, in their uncleaned state. There are no facilities for cleaning at Godn\u00e1. The freight to Calcutta varies from Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 per 100 maunds. The voyage occupies about fifteen days during the rains and forty days in the dry weather. The native traders do not insure. They draw bills, accepted by their bankers at Calcutta, who thus become practically the insurers; for if a heavy loss is sustained, the traders fail, and the bankers have to pay.\n\nIn the year 1876\u201377 (the last year for which figures are available, the inland river registration station being now abolished), the total registered trade of Godn\u00e1, including both imports and exports, was valued at over one million sterling. But it is admitted that great part of the imports, especially European piece-goods from Din\u00e1pur, escaped registration altogether. Oil-seeds were imported to the amount of 559,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3207,000. Nearly one-half came from the District of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d), the rest from Bahr\u00e1ich, Gorakhpur, Gonda, S\u00edt\u00e1pur, and Basti. The exports of oil-seeds were 895,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3333,000, consigned in almost equal moieties to Patn\u00e1 and Calcutta. Considerably more than half the total was linseed. Food-grains of all kinds were imported to the amount of 976,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3181,000. Wheat, pulses, and gram, and other spring crops, are received from\nOudh, to be sent on to Calcutta, Patna, and the Districts of Behar. Rice is imported for local consumption to the amount of 293,000 maunds, chiefly from Northern Bengal. The total export of food-grains was 530,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3110,000, chiefly wheat to Calcutta and Patna, and inferior grains to Tirhut. Salt was imported to the amount of 203,000 maunds, valued at \u00a3101,000, of which 140,000 maunds came direct from Calcutta, and the rest from Patna. The exports of salt were only 24,000 maunds, valued at \u00a317,000, principally to Gorakhpur. The other articles of trade included timber, \u00a335,000; sugar, \u00a316,000; saltpetre, \u00a34000. No trade statistics are available for 1881-82, but the commerce of the place has greatly decreased of late years, and is likely to continue to do so as the Patna-Bahraich Railway is opened.\n\nGogha.\u2014Town and Sub-division in Ahmadabad District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Gogo.\n\nGoghat.\u2014Village and police station in Hooghly District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 53' 15\" N., long. 87\u00b0 44' 50\" E. Recently transferred from Bardwan District.\n\nGogo.\u2014Sub-division of Ahmadabad District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 224 square miles; contains 1 town and 62 villages. Population (1881) 29,370, namely, 14,824 males and 14,546 females. Hindus number 24,082; Muhammadans, 3879; 'others,' 1409. Since 1871, the population of the Sub-division has decreased by 4459. There is but little State land in Gogo. The Khokhra hills, with a peak 600 feet high, bound one side of the Sub-division. Climate cool and healthy. A steady sea-breeze blows during the hot-weather months. The average Settlement holding is 24 acres in extent, and pays a rental of \u00a31, 4s. 5d. Joar is the chief crop, occupying 33,000 acres out of 37,000 under actual cultivation in 1877-78. About 2000 acres were under wheat. Cotton and rice are seldom grown. The Sub-division in 1883 contained 2 criminal courts and 1 police station (thana); regular police, 54 men; village watch (chaukidars), 69. Land revenue (1882-83), \u00a33870.\n\nGogo (or Gogha).\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Gogo, Ahmadabad District, Bombay Presidency; situated in the peninsula of Kathiawar, on the Gulf of Cambay, in lat. 21\u00b0 39' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 15' E., 193 miles north-west of Bombay. Population (1872) 9572; (1881) 7063, namely, 3389 Hindus, 2728 Muhammadans, 708 Jains, 53 Christians, 3 Parsis, and 182 'others.' About three-quarters of a mile east of the town is an excellent anchorage, in some measure sheltered by the island of Perim (Piram), which lies still farther east. The natives of this town are reckoned the best sailors or laskars in India; and ships touching here may procure water and supplies, or repair damages. The roadstead is a safe refuge during the south-west monsoon, or for vessels\nthat have parted from their anchors in the Surat roads, the bottom being an uniform bed of mud, and the water always smooth. When the Dutch raised Surat to be the chief port of Gujar\u00e1t, the Cambay ports were more or less injured. Gogo has of late years lost its commercial importance. During the American war it was one of the chief cotton marts of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. It is now deserted; its cotton presses idle; and its great storehouses ruinous and empty. Its rival, Bh\u00e1unagar, is 8 miles nearer to the cotton districts. North of the town is a black salt marsh, extending to the Bh\u00e1unagar creek. On the other sides undulating cultivated land slopes to the range of hills 12 miles off. South of the town is another salt marsh. The land in the neighbourhood is inundated at high spring tides, which renders it necessary to bring fresh water from a distance of a mile. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1880-81\u2014exports, \u00a339,393; imports, \u00a357,046.\n\nGogra (Gh\u00e1gra, also called the Deoha and Great Sarju).\u2014The great river of Oudh. It rises in the upper ranges of the Him\u00e1layas, and, after passing through Nep\u00e1l as the Kaur\u00edala, issues from the hills at a place called Sh\u00edshap\u00e1ni, or the 'Crystal Waters,' where it sweeps down on the plains in a series of rapids over immense boulders which it has brought with it from the hills during the course of ages. Almost immediately after it debouches on the tard\u00ed, the stream splits into two; the western branch retains the name of the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1l\u00e1, but the eastern, known as the Girwa, has a volume of water superior to that of the main stream. After a course of about 18 miles through the midst of fine s\u00e1l forests, and over rough stony beds, the twin streams enter British territory in lat. 26\u00b0 27' N., long. 82\u00b0 17' E., a few miles distant from each other, and re-unite a few miles below Bharthapur; and here the bed loses its rocky character and becomes sandy. Almost immediately below the confluence of the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1l\u00e1 and Girwa, the stream is joined by the Suheli from Kheri District; but it receives no other affluents of any importance until, after a southerly course of 47 miles, marking the boundary between Bahr\u00e1ich and Kheri, it is joined by the Sarju just above Kat\u00e1igh\u00e1t. Below the confluence, the united stream is swelled by the Chauk\u00e1 and Dah\u00e1war at Bahramgh\u00e1t. From this point the river takes its name of the Gogra. It flows in a south-easterly and afterwards an easterly course, forming the boundary between Bahr\u00e1ich and Gonda on the north, and Bara Banki and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) on the south. It leaves Oudh in the west; and, marking the boundary between the North-Western Provinces Districts of Basti and Gorakhpur on the north, and Azamgarh on the south, receives the Muchora and R\u00e1pti as tributaries on its left bank. In its course along the northern boundary of Azamgarh District, the Gogra throws off an affluent, the Lesser (chhot\u00e1) Sarju, which takes a south-easterly course along what is\nsupposed to be an ancient channel of the Gogra, through Azamgarh and Gh\u00e1zipur Districts, joining the Ganges below Ballia town. It then touches on the Bengal District of S\u00e1ran at Darauli, and finally empties itself into the Ganges at Chapr\u00e1, in lat. $25^\\circ 43' N.$, long. $84^\\circ 43' 30'' E.$, after an estimated course of upwards of 600 miles.\n\nMany changes in the course of the Gogra have taken place in olden times. Its waters have shown an inclination towards abandoning lateral channels, and selecting a central one, as in the well-known case of the S\u00e1rda, from which a magnificent system of canals to irrigate the Gogra-G\u00famti do\u00e1b is about to be constructed. On both sides of the present stream are seen ancient channels of the river, and high banks within which it once flowed. There were formerly, probably, three main channels of the river, whose volumes varied each year as accidental circumstances diverted the greater part of the water into one or other. A great flood of the Gogra took place about 1600 A.D., which swept away the town of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1 in Gonda, and considerable encroachments have also been made by the river in Azamgarh District. During the past century, there has been but little change in the channel beyond slight encroachments on its banks, by which villages are occasionally swept away during the rains. The old eastern and western channels have to a great extent silted up, but in the rains contain a considerable quantity of water. The depth of the river in mid-channel is nowhere less than 6 feet, but boats drawing more than 4 feet are not desirable, because they may be carried by the current on to shallows. The boats are generally clinker built, the largest carrying about 1200 maunds or 45 tons. They are usually without decks, the cargo being protected by mat awnings; the cost of carriage is very small. The only large town on the banks of the river is Faizabad (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d); Barhaj, at the confluence of the Gogra and R\u00e1pti, is an important mart, but is in no other respects remarkable. A pontoon bridge crosses the Gogra at Fa\u00edz\u00e1b\u00e1d; and bridges of boats during the cold and hot seasons are kept up at Bahramgh\u00e1t and Dohrigh\u00e1t; during the rains they are replaced by a well-served ferry; 45 other ferries are maintained at different points of the river in Oudh, and several in the North-Western Provinces.\n\nThe Gogra is, commercially speaking, the most important waterway in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. The traffic which it carried in 1879-80, the year in which it was registered under the superintendence of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, amounted to considerably more than one-fourth of the whole water-borne traffic; and if its tributary the R\u00e1pti be included, the united traffic comes to nearly half the whole water-borne traffic. The returns show the total traffic carried by the Gogra to have been over 23\u00bd lakhs\n(2,350,000) of maunds, or about 86,000 tons; 21 l\u0101khs (2,100,000) maunds being carried down stream, and 2\u00bd l\u0101khs (250,000) maunds up stream. The down-stream traffic runs in three well-marked lines: (1) Transport of timber from the Nep\u00e1l forests on the Kauri\u00e1l\u00e1, and of grain and oil-seeds from Bahr\u00e1ich to the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway at Bahramgh\u00e1t. (2) Transport of grain and oil-seeds from Bahr\u00e1ich to Patn\u00e1. (3) Transport of grain and oil-seeds from Naw\u00e1bganj (opposite Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d) in Gonda District to Patn\u00e1. The weight of timber thus carried is estimated at 100,000 maunds, and of grain and oil-seeds 1,825,000 maunds, of which 875,000 maunds were despatched from Naw\u00e1bganj to Patn\u00e1. The up-stream traffic is of comparatively small importance, consisting principally of rice, metals, salt, stone, and sugar, imported from Patn\u00e1 and consigned to Dohrigh\u00e1t in Azamgarh District.\n\nGogunda.\u2014Town in the Native State of Udaipur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Contains about 1500 houses. Situated on the watershed at a height of 2750 feet above the sea, and probably the highest town on the whole of the Aravalli range. The country around is open and undulating, and there is a good sheet of water to the south-east of the town. A first-class noble of Udaipur, who owns 104 villages, resides here, and the town gives its name to his estate. Twenty-five miles to the north is the temple of Jargo, where a large fair is held annually.\n\nGohad.\u2014Town in Gwalior State, Central India. Distant 60 miles south-east from Agra, and situated on the road from Et\u00e1wah to Gwalior, 55 miles south-west of the former, and 28 north-east of the latter town. Lat. 26\u00b0 25' N., long. 78\u00b0 29' E. A fortified town, formerly the capital of a J\u00e1t chieftain, who rose into power from the position of a land-holder during the troublous times at the beginning of the last century, and established himself at the expense of his neighbours. In 1779, the chief entered into alliance with the British, who assisted him in a struggle against Sindhia. Sindhia's capital, with the fort, was captured by a British force, and made over to the Gohad chief. Five years later, however, the position was reversed; Sindhia besieged and re-obtained possession of Gwalior fort, and also captured the capital (Gohad) of his enemy. In 1803, certain territorial arrangements were effected by which the town and territory of Gohad were transferred to Sindhia, and the Gohad R\u00e1n\u00e1 received instead the territory of Dh\u00f3lpur, which his descendants still hold. The fortifications of Gohad consist of an outer curtain of mud, faced with stone, enclosing an extensive area, between which and the citadel are two other walls. The citadel is lofty, with massive towers, and has spacious and commodious apartments. Thieffenthaler, who visited Gohad in the last century, describes it as a populous and rich place. It is now, however, much decayed.\n\nGoh\u00e1na.\u2014Northern tahsil of Rohtak District, Punjab; irrigated by\nGOHAN\u00c1\u2014GOKAK.\n\nthe Western Jumna Canal, which affords a water-supply to 39,664 acres.

The Mah\u00e1bleshwar temple here is built in the Dravidian style, and is famed as containing a fragment of the original Linga given to R\u00e1vana by Siva. Upwards of a hundred lamps are kept perpetually alight from funds supplied by devotees. A fair is annually held in February, at which from 2000 to 8000 people assemble. Gokarn is mentioned both in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana and Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. Buchanan visited the place in 1801.\n\n**Gokul**.\u2014Town in Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the left or eastern bank of the Jumna river. Lat. 28\u00b0 26' N., long. 77\u00b0 46' 30\" E.; 6 miles south-east of Muttra town. Hindu tradition regards the village as the spot where Vishnu first visited the earth in the form of Krishna. Also noted as the place where Vallabhi Sw\u00e1mi, a Hindu reformer of the 16th century, first preached his doctrines.\n\n**Gol\u00e1**.\u2014Town in B\u00e1nsga\u00f3n tahsil, Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces.

An Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioner are ordinarily posted in this Sub-division.\n\nGol\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\u2014Village in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam, and head-quarters of the Sub-division of the same name, on the Dhaneswari (Dhansari) river. Lat. 26\u00b0 30' N.; long. 94\u00b0 E. Population (1881) 1906. The town has recently increased in importance as being the d\u00e9p\u00f4t in connection with the transport and commissariat offices for the troops in the N\u00e1ga Hills. It is built on high ground, broken by ravines, and ranks as one of the healthiest places in Assam. It was erected into a municipal union in 1881. Steamers are able to reach Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t during the rainy season, and the river is navigable for small boats all the year through. In the cold weather, the N\u00e1g\u00e1s from beyond the frontier come down in large numbers, bringing cotton, and vegetables, such as yams, sweet potatoes, ginger, pumpkins, etc., to barter for salt, fish, and live stock.\n\nGolconda.\u2014Fortress and ruined city, situated in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, 7 miles west of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) city. Lat. 17\u00b0 22' N., long. 78\u00b0 26' 30\" E. In former times, Golconda was a large and powerful kingdom of the Deccan, which arose on the downfall of the B\u00e1hmani dynasty, but was subdued by Aurangzeb in 1687, and annexed to the dominions of the Delhi Empire. Golconda was the capital of the Kutab Sh\u00e1hi kings, who had their court here from 1512 to 1687. Originally it was a small fort built by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Warangal, who ceded it together with its dependencies to a B\u00e1hmani king of Gulburghah (Kalburga) in 1364. In 1512 it passed from the B\u00e1hmani kings to the kings of the Kutab Sh\u00e1hi line. The boundaries of the kingdom of Golconda, one of the five sovereignties that rose on the downfall of the B\u00e1hmanis, extended along the left bank of the Tungabhadra river as far as its junction with the Bh\u00edma, and then followed the line of hills to the south-west, which formed the frontiers of the Bidar region. After a prosperous reign of thirty years, the first Kutab Sh\u00e1hi king was\nassassinated by the commandant of the fort at the instigation of the king's son. In the reign of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1hi, the existence of diamonds in Golconda territory was discovered at Parti\u00e1l and Kanat and other places. In 1589, the son and successor of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm commenced to build the present city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the banks of the Musi, 5 miles from Golconda. The kingdom now reached the zenith of its prosperity. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm's successor died in 1611, and from that date until the arrival of Aurangzeb in the Deccan (1657), the annals of Golconda are uncertain. During Aurangzeb's viceroyalty on behalf of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n at Aurung\u00e1b\u00e1d, the famous M\u00edr Juml\u00e1 was Prime Minister or diw\u00e1n at Golconda, and having incurred the anger of the Golconda king, fled for protection to Aurangzeb. As an answer to M\u00edr Juml\u00e1's appeal, Aurangzeb suddenly appeared before Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, plundered Golconda, and forced the Sh\u00e1hi king to pay a ransom equal to one million sterling. M\u00edr Juml\u00e1 took service with the Mughal and afterwards rose to power; he was originally a servant in the train of a Persian merchant trading with the Deccan. After the submission of Golconda, M\u00edr Juml\u00e1 visited the court of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. In 1675, the Mughal commander in the Deccan advanced to punish Golconda for assisting the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Sivaji after his escape from Agra, but the forces of Golconda defeated those of the Mughals. In 1687, Aurangzeb, now Emperor at Delhi, besieged and captured Golconda after a struggle of seven months' duration. Thenceforward Golconda, now deserted, lost even the memory of its former greatness.\n\nThe fortress of Golconda, situated on a rocky ridge of granite, is extensive, and contains many enclosures. It is strong and in good repair, but is commanded by the summits of the enormous and massive mausolea of the ancient kings, about 600 yards distant. These buildings, which are now the chief characteristic of the place, form a vast group, situated in an arid, rocky desert. They have suffered considerably from the ravages of time, but more from the hand of man, and nothing but the great solidity of their walls has preserved them from utter ruin. These tombs were erected at great expense, some of them being said to have cost as much as \u00a3150,000. Golconda fort is now used as the Niz\u00e1m's treasury, and also as the State prison. It is held by a small Arab garrison in the service of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Visitors require permission from the Nizam's minister to go over the fort. The diamonds of Golconda have obtained great celebrity throughout the world; but they were merely cut and polished here, being generally found at Parti\u00e1l, near the south-eastern frontier of the Niz\u00e1m's territory.\n\nGolconda (Golugonda or Golgonda).\u2014T\u00e1luk in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Latitude, 18\u00b0 28' to 18\u00b0 4' N.; longitude, 81\u00b0 30' to 82\u00b0 40' E.; area, 161 square miles, with 178 villages, 21,711 houses,\nand (1881) 97,748 inhabitants\u2014namely, males 49,383, and females 48,365. Classified according to religion, there were, Hindus, 96,874; Muhammadans, 838; Christians, 6; and 'others,' 30. Of the villages, 113 are riyatwdr\u00ed, or held direct from Government by the cultivators. Land revenue, \u00a311,486. This taluk, which contains a large tract of hill country, and about 600 square miles of Government forest, was one of the largest and most ancient saminddr\u00eds or landed estates in the District, the saminddr\u00eds being relatives and feudatories of the Jaipur (Jeypore) chief. Of the tract above the gh\u00e1ts, two mutt\u00e1s (Dutsarti and Guditeru), with an area of about 400 square miles, were transferred to God\u00e1vari District in 1881. In 1836, in consequence of the murder of the R\u00e1n\u00ed, the British authorities sequestrated the estate and imprisoned the saminddr, and in the following year the estate was bought by Government at auction. In 1845 the sard\u00e1rs or chiefs rose in rebellion, and held their ground for three years; and again, in 1857-58, it was found necessary to send troops against them. The saminddr\u00ed has been converted into a Government taluk with headquarters at Narsapatam. The forests are of considerable value, but the attempt to conserve them has been abandoned, owing to there being no means for transporting the timber down the gh\u00e1ts. The taluk is also noted for the excellence of its oranges. In 1882 it contained 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1nds), 10; regular police, 126.\n\nGollagudem.\u2014Village on the God\u00e1vari river, in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Latitude, 17\u00b0 39' N.; longitude, 81\u00b0 1' 30\" E. Vessels navigating the God\u00e1vari take in and deliver cargo here, and travellers are permitted to occupy the small inspection bungalow belonging to the Public Works Department.\n\nGolugonda.\u2014Taluk in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Golconda.\n\nGomal.\u2014Pass across the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n range, from the Punjab into Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.\u2014See Gumal.\n\nGonda.\u2014District of Oudh in the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) Division or Commissionership, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between lat. 26\u00b0 46' and 27\u00b0 50' N., and between long. 81\u00b0 35' and 82\u00b0 48' E. In shape, the District is an irregular oblong, slightly pinched in the middle, with an extreme length of 68 and an extreme breadth of 66 miles. Bounded on the north by the lower range of the Him\u00e1layas, separating it from Nep\u00e1l; on the east by Basti District; on the south by Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bara Banki, the Gogra river forming the boundary line; and on the west by Bahr\u00e1ich. Area, 2875 square miles; population (1881) 1,270,926.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Gonda presents the aspect of a vast plain, with very slight undulations, studded with groves of mango trees; in parts,\nthe large *mahu\u00e1* trees, left standing on green pasture grounds where the other jungle has been cut down, give the country an English park-like appearance. During the fine clear months at the end of the rainy season, the range of the Himalayas, with the towering peak of Diw\u00e1lagiri in the centre, forms a magnificent background to the north. The villages, except in the north, are very small, being generally divided into a number of minute hamlets, of which over thirty will sometimes be included in a single village boundary. This may be attributed partly to a comparative freedom from the disastrous clan wars which, in other parts of Oudh, drove the villagers to congregate for the sake of security, and partly to the fact that a large part of the District has been only lately reclaimed from jungle. Throughout the District, the surface consists of a rich alluvial deposit, which is divided naturally into three great belts, known as the *tard\u00ed* or swampy tract, the *uparh\u00e1r* or uplands, and the *tarh\u00e1r* or wet lowlands. (1) The first of these, the *tard\u00ed*, extends from the forests on the northern boundary, and reaches southwards to a line about 2 miles south of the R\u00e1pti, running through the towns of Balr\u00e1mpur and Utraula. The soil is generally a heavy clay, except in places where the rain-swollen mountain torrents which flow into the R\u00e1pti and Burh\u00ed R\u00e1pti have flooded the neighbouring fields with a sandy deposit of debris from the hills. (2) The *uparh\u00e1r* begins where the *tard\u00ed* ends, and extends south to a line drawn roughly east and west about 2 miles below Gonda town. The soil is generally a good *domat*, or mixture of clay and sand, with occasional patches of pure clay. (3) The *tarh\u00e1r* or wet lowland reaches from the *uparh\u00e1r* to the Gogra, which forms the southern boundary of the District. The soil is a light *domat*, with an occasional excess of sand. These three belts are marvellously fertile; and there is said to be hardly an acre of land in the District which would not eventually reward patient labour. The vast tracts of barren saline efflorescence (*reh*) so common in the south of Oudh are quite unknown here.\n\nThe chief rivers, beginning in the north, are the Bur\u00ed R\u00e1pti, R\u00e1pti, Suw\u00e1wan, Kuw\u00e1na, Bis\u00fahi, Chamn\u00e1i, Manwar, T\u00edrhi, Sarju, and Gogra, all flowing from north-west to south-east. The Gogra and R\u00e1pti are alone of any commercial importance, the first being navigable throughout the year, and the latter during the rainy months. The rivers in the centre of the District are mere shallow streams in the hot weather, fringed in most places with a jungle of young *s\u00e1l* trees, mixed with *mahu\u00e1*, and ending at the water's edge with a cane-brake or line of *j\u00e1mun* trees. Dangerous quicksands, covered with a green coating of short grass, are exceedingly common along the edge of the water. The whole District is studded with small shallow lakes, the water of which is largely used for irrigation, and on the margin of which grows a variety of wild rice (*tinn\u00ed*), which furnishes an important article of food to the lower classes.\nA strip of Government reserved forest runs along the foot of the hills, the most valuable trees being the sal (Shorea robusta), dh\u00e1m (Conocarpus latifolia), ebony (Diospyros melanoxylum), and Acacia catechu. The wild animals consist of tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, antelope, deer of various kinds, and wild pigs, among large game. Snipe, jungle fowl, quail, peacock, partridges, ortolans, and pigeons, are the principal game birds. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes; crocodiles and dolphins are common.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of the District is centred in that of Sravasti, the modern Sahet Mahet, capital of the kingdom ruled over by Lava, the son of R\u00e1ma. After a period represented in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1na by fifty generations of kings, who ruled either at Sravasti or at Kapilavastu (Gorakhpur), the historical age commences (6th cent. B.C.) with King Prasen\u00e1ditya, the contemporary of Buddha, and one of his early converts, who invited the Sage to Sravasti. During eight generations, Sravasti remained a principal centre of the Buddhist religion. The kingdom reached its culminating power in the reign of the Oudh king Vikram\u00e1ditya, in the 2nd century A.D. This monarch was a bigoted Br\u00e1hmanist; and it was perhaps through civil wars between the followers of the rival religions that his kingdom so quickly collapsed. Within thirty years of his death, the sceptre had passed to the Gupta dynasty, and this thickly-populated seat of one of the most ancient kingdoms in India before long relapsed into jungle. The high road between the two capitals, Sravasti and Kapilavastu, was in the time of the Chinese pilgrims a dense forest infested with wild elephants.\n\nWhen it next emerges into history, the District was the seat of a Jain kingdom, which, in the hands of Sohildeo, was powerful enough to exterminate the victorious forces of Sayyid Sal\u00e1r, the nephew of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni. It was not long, however, before this dynasty shared the fate of its predecessors; and at the time of the second Muhammadan conquest, a Dom R\u00e1j\u00e1 ruled Gonda with his capital at Domangarh on the R\u00e1pti, in Gorakhpur. The most famous ruler of this race was R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ugrasen, who had a fort at Dumriadih in Mah\u00e1dewa pargand\u00e1. The establishment of many villages in the south of the District is traced to grants of land, generally in favour of Tharus, Doms, Bhars, and P\u00e1s\u00eds, made by this R\u00e1j\u00e1. As no similar tradition exists to the north of the Kuw\u00e1na, it may be conjectured that that tract was then mainly covered with forest. This low-caste Dom kingdom was subverted in the beginning of the 14th century by the Kshattriya clans of the Kalh\u00e1nsis, Janw\u00e1rs, and Bisens. The first-named clan occupied the country from His\u00e1mpur in Bahr\u00e1ich far into the interior of Gorakhpur. It is related of them that their leader Sah\u00e1j Singh, at the head of a small force, came from the Nar-\nbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, with the army of one of the Tughlak emperors, and was commissioned by him to bring into obedience the country between the Gogra and the hills. Their first settlement was in the Koeli jungle, about 2 miles south-west of Kur\u00e1sa, which town subsequently gave its name to the chieftainship thus established. The thinly-populated country was distributed in j\u00e1girs of about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ kos each among the leading officers of the cavalry.\n\nThe ruling family came to a tragic end. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Achal N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh, having carried off the daughter of a Br\u00e1hman zam\u00ednd\u00e1r by force, the latter sat down before the door of the oppressor's palace, and deliberately starved himself to death, after having pronounced the curse of extinction upon the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, with the exception of the offspring of the youngest queen. The Br\u00e1hman's prediction was speedily fulfilled, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace and fortress being soon afterwards overwhelmed by the river Sarju, and himself and family drowned, save only the young queen, who was exempted from the Br\u00e1hman's avenging prediction. She afterwards gave birth to a son, whose descendants are the present Kalh\u00e1ns\u00ed zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs of Babhnip\u00e1ir. The overthrow of the great Kalh\u00e1ns\u00ed dynasty occurred in the latter part of the 15th century. Some time before this, however, the north of the District had been occupied by the Janw\u00e1rs, whose forest kingdom comprised the whole sub-Him\u00e1layan tard\u00ed; and for long they divided with the Kalh\u00e1ns the chieftainship of the whole of the District. The overthrow of the Kalh\u00e1ns\u00ed dynasty was followed by several years of anarchy. In the reign of Akbar, with the exception of Ikaun\u00e1 and Utraula, there were no powerful chieftains in this part of Oudh. The Kalh\u00e1ns\u00eds of Babhnip\u00e1ir and Guw\u00e1rich were never of any considerable importance; and the rest of the District was covered with small semi-independent tribes of Bisens and Bandalghotis, and quasi-proprietary communities of Br\u00e1hmans. During the next period, the Bisens, who had been steadily rising in power for some time, consolidated the great Bisen r\u00e1j of Gonda, comprising a territory of 1000 square miles; the Janw\u00e1rs sent out an independent branch between the Kuw\u00e1na and the hills, and the large chieftainships of Balr\u00e1mpur, T\u00falsipur, and M\u00e1nikpur were formed. For some time before the separation of Oudh from the Delhi Empire, and its erection into a separate Muhammadan kingdom under Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, the trans-Gogra chiefs had enjoyed a virtual independence, waging wars among themselves, and exempt from any regular calls for the payment of tribute or revenue.\n\nThe new Muhammadan power was vigorously resisted by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gonda, who defeated and slew the first of the new Governors, Naw\u00e1b Al\u00e1wal Kh\u00e1n of Bahr\u00e1ich. A second force was sent against him, and he was for a time reduced to extremities; but the arrival of reinforcements compelled the Naw\u00e1b to raise the siege, and to be satisfied\nwith a partial submission, and a promise to pay a fixed tribute. For the next seventy years, a series of powerful Bisen chiefs retained a semi-independence, and engaged separately for the whole of their five ancestral *pargonds* of Gonda, Pah\u00e1rapur, Digs\u00e1r, Mah\u00e1dewa, and Naw\u00e1bganj. It was not till the murder of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Hindupat Singh and his entire family by his hereditary enemies, the Br\u00e1hman P\u00e1ndes, that the Oudh Government, by obtaining possession of his successor, a youth named Gum\u00e1n Singh, was enabled to break up the power of the Gonda principality, and to collect the revenue direct from the village head-men. Balr\u00e1mpur and T\u00falsipur still held out for independence, and, though worsted in many fights, managed to retain their positions as chieftains, and were let off with a lump assessment on their whole estates, which left them considerable profits. The lords of Mank\u00e1pur and Babhnip\u00e1ir in the same way were allowed to collect the rents in their own villages, and pay the revenue in a lump sum to the Naw\u00e1b. Up to the commencement of the present century, there was nothing at all in Gonda District resembling the *t\u00e1luk*s in other parts of Oudh. The hereditary chieftains were each supreme within the territorial limits of his *r\u00e1j*.\n\nAs soon as Gonda and Utraula were broken up, and the revenue was realized by official collectors, *t\u00e1luk*s sprang into existence. The Naw\u00e1bs found it convenient, and in some cases necessary, to let large numbers of villages to wealthy individuals as *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs*, or simple farmers of Government revenue. As a rule, these *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ris* lasted but a short time, and their small collections of villages became absorbed by the P\u00e1ndes, with whose power and wealth no one in the District could compete. The dispossessed R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Utraula and Gonda attempted to acquire *t\u00e1luk*s, and to combine the character of revenue farmer with that of feudal lord. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Utraula succeeded for a few years, but finally had to content himself with the few villages assigned for his support. The Gonda Bisens, however, got together the magnificent estate of Bisambharpur. The exactions of the N\u00e1zims, or revenue deputies of the Lucknow Court, have been described in the account of BAHRAICH. The British annexation of Oudh brought relief to the people; but in making the land settlement, the first Deputy Commissioner of the District, Colonel Boileau, was killed by a notorious freebooter named Fazl \u00c1lf.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Mutiny, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gonda, after honourably escorting the Government treasure to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d), threw in his lot with the rebels, and joined the standard of the Begam of Oudh at Lucknow. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur remained loyal throughout the struggle. He steadily declined to recognise the rebel Government, received and protected Sir C. Wingfield, the Commissioner of Gonda and Bahr\u00e1ich, together with other English officers, in his fort, and after-\nwards forwarded them safely, under a strong escort, to Gorakhpur. The Gonda R\u00e1j\u00e1, after the relief of Lucknow, fixed his camp at Lampti on the Chamn\u00e1i river, with a force said to amount to 20,000 men, who were, however, dispirited at the English successes elsewhere. After only a feeble resistance, the broken remnants of his forces were swept across the R\u00e1pti and over the lower range of the Him\u00e1layas into Nep\u00e1l. Most of the rebel tilukd\u00e1rs accepted the amnesty, but neither the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gonda nor the R\u00e1n\u00ed of T\u00falsipur could be induced to come in (although the conduct of the former throughout the Mutiny had been free from overt crime); and their estates were accordingly confiscated and conferred as rewards upon the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s Sir Dig Bij\u00e1i Singh of Balr\u00e1mpur, and Sir M\u00e1n Singh of Sh\u00e1hganj.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Gonda District, according to the Census of 1869, amounted to 602,862 males and 563,653 females, total 1,166,515; but upon the slightly increased area of the present District, was returned at 1,168,462, dwelling in 2834 villages or towns. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 1,270,926, showing an increase of 102,464, or nearly 10 per cent., in the thirteen years. The details of the Census are as follow: Area of District, 2875 square miles; towns and villages, 2790; houses, 203,274. Total population, 1,270,926, namely, males 650,771, and females 620,155. Average density of population, 442 per square mile; villages per square mile, '97; persons per village, 445; houses per square mile, 70'6; persons per house, 6'2. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 1,102,193, or 86'7 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 168,546, or 13'3 per cent. Sikhs numbered 28, and Christians 159.\n\nThe Br\u00e1hmans are the most numerous caste, numbering 213,024, or 16'7 per cent of the total population. They are almost all of the Sarw\u00e1ri\u00e1 sept, with a slight sprinkling of Gaurs, Kanaujias, and Sakaldwipis. The Gonda Br\u00e1hmans have long been noted for their military spirit; and they formed one of the most important elements in the forces of the great Bisen R\u00e1j\u00e1s. With the exception of the Path\u00e1ns of Utraula, the ruling classes are everywhere Kshattriyas, of which the principal families are the Kalh\u00e1ns of Babhip\u00e1ir and Chhedw\u00e1r\u00e1, the Bisens of Gonda and M\u00e1nk\u00e1pur, the Bandalghotis of M\u00e1nk\u00e1pur and Naw\u00e1bganj, the Janw\u00e1rs of Balr\u00e1mpur, and the Gor\u00e1ha Bisens of Mah\u00e1dewa. These R\u00e1jput castes number 53,027. The K\u00e1yasths, who largely make up the official element in the population, number 18,287; and the Baniy\u00e1s, or trading caste, 28,674. The great cultivating castes are the Ah\u00edrs, 128,439; Kor\u00eds, 124,252; Kurm\u00eds, 102,736; and Kachh\u00eds, 41,934. The Kah\u00e1rs, mostly servants and palanquin-bearers, number 47,573. The other principal Hindu castes\u2014artisans, traders, labourers, etc.\u2014are as follow, arranged numeri-\ncally:\u2014Cham\u00e1rs, 33,950; Barhais, 21,574; Tel\u00eds, 20,503; Dhobls, 18,984; Loni\u00e1s, 17,576; Gad\u00e1rlas, 16,562; Nais, 16,022; Bhurj\u00eds, 14,852; Kalw\u00e1rs, 14,183; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 13,980; Tambul\u00eds, 13,547; and Loh\u00e1rs, 11,814. The remnants of aboriginal tribes comprise the Bhars (8834), Doms (647), P\u00e1s\u00eds (32,477), Khatiks (8482), N\u00e1ts, Tharus, and Arakhs, the three last not being shown separately in the District Census. Of these, the first two are the pioneers of cultivation. Settling along the edge of the jungle, they clear the trees and prepare the land for tillage, only to leave it, when the task is accomplished, to the steadier industry of the Kurm\u00ed or the Ah\u00edr. The Barw\u00e1rs are a predatory tribe of Hindus, who spread over the country in gangs of 40 or 50; they have no scruple in robbing temples, but will not steal cattle, or even commit thefts, within Gonda District. The Muhammadans are most influential, and most numerous in proportion to the Hindus, in the old Path\u00e1n estate of Utraula, where they form the majority of the village proprietors; as common cultivators they are very thick all over the north of the District. Their religion is strongly intermingled with Hinduism, and the services of the Br\u00e1hman astrologer are held in high estimation by high and low.\n\nFive towns in the District contain a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, GONDA, population 13,743; BALRAMPUR, 12,811; NAWABGANJ, 8373; COLONELGANJ, 5904; and UTRAULA, 5825\u2014all of which see separately. The different villages and townships are thus classified:\u2014843 contain less than 200 inhabitants; 1105 from 200 to 500; 627 from 500 to 1000; 170 from 1000 to 2000; 28 from 2000 to 3000; 12 from 3000 to 5000; and 5 upwards of 5000 inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the population into the following six groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government servants, civil and military, and the learned professions, 6883; (2) domestic servants and lodging-house keepers, 1675; (3) commercial, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 5159; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 341,994; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 38,608; (6) indefinite and non-productive (including 11,693 general labourers, and 244,759 male children and persons of no specified occupation), 256,452.\n\nThe principal places of pilgrimage are the temple of Pateswari Debi at DEBI PATAN, the th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra of the new Vaishnava sect at CHHIP\u00cdA, and the temples of Baleswarn\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo at Mah\u00e1dewa, Karnan\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo at Machhl\u00edg\u00e1on, Bijlesw\u00e1r\u00ed Debi at Balr\u00e1mpur, and Pacharan\u00e1th and Pritwin\u00e1th at Khargupur.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice, wheat, and barley are the chief agricultural staples, comprising more than one-half the total cultivated area of the District. There are three harvests\u2014the khartf, the henw\u00e1t, and the rab\u00ed\u2014of which the relative importance varies in different parts of the District. In the centre table-land the rab\u00ed, and in the north the\nhenw\u0101t, are most depended upon. In the south, the kharif, when the rains are moderate, yields a magnificent crop of Indian corn; and excessive rains, while they are fatal to that particular crop, leave a fair crop of rice, and secure an abundant wheat harvest for the rabi. Ploughing for the kharif begins at the end of May, and continues throughout June; the seed is sown in the beginning of July, and cutting commences in September, or, in the case of rice, even earlier. By the middle of October, all the autumn crops are off the ground. Land for the henw\u0101t or Christmas crop is ploughed at the commencement of the rains, and the sowing continues during the growth of the kharif. In the case of transplanted rice (jarhan), the planting out is done at the beginning of August, and the cutting continues throughout November. In the middle of December, the cutting of the oil-seeds commences, and lasts till the first week of January. Preparations for the next year's spring crop commence before the rains set in; and in the case of wheat, the first ploughing generally takes place in June. At the end of August the field receives two or three more ploughings, and a last ploughing in September. Sowing takes place in October and November, and the crop is cut early in March. April is occupied in threshing and winnowing.\n\nThe total cultivated area of the District is returned at 1,135,002 acres, but including land bearing two crops, 1,398,856 acres are cultivated yearly. The area under the seven principal crops in 1882 was as follows:\u2014Rice, 352,200 acres; wheat, 266,877; barley, 41,246; jodr, 127,123; arh\u0101r, 4649; kodo, 16,078; als\u012b, 26,973 acres. Irrigation is largely practised, the area watered in 1881 being returned at 231,681 acres, of which 128,452 acres were watered from tanks, 9632 from rivers, and 93,597 from wells. Prices of food-grains do not range quite so high in Gonda as in other Districts; but they are higher than might be expected from the scanty population, owing mainly to the great facilities for export afforded by the Gogra. Prices have risen considerably of late years. Between the ten years 1861\u201370, the rates for unhulled rice rose from 2s. 2d. to 3s. 6\u00bdd. a cwt.; common husked rice from 4s. 2d. to 6s. 7d.; wheat, from 3s. 3d. to 5s. 9d.; barley, from 1s. 11d. to 4s. 7d.; b\u0101jra, from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 7d.; jodr, from 1s. 11d. to 3s. 10d.; gram, from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 2d.; arh\u0101r, from 4s. 2d. to 5s. 6d.; urid, from 3s. 9d. to 8s. 6d.; m\u016bg, from 5s. 9d. to 7s. 6d.; musuri, from 2s. 3d. to 4s. 7d. a cwt. Prices, however, ranged unusually high in 1870, as the District had not recovered from the effects of the scarcity in the previous year. Prices were returned as follows in 1883:\u2014Wheat, from 4s. 10d. to 5s. 4d. per cwt.; rice, from 6s. 3d. to 6s. 7d. per cwt.; and gram, from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 10d. per cwt. The famine of 1874 was severely felt, and Government relief works on a large scale were undertaken.\n\nGonda is pre-eminently a District of large landed proprietors; 20\nt\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs were returned in 1882 as in possession of estates covering 1,280,646 acres, and including 1885 whole villages and 242 shares; 950 villages or shares are held on ordinary tenure by small proprietors. The principal estates are those of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur, with 538,678 acres; R\u00e1j\u00e1 Krishna Datt R\u00e1m P\u00e1nde, 201,450 acres; and the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh, 201,960 acres. The t\u00e1luks are assessed at a total Government revenue of \u00a3127,726, or an average of 1s. 10\u00bdd. per acre over the entire area; while the small proprietors are assessed at \u00a342,212, on a total area of 348,996 acres, or an average of 2s. 6d. per acre. The apparent advantage on the side of the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs is due to the fact that the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur's estate consists of the whole of the thinly-populated and poorly-cultivated plains of T\u00falsipur; and also one-tenth of the entire assessment of Balr\u00e1mpur has been remitted as a reward for loyal services. As a rule, consideration has been had for coparcenary bodies of village proprietors, who have been assessed lower in proportion to the area of cultivated land in their possession than the large individual landholders. The cultivating classes are well-to-do and independent; and, owing to the thinness of its population and the considerable area of fertile waste land, Gonda enjoys almost complete freedom from the worst forms of poverty. The system of cultivating land by means of S\u00e1waks or bondsmen, as described in BAHRAICH DISTRICT, is also common here.\n\nCommunications, Trade, Commerce, etc.\u2014The three principal lines of road are\u2014from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) to Gonda town, 28 miles; from Naw\u00e1bganj to Utraula, 36 miles; and from Naw\u00e1bganj to Colonelganj, 35 miles. The minor roads are\u2014Gonda to Begamganj, 16 miles; Gonda to Bahr\u00e1ich, 16 miles; Gonda to Utraula, 36 miles; Gonda to Colonelganj, 15 miles; Gonda to Balr\u00e1mpur, 28 miles; Colonelganj to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, 28 miles; Colonelganj to Bahr\u00e1ich, 28 miles; Utraula to T\u00falsipur, 16 miles; Khargupur to Chaudh\u00e1ri Dih, 28 miles; Balr\u00e1mpur to Ikauna, 14 miles. Rice and food-grains are the chief exports; and cotton, European piece-goods, and salt the principal imports.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, aided by 2 European Assistants, and 1 or more extra-Assistants. The courts number 15 magisterial and 22 revenue and civil. The total imperial revenue of Gonda in 1871-72 amounted to \u00a3138,795, of which \u00a3122,234 was derived from the land. The imperial expenditure in the same year amounted to \u00a332,101, of which, however, one-half, or \u00a315,385, was on account of the Settlement Department, which has now ceased its operations. In 1875-76, the revenue amounted to \u00a3157,349, of which the land contributed \u00a3135,509; the expenditure in that year amounted to \u00a315,810. By 1880 the total revenue had increased to \u00a3181,103, and the land revenue to \u00a3150,936; expenditure, \u00a316,720. The regular police force in 1880\nconsisted of 594 officers and men, including 120 municipal, maintained at a cost of \u00a37253, of which \u00a36624 was defrayed by Government; the village watch numbered 3271 men, costing \u00a311,898 from local sources. Female infanticide is common in Aija and Colonelganj thands. Efforts have been made to stamp out this crime; but in 1874, in 52 'proclaimed' villages, the proportion of females to every 100 males was only 72. Education is still in its infancy, but village schools are now springing up in all directions. In 1880-81 there were 137 schools under Government inspection, attended by 4361 pupils. The Census Report, however, returned only 3900 boys and 72 girls as under instruction in 1881.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average annual rainfall of the District during the fourteen years ending 1881 was 42.99 inches; the highest fall in any one year was 68.7 inches in 1871, the lowest was 6.10 inches in 1874. The rainfall in 1881 was 54.98 inches, or 11.99 inches above the average. The heavy rains commence early in June, and continue, with slight interruptions, to the end of September or middle of October. Showers fall in every month of the year, and particularly in February and March. Owing to the proximity of the hills, the rains are more assured, and less subject to violent variations than in more southerly Districts. The average monthly temperature for the three years ending 1875 is thus returned\u2014January 62\u00b0 F., February 64\u00b0, March 75\u00b0, April 82\u00b0, May 91\u00b0, June 87\u00b0, July 87\u00b0, August 86\u00b0, September 81\u00b0, October 80\u00b0, November 70\u00b0, December 64\u00b0; yearly average, 77.5\u00b0 F. The highest recorded range of the thermometer is 106\u00b0, lowest 48\u00b0 F. Fever is very prevalent in the tardi pargan\u00e1 of T\u00falsipur during the drying up of the rains, and is also common throughout the District. The other principal diseases are scurvy, cholera, diarrhoea, and goitre.

Bennett, Esq., C.S., dated 30th April 1877; the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Census Report for 1881; and the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Provincial and Departmental Administration Reports, 1881 to 1883.]\n\nGonda.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Gonda District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Bahr\u00e1ich and Balr\u00e1mpur tahsils, on the east by Utraula tahsil, on the south by Tarabganj tahsil, and on the west by His\u00e1mpur and Bahr\u00e1ich tahsils. Area, 632 square miles, of which 392 are cultivated; population (1869) 247,107; (1881) 351,185, namely, Hindus, 308,527; Musalm\u00e1ns, 42,583; 'others,' 70. Males numbered 178,938, and females 172,247; number of villages or towns, 780; average density of population, 571 per square mile. The tahsil consists of the two pargan\u00e1s of Gonda and Pah\u00e1rapur.\nGonda.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Gonda tahsil and District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by the Kuw\u00e1na river, which divides it from Balr\u00e1mpur and Utraula pargan\u00e1s; on the east by Sadull\u00e1nagar and M\u00e1nikpur; on the south by Mah\u00e1dewa, Digs\u00e1r, Guw\u00e1rich, and Pah\u00e1rapur pargan\u00e1s; and on the west by Bahraich District. The history of the pargan\u00e1 is identical with that of the District (vide supra). In appearance the pargan\u00e1 is a large, fairly well-wooded plain, with hardly perceptible undulations. In the north are some rather extensive s\u00e1l jungles, but the trees are not of sufficient size to be of much value. Excepting these jungle tracts, the whole pargan\u00e1 is under high cultivation, and produces luxuriant crops of wheat, rice, sugar, gram, Indian corn, and barley. Groves of mah\u00fad trees are dotted all over the pargan\u00e1. The soil is generally a light and fertile loam. Water is obtainable at a depth of from 15 to 20 feet, and irrigation is much practised. Area, 509 square miles, of which 307 square miles, or 196,595 acres, are under cultivation; 111,474 acres yield spring, and 128,410 acres autumn crops; while 43,289 acres bear a double harvest.\n\nAt the time of British annexation, a summary investigation was made into the assets of the pargan\u00e1; and on the principle of taking half as the Government share, the land revenue was fixed at \u00a325,500. A revised assessment was made in 1869\u201370, when a thirty years' settlement was effected at an assessment of \u00a342,404, equal to an average of 4s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 2s. 7\u00bdd. per acre of total area. This increase of upwards of 66 per cent. probably represents, with some approach to accuracy, the rapid extension of cultivation during fifteen years of undisturbed peace.\n\nOf the 652 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 476, paying a revenue of \u00a333,531, are held by tilukd\u00e1rs; and 176, paying a revenue of \u00a38893, are held by independent samind\u00e1rs. Population (1881), Hindus 242,852, and Muhammadans 32,995\u2014total, 275,907, namely, 140,774 males and 135,133 females; average density of population, 524 per square mile. The Br\u00e1hmans are by far the most numerous caste, numbering 71,163, or nearly one-fourth of the entire population. They belong, almost without exception, to the great Sarw\u00e1ri\u00e1 sept, and retain no tradition of their first settlement in the District, of which it is probable that they are among the most ancient inhabitants. Next to the Br\u00e1hmans in point of number come the low-caste Kor\u00eds (28,157), Kurmis (26,022), and Ah\u00edrs (18,450). The semi-monastic order of Gos\u00e1ins numbers 2528 members, some of whom are wealthy landed proprietors. The most peculiar tribe in the pargan\u00e1 are the Barw\u00e1rs, who are said to have migrated from Basti about 200 years ago. Their distinguishing profession is theft, which they carry on with great success, though the rules of their religion sternly restrict their operations to the period between sunrise and sunset. Any one stealing\nby night is at once turned out of caste. The Barw\u00e1rs go on distant plundering expeditions in parties of two or three, and on their return the proceeds are impartially divided, a share being set apart to buy sacrificial offerings of goats and ardent spirits to Devi, and a percentage being paid to the zamind\u00e1r of the village. A police Census returns the number of this caste at 1251 of all ages and sexes in this pargand\u00e1. It is proposed to bring them under the Criminal Tribes Act. The principal markets are at Gonda town, Jigna, Dh\u00e1ngpur, Dubha, R\u00e1jgarh, and Khargupur. Principal exports, wheat and rice; imports insignificant, consisting of salt, brass vessels, and English cotton cloth. Metalled road from Gonda town to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d), and several other unmetalled roads and cart tracks.\n\nGonda.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Gonda District, Oudh; situated 28 miles north-north-west of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d). Lat. 27\u00b0 7' 30\" N., long. 82\u00b0 E. The site on which the town now stands was originally a jungle on the estate of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kur\u00e1sa, in the centre of which was a cattle-fold (Gontha or Goth\u00e1m) where the Ah\u00edrs enclosed their cattle at night as a protection against wild beasts, from which the town derived its name. R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh of Kur\u00e1sa built a palace and fortress here, and it has since been the residence of his successors, under whom the town gradually grew up. As mentioned in the account of GONDA DISTRICT, the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gonda at the time of the Mutiny threw in his cause with the rebels, and his large estates were confiscated. The population of the town and civil station in 1881 was returned at 13,743, namely, 7723 males and 6020 females. Hindus numbered 8954; Muhammadans, 4692; Christians, 69; and 'others,' 28. Area of town site, 203 acres. The place is not now noted for any manufacture, but in the days of native rule was celebrated for its shields, which were in great request. It is not a commercial centre, nor is it of any religious importance to either Hindus or Muhammadans.\n\nThe principal buildings in the native town are\u20142 th\u00e1kurdv\u00e1rd\u00e1s; the palace, which for some hundreds of years formed the residence of the Gonda R\u00e1j\u00e1s, but is now falling into decay; a handsome sardi or rest-house; and a large masonry tank known as the R\u00e1dh\u00e1kund. North-west of the native town, and between it and the civil station, are the civil dispensary and District school, two fine buildings. Beyond these is a large handsome artificial lake, constructed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Seo Pras\u00e1d, and surrounded by groves of tall mango trees and ornamental grounds. On the bank of the lake is a Literary Institute, known as the Anjum\u00e1n-i-rifah, supported by European and native subscribers, and containing a large library. Beyond the S\u00e1g\u00e1r or lake are the civil lines, and what were formerly the cantonments. The troops were withdrawn in 1863; and the only traces of the military occupation of this quarter now left are the barracks, which up till recently were occupied\nas the civil court buildings, a church which has been reduced in size to suit the requirements of the small civil station, a burial-ground, racquet court, and a Government garden, which is carefully kept up, and forms one of the finest pleasure-grounds in Oudh. On what was the parade grounds the handsome new court-house now stands, and south of it the jail. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3936; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\n**Gonda.**\u2014Town in Part\u00e1bgarh (Prat\u00e1pgarh) District, Oudh; 2 miles from Bel\u00e1, on the road from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Fa\u00edz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d). Population (1881) 1752 Hindus, 672 Muhammadans\u2014total, 2424. Said to have been founded by the Gonds. Hindu temple, Government school. Large b\u00e1d\u00e1r, with annual sales amounting to about \u00a31500. Two fairs are held annually in honour of the tutelary goddess, Asht Bhuj\u00ed Devi, each attended by about 2500 people.\n\n**Gondal.**\u2014Native State in Hal\u00e1r pr\u00e1nt, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzerat), Bombay Presidency. Area, 687 square miles; 174 villages; population (1881) 135,604. Hindus numbered 105,329; Muhammadans, 24,654; and \u2018others,\u2019 5623. Estimated gross revenue, as shown in the Administration Report of 1880\u201381, \u00a3125,815. With the exception of the Osham Hills, the country is generally flat. The soil is chiefly black. Several small streams intersect the State, the largest, the Bh\u00e1dar, being navigable by small boats during the rains. For purposes of irrigation, water is drawn in leather bags from wells and rivers by means of bullocks. The climate is good. Products\u2014cotton and grain. Manufactures\u2014cotton cloth, and silver and gold cord. There are 43 miles of first-class metalled road, and 44 miles of unmetalled road between Gondal and R\u00e1jkot; for the rest, internal communication is carried on by the ordinary country tracks. Gondal has always been pre-eminent amongst the States of its class for the vigour and success with which its public works have been prosecuted. The produce is exported from M\u00e1ngrol, Ver\u00e1wal, and Jori\u00e1. There are 38 schools, with 2556 pupils. Gondal ranks as a second-class State among the many States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The ruler entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. He is a Hindu, a R\u00e1jput by caste, of the J\u00e1rej\u00e1 family. The name of the present (1883) chief is Bhagwatsinghj\u00ed Sagr\u00e1mj\u00ed, and his title Th\u00e1kur S\u00e1hib. He was educated at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot, and afterwards travelled in Europe. The State of Gondal pays a tribute of \u00a311,072 in all to the British Government, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr. The family holds no sanad authorizing adoption: the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. The chief has power to try his own subjects only for capital offences. His military force consists of 198 cavalry, and 659 infantry and police, with 16 cannon. No transit dues are levied in the State.\nGondal.\u2014Capital of Gondal State, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 57' 30\" N., long. 70\u00b0 53' E.; population (1881) 13,523. Hindus numbered 7893; Muhammadans, 3562; Jains, 2068. Gondal is connected with R\u00e1jkot, Jetpur, Jun\u00e1garh, Dhor\u00e1ji Upleta, and M\u00e1nikwara by good roads. It is in contemplation to connect it with Sult\u00e1npur Road railway station by a made road. The town is fortified; contains a hospital, dispensary, telegraph office, and post-office.\n\nGond-umri.\u2014Estate in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; 5 to 10 miles north-east of S\u00e1ngarhi; containing 10 small villages, the largest of which is Gond-umri. Area, 17,715 acres, of which only 2862 are cultivated; population (1881) 2722, chiefly Gonds and Dhers. The chief is a Br\u00e1hman.\n\nGondw\u00e1na.\u2014Tract of country, Central Provinces; so called from the aboriginal tribe of Gonds who principally inhabit it.\u2014See CENTRAL PROVINCES.\n\nGonikoppal.\u2014Township in Coorg, known as the 'Bamboo,' on the Mysore-Cannanore Road. Pop. (1881) 328; 10 miles from Verajeudrapett. Head-quarters of the P\u00e1rpattig\u00e1d of the Betiethn\u00e1d. Large weekly market on Sundays, attended by about 5000 coolies from the neighbouring coffee estates.\n\nGoomsar.\u2014T\u00e1luk and town, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See GUMSAR.\n\nGoona (G\u00fana).\u2014District of Gwalior State, Central India; situated between latitudes 24\u00b0 5' and 25\u00b0 7' N., and longitudes 76\u00b0 53' and 77\u00b0 55' E., with an area of 3678 square miles, and a population (1881) of 249,006. Length about 72 miles, with a varying breadth of from 50 to 70 miles. Bounded on the north by the parg\u00e1nd of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r State, and the Kail\u00e1ras District of Sindhia's territory; on the east by the Chanderi District of Gwalior; on the south by the Sironj territory of Tonk, and R\u00e1jgarh State; and on the west by the State of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the Chhabra parg\u00e1nd of Tonk.\n\nThe District comprises seven chiefships, feudatories of Sindhia, but mediatised or guaranteed by the British Government, namely, Bhadaura, Ragugarh, Garha, Dhanaodah, Umri, Paron, and Sirsi; and seven parg\u00e1nds of Sindhia, namely, Bajrangarh, Narod, Pachar, Chachora, Kumr\u00e1j, Mi\u00e1na, and Aron. The general elevation of the tract is about 1800 feet, and it may be described as an elevated plateau drained by the tributaries of the Betw\u00e1 river on the east, the river Sind in the centre, and the Parbati on the west. In the east and west the country is flat, well populated and cultivated; but to the north and south it is much broken by hills, the range that runs through the District forming a continuation of the gh\u00e1ts on the left bank of the K\u00fan\u00fa river. The forests of the hills yield\nmuch timber and bamboo; and in some parts of the district a rich earthy iron-ore is extracted, which is roughly smelted and worked up into farming implements for local use. The wild animals consist of tigers, leopards, hyenas, wolves, antelope and deer of various kinds, and wild pigs. The population comprises R\u00e1jputs, Kher\u00e1s, M\u00edn\u00e1s, Ah\u00edrs, K\u00e1chhis, Cham\u00e1rs, and Bhils, of whom the Ah\u00edrs are the most numerous. The Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs of this tract have for centuries been distinguished by the name of K\u00edch\u00ed, from which the name of K\u00edchiw\u00e1ra is applied to this part of the Gwalior territory. The only towns of any importance are G\u00fana, Bajrangarh, and Raghugarh.\n\nThe crops grown are\u2014wheat, barley, Indian corn, jodr, several pulses and fibres, sugar-cane, and opium. The land is cultivated by zamind\u00e1rs who are tenants-at-will, and, as a class, poor and generally in the hands of money-lenders. In Sindhi\u00e1's seven pargan\u00e1s of the District, a fixed settlement for ten years is made; but in the lands of the seven chiefships, his feudatories, the rental is liable to change yearly. The prevailing prices of food-grains and other articles in the District in 1881 were\u2014for wheat, 54 lbs. per rupee (2s.); for grain, 68 lbs.; for barley, 40 lbs.; for jodr, 72 lbs.; for Indian corn, 89 lbs.; for jaggery, or molasses, 16 lbs.; and for salt, 20 lbs. The district is not much subject to natural calamities, but the absence of rain in July or October causes an occasional drought. In 1868, when scarcely any rain fell, higher prices prevailed than had been known in the previous three decades. No canals or other irrigating works exist, as the rivers run dry periodically; in a few places only has the country been embanked for tanks. The chief road through the District is that which runs from Agra to Indore. Several village roads of minor importance, and under local management, connect the larger places of the District with the outlying towns.\n\nG\u00fana (G\u00fana).\u2014Town in Gwalior State, and head-quarters of the G\u00fana District of Gwalior, Central India. Latitude 24\u00b0 40' N., longitude 77\u00b0 20' E. Situated on the Agra and Indore main road, 202 miles south of Agra, and 135 miles south-east of Gwalior. Population (1881) 3700. G\u00fana is also a British cantonment, at which a regiment of Central India Horse is stationed, the officer commanding being ex officio Political Assistant in charge of the G\u00fana Sub-Agency, and also holding political and magisterial charge of the District and cantonment. Before the Mutiny a large force of the Gwalior cavalry contingent used to be quartered here. A fair is held annually in November, to which large crowds from the neighbourhood resort, and much traffic is carried on. There is a school, with 80 pupils, which is unaided by Government, being maintained by contributions from the neighbouring chiefs, and by local funds to the extent of \u00a3270 yearly. Five miles south of G\u00fana lies the large town of Bajrangarh,\nthe head-quarters of the governor of the District, under whom is a detachment of 4 companies of Sindhia's infantry.\n\n**Gooty (G\u00fati).**\u2014T\u00e1luk of Anantapur District, Madras Presidency. Area, 1010 square miles, with 3 towns and 150 villages. Houses, 21,577. Population (1881) 110,597, namely, 56,400 males and 54,197 females. Hindus numbered 100,160; Muhammadans, 9995; Christians, 406; and 'others,' 36. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1nds), 10; village watch, 77 men. Land revenue, \u00a318,322.\n\n**Gooty (G\u00fati).**\u2014Town in Anantapur District, Madras Presidency; 32 miles from Anantapur town. Latitude 15\u00b0 6' 53\" N., longitude 77\u00b0 41' 32\" E.; containing (1881) 1373 houses and 5373 inhabitants, of whom 3749 were Hindus, 1587 Muhammadans, and 37 Christians. Head-quarters of a Deputy Collector and Magistrate, and of a District munsif or civil judge; post and telegraph offices; sub-jail; and important railway station, 257 miles from Madras.\n\nThe fort of Gooty, built in the early part of the 16th century, was a place of immense strength. It was the stronghold of the great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 guerilla chief, Mor\u00e1ri R\u00e1o, who joined Clive in 1751 on the relief of Arcot. Originally belonging to a dependant of the Vijayanagar family, it formed one of the conquests of M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, the Golconda minister, and a famous general of the Mughal Empire. Gooty was afterwards held by the Path\u00e1ns of Cuddapah and Sawan\u00far, from whom it was wrested in 1714 by the Gauripur family of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the most distinguished of whom obtained, in 1744, the Niz\u00e1m's recognition of his territory as a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 State. In 1776, Haidar Al\u00ed besieged the town, which was forced to capitulate after a siege of four months, the water-supply being exhausted. Haidar used this fortress as his head-quarters in several expeditions against the neighbouring p\u00e1l\u00e9gr\u00e1s. Gooty was captured by the British in the Mysore campaign of 1799.\n\nWilks describes the fort as follows:\u2014'The fort is composed of a number of strong works, occupying the summits of a circular cluster of rocky hills, connected with each other, and enclosing a level space which forms the site of the town. The town is approached from the plain by a single fortified gateway on the south-west, and by two small footpaths across the lower hills, communicating through small sally-ports. An immense smooth rock, rising from the northern limit of the circle, and fortified by gradations surmounted by 14 gateways, overlooks and commands the whole of the other works, and forms a citadel which famine or treachery alone can reduce. The rock is composed of granite, in which red felspar prevails. Its extreme height above the sea has been ascertained to be 2171 feet, but notwithstanding this, the heat in April and May is intense. Its height above the plain is 989\nfeet. On the summit of the hill are several wells and reservoirs for water, and various buildings where State prisoners were confined.\n\nOn one of the bastions overlooking a precipice of about 300 feet, is a small building, called Mor\u00e1ri R\u00e1o's seat. Here the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chieftain was wont to sit and play chess, watching at the same time all that was going on in the town below, or as a spectator of prisoners being hurled from the top of an adjoining precipice and dashed to pieces on the rocks. Besides the fort, the most interesting features in Gooty are the choultry, tomb, and memorial well of Sir Thomas Munro, who died at Pattikonda in 1827.\n\nGop\u00e1lganj.\u2014Town and police station in Faridpur District, Bengal; situated on the Madhumat\u00ed river, in lat. 23\u00b0 0' 22\" N., long. 89\u00b0 52' E.; population (1881) 3402. Famous for jute, rice, salt, and clarified butter. Formerly noted for the manufacture of fine sit\u00e1lpati mats, but only a few of second-rate quality are now made. An evangelical mission was established here in 1874, which is doing good work among the Chand\u00e1l inhabitants.\n\nGop\u00e1lgarh.\u2014Town in Bhartpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated 40 miles north-west of Muttra, on the route from Muttra to Firozpur in the Gurg\u00e1o District. Distance from Firozpur, 12 miles. Dispensary.\n\nGop\u00e1lnagar.\u2014Town in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 3' 50\" N., long. 88\u00b0 48' 40\" E. One of the principal seats of commerce in the District, trade being chiefly carried on by means of permanent markets. The trade, however, has somewhat decreased of late years.\n\nGop\u00e1lpur (Gopaulpore).\u2014Town and seaport in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 19\u00b0 21' 5\" N., longitude 85\u00b0 1' E.; distant 9 miles south-east of Berhampur, the chief town of the District, of which it forms the chief seaport, and 13 miles from Ganj\u00e1m. A place of rapidly increasing importance. Population (1881) 2675, namely, 2504 Hindus, 24 Muhammadans, and 147 Christians. It has a considerable export trade with Europe in grain, myrobolans, hemp, horns, hides, and seeds. The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, betel-nuts, and gunny-bags. French and English vessels load here. It is also a port of call for coasting steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company, as well as for those of private firms. The number of registered boats in 1882 was 106. Value of exports (1880-81), \u00a3307,785; imports, \u00a3132,535. The exports to foreign countries in 1883-84 were valued at \u00a3177,826; to British ports in other Presidencies, \u00a3147,827; to British ports within the Presidency, \u00a372,801; and to Indian ports not British, \u00a31205: total exports (1883-84), \u00a3399,659. Value of customs duty collected:\u2014in 1879, \u00a32295; in 1883-84, \u00a38485. The port light (fixed white) is displayed at an elevation of 80 feet, and is visible from 8 to 10 miles at sea; good anchorage (sand and mud) is found in 8 to 9 fathoms.\nabout 1\u00bd mile off the shore. Post-office; staging bungalow and telegraph office.\n\n**Gop\u00e1lsw\u00e1mi-betta** ('Hill of the shepherd god, Vishnu').\u2014Isolated peak, forming a spur of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, in Mysore district, Mysore State; about 4500 feet above sea-level. Latitude 11\u00b0 43' 20\" N., longitude 76\u00b0 37' 45\" E. Crowned with fortifications, said to have been erected by the Dan\u00e1yak brothers in the 12th century. On the summit stands a temple of Vishnu, attended by two Br\u00e1hmans, at which a car festival is held annually.\n\n**Gop\u00e1mau.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Hardoi tahsil, Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Mansurnagar and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed pargan\u00e1s; on the east by the G\u00famti river, separating it from Chandra, Misrikh, and Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1s; on the south by Sand\u00edla and B\u00e1lamau pargan\u00e1s; and on the west by Bangar, B\u00e1wan, and S\u00e1ra pargan\u00e1s, the S\u00e1i river marking the boundary for a considerable distance.\n\nThe earliest traditions show the Thather\u00e1s in possession of this tract, which they still held in 1033 at the time of Sayyid S\u00e1lar's invasion. A great battle was fought near Gop\u00e1mau between the Musalm\u00e1ns and the Thather\u00e1s, in which the former were successful; but two years afterwards, on the defeat of Sayyid S\u00e1lar at Bahr\u00e1ich, his army of occupation at Gop\u00e1mau was overpowered and put to the sword. The Thather\u00e1s remained masters for some time, when they were ousted by an Ahban chief, named Gopi or Gop\u00e1l Singh, who founded the present town of Gop\u00e1mau. On the overthrow of the Hindu kingdoms of Delhi and Kanauj by Shahab-ud-d\u00edn in 1193 and 1194, the several Kshattriya clans poured into the trans-Ganges Districts, and effected fresh settlements. The Shaikhs obtained a footing in the pargan\u00e1 in Hum\u00e1yun's reign, when two Musalm\u00e1ns were appointed k\u00e1s\u00eds of Gop\u00e1mau; and a descendant still holds the Kasmandi estate. The pargan\u00e1 forms the watershed of the Gumti and S\u00e1i rivers. Round Tandi\u00e1on, in the heart of the pargan\u00e1, is all that now remains of the great Bangar jungle, which up to the British annexation was a robber haunt, which all the efforts of the Oudh troops could not reduce to order.\n\nArea, 328 square miles, of which 172 are cultivated. Staple products\u2014barley, b\u00e1jr\u00e1, and wheat, which occupy three-fifths of the cultivated area. Government land revenue, \u00a317,544; average incidence, 3s. 3d. per acre of cultivated area; and 1s. 8d. per acre of total area. Of the 240 villages constituting the pargan\u00e1, 145 are owned by R\u00e1jputs, the Ahbans slightly predominating; K\u00e1yasths hold 36\u00bd villages; Br\u00e1hmans, 2\u00bd; and grantees, 10. Muhammadans possess 46 villages. Only 28\u00bd villages are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri tenure, 111\u00bd are zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, 95 patt\u00edd\u00e1ri, and 5 bhay\u00e1ch\u00e1ra. Population (1872) 112,006; (1881) 130,786, namely, 70,269 males and 60,517 females.\nThe most numerous castes are Cham\u00e1rs and P\u00e1s\u00eds, who form a third of the entire population. Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs form each about a tenth. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs along the western side of the pargan\u00e1; the Gumti in the east provides water communication; and the S\u00edt\u00e1pur and Mehndigh\u00e1t road runs along the south. In the interior, the only road is the Hardoi and S\u00edt\u00e1pur road, with a branch northward to Gop\u00e1mau, Majhia, and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed. Five schools, of which two are for girls.\n\n**Gop\u00e1mau.**\u2014Principal town in Gop\u00e1mau pargan\u00e1, Hardoi District, Oudh; 2 miles west of the G\u00famti river, 14 miles north-east of Hardoi town, and 20 west of S\u00edt\u00e1pur. Lat. 27\u00b0 32' N., long. 80\u00b0 19' 40\" E. The town is said to have been founded in the 11th century by an Ahban chief named R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gopi, who drove out the Thather\u00e1s from what was then a mere clearing in the forest. The Muhammadan population dates from the invasion of Oudh by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r (1033); since which date it has always been an important seat of Musalm\u00e1n influence. The chief development of the town took place in the reign of Hum\u00e1yun, who first appointed a chaudh\u00e1ri and k\u00e1st for the pargan\u00e1, with their head-quarters in the town. Till 1801, when Sa\u00e1dat \u00c1lf removed the head-quarters of the pargan\u00e1 to Tandi\u00e1on, Gop\u00e1mau seems to have thriven. Many of its residents attained high posts under the Empire, and contributed to the wealth and importance of the town. Numerous mosques, wells, and large buildings attest its importance in the days of Musalm\u00e1n supremacy. In 1881 the town contained a population of 3040 Muhammadans and 2334 Hindus\u2014total, 5374. Area of town site, 159 acres. Two bi-weekly markets; Government school. The only manufacture is one peculiar to the place, the making of arsis, or thumb-mirrors of silver.\n\n**Gor\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the river R\u00e1pti, 1 mile west of Barhaj. Lat. 26\u00b0 33' N., long. 83\u00b0 50' 30\" E. Population (1881) 8485, namely, Hindus, 7848; and Muhammadans, 637. Area of town site, 91 acres.\n\n**Gor\u00e1b\u00e1x\u00e1r.**\u2014The southern suburb of Berhampur town, Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 5' 15\" N., long. 88\u00b0 17' 15\" E. The population consists chiefly of Musalm\u00e1ns and Urdu-speaking immigrants from the north-west. An annual fair called the Chaltia mel\u00e1 is held here in honour of Raghun\u00e1th, attended by about 20,000 people.\n\n**Gor\u00e1gh\u00e1t.**\u2014Ruined city in Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 15' N., long. 89\u00b0 20' E. Once the capital of the eastern Mughal Government, with a revenue circle of 90 l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a3900,000). The capital was removed to Dacca by the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. The site of Gor\u00e1gh\u00e1t is now a vast mass of ruins buried in dense jungle, on the west bank of the Karat\u00f3y\u00e1 river.\n\n**Gor\u00e1i.**\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See Gar\u00e1l.\nGorakhpur.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between $26^\\circ 5' 15''$ and $27^\\circ 28' 45''$ N. lat., and between $83^\\circ 7'$ and $84^\\circ 29'$ E. long. Gorakhpur is a District in the Benares Division. It is bounded on the north by the territory of Nep\u00e1l, on the east by Champ\u00e1ran and S\u00e1ran, on the south by the river Gogra, and on the west by Basti and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d). Area, 4598 square miles; population (1881) 2,617,120 persons.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Gorakhpur lies immediately south of the lower Him\u00e1layan slopes, but itself forms a portion of the great alluvial plain derived from the detritus of the mountain region, and deposited by the mighty rivers which take their rise amid the snow-clad northern heights. No greater elevation than a few sandhills breaks the monotony of its level surface. It is, however, intersected by numerous rivers and streams, and dotted over with lakes and marshes. The water-supply is abundant, and the moisture of the soil gives a verdant appearance to the country, which contrasts strongly with the arid aspect of the Districts south of the Gogra. In the north and centre, extensive tracts of sal forest diversify the scene; the trees are not, as a rule, of any great size, but the density and extent of the woodland strike the eye of a visitor from the populous and highly-cultivated Districts farther south. Immediately below the first range of hills stretches the tard\u00ed or lowland, a tract of sub-montane character, with clear and rapid streams, flowing through a thickly-wooded forest region. Here and there, glades used for pasturage open out among the wilder portions, and the cultivated patches are generally devoted to the growth of rice. The inhabitants are either hillmen like the Gurkh\u00e1s and Nep\u00e1lis, or else aboriginal Th\u00e1rus, who alone can live in the tard\u00ed during the rains, when its pestilential climate drives away all other tribes. The snowy range can be distinctly seen from the frontier.\n\nMoving southward, the forest disappears, and a well-tilled plain is entered, only broken by occasional woods or rare tracts of the saline waste known as \u00fasar. In the south of the District, the general expanse of cultivation is diversified by shady mango groves, or intersected by frequent lakes. The west and south-west are low-lying plains, subject to extensive inundations. In seasons of heavy rain, the water collects in the valley of the Ami, and, joining the lakes to the east, forms an immense inland sea. Beyond the R\u00e1pti the ground rises slightly, but again sinks towards the south-east, and slopes away as it reaches the border of the District. The principal rivers are\u2014the R\u00e1pti, a tortuous torrent, with a very shifting channel; the Gogra, a large river, with a volume of water here surpassing that of the Ganges, navigable by steamers during the rains, and never fordable in the driest weather; the Great Gandak, a clear and rapid stream, full of cataracts and whirlpools, and navigable\nwith difficulty on account of its fierce current and sunken snags; the Little Gandak, the Ku\u00e1na, the Rohin, the Ami, and the Gunghi. The principal lakes are the R\u00e1mgarh, Nandaur, Nawar, Bhenri, Chilhua, and Amiyar T\u00e1ls. The tiger is found in the north, and the jackal, wolf, fox, and wild boar throughout the District; deer are rare. Wild-fowl of all kinds abound on the larger lakes, which are also well stocked with fish. The latter afford a livelihood to numerous boatmen (m\u00e1ld\u00e1s), who rent a lake of the landholder and then fish it in concert.\n\nHistory.\u2014The tract of country north of the river Gogra and between Oudh and Behar, which now forms the Districts of Gorakhpur and Basti, was originally included in the ancient kingdom of Kosala, of which Ajodhya was the capital. It was visited by the deified hero R\u00e1ma, whose death may be placed at about 750 B.C. Gautama Buddha, the founder of the widespread religion which bears his name, was born at K\u00e1pila just beyond the border, and died at K\u00e1sia within this District. A colossal statue still marks the place of his decease. Gorakhpur thus became the head-quarters of the new creed, and was one of the first tracts to receive it. Tradition further recounts that a prince belonging to the Solar dynasty of Ajodhya attempted to found here a great city which should rival the glories of K\u00e1s\u00ed (or Benares); but that when it was nearly completed, he was overwhelmed by an irruption of the Th\u00e1rus and Bhars. These aboriginal and mixed races held all the country north-east of Oudh and the Ganges for a long period, and drove out the Aryans who had at first conquered them. Their re-appearance was apparently connected with the rise of the Buddhist faith. The Bhar chieftains seemed to have held the country at first independently, and afterwards as vassals of the Magadha Buddhists. On the fall of that dynasty, the Bhars regained their autonomy till about 550 A.D. From this time the Aryans began to recover their lost ground; and in 600 A.D., the Rahtors of Kanauj invaded the District, which they conquered up to the modern town of Gorakhpur. Hweng Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, who visited this part of India about the year 630, notices the large number of monasteries and towers, the latter a monument of the continuous struggle between the aboriginal Bhars and their Aryan antagonists, the Rahtors.\n\nAbout 900 A.D., the Domhat\u00e1rs or military Br\u00e1hmans made their first appearance on the scene, and, with other tribes of mixed Br\u00e1hman and R\u00e1jput descent, began to push up from the south and to dispossess the Rahtor chiefs, whom they expelled from the town of Gorakhpur. In the 11th century, Bisen Sen of Nagar became the leading chief in this region; but the Bhars continued to hold the western tracts, until ousted by the Jaipur (Jeypore) R\u00e1j\u00e1s in the time\nof Akbar. Early in the 14th century, the R\u00e1jputs, expelled from the country farther west by the Muhammadans, began to enter this District. Dh\u00far Ch\u00e1nd established himself in Dh\u00fari\u00e1p\u00e1r, and Chandra Sen in Sat\u00e1si. The latter murdered the Domhat\u00e1r chief of Doman-garh (the Gorakhpur fort), seized his stronghold, and established himself in the city. During the whole century, the Batwal and B\u00e1nsi R\u00e1j\u00e1s carried on an incessant warfare, which desolated the whole country; and from 1350 to 1450 the Sat\u00e1si and the Majholi R\u00e1j\u00e1s waged war without intermission. The present town of Gorakhpur was founded about 1400. A century later, the Majholi family held the south-east; the descendants of Dh\u00far Ch\u00e1nd reigned in the south-west; the Aonla and Sat\u00e1si dominions came next; while the extreme north-west belonged to the principality of Batwal. All these R\u00e1j\u00e1s seem to have been quite independent of one another, and isolated from the outer world, as no bridges or roads attest any intercourse with the Districts to the south or east. Until the Mughal period, the Musalm\u00e1ns do not appear to have crossed the Gogra; but in 1576, Akbar passed across it on his return from the successful expedition against D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n of Bengal. The Emperor's general, Fid\u00e1i Kh\u00e1n, defeated all the R\u00e1j\u00e1s who opposed him, and occupied Gorakhpur. Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h visited the District for the sake of its sport during the lifetime of Aurangzeb; but until the establishment of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs of Oudh at Lucknow in 1721, the Musalm\u00e1ns interfered very little with Gorakhpur, and allowed it to be controlled entirely by the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nAfter Sa\u00e1dat Ali's accession, however, a firmer grasp of the District was taken; and in 1750, a large army under Al\u00ed K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n reduced it completely to submission. Even then the Muhammadan governor exercised no real power, and collected what revenue he could obtain through the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who carried on war amongst themselves as they pleased. At the middle of the 18th century, the Banj\u00e1ras had become a perfect scourge to the District. They first appeared from the west about 1725; but thirty years later, united under able leaders, they were formidable enough to contend with chiefs like the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of B\u00e1nsi. They kept the eastern parg\u00e1nds in a constant state of terror, and weakened the power of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s so greatly that the latter could no longer resist the fiscal exactions of the Oudh officials, who plundered and ravaged the country to an extent which they had never ventured to attempt in its more independent days. After the battle of Baxar in 1764, a British officer received command of the Naw\u00e1b's troops, and was instructed to collect the taxes of Gorakhpur; but all he could do was to sub-let the collection to native revenue farmers, who rack-rented the cultivators in a merciless manner. The District formed part of the territory ceded by Oudh to the British under the\ntreaty of 1801; and an officer was immediately put in charge of the country now divided between the Districts of Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, and Basti.\n\nEfforts were made to bring this extensive region under a firmly-organized Government, and the revenue was reduced from time to time, to meet the needs of the landholders. An invasion of the Nep\u00e1lis in 1813 was successfully repulsed; and the District was happily free from the incidents of history until the Mutiny of 1857. It was then lost for a short time at the beginning of the disturbances, but soon after recovered by the aid of the friendly Gurkh\u00e1s. Later on, in the month of August, the rebels under Muhammad Hassan occupied the whole District; and it was not till the 6th of January 1858 that the Gurkh\u00e1 army under Jang Bah\u00e1dur marched in and occupied Gorakhpur. Muhammad Hassan was then driven out of the city, and shortly afterwards the other rebels were expelled from the outlying pargands, which once more passed under our rule.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1853, the Gorakhpur Census returned the number of inhabitants at 1,816,390. By 1865 the figures had risen to 2,024,150, showing an increase of 207,760 persons, or 11\u00b74 per cent. In 1872, upon a reduced area, corresponding to the present District, there was an apparent falling off to 2,019,361. At the last Census, however, in 1881, the population was ascertained to be 2,617,120, showing an increase of 597,759, or 29\u00b76 per cent., in the nine years. The enumerations of 1872 and 1881 are both calculated upon an area of 4598 square miles.\n\nThe Census of the latter year disclosed a total of 2,617,120 persons, distributed among 7238 villages or towns, and inhabiting an aggregate of 448,925 houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 569; villages per square mile, 1\u00b75; houses per square mile, 97; persons per village, 361; persons per house, 5\u00b78. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 1,306,123; females, 1,310,997. In religion, Gorakhpur still retains for the most part the original creed of its Aryan conquerors. The Census shows a total of 2,354,915 Hindus, or 89\u00b79 per cent., as against 261,196 Musalm\u00e1ns, or 10\u00b71 per cent. The District also contains 35 Sikhs, 41 Jews, and 933 Christians. The higher caste Hindus consist of 244,386 Br\u00e1hmans, 90,266 R\u00e1jputs, and 97,005 Baniy\u00e1s. The other respectable Hindu castes include\u2014K\u00e1yasths or writers, forming an important element in the official class, 27,272; Bhuinhars, landholders and cultivators, 27,802; Kurm\u00eds, cultivators, 149,812; Kachh\u00eds, cultivators, 150,186; Tamb\u00fal\u00eds, betel sellers, 25,658; Tel\u00eds, oil pressers and sellers, 73,042; Gad\u00e1ri\u00e1s, shepherds, 17,135; Nais, barbers, 35,591; Dhob\u00eds, washermen, 37,974; Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, 45,964; Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths, 47,803; Barhais, carpenters, 22,463; Kah\u00e1rs, domestic servants, palanquin-bearers, and agricultural labourers, 102,653; Sonars, goldsmiths, 15,149. The inferior castes comprise\u2014\nAhirs, agriculturists, 307,685; Chamars, leather dealers and labourers, the most numerous caste in the District, 326,205; Mallahs, boatmen, 154,747; Kalwars, distillers, 30,806; Loni\u00e1s, salt-makers and diggers, 60,541; P\u00e1s\u00eds, palm-toddy sellers, 39,121; Bhars, cultivators and labourers, the modern representatives of the once dominant tribe of the country, 63,451. The Musalm\u00e1ns consist of 260,708 Sunnis and 488 Shi\u00e1s.\n\nSouth of Gorakhpur, and particularly along the Gogra, the country is densely inhabited, and the peasantry are comfortably housed, and as civilised as the inhabitants of the southern Districts; but in the extreme north, where forests still abound, the people remain in a very backward condition, living in miserable huts, and being generally wilder, poorer, and more barbarous than the Do\u00e1b tribes. The only trade in that part of the District is the through traffic from Nep\u00e1l, and the roads are few and bad. The great density of population throughout renders the masses extremely poor, the standard of living low, and the margin of superfluity against evil times exceedingly narrow. There were 11 towns in 1881 with a population exceeding 5000 souls\u2014namely, Gorakhpur, 57,922; Barhaj, 11,715; Rudrapur, 9843; Gora, 8485; Lar, 7408; Gola, 7193; Pania, 6642; Bansgaon, 5873; Badhalganj, 5779; Majhauli, 5599; and Madanpur, 5099. The aggregate urban population amounted to 131,549.\n\nThe vast majority of the inhabitants are scattered over the country in small hamlets. Of the 7238 villages comprising the District, 3197 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 2741 from two to five hundred, 914 from five hundred to a thousand, 303 from one to two thousand, 55 from two to three thousand, 17 from three to five thousand, 9 from five to ten thousand, 1 from ten to fifteen thousand, and 1 upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants. Classified according to occupations, the Census Report returned the male population under the following six main groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including all Government servants, civil and military, and the learned professions, 9488; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 3830; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 16,752; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 733,099; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 49,694; (6) indefinite and unspecified (consisting of 23,138 general labourers, and 479,122 persons of unspecified occupation), 502,260.\n\nVillage Communities.\u2014The villages in Gorakhpur exemplify each of the three usual tenures\u2014pattid\u00e1ri, with imperfect pattid\u00e1ri, samind\u00e1ri, and bhay\u00e1ch\u00e1ra; but the village here has never assumed the same importance as a clearly separate unit which it possesses in the revenue system of other Districts. The bond of connection among the landholding classes was a feudal attachment to the R\u00e1ja on whom they were dependent; and village communities, in the sense of associa-\ntions bound together by common proprietorship and residence in the same hamlet, were rare and of little importance. The various dependants and relatives of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 were at first obliged to live with their chief, in order to be constantly at hand for his defence; and villages grew up around the fort or house of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 as soon as his following became too large to be accommodated within its walls. The more defined and customary unit in this District is the tappa or hundred, a sub-division of the pargan\u00e1, which appears to have existed before the time of the Muhammadans. In many cases the tappas correspond with natural divisions formed by rivers or other physical features; but very often they appear to be purely artificial, and probably represent the tract made over by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 to some one of his dependants on a feudal tenure. In consequence of this peculiarity, the earlier revenue settlements were not made by villages, but by taluks and tappas. The Muhammadan divisions of chaklds and sark\u00e1rs were never much known in Gorakhpur, as their revenue system did not fully develop itself under the imperfect and transitory administration which they maintained in this outlying dependency. The uniformity of British rule, however, is making itself felt in this respect.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Gorakhpur District contains a total cultivated area of 2785 square miles, but there still remains a margin of 1171 square miles available for cultivation, most of which is now forest. The mode of tillage does not differ from that which prevails elsewhere throughout the great alluvial basin of the Ganges and its tributaries. There are two great harvests a year, in the autumn and in the spring. The kharif or autumn crops are sown after the first rain in June, and gathered in October or November. They consist of cotton, rice, bajra, jodr, moth, and other food-grains. The rati or spring crops are sown immediately after the autumn harvest, and reaped in March or April. They are mainly composed of wheat, barley, oats, peas, and other pulses. Manure is used, where it can be obtained, for both harvests. Spring and autumn crops are seldom taken off the same ground, but sometimes a plot of early rice is gathered in August, and a second crop sown in its place for the spring harvest. Owing to the heavy and long-continued rains at the foot of the Him\u00e1layas, the country is often flooded, and the rabi sowing delayed much later than in other Districts. A great part of the surface is so long inundated, that it yields no autumn crops at all, the spring seed being sown as soon as the water clears off. This flooded land, however, is rendered exceedingly fertile by the deposits which are left behind as the waters recede. The forests possess little economical value. Wild honey is their chief product; the Bhars contract to collect it, and sell it in the neighbouring towns. The trees used to be tapped for their gum, but this practice has been stopped since the forests passed into the hands of Government. Com-\npared with the misrule and oppression which took place under the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s and the Musalm\u00e1n revenue-farmers, the condition of the people is now vastly improved.\n\nThe total male agricultural population of Gorakhpur in 1881 numbered 731,365, cultivating an average of 2'44 acres each. The total agricultural population, however, dependent on the soil, amounted to 2,276,514, or 86'99 per cent. of the District population. Of the total area of 4598 square miles, 4253 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 2751 square miles are under cultivation, 866 square miles are cultivable, and 636 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3199,835, or an average of 2s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rental actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3451,179, or 5s. 0\u00bed. per cultivated acre. Wages and prices are still on the whole rather lower than in the Districts to the south of the Gogra; but the construction of the Patna-Bahraich Railway will probably increase the demand for labour, besides equalizing the cost of necessaries. Coolies and unskilled hands receive from 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. a day; agricultural labourers from 2\u00bdd. to 3d.; bricklayers and carpenters from 6d. to 2s. Women get about one-fifth less than men, while children are paid one-half or one-third the wages of an adult. Prices ruled as follows in 1876:\u2014Wheat, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; rice, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; jodhr, 38 sers per rupee, or 3s. per cwt.; bajra, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt. Prices ranged higher in 1882-83, and are thus returned in the official reports. Wheat, 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 11d. per cwt.; rice, from 19 to 13\u00bd sers per rupee, or from 5s. 11d. to 8s. 4d. per cwt.; jodhr, 30\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 8d. per cwt.; bajra, 23\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 9d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Gorakhpur, being a naturally moist and rainy District, suffers less from famine than most other portions of the great north-western plain. The distress in 1780 and 1783 did not seriously affect the Districts beyond the Gogra. In 1803 the rice harvest failed, and the spring crops were endangered, but rain fell in September, and the scarcity was never very severe. The next great famine, in 1837-38, was most heavily felt in the Upper Do\u00e1b and Bundelkhand, and did not seriously attack Gorakhpur. The District suffered somewhat, however, in the dearth of 1860-61, when, under the pressure of want, crimes against property became twice as numerous as in ordinary years. In 1873-74 the drought extended to the Districts of Gorakhpur and Basti, and it became necessary to establish relief works in the spring of 1874. The rains shortly afterwards put an end to the distress, and the relief measures were at once discontinued.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commerce of Gorakhpur is chiefly\nconfined to the export of agricultural produce; but there is a small amount of through traffic with Nep\u00e1l. Barhaj is the principal mart of the District. In the north, the trade in rice and pepper is considerable, and that in timber, iron, and copper is large and increasing. The means of communication are still imperfectly developed. No railroad passes through the District, and the nearest railway stations are at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) (80 miles), Akbarpur (68 miles), or Zam\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 (76 miles). A good metalled road runs due south from Gorakhpur to Benares via Barhalganj, with a length of 36 miles in this District. It is carried over the depression of the Amiyar and Bigra lakes by an embankment 3 miles long, known as the Tucker bandh, flanked with solid masonry, and having four considerable bridges on its line. Another metalled road leads from Gorakhpur to Basti and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, with a length of 15 miles in this District. There are 910 miles of unmetalled road, of which 527 are raised and bridged throughout. The R\u00e1pti is navigable for country boats, which convey a large amount of grain and timber into the Gogra, and thence down to the Ganges. The Gogra itself receives a considerable quantity of grain from Barhaj and Barhalganj for the Ganges ports. Rafts of timber are floated down the fierce and dangerous channel of the Great Gandak from Nep\u00e1l, besides grain and sugar from this District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The local staff generally consists of a Collector-Magistrate, 2 Joint Magistrates, and 1 Deputy, besides the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary establishments. The whole amount of revenue\u2014imperial, municipal, and local\u2014raised in the District in 1876 was \u00a3227,738, being at the rate of 2s. 2\u00bdd. per head of the population. In 1880\u201381, the gross imperial revenue was returned at \u00a3211,225. A new settlement of the land revenue was commenced in 1859 and completed in 1871. The land-tax in 1876 produced a total sum of \u00a3168,071, and in 1881\u201382, \u00a3170,171. In 1880, the total strength of the regular police force amounted to 788 officers and men, including 162 municipal or town police; while the cost of their maintenance was returned at \u00a38953, of which the State contributed \u00a38120, and local funds \u00a3833. These figures give an average of 1 policeman to every 5\u00b78 square miles of area and every 3334 of the population, maintained at a rate of \u00a31, 19s. 2d. per square mile, or less than 1d. per head of the inhabitants. The regular force was supplemented by a rural body of 2298 village watchmen (chaukiddrs). The District jail contained in 1880 a daily average of 584 prisoners, of whom 529 were males and 55 females. There are 18 imperial and 19 local post-offices in the District, but no telegraph station. Education was carried on in 1880 by means of 8592 inspected schools, with a total roll of 8592 pupils. Fifteen of these were girls' schools. There are also numerous uninspected private schools for\nwhich no statistics are available; and the Census Report returned 20,291 boys and 278 girls as under instruction in 1881, and 47,653 males and 1087 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. For fiscal purposes, Gorakhpur is sub-divided into 6 tahsils and 12 parganas.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The District is not subject to very intense heat, being secured from extremes by its vicinity to the hills, and by the moisture of its soil. Dust storms are rare, and cool breezes from the north, rushing down the gorges of the Himalayas, succeed each interval of very hot weather. The climate is, however, relaxing, and there is no bracing cold. The southern and eastern portions, where the jungle has been cleared, is as healthy as most parts of the Province; but the tarai and the forest tracts are still subject to malaria. The average rainfall for a period of 30 years ending 1881 was 48.68 inches; the maximum was 60 inches in 1861, and the minimum 25 inches in 1868. In 1881, the total rainfall was 50.88 inches, or 2.20 inches above the average. The mean monthly temperature in the shade was 77\u00b0 F. in 1870, and 76\u00b0 in 1871; the extreme range was from 61\u00b0 in January to 90\u00b0 in June. The total number of deaths reported in 1880 was 72,133, or 19.8 per thousand of the population. There are 6 charitable dispensaries in the District\u2014at Gorakhpur, Rudarpur, Kasia, Barhalganj, Bela Haria, and Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj. In 1882 they afforded relief to a total number of 50,126 patients, of whom 953 were in-door and 49,686 were out-door patients.

The\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 commanded a force of 1000 R\u00e1jpur cavalry, and held the pargan\u00e1 of Amethi in j\u00e1gir for the pay of the troops. On building the town and his fort, the extensive ruins of which are still in existence, he transferred the head-quarters of the pargan\u00e1 hither, and altered the name of the pargan\u00e1 to that of the town. His power must have been considerable, for on one occasion, when the Naw\u00e1b was flying before the English after the battle of Baxar, the Gos\u00e1in refused him admission and shelter within the walls of his fort. On the conclusion of peace between the Naw\u00e1b and the English, however, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 found it expedient to leave the place, and retire to his native village near Hardw\u00e1r, where a small j\u00e1gir was granted him by the British. The population of Gos\u00e1inganj in 1881 amounted to 2923, almost exclusively Hindus, dwelling in 596 houses. The town is clean and well kept, with a conservancy establishment maintained by levy of a house-tax. Gos\u00e1inganj has always been noted as a flourishing market town, and a brisk local trade is carried on. It has the advantage of direct communication with Lucknow and Cawnpur by a road connecting it with the Cawnpur imperial road at Bani bridge on the left bank of the Sai. This road is the great outlet for country produce, and in turn conveys to Gos\u00e1inganj European piece-goods and articles of English manufacture. Annual value of sales in the market are estimated at \u00a319,150. Two religious festivals in the year are held in honour of the local goddess, each attended by about 5000 people, at which some trade is carried on.

Although of considerable size, it is the most difficult river to enter of any on the coast, on account of a bending channel at its mouth. A vessel entering it must bring the middle of the land on the east side of the river to bear north, and steer directly in for it till near shore; she ought then to steer to the westward until close to B\u00e1ng\u00e1dun\u00ed island, whence the channel takes a fairly straight direction to the north.\n\nGubb\u00ed.\u2014Town in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State; 13 miles by road west of T\u00famk\u00far; head-quarters of the Kadaba t\u00e1luk.

Said to have been founded about 400 years ago by the gauda or chief of Hosahalli, the head of\nthe tribe of Nonaba Wokligars. His descendant was dispossessed by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, and the family are now ordinary cultivators, though their rank is acknowledged in their own tribe. Gubbi has suffered much from the antagonistic spirit prevailing between the rival trading castes of Komatis and Ban\u00e1jig\u00e1s or Ling\u00e1yats, and was once in danger of being entirely abandoned owing to their dissensions. There are fairs, both weekly and annual, frequented by merchants from great distances.

It includes the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and is bounded on the north by R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1, on the east by the spurs of the Vindhya and S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 ranges, on the south by the Konk\u00e1n, and on the west by the sea. On the mainland, it comprises the British Districts of Surat, Broach, Kaira, Panch Mahals, and Ahmadabad, with a total area of 10,158 square miles, and a population (1881) of 2,857,731; together with the scattered territories of the Ga\u00e9kw\u00e1r of Baroda, the Native States of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, the Mahi Kantha and Rewa Kantha Agencies, the States of the P\u00e1lanpur Superintendency, the States of Cutch, Cambay, and N\u00e1rdkot, and the States under the Surat Agency (B\u00e1nsda, Dharampur, and S\u00e1chin), with a total area of 59,880 square miles, and a population (1881) of 6,922,049; grand total area for Gujar\u00e1t, 70,038 square miles; grand total population (1881) 9,779,780, or more than one-half the population of the Bombay Presidency. The term Gujar\u00e1t is sometimes employed to exclude the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, with its 180 petty States. Total area, exclusive of the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, 41,536 square miles. For an account of the history, geography, etc. of Gujar\u00e1t, the reader is referred to the articles on the various States and Districts mentioned above. Gujar\u00e1t gives its name to the vernacular of Northern Bombay, viz. Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed, which forms one of the three great languages of that Presidency; the other two being Kanarese on the south coast, and Mar\u00e1th\u00ed in the central and southern regions.\n\n**Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 32' and 32\u00b0 33' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 11' 30\" and 74\u00b0 28' 15\" E. long. Gujs\u00e1nw\u00e1la is the north-western District of the Lahore Division. It is bounded on the north-west by the river Chen\u00e1b, which separates it from Gujar\u00e1t and Sh\u00e1hpur; on the south and south-east by the Districts of Jhang, Montgomery, and Lahore; and on the east by the District of Si\u00e1lkot. Area, 2587 square miles; population (1881) 616,892. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Gujr\u00e1nwala.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la forms the central portion of the Rechna Do\u00e1b, intermediate between the fertile sub-montane plains of Si\u00e1lkot and the desert expanses of Jhang. It displays, accordingly, all the transition stages by which the rich silt of the lower Him\u00e1layan slopes merges into the waterless level characteristic of North-Western India. On the northern frontier, a belt of alluvial land, some 2 to 6 miles in breadth, fringes the Chen\u00e1b.\nthroughout its course, and marks the wider valley within which the river has now and again shifted its uncertain channel. This low-lying strip is bounded on the south by a steep bank, whence the central uplands rise at once to the general level, which they maintain across the whole Do\u00e1b. For 10 miles from the river-bed, the influence of the water is felt in all the wells; but beyond that line, the country becomes entirely dependent upon the rainfall for its harvest. The eastern portion of the plateau, bordering on Si\u00e1lkot, has a rich soil, with accessible water, and is quite equal in productive power to the country immediately above it; the villages here lie close together, while the people are careful and industrious cultivators.\n\nReceding from the hills, the soil becomes harder and drier, the water is hidden at greater depths, and the villages begin to lie farther apart. At last, in the extreme south, we reach the desolate table-land known as the b\u00e1r, a flat expanse of seemingly barren land, covered with low jungle, and only covered by grass after the rainy season has brought out the natural fertility of its thirsty soil. On its southern border the b\u00e1r assumes its worst characteristics, and passes slowly into the utter desert of JHANG. Even here, however, a few large marshes are to be found, whose stagnant waters serve as the last resource of cattle in seasons of drought. In the south-east corner of the District, the little river DEGH irrigates and fertilizes a tiny valley of its own, which its annual inundations supply with a rich deposit of loam. Two or three minor watercourses carry off the surface drainage into the Degh or the Chen\u00e1b, and are used for purposes of irrigation in the villages through which they pass. The District is very bare of trees, having little timber except the scrubby brushwood of the b\u00e1r, which is only useful for firewood. Its scenery is everywhere tame, and in the central plateau becomes tediously monotonous. Yet it would be possible, by means of an extensive irrigation system, to raise the productiveness of the driest parts to as high a level as that now attained by the most fertile portions of the northern slope.\n\nHistory.\u2014The District of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la is essentially a modern creation, alike in its boundaries, its population, and its principal towns; yet it can claim important relics of the past, constructed during an early period of prosperity, which is completely separated from its later annals by a comparative blank. It seems likely, indeed, that the District once contained the capital of the Punjab, at an epoch when Lahore had not yet begun to exist. We learn from the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, that about the year 630 he visited a town known as Tse-kia (or TAKI), the metropolis of the whole country of the Five Rivers. The site of this town has been identified by General Cunningham with a mound near the modern village of ASARUR in this District, where immense ruins of Buddhist origin are still to be seen. Their\ndate is marked by the discovery of coins, as well as by the great size of the bricks, which is characteristic of the period in which they were constructed. After the time of Hwen Thsang, we know as little of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la as of Indian Districts generally, until the Muhammadan invasions brought back regular chronological history. Meanwhile, however, T\u00e1ki had fallen into oblivion, and Lahore had become the chief city of the Punjab.\n\nUnder Muhammadan rule, the District flourished. From the days of Akbar to those of Aurangzeb, wells were scattered over the whole country, and villages lay thickly dotted about the southern plateau, now a barren waste of grass land and scrub jungle. Their remains may still be found in the wildest and most solitary reaches of the b\u00e1r. Eminabad and Hafizabad were the chief towns, while the country was divided into 6 well-tilled parganas. But before the close of the Muhammadan period, a mysterious depopulation fell upon this tract, the reasons of which are even now by no means clear. The tribes at present occupying the District are all immigrants of recent date, and before their advent the whole region seems for a time to have been almost entirely abandoned. Indeed, there is reason to think that most of the occupying clans have not held villages in the District for more than sixty years, and that previously their ancestors were nomad graziers in the ruined plain of the b\u00e1r. The only plausible conjecture to account for this sudden and disastrous change is that of the settlement officers, who regard it as a simple result of the constant wars by which the Punjab was convulsed during the last years of Muhammadan supremacy.\n\nOn the Sikh reaction, the waste plains of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la were seized by the military adventurers who then sprang up. Charat Singh, the grandfather of the great Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh, took possession of the village of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, then an inconsiderable hamlet, and made it the head-quarters of himself and his son and grandson. Minor Sikh chieftains settled at Wazirabad, Shekhupura, and other towns; while in the western portion of the District, the R\u00e1jput Bhattis and Chattahs maintained a sturdy independence. In the end, however, Ranjit Singh succeeded in bringing all the scattered portions of the District under his own power. The great Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 was himself born at Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, and the town continued to be his capital up to his occupation of Lahore. The Sikh rule, which was elsewhere so disastrous, appears to have been an unmitigated benefit to Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. Ranjit Singh settled large colonies in the various villages, and was very successful in encouraging cultivation throughout the depopulated plain of the b\u00e1r. In the Degh valley, especially, he planted a body of hard-working Hindus, the Lab\u00e1sas, to whom he granted the land at a nominal rent, on condition that each cultivator should break up and bring under\ntillage the ground allotted to him. On the other hand, the paternal rule of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 is said to have unfitted the people for self-reliant exertion under a more liberal r\u00e9gime.\n\nIn 1847 the District came under British influence, in connection with the regency at Lahore; and two years later, in 1849, it was included in the territory annexed after the second Sikh war. It formed a part originally of the extensive District of Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d, which comprised the whole upper portion of the Rechna Do\u00e1b. In 1852, this unwieldy territory was sub-divided between Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la and Si\u00e1lkot. The present District, as then constituted, stretched across the entire plateau, from the Chen\u00e1b to the R\u00e1vi; but in 1853, the south-eastern fringe, consisting of 303 villages, was transferred to Lahore; and three years later, a second batch of 324 villages was similarly handed over to the same District. Since that time Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la has enjoyed an immunity from the catastrophes of history, with the exception of the events of 1857, which, however, are in it more properly connected with the general annals of India than with the records of a single tract. Under Sikh and British rule, the relative importance of the various towns has been completely revolutionized; Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la and Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d have risen to the first place in wealth and populousness, while the older cities have declined into mere villages. In the early days of British rule, there was a considerable military cantonment at Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d. The only remains of it now visible are two European cemeteries.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Owing to the large transfers of territory between this District and Lahore, it is impossible to employ the statistics afforded by the Census of 1855 for purposes of direct comparison; but there is reason to believe that the total increase in the population of the District, as at present constituted, between 1855 and 1868, amounted to 63,420, or 13\u00b701 per cent. The enumeration in the latter year disclosed a population of 550,922 on the area corresponding to the present District. In 1881 the Census returned the population at 616,892, showing an increase of 65,970, or 11\u00b78 per cent., in thirteen years. The details of the enumeration of 1881 may be thus summarized\u2014Area of District, 2587 square miles, with 10 towns and 1186 villages; number of houses, 118,158, of which 88,571 were occupied and 29,587 unoccupied. Total population, 616,892, namely, males 333,605, and females 283,287; number of families, 124,492. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 238; villages per square mile, 0\u00b746; persons per village, 518; houses per square mile, 46; persons per house, 6\u00b796. In religion the District is mainly Muhammadan, though the Hindu element is much stronger here than in the border region to the north-west. The Census shows the following numbers and percentages:\u2014\nMusalm\u00e1ns, 452,640, or 73\u00b73 per cent.; Hindus, 127,322, or 20\u00b76 per cent.; Sikhs, 36,159, or 5\u00b78 per cent.; Jains, 577; and Christians, 194.\n\nAs regards the ethnical division and caste distinctions of the people, the Br\u00e1hmans number 18,080, a few of whom are employed in agriculture or commerce, while the greater part maintain themselves by the exercise of their priestly functions. With the exception of 25 returned as Muhammadans, they are all Hindus or Sikhs. The Khattris (21,301) and Aror\u00e1s (30,079), both Hindus by creed, are the chief mercantile tribes. They also hold respectively 49 and 4 villages in the District, their landed property having been generally acquired by recent purchase. The Baniy\u00e1s are only represented by 160 persons, as their usual functions of bankers and money-lenders are here usurped by the Khattris and Aror\u00e1s. The J\u00e1ts (or J\u00e1ts, as they are locally called) number in all 173,979 persons, or 28\u00b73 per cent. of the whole population. Farther north, their fellow-tribesmen have almost universally abandoned the Hindu creed\u2014with its caste exclusiveness and narrow restrictions which press so heavily on the inferior classes\u2014in favour of the comparative equality offered by Isl\u00e1m; but in Gujranwala, more than one-sixth of the tribe still retain their ancient faith, 133,727 being returned as Musalm\u00e1ns, while 23,373 are enumerated as Hindus. Most of them lay claim to R\u00e1jput origin, a pedigree which is not improbable, as large clans of J\u00e1ts appear to be composed of broken R\u00e1jput stocks. As elsewhere, they are industrious and cheerful cultivators, and they own no less than 549 villages. Some of the clans, however, still lead a nomad life in the wild pasture-lands of the b\u00e1r. The R\u00e1jputs returned as such number 36,484, almost exclusively Muhammadans; amongst whom the half-tamed Bhatts of the south-west form the principal sub-division. They are a pastoral tribe, who till only so much land as is absolutely requisite for their subsistence, and accumulate great wealth from the produce of their herds. The other Muhammadan tribes are Shaikhs (8557), Sayyids (6339), Mughals (827), Path\u00e1ns (912), Baluchis (2800), G\u00fajars (1986), Kashmir\u00eds (6186), Mir\u00e1s\u00eds (12,224), and Khw\u00e1j\u00e1s (3458).\n\nThe Census Report returned the following ten towns:\u2014Gujranwala, 22,884; Wazirabad, 16,462; Ramnagar, 6830; Eminabad, 5886; Sohdra, 4464; Akalgarh, 4312; Pindi Bhattian, 3528; Kila Didar Singh, 2822; Hafizabad, 2453; and Jalalpur, 2353. These figures show a total urban population of 71,994 persons, or 11\u00b76 per cent. of the inhabitants. Of the 1196 towns and villages comprising the District, 371 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 491 from two to five hundred, 197 from five hundred to a thousand, 74 from one to two thousand, 36 from two to three thousand, 23 from three to five thousand, 2 from five to ten thousand, and 2 upwards of ten thousand. Classified according to occupation, the Census returns the\nadult male population under the following seven groups:\u2014(1) Professional, 9575; (2) domestic, 17,139; (3) commercial, 5798; (4) agricultural, 86,081; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 50,770; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 15,670; (7) unspecified, 15,518. The language in common use is Panjabi, but the townspeople and more intelligent peasants understand Urdu.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014According to the returns for 1881, the total cultivated area of Gujranwala amounts to 611,812 acres, while the cultivable margin reaches the high figure of 697,457 acres, of which 379,844 acres were grazing land. The cultivated area in 1850\u201351 amounted to only 424,184 acres, the increase of tillage during the thirty years being 44.2 per cent. The staple crop of the District is wheat, which occupies one-third of the cultivated area. The principal agricultural products, with the extent occupied by each, were returned as follows in 1881\u201382:\u2014Rabi or spring harvest\u2014wheat, 231,694 acres; barley, 86,810 acres; gram, 22,770 acres; tobacco, 3947 acres; oil-seeds, 9046 acres; vegetables, 13,134 acres; Khartif or autumn harvest\u2014rice, 14,609 acres; jo\u00e1r, 53,249 acres; bdjra, 3413 acres; Indian corn, 23,471 acres; pulses, 67,763 acres; oil-seeds, 7179 acres; cotton, 32,551 acres; sugar-cane, 20,934 acres; vegetables, 20,454 acres. Of all these, the most valuable crop in proportion to its acreage is sugar-cane; it is the most remunerative product grown in the District, and its cultivation is steadily increasing. Within the last few years, the out-turn of sugar has doubled, and all the irrigated land of the Wazirabad and Gujranwala pargans is now covered by waving fields of the green cane. Cotton was largely produced during the scarcity which followed the American war, but the cultivation has now shrunk once more to the normal demand for home consumption. The evergreen shrub mehndi, from whose leaves a valuable scarlet dye, the henna of the East, is procured, forms an occasional crop in the District; it might be grown in much larger quantities to advantage, but the development of this important industry is retarded by the superstition of the peasantry, who regard the plant as unlucky, and walk about in the constant dread of sudden death if they possess a patch of it in their holding. Irrigation is very general, as many as 368,246 acres being artificially watered from private works in 1882. Part of this area is supplied from the natural overflow of the Chen\u00e1b and the Degh; the remainder is irrigated by wells, or by Persian wheels in connection with natural and artificial ponds. The use of manure is also common, especially for the richer crops, such as sugar-cane, cotton, tobacco, maize, and garden produce, almost all of which also require copious watering and great attention. Wheat is likewise very generally manured. Rotation of crops, though still in its infancy, is partially practised. The land always\nreceives at least two or three ploughings for each harvest; in the case of the richer products, eight or ten are found necessary; while soil intended for sugar-cane is sometimes ploughed as many as sixteen times. The average out-turn of wheat per acre is 454 lbs., valued at \u00a33s. 4\u00bdd.; that of sugar-cane is 618 lbs., valued at \u00a31, 16s. 4\u00bdd. Most of the land is held under the tenure known as pattid\u00e1ri, in which the rights and liabilities of sharers are regulated by ancestral or customary usage. Few of the tenants have acquired hereditary or occupancy rights.\n\nRents ruled as follows in 1881-82, in accordance with the nature of the crop for which the soil is fitted:\u2014Rice lands, from 6s. to 10s.; cotton lands, from 8s. to 10s.; sugar lands, from 16s. to \u00a31, 4s.; wheat (irrigated), from 6s. to 10s. and (unirrigated) from 4s. to 6s.; inferior grains (irrigated), from 4s. to 6s. and (unirrigated) from 2s. Agricultural labourers are universally paid in kind. Of a total area of 2587 square miles, 1992 square miles are assessed at a Government revenue, including cesses and rates levied upon land, of \u00a356,955. Rental actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3133,645. In the towns, wages ruled as follows in 1882:\u2014Skilled labour, from 4\u00bdd. to 9d. per diem; unskilled labour, from 3\u00bdd. to 6d. per diem. On the 1st January 1883, the prices of food-grains were returned at the following rates:\u2014Wheat, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; gram, 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 46 sers per rupee, or 2s. 5d. per cwt.; jodr, 48 sers per rupee, or 2s. 4d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District is purely local in its character. The only exports are agricultural produce, brass vessels, leathern bottles, and timber. The return trade consists of salt, iron, cattle, spices, and English piece-goods. Sugar, wheat, gh\u00ed, and wool are sent down the Chen\u00e1b from Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d, R\u00e1m\u00e1nagar, and other water-side towns; land transport is chiefly effected by means of camels. The manufactures are almost confined to cotton and woollen fabrics for home consumption; but the smiths of Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d have a good reputation for small cutlery and ornamental hardware, and several of them are very fair armourers and gunmakers. The principal religious fair is held at Dhonkal, at which it is calculated that 200,000 persons assemble. As usual, business is largely mixed with the sacred character of the festival. The great channel of communication is the Northern Punjab State Railway from Lahore to Pesh\u00e1war, which runs through the District, with stations at K\u00e1moki, Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Ghakkar, and Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Grand Trunk Road, connecting the same places, traverses the District for a distance of 42 miles, metalled and bridged throughout. Of unmetalled roads, there are 1055 miles in Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, besides a number of local by-ways. The Chen\u00e1b is navigable throughout for country boats, the chief river marts being those of\nWazirabad, Ramnagar, and Mahanwala. A line of telegraph runs along the side of the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary civil staff of Gujranwala consists of a Deputy Commissioner, Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioners, and three tahsildars, besides the usual medical and constabulary officials. In 1871 the revenue was returned at \u00a353,560, of which the amount contributed by the land-tax was \u00a344,352. The other principal items are stamps and excise. In 1881-82 the total revenue was \u00a356,612, of which the land-tax contributed \u00a349,295. The District contained in 1881-82, 15 civil or revenue and 23 magisterial courts. In the same year, the imperial police numbered 391 men of all ranks, besides 86 municipal constables. There was thus a total police force of 477 men, being 1 policeman to every 1293 of the population and to every 5.4 square miles of area. The regular force was supplemented by 1092 village watchmen or chaukidars. There is 1 jail in the District, the total number of prisoners in which was 1081 (daily average, 413) in 1870, and 1726 (daily average, 429) in 1881. Education is still unfortunately backward, the agricultural population especially having made no advance in their appreciation of its advantages. The total number of pupils on the rolls of the various schools amounted in 1873 to 5818. In 1881, there were in all 92 schools inspected by the Education Department, attended by 4896 pupils. Of these, 19 were girls' schools, attended by 571 pupils. The District is sub-divided into 3 tahsils and 11 parganas, containing an aggregate of 1291 villages, owned by 33,757 proprietors or coparceners. Average land revenue from each village, \u00a341, os. 11d.; from each proprietor, \u00a31, 9s. 3d. The regularly constituted municipalities in the District are those of Gujranwala, Wazirabad, Ramnagar, Akalgarh, Jalalpur, Pindi Bhattian, Hafizabad, Kil Didar Singh, Eminabad, and Sohdra. Their aggregate population in 1881 amounted to 71,601 persons, and their aggregate revenue amounted to \u00a36676 in 1881-82, being at the rate of 1s. 10\u00bdd. per head of their inhabitants.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014No statistics as to the temperature of Gujranwala are available for any date later than the year 1867. Observations made at that time show that the mean monthly temperature ranged from 53\u00b0 F. in January to 95\u00b0 in June; while the minimum and maximum readings for the same year were 20\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 respectively. The average rainfall for the twenty years ending in 1881 was 25.68 inches for the whole District. The rainfall in 1881 was 25.80 inches, or 1 inch above the average. The prevalent diseases are intermittent fever and small-pox, the latter of which exists always in an endemic form. The total number of deaths recorded in 1881 amounted to 14,174, or 20.1 per thousand of the population; but these figures are probably below the truth. The towns are badly drained, and the urban death-rates\nare extremely high. The Government maintains 4 charitable dispensaries\u2014at Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Ak\u00e1lgarh, Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d, and H\u00e1f\u00edz\u00e1b\u00e1d, which afforded relief in 1881 to 376 in-door and 34,846 out-door patients.

Area, 770 square miles. Population (1868) 222,549; (1881) 250,749, namely, males 135,258, and females 115,462; average density, 326 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were: Muhammadans, 163,061; Hindus, 66,343; Sikhs, 20,644; and 'others,' 672. The revenue of the tahsil in 1882-83 was \u00a317,283. The administrative staff consisted of\u20141 Deputy Commissioner, 1 Judicial Assistant, 3 Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 1 munsif, and 2 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 8 civil and revenue and 8 criminal courts. The tahsil contains 3 police circles (th\u00e1nds), with 143 regular police and 502 village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1s).\n\nGujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 9' 30\" N., long. 74\u00b0 14' E. Lies on the Grand Trunk Road and Northern Punjab State Railway, 40 miles north of Lahore. Population (1868) 19,381; (1881) 22,884, namely, males 12,345, and females 10,539. Muhammadans numbered 11,820; Hindus, 9114; Sikhs, 1396; Jains, 412; and 'others,' 141. Number of houses, 3747. The town is of modern creation, and owes its importance entirely to the father and grandfather of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Singh, whose capital it formed during the early period of the Sikh power. Ranj\u00edt Singh himself was born at Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, and made it his head-quarters until the establishment of his supremacy at Lahore. Large dwelling-houses of Sikh architecture line the main streets; the minor lanes consist of tortuous alleys, often ending in culs-de-sac. The town lies in a plain of dead level, destitute of natural drainage; and its sanitary condition has called forth severe comments. Mausoleum to M\u00e1han Singh, father of Ranj\u00edt Singh; lofty cupola covering a portion of the ashes of the great Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 himself. The civil station lies a mile south-east of the native town, from which it is separated by the Grand Trunk Road and the railway line. It contains the court-house, treasury, jail, dispensary, post-office, staging bungalow, and church. Trade in local produce only; small manufactures of country wares, including brass vessels, jewellery, shawl edgings, and silk and cotton scarves. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a33554; in 1882-83, \u00a34749, or an average of 4s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population.\nGujr\u00e1t.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 10' and 33\u00b0 N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 20' and 74\u00b0 33' E. long. Gujr\u00e1t forms the easternmost District of the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division. It is bounded on the north-east by the Native State of Jammu or Kashmir, on the north-west by the river Jehlam (Jhelum), on the west by Sh\u00e1hpur District, and on the south-east by the rivers T\u00e1vi and Chen\u00e1b, separating it from the Districts of Si\u00e1lkot and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. Area, 1973 square miles; population (1881) 689,115 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Gujr\u00e1t, 4 miles from the present bed of the Chen\u00e1b.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Gujr\u00e1t comprises a narrow wedge of sub-Him\u00e1layan plain country, enclosed between the boundary valleys of the Jehlam and the Chen\u00e1b. The tract of land thus cut off possesses fewer natural advantages than any other portion of the submontane Punjab region. From the basin of the Chen\u00e1b on the south, the general level of the country rises rapidly toward the interior, which, owing to the great depth of water below the surface, begins to assume a dreary and desert aspect almost from the very base of the great mountain chain itself. A range of low hills, known as the Pabbi, traverses the northern angle of Gujr\u00e1t, commencing on the Jammu frontier, 5 miles below the town of Bhimbar, and passing southwestward in a direct line till it abuts upon the bank of the Jehlam; rising again beyond the valley of that river, the system trends northwards once more, and ultimately merges in the Salt range. These hills consist of a friable tertiary sandstone and conglomerate, totally destitute of vegetation, and presenting to the view a mere barren chaos of naked rock, deeply scored with precipitous ravines. The highest point attains an elevation of 1400 feet above sea-level, or about 600 feet above the surrounding plain. Immediately below the Pabbi stretches a high and undulating plateau, which runs eastward across the whole breadth of the Do\u00e1b, and terminates abruptly in a precipitous bluff some 200 feet in height, overlooking the channel of the T\u00e1vi, an affluent of the Chen\u00e1b, in the north-eastern corner of the District. At the foot of the plateau, again, succeeds a dry champaign country, bounded by a lowland strip some 8 miles in width, which forms the actual wider valley of the Chen\u00e1b itself, and participates in the irrigation from the river-bed.\n\nScarcely one-fifth of the plain has been brought under the plough; the remainder consists of brushwood jungle, valued only as pasture-ground for the herds of cattle which make up the principal wealth of its inhabitants. The dreary and sterile aspect of the country increases in a marked degree as we move westward. Even in the best portion of the plain, water can only be obtained in wells at a depth of 60 feet below the surface, which precludes the possibility of its general use for purposes of irrigation. At the foot of the high bank,\nhowever, which terminates this central plain, the Chen\u00e1b lowlands have a fertile soil of consistent loam, whose natural fruitfulness is enhanced by artificial water-supply from the mountain streams, which pass in deeply-cut channels through the dry uplands, but expand once more into broad reaches as they flow through the alluvial flats. Close to the actual channel, a fringe of land, some $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in width, is exposed to inundation from the flooded river, and produces rich crops upon the virgin silt. A similar belt of lowland fringes the Jehlam; but the deposits from this river contain a large admixture of sand, which renders the soil far less fertile than in the valley of the Chen\u00e1b. Besides the great boundary rivers, the Jehlam and Chen\u00e1b, the District is intersected by numerous hill torrents rising in the outer Him\u00e1layas or the Pabbi Hills, the chief being the Bhimbar, Bhandar, Dalli, Dabuli, Do\u00e1ra, and B\u00e1kal. Most of these streams, although unmanageable torrents during the rains, either dry up entirely, or find their way into the Chen\u00e1b by insignificant channels during the dry season. The District as a whole is well wooded, and great attention has been paid to arboriculture. The State preserves about 60,000 acres of waste land for the growth of timber, under the management of the Forest Department. The mineral products include saltpetre, limestone, and kankar, a calcareous concrete.\n\n**History.**\u2014Numerous relics of antiquity stud the surface of Gujr\u00e1t District. Mounds of ancient construction yield considerable numbers of coins, and abound in archaic bricks, whose size and type prove them to belong to the prehistoric period of Hindu architecture. General Cunningham has identified one of these shapeless masses, now occupied by the village of Moga or Mong, with the site of Nik\u00e6a, the city built by Alexander on the field of his victory over Porus. This mound, a conspicuous object for many miles around, lies about 6 miles west of the Pabbi range, and has a height of 50 feet, with a superficial dimension of 600 by 400 feet. Copper coins of all the so-called Indo-Scythian kings are found in abundance amongst the rubbish which composes the heap. Gujr\u00e1t itself evidently occupies an ancient site, though the existing town dates only from the time of Akbar. J\u00e1t and Guj\u00e1r tribes form the principal elements of the population, and their legends afford a concurrence of testimony in favour of the view that their ancestors entered the District from the east in comparatively modern times.\n\nThe Delhi Empire first made a settlement in this portion of the Punjab under Bahlol Lodi (A.D. 1450\u201388), by whom the town of Bahlolpur upon the Chen\u00e1b, 23 miles north-east of Gujr\u00e1t, was founded as the seat of government. A century later, Akbar visited the District, and restored Gujr\u00e1t as the local capital. That Emperor's administrative records are still extant, having been preserved in\nthe families of the hereditary registrars (kan\u00fangos). They exhibit Gujrat as the centre of an administrative division comprising 259 villages, and producing a revenue of \u00a3163,455. During the long decay of the Mughal power, the District was overrun by the Ghakkars of Rawal Pindi, who probably established themselves at Gujrat in 1741. The country also suffered at the same time from the ravages of Ahmad Shah Durani, whose armies frequently crossed and recrossed the District. Meanwhile the Sikh power had been asserting itself in the eastern Punjab; and in 1765, Sardar Gujjar Singh, head of the Bhangi Confederacy, crossed the Chenab, defeated the Ghakkar chief, Mukarrab Khan, and extended his dominions to the banks of the Jehlam. On his death in 1788, his son, Sahib Singh, succeeded to the domains of his father, but became involved in war with Mahan Singh, the chieftain of Gujranwala, and with his son, the celebrated Ranjit Singh. After a few months of desultory warfare in 1798, the Gujrat leader found it well to accept a position of dependence under the young ruler of Gujranwala. At length in 1810, Ranjit Singh, now master of the consolidated Sikh Empire, determined to depose his tributary vassal. Sahib Singh withdrew to the hills without opposition, and shortly afterwards accepted a small portion of the present Sialkot District as a private landowner.\n\nIn 1846, Gujrat came under the supervision of British officials, a settlement of the land-tax having been effected under orders from the Provisional Government at Lahore. Two years later, the District became the theatre for the series of battles which decided the event of the second Sikh war. While the siege of Multan (Mooltan) still dragged slowly on, Sher Singh established himself at Ramnagar on the Gujranwala side of the Chenab, 22 miles below Gujrat, leaving the main body of his army on the northern bank. Here he awaited the attack of Lord Gough, who attempted unsuccessfully to drive him across the river, 22nd November 1848. Our commander withdrew from the assault with heavy loss; but sending round a strong detachment under Sir Joseph Thackwell by the Wazirabad ferry, he turned the flank of the enemy, and won the battle of Sadullapur. Sher Singh retired northward, and took up a strong position between the Jehlam and the Pabbi Hills. The bloody battle of Chilianwala followed (13th January 1849), a victory as costly as a defeat. On 6th February, Sher Singh again eluded Lord Gough's vigilance, and marched southwards to make a dash upon Lahore; but our army pressed him close in the rear, and, on the 22nd of February, he turned to offer battle at Gujrat. The decisive engagement which ensued broke irretrievably the power of the Sikhs. The Punjab lay at the feet of the conquerors, and passed by annexation under British rule. At the first distribution of the Province, the whole wedge of land\nbetween the Chen\u00e1b and the Jehlam, from their junction to the hills, formed a single jurisdiction; but a few months later, the south-western portion was erected into a separate charge, with its head-quarters at Shahpur. Various interchanges of territory took place from time to time at later dates; and in 1857, the north-eastern corner of the original District, comprising the tongue of land between the T\u00e1vi and the Chen\u00e1b, was transferred to Si\u00e1lkot. Gujr\u00e1t District then assumed its present form.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census of Gujr\u00e1t took place in 1855, and it returned the number of inhabitants in the area now composing the District at 500,167 souls. In 1868 the population was returned at 616,509. The last Census in 1881 disclosed a total population of 689,115, showing an increase of 188,948 persons, or 37.7 per cent., in the twenty-six years since 1855. The Census of 1881 was taken over an area of 1973 square miles, and it resulted in the following statistics:\u2014Number of villages, 1334; number of houses, 83,193; persons per square mile, 349; villages per square mile, .68; houses per square mile, 50; persons per village, 516; persons per house, 8.28. The western portion of the District is very sparsely populated. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 362,162; females, 326,953; proportion of males, 53.85 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, Gujr\u00e1t is an essentially Musalm\u00e1n District, where the ancient religion has been almost crushed out, and the Sikh reaction has produced but little effect. In 1881, the Muhammadans numbered no less than 607,525, or 88.16 per cent.; while the Hindus numbered only 72,450, or 10.49 per cent., and the Sikhs 8885, or 1.28 per cent. The District also contained 255 Christians. Among Hindus and Sikhs, the ethnical divisions comprised 8663 Br\u00e1hmans, 17,793 Khattris, 23,956 Aror\u00e1s, and 3080 J\u00e1ts. The Muhammadans included 16,428 Sayyids, 21,233 R\u00e1jputs, 177,297 J\u00e1ts, 23,846 Jul\u00e1has, 93,417 G\u00fajars, and 21,546 Tarkhans. The mass of the Musalm\u00e1n population consists of converts to Isl\u00e1m, drawn either from the old R\u00e1jput aristocracy, who were forcibly brought under the faith of the Prophet, or from the lower castes, who readily exchanged the exclusive creed of their fathers for the comparative freedom of the Muhammadan belief. Among the Hindus and Sikhs, the large proportion of 70 per cent. belong to tribes engaged almost exclusively in commerce. The most important R\u00e1jput tribe is that of the Chibs, who occupy the country immediately below the Him\u00e1layas, both in this District and in Jammu, and hold a high social rank. They are nearly all Muhammadans, but there is also a Hindu section. The conversion of the Muhammadan section dates from the reign of Aurangzeb, the example being set by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Surs\u00e1di, then head of the tribe, whose tomb at Bhimbar\nis still an object of veneration. The tribe is divided into seven clans or septs. Its members hold themselves superior to other Rajputs, and although taking wives from other tribes, do not as a rule give their daughters in marriage out of the tribe, except to Sayyids. Like Rajputs generally, until their independence was overthrown by the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh, the Chibs disdained to carry on agricultural pursuits, but in this respect they are now in the same position as the Jats and other purely agricultural classes. The Jat tribe consists of four principal clans, the Baraich, Tarar, Gondal, and Ranjha, each of which occupies a special locality in the District. They are industrious and careful cultivators, professing Muhammadanism with but few exceptions, but the retention of Brahman purohits or priests in almost every one of their villages is an unmistakeable relic of their old religion. They lay claim to high social rank, and a marriage with a low-caste woman is regarded as a disgrace. The Gujars, also almost entirely Muhammadans, are divided into several clans, the chief being the Kuthana, Chechi, and Chauhan, who all claim Rajput descent. They occupy themselves more as herdsmen and graziers than as agriculturists. The Sayyids of Gujrat have been settled in the District from a very ancient date, and are divided into eight sections, named after the localities they first occupied in India on leaving their original home in Arabia. Amongst the Hindus, next to the Brahmans and Khattris, are a clan of Sikhs called the Bahrupiyas, claiming Rajput origin, and with the high-sounding family names of Rahtor, Chauhan, and Puar. Their claim to Rajput descent, however, is discredited, and they are not accorded a position of equality with other Sikhs of respectable Hindu origin. The Labanas, another Sikh tribe, correspond to the Banjaras of Central India, and carry on an extensive trade by means of large herds of pack-bullocks. Of late years they have taken to agriculture, but as an additional means of livelihood, and not as a substitute for trade.\n\nIn 1881 the District contained 4 towns that have been constituted municipalities\u2014namely, Gujrat, 18,743; Jalalpur, 12,839; Kunjah, 5799; and Dinga, 5015. Total urban population, 42,396. Of the 1334 towns and villages comprising the District in 1881, 356 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 523 from two to five hundred; 310 from five hundred to a thousand; 116 from one to two thousand; 22 from two to three thousand; 3 from three to five thousand; and 4 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Classified according to occupation, the Census Report returns the adult male population under the following seven main groups:\u2014(1) Professional, 7931; (2) domestic, 8097; (3) commercial, 4596; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 113,995; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 49,637; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 10,932; (7) unspecified, 15,083.\nAgriculture.\u2014Wheat forms the staple product of the rabi or spring harvest; while the common millets, jodr and bajra, make up the chief items in the kharif or autumn harvest. Barley, gram, rice, pulses, oil-seeds, and cotton also cover considerable areas; while sugar-cane is grown in small quantities on the better irrigated soil. With the exception of rice, which is of inferior quality, all these staples reach an average level of goodness. The following statement shows the estimated area under the principal crops in 1880-81:\u2014Wheat, 328,489 acres; rice, 7493; jodr, 62,352; bajra, 137,284; barley, 54,922; Indian corn, 16,789; pulses, 47,875; oil-seeds, 35,808; cotton, 16,237; vegetables, 16,128; sugar-cane, 6349 acres.\n\nNo canals exist in the District, either public or private; and artificial irrigation is entirely confined to wells. Of these, 6772 were returned as in operation during the year 1866-67. Each well may be considered to supply water on an average to an area of about 18 acres. In the central plateau, cultivation depends entirely upon the comparatively regular rainfall. In 1880-81, 801,339 acres were returned as under cultivation, of which 238,210 acres were provided with artificial irrigation. The area under tillage has largely increased of late years.\n\nProperty in the soil rests for the most part in the hands of the village communities, which differ from one another only in the degree to which division of holdings has been carried. A very small number of villages still retain the principle of common proprietorship; in the remainder, division has been either partially or wholly effected. In any case, the State holds the entire village responsible for the amount of the land-tax assessed upon it.\n\nOf a total area of 1973 square miles, 1835 square miles are assessed at a Government revenue, including cesses and rates levied upon land, of \u00a366,854. Rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3133,594. The current land revenue settlement, made for a period of twenty years, will expire in 1888. Less than one-fourth of the tenants possess rights of occupancy. The average holding of a joint proprietor amounts to 18 acres; of an occupancy tenant, 8 acres; of a tenant-at-will, 5 acres. The latter class invariably pay their rents in kind. Agricultural labourers also receive their wages in kind.\n\nIn 1880-81, cash wages ranged from 7\u00bdd. to 10\u00bdd. per diem for skilled, and from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. for unskilled workmen. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on 1st January 1881:\u2014Wheat, 7s. per cwt.; flour, 8s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 5s. 7d. per cwt.; gram, 6s. 9d. per cwt.; jodr, 5s. 7d. per cwt.; bajra, 6s. 3d. per cwt.; rice (best), 18s. 8d. per cwt.; cotton (cleaned), \u00a32, 5s. 10d. per cwt.; and sugar (refined), \u00a32, 9s. 10d. per cwt. Owing to the regularity of the rainfall, drought is comparatively infrequent. The famine of 1869-70 produced little\neffect on this District, beyond raising the price of grain to nearly double the above quotations.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The merchants of Gujr\u00e1t, Jal\u00e1lpur, Kunj\u00e1h, and Ding\u00e1 hold in their hands the greater part of the local trade. The exports consist chiefly of grain, gh\u00ed, wool, and other agricultural produce, most of which goes down the river to Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) or Sakkar; but the opening of the Northern Punjab State Railway, which intersects the District from south-east to north-west, now affords a new outlet for traffic. The imports come chiefly from Lahore, Amritsar, Jammu, and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n. Boats sent down the stream seldom return, being bought up upon their arrival at their destination, and employed in the lower navigation of the three rivers. Fabrics made from pashm, or the under wool of the Tibetan goat, are woven at Gujr\u00e1t and Jal\u00e1lpur, but the manufacture is declining. The extraction of an impure saltpetre from saline earth, formerly a flourishing industry, has also much declined. The mineral is produced for the most part to the order of the Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n merchants, by whom it is exported to Mult\u00e1n and other large marts after refinement. Limekilns, worked by Government, yield lime for official buildings, but the supply is all used locally. The Northern Punjab State Railway passes through the District from south-east to north-west, with stations at Gujr\u00e1t, L\u00e1la Musa, Kh\u00e1ri\u00e1n, and Kari\u00e1la. The bridge across the Chen\u00e1b was formally opened by the Prince of Wales in January 1876; while another leads across the Jehlam into the District of that name. Bridges of boats conduct the Grand Trunk Road over both rivers. Good branch lines of road connect Gujr\u00e1t with all surrounding centres; that to Bhimbar being much frequented as a route to Kashmir. In 1880-81 the District contained 55 miles of metalled and 650 miles of unmetalled roads. Water communication is afforded by 72 miles of navigable rivers.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue derived from the District in 1861-62 amounted to \u00a355,171. By 1882-83 it had increased to \u00a375,269. This gain is chiefly due to improvement in the land-tax, while the remaining increase must be set down to excise and stamps. The land settlement now in force was made in 1865, and will have effect till the year 1886-87. Besides the imperial revenue, the District contributes a sum of about \u00a310,000 by local cesses for expenditure on works of public utility within its limits. In 1882-83, 17 civil and revenue judges of all kinds held jurisdiction in the District. The regular or imperial police in 1882 consisted of 310 officers and men, of whom 226 were available for protective or detective duties, the remainder being employed as guards over jails, treasuries, escorts, etc. There was also in the same year a municipal force of 61 men, and a rural police or village watch of over 600 men. The District\njail at Gujr\u00e1t received in 1882-83 a total number of 1095 prisoners, the daily average being 196. During the same year, the number of State-supported schools amounted to 49, having a total roll on the 31st March 1883 of 4,304 scholars. These figures show an average of 40\u00b72 square miles for each school, and 6 scholars per thousand of the population. The Census Report in 1881 returned 5,831 boys and 163 girls as under instruction, besides 11,738 males and 126 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District school at Gujr\u00e1t, which ranks among the 'higher class' schools of the Punjab, contained 44 pupils in March 1883. In 1882-83, the District contained 4 municipalities\u2014namely, Gujr\u00e1t, Jal\u00e1lpur, Kunjah, and Dinga. They had a total revenue of \u00a32360, and an expenditure of \u00a32487; average incidence, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of their united population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Gujr\u00e1t generally bears an excellent reputation as a healthy District, but excessive irrigation in the neighbourhood of the head-quarters town is said to breed fever and ague. Small-pox prevails largely along the eastern border, imported probably from Jammu from time to time. The official returns of 1882 state the total number of deaths recorded in the District during that year as 14,769, being at the rate of 21 per thousand of the population. In the towns of Gujr\u00e1t and Jal\u00e1lpur, 376 and 471 deaths respectively were registered, being at the rate of 20 and 37 per thousand. The District contains 12 charitable dispensaries, which gave relief in 1882 to 62,989 persons, of whom 341 were in-door patients. No thermometric returns are available, but the heat at Gujr\u00e1t is considered moderate, even in the months of May and June, owing to the proximity of the hills. The average rainfall varies from 33 inches immediately below the Him\u00e1layas to 26 inches or less in the western uplands. As a rule, the fall is regular, nor does the District suffer from drought so much as many of its neighbours. The average for the whole District during the twenty years ending 1881 was 30\u00b788 inches. In 1880 the total rainfall was only 11\u00b79 inches, in 1881 it was 25\u00b790 inches.\n\n[For further information regarding Gujr\u00e1t District, see the Gujr\u00e1t District Gazetteer (Lahore, 1884); the Report on the Second Regular Settlement of Gujr\u00e1t District, by Captain W.

Area, 554 square miles; population (1868) 272,055; (1881) 297,040, namely, males 156,339, and females 140,701; average density, 536 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were: Muhammadans, 256,936; Hindus, 35,096; Sikhs, 4818;\nand 'others,' 190. Total assessed area (1878-79), 357,936, of which 284,221 acres were returned as cultivated, 21,086 acres as cultivable, and 52,629 acres as uncultivable. Amount of Government assessment, \u00a327,126. Average area under the different crops for the five years ending 1881-82: Wheat, 121,769 acres; bajra, 32,103 acres; barley, 33,778 acres; Indian corn, 13,035 acres; jo\u00e1r, 19,009 acres; gram, 8875 acres; moth, 4862 acres; rice, 2668 acres; poppy, 40 acres; tobacco, 955 acres; cotton, 7697 acres; indigo, 71 acres; sugar-cane, 3411 acres; and vegetables, 7363 acres.

These officers preside over 6 civil and revenue and 5 magisterial courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1nds), 4; strength of regular police, 91 men, with 285 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nGujr\u00e1t.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Gujr\u00e1t District, Punjab, lying about 5 miles north of the present bed of the Chen\u00e1b. Lat. 32\u00b0 35' N., long. 74\u00b0 7' E. Population (1868) 14,905; (1881) 18,743, namely, 13,637 Muhammadans, 4762 Hindus, 317 Sikhs, and 27 'others;' number of houses, 3114. Stands upon an ancient site, formerly occupied by two successive cities; the second of which General Cunningham supposes to have been destroyed in A.D. 1303, the year of an early Mughal invasion of Delhi. Nearly 200 years later, Sher Sh\u00e1h turned his attention to the surrounding country, and either he or Akbar founded the existing town. Though standing in the midst of a J\u00e1t neighbourhood, the fort was first garrisoned by G\u00fajars, and took the name of Gujr\u00e1t Akbar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Remains of the imperial period still exist. During the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, Gujr\u00e1t became the residence of a famous saint, P\u00edr Sh\u00e1h Daul\u00e1, who adorned the city with numerous buildings from the offerings of his visitors. The Ghakkar chief, Muk\u00e1rab Kh\u00e1n of R\u00e1wal Pindi, held Gujr\u00e1t for twenty-five years, till his expulsion in 1765 by the Sikhs under Sard\u00e1r G\u00fajar Singh Bhangi. For subsequent history, see Gujr\u00e1t District. The town was rendered memorable during the second Sikh war by the battle which decided the fate of the campaign, bringing the whole Punjab under British rule.\n\nAkbar's fort, largely improved by G\u00fajar Singh, stands in the centre of the town. The civil station lies to the north of the native quarter, containing the court-house, treasury, jail, dispensary, police lines, staging bungalow, and post-office. The tahsil and munsif's courts are situated within the fort. The town is traversed by three main streets running respectively from east to west, from north-west to east, and from north to south. With these exceptions the streets are very narrow and irregular. They are, however, well paved, and the sanitary arrangements are very good, being greatly facilitated by the elevated position\nof the town and the ample water-supply. The majority of the houses are of fairly solid build. The principal buildings of antiquarian or architectural interest are the Imperial bath-house or hammam, a large Imperial well with steps leading down to the water, and the shrine of Pir Sh\u00e1h Daul\u00e1. The railway station lies about a mile south-west, and the military camping-ground nearly a mile north-west of the city. Gujr\u00e1t contains 69 Muhammadan mosques, 52 Hindu temples, and 11 Sikh dharm\u00e1s\u00e1ds. The principal educational institutions are the Government District School and the Mission School.\n\nGujr\u00e1t is the great commercial centre of the District, collecting agricultural produce from the surrounding villages for export. It is also an entrep\u00f4t for piece-goods, raw iron, and other European goods. Some of the grain dealers have very large dealings, and there are several native banking-houses of high standing. A large traffic in dried fruits from Kashmir also passes through Gujr\u00e1t. The chief local manufactures are cotton, cloth, shawl and pashmina weaving; the two latter industries, however, are on the decline. The brass vessels of Gujr\u00e1t are well known, and the boot-makers supply boots and shoes to native regiments in different parts of the Punjab. Inlaid work in gold and iron, known as Gujr\u00e1t ware, has acquired a considerable reputation, and meets with a ready sale among Europeans as a sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 of Punjab art.\n\nMunicipal revenue in 1880-81, \u00a31306; in 1882-83, \u00a31208; average incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. The municipal income is almost entirely derived from octroi.\n\n**Gulariha.**\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; 36 miles from Unao town, and 16 from Purwa. Lat. 26\u00b0 24' N., long. 81\u00b0 1' E.

Lat. 31\u00b0 57' N., long. 76\u00b0 24' E. The village contains a mine of salt, which is, however, a good deal mixed with earth. The mineral is quarried here and at Drang (also in the Mandi State). The out-turn in 1881-82 amounted to 115,828 maunds, or 4137 tons. A duty of 1s. 3d. a maund is levied, in addition to the price of the salt, which is also 1s. 3d. a maund. This duty is shared between the British Government and the Mandi State, in the proportion of two-thirds and one-third respectively.\n\n**Gum\u00e1l.**\u2014Pass across the Sulaim\u00e1n range from the Punjab into Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. It follows the course of the Gum\u00e1l river, and is a route of great importance, being the great highway of the Povindah trading tribes from K\u00e1b\u00fal and Kandah\u00e1r. The town of Gum\u00e1l in Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District is situated at the point of debouchure of the pass.\n\n**Gum\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014River of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; rises in the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l Hills in Godda Sub-division, and at first runs north-east into the Barh\u00e1it valley. It is there joined by the Moral, coming from the northern hills; and the united stream, which has thus collected the entire drainage of the range, flows south-east through the Gh\u00e1ti\u00e1ri Pass to join the Ganges near Mah\u00e1deo-nagar.\n\n**Gum\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014Name given to the ATRAI RIVER of Northern Bengal, where it passes through the southern extremity of the Chalan b\u012bl in R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed District, whence it enters Pabn\u00e1.\n\n**Gum\u00e1r.**\u2014Village in Mandi State, Punjab, on the southern slope of the Him\u00e1layas.\u2014See GUMA.\n\n**Gumg\u00e1on.**\u2014Town in N\u00e1gpur tahsil, N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces; situated on the Wan\u00e1 river, 12 miles south of N\u00e1gpur town. Lat. 21\u00b0 1' N., long. 79\u00b0 2' 30\" E. Population (1881) 2712, namely, Hindus, 2507; Muhammadans, 197; Jains, 6; and aborigines (by religion), 2. The people are chiefly agriculturists, though the Kosht\u00eds also manufacture cotton cloth. Near the police quarters, and commanding the river, are the remains of a considerable Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fort, and near it a fine temple of Ganpati, with strongly-built walls of basalt facing the river. Both fort and temple were built by Ch\u00edm\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, wife of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghuji II., since whose time this estate has continued in the direct possession of the Bhonsla family.\n\n**Gumnayakan-palya.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore State, with head-quarters at BAGEPALLI. Area, 342 square miles; population (1872) 48,600; (1881) 38,575, namely, 19,440 males and 19,135 females. Hindus number 37,260; and Muhammadans, 1315. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 9;\nregular police, 76 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 299. Land revenue, \u00a39751.

Situated on a small rocky hill, crowned with fortifications, erected by a local chief, Gummi Nayak, about 1364. The family gradually extended their territory, and maintained their independence until overthrown by Haidar Ali.\n\nG\u00fams\u00far (Ghumsar or Goomsar).\u2014T\u00e1luk in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Bounded on the north by the Daspalla and Nyagar zamind\u00e1ris of Cuttack; on the east by Atagada zamind\u00e1ri; and on the west by the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts. Area, 291 square miles, with 1 town and 801 villages. Houses, 32,401. Population (1871) 158,061; (1881) 181,390, namely, males 89,407, and females 91,983. The G\u00fams\u00far country till 1836 was native territory; but in that year the chief rose in rebellion against the British power, a military expedition was despatched against him, and his territory was annexed. One result of this annexation was the suppression of the practice of Meriah, or human sacrifice, which, as was then discovered, prevailed to a considerable extent among the Kandhs, a wild tribe inhabiting the hilly country eastward of G\u00fams\u00far. As a revenue division, G\u00fams\u00far includes the lapsed zamind\u00e1ri (estate) of Surada, with an area of about 1250 square miles. It enjoys a copious rainfall and fertile soil, and is watered by several large streams, which unite at Aska. The t\u00e1luk is wild and thickly covered with forests of sal wood. Wild beasts (tiger, bear, sambhar) and game abound. A good deal of sugar-cane is grown in the centre and south, but irrigation is needed to develop the cultivation. The Surada and Gumsur paiks, who hold quit-rent lands in the t\u00e1luk on condition of military service when called out against the Kandhs, are an interesting remnant of the old feudal system of Ganjam. The paiks, who hold about 10,000 acres of land, are occasionally used as guards at the salt factories in the manufacturing season. The G\u00fams\u00far t\u00e1luk in 1883 contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1nds), 11; regular police, 97 men. Land revenue, \u00a323,846.\n\n\u2014See Orissa Tributary States, Bundare, Kandhs, etc.\n\nG\u00fams\u00far.\u2014Town in G\u00fams\u00far t\u00e1luk, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 50' N., long. 84\u00b0 42' E. Formerly the chief town of the t\u00e1luk to which it gives its name; 6 miles south-east from Russellkonda, the present head-quarters. Previous to the disturbances of 1836\u201337 it was the seat of the G\u00fams\u00far chiefs, and members of the family still reside here. The town is now of no importance.\n\nGumti (Gomati, identified with the Kuh\u00ed of the ancient geographers).\u2014River of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. It rises in Pilibhit District of the North-Western Provinces, in an alluvial tract between\nthe Deoha or Garra and the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra) rivers. Its source is in a small lake or morass called the Phaljar T\u00e1l, in lat. $28^\\circ 37'$ N., long. $80^\\circ 7'$ E.; 19 miles east of Pilibhit town, and about 605 feet above sea-level. The river takes a sinuous but generally south-eastern course for 42 miles, when it enters Oudh in Kheri District, in lat. $28^\\circ 11'$ N., long. $80^\\circ 20'$ E. It continues its course to the south-east, till at about 94 miles from its source it receives the Kathna as a tributary on its left bank, in lat. $27^\\circ 28'$ N., long. $80^\\circ 27'$ E. Continuing south-eastwards for 80 miles farther, and receiving during its course the Sarayan in lat. $27^\\circ 9'$ N., long. $80^\\circ 55'$ E., Lucknow city is reached, where the river is spanned by five bridges. The river here becomes navigable throughout the year; its banks are from 30 to 70 feet high, and it has a minimum cold-weather discharge of 500 cubic feet per second. Below Lucknow, the valley of the G\u00famti becomes very narrow, and the scenery picturesque. At Sult\u00e1npur, about 170 miles south-east of the Oudh capital, the stream in the dry season is 100 yards wide, with a depth of 4 feet, and a current running at the rate of 2 miles an hour. About 52 miles south-east of Sult\u00e1npur, the river re-enters the North-Western Provinces in Jaunpur District. At Jaunpur town, 30 miles from the Oudh frontier, the G\u00famti has become a fine stream, spanned by a bridge of 16 arches; 18 miles below Jaunpur, it receives the S\u00e1i river on its left bank; and 33 miles lower, in Benares District, the Nind river also on the left bank. Five miles below this last point, the G\u00famti falls into the Ganges, in lat. $25^\\circ 31'$ N., long. $83^\\circ 13'$ E., after a total course of about 500 miles. Just above the confluence, the G\u00famti is crossed by a bridge of boats in the cold and hot weather, which is replaced by a ferry in the rainy season. The G\u00famti is navigable by boats of 500 maunds, or about 17 tons burthen, throughout the year as far as Dil\u00e1warpur Gh\u00e1t, near Muhamdi in Kheri District. The traffic registered in 1879-80, at a station in Benares District, close to its confluence with the Ganges, amounted to\u2014down-stream, 141,580 maunds (grain constituting 78 per cent. of the total); up-stream, 42,209 maunds (stone constituting 90 per cent.). Higher up the river there is a very considerable local traffic between Sult\u00e1npur District in Oudh, and Jaunpur District in the North-Western Provinces. The worst shoals are in Sult\u00e1npur District. Average fall, 8 inches per mile.\n\n**G\u00famti.**\u2014River in Tipperah District, Bengal; formed by the junction of two rivers\u2014the Ch\u00e1im\u00e1 and R\u00e1im\u00e1, which rise respectively in the Ath\u00e1ramur\u00e1 and Lankthar\u00e1i ranges of the Tipperah Hills. These streams unite to form the G\u00famti near the eastern boundary of the Tipperah State, just above the succession of rapids known as the Dumr\u00e1 Falls. The G\u00famti enters Tipperah District near the village of B\u00e1b\u00e1sb\u00e1z\u00e1r, about 6 miles east of Comillah (Kumill\u00e1), and divides the\nDistrict into two nearly equal portions. After a westerly course, it joins the Meghn\u00e1 above D\u00e1\u00fadk\u00e1ndi, in lat. $23^\\circ 31' 45''$ N., long. $90^\\circ 44' 15''$ E. Its entire length, inclusive of windings, is 66 miles; but from the point where it enters British territory to where it empties itself into the Meghn\u00e1, its direct length is 36 miles. During the rains, the G\u00famti is deep and rapid; in the cold and dry seasons, it becomes fordable at many places. The chief tributaries in Tipperah Hill State are the K\u00e1siganj, the Pithr\u00e1ganj, and the Mail\u00e1kcherral, all on the right or north bank. The principal towns on the G\u00famti are Comillah, J\u00e1farganj, and P\u00e1nchpukuri\u00e1. Public ferries at Comillah, Companyganj, Mur\u00e1dnagar, and Gauripur\u00e1, the latter village being one of the largest rice and jute marts of the District.\n\n**G\u00fana Agency (Goona Agency).**\u2014Tract of country in Gwalior territory, Central India, comprising the States of Raghugarh, Paron, Garha, Dharnaoda, Umri, Bhadaura, and Sirsi.

After a south-easterly course of about 100 miles, it falls into the sea near Kilkar\u00e1i, lat. $9^\\circ 8'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 33' 30''$ E.\n\n**Gund\u00e1rdihi.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri or estate attached to R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces. Area, 77 square miles. Population (1881) 19,927, namely, males 9715, and females 10,212; average density of population, 258\u00b78 per square mile. The estate contains no jungle, and is generally well cultivated, the population and crops being similar to those of the Government portion of the District, by which it is surrounded. The estate has belonged for 300 years to the family of the present zamind\u00e1r. Gund\u00e1rdihi village is situated in lat. $20^\\circ 56' 30''$ N., long. $81^\\circ 20' 30''$ E.\nGundial.\u2014Petty State of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r District in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 2 villages, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Population (1871) 1212; and (1881) 916. Estimated revenue, \u00a31200; tribute of \u00a3140, 16s. is payable to the British Government. Nine miles south of Wadhwan station on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway.\n\nGundlakamma (literally, 'Stony Bed').\u2014River of Madras Presidency, which rises in the Nalla Mall\u00e1i Hills in Karn\u00fal District, near Gundla Brahmesvaram, in lat. 15\u00b0 40' N., long. 75\u00b0 49' E. After receiving two mountain streams, the Jamp\u00e1leru and the Yenamaleru, it passes into the low country through the Cumbum (Kambham) gorge, at which spot a fine lake has been formed by a dam thrown across the course of the river. This sheet of water, known as the Cumbum Tank, is about 13 miles in circumference. It then follows a tortuous course through Karn\u00fal, Kistna, and Nellore Districts, and finally falls into the Bay of Bengal, 12 or 14 miles north of Ongole, in lat. 15\u00b0 33' N., long. 80\u00b0 18' E. The principal or new mouth of the river is always open, varying in width, according to the season, from 600 to 250 yards, and in depth from 6 to 12\u00bd feet. The second mouth, called by the people Pata Gundlakamma, is open only in the rains, and has a maximum depth of 6 feet on the bar.\n\nGundlamau.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Machhrehta and Kurauna pargan\u00e1s; on the east by the Sar\u00e1yan river, separating it from Sidhauli tahsil; and on the south and west by the G\u00famti river, separating it from Hardoi District. The early inhabitants of the pargan\u00e1 were Kachheras, who were driven out by the three sons of a B\u00e1chhil Kshattriya, one of whom, named Gonde Singh, founded and gave his name to the place. The descendants of these B\u00e1chhils still own 53 out of the 67 villages which constitute the pargan\u00e1. The Kuchl\u00e1 estate in the north-east is owned by a community of the same tribe. The pargan\u00e1 is, on the whole, a poor one, with a scanty population. The villages to the east, bordering on the Sar\u00e1yan, are much cut up by ravines; and those to the west are subject to a deposit of sand blown from the G\u00famti in the hot season; a few of them, however, especially in the south, have a fertile tract of tardi land fringing the river. Area, 64 square miles, of which 44 are cultivated; incidence of Government land revenue, 2s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 2s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 9\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Rents are paid almost entirely in kind. Population (1869) 20,220; (1881) 21,710, namely, 11,510 males and 10,200 females. No made roads, but the G\u00famti and Sar\u00e1yan afford good water communication. Three small market villages, at which only the commonest articles of trade are sold. No manufactures.\n\nGundlupet.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Mysore District, Mysore State. Area, 539\nsquare miles. Population (1881) 54,528, namely, 27,074 males and 27,454 females. Hindus numbered 53,596; Muhammadans, 880; and Christians, 52. The taluk contains 1 criminal court; police circles (thand\u00e1s), 9; regular police, 74 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 273. Land revenue, \u00a36798. The taluk has decreased in population and prosperity during the present century.\n\nGundlupet.\u2014Principal village in Gundlupet taluk, Mysore District, Mysore State; situated on the Gundal river, 36 miles south of Mysore town. Lat. 11\u00b0 50' N., long. 76\u00b0 44' E. Population (1881) 2951, including 360 Muhammadans, 38 Christians, and about 198 M\u00e4rka or old Kanarese Br\u00e1hmans. Old town, formerly called Vij\u00e1yapura, refounded about 1674 by Chikka Deva R\u00e1j\u00e1, Wodeyar of Mysore, as being the scene of his father's cremation. He built an agrah\u00e1ra, now destroyed, and a fine temple to Aparamita Parav\u00e1sa Deva, fast falling to ruin. The prosperity of the town suffered on the accession of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, and it has since been depopulated by fever.\n\nGundwa.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north and east by the G\u00famti, separating it from Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Gundlamau, and Manw\u00e1n pargan\u00e1s, in S\u00edt\u00e1pur; on the south by Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d, in Lucknow; and on the west by Sandila and Kaly\u00e1nmal. The portion of the pargan\u00e1 lying towards the G\u00famti consists of branching ravines, occasional sandhills, and poor uneven stretches of sandy bh\u00far land. Towards the south-east corner, an old channel of the river seems to have silted up, and become converted into a network of jhilis. At a distance from the river, the soil changes from bh\u00far to dum\u00e1t, but the sand still remains as a substratum. A number of small creeks and water-courses fall into the G\u00famti, carrying with them the overflowings of the jhilis in the interior. Area, 140 square miles, of which 88 are cultivated. Government land revenue, \u00a310,514; average incidence, 3s. 9\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 2s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Staple products\u2014barley and wheat, which occupy \u00beths of the cultivated area; other crops\u2014mdsh, gram, b\u00e1jra, ahar, moth, jo\u00e1r, linseed, rice, kodo, and peas. Of the 117 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 48 form the taluk or estate of Bhar\u00e1w\u00e1n; 36 are pattid\u00e1rt, 30 zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, and 6 bhayd\u00e9ch\u00e1ra. Kshattriyas own 94 villages; Br\u00e1hmans and K\u00e1yasths, 7 each; Kurmis, 3; and Muhammadans, 6. Population (1869) 56,871; (1881) 58,674, namely, 31,138 males and 27,536 females. An unmetalled road intersects the pargan\u00e1, and rough cart tracks link the main villages together. Three Government village schools.\n\nGuni.\u2014Taluk in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated between 24\u00b0 30' and 25\u00b0 13' N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 19' and 68\u00b0 50' E. long. Population (1872) 59,971; and (1881) 71,162, namely, 6278 Hindus, 60,501 Muhammadans, 1175 Sikhs, and\n3208 aborigines; number of houses, 15,781; area, 989 square miles, with 127 villages. The area assessed to land revenue in 1882-83 was 76,946 acres; area under actual cultivation, 38,727 acres. Land revenue, \u00a39444. The taluk in 1883 contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police stations (thandas), 8; regular police, 45 men.\n\nGunnaur.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division, forming the north-western portion of Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, and comprising the parganas of R\u00e1jpur\u00e1 and Asadpur. Area 310\u00bd square miles, of which 177 square miles are cultivated. Population (1872) 128,788; (1881) 117,535, namely, males 63,665, and females 53,870, thus showing a decrease of 11,253 persons in nine years. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 105,150; and Muhammadans, 12,385. Land revenue (1872), \u00a316,437; total revenue (including cesses), \u00a318,085.\n\nGunnaur.\u2014Town in Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Gunnaur tahsil. Population (1881) 4920, namely, males 2569, and females 2351. A small municipal income for police and conservancy purposes is levied in the shape of a house-tax. The town is situated about three miles from the left or north bank of the Ganges, on the unmetalled road between Bulandshahr and Bud\u00e1un, and was at one time an emporium of some importance, but the opening of the Al\u00edgarh-Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway has diverted the traffic which formerly passed through it. Tahsil; police station, sardi, dispensary, post-office, school, cattle-pound, and travellers' bungalow.\n\nGunt\u00far (Guntoor).\u2014Taluk in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Bounded on the north by the river Kistna, and on the south by the Kondavidu range of hills. Area, 500 square miles, containing 2 towns and 112 villages. Houses, 22,853. Population (1881) 136,083, namely, 68,476 males and 67,607 females. Hindus numbered 123,264; Muhammadans, 10,704; Christians, 2108; and 'others,' 7. In the south, the taluk, when the rainfall is abundant, is a fertile garden, but extremely desolate in dry weather. The region is generally entered by way of Bezw\u00e1da, where the passage of the Kistna is made by means of a ferry. In 1883 the taluk contained 1 civil and 4 criminal courts; police stations (thandas), 6; regular police, 126 men. Land revenue (1884), \u00a341,043. Chief town, Gunt\u00far.\n\nGunt\u00far (Guntoor).\u2014Chief town of Gunt\u00far taluk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency; situated on the Grand Trunk Road, about 46 miles from Masulipatam. Lat. 16\u00b0 17' 42\" N., long. 80\u00b0 29' E. It contains 3877 houses and (1881) 19,646 inhabitants, namely, 14,706 Hindus, 4618 Muhammadans, 314 Christians, and 8 'others.' The head-quarters of the Sub-Collector of Kistna; municipal revenue, \u00a31999; incidence of taxation, 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head. Gunt\u00far is divided\ninto the old and new town, and has been much improved of late, and is considered healthy. The houses of the collector and other officials, as well as the courts of justice, lie to the north and west. Considerable trade in grain and cotton. Four cotton screw presses. A branch of the Bank of Madras has been established in the town since 1869.\n\nGunt\u00far (Guntoor) was the capital of a Circar (Sark\u00e1r) under the Muhammadans. The town became prominent during the French occupation of Southern India in the second half of the 18th century. It was ceded to the French by the Niz\u00e1m in 1752. At the time of the cession of the Northern Circars to the English in 1776, Gunt\u00far was specially exempted during the life of Bas\u00e1lat Jang, whose personal j\u00e1gir it was. In 1778, the English rented it from him, but it was given up by order of the Governor-General in 1780. In 1788 it came again into British possession, and the cession was finally confirmed in 1823. The cemetery at Gunt\u00far contains many reminiscences of the stirring times of the French occupation. On one tombstone runs the following epitaph over the body of a French commandant:\u2014'D'Hercule il \u00e9gala les travaux et la gloire: Mais une mort trop cruelle a tromp\u00e9 notre espoir.' The great drawback to Gunt\u00far, which has a high reputation for healthiness, is its difficulty of access. In the hot weather, when the canals are closed, there is no escape except by a fatiguing journey over a parched country to Masulipatam, there to await a steamer which anchors seven miles from shore.\n\nGuptasar.\u2014Sacred cave in Sh\u00e1habad District, Bengal; about 7 miles from Shergarh and 18 miles from Sasser\u00e1m. It is situated in a glen; and the entrance, about 18 feet wide by 12 high, lies a little way up the hill. The surface of the interior is everywhere broken and irregular, and masses of rock project from the sides. There are three galleries in the cave, one of which contains the chief object of worship, viz. a stalactite revered as Mah\u00e1deo. This cave has never been thoroughly explored, but its various windings are said to be half a mile long.\n\nGurd\u00e1sipur.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 37' and 32\u00b0 30' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 56' and 75\u00b0 57' E. long. Gurd\u00e1sipur forms the north-eastern District of the Amritsar Division. It is bounded on the north by the Native States of Kashmir and Chamba, on the east by Kangra District and the river Beas (Bi\u00e1s), which separates it from Hoshi\u00e1rpur District and K\u00e1purthala State, on the south-west by Amritsar District, and on the west by Si\u00e1lkot. Area, 1822 square miles; population (1881) 823,695 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Gurd\u00e1sipur; but Batala is the chief centre of trade and population.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Gurd\u00e1sipur occupies the submon-\ntane portion of the B\u0101r\u012b Do\u00e1b, or tract between the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) and the R\u00e1vi, and stretches westward beyond the latter river so as to include a triangular wedge of territory which naturally belongs to the adjoining District of Si\u00e1lkot. An outlying strip of British territory also runs northward as a cart road into the lower Him\u00e1layan ranges, to include the mountain sanitarium of Dalhousie. The rapid torrent of the Chaki separates the Gurd\u00e1spur Hills from those of K\u00e1ngra; while beyond the R\u00e1vi, the Kashmir boundary encroaches on the submontane tract for some 10 miles below the southern escarpment of the Him\u00e1layan system. Dalhousie station crowns the westernmost shoulder of a magnificent snowy range, the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r, between which and the plain two minor ranges intervene. Below the hills stretches a picturesque and undulating plateau, covered with abundant timber, and made green by a copious rainfall. In the triangular wedge west of the R\u00e1vi, water from hill streams is everywhere available for irrigation, besides conferring additional fertility through the deposit of virgin loam. The streams of the B\u0101r\u012b Do\u00e1b, however, diverted by dams and embankments, now empty their waters into the Beas directly, in order that their channels may not interfere with the B\u0101r\u012b Do\u00e1b Canal, which derives its supply from the R\u00e1vi. The central watershed of the Do\u00e1b consists of an elevated plain, contracted to an apex just below the hills, but rapidly spreading out like an open fan until it fills the whole space between the two river-beds. Well-defined banks terminate the plateau on either side, the country falling abruptly away to the present level of the rivers. The bank toward the Beas valley attains a considerable height, and is covered by a ridge of drifted sand; that toward the R\u00e1vi is less marked. The plain, though apparently a dead level, has a sufficient westward slope to cause a rapid flow of water in definite drainage lines after heavy rain. Five principal water-courses of this description collect a volume large enough to be employed for purposes of irrigation many miles beyond the borders of the District.\n\nThe Beas touches the border of the District at Mirth\u00e1l, flowing south-west. At this point it receives the Chaki on its right bank from the north, and after flowing west-south-west for about six miles, curves sharply southwards, which general course it continues till it leaves the District at its extreme southern point, forming the boundary between Gurd\u00e1spur and Hoshi\u00e1rpur for the whole distance. Its western bank is high and rugged, but the present course of the river-bed is at a distance from the high bank, ranging from one to six miles. The cold-weather stream has an average depth of about six feet, and is even fordable in some places; in the rains its average depth is about 20 feet. The river-bed in the upper part of its course is composed of stones and sand, but becomes mixed with mould lower down. Many islands, some of considerable size, are formed. There are no bridges in this section\nof the river; and the ferries, seven in number, are under the charge of the authorities of the neighbouring District of Hoshi\u00e1rpur. The most important are those of Bhal Gh\u00e1t and Naw\u00e1shahr, where the river is crossed by the roads from Bat\u00e1la and Gurd\u00e1spur respectively to Hoshi\u00e1rpur. The R\u00e1vi first touches on the District on the northern border from the hills opposite Bas\u00e1oli in Kashmir. It thence flows southwest, forming the boundary of British territory for about 25 miles, after which it turns south and enters the District by a bifurcating channel, which reunites after a few miles. The stream then turns west, and flows a winding south-westerly course till it leaves Gurd\u00e1spur and forms the boundary between Si\u00e1lkot and Amritsar Districts. The river, which has a depth of 20 feet in the rains, is fordable almost everywhere between December and March, a large body of water being drawn off for the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal. Numerous islands are formed. The river is not noted for important changes by alluvion or diluvion; but in 1879 the stream altered its course, and set straight on to the town of Dera N\u00e1nak. In spite of strenuous efforts made to divert the channel, the river carried away the Tali S\u00e1hib temple, to the north-west of the town, which itself was only saved from destruction by the erection of a strong embankment or bandh. There are no bridges on the river, but ferries are established at fifteen places. The B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal, drawing its supplies from the R\u00e1vi at Madhupur, just south of the hills, runs for some miles through a deep cutting, but emerges on the level a little east of Gurd\u00e1spur town, and divides into three main branches, which become immediately available for irrigation.\n\nThe District contains several large jh\u00edls or swampy lakes, whose shallows afford excellent opportunities for the cultivation of rice and singh\u00e1ra, or water-nut. The largest is a lake in the neighbourhood of Kahnuw\u00e1n, which is about 2000 feet in width and 9 miles in length, with a depth of from 12 or 20 feet in the deepest parts. In the centre of the lake is a pavilion constructed by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sher Singh. It is celebrated for its wild-fowl shooting. The District is well wooded with common trees, though only in scattered clumps. There is nowhere anything like forest. The wild animals of the District include tigers, leopards, wolves, and deer. The water-fowl shooting in the jh\u00edls and marshes is excellent.\n\nHistory.\u2014Few facts can now be recovered with regard to the early annals of Gurd\u00e1spur. The principal cities during the Mughal period were Batala and Path\u00e1nkot. The former town, situated in the centre of the Do\u00e1b, was the residence of Shamsher Kh\u00e1n, the Emperor Akbar's foster-brother, who enlarged the walls, and built a magnificent tank, which still exists. Path\u00e1nkot, at the foot of the hills, once formed the capital of a little R\u00e1jput State, said to have been established in the\n12th century by one Jet P\u00e1l, an emigrant from Delhi. His family afterwards transferred their residence to N\u00farpur, a town situated within the hill tract now included in the neighbouring District of K\u00e1ngra. Kal\u00e1naur also has some claims to antiquity, and finds mention in the Muhammadan annals as the place where the great Akbar learned the news of his father's death, and assumed the title of emperor. Dera N\u00e1nak, on the R\u00e1vi, preserves the name of the founder of the Sikh religion, who died in 1539 at a village on the opposite bank.\n\nIn spite of such local reminiscences, however, we know little of the District as a whole during the days of the Mughal Empire, beyond the fact that its government was administered from the Provincial capital at Lahore. Our first distinct historical knowledge begins with the rise of the Sikh confederacy. After long struggles with the imperial governors on the one hand, and with Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni on the other, the vigorous young sect found itself at last triumphant; and from 1764, its chiefs began to parcel out the Punjab and the cis-Sutlej country into such portions as each could conveniently hold. The western section of the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b fell into the hands of one Amar Singh, surnamed Bhaga, a M\u00e1n J\u00e1t from Amritsar, who joined the misl or community known as the Kanhia. Other chieftains of the same misl occupied neighbouring estates on either side of the R\u00e1vi. Bat\u00e1la fell to Jagra Singh, the famous leader of the R\u00e1mgharia community, together with Dinanagar, Kal\u00e1naur, Sr\u00edgovindpur, and other surrounding towns. Jagra Singh was expelled by the Kanhiyas, but returned in 1783, and securely established himself in his former dominions. He died in 1803, and his son Jodh Singh succeeded to his estates. The latter formed a close friendship with Ranj\u00edt Singh, the great Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Lahore. On his death in 1816, however, Ranj\u00edt Singh took advantage of a disputed succession to annex the whole of his territories. The dominions of the Bhaga family in the western half of the District had been absorbed by the Lahore Government in 1809. Beyond the R\u00e1vi, the triangular wedge, now attached to this District, had fallen piecemeal into the power of Ranj\u00edt Singh by similar acts of spoliation between the years 1789 and 1813. Much of the territory thus acquired remained in the hands of its masters on a feudal tenure (j\u00e1gir), while other estates were granted to new holders.\n\nPath\u00e1nkot and a few neighbouring villages in the plain, together with the whole hill portion of the District, formed part of the area ceded by the Sikhs to the East India Company after the first Sikh war in 1846. Under the original distribution of the new territory, they were attached to K\u00e1ngra; but after the final annexation in 1849, the upper portion of the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b became a separate District, having its head-quarters at Bat\u00e1la. In 1855 the District received an addition by the transfer of Shakargarh tahsil, beyond the R\u00e1vi, the head-quarters\nat the same time being removed to Gurdaspur. In 1861-62, the neck of hill road connecting the plains with the new sanitarium of Dalhousie was acquired by the British Government by purchase from the Chamba State; and this addition brought the District into its present shape. The chief landholder in Gurdaspur at the present time is Sardar Bhagwan Singh of Bat\u0101la, nephew of the great Sikh general, Tej Singh, who commanded at Firozshah and Sobr\u0101on.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The numerous transfers of territory which took place in the interval between the Census of 1855 and those of 1868 and 1881 render it impossible to give a detailed comparison of their results. The last enumeration, that of 1881, was taken over an area of 1822 square miles, and it disclosed a total population of 823,695 persons, distributed among 2272 villages or towns, and inhabiting 111,242 houses. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 452; villages per square mile, 1\u00b725; houses per square mile, 82; persons per village, 362; persons per house, 7\u00b74. Number of families, 185,133. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 445,798; females, 377,897; proportion of males, 54\u00b71 per cent.\n\nAs regards religious distinctions, the population of Gurdaspur is evenly distributed. Hindus number 359,329, or 43\u00b762 per cent.; Muhammadans, 391,400, or 47\u00b752 per cent.; Sikhs, 72,395; Jains, 108; and Christians, 463. The ethnical division shows the following results:\u2014J\u0101ts, 129,755, of whom 38,047 are Hindus, 46,079 Sikhs, and 45,628 Muhammadans\u2014they hold almost the whole of the uplands in the B\u0101ri Do\u00e1b, the Muhammadans being most numerous in the neighbourhood of the hills, while round Bat\u0101la the J\u0101ts are almost universally Sikhs; R\u0101jputs, 71,519, of whom 31,723 are Hindus, and the remainder Musalm\u00e1ns\u2014the greater part of the submontane tract is in the hands of Hindu R\u0101jputs; Br\u0101hmans, 47,899, all Hindus or Sikhs; G\u016bjars, 43,571, Muhammadans almost without exception; Khattris, 15,778, the great majority being Hindus and Sikhs; Kashmir\u00eds, 6662, all Muhammadans; Path\u00e1ns, 9784; Julahas, 40,456, all Muhammadans; Tarkh\u00e1ns, 29,621, of whom 14,061 are Hindus, 10,309 Sikhs, and 5251 Muhammadans; Baniy\u00e1s, 14,804, almost without exception Hindus; and Jhinwars, 34,300, the great majority Hindus and Sikhs.\n\nIn 1881 the District contained 16 municipal towns, but of these only 4 had a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, Bat\u0101la, 24,281; Sujanpur, 6039; Dera Nanak, 5956; Dinanagar, 5589. The other municipal towns, with their populations, are\u2014Kalanaur, 4962; Gurdaspur (the head-quarters of the District), 4706; Sri-Govindpur, 4247; Fatehgarh, 4078; Pathankot, 4344; Narot, 3706; Sukhuchak, 3355; Bahrampur, 2682; Darman, 1618; Naina Kot, 1452; Dalhousie, 1610; and Shahpur, 1258. Dera Nanak\nand SriGovindpur possess great sanctity in the eyes of the Sikhs. The sanitarium of Dalhousie, 7687 feet above sea-level, though only returned as containing a permanent population of 1610 inhabitants, has a large fluctuating population during the hot season. Of the 2272 towns and villages comprising the District in 1881, 993 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 836 from two to five hundred; 307 from five hundred to a thousand; 107 from one to two thousand; 17 from two to three thousand; 8 from three to five thousand; and 4 upwards of five thousand inhabitants.\n\nCondition and Occupation of the People.\u2014It is impossible to form any satisfactory estimate of the wealth of the commercial and industrial classes. It may be said generally that a very large proportion of the artisans are extremely poor, while their fellows in the villages, who mostly receive their wages in the shape of a share of the produce, are hardly less dependent upon the harvests than the agriculturists themselves. The leather-workers (Cham\u00e1rs) may perhaps be excepted, as they derive considerable gains from the hides of cattle which die in a year of drought. As regards the circumstances of the agricultural classes, the District officer wrote as follows in 1879:\u2014'Owing to the successive bad harvests which have lately occurred, the samind\u00e1rs of this District are not now well off. The owners who cultivate their own land are more in debt than the tenant class; and of the tenants, those who pay cash rents are in better circumstances than those whose rents are fixed at a share of the produce. Consequently on last year's drought, some hereditary tenants have deserted their lands without attempting to sell their occupancy rights; in other instances they have sold their rights; and more of them would have deserted their lands, but that they feared they would nevertheless remain responsible for the revenue. Of the total number of agriculturists, three-fourths are in debt; and one-fourth free from debt, able to pay their revenue from their own funds, and selling their grain produce themselves.'\n\nAs regards the occupations of the people, the Census of 1881 divides the adult male population into the following seven main groups:\u2014(1) Professional, 14,971; (2) domestic, 27,409; (3) commercial, 6104; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 135,033; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 66,513; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 22,305; and (7) unspecified, 2830.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The District possesses throughout an excellent soil, except in some small patches on the Bi\u00e1s (Beas) side, where sand covers the surface. The chief agricultural staples are wheat, barley, and gram for the rabi or spring harvest, with rice, j\u00f3t, b\u00e1jra, pulses, cotton, and sugar-cane for the khartf or autumn harvest. Abundant means of irrigation exist where required, either from canals, wells, or mountain streams; but in no part of the Punjab can better crops be\nproduced without such artificial aid. In 1880, the total cultivated area amounted to 856,230 acres, of which 122,840 acres were protected by irrigation against the effects of drought. The Bari Doab Canal supplies 27,674 acres, and the remainder is watered by private enterprise, chiefly from wells. The Ravi and the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) inundate about 44,000 acres in time of flood. The area under the principal crops in 1880-81 was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 285,734 acres; barley, 96,165 acres; gram, 19,490 acres; rice, 80,373 acres; Indian corn, 29,892 acres; jodar, 27,690 acres; bajra, 4641 acres; miscellaneous pulses, 80,943 acres; cotton, 12,500 acres; oil-seeds, 29,781 acres; tobacco, 9599 acres; sugar-cane, 46,895 acres; and vegetables, 12,931 acres. The large proportion of the area devoted to the richer food-grains\u2014wheat, barley, and rice\u2014and to commercial crops like cotton and sugar-cane, sufficiently attests the agricultural prosperity of the District. The average out-turn per acre in lbs. in 1880-81 was returned as under\u2014wheat, 425; rice, 560; inferior grains, 437; oil-seeds, 310; cotton (cleaned), 40; sugar (refined), 240.\n\nThe usual types of communal village tenure prevail throughout the District, differing from one another only in the varying degrees of division between the coparceners. The returns of 1873-74 show that out of a total of 1942 villages, a purely communal tenure exists in only 116. Among the remainder, either the whole or a part of the village lands has been divided off in definite portions to the individual holders. The agricultural stock was approximately estimated as follows in 1879:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 174,651; horses, 2530; ponies, 1370; donkeys, 5498; sheep and goats, 73,495; pigs, 3975; camels, 77; carts, 4475; and ploughs, 57,722. By far the greater part of the area is cultivated by tenants-at-will. Of a total area of 1822 square miles, 1550 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 1139 square miles are cultivated, 118 square miles are cultivable, and 293 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total Government revenue, including cesses and local rates levied on the land, \u00a3124,970. Estimated rental actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3274,372. Rents, however, are almost universally paid in kind, and the rent figures given above represent rather the estimated money value of the produce paid in lieu of a money rent. Agricultural labourers also receive their wages in kind. Cash wages range from 6d. to 1s. per diem for skilled workmen, and from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem for unskilled workmen. On the 1st January 1882, the prices of food-grains and other produce ruled as follows:\u2014Wheat, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; flour (best), 14 sers per rupee, or 8s. per cwt.; rice (best), 6 sers per rupee, or 18s. 8d. per cwt.; barley, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; gram, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; bajra, 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 21 sers per rupee,\nor 5s. 4d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; cotton (cleaned), 2\u00bd sers per rupee, or \u00a32, 4s. per cwt.; and sugar (refined), 1\u00bc sers per rupee, or \u00a34, 8s. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The famine of 1869\u201370, which caused severe distress in the adjoining District of Amritsar, scarcely affected the prosperity of Gurdaspur. The harvests attained an average excellence, and high prices enabled the cultivators to make large profits. On 1st January 1870, wheat sold at 10 sers per rupee, or 11s. 2d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The trade of the District consists mainly in the export of its agricultural produce, the chief items being wheat, rice, raw sugar, and cotton. These staples pass in small consignments by road to Amritsar, or by boat to Lahore and Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan). The imports are insignificant, as the wants of the District are chiefly met by home production. English piece-goods, salt, and fancy articles form the main items. The local traffic centres on Bat\u00e1la. Coarse cotton cloth is manufactured in the villages, and better fabrics at Bat\u00e1la, in imitation of the work of the Amritsar looms. Sericulture is an important and rising industry, and groves of mulberry trees are plentiful. The principal road of the District connects Amritsar with Path\u00e1nkot, at the foot of the hills, and passes through Bat\u00e1la, Gurdaspur, and Din\u00e1nagar. Minor lines radiate from Bat\u00e1la and Gurdaspur to Jalandhar, Hoshi\u00e1rpur, Si\u00e1lkot, and other surrounding towns. The total length of highways in 1882 was 66 miles of metalled and 595 miles of unmetalled road. Water communication is afforded by 109 miles of navigable rivers.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue of the District has been slowly but steadily increasing of late years. In 1876\u201377, the total receipts amounted to \u00a3123,608; in 1880\u201381, to \u00a3136,705; and in 1882\u201383, to \u00a3138,627. The land-tax, however, has slightly decreased within this period. It amounted to \u00a3108,641 in 1876\u201377; to \u00a3104,677 in 1880\u201381; and to \u00a3105,910 in 1882\u201383. The other principal items of revenue are stamps and excise. The land settlement, effected in 1863\u201365, expired in 1883. Besides the imperial revenue, an income of not less than \u00a310,000 is raised by local cesses for expenditure upon works of public utility within the District. The administrative staff usually includes three covenanted or staff-corps civilians. An Assistant Commissioner is always stationed at Dalhousie. In 1882\u201383, the District contained 17 civil and revenue judges of all ranks; and 16 officers exercised magisterial powers. The regular or imperial police in 1882 consisted of a total force of 448 officers and men, of whom 332 were available for protective and detective duties, the remainder being employed as guards over jails, treasuries, and as escorts, etc. A municipal force of 129 men is maintained in the towns, and a ferry police of 16 men. These forces are further supplemented by a large body of rural watchmen.\nGURDASPUR TAHSIL.\n\n(chaukidars), of whose numbers, however, no returns exist. In 1882, the police investigated 988 'cognisable' cases, in which convictions were obtained in 275. In these cases, 719 persons were put upon trial, of whom 411 were convicted. The District jail at Gurdaspur and lock-up at Dalhousie received in 1882 a total number of 1418 prisoners, the daily average number of inmates being 262. Education makes slow but steady progress. In 1881-82, the State contributed to the support of 121 schools, having an aggregate roll of 5628 pupils, showing an average area of 15.06 square miles to each school, and 6.83 scholars per thousand of the population. There are, however, a number of private schools; and the Census Report returned 7438 boys and 177 girls as under instruction, besides 17,480 males and 267 females who can read and write, but are not under instruction. The 16 municipal towns had a total income of \u00a37018 in 1882-83; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 9d. per head of population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate at Gurdaspur town is comparatively agreeable to Europeans even during the summer months; but the heat increases rapidly on receding farther from the hills. The mean temperature in 1871 was 86.85\u00b0 F. in May, and 53.8\u00b0 in December, at Gurdaspur; and 67.8\u00b0 in May, and 46.96\u00b0 in December, at Dalhousie. The maximum in the shade during the same year was 113.3\u00b0 at Gurdaspur, and 85\u00b0 at Dalhousie. No later thermometrical returns are available. The rainfall is regular and plentiful, but decreases with the distance from the hills. The average annual rainfall at Gurdaspur for the 25 years ending 1881 amounted to 31.75 inches. In 1881, the rainfall was 31 inches, or .75 of an inch below the average. The District is not considered unhealthy, though large swamps in the neighbourhood of some of the lesser towns expose them to malarious fevers and ague; and the same results are attributed to excessive irrigation elsewhere in the plains. The total number of deaths recorded in 1881 was 26,466, being at the rate of 32.13 per thousand of the population. In 1882, the recorded death-rate was 26 per thousand. Thirteen charitable dispensaries afforded relief in the same year to 110,259 persons, of whom 930 were in-patients.

Roe, Esq., C.S., dated July 1873; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; the Punjab Provincial Administration Reports, 1881 to 1883.]\n\nGurdaspur.\u2014Central tahsil of Gurdaspur District, Punjab; situated between lat. 32\u00b0 12' 45\" and 31\u00b0 47' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 8' and 75\u00b0 38' 30\" E. Area, 484 square miles; population (1881) 208,228, namely, males 114,285, and females 93,943; average density, 431 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014\nMuhammadans, 106,836; Hindus, 86,325; Sikhs, 14,887; and 'others,' 180. The revenue of the tahsil in 1882-83 was \u00a320,412. The administrative staff consisted of a Deputy Commissioner, with a judicial Assistant, and 3 Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioners, with a tahsildar and 2 munsifs. These officers presided over 6 civil and revenue and 7 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; strength of regular police, 107 men; village watchmen (chauktiddrs), 439.\n\nGurd\u00e1spur.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 2' 40\" N., long. 75\u00b0 24' E. Situated on the elevated plain midway between the R\u00e1vi and the Beas, 44 miles north-east of Amritsar, on the Path\u00e1nkot road. Population in 1872, 4137; in 1881, 4706, namely, 2518 Hindus, 1989 Muhammadans, 168 Sikhs, 4 Jains, and 38 'others;' number of houses, 821. The town was selected as the head-quarters of the District in 1856, on account of its central position. Small civil station, containing courthouse and treasury, jail, posting bungalow, sar\u00e1\u00ed, tahsil, police station, post-office, dispensary, and school-house. Well wooded and comparatively cool, even during the summer months. The town is unimportant, except as a trading centre for the produce of the neighbouring villages; irrigated by the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal. The streets are, as a rule, well paved, though many of them are narrow and crooked. The drainage and sanitary arrangements are fairly good. Exports of sugar and food-grains to Amritsar. The historical interest of the town centres in the fort of Gurd\u00e1spur, erected by the Sikh leader Banda during the troubles which ensued on the death of the Emperor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h in 1712. The Sikhs rose as a body against the Mughals; and, though at first successful, Banda was at length defeated by the Imperial forces, and was forced to seek refuge in Gurd\u00e1spur fort. After a lengthy siege, having consumed all his provisions, and eaten horses, asses, and even the sacred ox, Banda was forced to surrender. The victorious troops inaugurated a wholesale massacre of the unhappy Sikhs, Banda was marched to Delhi in an iron cage, and put to death with horrible torture. (Vide article INDIA.) The remnant of the Sikhs sought refuge in the hills and jungles, and as a people they are scarcely heard of in history for a whole generation. The old fort now contains a monastery of Saraswati Br\u00e1hmans, who have adopted many of the Sikh tenets and customs. The proximity of the hill sanitarium of Dalhousie renders Gurd\u00e1spur a favourite station with European officials. A third-class municipality, with a revenue in 1880-81 of \u00a3380; in 1882, \u00a3475; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 0\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\nGurg\u00e1on.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 27\u00b0 39' and 28\u00b0 30' 45\" N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 20' 45\" and 77\u00b0 35' E. long. Gurg\u00e1on forms the southern District of the\nDelhi Division. It is bounded on the north by Rohtak and Delhi Districts; on the west and south-west by portions of the Alwar (Ulwur), Jaipur, N\u00e1bha, and Duj\u00e1na Native States; on the south by the Bhartpur State and Muttra District of the North-Western Provinces; on the east by the river Jumna; and on the north-east by Delhi District. Area, 1938 square miles; population (1881) 641,848. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Gurgaon, but Rewari is the chief centre of trade and population.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Gurgaon comprises the southernmost corner of the Punjab, and stretches away from the level plain which composes the greater portion of that Province, towards the outlying hills of the Rajputana table-land. Its surface presents a greater variety of contour than is usual among the alluvial Districts to the north and west. Two low rocky ranges enter its borders from the south, and run northward in a bare and unshaded mass toward the plain country. The western ridge divides the District for some distance from the adjacent Native State of Alwar (Ulwur), and finally terminates in three low and stony spurs a few miles south of the civil station; while the eastern line disappears some 25 miles from the frontier, but again crops up at the north-eastern angle, and runs on into the District of Delhi, where it abuts at last upon the Jumna close to the Mughal capital. The highest point of either range does not exceed 600 feet above the level of the neighbouring plain; and a scanty growth of grass in the rainy season, together with a few patches of scrub jungle, alone redeems the coarse sandstone summits from utter sterility. The northern plain falls into two natural divisions, on either side of the western range. Eastwards, the valley between the two ridges lies wide and open throughout; and after the escarpment of the shorter ridge, an alluvial level extends in an unbroken line to the bank of the Jumna.\n\nThe soil, although abruptly diversified in character, affords fair facilities for agriculture. Midway between the river and the hills, water occurs at a depth of 70 feet below the surface. Immediately at the foot of the uplands, undulating hollows become filled with water during the rains, forming extensive swamps. Westward from the sandstone range lies the sub-division of Rewari, almost entirely separated from the remainder of the District, with which it is connected only by a narrow strip of territory. It consists of a sandy plain, dotted with isolated hills, but having water at a depth which permits of easy irrigation from wells. Though naturally dry and sterile, it has grown under the careful hands of its Ahir inhabitants into a well-cultivated tract. Numerous torrents carry off the drainage from the upland ranges; and the most important among them empty themselves at last into the Najafgarh jhil. This swampy lake lies to the north and north-west of the civil\nstation of Gurgaon, and stretches long arms into the neighbouring Districts of Delhi and Rohtak. Embankments raised for purposes of irrigation check the water of the smaller torrents at their exit from the hills, and distribute it among the neighbouring cultivated fields.\n\nThe Jumna receives no tributaries in this District. Salt is manufactured from brine in wells at twelve villages near Noh, and in others on the border of Rohtak. Iron-ore abounds in the southern portion of the hills, and Firozpur (Ferozepore) Jhirku in the extreme south once possessed considerable smelting works, now rendered unremunerative by the exhaustion of the timber. The other mineral products include traces of copper-ore, inferior plumbago, and ochre. Sonah, at the base of the western range, has a sulphur spring whose medicinal properties rank high in the treatment of rheumatism, Delhi ulcers, and other cutaneous disorders. The District contains no forest, and few trees of any sort. Wolves are common in the hills, and leopards are occasionally shot. Deer abound throughout; nilgai may be met with more rarely; while jackals, hares, pea-fowl, and foxes are found in all parts of the District.\n\nHistory.\u2014Gurgaon possesses but little historical interest, and contains no noteworthy relics of antiquity. In the Muhammadan annals, however, it finds frequent mention under the name of Mewat, or country of the Meos, who form to this day one of the most important of its tribes. These Ishmaelites of Upper India gave constant trouble by their turbulence to the authorities of Delhi during the Mughal period. Marauding bands would issue from the dense jungle, which then clothed the whole western portion of the District, and plunder the cultivated plain up to the very walls of the imperial city. So secure were their fastnesses among the hills, that no repressive efforts ever took permanent effect. Gurgaon remained without any annals during the whole period of Mughal and Maratha supremacy, and passed into our hands as a mere desert after Lord Lake's conquests in 1803. Semi-independent chieftains then held the territory on military tenures; and only the unalienated portion passed under the civil administration of the Delhi Political Agent. Gradually, however, as estate after estate lapsed from failure of heirs, or from forfeiture through misconduct, the District assumed its present form. Many years passed before order could be firmly established in these savage wilds. Bishop Heber, who passed through Gurgaon in 1825, describes the country as still badly cultivated, while he speaks of its state only fifteen years before as resembling that of the tarai, abounding with tigers, and having no human inhabitants except banditti. But under the settled influence of British rule, improvements steadily and rapidly progressed, so that the officers engaged upon the land settlement in 1836 found few traces either of the jungle or the tigers. The banditti were still\nrepresented, perhaps, by many turbulent tribes, especially among the R\u00e1jputs; but the general condition of affairs had been greatly ameliorated.\n\nNo single date can be given for the extension of direct British administration over the whole of this outlying tract. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) at first farmed Rew\u00e1ri and Bhasra divisions; but his grant was revoked on the outbreak of the Bhartpur war in 1804. Thenceforth, the native chieftains held their lands direct from our Government during good conduct; and the District was formed from the various lapsed estates which fell in from time to time. The last important addition took place in 1858, when the territories held by the Naw\u00e1bs of Farukhnagar and Jhajjar were confiscated on account of their participation in the Mutiny. The administrative head-quarters were originally fixed at the small cantonment of Bharaw\u00e1s, near Rew\u00e1ri, but were transferred to the unimportant village of Gurg\u00e1on in 1821. The District, with the rest of the Delhi territory, was annexed in 1832 to the Government of the North-Western Provinces, and so remained until 1858. On the outbreak of the Mutiny at Delhi in May 1857, the Naw\u00e1b of Farukhnagar rose in rebellion. The marauding Meos followed his example, and flew to arms. The public buildings and records at Rew\u00e1ri were preserved from destruction; but with this exception, British authority became extinguished for a time throughout Gurg\u00e1on. So long as the siege of Delhi lasted, no attempt was made to restore order; but after the fall of the rebel capital, a force marched into the District, and easily captured or dispersed the leaders of rebellion. Civil administration was resumed under orders from the Government of the Punjab, to which Province the District was formally annexed on the final pacification of the country.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A Census of the District effected in 1853, under the Government of the North-Western Provinces, returned the total number of inhabitants at 682,486. A second Census, taken in 1868, on the reduced area of the District as it at present stands, returned a population of 689,034. In 1881, at the last Census, the population was ascertained to be 641,848, or a decrease of 47,186 upon that of 1868. This decrease is due to deaths and emigration caused by the terrible distress owing to want of rain, and by sickness, from which Gurg\u00e1on had suffered for four years previous to the Census of 1881. The details of the last Census may be thus summarized:\u2014Area of District, 1938 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1160; number of houses, 94,845, of which 65,986 were occupied, and 28,859 unoccupied. Total population, 641,848, namely, males 338,917, and females 302,931. Number of families, 153,421. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 331; villages per square mile, '6; houses per square mile, 49; persons per village, 553; persons\nper house, 9\u00b77. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 439,264, or 68\u00b74 per cent.; Muhammadans, 198,610, or 30\u00b79 per cent.; Jains, 3777; Sikhs, 127; and Christians, 70.\n\nWith reference to the ethnical divisions and caste distinctions of the people, the Meos form the largest element, being returned at 103,678. The J\u00e1ts rank second in numerical order, with a total of 64,342. The Meos are probably almost pure aborigines of the same stock as the M\u00ednas, though perhaps with an admixture of R\u00e1jput blood. They hold large tracts of land in the southern portion of the District, and are now without exception Musalm\u00e1ns, though retaining many Hindu customs. The tribe has laid aside its former lawless turbulence; and the Meos, though still thriftless, extravagant, and lazy, now rank among the most peaceable communities in the Punjab. The J\u00e1ts live chiefly in Palw\u00e1l and the northern parg\u00e1ns. Very few of them, as well as of the G\u00fajars, have here, as they have done in other Districts, deserted their ancestral religion for the faith of Isl\u00e1m. Some of their villages worthily sustain the general high reputation of the tribe; but others are reported as ill cultivated. The Ah\u00edrs number 64,884. They form the bulk of the population in Rew\u00e1ri, and are justly esteemed for the skill and perseverance with which they have developed the naturally poor resources of that sterile region. The Br\u00e1hmans are returned at 52,642; Baniy\u00e1s, 36,809; G\u00fajars, 20,955; R\u00e1jputs, 26,483. The Muhammadan tribes by race descent include\u2014Shaikhs, 10,157; Path\u00e1ns, 4945; Sayyids, 3518; and Baluch\u00eds, 2166. The two last-named tribes bear a bad name as indolent and thriftless cultivators, and swell the returns of crime far beyond their just proportion. The criminal class of M\u00ednas are notorious for their thieving propensities. Devi, under the name of S\u00edtala, as goddess of small-pox, forms one of the chief objects of Hindu worship throughout the District.\n\nThe Census Report returns the following eight towns:\u2014Rew\u00e1ri, 23,972; Palwal, 10,635; Farukhnagar, 8378; Sohna, 7374; Firozpur Jhirka, 6878; Hodal, 6453; Nuh, 4219; and Gurgaon, the civil station, 3990. Of the 1160 towns and villages comprising the District in 1881, 352 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 464 from two to five hundred, 214 from five hundred to a thousand, 84 from one to two thousand, 27 from two to three thousand, 13 from three to five thousand, 4 from five to ten thousand, and one upwards of twenty thousand. The head-quarters town is only noticeable from the presence of the civil station.\n\nGeneral Condition and Occupation of the People.\u2014It is impossible to form any satisfactory estimate of the wealth of the commercial and industrial classes. A large proportion of the artisans in the towns may be described as extremely poor, while their fellows in the villages whose wages in many cases take the form of a fixed share of agricultural pro-\nduce, are scarcely less dependent upon the harvest than are the cultivators themselves.\n\nAs regards the position of the cultivators, the District officer wrote as follows in 1879:\u2014'The general condition of the agricultural population may be said to be painfully dependent on the seasons; all their income comes from the land. Where a landowner, besides the actual produce of his own separate holding, can count in his income the proceeds of hiring his cart between the busy times or of the sale of his ghi, he finds that in a year of drought even these are apt to fail him, for the difficulty of feeding his oxen and his buffaloes swallows up all the income they bring, and where a cultivator ekes out the produce of his fields by his dues as a village servant or family priest, he finds the villagers, in seasons of scarcity, unable to pay him the full fee. The Jats of Palwal are now pretty well protected against drought, but are in danger of increasing their expenditure too fast, and losing some of their old industry and thrift; but they may be generally described as well off, especially the landowners. They can easily stand a year of scarcity, and will probably soon recover themselves, though even they, like all agriculturists, are apt to neglect payment of the principal, and even of the interest, of a debt once contracted, and often carelessly allow the sum against them in the money-lender's books to grow and grow until they can have little hope of paying it off, the wily banker knowing it to be his interest not to press for ready payment, but to encourage his debtor deeper into the toils, until he has him completely at his mercy. When this is so with men having such advantages as the Jats of Palwal, what must it be with the Meos? Their condition is rapidly becoming hopeless. They live literally from hand to mouth, carelessly contracting debt for marriages, funerals, and petty luxuries even in average years, so that when a year of drought comes they are thrown on the money-lender, who can make with them what terms he likes. During the past fifteen months about five per cent. of the cultivated area of the two Meo tahsils of Nuh and Firozpur has been mortgaged, and now 17 per cent. of the total cultivated area is so burdened that there is little hope of its ever being redeemed. The Meo landowners are rapidly becoming practically reduced to the position of tenants. Their condition loudly calls for special consideration, though it is difficult to see what can be done for them. A large amount of revenue due from them has been suspended, but they have had to borrow for food, and the evil has only been reduced, not removed. Not a few who had no land to mortgage left the District to seek a means of livelihood elsewhere until better times. It is pleasant to turn from this state of things to the Ahirs in Rewari. With all their disadvantages, their industry reduces the evils of a year of drought to a minimum, and their thrift supplies them\nwith a means of tiding over it, and reduces their expenditure for the time. Though the drought of last year was as bad with them as anywhere, they paid their revenue, and that without contracting a larger amount of debt than they are likely to clear off in a year or two of favourable seasons, should they be fortunate enough to have them.'\n\nClassified according to occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the adult male population under the following seven main groups:\u2014(1) professional, 8621; (2) domestic, 9290; (3) commercial, 5017; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 107,907; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 43,963; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 21,952; (7) unspecified, 16,811.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of 1,240,366 acres, as many as 993,512 were returned in 1881\u201382 as under cultivation. From the remainder, 162,096 acres must be deducted for uncultivable waste, leaving a narrow margin of only 84,758 acres of available soil not yet brought under the plough. Wheat and barley form the principal staples of the rabi or spring harvest; while jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra, the two common millets, make up the chief items among the khartf or autumn harvest. These millets compose the ordinary food of the people themselves, the wheat and barley, where grown singly, being universally reserved for exportation. Wheat and other cereals are largely grown intermixed, in inferior soils, for home consumption. Gram, oil-seeds, pulses, cotton, and tobacco are also important crops. Irrigation is not very generally practised. The Agra Canal, which draws its supplies from the Jumna some miles below Delhi, and traverses the eastern portion of the District, irrigates about 50,000 acres; and dams on the hill torrents irrigate about 7000 acres at the foot of the table-land. With these exceptions, however, artificial irrigation can only be practised with great labour from wells, often of immense depth. The use of the Persian wheel is unknown, and water is drawn in leather buckets. The returns of 1881\u201382 give the area irrigated by State works at 38,492 acres; by private enterprise, 122,575 acres; dependent upon the seasons, 832,445 acres. The area under the principal crops in the same year was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 60,446 acres; barley, 141,839 acres; jo\u00e1r, 110,822 acres; b\u00e1jra, 248,459 acres; gram, 75,485 acres; pulses, 150,109 acres; oil-seeds, 7882 acres; cotton, 67,399 acres; and tobacco, 1363 acres.\n\nVillage communities own the soil in varying degrees of communal or individual proprietorship. Out of a total number of 1139 villages in 1873\u201374, only 237 retained the primitive form of joint tenure; in the remainder, the whole or some part of the land had been divided into definite portions for the separate sharers. Under all circumstances, the State holds the entire village responsible for the payment of the land revenue assessed upon it. By far the\nlarger number of under tenants possess no rights of occupancy. Of a total area of 1938 square miles, 1919 square miles are assessed at a Government revenue, including cesses and local rates, of \u00a3133,700. Total estimated rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3260,624. Rents are often but not usually paid in kind, by division of the produce, the landlord receiving from one-fourth to one-half of the gross out-turn. Agricultural labour is also paid in kind. Cash wages in 1881-82 ranged from 7\u00bdd. to 9d. per diem for skilled workmen, and from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem for unskilled workmen. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on 1st January 1882:\u2014Wheat, 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt.; barley, 27\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt.; gram, 22\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Owing to the deficiency of artificial irrigation, Gurgaon must always be exposed to great risk from drought. Eight periods of dearth have occurred since the disastrous year 1783, known throughout Upper India as the San ch\u00e1ltsa famine\u2014namely, in 1803, 1812, 1817, 1833, 1837, 1860, 1869, and 1877. In 1833 and 1837, many villages, according to report, lost their entire population through death and emigration. In 1869-70, the distress was chiefly confined to the crowd of starving immigrants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, many of whom entered British territory in too emaciated a condition to permit of their being employed upon relief works. The autumn harvest of 1869 proved moderate in its yield, thus averting the extremities of famine endured in some of the neighbouring Districts. Government organized measures of relief, both gratuitously and by means of public works; and in September 1869, the total number of persons obtaining relief amounted to 8336. On 1st January 1870, wheat sold at 8 sers per rupee, or 14s. per cwt.; barley at 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.; and b\u00e1jra at 20\u00bd sers per rupee, or 5s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt. The drought of 1877 resulted in a total failure of the autumn crop; and though prices did not rise so high as in 1869, and there was no actual deficiency of grain in the District, the poorer class of cultivators and all village servants suffered severely, and hundreds of immigrants, arriving in a half-starved condition from Native States to the south, died of want.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.**\u2014The traffic of Gurgaon District centres in the town of Rewari, which ranks as one of the chief trading emporiums in the Punjab. Its merchants transact a large part of the commerce between the States of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na and the Northern Provinces of British India. Salt from the Sambhar Lake, together with iron, forms the principal import; while sugar, grain, and English piece-goods compose the staple items of the return trade. Hardware of mixed metal is the chief manufacturing industry. In 1871-72, the imports of\nRew\u00e1ri were valued at \u00a3208,892, and the exports at \u00a399,028. Cereals and pulses are produced in the District considerably beyond the needs of home consumption; but while the traders formerly hoarded the surplus supply, and only parted with it when high prices in some neighbouring market afforded an unusually good opportunity for the seller, of late years a steady export trade in grain has sprung up, since the extension of railway communications has produced an equalization of prices throughout the country. In ordinary years, very little export of grain takes place. NUH, FIROZPUR (FEROZEPORE), PALWAL, HODAL, and HASANPUR are the chief minor marts for country produce. FARUKHNAGAR is the entrepot for the Sult\u00e1npur\u00ed salt, obtained by evaporation on the banks of the NAJAFGARH j\u00fad, both in this District and in Rohtak. The means of communication are not of the highest order. One good metalled road traverses the District, from Delhi to Muttra, but the lines of greatest mercantile importance are unmetalled, and become heavy and difficult during the rainy season. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, however, now passes through the District, with stations at Gurg\u00e1on, Garhi Harsaru, Jat\u00e1oli, Khal\u00edlpur, and Rew\u00e1ri. A branch line from Jh\u00e1rsa connects Farukhnagar with the main system. In 1882\u201383, Gurg\u00e1on contained 45 miles of metalled and 741 miles of unmetalled road, besides 48 miles of railway, and 15 miles of navigable water communication.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue derived from the District in 1875\u201376 amounted to \u00a3111,885, of which \u00a3107,008 was contributed by the land-tax. In 1881\u201382, the total revenue had increased to \u00a3134,350, and the land revenue to \u00a3121,837. The present settlement was begun in the year 1871\u201372. Besides the imperial revenue, an income of about \u00a38000 is annually raised by local cesses, for expenditure upon works of public utility within the District. The administrative staff usually includes two covenanted civilians. In 1881\u201382, 11 civil and revenue judges had jurisdiction in the District, and 15 officers exercised magisterial powers. During the same year, the regular police force, including the municipal constabulary, numbered 501 men, yielding an average of 1 policeman to every 3\u00b78 square miles of area and every 1280 of the population. This establishment is further supplemented by the usual body of village watchmen (chaukiddrs), whose numbers, however, are not on record. The District jail at Gurg\u00e1on had a daily average prison population of 79. Education makes slow progress. In 1875\u201376, the State supported or aided 66 schools, with a total roll of 3560 pupils; in 1882 these schools had increased to 84, and the pupils to 4025. There are also several private indigenous schools, which in 1882 were returned at 71 in number, with 731 pupils. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into 5 tahsils. The 7 municipal\ntowns had a total revenue of \u00a36495 in 1881-82, being at the rate of 1s. 10\u00bdd. per head of the population within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The summer heat of Gurgaon reaches a great intensity. No neighbouring mountains or shady groves temper the scorching rays of the sun; while burning winds from the barren uplands of Rajputana sweep over it with full effect. No record of temperature, however, exists. The average annual rainfall for twenty years ending 1881 amounted to 27\u00b769 inches. The total rainfall in 1881 was 21\u00b771 inches, or 5\u00b798 inches below the average. The dryness of the air is generally favourable to health, but small-pox is very prevalent, and severe fevers occur in September and October at the close of the rainy season. The total number of deaths recorded in the District during the year 1882 was 17,311, being at the rate of 27 per thousand of the population. The District contained 8 charitable dispensaries in 1882, which afforded relief to 36,907 persons, of whom 1618 were in-patients. [For further information regarding Gurgaon District, see the Gurgaon District Gazetteer, by D. J. H. Ibbetson, Esq., C.S. (Lahore, 1884); the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the Punjab Provincial and Departmental Administration Reports, 1881 to 1883.]\n\nGurgaon.\u2014Northern tahsil of Gurgaon District, Punjab; consisting for the most part of a level cultivated plain. Area, 407 square miles Population (1881) 122,371, namely, males 65,382, and females 56,989; average density, 301 per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 99,227; Muhammadans, 21,661; Sikhs, 65; and \u2018others,\u2019 1418. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a320,412. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, with 3 Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioners, a tahsildar, and 2 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 6 civil and revenue and 5 criminal courts. Number of police circles (thandas), 3; strength of regular police, 61 men, with 271 village watchmen.\n\nGurgaon.\u2014Administrative head-quarters of Gurgaon District, Punjab; situated on the Rajputana State Railway, distant 21 miles south of Delhi. Lat. 28\u00b0 27' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 4' E. Population (1872) 3539; (1881) 3990, namely, Hindus, 2382; Muhammadans, 1449; Sikhs, 34; Jains, 100; \u2018others,\u2019 25. Number of houses, 451. The town scarcely deserves to rank higher than a country village, with an administrative importance from the presence of the civil station, which was removed hither from Bharawas in 1821. The main bazar consists of a street of good brick-built shops, and a trade in grain is springing up, but is not yet (1883) well established. At the beginning of the present century, Gurgaon formed part of the estates held by the well-known Begam Samru of Sardhana, which lapsed on her death in 1836, and were incorporated with British territory. The place then served for some time as a military cantonment; and this circumstance,\ncombined with the healthiness of the situation, led to its adoption as District head-quarters. The station stands like an island in the midst of cultivated fields. The public buildings include a court-house and treasury, police court, tahsili, police station, dispensary, staging bungalow, and sard\u00e1. Good public garden.\n\n**Gurguchha.**\u2014Town in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Central India. Latitude 23\u00b0 46' 30\" N., longitude 75\u00b0 35' E. Population (1881) 1170, dwelling in 480 houses.

Approximate lat. 27\u00b0 52' N., long. 84\u00b0 28' E. It was formerly the capital of the Gurkh\u00e1l\u00eds, or ruling race of Nep\u00e1l, to whom it gave its name. A rough bridle-road, over country for the most part steep and difficult, connects Gurkh\u00e1 with Kh\u00e1tmandu. The Trisulgang\u00e1 is crossed near Nay\u00e1kot by an excellent bridge, which is carefully guarded. A small and badly-equipped local levy is the only military force maintained in Gurkh\u00e1. A coarse cotton cloth is manufactured for local consumption. The annual fair in honour of Gorakhn\u00e1th takes place in February.\n\n**G\u00farpur.**\u2014River in South Kanara District, Madras Presidency; enters the sea 2 miles north of Mangalore, and, with the Nitr\u00e1vati, forms the Mangalore harbour.\u2014See MANGALORE.\n\n**Gurrakonda.**\u2014Town and ancient fort in Kadapa (Cuddapah) District, Madras Presidency. Latitude 13\u00b0 46' N., longitude 78\u00b0 38' E.; containing 201 houses and (1881) 1060 inhabitants, namely, 827 Hindus and 233 Muhammadans. One of the most important fortresses in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t. It is supposed to have been first built by the Golconda kings, and is situated on the summit of a detached and almost inaccessible hill. It was the capital of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, one of the five circars (sark\u00e1rs) of the Karn\u00e1tic, at the commencement of the 18th century. Afterwards, when held by a Paleg\u00e1r under the Kurpa (Cuddapah) Naw\u00e1b, it was of such importance that the tenure was purely military, and the governor had the privilege of coining money. When M\u00edr S\u00e1hib betrayed Sira (1766), he received Gurrakonda (which had at some former time been held by his ancestors) as a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 j\u00e1gir. Two years later, he made it over to Haidar, his brother-in-law. In 1771, Sayyid Sh\u00e1h, Haidar's general, surrendered it to Trimbak R\u00e1o. Tip\u00fa recaptured it in 1773. In 1791, the Niz\u00e1m's forces, aided by a British battery under Captain R\u00e7ad, besieged\nGurrakonda, and captured the lower fort, but the citadel held out till\nthe peace, when the place was ceded to the Niz\u00e1m. In 1799 it was\ntransferred to the British, with the rest of the District of Cuddapah.\n\n**Gursarai.**\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces, and\ncapital of a small j\u00e1gir estate. Situated on the Jal\u00e1un and S\u00e1gar road,\n40 miles north-east of Jh\u00e1nsi, in lat. 25\u00b0 36' 55\" N., long. 79\u00b0 13' 15\" E.\nPopulation (1872) 6368; (1881) 6528, namely, Hindus, 5939; Muham-\nmadans, 512; and Jains, 77. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 is a Deccani Pandit, whose\nfamily settled in Bundelkhand under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Peshw\u00e1s. The\ntown consists in large part of brick-built houses and double-storied shops.\nAn imposing fort, with buildings raised to a height of 250 feet, over-\nlooks it from the west. Numerous retainers and followers of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\nswell the population of the town. Trade in sugar, imported from\nHam\u00edrpur District. The estate comprises 63 surrounding villages.\n\n**Gurudw\u00e1ra.**\u2014Town in Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces.\u2014See DEHRA.\n\n**Guru-B\u00edkar.**\u2014The name given to the highest peak of Mount Abu,\nR\u00e1jput\u00e1na; elevation, 5653 feet above sea-level.\u2014See ABU.\n\n**Guruv\u00e1y\u00far.**\u2014Village in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.\nLatitude 10\u00b0 36' N., longitude 76\u00b0 4' E.; containing 1160 houses and\n(1881) 6686 inhabitants, namely, 4946 Hindus, 527 Muhammadans,\n1206 Christians, and 7 'others.' Notable for its large temples,\ndestroyed by Tip\u00fa in 1774, and restored by the Zamorin in 1791.\n\n**Guthni.**\u2014Town in S\u00e1ran District, Bengal, situated on the east bank\nof the Little Gandak river, 54 miles north-west of Chapr\u00e1 town.

Fine b\u00e1d\u00e1r.\n\n**G\u00fati.**\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Gooty.\n\n**Guw\u00e1rich (Gwarich).**\u2014Pargand of Gonda District, Oudh. Bounded\nnorth by the Terhi river and Gonda pargand; east by Digs\u00e1r pargan\u00e1;\nsouth by the Gogra river, separating it from Bara Bank\u00ed District;\nand west by Kur\u00e1sar pargan\u00e1 in Bahr\u00e1ich. In the time of Suhel\nDeo, the head of the R\u00e1jput confederate princes who ousted the\nMuhammadan invaders under Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad in 1032 A.D.,\nGuw\u00e1rich was included in the pargan\u00e1 of R\u00e1mgarh Ga\u00fariy\u00e1 in the\nkingdom of Gaud\u00e1, which comprised the present Districts of Gonda,\nBasti, and Gorakhpur. It afterwards became included in the Kur\u00e1sa\nr\u00e1j; and on the downfall of Achal Singh (vide GONDA DISTRICT), it\npassed into the hands of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j Singh, an illegitimate son of the late\nR\u00e1j\u00e1, whose descendants are still in possession of the soil. Several\nrivers and streams intersect the pargan\u00e1, which slopes from north-\nwest to south-east, the lower levels being the most fertile. Area, 267\nsquare miles, or 170,962 acres, of which 99,155 acres are cultivated, as\nfollow: \u2014 Indian corn, 37,394 acres; rice, 25,342; wheat, 24,355; barley, 10,549; gram, 7776; other crops, 23,145 acres. Government land revenue, \u00a316,033. Population (1869) 164,745; (1881), Hindus, 132,485; Muhammadans, 10,582; Native Christians, 9: total, 143,076, namely, 73,737 males and 69,339 females. Number of villages, 219; average density of population, 535 per square mile.\n\nGuzerat.\u2014Northern maritime Province of the Bombay Presidency. \u2014See GUJARAT.\n\nGwalior.\u2014Native State in political relationship with the Central India Agency and the Government of India. The possessions of the great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs of the house of Sindh\u00eda consist of several detached Districts, which are so intermingled with Muhammadan, R\u00e1jput, and other principalities, and with British territory, that the boundaries here given will be restricted to that portion of territory which exhibits the largest and most compact area generally included in the name Gwalior; that is to say, the immediate centre at once of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Sindhia\u2019s power, and of those protective influences which are exercised over His Highness\u2019 country by the Imperial Government of India. This country forms the northern and main portion of the Gwalior State; it contains the city and fortress of Gwalior, and the British cantonments of Mor\u00e1r, G\u00fana (Goona), and Jh\u00e1nsi, and lies between the parallels of 23\u00b0 20' and 26\u00b0 52' N., and the meridians of 76\u00b0 15' and 79\u00b0 12' E. It is bounded on the north-east and north-west by the Chambal river, which separates it from the British Districts of Agra and Et\u00e1wah, and the Native States of Dholp\u00far, Karauli, and Jaipur (Jeypore) of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; on the east by the British Districts of Jalaun, Jh\u00e1nsi, Lal\u00edtpur, and S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor); on the south by the States of Bhop\u00e1l, Tonk, Kilchipur, and R\u00e1jgarh; and on the west by those of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, Tonk, and Kotah of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The detached pargan\u00e1s of the Gwalior State, not included in the above main portion, are as follow:\u2014\n\nUnder the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency of Central India, the pargan\u00e1s of Agra, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Ujjain, Mandaser, and Nimach (Neemuch); under the Bh\u00edl or Bhop\u00e1w\u00e1r Agency, Amjhera (the extreme southern tract), Man\u00e1war, Dikth\u00e1n, Sagor, B\u00e1g, Biskaner, and Piplia. Previous to 1860, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Sindhia possessed territories south of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda); but in that year and in 1861, these were exchanged for lands of equal extent and value on the Sind and Betw\u00e1 rivers.\n\nThe area of the whole State, including Khani\u00e1-dh\u00e1na and Maks\u00fadan-garh, was returned by the Census of 1881 at 29,046 square miles, with a population of 3,115,857 persons, inhabiting 10,346 villages and towns, and 529,650 houses; number of persons per square mile, 107\u00b73; towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b735; houses per square mile, 18\u00b723; persons per house, 5\u00b788. No previous Census has ever been taken in the State.\nCentrally situated as the Gwalior State thus is in India as a whole, and strategically important on that account, as well as because of the famous natural fortress which it contains, its situation is not equally convenient relatively to the country now governed from it. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were a spreading, not a consolidating, nor even always an occupying power; and when the Gwalior fortress passed, for the third time in its history, into the possession of the Sindhias, under treaty with our Government in 1805, Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia and his predecessors had up to that time been nearly always in the field with their armies. But in 1805, the day had come when farther extensions of territory by conquest by native chiefs was to cease, and from then until now the Sindhias have only had to observe from Gwalior, their capital, the establishment of the power which has given fixed limits to the several Native States of India.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Gwalior District, as above defined, is the least raised of the three great plateaux into which Sindhia\u2019s territory is divisible; its general elevation towards the central and more depressed portion, in which the capital lies, falling considerably short of 1000 feet. The extreme north-eastern part of Gwalior, adjoining Agra, is generally level, of no great fertility, and much cut up by deep precipitous ravines in the vicinity of the streams. The upper country is dotted over with small isolated hills, which start abruptly out of the level plain. It has generally a stony and sterile aspect, being only slightly wooded; in some parts absolutely bare and rugged, and in others sparsely clothed with bab\u00fal, tamarind, and low brushwood. Considerable tracts, though sprinkled in some of the hilly parts (d\u00e1ngs) with forest, are fairly well covered in autumn with various species of grass, preserves of which, known as rakks and r\u00fands, are maintained to supply forage. The geological formation of the hills is a fine-grained sandstone, disposed in horizontal strata; this sandstone can be quarried to any extent, and is much employed for building purposes, as it can be hewn in slabs of great length and breadth. The extent to which stone takes the place of wood, not only in the roofs and walls, but even in the small interior fittings of houses and other buildings, forms one of the features of Gwalior. This stone is very easily wrought, and Gwalior workmen excel in carving it into designs of great beauty and delicacy for lattices, etc. The southern tracts of the State form a portion of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, a plateau having an average elevation of about 1500 feet, though there are some points rising greatly above that height, as in the instance of Shaizgarh, in the Mandu range, which is 2628 feet above the sea.\n\nThe State is watered by numerous rivers. By far the greater portion of the drainage of the Gwalior territory is discharged into the Chambal, which, receiving the waters of several minor tributaries, flows\nalong the north-west frontier, separating Gwalior from Jaipur (Jeypore), Karauli (Kerowlee), and Dholpur Native States. Subsequently turning south-east, it forms the north-eastern boundary towards Agra and Etawah, and joins the Jumna in the latter District. The Sind flows parallel with the Chambal, but farther to the east, and, after receiving the waters of the Mor\u00e1r, Parbatl, and Pab\u00faj, finally falls into the Jumna a short distance below the confluence of the Chambal with that river. The Kuw\u00e1ri, Asan, S\u00e1nkh, and other lesser streams, after flowing in a north-easterly and easterly direction, fall into the Sind close to its junction with the Jumna. The south-western and southern portion of Gwalior is noted for its abundant production of the M\u00e1lwa opium of commerce. Other products\u2014wheat, gram, pulses of various kinds, j\u00f3d\u00edr (Holcus sorghum), b\u00e1jra (Holcus spicatus), m\u00fag (Phaseolus mungo), maize, rice, linseed and other oil-seeds, garlic, turmeric, ginger, sugar-cane, indigo, \u00e1l (Morinda multiflora) yielding a fine red dye. Tobacco of excellent quality, but in no great quantity, is raised in the vicinity of Bhils\u00e1. Cotton is largely grown, and iron-ore, containing 75 per cent of metal, is raised and smelted in many places.\n\nTrade.\u2014The imports consist of British woollens, cottons, silks, cutlery, Cashmere shawls, pearls from the Persian Gulf, Ceylon diamonds, and agates from Bundelkhand, gold, silver, mercury, copper, lead, and zinc. Opium is the principal export, sent to the coast by way of Bombay. Cotton is also largely sent to Bombay, and to the towns on the Jumna and Ganges. The remaining exports of any importance are tobacco, dyes, and iron. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lwa State Railway passes through a portion of the territory of the Gwalior State on the west; while a railway on the broad gauge connects Gwalior town with Agra.\n\nClimate.\u2014In the dry and hot seasons the climate, though extremely trying, is not unhealthy, but during the rainy season fevers prevail, especially in the north. The range of the thermometer is small, except during the latter part of the year, when great and sudden changes often take place. During six months of the year, the mercury sometimes stands at about 100\u00b0 F. in the shade for long periods, without varying more than a few degrees day and night; the mean deviation being about $3\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 in twenty-four hours in September, and about $10\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 in February. The cool season comprises the period between the beginning of November and the end of February; the hot season succeeds, and continues to the middle of June, when the periodical rains set in, and last to the close of September, the average fall being between 30 and 40 inches. In 1875, the rainfall was 19'6 inches; in 1881, it was 33 inches. During the sultry season hot winds prevail; but they are of short duration, and though the thermometer rises to\nnearly 100\u00b0 during the day for long periods, the nights are frequently cool and refreshing.\n\nWild animals comprise the tiger, leopard, bear, wolf, hy\u00e6na, wild dog, jackal, fox, ounce, lynx, badger, ichneumon, civet, otter, rat, bat, mouse, wild hog, nilgai, various kinds of antelope and deer, buffalo, monkey, squirrel, porcupine, and hare. Of birds, there are the vulture, eagle, hawks of various kinds, kite, buzzard, owl, hornbill (Buceros), raven, crow, parrot, jay, cuckoo, humming-bird, wild goose, wild duck, pelican, cormorant, spoon-bill, stork, crane, heron, adjutant, curlew, snipe, bustard, florican, peafowl, pheasant, partridge, quail, pigeon, dove, and sparrow. The rivers abound in fish, especially of the carp kind. Of snakes, there are the boa, water-snake, cobra, black-spotted snake, spectacled snake, yellow-clouded snake, whip-snake, and leaping snake. The magar or blunt-snouted crocodile infests all the rivers.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the north-eastern part of the territory is essentially Hindu, and of a mixed kind, comprising, besides the ruling order of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Bundel\u00e1s, J\u00e1ts, and R\u00e1jputs, with other castes of Hindus and various tribes of Muhammadans. Until the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 inroads in the last century, the country was from an early period in the possession of the Muhammadan rulers of Delhi. In no part of Gwalior do the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s form any large proportion of the inhabitants, and according to the best information available, they do not number much more than 15,000; upwards of 10,000 of them are connected with the court or army (more especially the Paigah horse). In the greater part of the southern and south-western parts, comprising a portion of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, a very considerable section of the population is Hindu. There is perhaps no part of India where the tribes of the local or indigenous Br\u00e1hmans are so various and their numbers so great. They are all included by their Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquerors under the generic name of R\u00e1ngres, or rustics (said to come from ran, a forest, and garia, a man); though strong in numbers, they show little of the Br\u00e1hmanical character, either in point of piety, learning, or wealth. The total number of Br\u00e1hmans returned by the Census of 1881 for the whole State was 380,193. R\u00e1jputs exist in large numbers, and they are the most numerous and important of all Sindhi\u00e1's subjects. Their number in 1881 was returned at 422,267. Classified by religion, the Census of 1881 returns 2,768,385 Hindus, 167,320 Muhammadans, 12,230 Jains, 208 Christians, 198 Sikhs, and 167,516 aborigines. The Muhammadan population is about a nineteenth of the whole.\n\nThe total revenue of the State is estimated at \u00a31,200,000, including \u00a3783,890 derived from the land, and \u00a3147,020 from customs; the remainder consists of tributes from feudatories, and j\u00e1gir and local taxes. The customs revenue is realized from transit duties on iron, tobacco, and sugar, all other articles being free.\nNo transit duties are taken on those portions of the Agra and Bombay road or its branches which pass through the State, or on the roads connecting Gwalior with Etawah, Farukhabad, Datia, Jhansi, and Kalpi. Education is afforded by 92 schools, attended by 2767 pupils. The average attendance at the Lashkar College amounts to 548 persons. The present (1883) Prime Minister is Rao Raj Sir Ganpat Rao Kharke, K.C.S.I., who is assisted in the administration by 8 Naib Diwans, for the several departments of revenue, civil, criminal and police, appeal, military, karkhanaajat or matters specially pertaining to His Highness, foreign, and legislative. There are 16 courts of justice and 7423 police, including 3000 drilled police called ndjibs.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Gwalior family, whose armies and chiefs have played so conspicuous a part in the history of India, and whose representative now rules over a State larger than Scotland and Wales united, and richer than some independent kingdoms, was founded by the Maratha Ranoji Sindhia, who was the slipper-bearer of Balaji Peshwa at the beginning of the last century. His father was the hereditary patel (head-man) of a Deccan village. Once in the household of the Peshwa, Ranoji's rise was rapid, and he soon found himself at the head of the bodyguard. After leading many Maratha raids through Malwa into Hindustan, he was, at the time of his death, the acknowledged possessor of lands which still form part of the Gwalior State.\n\nRanoji was succeeded by his second son, Mahadaji Sindhia, whose ability as a statesman and a soldier has rarely been surpassed. Mahadaji was conspicuous for his gallantry at Panipat in 1761, being amongst the last to leave that field\u2014so disastrous to the Marathas. Probably the events of that fight led him to see the value of discipline, for when the Maratha tide of fortune again set in, there was a change of system. He turned his Maratha horse into disciplined infantry with sword and matchlock, and formed them into brigades; he paid great attention to his artillery, and placed his entire army under the command of French and English adventurers. Though nominally the servant of the Peshwa, he was practically independent, and made his State one of the strongest in India. The Delhi Emperor sought his protection; the Rajput chiefs, with hosts of the best cavalry India could produce, fought in vain against his battalions. He negotiated and guaranteed the treaty at Salbai (1783) between the Peshwa and the British Government.\n\nMahadaji was succeeded in 1794 by his grand-nephew, Daulat Rao Sindhia. During the distractions which followed the death of Madhu Rao Narayan Peshwa, Daulat Rao gained an ascendancy which enabled him to place Baji Rao in power, to usurp most of the possessions of Holkar, and to secure to himself the fortress of\nAhmadnagar in the Deccan, which gave him the entrance into the territories both of the Peshw\u00e1 and the Niz\u00e1m. The power of Daulat R\u00e1o, whose army was commanded by French officers, had now become dangerous to the British Government. When by the treaty of Bassein the British Government recovered its influence at Poona by the establishment of a subsidiary force, Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia entered into a league with Raghuji Bhonsla, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ber\u00e1r, to defeat the objects of the treaty; and the allied chiefs in 1803 invaded the territory of the Niz\u00e1m, which was at that time under the protection of the East India Company. On the 23rd of September in that year, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army was attacked at Assaye by a British force of about an eighth of its number, commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley, subsequently Duke of Wellington, and, after a prolonged and fiercely-contested battle, was totally defeated. The overthrow of Sindhia's military resources in the Deccan was completed by the defeat which the confederated Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s received from Sir Arthur Wellesley at Arg\u00e1um, in Ber\u00e1r, on the 28th of November 1803.\n\nThe destruction of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power to the north of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) had in the meantime been not less signally effected by General (afterwards Lord) Lake, the British commander-in-chief, who in the beginning of September 1803 stormed Al\u00edgarh; and a few days afterwards, nearly opposite Delhi, totally defeated Sindhia's disciplined army, commanded by the Frenchman Bourquin, and effectually cleared the Do\u00e1b of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Delhi was immediately occupied by the victorious army. Before the close of the same year, Agra also yielded after a brief attempt at defence. General Lake, indefatigably following up his advantages, a few weeks afterwards destroyed the remnant of Sindhia's disciplined force at Lasw\u00e1ri (Laswaree). The power of Daulat R\u00e1o being thus completely broken, he was compelled to sue for peace, and to sign the treaty of Sarji Anjang\u00e1on, by which he resigned his conquered territories in Hindust\u00e1n and south of the Ajanta Hills, with the exception of some hereditary villages. The discontent which Daulat R\u00e1o felt at the determination to deprive him of Gohad and Gwalior, under this treaty, induced him to enter into a correspondence with Holkar, which nearly led to a fresh rupture with the British. Among other acts of hostility, he attacked and plundered the Resident's camp, and detained the Resident a prisoner. The change, however, in the policy of Government on the arrival of Lord Cornwallis, who, independently of any reference to the settlement of differences with Sindhia, deemed it inexpedient to retain possession of Gohad and Gwalior, led to the renewal of negotiations on the basis of the restoration of these territories.\n\nA treaty was accordingly concluded on 22nd November 1805, which confirmed the treaty of Sarji Anjang\u00e1on in part, but ceded Gwalior and Gohad to Sindhia, and constituted the Chambal the northern boundary\nof his territory; the British Government bound itself not to make treaties with Udaipur (Oodeypore), Jodhpur, Kotah, or any chiefs tributary to Sindhia in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Mew\u00e1r, or M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, or to interfere in any arrangements he might make regarding them. Daulat R\u00e1o so highly appreciated the advantages arising from the strength of the fort of Gwalior, that he fixed his residence in a permanent camp at the base of the rock, and since that time it has always been considered the capital of the State, to which it has also given its name.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Pind\u00e1ri war in 1817, the plundering hordes who had been generally hangers-on to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 camps during their campaigns in the latter half of the 18th century looked for support to Sindhia, as the most powerful of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 princes. Daulat R\u00e1o was also subjected to strong solicitations from the Peshw\u00e1, who was endeavouring to resuscitate the old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy. But the Marquis of Hastings, then Governor-General, promptly advanced with a formidable army to the river Chambal, and so far overawed Sindhia that a treaty was executed abrogating the article of the treaty of 1805 which restrained the British Government from forming engagements with the R\u00e1jput States, and binding Sindhia to co-operate with the British against the Pind\u00e1ris, and also to give up the forts of As\u00edrgarh and Hindia for three years as a security for the lines of communication, and as a guarantee for the performance of his engagements. The fortress of As\u00edrgarh was not, however, surrendered, and it became necessary to occupy it by force. In the captured fort a letter was found, in which Sindhia directed the governor to obey all orders of the Peshw\u00e1, who, by attacking the Residency at Poona, had declared war with the British Government. In consequence of this want of good faith, Sindhia was required permanently to cede the fort of As\u00edrgarh.\n\nDaulat R\u00e1o died at Gwalior in 1827 without an heir, and without having adopted a successor. On his death-bed, he left the State and succession in the hands of the British Government, indicating a wish that his younger widow, Baiza B\u00e1\u00ed, might be treated with consideration. The death of Daulat R\u00e1o was followed by internal discord throughout the State. The succession of a boy of Sindhia\u2019s family, M\u00fagat R\u00e1o, to whom it was thought the wishes of Daulat R\u00e1o turned, was admitted by the British Government, under the regency of Baiza B\u00e1\u00ed. The young Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 was subsequently married to the grand-daughter of Daulat R\u00e1o and Baiza B\u00e1\u00ed. He took the name of Jhankuj\u00ed Sindhia. But Baiza B\u00e1\u00ed\u2019s regency came to a sudden collapse in 1833. Jealous of power and headstrong, her treatment of the young chief at last became intolerable, and he broke away from her, supported by a large portion of the troops, who now found themselves masters of the situation. The wealth of Baiza B\u00e1\u00ed was enormous, and it was used for intrigue and dissension without scruple, until it became necessary to\nremove her from Gwalior. During the whole of the reign of Jhankuj\u00ed, although the State was at complete peace with external foes, there was constant turbulence within the borders. Jhankuj\u00ed Sindhia died in 1843, without issue, and without having expressed any wish in regard to the succession, though repeatedly urged to do so by the Resident. His widow, with the concurrence of the chief nobles, adopted Baghirat R\u00e1o, a lad eight years of age, belonging to a distant branch of the Sindhia family.\n\nThe British Government recognised the adoption, and Baghirat R\u00e1o, under the name of Jai\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Sindhia, succeeded. Early in the regency, disturbances took place, and the advance of British troops on Gwalior became necessary to restore order. This, however, was not effected without hard fighting. Two battles, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jpur and Panni\u00e1r (Punneah), were fought on the same day\u2014the 29th December 1843\u2014between the British forces and the mutinous army. They both resulted in the total defeat of the insurgent troops. The young chief was replaced in power by the British Government. The Gwalior army was disbanded, and the force was reduced to a fixed number\u20145000 cavalry, 3000 infantry, and 32 guns. Indemnity was taken for the war expenses, and an annual provision of \u00a3180,000 assigned to the British Government for the maintenance of a force to preserve order. Thus matters continued till the Mutiny of 1857, when the Gwalior contingent and Sindhia's army again revolted. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, then but a youth, displayed courage and unswerving loyalty to the British Government. In June 1858 he was deserted by his troops on the approach of the rebels under T\u00e1ntia Top\u00ed, and he and his minister, Dinkar R\u00e1o, were compelled to flee to Agra. On the 19th June, Gwalior was retaken by Sir Hugh Rose's force, and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 was re-established in his palace. In recognition of his services, the Government conferred upon him the right of adoption, together with lands yielding a revenue of \u00a330,000, and permitted an increase to his army, which now stands at 48 guns, 6000 cavalry, and 5000 infantry.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 is an honorary general in the British army, a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath, Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India, and a Companion of the Indian Empire. On the Gwalior Seal of State are engraved the following titles, which, with the name of the ruling chief in the middle of them, are hereditary with the Sindhias\u2014Mukht\u00e1r-ul-Mulk, 'master of the country;' Azim-ul-Ikhtid\u00e1r, 'great in power;' Rafi-us-Sh\u00e1n, 'high in prestige;' W\u00e1l\u00e1-Sh\u00edkuh, 'exalted in majesty;' Mutasham-i-Daur\u00e1n, 'the great man of the age;' Undat-ul-Umara, 'pillar of the nobles;' Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, 'the great R\u00e1j\u00e1;' Dh\u00edr\u00e1j, 'r\u00e1j\u00e1 of r\u00e1j\u00e1s;' Alijah, 'the high of place;' Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ji\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Sindhia Bahadur; Sr\u00edn\u00e1th Mand\u00far-i-Zam\u00e1n, 'the victorious of the period;' Fideoi-i-Hazrat, Malika, Muazzama, Rafi-ud-darjih, Inglist\u00e1w,\n1863, 'Vassal of Her Majesty the honoured and exalted Queen of England, 1863.' The old flag of the Sindhias, so well known on Indian battle-fields, was of the orange or brick-red colour called *bgagwa*, with the representation of a serpent on it; after a fable that a cobra once sheltered the founder of the family with its hood, as he lay asleep in the sun. In 1862, however, a kind of Union Jack was adopted in lieu of, or in addition to, the old banner, having two patches of orange on it, with the figure of the serpent on each patch. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 is entitled permanently to a salute of 19 guns in British territory, but to a salute of 21 guns in his own territory. The present Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 enjoys a personal salute of 21 guns in British territory also.\n\n**Gwalior.**\u2014The capital of **Gwalior State**, and residence of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 Sindhia; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 13' N., and long. 78\u00b0 12' E., 65 miles south from Agra, and 277 north-west of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. In the absence of new materials, this article has been compiled partly from Thornton (1862) and Fergusson (*History of Indian Architecture*, 1876).\n\nGwalior city has a threefold interest. First, as a very ancient seat of Jain worship; second, for its example of palace architecture of the best Hindu period (1486\u20131516); third, as the fortress capital of one of the greatest native chiefs of India. A considerable British force is posted in its immediate neighbourhood; but this aspect will be treated of in a separate article on the Morar Cantonments. The fort of Gwalior stands on an isolated rock of ochreous sandstone formation, capped at places with basalt. The face of the fort is perpendicular, and where the rock is naturally less precipitous it has been scarped, and in some portions the upper parts overhang the lower. Its greatest length from north-east to south-west is a mile and a half, and the greatest breadth, 300 yards. The rock at the northern end attains its maximum height of 342 feet. On its eastern side are sculptured several colossal figures in bold relief. A rampart accessible by a steep road, and farther up by huge steps cut out of the rock, surrounds the fort. This vast staircase, the principal entrance of which is known as the 'Elephant's' Gate, from the figure of that animal being sculptured above it, is protected on the outer side by a massive stone wall, and is swept by guns. The citadel stands at the north-eastern corner of the enclosure, and presents a very picturesque appearance. The old town of Gwalior, which is of considerable size, but irregularly built, and extremely dirty, lies at the eastern base of the rock. It contains the tomb of Muhammad Ghaus, which was erected during the early part of Akbar's reign. Fergusson thus describes the building:\u2014'It is a square measuring 100 feet each way, exclusive of the hexagonal towers, which are attached to the angles. The chamber of the tomb itself is a hall 43 feet square, with the angles cut off by pointed\narches, so as to form an octagon, on which the dome rests. Around this square building is a gallery, 20 feet wide between the piers, enclosed on all sides by a screen of the most exquisite tracery in pierced stonework, with a projecting porch on each face.'\n\nJain Remains.\u2014There are two remarkable Hindu temples in Gwalior. 'One,' says Mr. Fergusson, 'known as the Sas B\u00e1hu, is understood to be a Jain erection, and seems to be so designated and dedicated to Padman\u00e1th, the sixth Tirthankara. General Cunningham doubts this ascription, in consequence of the walls being adorned with bas-reliefs, belonging certainly to the Vaishnav and Siva sects. This temple was finished apparently in A.D. 1093, and, though dreadfully ruined, is still a most picturesque fragment. What remains is the cruciform porch of a temple which, when complete, measured 100 feet from front to rear, and 63 feet across the arms of the porch. Of the sanctuary, with its sikra, nothing is left but the foundation; but the porch, which is three storeys in height, is constructively entire, though its details \u2014 and principally those of its roof\u2014are very much shattered. An older Jain temple is described by General Cunningham; but as it was used as a mosque it is more likely that it is a Muhammadan building, although made up of Jain details.' Another temple in the fortress of Gwalior is called the Telh-ka-Mandir or 'Oilman's Temple.' It is 60 feet square, with a portico on the east projecting about 11 feet, and terminates in a ridge of about 30 feet in extent. 'The building,' says Mr. Fergusson, 'was originally dedicated to Vishnu, but afterwards converted to the worship of Siva. There is no inscription or any tradition from which its date can be gathered, but on the whole I am inclined to place it in the 10th or 11th century.'\n\nThe most striking part of the Jain remains at Gwalior is a series of caves or rock-cut sculptures excavated in the rock on all sides, which number, when taken together, hardly less than a hundred, great and small. Most of them are mere niches to contain statues, though some are cells that may have been originally intended for residences. One curious fact regarding them is, that, according to inscriptions, they were all excavated within the short period of about thirty-three years, between A.D. 1441 and A.D. 1474. Some of the figures are of colossal size; one, for instance, is 57 feet high, which is greater than any other in the north of India.\n\nHindu Palace-Architecture.\u2014The palace built by M\u00e1n Singh (A.D. 1486\u20131516) forms the most interesting example of early Hindu work in India. Its external dimensions, according to Mr. Fergusson, are 300 feet by 160 feet; and on the east side it is 100 feet high, having two underground storeys looking over the country. On all its faces the flat surface is relieved by tall towers of singularly pleasing design, crowned by cupolas covered with domes of gilt copper\nwhen B\u00e1bar saw them in 1527. M\u00e1n Singh's successor, Vikram\u00e1ditya, added another palace, of even greater extent, to this one in 1516; and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n added palaces to these two,\u2014the whole making up a group of edifices unequalled for picturesqueness and interest by anything of their class that exists in Central India. Among the apartments in the palace was one called the B\u00e1radd\u00e1ri, supported on 12 columns, and 45 feet square, with a stone roof, which was one of the most beautiful apartments of its class anywhere to be found. It was, besides, singularly interesting from the expedients to which the Hindu architect was forced to resort to imitate the vaults of the Moslems. They had not then learned to copy them, as they did at the end of that century at Bindr\u00e1ban and elsewhere under the guidance of the tolerant Akbar. Of the buildings, however, which so excited the admiration of the Emperor B\u00e1bar, probably little now remains. The Moslems added to the palaces of the Hindus, and spared their temples and the statues of the Jains.\n\nRock Fortress.\u2014According to Wilford, the fort of Gwalior was built in 773 by Surya Sen, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the neighbouring country. In 1023, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed; in 1196, it was captured by Mahm\u00fad Ghori; in 1211, it was lost by the Musalm\u00e1ns, but recovered in 1231, after a blockade of a year, by Shams-ud-d\u00edn Altamsh, the Slave King of Delhi. Narsinh R\u00e1i, a Hindu chief, taking advantage of the trouble produced by the invasion of Tamerlane in 1398, seized Gwalior, which was not regained by the Musalm\u00e1ns until 1519, under Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lod\u00ed, the Path\u00e1n monarch of Delhi. In 1526, B\u00e1bar took the fortress by stratagem; and in 1543, after the expulsion of his son Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, it fell into the hands of his rival, Sher Sh\u00e1h; but after the re-establishment of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, Gwalior was, in 1556, recovered by his successor Akbar, who made it a state prison for captives of rank. In the dismemberment of the Delhi Empire, Gwalior was seized by the J\u00e1t R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gohad. Subsequently it was garrisoned by Sindhia, from whom it was wrested in 1780 by the forces of the East India Company. Transferred by the British Government to the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gohad, Gwalior was, in 1784, recovered by Mah\u00e1dhaj\u00ed Sindhia, from whose successor, Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia (1794\u20131827), it was taken in 1803, but restored again in 1805.\n\nAfter Daulat R\u00e1o's death in 1827, his widow governed as guardian of her adopted son, Jhankuj\u00ed, till 1833, when he assumed the Government. Jhankuj\u00ed died in 1843 without an heir. A contest took place between his uncle and the adopted relative of his widow. A revolution was impending, and the Government decided to interfere. Our troops crossed the Chambal, and unexpectedly found the forces of Gwalior drawn up at Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jpur, a few miles distant from the fortress. A battle ensued on the 29th December 1843, resulting in the complete overthrow of the\nMar\u00e1th\u00e1s. On the same day, another victory was gained by the British troops at Panni\u00e1r (Punneah). The British contingent stationed in the town was increased, and affairs were placed on a peaceful footing. The last event of historical importance was the revolt of the Gwalior contingent in October 1857.\n\nThe population of the new town called Lashk\u00e1r, where the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 resides, was returned in 1881 at 88,066, namely, 70,742 Hindus, 17,135 Muhammadans, and 189 'others.' Lashk\u00e1r has a charitable dispensary, a new jail, and post-office, and is connected with the Gwalior railway station by a new metalled road. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 has recently established a paper mill, which is now at work.\u2014See Gwalior State.\n\nGw\u00e1rich.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Gonda District, Oudh.\u2014See Guwarich.\n\nGwe-chyo.\u2014River in the north of Prome District, Pegu Division, British Burma. It rises in the Padauk spur, 20 miles west of the main range of the Pegu Yomas; after a south-westerly course, it joins the Nawin by the same mouth as the In-gon and Chaung-sauk. Near its source the bed is rocky, but lower down, sandy and muddy; it is unnavigable. The trees most common on its banks are in and htien (Nauclea sp.).\n\nGyaing.\u2014River in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. It is formed by the junction of the Hlaing-bwai and Haungtharaw near Gyaing village, in lat. 16\u00b0 34' N., and long. 98\u00b0 3' E. The united waters flow west for 45 miles, and fall into the Salwin at Maulmain. The Gyaing is a broad but shallow river, containing numerous sandbanks; it is navigable by boats all the year round. The most important places on the banks are\u2014Kado, at the mouth, the Government timber-revenue station; Zatha-byin; Tarana; and Dammatha.\n\nGyaing Attaran.\u2014Township in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; situated between 15\u00b0 59' and 16\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 97\u00b0 41' and 97\u00b0 55' E. long. It occupies the valley of the Attaran river, and extends from the hills forming its southern boundary northwards to the Gyaing. Above the junction of the Zam\u00ed and Winraw, which unite to form the Attaran, are large tracts of valuable forest land. The timber can only be felled by licence. Teak was formerly very plentiful, but the supply has diminished considerably, owing to the indiscriminate felling in the first years after the British occupation. (See Amherst District.) The head-quarters of the township are at Nga-bye-ma (population in 1881, 267), on the Attaran. A few miles above is Yebaw, famed for its hot springs. Gyaing Attaran is divided into 15 circles. Population (1881) 27,790; gross revenue, \u00a35947.\n\nGyaing-than-lwin.\u2014Division of Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; situated between 16\u00b0 33' and 16\u00b0 56' N. lat.,\nand between $97^\\circ 38'$ and $98^\\circ 0'$ E. long. The three chief rivers are the Salw\u00edn, the Hlaing-bwai, and the Gyaing, with their tributaries. In the west and south-west, the country consists of an extensive plain traversed by parallel ridges of limestone rocks, having a general north and south direction, with intervening narrow and cultivated valleys. Portions of this tract are occasionally inundated by the Salw\u00edn. In the east and north-east of the township there is a series of low laterite hills, open bamboo forests, and small low-lying grassy plains. The southern part is a long, narrow rice-producing area. In the more hilly portion, where water and fodder are plentiful all the year round, cattle are extensively bred, and are sold to purchasers who come from Tha-tun and Pegu, and other places west of the Sittaung. Cattle are also imported by the Shans; the chief export is rice. Gyaing-than-lwin contains 16 revenue circles; the head-quarters station is Za-tha-byin. Population (1881) 47,901; revenue, \u00a313,070.\n\nH.\n\nHab.\u2014River on the western frontier of Sind, Bombay Presidency, and for some distance the boundary between British territory and Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n. It rises in Khel\u00e1t (lat. $26^\\circ 22' 30''$ N., long. $67^\\circ 16'$ E.), flows south-east for 25 miles, then due south for 50 miles, and then south-west, till it falls into the Arabian Sea, in lat. $24^\\circ 52'$ N., long. $66^\\circ 42'$ E., after a total length of about 100 miles. Except the Indus, it is the only permanent river in Sind. It abounds in fish. A proposal to supply Kar\u00e1ch\u00e9\u00ed (Kurrachee) with drinking water from the Hab was put before the Bombay Government in 1867; but a scheme for bringing water from the Maler river was subsequently sanctioned, and the latter work will soon be completed.\n\nHabiganj.\u2014Sub-division of Sylhet District, Assam, consisting of the four police circles (th\u00e1nds) of Habiganj, Nabiganj, Madhabpur, and Bani\u00e1chang. Area, 971 square miles; villages, 2495; houses, 98,196. Total population (1872) 455,009; (1881) 482,051, showing an increase of 27,042, or 5.94 per cent., in nine years. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 235,955; Muhammadans, 246,089; and 'others,' 16.\n\nHabiganj.\u2014Large b\u00e1\u015b\u00e1r in the south-west of Sylhet District, Assam, on what was once the main stream of the Bar\u00e1k river, and the headquarters of Habiganj Sub-division. It is situated on the southern edge of the inundated tract which fills the west centre of the Surm\u00e1 valley, and on the northern edge of the fertile valley of the Khsai river. It stands, as do all the other villages of the inundated tract, on an artificial mound. A busy fleet of cargo boats loads and unloads at the\nvery door of the merchants' warehouses. It is an important centre of trade. Population (1881) 4061, namely, Hindus, 3257; Muhammadans, 803; 'others,' 1. In 1881-82, the imports from Bengal by country boats were valued at \u00a352,000, chiefly consisting of salt, tobacco, and European piece-goods. The exports, chiefly rice, were valued at \u00a330,000.\n\nH\u00e1bra.\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal; situated on the Til\u00e1i river, a tributary of the Jamun\u00e1. Lat. 25\u00b0 36' 3\" N., long. 88\u00b0 57' 50\" E. Large river mart, trading in rice, tobacco, gunny-cloth, sugar, jute, etc.\n\nHadarn\u00e1ru.\u2014Village in Mysore District, Mysore State. Population (1881) 1643. It formed the scene of a chivalrous story of the 14th century, and is regarded as the cradle of the present ruling family.\n\nH\u00e1fiz\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Southern tahsil of G\u00fajr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 32' and 32\u00b0 20' 30\" N. lat.; and between 73\u00b0 11' 30\" and 74\u00b0 7' 15\" E. long.; consisting for the most part of a dry and uncultivated upland plain. Area, 1362 square miles; area under cultivation, 202,372 acres. Population (1868) 176,986; (1881) 196,604, namely, males 107,451, and females 89,153; average density, 144 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Muhammadans, 154,368; Hindus, 31,325; Sikhs, 10,905; 'others,' 6. Revenue of the tahsil in 1882-83, \u00a316,774. The administrative staff consisted of a tahsild\u00e1r, a munsif, and an honorary magistrate, presiding over 3 civil and 2 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 4; strength of regular police, 85 men; village watchmen (cha\u00fakt\u00e1rs), 441.\n\nH\u00e1fiz\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in G\u00fajr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District, Punjab, and head-quarters of the H\u00e1fiz\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil. Distant from G\u00fajr\u00e1nw\u00e1la 32 miles west; formerly a place of great importance, and mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as head-quarters of a mahal, but now only important as being the sub-divisional head-quarters. Founded by Hafiz, a favourite of the Emperor Akbar. Population (1881) 2453, namely, Hindus, 1317; Muhammadans, 994; and Sikhs, 142; number of houses, 380. The town contains, besides the official courts and offices, a s\u00e1rd\u00ed or native inn, with a good European rest-house attached to it; a th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle; and a vernacular middle-class school.\n\nHaggr\u00ed.\u2014River in the Madras Presidency.\u2014See Hugri.\n\nHai\u00e1tpur.\u2014Town in Maldah District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the Ganges. Lat. 25\u00b0 16' 20\" N., long. 87\u00b0 54' 21\" E. The town occupies an important situation at the spot where the waters of the Ganges have effected a junction with the K\u00e1lindr\u00ed, and is the largest river mart in the District. It lost a good deal of its trade some years ago, when the main stream of the Ganges shifted its channel several miles from the town; but the stream has recently returned to its old bed, and commerce has revived and restored the importance of the place.\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad, or the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions).\u2014A Native State or feudatory kingdom, roughly co-extensive with the Deccan (Dakshin) or central plateau of Southern India, which takes its name from its capital, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d City. \u2018The form of the territory, inclusive of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Assigned Districts, known as Ber\u00e1r, is that of a trapezium. Its base is about 420 miles in a direction from north-east to south-west, from Hamp\u00e1s\u00e1g\u00e1r in lat. 15\u00b0 10\u2032 N., long. 76\u00b0 5\u2032 E., to Maripad in lat. 17\u00b0 20\u2032 N., long. 81\u00b0 22\u2032 E.; its north-eastern side extends from south-east to north-west a distance of 390 miles, from Maripad, above mentioned, to Melgh\u00e1t in lat. 21\u00b0 41\u2032 N., long. 77\u00b0 15\u2032 E.; its north-western, in a direction from north-east to south-west, a distance of 220 miles from Melgh\u00e1t, as above, to Ph\u00faltamba, lat. 19\u00b0 47\u2032 N., long. 74\u00b0 40\u2032 E.; and the south-western, a distance of 330 miles from Ph\u00faltamba to Hamp\u00e1s\u00e1g\u00e1r. Though such is the general outline of the country, the boundaries are marked by numerous sinuosities, causing them to deviate greatly from right lines. The territory lies between lat. 15\u00b0 10\u2032 to 21\u00b0 46\u2032 N., including the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Assigned Districts, or Ber\u00e1r, and long. 74\u00b0 35\u2032 to 81\u00b0 25\u2032 E. Excluding Ber\u00e1r, the extreme northern part of the State reaches the parallel of 20\u00b0 4\u2032. It is 475 miles in length from south-west to north-east, and about the same distance in breadth.\u2019 The area of Ber\u00e1r, or the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Assigned Districts, is 17,711 square miles, that of the remaining portion of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions is estimated at about 80,000 square miles; the total area of the whole State being thus about 98,000 square miles. \u2018It is bounded on the north and north-east by the Central Provinces; on the south and south-east by territory subject to the Presidency of Madras; on the west and north-west by territory subject to the Presidency of Bombay. Within the western part are some small isolated British possessions.\u2019 Excluding the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Assigned Districts, or Ber\u00e1r, the Districts comprising the Native State of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d are, in the Eastern Division, Kamamet, Nalgonda, and Nagar Karn\u00fal; in the Northern Division, Mehdak, Indor, Yelgandal, and Sirpur Tand\u00far; in the Western Division, B\u00edd\u00e1r, Nander, and Naldrug; in the Southern Division, Raichor, Lingsagar, Shor\u00e1pur, and Gulbargah; and in the North-west Division, Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bh\u00edr, and Parbaini; while the capital Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, with its suburbs, forms the City District.\n\nIn this article the passages within inverted commas are from an article prepared by Mr. Edward Thornton under the directions of the East India Company.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014\u2018Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is a tract of considerable elevation, averaging 1250 feet above the level of the sea, and some granite summits attain a height of 2500 feet. The elevation of the fort of Golconda, near the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, has been ascertained to be 2024 feet above sea-level. With the exception of the valley of the T\u00e1pti at the northern\nextremity of the territory, which is bounded on the north by the Vindhya range and on the south by the high land of the God\u00e1vari, the whole drainage of the country is either from west to east or from north-west to south-east, discharging into the Bay of Bengal by the channels of the God\u00e1vari and the Kistna. The drainage of the valley of the T\u00e1pti, flowing westward, falls into the Gulf of Cambay.' This wide expanse of country presents much variety of surface and feature. In some parts it is mountainous, wooded, and picturesque; in others, flat or undulating. The champaign lands are of all descriptions, including many rich and fertile plains, much good land not yet brought under cultivation, and numerous tracts too sterile ever to be cultivated at all.\n\nThe most important mountain ranges running through the State are\u2014the Bal\u00e1gh\u00e1t range, running east and west from the t\u00e1luk of Biloli in the Indor District to the t\u00e1luk of Ashti in the B\u00edrh District, a distance of 200 miles within the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory; the Sabi\u00e1dri range, running from the District of Indor to the Assigned Districts of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and on to Kh\u00e1ndesh in the Bombay Presidency. The entire length of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds within the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s State is about 250 miles, of which a length of about 100 miles is called the Ajanta Gh\u00e1t range. The Gawalgarh range runs east and west in Ber\u00e1r for about 64 miles, and the J\u00e1lna range runs for a length of 120 miles from Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d eastward in the direction of J\u00e1lna.\n\n'The geological formations are on a large scale; in the north-west being of the great volcanic formation extending through the greater part of the Deccan, consisting principally of trap, but in some parts basalt. In the middle, southern, and south-western parts, the greater part of the country is overlaid with gneissic formations. In the north-east, along the right bank of the God\u00e1vari, there is much sandstone, some of it carboniferous.' Near the junction of the Pengang\u00e1 with the Wardh\u00e1, and in the valley of the latter river, there are coal-fields. Those which have been examined over a small area near Sasti and P\u00e1oni show an average of 40 feet in thickness. The quality of the coal hitherto mined is inferior to that of R\u00e1niganj, but good enough for railway purposes. Iron-ore is found in the same neighbourhood, also limestone and kankar, or nodular limestone, at Kamaram in the extreme east; and 100 miles north-east of Ellore there is another small coal-field. At Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, near the junction of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway with the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s State Railway, are quarries of excellent limestone, which are extensively worked for a considerable distance along the line of the latter railway. The stone found is of two colours, grey and black, and takes a polish almost equal to marble. It is now imported into Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city, and exported elsewhere in large quantities for building purposes, for which it is well suited from its regular cleavage and the ease with which it can be worked.\nRivers.\u2014The Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory is, on the whole, well watered, rivers being numerous, while tanks or artificial pieces of water also abound. The God\u00e1vari, rising on the eastern declivity of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, near N\u00e1sik in the British District of that name, takes a course south-east for about 90 miles to Ph\u00faltamba, where it first touches on this territory, and continues to flow along the border south-eastward for 70 miles to M\u00fangi, in lat. $19^\\circ 27'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 30'$ E. Here it enters Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, through which it holds a course nearly easterly for about 160 miles, to the vicinity of Lasona, in lat. $19^\\circ 7'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 5'$ E. At that place, it receives on the left side the Dudna river, which flows from the north-east and has a considerable stream after its junction with the Purna river. About 85 miles lower down, in lat. $18^\\circ 48'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 55'$ E., it receives on the right side the Manj\u00edra. It thence continues to hold a course generally easterly for about 190 miles, to Kulaisar, in lat. $18^\\circ 52'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 53'$ E., where, on the left, it receives the Pranh\u00edta, a large river from the north. After the confluence, turning south-east, it flows for about 155 miles in that direction along the south-western base of the mountains of Bast\u00e1r to Kott\u00far, in lat. $17^\\circ 29'$ N., long. $81^\\circ 29'$ E., where it passes into God\u00e1vari District of the Madras Presidency. Below Kulaisar, it forms the north-eastern boundary of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory. Thus the total length of this great river, along the border and through the territory, is about 600 miles, for above 200 of which it is navigable from June to February. The Wardh\u00e1, rising in the hills of Bet\u00fal and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Districts of the Central Provinces, flows south-west for a few miles, and first touching on this territory at Gudra, in lat. $21^\\circ 35'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 25'$ E., thence flows towards the south-east 170 miles towards Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. In lat. $19^\\circ 55'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 15'$ E., it receives on the right side the Pengang\u00e1, a large river from the west, which for the greater part of its course forms the boundary between East Ber\u00e1r and the more southern portions of the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions. After the junction with the Pengang\u00e1, the Wardh\u00e1 continues to flow in a south-easterly direction for 60 miles, and in lat. $19^\\circ 37'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 15'$ E., on the left bank receives the Waingang\u00e1, from the north. Below the confluence, the united stream, now called the Pranh\u00edta, flows in a tortuous direction, but generally south, for about 80 miles to Kulaisar, in lat. $18^\\circ 52'$ N., long. $69^\\circ 53'$ E. This stream, through nearly its whole length, whether denominated the Wardh\u00e1 or the Pranh\u00edta, marks the boundary between this territory and the Central Provinces. It is navigable for about 170 miles.\n\nThe Kistna or Krishna, rising near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, holds a course south-east for about 320 miles to lat. $16^\\circ 10'$ N., long. $76^\\circ 18'$ E., where it touches, and 10 miles farther passes into, this territory, through which it flows in a direction generally\nnorth-east for about 75 miles to Kadlur in lat. $16^\\circ 24'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 20'$ E., where on the left bank it receives the Bhima from the north-west, and is soon after spanned by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway bridge. From near this point the river, turning south-east, flows 80 miles in that direction to its confluence with the Tungabhadra in lat. $15^\\circ 58'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 19'$ E., where it turns north-east and flows 180 miles to lat. $16^\\circ 50'$ N., long. $80^\\circ 10'$ E., at which point it passes into Kistna (Krishna) District of the Madras Presidency. From the confluence to the point last named, it forms part of the south-eastern boundary of Haidarabad territory. Thus its total length of course connected with this territory is 345 miles; but in consequence of the ruggedness of its bed, it is of little use for navigation. The Tungabhadra, formed by the junction of the rivers Tunga and Bhadra in Mysore, flows north-eastward, and at Mudlapur, in lat. $15^\\circ 8'$ N., long. $76^\\circ 1'$ E., first touches this territory, along the south-eastern boundary of which it flows, separating it from the Madras Districts of Bellary and Karnul (Kurnool) for a distance of 200 miles, to its confluence with the Kistna. Many other streams (considerable rivers during the periodical rains, but much reduced in volume at other times of the year) discharge into these main channels of drainage. Tanks for irrigation are, as before observed, numerous, and some of them are of very great size, as that at Pakhal, which is at least 30 miles in circuit. The bandh or dam of this tank is about 2000 yards in length. When full of water, the depth at the sluice is 36 feet. These tanks are generally formed by throwing an embankment across the lower end of a valley, and thus causing the accumulation of the water of such streams as may flow into it. The total number of tanks in the State is about 18,200.\n\nThe climate may be considered as in general good; and as there are no arid, bare deserts, similar to those of Rajputana and some other tracts of Northern India, the hot winds are less felt. In the vicinity of the city of Haidarabad, the mean temperature in-doors, according to observations made at sunrise, at two o'clock in the afternoon, and at sunset, for one year, was\u2014in January, $74\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 F.; February, $76\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0; March, $84$\u00b0; April, $91\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0; May, $93$\u00b0; June, $88$\u00b0; July, $81$\u00b0; August, $80\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0; September, $79$\u00b0; October, $80$\u00b0; November, $76\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0; and December, $74\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0; giving as an annual mean $81\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0. Ophthalmic diseases are prevalent in the sandstone district. The wells in general yield impure, unpalatable water, productive of disease, especially the dracunculus or guinea-worm, from which those who use the water from tanks or streams are exempt.\n\nThe annual fall of rain is estimated at from 28 to 32 inches at Haidarabad; this occurs principally during the south-west monsoon between June and October. In the north-west monsoon there is a fall of only 4 to 7 inches. In 1881, the total rainfall was 29.6 inches.\nThe winds are generally westerly in June, July, August, and September; during October, November, December, January, and February they blow from the east; and in March, April, and May north-westerly breezes are frequent.\n\n**Animals.**\u2014Horses adapted for military or general purposes are not reared in the same number as formerly in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions. The chief mart for Deccan-bred horses is a fair at Maleg\u00e1on in B\u00edd\u00e1r District, about 160 miles from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and 200 from Poona. There is also a horse b\u00e1\u00e1s\u00e1r near the capital, which is open throughout the year, and is resorted to by merchants from almost every quarter of Asia, with strings of elephants, horses, and camels.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The soil is in general fertile, though in some parts it consists of chilka, a red and gritty mould, little fitted, from the coarseness of its particles, for agriculture. Resembling this, but composed of particles more minute, is lal-sam\u00edn, a soil also of a reddish hue, and considered by Walker to be formed of the remains of broken-down ant-hills, which are surprisingly numerous in this country. \u201cThus,\u201d observes the writer just referred to, \u201cwe see that those insects, usually looked upon as troublesome and destructive pests, are not without their use in a grand natural operation. The peculiar acid (the formic), which is their chief constituent, acts upon the alkali and lime, and most probably on the silica of the rock debris, pulverizing it, and facilitating, in all probability, fresh combinations. The soil, when manured, is fitted for the reception of all kinds of crops without reference to season.\u201d Though less extensive than the kinds just enumerated, the reg\u00e1r or black cotton-soil occurs in many places, and is esteemed the best of any, and, as indicated by the epithet above applied to it, peculiarly suited for the cultivation of cotton. It requires no manure, except that left by sheep generally fed upon it when under fallow previous to cultivation. This is, however, an important resource, as flocks of sheep are everywhere to be seen. There is also a soil denominated taldo-ka-sam\u00edn, a black earth, dug from the bottoms of tanks; but not much prized, being a stiff clay and containing a profusion of small fresh-water shells. Its extreme tenacity is found unfavourable to vegetation, which is still further thwarted by a large impregnation of carbonate of soda. This, however, is collected in great quantities for manufacturing and commercial purposes. All those soils effervesce with acids, thereby indicating that they contain carbonate of lime. Throughout this territory the ground, wherever left uncultivated, even but for a year or two, becomes covered with a low jungle, composed chiefly of the Cassia auriculata and Zizyphus microphylla. In process of time, the appearance of the jungle is enlivened by the growth of numerous trees, of which the principal are Butea frondosa, Bombax heptaphyllum, Erythrina indica, Hyperanthera\nHAIDARABAD.\n\nmoringa, Cassia fistula, Anona reticulata, Melia azadirachta, Bauhinia parviflora, Capparis trifolia, Ficus indica, Ficus religiosa, Bombax gossipium, Feronia elephantum, and several species of Acacia.\n\n'The toddy palms, Borassus flabelliformis and Phoenix sylvestris, are extensively cultivated on account of their sap, which is drawn off, and fermented into an intoxicating beverage. The cocoa-nut tree cannot be brought to perfection, even with the greatest care, accompanied by the most favourable circumstances; and in consequence, its cultivation is very circumscribed. Mango and tamarind trees occur in great numbers about the villages. The betel vine is also cultivated, but in no great quantities. The principal grain crops are rice (of which there are no less than eight varieties), wheat, maize of various kinds, jodr (Holcus sorghum), bajra (Holcus spicatus), ragi (Cynosurus corocanus); of oil-seeds \u2014 mustard, Sesamum orientale, and Ricinus communis or castor-oil plant; of leguminous growths \u2014 Dolichos lablab, Dolichos gladiatus, Phaseolus mungo, chenna (Cicer arietinum). Melons, cucumbers, gourds, and some other cucurbitacea are largely grown, and form important articles of diet. The gardens produce onions, garlic, carrots, radishes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, coriander, ginger, turmeric, and various kinds of amaranth used as pot-herbs. Tobacco is cultivated, but not to a great extent. Cotton, indigo, and sugar-cane are the more important objects of the agriculturist's care. Al (Morinda citrifolia) and chayr\u00fat (Oldenlandia umbellata), valuable dyes, occur wild, and are also cultivated.'\n\nThe cotton-producing capabilities of the country are well known. The produce of Kunar Idl\u00e1bd District, which chiefly finds its way to the Hingangh\u00e1t market, is greatly valued, and fetches a high price. In 1875, there were no mills or manufactories in the territory; but a cotton-spinning factory has recently been constructed in connection with a wealthy European firm in Bombay. Fruit of many different kinds is plentiful. The mango and custard-apple grow wild over large tracts. The melons and pine-apples of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d are as celebrated in their way as the oranges of N\u00e1gpur, and the large purple grape of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d is exported to many distant markets. Plants rich in textile fibre are not less abundant, and will one day, it may be presumed, be utilized on a large scale. 'Tasar' silk, the produce of a wild species of worm, is everywhere gathered in the jungles. Hides, raw and tanned, both of domesticated and wild quadrupeds, are articles of some importance in commerce. Wild bees swarm in all the jungles; consequently wax and honey are abundant and cheap. Lac, suitable for use as a resin or a dye, may be obtained in quantities far beyond the present demand. Mucilaginous gums are produced in the woods in inexhaustible quantities, and there are some considered not inferior in quality to the best African gums. Of gum resins, the most\nworth notice is that yielded by the Boswellia thurifera. *Dika-mali*, a resin yielded in great quantities by several species of Gardenia, is much used in native pharmacy, and probably might serve important purposes in the arts, but its properties have not been adequately tested. Some sorts of nuts yield oils, which might prove important articles of commerce. Cordage is supplied by the common *san* (Crotalaria juncea), also by some species of Bauhinia, and of admirable quality by Asclepias tenacissima. Of timber, the teak (*Tectona grandis*) produced in this territory is stunted and indifferent; but some of fine quality is floated down the river from the forests of N\u00e1gpur. Other valuable woods are Diospyros melanoxylon and Dalbergia or *sisu.*\n\n**People.**\u2014A Census of the population of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions in 1881, excluding Ber\u00e1r or the HAI DARABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS, which are under British administration, returned a total of 9,845,594 persons, of whom 925,929, or about one-tenth, were Muhammadans. The principal sects among the Muhammadans are the Shaikhs, who number 484,155; the Sayyids, 89,909; the Mughals, 15,423; and the Path\u00e1ns, 61,437; the \u2018unspecified\u2019 being returned at 275,005. The chief divisions among the remaining population were thus given\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 259,147; R\u00e1jputs, 49,843; Bair\u00e1g\u00eds, 5057; Bedars, 119,161; Bhois, 92,170; Cham\u00e1rs (leather-workers), 447,312; tailors, 30,937; Dh\u00e1ngars, 482,035; Gaond\u00eds, 30,039; Gaolis, 212,608; Gosa\u00edns, 21,395; Gujar\u00e1t\u00eds, 3544; Lingayats (traders), 97,836; Jog\u00eds (jugglers), 4371; Loh\u00e1rs (smiths), 56,128; Kam\u00e1tis (traders), 194,284; Kol\u00eds (cultivators), 213,966; Kosht\u00eds, 79,142; Kunb\u00eds (cultivators), 1,658,665; M\u00e1ngs, 315,732; M\u00e1lis, 83,806; Mahars, 806,653; Kumbhars (potters), 90,835; Mahalls, 102,213; Manbhao\u015b, 2627; Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 369,636; Marw\u00e1r\u00eds (money-lenders and bankers), 42,009; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 88,769; Telingas, 327,338; Tel\u00eds, 67,564; Waddars, 54,833; Banj\u00e1ras (carriers), 6120; Baniy\u00e1s (village shopkeepers), 392,184; Bhils, 8470; Gonds, 39,513; Koyas, 45,300; Lamb\u00e1n\u00eds, 85,204; and Pardh\u00eds, 2114. The above figures would give an average density of population for Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d of about 123 to the square mile. In the south-eastern part of the territory, the Telugu language prevails; and in the south-western Districts, in the vicinity of the Kistna river, Kanarese is spoken. In the northern and western parts, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed is generally used; and, as the border-land between this language and the Dravidian languages passes through the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, there is a considerable intermixture of people speaking different languages. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are most numerous in the west. The Musalm\u00e1ns are chiefly to be met with in the capital, and everywhere in the civil and military service of Government. In addition to the Hindu and Muhammadan popu-\nlation, there is a large admixture of P\u00e1rs\u00eds, Sikhs, Arabs, Rohill\u00e1s, aborigines, and 'others.'\n\nOwing to the general distribution of arms among all classes, the people of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, as of other Native States, present to the casual observer a more formidable appearance than is borne out, perhaps, by anything in their actual character or disposition. The Telingas or Telugu-speaking folk, though not in a highly-advanced state of civilisation, are by no means sunk in barbarism. They generally inhabit straggling villages, in houses built of mud, with pyramidal roofs of palmyra leaves, though a few dwellings are more substantially constructed of brick, and tiled. In some of the less civilised parts, the habitations are mere sheds of palmyra leaves, or hovels made of bamboos and wattle. There is usually to each village a detached fort, constructed either of masonry or mud, about 50 yards square, and containing the dwellings of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r and his immediate dependants. There is a considerable proportion of Br\u00e1hmans among the Telingas; and the usual diet of these and the higher classes consists of rice in some localities and of wheat and jo\u00e1r in others, with vegetable curries, and cakes flavoured with garlic or assafoetida and fried in butter. The Br\u00e1hmans profess to abstain from animal food; but the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of the Kunbi caste consume mutton, poultry, and game. The lower orders subsist on ragi and other inferior sorts of grain; all are addicted to intoxication with the fermented sap of various kinds of palms and spirit distilled from the flowers of the mah\u00fad (Bassia latifolia). Tobacco is generally used, both for smoking and chewing, as well as in the form of snuff. Bhang, or the intoxicating narcotic obtained from hemp, and opium are also in use, but to no great extent. The Gonds, who lurk in the hills and fastnesses, are a wild and savage race; yet they may be rendered tractable and obedient by kind treatment. At present the majority are nearly in a state of nature, sheltering in caves or hollow trees, and feeding on game when obtainable, at other times on vermin, reptiles, and wild roots or fruits.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The principal articles of export are cotton, oil-seeds, country cloth, hides, metal ware, and agricultural produce; the imports are salt from the eastern and western coasts, grain, timber, European piece-goods, and hardware. In the absence of any complete system of registration, the only means of approximately estimating the annual value of the trade of the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions with other Provinces is by calculating it from the known yield of the ad valorem duties levied at customs houses. The amount thus deducible would be about \u00a310,000,000 sterling per annum. Among the manufactures of the country may be mentioned the ornamental metal ware of Bidar; the gold-embroidered cloth (kamkhab) of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Gulbarga, and\nother towns; and the excellent paper of different kinds which is made by the inhabitants of the hamlet of K\u00e1ghazpur, near the famous fortress of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nCommunications.\u2014The railway connecting Bombay with Madras traverses the south-western part of the State. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway works the line as far as R\u00e1ichur, where it is joined by the Madras Railway. At Wadi, 7 miles from the station of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the Great Indian Peninsula line, the Niz\u00e1m's State Railway branches off to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and to the military cantonment of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d (Sikandr\u00e1b\u00e1d). From Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d two lines of telegraph separate, one going south-west to Bellary, the other with an easterly direction towards Masulipatam, near the mouth of the Kistna. 'The principal roads are the military ones\u2014(1) from north to south, from N\u00e1gpur through the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to Bangalore; (2) from south-east to north-west, from Madras and Masulipatam through the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to Poona and thence to Bombay; (3) from south-east to north-west, from the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.'\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue of the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions, Ber\u00e1r included, may be stated in round numbers at \u00a34,000,000, inclusive of receipts from all sources. About three-fourths of the above large sum is collected by the Niz\u00e1m's own Government from tracts under native rule. The remaining one-fourth is realized by British officers principally from Ber\u00e1r. All revenue collected by our Government from Districts owning the sovereignty of the Niz\u00e1m is either spent by us in administering those Districts, or is handed over to him as unexpended surplus. The only feudatory of the Niz\u00e1m is the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Gudw\u00e1l, who is independent in his internal administration so long as he pays an annual tribute of \u00a311,500.\n\nThe land revenue is still collected in kind in some parts of the country; the rate for irrigated crops being half to the Government and half to the cultivator. Where it is paid in money, the rate is much the same, about 8 annas in the rupee or one shilling out of every two on the value of the crop.\n\nThe Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Government has a mint and a currency of its own. In former days, rupees of different kinds were manufactured in various parts of the country. Now there is only one mint, situated in the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d; and only one kind of rupee, namely, the hali stica, or 'rupee of the period,' is turned out. Though smaller in disc, it is also a good deal thicker than our rupee, and the difference in weight and intrinsic value between the two coins is trifling.\n\nHistory.\u2014The dynasty of the Niz\u00e1m was founded by Asaf Jah, a distinguished general of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, of T\u00farkoman descent. After a long life at the Delhi Court, distinguished alike in war and political cunning, he was appointed in 1713 Subahd\u00e1r or\nViceroy of the Deccan, with the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk (Regulator of the State), which has since become hereditary in the family. The Mughal Empire was at this time torn by internal dissension, and at the same time threatened by the rising power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Amid the general confusion, Asaf Jah had little difficulty in asserting his independence against the degenerate descendant of Aurangzeb, though he was less successful in repelling the inroads of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 cavalry. At the time of his death in 1748, he was firmly established as an independent sovereign, with Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d for his capital, and a kingdom roughly co-extensive with the present State.\n\nThe right of succession was fiercely contested among his descendants. The claimants most favoured were two. One of these, Nasr Jang, the second son of the deceased ruler, being on the spot when his father died, had seized the treasure, and obtained the support of the army; and, moreover, he fortified his claim by an alleged renunciation of the right of inheritance on the part of his elder brother. The other, Muzaffar Jang, was a grandson of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk by a favourite daughter; and to him, it was said, the succession was conveyed by testamentary bequest. Each of the two candidates had the good fortune to secure the countenance and support of one of the great European powers then commencing their career of contention for supremacy in the East,\u2014the English espousing the cause of Nas\u00edr Jang, the French that of his rival, Muzaffar Jang; but after a very brief period, dissensions between the commander and his officers caused the retirement of the French force from the field, and Muzaffar Jang, deprived of support, became the prisoner of Nas\u00edr Jang. Nas\u00edr Jang soon afterwards perished by the hands of his own followers, and Muzaffar Jang was proclaimed Subahd\u00e1r of the Deccan; but his authority was exercised under the control of the French commander, Dupleix, whose will was supreme. Muzaffar Jang was not destined long to enjoy even the appearance of power. He fell in an affray with some Path\u00e1n chiefs, who, having been instrumental in placing him on the throne, were disappointed in the amount of reward to which they thought their services entitled. A new occupant of the seat of power was now to be sought; and the French, passing over an infant son of Muzaffar Jang, selected Sal\u00e1bat Jang, a brother of Nas\u00edr Jang, to be ruler of the Deccan. Another claimant for the dignity, however, shortly afterwards appeared in the person of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn, the eldest son of the Niz\u00e1m Asaf Jah. The impending contest between the brothers was averted by the sudden death of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn; and though the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, by whom he was supported, continued for their own purposes to maintain hostilities, their unvarying ill-success disposed them to listen to proposals for procuring their withdrawal on the usual terms.\nThe English and French, however, continued to struggle for power and influence in the Deccan; but the latter were compelled after a while, by the danger threatening their own possessions from the victories gained by Clive, to withdraw from the support of Sal\u00e1bat Jang, who thus weakened, and apprehensive, moreover, of the designs of a younger brother, Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed, entered into an engagement with the English, by which he promised to dismiss the French from his service, and renounce all connection with them. In 1761, this weak prince was dethroned by his own brother, Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed, whom, contrary to the advice of the most judicious of his French councillors, he had entrusted with power which was used to supplant the donor. Two years afterwards, the usurper made further acknowledgment of his brother's favour by putting him to death. In 1765 he ravaged the Karnatic, exercising in his course a measure of cruelty far beyond what was necessary to his purpose; but he retired on the approach of a British force. Still the British Government was anxious to be on better terms with him, partly from a desire to obtain his concurrence to their retention of the maritime Province known as the Northern Circars, formerly possessed by the French, but now occupied by the English, who had fortified their right by the firm\u00e1n of the Emperor.\n\nAccordingly, in 1766, a treaty was concluded by which, on condition of a grant of the Circars, the British Government agreed to furnish the Niz\u00e1m with a subsidiary force when required, and to pay 9 l\u0101khs of rupees (say \u00a390,000) a year, when the assistance of their troops was not required. The Niz\u00e1m on his part engaged to assist the British with his troops. There were other stipulations; and among them one reserving the life right of Bas\u00e1lat Jang, a brother of Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed, in one of the Circars, subject to his good behaviour. The aid of British troops was afforded, as provided by the treaty, to enable Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed to march against Haidar Al\u00ed of Mysore, then rapidly rising to power; but after a good deal of vacillation, Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed preferred to unite with that adventurer. The allies, however, were unprosperous, and the Niz\u00e1m was compelled to sue for peace, which was concluded by a new treaty in 1768. By the Sixth Article, the East India Company and the Naw\u00e1b of the Karnatic (who was a party to the treaty) were to be always ready to send two battalions of Sepoys and six pieces of artillery, manned by Europeans, wherever the Niz\u00e1m should require them, and the situation of affairs should allow of such assistance being rendered, the Niz\u00e1m paying the expense during the time such force should be employed in this service. In 1782, Bas\u00e1lat Jang died; but the Company did not obtain possession of the Circar held by him till 1788. The peshkash, or payment to be made to the Niz\u00e1m on account of the Circars, had fallen into arrear, and was not adjusted till a later period. These matters, however, having been at length arranged, the British Governor-General, Lord Cornwallis, in\n1789, addressed a letter to the Niz\u00e1m explaining and interpreting the treaty of 1768, but declining to enter into any new treaty, as had been suggested. That letter was subsequently declared, by a resolution of the House of Commons, to have the full force of a treaty executed in due form. In it the Governor-General agreed that the force stipulated for in the Sixth Article of the treaty of 1768 should be granted whenever applied for, provided it was not to be employed against any power in alliance with the Company. In the following year, on the breaking out of a war with Tip\u00fa, son of Haidar Al\u00ed, a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance was concluded between the Niz\u00e1m, the Peshw\u00e1, and the British Government. Tip\u00fa purchased peace at the price of half his dominions, and the Niz\u00e1m had no reason to be dissatisfied with his share of the spoil. At a later period, the Niz\u00e1m, being engaged in war with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, claimed the assistance of the British Government under the subsisting relations between them; but the Governor-General, Sir John Shore, was precluded by the treaties with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from interfering further than as mediator, and the Niz\u00e1m was eventually obliged to conclude an ignominious peace with his enemy. The refusal of assistance and its results so incensed the Niz\u00e1m, that he requested that two battalions stationed at his capital as a subsidiary force should be withdrawn.\n\nThe Niz\u00e1m now sought safety in the enlistment of a body of troops commanded by French officers, who, however, were dismissed in accordance with the provisions of a treaty (1798), under the administration of the Earl of Mornington, afterwards Marquis Wellesley. By this treaty, a subsidiary force, augmented to 6000 Sepoys with a due proportion of field-pieces, was assigned to the service of the Niz\u00e1m, who on his part agreed to pay a subsidy for the support of the force of \u00a3241,710. On the fall of Seringapatam and the death of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, the Niz\u00e1m participated largely in the division of territory, under the partition treaty of 1799, and his share was increased on the Peshw\u00e1's withdrawal from the treaty. In 1800, the subsidiary force with the Niz\u00e1m was further augmented, and the pecuniary payment for its maintenance was commuted for a cession of territory. The country ceded on this occasion consisted of the acquisitions made from Tip\u00fa allotted to the Niz\u00e1m under the treaty of Seringapatam in 1792, and the treaty of Mysore, concluded in 1799, after the destruction of Tip\u00fa's power and government. This territory is known to the present time under the title of the Ceded Districts.\n\nBy the treaty of 1800, the Niz\u00e1m agreed to furnish in time of war 6000 infantry and 9000 cavalry to co-operate with the British army, and to employ every effort to bring into the field as speedily as possible the whole force of his dominions. But his troops proved very inefficient in the first Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war, and, after the conclusion of the\ncampaign, various schemes were from time to time proposed for their reform, with little success. Eventually battalions were raised, which were clothed, armed, and equipped like the Company's troops; and for the regular payment of this contingent, advances were made in 1843 from the British treasury, on the distinct understanding that in the event of further advances becoming necessary, a territorial security for the payment of the debt would be demanded. No efforts, however, were made to pay off the debt, which continued to increase. At last, in 1853, a new treaty was concluded, by which the British Government agreed to maintain an auxiliary force of not less than 5000 infantry, 2000 cavalry, and 4 field batteries, and to provide for its payment and for certain pensions and the interest on the debt; the Niz\u00e1m on his part agreed to cede in trust Districts yielding a gross revenue of 50 l\u0101kh s of rupees (say \u00a3500,000). By this treaty the Niz\u00e1m, while retaining the full use of the subsidiary force and contingent, was released from the unlimited obligation of service in time of war; and the contingent ceased to be part of the Niz\u00e1m's army, and became an auxiliary force kept up by the British Government for the Niz\u00e1m's use.\n\nIn 1857, when the Mutiny broke out, the condition of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions became critical; and in July, an attack, which was repulsed, was made upon the Residency. The Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d contingent displayed its loyalty in the field against the rebels. In 1860, a fresh treaty was made by which the territorial acquisitions of the Niz\u00e1m were increased, a debt of 50 l\u0101kh s of rupees was cancelled, and the Assigned Districts in Ber\u00e1r, yielding a gross revenue of Rs. 3,200,000 (say \u00a3320,000), were taken in trust by the British Government for the purposes specified in the treaty of 1853. Under British administration the revenues of Ber\u00e1r have greatly increased. They amounted in 1882-83 to \u00a3855,233. The surplus is paid over to the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State.\n\nThe present Niz\u00e1m, M\u00edr Mahbub Al\u00ed, was born in 1866. He is in point of rank the first Muhammadan ruler in India, and is entitled to a salute of 21 guns. The military force of the Niz\u00e1m consists of 71 field and 654 other guns, 551 artillerymen, 1400 cavalry, and 12,775 infantry, besides a large body of irregulars.\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d).\u2014Chief city and capital of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 21' 45\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 30' 10\" E., on the river Mus\u00ed, which is here between 400 and 500 feet wide. It stands at a height of about 1700 feet above sea-level, and is distant 389 miles north-west from Madras, 449 south-east from Bombay, and 962 south-west from Calcutta. According to the Census taken in February 1881, the population of the city was returned at 123,675; and of the suburbs, 231,287; making a total of 354,962. The city is about 6 miles in circumference, with a stone wall, flanked with bastions, encircling\nHAIDARABAD CITY.\n\nit. The street architecture is not imposing, and there are few buildings with any pretensions to architectural merit. Perhaps there is no city in India with a population so varied or so warlike. Every man goes about armed with a weapon of some kind, while the military classes are literally armed to the teeth. Here may be seen the Arab, the Sidi, the Rohilla, the Path\u00e1n, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, the Turk, the Sikh, Persians, Bokhariots, P\u00e1rs\u00eds, Madrasis, and others.\n\nThe scenery around Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is wild and picturesque, the country being hilly and dotted with numerous granite peaks and isolated rocks. Approached from the west, the appearance of the city is very striking; the palace and mosques and magnificent pile of buildings erected for the British Residency towering above the outer wall. A large lake, a few miles south of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, supplies the city. When full, this sheet of water is nearly 20 miles in circumference, and covers an area of 10,000 acres.\n\nThe palace of the Niz\u00e1m, the mosques, and the British Residency are the principal buildings. The former has, however, no pretensions to splendour, but is of considerable size. M. Langl\u00e8s describes it as being more than a league in circumference, and guarded by a valiant body of Amazons. Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is a great Muhammadan stronghold, and contains several mosques. The Jam\u00e1 Masjid or 'Cathedral' Mosque, so called after the one at Mecca, from which it is designed, is large, and crowned by minarets of an extraordinary height. The pillars within consist each of a single piece of granite, and are very lofty. In the environs of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d there are many fine gardens, with gorgeous pavilions. That of the Niz\u00e1m's minister is said to be wonderfully beautiful. It is enclosed by high walls, and in the centre is a marble tank. Carved trellis-work forms an important feature in the building. One of the most interesting places in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is the College or Ch\u00e1r Min\u00e1r (so called from its 4 minarets), built upon four grand arches, at which the four principal streets of the city meet. Above are several storeys of rooms, and formerly each storey was devoted to a science. These apartments are now turned into warehouses.\n\nOn the north side of the Mus\u00ed is an extensive suburb known as the Begam or 'Princess' B\u00e1z\u00e1r, because the imposts levied there are a perquisite of the Niz\u00e1m's principal wife. The British Residency is in this quarter, and communication between it and the palace of the Niz\u00e1m is maintained by a handsome bridge, planned by Colonel Oliphant, of the Madras Engineers. It was built in 1831, of squared granite, and has eight arches; the roadway is 24 feet wide. The British Residency was designed by Mr. Russell, and is remarkable, among other things, as having been constructed entirely by native workmen. The north front looks away from the river and the city. It is adorned by a splendid portico, to which leads up a flight of twenty-\ntwo steps, having on either side a colossal sphinx. From the summit of the steps six Corinthian columns, faced with chundam stone of dazzling whiteness, rise to the top of the upper storey of the main building. The Company's arms, in alto-relievo, form the central ornament. The interior of the portico is elaborately carved, and the whole building stands in ornamental pleasure-grounds, enclosed by a wall with two gateways. The staircase is the finest in India, each step being a single block of the finest granite; the walls are richly decorated, and the apartments are furnished with the utmost luxuriance. The pavilions, galleries, and terraces are ornamented in the florid style of Oriental architecture, with a profusion of delicate trellis-work, painting, and gilding. The finest private residence in the city is the palace of the B\u0101ra Dari or 'Twelve Doors,' now occupied by the present minister of the Niz\u00e1m, Sir Sal\u00e1r Jung.\n\nHistory.\u2014Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was founded in 1589, by Kutab Sh\u00e1h Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00fal\u00ed, the fifth in descent from Sult\u00e1n K\u00fal\u00ed Kutab Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the dynasty at Golconda. Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00fal\u00ed removed the seat of government from Golconda on account of its want of water and consequent unhealthiness, and built a new city on the banks of the Mus\u00ed river, 7 miles from his former capital. He called it Bh\u00e1g\u00e1nagar, 'Fortunate City,' from his favourite mistress, Bh\u00e1gmati; but after her death he named it Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, 'The City of Haidar,' though for many years it retained its former appellation. The history of Golconda and of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d after 1589 are almost identical. Soon after establishing himself in his new capital, Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00fal\u00ed carried on with the neighbouring Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s the war which his predecessor, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, had begun. He extended his conquests south of the Kistna river; the strong fortress of Gandikota was captured, and one of his detachments sacked the town of Cuddapah. Some of his troops penetrated even to the frontiers of Bengal, and Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00fal\u00ed defeated the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Orissa, and subjugated the greater part of the Northern Circars.\n\nIn 1603, an ambassador from Sh\u00e1h Abbas, King of Persia, arrived at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d with a ruby-studded crown and other magnificent gifts. The palace of DIl-kush\u00e1 was allotted to the envoy, who remained there six years, receiving from Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00fal\u00ed \u00a32000 annually for his expenses. When the ambassador left for Persia, an officer of the court of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d accompanied him, bearing return presents, and amongst them some gold cloth manufactured at Paitan, which it took five years to make. In 1611, Mu\u1e25ammad K\u00fal\u00ed died, after a prosperous reign of thirty-four years. The principal memorials of this monarch are the palace and gardens of Il\u00e1hl Mah\u00e1l, the Mu\u1e25ammad\u00ed gardens, the palace of Nabat Gh\u00e1t, the Ch\u00e1r Min\u00e1r or College already described, and the Jam\u00e1 Masjid or 'Cathedral'\nMosque. According to the accounts of M\u00edr Ab\u00fa T\u00e1lib, the king's private treasurer, \u00a32,800,000 was expended on public works during the reign of Muhammad K\u00fal\u00ed, and \u00a324,000 was distributed every year among the poor. The king's example of liberality was followed by his nobility; and the number of handsome buildings throughout the dominions of the Kutab Sh\u00e1h monarchs is unsurpassed, if not unequalled, in any other of the Muhammadan kingdoms of the Deccan.\n\nMuhammad K\u00fal\u00ed was succeeded by his son, Sult\u00e1n Abdull\u00e1 Kutab Sh\u00e1h. The Mughals under Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, the fifth Emperor (1627\u201358), now make their appearance in Southern India. Aurangzeb, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n's son, was sent as viceroy into the Deccan by that prince, who seemed bent on compensating for failures beyond the Indus by the subjugation of Bijapur and Golconda. The immediate cause of his attack on the latter kingdom was an appeal from M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, the Prime Minister, whose son had involved him in a dispute with the court. M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, finding himself unable to obtain such concessions as he desired from his own sovereign, determined to throw himself on the protection of the Mughal Emperor. Such an opportunity for intrigue suited Aurangzeb's character, and he strongly urged his father to entertain M\u00edr Juml\u00e1's petition. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, influenced by this advice, issued a mandate to Abdull\u00e1 to redress the complaints of his minister; but Abdull\u00e1 was so incensed by this questioning of his independence that he sequestrated M\u00edr Juml\u00e1's property, and committed his son, Muhammad Am\u00edn, to prison. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n now despatched Aurangzeb to carry his demands into effect by force of arms. Under pretext of escorting his son Sult\u00e1n Muhammad to Bengal, to wed the daughter of his brother Prince Shuj\u00e1, Aurangzeb made a treacherous attack on Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The road from Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d (the capital of the Deccan) to Bengal made a circuit by Masulipatam in order to avoid the forests of Gondw\u00e1na, and thus naturally brought the viceroy within a short distance of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Abdull\u00e1 Kutab Sh\u00e1h was preparing an entertainment for Aurangzeb's reception, when he suddenly advanced as an enemy, and took the king so completely by surprise that he had only time to flee to the hill-fort of Golconda, 7 miles distant, whilst Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d fell into the hands of the Mughals, and was plundered and half burned before the troops could be brought into order. Abdull\u00e1 did all in his power to negotiate reasonable terms, but the Mughals were inexorable; and after several attempts to raise the siege by force, he was at last forced to accept the severe conditions imposed on him, viz. to give his daughter in marriage to Sult\u00e1n Muhammad, with a dowry in land and money; to pay a crore of rupees (\u00a31,000,000 sterling) as the first instalment of a yearly tribute; and to make up the arrears of past payments in two years. M\u00edr Juml\u00e1 remained in the\nservice of the Mughals, and became a favourite general of Aurangzeb, and one of the most useful instruments of his ambition.\n\nAbdull\u00e1 died in 1672, and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Ab\u00fa Husain, who in his youth had been notorious for dissipated habits. He fell entirely under the influence of a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hman, named Madh\u00fana Panth, who became his Prime Minister. In 1676, at the invitation of this man, Sivaj\u00ed, the founder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy, entered Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d with a force of 70,000 men, on his way to the Karnatic. He also concluded a treaty with Ab\u00fa Husain. Sivaj\u00ed's reception at Golconda afforded grounds for a war with the State of Bij\u00e1pur, but the invasion was resisted and defeated by Madh\u00fana Panth. Sivaj\u00ed died in 1680, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sambaj\u00ed, with whom Ab\u00fa Husain also entered into an alliance. Aurangzeb was prevented from at once turning his arms against Golconda, owing to a convention made by his son, Prince Muazim. When, in 1686, Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n was sent against that State, and found himself unable to oppose its army, he begged urgently for reinforcements; and Prince Muazim was despatched to his assistance. The leader of the Golconda troops proved unfaithful to his cause, and allowed the united forces to proceed unmolested to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he joined the Mughals with the greater part of his troops. The king, Ab\u00fa Husain, shut himself in the fort of Golconda; and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was again left open to plunder. Madh\u00fana Panth was killed in a popular tumult, and the king accepted such terms as he could obtain. A payment of 2 millions sterling in money and jewels was demanded. The treaty, however, was of short duration, for in 1687 Aurangzeb formally declared war against Ab\u00fa Husain. The king bravely defended the fort of Golconda for seven months, and lost it at last by treachery, and was sent a captive to Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he resided until his death. Ab\u00fa Husain was a very popular monarch, and many anecdotes of his virtues are still current in the Deccan. Aurangzeb immediately took possession of all the territories of Bij\u00e1pur and Golconda, but his occupation was little more than military. The Districts were farmed out, and were governed by military leaders, who received 25 per cent. for the expense of collecting the revenue.\n\nNo event of any importance occurred at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d until 1707, the year of Aurangzeb's death. A dispute for the crown took place between his two sons, Prince Az\u00edm and Prince Muazim. The latter was victorious, and ascended the throne as Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h. Prince K\u00e1m Bakhsh refused to acknowledge his brother as king; and Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, after attempting in vain to win him over by concessions, marched against him to the Deccan, and defeated him in a battle near Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (February 1708), in which K\u00e1m Bakhsh was mortally wounded. Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h then made a truce with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; and affairs in\nthe Deccan remained quiet until the end of his reign, in 1712. The viceroyalty was given to Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, an adherent of Prince Az\u00edm; and the administration of the government to D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n officer, who had distinguished himself under Aurangzeb. The death of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h was followed by struggles amongst his sons. The incapacity of the eldest, Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h, had given a great ascendancy to the second, Az\u00edm-us-Sh\u00e1n, who was supported by the army and the nobility. A battle ensued; Az\u00edm-us-Sh\u00e1n was repulsed and slain, and Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Sh\u00e1h remained undisputed master of the throne. One of his first acts was to put all the princes of the blood within his reach to death. Among those whom he could not get into his power was Farukhsiyyar, the only son of Az\u00edm-us-Sh\u00e1n; but the cause of this prince was espoused by the governor of Behar, Sayyid Husain Al\u00ed. The rivals met near Agra on the 28th of December 1712; and on the 1st of January 1713, Farukhsiyyar ascended the throne, and conferred dignities upon all his adherents. Among these was Chin Khilich Kh\u00e1n, a noble of high rank, and a brilliant statesman, to whom was given the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk Asaf Jah. Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n was put to death, and Sayyid Husain Al\u00ed appointed viceroy of the Deccan in his stead. But the Emperor was jealous of his powerful subject, and wished to get rid of him. He therefore wrote to D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, promising him the viceroyalty if he would attack Husain Al\u00ed on his arrival in the Deccan and destroy him. No more acceptable commission could have been offered to D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n than that of revenging the death of his friend and patron Zulfik\u00e1r; and taking up a position at Burh\u00e1npur, he proclaimed himself viceroy, and awaited Husain Al\u00ed's appearance. A severe battle was fought, in which D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n was on the point of victory when he was struck by a bullet, and killed instantly (1716). Husain Al\u00ed immediately took the field against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, but was completely routed. He and his brother Sayyid Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the Waz\u00edr of the Deccan, now united their forces against Farukhsiyyar, whose schemes for the destruction of Husain Al\u00ed had proved abortive. In December 1719 the allies advanced upon Delhi, and the Emperor submitted to their demands, which became more exorbitant day by day, and ended in their obtaining possession of the royal citadel and palace, which were occupied by their troops. In February 1819, Farukhsiyyar was deposed, and, two months later, put to death by order of Husain Al\u00ed and Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThe two Sayyids, as the brothers were called, selected as Emperor Raff-ud-daul\u00e1, who died in a few months. He was succeeded (1719 to 1748) by Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, the last independent Emperor that sat on the Delhi throne. The first great event in his reign was the overthrow of the two Sayyids, which was effected in great measure by a league between Asaf Jah and Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, his coadjutor and rival,\nand afterwards the founder of the Oudh dynasty. Asaf Jah saw in the disturbed condition of the country an excuse for raising troops; and as he perceived the difficulty of establishing a permanent control at Delhi, he determined to lay the foundation of his power on a firmer basis, and turned his attention first to the Deccan. His plans against the Sayyids succeeded. In October 1720, Husain Ali was assassinated, and at the end of the year Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n was defeated and taken prisoner by Muhammad Sh\u00e1h; but the power of this monarch was rapidly declining. In January 1722, Asaf Jah arrived at Delhi, and assumed the office of Waz\u00edr. He found the court in a state of the utmost weakness; the Emperor and his favourites were given up to pleasure; and after some months of mutual dissatisfaction, they devised plans to free themselves from the troublesome counsels of Asaf Jah. The Waz\u00edr was despatched against the refractory governor of Gujar\u00e1t, but speedily returned, strengthened by the addition of a rich Province. In October 1723, shortly after this victory, Asaf Jah resigned his post as Waz\u00edr, and set off for the Deccan, a proceeding amounting in reality to a declaration of independence. The Emperor, although he graciously accepted Asaf Jah's resignation, and conferred on him the title of Lieutenant of the Empire,\u2014the highest that could be conferred on a subject,\u2014did not on that account abate his hostility. He sent orders to the local governor of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to endeavour to possess the viceroy, and assume the government of the Deccan in his place.\n\nMub\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n entered zealously on this task, and succeeded in gathering together a powerful army. Asaf Jah protracted negotiations for several months, and endeavoured to sow sedition among the adherents of the governor. At last he was forced to come to open war, and soon gained a decisive victory over Mub\u00e1riz, who lost his life in the battle, fought in October 1724. As the Emperor had not avowed the attack which he had instigated, Asaf Jah, not to be outdone in dissimulation, sent the head of Mub\u00e1riz to court with his own congratulations on the extinction of the rebellion. He then fixed his residence at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and became the founder of an independent kingdom, now ruled over by his descendants, who derive from him the title of the Niz\u00e1ms of HAIDARABAD STATE. (In the compilation of this section, considerable use has been made of Elphinstone's History of India.)\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) Assigned Districts.\u2014A Province in Central India, better known under the name of Ber\u00e1r, administered by the British Resident at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, under the title of Chief Commissioner of Ber\u00e1r. It comprises the six Districts of Akola, Buldana, Basim, Amraoti, Ellichpur, and Wun. Bounded on the north and east by the Central Provinces; on the south by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions; and on the west by the Bombay Presidency. Lies between 19\u00b0 26'\nand $21^\\circ 46'$ N. latitude, and between $75^\\circ 58' 45''$ and $79^\\circ 13' 13''$ E. longitude. Area, 17,711 square miles; population (1881) 2,672,673 persons, dwelling in 5585 towns and villages, and in 466,027 houses; number of persons per house, 5'74; average density, 151 persons per square mile.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Ber\u00e1r is, in the main, a broad valley running east and west, lying between the S\u00e1tpura range on the north and the Ajanta range on the south. The old local name of the valley at the base of the S\u00e1tpuras was Ber\u00e1r Payangh\u00e1t; that of the tracts situated among the uplands and hills of the Ajanta range being Ber\u00e1r B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t. The real strength of the Province is found in the valley at the base of the S\u00e1tpuras. This valley is watered or drained, as the case may be, by the P\u00farna (an affluent of the T\u00e1pti), and a perfect network of streams descending into the main river, both from the hills in the north and from the hills in the south. Its soil is one vast superstratum of black loam overlying trap and basalt. Its rainfall is regular and copious; its area is now almost entirely cultivated, nearly the whole surface being covered over at harvest time by a sheet of crops. Its population is dense, and consists of Kunb\u00eds and other hardy and industrious agricultural castes. It is traversed from west to east, for the greater part of its breadth, by the railway from N\u00e1gpur to Bhus\u00e1wal and Bombay. It possesses one of the richest and most extensive cotton-fields in India, and several cotton marts of the first rank. Its other products, especially millets and oil-seeds, are also excellent. Altogether, it is one of the most promising regions in India; and in respect to natural and material advantages, it surpasses any tract in either the Central Provinces or the Deccan.\n\nThe area of Ber\u00e1r may be reckoned at a little more than 17,700 square miles, being about equal to that of the kingdom of Greece without the Ionian Islands. Its population is double that of Greece. Its length from east to west is about 150 miles, and its breadth averages 144 miles. The principal rivers are the T\u00e1pti, the P\u00farna, the Wardh\u00e1, and the Pengang\u00e1 or Pranh\u00edta. The T\u00e1pti is the only river of the first class, but the Wardh\u00e1 is by far the most important as commanding the drainage and irrigation. The Province has but one natural lake, the salt lake of LONAR in Buld\u00e1na District, a great curiosity. The view of the lake is striking. It is shut in by a ridge of well-wooded hills, and is perfectly circular. The area of the lake is 345 acres, and the circumference 5\u00bd miles. The forest area of the Province on the 31st March 1883 was 4344 square miles, of which 1106 square miles were State reserves, 283 District reserves, and 2955 unreserved forests. The area of forests actually protected from fire was 552,931 acres in 1882 and 622,640 acres in 1883. The most valuable forests are those on the G\u00e1wilgarh Hills. The greater part of the Ber\u00e1r valley is sup-\nplied with bamboos and wood for building purposes from this range of hills. The teak produced in the Melgh\u00e1t tract of the Gangra valley finds its way to the country above the gh\u00e1ts in South Ber\u00e1r, while the villages north of the P\u00farna river, and north of Amr\u00e1oti, draw their supplies of grass and firewood to a great extent from the same region. Annually, during the rains, large herds of cattle are sent into the hills for pasture. A plantation garden has been established at Makhla; area of regular plantations (1881\u201382), 1409 acres. The Ber\u00e1r forests are worked on the following system. Timber is only allowed to be cut on permission given by the Deputy-Commissioner, and it must in all cases be paid for at certain fixed rates. Fuel may be cut, but not exported, without permission. Grass and minor produce are sold by auction. The expenditure on the Forest Department of Ber\u00e1r was \u00a315,169 in 1881\u201382, and \u00a314,997 in 1882\u201383. The income in the former year was \u00a323,381, and in the latter year \u00a328,704. Convictions in 1882\u201383 for breaches of forest rules, 363.\n\nIron-ore is plentiful throughout large tracts on the east, especially in the hills about K\u00e1ranja, and along the low range close to Amr\u00e1oti on the north-east. It is not worked by the natives, and the proportion of iron in the ore has not been scientifically determined. The only District within Ber\u00e1r which yields coal is W\u00fan, where, stretching along the valley of the Wardh\u00e1 river, in a direction roughly north and south, a group of beds of thick coal of fair quality has lately been found. This group may be said to extend from near the Wardh\u00e1 river on the north to the Pengang\u00e1 on the south. The beds associated with the coal can be traced throughout; and, although the existence of coal throughout the entire distance has not been proved, there can be little reasonable doubt that it will be found to occur. An examination of the coal capacity of the region was begun in 1875, but the operations were stopped because there appeared no immediate prospect of a market.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate differs very little from that of the Deccan generally, except that in the Payangh\u00e1t valley the hot weather is sometimes exceptionally severe. It sets in early, for the freshness of the short cold season disappears with the crops, when the ground has been laid bare by carrying the harvest; but the heat does not much increase until the end of March. From the 1st of May until the rains set in, about the middle of June, the sun is very powerful, though its effect is not intensified by the scorching winds of Upper India. The nights are comparatively cool throughout, probably because the direct rays of the sun have their influence counteracted by the retentiveness of moisture peculiar to the black soil, and by the evaporation which is always going on. During the rains, the air is moist and cool. In the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t country, above the Ajanta Hills, the thermometer stands\nmuch lower than in the plains. On the loftiest G\u00e1wilgarh Hills, the climate is always temperate; the sanitarium of Chikalda (3777 feet) is on this range, 20 miles from Ellichpur. The average rainfall for the whole Province is not accurately known; it is said to be about 27 inches a year in the valley, and 30 inches above the gh\u00e1ts. The average for the whole region lies between 27 and 40 inches. The rainfall at Ellichpur in 1881 was 28.7 inches, and at Chikalda in the same year, 60 inches. On the G\u00e1wilgarh Hills it is, of course, much heavier than elsewhere. The vital statistics of Ber\u00e1r are fairly reliable. The number of births registered in 1882 was 110,454, or 42 per thousand; number of deaths 77,214, or 29 per thousand. Of the deaths, 3573 were assigned to cholera, 369 to small-pox, and 39,340 to fevers. There were 36 civil hospitals and charitable dispensaries in the Province open in 1882, or 1 to every 492 square miles; in-door patients, 2091; out-door, 178,919; expenditure, \u00a311,401. On sanitation, the six municipalities of Ber\u00e1r spent \u00a35213 in 1882. There is a special vaccination establishment; number of operations, 90,058 in 1881, and 103,517 in 1882. Total cost, \u00a31719 in 1881, and \u00a31706 in 1882.\n\nHistory.\u2014In early times, the greater part of the Deccan, as far northward as the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), was subject to R\u00e1jput princes of the Chal\u00fakya race, whose capital was at Kaly\u00e1n near Gulbargah, from about 1000 to 1200 A.D. R\u00e1m Deo, who was conquered and slain by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, was the last of the Yadava line of kings, who reigned not without fame at Deogarh, the modern Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, down to the end of the 13th century. We may be allowed to guess that Ber\u00e1r was at one period under the sway of Kaly\u00e1n, or of Deogarh, probably of both successively, though the south-eastern District of the old Province may have belonged to the kingdom ruled by the ancient Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s at Warangul. Remains of ancient Hindu architecture attest the received hypothesis that the Province must long have formed part of that principal R\u00e1jput kingdom which occupied the heart of the Deccan. But local tradition tells of independent R\u00e1j\u00e1s who governed Ber\u00e1r from Ellichpur, which is said to take its name from one of them, called R\u00e1j\u00e1 I'l. The same authority states, what may possibly be corroborated by architectural relics, which have yet to be examined by a competent antiquary, that the princes or governors of Ber\u00e1r, immediately before the Muhammadan invasion, were Jains.\n\nIn 1294, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, nephew and son-in-law to the Delhi Emperor Firoz Ghilz\u00e1\u00ed, made his first expedition into the Deccan. After defeating the Yadava Prince R\u00e1m Deo at Deogarh, he is said to have been bought out of the country by a heavy ransom, accompanied by the cession of Ellichpur. Soon after his return to Upper India, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn murdered his uncle and usurped the Delhi throne. Throughout his reign the Deccan was plundered by successive bands of Muham-\nmadans from the north; but on his death, the Hindus seem to have recovered the Provinces previously subject to Deogarh. However, this insurrection was crushed in 1318-19 by Mubarak Ghilzai, when he flayed alive the last Hindu Prince of Deogarh; and Berar has ever since been nominally under the dominion of Muhammadan rulers.\n\nUnder them it has always kept its distinct name; and there is reason to believe that from the first it formed a separate Provincial charge, of course with constant change of boundaries. In 1351, on the death of the Emperor Muhammad Tughlak, the southern Provinces fell away from his house, and for 250 years maintained their independence of Delhi. For the next 130 years, Berar remained under the dominion of the Bahmani kings, so called because the founder of their line was either a Brahman or a Brahman's servant. This man ruled all the Deccan under the title of Ala-ud-din Husain Shah, and divided his kingdom into four Provinces, of which Mahur, Rangarh, and part of Berar formed one.\n\nOn the collapse of this dynasty in 1526, we find Berar one of the five kingdoms into which the Deccan had virtually split up, fairly embarked on a period of independence under the Imad Shahi Princes, whose capital was Ellichpur. The founder of this dynasty had been, it is said, a Kanarese Hindu captured in war, whom Khan Jahangir, Governor of Berar, promoted to high office. He rose to the title of Imad-ul-Mulk, and the command of the Berar forces. But he bequeathed to his successors no share either of his good fortune or ability. An attack by the allied Kings of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar gave Berar to the latter in 1572. The Ahmadnagar dynasty, however, was not destined long to hold possession of the prize. The cession of Berar to the Emperor Akbar by the Ahmadnagar Government took place in 1596. In 1599, the great Emperor himself came down to Burhanpur and organized his recent conquests. Ahmadnagar was taken; and all the country recently annexed, including Berar, was placed under Prince Danyal (the Emperor's son) as viceroy, Berar retaining its separate formation as an imperial subah, of which the extent and revenue are pretty accurately known from the Ain-i-Akbari. The death of Akbar in 1605 distracted for a time the attention of the Mughal Government from their new Province in the Deccan; and Malik Ambar, who represented Nizam Shahi independence at Daulatabad, recovered the greater part of Berar. This man, an Abyssinian by race, is well known as the great revenue administrator of the Upper Deccan. He first made a regular assessment by fixing the Government share in the estimated produce, commuted to money value, says Duff's History of the Marathas; but the native officials of Berar assert that the assessment was on the quality of land, at so much per bigha, said to have been made in 1612. Malik Ambar held his own in these\nparts until he died in 1628. In 1630, the Mughals recovered Ber\u00e1r, and re-established the imperial authority. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n divided his Deccan dominions into two governments, of which one comprised Ber\u00e1r, Payangh\u00e1t, J\u00e1lna, and Kh\u00e1ndesh; but these were soon reunited under one head. The revenue assessment was reorganized, and the *fasli* era introduced from 1637\u201338.\n\nIt is very difficult, and would not be very profitable, to pursue the separate thread of Ber\u00e1r Provincial history through the tangled coil of Deccan warfare, from 1650, when Aurangzeb became Viceroy of the Deccan, until the hour when he died at Ahmadnagar, in 1707. Ber\u00e1r underwent its share of fire and sword, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 plundering and Mughal rack-renting. After Aurangzeb's death, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s consolidated their predominance, and *chauth* and *sardeshm\u00fakhi* were formally granted by the Sayyid Ministers of the Emperor Far\u00fakhsiyyar in 1717, upon the six and a half *subahats* of the Deccan. But, in 1720, Chin Khilich Kh\u00e1n, Viceroy of the Deccan, under the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, won his independence by three victories over the imperial lieutenants, or rather over the armies commanded by the partisans of the Sayyid Ministers who governed in the Emperor's name. Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk had been joined by the Subahd\u00e1r of Ber\u00e1r. The first battle was fought near Burh\u00e1npur in 1721; the second at B\u00e1lapur soon after; and the last decisive victory was gained, in August 1724, at Shakar-Khelda, called *Fateh-Khelda* from that day, in the present Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District. From this date Ber\u00e1r has always been nominally subject to the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d dynasty.\n\nThe material and even moral injury caused to this Province by the wars of the 18th century must have been wide and deep. Described in the *Ain-i-Akbari* as highly cultivated, and in parts populous, supposed by M. de Th\u00e9venot in 1667 to be one of the wealthiest portions of the Empire, it fell on evil days before the close of the 17th century. Cultivation fell off just when the finances were strained by the long wars; the local revenue officers rebelled; the army became mutinous; and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s easily plundered a weak Province, when they had divided its sinews by cutting off its trade. Wherever the Emperor appointed a *j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r*, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s appointed another, and both claimed the revenue, while foragers from each side exacted forced contributions; so that the harassed cultivator often threw up his land, and joined in the general business of plunder. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s succeeded in retaining their hold on this Province; but its resources were ruined, and its people must have been seriously demoralized by a r\u00e9gime of barefaced plunder and fleecing, without pretension to principle or stability. By the partition treaty of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (dated 1804), the whole of Ber\u00e1r, including Districts east of the Wardh\u00e1,\u2014but excluding certain tracts left with the N\u00e1gpur chiefs and the Peshw\u00e1,\u2014was made\nover in perpetual sovereignty to the Niz\u00e1m. The forts of G\u00e1wilgarh and Narnala remained subject to N\u00e1gpur. A fresh treaty was made in 1822, which settled the frontier of Ber\u00e1r, and conferred upon the Niz\u00e1m all the country west of the Wardh\u00e1. The tracts lying east of that river were at length formally ceded to N\u00e1gpur; but the Districts taken by the Peshw\u00e1 in 1795, and those which had been left to N\u00e1gpur in 1803, were all restored to the Niz\u00e1m. The disbanding of large numbers of troops filled the country with gangs of plunderers; and it was sometimes necessary for the British Government to interfere for the preservation of peace, as in 1849, when Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was captured and his followers dispersed. Meanwhile, the Niz\u00e1m's finances had sunk into such a desperate state that in 1843, and in several succeeding years, the pay of the force maintained under the treaty of 1800 had to be advanced from the British Treasury.\n\nThe bankruptcy of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State at length necessitated, in 1853, a new treaty, under which the existing Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent is maintained by the British Government, in lieu of the troops which the Niz\u00e1m had been previously bound to furnish on demand in time of war; while, for the payment of this Contingent, and other claims on the Niz\u00e1m, Districts yielding a gross revenue of 50 l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a3500,000) were assigned to the British Government. There is a garrison of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent now at Ellichpur, consisting of a detachment of 73 cavalry, a battery of artillery with 127 men, and 765 infantry. At Akola and Amr\u00e1oti, two outposts, there are 193 infantry and 113 infantry respectively.\n\nThe territory made over to the British under this treaty comprised, besides the Assigned Districts as they now exist, the Districts of Dhar\u00e1seo and the R\u00e1ichur Do\u00e1b. It was agreed that accounts should be annually rendered to the Niz\u00e1m, and that any surplus revenue should be paid to him. On his part, he was released from the obligation of furnishing a large force in time of war; while the Contingent ceased to be part of the Niz\u00e1m's army, and became an auxiliary force kept by the British Government for his use. The provisions of the treaty of 1853, however, which required the submission of annual accounts of the Assigned Districts to the Niz\u00e1m, were productive of much inconvenience and embarrassing discussions. Difficulties had also arisen regarding the levy of the 5 per cent. duty on goods under the commercial treaty of 1802.\n\nTo remove these difficulties, and at the same time to reward the Niz\u00e1m for his services in 1857, a new treaty was concluded in December 1860, by which a debt of 50 l\u00e1khs due from the Niz\u00e1m was cancelled; the territory of S\u00farapur, which had been confiscated for the rebellion of its Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1, was ceded to the Niz\u00e1m; and the Districts of Dhar\u00e1seo and the R\u00e1ichur Do\u00e1b were restored to\nhim. On the other hand, the Niz\u00e1m ceded certain Districts on the left bank of the God\u00e1vari, traffic on which river was to be free from all duties; and he agreed that the remaining Assigned Districts in Ber\u00e1r, together with other Districts, then yielding a gross revenue of Rs. 3,200,000 (\u00a3320,000), should be held in trust by the British Government for the purposes specified in the treaty of 1853, but that no demand for accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the Assigned Districts should be made. Certain territorial exchanges were also effected, with the object of bringing under British administration those lands within the Assigned Districts which were held in j\u00e1g\u00edr for payment of troops, or which were allotted for the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s privy purse.\n\nThe history of Ber\u00e1r since 1853 is marked by no important political events beside the change made under the treaty of 1861. Its smooth course was scarcely ruffled even by the troubles of 1857; whatever fires may have been smouldering beneath the surface, the country remained calm, measuring its behaviour, not by Delhi, but by Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1858, T\u00e1ntia Top\u00ed reached the S\u00e1tpura Hills, and tried to break across southward that he might stir up the Deccan; but he was headed back at all outlets, and never got away into the Ber\u00e1r valley. The Province has rapidly progressed under British rule. \u2018When it was made over to us,\u2019 writes Sir Richard Temple in his official report, \u2018the neighbouring Districts were full of families who had emigrated thither from Ber\u00e1r, and who, with the usual attachment of the people to their original patrimony, were anxious to return on any suitable opportunity. Thus hundreds of families and thousands of individuals immigrated back into Ber\u00e1r. Many villages in the N\u00e1gpur country lost many of their hands in this way, and were sometimes put to serious straits.\u2019 The American war, which shortly supervened, stimulated the cotton trade to an enormous extent in Ber\u00e1r; wages rapidly rose with the unprecedented demand for labour which followed; and the opening of the Great Indian Peninsula and Nizam\u2019s State Railway systems has tended still further to enhance the prosperity of the Province.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census ever taken in the Province was carried out in November 1867. It disclosed a total population of 2,227,654 persons. The next regular Census, taken in February 1881, returned a population for the whole Province of 2,672,673 persons, an increase of 445,019, or nearly 20 per cent., in 14 years. Area, 17,711 square miles; towns, 34; villages, 5551; occupied houses, 466,027; unoccupied houses, 33,356; towns and villages per square mile, 32; houses per square mile, 28. Of the total population, 1,380,492 were returned as males and 1,292,181 as females; proportion of males 51\u00b77 per cent. The average density of the population in Ber\u00e1r is 151 persons per square mile,\u2014a number higher than in any Division\nof the neighbouring Central Provinces, though far below the average (416) of the North-Western Provinces. Akola stands first as regards its urban and its total population. In it and in Amr\u0101oti District, the density is over 200 to the square mile. In W\u00fcn the density is only 100. Towns and villages are most numerous in Ellichpur taluk, where there are 45 to each square mile; in Melgh\u00e1t there is only one village to every 5 square miles. There are now in Ber\u00e1r the same number of houses per square mile (28) as there were in England and Wales eighty years ago; the number of persons to each occupied house (5\u00b77) is about the same in both countries. The increase in the population since 1867 is largely due to immigration from Kh\u00e1ndesh, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Deccan), and the Central Provinces. It is observed by the Census authorities (1881) that although there is a tendency in the Ber\u00e1r population to concentrate in large villages, there is no marked tendency, except in Akola District, for the large villages to grow into towns. About 12 per cent. of the population are urban, in the sense that they inhabit towns containing more than 5000 inhabitants.\n\nHinduism is the religion of Ber\u00e1r, being professedly nearly 91 per cent. of the population. Siva is the chief deity in this region, as Vishnu is the deity of the nations on the Ganges. Among the great gods of the Hindu pantheon, Balaj\u00ed (an avdtar, or incarnation, of Vishnu), Mah\u00e1deo, Ganpati, and Devi are objects of popular worship. Hanum\u00e1n (the monkey god, who led the monkey host to Lanka or Ceylon in aid of R\u00e1m\u00e1) and Arjun are also worshipped. The Muhammadans, P\u00e1rs\u00eds, Jains, and Christians number together about 10 per cent. of the population. According to the Census, there were in Ber\u00e1r in 1881\u2014Hindus, 2,425,654; Muhammadans, 187,555; Jains, 20,020; Christians, 1335; Sikhs, 525; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 242; aborigines, 37,338; and \u2018others,\u2019 4. The Hindus were thus distributed as regards caste:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 65,754; R\u00e1jputs, 40,174; Khetris, 3959; Wanis (Baniy\u00e1s), 67,071; Kunb\u00eds (agriculturists), 834,174; M\u00e1lis (gardeners), 219,671; Mahars (mixed castes), 307,994; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 75,552; Dhangars (shepherds), 74,559; Banj\u00e1ras (carriers), 60,511; Kolis (labourers), 30,398; Sut\u00e1rs (carpenters), 30,314; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 14,265; Lohars (blacksmiths), 13,883; Vidurs (half-castes), 11,747; Kal\u00e1ls (distillers), 14,943; Shimpis or Darzis (tailors), 15,509; Pardhis (huntsmen), 3008; Manbhaos (mendicants), 4111; Bairagis (mendicants), 1529; N\u00e1ths (mendicants), 716; Chambhars (leather-workers), 26,885; Mahalis (barbers), 33,517; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 20,006; miscellaneous, 291,885; and aboriginal tribes (Bh\u00edls, Gonds, Korkus, etc.), 163,519.\n\nThe Muhammadans were thus sub-divided according to sect:\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 185,686; Shiahs, 1360; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 39; and \u2018others,\u2019 470; and according to tribe as follows:\u2014Shaikhs, 125,178; Path\u00e1ns, 37,633;\nSayyids, 9135; Mughals, 2788; Arabs, 25; Fak\u00edrs, 1397; 'others,' 11,399. Since 1867 the Muhammadans of Ber\u00e1r have increased 21 per cent.\n\nOf the total number of Christians in Ber\u00e1r (1335), British-born subjects numbered 97; other British, 105; other Europeans or Americans, 12; Eurasians, 542; and natives, 579. Adopting a classification by creed, there were in 1881\u2014Church of England, 583; Roman Catholic, 620; Presbyterian, 71; 'others,' 61. Many of the native Christians in Ber\u00e1r are Madr\u00e1si and Portuguese (Goanese) domestic servants. There are churches and chapels at Amr\u00e1oti, Akola, and Ellichpur.\n\nAmong the Hindus the chief Sivaite sects are the Smartas (40,606), the Lingayats (19,338), and the N\u00e1ths (9113): the chief Vishnuite sects are the Vaishnavas (11,933), the Bhagawats (3707), and the Manbh\u00e1os (5958). The Smartas are the Br\u00e1hman followers of Sankar Ach\u00e1rya, the Sivaite reformer of the ninth century. The Lingayats, who worship the linga or emblem of Siva, are chiefly traders. Pink is their sacred colour, and every male Lingayat should wear at least one garment of this hue: for a female it matters not. Jangam is the term applied to the Lingayat priestly order. The sect observe no ritual and reject the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. The N\u00e1ths, or 'hail-averters,' are properly coenobite ascetics, and in early times exhibited Buddhistic leanings. They are now mostly fortune-tellers and mountebanks. The Manbh\u00e1os are a Vaishnava sect, founded about two hundred years ago. Among them the re-marriage of widows is allowed. The Muhammadans are divided into Shariyat, or the ordinary followers of the Prophet's precepts, and Tariyakat, or his ascetic disciples. There are four schools of the former\u2014Hanafis, Shafais, Hambalis, and Malikis, distinguished by different ways of using their hands in prayer. The Bohoras (Borahs) are heterodox Shiahs. Many of the Bombay traders belong to this sect. They are said to have their origin at Burhanpur, and all good Borahs desire to lay their bones in that city. The Jains in Ber\u00e1r are of greater antiquity than the Muhammadans, and Jain princes are said to have reigned at Kaliy\u00e1n. The Jain is enjoined to perform five duties and to avoid five sins. The duties are\u2014(1) mercy to all animated beings; (2) almsgiving; (3) venerating their sages while living and worshipping their images when deceased; (4) confession of faults; (5) and religious fasting. The sins to be avoided are\u2014(1) killing; (2) lying; (3) stealing; (4) adultery; (5) and worldly-mindedness. The number of Jains in Ber\u00e1r has more than doubled since the last Census (1867). The P\u00e1rs\u00eds are mostly residents of the towns; they have a fire-temple at Akola and a Tower of Silence for funeral purposes near Bal\u00e1pur. Many of the P\u00e1rs\u00eds are in railway employment.\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 distributes the adult male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and members of the learned professions, 40,000; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 12,956; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, and carriers, 27,263; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including shepherds, 692,366; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 141,617; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including all male children, general labourers, and persons of unspecified occupation, 465,300.\n\nThe Province of Ber\u00e1r contained (1881)\u20142225 towns with under two hundred inhabitants; 1883, with from two to five hundred; 962, with from five hundred to one thousand; 356, with from one to two thousand; 72, with from two to three thousand; 53, with from three to five thousand; 24, with from five to ten thousand; 6, with from ten to fifteen thousand; 2, with from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 2, with from twenty to fifty thousand;\u2014in all, 5585 towns and villages.\n\nWith regard to education, the Census of 1881 returned 27,347 males and 356 females as under instruction; 57,827 males and 789 females as not under instruction but able to read and write; and 1,295,318 males and 1,291,036 females as not under instruction and unable to read and write.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The agriculturists form by far the largest part of the population of Ber\u00e1r. In 1881, out of every 10,000 males productively employed, 7317 were agriculturists. The common land tenure of the country is by cultivation occupancy: the exceptional tenures are known as j\u00e1g\u00edr, ij\u00e1ra, and in\u00e1m. The j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs hold rent-free one or more villages under patents from the Delhi emperors, the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, or the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Peshw\u00e1. The number of j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs in 1881 was 161. The villages held under this tenure occupied an area of 385,748 acres and numbered 218. The ij\u00e1r\u00e1dd\u00e1r, or Government lessee, farms an integral waste village, but pays no assessment for the first three years. As the land is brought under cultivation, rent has to be paid. The number of ij\u00e1r\u00e1dd\u00e1rs in 1881 was 64. Indams are rent-free grants of fields for religious or charitable purposes\u2014for the maintenance of temples, shrines, guest-houses, and the like. Their number in 1881 was 1437. The general occupancy tenant of Ber\u00e1r, known as khated\u00e1r, holds a surveyed and marked-off plot of land assessed at rates fixed for 30 years. The khated\u00e1rs hold direct from the State, and are almost absolute proprietors of their lands. Their number in 1881 was 162,540.\n\nThe Ber\u00e1r cultivator follows a primitive system of rotation of crops. He manures very little, though as much as he can, since he is obliged to use so much dung for fuel that he has little to spare for his fields.\nGood cultivable land is never enclosed for hay and pasture, though plenty of grass is cut and stacked from wide uncultivated tracts; and the working bullocks are well fed, partly on this hay, more generally on the jodr stalks, a little on cotton seed. Large droves of cattle, sheep, and goats graze on commons and barren wolds. From wells the cultivators irrigate patches of wheat, sugar-cane, opium, and market-garden produce. At places they obtain water from small reservoirs and surface streams, especially under the hills and to the southward. But in the Ber\u00e1r valley, which contains the richest land, water is scarce even for the drinking of man and beast; there is a dearth of grass and wood; hired labour is insufficient and dear.\n\nCapital in agricultural hands is scanty. The cultivators are slowly (though surely) emerging out of chronic debt. Agriculture is supported by the good-will with which all small money-lenders invest in it, because there are no other handy investments which pay so well as lending on bond to the farmers. Cultivation is obliged to support the peasant and his family, to pay the State revenue, to return the capital invested with not less than 18 per cent interest to the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri money-lender, and to furnish the court fees on litigation whenever the rustic sees a chance of evading his bond. But the petty cultivator keeps his hold of the land; no one can make so much out of it as he can; and he is much aided by the customs of metayer tenancy and joint-stock co-operative cultivation, which enable him to get cattle, labour, and even a little cash on favourable terms. He is fond of arrack or the black liquor distilled from the mahu\u00e1 flower. This he buys at from 3d. to 1s. per quart. On the whole, the Ber\u00e1r cultivator is lazy and easy-going, starts late to his field and returns early. Neither hope of great profits nor fear of ruin will drive him to do the full day's work which is extracted from the English farm labourer.\n\nThree varieties of tenant are found in Ber\u00e1r. These are the tenant paying a money rent, the tenant paying rent in kind on the batai or metayer system of produce-partnership, and the tenant-at-will (pot-laonid\u00e1r) who pays his rent in kind or money, the landlord meeting the revenue demand. The metayer tenure is very common in Ber\u00e1r. These are its ordinary terms\u2014the registered occupant of the holding pays the assessment, but makes the holding entirely over to the metayer, and receives as rent half the crop after it has been cleaned and made ready for market. Sometimes the metayer deducts the seed before dividing the grain. The metayer finds all the necessaries for cultivation. In 1881, the number of metayer tenures was 9503.\n\nThe average size of a holding in Ber\u00e1r was 24 acres in 1870, and 42 acres in 1881. The area actually under crops in 1881\u201382 was estimated at 6,641,023 acres, and 6,567,323 acres in 1882\u201383. Jodr and cotton are the staple crops of the Province, occupying respectively 34'6 and\n32.5 per cent. of the entire cultivated area in the latter year. The other principal crops are wheat (11.3 per cent.) and inferior grains, oil-seeds and fibres. Sugar-cane and tobacco are also grown to a small extent. Only 47,163 acres were under irrigation in 1882-83. The cultivation of wheat and linseed is said to be extending in the Province. The cultivation of the poppy for opium was prohibited in 1878-79, and opium for consumption has since that year been imported by rail, and only to the towns of Amr\u0101oti and Khamg\u0101on. The amount of licensed opium imported in 1882 was 44,380 lbs., and paid an import duty of \u00a322,190. The consumption, on an average, of every 100 of the population is 1 lb. 9 oz. of the drug. G\u00e1nja, an intoxicating preparation of hemp, is also cultivated, chiefly for the use of religious mendicants. Area under g\u00e1nja was 143 acres in 1881, and 89 acres in 1882. There is a Government farm at Akola, where numerous interesting agricultural experiments have been carried out. The area under the different crops is thus shown in 1882-83:\u2014Jodr, 2,276,220 acres; b\u00e1jra, 92,322 acres; wheat, 746,391 acres; rice, 22,827 acres; gram, 177,893 acres; linseed, 397,639 acres; t\u012bl, 147,391 acres; hemp, 8898 acres; tobacco, 24,722 acres; sugar-cane, 4530 acres; cotton, 2,139,188 acres; and miscellaneous produce, the remainder. The average rental of cotton land is 1s. 1d. per acre; wheat and oil-seed land, 2s. to 2s. 3d.; tobacco land, 3s. 4d.; and land under sugar-cane, 8s. 8\u00bdd. per acre. The yield per acre of the different crops is as follows:\u2014Rice, 161 lbs.; wheat, 305 lbs.; jodr, 374 lbs.; gram, 258 lbs.; cotton (cleaned), 51 lbs.; oil-seeds, 164 lbs.; and tobacco, 287 lbs. These figures refer to 1881-82. The statistics for 1882-83 are as follows:\u2014Average rental of land for cotton, 2s.; oil-seeds, 1s. 1\u00bdd.; tobacco, 3s. 1\u00bdd.; jodr, 2s.; wheat, 2s. 2\u00bdd.; rice, 2s. 1\u00bdd.; and the yield per acre of rice, 287 lbs.; wheat, 470 lbs.; jodr, 374 lbs.; gram, 296 lbs.; cotton (cleaned), 44 lbs.; oil-seeds, 380 lbs.; and tobacco, 422 lbs.\n\nAverage prices of produce in 1881-82 were returned as follows:\u2014Clean cotton, 45s. per cwt.; wheat, 5s. 4d. per cwt.; gram, 4s. per cwt.; rice, 10s. 2d. per cwt.; jodr, 3s. 4d. per cwt.; oil-seeds, 7s. 2d. per cwt.; and tobacco, 32s. per cwt. Wages in the same year varied from 1s. 3d. to 2s. a day for skilled labour, and from 4d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem for unskilled labour.\n\nManufactures and Trade.\u2014A rich agricultural Province like Ber\u00e1r finds it more profitable to raise raw produce to pay for imported manufactures, than to pursue manufactures of its own. Cotton cloth, chiefly of the coarser kinds, some stout carpets, and ch\u00e1rj\u00e1mahs, or saddles, are made within the Province. A little silk-weaving goes on, and the dyes are good at certain places. At Dewalgh\u00e1t, near Buld\u00e1na, steel is forged of fair quality. N\u00e1gpur supplies fine\ncloths; nearly all articles of furniture or luxury come from the west.\n\nDuring 1882-83, there were 16 steam cotton-presses at work in Ber\u00e1r, and 1 oil-press worked by steam. The cotton-presses turned out 282,888 bales of cotton; and the oil-press 27,701 gallons of oil. The presses are superintended by 14 Europeans, and afford employment to\u2014men, 961; women, 120. There are also hand-looms throughout the Province, but the indigenous unskilled handicrafts cannot compete with English and Bombay made piece-goods.

Similarly of the exports, 96\u00b75 per cent. were conveyed by rail, and 3\u00b75 per cent. by road. In 1882-83, the railroad carried 83 per cent. of the imports, and 89 per cent. of the exports. The chief imports are rice, salt, sugar, spices, cocoa-nuts, liquors, cotton twist, piece-goods, silk fabrics, coals, oil, timber, and gunny-bags; chief exports\u2014raw cotton, wheat, and oil-seeds. The bulk of the Ber\u00e1r trade is with Bombay and Districts lying west of the Province, and next in order with the Central Provinces. The two principal marts are Amr\u00e1oti and Khamg\u00e1on. The\ninternal trade is mostly carried on at weekly markets and annual fairs. Of the latter there are 31, the most crowded being that of Deulg\u00e1on in Buld\u00e1na District.\n\nThe following quantities of goods were exported and imported in 1881-82 and 1882-83:\u2014Imports (1881-82)\u20141,629,171 maunds, viz. by rail, 1,285,059; and by road, 344,112: exports\u20144,421,710 maunds, viz. by rail, 4,341,946; and by road, 79,764. Imports (1882-83)\u20143,102,454 maunds, viz. by rail, 1,611,126; and by road, 1,491,328: exports\u20144,402,510 maunds, viz. by rail, 4,209,270; and by road, 193,240.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Province of Ber\u00e1r is administered under the orders of the Resident of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, by one Revenue and Fiscal Commissioner, and one Judicial Commissioner. It is now divided for purposes of administration into 6 Districts, which are again sub-divided into 22 tahsils, or revenue and judicial Sub-divisions, with an average area of 810 square miles each. There are no tributary or feudatory States, and no Government or wards\u2019 estates in the Province. The Revenue Commissioner is the head of the local administration, while the Judicial Commissioner exercises the powers of a Civil and Sessions Judge, and superintends the working of the courts of justice in all their departments, subject to such instructions and limitations as the Resident may from time to time prescribe. As the sovereignty is that of a native prince, the Acts of the Indian Legislature in force in Ber\u00e1r are made to apply by order of the Governor-General in Council in his executive capacity, on the recommendation of the Resident. The Resident at the Court of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d stands in the position of Chief Commissioner of Ber\u00e1r, directly subordinate to the Government of India. The other administrative officers of the Province are\u20146 Deputy Commissioners, 17 Assistant Commissioners, 9 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 Inspector-General of Police, who is also Inspector-General of Jails and Registration, 6 District Superintendents of Police, 2 Assistant Superintendents of Police, 1 Sanitary Commissioner, who is also Inspector-General of Dispensaries and Vaccination, 6 Civil Surgeons, 1 Director of Public Instruction, 1 Conservator of Forests, 3 Assistant Conservators of Forests, and 1 Sub-Assistant Conservator of Forests. There were 60 Magistrates in 1882, and 69 in 1883, most of them exercising civil and revenue powers. The average distance of each village from the nearest court is 28 miles.\n\nThe principal towns of Ber\u00e1r are Amraoti 23,550; Akola, 16,614; Akot, 16,137; Anjangaon, 9842; Balapur, 11,244; Basim, 11,576; Devalgaon, 7025; Ellichpur, 26,728; Hiwarkhed, 7300; Jalgaon, 10,392; Karinja, 10,923; Khamgaon, 12,390; Karasgaon, 7330; Malkapur, 8152; Paratwara, 9445; Pathur, 7219; Sendurjana,\nHAIDARABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS.\n\n8501; SHEGAON, 11,079; YEOTMAL, 2420. The following are municipalities:\u2014Amr\u00e1oti, Akola, Kh\u00e1mg\u00e1on, Sheg\u00e1on, Ellichpur, and B\u00e1s\u00edm. Total municipal population, 101,937 in 1881. The total number of committee men was 87, of whom 37 were Europeans; 43 were non-officials. Income, \u00a310,332 in 1881, and \u00a310,922 in 1882; market dues in 1882 contributed \u00a33034, and town fund, \u00a32662. The town fund is a tax on trades and professions. Incidence of municipal taxation in 1882, 8\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMar\u00e1thi is the vernacular of the Province, except in a small tract in the south-east corner, where Telugu is spoken.\n\nThe land revenue demand in 1881\u201382 was \u00a3635,775, and the gross revenue \u00a3847,766. Subjoined is a table showing the contributions to these totals from the several Districts, with the population of each as ascertained by the Census of 1881:\n\n| Name of District | Area in Sq.

The total expenditure in the same year was \u00a3892,894, of which \u00a3336,260 were spent on the military establishments (Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent), \u00a3368,858 on the civil administration, and \u00a3122,549 on public works and railways. The receipts from railways in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a337,509, or 3 per cent. on the capital (\u00a31,222,779) invested, as against 2\u00b73 per cent. in 1881, and 1\u00b78 per cent. in 1880. Passengers carried, 401,085 in 1882; goods carried, 89,293 tons in the same year.\n\nFrom the very outset the work of education in the Assigned Districts seems to have been fostered by Government without any local assistance. No independent exertion on the part of the people preceded the introduction of the State system; and great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining the support of the leading individuals, whether in town or village. The school-going male population (between 4 and 15 years) is estimated at 321,432, for whom there are (1882) 896 schools of all kinds, with 35,891 scholars. There is thus 1 school for every 19 square miles of area, and 11 per cent. of\nthe school-going male population is under instruction. The number of schools has risen from 224 in 1867 to 896 in 1882. Of the 896 schools in the latter year, 477 are Government, with 28,950 scholars; 212 are aided, with 4269 scholars; and 207 are unaided, with 2672 scholars. Of the Government schools, 2 are high schools, 5 middle-class schools, and the rest primary schools. There is one normal school, with 79 pupils. In 1883, the number of schools had slightly decreased, but not the number of pupils:\u2014number of schools (1883), 889; number of pupils, 36,278. In 1883, the average number of pupils to each school was 40. The ratio of female pupils to the female school-going population was '3. In point of education, Wun District is now most behind-hand, having one school to every 50 square miles of area; while in Akola District there is one school to every 10 square miles. The expenditure on education in Ber\u00e1r was \u00a333,931 in 1881\u201382, and \u00a335,683 in 1882\u201383. Of the latter sum, an educational cess supplied \u00a39564, and voluntary subscriptions \u00a312. School fees amounted to \u00a32212. There are 114 gymnasiaums in the province. It is noted with satisfaction by the educational authorities that the higher and lower caste pupils are beginning to mingle more freely in the class-rooms.\n\nThe police force in 1881\u201382 consisted of 2636 officers and men, costing \u00a349,780, of which \u00a348,086 was debited to Provincial and \u00a31694 to municipal funds. These figures show one policeman to every 1015 of the population. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 74. There is no organized police force in the Melgh\u00e1t, where the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s receive an allowance for keeping order. Of the regular police of Ber\u00e1r, 1298 are provided with firearms. Number of persons arrested by the police (1880), 8718; convicted, 5204. The number arrested in 1882 was 3676; convicted, 2629.\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad).\u2014District in the Province of Sind, Bombay Presidency, lying between 24\u00b0 13' and 27\u00b0 15' N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 51' and 69\u00b0 22' E. long. Bounded on the north by Khairpur State; on the east by the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District; on the south by the same tract and the river Kori; and on the west by the river Indus and Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District. Area, 9030 square miles; population (1881) 754,624.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is a vast alluvial plain, 216 miles long by 48 broad. Fertile along the course of the Indus, which forms its western boundary, it degenerates towards the east into sandy wastes, sparsely populated, and defying cultivation. The monotony of its great flats is relieved only by the fringe of forest which marks the course of the river, and by the avenues of trees that line the irrigation channels branching eastward from the beneficent stream. The Tando Deputy Collectorate, in the south of the District, has a special feature\nin its large natural watercourses, called *dhoras*, and basin-like shallows, or *chhaus*, which retain the rain for a time sufficient to nourish the hardy *babul* trees on their margins. In the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d *t\u00e1luk*, a limestone range, called the G\u00e1nja, and the pleasant frequency of garden lands, break the unvaried landscape. Except in these two divisions, the District is an unrelieved plain; its western side, however, intersected by canals; its eastern, beyond the limits of artificial irrigation, a sandy waste. The soil, wherever irrigated, is very fertile. The chief indigenous forest trees are the *pipal* (*Ficus religiosa*), *nim* (*Azadirachta Indica*), *t\u00e1li* or blackwood (*Dalbergia latifolia*), *sirih* (*Albizzia lebbek*), *ber* (*Zizyphus jujuba*), *bdhan* (*Populus euphratica*), *bar* (*Ficus Indica*), *kandi* (*Prosopis spicigera*), *ged\u00fari* (*Cordia latifolia*), *babul* (*Acacia Arabica*), with several varieties of tamarisks. In a District so grudgingly treated by Nature, an extensive fauna is not to be looked for. The hy\u00e6na, wolf, fox, jackal, the smaller deer, and the hog almost complete the list of wild animals. Among birds, the *til\u00far* (lesser bustard) is remarkable, and most of the wild duck and water-fowl of Europe are to be met with during the cold season. Venomous reptiles abound. The Indus supplies a great variety of fish, one of which, the *pala*, is said to be peculiar to this river.\n\n**History.**\u2014The history of Sind, since 1768, centres in this District, for all the events of the last century affected more or less nearly Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, the modern capital of the Province. Under its old name of Nerankot, this city was, in the 8th century, sufficiently important to be the first object of Muhammad K\u00e1sim\u2019s invasion of Lower Sind. A hundred years later, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, the Kalhora chief, burst out from the desert, overthrew his usurping brothers, and made Nerankot, then renamed Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, his capital. Thenceforth this District assumes a foremost place in Provincial history. Under the T\u00e1lpur dynasty it remained the leading State; and within its limits were fought the battles of Mi\u00e1ni (Meeanee) and Dabo, which decided (1843) in the British favour the fate of Sind. Its local history is, however, so mixed up with that of the Province, that little could be here said of it separately which will not more properly find a place under the history of Sind. The area and boundaries of the District have not been changed since 1861; but prior to that date, the Umarkot District (now under the Thar and P\u00e1rkar Political Superintendent) and a large portion of the eastern delta (now part of the Sh\u00e1hbandar Deputy Collectorate) were included within Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The *pargan\u00e1s* of Kandi\u00e1ro and Naush\u00e1hro were resumed by Government in 1852, from the domains of Mir Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d of Khairpur, on his public conviction for forgery and fraud, and transferred to this Collectorate.\n\n**Population.**\u2014According to the general Census of 1872, the population of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District was divided as follows:\u2014Muhammadans,\n560,349; Hindus, 118,652; other creeds and tribes, 44,882; total, 723,883. The Census of 1881 returned the population as follows:\u2014Males, 407,243; females, 347,381; total, 754,624 persons, dwelling on an area of 9030 square miles, in 2 towns and 1103 villages, and occupying 150,488 houses. Number of persons per square mile, 83; villages per square mile, 0.12; houses per square mile, 21; persons per house, 5.0. Classified according to religion, there were 89,114 Hindus, 594,485 Muhammadans, principally of the Sunn\u00ee sect (583,604); 428 Christians, 144 Jains, 21 P\u00e2rs\u00ees, 31 Jews, 42,940 Sikhs, and 27,461 aborigines. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e2hmans number 2739; R\u00e2jputs, 571; Loh\u00e2nas, 72,797; other Hindu castes, 13,007.\n\nOf the Muhammadans, more than three-fifths, or 392,472, are Sind\u00eds of the Halpotro, Junejo, Dul, Pow\u00e1r, Thebo, Sumro, Sand, Kat\u00eey\u00e1r, and other clans,\u2014the descendants of the original Hindu population converted to Isl\u00e1m during the Ummayide dynasty of Kh\u00e1l\u00eef\u00e2s. The Sind\u00eds have a fine physique, but an inferior moral character, being reputed cowardly, although quiet and inoffensive; they are looked down upon by the more warlike tribes of the District as natural serfs. Their language is Sind\u00ed, of the Sanskrit family of speech, and more closely connected with the Pr\u00e1krit than either Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Hind\u00ed, Panj\u00e1b\u00ed, or Beng\u00e1li. It has three dialects, all of which meet in this District as on common ground\u2014namely, the lari, or dialect of Southern Sind; the siraiki of the north; and the thareli, 'the language of the desert.'\n\nNext in point of numbers among the Muhammadans are the Bal\u00fach\u00eds (129,482), sub-divided into a great number of tribes, the chief being the Rind, Bh\u00fagti, Chang, T\u00e1lpur, Jatoi, Lagh\u00e1ri, Ch\u00e1ndio, Kaloi, Khoso, Jakr\u00e1ni, Lash\u00e1ri. They are descended from the mountain tribes of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, through whom they trace their origin to Aleppo in Syria. Their leading clan is the Rind, and its members are held by the rest of the community in high respect. Fairer in complexion than the Sind\u00eds, they are also a harder race; honourable after their own code, and manly in field-sports. They are Sunnis by sect. More important, however, as regards social status and personal character are the Path\u00e1ns (2810), found chiefly about Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Upper Sind, with the naturalized Sayyids (14,572), divided into four families, the Bokh\u00e1ri, Mat\u00e1ri, Shir\u00e1zi, and Lekhir\u00e1ji. Together they number in this District 17,382 persons. They are superior to the foregoing in personal appearance and morale. From their being held in great esteem by the princes of the Kalhora dynasty, they acquired considerable grants of land, which they still hold. The remaining Muhammadan classes worthy of special mention are the following:\u2014(1) Memons, formerly Kachh\u00ed-Hindus, who emigrated to Sind under the Kalhora rule, and devoted themselves to agriculture\nand cattle-breeding. They now supply a learned class, who have done more than any other to introduce sacred learning into Sind, and are accordingly held in high respect. (2) The Khw\u00e1jas, fugitives from Persia when their creed (the Ism\u00e1ilyeh heresy) was persecuted by Hal\u00e1ku Kh\u00e1n. They have isolated themselves from all the other Muhammadans of the District, not only by maintaining their own special tribunal in religious differences, and separate officers (Mukhi, etc.), but by the singularity of their dress, in which they avoid dark blue, the colour of the country. The Memons and Khw\u00e1jas aggregate about 13,000. (3) S\u00eddh\u00eds, natives of Maskat (Muscat), Zanzibar, and Abyssinia, who until the British Conquest were bought and sold as slaves. (4) The Shik\u00e1ris or Daphers of Tando, a small number. Though Muhammadans they eat carrion, and are excluded from the mosques.\n\nThe subordinate ranks of Government service are almost exclusively recruited from the Loh\u00e1nos, and the vast majority of Hindu shopkeepers and traders also belong to this caste. In their complex sub-divisions, they are mixed up with the Muhammadans. Although wearing the thread, they become the disciples of Musalm\u00e1n teachers, assume their dress, eat meat, drink spirits, and disregard all the customs of orthodox Hindus with regard to receiving food from inferiors, etc. Their marriage ceremonies are so expensive that many remain single till late in life.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the males of the District were returned as follows:\u2014Class I., or professional, 4378; Class II., or domestic, 5381; Class III., or commercial, 5114; Class IV., or agricultural, 158,886; Class V., or industrial, 44,460; and Class VI., or indefinite, 189,024. The most numerous guilds are\u2014the son\u00e1rs or goldsmiths, who, owing to the popular taste for ornaments, are, as a rule, well-to-do; moch\u00eds or shoemakers, who will not, however, skin carcase or tan leather, but buy it from Muhammadans; kh\u00e1t\u00eds or dyers; and hajdms or barbers. They have all adopted the thread, intermarry only in their own castes, and have no priests but Br\u00e1hmans. Nevertheless they are held in Sind in no higher estimation than elsewhere.\n\nBr\u00e1hmans of pure descent are not numerous in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, their aggregate number being under 4000; but their acknowledged superiority to the castes around them invests their small community with importance and interest. They are divided into two chief septs, which do not intermarry\u2014the Pok\u00e1rno and S\u00e1rsudh. The former are the more orthodox Hindus, refusing flesh, wearing the turban and never the Sind cap, reading Sanskrit, abstemious in habit, and employing themselves only in instructing the Hindus in their religious duties, or deciding for them questions of horoscope and ceremonial. The S\u00e1rsudh, though not abstaining\naltogether from meat, conform sufficiently to the traditional usages of high-caste Hinduism to be held in great respect, not only by inferior castes of Hindus, but also by the Sikhs. The Sikhs so called are in reality a nondescript class, recruited from both Hindus and Muhammadans, containing, however, a percentage of veritable followers of N\u00e1nak. They are divided into two well-defined sects, the Loh\u00e1no Sikh and the Akali or Kh\u00e1lsa, which differ in certain details of food and shaving the hair. Their devotions are conducted in the Punj\u00e1b\u00ed language, and their holy books, the Adi Granth, etc., are in the guardianship of appointed uhd\u00e1s\u00eds, in special dharms\u00e1l\u00e1s. The religious mendicant classes of the District are those of India generally\u2014the yellow-clothed Sany\u00e1s\u00eds, Jog\u00eds, and Gos\u00e1ins, who subsist by begging and by the sale of amulets and written charms. All the Hindus, except the mendicants, who are either buried or thrown into the river, according to their testamentary wish, burn their dead with complex funeral rites.\n\nIn attire, dwellings, and food, the people of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d do not differ from the general population of the Province. Both Muhammadans and Hindus are addicted to g\u00e1nja, an intoxicating preparation of hemp; and the lowest classes of the latter consume country spirits largely. Opium is much used, and its use is said to be on the increase. As regards occupation, the Hindus of the District may be called the shopkeeping class; the Muhammadans, the artisan and agricultural. The Hindu Baniy\u00e1 is astute in business, supple with his superiors, industrious, timid; the Muhammadan is idle, improvident, and often licentious, but more independent and outspoken, and of a finer physique. The two chief towns of the District are Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, population (1881) 48,153 (including the cantonment population, 2958), and M\u00e1t\u00e1ri (5054). Of the towns and villages of the District, 257 contained under 200 inhabitants, 141 from 200 to 500, 497 from 500 to 1000, 164 from 1000 to 2000, 24 from 2000 to 3000, 17 from 3000 to 5000, 4 from 5000 to 10,000, and one over 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of the District, nearly one-third is uncultivable; 3,678,544 acres are cultivable though not cultivated, and 1,060,520 are (1881\u201382) under cultivation. In 1882\u201383, the area cultivable but not cultivated was 2,277,832 acres; area cultivated, 997,628 acres; fallow, 320,144 acres. Agriculture in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is entirely dependent upon artificial irrigation, and is regarded as a lottery in which the cultivator stakes his labour and seed on the chance of getting an exactly suitable flood. If the water rises too high, or not sufficiently high, the cultivator loses his crop. Wells of great depth are used to irrigate garden land. There are in the District 325 canals, all of which are Government property. In addition to these, there are numerous smaller canals and water-\ncourses, the property of j\u0101gird\u0101rs and samind\u0101rs. Forty of the Government canals are main channels, which tap the Indus direct; the remainder are connecting branches. The revenue derived from this source is very steady, never having risen above \u00a3104,514 nor fallen below \u00a393,423 between the years 1864 and 1874. The cost of clearance has, however, been equally regular, and during the same decade has reduced the net annual income by an average of \u00a322,000.\n\nThe irrigation carried on in the District by means of canals may be divided into three classes\u2014(1) \u2018Lift,\u2019 where the water has to be raised from the river or from a canal by means of machinery; (2) \u2018Flow,\u2019 where during the inundation the water from a canal flows by gravitation through side channels over lands favourably situated; (3) \u2018Spill,\u2019 where the land lies so low as to be subject to uncontrolled inundation during the rise of the river. These three classes are known in Sindhi as (1) charkhi, (2) mok, (3) saildb. The first mode is, of course, the most expensive, but it is also by far the most certain, and the greater portion of the kharif crops (with the exception of rice) is irrigated by this method. The second affords during favourable inundations facilities for raising much larger crops with the same amount of capital, and with less labour than is possible with \u2018lift.\u2019 In an unfavourable inundation, however, \u2018flow\u2019 has often to be supplemented by \u2018lift,\u2019 and if this be not done, the failure, partial or total, of the crop is the result. The third is risky to a great degree, and is rarely had recourse to for kharif cultivation, except in the case occasionally of rice lands. Excellent rabi crops are, however, raised on saildb lands, the area available for such cultivation being, of course, entirely dependent on the character of the inundation. Unless a canal fails to carry its proper supply, a thing happily of rare occurrence, irrigation by \u2018lift,\u2019 or by \u2018flow with lift,\u2019 may be looked on as practically quite safe. Irrigation by \u2018unaided flow\u2019 is always more or less risky; whilst the cultivation of saildb lands partakes to a great extent of the nature of a lottery, in which, however, prizes are not infrequent.\n\nThree varieties of the Persian wheel are in use\u2014(1) the ndl or Persian wheel proper, for the working of which one pair of bullocks or a single camel is required; (2) the hurlo, a modified form of the Persian wheel, for which one bullock is sufficient; (3) the perd\u012b (rarely met with), which is worked by the feet. The relative powers of the three are as 20, 11, and 4. To keep a ndl going day and night several pairs of bullocks or camels will be required, and so with the other varieties. In the northernmost \u1e6d\u016bluk of the District (Kandi\u0101ro), in parts of which the water lies comparatively near the surface, there is a considerable area of wheat cultivation watered by wells. Wells here are numerous, and their number is increasing. Elsewhere in the\nDistrict, well cultivation is confined almost exclusively to garden lands. The area under garden produce in 1882-83 was 5073 acres.\n\nThe canals begin to fill about May in proportion to the annual rise of the Indus, and are again dry by October; some are, however, in a fair way of becoming perennial.\n\nOnly two crop seasons are recognised by the Revenue Department, namely, the kharif or inundation crop, sown from May to July, and reaped from September to November; and the rabi or spring crop, sown in November and December, and reaped in March and April. The kharif crop occupied in 1882-83 an area of 937,716 acres; and the rabi, 40,501 acres. Of the kharif area, 716,072 acres were irrigated by 'lift;' 42,186 acres by 'flow;' and 179,459 acres were under rice. Of the rabi area, 1845 acres were irrigated by 'lift;' while of the remaining rabi area, 38,656 acres were irrigated by 'spill;' or the saildo method. When heavy rain falls, either kharif or rabi crops, or both, according to the time of the rainfall, are raised on lands thus saturated. This is called bardni cultivation. In the vast tracts of waste lands lying to the eastward of the District, and untouched by canal water, extensive dams of earth are thrown up in favourable situations to intercept the drainage and so secure the more perfect saturation of the soil lying above them. Cultivation thus carried on is called bandh bardni. In 1882-83, the area under the bardni methods of irrigation was 12,592 acres. The kharif crops are jodr, bajra, til (sesamum), rice, cotton, sugar-cane, hemp, tobacco, water-melons, and indigo. The rabi crops are wheat, barley, oil-seeds, pulses, and vegetables. The area under jodr in 1882-83 was 80,463 acres; bajra, 190,166 acres; oil-seeds, 54,836 acres; rice, 86,146 acres; cotton, 42,587 acres; sugar-cane, 1359 acres; tobacco, 4333 acres; and indigo, 6088 acres. In the same year the area under wheat was 35,702 acres; barley, 1302 acres; pulses, 14,942 acres. Of the whole area under cultivation, 6428 acres were twice cropped in 1882-83. Haidarabad is the largest cotton-producing area in Sind. The number of cwts. raised was 80,507 in 1881-82, and 83,900 in 1882-83. The average yield per acre may, approximately, be taken as follows in cwts.:\u2014Rice, 5; jodr, 6; bajra, 5; cotton (uncleaned), 2; til, 3\u00bd; tobacco, 6\u00bd; sugar-cane (gur), 30; wheat, 5\u00bd; pulses, 3. Prices current in 1882-83 were as follows per 80 lbs.:\u2014Wheat, 6s.; barley, 3s. 5d.; rice, 4s. 9d.; bajra, 3s. 4d.; jodr, 3s.; salt, 6s. 1\u00bdd.; ddi, 8s.; ghil, or clarified butter, \u00a32, 8s. 4d. The cultivators of Haidarabad do not follow any regular method of rotation in their crops. Their implements are of the usual primitive kind, and correspond in general character to the European plough, harrow, spade, hoe, drill, and sickle. The agricultural stock of the District in 1882-83 included buffaloes, cows, camels, horses, sheep, and goats. The rates of daily wages are\u2014\nfor skilled labour, 1s. 6d., and for unskilled, 7\u00bdd. The daily hire for a camel is 1s. 1\u00bdd.; for a pack-bullock, 9d.; and for a cart, 3s.\n\nThe land tenures of the District are simple. Broadly divided, all land is either 'assessed' or 'alienated.' In the former case, the land is cultivated either by the zamindar himself, or by occupancy holders and tenants-at-will. The occupancy holder (maurasi h\u00e1ri) is really an hereditary cultivator, for his rights are heritable and transferable; and the zamindar, except as regards the actual payment of rent, has no power over him. The tenant-at-will (ghair maurasi) is legally the creature of the zamindar; but the large landholders in the District do not exercise their powers oppressively. The zamindar's own tenure is hardly more definite here than elsewhere in India, and whatever of certainty it possesses is owing entirely to British legislation.\n\nIn the second class of lands (the alienated) there are four chief varieties, each having sub-divisions, viz. j\u00e1girs, pattid\u00e1ris, charitable grants, garden and forest grants. The j\u00e1girs of the District at the first settlement under British rule were computed at 40 per cent of the total area, but now only about one-sixth of the whole is alienated. The j\u00e1girs are officially classified according as they are permanent and heritable, for two lives only, or merely life grants. All alike are subject to a cess of 5 per cent. for local purposes, and some pay besides to Government a percentage of the produce assessed according to their class, the maximum being one-fourth. Pattid\u00e1ri grants, which are of Afghan origin, exist only in the Naush\u00e1hro sub-division. They obtained recognition at the settlement from the long possession of the then incumbents, dating, in the majority of cases, from the first reclamation from waste or purchase from the earliest proprietors. The total area held on charitable grants is not great. Garden grants are held free of assessment or at a nominal rate, so long as the gardens are properly maintained; and, in the same way, h\u00faris or tree-plantation (not orchard) grants are held revenue-free so long as the land is exclusively reserved for forest growth. Seri grants are those made in consideration of official services.\n\nFor the purposes of assessment, villages are classified into six varieties, the maximum rates in each ranging as follows:\u2014On land perennially irrigated, from 1s. 6d. to 9s.; on sa\u00edldbi lands, from 1s. to 7s.; on mok lands, from 1s. 6d. to 5s. 6d.; on land irrigated by wheel for part of the year only, from 1s. to 4s. The average rate per acre on cultivable land is about 1s. 5d. Under the revised settlements, villages are grouped into four classes, the maximum and average rates per acre being as follows:\u2014Class I., maximum rate, 10s. 9d.; average rate, 5s. 2\u00bdd. Class II., 9s. 6d. and 4s. 6\u00bdd.; Class III., 8s. 6d. and 4s. 0\u00bdd.; Class IV., 7s. 6d. and 3s. 6\u00bdd. Formerly the Government assessment was levied in kind, but since 1851 the payment has been\nreceived in cash. The samind\u0101rs, however, are paid by the tenants in kind at the following rates:\u2014On land under charkhi cultivation, one-third of the produce; on mok and saildbi lands, two-thirds. In the case of the best lands, yielding cotton, tobacco, sugar-cane, etc., the samind\u0101r receives his rent, as a rule, in money.\n\nManufactures and Trade.\u2014The manufactures of the District maintain the excellence for which they have been famous from early times. The Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d taluk in particular still enjoys much of its old pre-eminence for lacquered work, enamelling (the secret, it is said, of one family only), and gold and silver embroidery. In the fighting days of the M\u012brs, the arms of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d were also held in the highest esteem; but owing to the reduced demand for chain armour, shields, and sabres under British rule, the trade is now in abeyance. In the H\u00e1la Sub-division special features of the local industry are striped and brilliant cloths known as s\u016bsi, khes, and also glazed pottery. This effective work is turned to various ornamental purposes, especially tiling, and is remarkable for excellence of both glaze and colour. In nearly all the villages of the District, some manufacture is carried on; blankets, coarse cotton cloths, camel saddles, and metal work being perhaps the most prevalent.\n\nThe total number of fairs is 33, and the average attendance at each about 5000; they last from three to eighteen days.\n\nThe transit trade of the District is considerable. The returns for H\u00e1la and Tando show totals in the money value of the goods in transit of \u00a3190,000 and \u00a390,000 respectively; but returns for the other two Sub-divisions of the District\u2014namely, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Naush\u00e1hro\u2014are not available. The municipality of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d derives an annual income of \u00a312,000, of which \u00a310,000 is received from octroi.\n\nSalt of excellent quality, and in considerable quantity, is found in Tando; but the deposits are not allowed to be worked.\n\nMeans of Communication, etc.\u2014The roads of the District aggregate 1925 miles in length, of which 263 are trunk roads, metalled, bridged, and marked with milestones. The Sind Railway does not actually enter the District, but touches at Kotri, on the opposite bank of the Indus to Gidu-Bandar (3\u00bd miles from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d), where a steam ferry connects Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d with Kotri. The only telegraph station in the District is at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, the chief town, which is in communication with Kar\u00e1chi on the south-west; with Mult\u00e1n via Kotri; and with Disa (Deesa) via Umarkot on the south-east. Postal communication is represented by 1 disbursing station (at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d), 11 branch offices, and 14 sub-offices. The ferries number in all 48, one (at Gidu) being a steam ferry. A small income is derived from this source, the returns for 1880\u201381 being \u00a3477. There are in the District, 21 travellers\u2019 bungalows and 50 dharm\u00e1s\u00e1lds, or native rest-houses.\nAdministration.\u2014The chief revenue and magisterial authority of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District is vested in a Collector and Magistrate, who is assisted by 4 Assistant Collectors, for the H\u00e1la, Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Naush\u00e1hro, and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-divisions respectively, besides a Huz\u00far Deputy Collector permanently stationed at the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. A Cantonment Magistrate has been recently appointed in addition. The District and Sessions Judge holds sessions at the towns of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sakrand, H\u00e1la, and Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n several times in the year, and at Um\u00e1rkot in the Thar and P\u00e1rkar Political Superintendency once a year. In each Sub-division there is a subordinate judge with powers up to cases involving \u00a3500. Three of these judges visit certain specified places for a limited period once yearly. The subordinate revenue staff consists of 13 mukht\u00ed\u00e1rd\u00e1rs, each of whom collects the revenue and exercises limited magisterial powers within the limits of a t\u00e1l\u00e1k; and tap\u00e1dd\u00e1rs, responsible for the correct measurement of lands, enumeration of irrigation-wheels, etc., each within his tap\u00e1.\n\nThe canal divisions are supervised by executive engineers of the Public Works Department, with suitable establishments. The northern half of the Collectorate is included in the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d canal division, the canals in the southern making up the Fuleli division.\n\nThe crimes most prevalent throughout the District are cattle-stealing, thefts, burglaries. The total of all offences during 1880\u201381 was 5610, of which about 1500 fall under the above three heads. In 1881\u201382, the total number was 3527, of which 2383 fell under these three heads. It is noteworthy that in the Tando courts the Hindus filed against Muhammadans twice as many civil suits as against Hindus, and that the Muhammadans filed ten times as many against Hindus as against their co-religionists.\n\nThe police force of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District is under the charge of a European District Superintendent, with head-quarters at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and consists of the following:\u2014District police (including 100 horse and 37 camel police), 581; town police, 126; total, 707 men, including 4 inspectors, 19 chief and 92 head constables. There is therefore 1 policeman to every 12\u00b77 square miles and to every 1070 of the entire population. Excluding the police of the city and cantonment of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, the proportion of the purely District police is 1 policeman to every 15\u00b79 square miles of country, and to every 1221 of the rural population.\n\nThe revenue of the District is derived chiefly from the land. The following is a statement of the average net land revenue for four successive periods of six years each\u20141856\u201362, \u00a3107,506; 1862\u201368, \u00a3106,670; 1868\u201374, \u00a3111,655; 1874\u201380, \u00a3115,986. The receipts from the farm of liquor-shops has shown a steady advance from \u00a33126 in 1856\u201357 to \u00a311,400 in 1881\u201382, but in 1882\u201383 the receipts fell to\n\u00a39342. There is but one distillery (at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city), and the number of farmers' shops is 147. Since 1863, all farms for the sale of liquor are sold by public auction to the highest bidder. During the same period (1856 to 1874), the number of European liquor-shops has risen from 1 to 6, and the receipts from \u00a31,10s. to \u00a360. The drug revenue, which in 1856 realized \u00a31618, had risen by 1882-83 to \u00a35827, including \u00a34019 from opium. The number of shops for drugs is 183, and for opium 114. Neither the imperial nor the local revenue of the District shows much variation during the past sixteen years, the former being in 1864, \u00a3137,112, and in 1880-81, \u00a3164,340; the latter in 1864, \u00a310,326, in 1874, \u00a312,434, and in 1880-81, \u00a311,674. In 1882-83, the gross imperial revenue of the District was \u00a3141,475, of which \u00a3137,243 was land revenue. This disproportion in the increase of local, as compared with imperial revenue, is due to the fact that formerly the one anna cess was levied on dikk\u00e1ri revenue, but as this was illegal, the practice has been discontinued.\n\nThe Local Fund revenue is made up from three taxes, levied under Act viii. of 1865\u2014viz. the 1 anna cess (about 6 per cent.), the 3 per cent. j\u00e1gir cess for roads, and the 2 per cent. j\u00e1gir cess for schools. The forests in the District\u201432 in number\u2014occupy an area of 133 square miles, and yield an annual revenue of \u00a312,000. In 1880-81 the revenue was \u00a38557, the falling off being due to the fact that no firewood is now required for the Indus Flotilla steamers.\n\nThe only jail in the District is at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city; average daily population, 500; cost of prisoners, about \u00a35 each per annum; rate of mortality, 7\u00b76 per cent. There are 3 first-class sub-jails, viz. at Naush\u00e1hro, H\u00e1la, and Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, and 1 second-class at M\u00edrpur. Jailors are provided for first-class sub-jails on Rs. 15 or \u00a31, 10s. each per mensem, and prisoners sentenced to three months' imprisonment and under are detained in these jails. The second munshi of the t\u00e1luk office is ex officio jailor of the second-class sub-jail, and he receives an allowance of 10s. per mensem. Prisoners sentenced to one month and under are confined in this class of sub-jail. Lock-ups are attached to the head-quarters station of each mukht\u00ed\u00e1rk\u00e1r.\n\nThe total number of Government schools for boys has risen from 21 in 1868 to 105 in 1881-82, and the number of pupils from 1355 to 5348; the number of girls' schools during the same period has increased from 10 to 12, and the pupils from 262 to 368. These figures include the returns for the high, normal, engineering, and Anglo-vernacular schools in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city, where also the Church Missionary Society supports a school with about 100 pupils. Little seems to be known of the private indigenous schools, but, with two exceptions, they are of a very inferior kind.\n\nThe fisheries of the District yielded in 1880-81 a revenue of \u00a31475.\nThey are carried on, not only in the Indus, but also in the Fuleli river and some of the dhandhs and kol\u00e1bs or natural reservoirs in which the flood waters are retained. The pala fish is the staple of the Indus fisheries, and for a part of the year forms the principal food of the people.\n\nThe municipalities of the District are 14 in number, deriving their revenue from octroi dues, licence fees, market tolls, cattle pound fees, etc., and expending their income upon conservancy, lighting, police, public works, and grants-in-aid to local education. The municipal statistics in each of the four Sub-divisions are as follows:\u2014 H\u00e1la, 6 municipalities, with incomes ranging from \u00a3202 to \u00a3704; Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, 2, viz. that of the city with an income of \u00a312,000, and another with an income of \u00a3115; Tando, 1, with an income of \u00a3744; Naush\u00e1hro, 5, with incomes ranging from \u00a394 to \u00a3174.\n\nClimate.\u2014Considerable variations of climate obtain within the District. In the north, the hot season of April and May is followed by two months of flood, the rest of the year being cold and dry. In the central tract, including H\u00e1la and the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, the cold season succeeds the hot without any intervening inundations to graduate the transition; and the change occurs sometimes with such suddenness that, to quote a local saying, \u2018sunstroke and frost-bite are possible in one and the same day.\u2019 In the south, the temperature is more equable throughout the year, 60\u00b0 F. and 100\u00b0 representing the extremes. Following these climatic variations, the medical aspects of the District vary, the fevers so frequent in the northern division being almost unknown in the southern portion, where there are no floods to leave marsh land behind them. The rainfall average of five years ending 1881 is 8 inches per annum, the local distribution being\u2014H\u00e1la 5\u00bd inches, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d 6\u00be, Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n 4, Naush\u00e1hro 5\u00bc inches. The rainfall at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city in 1881 was 6\u00b737 inches. In 1869 there was an extraordinary fall of 20 inches all over the District. The same year is memorable for an outbreak of epidemic cholera, and in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d t\u00e1luk of severe fever. In normal years, the District is healthy as compared with other parts of India. Fevers, however, are very prevalent in September and October, when the inundations cease and the canals are drying up; and they last till the northerly winds set in. Dispensaries (excluding Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Civil Hospital) are 7 in number, with an annual admission of 18,583 patients, of whom about 300 are in-door. Besides these institutions, there is at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d a civil and police hospital, a convict hospital (in the jail), and a charitable dispensary, with (1883) 26,797 admissions, 828 being in-door patients.\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d).\u2014One of the four Sub-divisions of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; lying between 25\u00b0 10'\nand 25\u00b0 31' N. latitude, and between 68\u00b0 19' and 68\u00b0 41' E. longitude; bounded on the north and east by the H\u00e1la Sub-division; on the west by the river Indus; and on the south by Tando. Area, 404 square miles, or 258,560 acres, of which 80,817 were cultivated in 1880\u201381. Population, according to Census of 1881, 103,025, or 255 to the square mile. Of this population 5952 were returned as 'floating.' The Sub-division is divided into the 7 tap\u00e1s of H\u00e1tri, G\u00fandar, Husri, Khathar, Bhindo, K\u00e1thri, and Fazal-jo-Tando; and contains 59 villages and 2 towns, viz. Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and M\u00e1t\u00e1ri. The general aspect of the t\u00e1luk is more diversified than that of the rest of the District, for the low limestone hills, known as the Ganjo range, run through 13 miles of its length, and besides the extensive forests there is a large proportion of garden land. It is well provided with canals, there being 43 (all Government property), with an aggregate length of 177 miles, and yielding an average annual revenue of \u00a37330. There are no floods or lets in this t\u00e1luk except in the villages of Seri and J\u00e1m Shoro, and only one dhandh or natural reservoir\u2014fed by the N\u00farwah channel.\n\nThe seasons, according to the native division, are four\u2014the kharif, rab\u00ed, peshr\u00e1s, and add\u00fawas\u2014viz. February to March, April to July, August to October, November to January; but in average years the transition from the hot weather to the cold is so sudden that intermediate seasons can hardly be recognised. The mean yearly temperature is 80\u00b0 F., varying from an average of 64\u00b0 in January to 92\u00b0 in June; average annual rainfall, between 6 and 8 inches. The prevailing winds are northerly from November to March, and for the rest of the year from the south, the hot wind from the desert being felt in May. The arable soils of the Sub-division do not differ from those of the rest of the District; and the only mineral peculiarity is the met, a kind of fuller's earth dug from mines in the Ganjo Hills, which is largely used by the natives as soap. The farm of these mines realizes a revenue of \u00a3450 per annum. The chief timber tree is the bab\u00fal or babar (Acacia Arabica), extensively grown in the forests of Mi\u00e1ni (Meeanee), K\u00e1thri, Ghali\u00fam, Khathar, and Husri, which aggregate an area of 12,070 acres, yielding to Government an annual revenue of \u00a31837. They were all planted by the M\u00edrs of Sind at different dates between 1790 and 1832. The three fisheries of the Sub-division (the B\u00e1d\u00e1, Sipki, and Karo Kh\u00e1ho) yielded an annual revenue of \u00a3813 in 1880\u201381.\n\nThe population of the Sub-division, 103,025, of whom 55,097 were males and 47,928 females, was divided in the Census of 1881 as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 67,181; Hindus, 21,293; Sikhs, 11,883; aborigines, 2240; Christians, 386; Jews, 22; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 20.\n\nThe revenue and magisterial charge of the Sub-division is vested in an Assistant Collector, with 1 mukht\u00e1rk\u00e1r and 7 tap\u00e1dd\u00e1rs. In the city\nof Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d there is also the Huz\u00far Deputy Collector, the Cantonment Magistrate, and the subordinate judge of the Civil Court. The police force numbers 332 men, of whom 313 are in the city, and the remainder, 19, distributed over the Sub-division in 6 th\u00e1nds or outposts.\n\nThe revenue of the Sub-division for 1880\u201381 was \u00a324,753, being \u00a323,202 imperial and \u00a31551 local, derived from the following sources\u2014Imperial\u2014Land-tax, \u00a38486; abk\u00e1ri or excise, \u00a36840; stamps, \u00a33908; registration, \u00a3264; telegraph, \u00a3707; licences, \u00a3777; postal and miscellaneous, \u00a32220; Local\u2014Cesses on land, \u00a3497; percentage on alienated lands, \u00a3113; ferry funds, excluding steam ferry, \u00a3124; fisheries, \u00a3814; miscellaneous, \u00a33.\n\nThe topographical survey of the Sub-division for the purposes of settlement was completed in 1858. The prevailing tenure is the usual zamind\u00e1ri of the District. There are in the taluk 40 j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, holding between them 53,996 acres, and paying an annual revenue of \u00a3483. A single j\u00e1girdd\u00e1r, M\u00edr Jam Kh\u00e1n, holds 19,785 acres, all arable. The number of seri grants is 31; total area, 699 acres; and there are besides 56 m\u00e1jiddars holding small patches rent free.\n\nThe only medical establishments, jails, post-office, and telegraph station in the District are in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d City, as are also the chief educational institutions.\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d).\u2014Chief town of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Latitude 25\u00b0 23' 5\" N., longitude 68\u00b0 24' 51\" E. Population (1881) 48,153, including 3069 returned as 'floating,' and 2958 in cantonments. Of the total population, 21,878 are Muhammadans, 14,861 Hindus, 386 Christians, and 11,028 'others.' The municipal area is about 15 square miles. The municipal revenue (1880\u201381) was \u00a312,590, and the disbursements \u00a310,721; rate of municipal taxation, 5s. 2\u00bdd. per head. In 1882\u201383 the municipal income was \u00a312,000, and the incidence of municipal taxation 5s. per head of the municipal population. Upon the site of the present fort is supposed to have stood the ancient town of Ner\u00e1nkot, which in the 8th century submitted to Muhamad K\u00e1sim Sak\u00edf\u00ed. In 1768 the present city was founded by Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h Kalhora; and it remained the chief town of the Province until 1843, when, after the battle of Mi\u00e1ni (Meeanee), it surrendered to the British, and the capital was transferred to Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrach\u00e9e). The city is built on the most northerly hills of the Ganjo range, a site of great natural strength, 3\u00bd miles east of the Indus, with which it is connected by the high road to Gidu-Bandar, where a steam ferry crosses the river to Kotri on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. In the fort, which covers an area of 36 acres, are the arsenal of the Province, transferred hither from Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrach\u00e9e) in 1861, and the palaces of the ex-M\u00edrs of Sind.\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d is now plentifully supplied with water, which is pumped up from the Indus by powerful machinery, located on the river bank at Gidu. Thence the water passes along an aqueduct raised on masonry arches, into two large reservoirs or depositing tanks, situated about 500 yards from the river bank, each tank capable of holding 1,200,000 gallons. From these tanks the water flows by gravitation to within a short distance of the foot of the rocky plateau on which the cantonments are built; from here the water is pumped up into a stone tank on the crest of the plateau, which holds about 100,000 gallons, from which the supply for the cantonments is taken. The main conduit, passing through the plateau, discharges into a tank below the fort, from whence the water is pumped up to a point higher than the surface of the ground within the fort, and discharged through iron pipes all over the city by gravitation.\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, as the historic capital of Sind, is the centre of all the Provincial communications\u2014road, telegraphic, postal. From the earliest times, its manufactures\u2014ornamented silks, silver and gold work, and lacquered ware\u2014have been the chief of the Province, and in recent times have gained prizes at the Industrial Exhibitions of Europe. A local specialty is the manufacture of the earthen vessels, mati, which are used by the pala fishermen to buoy themselves up on the water while fishing. Statistics of local trade are not available; but, as the municipality derives an annual income of about \u00a36000 from octroi dues, it must be very considerable.\n\nThe chief public buildings are the jail (capable of holding 600 convicts), the Government Anglo-vernacular school, engineering, high, and normal schools, post-office, municipal markets, court-houses, civil and police hospital, charitable dispensary, library, travellers' bungalow, and lunatic asylum. To the building of the last, Sir Cowasjee Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Readymoney subscribed \u00a35000. The barracks are built in 12 blocks, with hospitals, b\u00e1z\u00e1r, etc., to the north-west of the city. The only noteworthy antiquities are the tombs of the Kalhora and T\u00e1lpur Mirs. The Residency, memorable for its gallant defence by Sir James Outram against the Bal\u00fach\u00eds in 1843, situated 3 miles from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, no longer exists. For history, see Sind Province.\n\nHaidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Muhamdi tahsil, Kheri District, Oudh. A part of the old pargan\u00e1 Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra belonging to the Ahbans and P\u00e1s\u00eds; afterwards seized by the Sayyids, and then occupied by the Gaurs, with whom a zamind\u00e1ri settlement was effected about 1792. Since then various branches of the old Ahban family have recovered possession, and they now own the principal estates. The rest of the zamind\u00e1rs are retainers or followers of the Sayyids and the chakl\u00e1dd\u00e1rs. Along the banks of the Kathn\u00e1, which forms the western boundary, the land lies very low, and is covered with jungle. The ground slowly\nHAIDARABAD TOWN\u2014HAIDARGARH.\n\nrises, and the cultivated tract commences about two miles from the river. The soil here is a light *dom\u00e1t*; but it rapidly improves, and about half a mile from the border of cultivation is of the very highest quality, producing every variety of crop, and paying high rents. The belt of villages lying across the centre of the *pargan\u00e1*, most of which are the property of Government, produce sugar of great purity, which requires hardly any refining to make the clearest candy, and realizes a considerably higher price than any other in the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur market. Fine groves also dot the *pargan\u00e1*. Area, 98 square miles, of which 41 are cultivated. Population (1881) 40,761, namely, Hindus 34,592, and Muhammadans 6169. Land revenue, \u00a34132. Number of villages, 108. In the south of the *pargan\u00e1*, near the Kathn\u00e1, are the ruins of the jungle fort of Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d; a similar fort is found at Ahmadnagar. Both attest the former greatness of the Sayyids of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, by whom they were erected.\n\n**Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 19 miles north of Un\u00e1o town. Lat. 26\u00b0 55' N., long. 80\u00b0 17' E. Founded about 180 years ago by Haidar Kh\u00e1n, who named it after himself. Population (1881), Hindus, 3061; Muhammadans, 758; total, 3819. Two weekly markets; small annual trading fair. Average sales, about \u00a32400. Village school and post-office.\n\n**Haidargarh.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Bara Banki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Bara Banki and R\u00e1m Sanchi tahsils, on the east by Mus\u00e1f\u00edrkh\u00e1na tahsil of Sult\u00e1npur, on the south by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj tahsil of R\u00e1i Bareli, and on the west by Mohanl\u00e1lganj tahsil of Lucknow; lying between 26\u00b0 31' 30\" and 26\u00b0 51' N. lat, and between 81\u00b0 12' and 81\u00b0 39' E. long. Area, 297 square miles, of which 181 are cultivated. Population (1881) 170,381, namely, Hindus, 154,669, and Muhammadans, 18,712. The Sub-division contains one criminal court, with two police circles (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*), and a police force of 40 men.\n\n**Haidargarh.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Haidargarh tahsil, Bara Banki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Siddhaur pargan\u00e1, on the east by Subeh\u00e1 pargan\u00e1, on the south by Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n pargan\u00e1 of R\u00e1i Bareli, and on the west by Lucknow. Originally occupied by the Bhars, who were dispossessed by Sayyid Miran, and afterwards extirpated by Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur. It is now chiefly in the possession of the Ameth\u00eda clan of R\u00e1jputs. Area, 103 square miles, of which 59 are cultivated. Government land revenue, \u00a39051, or an average of 3s. 1d. per acre. Autumn crops\u2014rice of excellent quality, cotton, hemp, millet, and pulses; spring crops\u2014wheat, barley, gram, linseed, peas, sugar, tobacco, and poppy. Of the 118 villages of which the *pargan\u00e1* is composed, 61\u00bd are *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rt*, 29\u00bd *samind\u00e1rt*, 26 *pattid\u00e1rti*, and 1 *bhayach\u00e1ra*. Population (1881) 58,522, namely, 28,679 males and 29,843 females. Grain is exported to Lucknow, Sult\u00e1npur, Dari\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Cawnpur:\nprincipal imports, cotton and salt. Saltpetre is manufactured in four villages to the extent of 35,000 maunds, or 1277 tons, annually. Seven market villages.\n\n**Haidargarh.**\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh; 25 miles east of the head-quarters station. Founded by Amfr-ud-daul\u00e1 H\u00e1idar Beg Kh\u00e1n, Prime Minister of Naw\u00e1b Asif-ud-daul\u00e1. It is now the seat of the tahsil revenue courts, but otherwise of little importance. Population (1881) 2128, namely, Hindus 1441, and Muhammadans 687.\n\n**Haidargarh.**\u2014Pass in South Kanara District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Hassangadi.\n\n**Hailakandi.**\u2014Sub-division in the south of Cachar District, Assam. Area, 344 square miles. Population (1881) 65,671, namely, Hindus, 49,495; Muhammadans, 34,281; and 'others,' 1141.\n\n**Hailakandi.**\u2014Village in the south of Cachar District, Assam, on the right or east bank of the Dhaleswari river. Head-quarters of the Sub-division of the same name, and also a th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police station. It gives its name to a fertile valley, which is entirely laid under water by the floods of every rainy season.\n\n**Haing-gyi** (or Negrais).\u2014An island in the Bassein or Nga-won river, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Lat 15\u00b0 54' N., long. 94\u00b0 20' E. It is situated near the western bank, 3\u00bd miles distant from Pagoda Point, and is rendered conspicuous by a hill at its northern end, which slopes away towards the centre. A narrow belt of level ground skirts the coast. The channel between Negrais and the Bassein river is 1 mile broad on the south and 4\u00bd miles broad on the north, opposite the abandoned station of Dalhousie. Captain Taylor (Sailing Directions, p. 496) warns shipmasters that no vessel drawing over 14 feet should attempt to pass between the island and the mainland towards Port Dalhousie. For the history of Negrais Island, see Bassein District.\n\n**Hajamro** (or Sian).\u2014River of Sind, Bombay Presidency; one of the central deltaic channels of the Indus; debouches into the sea south-east of Karachi (Kurrachee), in latitude 24\u00b0 6' N., and longitude 67\u00b0 22' E. In 1845, the Hajamro was so small as to be only suited for the passage of small boats during flood; in 1875 it had taken the place of the Khedaw\u00e1ri channel, and become the principal outlet of the Indus to the sea. In shape the Hajamro is somewhat like a funnel, the wide part to the sea. At the eastern entrance is a beacon 95 feet high, visible 25 miles. Two pilot-boats wait inside the bar to point out to entering vessels the dangers of the navigation.\n\n**Hajiganj.**\u2014Town and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1), in Tipperah District, Bengal; situated on the D\u00e1k\u00e1tia river. Lat. 23\u00b0 15' N., long. 90\u00b0 53' 30\" E. An important seat of river traffic. Betel-nut is extensively cultivated, and a considerable trade in the article carried on with Dacca, N\u00e1r\u00e1inganj, and Calcutta.\nH\u00e1j\u00edpur.\u2014Sub-division of Muzaffarpur District, Bengal. Area, 771 square miles, with 1707 villages and 101,713 occupied houses; lying between 25\u00b0 29' and 26\u00b0 1' N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 6' 45\" and 85\u00b0 41' E. long. Population (1881) 724,531, namely, Hindus, 657,421; Muhammadans, 30,126; and Christians, 34. Males numbered 344,281, and females 380,250. Proportion of males in total population, 47.7 per cent.; average density of population, 940 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 2.21; persons per village, 422; houses per square mile, 140; persons per house, 7.12. The Sub-division, which was formed in 1865, comprises the 3 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles of H\u00e1j\u00edpur, L\u00e1lganj, and Mahw\u00e1. It contained in 1883 one civil and two criminal courts, with a regular police force of 146 officers and men, and a village watch or rural police numbering 1304.\n\nH\u00e1j\u00edpur.\u2014Municipal town, and head-quarters of H\u00e1j\u00edpur Sub-division, and a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1), Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated on the right or east bank of the Little Gandak, a short distance above its confluence with the Ganges opposite Patn\u00e1. Lat. 25\u00b0 40' 50\" N., long. 85\u00b0 14' 24\" E. Said to have been founded by one H\u00e1j\u00ed Ily\u00e1s, about 500 years ago, the supposed ramparts of whose fort, enclosing an area of 360 bigh\u00e1s, are still visible. The old town is reported to have reached as far as Mohn\u00e1r th\u00e1n\u00e1, 20 miles to the east, and to a village called Gad\u00e1i-sar\u00e1i on the north. H\u00e1j\u00edpur figures conspicuously in the history of the struggles between Akbar and his rebellious Afgh\u00e1n governors of Bengal, being twice besieged and captured by the imperial troops, in 1572 and again in 1574. Its command of water traffic in three directions makes the town a place of considerable commercial importance. Population (1872) 22,306; (1881) 25,078, namely, males 11,564, and females 13,514. Hindus numbered 20,895; Muhammadans, 4169; and 'others,' 14. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3740, of which \u00a3614 was derived from taxation; expenditure, \u00a3679; incidence of taxation, 4\u00bdd. per head of population, within municipal limits. Within the area of the old fort is a small stone mosque, very plain, but of peculiar architecture, attributed to H\u00e1j\u00ed Ily\u00e1s. Its top consists of three rounded domes, the centre one being the largest. They are built of horizontally-placed rows of stones, each row being a circle, and each successive circle being more contracted than the one immediately below it, until the key-stone is reached, which is also circular. Two other mosques and a small Hindu temple are in the town or its immediate vicinity. A Buddhist temple, surrounded by a sar\u00e1ti or rest-house, was built for the accommodation of the late Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur, on the occasion of his visits from Nep\u00e1l. Besides the ordinary courts, the town contains a school, police station, post-office, charitable dispensary, and distillery.\n\nH\u00e1jo.\u2014Village in the north of K\u00e1mr\u00e1n District, Assam, near the\nleft or east bank of the Baraliy\u00e1 river, and about 6 miles north of the Brahmaputra. In the immediate neighbourhood is the celebrated Mah\u00e1muni temple, situated on the summit of a low hill. The place is annually visited by thousands of pilgrims from all parts of India, not only Hindus, but also Buddhists from beyond the Him\u00e1layas, who venerate it as a spot rendered sacred by the presence of the founder of their faith.\n\nH\u00e1la.\u2014Sub-division or Deputy Collectorate of Haidarabad (Hyderabad) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency, situated between 25\u00b0 8' and 26\u00b0 15' N. latitude, and between 68\u00b0 16' 30\" and 69\u00b0 17' E. longitude. It is bounded on the north by the Naush\u00e1hro Sub-division; on the south by Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d t\u00e1luk; on the east by the Thar and P\u00e1rkar Political Superintendency; and on the west by the Indus. Area, 2522 square miles; population (1872) 216,139; (1881) 224,847. The Sub-division is divided into 4 t\u00e1luks, namely, H\u00e1la, Alahy\u00e1r-jo-Tando, Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur, and M\u00edrpur Kh\u00e1s. It contains 279 villages and 6 towns, 14 of which have a population of over 800. Occupied houses, 41,724. In general aspect, the tract is an unbroken plain, sandy and unprofitable on the eastern side; but intersected by canals and fringed with forest on the west. These canals, 95 in number, are, with the exception of one, Government property; they have an aggregate length of 938 miles, and yield an annual income of \u00a332,945. Temperature, 74\u00b0 to 103\u00b0 F.; average annual rainfall, about 6 inches. The chief tree is the bab\u00fal, or Asiatic acacia. The forest areas aggregate 24,764 acres, yielding in 1873\u201374 a revenue of \u00a33066. They were all planted between 1790 and 1830 by the Mfs of Sind. The fisheries, six in number, yielded in 1880\u201381 a revenue of \u00a3162.\n\nThe population of the Sub-division (224,847) was divided in the Census of 1881 as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 173,285; Hindus, 31,490; Sikhs, 9151; aborigines, 10,764; 144 Jains; 2 Christians; 9 Jews, and 2 'others.' In character, habits, dress, etc., the inhabitants of H\u00e1la are not distinguished by any peculiarities from those of the rest of the District. As elsewhere in Sind, the prevalent crimes are cattle-stealing, theft, and housebreaking. The criminal returns for 1881 show a total of 1772 offences, or 1 in 127 of the population. The civil returns for the same year give a total of 1296 suits; value in dispute, \u00a314,578. The chief revenue and magisterial charge is vested in a Deputy Collector and Magistrate, who has under him a mukhti\u00e1rk\u00e1r for each of the 4 t\u00e1luks, and a tap\u00e1dd\u00e1r for each of the 24 tap\u00e1s. The only civil court in the Sub-division is that at the town of H\u00e1la, presided over by a native subordinate judge, who goes on circuit annually to Adam-jo-Tando and Alahy\u00e1r-jo-Tando. The H\u00e1la police number 164 officers and men, or 1 constable to 1317 of the population. Forty-three of the whole are mounted. The only jails are the 4 lock-ups at the mukhti\u00e1rk\u00e1r stations.\nHALA TALUK.\n\nThe revenue of the Sub-division for 1880-81 was \u00a346,216, being \u00a343,300 imperial and \u00a32,196 local, derived from the following sources: \u2014Imperial\u2014Land-tax, \u00a335,670; abk\u00e1ri, \u00a32,392; stamps, \u00a34000; salt, \u00a32; registration, \u00a3214; postal and miscellaneous, \u00a31022: Local\u2014Cesses on land, \u00a32,156; percentage on alienated lands, \u00a3539; ferry funds, \u00a359; fisheries, \u00a3162. A topographical survey for the purposes of assessment was completed in 1865. The rates of the Settlement concluded in 1871-72 for ten years vary from 1s. for inferior soils to 8s. for high-class irrigated lands. Tenants, as a rule, pay the zamind\u00e1r in kind, but the Government dues are now received in money. The prevailing tenure is the ordinary zamind\u00e1ri of HAIDARABAD DISTRICT, but j\u00e1g\u00edrs are very numerous, 168 grantees holding between them 163,078 acres. The total number of seri grants is 35, aggregating 490 acres. The number of m\u00e1fid\u00e1rs is 37.\n\nThere are 6 municipalities within the Sub-division\u2014Alahy\u00e1r-jo-Tando, Adam-jo-Tando, H\u00e1la, Mat\u00e1r\u00ed, Nasarpur, and Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur\u2014with an aggregate income of \u00a32,331 in 1882-83. There are four dispensaries\u2014at H\u00e1la, Alahy\u00e1r-jo-Tando, Adam-jo-Tando, and M\u00edrpur\u2014total admissions (during 1881-82), 11,553; average daily attendance, 40. There are in all 15 Government schools, with an attendance of 849 pupils; the indigenous schools number 11, with 120 pupils.\n\nThe trade of the Sub-division is confined almost wholly to agricultural produce. Exports, \u00a3139,798; imports, \u00a385,163. Transit trade, about \u00a3190,000. Lacquered ware, glazed pottery (for which prizes were gained by the H\u00e1la workmen at the Kar\u00e1chi Exhibition of 1869), and striped cloths called s\u00e1s\u00eds and khesis are the chief manufactures. There are in all 22 fairs, the chief one (a Hindu) being attended annually by 35,000 persons; the remainder are Muhammadan fairs, with an average attendance of 3000. Roads aggregate nearly 600 miles in length; none are metalled, but many are partially bridged.\n\nThe chief antiquities are the ruins of BRAHMANABAD and Khud\u00e1b\u00e1d. The latter, 2 miles from H\u00e1la (New), was once the favourite residence of the T\u00e1lpur chiefs, and is said to have rivalled Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d in size and population. The ancient tombs at L\u00e1l-Udero, K\u00e1m\u00e1ro, and Myo Vahio are all noteworthy.\n\nH\u00e1la.\u2014T\u00e1luk of the H\u00e1la Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 78,149, of which 4153 are \u2018floating\u2019; area, 531 square miles, containing 3 towns and 70 villages. The population occupies 15,339 houses. Males number 42,265, females 35,884; classified according to religion, there were 9855 Hindus, 63,086 Muhammadans, 3297 Sikhs, 1761 aborigines, 144 Jains, and 6 Jews. Revenue for 1883-84, \u00a38819. The area assessed to land revenue in 1882-83 was 110,964 acres; area under actual cultivation, 42,500 acres.\nThe taluk contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; regular police, 39 men.\n\nH\u00e1la, New.\u2014Town in the H\u00e1la Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; formerly known as Murtiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Latitude 25\u00b0 48' 30\" N., longitude 68\u00b0 27' 30\" E.; population (1881) 3967. Municipal income (1880-81), \u00a3363; expenditure, \u00a3342; rate of taxation, 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head. The local trade consists chiefly of grain, piece-goods, gh\u00ed, cotton, and sugar, valued approximately at \u00a33900. The transit trade (in the same articles) is valued at about \u00a3700. H\u00e1la has long been famous for its glazed pottery and tiles, made from a fine clay obtained from the Indus, mixed with powdered flints. The ornamentation is brilliant and tasteful. The s\u00faris or trouser-cloths, for which H\u00e1la is also celebrated, are manufactured to the value of \u00a3750 yearly. H\u00e1la (New) was built about 1800 in consequence of H\u00e1la (Old), 2 miles distant, being threatened with encroachment by the Indus. Among the antiquities round which the new town has grown up are the tomb and mosque of a P\u00edr or Muhammadan saint, who died in the 16th century, and in whose honour a fair, largely attended by Muhammadans from all parts of the Province, is held twice a year. The British Government contributed, in 1876, \u00a3100 to the repair of this tomb. H\u00e1la is situated on the Al\u00edganj Canal, and is immediately connected with the Trunk Road at two points. It contains a subordinate judge's and mukht\u00e1rk\u00e1r's courts, dispensary, and travellers' bungalow, also a first-class subordinate jail. The number of patients relieved in the dispensary in 1883 was 3761, namely, 13 in-door and 3748 out-door.\n\nH\u00e1la, Old.\u2014Town in the H\u00e1la Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population under 2000 in 1881: mainly agriculturists. It is said to have been founded about 1422, but was partially abandoned in 1800 owing to threatened encroachments of the Indus; and H\u00e1la (New) was built in its stead, 2 miles off. Government vernacular school.\n\nH\u00e1l\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2014Town in the Naush\u00e1hro Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population under 2000 in 1881: mainly agriculturists; the Muhammadans are chiefly Sahatas, and the Hindus are Loh\u00e1nos and Punjabis. Export trade in grain; annual value, \u00a3700. Near H\u00e1l\u00e1n\u00ed the Talpur forces defeated, in 1781, the last of the Kalhora dynasty, and the tombs of the chiefs who fell in the battle mark the spot. The town lies on the high road, and is about 200 years old.\n\nHalaria.\u2014Petty State of South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consists of 4 villages, with 3 separate tribute-payers. Population, 895 in 1872, and 1066 in 1881. Lies on the Shatranji river, 16 miles south-east of Kunk\u00e1war railway station. The revenue is estimated at\nHALDA\u2014HALERI.\n\n\u00a31500; tribute of \u00a310 is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a37, 14s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nHald\u00e1.\u2014River of Chittagong District, Bengal; one of the chief tributaries of the Karnaphuli. Navigable by native boats for a distance of 24 miles throughout the year, and for 35 miles in the rainy season. One of the principal fishing rivers of the District.\n\nHald\u00ed.\u2014River of Southern Bengal, rising in lat. 22\u00b0 18' 30\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 13' 15\" E., near the western boundary of Midnapur District. The river is formed by the junction of the Kas\u00e1i (Cossye) and Tengra-kh\u00e1l\u00ed, whence it flows south-south-east till it falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed, in lat. 22\u00b0 0' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 6' 15\" E., near Nandig\u00e1on, in the Taml\u00fak Sub-division, a few miles south of the confluence of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan and H\u00fagl\u00ed, and opposite Mud Point in S\u00e1g\u00e1r island. The Hald\u00ed is a large river at its mouth, and is navigable throughout the year up to Tengra-kh\u00e1l\u00ed, but with difficulty, owing to numerous shoals and sandbanks. The Hald\u00ed is connected with the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan on the north, and with the Ras\u00falpur river on the south, by a tidal navigable canal. \u2014 See RUPNARAYAN and RASALPUR CANAL.\n\nHalebid ('Old Ruins').\u2014Village in Hassan District, Mysore State. Latitude 13\u00b0 12' 20\" N., longitude 76\u00b0 2' E. Population under 2000. The site of the ancient city of Dor\u00e1samudra or Dv\u00e1r\u00e1vatipura, the capital of the Hoysala Ball\u00e1la dynasty. It was apparently rebuilt in the 13th century by king Vira Sameswara, described in certain inscriptions as the founder. To him is assigned the erection of the two magnificent temples in honour of Siva, which rank among the masterpieces of Hindu art. The larger of these, the Hoysaleswara temple, though never completed, has elicited from Mr. Fergusson the opinion that 'taken altogether, it is perhaps the building on which the advocate of Hindu architecture would desire to take his stand.' Its dimensions are roughly 200 feet square, and 25 feet high above the terrace on which it stands. The material is an indurated potstone of volcanic origin, found in the neighbourhood, which takes a polish like marble. The ornamentation consists of a series of friezes one above another, each about 700 feet long, and carved with the most exquisite elaboration. One frieze alone represents a procession of not less than 2000 elephants. The smaller or K\u00e1itabheswara temple has unfortunately been entirely split to pieces in recent years by the growth of trees and their roots through the joins of the stones. Some of the most perfect sculptures have been removed to the Museum at Bangalore. There are also ruins of Jain bast\u00eds and of other buildings in the neighbourhood. The city of Dor\u00e1sam\u00fadra was taken and sacked by the Muhammadans in 1310, and the capital of the Ball\u00e1las transferred to Tondan\u00far.\n\nH\u00e1leri.\u2014Village in the territory of Coorg; has an historical interest as the first settlement of the family of Ling\u00e1yats from Ikkeri in\nMysore, who established themselves as R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Coorg in the 17th century. The old palace, which was built on the usual plan of Coorg houses, though on a larger scale, and with breastworks and other defences, became a complete ruin, and all the material composing it was sold in 1881. Latitude 12\u00b0 27' N., longitude 75\u00b0 52' E.\n\nHalhali\u00e1.\u2014River of Bengal, formerly a considerable stream rising in Maimansingh District, which has now almost disappeared, or been absorbed by the Brahmaputra or Jamun\u00e1. Branches of it, however, remain on both sides of the Jamun\u00e1; that on the west bank being much the larger of the two, and flowing in a very tortuous course through Bogr\u00e1 District, for about 30 miles, until it joins the Kar\u00e1ttoy\u00e1 at Kh\u00e1npur. The lower part of the Halhali\u00e1 is navigable for large boats. Chief markets on the banks\u2014Kali\u00e1n\u00ed, P\u00e1chib\u00e1rf\u00ed, Dhunot, Gos\u00e1inb\u00e1rf\u00ed, and Chandanb\u00e1si\u00e1. The Halhali\u00e1 is locally confounded with another river, the Man\u00e1s, which has almost disappeared in consequence of the same causes to which the Halhali\u00e1 itself owes its diminished size.\n\nHaliy\u00e1l (Supa).\u2014Sub-division of North Kanara District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 980 square miles; contains 1 town and 215 villages. Population (1881) 61,154, namely, 33,326 males and 27,828 females. Hindus number 53,802; Muhammadans, 3864; 'others, 3488. Since 1872, the population has increased by 7368. The region consists of waving upland, seamed by the river K\u00e1linad\u00ed and its tributaries. The north and east form an open plain. Staple crops, rice and sugar-cane. Rainfall, 47\u00b78 inches. The forests of teak, blackwood, and bamboo cover an area of 251 square miles. More than a million bamboos (for which a fee of from 6s. to 2s. a hundred is paid) were exported in 1882. The forests are everywhere open to carts. The incidence of land revenue per cultivated acre varies from 16s. to 1s. Total land revenue, \u00a310,669.\n\nHaliy\u00e1l.\u2014Town in Haliy\u00e1l Sub-division of North Kanara District, Bombay Presidency. It lies 21 miles to the south-west of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, in latitude 15\u00b0 19' 50\" N., and longitude 74\u00b0 48' E. Population (1881) 5527; municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3489; rate of taxation, 1s. 9d. per head. Colonel Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington, visited Haliy\u00e1l, and speaks highly in his despatches of its importance as a frontier post. The Haliy\u00e1l timber depot supplies the best bamboo, teak, and blackwood of the Kanara jungles. The new railway under construction from Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r to Marmagao runs about 9 miles to the north of Haliy\u00e1l. Post-office, 2 schools, and dispensary. Number of patients treated in the dispensary in 1883\u2014in-door, 86; out-door, 4754.\n\nHall\u00e1r (H\u00e1ll\u00e1w\u00e1r).\u2014A Prant or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; lying between 21\u00b0 44' and 22\u00b0 55' N. latitude, and 69\u00b0 8' and 71\u00b0 2' E. longitude.

It encloses the Native States of Sarila, Jigni, and Bih\u00e1t, besides portions of Charkh\u00e1ri and Garauli. Area, 2288\u00b75 square miles. Population (1881) 507,337. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Ham\u00edrpur; but Rath has the largest population in the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Ham\u00edrpur forms part of the great plain of Bundelkhand, which stretches between the banks of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and the central Vindhy\u00e1n plateau. The District is in shape an irregular parallelogram, with a general slope northward from the low hills on the\nsouthern boundary toward the valleys of the Jumna and Betw\u00e1, which limit it on the north and west. The plains of the District are level, dry, and cultivable. They consist for the most part of black soil (mar), known as cotton soil, and a blackish soil (kabar), both of which dry up and form large holes and fissures during the hot season. The hilly southern region is composed of scattered outlying spurs from the main line of the Vindhyan range. Their general elevation does not exceed 300 feet above the Jumna valley, or a total of about 800 feet above the level of the sea, and their sides are generally bare of trees or jungle. They are rendered picturesque, however, by their rugged outline and artificial lakes, for which, particularly those of M\u00e1hoba, the District is celebrated. These magnificent reservoirs were constructed by the Chandel R\u00e1j\u00e1s, about 800 years ago, for purposes of irrigation and as sheets of ornamental water. They are hemmed round on two or three sides by rocky hills, while the outlets are stopped by dams of massive masonry, whose antiquity conceals all traces of their artificial origin. Many of them enclose craggy islets or peninsulas, crowned by the ruins of granite temples, exquisitely carved and decorated. The largest lake, Bijanagar, has a circumference of about 5 miles. The waters of several of these lakes are utilized for irrigation purposes by means of small canals, fourteen in number, varying from half a mile to over six miles in length.\n\nDescending from the hill and lake country, the general plain of the District is reached, which spreads northward, almost unbroken by isolated heights, in an arid and treeless level towards the broken banks of the rivers. Of these, the principal are the Betw\u00e1 and its tributary the Dhas\u00e1n, both of which are unnavigable. On the triangle formed by their junction with the stream of the Jumna, stands the town of Ham\u00edrpur, which is thus isolated from the remainder of the District by the Betw\u00e1 river and the Native State of B\u00e1oni. The Ham\u00edrpur bank of the Jumna is high; its opposite shore is low and shelving. There is little waste land, except in the ravines by the river-sides and hills. The deep black soil of Bundelkhand, known as mar, retains the moisture under a dried and rifted surface, and renders the District fertile; but unhappily the k\u00e1ns grass, the scourge of the Bundelkhand agriculturist, periodically overruns the country, except where cultivation is carefully conducted. There are no large jungles, though those of B\u00edski, in pargan\u00e1 M\u00e1hoba, and Pasin\u00e1b\u00e1d, in pargan\u00e1 Jaitpur, give cover to a considerable quantity of game. The wild animals found consist of tigers, leopards, hy\u00e6nas, wolves, jackals, antelopes, and pigs.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early annals of Bundelkhand, of which Province Ham\u00edrpur forms a portion, have been briefly sketched in the article on BANDA. During the Chandel supremacy, from the 9th to the 14th century, MAHOB\u00c1, in the south of the District, was the capital of that\ndynasty. The Chandels adorned the town and its neighbourhood with many splendid edifices, remains of which still exist in great numbers; besides constructing the noble artificial lakes already described. The last of their R\u00e1j\u00e1s, Parm\u00e1l, was defeated in 1183 by Prithwir\u00e1j, the Chauh\u00e1n ruler of Delhi; after which disaster the Chandel princes abandoned M\u00e1hoba and fixed their capital at the hill fort of Kalinjar, in B\u00e1nda District. About twelve years later, M\u00e1hoba was conquered by Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, the general of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, and with occasional interruptions, remained in the hands of the Musalm\u00e1ns for 500 years.\n\nIn 1680, the District came into the possession of Chhatar S\u00e1l, the great national hero of the Bundelas, and was the theatre of many battles during his long struggle with the imperial forces. On his death, about 1734, he assigned to his ally, the Peshw\u00e1 of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, one-third of his territories; and M\u00e1hoba formed a portion of the region so granted. The larger part of the present District of Ham\u00edrpur fell to his son Jagat-r\u00e1j. During the next seventy years, the District continued under the government of his descendants, who, however, carried on among themselves that intestine warfare which was universal in Bundelkhand throughout the latter half of the 18th century. Rival R\u00e1j\u00e1s had forts in every village, and one after the other collected their revenue from the same estates. Moreover, the Bundela princes were opposed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chieftains; and Ali Bah\u00e1dur, an illegitimate descendant of the Peshw\u00e1 who had made himself Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1nda, succeeded in 1790 in annexing a portion of the District. He was defeated by the British, and died in 1802. The British District of Bundelkhand was formed in the succeeding year (1803), a part being granted to our ally, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, as the price of his allegiance. The town of M\u00e1hoba itself, with the surrounding country, remained in the hands of the Pandits of Jal\u00e1un, until, on the death of their last representative in 1840, it lapsed to the British. The Subdivision known as J\u00e1itpur was ruled by the descendants of Chhatar S\u00e1l until 1842, when the last R\u00e1j\u00e1, believing that our reverses at K\u00e1b\u00fal would prove fatal to British rule, revolted, and having been easily captured, was removed to Cawnpur, receiving from us a pension of \u00a3200 a month. J\u00e1itpur was handed over to another claimant, who mortgaged it to the Government, and died without issue in 1849. His territories lapsed to Government, and have since formed a part of Ham\u00edrpur District.\n\nWhen the British first occupied Ham\u00edrpur in 1803, they found it in the same wretched condition as the remainder of Bundelkhand. The land had been impoverished by the long war of independence carried on under Chhatar S\u00e1l; overrun and ravaged by predatory leaders during the disastrous period of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 aggression; and devas-\ntated by robber chiefs, who levied revenue on their own account, granting receipts for the payment, which the authorized collectors were obliged to accept. As early as 1819, the attention of Government was called to the fact that many estates were being relinquished by the zamindars, through their inability to meet the demands for the land revenue. In 1842, land in Hamirpur District was reported to be utterly valueless, and many instances were adduced in which purchasers of estates had been completely ruined through over-assessment. Several estates were held by Government for arrears of revenue, because no purchasers could be found for them. A new land settlement was effected in 1842 on a greatly reduced assessment. On the outbreak of the Mutiny, Hamirpur exhibited the same return to anarchy which characterized the whole of Bundelkhand. On the 13th of June 1857, the 56th Native Infantry broke into mutiny, and the massacre of Europeans began. Only one Christian escaped with life. The surrounding native chiefs set up rival claims to portions of the British territory, and plundered all the principal towns. The Charkhari Raj\u00e1 alone maintained a wavering allegiance, which grew firmer as the forces of General Whitlock approached Mahoba. That town was reached in September 1858, and the fort of Srinagar was destroyed. After a short period of desultory guerilla warfare in the hilly regions of Bundelkhand, the rebels were effectually quelled, and the work of re-organization began. Since the Mutiny, the condition of Hamirpur seems to have improved; but it has not yet recovered from the long anarchy of the Maratha rule, and the excessive taxation of the early British period. The poor and neglected aspect of the homesteads, the careless and apathetic appearance of the people, and the wide expanse of shadeless plain, all bear witness to the prolonged disorganization and mistaken economy of former days.\n\nPeople.\u2014Hamirpur is one of the Districts of the North-Western Provinces in which the population appears to have reached its limits, and even to be on the decline. The enumerations of 1842 and 1853 did not include the whole of the present District, which has since been enlarged by the addition of Mahoba and Jaitpur; and they are consequently of little use for purposes of comparison. The Census of 1865 returned the population at 520,941 persons, on an area corresponding to that of the present District; and that of 1872 returned the population at 529,137, showing an increase of 8196, or 1.57 per cent. In 1881, the Census returned the population at 507,337, showing a decrease of 21,800, or 4.1 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be briefly stated as follows:\u2014Area of District, 2288.5 square miles; number of towns and villages, 755; houses, 83,544. Total population, 507,337, namely, males 259,778, and females 247,559; proportion of males, 51.2 per\ncent. The preponderance of males is due partly to the unwillingness of the R\u00e1jputs to state the number of their women, and partly to the former prevalence of female infanticide, which has not yet been quite stamped out. Average density of population, 221\u00b76 per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, '32; persons per town or village, 672; houses per square mile, 36\u00b75; persons per house, 6\u00b707.\n\nAs regards religious divisions, the Hindus numbered 474,092, or 93\u00b74 per cent.; and the Musalm\u00e1ns, 33,228, or 6\u00b76 per cent. Christians numbered 17. Of the higher class Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 53,666; R\u00e1jputs, 37,810; and Baniy\u00e1s, 16,232. The Br\u00e1hmans are mainly engaged in agriculture, and have consequently lost much of the respect due to their caste. The R\u00e1jputs have been very minutely reckoned in the Census, in order to discover which classes amongst them are addicted to infanticide. The Census of 1881 returned the males among the R\u00e1jputs at 21,135, and the females at 16,675; proportion of males, 55\u00b79 per cent. The R\u00e1jputs amount to 62 clans; three of which were found to be specially guilty of the practice of female infanticide, namely, the Parih\u00e1rs, Chauh\u00e1ns, and Bais. The Chandels and Bundelas, the old dominant classes, mostly still cling to the neighbourhood of M\u00e1lhoba, the seat of their former supremacy. The Bais are far the most numerous of the R\u00e1jput classes in the District. Among the trading classes the only division of any peculiarity is that of the M\u00e1rv\u00e1rfs. They act as bankers and money-lenders, but they have also acquired much landed property. K\u00e1yasths, or the writer caste, number 7940. Among the S\u00fadras or low castes, the most numerous are the Lodh\u00eds (57,300), Ch\u00e1m\u00e1rs (69,079), Ah\u00edrs (28,448), Kachh\u00eds (29,808), and the Kor\u00eds (26,228). The Musalm\u00e1ns are the descendants of converted Hindus, who were originally Th\u00e1kurs, and their habits are still much the same as those of their fellow R\u00e1jputs. Other Hindu S\u00fadra castes include\u2014Bhang\u00eds (13,791), Kah\u00e1rs (13,046), Kumbh\u00e1rs (12,610), Nais (11,328), Tel\u00eds (10,943), and Gad\u00e1rias (9976). There are only 2 Native Christians in the District, and no settlement has been effected by the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j. The Musalm\u00e1ns are making no converts. There are very few wealthy inhabitants, the landholders being often scarcely at all better off than their labourers, and living in much the same style.\n\nThe District contains 8 towns with a population of more than 5000 persons\u2014namely, Rath, 14,479; Hamirpur, 7155; Kharela, 7633; Mahoba, 7577; Maudha, 6116; Kulpahar, 6066; Sumerpur, 5222; and Jaitpur, 5440. The urban population is on the decrease. Of the 755 towns and villages comprising the District in 1881, 232 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 210 from two to five hundred, 168 from five hundred to a thousand, 110 from one to two thousand, 16 from two to three thousand, 11 from three to five thousand, 7 from five to ten\nthousand, and 1 upwards of ten thousand. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government servants, civil and military, and the learned professions, 5374; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 451; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 1876; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 116,071; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 37,846; (6) indefinite and unproductive (comprising 9548 general labourers, and 88,612 male children and persons of unspecified occupation), 98,160. The language in common use is Bundelkhandi, which is a dialect of Hindi.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple produce of the District is grain of various sorts, the most important being gram. Pulses, wheat, and millet are also largely cultivated. The autumn crops are heavier than the spring, cotton being the most valuable amongst them. Its cultivation is on the increase. Out of a total area in 1881-82, of 1,464,609 acres, 232,491 acres were returned as barren, and 1,232,118 as cultivable, of which latter area 852,778 acres were actually under cultivation. Manure is little used, except for garden land. Irrigation is practised on only 13,838 acres, chiefly in the south, where water can be obtained from the artificial lakes constructed by the Chandel princes. There are fourteen small canals connected with these lakes, and belonging to Government; but they supply water to an area of only 1319 acres. The remainder of the irrigated land is watered by hand labour. The out-turn of *bajra*, a kind of millet much grown in the District, is about \u00a31, 1s. 8d. per acre; that of *til*, an oil-seed, about \u00a31, 4s. per acre. In Hamirpur, as elsewhere in Bundelkhand, the cultivators have suffered much from the spread of the *kans* grass, a noxious weed, which overruns the fields and is found to be almost ineradicable wherever it has once obtained a footing. It is usual to abandon the lands thus attacked, in the hope that the *kans* may use up the soil, and so finally kill itself out, which it is said to do in from twelve to fifteen years.\n\nThe peasantry are hopelessly in debt, and careless as to comfort or appearances. Most of the landowners have no capital, and the few wealthy *zamindars* are foolishly penurious in all matters of improvement. The land is for the most part cultivated by tenants-at-will. The total male agricultural population of Hamirpur in 1881, numbered 115,457, cultivating an average of 7\u00b725 acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the soil, amounted to 336,029, or 66\u00b723 per cent. of the total District population. Of the total area of 2288\u00b75 square miles, 2259 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 1290 square miles are under cultivation, 594 square miles are cultivable, and the remainder is uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on\nland, \u00a3126,805, or 3s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental actually paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3157,543, or 3s. 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Rents vary much with the nature of the soil; the best lands are returned at from 12s. to \u00a31, 4s. per acre; the poorest at from 2s. to 4s. Few farms extend to 100 acres; from 20 to 25 acres form a fair-sized holding. The rates of wages are as follow:\u2014Smiths, 4\u00bdd. to 6d. per diem; bricklayers and carpenters, 3\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd.; labourers in towns, 3d.\u2014in villages, 2\u00bdd. Wages have risen from 15 to 100 per cent. during the last twenty years. The average prices of food-grains for the ten years 1861\u201371 are as follow:\u2014Gram, 4s. 8d. per cwt.; bajra, 4s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt.; wheat, 6s. 2\u00bdd. per cwt.; barley, 4s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt. On the whole, prices have been rising of late years, although in 1882\u201383, owing to an exceptionally favourable season, they ranged somewhat below the averages given above. Gram was quoted at 3s. 6d. per cwt.; bajra, 4s. per cwt.; wheat, 7s. per cwt.; and jodr, 4s. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District of Ham\u00edrpur is little subject to blight or flood; but droughts and their concomitant, famine, are unhappily common. The last great famine was that of 1837, which produced so deep an effect upon the native mind that the peasantry still employ it as an era by which to calculate their ages. The scarcity of 1868\u201369 was severely felt in Ham\u00edrpur, though most of the deaths which it induced were due to disease rather than to actual starvation. It pressed more heavily on the upland villages than on the country near the banks of the Jumna. Symptoms of distress first appeared early in the year 1869, and the scarcity was not allayed till November. Relief measures were adopted in March, partly by gratuitous distribution, chiefly by means of local works. During the whole period of distress, a daily average of 546 persons received aid, and 2736 persons were employed on famine works. Gram, the staple food of the people, rose from its average of 4s. 8d. per cwt. to a maximum of 10s. 8d. per cwt. in September. Famine rates may be considered to be reached when gram sells at 8s. 10d. per cwt., and Government relief then becomes necessary. This test, however, cannot altogether be relied on, as the cultivators cease to employ labour on the approach of scarcity, and prices become merely nominal, the poorer classes having no money to purchase food. In portions of the District, a regular scale of remission of revenue and rent, in famines of varying intensities, has been drawn up, and neither Government nor the samindars are permitted to recover more than the stipulated proportion. The means of communication are now probably sufficient to avert the extremity of famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commerce of Ham\u00edrpur District is chiefly carried on by means of its great river highway\u2014the Jumna. The cotton and grain, which form the staple exports, are carried down-\nward; while rice, sugar, tobacco, and Manchester goods constitute the chief imports upward. The navigation between Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and Agra is rendered dangerous by shoals, rocks, and sunken trees. Efforts have been made to improve this part of the river, but with little success. About one-fourth of the grain raised in the District is exported, and the remainder used for home consumption. The manufactures consist of coarse cotton cloth and soapstone ornaments. No railway passes through the District, and the nearest station is Mauh\u00e1r, on the East Indian main line, about 30 miles from the town of Ham\u00edrpur. There is only one metalled road, between Ham\u00edrpur and Naug\u00e1on, 70 miles in length, with a branch from B\u00e1n\u00e1 meeting it at Kabrai; and there are four other fair-weather roads. There is no printing-press in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The first land settlement, in 1805, included only a small portion of the present District; and much of the revenue was necessarily remitted, owing to the depredations of freebooting chiefs. The second arrangement, two years later, was equally futile, from the same cause, and from the badness of the seasons. From 1809 till 1842, the assessments were several times increased, in face of the fact that the revenue could not be collected through the poverty of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. Large balances were constantly accruing. Unfortunately the area and fiscal divisions for these settlements varied so much that the statistics are not available for purposes of comparison. In 1842, the District had become so impoverished that a considerable decrease in the Government demand became imperatively necessary. The incidence of the land revenue was accordingly altered in that year from 3s. 10\u00bdd. per acre on the cultivated area, to 3s. 3\u00bdd. This settlement, which continued in force until 1872, is considered to have been a fair one, and succeeded in removing the pressure of former assessments. The total land revenue demand for 1870\u201371 amounted to \u00a3108,410, of which \u00a3108,332 was collected. In 1881, out of a total revenue of \u00a3116,448, \u00a3106,828 was derived from the land-tax. The number of estates in 1870\u201371 was registered at 1127, and the proprietors or coparceners at 28,086. Average land revenue paid by each estate, \u00a396, 4s., and by each proprietor, \u00a33, 18s. In 1882 there were 1450 estates on the rent-roll, assessed at an average of \u00a373, 16s. 3d. each.\n\nThe District is administered by a Magistrate, Assistant Magistrate, 2 Deputy Collectors, and 5 tahs\u00edld\u00e1rs. The District contained in 1881, 12 civil and revenue, and 12 magisterial courts. In the same year there were 26 police stations and 4 outposts, with a regular police force of 549 officers and men, including 133 municipal or town police; giving 1 policeman to every 4'17 square miles and to every 924 inhabitants. The cost of the police\nwas \u00a36262, of which \u00a35407 was paid by the State. The regular police were supplemented by 1953 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), or 1 to every 260 inhabitants, maintained by the villages and landholders. The District contains one jail, with an average daily number of 195 prisoners in 1881. Education makes but slow progress. In 1850 there were only 1078 persons under instruction in the District. In 1860 there were 104 schools, attended by 1414 pupils. By 1870 the number of schools had increased to 112, and the pupils to 3066. In 1881 the number of Government-inspected schools had fallen to 91, but the pupils had increased to 3557. This is exclusive of uninspected private schools, for which no details are available. The Census Report, however, returns 4286 boys and 21 girls as under instruction in 1881, besides 13,052 males and 67 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The greater part of the expense of education is borne by Government. The District is divided into 7 fiscal divisions (parg\u00e1nds). It contains no municipal towns at present, as R\u00e1th, which for a short time was erected into a municipality, found its trade impaired by the octroi, and was accordingly relieved of its burdens.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Ham\u00edrpur District is dry and hot, owing to the absence of shade and the bareness of the soil, except in the neighbourhood of the M\u00e1lhoba lakes, which cool and moisten the surrounding atmosphere. No accurate thermometrical observations have yet been taken. The rainfall was 17\u00b72 inches in 1868\u201369 (the year of scarcity); 37\u00b71 inches in 1869\u201370; 38\u00b71 inches in 1870\u201371; and 27\u00b731 inches in 1881, the average for the previous thirty years being returned at 31\u00b778 inches. In 1882, which was a very unhealthy year, the total number of deaths recorded was 19,562, being at the rate of 38\u00b749 to each thousand inhabitants. Of these, 9261, or 18\u00b779 per thousand, were assigned to fever (which is endemic in the District), and 5216, or 10\u00b758 per thousand, to bowel complaints. Ham\u00edrpur is comparatively free from small-pox, only 147 deaths, or '30 per thousand, being due to this cause in 1882. Snake-bites and the attacks of wild animals were answerable for 113 deaths; and 38 were attributed to suicide. There are charitable dispensaries at Ham\u00edrpur, M\u00e1lhoba, and R\u00e1th. In 1882 they afforded medical relief to 588 in-door and 11,677 out-door patients. [For further information regarding Ham\u00edrpur, see the Settlement Report of the District, by W. E. Neale, Esq., dated 1st July 1868; also Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. i. pp. 138\u2013189 (Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1874); the North-Western Provinces Census Report (1881); and the Administration and Departmental Reports for the North-Western Provinces and Oudh from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nHam\u00edrpur.\u2014Northern tahsil of Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces; comprising the parg\u00e1nds of Ham\u00edrpur and Sumerpur, vol. v.\nand consisting of the narrow tongue of land enclosed by the confluence of the Betw\u00e1 and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), together with a large strip of country on the eastern bank of the former river. Area, 375 square miles, of which 218\u00bd are cultivated. Population (1872) 95,388; (1881) 75,398, namely, males 37,936, and females 37,462, showing a decrease of 19,990, or 20\u00b79 per cent. in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 71,215; Muhammadans, 4168; and 'others,' 15. Of the 124 villages comprising the tahsil, 79 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a317,945; total Government revenue, \u00a320,103; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a334,197; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 1s. 6d.\n\nHam\u00edrpur.\u2014Administrative head-quarters of Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces.

Possesses little importance apart from the presence of the civil station. Ruins of Ham\u00edr's fort and a few Musalm\u00e1n tombs form the only relics of antiquity. Several Europeans were murdered here during the Mutiny. The public buildings consist of the courthouse, treasury, police station, hospital, jail, dispensary, school, circuit-house, travellers' bungalow, two sard\u00e1s, b\u00e1z\u00e1r. No manufactures; small trade in grain. The civil station is small, and deficient in houses and roads. The town lies on the route from Nowgong to Cawnpur; distant from B\u00e1n\u00e1da 39 miles south, from K\u00e1lpi 28 south-east, from Agra 155 south-east, from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d 110 north-west. Local taxation supports a municipal police of 12 men, at an annual cost of \u00a381.\n\nHam\u00edrpur.\u2014Southern tahsil of K\u00e1ngr\u00e1 District, Punjab; consisting of a wild mountain country, but more thickly inhabited than the other portions of the District. Area, 644 square miles. Population (1881) 176,609, namely, males 90,619, and females 85,990; average density, 274 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 170,555; Muhammadans, 5774; Sikhs, 161; 'others,' 119. The revenue of the tahsil in 1882-83 was \u00a310,601. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r and 2 honorary magistrates, presiding over 3 civil and 3 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s), 3; strength of regular police, 50 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 125.\n\nHampi.\u2014Ruined city in Bellary District, Madras Presidency.\nLatitude $15^\\circ 19' 50''$ N., longitude $76^\\circ 30' 10''$ E.; on the south bank of the Tungabhadra, 36 miles north-west of Bellary. The site of the ancient capital of the Vijayanagar kings. The ruins cover 9 square males, including Kamalapur on the south, and Anagundi, the later seat of the dynasty.\n\nHampi was founded on the fall of the Ballala dynasty, about 1336 A.D., by two brothers, Bukka and Harihara, whose descendants flourished here till the battle of Talikot, 1564, and afterwards at Anagundi, Vellore, and Chandragiri for another century, until finally overwhelmed by the advancing powers of Bijapur and Golconda. During the two and a quarter centuries that the Vijayanagar Rajas held the city of Hampi, they extended it and beautified it with palaces and temples.\n\nEdwardo Barbessa describes the capital as 'of great extent, highly populous, and the seat of an active commerce in country diamonds, rubies from Pegu, silks of China and Alexandria and Cuinabar, camphor, musk, pepper, and sandal from Malabar.' The palaces of the king and his ministers, and the temples, are described as 'stately buildings of stone,' but the greater part of the population lived in 'hovels of straw and mud.' In the travels of Caesar Frederic, the palace is thus spoken of: 'I have seen many kings' courts, yet have never seen anything to compare with the royal palace of Bijanuggur, which hath nine gates. First, when you go into that part where the king lodged, there are five great gates, kept by captains and soldiers. Within these are four lesser gates, which are kept by porters, and through these you enter into a very fair court at the end.' He describes the city as being 24 miles round, enclosing several hills. The ordinary dwellings were mean buildings with earthen walls, but the three palaces and the pagodas were all built of fine marble. Of the remains of all this greatness now visible, Mr. J. Kelsall, in his Manual of the Bellary District (Madras, 1872), says: 'Many of the buildings are now so destroyed that it is difficult to say what they were originally meant for, but the massive style of architecture and the huge stones that have been employed in their construction at once attract attention. Close to Kamalapur there is a fine stone aqueduct, and a building which has at some time or other been a bath. The use of the arch in the doorways, and the embellishments used in decorating the inner rooms, show that the design of this building was considerably modified by the Musalmans, even if it was not constructed by them altogether. A little to the south of this is a very fine temple, of which the outer and inner walls are covered with spirited basso-relievos, representing hunting scenes and incidents in the Ramayana.- The four centre pillars are of a kind of black marble, handsomely carved. The flooring of the temple, originally large slabs of stone, has\nbeen torn up and utterly ruined by persons in search of treasure, which is supposed to be buried both here and in other parts of the ruins. The use of another covered building close by, with numerous underground passages, has not been ascertained. It also is covered with basso-relievos, in one of which a lion is represented. At a little distance is the building generally known as the \"Elephant Stables,\" and there seems no reason to doubt that it was used for this purpose. Two other buildings, which, with the \"Elephant Stables,\" form roughly three sides of a square, are said to have been the concert hall and the council room. Both, but especially the latter, have been very fine buildings.\n\nBesides these, the remains of the san\u00e1n\u00e1 and the arena are still visible. But the huge monoliths applied to various purposes form perhaps the most distinctive feature of these ruins\u2014one, a water-trough, is $41\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long; another, a statue of Siva, 35 feet high. There are two fine temples, between which the road passes, but which are remarkable for nothing but the enormous size of the stones which have been used in their construction. Masses of cut granite, many of them 30 feet in length by 4 in depth, are seen high up in the wall, and no explanation can be given of the mode in which they were placed in their present position. There are also several temples in a fair state of preservation, notably one dedicated to Vishnu, about three-quarters of a mile from the palace, and close to the river. It is entirely of granite, and contains some splendid monolithic pillars, richly carved. The inscriptions at Hampi have contributed materially to our knowledge of Vijayanagar history.\n\nThere is still a great annual festival here, although the village is insignificant in size, with a population of 693 in 1881.\u2014See VIJAYANAGAR.\n\nHandia.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the northern bank of the Ganges, and comprising the pargands of Mah and Kiw\u00e1i. Pargand\u00e1 Mah may be briefly described as consisting of two low-lying tracts, with a high ridge between them, and pargand\u00e1 Kiw\u00e1i as a hollow of low-lying land between the Mah ridge and the high bank of the Ganges. The soil of the low-lying tracts in both pargands is clayey in character, the cultivated land of the former being interspersed with patches of \u00fasar waste. The soil of the Mah ridge is mainly loam, varying in quality according to position and level, and with little or no traces of \u00fasar. The high bank of the Ganges, which forms the southern edge of the Kiw\u00e1i depression, is a strip of high-lying, uneven kankar land, varying in width from one to three miles. North of this is a strip of level loam, and only in the south-west corner of the tahsil is there any alluvial soil. The tahsil is intersected by the Barnan and Bairagia ndlds, but neither of them carries any water except in the rains. Area, 296 square miles, of which 175 square miles are cultivated, 41 square miles cultivable,\nand the remainder uncultivable waste. Population (1872) 166,677; (1881) 184,754, namely, males 93,664, and females 91,090, showing an increase of 18,077, or 10.8 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 165,420; and Muhammadans, 19,334. Of the 586 villages comprising the tahsil, 478 contain less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a332,214; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a337,724; rental paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a356,101. The principal land-holding classes are Muhammadans, R\u00e1jputs, and Baniy\u00e1s. Of the Musalm\u00e1n proprietors, the Sayyids of Utr\u00e4on and the Shaikhs of Basgit are the oldest, their possessions dating as far back as the cession. Many of the R\u00e1jputs are also old hereditary landholders. The principal cultivating classes are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Ah\u00edrs, and Kurmis.\n\nHandi\u00e1.\u2014Village in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Handi\u00e1 tahsil, situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 23 miles east-south-east of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city, in lat. 25\u00b0 21' 56\" N., long. 82\u00b0 13' 50\" E. Population (1881) 1992. Besides the usual tahsili courts and offices, it contains an imperial post-office, first-class police station, Anglo-vernacular school, and dispensary. The village market carries on a trade, chiefly in hides, with M\u00edrzapur and Jaunpur.\n\nHandi\u00e1.\u2014Ancient Muhammadan town in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces, on the left or south bank of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river; with a dismantled stone fort, said to have been built by Hoshang Sh\u00e1h Ghor\u00ed of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. Latitude 22\u00b0 28' 30\" N., longitude 77\u00b0 2' E., on the route from Betul to Mhau (Mhow), 80 miles north-west of the former and 90 miles east of the latter. Handi\u00e1 was the head-quarters of a sark\u00e1r or District under Akbar's rule, and, lying on the old high road from the Deccan to Agra, attained considerable size and prosperity, as appears from its ruins. On the withdrawal of the Mughal officials, about 1700, and the construction of a better road across the Vindhya Hills, via Indore, Handi\u00e1 sank into insignificance. Ceded to the British Government by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Sindhia in 1844, but not finally transferred till the treaty of 1860. The fort commands several river gh\u00e1ts or ferries.\n\nH\u00e1ngal.\u2014Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 299 square miles; contains 1 town and 161 villages. Population (1881) 65,787, namely, 33,590 males and 32,197 females. Hindus numbered 55,462; Muhammadans, 9341; 'others', 984. Since 1872, the population has decreased by 1603.

Elevation above sea-level, 11,400 feet.\n\nHangrang.\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, between Kun\u00e1war and the Chinese territory. Lat. 31\u00b0 48' N., long. 78\u00b0 35' E. Thornton states that the valley to the south is well wooded and cultivated, but the northern slope is thickly covered with snow. Elevation of crest above sea-level, 14,800 feet.\n\nHangu (or Miranz\u00e1i).\u2014Western tahsil of Koh\u00e1t District, Punjab; consisting of the Miranz\u00e1i valley, inhabited by a tribe of Bangash Path\u00e1ns. It is divided into the tapp\u00e1s of Upper and Lower Miranz\u00e1i. Upper or Western Miranz\u00e1i was annexed in 1851, but British government was not really established till 1855. It long remained a wild, lawless tract. Area, 419 square miles. Population (1868) 36,060; (1881) 36,308, namely, males 21,479, and females 14,829; average density, 87 persons per square mile.

Picturesquely situated close under steep hills on the north, with 2 shrines, one of which overlooks the village westward. Population (1881) 2918, namely, Muhammadans, 2609; and Hindus, 309. The tahsild\u00e1r of Hangu is chief of the Upper Bangash, and through him Government conducts all its dealings with the Orakz\u00e1i borderers. The town is a very old one, and is mentioned by the Emperor B\u00e1bar in his Memoirs.\n\nH\u00e1nsi.\u2014Tahsil of Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 50' and 29\u00b0 25' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 50' 30\" and 76\u00b0 22' E. long. Area, 761 square miles. Population (1881) 130,612, namely, males 71,050,\nand females 59,562; average density of population, 172 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were \u2014 Hindus, 105,781; Muhammadans, 23,014; Sikhs, 39; 'others,' 1778. Revenue of the tahsil (1883), \u00a314,244.

Lat. 29\u00b0 6' 19\" N., long. 76\u00b0 0' 19\" E. Lies on the Western Jumna Canal, and on the Hiss\u00e1r and Delhi road, 16 miles east of Hiss\u00e1r town. Population (1868) 13,563; (1881) 12,656, namely, 7663 Hindus, 5483 Muhammadans, 8 Sikhs, and 2 Christians. Founded, according to tradition, by Anang P\u00e1l Tu\u00e1r, King of Delhi. Centre of local administration under Hindus and Muhammadans, and long the principal town of Hari\u00e1na. Desolated by the famine of 1783, after which it lay in ruins for many years. In 1795, the famous adventurer George Thomas, who had seized upon the greater part of Hari\u00e1na, fixed his head-quarters at H\u00e1nsi. Thenceforth the town began to revive; and on the establishment of British rule in 1802, it was made a cantonment, where a considerable force, consisting chiefly of local levies, was stationed. In 1857, the troops mutinied, murdered all Europeans upon whom they could lay their hands, and combined with the wild R\u00e1jput tribes in plundering the country. On the restoration of order, it was thought undesirable to maintain the cantonment. A high brick wall, with bastions and loopholes, surrounds the town, while the canal, which flows at its feet, contributes to its beauty by a fringe of handsome trees. Since the Mutiny, however, the houses have fallen into decay, and the streets lie comparatively deserted, owing to the removal of the troops. A large dismantled fort overlooks the town on the north. Local trade in country produce\u2014cotton, ghi, and cereals. The streets are wider and less tortuous than in most native towns. They are, as a rule, well metalled, and the drainage and sanitary arrangements are in a fairly satisfactory condition. Tahsil, school-house, police station, sardi. There is no special local manufacture worth mentioning. Station on the Rew\u00e1ri-Firozpur Railway. Municipal revenue in 1881-82, \u00a3664, or 1s. 6d. per head of population (12,251) within municipal limits.\n\nH\u00e1nskh\u00e1li.\u2014Town and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1nd) in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the Churn\u00ed river. Lat. 23\u00b0 21' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 39' 30\" E. Seat of considerable trade.\n\nHanthewadi.\u2014District in the Pegu Division, British Burma. Occupies the seaboard from the China Bakir mouth of the Irawadi to the Hlaing or Rangoon river; known to the ancients as Bokkh\u00e1radesa, a name which survives in China Bakir, and extending northwards up the valley of the Irawadi to about 17\u00b0 N. lat. Bounded on the north\nby the Districts of Thonegwa and Tharawadi; on the east by Pegu sub-District; and on the west by Thonegwa. On the first formation of the District it was known as Rangoon, and included Baw-ru, a strip of country extending along the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yoma Hills, from the Bawrugale stream to Taung-g\u00fa. In 1864, Baw-ru was added to Taung-g\u00fa, and in 1866 transferred to Shwe-gyin; subsequently the Kawliya circle was joined to Shwe-gyin, and the Thonzay circle to Henzada; still later, a large tract in the west was cut off to form a portion of Thonegwa; and in 1883, the eastern and south-eastern townships, Pegu, Hlaygu, and Syriam were taken from it and formed into the Pegu sub-District. The head-quarters are at Rangoon town. Area, according to the Census of 1881, 4236 square miles; according to the British Burma Administration Report for 1882\u201383, 4376 square miles. Population (1881) 427,720 persons.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Hanthawadi District consists of a vast plain stretching up from the sea between the To or China Bakir, and the Pegu Yomas. Except the tract lying between the Pegu Yomas on the east, and the Hlaing river, the country is intersected by numerous tidal creeks, many navigable by large boats, and some by steamers. The chief of these are\u2014the Bawlay, with its branch, the Pakwun, communicating with the Irawadi, and practicable during the rains for river steamers; the Pan-hlaing, which leaves the Irawadi at Nyaung-don, and joins the Hlaing a few miles above the town of Rangoon, forming in the rains the usual route of river steamers from Rangoon; the Thakw\u00e1t-pin (popularly Bassein Creek), which connects the Rangoon river with the To or China Bakir, and is navigable at all seasons, river steamers using it in the dry season when the Pan-hlaing is closed.\n\nThe Pegu Yomas attain their highest elevation, namely 2000 feet, in the extreme north of Hanthawadi District, and a few miles lower down divide into two main branches with many subsidiary spurs. The western branch, which has a general south-south-west direction, separates the valleys of the Hlaing and Pugun-daung rivers, and except in the extreme south, Hanthawadi and Pegu Districts. After rising into the irregularly-shaped limestone hill called Taung-nyo, a little south of lat. 17\u00b0, it forms the laterite hills round the great Shew-dagon Pagoda, and beyond the Pegu river it merges into the alluvial plains of the delta in Pegu District, being last traceable in the rocks in the Hmaw-w\u00fan stream. The slopes of the main range are, as a rule, steep, and the valleys sharply excavated.\n\nThe principal river in the District is the Hlaing, which rises near Prome as the Zay, and, entering Hanthawadi in about lat. 17\u00b0 30' N., flows south-south-east, falling into the sea in about lat. 16\u00b0 30' N., under the name of the Rangoon river. It is navigable at all seasons by the largest sea-going vessels as far as Rangoon. Its chief tributaries in\nHanthawadi are the Okkan, Magoyi, Hmawbi, and Leingon. On the west the Bawlay, Pan-hlaing, and other tidal creeks connect it with the Irawadi. The Pugundaung rises in the southern spurs of the Pegu Yoma, and falls into the Pegu river at Rangoon.\n\nThe principal trees found in the District are the mangrove, *pyin-ma* (Lagerstroemia reginae), *kanyin* (Dipterocarpus alatus), *in* (Dipterocarpus tuberculatus), *pyin-gado* (Xylia dolabriformis), etc. There are two teak reserves, both on the western slopes of the Pegu Yomas, the Maguyi and the Kyet-py\u00fagan. The area of reserved forests in Hanthawadi District in 1884 was 554,540 acres, or 867 square miles: revenue, \u00a310,464; expenditure, \u00a316,752.\n\n**History.**\u2014Local legends, said to be confirmed by Tamil and Telugu traditions, state that in some unknown century before Christ, the inhabitants of Teling\u00e1na, or Northern Madras, colonized the coast of Burma, finding there a M\u00fan population, by which designation the Peguans still call themselves, whilst Teling\u00e1na appears in the modern word Talaing. The Palm-leaf Records assert that the Shew-dagon Pagoda was founded by two brothers who had met and conversed with Gautama Buddha in India. But the first notice of the country that can be considered as historical is given in the Singhalese *Mahawanso*, which mentions the mission of Sono and Uttaro, sent by the Third Buddhist Council (244 B.C.) to Suvarna-bh\u00fami (Aurea Regio), to spread the Buddhist faith. It seems clear that the delta of the Irawadi did not escape from the contest between the followers of the Br\u00e1hmanical and Buddhist faiths, which lasted for hundreds of years, until about the end of the eighth century the victory eventually passed to the one body in India, and to the other in Burma. One of the results of these differences was the founding of the city of Pegu, the kings of which gradually extended their dominions, until in 476 A.D. they ruled the whole of Ramanna, from the Arakan mountains on the west to the Salwin on the east.\n\nAbout 1050 A.D., the country was conquered by Anarawta of Pagan, and after this it remained subject to the Burmans for about two centuries. On the gradual disintegration of the Burmese kingdom, the Talaings rose in rebellion, and the delta remained subject to the Peguan kings for many years. During the reign of Nandaburin, the Arakanese took Syriam; and in 1560, Philip de Brito, then in the service of the Arakanese sovereign, was commanded to hold it. He, however, proved faithless, and sided with the Portuguese envoy at Goa, and seized Pegu. He was eventually captured and impaled, and the delta again passed to the Burmans till 1740, when the Talaings reconquered it, only to lose it in 1753 to Alaungpaya. In 1824 the first Anglo-Burmese war broke out, and a British force entered the river and took Rangoon. At the close of the campaign the British restored Pegu\nto the king of Burma. Disputes on matters of trade led to the second Anglo-Burmese war of 1852, at the close of which the present District of Hanthawadi, with the rest of the Pegu and Irawadi Divisions and part of the present Tenasserim Division, was annexed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Continual war and the cruelties of successive sovereigns had depopulated the country. In 1855, when Hanthawadi included all the tracts alluded to above, the population, including that of Rangoon town, was returned as 137,130. In 1881, the Census showed that there were 427,720 persons, on an area of 4236 square miles, dwelling in 1 town and 1393 villages, and occupying 72,115 houses. Number of persons per square mile, 101; villages per square mile, 3'33; houses per square mile, 17'8; number of persons per house, 5'9. The total agricultural population numbered 308,118; and the non-agricultural, 119,602. Classified according to sex, there were 239,018 males and 188,702 females. Classified according to religion, there were 408,016 Buddhists, 470 Nat-worshippers, 7908 Hindus, 4085 Muhammadans, 7227 Christians, 11 Brahmos, and 3 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. Classified according to occupation, 4371 males and 313 females were returned as belonging to Class I., or professional; 1225 males and 2522 females to Class II., or domestic; 14,469 males and 3663 females to Class III., or commercial; 88,504 males and 44,894 females to Class IV., or agricultural; 17,605 males and 17,966 females to Class V., or industrial; and 112,844 males and 119,314 females to Class VI., or indefinite and non-productive. The chief towns (exclusive of Rangoon, which is a District by itself) are\u2014Pegu, with 5891 inhabitants; Twan-te, once an important place, but now a small village; Pyawbway, with 2043 inhabitants; and Tanmanaing, the head-quarters of the Pyawbway township, with 1603 inhabitants. Of the towns and villages of the District, 601 contain less than 200 inhabitants, 594 from 200 to 500, 149 from 500 to 1000, 45 from 1000 to 2000, 4 from 2000 to 3000, and 1 above 5000 inhabitants.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014The principal pagodas in the District are the Shwe-dagon and the Sandaw at Twan-te. The Shwe-dagon is the most celebrated object of worship in all the Indo-Chinese countries, as enshrining several hairs of Gautama Buddha. Not far from Twan-te stand a few ancient pagodas, indicating the site of Khappanganagara and Min-slagon Hmawbi. Hlaing and T\u00e1nb\u00fa are sites of more modern, but still ancient towns.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The District was once highly cultivated; but the continual wars and rebellions, and later on the measures adopted by the Burmese conquerors, depopulated the land. The British annexation gave a new stimulus, and the area under rice (the exportation of which was prohibited in the Burmese times) commenced at once to increase. The richest tract is that lying between the To, the Hlaing, the Pan-\nHANTHAWADI.\n\nhlaing, and the sea, which now forms the Twan-te and Pyawbway townships. The out-turn varies from 40 baskets (about 12 cwt.) to 30 baskets (9 cwt.) per acre. In 1881-82, the total area under rice was 879,770 acres, and the total area under cultivation, 904,994 acres; in the year following (1882-83) the area under rice was 984,814 acres, and the total area under cultivation, 1,013,019 acres. The cultivable waste in 1881-82 was returned at 2379 square miles, and the uncultivable waste at 421 square miles. Mixed fruit-trees, as mangoes, jaiks, plantains and mayan (a kind of acid plum), are grown in abundance, occupying 21,615 acres in 1881-82, and 25,375 acres in 1882-83. At Twan-te is a small grove of Sapodilla plum trees, producing the royal fruit of the Talaings.\n\nIn 1860 a pair of buffaloes or plough bullocks cost \u00a310; in 1881 the price had doubled. The average holding of an agriculturist in 1852 was about 10 acres; in 1881 it was, in the case of rice land, nearly 24 acres. As a general rule, an owner of more than 8 acres hires labourers, who are paid by the season and live with the farmer. The engagement includes ploughing, sowing, reaping, threshing, and garnering; but in some parts natives of India are engaged in gangs at the harvest season. The average number of a cultivating family is 5'68, and their average yearly cost of living is about \u00a318, 10s. a year; the average cost of cultivation per acre is \u00a31, os. 9d., or \u00a324, 18s. for an average holding. This, with the cost of living, brings the annual expenditure up to \u00a343, 8s. The out-turn would be about 850 baskets, selling at \u00a37 per 100 baskets, or \u00a359, 10s., giving a net gain of about \u00a317.\n\nThe District contained, in 1881-82, the following agricultural stock:\u201453,799 cows and bullocks, 282 horses and ponies, 671 sheep and goats, 7710 pigs, 91,599 buffaloes, 34 elephants, 22,840 carts, 42,753 ploughs, and 7076 boats. The average rent per acre of land fitted for rice, is 6s. 10d.; and the average produce per acre, 864 lbs. The prices ruling in the District in 1881-82, per maund of 80 lbs., were\u2014for rice, 11s. 6d.; for cotton, 28s. 9d.; for sugar, 31s. 7\u00bdd.; for salt, 5s. 9d.; for tobacco, 34s. 6d.; for oil-seeds, 43s. 1\u00bdd.; for cocoa-nut oil, 40s.; and for earth oil, 17s. Skilled labour in 1882-83 cost from 2s. 10\u00bds. 4d. a day; and unskilled labour, 1s.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014West of the Hlaing river the country is liable to inundation. No doubt this has always been so; but the embankment along the right bank of the Irawadi, which protects large areas of land in other Districts to the westward, causes the floods\u2014which formerly spread west as well as east\u2014to flow eastward to a greater extent than before, and has not only increased the flooded area, but has made the floods higher than formerly. The flood-water enters by the numerous creeks connecting the Irawadi with the Hlaing, and, passing down the Pan-hlaing, forces back the Hlaing, causing substantial injury.\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The principal articles manufactured in the District are\u2014salt, pottery, nga-pi or fish-paste, mats, and silk and cotton cloth. The pottery and fish-paste alone are exported. Salt is made during the hot weather at various places along the sea-coast, and in the Syriam and Angyi townships, partly by solar evaporation and partly by boiling in earthen pots. The boiling season lasts for about two months, and the average out-turn from each pot may be taken at 250 viss, or about 8 cwt., which would sell for \u00a31, 16s. or \u00a31, 18s. The quantity manufactured is decreasing year by year, owing to the cheapness of imported English salt. Pots for salt-boiling are made at Kw\u00f4n-chan-gun, and in the adjoining village of Taw-pa-lway in the Pyawbway township. The price per hundred varies from \u00a34, 10s. to \u00a39. A party of four good workmen will turn out from 100 to 125 pots per diem. The cost of 100 baskets of sand is 16s.; of earth, 5s. The mixer gets 2s. a day; the wheel-turner, fashioner, and finisher, each get 6s. per 100 pots. The expenditure during a season for manufacturing 1250 pots is estimated at \u00a350, and the net profit at \u00a325. Ordinary cooking pots cost from 12s. to 16s. per 100 in the cold season, and 10s. in the rains. A water-pot costs 3d. in Rangoon city. At Twan-te are made large water or oil vessels, glazed outside with a mixture of galena and rice-water, and commonly known as 'Pegu jars.' Nga-pi and coarse mats, used for ships' holds, are made chiefly in Pyawbway. Silk-worms are reared in the Hlaing township, and silk and cotton cloth are woven in almost every house. The trade of the District centres in RANGOON TOWN.\n\nCommunication is carried on mainly by the numerous tidal creeks. The total length of water-way in the District is 492 miles. A new canal has recently been cut from the Rangoon river, opposite Rangoon to To, near Twan-te. There are 112 miles of made roads in the District, the principal being, one from Rangoon towards Prome, now taken up by the Irawadi Valley State Railway; the Rangoon and Taung-g\u00fb road from Tauk-kyan to Pegu, crossing the Pegu river by a wooden bridge, and proceeding northwards along the eastern foot of the Pegu Yomas. The Rangoon and Irawadi Valley State Railway runs nearly due north for 60\u00bd miles to the Minin river, with stations at Pauk-taw, Hlaw-ga, Hmawbi, Taik-gyi, and Okkan. The line is single, with a gauge of 3'282 feet. Another line is being constructed from Rangoon to Taung-g\u00fb. In 1884 it was finished as far as Pegu.\n\nRevenue.\u2014No records exist showing the exact revenue raised before British annexation. The amounts were fixed in viss (3'65 lbs.) of Gwek-ni silver, each of which is equivalent to about \u00a313. The total sum paid by the people in what is now Hanthawadi, Pegu, and a part of Thonegwa, has been estimated at about \u00a3114,560. In 1855-56, the\nnet revenue was \u00a354,509; in 1875-76, \u00a396,040. The gross revenue of Hanthawadi District in 1881-82 (the town of Rangoon not included) was \u00a3281,145; and the land revenue, \u00a3216,004. In the following year, the gross revenue was \u00a3266,420 and the land revenue \u00a3216,968. The land revenue, capitation tax, and fisheries yield almost the entire income. The fisheries here, as elsewhere in the Province, are leased out for a term of five years by auction, and only bona fide fishermen can bid.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Under Burmese rule, Hanthawadi and Pegu consisted of several townships, each under an officer; and the whole was controlled by a Governor, with the power of life and death, who was in direct communication with the central Government at Ava. When the British took possession, the local jurisdictions were to a great extent retained. A Deputy Commissioner was placed in charge of the District; and a myo-ok was appointed to each township, with limited judicial, fiscal, and police powers; with thugyis in charge of circles, and gomys under them in charge of village tracts.\n\nLittle alteration has been made in the general principles of administration, with four exceptions\u2014(1) the formation in 1861-62 of a regular police; (2) a few years later, of an independent prison department; (3) later still, of an educational department; and (4) the gradual division of the District, as revenue, population, and administrative labour increased, culminating in the complete separation of Rangoon town, and the formation in 1883 of three out of the seven townships into a new District called Pegu. Hanthawadi District now comprises two sub-divisions, each containing two townships. The number of revenue circles is 29. There are 6 courts, presided over by 26 officers exercising civil, criminal, and revenue powers. The Deputy Commissioner, as magistrate, can try all offences not punishable with death, and he hears all civil appeals. The average distance between a village and the nearest court is 26 miles. Gang robberies, which formerly were frequent, are now of rare occurrence. The police force in 1881-82 consisted of 2 superior officers, with 53 subordinate officers and 512 men; and cost in that year, \u00a314,268, of which \u00a314,094 was paid from imperial, and \u00a3174 from local funds. The Central and District prison is at Rangoon.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014The climate is generally depressing, though December and January are cool and bracing months, with little rain. The rains last from about the middle of May till the early part of November, and their commencement and ending is usually marked by considerable electrical disturbance. The average annual rainfall at Rangoon, which may be taken as the same as that of the whole District, is 98\u00b771 inches: the rainfall at Rangoon in 1881 was 100\u00b74 inches. In the same year the temperature ranged between 106\u00b0 F.\nas the maximum, and 57\u00b0 as the minimum. Fever, rheumatism, and pulmonary complaints are the most prevalent diseases. The hospital is in Rangoon town. The number of births registered in the District in 1881 was 7219, and deaths 5158; and in 1883\u2014births, 8320; deaths, 5643.\n\nHanum\u00e1n-betta.\u2014Peak of the Br\u00e1hmagiri, Mysore State. Height above sea-level, 5276 feet.\n\nHanum\u00e1ngarh.\u2014District and town in Bikaner State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See BHATNAIR.\n\nHanza.\u2014A principality of the Gilghit country, Kashmir, Punjab.\u2014See GILGHIT.\n\nH\u00e1pur (Hauper).\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the pargan\u00e1s of H\u00e1pur, Sar\u00e1wa, Garhmukhtesar and P\u00fath, lying along the western bank of the Ganges, and irrigated by distributaries from the Ganges Canal. Total area, 408 square miles, of which 284 are cultivated. Area assessed for Government revenue, 389\u00bd square miles, of which 269\u00bc square miles are cultivated, 63 square miles cultivable, and the remainder uncultivable waste. Population (1872) 205,140; (1881) 199,898, namely, males 105,414, and females 94,484, showing a decrease of 5242 in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 150,258; Muhammadans, 49,509; Jains, 95; and \u2018others,\u2019 36. Of 301 villages comprising the tahsil in 1881, 167 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue (at time of settlement), \u00a329,412; total Government revenue, \u00a332,534; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a359,568; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2s. 3d. The tahsil contains 1 criminal court and 5 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 66 men; village watchmen, 448.\n\nH\u00e1pur (Hauper).\u2014Town and municipality in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of H\u00e1pur tahsil. Lat. 28\u00b0 43' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 49' 45\" E. Lies on the Meerut and Bulandshahr road, 18 miles south of Meerut city. Founded, according to tradition, in 983 A.D. by the Dor chieftain Hardatta, from whom it took the name of Haripur. Perron, the French general in the service of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief Sindhia, established in the neighbourhood a system of j\u00e1girs or grants for his disabled veterans. During the Mutiny, Walid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n of M\u00e1l\u00e1garh threatened H\u00e1pur, but was obliged by the loyal J\u00e1ts of Bhatona to retire. Several fine groves surround the town, but the wall and ditch have fallen out of repair, and only the names of the five gates now remain. Population (1872) 14,544; (1881) 13,212, namely, males 6861, and females 6351. In 1881, Hindus numbered 7484; Muhammadans, 5646; and Jains, 80; Christian, 1; and 1 \u2018other.\u2019 Area of town site, 293 acres. Towards the Jam\u00e1 Masjid or principal mosque,\nin the centre of the town, the site is somewhat high, but as a rule it is level, and in places lower than the surrounding fields. Around the town on all sides are numerous small excavations often filled with water. The principal bazar, known as the Purana (old) bazar, runs from the Meerut to the Delhi gate. West of this are the Purana (old) and Naya (new) mandis or markets, and Mahadeoganj, all large business places running parallel to each other, and bounded on the north by the Khubari bazar, and on the south by the Bazaz (cloth merchants) and Halwai (sweetmeat makers) bazars, which run out west from the Purana bazar. All these bazars are well lined with shops, and form a compact business quarter. The Musalmans reside chiefly to the east, and here the character of the town is that of a large agricultural village full of cattle and all the appliances of husbandry. In the west, the houses are substantial and the streets metalled and drained with saucer-shaped brick drains; but to the east and throughout the suburbs, apart from the principal roads, the streets are uneven and unmade. Water-supply good. Tahsil, police station, school-house, dispensary, 3 sardis, 28 mosques, 29 temples. There is an encamping ground for troops outside the town. Considerable trade in sugar, grain, cotton, timber, bamboos, and brass utensils. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a31208; in 1881-82, \u00a31512; from taxes, \u00a31405, or 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population. The town was formerly the head-quarters of the famous Hapur Stud.\n\nHarai.\u2014Estate or zamindari in the north-east of Chhindwara District, Central Provinces; comprising 90 villages, of which 89 are inhabited. It consists of a mountainous country north of Amarwara, and a lowland tract opening on the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, and containing a masonry fort, where the chief resides. Area, 164 square miles. Population (1881) 13,449, namely, males 6881, and females 6568. Number of houses, 2511. The chief is a Gond, and receives from Government \u00a3512 per annum, in commutation of former privileges. Chief village, Harai, lat. 22\u00b0 37' N., long. 79\u00b0 18' E. Population (1881) 1797, inhabiting 420 houses.\n\nHaramak.\u2014Mountain in Kashmir State, Punjab; a peak of the lofty range which bounds that kingdom on the north. Lat. 34\u00b0 26' N., long. 75\u00b0 E. Thornton states that a small lake, known as Gang\u00e1 Bal, nestles on its northern slope, and forms an object of great veneration to the Hindus. Estimated elevation above sea-level, 13,000.\n\nHarasoti (Harowtee).\u2014Tract in Rajputana.\u2014See Kotah.\n\nHarappa.\u2014Village in Montgomery District, Punjab; lying on the south bank of the R\u00e1vi, 16 miles south-east of Kot Kam\u00e1lia. Lat. 30\u00b0 40' N., long. 72\u00b0 53' E. Now a hamlet of no importance, but identified by General Cunningham with the site of a town in the territory of the Malli, attacked and taken by Alexander the Great.\nThe ruins cover an area 3 miles in circumference, scattered over with large broken bricks. The principal remains occupy a mound forming an irregular square, with sides about half a mile in length. On the western side, where the mass of ruins lie, the mound rises to a height of 60 feet, and encloses solid walls built of huge bricks, apparently belonging to some extensive building. Coins of early date have been picked up amongst the d\u00e9bris. Tradition assigns the foundation of the ancient city to an eponymous R\u00e1j\u00e1 Harappa. The only modern public building is a police station; but till quite recently, Harappa ranked as head-quarters of a tahsil. It is a station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway.\n\n**Harchok\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Lat. 23\u00b0 51' 30\" N., long. 81\u00b0 45' 30\" E.; situated on the Muw\u00e1hi river near the northern boundary of the State. Remains of extensive rock excavations, supposed to be temples and monasteries, were discovered here a few years ago.\n\n**Hard\u00e1.**\u2014Western tahsil or revenue Sub-division in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces. Area, 1942 square miles, containing 1 town and 584 villages, with 30,222 houses. Total population (1881) 146,782, namely, males 76,183, and females 70,599; average density of population, 75\u00b758 persons per square mile; number of persons per village, 251. Of the total number of villages, 518 contain less than five hundred inhabitants. Of the total area of the tahsil, 926 square miles, or less than half, are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 476 square miles were returned in 1881 as under cultivation; 309 square miles as cultivable; and 141 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses, \u00a314,477, or 11s.d. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a349,108, or an average of 2s. 11d. per cultivated acre. The total adult male and female population in 1881 numbered 47,236, or 32\u00b718 per cent. of the total tahsil population; average available area of cultivated and cultivable land, 13 acres per head. The tahsil contains (1884) 1 criminal and 3 civil courts; number of police stations (th\u00e1nds), 4, besides 8 outpost stations; strength of police force, 176 men.\n\n**Hard\u00e1.**\u2014Town and municipality in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces, and head-quarters of Hard\u00e1 tahsil. Lat. 22\u00b0 21' N., long. 77\u00b0 8' E.; lying on the high road to Bombay. Being a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, it has superseded Handia, which is 12 miles distant. Population (1877) 9170; (1881) 11,203, namely, males 6018, and females 5185. In 1881, Hindus numbered 8471; Muhammadans, 2138; Christians, 244; Jains, 323; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 26; and Jew, 1. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s an \u00e1mil or governor resided at Hard\u00e1; and on the opening of the campaign of 1817, Sir John\nMalcolm made the town his head-quarters. Since the cession in 1844, this already thriving place has been further improved, mainly by Mr. J. F. Beddy, formerly Assistant Commissioner at Hard\u00e1, who among other benefits secured a good water-supply by throwing a dam across the river. Principal trade, export of grain and oil-seeds. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a33344, of which \u00a32765 was derived from taxation, mainly octroi dues; average incidence of taxation, 5s. 4\u00bdd. per head.\n\nHardoi.\u2014A District of Oudh in the Sit\u00e1pur Division or Commissionership, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 26\u00b0 53' and 27\u00b0 47' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 44' and 80\u00b0 52' E. long. In shape, the District forms an irregular parallelogram between the G\u00famti and Ganges; greatest length from north-west to south-east, 78 miles; average breadth, 46 miles. Bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Kheri; on the east by Sit\u00e1pur, the G\u00famti marking the boundary line; on the south by Lucknow and Un\u00e1o; and on the west by Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, from which it is separated by the Ganges. Area, 2311\u00b76 square miles. Population (1881) 987,630 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Hardoi Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Hardoi is a level District, the highest point lying north of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, near the G\u00famti, 490 feet above sea-level. The country continues high along the G\u00famti, with a breadth of from 3 to 8 miles, sinking eastward into the central plain, which is from 10 to 20 miles broad, and intersected by the S\u00e1i river. Beyond this plain the country again rises, forming the watershed between the S\u00e1i and Garra, with other tributaries of the Ganges, the elevation being from 470 to 480 feet. The main portion of the District is formed by the valley of the S\u00e1i. Beyond the Garra lies the valley of the Ganges, with an elevation of 396 feet at S\u00e1ndi. Towards the Ganges, near S\u00e1ndi and B\u00edgr\u00e1m, the land is uneven, and often rises into hillocks of sand, cultivated at the base, and their slopes covered with lofty m\u00e1\u00f1j grass, whose large waving white plumes form a graceful feature in the landscape. Wide \u00fasar or saline plains run through the middle of the District on each side of the line of railway, and are almost wholly uncultivable. The soil of Hardoi is lighter than that of perhaps any other District of Oudh, 27 per cent. being sand, 56 per cent. loam, and 17 per cent. clay. The rivers of Hardoi, commencing from the west, are the Ganges, R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, Garra, Sukhet\u00e1, S\u00e1i, B\u00e1ita, and G\u00famti. The first three are navigable by boats of 500 maunds or about 17 tons burden. The G\u00famti is here a small river, whose dry-weather discharge is not more than 300 cubic feet; it has high sandy banks, and is easily fordable. The S\u00e1i is also an insignificant stream in Hardoi.\n\nThere are no river marts in the District except S\u00e1ndi on the Garra,\nand no fisheries or river-side industries are carried on, with the exception of a little timber traffic on the Ganges. Several large jhils or lakes are scattered throughout the District, the largest being that of S\u00e1ndi, which is 3 miles long by from 1 to 2 miles broad. These jhils are much used for irrigation, 126,000 acres being watered from them. Large tracts of forest jungle still exist, and formerly afforded shelter to bands of robbers. Tigers have been exterminated, but leopards are still found in the northern jungles. Antelope, spotted deer, and nilgai are common. Wild duck, teal, grey duck, and the common goose are more abundant in Hardoi than in any other District of Oudh; and the chain of jhils which dot the lower levels of the S\u00e1i valley abound in all kinds of water-fowl. Fine rohu fish are found in the Garra and R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 rivers.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early traditions of this District go back to the days of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, and relate how Bal\u00e1r\u00e1m, the brother of Krishna, accompanied by Br\u00e1hmans, was making a tour of the sacred places of the land. On coming on Nimkh\u00e1r, he found certain holy Rishis engaged in hearing the sacred books read; and as one of them would not rise to salute him, he smote off his head with a blade of kus\u00e1 grass. In order to purge himself of his guilt, it was required of him that he should rid the holy men of a certain demon named B\u00fal, who dwelt in a lonely spot where now stands the town of Bilgr\u00e1m, and who used to persecute the worshippers at Nimkh\u00e1r, by raining blood and filth upon their sacrifices. Bal\u00e1r\u00e1m accordingly slew the demon, and a low mound at Bilgr\u00e1m is still pointed out as the site of his abode.\n\nPassing from mythological times, the first authentic records of Hardoi are connected with the Mus\u00e1lman colonization. B\u00e1wan was occupied by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad in 1028 A.D. The Shaikhs declare that they conquered Bilgr\u00e1m in 1013, but the permanent Muhammadan occupation did not commence till 1217. Gop\u00e1mau was the earliest conquest in Oudh effected by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r; and descendants of the early conquerors are still to be found. The settlement of P\u00e1li by a P\u00e1nde Br\u00e1hman, a Risald\u00e1r, and a Shaikh, all three of whom are represented at this day by men of property in the neighbourhood, is a curious illustration of the occasional stability of oriental families. Isauli in Bangar was also conquered by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r; but S\u00e1ndi and S\u00e1nd\u00edla were not occupied until long afterwards. The latter was the capital of a P\u00e1s\u00ed kingdom, which seems to have spread over the country down both banks of the G\u00famti and the S\u00e1i, extending from its original seat at Dhaurahra and Mitauli. The P\u00e1s\u00eds are still very powerful in Hardoi.\n\nOwing to the situation of the District on the eastern side of the Ganges, and to the fact of its commanding the fords near the great city of Kanauj, Hardoi formed the scene of many sanguinary battles between the rival Afgh\u00e1n and Mughal Empires. It was here that the Sharki kings\nof Jaunpur mustered their forces, and bid defiance to the Lodi sovereigns of Delhi. Here, again, the Khilji for a brief space rallied his forces against the Mughals, and established his head-quarters at Bilgr\u00e1m. In yet later times, Hardoi formed the border-land between the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh and the Rohill\u00e1 Afgh\u00e1ns. It was this constant passage of armies which rendered the formation of any organized government in Hardoi impossible till after the accession of Akbar. In his time, the whole of the north of the District was a jungle, and the few settlements which had been made there were mere military outposts. With the Mughals cannon came into general use; and the fords of the Ganges lost their former strategical importance, as the crossing of troops could be protected by the new engine of warfare. Hardoi then ceased to be the natural meeting-place of eastern and western India; jungles were cleared; new Muhammadan colonies were established at Gop\u00e1mau by Akbar, and at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d and S\u00e1ndi by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.\n\nIt is not clear what were the precise relations of these Musalm\u00e1n chieftains to their Hindu neighbours. The Bilgr\u00e1m family pretend to have had authority over parg\u00e1nds B\u00e1wan, S\u00e1ndi, and Hardoi. But the few villages comprising their present estate appeared to have been slowly acquired by purchase at different times, extending over a long period. In like manner, the S\u00e1nd\u00edla Musalm\u00e1ns are not even mentioned by Colonel Sleeman as landlords, and the larger part of their property was acquired at a very recent date. The country was probably covered with jungle, and the few scattered villages of Hindus were dominated by the brick forts of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The principal landed clans of R\u00e1jputs are the following:\u2014The Ahbans, really Ch\u00e1wars, who claim to be sprung from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gopi, and to have occupied Gop\u00e1mau, having previously ousted the Thatheras, about 100 A.D. The Sombans\u00eds came from Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n to S\u00e1ndi about 1400. Their chief was compelled to yield to the Musalm\u00e1ns, but he retained S\u00e1ndi for some time, and then abandoned it for Sivajipur, where his descendant still remains. The Gaurs, the most powerful clan in the District, occupy the central tract, having, as alleged, driven out the Thatheras from B\u00e1wan and S\u00e1ra during the time of the Kanauj sovereignty, about 1118. The Nikumbhs say that they came from Alw\u00e1r (Ulwur) about 1450; the Katiar from Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d about 1550; and the Bais of Gundw\u00e1 from Baisw\u00e1ra.\n\nUnder native rule, Hardoi was the most turbulent of all the Districts of Oudh. It was divided into the chakl\u00e1\u00eds of S\u00e1nd\u00edla, S\u00e1ndi, P\u00e1li, and Tandi\u00e1on, the latter including the wild tract of Bangar, east of and along the S\u00e1i, in which the P\u00e1s\u00eds, the ancestral lords of the soil, had taken refuge, and maintained a guerilla warfare against all authority, Hindu or Musalm\u00e1n, supported in many cases by their R\u00e1jput neighbours. Ahrori, in parg\u00e1nd Gop\u00e1mau, was their main residence. Colonel\nSleeman in his 'Diary,' under date 22nd January 1849, thus describes the state of this part of the country: 'Tandiagon, 8 miles west. The country level; in parts well cultivated, particularly in the vicinity of villages; but a large portion of the surface is covered with jungle, useful only to robbers and refractory landholders, who abound in the pargana of Bangar. In this respect, it is reputed one of the worst Districts of Oudh. Within the last few years, the king's troops have been frequently beaten and driven out with loss, even when commanded by a European officer. The landholders and armed peasantry of the different villages unite their quotas of auxiliaries, and concentrate at a given signal upon the troops when they are in pursuit of robbers and rebels. Almost every able-bodied man of every village in Bangar is trained to the use of arms; and none of the king's troops, save those who are regularly disciplined and commanded by European officers, will venture to move against a landholder of this District. When the local authorities cannot obtain the use of such troops, they are obliged to conciliate the most powerful and unscrupulous by reductions in the assessment of the lands, or additions to their nankar.'\n\nThis, be it remembered, was written in 1849, shortly before the annexation. Hardoi, together with the rest of Oudh, became British territory under Lord Dalhousie's Proclamation of February 1856. Since the Sepoy rebellion in 1857, civil order has been firmly established, and nothing has occurred to disturb the peace of the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Hardoi District, according to the Census of 1869, amounted to 931,377 persons. In 1881, the population was returned at 987,630, showing an increase of 56,253, or 6 per cent., during the twelve years since 1869. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be briefly stated as follows:\u2014Area of District, 2311\u00b76 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1882; houses, 147,073. Total population (1881) 987,630, namely, males 531,704, and females 455,926; proportion of males, 53\u00b78 per cent. Average density of population, 427 per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, \u00b781; persons per town or village, 524; houses per square mile, 63\u00b76; persons per house, 6\u00b77. Classified according to religion, the Hindus number 884,967, of whom 54\u00b71 per cent. are males and 45\u00b79 per cent. females. Female infanticide was formerly extremely common in Hardoi, and the small proportion of females is probably due to the fact that the offence has not yet been altogether stamped out. The Muhammadans number 102,572, of whom 51\u00b78 per cent. are males and 48\u00b72 per cent. females; Christians, European and native, 75; Sikhs, 15; and Jain, 1.\n\nThe most numerous caste are the Cham\u00e1rs, 160,939, who form 18 per cent. of the Hindu population. Next in order of number\ncome the Br\u00e1hmans, 108,981; and the 44 clans of R\u00e1jputs, 73,808. All these castes are mostly yeoman proprietors and cultivators. The other principal high castes are\u2014Baniy\u00e1s, 25,487; and K\u00e1yasths, 9495. Of lower castes, there are\u2014Ah\u00edrs, 70,358; Kachhis, 87,680; K\u00farmis, 19,014; P\u00e1sis, 72,326; Gad\u00e1rias, 35,500; Kah\u00e1rs, 24,661. The strongest sections among the Muhammadan population are the Path\u00e1ns, Shaikhs, Jul\u00e1h\u00e1s (Muhammadan weavers), Sayyids, and Mughals; but the Census Report does not give the Muhammadan population according to race or clan. In religion, the Muhammadans are returned as\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 99,458; Shi\u00e1s, 3114. The Musalm\u00e1ns reside principally in the large towns, but even in these they form the minority of the population. In some cases they have inhibited the building of temples; and recently, on a protest being made against a temple being erected by a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own land in the town of S\u00e1ndsla, it appeared on inquiry that no Hindu temple had ever been built in the town, owing to the bigotry of the Muhammadans. But such instances are not common, and Musalm\u00e1ns often join in the R\u00e1m\u00edl\u00edd, and other religious celebrations of the Hindus. Hardoi has a larger urban population than any other Oudh District except Lucknow. Out of 14 towns in Oudh containing upwards of 10,000 inhabitants, 5 are situated within this District. None of them, however, are places of any trade, and only one, S\u00e1ndi, is situated on a navigable river. The 9 largest towns and their populations are\u2014SHAHABAD, population (1881) 18,510; SANDILA, 14,865; BILGRAM, 11,067; MALLANWAN, 10,970; HARDOI, 10,026; SANDI, 9810; PIHANI, 7540; GOPAMAU, 5374; and MADHUGANJ, 3088,\u2014all of which see separately. Of these, the first seven are regularly constituted municipalities. The several villages and townships are thus classified in the Census Report of 1881:\u2014584 contain less than 200 inhabitants; 652 from 200 to 500; 418 from 500 to 1000; 184 from 1000 to 2000; 36 from 2000 to 5000; 3 from 5000 to 10,000; and 5 from 10,000 upwards.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the population into the following six main groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government servants, civil and military, and the learned professions, 7932; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1432; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 8274; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 259,644; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 42,009; (6) indefinite and unproductive (comprising 24,626 general labourers, and 187,787 male children and persons of unspecified occupations), 212,413.\n\nThe principal religious fairs are the following:\u2014At Bilgr\u00e1m, in September, on the occasion of the R\u00e1m\u00edl\u00edd festival, lasting ten days, and attended by about 40,000 persons; at Hattia Haran, during the whole month of Bh\u00e1dra (August\u2014September), attended by 100,000\npersons; at Barsuya, in April and November, the Paramhansa Sam\u0101dh festival, lasting for a single day on each occasion, and attended by from 15,000 to 20,000 persons. These, together with several smaller fairs, are held for religious purposes, and have no commercial importance.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice, wheat, and other food-grains form the great staples of agriculture. With regard to the crops cultivated, the seasons of sowing and reaping, rates of rent, condition of the cultivators, etc., the remarks on these heads made in the articles KHERI and LUCKNOW apply equally to this District. The area under crops is 863,004 acres, or 1349 square miles, being more than half the entire area. The remaining area consists of 394,309 acres available for cultivation and for grazing lands, and 214,796 acres of uncultivable waste. The area under each description of crop in 1882\u201383, including land bearing two crops, is thus returned:\u2014Wheat, 449,379 acres; rice, 25,062 acres; other food-grains, 554,646 acres; oil-seeds, 8902 acres; sugar-cane, 10,263 acres; cotton, 14,014 acres; opium, 8014 acres; indigo, 6889 acres; fibres, 2426 acres; tobacco, 7928 acres; and vegetables, 13,086 acres; total (including land bearing two crops), 1,100,609 acres. The average out-turn of the different crops in 1882\u201383 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 420 lbs. per acre; rice, 267 lbs.; inferior food-grains, 370 lbs.; cotton, 64 lbs.; other fibres, 136 lbs.; oil-seeds, 70 lbs.; opium, 20 lbs.; sugar, 1834 lbs.; and tobacco, 264 lbs. an acre. Excluding revenue-free grants, the area of the District is thus classified:\u201459 per cent. under crops; 2 per cent. groves; 25 per cent. cultivable waste; 5\u00bd per cent. barren; 5\u00bd per cent. water area; 3 per cent. roads and village sites. A plough and pair of oxen are able to cultivate 6 acres of loam or clay, or 8 acres of sandy soil. The agricultural stock in the District in 1882\u201383 was returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 377,351; horses, 1463; ponies, 13,159; donkeys, 3552; sheep and goats, 106,142; pigs, 37,139; carts, 4756; ploughs, 115,417. The average price of wheat and bajra for the three decennial periods ending 1870 are returned as follows:\u20141841\u201350, wheat 3s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt., bajra 3s. 2d. per cwt.; 1851\u201360, wheat 3s. 2d., bajra 3s. 1d.; 1861\u201370, wheat 4s. 2d., bajra 4s. 3d. per cwt. The average rates in 1870 for food-grains at the Madhuganj mart were as follows:\u2014Common unhulled rice, 4s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; common husked rice, 10s. 8d.; wheat, 5s. 11d.; barley, 4s. 2d.; bajra, 5s. 4d.; joar, 5s. 1d.; gram, 4s. 7d.; arhar, 4s. 4d.; urid, 7s. 6d.; moth, 7s.; mug, 5s. 7d.; masuri, 4s. 8d. per cwt. The average prices for staple food products in 1883 were returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 5s. 7d.; gram, 4s.; rice (best), 8s. 7d.; rice (common), 7s.; sugar (refined), \u00a32, 6s.; and gur or crude sugar, 8s. 7d. per cwt. The food-grains in common use among the peasantry are maize, kodo, bajra, and joar, made into bread-cakes; barley and gram\nparched and eaten dry; and peas, moth, and urid as pottage. Two meals are taken a day, at noon and sundown. Fish are abundant, and ought to form an important article of diet, but owing to the dearness of salt, the people are unable to cure them; and thus, while they are used as manure at one time of the year, there is a scarcity during the remaining months.\n\nLanded property in Hardoi is more evenly divided under the different tenures than is usual in Oudh. The distribution is as follows: \u2014Talukdari, 392 villages; zamindari, 802; pattidari, 765 villages. The several clans of Rajputs hold 1163 villages; the Musalmans come next with 409; and following them are the Kayasths with 158, and the Brahmins with 157. Hardoi is conspicuous for the absence of the great feudal chiefships so common in other Oudh Districts. There are only 17 talukdars, holding altogether 432 villages (comprising 364,925 acres), and paying \u00a336,035 of Government revenue. The largest estates are those of Khaslat Husain, 53,857 acres, paying \u00a35116; and of Raj Tilak Singh, 43,166 acres, paying \u00a34406 of Government revenue. The small proprietors number 21,758, holding 1588 villages, covering 1,105,000 acres, or an average of 50 acres each. The total male agricultural population of Hardoi District in 1881 amounted to 258,580, cultivating an average of 3.57 acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the soil, amounted to 724,135, or 73.32 per cent. of the District population. Of the total District area of 2311.6 square miles, 2190 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 1408 square miles are under cultivation; 483 square miles are cultivable, and the remainder uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3141,787, or 3s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental actually paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3295,534, or 6s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The average wages of a skilled workman is 7\u00bdd., and of an unskilled workman, 5\u00bdd. per diem.\n\nCommunications, Trade, Commerce, etc.\u2014The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Lucknow to Shahjahanpur runs through Hardoi for a distance of 62 miles, with stations at Sandila, Kachona, Sitapur road, Hardoi, Chandpur, and Shahabad. There are also 329 miles of raised and bridged roads, and 73 miles of minor roads, intersecting the District. The principal imports are cotton, salt, country cloth, and European piece-goods; the exports are food-grains, sugar, tobacco, horned cattle, and hides. In 1875, the value of the imports was returned at \u00a3102,952, and the exports at \u00a362,977. The only manufacture of any note carried on is in the weaving of a peculiar description of muslin known as mahmudi.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The judicial staff consists of 3 European and 6 native magistrates, besides 9 native honorary magistrates, all of whom\nhave also civil and revenue powers. The total revenue of the District in 1871 amounted to \u00a3158,676, of which \u00a3145,213, or 90 per cent., was derived from the land; and the civil expenditure to \u00a318,705. At the recent revised land settlement, between 1864 and 1868, the Government land revenue demand was enhanced by 42 per cent. In 1875 the gross revenue amounted to \u00a3170,952, of which the land contributed \u00a3151,396; total civil expenditure, \u00a318,476. The total revenue of the District showed a slight falling off in 1881-82, and amounted to \u00a3161,897, of which the land-tax contributed \u00a3131,994; civil expenditure, \u00a324,081. The regular police force in 1881-82 consisted of 448 officers and men, maintained at a cost to Government of \u00a35903; the village watch or rural police numbered 1254, maintained by the landholders or villagers at a cost of \u00a33592; and the municipal force of 137 men, costing \u00a3787 from municipal funds. Hardoi District possesses a singular immunity from crime; daily average number of prisoners in the District jail and lock-up in 1882-83, 278\u00b77.\n\nEducation has made considerable progress. In 1873 there were 4762 scholars attending 102 schools (of which 13 were girls' schools). By 1875 the number of schools had increased to 142, and of pupils to 5877. In 1881 there was a total of 153 Government-inspected schools, with a roll of 5108 pupils. This is exclusive of unaided and uninspected schools; and the Census Report in 1881 returned 5479 boys and 112 girls as under instruction, besides 18,838 males and 206 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. There are no newspapers, or literary or educational societies, in the District.\n\nMedical Aspects, etc.\u2014The climate of Hardoi does not differ from that of Oudh generally, except that it has perhaps the smallest rainfall of any District in the Province. The average annual rainfall for the fifteen years ending 1882 was about 35\u00bd inches, that of the Province generally being about 42. In 1873, the rainfall was only 21 inches, in 1874, 31 inches, and in 1881, 34\u00b76 inches, being the lowest recorded in Oudh in each year. The average mean monthly temperature for the three years 1869 to 1871 was as follows:\u2014January, 59\u00b0 F.; February, 66\u00bd\u00b0; March, 75\u00b0; April, 75\u00b0; May, 92\u00bd\u00b0; June, 94\u00bd\u00b0; July, 87\u00b0; August, 86\u00bd\u00b0; September, 82\u00bd\u00b0; October, 77\u00b0; November, 69\u00b0; December, 61\u00b0 F. No later thermometrical returns are available. Malarial fevers are the only prevailing endemic disease of the District, and are attributable to the extensive marshes. Epidemic cholera occasionally occurs, and small-pox prevails annually, generally in the cold season. Cattle diseases known as paschima and kur\u00e1 are common. The total number of deaths registered in the District in 1882 was 29,116, or at the rate of 29\u00b741 per thousand of the population. Of the deaths, 22,009, or 23\u00b786 per thousand, were assigned to fevers; 1347, or 1\u00b746 per thousand, to small-pox; and 1013, or 1\u00b710 per thousand, to\ncholera. Charitable dispensaries at Hardoi, S\u00e1nd\u00edla, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Bilgr\u00e1m afforded medical relief in 1883 to 36,928 out-door and 1076 in-door patients. [For further information regarding Hardoi District, see the Settlement Report, by Messrs. E. O. Bradford, A. H. Harrington, and W. Blennerhassett (1875-76); the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Census Report for 1881; the Oudh Gazetteer (vol. ii., Lucknow, 1877); and the Administrative and Departmental Reports for the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, 1880-1883.]\n\nHardoi.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Hardoi District, Oudh; lying between 27\u00b0 9' and 27\u00b0 39' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 52' 30\" and 80\u00b0 31' E. long., and bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, on the east by M\u00edsrikh tahsil of Sit\u00e1pur, on the south by S\u00e1nd\u00edla and Bilgr\u00e1m tahsils, and on the west by Bilgr\u00e1m. Area, 638 square miles, of which 359 are cultivated. Population (1869) 227,909; (1881) 261,107, namely, Hindus, 242,026; Muhammadans, 19,011; and 'others,' 70; males numbered 142,184, and females 118,923. Increase of population in the twelve years since 1869, 33,198, or 14.6 per cent. Number of villages or towns, 467, of which 280 contained less than five hundred inhabitants; average density of population, 409 per square mile. The tahsil consists of the 5 parg\u00e1ns of Bangar, Gop\u00e1mau, S\u00e1ra (South), B\u00e1wan, and Barw\u00e1n. It contains 1 civil and 6 criminal courts, including the head-quarter courts; 2 police circles (th\u00e1nds); regular police, 45 men; municipal police, 21; village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1s), 675.\n\nHardoi.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Hardoi District, Oudh; on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, 63 miles from Lucknow, and 39 from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. Lat. 27\u00b0 23' 40\" N., long. 80\u00b0 10' 5\" E. The town appears to have been founded more than 700 years ago by a body of Cham\u00e1r Gours from Narkanj\u00e1ri, near Indore, who drove out the Thatheras and destroyed their fortress, the remains of which still exist in the shape of large mounds. The present town is largely built of bricks dug out of the old Thathera remains. Hardoi itself is a place of no importance. It was selected as the head-quarters of the District on the occupation of the country after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, apparently for its central position. Population (1872) 7156; (1881) 10,026, namely, males 6020, and females 4006. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 7852; Muhammadans, 2107; Christians, 53; and 'others,' 14. Area of town site, 480 acres. The Government buildings consist of the usual courts, police station, jail, school, dispensary, tahsild\u00e1r's office, etc. Bi-weekly market. Hardoi has been constituted a municipality under Act xv. of 1873; revenue in 1881-82, \u00a3800, derived almost entirely from octroi; expenditure, \u00a3783.\n\nHardoi.\u2014Parg\u00e1na of tahsil Digbijaiganj, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh;\nbounded on the north by the little river Naiya, on the east by Sim-r\u00e1uta, on the south by R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli, and on the west by Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n parg\u00e1ns. The land was formerly occupied by the Bhars, who succeeded in defeating a party of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r's invading force about 1030 A.D. They continued to hold this pargan\u00e1, just in the centre of Oudh, and far from any seat of civilisation, 400 years longer, till the beginning of the 15th century, when they were attacked and utterly annihilated by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharki of J\u00e1unpur, who bestowed the estate upon one of his followers, Sayyid Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, whose descendants still reside in the town. Area, 15,561 acres; Government land-tax, \u00a33996, or at the rate of 5s. 1\u00bdd. per acre. Population (1869) 15,706, residing in 23 villages, of which 15 were talukd\u00e1ri and 8 the property of village communities. Population (1881) 13,173, namely, males 6397, and females 6776, showing a decrease of 2533, or 16\u00b71 per cent., in the twelve years since 1869. The soil is very fertile, yielding the best crops; and rents in consequence are high. In one township, Asni\u2014celebrated for its tobacco\u2014the rents are as high as \u00a34, 16s. per acre. Kurm\u00eds are the chief cultivating caste. Saltpetre and salt were formerly manufactured, but this industry has been discontinued since the British annexation. Two small markets, in Atehra and P\u00e1ra Khurd. About 15,000 maunds of wheat are annually exported to Lucknow and Cawnpur.\n\nHardoi.\u2014Town in Digbijaganj tahsil, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Hardoi tahsil; situated on the road from Digbijaganj to Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n, 12 miles north of R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town, and 4 miles east of Thulendi. Lat. 26\u00b0 28' N., long. 81\u00b0 15' E. Founded by a Bhar chief named Hardoi, prior to Mas\u00e1\u00fad's unsuccessful invasion. On the extermination of the Bhars by Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of J\u00e1unpur, a mud fort was built here, the ruins of which still exist. Two masonry mosques, and idgah, and Hindu temple.\n\nHarduaganj.\u2014Town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces. Lies in the open plain, 6 miles east of Al\u00edgarh. Lat. 27\u00b0 56' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 11' 40\" E. Area, 80 acres. Population (1872) 5205; (1881) 4520, namely, 3901 Hindus, 585 Muhammadans, and 34 Jains. Founded by Hardw\u00e1 or Bal\u00e1r\u00e1m, brother of Krishna, but containing no remains to justify this mythical antiquity. Occupied by Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs after the Musalm\u00e1n conquest of Delhi. Plundered during the Mutiny by neighbouring villagers. Fine open b\u00e1z\u00e1r lined with good shops, police station, post-office, school. R\u00e1mpur station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway lies 3 miles north; and the Ganges Canal, passing 1 mile east, carries off most of the local traffic. Imports\u2014salt, timber, and bamboos; exports\u2014cotton and grain. The canal irrigates the surrounding lands. A small municipal revenue is raised for police and conservancy purposes under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\nHardw\u00e1r.\u2014Ancient historical town and place of pilgrimage in Sah\u00e1-\nranpur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. $29^\\circ 57' 30''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 12' 52''$ E. Population (1872) 4800; (1881) 3614. Distant from R\u00farki (Roorkee) 17 miles north-east; from Sah\u00e1ranpur town 39 miles north-east. Situated on the right bank of the Ganges, at the foot of the Siw\u00e1lik Hills, close by the gorge through which the river debouches upon the plains. On the opposite shore rises the hill of Chandi Pah\u00e1r, whose summit is crowned by a temple, connected with those of Hardw\u00e1r. The Ganges here divides into many shallow channels, intercepted by islands. The town is of great antiquity, and has borne many names. It was originally known as Kapila or Gupila, from the sage Kapila, who passed his life in religious austerities at the spot still pointed out as Kapilasth\u00e1na. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, in the 7th century A.D., visited a city which he calls Mo-yu-lo, and the remains of which still exist at M\u00e1yapur, a little to the south of the modern town. He describes the site as some $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circumference, enclosing a dense population; and General Cunningham finds that the existing ruins strongly confirm his account. The ruins are thus described in the *Report of the Archaeological Survey*, vol. ii. p. 233:\n\n\"These traces extend from the bed of a torrent, which enters the Ganges near the modern temple of Sarovan\u00e1th, to the old fort of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ben, on the bank of the canal, a distance of 7500 feet. The breadth is irregular; but it could not have been more than 3000 feet at the south end, and at the north end, where the Siw\u00e1lik Hills approach the river, it must have been contracted to 1000 feet. These dimensions give a circuit of 19,000 feet, or rather more than $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Within these limits there are the ruins of an old fort, 750 feet square, attributed to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ben, and several lofty mounds covered with broken bricks, of which the largest and most conspicuous is immediately above the canal bridge. There are also three old temples dedicated to N\u00e1r\u00e1yana-sil\u00e1, to M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed, and to Bhairava. The celebrated gh\u00e1t, called the Pairi or \"feet\" gh\u00e1t, is altogether outside these limits, being upwards of 2000 feet to the north-east of the Sarovan\u00e1th temple. The antiquity of the place is undoubted, not only from the extensive foundations of large bricks which are everywhere visible, and the numerous fragments of ancient sculpture accumulated about the temples, but from the great variety of the old coins, similar to those of Sugh, which are found here every year. The temple of N\u00e1r\u00e1yana-sil\u00e1, or N\u00e1r\u00e1yana-bali, is made of bricks $9\\frac{1}{2}$ inches square and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches thick, and is plastered on the outside. Collected around it are numerous squared stones and broken sculptures. One of the stones has belonged to the deeply-carved, cusped roof of an old temple. Amongst the broken sculptures I was able to identify only one small figure of Buddha, the ascetic, surrounded by smaller figures of ascetic attendants. The temple of M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed is\nbuilt entirely of stone; and, from the remains of an inscription over the entrance doorway, I think it may be as old as the 10th or 11th century. The principal statue, which is called M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed, is a three-headed and four-armed female in the act of killing a prostrate figure. In one of the hands I recognised the chakra, or discus; in another there was an object like a human head; and in a third hand the tris\u00fal. This is certainly not the figure of M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed, the mother of Buddha, nor is it exactly that of any goddess with which I am acquainted. It corresponds best with the figures of Durga; but if the name assigned to it is correct, the figure must be that of the Pur\u00e1nik M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed, who, according to the Bhagavata, was the \"energy of the supreme, and by her, whose name is M\u00e1ya, the Lord made the universe.\" But the action of the figure is most decidedly opposed to this identification; and I am therefore inclined to assign the statue to Durg\u00e1, the consort of Siva, to whom Vishnu gave his discus, and Siva his trident. This attribution is the more probable as there is, close beside it, a squatting male figure with eight arms, which can only be Siva; and on the outside of the temple there is a Lingam, and a statue of the bull Nandi. There is also a fragment of a large female statue, which may possibly have been M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed, but it was too imperfect for recognition. As there was nothing about the temple to give any clue to its identification, I can only conjecture that the original figure of M\u00e1ya Dev\u00ed must have been destroyed by the Muhammadans, and that the vacant temple was afterwards occupied by the votaries of Siva. Outside the modern temple of Sarovan\u00e1th, I found a statue of Buddha seated in abstraction under the Bodhi or sacred fig-tree, and accompanied by two standing and two flying figures. On the pedestal there was a wheel, with a lion on each side as supporters; and as the figure was apparently naked, I concluded that it represents Ad\u00ed Buddha, the first of the twenty-four Jain hierarchs.'\n\nThe name of Hardw\u00e1r, or Hari-dw\u00e1ra, literally 'Vishnu's Gate,' seems to be of comparatively modern origin, as both Abu R\u00edh\u00e1n and Rashid-ud-d\u00edn mention only Gang\u00e1-dw\u00e1ra, or the 'Ganges Gorge' (literally, gate). Its earlier names, M\u00e1yura, or M\u00e1yapur, connect it with Sivaite worship, rather than with any form of Vishnu. Abul Fazl, in the time of Akbar, speaks of M\u00e1ya, vulgarly Hari-dw\u00e1ra on the Ganges, being sacred ground for 36 miles in length. In the next reign, Tom Coryat visited the place, and described it as 'Hari-dw\u00e1ra, the capital of Siva.' A dispute exists to this day between the followers of Siva and Vishnu, as to which of these deities gave birth to the Ganges. The Vishnu Pur\u00e1na is cited by both, as it ascribes the Ganges to Vishnu, and the Alaknanda, or eastern branch of the Ganges, to Siva. The Sivaites argue that the proper name is Hara-dw\u00e1ra, 'Siva's Gate;' the Vishnuites maintain that it is Hari-dward, 'Vishnu's Gate.' The\ntruth is that it was a scene of sacred rites long before either Sivaism or Vishnuism developed in their present forms. As the spot where the Ganges issues forth on its fertilizing career, Hardw\u00e1r obtained the veneration of each of the great religions of India, and preserves the memorials alike of Buddhism, Sivaism, and Vishnuism, and of rites perhaps earlier than any of them.\n\n'The present town,' says the Government official account of Sah\u00e1ranpur District, 'and the ruined village of M\u00e1yapur, both lie on the right bank of the Ganges, at the southern base of the Siwalik range, through which, by a gorge or natural breach, the river enters the plains. On the left is the Chandi Pah\u00e1r, on the top of which is a temple connected with those in Hardw\u00e1r itself. The river occupies the whole gorge, the width of which at its narrowest point is about 1 mile. Owing to its proximity to the hills and the great declivity to its bed, the Ganges here divides into several channels, intercepted by large islands, many of which are placed beyond the reach of high-flood water. One of these channels commences about 2\u00bd miles above Hardw\u00e1r, and flows by Hardw\u00e1r, M\u00e1yapur, and Kankhal, rejoining the parent river a little below the last town. It is from a spot on this branch, between M\u00e1yapur and Kankhal, that the head-waters of the Ganges Canal are taken. Hardw\u00e1r was visited in 1796 by Hardwicke, who calls it a small place situated at the base of the hills. Raper describes it in 1808 as very inconsiderable, \"having only one street, about 15 feet in breadth and a furlong and a half in length. Most of the houses have the upper part of brick and the lower part of stone, which is of good quality.\" The street is now fully three-quarters of a mile long.'\n\nModern Ceremonies.\u2014The great object of attraction at the present day is the Hari-ke-charan or bathing gh\u00e1t, with the adjoining temple of Gang\u00e1-dw\u00e1ra. The charan, or foot-mark of Vishnu, is imprinted on a stone let into the upper wall of the gh\u00e1t, and forms an object of special reverence. Each pilgrim struggles to be the first to plunge into the pool, after the propitious moment has arrived; and stringent police regulations are required to prevent the crowd trampling one another to death, and drowning each other under the sacred water. In 1819, 430 persons, including some Sepoys on guard, lost their lives by crushing in this manner; after which accident, Government constructed the present enlarged gh\u00e1t of sixty steps, 100 feet in width. The great assemblage of pilgrims takes place on the first day of the month of Bais\u00e1kh, the commencement of the Hindu solar year (March\u2013April), and the anniversary of the day upon which the Ganges first appeared upon earth. Every twelfth year, the planet Jupiter being then in Aquarius, a feast of peculiar sanctity occurs, known as a Kumbh-mela, which is attended by an enormous concourse of people. The ordinary number of pilgrims at the annual fair amounts to 100,000, and at the\nKumbh-mela to 300,000. The number of pilgrims attending the last Kumbh-mela in 1882 was estimated at 270,000. The total was formerly given in much larger figures. Hardwicke, an eye-witness, estimated the pilgrims to the Kumbh-mela at 2\u00bd millions. Raper, who was present at the following Kumbh-mela in 1808, placed them at over two millions. Unless these estimates were greatly above the truth, even for the whole shifting crowds which came and went throughout the festival, the popularity of the shrine has greatly decreased during the present century. Riots and bloody fights were of common occurrence amid the excited throng. In 1760, on the last day of bathing (10th April), the rival mobs of the Gosain and Bairagi sects had a long-continued battle, in which some 1800 are said to have perished. In 1795, the Sikh pilgrims slew 500 of the Gosains. Tamerlane plundered and massacred a great concourse of pilgrims at Hardwar shortly after he had seized Delhi.\n\nFrom Hardwar the pilgrims often proceed to visit the Sivaite shrine of Kedarnath and the Vaishnav temple of Badrinath, in British Garhwal, worshipping on their way at the various prayags or sacred confluences of two rivers. Large numbers come from the Punjab and distant parts of Rajputana.\n\nThe Hardwar meeting also possesses considerable mercantile importance, being one of the principal horse-fairs in Upper India, where Government purchases large numbers of remounts for the Native Cavalry. Commodities of all kinds, Indian or European, find a ready sale, and the trade in the staple food-grains forms a lucrative traffic. Great attention has been paid to the police and sanitary arrangements of these fairs, which have now been regulated as effectually as the large concourse permits. The Hardwar Municipal Union manages the funds derived from leasing the sites for booths, and has lately expended large sums upon ghats, sardis, roads, latrines, and other works of public utility.\n\nThe Ganges Canal draws its supplies of water from a branch channel of the river, close to Hardwar, between Mayapur and Kankhal. Third-class police station, post-office. Telegraph office at Mayapur, in connection with the canal works at Rurki (Roorkee). A considerable through trade from Dehra Dun passes through the town. The local business is almost entirely confined to supplying the wants of pilgrims. Hardwar Municipal Union includes the town itself and the neighbouring villages of Jawalapur and Kankhal. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a32133; from taxes, \u00a31694, or 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head of population (28,106) within municipal limits. Height above sea-level, 1024 feet. [For further information, see General Cunningham's Report of the Archaeological Survey, vol. ii.; also Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. ii., Saharanpur District, Government Press, Allahabad, 1873.]\nHarek.\u2014Village in Lahore District, Punjab; situated on the right bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), 3 miles below its confluence with the Beas (Bi\u00e1s). Lat. 31\u00b0 10' N., long. 74\u00b0 59' E. Formerly possessed a considerable trade with Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, Kashm\u00edr, and the Punjab generally; but now an insignificant place.\u2014See Harike.\n\nHarg\u00e1m.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Kheri District; on the east by Lah\u00e1rpur; on the south by Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, and on the west by S\u00edt\u00e1pur pargan\u00e1s. First constituted a pargan\u00e1 by Akbar's finance minister, Todar Mall, and included within the Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d chakl\u00e1. In 1712, a body of Gaur R\u00e1jputs took forcible possession of Harg\u00e1m town and the surrounding country; and their descendants still hold five-sixths of the soil. Area, 66 square miles, of which 43 are cultivated. The incidence of the revised Government land-tax is at the rate of 2s. 9\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 2s. 2d. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 9\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Population (1872) 23,861; (1881) 24,516, residing in 3992 houses. Bi-weekly markets at Harg\u00e1m, Kutikal\u00e1m, and Mumtazpur.\n\nHarg\u00e1m.\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Harg\u00e1m tahsil, situated about half-way on the high road between Kheri and S\u00edt\u00e1pur towns. Lat. 27\u00b0 45' N., long. 80\u00b0 47' E. Although now in a state of decay, Harg\u00e1m was once apparently a very extensive city. Local tradition tells how it was founded by the mythical Harish Chandr\u00e1 of the Solar dynasty; how it fell away after his death; how, many years afterwards, it was restored by a R\u00e1j\u00e1 named Bair\u00e1t; how it again decayed; and how it was once more rebuilt by the great Vikram\u00e1ditya in the 2nd century A.D. In 1712, a tribe of Gaur R\u00e1jputs from the west attacked and took it, and it has since gradually sunk to its present condition. Population (1881), including the surrounding villages of Sar\u00e1i, Pithu, Tarpatpur, Jal\u00e1lipur, and R\u00e1mpur Baraura, 2946, residing in 462 houses. The village of Harg\u00e1m proper contains only 328 inhabitants and 53 occupied houses. School, registration office. At a sacred tank known as the Surajkund, a biennial religious trading fair is held in the months of K\u00e1rtik and Jaisht\u00e1, that in the former month being attended by about 40,000 persons. One mosque and four Hindu temples. Bi-weekly market. Military camping ground just outside the town.\n\nHarha.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of tahsil Unao, Unao District, Oudh; triangular in shape, with the apex to the south. The Lodh family who held the pargan\u00e1 were ousted by a K\u00e1yasth named Chaturbhuj D\u00e1s, an agent of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Ch\u00e1nd of Kanauj, who thus acquired the estate, and founded 75 new villages. His family in turn has decayed, and the present representative holds only two villages. The present chief of Mauranw\u00e1n acquired the town of Harha by mortgage from this K\u00e1yasth family. The pargan\u00e1 is the largest in Unao, covering an area of\n146,167 acres, or 228 square miles, of which 100 are cultivated. Government land-tax, \u00a317,110, or at the rate of 2s. 4d. per acre. The tenures are\u2014t\u0101lukd\u0101r\u012b, 55,127 acres; copyhold, 7610; samind\u0101r\u012b, 48,245; pattid\u0101r\u012b, 34,573 acres. Principal crops\u2014wheat and gram. Soil good, but water is about 75 feet from the surface. Two small streams are used freely for irrigation, but both run dry in the hot weather. Nilgai and antelope abound. Fourteen b\u0101z\u0101rs, and three religious trading fairs, the largest of which is held in November at Kolhwag\u0101ra on the Ganges, and attended by 120,000 persons. The pargan\u0101 contains 117 villages.\n\nHarha.\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Harha pargan\u0101; about 8 miles south-east of Unao town. Lat. 26\u00b0 25' 20\" N., long. 80\u00b0 34' E. The present town was founded early in the 11th century, in the time of Mahm\u016bd of Ghazn\u012b. Prior to that date there was a village of Shaikhapur on the same spot, in the possession of the Ahirs. The chief of the village quarrelled with the Lodh chief of the neighbouring village of Indrapur. The Lodhs were victorious in the fight that ensued; Shaikhapur fell into their hands, and they rebuilt the place, called in fresh settlers, and changed the name to Harha. The K\u0101yasth family, who succeeded the Ahirs, has supplied many officers of high note at the Delhi and Lucknow courts. The town is now of no importance. Population (1869) 5440; (1881) 4847, namely, 3602 Hindus and 1245 Muhammadans. Bi-weekly b\u0101z\u0101r, Government school.\n\nHarhar.\u2014Village in Shamli tahsil, Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces; distant from Muzaffarnagar 23 miles north-west. Population (1881) 977. Has an old ruined fort, overgrown with jungle. The place is only noticeable for the turbulence of its R\u00e1nghar Musalman population, who lost their proprietary rights after the Mutiny, as a penalty for plunder and robbery. The British flying column found here upwards of forty cart-loads of plundered property belonging to merchants at Shamli.\n\nHari\u00e1 (Haraia).\u2014South-western tahsil or Sub-division of Basti District, North-Western Provinces, comprising pargan\u0101 Amorha, with portions of pargan\u00e1s Basti and Hagar; lying along the north bank of the river Gogra, and containing the town of Basti. Area, 477 square miles, of which 330 are cultivated. Population (1872) 305,222; (1881) 334,378, namely, males 169,783, and females 164,596; showing an increase of 29,156, or 9\u00b75 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 308,426; and Muhammadans, 25,952. Of 1543 villages comprising the tahsil in 1881, 1429 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a327,284; total Government revenue, \u00a330,728; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a372,818; incidence of Government revenue, 2s. per\nacre. The Sub-division in 1883 contained 1 criminal court, with 5 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 58 men, besides 428 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nHari\u00e1 (Haraia).\u2014Town in pargan\u00e1 Amorha, Basti District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Hari\u00e1 tahsil, situated on the Basti and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d road, 17 miles south-west of Basti town. Principal export, grain; import, cloth. Tahs\u00edl, police station, school, post-office.\n\nHari\u00e1na.\u2014Tract of country in Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab; deriving its name, according to tradition, from an eponymous R\u00e1j\u00e1, Hari Ch\u00e1nd, who came hither from Oudh at some unknown period, and peopled all the surrounding territory. The tract consists of a level upland plain in the heart of the District, interspersed with patches of sandy soil, and largely overgrown with brushwood, which formerly covered almost the whole surface. The Western Jumna Canal, which divides the tract into two nearly equal portions, now fertilizes villages along its banks; but under its series of native rulers, Hari\u00e1na was known as a dry region, bordering on the outskirts of the great desert. Water is only reached in wells at a depth varying from 100 to 130 feet, and the cost of constructing such a well seldom falls below \u00a3150. Well-irrigation is therefore not attempted, except in very bad seasons, when a few acres of land are irrigated for growing vegetables around the village site. The soil is of a hard clayey nature, requiring abundant rainfall, and difficult to plough. Although rich when sufficiently saturated, the tract produces almost nothing when there is a failure in the natural rains. In dry seasons, not only is there no grain harvest, but hardly an ordinary grass crop. The town of H\u00e1nsi long continued the local capital of Hari\u00e1na, till superseded in the 14th century by Hiss\u00e1r. (See Hiss\u00e1r District.) During the troublous period which followed the decline of the Mughal Empire, Hari\u00e1na formed the battle-field where the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Bhattis, and the Sikhs met to settle their territorial quarrels. In 1783, the terrible famine known as the San Ch\u00e1l\u00edsa devastated almost the whole surrounding country, which lay waste for several years. In 1795, the famous adventurer, George Thomas, took possession of Hiss\u00e1r and H\u00e1nsi. By the close of 1799 he had extended his power as far as Sirsa, and the Sikh chieftains of the Cis-Sutlej States began to fear his encroachments. In 1801 they combined in requesting Perron, Sindhia\u2019s French general at Delhi, to attack the intruder; and a force under Bourquien accordingly marched against him in 1802, and drove him out of Hari\u00e1na into British territory. For further particulars, see Hiss\u00e1r, Rohtak, and Sirsa Districts.\n\nHari\u00e1na.\u2014Town in Hoshi\u00e1rpur tahsil, Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab, situated 8 miles from Hoshi\u00e1rpur town, on the road to Das\u00faya. Lat.\n31\u00b0 38' 15\" N., long. 75\u00b0 54' E. Population (1868) 7745; (1881) 6472, namely, 4270 Hindus, 1957 Muhammadans, 244 Sikhs, and 1 Jain. Head-quarters of a police circle (thana), but otherwise unimportant except as a local trading centre. Noted for its fine mango groves, and sugar-refining. Residence of several wealthy Hindu bankers, and of Mughal families living in a street by themselves, who collect and refine beeswax. Manufacture of coarse blankets. Middle-class school; sardi or native inn; police station. A third-class municipality, with a revenue in 1880-81 of \u00a3268; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3d. per head of the population.\n\nHarig\u0101on.\u2014Village in the District of the Garo Hills, Assam; on the K\u0101lu river, on the road between the stations of Tur\u0101 and Singim\u0101ri on the Brahmaputra, about 20 miles from each of these places. A small building has been erected for the accommodation of European travellers.\n\nHarihar.\u2014Town on the right bank of the Tungabhadra river, Chit\u0101ldr\u016bg District, Mysore State. Lat. 14\u00b0 30' 50\" N., long. 76\u00b0 50' 36\" E. Population (1872) 6401; (1881) 4679. Harihar is a compound of Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Siva). According to a legend, the god and goddess united in one form to destroy a giant who won from Br\u0101hma the gift of perpetual life, and used it for the torment of gods and men. Harihar is an ancient town, and has yielded many inscriptions, some of them dating back to the 13th century. The chief temple now existing was erected in 1223. As a frontier station, the town has passed through frequent vicissitudes. In succession it was held by the Tarikere chiefs who erected the fort, and by the chiefs of Bednur; it was subdued by Haidar Al\u012b in 1763; and it afterwards fell three times into the hands of the Mar\u0101th\u0101s. Until 1865, it contained, two miles to the north-west, the cantonment of a regiment of Native infantry. In 1868, the bridge over the Tungabhadra, which carries the trunk road from Bangalore to Dh\u0101rw\u0101r, was completed. The bridge is built of stone and brick, with 14 elliptical arches of 60-feet span, and cost over \u00a330,000.\n\nHariharpur.\u2014Village in Kad\u016br District, Mysore State. Lat. 13\u00b0 30' 25\" N., long. 75\u00b0 20' 51\" E. Population (1881) 753. Has yielded inscriptions dating back to the 15th century. The head-quarters of the Koppa taluk.\n\nHarike (Harek).\u2014Village in Lahore District, Punjab; situated on the right bank of the Sutlej, 3 miles below its confluence with the Beas (Bi\u0101s), in lat. 31\u00b0 10' N., and long. 74\u00b0 59' E. It formerly possessed a considerable trade with Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, Kashm\u012br, and the Punjab towns; but is now an insignificant village, which is rapidly disappearing under the encroachments of the Sutlej. Population (1881) 970. Excellent kankar is obtained in the neighbourhood,\nwhich is sent down by boat to Firozpur. The place owed its former importance to the great Harfke gh\u00e1t or ferry across the river. But now the traffic follows the Grand Trunk Road, which crosses the river elsewhere.\n\n**Haringh\u00e1ta.\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See Baleswar.**\n\n**Haringi (or Suvarnavati).\u2014River in Coorg, which drains the north-western plateau of that territory, and ultimately falls into the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) at Kudig\u00e9, 3 miles north of Fraserpet.**\n\n**Harip\u00e1n\u00ed (or Hat\u00e1t\u00edd).\u2014River in the north of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, Assam, which rises in the S\u00e1lm\u00e1r\u00e1 Hills, and falls into the Brahmaputra opposite Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra town.

Situated in an open plain, near the left bank of the river Dor. Founded in 1822 by the Sikh Sard\u00e1r, Hari Singh, governor of Haz\u00e1ra, from whom it derives its name. It formed the administrative centre under the Sikhs, and on the British annexation in 1849 became for a time the local head-quarters; but the civil station was afterwards removed to Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d. The town is symmetrically laid out, and divided into rectangular blocks by broad and shady streets. A handsome obelisk marks the grave of Colonel Kanara, commander of the Sikh artillery in 1848, who fell bravely defending his guns against the insurgents under Chattar Singh.

Founded,**\naccording to tradition, about the 13th century by Hari Ch\u00e1nd, a R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1ngra, who built this fortress on the banks of the B\u00e1n Gang\u00e1 torrent, 9 miles in a direct line south-west of K\u00e1ngra town. Treacherously seized by Ranj\u00edt Singh in 1813. A younger branch of the princely family still resides in the town, but the elder representatives migrated under Sikh rule to the neighbouring village of Nandpur. Haripur now possesses little importance. School-house, post-office, and police station.\n\nHaripur.\u2014Village in an outlying portion of Pati\u00e1la State, Punjab, lying among the scattered territory of Simla District.

One of its branches runs within a short distance of Sarrahs; another flows towards Mashad. Three miles from Her\u00e1t, on the road to Kandah\u00e1r, the Hari R\u00fad is crossed by a bridge of 26 arches, built of burnt brick. In spring the rise of the river is considerable, but the demands of the irrigation channels between Obeh and Her\u00e1t prevent an overflow. The Hari R\u00fad is difficult to cross during the season of floods. Fish do not abound in its waters, which are said to be clear and pleasant to the taste, though aperient in their properties.\n\nHarischandra garh.\u2014Hill fortress in Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency.

Its upper course lies through a narrow valley, shut in by hills 6000 to 9000 feet in height; but after passing Khanpur it debouches into level ground, and is utilized for purposes of irrigation. After a total course of 90 miles, it falls into the Indus in lat. 33\u00b0 46' N., and long. 72\u00b0 17' E., 12 miles below Attock. The floods on the Haroh are fierce and rapid, but in ordinary weather it may be forded at almost all points. The volume is too small and the bed too rough to permit of navigation. At certain seasons the lower part of its course in Rawal Pindi District runs entirely dry, the water being all diverted to irrigate the surrounding fields. The river abounds in many kinds of fish, which, though never attaining any great size, afford excellent sport.\n\nHarowtee (Harot).\u2014Tract of country in Rajputana.\u2014See Kotah.\n\nHarpanahalli.\u2014T\u0101luk in Bellary District, Madras Presidency.

Lat. 29\u00b0 28' N., long. 70\u00b0 1' E. Tradition connects the site with the Greek invasion, and derives the name from one Hari, a slave of Alexander. The existing remains are of Hindu origin, and date back to a time before the Muhammadan conquest. A considerable fort, built by the Sikhs in 1836, is now occupied by a detachment of frontier cavalry and infantry.\n\n**Haru\u00e1.**\u2014Village in the Twenty-four Parg\u00e1sas, Bengal.

The fair lasts a week.\n\n**Hasan Abd\u00e1l.**\u2014Village and ruins in the Attock (Attak) tahsil of R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab; forming a part of the remarkable group of ancient cities which lie around the site of the ancient Taxila. Lat. 33\u00b0 48' 56\" N., long. 72\u00b0 44' 41\" E. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century A.D., visited the tank of the Serpent King, Elapatra, which has been identified with the spring of B\u00e1ba-Wal\u00ed or Panja S\u00e1hib, at this village. Successive legends of Buddhist, Br\u00e1hman, Muhammadan, and Sikh origin cluster around the sacred fountain. The shrine of Panja S\u00e1hib crowns a precipitous hill, about 1 mile east of the town; and at its foot stands the holy tank, a small square reservoir of pure water, generally full of fish. Dilapidated brick temples surround the edge, while, on the west side, the water gushes out from beneath a rock marked with a rude representation of a hand, ascribed by the Sikhs to their founder, B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak. The hill of Hasan Abd\u00e1l has been celebrated for its beauty since the Mughal times; and to the south of the shrine, on the opposite bank of the Haroh, lies the garden of Wah, formerly a resting-place of the Emperors on their way to the valley of Kashmir, but now a mass of jungle-clad ruins. Facing the garden, on the Hasan Abd\u00e1l side of the river, a tomb shaded by two ancient cypress trees covers the remains of one of Akbar's wives.\n\n**Hasanganj.**\u2014Market village in Unao District, Oudh; situated at the junction of the two roads from Mi\u00e1nganj and Ras\u00falab\u00e1d, about 4 miles from the latter place.

A small house-tax, for police and conservancy purposes, is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\nHasanpur.\u2014Town in Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh; 4 miles west of Sult\u00e1npur town. Lat. 26\u00b0 16' N., long. 32\u00b0 3' E. The residence of the Hasanpur chiefs, by the most famous of whom, Hasan Kh\u00e1n, it was founded in the reign of Sher Sh\u00e1h, being built on the site of a former village. The present town presents a poor and dilapidated appearance; but its prosperity is increasing, for whereas thirty-five years ago the population numbered only 600, in 1881 it had risen to 3978. Government school. Bandhua, a small village immediately adjoining Hasanpur, is notable as containing the tomb, and as having been the residence, of B\u00e1ba S\u00e1haj R\u00e1m, a celebrated Nanaksh\u00e1hi fak\u00edr. His sangat or shrine is tended by a mahant, who has a large establishment of disciples living upon the endowment drawn from one or two villages.\n\nHasanpur.\u2014Village in Jans\u00e1th tahsil, Muzaffarnagar District; situated 28 miles from Muzaffarnagar town, on the edge of the b\u00e1ngar or upland overlooking the Ganges khadar or alluvial lands. A mud-built agricultural village, formerly belonging to a Sayyid family, but now the property of a Hindu baniy\u00e1. Traces of the Sayyid ownership are apparent in the remains of brick-built houses, an old masjid, and the wide roadways.\n\nHasar\u00e1.\u2014Town in Dacca District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 35' 13\" N., long. 90\u00b0 20' 58\" E. The population, which in 1872 numbered 5707, had by 1881 fallen below 5000, as it is not returned separately in the Census Report.\n\nH\u00e1shtnagar ('Eight Cities').\u2014Tahsil of Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab;\ncomprising a strip of country extending 10 miles eastward from the Sw\u00e1t river, and stretching from the hills on the north to the K\u00e1b\u00fal river on the south. Lat. $34^\\circ 3'$ to $34^\\circ 25'$ N., long. $71^\\circ 37'$ to $71^\\circ 57'$ E. Head-quarters at Ch\u00e1rs\u00e1da. Derives its name from its chief component villages, which probably occupy the site of the ancient Penkelaotis or Pushkalavati. General Cunningham, however, believes the modern term to be a corruption of Hastinagara, the city of Hasti, the Astes of Arrian. (See Peshawar District and Charsada.) Area, 303 square miles. Population (1881) 69,914, namely, males 38,127, and females 31,787; persons per square mile, 2'31. The inhabitants are Muhammadzai Path\u00e1ns. The tahsil is naturally divided into two sections\u2014(1) the Sholgira, or low lands, irrigated from the Sw\u00e1t river; and (2) the Maira, or high plain, which is intersected by the Sw\u00e1t river canal, now (1883) in course of construction. Near the head of the canal is Fort Abazai, garrisoned by a detachment from the Queen's Own Corps of Guides under the command of a European officer. The total revenue of the tahsil in 1883 was \u00a310,140. It contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, presided over by a tahsild\u00e1r, with two police stations (th\u00e1nds); strength of regular police, 25 men, besides 136 village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1s).\n\nHasilpur.\u2014Town in Hasilpur pargan\u00e1, Indore State, Central India; lies 5 miles north-west of M\u00e1npur. The place is noted for its p\u00e1n cultivation, the produce being largely exported. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 Holkar has built a substantial masonry tank, which has greatly added to the irrigation of the District. The soil produces a double harvest of grapes. The pargan\u00e1 of Hasilpur is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari, or revenue survey of Akbar.\n\nHasli (or Sh\u00e1hi) Canal.\u2014An irrigation work in Gurd\u00e1spur, Amritsar, and Lahore Districts, Punjab, extending from $31^\\circ 35'$ to $32^\\circ 8' 30''$ N. lat., and from $74^\\circ 24' 30''$ to $75^\\circ 31' 15''$ E. long. First constructed about the year 1633, by Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the famous engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. Its original object was to supply the fountains and water-works of the royal gardens near Lahore, especially those of the celebrated Shalim\u00e1r pleasure-grounds; but it was utilized from the beginning for purposes of irrigation. The head-works lay close to the spot since selected for the supply of the Bari Doab Canal. Leaving the river R\u00e1vi near M\u00e1dhupur, 7 miles north-west of Path\u00e1nkot, it struck across the head of the Do\u00e1b, cutting the drainage of the hills below Dalhousie at right angles. The original Hasli Canal passed over the beds of the mountain torrents by boulder dams, which required repair after every annual flood. It then turned southward, its course coinciding generally with that now occupied by the main channel of the modern B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b line. Shortly after the occupation of Lahore in 1846, projects were set on foot for improving Al\u00ed Mard\u00e1n's work, then greatly out of repair; but, on examination, its faults of detail proved so\nnumerous, that to rectify them would have been more expensive than to dig an entirely new channel. Accordingly the B\u0101ri Do\u00e1b Canal was drawn along the same general line, while parts of Al\u012b Mard\u0101n\u2019s cutting became mere rdjbahas, or distributing streams. The total length of the Hasli Canal from its head to Lahore was 110 miles; its width varied from 15 to 50 feet, and its depth from 2 to 7 feet. The volume of water at the time of annexation amounted to 200 cubic feet per second, enhanced by the subsequent improvements to 500 cubic feet. For further particulars and present statistics, see BARI DOAB CANAL, of which work the Hasli now forms a portion.\n\nHassan (from H\u00e1sin-amma, \u2018The Smiling Goddess\u2019).\u2014District in the Ashtagr\u00e1m Division of the State of Mysore, Southern India. Hassan forms the north-western portion of the Division, lying between 12\u00b0 30\u2019 and 13\u00b0 22\u2019 N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 32\u2019 and 76\u00b0 58\u2019 E. long. The District is bounded on the north by Kad\u016br District of the Mysore State; on the east by T\u00famk\u00far District of the same State; on the south-west by the Madras District of South Kanara; and on the south partly by the Principality of Coorg. Area, 1879 square miles. Population (1871) 668,417; (1881) 535,806 persons; density of population, 285 persons per square mile. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of HASSAN, in the centre of the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The main portion of the District consists of the river basin of the Hemavati and its tributaries. It naturally divides into two portions\u2014the Malnad or hill country, which includes some of the highest ranges of the Western Gh\u00e1ts; and the Maid\u00e1n or plain country, sloping towards the south in the direction of Mysore District. The western boundary is constituted by lofty and precipitous mountains, among which the peak of Subrahmanya on the south attains the height of 5583 feet above sea-level. The rest of the Malnad is generally undulating, and presents most picturesque scenery of a park-like character. The slopes are covered with long grass or verdant crops of dry grain, and the knolls are crowned with noble clumps of forest timber, which frequently embower ancient shrines. The Maid\u00e1n has an elevation varying from 3100 to 2600 feet. The surface is also undulating, and for the most part under cultivation; the higher ridges are of a bleak, stony character. It is in this tract that are to be found the irrigation channels, which form so marked a feature throughout the entire Ashtagr\u00e1m Division.\n\nThe Hemavati, which flows into the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) in the extreme south, is the great river of the District; its most important tributary is the Yagachi. The upper slopes of the Western Gh\u00e1ts are abundantly clothed with magnificent forests, which have not yet been rendered profitable, owing to their inaccessibility. The\nfinest timber-trees are the *pun* (Calophyllum angustifolium), *som* (Soymida febrifuga), and blackwood (Dalbergia latifolia). Ebony and sandal-wood are also found, and the pepper creeper grows wild. The rest of the District is sufficiently wooded to meet the local demands for fuel. An area of 35 square miles in the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d ('abode of fog') *t\u00e1luk* has been reserved as State forest. Wild animals of all sorts abound, including the wild elephant, tiger, leopard, bear, bison, *s\u00e1mbhar* deer, antelope, and jungle sheep. Among mineral products may be mentioned kaolin, felspar, quartz, and other materials suitable for the manufacture of pottery. Hematite iron is worked in some places, and there are valuable quarries of potstone. The higher mountains are of granitic formation. The soil of the valleys is a rich, red, alluvial loam; the 'black cotton-soil' only occurs in a few isolated patches.\n\n**History.**\u2014The early history of this region is of the usual legendary character. The first authentic evidence is supplied by the inscriptions and statues of the Jains, but it would be rash to assign even an approximate date to these memorials. Even at the present day the Jains are numerously represented in the village of Sr\u00e1van-belgola, which they are locally reported to have colonized during the reign of Chandragupta in the 3rd century B.C. On the hill of Indrabetta in this neighbourhood are many ancient temples, and inscriptions cut in the rock with characters a foot long. On the adjoining peak of Chandrabetta is the colossal statue of Gomateswara, 60 feet high, which is conjectured to have been formed by cutting away the solid rock all round.\n\nReal history does not begin until the epoch of the Ball\u00e1la dynasty, which lasted from the 10th to the 14th century A.D. Their capital was at Dwar\u00e1vati-pura, the ruins of which are still to be seen scattered around the village of HALEBID in this District. The earlier kings professed the Jain faith, but the finest temples were erected to Siva by the later monarchs of the line. While the Ball\u00e1las were at the zenith of their power, the whole of Southern India acknowledged their sway. In 1311, a Muhammadan army under Kafur, the general of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, sacked Dwar\u00e1vati-pura, and returned to Delhi laden with spoil. The Ball\u00e1la prince escaped to Tondan\u00far (now in the adjoining District of Mysore), and the dynasty continued to exist for sixty years more. The monarchs of Vijayanagar succeeded to their place as lords paramount over all the territory south of the Kistna river; but the present District of Hassan ceased to be the seat of a metropolis, and became a remote Province, ruled over in a semi-independent fashion either by viceroys or by local *p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs*. The Province was known as Balam, a name properly applicable only to the Maln\u00e1d, and the capital was at Aigur. The eastern part of the District was under the rule of\nseparate chiefs. During the troubled period that followed the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire, this remote tract plays no prominent part in history. The greater part of it was subjected in the 17th century by the conquering R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Mysore, and later, the whole acknowledged the despotic rule of Haidar \u00c1lf. But Hassan District appears to have been never thoroughly incorporated into the Mysore State. After the death of Tip\u00fa in 1799, one of the local p\u0101leg\u0101rs, or hereditary barons, named Venkat\u00e1dri, was bold enough to assert his independence against the British. He was finally captured and hanged. For fifty years, from 1832 to 1881, Hassan with the rest of Mysore was under direct British administration. In the latter year the sovereignty of the State of Mysore was transferred to the young Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 on his attaining his majority.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A kh\u00e1na-sum\u00e1ri, or house enumeration of the people, in 1853\u201354 returned a total of 469,254 persons. The regular Census of 1871 returned the number at 668,417, showing an increase of over 42 per cent. in the interval of eighteen years, if the earlier estimate can be trusted. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 535,806, showing a decrease of 132,611 persons, or 24.7 per cent. in the ten years since 1871. This decrease is due to the famine which decimated Southern India in 1876\u201378. The area of the District in 1881 was 1879 square miles; number of towns and villages, 3024; houses, 132,741, of which 32,373 were unoccupied; average density of population per square mile, 285; villages per square mile, 1.61; houses per square mile, 70.64; persons per village, 177; persons per occupied house, 5.34. Classified according to sex, there are 261,416 males and 274,390 females; proportion of males to females being therefore nearly equal. There were, under 15 years of age, 105,540 boys and 97,606 girls; total, 203,146, or 37.9 per cent. of the District population. The religious division of the people shows\u2014Hindus, 522,214, or 97.3 per cent.; Muhammadans, 11,155, or 2.08 per cent.; Christians, 2393, or .44 per cent.; 25 Sikhs; and 19 \u2018others.\u2019 As regards caste, the Br\u00e1hmans number 19,045, of whom the majority belong to the Smarta sect. Of the other Hindu castes, the R\u00e1jputs number 1268; the Kom\u00e1tis and Nagartaru, or trading classes, 1542; the Ling\u00e1yats, a large commercial class, 67,973; and the Vakkaligars, agriculturists, 186,055; other agricultural castes, 97,229. The artisans number 47,516; wandering tribes, 1436; out-castes, 91,523; and \u2018others,\u2019 7153. The Muhammadans almost entirely belong to the class of Deccani Musalm\u00e1ns of the Sunn\u00ed sect. According to the Census of 1881, Sunnis numbered 10,465; Shi\u00e1s, 245; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 233; other Musalm\u00e1ns, 212. The Jains (numbering 1474 in 1881) are mostly to be found in the t\u00e1luk of Belur, and nearly every individual among them is engaged in the manufacture of brass-ware. Their former predominance in this region,\nand their ancient inscriptions and sculptures in the neighbourhood of Sr\u00e1van-belgola, have been already alluded to. Out of the total of 2393 Christians, 59 are Europeans, mostly employed on the coffee estates, and 36 are Eurasians, leaving 2298 for native Christians. According to another principle of division, there are 321 Protestants and 2072 Roman Catholics.\n\nThe only place in the District containing more than 5000 inhabitants is Hassan town, 5950. Of the 3024 towns and villages in Hassan District in 1881, 2198 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 709 from two to five hundred, 88 from five hundred to one thousand, 20 from one to two thousand, 6 from two to three thousand, 2 from three to five thousand, and 1 from five to ten thousand. The Census distributes the adult male population according to occupation into the following six main groups\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description, and the learned professions, 8779; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 524; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 2916; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 139,630; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers' and artisans, 11,890; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 97,677.\n\nThe most interesting tract in the District is the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, included within the Maln\u00e1d or hill country, where the cultivation of coffee has recently assumed great importance. This t\u00e1luk consists of 4 n\u00e1ds, sub-divided into 28 mandes. Each mande has a patel or headman of its own, who lives in a fortified enclosure, and still preserves a certain feudal superiority over the villagers. The village of Sathalli is the centre of an agricultural Christian community, founded by the Abbe Dubois. The total number of this community was 699 in 1881; they are known as 'caste Christians'\u2014that is to say, along with the tenets of Christianity, they retain all the social observances of their Hindu ancestors. At Melukot there is a celebrated temple of Vishnu, under his appellation of Krishna, which is richly endowed, and supports a numerous colony of Sri Vaishnav Br\u00e1hmans. The Jain sculptures on the twin hills of Chandrabetta and Indrabetta have been referred to above.\n\nSeveral religious festivals and fairs combined are held in the District. The chief places of resort are Melukot, Chunchingiri, Belur, Somanhalli, Hoskote, and Tirupati. At these places during certain periods from four to ten thousand people assemble.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple cultivation of the District consists of dry and wet crops in almost equal proportions. In the Maln\u00e1d or hill country, rice of an inferior quality furnishes the greater portion of the food supply; the hill slopes are cut into terraces and watered from\ntanks at the valley heads. In the Maid\u00e1n or low country, the cultivation of ragi (Cynosurus corocanus) predominates; but excellent rice is grown in the river valleys, wherever the fields can be irrigated by means of artificial channels drawn off from the rivers by anicuts or dams. The statistics of irrigation show a total of 4888 tanks in the District, and 226 miles of canals, yielding an annual revenue of \u00a348,483. The other crops include tobacco, sugar-cane, the cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms, plantain trees, and chillies. Coffee cultivation is one of the staple industries of the District, and thrives particularly well in the rich red loam of the forests which clothe the Malnad Hills. This cultivation is said to have been introduced from Mecca by Baba Budan in the sixteenth century, and had begun to attract attention when the British assumed the administration of Mysore State. The first coffee plantation was opened by a European in the Manjarabad taluk in 1843; and the cultivation has proved so successful in this tract that at the present time nearly every native has a few coffee-trees planted at the back of his house. There are now altogether 191 coffee estates owned by Europeans, and 14,454 native holdings, yielding an annual revenue to Government of \u00a32793. The cardamom plant, which grows wild on the Western Ghats, has recently been brought under systematic cultivation.\n\nThe agricultural stock of the District consists of 2824 carts and 85,147 ploughs. The following agricultural statistics for 1881-82 show that out of a total area of 1879 square miles, only 720 are under cultivation, and 224 more are returned as cultivable. The area under rice is 59,308 acres; wheat, 160; other food-grains, 302,627; oil-seeds, 32,801; coffee, 47,295; vegetables, 1052; cocoa-nut and areca-nut, 17,254; tobacco, 2490; sugar-cane, 5222; mulberry, 218. The annual out-turn of food-grains is valued at \u00a3231,000. The cattle of the country are generally of a diminutive size; but in certain parts a fine breed is to be seen, descended from the famous amrit mah\u00e1l, or royal breed of Haidar Ali, which is still maintained by the Mysore Government. In the low country, the well-to-do rayats find it worth their while to breed cattle for the hills, where, however, the rank pasturage and the humidity of the climate annually cause a great mortality. A large number of draught cattle are also required for the through trade. The total live stock of the District (1881-82) consists of 391,408 cows and bullocks, 248 horses, 2293 ponies, 3161 donkeys, 266,307 sheep and goats, and 7871 pigs.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014Hassan District is too exclusively a rural region to possess any important industries. Cotton cloth and country blankets or kamblis are woven in almost every village to meet the local demand. The winding of raw silk, and the making of such silk articles as purses and tassels, are confined to the Musalm\u00e1n section of the community.\nThe Jains, on the other hand, have the monopoly of the manufacture of brass-ware. The braziers work upon a system of advances, and the value of their out-turn for 1881\u201382 is estimated at \u00a36312, much of which is exported into the neighbouring Districts of Mysore and Kanara. Bags for packing grain are made from gunny, and also from the bark of a tree.\n\nThe exports from Hassan are large, consisting chiefly of food-grains and coffee; but the trade is chiefly in the hands of traders from other Districts. About 3377 tons of ragi, 7764 tons of rice, and 1202 tons of other grains were exported in 1881\u201382. The imports received in return are European piece-goods, hardware of all sorts, and spices. The largest weekly market is held at Alur, where considerable quantities of rice change hands. Other trading centres are Yesalurpet, Kenchammana, Hoskot, and Chennapatna. Until 1837, the District was without bridges or roads deserving the name; palanquins and pack bullocks were the sole means of carriage. The District is now brought into communication by good roads with large towns in the adjacent Districts of Bangalore, Mysore, Bellary, and Mangalore. There are no railways in the District. The length of imperial roads is 163 miles, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a32907; of District roads, 430 miles, costing \u00a33661. Three passes lead through the Western Ghats towards Mangalore on the Malabar coast, along one of which a good road has been constructed.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1881\u201382, the total revenue of Hassan District, excluding education and public works, amounted to \u00a3117,805. The chief items were\u2014land revenue, \u00a396,077; dbkdr, or excise, \u00a36307; mohatarfa, or assessed taxes, \u00a33138; forests, \u00a34072. The District is sub-divided into 9 tliluks, or fiscal divisions, with 68 hoblis, or minor fiscal units. In 1881\u201382, the total number of proprietors or coparceners was 103,529. During 1880 the average daily population of the District jail was 49\u00b77, and of the tliluk lock-ups, 7\u00b71; total, 56\u00b78, of whom 2\u00b74 were women. The figures show 1 person in jail to every 9461 of the population. In the same year, the District police force numbered 48 officers and 437 men, and the town police, 1 officer and 13 men; total, 499 men of all ranks, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a35571. There is thus 1 policeman to every 3\u00b78 square miles of area, or to every 1073 persons of the population; the cost being \u00a32, 19s. 3d. per square mile, and 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of schools aided and inspected by Government in 1874 was 243, attended by 4379 pupils. In addition, there were 147 unaided schools, with 1657 pupils. In 1880\u201381, the Report on Public Instruction in Mysore State returns a total of only 75 Government aided and inspected schools with an attendance of 2745 pupils. No returns are available showing the present number of unaided schools; but the Census\nReport of 1881 gives a total of 6256 boys and 275 girls as under instruction, besides 16,328 males and 221 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Hassan does not materially differ from that of the neighbouring District of Bangalore. The average mean temperature is about 76\u00b0 F., the thermometer seldom rising above 88\u00b0, or sinking below 64\u00b0. In the summer months of March and April, the heat is sensibly modified by the sea-breeze blowing from the west coast. From its proximity to the gh\u00e2ts, and partly also owing to the moisture engendered by the forests and marshes, the Maln\u00e2d has a temperature several degrees lower than the plains. The average rainfall at Hassan town, calculated over a period of eleven years ending 1881, is 25.23 inches; but in the Maln\u00e2d, as much as 100 inches sometimes falls in the year. In this latter tract, the south-west monsoon prevails continuously from May to August; whereas in the plains, the north-east monsoon of October brings the larger proportion of the rainfall. The Maln\u00e2d is greatly dreaded for the malarious fever which prevails after the early rains. It has been observed that Europeans ultimately become better acclimatized to its attacks than natives. The vital statistics of the District are not trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that in 1880, out of a total of 9627 deaths reported, 7114 were assigned to fevers, 643 to bowel complaints, 157 to small-pox, and 59 to snake-bite or wild beasts. In 1880, the dispensary at Hassan town was attended by 77 in-patients, of whom 8 died; the out-patients at Hassan hospital and at the dispensary at Sakleshpur numbered 10,640.\n\nHassan.\u2014T\u00e2luk in Hassan District, Mysore State. Area, 374 square miles. Population, 100,523 in 1872, and 84,460 in 1881, namely, 41,338 males and 43,222 females. In 1881, Hindus numbered 81,423; Muhammadans, 2109; and Christians, 928. Land revenue (1881-82), exclusive of water rates, \u00a317,046, or 5s. 5d. per cultivated acre. Expenditure (1882-83) on internal t\u00e2luk administration, \u00a32202; criminal court in the t\u00e2luk, 1; police stations (th\u00e2nds), 8; village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e2rs), 80. The t\u00e2luk supplies cattle and carts for the carrying trade of the coffee districts.\n\nHassan.\u2014Chief town of Hassan District, Mysore State; 114 miles west of Bangalore. Lat. 13\u00b0 0' 16\" N., long. 76\u00b0 8' 8\" E. Population (1871) 6305; (1881) 5950, namely, 4558 Hindus, 1067 Muhammadans, and 325 Christians. The original town was at the neighbouring village of Chennapatna, founded in the 10th century, and removed to the present site 200 years later. Head-quarters of the Hassan t\u00e2luk.\n\nHassangadi.\u2014See Hosangadi.\n\nHassan\u00fbr.\u2014Gh\u00e2t or pass in the Balirangam Hills, Coimbatore\nDistrict, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 35' N., long. 77\u00b0 10' E. Good road for wheeled traffic from Coimbatore via Satyamangalam to Mysore. The gh\u00e1t has an easy gradient for 8 miles to a height of 3000 feet to Dimmam. From Dimmam it is 4 miles to Hassan\u00far and 6 miles to the Mysore frontier. The road is much used, and meets the Gazzalhatti tract at Hardanhalli, in Mysore.\n\nHastinapur.\u2014Ruined city in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the bank of the Burh Gang\u00e1 or former bed of the Ganges, 22 miles north-east of Meerut. Lat. 29\u00b0 9' N., long. 78\u00b0 3' E. Hastinapur formed the capital of the great P\u00e1ndava kingdom, celebrated in the Mah\u00e1bhdrata, and probably one of the earliest Aryan settlements outside the Punjab. Few traces of the ancient city now remain; but tradition points to a group of shapeless mounds as the residence of the children of the moon, the Lunar princes of the house of Bh\u00e1rata, whose deeds are commemorated in the great national epic. After the conclusion of the famous war which forms the central episode of that poem, Hastinapur remained for some time the metropolis of the descendants of Parikshit, but the town was finally swept away by a flood of the Ganges, and the capital was transferred to Kaus\u00e1mbi. The modern hamlet of Hastinapur contained in 1881 a population of only 28 persons, 27 being Hindus and 1 Muhammadan.\n\nHastings, Fort.\u2014Fortified hill in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 25' N., long. 80\u00b0 5' E.; distant from Lohugh\u00e1t, 3\u00bd miles west. Elevation above sea-level, 6240 feet.\n\nHasu\u00e1.\u2014Town and police outpost station in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the river Tiliy\u00e1 on the Gay\u00e1 and Naw\u00e1d\u00e1 road, 9 miles from Naw\u00e1d\u00e1 and 27 miles from Gay\u00e1 town. Lat. 24\u00b0 29' 43\" N., long. 85\u00b0 27' 35\" E. Population (1881) 4203 Hindus and 816 Muhammadans\u2014total, 5019, namely, 2424 males and 2595 females; municipal income in 1882, \u00a3120; expenditure, \u00a3110; rate of municipal taxation, 5\u00bdd. per head of town population.\n\nH\u00e1ta.\u2014Tahs\u00edl in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in the south of the District, and comprising the parg\u00e1nds of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Silhat, and 6 tapp\u00e1s of pargand\u00e1 Havili. Area, 575 square miles, or 367,867 acres. Population (1872) 287,230; (1881) 371,284, namely, males 185,782, and females 185,502, showing a total increase of 84,054, or 29\u00b72 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881: Hindus, 340,439; Muhammadans, 30,841; and 'others,' 4. Out of 908 villages comprising the tahs\u00edl, 716 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a328,211. The tahs\u00edl contains 1 criminal court, with 2 police stations (th\u00e1nds). Strength of regular police, 35 men, besides 158 village watchmen (chaukiddrs).\n\nH\u00e1ta.\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, and\nhead-quarters of H\u00e1ta tahsil; situated on the unmetalled road to Kasia, 28 miles east of Gorakhpur town. The town is small and unimportant, except as the head-quarters of the tahsil, which was formed in 1872. Besides the usual courts and offices, the town contains a first-class police station, post-office, school, and dispensary.\n\n**Hatampur.**\u2014Town in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Population (1881) 2677.\n\n**Hathati\u00e1.**\u2014River in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam.\u2014See Haripani.\n\n**H\u00e1th\u00e1z\u00e1ri.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1na) in Chittagong District, Bengal; situated 12 miles north of Chittagong town on the road to R\u00e1mgarh. Lat. 22\u00b0 30' 5\" N., long. 91\u00b0 50' 45\" E. The village is separated from Kumiri\u00e1 by the Sit\u00e1kund range of hills, and attempts are being made to open out a pass between the two places by a cutting through the range. H\u00e1th\u00e1z\u00e1ri contains a thriving market.\n\n**H\u00e1thib\u00e1ri.**\u2014State forest ('1st class Reserve') in Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces; comprising about 15 square miles along the Jonk river, 20 miles from Seorin\u00e1r\u00e1n. Contains some fine teak, and a promising young plantation of the same timber.\n\n**H\u00e1thpor.**\u2014Curious tunnel on the northern face of R\u00e1mgarh Hill, Sarguj\u00e1 State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Thus described by Colonel Dalton:\n\n'Two of the spurs of the great rock, themselves rocky and precipitous, forming buttresses on the northern face, instead of gently blending with the plain like the others, have their bases truncated, and then united by a vast natural wall of sandstone rock, 150 yards thick and 100 to 150 yards in height. A semicircular or rather horse-shoe-shaped nook is thus formed, which, from the height and precipitous nature of the sandstone rock enclosing it, would be almost inaccessible, had not nature provided an entrance by a natural tunnel through the subtending wall. This is called the H\u00e1thpur. The waters collected from springs in the nook form a little stream that flows out through the tunnel. At its mouth it is about 20 feet in height by 30 in breadth; but at the inner extremity of its course of 150 yards it is not more than 8 feet by 12. A man on horseback could ride through it. The sand of the stream in the tunnel was impressed with old and recent footprints of a whole family of tigers, who had taken up their abode in this pleasant and secure retreat; but we did not find them at home. The horse-shoe embraces an acre or two of ground, well wooded and undulating, so that a considerable body of men could conveniently encamp there.'\n\nOn the southern side of the recess rises a sandstone cliff, which forms part of the main body of the hill, and contains two good-sized caves. The larger of these is 44 feet long, 10 feet wide, and about 6 feet high. It was, no doubt, of natural origin, but the walls have\nbeen finished throughout with cutting tools, raised benches have been cut out of the solid rock, and recesses partially secluded by buttresses on either side of the entrance. There is no attempt at ornamentation, and nothing to indicate that the cave was intended for a place of worship. The smaller cave is about 40 yards distant from the larger, and at the same elevation. The interior shows little or no sign of artificial excavation. Both caves contain roughly-cut inscriptions, which have been pronounced by R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra to be 'in the old P\u00e1l\u00ed character, but not of the time of Asoka.' If, as Colonel Dalton suggests, the recesses in the larger caves were designed as private apartments for females, it is more than probable that the place was used as a hiding-place for the women and treasure of the ruling family during Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 inroads. Local tradition, however, remembers nothing so modern, and describes the caves as the residence of R\u00e1ma during the fourteen years of forest exile which preceded his conquest of Ceylon. Here it was that S\u00edt\u00e1 was carried off by the demon R\u00e1vana, and two deep grooves in the rock in front of the larger cave are said to be portions of the enchanted circle which R\u00e1ma drew around her for her protection. The name H\u00e1thpor may be a corruption of H\u00e1thipola, or the 'Elephant Gate;' but it has also been suggested that the name implies that the tunnel was made by hand. It certainly bears no signs of human workmanship, and another explanation attributes it to the trickling of water through crevices in the sandstone.\n\nH\u00e1thras (Hattras).\u2014South-western tahsil or Sub-division of Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of an alluvial upland, traversed throughout by the East Indian Railway main line, and comprising the parg\u00e1ns of Hathr\u00e1s and Murs\u00e1n. Area, 291 square miles, of which 246 are cultivated. Population (1872) 207,330; (1881) 199,481, namely, males 107,109, and females 92,372. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 181,520; Muhammadans, 17,104; Jains, 839; and 'others,' 18. Of the 362 villages comprising the tahsil in 1881, 250 contained less than 500 inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a341,852, according to the last Settlement Report; total Government revenue, including cesses, \u00a346,037; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a371,271; incidence of Government revenue, 4s. 11\u00bdd. per acre. The tahsil contains 1 munst\u00edf's (civil) and 1 tahsild\u00e1r's (criminal) court, and is divided into the four police circles of H\u00e1thras, Murs\u00e1n, S\u00e1sni, and Sal\u00edmpur. This tract is remarkable for the high standard of cultivation. Of the total area, 83 per cent. is cultivable; and of this, 95 per cent. is under cultivation, while irrigation reaches 93 per cent. of the cultivable area. Roughly speaking, one-half of the tahsil is sub-divided among cultivating village communities, and one-half is held by large proprietors.\n\nH\u00e1thras (Hattras).\u2014Town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces, and head-quarters of H\u00e1thras taksil. Situated on the Al\u00edgarh and Agra road, 21 miles south of the former, and 29 miles north of the latter town. Lat. $27^\\circ 35' 31''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 6' 9''$ E. H\u00e1thras is a well-built and prosperous trading centre, with numerous brick and stone houses. Held at the end of last century by the J\u00e1t Th\u00e1kur, D\u00e1ya R\u00e1m, whose fort still stands in ruins at the east end of the town. After the British annexation in 1803, the Th\u00e1kur gave repeated proofs of an insubordinate spirit; and, in 1817, the Government was compelled to send an expedition against him, under the command of Major-General Marshall. H\u00e1thras was then one of the strongest forts in India, the works having been carefully modelled upon those of the adjacent British fortress at Alfgarh. After a short siege, terminated by a heavy cannonade, a magazine within the fort blew up, and destroyed half the garrison. D\u00e1ya R\u00e1m himself made his escape under cover of the night, and the remainder of the native force surrendered at discretion. An old temple in the fort still bears traces of the furious fire which it underwent during the assault. Since it came under direct British rule, H\u00e1thras has rapidly risen to commercial importance, and now ranks second to Cawnpur among the trading centres of the Do\u00e1b.\n\nPopulation (1872) 23,589; (1881) 25,656, namely, Hindus, 22,505; Muhammadans, 2915; Jains, 232; Christians, 2; 'others,' 2; area of town site, 256 acres. The general plan of the town is compact, and the houses are built close together. A broad metalled road skirts the entire city where the walls once stood. One wide way passes through the centre of the town from east to west, and two good roads run from north to south, dividing it into six muhallds or wards. A municipal hall and school-house stand upon the brink of a new tank; and the town also contains a post-office and Government charitable dispensary. H\u00e1thras carries on a large export trade in both coarse and refined sugar. Grain of all sorts, oil-seeds, cotton, and gh\u00ed, form the other staples of outward trade; while the return items comprise iron, metal vessels, European and native cloth, drugs and spices, and miscellaneous wares. H\u00e1thras, in fact, ranks as the great centre of supplies for the Upper Do\u00e1b, Rohilkhand, and the neighbouring Punjab Districts. In local industries, the town is noted for the delicacy and excellence of its wood and stone carving. The new line of rail to Muttra, and the broad gauge line connecting the business portion of the town with the East Indian main line, will doubtless still further develop the local trade. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a31337; from taxes, \u00a31303, or 9d. per head of population (34,932) within municipal limits.\n\nHat\u00f3\u00e1.\u2014Island and police circle in No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed District, Bengal; situated in the estuary of the Meghn\u00e1 river, and lying between $22^\\circ 26'$\nand $22^\\circ 41'$ N. lat., and between $90^\\circ 59'$ and $91^\\circ 11' 30''$ E. long. Area, 185 square miles, with 48 villages, and 4176 houses. Population (1881) 40,295, namely, males 22,062, and females 18,233; average density of population, 218 per square mile; average number of persons per village, 831; houses per square mile, 24.19; inmates per house, 9.6. Hindus numbered 8777, and Muhammadans 31,518. The island lies low, and is partially but very insufficiently protected from incursions of the sea by detached lines of embankments. Occasionally, however, at the period of the south-west gales in May and October, storm-waves roll inland sometimes for miles, as in the cyclones of 1st November 1867 and 31st October 1876, completely submerging the island, and spreading death and destruction around. In the last-mentioned cyclone, it is estimated that 30,000 lives were lost in Hati\u00e1, out of a population returned in 1872 at 54,147, or 13,852 less than in 1881.\n\n**Hatt\u00e1.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1r or estate in B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces. Area, 134 square miles, of which 66 are cultivated; number of villages, 83. Population (1881) 29,058, namely, males 14,301, and females 14,757; average density of population, 217 per square mile. The greater part of the estate consists of a fertile plain between the S\u00e1tpura Hills and the B\u00e1gh and Waingang\u00e1 rivers. Most of the uncultivated portion is uncultivable, consisting of rocky hills covered with jungle. Formerly part of the Kamtha State; confiscated by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur in 1818, who bestowed the chiefship on a Lodh\u00ed family.\n\n**Hatt\u00e1.**\u2014Village in B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces, and headquarters of Hatt\u00e1 estate; situated on high ground studded with mango trees, 8 miles east of the Waingang\u00e1 river. Population (1881) 2466, namely, Hindus, 2139; Muhammadans, 254; and aboriginal tribes, 73. The old Gond fort encircles the residence of the zamind\u00e1r, who, as an honorary magistrate, has done much for the improvement of the village. He maintains a good school and dispensary, has improved the roads, and keeps up a regular conservancy establishment. Close to the entrance to the fort is a remarkably fine baoli or well, constructed by a former zamind\u00e1r.\n\n**Hatt\u00e1.**\u2014Northern tahsil or revenue Sub-division in D\u00e1moh District, Central Provinces. Area 1007 square miles, with 1 town, 447 villages, and 26,409 houses. Population (1881) 125,060, namely, males 65,165, and females 59,895; average density of population, 124 per square mile; average number of persons per village, 279; houses per square mile, 27.8; persons per house, 4.5. Total adult agricultural population, 37,575, or 28.5 per cent. of the sub-divisional population. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 11 acres per adult agriculturist. Of the total area of 1107 square miles, 282 are held revenue-free, while 725 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 349 square miles are under cultivation, 194 square\nmiles are cultivable, and 182 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses paid on land, \u00a312,865, or 1s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rental paid by the cultivators, \u00a319,306, or 2s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total revenue of the tahsil in 1883, \u00a326,561. It contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) and 11 outpost stations; strength of regular police, 131 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 364.\n\nHatt\u00e1.\u2014Town in D\u00e1moh District, Central Provinces, and headquarters of Hatt\u00e1 tahsil; situated on the right bank of the Son\u00e1r river, 24 miles north of D\u00e1moh town, in lat. 24\u00b0 8' N., long. 79\u00b0 39' E. Population (1881) 6325, namely, Hindus, 5645; Muhammadans, 472; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 4; and Jains, 204. Municipal income in 1881, \u00a3401, of which \u00a3288 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population; municipal expenditure, \u00a3534. Hatt\u00e1 has always been a place of some importance. The Gonds had a fort near the north gate of the town, of which, however, scarcely a trace now remains. The Bundel\u00e1s built a stronger fort in the 17th century, which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s afterwards enlarged. On the cession of the District to the British in 1818, the head-quarters were first established at Hatt\u00e1, but removed to D\u00e1moh in 1835. The town has a tahsil or sub-collector's office, police station, dispensary, sard\u00ed, and Government school-house. At the market, held twice a week, a brisk trade is done in red cloth, which is exported to Bundelkhand and elsewhere.\n\nHattras.\u2014Tahsil and town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See HATHRAS.\n\nHatw\u00e1.\u2014Village in S\u00e1ran District, Behar, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 21' 36\" N., long. 84\u00b0 20' 21\" E. The residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Hatw\u00e1, a wealthy Hindu landholder, who owns 1339 out of the 5631 villages in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, besides 46 villages in neighbouring Districts. His estate comprises an area of 390,015 local bigh\u00e1s, and yields him a gross rental of \u00a3102,240, including cesses, of which \u00a327,765 is paid to Government as land revenue and cesses. The estate has been held by the present family from a period anterior to the Muhammadan conquest of the Province, and the succession is said to have been uninterrupted during a line of 102 R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nHaung-tharaw (Haung-tharaw).\u2014River in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. The Haung-tharaw rises in Siamese territory east of the Province, and flows through the range of mountains forming the boundary between the two countries. Crossing the frontier in lat. 15\u00b0 55' N., and long. 99\u00b0 E., it rushes with great velocity between high and scarped banks amongst mountains clothed with dense forest, which gradually gives place to feathery bamboos and elephant grass. Near Gyaing, where the Haung-tharaw joins the\nHlaing-bwe, patches of cultivation appear on the banks, and the country gradually slopes. The Haung-tharaw is navigable by native boats for some distance beyond Mitan, 80 miles from Maulmain.\n\n**Haung-tharaw.** \u2014 Township in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. The country is mountainous, and densely wooded with valuable timber. The chief river is the Haung-tharaw, forming the western boundary of the township. Cultivation is carried on principally on the taungya or nomadic system. Large numbers of cattle are annually imported from Siam. The route used is that from Myawadi to Kaw-ka-rut, the head-quarters of the township. In 1881 the population was 19,650, chiefly Karin; the land revenue amounted to \u00a3918, and the capitation tax yielded \u00a31150. The township contains 77 villages, and is divided into 5 revenue circles. In 1881\u201382 the cultivated area was 8839 acres, mostly under rice. The agricultural stock (1881\u201382) comprised 6473 buffaloes, 7108 bullocks, bulls, and cows, 77 goats, 581 pigs, 696 ploughs, 239 carts, and 46 boats.\n\n**Hauper.** \u2014 Tahsil and town in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces. \u2014 See Hapur.\n\n**Haveli.** \u2014 Sub-division of P\u00fana (Poona) District, Bombay Presidency.

The Vir\u00e1i intersects it from north to south, and the Andh\u00e1ri flows along its eastern boundary. Towards the west the soil is black loam.\nHAVILI OUDH\u2014HAZARA.\n\n**Havili Oudh (Haweli).**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh. Bounded on the north and east by the Gogra river; on the south by the Madha river and pargands Pachhimr\u00e1th and Amsin; and on the west by pargan\u00e1 Mangalsi.

Government land revenue, \u00a38977; average incidence, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre of arable land. A densely-populated pargan\u00e1, the Census of 1881 returning the inhabitants at 139,610, or an average of 1099 per square mile. The chief landed families are the Bashisht Br\u00e1hmans, Surajbansi R\u00e1jputs, Garg-bansi R\u00e1jputs, Bais R\u00e1jputs, Upadhia Br\u00e1hmans, Bhadarsa Sayyids, and the Kurmis of Manjadubanspur. The estates of the last-named family were confiscated owing to the rebellion of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1857. AJODHYA and FAIZABAD towns are situated in this pargan\u00e1.\n\n**H\u00e1walb\u00e1gh.**\u2014Village in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; picturesquely situated on the left bank of the Kosila, 5 miles north of Almor\u00e1. Lat. 29\u00b0 38' 25\" N., long. 79\u00b0 39' 5\" E. Elevation above sea-level, 3889 feet. H\u00e1walb\u00e1gh was formerly the cantonment of the Provincial battalion, but was abandoned on the constitution of that force as one of the Gurkh\u00e1 corps. Two tea plantations now occupy the site of the cantonment, and also the rifle range of the regiment stationed at Almor\u00e1.\n\n**Haz\u00e1ra.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 33\u00b0 45' and 35\u00b0 2' N. lat., and between 72\u00b0 35' 30\" and 74\u00b0 9' E. long. Haz\u00e1ra forms the north-eastern District of the Pesh\u00e1war Division. It is bounded on the north by the Black mountains, the independent Sw\u00e1ti country, Kohist\u00e1n, and Chil\u00e1s; on the east by the Native State of Kashm\u00edr; on the south by R\u00e1wal Pindi District; and on the west by the river Indus. Area, 3039 square miles; population (1881) 407,075 persons. Of the area, 204 square miles, with a population of 24,044, belong to the feudal territory of TANAWAL (q.v.). In all Government statistics in this article, except those of the Census, feudatory Tan\u00e1wal is omitted. The administrative head-quarters are at ABBOTTABAD.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Haz\u00e1ra forms a wedge of British territory extending far into the heart of the outer Him\u00e1layan range, and consists of a long and narrow valley, shut in on either side by lofty mountains, whose peaks rise to a height of 17,000 feet above sea-level. The base of the wedge, or open mouth of the valley, some 56 miles in breadth, looks towards the plain country of R\u00e1wal Pindi District to the south; but as it runs northward, the width of the glen rapidly diminishes, till it tapers at last to a narrow point in the romantic vale of K\u00e1g\u00e1n. This gorge, 60 miles in length, is closely contracted by mountains, which hem it in to the right and left, while beneath,\nthe river Kunh\u00e1r forces its way through the central ravine to join the Jehlam (Jhelum) at Pattan. The mountain chains which bound the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n valley sweep southward into the broader portion of the District, still maintaining a general parallel direction, and send off spurs on every side, which sub-divide the country into numerous minor dales. Ranges of the same system cut off the valleys of Agror (Ughi), M\u00e1nsehra, Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Kh\u00e1npur, drained respectively by the Kunh\u00e1r, the Sirhan, the Dor, and the Haroh, all of which are tributaries of the Indus. The intervening ridges crowd closely upon one another, leaving mere deeply-scored ravines for the excavating streams; but open and level patches occasionally occur, and gradually increase in width as the channels trend southward. At last, upon the confines of R\u00e1wal Pindi, the hills subside, and the valleys open out towards the Punjab plain. The whole amount of level country throughout the District has been calculated at from 250 to 300 square miles. The Jehlam (Jhelum) forms the eastern border of the District for 20 miles, flowing in a narrow rocky bed, through which it seethes and rushes in a boisterous torrent.\n\nThe scenery of Haz\u00e1ra everywhere presents the most picturesque and charming variety. To the north, tower the distant peaks of the snow-clad ranges; midway, the central mountains rise clothed to their rounded summits with pines and other forest trees, while grass and brushwood spread a green cloak over the nearer hills, and cultivation covers every available level slope in the foreground. The Haripur and Pakli plains consist of richly-irrigated fields, and the hill-sides elsewhere have been industriously terraced so as to make room artificially for narrow strips of simple tillage. Water also adds a charm to the landscape in every form, from the raging floods of the Kunh\u00e1r and the Jehlam (Jhelum), or the strong deep stream of the Indus, to the minor rivulets which scoop out the lateral valleys, and the three silent tarns at the head of the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n glen. Thriving villages stand in every open plain, or perch half-way up the hills; and scattered homesteads around the cultivated slopes bespeak the security of British rule.\n\nHistory.\u2014After the earliest and unknown period of its history, Haz\u00e1ra District came under the rule of four successive dynasties. These four dynasties, in order, were those of the Mughal, the Dur\u00e1ni, the Sikh, and the British. The early remains of the District apparently date back to a period as remote as that of Alexander the Great, and a number of Bactrian coins were found in Gandgarh in 1875. A group of ancient mounds, extending into the southern portion of this District from R\u00e1wal Pindi, have been identified by General Cunningham with the site of Taxila, the great city where the Macedonian invader was hospitably entertained after his passage of the Indus. With these\nexceptions, however, no relics of antiquity exist within the valley, and even these can only be included in the borders of Haz\u00e1ra by the courtesy of artificial boundary lines. The history of the mountain glen itself begins at a far later period. The name of Haz\u00e1ra is said to be derived from one K\u00e1rlagh Haz\u00e1ra, of a T\u00farki family, who entered India with Tim\u00far in the 14th century, and subsequently settled in this remote region. A more probable, and indeed the usually accepted derivation, is from the military colonies of a thousand (has\u00e1r) troops each, which Chengis Kh\u00e1n left behind him here and at various points along the K\u00falni valley. If the former derivation be accepted, it may be concluded that the Haz\u00e1ras of this District are a branch of those Haz\u00e1ra T\u00farks who have given their name to a certain tract in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n.\n\nDuring the prosperous period of the Mughal dynasty, the open southern plain formed part of the Attock government; the eastern slopes were ruled by a branch of the Ghakkar family of R\u00e1wal Pindi, with Kh\u00e1npur for their capital; while the northern gorge belonged to the Kashm\u00edr Province, but was probably administered by the Haz\u00e1ra T\u00farks. Then, as now, the population included a number of mixed tribes, with a large substratum of G\u00fajars, Khar\u00e1ls, and Dh\u00fands, all of whom can apparently claim a pure Hindu origin, as well as the Ghakkars, though they accepted the faith of Isl\u00e1m at a very early date. Towards the beginning of the 18th century, a horde of Afgh\u00e1n invaders from Sw\u00e1t poured into the vale of Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n, and occupied the whole northern tract. About the same period, other associated tribes, not of pure Afgh\u00e1n descent, swarmed into the District across the eastern frontier; while the G\u00fajars, Khar\u00e1ls, and Dh\u00fands began simultaneously to assert their independence, so that the utmost anarchy prevailed throughout Haz\u00e1ra.\n\nIn 1752, Kashm\u00edr and the Punjab passed into the hands of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, whose firmer administration seems for a time to have restored some semblance of order among the anarchic elements of this savage country. But the Dur\u00e1ni Empire did not long retain sufficient vitality to support a stable government in so remote a dependency. Fierce dissensions between the local chieftains fill up the annals of the valley during the latter half of the 18th century, until the time when Haz\u00e1ra attracted the attention of the rising Sikh monarchy. Ranjit Singh first obtained a footing in the District in 1818, and, after eight years of constant aggression, became master of the whole country. Sard\u00e1r Hari Singh was the chief instrument of the Sikh Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1; but even that energetic leader found his abilities taxed to the utmost by the dogged resistance of the mountaineers. From 1826 to 1846, the Sikh Government at Lahore exercised undoubted supremacy throughout Haz\u00e1ra, and one by one the native chieftains lost even the small measure of independence which they had originally been suffered to\nHAZARA.\n\nretain. Revolts of almost yearly occurrence, however, kept the country in a state of turmoil; and when the vigour of the Sikh kingdom began to relax under the successors of Ranjit Singh, the people of Haz\u00e1ra seized the opportunity of recovering their independence, and in 1845 they rose as one man. They stormed the Sikh forts, laid siege to Haripur, the seat of administration, and drove the Governor, Diw\u00e1n Mulr\u00e1j, across the borders. A Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed fanatic, Sayyid Akbar of Sit\u00e1na, was elected king by the assembled chieftains, and Haz\u00e1ra looked forward once more to a native Musalm\u00e1n r\u00e9gime. But in the following year the greater part of the District was included in the territory ceded to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ghul\u00e1b Singh by the British, at the conclusion of the first Sikh war. A force despatched by Ghul\u00e1b Singh, under the control of two British Political Officers, forced an entry into Haz\u00e1ra from Srinagar, and quelled the insurrection without serious difficulty.\n\nIn the year 1847, the new ruler of Kashmir induced the Government of Lahore to accept the District of Haz\u00e1ra in exchange for a strip of territory on the southern frontier of Jummoo (Jammu). Lieutenant Abbott, as Political Officer under the Lahore Government, at once effected a settlement of the land-tax. The turbulent chieftains had at length found their match in the steady but liberal organization of British officials; and so effectual were the measures adopted by Lieutenant Abbott, that in 1848 the District could already be described, for the first time perhaps since the Mughal period, as 'perfectly tranquil.'\n\nOn the outbreak of the disturbances at Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan), which culminated in the second Sikh war, the troops in garrison rose against Lieutenant Abbott, in unison with their co-religionists in the Punjab; but the Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants universally threw in their lot with their new rulers, and remained faithful, almost without exception, throughout the struggle. Rough guerilla bands assembled readily to defend the leader whose liberality and consideration they had experienced against the power of their Sikh oppressors. Offering a bold front both to the revolted Sikhs and to their ally, the Am\u00edr of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, whose threatened march from Attock into Kashmir placed him in great jeopardy, the English officer succeeded in holding his own at the head of his raw Muhammadan levies, until the battle of Gujr\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) decided the fate of the campaign. The Afgh\u00e1ns then withdrew, and Haz\u00e1ra passed peaceably under direct British rule. A few unimportant risings upon the frontier have since diversified the local annals, but the District as a whole has enjoyed uninterrupted peace for nearly half a century. In 1857, some disaffected Dh\u00fands made an attempt to seize upon the hill station of Murree (Marri) in R\u00e1wal Pindi, and in 1868 disturbances took place in Agror and the neighbouring border, which resulted in the petty campaign known as the 'Black\nMountain Expedition; but on neither occasion was the general tranquillity disturbed. On the first distribution of the Province, the Murree tract was included in the limits of Haz\u00e1ra, but subsequent arrangements in 1850 transferred it to R\u00e1wal Pindi. In 1854, the head-quarters of the District, which had hitherto been placed at Haripur, a town founded by the Sikh Sard\u00e1r, Hari Singh, were removed to a new station laid out by Lieutenant Abbott, and called after him, Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The first Census of Haz\u00e1ra took place on 1st January 1855, and returned the total number of inhabitants at 296,364. A second enumeration, on 10th January 1868, gave a total of 343,929, showing an increase for the thirteen years of 47,565 persons, or 16.04 per cent. These figures do not include the feudal territory of Tan\u00e1wal, which, however, formed part of the District for the Census of 1868. That enumeration extended over a total area of 2835 square miles, and disclosed a total population of 367,218, distributed among 1253 villages or townships, and inhabiting 74,174 houses. The Census taken on the 17th February 1881 returned the area as 3039 square miles (including Tan\u00e1wal), and the population as 407,075 persons. This population dwelt in 4 towns and 1179 villages, and inhabited 67,412 houses; 9518 houses were returned as unoccupied. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 134; villages per square mile, 0.39; houses per square mile, 25; persons per village, 344; persons per house, 6. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 218,616; females, 188,459; proportion of males, 53.7 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males, 94,449; females, 80,092; total, 174,541, or 42.8 per cent. of the whole population. A comparison with the returns of the Census of 1868 shows that in the thirteen years ending 1881 the population of the District, as at present constituted, has increased by 41,755, or at the rate of 11.4 per cent.\n\nAs regards religious distinctions, Haz\u00e1ra is an essentially Musalm\u00e1n District. The Muhammadans number in all 385,759, or 94.7 per cent.; while the Hindus amount to only 19,843, or 4.8 per cent. The small margin includes 1381 Sikhs and 90 Christians. The main divisions of the population (excluding that of Tan\u00e1wal), according to tribe and caste, are as follows:\u2014Among the Muhammadans, the G\u00fajars (60,948), the Tanaolis (39,981), the Dh\u00fands (20,085), Kashmir\u00eds (13,997), Sayyids (15,235), R\u00e1jputs (4634), Shaikhs (5098), Loh\u00e1rs (5896), Mughals (5297), T\u00fcrks (2996), Jul\u00e1h\u00e1s (11,885), Ghakkars (4613), and Mochis (4285). Among Hindus, Khattris number 10,045; Br\u00e1hmans, 4003; Aror\u00e1s, 2406; and Sunars, 810. The Sw\u00e1tis occupy the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n gorge; while the other tribes of Afgh\u00e1n origin inhabit the western frontier of the District. The Dh\u00fands and Khar\u00e1ls hold the south-eastern hills, and Aw\u00e1ns and G\u00fajars are scattered over the whole country, occupying inferior social\npositions. The Aw\u00e1ns universally follow agriculture, but the G\u00fajars devote themselves to cattle-grazing among the hills, especially in the higher slopes of K\u00e1g\u00e1n. Sayyids are found in all parts of the District, and enjoy a high social position. The Khattris and Br\u00e1hmans form a very small proportion of the population, and engage almost entirely in trade.\n\nThe physique of the Haz\u00e1ra tribes falls decidedly below that common in the adjoining Districts of R\u00e1wal Pindi and Pesh\u00e1war, or among the mountaineers beyond the frontier. The Dh\u00fand\u00eds, Khar\u00e1l\u00eds, and Sw\u00e1t\u00eds in particular are of small stature and deficient in strength. Under British rule they have proved themselves submissive subjects; but their turbulence under the oppressive Sikh Government shows that they can resist by force when necessary. Among their chiefs, open violence is rare, fraud and intrigue being the more usual weapons both of attack and of defence. As cultivators, they are remarkable rather for patient industry than for skill or enterprise. The external ritual of Isl\u00e1m is regularly observed even amongst the lowest agriculturists, but its legal precepts yield entirely to local custom.\n\nAs regards occupation, the adult male population is divided into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description, and the learned professions, 6636; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 3435; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 2828; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 77,243; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 20,158; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 13,867. Of the 1183 towns and villages in the District, 638 contained in 1881 a population of less than two hundred; 327 from two to five hundred; 145 from five hundred to one thousand; 52 from one to two thousand; 9 from two to three thousand; 9 from three to five thousand; and 3 from five to ten thousand. In 1882\u201383, the District contained 4 municipal towns, with populations as follows:\u2014HARIPUR, 4884; ABBOTTABAD, 4189; BAFA, 5410; NAWASHAHR, 4307. The aggregate population within municipal limits was, in 1882\u201383, 15,932.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Although no accurate statistics exist with reference to the area under cultivation during the early years of British rule, there is reason to believe that the extent of tillage has increased by 30 per cent. since the date of annexation. In 1869\u201370, the settlement returns showed the cultivated area as 393,918 acres, or 22\u00b721 per cent. of the whole District. In 1875\u201376, the cultivable waste amounted to only 35,399 acres; in 1881, it was reduced to 15,101 acres, so that agriculture has now almost reached its utmost margin. The principal crops consist of wheat, barley, and oil-seeds for the rabi or spring\nharvest, while maize, rice, pulses, millets, cotton, and potatoes form the chief kharif or autumn crops. Turmeric and sugar-cane are grown in the Haripur taluk. Only one crop, that in autumn, is harvested in the higher ranges. The area under each staple in 1881 was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 97,698 acres; barley, 69,375 acres; mustard, 8417 acres; maize, 207,779 acres; rice, 22,299 acres; pulses, 22,931 acres; millets, 46,099 acres. The cultivation of the potato, introduced shortly after the British annexation, has greatly progressed in the face of natural difficulties, and there is now no prejudice against its cultivation.\n\nThroughout the hill tracts the autumn harvest is the more important, and among the higher hills the length and severity of the winter preclude the possibility of a spring crop. Rice can only be grown on irrigated land lying low in the mountain valleys. Maize or Indian corn forms the great upland staple, being sown in May and gathered in October; while the lowland seasons fall about a month later in either case. The soil in the open portion of the District is deep and rich, the detritus of the surrounding hills being lodged in the basin-like depressions below; the highlands have a shallow and stony covering, compensated for by the abundant manure which can be obtained from the flocks of sheep and cattle among the mountain pastures. The B\u0101gh or garden soil is always in the vicinity of the village, and is cultivated by the Mallis, a superior caste of husbandmen. Rent for this land varies from \u00a31, 12s. to \u00a32, 8s. per acre. Irrigation by wells is confined to the open country round Haripur. In other parts, embankments on the rivers and hill torrents distribute the water to the neighbouring fields. The area artificially irrigated in 1881 amounted to 36,380 acres by private enterprise; and during the year crops were taken from 51,925 artificially-irrigated acres in two harvests.\n\nThe average holding of an agriculturist in the plains varies from 10 to 7 acres, according to the quality of the soil; in the hilly portion it is 6 acres, with a few acres of meadow land adjoining. Village communities of the usual Punjab types occupy the soil, in most cases, with varying individual or communal tenures. Out of 886 villages in 1881, 99 still retained all their lands in common; among the remainder, division of plots to separate owners had proceeded to a greater or less extent. Half the cultivated area is held by tenants, a little more than one-half of whom enjoy rights of occupancy. Rents are usually paid in kind, but certain occupancy tenants pay a fixed percentage of the land-tax in cash. Agricultural labour is also paid in kind. In 1881, cash wages ranged from 6d. to 9d. per diem for unskilled workmen, and from 1s. to 2s. per diem for skilled workmen. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on the 1st of January 1881:\u2014Wheat,\nHAZARA.\n\n11 sers per rupee; maize, 15 sers per rupee; barley, 17 sers per rupee; rice, 4 sers per rupee.\n\nNeither the towns nor villages of Haz\u00e1ra are walled. Both towns and villages are mere collections of flat-roofed mud-built houses, threaded by narrow, irregular gullies. Every village has its place of public resort, generally near the house and under the care of the head-man of the village. In these baithaks or deori, questions of local interest are discussed, the passing traveller entertained, and the gossip of the moment disseminated. Each village has its mosque or masjid, with an Im\u00e1m or priestly servant in charge. The Im\u00e1m calls to prayer, and leads the recital; reads the Kur\u00e1n, teaches the children of the hamlet, and takes the principal part in the domestic ceremonies of the people. The Im\u00e1m is usually supported by the grant of a piece of land rent free. The style of living among the inhabitants has visibly improved since annexation: the houses are more commodious, the roofs better timbered, copper vessels and English earthenware are to be seen, and the cattle are better housed. Spirit-drinking is not practised, but opium-eating and opium-smoking are common habits. Much value is attached to women. The loss of a wife is the greatest possible misfortune. The women of the people assist equally with the men in all the operations of husbandry. Family life is regulated by custom rather than law. Polygamy is permitted, but the custom is not general.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Haz\u00e1ra suffered great scarcity in the memorable and widespread famine of 1783, which affected it with the same severity as the remainder of Upper India. During the years of dearth among the plain Districts in 1861 and 1869\u201370, the harvests of Haz\u00e1ra produced an excellent yield, and the high price of grain for exportation gave large profits to the peasantry, besides affording an incentive to increased cultivation. In 1877\u201378, however, Haz\u00e1ra again experienced scarcity; but in 1879\u201380 the yield was abundant, and high prices ruled during the continuance of the Afghan war.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The chief imports of the District, with their annual values as estimated by the settlement officer, comprise\u2014English cloth, \u00a333,000; salt, \u00a312,000; and indigo, \u00a35000: while the exports include gh\u00ed, \u00a320,000; mustard oil, \u00a320,000; barley, \u00a312,000; wheat, \u00a36000; rice, \u00a35000; and live stock, \u00a35000. Khatak Path\u00e1ns from R\u00e1wal Pindi and Pesh\u00e1war manage the whole carrying trade, entering the District annually with their hill bullocks, making their purchases either direct from the agriculturists or from Khattri traders, and purchasing grain chiefly from Pakhli. No manufactures of more than local importance exist. Haripur, Bafa, Sar\u00e1i Saleh, Kot Najsb-ull\u00e1, Naw\u00e1shahr, B\u00e1l\u00e1kot, and M\u00e1nsahra are the principal centres of local traffic. The chief road in the District is that\nfrom Hasan Abd\u00e1l in R\u00e1wal Pindi to Sr\u00ednagar in Kashmir, via Haripur, Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, and M\u00e1nsahra, crossing the Kunh\u00e1r by an iron suspension bridge, and the Jehlam (Jhelum) by a ford. Another line connects Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d with the hill station of Murree (Marri). Both routes run through mountainous country, but are kept in excellent repair, and are passable for camels or horses, except when covered with snow. There is a third road from Hazro to Haripur and Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, chiefly used by Path\u00e1n traders from Pesh\u00e1war. A tonga and bullock-train service connects the railway station of Hasan Abd\u00e1l on the Punjab Northern State Railway with Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1875\u201376 there were 676 miles of unmetalled road within the District. The Kunh\u00e1r is crossed by several wooden bridges, and in the higher part of Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n, by rope suspension bridges.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Feudal Tan\u00e1wal, although geographically within the area of Haz\u00e1ra, is not under the District administration. Tan\u00e1wal is in fact the Cis-Indus territory of the independent Naw\u00e1b of Amb, and is a political dependency administered by him. The total revenue derived from Haz\u00e1ra proper in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a328,729, of which sum the land-tax contributed \u00a322,193. A local revenue of about \u00a32000 provides for objects of public utility within the District. In 1882\u201383, eight civil and revenue judges of all grades exercised magisterial powers. The administrative staff usually includes two covenanted civilians. The regular police force, together with the municipal constabulary, numbered 505 men in 1882\u201383; being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 5'6 square miles of area and every 806 of the population. This force was in 1881 further supplemented by a body of 423 village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1s). The District jail in 1882\u201383 had a daily average of 44 convicts, of whom 4 were females. A small lock-up at Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, with a temporary wooden jail barrack, affords accommodation for 66 prisoners, but all convicts sentenced to more than one month's confinement are sent to the jail at R\u00e1wal Pindi. Education has of late improved. In 1882\u201383, the District had a total of 22 State-inspected schools, with a roll of 937 pupils. In addition, the educational report for the same year returned a total of 1023 indigenous or village schools, in which 11,546 children were under some form of instruction. An educational cess has been imposed only since 1882. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is subdivided into 3 tahsils and 38 ild\u00e1kas. The aggregate revenue of the four municipal towns in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a31821, being at the rate of 2s. 3d. per head of the population (15,932) within municipal limits. All the municipalities are of the third class.\n\nMilitary Arrangements.\u2014The station of Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d is the headquarters of the Punjab Frontier Force. The garrison usually comprises\nHAZARIBAGH.\n\ntwo regiments of Native infantry, and a battery of mountain artillery. An outpost exists in the Agror valley, for which garrisons are detached from Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Fort Harkishengarh at Haripur is garrisoned by a police force of 1 sergeant and 8 men. During the summer months, detachments of British infantry and sometimes of mountain artillery are stationed at selected posts, called gully locations, along the road from Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d to Murree (Marri). The cost of the entire Frontier Force in 1883 was \u00a3414,663.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Haz\u00e1ra is as varied as the scenery. The southern portion, adjoining the plains, suffers from the heat of summer and the cold of winter as greatly as R\u00e1wal Pindi; but at Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, although the winter is severe, the refreshing mountain breezes mitigate the summer temperature to a considerable extent. Snow lies upon the hills down to a level of 6000 feet from November to March. The perpetual snow-line extends between 14,000 and 15,000 feet. At Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d the mean temperature in 1882 was 84\u00b0 F. in May and 54\u00b0 in December. In May the same year, the maximum was 112\u00b0, and the minimum in December 33\u00b0. The annual rainfall varies from 30 inches in the lower valleys to 50 inches or more among the high mountains; the average for the whole District during the twelve years ending 1881 amounted to 43'4 inches. In 1882, the rainfall was 46'8 inches. Malarious fevers prevail in the spring and autumn, and affections of the respiratory organs in the winter. Stone and goitre are also of common occurrence, the latter disease appearing in the closed mountain glen of Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n, and other valleys. No accurate mortuary returns are available for the District generally. 9710 deaths from all causes were registered during 1882. Of these the great majority were attributed to fever; 3923 succumbed to small-pox. The recorded death-rate of Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d in the same year was 24 per 1000, and the registered birth-rate 28 per 1000. Two charitable dispensaries at Haripur and Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d gave relief in 1882-83 to 30,290 persons, of whom 402 were in-patients. [For further information regarding Haz\u00e1ra, see the Report on the Land Settlement Operations from 1868 to 1874, by Captain E. G. Wace; the District Gazetteer, published by authority of the Punjab Government; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nHaz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh.\u2014District of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 25' and 24\u00b0 48' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 29' and 86\u00b0 38' E. long. Bounded on the north by the Districts of Gay\u00e1 and Monghyr; on the east by the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s and M\u00e1n-bh\u00fam; on the south by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1; and on the west by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1. The District forms the north-eastern portion of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division. Area, 7021 square miles. Population, according\nHAZARIBAGH.\n\nto the Census of 1881, 1,104,742. The administrative head-quarters are at HAZARIBAGH town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The physical formation of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh exhibits three distinct features:\u2014(1) A high central plateau extends from the western boundary of the District, occupying a central position in the western section of it; this plateau measures about 40 miles in length from east to west and 15 miles from north to south, and the height of the head-quarters station, Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh (2000 feet), may be taken as its average elevation; the surface is undulating and cultivated, and many prosperous villages are dotted over this tract: (2) A lower and more extensive plateau, with a general elevation of 1300 feet, occupies the northern and eastern portions of the District; to the north, the land is well cultivated, and hardly a trace exists of rock or jungle; to the east, the country has a much more varied character, the elevation becomes lower, and the character of a plateau is gradually lost: (3) The central valley of the D\u00e1modar river, with the country which is watered by its numerous feeders, occupies the entire southern section of the District; the chief characteristics of this tract are extensive jungle and scattered villages, but exceptions to this general description are found in the well-cultivated Karanpur\u00e1 valley, and in the rich rice-fields of parg\u00e1ns Pal\u00e1n\u00ed, Changarh\u00e1, and G\u00f3l\u00e1. Indeed, although the characteristic features of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh are rock and hill and wide-spreading jungle, fine patches of cultivation are met with in all parts, and the scenery is generally pleasing and often extremely picturesque. The central tracts, notably the northern portion of the lower plateau, exhibit a continuous expanse of undulating country, rich in soil and devoid of hills, where much valuable rice land has been obtained after laborious construction, and where the cultivated uplands, generally studded with mah\u00fad trees, or groves of mango, have given many parts of the District the 'park-like appearance' which has been so frequently remarked.\n\nThe District forms part of the chain of high land\u2014sometimes a range of hills, sometimes a cultivated plateau\u2014which extends across the continent of India, south of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river on the west, and south of the Son (Soane) river on the east. This chain has nearly reached its eastern extremity in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District; the rivers here take an easterly course, and the general level of the country begins to fall. The high central plateau has a well-defined face on all sides except towards the west. In this direction it becomes narrow, and gradually descends till the final slope can hardly be traced among the other undulations of the country. Near the western limit, the connection of the plateau with the great central range referred to above is readily traced. The principal peaks of the plateau are Bar\u00e1g\u00e1i or Marang Buru (3445 feet above the sea), Jiling\u00e1 (3057 feet), Chendw\u00e1r (2816 feet), and Aswa (2463 feet). Detached hills are Lugu (3203 feet),\nM\u00e1hudi (2437 feet); and, in the east of the District, on the boundary of M\u00e1nbh\u00fam, the well-known Parasnath Hill, 4479 feet above the sea, which was for a few years (1864\u201368) used as a military sanitarium. The building on the top of the hill, formerly the officers\u2019 quarters, is now used as a d\u00e1k bungalow for travellers.\n\nThe most important river of Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh is the D\u00e1modar. The District may be said to contain a section of the valley of this river about 90 miles in length. When the D\u00e1modar enters Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh on the south-west, it has already run 25 miles of its course through Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1. For a short distance it forms the boundary between the two Districts, and then flows in a generally eastern direction, until it enters M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. Its chief feeders in this portion of its course are the Garhi, Haharo, Naik\u00e1ri, Maramarh\u00e1, Bher\u00e1, Kunar, Khanjo, and Jamuni\u00e1. The D\u00e1modar, with its tributaries, drains in this District an area of 2480 square miles; it is everywhere fordable during the dry season. The only other important river of Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh is the Barakhar, which drains an area of 2050 square miles. Although the face of the country is to a large extent covered with jungle, there are no forests containing timber of appreciable commercial value. S\u00e1l (Shorea robusta) grows abundantly, but is not allowed to attain any height, the young trees being used for house-posts, rafters, masts, etc. The use of the saw is unknown, and it would therefore be useless to allow the trees to grow beyond a size at which the wood can be cut and fashioned by the axe. The forests of the District yield little revenue to Government, but they afford means of subsistence to a considerable number of the poorer classes of the people during a portion of the year. Amongst the fruits and roots thus eaten are the mah\u00fad, ber, bar, pip\u00e1l, singar\u00e1, chekur, roots of various species of Dioscorea, and many kinds of leaves. A \u2018reserved forest\u2019 has been established in the Kodarma Government estate since 1879, covering an area of 36 square miles. The uncultivated high lands in the south and south-west of the District contain fine stretches of grazing ground for cattle, and during the cold weather large herds are driven in for pasture from the neighbouring District of Gay\u00e1, where grazing land is scarce. There are no fewer than five groups of mineral springs in Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh District, all of which are looked upon as sacred by the Hindus, and are largely resorted to for the cure of skin diseases. The jungle in the less cultivated portions of the District give shelter to tigers, bears, and leopards; and the sond\u00e1 chit\u00e1 or dog-leopard, distinguished by having non-retractile claws, is occasionally seen. Wolves are very common, and wild dogs hunt in packs on P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th Hill. Several varieties of deer are found in the jungles, and bison are sometimes met with. Amongst the game-birds, which are very plentiful, are jungle-fowl, pea-fowl, partridge, duck, teal and quail, snipe, ortolans, plovers, etc.\nHAZARIBAGH.\n\nHistory.\u2014Local history begins in the middle of the 18th century, when one Mukund Singh was R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the old estate of R\u00e1mgarh (which included the present District of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh) and the recognised chief of the country, while his relative, Tej Singh, was at the head of the local army. They claimed descent from two R\u00e1jput brothers, immigrants from Bundelkhand. The former obtained the samind\u00e1ri of R\u00e1mgarh from the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; but, in 1771, Tej Singh went to assert his claim to the estate before Captain Camac at Patn\u00e1. He returned with a European force under Lieutenant Goddard; Mukund Singh fled after a mere show of resistance, and the R\u00e1mgarh estate was made over to Tej Singh subject to a tribute of \u00a34000 a year. It does not appear, however, that Lieutenant Goddard took formal possession of the territory thus won, nor did his expedition extend to the north-western portion of the District known as pargan\u00e1 Kharakdiha. Six years earlier (1765), Mod N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Deo, the old Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kharakdiha, chief of the gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls or guardians of the passes, being driven from his estate by the Musalm\u00e1n \u00e1mil or revenue agent, K\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, had taken refuge with Tej Singh at R\u00e1mgarh, and received a grant of two villages by way of maintenance. K\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n\u2019s rule in Kharakdiha was followed by that of Ikb\u00e1l \u00c1li Kh\u00e1n, who was expelled in 1774 for tyranny and mismanagement, by a British force under Captain James Brown. The exiled R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kharakdiha, who had exerted his influence on the British side, was rewarded with a grant of the maintenance lands of the r\u00e1j. Possibly he might have been completely reinstated in his former position, but in the confusion of Muhammadan misrule, the gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls had grown too strong to return to their old allegiance, and demanded and obtained separate settlements. In the sanads granted to them by Captain Brown, they are recognised as petty feudal chiefs, holding their lands subject to responsibility for crime committed on their estates. They were bound to produce criminals, and to refund stolen property; they were liable to removal for misconduct; and they undertook to maintain a body of police, and to keep the roads in repair. Before 1780, the pacification of the gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls was complete, and Captain Brown\u2019s military administration had come to an end. R\u00e1mgarh and Kharakdiha then formed part of a British District named R\u00e1mgarh, administered by a civilian, who held the offices of Judge, Magistrate, and Collector; while a contingent of Native infantry, known as the R\u00e1mgarh Battalion, was stationed at Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh under the command of a European officer. This District of R\u00e1mgarh occupied an area nearly three times as great as that of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh at present, stretching up on the north-west to Shergh\u00e1ti in Gay\u00e1, and taking in on the east pargan\u00e1 Chak\u00e1i of Monghyr, and the samind\u00e1ri r\u00e1j of P\u00e1nchet; while on the south-west and south-\nPal\u00e1mau was regularly included in the District, and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur owed a loose allegiance as a tributary estate administered by its own chief.\n\nFrom 1780 to 1833, the District was governed in general accord with the ordinary Regulations; but in the latter year, in consequence of the great Kol insurrection of 1831-32 (for an account of which see LOHARDAGA District), the administrative system was entirely changed. R\u00e1mgarh and the Jungle Mah\u00e1ls with the estate of Dhal-bh\u00fam, till then included in Midnapur, were exempted from the operation of the Regulations, and every branch of government within these tracts was vested in an officer appointed by the Supreme Government, styled the Agent to the Governor-General. The parg\u00e1ns of Kharakdiha, Kendi, and Kund\u00e1, with the large estate of R\u00e1mgarh consisting of 16 parg\u00e1ns, which compose the present area of the District, became part of the South-Western Frontier Agency, and were formed into a District under the name of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh. In 1854, the designation of the Province was changed from South-Western Frontier Agency to Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; and it has been administered since that date as a Non-Regulation Province under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, the title of the chief executive officer being at the same time changed from Governor-General's Agent to Commissioner. The revenue, civil, and magisterial jurisdictions of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh are now conterminous.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Several early attempts were made to ascertain the population of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh. In 1837 it was estimated at 320,000, but it is not known on what data this calculation was based. The Survey Department, in 1858-63, returned the population at 716,065, showing an average density of 101 persons to the square mile; and a later estimate gave an average density of 106 to the square mile. The first regular Census was taken in 1872. It disclosed a total population of 771,875 persons, inhabiting 6703 villages or townships and 150,493 houses. In 1881 the population was returned at 1,104,742, or an increase of 332,867, or 43\u00b712 per cent., over the results of 1872. Most of this large increase, however, is more apparent than real, being due to defective enumeration in 1872. That enumeration is admitted to have been only approximate, and to have partaken rather of the character of a survey of the population than a regular census. The general results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 7021 square miles; number of towns and villages, 7833; houses, 193,481, of which 185,280 are occupied and 8201 unoccupied. Total population, 1,104,742, namely, males 544,903, and females 559,839; average density of population, 157\u00b73 per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 1\u00b72; persons per village, 141; houses per square mile, 27\u00b76; persons per house, 6.\n\nThe ethnical division of the people is returned as follows:\u2014Non-\nAsiatics (almost entirely British), 161; mixed races, 45; Asiatics (all natives of India), 1,104,436. Belonging to non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, there are 73,282; Hindus and semi-Hinduized aboriginal tribes, 852,103; persons of Hindu origin not recognising caste, 4022; unspecified Hindus, 2860; Muhammadans, 106,097; and Christians, 552. Among the non-Hindu aboriginal tribes of the District, the most numerous are\u2014the Sant\u00e1ls, of whom there are 56,598; the Kols, 8815; the remaining 7869 being returned as \u2018others.\u2019 Pargan\u00e1s Ch\u00e1i and Ch\u00e1mpa of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh are supposed to have been one of the earliest settlements of the Sant\u00e1ls, although their true home is now the adjoining District of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. An account of the wanderings of this tribe and of the customs and habits of its members will be found in the article on the Santal Parganas, as also in Colonel Dalton\u2019s Ethnology of Bengal, and in the Annals of Rural Bengal. In Colonel Dalton\u2019s work will also be found a very interesting account of the Kols or Mund\u00e1s; a brief description will also be given of this tribe in its alphabetical sequence. The curious aboriginal tribe of B\u00edrhors, found in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh and Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, is deserving of notice. They live in the jungles of the hill-sides in water-tight huts made of branches and leaves. They have hardly any cultivation, and never touch a plough. The men spend their time in snaring hares and monkeys, and also trade in various jungle products. They worship female deities and devils, and it is supposed that they at one time practised cannibalism.\n\nAmong semi-Hinduized aborigines, the most numerous castes are\u2014Bhuiy\u00e1s, 92,849, and Kharw\u00e1rs, 36,893, who occupy the humblest positions; Cham\u00e1rs, preparers of hides and workers in leather, numbering 42,574; Dos\u00e1dhs, 24,827; Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls, 38,441; and Bhogt\u00e1s, labourers and exorcisers of demons, but not returned separately in the Census Report. Mention has already been made in the historical section of this article of the Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls of R\u00e1mgarh. They were originally guardians of the hill passes, and are Bhuiy\u00e1s by descent; but the official title has now become a caste appellation. The wealthier Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls are considerable landholders in the north-east of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, and claim to be samind\u00e1rs under the Permanent Settlement of 1793. Of agricultural and pastoral castes, the most numerous are the Kurmis (62,761); the Koer\u00eds (42,602); and the Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, cowherds and milkmen (129,445), the most numerous caste in the District; of trading castes, the Baniy\u00e1s (27,277); of artisan castes, the Tel\u00eds or oilmen (42,319); and of castes employed chiefly in domestic service, the Napits or barbers (23,671); and Kah\u00e1rs, field labourers, domestic servants, etc. (33,419). The higher Hindu castes are\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, numbering 28,422; R\u00e1jputs and Band\u00e1wats (37,404); Babh\u00e1ns (29,540); and K\u00e1yasths (9232). The most respected clans of R\u00e1jputs are the Panw\u00e1r or Ujjain\u00ed, from whom were drawn the Bhojpuria\nSepoys of our Native army; and the N\u00e1gb\u00e1ns\u00ed, who are peculiar to Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and are acknowledged as R\u00e1jputs of pure blood. The Band\u00e1wats are a cultivating caste, who wear the sacred thread, and claim to be R\u00e1jputs.\n\nThe Hindus, as grouped together on the basis of religion, number 924,811, or 83.7 per cent. of the total population. Of Muhammadans there are 106,097, or 9.6 per cent., namely, Sunnis, 97,029; Shi\u00e1s, 641; and \u2018unspecified,\u2019 8427; and of Christians, 552, of whom 161 were Europeans or Australians, 45 Eurasians, and 327 natives. There is also a considerable Jain population in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, estimated at 5000 in number. They are not, however, returned separately in the Census Report, and are apparently included in the general Hindu population. The Jains may be divided into two classes\u2014the secular and the religious. The secular Jains, known as Sr\u00e1waks, are confined to the towns of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh and Chatr\u00e1. Most of them are well-to-do merchants, and occupy a high social position. The religious Jains live at the foot of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th Hill, and have charge of the temples in the village of Madhuban, where pilgrims halt before ascending the holy hill. Both classes are well-to-do in the world.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The population of the District is almost entirely rural, there being only three towns containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely, Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh (population in 1881), 15,306; Chatr\u00e1, 11,900; and Ichak, 7346. Of the 7833 towns and villages in 1881, no less than 6319 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 1201 from two to five hundred; 263 from five hundred to a thousand; 43 from one to two thousand; 3 from two to three thousand; 1 from three to five thousand; and 3 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. The only place of special interest in the District is Parasn\u00e1th Hill, a celebrated place of pilgrimage, which is annually visited by large numbers of Jain worshippers. Minor places of pilgrimage are Kulha Hill and Kh\u00e1prawa village.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014The demand for labour in connection with the construction of the railways, together with the extensive operations of the Public Works Department, has caused a considerable rise in the price of wages and produce of late years, which has considerably ameliorated the condition of the people. In former years, a labourer or petty agriculturist could barely manage to supply himself with the bare necessaries of life in an ordinary year, while in bad seasons or on other occasions of distress, his misery was very great. Now, however, after defraying all his expenses, he can manage to save something out of his earnings or the produce of his fields, which he carefully hoards up for occasions of sickness and seasons of scarcity; or, as is oftener the case, to spend on wedding ceremonies and other festive occasions.\nHAZARIBAGH.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male population into the following six main classes:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including all Government servants and the learned professions, 5280; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 14,703; (3) commercial, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 10,353; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, 178,991; (5) manufacturing and artisan, 32,709; (6) indefinite and non-productive, comprising general labourers and male children, 302,867.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is the staple crop of the District, and three principal kinds are grown\u2014bord or gorda, lahuhan, and jarhan. Bord or early rice is sown broadcast after the first fall of rain in June, and reaped about the end of August; it is confined to the southern portion of the District. Lahuhan or autumn rice is sown in June, and reaped in September; it is either transplanted or sown broadcast. The winter rice crop (jarhan) is also sown in June, transplanted in July or August, and reaped in October and November. From this last crop are derived the finer varieties of rice, the coarser kinds, such as are used by the poor, being usually grown in the lahuhan crop. These crops are subdivided into 47 principal varieties. Rice is grown in the swampy ground between the long undulating ridges of which the surface of the District is composed, and on the lower slopes of these ridges. The soil is, in the first instance, brought under cultivation by cutting level terraces out of the hill-side, a small bank to hold water being left round the edge of each plot. The hill-sides thus present the appearance of a series of steps, varying from 1 to 5 feet in height. When the slopes are too steep for terracing, or the soil too strong for cultivation, the bed of the stream is banked up and made into one long narrow rice-field. The rice-fields thus constructed are divided into four classes, according to the height of the land and its capacity for remaining moist until the planting-out season. The rich alluvial land, which lies lowest in the depressions between the ridges, is called gaird; the rent for this varies from 6s. 8d. to 8s. an acre, and the average yield is 15 cwt. per acre. Singd land lies higher up the slope; rent, 5s. 4d. per acre; average produce, 12 cwt. an acre. Bad is situated above singd, and is the highest land on which rice can be grown at a profit without artificial irrigation; the rent varies from 2s. 8d. to 3s. 4d. per acre, and the produce is estimated at nearly 7 cwt. per acre. Gaurhd is rather high rice land, which would, from its position, be classed as singd, but which catches the fertilizing drainage of a village, and is therefore assessed as gaird; rent and average produce, the same as in the case of gaird. A second crop is not grown on rice lands. Among the other crops of Hazaribagh District are wheat of several kinds, barley, Indian corn, the usual pulses and green crops of Bengal, a little jute, flax, aloe, sugar-cane, opium, cotton, pan, etc. Out of an area (as ascer-\ntained by the Topographical Survey in 1870-73) of 7020 square miles, 2585 square miles are returned as under cultivation, and 4435 square miles as uncultivated.\n\nWages and prices have risen considerably since 1855, the earliest year for which any record of prices exists. In that year, the wages of an agricultural day labourer were a little more than 1\u00bdd. a day; now he earns rather more than 2\u00bdd. Bricklayers' wages have risen from 1\u00bdd. to 3\u00bdd. or 4\u00bdd. a day; and carpenters who were formerly paid 3d. now get 4\u00bdd., or even 6d. a day. Prices of food-grains and all kinds of agricultural produce have risen proportionately. In 1855, the price of common rice was 2s. 8d. per cwt.; of best rice, 4s. 9d.; and of wheat, 6s. 10d. per cwt. In 1882, the prices were\u2014for common rice, 5s. 9d.; and for wheat, 7s. 8d. per cwt. During the famine of 1866, prices rose to 13s. 8d. per cwt. for common rice, and 19s. 1d. per cwt. for best rice. In the rural parts of the District, the rise and fall of prices is indicated by variations in the size of the pail\u00e1 or measure holding about a ser weight of grain. Rice is sold at the uniform rate of 1 pice (\u00bed.) per pail\u00e1; but as the price rises, the size of the pail\u00e1 diminishes.\n\nKam\u00edds or serf-cultivators, who bind themselves to manual service in consideration of a lump sum of money, or until they discharge an existing personal debt, are numerous in Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh, and other Districts of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The kam\u00edd is fed and clothed by his master, and his children are married for him, the amount thus advanced being added to the sum of the debt. Nominally, he may regain his freedom by paying the amount due; but so far is this from being the case in practice, that the obligation of service is held to extend even to his children, who work on as kam\u00edds after their father's death. The kam\u00edd system seems to have arisen naturally from the peculiar economic conditions of the District. Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh is even now in that early stage of development, when the general proposition that land is limited in quantity has not had time to make itself felt. Land is still a drug; and the other requisites of production, labour, and capital, are proportionately far more important. The District Records of forty years ago show that the status of a kam\u00edd was at that date more rigidly defined than it is at the present day. The kam\u00edds, then as now mostly of the Bhuiy\u00e1 caste, executed a formal bond (saunkn\u00e1ma), the terms of which were of three degrees of stringency. Under the first and most severe, the kam\u00edd bound himself and his descendants to serve in perpetuity. His children were born slaves of the estate, and were married at the proprietor's expense. The second class contracted to serve for the term of their own lives; and the third, who were called s\u00e1nw\u00e1ks, only until the sum borrowed should be repaid. The two former classes were treated as part of the estate of their owner, and were transferred by sale\nor mortgage like other property. Maltreatment of a *kami\u00e1* by his master did not discharge the obligation; but such cases are said to have been rare. In the event of a *kami\u00e1* absconding, his owner was entitled to sue on the bond for possession of his person. Such proceedings were not uncommon, and it was thus that the British Courts were enabled to modify the original system. A claim for possession of a *kami\u00e1* was only admitted, if he had himself executed the *saunk-n\u00e1ma* on which action was brought, and had done so when of full age. All claims to minors or females were summarily disallowed; and maltreatment was held to void the obligation. Latterly, however, the practice of suing on a *saunk-n\u00e1ma* for possession of the person of a *kami\u00e1* has entirely disappeared. Bonds are still drawn up, but the condition that the obligee will work out his debt is frequently omitted altogether, and the document is only used to coerce the *kami\u00e1* with the threat of a legal process.\n\n*Kami\u00e1*s are employed in every description of agricultural labour, from levelling a terraced rice-field out of the hill-side to reaping and storing away the rice crop. They are invariably paid in kind, being given their food day by day at the ordinary meal times. The quantity of food given varies in different localities; but the general practice appears to be, that besides a *lukm\u00e9* or double handful of parched rice or *l\u00e1w\u00e1* in the morning, a male *kami\u00e1* receives during the day about one *ser* and a half of cooked food, or four *sers* of paddy or any grain that requires preparation. Women are paid in the same manner, but get a smaller amount of food. During the three months of Paush, M\u00e1gh, and Ph\u00e1lgun (15th December\u201415th March), *kami\u00e1*s receive no pay at all, as the work of cultivation is suspended. At the end of the season, however, when the crop is gathered in, a lump payment of grain is given them, the amount of which is settled by custom. A woman who marries a *kami\u00e1* does not *ipso facto* forfeit her freedom. She is called *kami\u00e1nt*, but this is merely a title; she is not expected to work for her husband's master, and if she does so is entitled to be paid. As a rule, she does ordinary household work for the master and is paid in kind. There is, however, one exception to this rule. If the *kami\u00e1*s master paid to the woman's father the customary marriage present on behalf of the *kami\u00e1*, the wife is held to be *kharidd* or purchased, and takes the same status as her husband. The employers of *kami\u00e1*s are perfectly aware how essential the bondmen are to their cultivation, and the relations between the parties are friendly. Notwithstanding this, it is continually becoming more common for *kami\u00e1*s to run away; and there can be no doubt that greater facilities for emigration, and the enhanced demand for labour on public works, railways, roads, and mines, together with the general though slow advance of education, will gradually break up the entire system of *kami\u00e1* labour.\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh is not subject to the usual calamities which affect most of the Districts of Bengal. Blight and flood are unknown, and a general failure of crops would be impossible unless the local rainfall were to fail entirely. The famine of 1866 did not very seriously affect the District, and the great body of cultivators, though a good deal pressed, were never in real danger of starvation. The prices of rice in 1866 have been given above. A two years' deficiency in the rice crop followed by rainless cold weather might be taken as a warning of distress; and if, further, the early June rain fell short, famine might be expected. In the event of such a calamity occurring, it is doubtful whether the means of communication would be sufficient to meet the emergencies of the case.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh is concentrated at Chatr\u00e1, the great central market at which the country produce of Loh\u00e1rd\u00e1g\u00e1 District and the Tributary States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur is exchanged for English cloth, salt, tobacco, household utensils, etc. Two smaller markets are held at Tandaw\u00e1 and M\u00edrz\u00e1ganj villages; and annual fairs are held at Chatr\u00e1 and Hutru, at which large numbers of cattle are sold. No accurate information exists as to the value of the exports and imports at the present day. An approximate return was made in 1863, according to which the exports were estimated at \u00a3215,735, and the imports at \u00a3329,420. The principal articles of export were lac (\u00a343,200), metal cooking utensils (\u00a342,000), ghi (\u00a322,000), iron (\u00a317,500), and cattle (\u00a312,000); the chief imports\u2014rice (\u00a3100,000), salt (\u00a347,500), cattle (\u00a330,500), and tobacco (\u00a322,000). Local trade is carried on by means of weekly markets, and there are very few village shopkeepers. There are about 735 miles of road in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, of which 564 miles are in charge of the Road Cess Department. The eastern portion of the District is traversed by a branch line from the East Indian Railway, 20 miles long\u201415 miles being used for the conveyance of passengers, and the remainder exclusively for the carriage of coal. The stations are Maheshmunda and Giridi; there are also coal sidings at Karharb\u00e1ri and Sr\u00edr\u00e1mpur.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Six coal-fields are known to exist in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District\u2014namely, Karharb\u00e1ri, Karanpura, Bokaro, Ramgarh, Itkhuri, and Chope, all of which see separately. The most important of these is Karharb\u00e1ri, which, it has been estimated, is capable of supplying 250,000 tons a year for 300 years. The coal varies in quality in different parts of the field, the percentage of ash in some specimens being only 4\u00b72 and 4\u00b78, while in others it is as high as 26\u00b75, 34\u00b70, and 39\u00b72. Iron is smelted at many places in the District, and tin is found in Loranga, on the south bank of the Bar\u00e1khar river. At B\u00e1raganda, a village 8 miles west of Loranga, extensive copper mines were formerly\nworked. It is not known when and by whom these workings were undertaken, nor why they were abandoned. An unsuccessful attempt was made to reopen the mines in 1852, and arrangements for a further attempt are now (1883) in progress. Mica is found at several places in Kharakdiha pargana; and antimony mines were worked by Europeans at the end of last century for more than thirteen years at S\u00eddpur, 12 or 14 miles from Chatr\u00e1. They were abandoned owing to a disagreement among the partners.\n\nTea.\u2014In 1882, there were six tea plantations containing mature plants\u2014at Sitagarha, Jhumra, Mahudi, Parasnath, Pundri, and Udawra. The approximate yield of fine tea on the Sitagarha plantation in 1873 was 98 lbs. an acre, and in 1874, 140 lbs. per acre; on the Mahud\u00ed estate in 1872, the approximate yield per acre was 80 lbs. The Parasn\u00e1th plantation occupies the most promising site for tea cultivation in the District, consisting of 14 square miles of land lying on the north face of the hill, at an elevation of between 2000 and 3000 feet. In 1882, the total area under mature plant in these six gardens was 846 acres, yielding an approximate out-turn of 93,510 lbs. of tea, the average yield of mature plants being 110\u00bd lbs. per acre.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Previously to 1835, Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, together with Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Pal\u00e1mau, and P\u00e1nchet, constituted, as has already been explained, the District of R\u00e1mgarh, and no separate returns are available before that date. In 1835 the revenue of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh was \u00a38622; in 1850 it had risen to \u00a310,941; in 1870 to \u00a332,841 (of which, however, \u00a3986 was derived from the income-tax, since discontinued); and in 1882\u201383 to \u00a343,780. The land-tax has increased from \u00a34871 in 1835 to \u00a311,790 in 1882\u201383. The number of separate estates in the District was 86 in 1835, 140 in 1850, 244 in 1870, and 284 in 1882\u201383; so that the average land revenue paid by each estate was, in 1835, \u00a357; in 1850, \u00a340; in 1870, \u00a345; and in 1882\u201383, \u00a341. A peculiar feature of the revenue administration of the District is the exemption of estates from the ordinary process of sale for arrears of revenue. The operation of Regulations xiv. of 1793 and v. of 1812 was suspended for Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh in 1833, and the dastak system of levying arrears was substituted. When an estate falls into arrears, payment is demanded by a written document specifying details; and failing payment, the immovable property of the defaulter is attached, and may be sold. In 1850, the number of magisterial courts in the District was 5; and of civil and revenue courts, 7; in 1882, there were 9 of the former and 4 of the latter. For police purposes, the District is divided into 16 police circles. In 1882, the regular, municipal, and railway police force numbered 540 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a39183. There was also a rural police of 5856 men, maintained by the samind\u00e1s and villagers at an estimated total cost in money or lands of \u00a311,123.\nHAZARIBAGH HEAD-QUARTERS.\n\nThe total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted in that year of 6396 officers and men, or 1 man to every 1.09 square miles or to every 173 of the population; estimated total cost, \u00a320,306, equal to a charge of \u00a33, 3s. 6d. per square mile, or 4\u00bdd. per head of the population. Dak\u0101t\u012b or gang-robbery is said to be common in the District, and the number of cases of housebreaking is very great. There are 3 jails in the District, a central and a District jail at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, and a subsidiary jail at Pachamba; average daily prison population in 1882, 397'64, of whom 18'2 were females.\n\nEducation has hitherto made little way in Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, progress being prevented by the utter indifference of all classes of society. Until 1865 there was no Government school at all; and in 1870\u201371, the number of Government and aided schools was 8, with 403 pupils. In 1871\u201372, the number of such schools was 54, with 1121 pupils; in 1872\u201373, 86, with 2183 pupils; and in 1882\u201383, 250, with 6234 pupils.\n\nThe District is divided into the 2 Sub-divisions of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh and Gir\u012b\u1e0d\u012b, and 47 pargonds or fiscal divisions. The only municipalities are the towns of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh, Chatr\u0101, and Ichak.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh is much cooler and more pleasant than that of Lower Bengal during the months of June to September. The highest maximum temperature in 1881 was 107\u00b0 F.; minimum, 44\u00b0; mean, 74\u00b0. The average yearly rainfall is 48'56 inches. The climate is reckoned healthy, but rheumatism, fever, and dysentery are not uncommon; cholera is rare. The returns of sickness and mortality among the British troops stationed at Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh in 1860\u201369 contrast favourably with the averages of other stations for those years. The troops were, however, withdrawn from Haz\u0101rib\u0101gh in 1874, owing to an outbreak of enteric fever which caused great mortality. There are 3 charitable dispensaries in the District.

Area, 4575 square miles, with 4280 villages or towns, and 114,649 houses. Population (1881) 672,238, namely, males 328,876, and females 343,362. Hindus numbered 568,581; Muhammadans, 60,776; Christians, 380; Sant\u0101ls, 28,555; Kols, 6166; other aboriginal tribes, 7780. Average density of population, 147 per square mile; villages per square mile, 0'94; persons per village, 157; houses per square mile, 26'27; persons per house, 5'86.\nHAZARIBAGH TOWN\u2014HAZRO.\n\nThis Sub-division comprises the 11 police circles (thands) of Hazaribagh, Barhi, Bagodh\u00e1r, Tandaw\u00e1, R\u00e1mgarh, Jageswar, Kashm\u00e1r, Chorp\u00e1, Hunterganj, Chatr\u00e1, and Simoria. In 1883 it contained 3 civil and 7 magisterial courts, a regular police force 414 strong, besides 2047 village watchmen.\n\n**Hazaribagh.\u2014** Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Hazaribagh District, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; picturesquely situated on the high central plateau of the District, at an elevation of 2000 feet above sea-level, and in the midst of a group of conical hills. Lat. 23\u00b0 59' 21\" N., long. 85\u00b0 24' 32\" E. The town is little more than a cluster of hamlets, with intervening cultivation, which sprung up round the former military b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Hazaribagh was the military head-quarters of the District since about 1780 until very recently, and has been the seat of civil administration since 1834. Before that year, the civil head-quarters were alternately at Shergh\u00e1ti and Chatr\u00e1. The cantonment lies southeast of the town. The last military force stationed here was the second battalion 22nd Regiment; but owing to an outbreak of enteric fever in 1874, which resulted in numerous deaths, the troops were withdrawn, with the exception of a small detachment, which was chiefly designed to guard against a possible outbreak of the prisoners in the European penitentiary situated here. Subsequently, on the abolition of the European penitentiary, the European troops were entirely withdrawn, and their place supplied by two companies of a Madras Native Infantry regiment stationed at Doranda. Population (1872) 11,050; (1881) 15,306, namely, males 7639, and females 7667. In 1881, Hindus numbered 11,001; Muhammadans, 4121; and 'others,' 184. Area of town site, 1465 acres. In 1881\u201382, the gross municipal income amounted to \u00a3807, and the expenditure to \u00a3760; average rate of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\n**Hazratpur.\u2014** Village in D\u00e1t\u00e1ganj tahsil, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, situated near the right bank of the Aril river. A purely agricultural village, the population being almost entirely Hindus. Third-class police station, and post-office. Market twice a week.\n\n**Hazro.\u2014** Town in the Attock tahsil of R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab. Lat. 33\u00b0 54' 45\" N., long. 72\u00b0 32' E. Population (1868) 7280; (1881) 6533, namely, 3013 Hindus, 3491 Muhammadans, and 29 Sikhs. Principal town of the Chach plain, said to have been founded by H\u00e1zir Kh\u00e1n, an Al\u00edz\u00e1i Afgh\u00e1n. Constantly plundered in former years by marauders from Gandghar and Yusafz\u00e1\u00ed; but now a prosperous commercial centre, with a brisk trade in English piece-goods, grain, and indigo, with the neighbouring tribes in independent territory, and the surrounding villages. Manufacture of snuff for exportation in large quantities. A third-class municipality, with an income in 1882\u201383 of\n\u00a31374, and an expenditure of \u00a31222; average incidence of taxation, 4s. 2\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Hebbal\u00e9.** \u2014 Village in the R\u00e1masw\u00e1mikano hobli, in Coorg. Population (1881) 1967. School with 25 pupils. Eight miles from Fraserpet, with which it is connected by a good road.\n\n**Hebli.** \u2014 Town in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency; 7 miles east of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town. Lat. 15\u00b0 28' 50\" N., long. 75\u00b0 10' E. Population, presumably, in the absence of Census statistics, under 5000. Hebli is situated on rising ground, with an old dilapidated fort in the centre. A weekly market is held here. The land revenue has been alienated by Government.\n\n**Heggadadevankot.** \u2014 T\u00e1luk in the south-west of Mysore District, Mysore State. Area, 652 square miles, of which 73 are cultivated. Population (1871) 54,829; (1881) 64,039, namely, 63,849 Hindus, 1705 Muhammadans, 356 Jains, and 129 Christians; land revenue (1874\u201375), exclusive of water rates, \u00a34025, or 1s. 9d. per cultivated acre; revenue (1883), \u00a35616. A large proportion of the area is covered with forest, the haunt of elephants and other wild animals. Gold dust has been found in the jungle streams of the t\u00e1luk, and iron is worked to some extent. Forests cover a total area of 150 square miles. There are two District forests. The soil is fertile, and cultivation is extending. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 criminal court; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 9; regular police, 68 men; and village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 222.\n\n**Heggadadevankot.** \u2014 Village in Mysore District, Mysore State; head-quarters of Heggadadevankot t\u00e1luk. Lat. 12\u00b0 5' 50\" N., long. 76\u00b0 21' 50\" E. Population (1881) 1204. Of mythical antiquity, and latterly the residence of a local chief. The site of a ruined fort.\n\n**Hemavati** ('Golden,' or Yenne-hole). \u2014 A tributary of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, which flows from north-west to south-east across Hassan District, Mysore State, for about 120 miles; it forms for a short distance the boundary of Coorg on the north-east of the Yelusavirshime t\u00e1luk, and joins the K\u00e1veri at Tippur. In Hindu mythology, the Hemavati appears as the daughter of Daksha and wife of Iswara or Siva. Its waters, taking their rise at Javali in K\u00e4d\u00far District, are in their subsequent course dammed in six places, which supply channels 117 miles in length, irrigating 7229 acres, and yielding a revenue of \u00a34740. The most recent of the embankments is said to have been built four centuries ago. The largest, which had been repeatedly breached by floods, has been repaired since 1863 at a cost of \u00a327,850, and is now water-tight. At Sakleshpur, the Hemavati is crossed by a bridge, formed of four iron lattice girders, each 120 feet long and resting on cylinders, which was completed in 1870, at a cost of \u00a319,462.\nHEMTABAD\u2014HENZADA.\n\nHemtabad.\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal; situated on the bank of the Kulik river, 30 miles west of Din\u00e1jpur town. Lat. 25\u00b0 40' 40\" N., long. 88\u00b0 15' 50\" E.\n\nHenckellganj.\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, in the north of the Jessore Sundarbans, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 27' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 2' E. Founded in 1782 or 1783 by Mr. Henckell, then Magistrate of the District, as a part of his scheme for the reclamation of the Sundarbans. Now only a petty hamlet with an insignificant trade in grain. Its name has become corrupted into 'Hingalganj,' by which it appears in the Survey maps. Chandkhali, another mart established by Mr. Henckell at the same time, has prospered greatly, and is now one of the most thriving marts in the Sundarbans.\n\nHenzada.\u2014A District in the Irawadi Division, British Burma, lying between 17\u00b0 18' and 18\u00b0 34' N. lat., and between 94\u00b0 53' and 95\u00b0 45' E. long. Bounded on the north by Prome District; on the east by the Irawadi, except in the extreme south, where it is bounded by the Tharawadi; on the south by Thongwa and Bassein Districts; and on the west by the Arakan Yoma range. Area, 1948 square miles. Population (1881) 318,077 persons. The head-quarters of the District are at Henzada town, on the right bank of the Irawadi. The present District of Henzada was formed in April 1878. As yet (1885) it contains no railways, but has 171 miles of made roads.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Henzada District stretches in one great plain, lying on the west of the Irawadi, with a small tract of two revenue circles in the south-east of that river. With the exception of the central and south-eastern portions, the whole region has been protected from inundation by extensive embankments, so that by far the greater part of the country is now suitable for rice cultivation. The chief mountains of the District are the Arakan range, of which the highest elevation in Henzada, attained in the latitude of Myanaung, is 4003 feet above sea-level; from this point southward the heights rapidly diminish. In the north the spurs extend down towards the Irawadi, one of them ending at Akauk-taung in a scarped cliff 300 feet high. The slopes are precipitous, and the country is densely wooded. Numerous torrents pour down, and unite in the plains to form large streams. The principal are the Pata-shin, the Ot-po, and the Nangath\u00fa, falling into the Irawadi and Bassein. The river Irawadi, which flows from north to south through the District, with a general south-east course, is navigable by steamers at all seasons. The Sanda, the Al\u00fan, and the Padaw rise in the Arakan Mountains, and unite to form the Pata-shin, which falls into the Irawadi just below Kyan-kin; their extreme length is 95 miles. The Ka-nyin, or Ot-po, also rises in the Arakan Yomas, flows south-east for 60 miles, and, uniting with the Sinb\u00fan at its mouth, falls into the Thambaya-\ndaing. The Ka-nyin irrigates a highly-cultivated country. The Bassein River is a branch of the Irawadi, which it leaves about 9 miles above Henzada; thence it flows south-west, through Bassein District, to the sea.\n\nThe forests of Henzada comprise many valuable varieties of timber. Teak is found in the north of the District. The other principal timber-trees are\u2014pyingado (Xylia dolabriformis), pyin-ma (Lagerstroemia reginae), in (Dipterocarpus sp. tuberculatus et alatus), furnishing a hard wood used for house-building, bridge piles, boat anchors, railway sleepers, boat-building, etc.; yindaik (Dalbergia sp.) and ban-bwe (Careya arborea) are used for carts and plough-poles; sha (Acacia catechu) furnishes cutch. The inner bark of a species of Bignonia is used for making ropes. Several trees, e.g. Bombax pentandra, B. heterophylla, Sterculia, Odina wodier, etc., yield gums, resins, and varnishing oil. The unauthorized felling of a teak tree has always been strictly prohibited. In 1876, a large area west of the Irawadi was set apart as Government forest, in which the felling of several other kinds of trees without licence has been forbidden. Serpentine and soapstone occur together almost everywhere in this District. Petroleum was discovered some years ago near Myan-aung, but the well then sunk has long been abandoned. Gold is found in the bed of the Irawadi, but in too small quantities to render its extraction worth the labour. Coal has been found in the valleys of the Padaw and of the Ot-po, and borings to discover the extent of the field are being carried on at the latter site.\n\nThe total rainfall of the District in 1881 was 83.17 inches, over 69 of which fell between the months of June and September; the hottest period was in May, the temperature rising to 106\u00b0 F. in the shade; the highest reading in July was 88\u00b0. The District of Henzada contains the Tu and Duya lakes, two of the five principal sheets of water in the Province of Burma.\n\nHistory.\u2014Henzada District formed a portion of the Talaing kingdom of Pegu, annexed to the Burmese Empire in 1753 by Alaung-paya (Alompra); but it seems to have had at no period an independent existence. Its towns were occasionally attacked and defended, but the people appear to have taken no special part in any of the wars. During the first Burmese war, no resistance was offered to the British army in the District as it is now constituted. After the fall of Donabyu, in the first Burmese war of 1824\u201326, Sir Archibald Campbell continued his advance up the Irawadi, and was met at Taroh-pmaw by Burmese envoys, with whom he declined entering into negotiations until Prome was reached. Soon after the capture of Rangoon and Bassein during the second Burmese war, Donabyu was again taken; in July 1852, Prome was seized. When the Burmese received intelligence of this event, they immediately abandoned their extensive fortifications at\nAkauk-taung, and were discovered crossing the river. An attack was at once made by the British; the works at Akauk-taung and several of the 28 guns which they contained were destroyed, and subsequently the Burmese general in command surrendered. The whole of the delta was not, however, entirely cleared of Burmese troops, and many marauders remained who only awaited a favourable opportunity for opening a guerilla war upon the British and their supporters. No attempts were made to occupy Akauk-taung, and the Burmese took advantage of this to rebuild the stockades; but these were stormed by Captain Loch, R.N., with a small force, and captured without the loss of a single man. To prevent the establishment of any similar posts, a small guard was stationed off Akauk-taung, and directed to patrol the hills regularly. Only a few days after this force was enrolled, Major Gardner (the commander) and a havildar were killed, and 6 Sepoys wounded whilst on duty. A detachment was at once despatched from Prome; the enemy were routed, and Akauk-taung was occupied. No further serious disturbances occurred on the right bank of the Irawadi in this neighbourhood. But meanwhile Bassein and the southern part of Henzada had been in a still more unsettled state. The principal leader of revolt in Henzada was one Myat-tun. (See Donabu Town.) The defeat of Myat-tun, and the dispersion of his gang, together with the firm but conciliatory policy pursued by the civil officers in charge, relieved the whole country, and no serious disturbances have occurred since.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014In 1881, the population of Henzada District, as at present constituted, was returned at 318,077 persons; and the area at 1948 square miles. The general results of the Census of that year may be thus summarized:\u2014Average density of population, 163 persons per square mile; number of towns and villages, 1231; houses, 58,996, of which 55,499 were occupied and 3497 unoccupied; average number of villages per square mile, .63; houses per square mile, 30.2; persons per village, 258; persons per occupied house, 5.73. Classified according to sex, there were 159,576 males and 158,501 females; of these there were, under 15 years of age, boys 69,807, girls 45,323; total, 115,130, or 36 per cent. of the whole population. The religious division of the people shows\u2014Buddhists, 311,741; Christians, 4308; Muhammadans, 1192 (mostly Sunnis); Hindus, 703; 'Nat,' or spirit-worshippers, 121; and a few (12) Parsis. Buddhists form 98 per cent. of the population. As the District has been constituted within its present limits only since 1878, no trustworthy comparison, as regards increase or decrease of population, can be made with the statistics of the previous years; but there is no doubt that an increase, not a decrease, has taken place since 1872.\n\nOf the 1231 towns and villages in Henzada District, 714 con-\ntained (1881) less than two hundred inhabitants; 424 from two to five hundred; 69 from five hundred to one thousand; 18 from one thousand to two thousand; 1 from two thousand to three thousand; 2 from three thousand to five thousand; 2 from five thousand to ten thousand; and 1 from fifteen thousand to twenty thousand. The Census classifies the adult male population, according to occupation, into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description and the learned professions, 3800; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 140; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 9124; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 57,304; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 13,347; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupations, 75,865.\n\nThe number of immigrants from British India into Henzada District during the ten years ending 1876 was 90,797. Under the encouragement of the local government, the numbers may be expected to increase. The number of Burmese in the District in 1876 was greatly in excess of Talaings, the fact being that on the conquest of the lower country by Alaung-pay\u00e1 (Alompra), every effort was made to destroy the Talaing nationality. After the first Burmese war (1824\u201326), many Talaings who had assisted the British succumbed under the cruelties exercised upon them by the Burmese. It is noted by Sir. A. Phayre that \u2018scarcely any one of Talaing descent now calls himself anything but a Burmese, so completely has the national spirit been extinguished.\u2019 In 1881, the number of Talaings had dwindled to 2950. In the same year, Karengs numbered 38,283; Shans, 1660; Chins, 3652; and Chinese, 445. The Karengs are considered, in contradistinction to the Burmese and Talaings, as \u2018wild\u2019 tribes. They readily adopt the teachings of Christianity. The Kareng language is monosyllabic and tonic, and is said to show traces of connection with the Chinese. There are half a million Karengs in the whole of British Burma. The Chins or Khyins are remarkable for the wholesale manner in which they tattoo their females, so as not to leave an eyelid free from the deforming marks. The Shans are traders and pedlars. They immigrate from Upper Burma, and do not usually remain resident long in one town or District.\n\nThe chief occupation of the people of Henzada is rice cultivation, which is spreading, owing to the increased provision of irrigation and embankment works. The number of persons returned by the Census of 1881 as engaged in agriculture is 233,597, or 73 per cent. of the total population; of whom 26,530 males and 10,466 females are landowners. A large proportion of the agriculturists are women, who do a great deal of what is generally supposed to be exclusively man\u2019s work.\n\nThe chief towns are:\u2014Henzada, the head-quarters of the District,\nin lat. 17\u00b0 58' N., and long. 95\u00b0 32' E., with a population in 1881 of 16,724: Kyan-gin, on the Irawadi, just above the mouth of the Pata-shin, in lat. 18\u00b0 19' N., and long. 95\u00b0 1' 50\" E.; it has a considerable export trade in rice; its population in 1881 was 7565, chiefly Burmese: Myan-aung, once the head-quarters of the Pegu Light Infantry, a corps now disbanded; in 1881, the number of inhabitants was 5416: Kan-aung, 7 miles below Myan-aung, was founded by Alaung-pay\u00e1, about 1753; its small population of 3218 persons is mainly composed of Burmese: Za-lun, with a court-house of the extra-Assistant Commissioner of Za-lun township; the population in 1881 was 3240.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Henzada District, situated at the head of the delta of the Irawadi, has always been extensively cultivated with rice, which finds a ready market at Rangoon and Bassein, with which communication is easy by the numerous creeks intersecting the country. About ten years after the British occupied Pegu, systematic efforts were first made to protect the country from periodical inundation. In 1862-63, small embankments were constructed at (1) Kyan-gin, (2) Myan-aung, (3) Kan-aung, (4) Henzada, (5) Anauk-bhet, (6) Tham-bo-ta-ra, (7) Du-ra, (8) Za-lun. The area of land cultivated behind the Kyan-gin section has increased since 1867-68 from 1590 to 2350 acres, and there is now little spare land available here. The Myan-aung embankment was made in sections,\u2014in 1864-65 the first section became protective, and the number of acres cultivated rose from 13,044 in 1863-64 to 14,543 next year. The third and last section was finished in 1869-70; and by 1873-74, the total protected area had increased to 32,504 acres. The Bassein river embankment now protects 519 acres, where before only 427 were cultivated; the Henzada embankment protects 65,750 acres, as compared with 22,468 acres cultivated before the work was constructed. The embankments at present consist of\u2014(1) one extending from above Kyan-gin westward along the Pata-shin; (2) another stretching along the right bank of the Pata-shin to the Irawadi, and down to Lu-daw-su; (3) another flanking the Bassein river to its northern mouth in the Irawadi, and down that river to below Za-lun. The receipts from these works during the year 1882-83 were \u00a346,288; and \u00a38907 was spent on their maintenance. The total outlay on the entire works up to the year 1882-83 was \u00a3304,208, the expenditure sanctioned being \u00a3315,014. Taking the projects in detail, the sanctioned outlay is thus divided:\u2014the Kyan-gin section, \u00a315,506; the Myan-aung section, \u00a3110,228; and the Henzada section, \u00a3189,280. The three projects together form the Western Series of the Irawadi Embankments.\n\nOf the 1948 square miles which now constitute the area of the District, 399 are cultivated, 1402.5 are cultivable but waste, and 146.5\nuncultivable. The staple crops of the District are rice, sesamum, vegetables, and tobacco. In 1856, there were 126,156 acres under rice, 3854 under garden produce, and 12,007 under miscellaneous crops; total, 142,017 acres. In 1881, when the area was much smaller, there were 233,009 acres of rice land, 14,355 of garden land, and 15,566 acres planted with miscellaneous crops; total area under cultivation, 262,930 acres. The other products are cotton (grown for local use), p\u0101n, etc. Tobacco is raised principally on sandbanks left dry by the falling of the Irawadi; the cheapness of imported Indian tobacco prevents any extensive cultivation of this plant; area under tobacco, 2078 acres in 1882-83. Under rice in the same year, 240,892 acres; oil-seeds, 2360 acres; vegetables, 4971 acres; chillies, 293 acres; and cotton, 22 acres. The average rent of land during the ten years ending 1881 was about 1 rupee 8 annas (3s.) per acre. For rice lands the cultivator pays 5 rupees (10s.), the average rent for rice land in the whole Province being 7s. The fertility of the soil is great, the average yield of rice being 1600 lbs. per acre. For the whole Province the average yield is 1351 lbs. per acre. Cotton yields 612 lbs., tobacco 1095 lbs., and sesamum 630 lbs. per acre. The price of rice, per maund of 80 lbs., during the ten years ending 1881, has varied between Rs. 3. 2 (6s. 3d.) and Rs. 2. 8 (5s.); of cotton, between Rs. 8. 12 (17s. 6d.) and Rs. 4. 14 (9s. 9d.); of tobacco, between Rs. 9. 12 (19s. 6d.) and Rs. 7 (14s.); of sesamum, between Rs. 5. 12 (11s. 6d.) and Rs. 3 (6s.).\n\nAdministration.\u2014On the annexation of Pegu (1853), the old Henzada District was called Sarawa, or Thara-waw, and very shortly afterwards was divided into two Districts, called Henzada and Tharawadi. These were subsequently united under the name of Myan-aung, which a few years ago (1878) was changed to Henzada, on the head-quarters being transferred to the town of that name. In 1873, the Thon-ze circle of Rangoon District was added; in 1875, the Donaby\u00fa township was taken away; and in 1878 Henzada was constituted anew, the District of Tharawadi being formed from the country east of the Irawadi. Under Burmese rule, the revenue annually remitted from the old District to the Central Government at Ava was \u00a330,127, derived from house family tax, land, fisheries, transit dues, etc. On the British occupation, the transit dues were abolished, and an excise tax imposed. In 1855-56, the total revenue of the District amounted to \u00a349,995, from land, capitation, and salt taxes, timber, excise, etc. In 1864-65, the total revenue had increased to \u00a382,951; in 1881-82, the revenue of the present District was \u00a3107,727, of which \u00a348,013 was land revenue. In this last year, the local revenue derived from municipal and town taxes, market stall rent, fines, and 10 per cent cess, amounted to \u00a312,499. The total area assessed was, in 1881,\n262,930 acres, the assessment ranging, on cultivated land, from 14 annas (1s. 9d.) to 3 rupees (6s.), and on cultivable but not cultivated land, 2 annas (3d.). The rate per acre on the total area of surveyed and settled land was 15\u00bd annas, or very nearly 2s.\n\nHenzada now includes the two Sub-divisions of Henzada and Myan-aung; these are divided into 6 townships, each under an extra-Assistant Commissioner; the townships comprise 47 revenue circles. Each township, shortly after the annexation of Pegu, was placed under a Burmese officer called myo-ok, who possessed judicial and fiscal power. Immediately under him were the thugyi, or revenue circle and police officers, whose areas of jurisdiction varied between 3 and 20 square miles. Subordinate to the myo-ok and thugyi were the gaung or officers appointed over every 100 families. The gaung constituted the village constabulary. The Burmese revenue system was to exact a fixed sum annually from the various divisions, and to allow the officials no defined salary, but only the fines on criminals and the fees on the administration of justice. Consequently, as a rule, it was the aim of each official to extort as much as possible from the people without arousing discontent and causing appeals to be made to the Government at Ava. The result of the first Burmese war was to throw these officials loose upon the country. A local regiment, called the Pegu Light Infantry, was raised, consisting of 588 officers and men, with their headquarters at Myan-aung, now, as already stated, disbanded. In two years, the insurrections subsequent on the war were quelled, and gradually the state of the country improved. The people appeared glad to accept the change of rulers; population increased, and the revenue rose in amount, while its incidence per head fell. In 1861, on the formation of the existing Provincial police, the corps of the Pegu Light Infantry was abolished. In 1881, the police force consisted of 302 men, or 1 policeman to every 1053 inhabitants. The District jail at Henzada is only a lock-up, like that at Myan-aung. During the year 1881-82, an average number of 91 prisoners was confined in Henzada, and 33 in Myan-aung jail. At Henzada the jail expenditure was \u00a3781. In Myan-aung the cost of the lock-up was \u00a3471.\n\nAs early as 1855, schools were established by the American Baptist Mission, and in 1856 a Kareng Normal School was opened in Henzada. The average daily attendance in the Government schools in 1881 was\u2014in Henzada, 42; Myan-aung, 193. The total number on the rolls of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission School was 80, and the average daily attendance 85. In Henzada there is also a school for Burmese girls. The total number of pupils in 1881 was 73, and the average daily attendance 59. In 1876, the Director of Public Instruction reported that in this District indigenous lay education was founded on a permanently sound and steadily broadening\nbasis. The five Kareng schools in the District had 420 pupils in 1883-84; and of these 99 were girls. In this year, the last for which statistics are available, there were 235 Government and 5 private institutions in the District; number of pupils in the former, 6553; in the latter, 53. Of the 235 Government institutions, 231 are indigenous schools under private management receiving some form of State aid. The number of girls' schools was 58 in 1884; pupils, 678.\n\nThe number of dispensaries in Henzada District was 2 in 1882; in-door patients treated, 361; out-door, 7296. Vaccinations (1882) 2696; cost of operations, \u00a395. Henzada and Myan-aung are telegraph stations. The former is the only municipality. [For further information regarding Henzada, see British Burma Gazetteer, compiled by authority (Rangoon, 1879); the British Burma Census Report for 1881; and the Provincial Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nHenzada.\u2014Township in Henzada District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. It is situated on the right bank of the Irawadi, and extends westwards to the Arakan Yomas. The country is very fertile, and produces much rice; it is now protected from inundation by the Irawadi and Bassein embankments. The township is divided into 12 revenue circles. Population (1876) 73,644; (1881) 87,435; gross revenue in 1881, \u00a325,367. The principal town is HENZADA, the head-quarters of the District.\n\nHenzada.\u2014Municipal town and head-quarters of Henzada District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; lies on the right bank of the Irawadi. Lat. 17\u00b0 38' N., long. 95\u00b0 32' E. Population (1876) 15,307; (1881) 16,724, of whom 15,906 are Burmese. Hindus number 392; Muhammadans, 293; Christians, 116; and 'others,' 17. The town contains court-houses, treasury, police station, post and telegraph offices, etc. A line of metre-gauge railway is projected, and the necessary surveys have been made between Henzada and the station of Thongzai on the Prome and Rangoon Railway. The line is to be carried on an elevated trestle work a few feet above the highest flood-levels. In 1881, 4342 patients were treated at the dispensary, of whom 210 were in-door patients; and 5157 in 1882, of whom 251 were in-door. There are three schools in Henzada, a Kareng, a Government town school, and a school for Burmese, established by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In one school a class for Burmese girls was attended (1882) by 70 pupils. Gross municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a37729. Henzada is also the head-quarters of the Irawadi Division.\n\nHer\u00e1t.\u2014The western Province of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, forming a separate Governorship under a high officer appointed by the Amfr. Her\u00e1t consists of the six Districts of Ghor\u00ed\u00e1n, S\u00e1bzaw\u00e1r, Tarah, Bakwa, K\u00farak, and Obeh. The Province formerly included the District of\nFarah, which lies half-way between Her\u00e1t and Kandah\u00e1r. Her\u00e1t is bounded on the north by the Th\u00e1r Vil\u00e1yat and F\u00edrozkohi country; east by the T\u00e1im\u00fan\u00eds and Kandah\u00e1r; south by Lash Jawain and Seist\u00e1n; and west by Persia and the Hari R\u00fad. According to Conolly, it contains 446 villages, 8 large canals which feed innumerable smaller ones, 123 watercourses, 2288 ploughs; and it produces 98,000 kharvars of wheat, or 49,000,000 lbs. A full description of Her\u00e1t lies beyond the scope of this work; but the following brief details, most of them taken from General C. M. MacGregor's account, may be useful.\n\nFerrier states the following to be the numbers of the male population of Her\u00e1t capable of bearing arms,\u2014namely, Ghori\u00e1ns, 12,000; S\u00e1bzaw\u00e1r, 10,000; Farah, 15,000; Bakwa, 4000; K\u00farak, 2500; Aimaks, 3000; and Obeh; total, 48,000. Tribes in alliance with Her\u00e1t and obliged to furnish a contingent are\u2014Haz\u00e1ra Zeidn\u00e1ts of K\u00e1la Nao, 12,000; T\u00e1im\u00fan\u00eds of Ghor, 8000; Baluch\u00eds of Seist\u00e1n, 5000; total, 25,000;\u2014grand total, 73,000. The Char Aimaks, a pastoral nomadic race, occupy an extensive region of the Province, and congregate in the city of Her\u00e1t. They pay no tribute, but on the contrary receive a subsidy from the Governor of Her\u00e1t.\n\nTaylor says that the several tribes subordinate to, or in the neighbourhood of Her\u00e1t, could collectively assemble 47,000 horse and 23,000 foot, thus:\n\n| Tribe                  | Horse | Foot |\n|------------------------|-------|------|\n| Tekke T\u00farkom\u00e1ns       | 15,000|      |\n| Sarokh                 | 8,000 |      |\n| Salor                  | 2,000 | 1,000 |\n| Irs\u00e1l\u00ed                 | 500   | 500  |\n| Ch\u00e1rsangh\u00ed             |       |      |\n| II\u00e1z\u00e1sas of Persia    | 4,000 |      |\n| Jamsh\u00edd\u00eds             | 4,000 |      |\n| T\u00e1im\u00fan\u00eds               | 4,000 | 2,000 |\n| T\u00e1im\u00faris               | 150   |      |\n| F\u00edrozkoh\u00eds             | 5,000 |      |\n| Berbar\u00ed Haz\u00e1ras       | 5,000 | 5,000 |\n\nTotal, 47,650 23,500\n\nThe country known as the Her\u00e1t valley is a fertile stretch of land 450 square miles in area, or 30 miles long by 15 broad. The Hari R\u00fad irrigates the valley. Wheat, barley, maize, and rice are the staple products, and gardens with orchards abound. The poppy is cultivated; but nowhere else in the Province, it is said, will that plant grow. Mulberry trees in every village supply materials for the rearing of silkworms. The population of the Her\u00e1t valley is estimated (1882) at 100,000, of whom 80,000 are Dur\u00e1n\u00eds and 20,000 Farahs and Aimaks. The valley, once well peopled, but greatly depopulated of late years, owing to the tyranny of Y\u00e1r Muhammed and other Governors of Her\u00e1t, yields a revenue of \u00a370,000. The land is highly\nproductive, but its natural resources are imperfectly developed. There are two species of tenure. The land is divided into *khasila* land and *arbabi* land. *Khasila* land is confiscated land or State property. *Arbabi* land is land held by private owners. Owing to misgovernment and consequent insecurity, both tenures are precarious. There are two kinds of assessment on the *arbabi* or privately-owned lands called the *jambasba* and *seh-kot* assessments. The former is a forced assessment; the latter\u2014*seh-kot*, three parts\u2014is the general form of Government demand, and refers to the one-third of the gross produce required on each year's out-turn.\n\nIn the time of Y\u00e1r Mu\u1e25ammad, there were eight battalions of infantry recruited from the tribes he had transported to the Her\u00e1t region, and Mr. Eastwick says that five regiments of infantry and 4000 cavalry comprised the force kept up. These are nearly all stationed at or near Her\u00e1t town, and live in their own houses. The revenue of Her\u00e1t Province has been estimated variously from \u00a389,248 (Conolly) to \u00a3130,000 (Burnes). A more recent authority than either puts it at \u00a3160,000. K\u00e1z\u00ed Abdul K\u00e1d\u00edr, one of the late Am\u00edr Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n's principal ministers, gives the following approximate return of men, women, and children in the Her\u00e1t Province:\u2014Men, 140,000; women, 200,000; children, 130,000; total, 470,000.\n\n**Her\u00e1t.**\u2014Chief town of the Her\u00e1t Province, Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; situated on the right bank of the Hari R\u00fad river, in a very beautiful and fertile plain. Lat. 34\u00b0 2\u2032 N., long. 62\u00b0 8\u2032 E.; elevation, 2650 feet. Distance from Kandah\u00e1r, 369 miles; from Pesh\u00e1war via Kandah\u00e1r and K\u00e1b\u00fal, 881 miles; from both Teheran and Kh\u00edva, about 700 miles. The city is rectangular and almost square, the northern and southern sides measuring 1500, and the eastern and western sides about 1600 yards in length. It is protected by walls 25 to 30 feet high, built on earthen ramparts varying from 40 to 60 feet in height; and is surrounded by a deep wet ditch. There are five gates; and from the middle of each face run four main streets, which meet in the centre of the town in a small domed quadrangle. The principal of these streets\u2014commencing in the middle of the south face\u2014is covered in throughout its entire length by a vaulted roof; and many of the smaller streets which branch off from the main ones are built over in the same way, forming low dark tunnels. The houses, which are generally two storeys high, are for the most part substantially built of bricks and mud, and are so constructed that each forms in itself a little citadel, capable of resisting men armed with muskets. The town is abundantly supplied with excellent water, most of the houses having wells or reservoirs of their own; yet Her\u00e1t is said to possess strong claims to be considered the dirtiest city in the world. There are no drains, and the inhabitants have no notions of cleanliness or sanitation.\nThe principal building is the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, situated in the north-east quarter, and built at the end of the 15th century. It occupies an area of 800 yards square; it was, when perfect, 465 feet long by 275 feet wide, and had 408 cupolas, 444 pillars, and 6 entrances. It was splendidly adorned with gilding, and with carved and mosaic work of the most elaborate description. To the west of the Jam\u00e1 Masjid is the palace of Ch\u00e1rb\u00e1gh, a mean building, originally the winter residence of the chiefs of Her\u00e1t, and occupied by Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n while Governor of the Province. A large reservoir of water, called the Haoz-i-Ch\u00e1rs\u00fa, is situated at the south-east corner of the central quadrangle. The Ark, or citadel, which is 150 yards long from east to west and 50 yards wide, is near the centre of the north face, about 200 yards from the main wall. Connecting it with the wall, and projecting beyond it to the east and west, is the Ark-i-n\u00e1o, or new citadel, which occupies about a thousand feet in length of the north face.\n\nThe population of the city has varied greatly from time to time. The most recent estimate does not attempt to number a doubtless very fluctuating population, but sets down the number of houses at 1500. The majority of the inhabitants are Muhammadans of the Shi\u00e1 sect, but there are besides a number of Hindus and Afgh\u00e1ns; Persians, Tartars, T\u00farkom\u00e1ns, and Jews are also met with in the principal streets. The original inhabitants appear to have been Persians, and to have belonged to the race that spread from Seist\u00e1n towards the north-east, and formed the ancient Province of Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, of which, until recently, Her\u00e1t remained the capital. Probably no city in Central Asia has sustained so many sieges, and been so often destroyed and depopulated. From the middle of the 12th century, when it fell into the hands of the T\u00farkom\u00e1ns, \u2018who committed the most frightful ravages, and left not one stone upon another,\u2019 till 1863, when it was finally taken by the Am\u00edr of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, in whose hands it has since remained, Her\u00e1t has been the scene of continual strife. The T\u00farkom\u00e1ns, the Uzbegs, and the Persians have repeatedly besieged and taken the city, only to be in turn driven out of it. Its geographical position and strategical importance have given rise to the name \u2018Key of India,\u2019 frequently applied to the town by controversial writers.\n\nHerum\u00e1l\u00fa.\u2014Village in Coorg, at which a j\u00e1tra or festival is annually held during Sivar\u00e1tri, in connection with a more frequented festival at the neighbouring village of Irpu.\n\nHeshto (Hasdo).\u2014River in Kore\u00e1 Tributary State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; the largest river in the State. Rising near Sonh\u00e1t, it flows south through Kore\u00e1 into Bil\u00e1spur in the Central Provinces. It forms a fine waterfall near Kirw\u00e1h\u00ed.\nHigh Level Canal.\u2014Main system of the Orissa Canal System.\u2014See Mahanadi.\n\nHijili.\u2014Sea-coast division of Midnapur District, Bengal; consisting of the tract of land from the mouth of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan along the west bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed to the northern boundary of Balasor District. Lat. $21^\\circ 37'$ to $22^\\circ 11'$ N., long. $87^\\circ 27' 30\"$ to $88^\\circ 1' 45\"$ E. The Survey maps of 1849 return the area at $1013.95$ square miles. The tract is well watered by navigable rivers and numerous intersecting watercourses; it produces great quantities of rice, and is dotted with plantations of date-trees and other palms. Prior to the abolition of the Government salt monopoly, Hijili was one of the great seats of salt manufacture in Bengal, by evaporation from the sea. This industry has, however, fallen off to a great extent of late years, the native article being unable to compete with the cheaper imported Liverpool salt. Upon the Company's assuming the administration of Bengal, Hijili, which then contained the large fiscal divisions (pargans) of Taml\u00fak and Mahish\u00e1dal, constituted a separate administration of its own. In 1789, these two last-named tracts were transferred to Midnapur; and in 1836, Hijili itself was also annexed to that District, with the exception of three small southern pargans, which were added to the Orissa District of Balasor.\n\nHill Tipperah.\u2014Native State adjoining the British District of Tipperah, Bengal; lying between $22^\\circ 59'$ and $24^\\circ 31'$ N. lat., and between $91^\\circ 12'$ and $92^\\circ 24'$ E. long. Bounded on the north by the Assam District of Sylhet; on the west by the Bengal Districts of Tipperah and No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed; on the south by No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed and Chittagong; and on the east by the Lush\u00e1i country and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The western boundary of the State, where it adjoins the Regulation District of Tipperah, was fixed by arbitration in 1854. The eastern boundary, separating it from the Lush\u00e1i country and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, is formed, according to the Surveyor-General's map of 1875, by the Lung\u00e1i river, between the H\u00e1ichek and J\u00e1mpui ranges to its source in Betling Sfb peak; the line next runs in an irregular line to the Dol\u00e1jari peak, and then along the Sardeng range and the Phen\u00ed river, till the latter enters No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed District. Area, 4086 square miles. Population, according to the Census Report of 1881, 95,637. The capital of the State is Agartala, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and of the British Political Officer.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014As its name implies, the country is hilly. From west to east the ground rises, but neither by a gradual ascent nor by a single sudden elevation. Five or six ranges of hills run parallel, from north to south, at an average distance of about 12 miles from each other. These ranges, and also the valleys between them, increase in height as they approach the east. The hills are covered for the\nmost part with bamboo jungle, while the low ground abounds with trees of various kinds, cane-brakes, and swamps. Along the north-western and southern boundaries of the State lies a narrow strip of lowland, differing in no material respect, as regards soil, agriculture, and population, from those parts of the Districts of Sylhet, Tipperah, and Chittagong, which adjoin it. From the summit of the ranges, the view of the country is striking, but monotonous. The low bamboo-covered hills look at a distance like mere undulations clad with verdure. Here and there, in the spring, a yellow spot marks the place where the bamboos have been cleared away for the purpose of jum cultivation; or the smoke of a hamlet may be seen rising above the jungle and low trees. But one view is exactly the same as another.\n\nThe principal hill ranges, beginning from the east, are the J\u00e1mpui (highest peaks, Betling Sfb, 3200 feet, and J\u00e1mpui, 1860 feet), Sakkan Tlang (highest peak, Sakkan, 2578 feet), Langtar\u00e1i (Pheng Pu\u00ed peak, 1581 feet), and Ath\u00e1ramur\u00e1 (highest points, J\u00e1ri-mur\u00e1, 1500 feet, and At\u00e1rmur\u00e1, 1431 feet). Betling Sfb, the highest point in the State, is the Sorphuel of the old maps. The chief rivers of Hill Tipperah are the GUMTI, H\u00e1or\u00e1, Khoy\u00e1i, Dhal\u00e1i, Manu, Juri, and PHENI, all of which are navigable by boats of about 2 tons during the rainy season only. In the plains the people use boats as almost the sole means of conveyance at this time of the year, and in the hills nearly every family has its dug-out canoe. The thick forests which cover the whole of the hilly tracts of the State yield an important part of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's revenues, and might, if properly worked, prove much more lucrative than they are. The forest produce is at present farmed, but, for want of accurate knowledge as to what the farms are capable of yielding, they are let out in almost all cases at very low rates. The forest dues, which include cesses for felling and gathering bamboos, canes, reeds, etc., and for exporting the same, amounted in 1881-82 to \u00a35436. Most of the timber floated down the rivers during the rains is used for boat-building, for which it is excellently suited. The forests give shelter to numbers of wild elephants; amongst other large game, the bison, rhinoceros, tiger, leopard, and bear are found, and deer of several kinds are common. Of small game, hares, pheasants, partridges, jungle-fowl, pigeons, snipe, and quail are met with; and the number and variety of singing birds and birds of beautiful plumage are very great. The python, cobra, and bamboo snake are all common; the Lush\u00e1is kill the boa-constrictor for food. The revenue obtained by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 from the capture of elephants within his territory ranges from \u00a3500 to \u00a32500 a year.\n\nHistory.\u2014The name Tipperah, a corruption of Tr\u00edpura, was probably given to the country in honour of the temple at Udaipur, of which remains still exist, and which ranks as the second tirth\u00e1, or sacred\nshrine, in this part of Bengal. It was dedicated either to Tripuradana, the 'sun-god,' or to Tripureswari, the 'mistress of the three worlds.' The history of the State comprehends two distinct epochs\u2014the traditional period described in the R\u00e1jmdl\u00e1, or 'Chronicles of the Kings of Tipperah;' and the period since 1407 A.D., to the record of which both the R\u00e1jmdl\u00e1 and the writings of Muhammadan historians have contributed. The R\u00e1jmdl\u00e1 is a history in Beng\u00e1li verse, compiled by the Br\u00e1hmans of the Court of Tr\u00edpura, and is said to be the oldest specimen of Beng\u00e1li composition extant. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Hill Tipperah claims descent from Drujho, son of Yay\u00e1ti, one of the Lunar race of kings; and the chronicle traces his descent with the usual elaboration. The chief points of interest revealed in the early history of the State are, that the R\u00e1j\u00e1s were in a state of chronic feud with all the neighbouring countries except Cachar, and that Siva-worship took early root and spread rapidly through the country. The worship of the All-destroyer was here, as elsewhere in India, associated with the practice of human sacrifice. Tipperah became one of the greatest strongholds of this worship, and in no part of India were more victims offered up. It is said that till the reign of Dharma M\u00e1nik (1407\u20131439), the number of victims was 1000 a year; but Dharma ruled that human sacrifices should only be offered triennially. This Dharma M\u00e1nik appears to have been an enlightened prince; and it was under his patronage that the first part of the R\u00e1jmdl\u00e1 was composed.\n\nIt is impossible to define the limits at any given period of the ancient kingdom of Tipperah; but at various times its rule extended from the Sundarbans in the west to Burma in the east, and north as far as K\u00e1mrup. The military prestige of the Tipperah R\u00e1j\u00e1s was at its height during the 16th century, when R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sri Dhanya invaded with success the countries on every side of his native kingdom. Early in that century (1512), the Tipperah general conquered Chittagong, and defeated the Gaur troops who defended it. A strong Mughal force sent from Bengal into the R\u00e1j\u00e1's territory was compelled to retreat, and a second expedition was not more successful; and it was not until the beginning of the 17th century that the Mughals obtained any footing in the country. About 1620, however, in the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, a Mughal force under Naw\u00e1b Fateh Jang invaded Tipperah, ostensibly with the object of procuring horses and elephants. The capital (Udai-pur) was taken, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 sent prisoner to Delhi. He was offered his throne again on condition of paying tribute, but refused. Meanwhile, the Mughal troops continued to occupy the country in military fashion, until, after two and a half years, they were compelled by an epidemic to retire. The Delhi Emperor reiterated his demand for tribute when Kaly\u00e1n M\u00e1nik was raised to the throne in 1625, and attempted to enforce his claim through the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, who\nagain invaded the country, but was defeated. Subsequently, by dint of constant invasions and intrigues, the Muhammedans gradually established themselves in Tipperah. They appear, however, only to have occupied the lowlands, while the hilly tracts remained in the possession of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, but subject to the control of, and tributary to, the Naw\u00e1b. When the East India Company obtained the diw\u00e2ni of Bengal in 1765, so much of Tipperah as had been placed on the rent-roll came under British rule. (See Tipperah District.)\n\nThe English placed a R\u00e1j\u00e1 on the gaddi of the State; and since 1808, each successive ruler has received investiture from the Government, and has been required to pay the usual nasar or fine on accession. From 1826 to 1862, the eastern frontier was constantly disturbed by Kuk\u00ed raids, in which villages were burned and plundered, and the peaceful inhabitants massacred. What went on in Hill Tipperah no one knew; but vague rumours reached the British authorities of attacks on the R\u00e1j\u00e1's villages by the wild Kuk\u00eds, and of attacks on the Kuk\u00ed tribes by the R\u00e1j\u00e1's people. An account of the Lush\u00e1i (Kuk\u00ed) raids of 1860 and 1870, and of the means taken to punish the offenders, will be found in the articles on the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Tipperah District. The Sepoys of the 34th Native Infantry, who mutinied at Chittagong Town on the night of the 18th November 1857, after plundering the treasury, marched to Agartal\u00e1, the capital of Hill Tipperah. The small military force at the R\u00e1j\u00e1's disposal did not enable him to oppose the collective body of Sepoys, but orders were issued for the arrest and delivery to the British authorities of all mutineers found wandering within the limits of the State.\n\nThe State has a chronological era of its own, adopted by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bir-r\u00e1j, from whom the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 is 92nd in descent. Bir-r\u00e1j is said to have extended his conquests across the Ganges; and, in commemoration of that event, to have established a new era dating from his victory. The year 1883 corresponded with 1293 of the Tipperah era.\n\nPolitical Constitution, etc.\u2014Both as regards its constitution and its relations with the British Government, the State of Hill Tipperah differs alike from the Independent Native States of India and from those which are tributary and dependent. Besides being the ruler of Hill Tipperah, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 also holds a large samind\u00e2ri called ch\u00e2kli Roshn\u00e1b\u00e1d, situated in the plains of the District of Tipperah. This estate, which covers 589 square miles, is by far the most valuable portion of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's possessions, and yields a larger revenue than the whole of his kingdom of Hill Tipperah. It is held to form with the State an indivisible r\u00e1j; and consequently, whenever the succession is disputed, the question is decided by the British Courts of law,\nwhose judgment with regard to the zamindari has hitherto been always accepted as deciding also the right to the throne. Disputes as to the right of succession have occurred on the occasion of almost every vacancy in the r\u00e1j, producing disturbances and domestic wars, and exposing the inhabitants of the hills to serious disorders and to attacks from Kuk\u00eds, who are always called in as auxiliaries by one or other of the contending parties. The cause of these disputes is the rule of succession, the origin of which is lost in obscurity. The rule itself is thus described:\u2014\u2018A reigning R\u00e1j\u00e1 has the power of nominating any male member of the royal family, within certain limits, as his successor, under the title of Jubar\u00e1j; and also a successor to the Jubar\u00e1j, under the title of Bara Th\u00e1kur. On the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s death, the Jubar\u00e1j becomes R\u00e1j\u00e1, and the Bara Th\u00e1kur becomes Jubar\u00e1j, the latter in his turn succeeding as R\u00e1j\u00e1 even to the exclusion of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s natural heirs. It is, however, open to the reigning R\u00e1j\u00e1 to appoint his natural heirs to these dignities when unappropriated; and when no appointments have been made, the eldest son succeeds as a matter of course. Thus a Jubar\u00e1j, who becomes R\u00e1j\u00e1, has no power to pass over the Bara Th\u00e1kur appointed by his predecessor. That Bara Th\u00e1kur becomes Jubar\u00e1j, and subsequently, if he lives, R\u00e1j\u00e1. The reigning R\u00e1j\u00e1, however, has the option of appointing a successor to the new Jubar\u00e1j, whom he (the Jubar\u00e1j) in his turn cannot set aside.\u2019\n\nThe form of government is despotic and patriarchal. The R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s word is law and final, and his permission is required in numberless contingencies, great and small. The pay of the officials is generally nominal. Some of them are connected with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 by marriage, or otherwise. Certain offices are hereditary, but they cannot be appropriated without the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s permission. In 1871, an English officer was first appointed as Political Agent to protect British interests and advise the R\u00e1j\u00e1; but in 1878, a separate Political Agent being found unnecessary, the Magistrate of the adjoining District of Tipperah was appointed ex officio Political Agent of Hill Tipperah; and a native Deputy Magistrate of Bengal was stationed at Agart\u00e1l\u00e1 as Assistant Political Agent, who has done much to improve the administration of the State. There is no treaty between the British Government and the ruler of Hill Tipperah; but the R\u00e1j\u00e1s pay a fine or succession duty to the Government.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No regular Census was taken in this State prior to 1881. According to an estimate made in 1874\u201375, the total population in that year was 74,242, namely, hill population, 47,523; and population of the plains, 26,719. By the Census of 1881, the population of the State was ascertained to be 95,637, namely, males 51,458, and females 44,179; average density of population, 24\u00b74 per square mile. The population of the hills numbered 49,915, and of the plains 45,722.\nThe most important tribe is that of the Tipperahs, who in 1881 numbered 35,257. They are divided into three classes\u2014the pure or old Tipperahs, the class to which the reigning family belongs; the J\u00e1m\u00e1ity\u00e1s, or fighting caste; and the Noyatti\u00e1s, or new Tipperahs. Except the J\u00e1m\u00e1ity\u00e1s, each of these classes is sub-divided into several castes. They are all of the same religion, and speak the same language, differing only in minor local peculiarities. Their divinities are the gods of fire and water, of the forest and the earth; and sacrifices form an important part of their religion\u2014buffaloes, pigs, goats, and fowls being the animals ordinarily used for the purpose. At the present day they are showing some symptoms of a tendency to conform in many respects to the religious observances of the Hindus, especially with regard to caste. They are superstitious and timid, but capable of committing great cruelties when their passions are roused. The Political Agent, writing in 1873 of the tribe of Tipperahs, thus describes the result of their contact with the Beng\u00e1l\u00eds:\u2014'The people were very simple, truthful, and honest, until corrupted by the evil influences arising from closer intercourse with the inhabitants of the plains, and also by bad government. . . . Every advantage was taken of their ignorance and credulity, till at length they perceived this themselves, and they now no longer hesitate to meet deceit with its own weapons.' An account of the interesting and peculiar social customs of this tribe, given by Captain Lewin in his work on the Hill Tracts of Chittagong, is quoted in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. vi. pp. 482-488. The other tribes met with in the hills are\u2014the Riangs and Hallams, 11,688; Kuk\u00eds, 2733; Ch\u00e1km\u00e1s, 211; and Khas\u00eds, 26. The population in the plains is made up of 9779 Beng\u00e1l\u00ed Hindus, 26,951 Beng\u00e1l\u00ed Muhammadans, 113 Beng\u00e1l\u00ed Christians, 8813 Manipur\u00eds, and 66 Assamese.\n\nThere are no towns, properly so called, in Hill Tipperah. Agartala, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, is merely a moderate-sized village, situated on the north bank of the H\u00e1ora, about 40 miles from Comillah (Kumill\u00e1), the chief town of Tipperah District. The population of Agartal\u00e1 in 1881 was 2141. The administration of the State is conducted from Agartal\u00e1; and at the villages of Kail\u00e1shahr and Sonamuna officers are posted having jurisdiction over certain fixed portions of the State, known as the Sub-divisions of Kail\u00e1shahr and Udaipur. Old Agartal\u00e1, 4 miles east of the present capital, and until 1844 the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, contains several monuments to the memory of former rulers; and a small but very sacred temple, in which are kept fourteen heads of gold and other metals, supposed to represent the tutelary gods of the Tipperahs. Old Udaipur, on the Gu\u00fant\u00ed, the ancient capital of Udai M\u00e1nik, who reigned over the State in the latter half of the 16th century, also contains several\ninteresting ruins, which are, however, rapidly becoming overgrown with jungle.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The principal crop and main food staple is rice, of which 14 kinds are cultivated in the plains, and 8 kinds in the hills. Plough cultivation is limited to a narrow strip of land lying along the boundary which divides the State from the adjoining British Districts, and to patches of land in the interior. All the hill tribes cultivate on the *jum* system, a description of which will be found in the article on the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The crops grown on the *jums* are rice, cotton, chillies, and vegetables; the Manipuris inhabiting the low lands under the hills raise a little tobacco for their own use. Tea is not cultivated anywhere, though the plant is said to be indigenous to some parts of the hills. The portion of the State under cultivation forms a very small proportion of the total area. Within recent years the rate of wages has much increased. Agricultural labourers, who a few years ago earned 3d. a day, now receive 4\u00bdd.; smiths and carpenters, who formerly received from 4\u00bdd. to 6d., now get 7\u00bdd. or 8d. a day. The average price of common rice during the ten years ending 1881\u201382 was 4s. 6d. per cwt.; the highest price reached during the famine of 1866 was 12s. 3d. The rent paid for rice lands varies from 1s. 3d. to 8s. 9d. per acre, according to the position of the land.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.**\u2014The principal exports of the State are cotton, timber, *til*, bamboo, canes, thatching-grass, and firewood. The food crops are scarcely more than sufficient for local wants, and the export is very small. Occasionally, indeed, small imports are required from the neighbouring Districts of Tipperah, Sylhet, and Chittagong. A duty on cotton is levied by the State, and the right to levy a tax on forest produce is leased out annually; the amount of cotton exported in 1881\u201382 was estimated at 1600 tons. There are 21 markets, five held at places in the hills, and all frequented by hill tribes. The only manufacture is cloth of the coarsest quality, and there are but few roads.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The political constitution of the State has been already described. The most important sources of revenue are\u2014(1) the rent of lands in the plains of Hill Tipperah; (2) a family tax in the hills; (3) duties on cotton, forest products, and *til*; and (4) the sale of elephants captured in the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s territory. The revenue from the first of these sources in 1881\u201382 was \u00a33472; the family tax yielded \u00a31799; duties on exports, \u00a315,394; and the royalty on elephants captured, \u00a3529. The total revenue derived from Hill Tipperah in that year was \u00a323,779. Besides this, the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s private estates in the Districts of Tipperah and Sylhet yield about \u00a350,000 and \u00a31500 respectively. His total annual income, therefore, is about \u00a375,000. Until 1873, the administration of justice in Hill Tipperah was very defective, there\nbeing no regular procedure and no supervision by the higher courts over the lower. In that year, however, a few simple enactments were passed. The police force in 1881-82 consisted of 110 men of all ranks, in addition to a military force of 306 officers and men. The number of criminal cases instituted in 1881-82 was 517, of which 216 were dismissed or compromised. There are three jails in the State, at Agartal\u00e1, Kail\u00e1shahr, and Son\u00e1mun\u00e1; the average daily number of prisoners in 1881-82 was 40. The State maintains 27 schools; and out of a population of 95,637, only 575 boys and 34 girls were under education in 1881. Steps are now being taken to introduce the p\u00e1th-s\u00e1la system among the hill people, but they appear to have no desire for such innovations.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Hill Tipperah is said to be generally pleasant. The annual rainfall is about 80 inches. The chief endemic diseases are bowel complaints, remittent and intermittent fevers, and rheumatism; the principal epidemic is cholera. There is a hospital at Agartal\u00e1, and a dispensary at Kail\u00e1shahr.\n\nHils\u00e1.\u2014Town and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1nd) in Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal.

The Em\u00f3dus of Ptolemy, they extend continuously, in shape something like a scimitar with its blade facing south, for a distance of 1500 miles along the northern frontier of India, from the gorge where the Dihong (the connecting river link between the Sanpo (Ts\u00e1n-pu) of Tibet and the Brahmaputra of Assam) bursts through their main axis, to where the Indus, having reached its northernmost latitude, turns and pierces through the same mountains to enter on its southerly course towards the Arabian Sea. It is clear, however, even from the imperfect indications which we possess of this great range in its eastern extremity, that the true axis can be traced for some little distance eastward of the Dihong. The Eastern Him\u00e1layas eventually merge in the mountain system which runs southward into Burma, and eastward towards the extensive ranges of China. The western ranges of the Him\u00e1layas have been supposed by some to curve round and extend into the basin of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. But with this quasi-prolongation of the mountain chain we are not concerned, its true connection with the main mass being as yet a matter of extreme uncertainty.\n\nThe Him\u00e1layas form one of the chief ranges of Asia, and with the Kuen Luen converge westward towards the Pamir table-land,\nthat mountainous knot whence the Tian-shan and the Hindu Kush also radiate. With the Kuen Luen the Him\u00e1layas have a closer connection, as these two mighty ranges form respectively the northern and southern escarpment of the lofty Tibetan plateau. Owing, however, to the plentiful rainfall on the southern slopes of the Him\u00e1layas, to which the rain-clouds are swept direct from the sea, the river system formed thereby is incomparably more extensive than that of the Kuen Luen range. This may account for the serrated character of the Him\u00e1layas as contrasted with the sheer wall-like face of the Kuen Luen. A similar feature may be observed in the gorges and indented nature of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n chain, which buttresses the Iranian plateau on the western frontier of India; while the analogy is carried still further by the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n being characterised by a triple series of ranges, two of which are pierced by streams rising on the watershed of the inmost range (just as in the case of the Indus, Sutlej (Satlaj), and Brahmaputra); and lastly, by the fact that the Him\u00e1layas and Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n belong to approximately the same geological age, both, as is proved by their structure, being of comparatively recent (middle and later tertiary) date. The Him\u00e1layas themselves are but portion of a great chain of mountains. The rest of the chain is composed of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges. From one or other side of this chain flow all the great rivers of Asia. From or through the southern slope of the Him\u00e1layas flow the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra.\n\nA more striking analogy exists between the Him\u00e1layas and the Andes. This analogy was first perceived by Warren Hastings, and reference is made to it in his instructions to his envoy, Mr. George Bogle. The Andes and the Him\u00e1layas alike consist of three parallel chains. The Cuesta of La Raya, separating the valley of the Vilcamayu from the basin of Titicaca, is the counterpart of the Mariam-la saddle dividing the Sutlej and Brahmaputra basins. In both systems numerous streams rise in the central cordillera, and, after lateral courses between the two, eventually force their way through the outer chain. The Southern Him\u00e1layas bear a close analogy to the outer Andes rising from the valley of the Amazon. Both have a low range at their feet enclosing valleys or d\u00eduns; both have deep gorges separated by lofty ridges, which are spurs from a main chain of culminating snowy peaks; and in both, the rivers which rise in the inner central range force their way through profound ravines between the culminating summits. In both Peru and Tibet, too, the staple produce is wool, which is carried across the huge mountainous barrier bounding either country, by llamas and sheep respectively.\n\nThe Himalayan system has formed the subject of many treatises, in which attempts have been made to explain the physical structure of the whole mountainous mass. Foremost among them may be mentioned\nthe writings of Captain Herbert, Mr. Brian Houghton Hodgson, Major Cunningham, Captain Henry Strachey, Dr. T. Thomson, Dr. J. D. Hooker, Mr. Drew, Mr. Clements Markham, and Baron von Richthofen. The writings of Mr. B. H. Hodgson endeavoured to establish among other things the 'oceanic' theory. The oceanic theory represents the Him\u00e1layas as the base of an ancient ocean, of which the bed was long ago the Indian plains. The earliest of the authorities, however, laboured under the disadvantage of having at their disposal but scanty data for generalization; and although, even at present, the Him\u00e1layas are most imperfectly known, our knowledge of them has been greatly extended of late years, particularly by the Indian native explorers at detached points in the eastern half, and by the more exhaustive labours of topographical and geological surveyors in the north-western portion. The late Mr. Andrew Wilson, who explored the range in 1881, has well described its characteristics from the standpoint of an untechnical traveller.\n\nThe Northern Chain.\u2014The most comprehensive view of the system represents it as composed of three chains, to which the names of Northern, Central, and Southern are applied. The Northern chain is naturally divided into a western and an eastern section, the western being known as the Karakoram or Muztagh, forming, speaking broadly, the water-parting (though not a completely uninterrupted one) between the basins of Lob-Nor and the Indus. It is the circumstance of the culminating chain not being wholly coincident with the line of water-parting which led the late Mr. Shaw, with much force, to plead for the substitution of the appellation of Muztagh to that of Karakoram for this portion of the Northern range. The Karakoram Pass is undoubtedly a point on the real line of water-parting; the streams north of it join the Tarim basin, while those on its southern slope discharge into the Indus. But the true culminating range lies south of it, and is pierced by the last-named tributaries. It is this, combined with the singular applicability of the name Muztagh, 'Ice Mountain,' to a line of mountains which is crowned by the most stupendous glaciers of the world, outside the Arctic regions, which lends reason to Mr. Shaw's proposal. The peaks along this section of the Him\u00e1layas frequently attain a height of 25,000 feet, and the chief one (which is as yet unnamed, but is distinguished by the sign 'K 2' in the records of the Great Trigonometrical Survey) is 28,265 feet high, being second in altitude only to Mount Everest. The best known passes across this section of the range, which may be said broadly to extend from its junction with the Hindu Kush near the Baroghil Pass to Mount K\u00e1ilas near Lake M\u00e1anasarowar in Tibet, are the Karakoram and the Changchenmo, exceeding 18,000 and 19,000 feet respectively in height. But besides these, there are a variety of minor passes, such as the Karambar, the Muztagh, and especially a pass on the road between Rudok and\nKiria, which deserve fuller examination. The southern slopes of the Muztagh range in its northern portion are clothed with enormous glaciers, one of which, sketched by Colonel Godwin Austen (whose remarkable surveys in these regions have formed the basis of our topographical knowledge), attained the length of 35 miles. From these glaciers issue streams which, flowing south between bare craggy mountains, join the Indus or its tributary the Shayok. The collective name applied to the various Districts which comprise the valleys of the Indus, Basha, Braldu, Shigar, Shayok, etc., is Baltist\u00e1n. The inhabitants are Muhammadanized Tibetans of Turanian stock, with the exception of a small section who are Dards. The northern face of the Muztagh range is but little known.\n\nAs regards the southern portion of this section of the Northern range, information is extremely scanty. Between the Changchenmo Pass and Mount Kail\u00e1s, it has been crossed at rare intervals by the native explorers of the Indian Survey; but anything like a complete survey is impossible, owing to the jealousy and exclusive character of the Tibeto-Chinese policy. The southern slopes give birth to the rivers Indus and Sutlej, which both break through the central and southern ranges in their course towards the sea.\n\nTo the east of Lake M\u00e1\u00f1asarowar a saddle, surmounted by the Mariam-la Pass, connects the Northern and Central ranges. On its eastern side rises the Sanpo (Ts\u00e1n-pu) or Brahmaputra, of which the Northern range forms the northern watershed as far as to the south of the Sky-Lake (Tengri-Nur in Mongolian, and Nam-Cho in Tibetan). Hence it appears to curve round the lake in a north-easterly direction for 150 miles, after which its further course is unknown. This eastern section of the range is called Ninjin-thangla or Nyenchhen-tangla by the native explorer and Mr. Brian Hodgson respectively; Baron von Richthofen, on the other hand, has named it Tang-la, and detaches it from the Him\u00e1layas, treating it instead as a portion of the Chinese system. The existence of this entire portion of the Northern range has been clearly demonstrated by the journeys of Pundit Nain Singh, and of the young Tibetan explorer who discovered Lake Tengri-Nur in 1872. The northern watershed drains into a system of inland lakes, which appear to constitute a connected chain, and which there is reason to believe has its outlet in either the Salw\u00edn or Mekong river. The southern face is the northern watershed of the Sanpo or Brahmaputra.\n\nBetween the Northern and Central ranges, there runs an important though subsidiary chain from Mount Kail\u00e1s near Lake M\u00e1\u00f1asarowar to the junction of the Indus and the Shayok. According to Cunningham, who calls it the Kail\u00e1s or Gangri range, this chain is 550 miles in length. Its peaks average between 16,000 and 20,000 feet in height;\nand it is crossed in its northern portion by a number of passes, which lead from the valley of the Indus into that of the Shayok. About $33^\\circ$ $12'$ N. lat., it is pierced by the Indus itself, which deviates at right angles and cuts right through this granite range to resume a north-westerly course beyond. The southern portion of this range lies in Tibetan territory, and is but little known, but it has been crossed at four points by native explorers.\n\nThe Central Chain, according to present knowledge, appears in its eastern portion to coincide pretty closely with the zone of 'central gneiss,' the geological main axis of the Him\u00e1layas. This great range has its commencement in the conspicuous peak Nanga Parbat, 'Naked Mountain,' 26,629 feet high, which towers conspicuously on the extreme verge of the Kashmir frontier, above the Indus valley, not far from the place where the river enters upon its course through a belt of independent territory, before rejoining the British frontier above Darband. This lofty mountain has been seen by General Cunningham from R\u00e1mnagar in the Punjab, a distance of 205 miles. Tracing the Central chain from this point towards the south-east, we find that for the first 50 or 60 miles the chain, which here forms the water-parting between the Indus and the Jehlam (Jhelum), is not of such a height as to bear perpetual snow or give origin to glaciers. Two frequented roads, joining the Kishanganga and Astor rivers, go over passes of upwards of 13,000 feet, and others lead into the Dras valley. At the point where the Dras Pass (11,300 feet) affords access from the Kashmir valley to the high table-land of Ladakh, a minor range branches off and separates successively the Sind valley, the northern part of the vale of Kashmir, and the Jehlam valley, on the south, from the Kishangang\u00e1 on the north. A little south of the same pass, another ridge branches off, and, running north and south, forms the eastern boundary of the vale, till near Banihal it joins itself to the Pir Panjal range, which in its turn runs east and west for about 30 miles, then turns north-north-west and continues for some 40 miles more till it dies off towards the valley of the Jehlam. This range completes the mountainous girdle which encircles the valley of Kashmir.\n\nTo return to the Central range itself. About the vicinity of the Dras Pass, the mountain range increases in height, and the peaks are high enough to form glaciers; two of them, Nun and Kun, each over 23,000 feet in height, being conspicuous. The north-eastern slope of the range drains into the Indus; the Suru and Zanskar being the chief rivers. The latter flows through a peculiarly inaccessible district called by the same name as its chief river. The shape of the valley is roughly that of a capital T, the upper portion of which runs parallel to the main axis of the range. A little farther to the south, the\nBara Lacha Pass (16,200 feet) affords a route from L\u00e1hul and K\u00e1ngra to Leh.\n\nProceeding farther to the south-east, the Central range is broken by the gloomy precipitous gorge of the Sutlej (the classic Hesudrus), which, rising in the holy lakes of Rakas Tal and M\u00e1nasarowar, on the southern side of the Tibetan Kail\u00e1s, takes a north-westerly course for 280 miles, till, swelled by the waters of the Spiti river, it turns and cleaves through the two outer ranges, emerging on the plains of India at Ropar, after a course of 560 miles. The junction of the Sutlej and Spiti rivers is marked by a magnificent peak 22,183 feet high, entitled Lio Porgyul, which rises sheer from the edge of the two streams 13,000 feet below its summit. Farther to the south-east there are numerous passes leading from British territory over the Central range into Hundes, among which the Niti Pass (16,676 feet) claims notice, as the route leading across it to Khotan, by way of Totling, Gartokh, Rudokh, Noh, and Kiria, is the best and easiest route between Eastern Turkist\u00e1n and India. Four passes lead through the line of snowy peaks which form the barriers of Tibet. The passes are the Nilang, the M\u00e1na, the Milam, and the Lanpiya-dh\u00fara. The Tibetan authorities are excessively jealous of foreign intrusion, and admission to Tibet is not only very difficult, but sometimes dangerous.\n\nEastward, the knowledge available about the Central range is very fragmentary, as it lies wholly beyond the British frontier, and the interval is occupied by the Native States of Nep\u00e1l, Sikkim, and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. On its northern side the range is clothed with enormous glaciers, which drain into the Sanpo river; while its southern slopes give rise to many large rivers, which, bursting through the Southern chain, eventually discharge their waters into the Ganges or the Brahmaputra. Foremost among these is the Ganges itself, the source of which was determined by the Survey of Captain Raper and Lieutenant Webb to lie a few miles beyond Gangotri. Next should be mentioned the K\u00e1li, Karn\u00e1li, N\u00e1r\u00e1yani, Buri Gandak, Tirsuli Gandak, Bhutia Kosi, and Arun, all of which flow through Nep\u00e1l\u2014possibly some of the tributaries of the Man\u00e1s in Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, which would appear to be called Lhobra-chu in its upper course, and the Sikung Sanpo, which there is good reason to identify with the Subansiri. To the east of the Mariam-la Pass, only three Englishmen are said to have ever crossed the Central range,\u2014viz. Bogle, Turner, and Manning,\u2014and to have all crossed at the same point, where the Parnam-chu, which rises in two lakes situated between the two southern ranges, pierces through the Central range to join the Brahmaputra. Five of the native explorers are also known to have crossed the same range at different points, viz. Lagung-la, Dong-la, No-la, Fotu-la, and Karkang.\n\nFrom the Central range many lofty saddles branch forth, in some places\nforming inland lakes, in others directing the course of rivers either to the Sanpo or through the gorges of the Southern range. An imposing view of the long line of glaciers and peaks of the Central range was obtained by Dr. Hooker from the Dankia-la Pass in Sikkim. Two of the most remarkable of the inland lakes referred to are the Palti and Chomtong lakes. The former (14,700 feet above the sea) is about 20 miles long and 16 broad, without an outlet. This lake is situated north of the Arun basin, and, like the Palti Lake, is encircled by spurs from the Central range. The Palti or Yamdok-cho Lake is ring-shaped, and has appeared on all maps since D'Anville's time. It is supposed to be about 45 miles in circumference; the island in the centre rises into rounded hills from 2000 to 3000 feet high. The lake is said by all authorities to have no outlet; and both Manning and Klapproth (who accumulated much information respecting it) state that the waters are very bad; but Pandit Nain Singh, on the other hand, asserts that the waters are perfectly fresh. Eastward of this lake, and about the 92nd meridian of longitude, the Central range has been crossed by Nain Singh at the Karkang Pass (16,310 feet), whence the snowy peaks of the Northern and Southern chains, as well as those of the transverse ranges joining the latter, could be plainly descried. Beyond this, existing knowledge of the Central range does not at present extend.\n\nThe Southern Chain.\u2014In treating of the Southern chain of the Him\u00e1layas, it is convenient to observe that both Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Drew, who are the best authorities on the subject of this range, in its eastern and western sections, agree in ascribing to it a three-fold character. Mr. Drew calls these zones the Outer Hills and the Middle and Higher Mountains; Mr. Hodgson, the Lower, Central, and Upper regions. But the respective characteristics are the same in both sections, although local circumstances and the greater humidity towards the east beget apparent divergence.\n\nThe origin of the Southern range at its north-western extremity is not yet fixed with precision, but it appears to spring from the southernmost point of the Pir Panjal range, with which it is undoubtedly connected in a geographical sense. At its outset it is pierced by the waters of the Chen\u00e1b, the main stream of which rises in L\u00e1hul, far to the south-east, under the name of Chandra-bhaga, and for 180 miles drains the south-western and north-eastern slopes of the Central and Southern ranges respectively. The peaks of the latter gradually increase in height, from 1300 to 20,000 feet; and its outer slopes are washed by the Rav\u00ed and Beas, the feeders of which rise on the southern side of the culminating ridge. Passing the Sutlej, the road up the gorge of which is connected with Simla by the so-called Great Hindust\u00e1n and Tibet Road, we note the Bh\u00e1gir\u00e1th\u00ed, Alaknand\u00e1, and a variety of rivers already\nreferred to, which rise in the interval between the two southern ranges, and flow through ravines and gorges in the Southern range on their way to join the Ganges and Brahmaputra; while minor streams which rise on the southern face complete the copious hydrography of the region. A detailed enumeration of these would be unnecessary; but it is desirable, in connection with this physical feature of the Himalayas, to note the theory held by Mr. Hodgson, but rejected by some later geographers. Mr. Hodgson and others have contended that the succession of stupendous peaks found in the Southern Himalayas do not form a chain, as they are separated, and their connecting ridge is broken by the numerous rivers which rise to the north. He argues, therefore, that these peaks form a series of culminating points of spurs jutting out from the Central range. On the other hand, it has been answered that this is not a question of fact but of nomenclature, and that the designation of chain is justified by the analogy of the chains or cordilleras of the Andes, which are pierced in a precisely similar manner, but to which no one denies the appellation in question.\n\nThe peaks of the Southern range constitute a series of the loftiest mountain summits in the known world. Their respective heights have been measured with the utmost exactitude by triangulation from the plains. Many of these exceed 25,000 feet above sea-level, and the highest, named Mount Everest after Sir George Everest, who was Surveyor-General of India from 1830 to 1843, is 29,002. It is believed to be the highest known mountain on the surface of the earth.\n\nPhysical Geography.\u2014For a sketch of the physical geography of the Himalayas, it is preferable to commence from the plains of India. The core or nucleus of all mountain masses is formed of crystalline rocks, while stratified rocks are largely found in the lower subordinate ranges. And it is as much so in the case of the Himalayas, as it is in the case of the Alps, the Pyrenees, or the Rocky Mountains. As already remarked, the Southern range of the Himalayas naturally falls into three divisions or regions, corresponding, as regards organic development, to the three zones of the earth\u2014tropical, temperate, and arctic. The aggregate breadth of these averages about 90 miles, and they gradually increase in height from the south, a factor which chiefly determines the climate, as for every thousand feet of height gained there is a diminution of 3 or 3\u00bd degrees of Fahrenheit. In the Punjab, the transition from the plains to the Outer Hills is marked by a belt of dry, porous ground, seamed by numerous gullies or ravines, from a hundred yards to a mile wide, partly covered with long, tufty jungle grass, which is frequented by the black buck or antelope. To the east, the Tardi, or submontane tract, occupies the same position.\nThis is a belt of slowly sloping, waste, marshy ground, a fever-stricken region of varying breadth, lying below the level of the plains. The tract affords pasture to innumerable herds of cows and buffaloes. Beyond lies a dry belt of more rapidly sloping ground than the Tardi, called Bh\u00e1bar, chiefly of a gravelly and sandy nature, and overgrown with a splendid growth of the valuable timber tree called s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta). Next intervenes the fossiliferous sandstone range (Siwaliks), which does not rise more than three to six hundred feet above its immediate base, but which almost uniformly edges the Him\u00e1layas from the Jehlam to Upper Assam. The space between these and the slope of the Him\u00e1layas themselves is occupied by the d\u00fans, called mar\u00eds (in Nep\u00e1l), and dw\u00e1rs (in Bh\u00fat\u00e1n)\u2014longitudinal valleys of rising ground, either cultivated or yielding a plentiful forest growth.\n\nFlora and Fauna.\u2014The vegetation clothing this region consists of s\u00e1ls, sissus, acacias, mimosas, cotton-trees, etc.; the fauna, which to the east is abundant, includes the elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, deer, many birds, and numerous reptiles from the lizard to the python. In the western part of the middle region, forests of Him\u00e1layan oak, pine, spruce, silver fir, and deodar, occupy a great part of the mountain slopes, while other denizens of the temperate zones, in addition to tree rhododendra, tea allies, paper and wax trees, occur. The more sunny parts, where forest trees do not flourish (except where rocks jut out), are well covered with herbage, plants, and flowers, resembling those of Central or Southern Europe. The more noticeable among the animal types are bovine and caprine antelopes, sun bears (helarctos), leopards, and wild cats. The eastern part of the upper region is one of the superior conifers, though to the north-west these descend to a lower level, while the valleys of the highest regions are there occupied by a few fruit-trees, willows, and poplars. The cedars and deodars of the Him\u00e1layas attain magnificent proportions; in the Sutlej valley the former are sometimes 40 feet in girth and 200 feet in height. The chief representatives of the upper region among animals are the so-called bison (Bos gaurus), y\u00e1k or Tibetan ox, musk-deer, wild goat and sheep, bear, ounce, fox, pheasant, partridge, etc. Mr. Hodgson has remarked that, generally speaking, the zoology of the Him\u00e1layas is much wider in the multitude of its diverse forms (genera and species) than in individuals of the same form, and that it is remarkably allied to the zoology of the Malayan islands; but that as one proceeds northwards towards the snows, it approximates to European types.\n\nGeological Structure.\u2014Knowledge of the geology of the Him\u00e1layas is scanty; but, thanks to the Manual of the Geology of India, a better position with regard to it has been of recent years obtained. The information upon which to base a geological outline consists of Captain R.\nStrachey's account of part of Hundes, Stoliczka's observations on Western Tibet, and occasional reports by members of the Geological Survey in the Lower and Sub-Himalayan ranges, besides a few isolated observations. The site of the Himalayas, like the sites of the Alps and other mountain systems, is, in accordance with a fundamental principle of geology, believed to have at one time formed part of the bed of an ancient ocean. It is thought that originally our planet possessed an enormously high temperature; that it was thrown off from its parent sun with a temperature probably fiercer than that of the sun at present; and that since it was thrown off it has been gradually cooling and contracting. The external crust of the earth, varying in strength and structure, has yielded unequally to the strain of contraction; and one result is the formation of hills, ridges, and mountains. The mountain masses thus arise out of a sea which has gradually evaporated, leaving not only hills and mountains on its ancient surface, but a new surface of various marine deposits. There is, of course, no regularity in the results of this contracting process, and the Alps, for example, present features far different from those of the Himalayas. The Himalayas are less richly clothed than the Alps. But so far as is known, the Himalayas exhibit more regularity of structure than the Alps. Three zones of permanent significance can be indicated. On the south there is a continuous fringing belt of lower ridges, known as the sub-Himalayas, divided into the Siwalik and Sirmur (Sarmor) series, and composed of tertiary rocks. Between this marginal zone and the great snowy range there lies throughout the whole length of the Himalayas, to as far west as the Sutlej, a broad area some 50 miles wide, consisting of irregular ridges of average moderate elevation, from 5000 to 8000 feet, some ranging up to 12,000, all largely made up of crystalline metamorphic rocks, in obscure relation with some unaltered formations, the latter being for the most part of very uncertain age. This great area, characterised by extreme complexity of structure, is distinguished by Mr. Medlicott as the Lower Himalayan region; while he applies the term Central or Tibetan Division to the great snowy range, which is characterised by several parallel axes of gneissic rocks and intervening synclinal basins of little-altered fossiliferous formations.\n\nThe most favoured conclusion respecting the sub-Himalayas is that they were upraised in late tertiary times. The prevailing rocks are soft, massive sandstones, associated in variable proportions with conglomerates and clays. With the exception of two places on the Bhutan frontier where the marginal slopes of the plains reach to the base of the Lower Himalayan region, the fringe of tertiary rocks is, so far as is known, continuous from the Brahmaputra to the Jehlam. West of the Sutlej, where the Lower Himalayan area ends, there is an equivalent increase in the width of the sub-Himalayan zone. One of the gaps in\nthe tertiary zone occurs in front of the great gap between the Assam range and the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l Hills, through which all the Him\u00e1layan drainage passes on to the Bay of Bengal, but it is probable that the sandstones were once continuous across these gaps. Through Upper Assam the sub-Him\u00e1layan Hills recur in full force to the Brahmaputra gorge, where they bend round across the head of the Assam valley, and conform to a system of disturbance having a totally different direction from that of the Him\u00e1layas proper.\n\nOf the Lower Him\u00e1layas the geological information is very scanty. For 500 miles in Nep\u00e1l there are only notes on one short section in the middle, and east of this throughout the whole range only one narrow area has been examined\u2014in Sikkim. In the north-west most observations have been made, and here a continuous broad belt of unaltered limestones and shaly slates is found at the edge of the mountains, and at many points extending far into the interior. Eastwards it contracts, till on the Khatmandu section it has disappeared, and in Sikkim gneissic rocks come very close to the southern or main boundary. Thus from end to end of the range we have found two great rock series, a slaty and a gneissic. In the Simla region a strong case has been made out for very great unconformity between the two, showing the pal\u00e6ozoic rocks to have been deposited upon a very deeply and irregularly eroded surface of the old gneissic series; and structural features homologous to those of the Simla ground have been indicated in the east, so that should this relation of the two series be established throughout the range, a connection will have been made out between the Lower Him\u00e1layan region and a primitive gneissic mass forming a fundamental nucleus for the whole series of Him\u00e1layan formations.\n\nThe materials for a description of the Central or Tibetan Him\u00e1layas, which is the name applied by the authors of the Manual of the Geology of India to all the remaining portions of the Him\u00e1layan Mountains, are extremely limited. With the exception of Dr. Hooker, observers within the Tibetan frontier have confined themselves to the north-western portion of the range. Owing to the difficulty of traversing such rugged ground, information is deficient. From end to end of the partially known ground, two gneissic axes are more or less continuous. The southern of these is the Him\u00e1layan range proper, or Southern range of our geographical description, of which in Sikkim, and again west of Nep\u00e1l for 300 miles, gneiss is the predominant rock, many of the highest and most massive peaks being formed of it. The second gneissic axis runs parallel to the first, at a distance of 50 to 80 miles, separating the Indus from its tributary the Shayok, and has also been referred to above. Between these two gneissic axes there is a long synclinal basin, in which the fossiliferous rocks are found in more or less complete sequence; and north of the Lad\u00e1kh gneissic axis the\nsame sedimentary series comes in again, the area being a broad synclinal basin, the newest rocks being found in the centre of it in the Karakoram ridge, while the older formations rise again to the north against a third gneissic axis forming the core of the Kuen Luen range. As a single geological axis, the main Himalayan range may be said to end with the Lower Himalayan area in the Simla region, to the northwest of which there are three independent ranges with gneissic axis\u2014the Zanskar, Pir Panjal, and the Dhauladhar,\u2014each of which has some claim to be considered the continuation of the main range of the Middle Himalayas. The chief sedimentary basins in which fossiliferous formations occur are the two central basins of Zanskar and Hundes, the northern basin of the Karakoram, and the southern area of Kashmir and Pangi.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Most parts of the Himalayas are known to contain metallic ores, particularly iron, lead, and copper, and of the two former there is no deficiency in the mountains between the Sutlej and K\u00e2lf. Salt, borax, and gold are not unfrequent beyond the frontier. Gold is found in the streams of the Province of Kum\u00e2on, and is mined in Tibet. Traders chiefly use the gold or gold-dust which is extracted. In Tibet the gold mines are managed by a gold \u2018commissioner\u2019 who holds a triennial contract direct from Lhasa. Extracted from the mine in its pure state, and tied up in little bags, each containing about 90 grains, it forms the heavy currency of the region. Iron and copper are worked in Kum\u00e2on.\n\nEthnology.\u2014The region of the Himalayan Mountains forms the meeting-ground of the Aryan and the so-called Turanian races, the latter having in all probability invaded India at the innumerable points of access to be found along the mountain chain. The majority of the dwellers in the Himalayas up to the Tibetan frontier are Hindus. The two great stocks of Aryan and Turanian are in some places curiously intermingled, though generally distinguishable. To the extreme north-west are found the Dards, an Aryan race of mountaineers, abutting on the Path\u00e2ns or Afgh\u00e2ns on the west; and the Baltis, a race of Muhammadanized Tibetans of the Turanian stock, on the east. To this latter stock also belong the Champas, a race of hardy nomads wandering about the high level valleys of Rupshu, and the Lad\u00e2khis, a settled race, cultivating the valleys of their country. The other Aryan races are the Pah\u00e2ris or \u2018mountaineers,\u2019 the Kashmiris, and the Dogras and Chibhalis, who inhabit the Outer Hills. In Garhwal and Kum\u00e2on are found the Kanaw\u00e2rs (inhabitants of Bashahr); the Nilangs, people who differ in no respect from those of Hundes; and the inhabitants of the Bhutia Mah\u00e2ls of Kum\u00e2on and Garhwal, who are of mixed Tartar and Indian origin. In Nep\u00e1l, Sikkim, and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, the following tribes occur, proceeding from west to east:\u2014\nHIMALAYA MOUNTAINS.\n\n(1) The Cis-Him\u00e1layan Bhutias or Tibetans, (2) the Sunwar, (3) Gurung, (4) Magar, (5) Murni, (6) Nawar, (7) Kiranti, (8) Limbu, (9) Lepcha, who inhabit Sikkim, and (10) the Bh\u00fat\u00e1nese or Lhopa. Of these, full ethnological details will be found in Mr. Hodgson\u2019s exhaustive essays; but the subject is too large a one to receive more than a passing allusion here. Mr. Hodgson\u2019s long-continued researches in Nep\u00e1l are the foundation of our knowledge alike of the natural history and the ethnology of the Him\u00e1layas. His essays, drawings, and scientific collections form, perhaps, the most wonderful memorial of intellectual activity which any Indian civilian has left behind.\n\nLittle is certainly known concerning the history, the domestic character and habits, or the political civilisation of the inhabitants of the Him\u00e1layas. Mr. Andrew Wilson, a tourist rather than an explorer, has noted their \u2018dingy-coloured, flat-roofed hamlets,\u2019 and the Lama monasteries, seen upon occasional heights, but more frequently catching the eye of the traveller as he penetrates towards the Buddhist country of Tibet. With these monasteries the current history and tradition of the people deal; while the exclamation, perpetually used in the most trifling daily affairs, of the Buddhist phrase, \u2018Om mani pad me haun\u2019\u2014lit. \u2018O God, the jewel in the lotus; Amen,\u2019 but used as a prayer for the wellbeing of six classes of living things\u2014points to the simple piety of a race springing naturally from the virtues of patience, honesty, and placidity of temper which travellers have agreed in assigning to them. The beasts of burden used for all purposes are the long-backed, shaggy-haired, and savage-looking y\u00e1k or grunting ox of Tibet, which after death supplies in its white tail an article of commerce. Polyandry is much practised, especially in, and on the confines of, Tibet, where it is not an unusual thing to find six brothers sharing one wife among them, yet maintaining for years the happiest relations. The European traveller in the Him\u00e1layas is said not to be the source of awe to the hardy people of the hills that he is often to the inhabitants of more level regions. Starting at Simla or Mas\u00fari (Mussoorie), he may engage his beg\u00e1ris, or porters, and determine to press on; but at Shipki, or some other Tibetan post, he will find himself prevented, if necessary, by force, from further progress. The traveller who goes even as far as Shipki will have to meet natural obstacles, such as glaciers, avalanches, torrents bridged by swinging ropes and little more, the merest tracks for ponies, muddy water, and the other inconveniences and hindrances to be encountered in any secluded mountain region.

Area, 312 square miles, with 197 villages and 5261 houses. Population (1872) 28,025; (1881) 33,802, namely, males 16,987, and females 16,815. Classified according to religion, there were in 1882\u2014Hindus, 31,637, or 93.6 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 853, or 2.5 per cent.; Christians, 4; and 'others,' or non-Hindu aborigines, 1308, or 3.88 per cent. Average density of population, 108 per square mile; villages per square mile, .63; persons per village, 171; houses per square mile, 17.4; persons per house, 6.4. The aboriginal tribes, many of whom are returned as Hindus by religion, are almost entirely Ta\u00e1l\u00e1s and Kandhs. The most numerous Hindu castes are\u2014Ch\u00e1s\u00e1s, Br\u00e1hmans, and Khand\u00e1\u00edts. The Cuttack and Sambalpur high-road runs through the State in a south-easterly direction, and small quantities of country produce are thus brought to the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed, and there sold to travelling merchants. No fairs or markets are held, and only the following 10 villages are returned as containing upwards of 100 houses\u2014viz. Karinda, 216 houses; Rasoli, 194 houses; Ranjagol, 165 houses; Did\u00e1rkot, 158 houses; Nuachaini, 149 houses; Kalinga, 140 houses; Chitalpur, 129 houses; Pora, 112 houses; Gualipal, 110 houses; and Rasoli-patn\u00e1, 102 houses. Hindol consisted originally of 3 or 4 petty States, completely buried in jungle, and ruled by separate chiefs, till two Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 brothers, belonging to the family of the Kimidi R\u00e1j\u00e1 in Madras, drove them out and formed their territories into one principality. The present chief (1883) is 26th in descent from the original founder. He maintains a military force of 83 men, and a police force 133 strong. His estimated annual revenue is returned at \u00a32089; tribute, \u00a355. A post-office has been recently established at Rasoli village.\n\n**Hindoli.\u2014** Town in Bundi State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) under 5000. The town, occupying a picturesque position at the base of some low hills, contains the S\u00e1ndoli Palace, built by Partab Singh in 1706, and an artificial lake one square mile in area.\n\n**Hindri (Indaravati, colloquially Handri, hence Hindri).\u2014** River in Madras Presidency, an affluent of the Tungabhadra. It rises in the village of Maddikerra, Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, and, after a course of 90 miles, joins the Tungabhadra near the town of Karn\u00fal, in lat. 15\u00b0 50' N., and long. 78\u00b0 9' E. During a great portion of the year\nthe stream is small; but owing to the heavy drainage from the neighbouring hills, it is liable to sudden floods, which render it temporarily unfordable. It is never navigable even by the smallest boats. Its waters are used for irrigation by moths, but there are no anicuts or systematic dams across its course. The S\u00fantesala Canal of the Madras Irrigation Company is carried across the bed of the Hindri at Karn\u00fal town by a large aqueduct containing fourteen arches of 40 feet span.\n\n**Hindu Kush** ('Mountains of the Moon').\u2014Range of mountains in Asia, stretching from the P\u00e1mir table-land into north-eastern Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. The Hindu Kush range commences at the south-west corner of the P\u00e1mir table-land in Central Asia, in long. 73\u00b0 30' N. In or near this region are the sources of the Oxus, the Y\u00e1rkhand Daria, the Kun\u00e1r, and the Gilgit rivers. The range is a westward continuation of the Him\u00e1layas, from which it is separated by the gorge of the Indus river. The Hindu Kush extends west as far as the spur which divides the Ghorband valley from that of the river Helmand, in long. 68\u00b0 30', whence it continues west under the name of Koh-i-Baba. Within these limits its breadth, including the ramifications of the main range, is nearly 200 miles. The main range throws out four chief spurs or ridges. The Agr\u00e1m pass is the starting-point of the Badakhsh\u00e1n ridge which divides the basin of the Oxus from the basin of the Kokcha. East of the Kh\u00e1wak pass a spur running north and diverging north-east and north-west divides the basin of Kokcha from the basin of the Kunduz. This may be called the Kokcha ridge. From the Kh\u00e1wak pass also a branch goes north-west to Kunduz, where it ends. This branch may be called the Kunduz ridge. Lastly, from the Kh\u00e1wak pass a fourth spur is ended by the Kunduz river, and may be given the name of the Kh\u00e1wak ridge. These four ridges lie between the watershed of the Oxus and the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. South of the latter no spurs are thrown out until the country east of Kashk\u00e1r is reached, the main range up to this point draining directly into the Chitral river. The Kashk\u00e1r ridge runs south, draining into the Kun\u00e1r river; the ridge ends at the junction of the Kun\u00e1r and Chigharsar\u00e1i rivers. To the east of Derband a spur starts out as far as lat. 35\u00b0 20', where it splits into three fresh spurs, two of them ending at the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. The third of the subsidiary spurs divides the basin of the Al\u00edng\u00e1r from that of the Alishang, and may be called the K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n ridge. At the head of the valley of the Ghorband the Hindu Kush sends out a spur, the ramifications of which, under various names, stretch throughout eastern Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and eastern Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n to the Indus, and as far even as the sea at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed.\n\n**Passes.**\u2014The Hindu Kush is crossed by the following passes, going from east to west\u2014the Karambar or Ishkam\u00e1n, the Darkot, the Baroghil (at the eastern end of the range, elevation about 12,000 feet),\nthe Yur, the Vost, the Nuks\u00e1n, the Kharteza, the Dora, and in the extreme west of the main range the Bami\u00e1n or Irak Pass, a great trade route into India from Central Asia. These passes lead from Chitral into Wakh\u00e1n and Badakhsh\u00e1n. Of the K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n passes little is known. The Kh\u00e1w\u00e1k Pass (13,200 feet) is the most important of the routes between Badakhsh\u00e1n and K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n. From Deh-i-Parian in the Pangsher valley a pass leads by Anj\u00faman to Badakhsh\u00e1n. The other principal passes are\u2014the Thal, the Kh\u00e1w\u00e1k, the Baz\u00e1rak, the Shatpal, the Parw\u00e1n, the Sar\u00e1lang, the K\u00e1osh\u00e1n, the Gw\u00e1l\u00edan, the Gwazgar, the Ch\u00e1rdar, the Ghol\u00e1l\u00e1y, the Far\u00edngal, and the Ghorband. Most of the passes are not difficult. Some are practicable for k\u00e1filas or caravans of laden carts. On some, snow lies for but three months in the year. Others are covered by perpetual snow. These are impracticable for laden animals, but foot-passengers slide over and down them on leathern aprons.\n\n**Geology.**\u2014According to Lord, the geological structure of the range is a core of granite of beautiful appearance, the felspar purely white, the hornblende black and glossy. On each side of the granite are deep strata of slate, gneiss, chlorite, carbonate of lime, quartz; and, exterior to these, secondary limestone and fossiliferous sandstone. The range is thought to be rich in the precious metals. In winter the streams are shrunk to small dimensions; but in the summer torrents of water, let loose from their imprisonment among the glaciers, carry down tons of soil among their muddy waters. Many of the torrents are impregnated with gold deposits, and it is believed that a scientific search might be well repaid. Gold-washing is only carried on in winter, and by a small number of workers. The best gold found has been assayed at 20 carats fine.\n\n**Ethnology and Religion.**\u2014As in almost all parts of the mountain region of Central Asia, the inhabitants of the Hindu Kush are of mixed races, languages, and religions, and possess widely different political and domestic institutions. The valleys and gorges, many of them extremely fertile, contain the great majority of the inhabitants, but some of the cave-dwellings of the mountaineers called forth the admiration of Marco Polo. The communities in the valleys and gorges average from 200 to 4000 people, either following the caste system and ritual of an Indian village, or maintaining an attitude of independence and republicanism towards neighbouring tribes and races. The chief races have been roughly, and not without disagreement of opinion, called Dards and Shins, the latter being the original conquerors of the region. The chief tribes are\u2014the Kolis, Yeshkuns, Torwaliks, Doms, Afgh\u00e1ns, Bushkariks, Shi\u00e1h Posh (in the unknown country of K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n), N\u00edmchas, Chil\u00e1s\u00eds, Chitr\u00e1lis, Baltis, Brushas, and Brokpas. The terms Dard and Dard\u00edst\u00e1n have been applied by Dr. Leitner\nto several of these tribes and the valleys they inhabit. The name Shin is applied to the old Br\u00e1hmanical and Buddhistical dwellers of the country. The principal religion at the present time is an easy-going species of Muhammadanism, said to have been introduced in the course of the 14th century, and particularly noted by Marco Polo. In a few places, notably W\u00e1kh\u00e1n, the worship of fire is supposed to have been practised; and in W\u00e1kh\u00e1n have been found many towers and structures such as are built elsewhere by the followers of Zoroaster. Each mountain village, however, retains a trace of ancient idolatry in the sacred stone set up, in one form or another, in almost every hamlet. An oath sworn over this stone is held to be absolutely binding. Mullas from Sw\u00e1t and Boner proclaim the Sunn\u00ed tenets through the valleys. Many of the inhabitants are Shi\u00e1s; and although there is great intolerance where the sects are segregated, yet when Shi\u00e1s and Sunnis live in the same valley, their tolerance extends even to intermarriage. A distinct sect, called Mugl\u00ed\u00eds or Maulais, are connected by Colonel H. Yule with the sect of the Assassins, and with the sect to which the Druses of the Lebanon belong. What is the origin, or what are the beliefs of the Mugl\u00ed\u00eds, it is difficult to discover. The sect have a saying, that \u2018a man should conceal his faith and his women.\u2019 They endeavour to do both; but they are known to reject the idea of a future state, and to believe in the transmigration of souls. They hold Sunn\u00ed and Shi\u00e1 Muhammadans in contempt alike: the Sunn\u00ed is a dog and the Shi\u00e1 an ass. They revere the Kalam-i-Pir, a Persian work, only shown to men of the Mugl\u00ed\u00ed faith, instead of the Kur\u00e1n. They drink wine, and their spiritual guides do not profess celibacy. The Persian account of the sect, is that it was founded in A.D. 1496 by M\u00edr Sh\u00fams-\u00fa-d\u00edn, who in that year came to Kashm\u00edr out of Irak. The followers of Sh\u00fams-\u00fa-d\u00edn took the name of N\u00far Buksh, or illuminati. The Mugl\u00ed\u00ed or N\u00far Buksh tenets prevail in Balt\u00edst\u00e1n.\n\nGeneral Characteristics.\u2014Until recently, information about the Hindu Kush, and the entire mountain system of which it forms a part, has been extremely defective. But the inaccurate narratives of Moorcroft, Vigne, and comparatively modern travellers, as well as of the less modern Venetian, Ser Marco Polo, have been amplified, corrected, and partly superseded by the investigations of Sir Douglas Forsyth\u2019s mission to Y\u00e1rkhand in 1873, and by the works of Mr. Drew, Mr. Shaw, Dr. Leitner, Major Biddulph, and others. The term \u2018Hindu Kush\u2019 is said by Sir A. Burnes to be unknown to the Afgh\u00e1ns; but it is admitted by the same writer that there is a particular peak, and also a pass, bearing the name. Other writers identify the word \u2018Kush\u2019 with the Gaukasus of Pliny, and call the mountains stretching from the Him\u00e1layas on the one hand, to the Paropamisan mountains on the other, by the name of the\nIndian Caucasus. Little is known of the heights to be found in the range of the Hindu Kush. The maximum elevation of the range is said to be 20,000 feet, and its highest points to lie among the peaks of the Koh-i-Baba, or Hindu Kush proper, between Kabul and Bami\u00e1n. There is no peak near the British border of a greater height than 16,000 feet; but elevations up to 19,000 feet have been taken from levels in Kashmir territory. The slopes of the Hindu Kush are even more barren of verdure and cultivation than the slopes of the Himalayas. The valleys of the Hindu Kush are larger and more numerous than the valleys of the Himalayas. In the Hindu Kush the precious metals are said to be more abundant than in the Himalayas. There is a striking difference between the two ranges. On the western side the Himalayas are backed by lofty table-lands. No table-lands like those of Tibet support the western sides of the Hindu Kush. The Hindu Kush sinks abruptly into the low plains of Turkist\u00e1n.\n\nThe fauna and flora of the Hindu Kush are similar to the fauna and flora of the Himalayas lying within the same latitudes. In the neighbourhood of Gilgit, about which the information, due to Major Biddulph, is exceptionally complete, are found the wild goat, the snow ounce, and the wild dog. The wild dog is sometimes met with in packs. Above the forest belt, among the snow and ice, the ibex, the red bear, and the snow-cock share a rarely broken solitude. Flocks of wild sheep are numerous below the glacial region.\n\nAs in the Himalayan region, polyandry is practised in the Hindu Kush. Conjugal morality is lax. Infidelity is punished by the fine of a turban or a cloak exacted from the male accomplice. The tribes as a rule are peaceful, but at most times carry arms. Many tribes are fond of dancing, music, and a kind of polo. In great portion of the region a form of slavery still exists. Saff was formerly not uncommon, but the practice has been obsolete for the last fifty years. [For a full account of the population of these hills and the adjacent valleys, see Tribes of the Hindu Kush, by Major J. Biddulph, Calcutta, 1880.]\n\nHindupatti.\u2014Village in Shahjah\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 59' 55\" N., long. 80\u00b0 8' 55\" E. Population (1881) 621, namely, 352 Hindus and 269 Muhammadans. Forms part of a municipal union with Tilhar.\n\nHindupur.\u2014Tiluk in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency. Area, 481 miles. Population (1871) 87,763, or 182 persons to the square mile; (1881) 73,270, namely, 36,970 males and 36,300 females, dwelling in 100 villages containing 15,257 houses. In 1881, Hindus numbered 68,640; Muhammadans, 4596; and 'others,' 34. Kanarese is the language spoken. Chief products are grain, wheat, and castor-oil; minor products, cholam, cotton, and saffron. In 1883, the Tiluk\ncontained 2 criminal courts and 5 police stations (th\u00e1nds); regular police, 48 men. Land revenue, \u00a310,609.\n\n**Hindupur.**\u2014Town in Hindupur id\u00edluk, Anantapur District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 49' N., long. 79\u00b0 32' E. Population (1872) 6084; (1881) 6694, of whom 5806 were Hindus; number of houses, 1220. A large commercial town, the principal market of the id\u00edluk. Trade in jaggery, piece-goods, and grain.\n\n**Hindur** (also called Nalagarh).\u2014Petty Hill State under the Government of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 54' 30\" and 31\u00b0 14' 15\" N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 39' and 76\u00b0 56' 45\" E. long. Area, 252 square miles. The country was overrun by the Gurkh\u00e1s for some years prior to 1815, when they were driven out by the British, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was confirmed in possession. The present (1883) R\u00e1j\u00e1 is Agar Singh, a Rajput. Population (1881) 53,373, namely, males 29,082, and females 24,291; average density of population, 212 per square mile; number of houses, 10,246; number of villages, 331; persons per village, 161; persons per house, 5\u00b72. Hindus numbered 45,167; Sikhs, 667; Jains, 335; Muhammadans, 7201; and Christians, 3. Of the 331 villages in the State, the only place with upwards of 1000 inhabitants is N\u00e1lagarh town, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, which in 1881 had a population of 5969. Estimated revenue, \u00a39000. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 pays an annual tribute of \u00a3500 to the British Government. Sentences of death require confirmation from the Superintendent of Hill States and the Commissioner of the Division. Other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own authority. The principal products of the State are opium and the usual grains.\n\n**Hindust\u00e1n** (literally 'The Country of the Hindus,' Pers.).\u2014The name given, somewhat indefinitely, to the portion of India lying north of the Vindhya ranges, in contradistinction to the Deccan (Dakshin), or the part situated to the south of that line. As the name is not now applied to any administrative division of the country, it need only be cursorily mentioned here. Hindust\u00e1n is bounded on the north by the Him\u00e1layas; on the east by Assam; on the south by the Vindhyas; and on the west rather vaguely by the Punjab. It accordingly comprises the administrative tracts forming the Lieutenant-Governorships of Bengal, the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, together with the eastern portions of the Punjab, and perhaps the western Districts of the Chief-Commissionership of Assam. Hindust\u00e1n was also a name loosely employed by English writers during the last century and the first half of the present one, to include the whole of India. As employed by the natives themselves, however, it was never applied to the southern half of the Peninsula; and as regards even the country north of the Vindhyas, it did not strictly include either the extreme west, in the Punjab, or the extreme east, in Assam. In the early period of its\nhistory and for several centuries previous to the invasions of Mahmud of Ghazn\u012b, there were four celebrated kingdoms embraced by the term Hindust\u00e1n. These four kingdoms were Delhi (under the Tu\u00e1r and Chauh\u00e1n dynasties); Kanauj (under the Rahtors); Mewar (under the Gehlots); and Anhilw\u00e1ra (under the Chauras and Solankhis). To one or other of these kings the numerous petty princes of India are said to have paid homage and feudal service.\n\n**Hingangh\u00e1t.\u2014Tahsil** or Sub-division of Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; lying between 20\u00b0 17' 30\" and 20\u00b0 48' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 34' and 79\u00b0 16' E. long. Area (1881), 721 square miles, with 1 town and 290 villages; number of houses, 25,188, of which 23,376 are occupied and 1812 unoccupied. Population, 110,595, namely, males 55,069, and females 55,526; average density of population, 153\u00b74 per square mile; average number of persons per village, 380; occupied houses per square mile, 32\u00b74; persons per occupied house, 4\u00b77. Total adult agricultural population, 50,498, or 45\u00b766 per cent. of the total sub-divisional population. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 8 acres per adult agriculturist. Of the total area of 721 square miles, 49 square miles are held rent-free, while 672 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 483 square miles are cultivated, 119 square miles are cultivable, and 70 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied upon land, \u00a315,688, or rs. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rental paid by cultivators, \u00a323,732, or rs. 5\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The tahsil contained in 1882\u201383, 2 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 3 police stations (th\u00e1nds), and 3 outpost stations; total strength of regular police, 86 men; village watchmen (chaukiddars), 170.\n\n**Hingangh\u00e1t.\u2014Town** in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; 21 miles south-east of Wardh\u00e1 town. Lat. 20\u00b0 33' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 52' 30\" E. Population (1877) 9415; (1881) 9000, namely, Hindus, 7534; Sikh, 1; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 8; Muhammadans, 1017; Christians, 19; Jains, 306; P\u00e1rsi, 1; aborigines, 114. The town is a main seat of the cotton trade, the Hingangh\u00e1t cotton produced in the rich Wardh\u00e1 valley being esteemed one of the best indigenous staples of India. Two English firms have established agencies in the town, with capacious iron-roofed warehouses, and a stock of cotton presses; and they press for shipment direct to England. In March 1882, a factory for spinning cotton thread, known as the Hingangh\u00e1t Cotton Mills Company, was opened in the town. The Company has a capital of \u00a335,000, in 700 shares of \u00a350 each. Ten thousand spindles are worked by steam power in a large double-storied stone building, and employment is afforded to between 350 and 400 men, women, and children. The principal native traders are M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, many of whom have large transactions, and export to\nBombay and elsewhere on their own account; but the greater number merely act as middlemen between the cultivators and the large merchants. The municipal committee have opened a large gravelled market-place and storage yard, with raised platforms, and scales for weighing the cotton. The town consists of old and new Hingangh\u00e1t; the former, a straggling town, liable to be flooded by the river Wan\u00e1; the latter, in which the better classes reside, laid out in broad streets and avenues. At the District school, English and vernacular are taught up to an advanced standard. The girls' school has hitherto proved unsuccessful. Hingangh\u00e1t contains a tahsil office; a furnished travellers' bungalow; a large sard\u00ed, where travellers may halt for three days free of charge; and a dispensary, with buildings after the standard plan. The Wardh\u00e1 Valley State Railway, which runs from Wardh\u00e1 town to the Waror\u00e1 coal-field in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, has a station at Hingangh\u00e1t town.\n\n**Hingl\u00e1jgarh.**\u2014Hill fort in Indore, Central India; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 40' N., and long. 75\u00b0 50' E. It is surrounded by a ravine 200 feet deep and 250 wide, with perpendicular sides, from the edges of which the walls arise. The only communications are by three causeways across the chasm, each leading to one of the three gates. The fort, situated in Holkar's dominions, was long considered by the natives impregnable, but it was stormed on the 3rd July 1804 by a British detachment under Major Sinclair, with little loss. Distant from Indore 130 miles north.\n\n**Hingn\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; 16 miles north-east of Wardh\u00e1 town. Lat. 20\u00b0 55' N., long. 78\u00b0 45' E. Population (1881) 2157, chiefly weavers and cultivators. Founded about 160 years ago by Raghun\u00e1th Panth Sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r, grandfather of the present m\u00e1lgus\u00e1r. A large masonry fort, two temples, two large houses, and twenty-one wells still attest the founder's energy. During the Pind\u00e1rf disturbances, the m\u00e1lgus\u00e1r held the fort with 200 followers. An annual fair takes place on the second day of the Holi festival; and a market is held every week. Hingn\u00ed has a Government village school.\n\n**Hingoli.**\u2014Town in Parbhani Sub-division, the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), Deccan; situated in lat. 19\u00b0 43' N., and long. 77\u00b0 11' E., on the route from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to Akola, 185 miles north-west of the former and 72 miles south of the latter. Population (1881) 14,804. One of the stations of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Subsidiary Force. Hingoli is about twenty miles from the Ber\u00e1r frontier. It is a great cotton mart. In 1833, Captain Sleeman captured many of the Deccan thags here. Fourteen miles to the south-west, in the village of Hundah, are the ruins of a huge temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo. Distance from Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d), 190 miles north-west.\nHingona.\u2014Village in Gwalior territory, Central India; situated on the left bank of the river Kuw\u00e1ri, in lat. 26\u00b0 32' N., and long. 77\u00b0 58' E., on the route from Agra to the fort of Gwalior, 47 miles south of the former and 23 north-west of the latter. At Hingona, in the end of December 1843, the British army under Sir Hugh Gough, accompanied by Lord Ellenborough, remained encamped some days during the abortive negotiations previous to the battle of Mahar\u00e1jpur.\n\nHir\u00e1pur.\u2014Petty State or guaranteed thakurate under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, Central India. Population (1881) 963. The chief, R\u00e1o Chhatar Singh, receives through the Political Agent the following pecuniary allowances in lieu of rights over land:\u2014From Holkar, \u00a3333; from Sindhia, \u00a3291; from Bhop\u00e1l, \u00a320; total, \u00a3644. He holds Hir\u00e1pur and Ah\u00edrw\u00e1s on an istimr\u00e1ri rent of \u00a360. He is also a political pensioner of the British Government, from which he receives \u00a3218 a year.\n\nHirdenagar.\u2014Village in Mandl\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Hirde Sh\u00e1h about 1644. An annual fair is held on the banks of the Banjar, and considerable trade is done.\n\nHirehal (Hiraholu).\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 0' 30\" N., long. 76\u00b0 54' E.; 12 miles south of Bellary, on the Bangalore road. Population (1881) 522. Centre of a brass industry. Ruins of an old fort.\n\nHirekal (or Hirikal-gudda).\u2014Range of hills in the central plateau of Mysore State, at the junction of the Districts of T\u00famk\u00far, Hassan, and Kad\u00far. A District forest has been formed. One of the hills contains a temple to Tirupati, and on another Haidar Ali attempted to found a new city, Nayapuri, but failed owing to the unhealthiness of the place.\n\nHiremagal\u00far ('Elder Daughter's Town').\u2014Village in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State; one mile south-east of Chikrmagal\u00far. Population (1881) 2053, chiefly composed of Sri Vaishnav Br\u00e1hmans. The mythical scene of a 'serpent sacrifice,' commemorated by a spear-headed stone pillar, now regarded as efficacious in cases of snake-bite. Inscriptions have been found dating back to the 11th century. There are several old temples.\n\nHiri\u00fdur.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore State. Area, 806 square miles. Population (1871) 62,607; (1881) 40,305, namely, 39,182 Hindus, 1103 Muhammadans, and 20 Christians; land revenue (1881-82), exclusive of water rates, \u00a35015. The soil of the t\u00e1luk is barren and stony, and in great need of irrigation. Iron is smelted, some cotton is grown, and glass bracelets are manufactured. Cost of administration (1882), \u00a31285; number of criminal courts, 1; number of police stations (th\u00e1nds), 9; regular police, 72 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 168.\n\nHiri\u00fdur ('Great Town').\u2014Village in Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore\nState, on the right bank of the Vedavati river, and at the bifurcation of the high-road from Bangalore, which here branches off to Bellary and to Chitaldrug. Lat. 13\u00b0 57' N., long. 76\u00b0 39' 30\" E. Population (1881) 2270. Founded in the 16th century, it suffered much during the wars between Haidar Ali and the Marathas. On account of its unhealthiness, it has been proposed to change the site to the opposite bank of the river; but the inhabitants are unwilling to desert their old temples. Hiriyur is the head-quarters of the taluk of the same name.\n\nHirode (or French Rocks).\u2014Village and formerly a military station in Mysore District, Mysore State; 2882 feet above the sea, and 4 miles north of Seringapatam. Lat. 12\u00b0 31' N.; long. 76\u00b0 45' E. Population (1881) 3041. Hirode derives its name of 'French Rocks' from being the place where the French soldiers in the service of Haidar and Tipu were stationed. No troops are now quartered in the cantonments, which are distant about 2\u00bd miles from the railway station. Hirode was abandoned as a military station in December 1882, when the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore took over the administration of his State.\n\nHis\u00e1mpur.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bahr\u00e1ich District, Oudh; situated in the south-east corner of the District. Bounded on the north by Fatehpur pargan\u00e1; on the east by Gonda District; on the south and west by Bara Banki District. One of the oldest pargan\u00e1s in the District, taking its name from a village founded by some Ans\u00e1ris in honour of His\u00e1m-ul-hak, who is said to have been one of the comrades of the Musalm\u00e1n invader Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad, and to have perished with him in battle. At the time of this invasion, the country was in the hands of the Bhars, who seem to have maintained their power for several centuries subsequent to that event. The Ans\u00e1ris, an Arab tribe, appear to have been the first permanent Muhammadan settlers. The date of their arrival was probably 1226 A.D., when Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad brought Oudh into subjection. They occupied His\u00e1mpur, Pachambar, and Tawakulpur, and increased their possessions until they had acquired about 250 villages. The Bhars, however, still held their ground; and in the reign of Muhammad Tughlak, the ancestor of the Jarw\u00e1l Sayyids found great difficulty in obtaining possession of the j\u00e1gir that had been bestowed upon him. The Sayyids came originally from Persia to Lahore, whence they found their way to Delhi and Bara Banki. The Ans\u00e1ris passed away, and their possessions seem to have fallen into the hands of the Sayyids, who at the commencement of the present century were in possession of 276 villages, of which 157 had been acquired by purchase. In their turn, however, they had to give way before the Kalh\u00e1ns R\u00e1jputs of Chhedw\u00e1r\u00e1, who within the last fifty years have acquired 112 villages in His\u00e1mpur. The Raikw\u00e1rs hold 52 villages in the north of the pargan\u00e1. A large unimpaired\nancestral estate is the il\u00e1ka of Dubh\u00e1pur, which was conferred on an ancient k\u00e1si who was made kan\u00fango of the parg\u00e1nd, and whose descendants still hold the office as well as the property. The whole parg\u00e1nd lies low, and its general appearance supports the tradition that in former ages it was subject to fluvial action, as the Gogra retreated westward and southward. The ground rises slightly towards the eastern boundary. Area, 302 square miles, of which 155 are under the plough; barren and waste land, 33 per cent. of total area. Government land revenue, \u00a314,958; average rate on cultivated area, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre; on assessed area, 2s. 10\u00bdd. per acre; on total area, 1s. 7d. per acre. Population (1869) 129,591; (1881) 144,238, namely, males 75,490, and females 68,748. Three main lines of road intersect the parg\u00e1nd. Principal markets, Jarw\u00e1l and Khutagh\u00e1t; minor b\u00e1zdrs at Sang\u00e1na, Kur\u00e1sar, Kotw\u00e1, and Patupur. Well-frequented weekly cattle market at Gandh\u00e1ra. Government schools in 8 villages. District post-offices at Kur\u00e1sar and Jarw\u00e1l. Tahsil offices, Government dispensary, police station, post-office, and sub-registrar's office at Kaisarganj.\n\nHiss\u00e1r.\u2014Division under a Commissioner in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, comprising the three Districts of Hiss\u00e1r, Rohtak, and Sirsa, each of which see separately; situated between 28\u00b0 19' 30\" and 30\u00b0 17' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 57' 30\" and 77\u00b0 E. long. Area of the Division (1881), 8355 square miles, containing 25 towns and 1727 villages; number of houses, 245,433, of which 178,475 were occupied, and 66,958 unoccupied; number of families, 277,352. Total population, 1,311,067, namely, males 707,182, and females 603,885; total increase on the corresponding area in 1868, 84,473, or 6\u00b79 per cent. Average density of population (1881), 157 per square mile; houses per square mile, 29; persons per town or village, 748; persons per occupied house, 7\u00b73. As in the other Districts of the Lower Punjab, Hindus largely predominate in the population, numbering 983,853 in 1881. Muhammadans numbered 286,316; Sikhs, 31,605; Jains, 9186; Christians and others, 107.\n\nHiss\u00e1r.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 36' and 29\u00b0 49' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 16' and 76\u00b0 22' E. long. Average width, 47 miles; extreme length from north to south, 83 miles. Hiss\u00e1r shares only with Rohtak and Simla among the Punjab Districts the peculiarity of having absolutely no river frontage. It is bounded on the north and north-west by the State of Pati\u00e1la and a small portion of the District of Sirsa; on the east and south by the State of J\u00ednd (Jheend) and the District of Rohtak; and on the west by the grazing grounds of Bik\u00e1ner (Bickaneer). The District stands 12th in order of area, and 21st in order of population, among the 32 Districts of the Punjab, comprising 3\u00b732 per cent. of the total area, and 2\u00b768 per cent. of the total population of the\nBritish territory. Area, 3540 square miles; population in 1881, 504,183 souls. The town of Hissar is the administrative head-quarters of the District and of the Commissionership of the same name; but Bhiwani, with more than double its population, is the chief commercial town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Hiss\u00e1r forms the eastern border District of the great Bik\u00e1ner (Bickaneer) desert. It consists for the most part of sandy plains dotted with scrub and brushwood, and broken by undulating sandhills towards the south, which gradually increase in height till they rise into hills of rock (highest, 800 feet) like islands out of a sea of sand. The Ghaggar, its only river, enters the District from the north-east in two branches a few miles from each other, and passes through it into Sirsa District on the north-west. Its supply of water is uncertain, depending much on the fall of rain in the lower Him\u00e1layas; the overflow in times of heavy rain is caught near Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d and Murakhera by jhils or swamps, which dry up in the hot season, leaving a fertilized bed, where rice, wheat, gram, and barley are grown. A canal from the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), constructed by the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h Tughlak, crosses Hiss\u00e1r from east to west, irrigating 54 villages lying along its banks. The Bik\u00e1ner desert absorbs its scanty remaining waters at their western outlet from the District. This canal was choked up and disused till 1826\u201327, when it was restored by the British, and much enlarged and improved; it is now known as the Western Jumna Canal. Apprehensions of increased revenue demands deterred the people from using its waters till the famine of 1832\u201333, since which date it has been utilized with much advantage to the crops, and well repays the capital invested. Neither the Ghaggar nor the canal is navigable.\n\nThe District is divisible into three principal tracts, called chaks, each with its own characteristics, and known respectively as Chak Hari\u00e1na, Chak B\u00e1gar, and Chak N\u00e1ll\u00ed. The first-named is the largest of the three tracts, and contains 292 out of the 631 villages of Hiss\u00e1r. It occupies the heart of the District, and is traversed through its centre from west to east by the Western Jumna Canal. The soil is of two descriptions, technically known as d\u00e1k\u00e1r and rausli, the former being a strong clay, requiring abundant saturation before it is ready for seed, while the latter has more or less admixture of sand, and requires a somewhat less degree of moisture. Though bearing rich crops when sufficiently saturated, the land yields almost nothing when there is a failure in the natural rains. Water is only reached at a depth varying from 100 to 130 feet, and the cost of a masonry well is seldom below \u00a3150. Well irrigation is therefore not attempted, except in very bad seasons, when a few acres around each village site are irrigated for growing vegetables. In dry seasons, not only is there no grain harvest,\nbut hardly an ordinary grass crop. In order to make the most of the rainfall, the farmers leave large tracts uncultivated, and, collecting the drainage from these, by means of watercourses conduct it on to their cultivated fields. Chak B\u00e1gar occupies the south of the District, and includes the towns of Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed and Tosh\u00e1m. In this tract nothing interferes with the universal reign of sand, and cultivation is only carried on with great difficulty. If there is no rain, there is no crop at all, not even a blade of grass. If rain is too heavy, the sand is washed down from the hillocks upon the cultivated fields and chokes the seed, so that cultivators have not unfrequently to sow three or four times for each harvest. Dust-storms, too, often change the appearance of the country, and hills of sand appear on what the day previous was a cultivated field. Against all these disadvantages, however, there are compensating benefits; the labour of ploughing is reduced to a minimum, owing to the lightness of the soil, and a very slight fall of rain is sufficient to produce a harvest here, which would be quite inadequate to affect the richer country farther north. Chak N\u00e1l\u00ed, in the north of the District, owes its name to the fact that during the rains it is traversed by two streams, the Ghaggar and one of its tributaries. It includes the towns of Barw\u00e1la and Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d. The soil, for the most part, is that known as raushi, mentioned above, but the population is very scanty, and at the time of Settlement (1863) only a small proportion of the tract had been brought under cultivation. The cultivated villages lie along the banks of the Ghaggar or one of its branches, but river irrigation is only practicable for a month or six weeks in the year, and the ultimate result of the harvest is almost as dependent upon timely rains as in the more sterile parts of the District. Well irrigation is carried on here to a considerable extent, and the cost of construction is not excessive.\n\nThere are no forests of heavy timber. A Government cattle stud near Hiss\u00e1r occupies an area of 43,287 acres, and this tract is wooded. The most important trees are the kikar (Mimosa arabica); the jhand (Prosopis spicigera), valuable for railway fuel; and the sissu (Dalbergia sissoo). Three shrubs, the jh\u00fal (Salvadora oleoides), the kair or leafless caper (Capparis aphylla), and the jh\u00e1rberi (Zizyphus nepeca), abound; their berries become staple articles of food in times of scarcity. Lions were found in the District as late as 1830; leopards are still occasionally met with; and hyenas, wolves, wild hog, florican, sand-grouse, black partridge, hares, and quail abound. The badger is occasionally seen among the brushwood. Old mosques and other buildings exist in parts of the District, especially near the town of Hiss\u00e1r. Two stone pillars erected by Firoz Sh\u00e1h stand at Hiss\u00e1r and Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nHistory. \u2014 Prior to the Muhammadan conquest, the semi-desert tract, of which Hiss\u00e1r District now forms part, was the retreat of\nChauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs. H\u00e1nsi was then the capital, Hiss\u00e1r town being founded by the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h Tughlak about 1354. During the rule of Naw\u00e1b Sh\u00e1h Dadkh\u00e1n of Kas\u00far, from 1707 to 1737, the people and country were in a state of prosperity, soon to be changed to confusion and distress under his successor, the Naw\u00e1b of Farukhnagar in Gurg\u00e1on. In his time, N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h ravaged the land, and the Sikhs began their inroads, while the Bhattis of Bhatti\u00e1na joined in the bloody struggles for superiority which ensued. The ascendency nominally belonged to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in virtue of their dominant position at the Delhi Court. Eventually R\u00e1j\u00e1 Amar Singh of Pati\u00e1la extorted the reluctant submission of the Bhatti chiefs; but on his death in 1781, they regained their independence. To complete the ruin brought on by these conflicts, Nature lent her aid in the great famine of 1783. In 1795\u201399, George Thomas, an Irish adventurer, who took service with a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief, established his authority over a tract including H\u00e1nsi and Hiss\u00e1r, with an annual revenue of \u00a3200,000. He established a gun-foundry and mint at H\u00e1nsi, and aspired to conquer the Punjab. But in 1802, after an obstinate defence of H\u00e1nsi, his capital, he surrendered to an army sent against him by the French General Perron, at the instance of the Sikhs. He shortly afterwards died in British territory.\n\nHiss\u00e1r passed nominally to the British in 1803. But although we maintained a military post at H\u00e1nsi, and placed n\u00e1sims, or native superintendents, in civil charge, it was not till 1810 that we could enforce order. Two chiefs of the Bhattis declared their independence\u2014one of them, Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, was expelled the country; the estates of the other, Zabta Kh\u00e1n, were confiscated in 1818. A long and difficult boundary contention between the British Government and the Pati\u00e1la R\u00e1j\u00e1 ended in the transfer of 150 villages to the latter. Early in the Mutiny of 1857, the local levies at H\u00e1nsi revolted. Hiss\u00e1r was wholly lost for a time to British rule, and all Europeans were either murdered or compelled to fly. The Bhattis rose under their hereditary chiefs, and the majority of the Muhammadan population followed their example; but before Delhi had been recovered, a force of Punjab levies, aided by contingents from Pati\u00e1la and Bik\u00e1ner, under General Van Cortlandt, utterly routed the rebels. After the Mutiny, Hiss\u00e1r District was transferred from the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces to that of the Punjab, and the Sub-division of Bhiw\u00e1ni has since been added to it.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census, taken in 1853, showed a population of 330,825, being 100 persons to the square mile. The Census of 1868 returned the area at 3539'73 square miles (the same as at present), and the population at 484,681 persons. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 504,183, showing an increase of 19,502, or 4'02 per cent. during the 13 years since 1868. The main results disclosed by\nthe Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 3540 square miles; number of towns and villages, 631; houses, 92,827, of which 73,127 were occupied, and 19,700 unoccupied; number of families, 107,793. Total population, 504,183, namely, males 272,267, and females 231,916. Average density of population, 143 persons per square mile; towns and villages, 18 per square mile; persons per village, 799; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b79. Classified according to age and sex, there were\u2014males under 15 years of age, 99,241, females 86,519; males 15 years and upwards, 173,026, females 145,397. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 384,366; Sikhs, 3143; Jains, 3102; Muhammadans, 113,517; and Christians, 55. Among the Hindus, the J\u00e1ts, who number 134,886 (including 4282 Muhammadan J\u00e1ts), give the ethnical character to the District; they are of two distinct classes, the one known as desw\u00e1la, or 'long-settled,' men of the des or country; the other as b\u00e1gri, 'later-comers,' men of the b\u00e1gar or Bik\u00e1ner desert, who occupy the western portion of the District. The former are excellent cultivators; their women share in all field labour, not requiring the employment of oxen. The Hindu R\u00e1jputs (12,923), known generally as Tu\u00e1rs, claim to have once held 1440 villages, though now only possessing 5 or 6. The Bhattis, Muhammadans of R\u00e1jput blood (48,069), trace their descent from Jesal of the Yadubansi stock. Both Tu\u00e1rs and Bhattis were marauding desert tribes. The Pach\u00e1des, or 'men of the west,' now all Muhammadans, are in Hiss\u00e1r degenerate R\u00e1jputs, who usually act in concert with the pure born Bhattis. A religious sect, known as Bishnois, 8118 in number, worship their founder, J\u00e1mabh\u00e1j\u00ed, as an incarnation of Vishnu, and bury their dead in a sitting posture, in the floors of their houses or cattle-sheds. This sect is almost entirely confined to Hiss\u00e1r and Sirsa Districts. They consider even the touch of tobacco polluting. At their marriages, passages from the Kur\u00e1n and the Sh\u00e1stras are indiscriminately recited. They avoid destroying life, and bury any animal accidentally killed. The other principal tribes and castes are\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 31,613; G\u00fajars, 8426, including 2641 Muhammadans; Ch\u00fahr\u00e1s, 12,126, including 829 Muhammadans; Cham\u00e1rs, 49,269, exclusively Hindus; Tarkh\u00e1ns, 12,627, including 816 Muhammadans; Baniy\u00e1s, 43,309, exclusively Hindus or Jains; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 19,662, including 4604 Muhammadans; Dh\u00e1naks, 13,529, almost exclusively Hindus; M\u00e1lls, 9777, all Hindus or Sikhs; Ah\u00edrs, 7861, all Hindus; Tel\u00eds, 6891, almost exclusively Muhammadans; Loh\u00e1rs, 5862, including 1090 Hindus; Chhimb\u00e1s, 5156, including 1146 Muhammadans; Shaikhs, 3983; and Path\u00e1ns, 2416, both exclusively Muhammadans. The native Christian population only numbered 6 in 1881, the remaining 49 consisting of Europeans or Eurasians.\n\nThere are six municipalities in the District, viz. BHIWANI, population\nHISSAR DISTRICT.\n\n(1881) 33,762; HISSAR, 14,167; HANSI, 12,656; TOHANA, 4155; RATEA, 3212; and FATEHABAD, 2992. The decayed town of AGROHA is interesting as being the original seat of the great mercantile class of Agarw\u00e1l\u00e1s. The rock-cut inscriptions of Tosh\u00e1m also deserve notice. Of the 631 villages and towns in the District in 1881, 101 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 206 from two to five hundred; 187 from five hundred to a thousand; 104 from one to two thousand; 20 from two to three thousand; 9 from three to five thousand; 1 from five to ten thousand; 2 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants. The occupations of the male population over 15 years of age in 1881 were returned as follows:\u2014Class (1) Professional class, including Government officials, 5468; (2) domestic and menial class, 3896; (3) commercial class, 5466; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, 108,459; (5) industrial class, 32,043; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 10,455; (7) unspecified, 7239.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Autumn rice is sown in June and July; the spring crops from September to November. Rotation of crops is understood but not regularly practised. Manure is little used. Camels are employed as well as oxen and buffaloes for ploughing. The extent of land under cultivation is not constant, depending entirely on the rainfall. In 1881-82, 1,286,483 acres were under tillage, out of an assessed area of 2,265,428 acres, leaving 978,945 acres fallow. In favourable seasons, cotton is extensively grown on land irrigated by the Western Jumna Canal. The agricultural year is divided as elsewhere into two great harvests, the rabi or spring, and the kharif or autumn crop, the latter being by far the most important. The area under the principal crops in 1882-83 is returned as follows:\u2014Rabi or spring crop\u2014wheat, 45,342; barley, 106,916; gram, 73,193; tobacco, 2133; mustard, 11,285; and vegetables, 3465 acres; total area under rabi crops, 246,257 acres. Kharif or autumn harvest\u2014rice, 8145; jodr (spiked millet), 241,035; b\u00e1jra (great millet), 590,004; moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius), 123,923; m\u00e1sh (Phaseolus radiatus), 4101; m\u00fang (Phaseolus mungo), 28,296; masur (Cajanus indicus), 35,956; chillies, 1374; til (Sesamum orientale), 5788; cotton, 23,191; vegetables, 3378; total area under kharif crops, 1,092,370 acres. Grand total under cultivation, including twice-cropped land, 1,338,627. The average out-turn of produce per acre is thus returned\u2014rice, 566 lbs.; wheat, 428 lbs.; inferior grains, 282 lbs.; oil-seeds, 199 lbs.; cleaned cotton, 54 lbs.; other fibres, 100 lbs.; and vegetables, 1083 lbs. per acre. Hiss\u00e1r produces a breed of milk-white oxen, 17 or 18 hands in height, which are in great request for the carriages of natives; a good pair is worth \u00a340. The Government cattle farm has done much to improve this fine breed of cattle, which are bought by native gentlemen and merchants from all parts of Northern India. The agricultural stock of the District\nconsists approximately of 94,500 cows and bullocks, 853 horses, 715 ponies, 5439 donkeys, 80,302 sheep and goats, 4107 pigs, 6690 camels, 1637 carts, and 32,832 ploughs. The two streams of the Ghaggar irrigate a portion of the northern section of the District; but their waters are available at the best for only a month or six weeks, and this partial irrigation must be supplemented by rain in December or January to ensure a crop. The land watered by the main or southernmost stream yields only a spring crop; that situated near the northern branch of the river produces both a spring and an autumn crop. The Western Jumna Canal irrigates 54 villages, with an area of 86,014 acres. Irrigation by private works is carried out in 19,713 acres. More than half the village communities of the District are coparcenary, whilst rather fewer than one-third are held by single owners. Formerly, many proprietors called themselves cultivators, in order to avoid the obligation imposed by a curious local custom, requiring landholders to track the footprints of criminals out of their bounds, or to give the criminals up. These men have, under the present Land Settlement, been recognised as proprietors. Thirty grants, varying from 60 to 300 acres in extent, were bestowed, revenue-free for three lives, on the native officers of cavalry regiments disbanded in 1819. These were known as sikhlambri (a corruption of 'supernumerary') grants; most of them have now lapsed. The estates of the late Colonel James Skinner, C.B. (comprising 67 villages, paying a revenue of \u00a34355, or more than a tenth of the entire land revenue of the District), remain undivided, and are now managed by a member of the family on behalf of the others. More than 15,000 tenants have occupancy rights; but double that number possess no security of tenure. Rates of rent vary from about 1s. to 18s. per acre.\n\nPrices of produce on the 1st January 1883\u2014wheat, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; flour (best), 18 sers per rupee, or 6s. 3d. per cwt.; barley, 35 sers per rupee, or 3s. 2d. per cwt.; gram, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; rice (best), 12 sers per rupee, or 9s. 4d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; jodhr, 35 sers per rupee, or 3s. 2d. per cwt.; bajra, 27 sers per rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; potatoes, 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.; cotton (cleaned), 3\u00bd sers per rupee, or \u00a31, 10s. 8d. per cwt. Farm labourers, when paid in money, earn from 2\u00bdd. to 6d. a day, and skilled labourers from 6d. to 7\u00bdd. a day.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District has always been subject to famine. The first calamity of this kind of which we have authentic record occurred in the year 1783, when the price of the commonest grain rose to 22s. a cwt. Since then there have been more or less serious failures of the crops in 1833, 1835, 1836, 1837, 1838\u201339, 1860\u201361, 1869\u201370. In August 1869, 63,000 persons received relief.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The out-turn of rough saltpetre in 1882\u201383 con-\nsisted of 38,412 maunds or 1406 tons, worked from 348 pans. The rural manufactures are\u2014coarse cotton cloth; vessels made of prepared skins, chiefly at Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d; copper and brass vessels. Principal exports\u2014oil-seeds, chiefly sesamum, the trade in which is increasing. In good seasons, gram, and considerable quantities of the coarser grains, go westward, and also to Delhi and other Districts to the east; copper and brass utensils to R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; hides are sold for Cawnpur and Meerut (Merath); a little cotton goes via Fazilk\u00e1 to Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed. Imports\u2014salt, sugar, fine rice, cotton goods of English make, spices, and iron. The exports are about double the imports in value. The trade of the District centres in Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed. The commerce of this town suffered considerably by the opening of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na railway, but is expected to improve owing to the opening of the Rew\u00e1r-Firozpur State Railway, which runs through the District for 75 miles, with stations at Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed, Bhatw\u00e1n\u00ed Kher\u00e1, H\u00e1nsi, Satrand, Hiss\u00e1r, Takhand, Adampur, and Bhuttod. This line was opened throughout its length in Hiss\u00e1r District in 1883. The main road, about 50 feet wide, from Delhi to Sirsa, traverses the District from south-east to north-west, passing through H\u00e1nsi and Hiss\u00e1r towns. Total length of roads in the District, 551 miles, of which 42 miles are metalled. Camels are largely employed for transit. The only printing-press is at the jail, where lithographic work is executed.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1810, when first the attention of Government was seriously directed to the tract of which Hiss\u00e1r forms part, the country, with the exception of H\u00e1nsi, either lay entirely waste, or was held by recent settlers, ready to abandon their occupancy on the least pressure. It was not till 1816 that a settlement for 10 years was made, continued for a further term of 5 years; in 1831\u201332, another 10 years' settlement followed. These assessments ranged somewhat above 4\u00bd ldkhs of rupees (\u00a345,000); but during their currency, in some years arrears of 50 per cent. accrued, and the average arrears from 1825 to 1839 was 28 per cent. In 1840, the Collector showed that only the canal villages could bear any but a low assessment, which he ultimately reduced by an average of 37\u00bd per cent. below previous rates; this was confirmed in 1841 for 20 years. A new assessment for 30 years was sanctioned in 1863 at \u00a341,022, afterwards increased to \u00a342,449, by the transfer of 22 villages from Rohtak District. Under this settlement no serious arrears have accrued. The incidence of the present assessment is at the rate of 7\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; 4\u00bdd. per cultivable acre; and 4\u00bdd. per acre of total assessed area.\n\nThe administration is conducted by one Deputy Commissioner, two native extra-Assistant Commissioners, 5 tahsild\u00e1rs or sub-divisional collectors, and 5 naibs (deputies). Total revenue in 1882\u201383, \u00a351,128, of which \u00a342,426 was derived from the land-tax. The\ntotal District police, in 1882, numbered 388 men of all grades; the municipal police, 144, besides a village watch of 988 men, who are supported by the proceeds of a village house-tax. The District is divided for police purposes into 13 th\u00e1nds or police circles. One jail; daily average of prisoners in 1882, 210. The percentage of deaths among the jail inmates was 6.58%. In 1882-83, 30 schools were under the supervision of the Education Department, with 1425 pupils. There are also between 50 and 60 uninspected indigenous schools, with about 1000 pupils.\n\nHiss\u00e1r, H\u00e1nsi, and Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed have been constituted municipalities under Act xv. of 1867, and Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Rattia, and Toh\u00e1na, under Act iv. of 1873; total population within municipal limits in 1881-82, 70,944; total municipal income (1882-83), \u00a36290; incidence of taxation, 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMeteorological Aspects, etc.\u2014The climate of Hiss\u00e1r is very dry. Hot westerly winds blow from the middle of March till July. The rainy season lasts from July to September. In December and January the nights are very cold. Average rainfall for the five years ending 1881-82, 15.70 inches, varying from 13.70 inches in 1877-78 to 18.40 inches in 1881-82. The principal diseases are fevers, rheumatic affections, ophthalmia, respiratory affections, and skin disorders. Cholera occasionally breaks out, and in 1867 caused 3625 deaths, being brought into the District on that occasion by pilgrims from Hardw\u00e1r. Skin disorders are also very common. The average reported death-rate of the District is 18.50 per 1000, that of the three principal towns being 43.50. There are 4 Government dispensaries in the District, viz. at Hiss\u00e1r, Bhiw\u00e1n\u00ed, H\u00e1nsi, and Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d. [For further information regarding Hiss\u00e1r, see the Settlement Report of the District by Munsh\u00ed Am\u00edr Ch\u00e1nd (1863); also the Gazetteer of the District, published by authority of the Punjab Government; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the Punjab Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nHiss\u00e1r.\u2014Tahsil of Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 42' and 29\u00b0 20' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 24' 30\" and 75\u00b0 58' E. long. Area, 841 square miles. Population (1881) 98,106, namely, males 52,286, and females 45,820; average density of population, 117 per square mile. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 81,200; Muhammadans, 16,290; Sikhs, 4; and 'others,' 616. Total revenue of the tahsil (1883), \u00a38939. The administrative staff (including headquarters officers) consists of 1 Commissioner of Division, 1 Deputy Commissioner, 2 Assistant Commissioners, and 1 tahsild\u00e1r. These officers preside over 5 civil and 5 criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1nds), 3; strength of regular police, 71 men, besides 261 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\nHiss\u00e1r.\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab. Situated on the Western Jumna Canal, 102 miles west of Delhi. Lat. 29\u00b0 9' 51\" N., long. 75\u00b0 45' 55\" E. Population (1868) 14,138; (1881) 14,167, namely, 9039 Hindus, 5080 Muhammadans, 4 Sikhs, and 44 Christians. The town was founded in 1354 A.D. by the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h, who constructed the canal to supply it with water. It soon supplanted H\u00e1nsi as the political and fiscal centre of the District, and became Firoz Sh\u00e1h's favourite residence. The d\u00e9bris of his buildings still remain in the mounds and broken bricks scattered profusely over the plain south of the modern town. Tombs and temples still standing attest its former greatness. Hiss\u00e1r fell into decay during the last century, owing to the constant inroads of the Sikhs and other marauders, and was almost completely depopulated during the Sar Ch\u00e1lisa famine of 1783. The place was occupied about the year 1796 by the adventurer George Thomas, who built a fort here, and collected a number of inhabitants for his capital. The streets of Hissar are wider and less tortuous than in most native towns; but a squalid suburb has sprung up outside the walls. The civil station lies south of the town, on the opposite side of the canal. Hiss\u00e1r contains a cattle farm, both for commissariat purposes and for improving the breed of the Province; it is managed by a European superintendent, and has attached an estate of 43,287 acres for pasturage. Import trade in grain, ghi, sugar, oil, cotton, tobacco, and English piece-goods. Municipal revenue in 1882, \u00a31077, chiefly derived from octroi, or 1s. 6d. per head of population.\n\nHiwarkhed.\u2014Town in Morsi taluk, Amr\u00e1oti District, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. 21\u00b0 23' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 7' 30\" E.; about 45 miles east of Elichpur, on the banks of the P\u00e1kand N\u00e1l\u00ed, a tributary of the Wardh\u00e1. Population (1867) 3164; (1881) 2997, chiefly Kunb\u00eds. Weekly market; trade in molasses, cotton, grain, and salt. Government school; fine camping ground.\n\nHiwarkher.\u2014Town in Akot taluk, Akola District, Ber\u00e1r, N.N.W. of Akola. Population (1867) 6648; (1881) 7300, namely, 6250 Hindus, 930 Muhammadans, and 120 Jains. The town occupies 54 acres of ground, with 135 persons to the acre.\n\nHlaing.\u2014Township lying on both banks of the Hlaing or Rangoon river, and occupying the north-west portion of Hanthawadi District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Area, 678 square miles; bounded on the north by Tharawadi, on the west by Thungwa, and on the south and east by the Hmaw-bi township of Hanthawadi and the township of Pegu. Hlaing township comprises 4 revenue circles, viz. Ok-kan, Myaung-tang, Aing-ka-laung, and Baw-lay. In 1876, the population was 19,996, and the gross revenue \u00a39620. In 1881, the population was 30,570. In 1876, the area under rice was 28,469 acres; and\nin 1881, 32,919 acres; gross revenue (1881), \u00a312,992. To the east of the township, the country is hilly; and valuable timber, such as teak, pyin-ma, in, ka-gnyin, thin-gan, and pyin-gado, abounds. Below this the country gradually sinks into a plain, the eastern borders of which on the north lie lower than the banks of the Hlaing, and are consequently inundated annually. West of this river, the country is one vast flat, only a few points being above flood-level. On the slopes of these rice is grown; elsewhere the plain is covered with grass and unimportant forest. The chief rivers are the Hlaing and its tributaries, and the Baw-lay creek. The principal villages are \u2014 Taw-la-te, on the Baw-lay, the head-quarters station, with a population (1881) of 554 souls; Pauk-kun, and Myaung-tang. Pauk-kun (Padeegone) is a station on the Irawadi Valley (State) Railway, between Prome and Rangoon. To the south of Hlaing township are the remains of an old city, said to have been founded by Rahzadirit, the famous Talaing monarch.\n\nHlaing.\u2014River of British Burma. The course of the Hlaing is through the Irawadi valley, and past Rangoon town, whence to its mouth it is universally known as the Rangoon river. Under the name of the Myit-ma-ka, it rises in the marshy ground east of, but close to, Prome; and flowing over a sandy and muddy bed between low and ill-defined banks, enters the In-ma Lake as the Zay, thence it continues its southward course as the Myit-ma-ka, and, traversing Henzada District east of and almost parallel to the Irawadi, enters Rangoon District at Myit-kyo. In the north, the Hlaing is separated from the Irawadi by a line of low hills covered with in forest; below Myan-aung, numerous creeks connect it with that river. It is navigable from San-ywe, where it receives the Th\u00fan-ze from the east to Ta-pun, the water being never less than 3 feet deep. The channel here in many places is choked by jungle. Small boats can ascend as far as In-ma. Owing to numerous shoals, the Hlaing is impracticable for steamers above San-ywe, where its width is 180 yards, its depth 4 feet, and the tidal rise 2\u00bd feet. The Baw-lay leaves it in lat. 17\u00b0 15' N., and rejoins it again as the K\u00fakko immediately north of lat. 17\u00b0 N. The Hlaing here widens considerably. Three miles below the junction of the Hlaing and the Baw-lay the stream suddenly spreads out to a breadth of several miles, and its course is divided by two islands into three channels, of which the eastern is the deepest, and the one always used by river steamers reaching the Irawadi through the Baw-lay creek during the rains. The western channel is shallow. The central one is still shallower, and obstructed by sandbanks. Just above Rangoon, the Hlaing is joined by the Pan-hlaing from the westward, and, sweeping round the town to the east, receives the Pegu and Pu-zun-daung, when it turns north again and flows into the Gulf of Martaban, in lat. 16\u00b0 28' N., and long. 96\u00b0 20' E.,\nthrough a mouth 3 miles broad. The land at the entrance is low, and fringed with dense mangrove forest. The spring tides rise 21 feet, and neaps 13 feet. The Hlaing is navigable to Rangoon by large ships; but the passage is winding and difficult, and the Hastings' Shoal, formed just above the united mouths of the Pegu and Pu-zun-daung rivers, can be crossed by vessels of over six feet draught only at flood tide. During the rains, the river is navigable for 30 miles above Rangoon by ships of 500 tons burthen. The plains of the Hlaing valley form a swamp 1200 square miles in extent. More than one plan for their reclamation has been proposed.\n\n**Hlaing-bwe.** \u2014 River in British Burma. The Hlaing-bwe rises in the northern portion of the Dawna range, and, flowing southward for about 120 miles, unites with the Haung-tharaw at Gyaing, where it has a breadth of 400 yards; at its junction with the Da-gyaing, 42 miles above Gyaing, in lat. 16\u00b0 55' N., and long. 98\u00b0 2' E., it is only 70 yards wide during the rains. The two streams, under the name of the Gyaing river, fall into the Salwin at Maulmain. During the rains the water is muddy, and the current strong and rapid; in the dry season, when the spring tides extend a distance of 70 miles, boats of 500 baskets burden can go up as far as Hlaing-bwe. About 200 yards below the village of Hlaing-bwe, a reef of rocks, which can only be passed at the highest tides, stretches across the river. As far as the mouth of the Da-gyaing, the banks are high and well-defined; farther down, they become low and bordered with scrub forest. The usual halting-places on the way up are Kha-zang, 26 miles from Gyaing, and, in the wet weather, Khyaung-wa, 16 miles higher up.\n\n**Hmaw-bi (Hmaw-bhee).** \u2014 Sub-division of Hanthawadi District, British Burma; lies westward of the Pegu Yomas, in Pegu Division. The Irawadi Valley (State) Railway from Rangoon to Prome crosses Hmaw-bi from south to north, and occupies the great northern military road from Hmaw-bi station. The principal river in the Sub-division is the Hlaing, which, joined by the Pan-hlaing in the south, forms the Rangoon river. In the rains the Hlaing is navigable by steamers for some distance, by boats all the year round as high up as the mouth of the Ye-nek. The Sub-division comprises 15 revenue circles. In 1876 the population was 70,433, and the gross revenue \u00a333,742. Population (1881) 94,155; gross revenue, \u00a344,787.\n\n**Hmaw-bi (Hmaw-bhee).** \u2014 Township in Hmaw-bi Sub-division, Rangoon District, British Burma; extends along the western slopes of the Pegu Yomas, beyond the Hlaing river to the Pan-hlaing, and east and south-east into the Pegu valley. The township consists of three portions, each differing from the others:\u2014(a) West of the Hlaing, the country is flat, and traversed by numerous inter-communicating\nHOCHO\u2014HODAL\n\ntidal creeks, which every second or third year, since the construction of the Irawadi embankments, flood the fields and destroy the crops. There is but little cultivation, and the country is to a great extent covered with open forest and elephant grass. (b) In the tract north of Rangoon, the country consists of undulating ground, which, towards the north-east, rises into hills clothed with trees; the southern parts have been denuded of forest for the supply of fuel to Rangoon. The soil is poor, but rice is extensively grown. (c) East of Rangoon, the country is open, level, and highly cultivated; the soil is rich and productive, but is becoming exhausted, as the fields are allowed no rest, and rotation of crops is not practised. In 1876 the population was 50,487, and the gross revenue \u00a327,259. The total area under cultivation in that year was 97,919 acres. Population (1881) 63,585; total area under cultivation, 119,227 acres, chiefly rice; gross revenue, \u00a331,795. The township is traversed by the Irawadi Valley (State) Railway, with stations at Thamaing, Hlaw-ga, and Hmaw-bi. The head-quarters of the township are at Lein-gun.\n\nHocho (or Hopcho).\u2014River in Kashmir; rises among the snows on the western declivity of the Gantang Pass, Kashmir, in lat. 31\u00b0 38' N., and long. 78\u00b0 48' E. Thus described by Thornton: 'Even near the source, it in some places spreads to a width of 100 yards, and in one part to 200, in another to 300; but it is so shallow as scarcely to cover the pebbles in its bed. In other places it is arched over with snow, or buried under the ruins of cliffs, from which it again bursts out and expands over the plain. The fall, which in the upper part of its course is very gentle, lower down is very rapid, as from its source to the confluence with the Sutlej, a distance of less than 12 miles in a westerly direction, it descends 10,000 feet, and is in general one broken sheet of foam. The mountains bounding its course on each side are precipitous, lofty, and covered with perpetual snow, avalanches of which frequently descend, and, damming the stream, form deep lakes, over the icy embankments of which the river is precipitated with a loud noise.'\n\nHod\u00e1l.\u2014Town in Gurg\u00e1o District, Punjab; situated near the southern confines of the District, on the main road from Delhi to Agra. Population (1868) 7032; (1881) 6453, of whom 4963 were Hindus, 1481 Muhammadans, 2 Jains, and 7 Sikhs; number of houses, 621. A third-class municipality, with an income in 1882\u201383 of \u00a3239; average incidence of taxation, 8\u00bdd. per head of population. Hod\u00e1l is only important as a centre of local trade in country produce, and has no manufactures. Suraj Mall, the J\u00e1t R\u00e1ja of Bhartpur, was connected by marriage with the J\u00e1ts of Hod\u00e1l, and in his time several large and magnificent buildings were erected; but these are now inhabited only by herds of monkeys, and are all in ruins, with the exception of a beautiful square tank surrounded on all sides with\nstone staircases, and some kiosks and temples on the bank. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Hodal formed part of General Du Boigne's jagir, and after their overthrow by Lord Lake in 1803, was given in jagir to Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, on whose death in 1813 it came under direct British rule. The town contains a District rest-house, school, post-office, and police station. The two principal b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are paved and drained, and the horse-breeding department keeps a stud of stallions, both horses and donkeys, here. About half a mile from the town is a tank and copse, with a shrine of R\u00e1dha Krishna held in great repute by the Hindus of the neighbouring Districts, and visited by crowds of pilgrims.\n\nHolalkere.\u2014T\u00e1luk in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State. The region suffered repeatedly from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 inroads. The t\u00e1luk contains 2 criminal courts, 9 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 80 regular police, and 189 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs). Cost of administration (1881), \u00a31495; revenue (1881), \u00a38206.\n\nHolalkere.\u2014Village in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State. Lat. 14\u00b0 3' N., long. 76\u00b0 15' E. Population (1881) 1855. Said to have been founded in the 14th century, it was the first possession of the founder of the powerful p\u00e1g\u00e9rs of Chitaldr\u00fag. Holalkere suffered much during the wars between Haidar Al\u00ed and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.

The t\u00e1luk is crossed from north to south by the Tungabhadra river; on the east and west rise low stony hills. The region was abnormally prosperous owing to an abundant growth of cotton during the epoch of the American War. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 criminal court and 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); regular police, 39 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 233.

The cocoa-nuts are celebrated, and find a market in Bangalore, Dhawar, and the south Maratha country. The milk of the Honavalli cocoa-nuts is called Gangapani, or Ganges water, on account of its coolness and delicate flavour. The Tumkur-Shimoga road intersects the southern portion of the taluk.\n\nHonavalli (from the goddess 'Honnuamma').\u2014Village in Tumkur District, Mysore State. Lat. 13\u00b0 20' N., long. 76\u00b0 24' 45\" E. Population (1881) 1775, of whom many are Brahmins. Celebrated for its groves of cocoa-nut palms. The head-quarters of the Honavalli taluk have recently been removed to Tiptur.\n\nHonawar.\u2014Sub-division of North Kanara District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 446 square miles; contains 2 towns and 128 villages. Population (1881) 85,625, or 42,439 males and 43,186 females; number of houses, 12,588. Hindus numbered 74,153; Muhammadans, 7443; 'others,' 4024. Since 1872, the population has increased by 2758. Mysore bounds the taluk on the east, while its western shore is washed by the Arabian Sea. The Gersoppa river intersects the country, flowing from east to west. The famous Gersoppa Falls are 36 miles south-east of Honawar town. About one-third of the taluk has been surveyed and settled. The incidence of the assessment varies from \u00a31 to \u00a31, 4s. per acre in the case of garden lands; from 11s. to 13s. in the case of rice land; and from 1s. to 1s. 6d. in the case of dry crop land. Communications are easy. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 4 criminal courts; police stations (thandars), 2; regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 16. Land revenue, \u00a315,972.\n\nHonawar (Honore).\u2014Seaport, municipality, and chief town of the Sub-division of Honawar, in North Kanara District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 16' 30\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 29' E., 50 miles south-east of Karwar, on the north of an extensive estuary or inlet of the sea, forming an expanse of salt water, which at its south-eastern extremity receives the Gersoppa or Shirawati, a considerable river flowing from beyond the Western Ghats. Population (1872) 5191, (1881) 6658, of whom 5252 were Hindus, 868 Christians, and 538 Muhammadans. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1873-74\u2014exports, \u00a330,032; imports, \u00a321,499.\nFor the year 1880-81, the value of the exports was \u00a3696,834, and the value of the imports \u00a3249,592. Hon\u00e1war has long possessed a coasting trade of importance, but the trade has grown largely of recent years. The town is mentioned by Abulfeda (1273-1331); and shortly afterwards (1342) is described by Ibn Batuta as rich and well governed, with 23 schools for boys and 13 for girls. At the beginning of the 16th century, it is said to have exported much rice, and to have been frequented by shipping. In 1505, the Portuguese built a fort at Hon\u00e1war; and two years later, in consequence of a dispute with the King of Viz\u00edapur, they attacked and burnt the town. Frederick (1563-81) calls \u2018Onor\u2019 a fort of the Portuguese; and in 1623, De la Valle found it a small place, but still in the hands of the Portuguese. On the decay of the Portuguese power in India, Hon\u00e1war was acquired by the sovereigns of Bedn\u00far; and on the conquest of Bedn\u00far by Haidar Ali, this town also submitted to him. In 1783 it was taken by assault by a British force despatched from Bombay, under the command of General Matthews; and in 1784 was successfully defended by Captain Torriano against Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, to whom, however, in the same year, it was ceded by the treaty of Mangalore. On the overthrow of Tip\u00fa in 1799, it again came into the possession of the British. Visitors to the celebrated falls of Gersoppa halt at Hon\u00e1war to procure boats to take them up the river 18 miles, to the village of Gersoppa. From Gersoppa the journey to the falls, 18 miles, is made by road. The town itself lies about 2 miles from the coast at the mouth of the Gersoppa river, which, with a dangerous bar and an entrance channel about 300 feet broad, expands into a lake 5 miles long, and 1 to 2 miles broad. In the lake are 5 islands, the largest 3 miles long, covered with palm trees. A ship may anchor in the road, with the flagstaff of Hon\u00e1war bearing east by north, about 1\u00bd miles from the shore in 5 to 6 fathoms soft ground.\n\nHongal (Bail Hongal).\u2014Town in Belgaum District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 48' N., long. 74\u00b0 54' E. Population (1872) 9001, (1881) 7806. There are manufactures of coarse cotton cloth and articles of native apparel, some of which are sold in the neighbouring markets, and the remainder exported via Belgaum to the Konk\u00e1n. Hongal is built on rising ground on the eastern side of a fine tank from which is drawn the main water-supply of the inhabitants. The prefix \u2018Bail\u2019 refers to the fact of the town being built in an open black-soil country. The market is celebrated for the superior class of bullocks brought to it for sale. A large annual fair is held, at which wrestlers from the surrounding country assemble.\n\nHonnali.\u2014T\u00e1luk and town of Shimoga District, Mysore State.\u2014See Honalli.\nHonnu-hole (or Suvarn\u00e1vati, both meaning 'Golden Stream').\u2014A tributary of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, which runs through the southeast corner of Mysore District, Mysore State, and joins the K\u00e1veri just within the Madras District of Coimbatore. The Honnu-hole valley is very fertile, the stream being dammed in its short course by 3 permanent anicuts, as well as by many temporary structures, yielding a yearly revenue of more than \u00a33800.\n\nHooghly.\u2014River, District, Sub-division, and town, Bengal.\u2014See HUGLI.\n\nHorsleykonda (or Yenugu Mallama Konda).\u2014Mountain in Kadapa (Cuddapah) District, Madras Presidency.

Practicable for carts as far as Sankarn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, the head of the water communication with the coast.\n\nHosdurg (also called Pudia Kot, or 'New Fort').\u2014Town in South Kanara District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 12\u00b0 18' 29'' N., and long. 75\u00b0 9' 15'' E., 2 miles from the sea, and 42 miles from Cannanore. Population (1881) not returned in the Census, and therefore presumably under 5000. A sub-divisional station with sub-magistrate's court, excellent bungalow, and ruins of a magnificent fort.\n\nHosdurga.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore State. Area, 510 square miles. In 1872 the population was 60,820, and the land revenue, \u00a36884. Population (1881) 38,022, namely, 37,081 Hindus, 855 Muhammadans, 2 Christians, and 184 Jains; land revenue (1881\u201382), exclusive of water rates, \u00a35019. Crops\u2014chol\u00e1, rag\u00ed, and a little cotton. Iron is smelted, and there are workers in brass.\n\nHosdurga.\u2014Village in Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore State; 30 miles south by west of Chitaldr\u00fag. Lat. 13\u00b0 48' 10'' N., long. 76\u00b0 20' E. Population (1881) 1648. Called after a hill fort said to have been erected in 1675, at the northern base of which the present pete or village was added in 1708. Head-quarters of the Hosdurga t\u00e1luk.\n\nHoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014District in the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) Division of the Chief-Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 40' and 22\u00b0 59' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 38' 30'' and 78\u00b0 45' 30'' E. long. Bounded on the north by the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, which separates it from the territories of Bhop\u00e1l, Sindhia, and Holkar; on the east by the Dudhi river, dividing it from Narsinghpur District; on the south by the Districts of Western Ber\u00e1r, Bet\u00fal, and Chhind-\nw\u00e1r\u00e1; and on the west by Nim\u00e1r. Area, 4437 square miles. Population (1881) 488,787. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at HOSHANGABAD TOWN, which is also the most populous place.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d may be generally described as a valley of varying breadth, extending for 150 miles between the river Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and the S\u00e1tpura Mountains. The soil consists chiefly of black basaltic alluvium, often more than 20 feet deep; but along the banks of the Narbad\u00e1 the fertility of the land compensates for the tameness of the scenery. As far west as Handi\u00e1, only an isolated rock breaks at intervals the monotony of the plain. Rich crops of wheat clothe the gentle undulations. At places near the river some woodland tract is shady with young teak trees; but except in the poor sandy soil, not worth cultivating, little or no jungle has been suffered to remain. Beyond Handi\u00e1, the aspect of the country changes. Low stony hills and broken ridges cut up the level ground, while the Vindhyas from the north and the S\u00e1tpuras from the southwest throw out jutting spurs and ranges, along the base of which lie tracts of red earth and rock. Much of the surface here is covered by an alluvial cotton-soil, for the most part very thin; so that a few miles to the west of Hard\u00e1, blocks of granite for the railway works were quarried from a depth of only 6 or 8 feet. In the wilder country to the west of the District, considerable regions are overgrown with jungle. On the south, however, appears the most striking contrast with the champaign country along the Narbad\u00e1. The lofty range which shuts in the valley is remarkable for mountain scenery, surpassing in its picturesque irregularity the Vindhyan chain in the north\u2014a succession of cliffs and abysses. Everywhere huge masses of sandstone stand boldly out, with scarped faces of rock many hundred feet high.\n\nAmid these precipices rise numberless little streams, many of them perennial. Winding through deep glens, and working their way from the mountain spurs, they flow across the plain between sandy banks covered with low jungle, till they swell the waters of the Narbad\u00e1. Such are the Dudhi, Anjan, Denw\u00e1, Ganj\u00e1l, and Moran; the last of which contains a vein of indifferent coal. Such, too, is the T\u00e1wa, so interesting to the geologist. 'At its mouth, the Bij\u00e1war limestone is seen presenting a peculiar structure; the alternating bands of siliceous and calcareous minerals, instead of being plane, are concentric around nuclei of quartz, many of these concentric masses being of great size. A little farther south there is an immense mass of hard quartzose breccia, similar to that seen north of the river north-west of Ch\u00e1ndgarh, composed of purple jasper-like rock, with enclosed angular fragments of quartzite; upon this rest Vindhyan shales, sandy as usual, and passing upwards into the typical quartzite sandstone, which forms hills west of\nthe stream. Higher up, the T\u00e1wa trap comes in; and farther on still, there is a patch of granitoid rock.' None of the above-named streams, however, are of any great importance; and the boundary rivers, the Narbad\u00e1 and the T\u00e1pti, are the only considerable waters in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. At Ch\u00e1rw\u00e1, in the west of the District, a dense low forest extends over a large region; but by far the finest timber is found in the reserved tracts at Bor\u00ed and Denw\u00e1, which were made over to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d from the District of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 in 1865, and are rich in teak and sal. Good building stone is raised from eighteen quarries in the District.\n\nHistory.\u2014Little is known of the history of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d prior to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion. The four Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s who hold the eastern portion of the District derive their title from the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Mandl\u00e1. The central region was subject directly or indirectly to the Gond power at Deogarh; and in the extreme west, the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Makr\u00e1i apparently exercised an extensive independent jurisdiction. In the time of Akbar, Handi\u00e1 was the head-quarters of a sark\u00e1r or District, and was occupied by Mughal troops; Seoni was attached to a Province of Bhop\u00e1l, and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d is not mentioned at all. In all probability the eastern part of the District maintained a rude independence, the imperial power at Delhi not caring to wrest this rugged region from the wild Gond tribes who inhabited it. About 1720 A.D., Dost Muhammad, the founder of the Bhop\u00e1l family, took the town of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and annexed a considerable territory with it, stretching from Seoni to the T\u00e1wa, or even as far as Soh\u00e1gpur. In 1742, the Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, passed up the valley on his way to attack Mandl\u00e1, and seized the opportunity to subdue the Handi\u00e1 parg\u00e1nds, which he succeeded in retaining in his possession. Eight years later, Raghuji Bhonsla, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, overran the whole range of hills from G\u00e1wilgarh to Mah\u00e1deo, and reduced the country east of Handi\u00e1 and south of the Narbad\u00e1, except the portion held by Bhop\u00e1l.\n\nHitherto the rival dynasties of N\u00e1gpur and Bhop\u00e1l had not come into conflict, and the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s in the east still maintained their independence. In 1795, however, a contest was begun by the Bhonslas, which lasted with few intermissions for more than twenty years, and did not cease till it had spread desolation over the face of this fertile valley. The first achievement was that of Ben\u00ed Singh Subahd\u00e1r, one of Raghuji's officers, who captured the town and fort of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, after a sturdy resistance from the Bhop\u00e1l troops. In 1802, however, the Bhonslas lost by an intrigue what it had cost them a two months' siege to gain. The kil\u00e1dd\u00e1r or governor was so alarmed by the representations of the Bhop\u00e1l party, that on the approach of Waz\u00edr Muhammad, then the virtual ruler of Bhop\u00e1l, he gave up the place without striking a blow in its defence. Encouraged by this success,\nand by the occupation of Seoni, Wazir Muhammad proceeded to overrun all the Sohagpur pargan\u00e1, and to lay siege to the fort of Sohagpur itself. Here his good fortune deserted him. The fort was relieved by a force from Seoni Chhapar\u00e1, which defeated Wazir Muhammad with heavy loss. He was hotly pursued as far as Hoshangabad; and, making a stand outside the town, his horse was killed under him. A rude stone figure of a horse still marks the spot. In this emergency, Wazir Muhammad mounted his celebrated tailless charger, Pankhr\u00e1j (whence his name of Band\u00e1 Ghorek\u00e1 Saw\u00e1r), and escaped by leaping him over the battlement of the fort. The Nagpur army, however, failed in their attack upon the fort, and, after vainly besieging it, contented themselves with burning the town. In 1809, Hoshangabad was again assailed by a Nagpur force. The garrison held out for three months; but finding their communications with Bhop\u00e1l cut off, and a battery erected against them on the north side of the river, they surrendered. Overcome by these disasters, Wazir Muhammad called in the Pindari freebooters to his help; and till they were finally extirpated in 1817, the whole of this fertile region became a prey to ravage and massacre. Large tracts of country were laid entirely waste; and everywhere throughout the District the fruits of long years of industry were destroyed and dispersed. Under the order which the British Government has restored, prosperity is gradually returning.\n\nIn 1818, that part of the District which was held by Nagpur was ceded under an agreement, subsequently confirmed by the treaty of 1826. In 1844, the region of Hard\u00e1 Handi\u00e1 was made over by Sindhia at an estimated value of \u00a314,000, in part payment of the Gwalior contingent; and by the treaty of 1860, it was permanently transferred, and became British territory. The Mutiny of 1857 failed to disturb English authority in Hoshangabad. There was some trouble with the police at Hard\u00e1; a petty chief rebelled in the Mah\u00e1deo Hills; and T\u00e1ntia Top\u00ed crossed the valley in 1858.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A rough enumeration in 1866 returned the population of Hoshangabad at 440,433, and a regular Census in 1872 disclosed 450,218 persons, exclusive of the attached feudatory State of Makrai. In 1881, the population, also exclusive of Makr\u00e1i, was returned at 488,787, being an increase of 38,569, or 8\u00b756 per cent., during the nine years since 1872. The results disclosed by the Census of 1881 may be thus briefly summarized:\u2014Area, 4437 square miles; towns and villages, 1536; number of houses, 112,521, of which 102,863 are occupied and 9658 unoccupied. Total population, 488,787, namely, males 252,493, and females 236,294; average density of population, 110 per square mile; towns and villages, '35 per square mile; persons per town or village, 318; houses per square mile, 23\u00b718; inmates per occupied house, 4\u00b775. Classified according to sex and age,\nthere were 82,947 boys and 79,402 girls below 12 years of age; males above 12 years of age numbered 169,546, and females 156,892. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 390,650, or 79'9 per cent. of the District population; Muhammadans, 22,355, or 4'5 per cent.; K\u00e1b\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 3372; Jains, 1725; Sikhs, 4; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 9; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 41; Jews, 5; Christians, 783; tribes still professing aboriginal faiths, 69,840, or 14'3 per cent.; and 'others,' 3. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes, including both Hindus and non-Hindus, are Gonds, 61,009 in 1881; K\u00fark\u00fas, 28,458; Bhils, 6604; Savars, 894; Kols, 375; and Kaw\u00e1rs, 97. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans in 1881 numbered 31,585, and R\u00e1jputs, 54,645; the mass of the Hindu population consisting of\u2014Kurm\u00eds, 20,992; Lodh\u00eds, 7423; Kachh\u00eds, 8938; Ah\u00edrs, 14,717; Balah\u00eds, 24,345; Baniy\u00e1s, 5713; Tell\u00eds, 9186; G\u00fajars, 22,270; Cham\u00e1rs, 17,647; and other inferior castes. The Muhammadan population are divided according to sect into Sunnis, 21,160; Shi\u00e1s, 571; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 32; and 'others,' 592. The Christian population comprises 154 British born, 96 other Europeans, 63 Eurasians, 33 Indo-Portuguese, 337 natives, and 100 unspecified.\n\nThere are only four towns in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District with a population exceeding 5000, viz. HOSHANGABAD, the District headquarters, population (1881) 15,863; HARDA, 11,203; SOHAGPUR, 7027; and SEONI, 6998. Of the 1536 towns and villages comprising the District, 793 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 501 from two to five hundred, 184 from five hundred to a thousand, 45 from one to two thousand, 6 from two to three thousand, 3 from three to five thousand, and 4 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. The four largest towns mentioned above, together with the smaller town of Bab\u00e1i (population, 3818), are the only municipalities in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d; they have a total population within municipal limits of 44,919, or nearly 10 per cent. of the District population. As regards occupation, the male population are divided by the Census Report of 1881 into the following six main classes:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government officials of every sort, and the learned professions, 6886; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 2698; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 5438; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 95,849; (5) industrial class, including manufacturers and artisans, 34,610; (6) industrial and non-productive, comprising general labourers, male children, and unspecified, 107,012.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4437 square miles, only 2533 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 1330 square miles are returned as under cultivation, 680 square miles as cultivable, and 523 square miles as uncultivable waste. Wheat forms the staple crop of the District. The rich black soil of the valley\nthrows up a rank abundance of weeds, which cannot be rooted up before the dry season; and consequently this soil is devoted almost entirely to cereals. These are raised without manure or irrigation; rotation of crops is not resorted to, nor is the land allowed to remain fallow. Only garden crops and sugar-cane are manured and watered. Since the American Civil War, cotton has been raised in increasing quantities on the higher soils. The approximate area under the different crops (including land twice cropped) is returned as follows:\u2014Rice, 11,369 acres; wheat, 592,837; other food-grains, 268,902; oil-seeds, 58,216; sugar-cane, 649; cotton, 12,885; other fibres, 726; tobacco, 1344; vegetables, 2280; and miscellaneous, 5444 acres. The oxen bred in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d are stout beasts, useful for heavy draught and for ploughing the deep black soil, but much inferior in pace and activity to the small Ber\u00e1r bullocks. Sheep and goats come principally from Bundelkhand. Agricultural stock (approximate)\u2014cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 336,133; horses, 894; ponies, 7329; donkeys, 2822; sheep and goats, 21,705; pigs, 2176; carts, 21,678; ploughs, 31,959. The Census of 1881 showed a total of 2635 proprietors. The tenants numbered 94,478, of whom 15,641 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while 25,819 were tenants-at-will or of unspecified status. The remaining tenants consisted chiefly of assistants in home cultivation, 50,213, or of sub-tenants or cultivators holding land on a produce-sharing tenure. Agricultural labourers, including field servants and herdsmen, numbered 46,572. The total adult agriculturists numbered 144,278, or 29\u00b752 per cent. of the District population, the average proportion of cultivated and cultivable land being 10 acres for each adult agriculturist. Total Government revenue, including cesses and local rates levied on land, \u00a346,315, or an average of 1s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; total rental paid by the cultivators, \u00a3133,073, or an average of 2s. 11\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.\n\nIn this District, as throughout the Narbad\u00e1 valley, some estates have for generations belonged to petty chiefs, who have retained their ancestral domains through all the changes of times and dynasties down to the present day. Such are the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Fatehpur and Sobh\u00e1pur, whose title dates back to the Gond princes of Mandl\u00e1. For many generations, also, the petty hill chiefs in the Mah\u00e1deo Hills maintained a semi-independence of the rulers of Deogarh and N\u00e1gpur. But in 1818, when they raised their clans in support of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, they were thoroughly subdued by the British troops. The English agents, however, continued the policy of maintaining these talukd\u00e1rs in their rights; and upon the recommendation of Sir R. Temple, late Chief Commissioner, the Government formally confirmed them in this position\u2014with the exception of the sam\u00ednndr of R\u00e1ikher\u00ed, whose lands were confiscated in consequence of his share in the rebellion of 1858.\nThe rent rates per acre for different crops were returned as follows in 1882-83:\u2014Wheat, 3s. 3d.; rice, 3s. 7d.; inferior grain, 1s. 4\u00bdd.; cotton, 3s. 10\u00bdd.; sugar-cane, 7s. 8\u00bdd.; oil-seeds, 1s. 7\u00bdd.; fibres, 1s. 6\u00bdd.; and tobacco, 5s. 4d. per acre. The average produce per acre in lbs. was\u2014wheat, 400; rice, 320; inferior grain, 440; cotton (cleaned), 26; sugar (gur), 490; oil-seeds, 240; fibres, 180; and tobacco, 180 lbs. The ordinary prices of produce are as follow:\u2014Wheat, 5s. 3d. a cwt.; cotton, 31s. a cwt.; refined sugar, 11s. a cwt. The wages per diem of skilled labour average 1s., of unskilled labour, 6d.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014There are no manufactures of any note, and merely the ordinary handicrafts. The workers in brass have a local reputation. The coarser fabrics worn by the peasantry are still mainly supplied by the weavers of the District; although, since the demand for cotton in 1863-64 raised the price of the raw material, a large number of looms have ceased working. Hoshangabad does a considerable export trade in agricultural produce, receiving in return English piece-goods, spices, and cocoa-nuts from the west, salt from Bombay, and sugar by way of Mirzapur from the east. Owing to the opening of the railway, the trade of the District now tends to take the direction of Bombay.\n\nThe length of made roads in Hoshangabad is returned at 498 miles. The high-road to Bombay, which runs through the District from east to west, is only aligned in parts, and only partially embanked or drained. The line from Hoshangabad towards Betul, which passes the railway station at Itarsi, is the best road in the District. That from Harda to Handia, the old high-road from the Deccan to Agra in the days of the Mughals, is little better than a well-defined track; while the other roads in the District are merely fair-weather routes, of which those from Seoni and Harda towards Betul are perhaps the best. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway intersects the whole District from west to east, with stations at Bankheri, Alakheri, Piparia, Sohagpur, Seoni, Bagra, Rampur, Harshi, Dularia, Dharmkundi, Pagdhali, Timarni, Harda, Bhiringi, Khirkiyan, and Harsud. It crosses the Tawa by a viaduct at the opening of the gorge through which the river issues from the Satpuras; and a short tunnel carries it under a projection of the hill close by. The Bhopal State Railway, which was opened for traffic in May 1882, crosses the District from north to south from Hoshangabad town to Itarsi, where it joins the Great Indian Peninsula Railway system. Total length of railway communication, 175 miles. Besides roads and railways, the Narbad, Tawa, Denwa, and Ganjal supply means of communication by water for 150 miles during part of the year.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Hoshangabad was formed into a separate\nDistrict of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsildars. Total revenue in 1876\u201377, \u00a369,842, of which the land revenue yielded \u00a342,813. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a314,733. By 1882\u201383, the total revenue of the District had increased to \u00a385,991, and the land revenue to \u00a344,712. Total cost of officials and police of all kinds in 1882\u201383, \u00a315,844. Number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 13; magistrates, 17. Maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 55 miles; average distance, 14 miles. Number of police, 621 men, costing \u00a37568; being 1 policeman to about every 8 square miles and to every 779 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in the year 1882 was 118, of whom 8 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection in 1882 was 97, attended by 4495 pupils. This is exclusive of uninspected indigenous schools, for which no returns are available. The Census Report of 1881 returned 5243 boys and 132 girls as under instruction, besides 13,442 males and 281 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District contained five municipalities in 1882\u2014Hoshangabad, Seoni, Harda, Sohagpur, and Baba, with a total population of 44,919. Total municipal income, \u00a37293, of which \u00a36217 was derived from octroi and other taxes; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 9\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District is generally free from violent alternations of temperature; hot winds are rare, and the nights during the sultry weather and rains are always cool. The cold weather is seldom severe. In 1882, the temperature in the shade at the civil station, Hoshangabad, was recorded as follows:\u2014May, highest reading, 110\u00b78\u00b0 F., lowest 74\u00b0; July, highest reading 87\u00b74\u00b0, lowest 72\u00b0; December, highest reading 84\u00b0, lowest 50\u00b0. The rainfall is exceedingly variable, ranging between the limits of 40 and 60 inches in the year, the average for the 25 years ending 1881 being 46\u00b728 inches. In 1882 it was 58\u00b717 inches, or 11\u00b789 inches above the average. The winter rains, however, are very regular; and, according to a local tradition, there have been famines from too much rain, but never from drought. Owing to its position as a long valley between two great mountain ranges, Hoshangabad is subject to violent atmospheric influences; and the harvest is seldom gathered without hailstorms and thunder-showers. The prevailing diseases of the District are fevers and bowel complaints. In 1882, six charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 37,361 in-door and out-door patients. In 1882, the total registered deaths numbered 13,017, or 29\u00b733 per thousand of the population. During the five previous years, the reported deaths per annum averaged 26\u00b789 per thousand. [For further\ninformation regarding Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, see the Settlement Report of Mr. C. A. Elliott, the operations of which extended from April 1855 to November 1857, and from July 1859 to March 1866; also the Gazetteer of the Central Provinces, by Charles Grant, Esq., C.S.I., pp. 206-217 (N\u00e1gpur, 1870); and the Annual Administration and Departmental Reports for the Central Provinces from 1880 to 1883.\n\nHoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014North-eastern tahsil or Sub-division of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 41' and 22\u00b0 59' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 38' and 78\u00b0 44' E. long. Area (1881), 890 square miles, with 1 town and 353 villages; number of houses, 31,742. Total population, 152,182, namely, males 78,769, and females 73,413; average density per square mile, 171; number of persons per village, 430; persons per house, 4\u00b78. The total adult agriculturists numbered 44,805, or 29\u00b744 per cent. of the tahsil population, the average area of cultivated and cultivable land being 9 acres per adult agriculturist. Of the total area of 890 square miles, 738 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of this assessed area, 407 square miles are returned as cultivated, 194 square miles as cultivable, and 137 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local cesses and rates levied upon the land, \u00a315,041, or an average of 1s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; total rental, including cesses, etc. paid by the cultivators, \u00a340,229, or an average of 2s. 11\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The tahsil contains 5 civil and 8 criminal courts, including the head-quarter courts of the District; number of police stations, 3, with 7 outposts; strength of regular police, 143 men.\n\nHoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Chief town and head-quarters station of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces. Lat. 20\u00b0 45' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 46' E. Situated on the south side of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), on the road from Bhop\u00e1l to Bet\u00fal and N\u00e1gpur, and the high-road to Bombay, though the greater part of the through traffic passes by a shorter route 5 miles to the south. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway lies 11 miles off, the nearest station being It\u00e1rs\u00ed on the Bet\u00fal road. Since 1882, the Bhop\u00e1l State Railway has connected Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d town with It\u00e1rs\u00ed. Population (1877) 11,613; (1881) 15,863, namely, males 8744, and females 7119. Hindus numbered 11,700; Muhammadans, 3551; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 4; Christians, 279; Jains, 278; Jews, 2; and non-Hindu aborigines, 49. The supposed founder, Hoshang Sh\u00e1h, the second of the Ghor\u00ed kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 (referred by Prinsep to A.D. 1405), died and was buried in the town, but his bones were subsequently removed to M\u00e1nd\u00fa. Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d remained insignificant till the Bhop\u00e1l conquest, about 1720, when a massive stone fort was constructed, with its base on the river, commanding the Bhop\u00e1l road. It sustained several sieges, and passed alternately into the hands of the Bhop\u00e1l and N\u00e1gpur troops (see\nHOSHANGABAD DISTRICT). The materials have since been mostly removed piecemeal. In 1817, General Adams occupied the town, and threw up some earthworks outside it. From 1818, Hoshangabad has been the residence of the chief British official in charge of the District, and lately it has been made the head-quarters of the Narbad\u00e1 Division. A church has been built. The town contains a main and a branch dispensary, and school-houses and jail. It forms the chief seat of the English piece-goods trade in the District, and does a brisk business in cotton, grain, etc., by means of bills of exchange. A good bazaar, with some petty shops, at which European articles are sold. The wing of a Native Infantry regiment is stationed here. The municipal income of the town in 1882 amounted to \u00a32415, of which \u00a31939 was derived from octroi and other taxes; average incidence of taxation, rs. 5\u00bdd. per head.\n\nHoshiarpur.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 58' and 32\u00b0 5' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 31' and 76\u00b0 41' E. long. Hoshiarpur forms the central District of the Jalandhar (Jullundur) Division. It stands twenty-second in order of area and fourth in order of population among the thirty-two Districts of the Punjab, comprising 2\u00b704 per cent. of the total area and 4\u00b779 per cent. of the total population of the British Districts. It is bounded on the north-east by the District of Kangra and the Native State of Bilaspur; on the north-west by the river Beas (Bi\u00e1s), separating it from Gurdaspur District; on the south-west by Jalandhar (Jullundur) District and Kapurthala State; and on the south by the river Sutlej (Satlaj) and Ambala (Umballa) District. Area, 2180 square miles. Population (1881) 901,381 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of HOSHIARPUR.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Hoshiarpur falls into two nearly equal portions of hill and plain country. Its eastern face consists of the westward slope of the Kangra mountains, a range of the outer Himalayan system. Parallel with that great ridge, a line of lower heights, which orographically may be regarded as a continuation of the Siwalik chain in Nahan and the Gangetic Doab, traverses the District from north-west to south-east; while between the two chains lies a valley of uneven width, known as the Jaswan Dun. The external or Siwalik range, which composes the backbone of the District, belongs geologically to the tertiary system, being mainly formed of sand here and there hardened into stone and conglomerate; while orographically it may be regarded as a continuation of the Siwalik chain in Nahan and the Gangetic Doab. It consists in its southern portion of sandy hillocks, opening out into undulating plateaux, which rarely permit of cultivation. Northward, the table-lands split up into broken spurs, still perfectly barren, or interspersed with patches of forest. As the range subsides\nnear its northern extremity towards the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), the sandy levels pass into a stony but cultivable soil. Towards the middle of its length, but nearer the Sutlej, the range spreads into a broad stretch of uplands, well cultivated, called Bet M\u00e1nasw\u00e1l, consisting of 22 villages, the holding of an ancient house of Dodh R\u00e1jputs, the R\u00e1n\u00e1s of M\u00e1nasw\u00e1l. A considerable portion of the tract is still held in j\u00e1gir by the representative of the line.\n\nEast of this long Siw\u00e1lik ridge, the open valley of the Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan corresponds to the Khi\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan of N\u00e1han and the Dehra D\u00fan of the Gangetic uplands. Its upper portion is traversed by the So\u00e1n torrent; while the Sutlej (Satlaj) sweeps into its lower end by a break in the hills a few miles south of Una, and flows in a southerly direction till it turns the flank of the Siw\u00e1lik range, and debouches westward upon the plains. The Him\u00e1layan shoulders which shut in the Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan to the east are the Chintpurni range, and the ranges of K\u00e1ngra District and Bil\u00e1spur State.\n\nWestward from the foot of the Siw\u00e1lik hills stretches the plain portion of the District. It consists throughout of alluvial formation, with a gentle westerly slope, produced by the deposit of silt from the mountain torrents in the submontane tract. Near the hills, sand covers a great part of the face of the country; but in the lower slopes a rich soil occurs, fertilized by the fresh loam and by the general moisture of the climate. The Beas (Bi\u00e1s), on the extreme north-west, has a fringe of lowland (kh\u00e1dar), exposed to moderate but not excessive inundations, and considered as fertile as any similar tract along the river bank. Here large areas produce two crops a year\u2014wheat in the spring, and Indian corn in the autumn; while sugar-cane and tobacco flourish on the rich soil of mingled sand and loam.\n\nOf the two great boundary rivers of the District, the Sutlej on passing through the Bil\u00e1spur hills strikes the Siw\u00e1lik range and turns southwards, running between steep banks, but having a narrow fringe of highly-cultivated soil on either side. After passing the extremity of the Siw\u00e1lik hills, it turns sharply westward, and for about 16 miles forms the boundary between Hoshi\u00e1rpur and Amb\u00e1la. The river-bed is sandy with occasional rapids caused by boulders in the upper part of its course. Lower down it becomes navigable, and is crossed by seven ferries.\n\nThe Beas, when it meets the Siw\u00e1lik range after issuing from the Him\u00e1layas, curves northward, forming for some distance the north boundary of the District; then, sweeping round the base of the hills, it flows almost south, forming the western boundary of the District, separating it from Gurd\u00e1spur. It is fringed throughout by a fertile strip of alluvial soil, similar to that of the Sutlej. The channel is broad and ill-defined, full of islands, and expanding into wide pools.\nThe depth of the main stream is about 5 feet in the dry season, swelling to 15 in the rains. In the cold weather, the river is fordable in many places, but the fords are dangerous on account of quicksands. The river is not bridged in this part of its course, but is crossed by eight ferries. Between the town of Dasuha and the Beas is a long tract of marsh land known as *chamb*, of an average breadth of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile, running parallel with the course of the Beas for several miles, and probably marking an ancient bed of the river. The best rice is grown in this bog, but it is only of late years that any part of it has been brought under cultivation, and parts of it are even now unreclaimed, the water being so inexhaustible that the soil affords no footing. Parts of the marsh afford excellent grazing ground for cattle, a great drawback, however, to its utilization in this respect being the enormous number of leeches which are found in the grass as well as in the water.\n\nThere are no Government canals in the District, but an old cut constructed in the early part of last century passes through the northern corner, and irrigates portions of 70 villages. At the time of annexation this canal had become almost choked by accumulations of silt, and had fallen into disuse. Its subsequent clearance was effected by the voluntary efforts of the villagers, in whom the entire control of the canal is now vested. The expenses of maintenance and repairs are defrayed by a rate levied by a committee of villagers.\n\nThere are six demarcated Government forest reserves in the District, called Panj\u00e1l, Loh\u00e1ra, Bindr\u00e1ban, Karampur, Darni, and Gagriw\u00e1l, aggregating 148 square miles. The two first named, situated in the Chintpurni range, principally consist of *chil* (Pinus longifolia); and the third and fourth, occupying the extreme northern spurs of the Siw\u00e1lik hills, are composed entirely of bamboo. Groves of fine mango trees are common, especially towards the Beas. Gold is found in insignificant quantities in the bed of the Soh\u00e1n stream. Limestone is quarried at Bahr\u00e1mpur, near Garhshankar. Saltpetre, obtained from saline earth, is manufactured in many parts. The wild animals of the District include leopards, hy\u00e6nas, wolves, antelopes, deer, etc. Feathered game is plentiful.\n\n**History.**\u2014Before the advent of the Muhammadans, the country around Hoshi\u00e1rpur formed part of the Katoch kingdom of Jal\u00e1ndhar (Jullundur). When that ancient R\u00e1jput State broke up into minor principalities, the present District was partially divided between the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jasw\u00e1n and Dit\u00e1rpur, both of Katoch descent. The origin of the former kingdom dates back beyond the dawn of the historic period; but the foundation of Dit\u00e1rpur took place as recently as the 16th century. At that time, according to tradition, the Katoch princes of K\u00e1ngra treacherously occupied the submontane country of Hoshi\u00e1rpur, and fixed their capital at Dit\u00e1rpur. The native R\u00e1j\u00e1s of the two petty\nStates, Jasw\u00e1n and Dit\u00e1rpur, retained undisturbed possession of their territories until A.D. 1759, when the rising Sikh chieftains, who had already established themselves in the lowlands, commenced a series of encroachments upon the hill tracts. The Jasw\u00e1n R\u00e1j\u00e1 early lost a portion of his dominions; and when Ranjit Singh concentrated the whole Sikh power under his own government, both the petty Katoch chiefs were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Lahore. At last, in 1815, the aggressive Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 forced the ruler of Jasw\u00e1n to resign his territories in exchange for an estate held on feudal tenure (j\u00e1gtr); while three years later his neighbour of Dit\u00e1rpur met with similar treatment. Meanwhile, the lowland portion of the District had also passed into the hands of Sikh adventurers, who ultimately fell, like their brethren, before the absorbing power of Ranjit Singh. By the close of the year 1818, the whole country from the Sutlej to the Beas had come under the Government of Lahore. A small portion of the District was administered by deputies of the Sikh governors at Jalandhar; but in the hills and the Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan, Ranjit Singh assigned most of his conquests to feudal rulers (j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs), amongst whom were the deposed R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Dit\u00e1rpur and Jasw\u00e1n, the Sodhis of Anandpur, and the Sikh priest, Bedi Bikrama Singh, whose head-quarters were fixed at Una. Below the Siwalik hills, Sher Singh (afterwards Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1) held H\u00e1jipur and Muker\u00edan, with a large tract of country; while other great tributaries received assignments elsewhere in the lowland region. Shaikh Sandhe Kh\u00e1n (now an honorary magistrate at Lahore) had charge of Hoshi\u00e1rpur at the date of the British annexation, as deputy of the Jalandhar governor.\n\nAfter the close of the first Sikh war in 1846, the whole tongue of land between the Sutlej and the Beas, together with the hills now constituting Kangra District, passed into the hands of our Government. The deposed R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Dit\u00e1rpur and Jasw\u00e1n received cash pensions from the new rulers, in addition to the estates granted by Ranjit Singh; but they expressed bitter disappointment that they were not restored to their former sovereign positions. The whole of Bedi Bikrama Singh's grant was resumed, and a pension was offered for his maintenance, but indignantly refused; while part of the Sodhi estates were also taken back. Accordingly, the outbreak of the M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) war and the revolt of Chattar Singh, in 1848, found the disaffected chieftains ready for rebellion, and gave them an opportunity for rising against the British power. In connection with the Kangra R\u00e1j\u00e1s, they organized a revolt, which, however, was soon put down without serious difficulty. The two R\u00e1j\u00e1s and the other ringleaders fell into our hands, and their estates were confiscated. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat Singh of Dit\u00e1rpur lived for about 30 years at Benares on a pension from the British Government. Umed Singh of Jasw\u00e1n received\na similar allowance; and his grandson, R\u00e1n Singh, was permitted to reside at Jammu (Jumboo), in receipt of his pension; while on the assumption by Her Majesty of the imperial title in January 1877, the j\u00e9gar confiscated in 1848 was restored to Tikka Ragn\u00e1th Singh, great-grandson of the rebel R\u00e1j\u00e1 Umed Singh, and son-in-law of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashmir. Bedi Bikrama Singh followed Chattar Singh at Guzerat, but surrendered at the close of the war, and obtained leave to reside at Amritsar. His son, Suj\u00e1n Singh, also receives a Government pension, and has been created an honorary magistrate. Numerous other local chieftains still retain estates in the District, the most noticeable being the R\u00e1n\u00e1s of M\u00e1nasw\u00e1l and the R\u00e1s\u00eds of Bibhor. The sacred family of the Sodhis, lineal descendants of R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, the fourth Sikh Guru, enjoy considerable pensions.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1868, taken on an area corresponding to the present District, and allowing for subsequent changes and transfers, disclosed a total population of 937,699 persons, distributed among 2184 villages or townships, and inhabiting 208,050 houses. The last Census, in 1881, returned the population of Hoshi\u00e1rpur at 901,381, showing a decrease of 36,318, or 3\u00b787 per cent. in the thirteen years. These 901,381 persons were spread over an area of 2180 square miles, residing in 2093 villages or towns, and inhabiting 156,096 houses. Males numbered 481,526, and females 419,855; proportion of males, 53\u00b730 per cent. Persons per square mile, 413; villages per square mile, '96; houses per square mile, 93; persons per village, 431; persons per house, 5\u00b777. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 550,185, or 61\u00b704 per cent.; Muhammadans, 290,193, or 32\u00b720 per cent.; Sikhs, 59,784, or 6\u00b763 per cent.; Jains, 1119, or '13 per cent.; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2; Christians and \u2018others,\u2019 98. The ethnical division shows the following results:\u2014Among the Hindus and Sikhs, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 77,412; R\u00e1jputs, 55,180; Kshattriyas, 19,750; Baniy\u00e1s, 1591; J\u00e1ts, 115,748; G\u00fajars, 23,411: among the Muhammadans, there were\u2014Sayyids, 4060; Mughals, 1400; Path\u00e1ns, 7514; Shaikhs, 6833; R\u00e1jputs, 46,183; J\u00e1ts, 29,980; and G\u00fajars, 44,889.\n\nThe J\u00e1ts form the most numerous tribe in the District. They abound in the plains, both Muhammadans and Hindus, and are excellent cultivators. The R\u00e1jputs, as cultivators, are inferior to the J\u00e1ts, generally letting out their small farms to tenants, and living on a bare pittance of rent. The Siw\u00e1lik chain makes a line of demarcation between the two great creeds; the R\u00e1jputs of the hills and the Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan retain the faith of their ancestors, those of the plain have generally adopted Isl\u00e1m. The Br\u00e1hmans engage for the most part in agriculture or trade, but some are extensive landholders. The G\u00fajars, both Muhammadans and Hindus, are principally found in the hills or in the lowlands of the Beas and Sutlej. They are\nindifferent cultivators, but devote their attention to grazing. The Path\u00e1ns include many important families, and own several villages, but they do not excel as cultivators.\n\nThe 2093 villages or towns are thus classified in the Census Report\u2014less than two hundred inhabitants, 791; from two to five hundred, 751; from five hundred to a thousand, 375; from one to two thousand, 142; from two to three thousand, 20; from three to five thousand, 7; from five to ten thousand, 6; from twenty to fifty thousand, 1. The District contained 9 municipalities in 1881, namely, HOSHIARPUR (population, 21,363), URMAR TANDA (7120), MUKERIAN (4116), DASUYA (6248), ANANDPUR (5878), HARIANA (6472), GARHDIWALA (3438), UNA (4389), and MIANI (6499). The Census of 1881 also returns the population of GARHSHANKAR at 5275.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report classified the adult male population as follows:\u2014Class (1) professional, 12,451; Class (2) domestic, 11,278; Class (3) commercial, 6007; Class (4) agricultural and pastoral, 171,559; Class (5) manufacturing and industrial, 80,725; Class (6) indefinite and non-productive, 17,413; Class (7) unspecified, 1375.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The cultivated area in 1880 amounted to 782,983 acres, out of a total assessed area of 1,395,061 acres. The plain portion of the District differs little in its agricultural capabilities from the neighbouring lowlands of Jalandhar (Jullundur), the only peculiarity being that rice is more largely grown in Hoshiarpur, owing to the abundance of marshy flats along the banks of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) and in the beds of the Siw\u00e1lik torrents. The other staple food-grains comprise wheat, barley, gram, and maize. Millet (jodr) is chiefly grown for fodder, being cut while green. Sugar-cane is produced as a commercial crop, in quantities sufficient for exportation; but the cotton grown does not exceed the local demand. Fibres and indigo form unimportant items of the harvest; tobacco is raised for the supply of the hill tract. The estimated area under the principal crops in 1880\u201381 was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 331,756 acres; rice, 32,772; jodr, 38,922; bajra, 14,189; Indian corn, 100,517; barley, 31,652; gram, 31,981; moth, 29,262; mash, 17,628; mas\u00far, 14,204; tobacco, 4451; oil-seeds, 20,837; cotton, 20,622; hemp, 6732; safflower, 9559; indigo, 333; sugar-cane, 35,637; and vegetables, 2421 acres. The state of agricultural knowledge is very backward. The implements are of the simplest description: manure is employed only in the immediate vicinity of towns and villages, the ground is often overworked, and the cattle are of the poorest sort. Only 20,548 acres are returned as under irrigation, chiefly from an old canal in the northern corner. Nevertheless, improvements make slow but steady progress, the use of manure becoming more frequent, and the area under the superior crops increasing from year to year. In the hill portion of the District, most\nof the land still remains the property of joint shareholders; but in the plains the communal tenure has generally given way to several ownership. More than half the tenants possess rights of occupancy.\n\nThe agricultural stock in the District was approximately estimated as follows in 1879:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 334,099; horses, 4336; ponies, 3534; donkeys, 6256; sheep and goats, 108,953; pigs, 100; camels, 530; ploughs, 112,835. Rates of rent vary with the crops which the soil is fitted to produce. Rice lands bring in from 4s. 0\u00bdd. to \u00a32, 1s. 9d. per acre; wheat lands from 8\u00bdd. (worst dry soil) to \u00a32, 17s. (best irrigated); sugar-cane and tobacco lands rise as high as \u00a35, 14s. Cash wages are almost unknown, except in the immediate vicinity of the towns; and they seldom exceed 3d. per diem for unskilled, or 9d. for skilled labour. In villages, labourers receive payment in kind,\u2014during harvest, a sheaf of corn daily in addition to their food; at other seasons, their food alone. Prices of agricultural produce ruled as follows in January 1881:\u2014Wheat, 17\u00bd sers per rupee, or 6s. 4d. per cwt.; flour, 15\u00bd sers per rupee, or 7s. 3d. per cwt.; barley, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; jadri, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; bajra, 18 sers per rupee, or 6s. 3d. per cwt.; rice (best), 6 sers per rupee, or 18s. 8d. per cwt.; cotton (cleaned) and sugar (refined), 2\u00bd sers per rupee, or \u00a32, 4s. 9d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of Hoshiarpur is chiefly confined to its raw materials, including grain, sugar, hemp, safflower, fibres, tobacco, indigo, cotton, and lac. Of these, sugar forms by far the most important commercial item. The cane grows in various portions of the plains, and the sugar is refined in the larger towns, and exported to all parts of the Punjab, and especially to Amritsar. The grain produced scarcely exceeds the local demand, and the surplus is not exported at once, but hoarded up against the occurrence of famine in less favoured Districts, when it is sent to the most favourable market. The manufactures comprise scarves (l\u00fangis) and all kinds of native cotton fabrics, shoes, rope, and blankets. The cotton goods trade is of some importance, amounting in one suburb of Hoshiarpur (Kh\u00e1npur) to the value of from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 per annum. There is also a trade in lacquered (wooden) ware, and articles ornamented with inlaid ivory. Woollen carpets are manufactured in a School of Industry. A great religious fair at Anandpur, the head-quarters of the Nihang sect of Sikhs, attracts an enormous concourse of people. The Mukerian fair draws together about 40,000 visitors; and the three at Chintpurni, 15,000, 50,000, and 55,000 respectively. The District contains no railway or telegraph. The Jalandhar and Kangra road, which crosses the Siwaliks and the Jaswan D\u00fan, forms the chief route; and fair roads connect Hoshiarpur and other centres with the neighbouring towns.\nIn 1880, there were 16 miles of metalled and 697 miles of unmetalled roads. Water communication is afforded by 60 miles of navigable rivers. The only printing establishment in the District is a lithographic press at the head-quarters town.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014In 1851-52, the total imperial revenue amounted to \u00a3125,546. By 1880-81, it had risen to \u00a3158,366; of which sum the land-tax contributed \u00a3125,019, or slightly less than five-sixths. The only other item of importance is that of stamps. In addition to this amount, a local revenue is raised for expenditure on works of public utility within the District. The incidence of the land revenue per acre is higher in Hoshiarpur than in any other Punjab District, except Jalandhar (Jullundur). During 1880-81, 20 civil and revenue judges and 15 magistrates exercised jurisdiction in the District. The regular or imperial police force in 1881 consisted of a total force of 398 officers and men, of whom 302 were available for protective and detective purposes, the remainder being employed as guards over jails, treasuries, and as escorts, etc. A municipal and ferry police force of 100 men is also maintained. In 1881, the police investigated 803 'cognisable' cases, of which convictions were obtained in 299. In these cases, 658 persons were placed upon trial, of whom 416 were finally convicted. The village watchmen (chaukidars) numbered 1680 men. The District jail at Hoshiarpur received 724 prisoners in 1881; daily average, 33\u00bd.\n\nState education was carried on in 1881 by means of 97 schools, having a joint roll of 5081 pupils. This is independent of unaided and indigenous village schools; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 8112 boys and 65 girls as under instruction, besides 25,009 males and 166 females able to read and write but not under instruction. The girls' school in connection with the Hoshiarpur Mission had 57 pupils on the roll in July 1883. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is divided into 4 tahsils, comprising 2093 villages. The revenue of the 9 municipalities in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a35145, or 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\n**Medical Aspects.**\u2014The District, owing to its proximity to the hills, possesses a comparatively cool and humid climate; but no record of temperature exists. The annual rainfall for a period of 22 years ending 1881 was 35.83 inches. Malarious fever prevails in an endemic form, and cholera occasionally appears as an epidemic. Bowel complaints also cause much mortality. The total number of deaths recorded in 1881 amounted to 27,694, or 30 per thousand of the population. There are charitable dispensaries at Hoshiarpur, Dastiya, Una, Garhshankar, Anandpur, and Tanda, which in 1881 afforded medical relief to 51,354 persons, of whom 1027 were in-door patients. [For further information regarding Hoshiarpur, see the Settlement Report of 1882 by\nMr. C. A. Roe. Also the District Gazetteer, published by the Punjab Government; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the Administration and Departmental Reports of the Province from 1880 to 1883.\n\nHoshiarpur.\u2014Central tahsil of Hoshiarpur District, Punjab, consisting chiefly of a fertile and well-watered plain; lying between $31^\\circ 15' 30''$ and $31^\\circ 40' N.$ lat., and between $75^\\circ 47' 30''$ and $76^\\circ 12' E.$ long. Area, 478 square miles; number of villages, 504. Population (1868) 250,936; (1881) 239,486, namely, males 127,101, and females 112,385, showing a decrease of 10,450, or 4.16 per cent., during the thirteen years ending 1881. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881:\u2014Hindus, 117,831; Muhammadans, 104,941; Sikhs, 16,199; and 'others,' 515. Average density of population, 501 per square mile. Total revenue of the tahsil (1883), \u00a333,452. The administrative staff consists of 1 Deputy Commissioner, 1 Judicial Assistant, 3 Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsildar, and 3 munisfs. These officers preside over 9 civil and revenue and 6 criminal courts. Number of police circles (thands), 3; strength of regular police, 111 men, besides 435 village watchmen (chaukidars).\n\nHoshiarpur.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Hoshiarpur District, Punjab. Lat. $31^\\circ 32' 13'' N.$, long. $75^\\circ 57' 17'' E.$ Situated on the bank of a broad sandy bed of a torrent, about 5 miles from the foot of the Siwalik Hills. Population (1868) 20,868; (1881) 21,363, namely, 9968 Hindus, 10,641 Muhammadans, 290 Sikhs, 405 Jains, and 59 'others.' Founded, according to tradition, about the early part of the 14th century. Occupied during the Sikh period by the chiefs of the Faisalpuria confederacy, from whom it was taken by Ranjit Singh in 1809. The Maharaja and his successors maintained a considerable cantonment 1 mile south-east of the town; and the British Government continued to keep it up for several years after the annexation. The cantonments were abandoned after the mutiny, and all that now remains are a few ruined houses, a cemetery, and a roofless church. Floods from the neighbouring torrent frequently threaten the town, although the stream now sets towards the station with less vehemence than previously. A large embankment or bandh to protect the town was constructed in 1853, but was carried away by the rains of 1854 and the masonry piers were engulfed in the sand. The smaller streets consist chiefly of narrow culs-de-sac, but several broad thoroughfares traverse the town. The civil station, situated about a mile from the native town, contains the District court-house and treasury, tahsil and police offices, dispensary, staging bungalow, and sardi. Both station and town are plentifully wooded, and enjoy a good sanitary reputation. Trade in grain, sugar, and tobacco. Manufacture of country cloth, inlaid wood-work, shoes, brass and copper vessels, and lac. Imitation Persian carpets are also made at the\nIndustrial School. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, chiefly from octroi, \u00a32977; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 10\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Hoskot.\u2014Taluk** in the east of Bangalore District, Mysore State. Area, 401 square miles. In 1872, the population was 69,885, and the land revenue, \u00a38783. Population (1881) 54,574, namely, 2915 Muhammadans, 51,538 Hindus, and 121 Christians; land revenue (1883), exclusive of water rates, \u00a312,760. Mostly an open country. The taluk contains 1 criminal court; number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 8; regular police, 63 men; village watch (chaukidd\u00e1rs), 142.\n\n**Hoskot (Hosa-Kot, 'New Fort').\u2014Town** in Bangalore District, Mysore State, and head-quarters of Hoskot taluk; situated on the left bank of the South Pin\u00e1kini river, 18 miles north-east of Bangalore city, on the Bangalore-Kolar road. Lat. 13\u00b0 4' 50\" N., long. 77\u00b0 49' 40\" E. Population (1881) 4377. Founded about 1595 by a local chieftain, attracted by the fertility of the soil and the advantages of irrigation. A tank with an embankment 2 miles long forms, when full, a sheet of water 10 miles in circumference. Two religious gatherings are held in the year, each attended by about 5000 persons. Hoskot was annexed to Mysore by Haidar Al\u00ed in 1761.\n\n**Hospet ('New Town').\u2014Town** in Bellary District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 15\u00b0 15' 40\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 26' E., about 39 miles north-west of Bellary city. Population (1871) 10,005; (1881) 10,219. Hindus numbered 8868; Muhammadans, 1231; Christians, 60; and 'others,' 60. Number of houses, 2311. A kasb\u00e1 town with a t\u00e1sil\u00edd\u00e1r's and sub-magistrate's court, bungalows, school, dispensary, and 2 fine temples. The old fort has been levelled. Hospet is the head-quarters of the head-Assistant Collector of the newly-constituted District of Bellary, and a station on the Marmagoa-Hubli and Bellary Railway now (1882) under construction. It will, on the completion of the line, form the point of departure for visitors to the ruins of Vijayanagar, which are but a few miles distant. A considerable portion of the inhabitants are weavers.\n\n**Hossangadi.\u2014Gh\u00e1t or pass** in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See HOSANGADI.\n\n**Hos\u00far (Oosoor).\u2014Taluk** in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 2' N., long. 77\u00b0 30' E. Known as 'the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t' or taluk above the gh\u00e1ts; 50 miles long and 43 broad. Area, 1216 square miles. Population (1871) 193,037, of whom 185,072 were Hindus of the Vaishnava and Sivaite sects; Muhammadans, 6703, mostly Sunnis; Christians, 1261, nearly all Roman Catholics. Number of houses (1871), 44,750; number of villages, 942. The corresponding figures for 1881 are as follows:\u2014Population, 131,770, of whom 124,915 were Hindus; Muhammadans, 5899; Christians, 939; 'others,' 17. Number of houses, 25,822; number of villages, 731. Principal villages\n\u2014Hos\u00far, Denkanikota, Mattakeri, Thalli, Bagalur, Udenapach. The north-western portion of the taluk is plain and undulating; in the east is a series of rocky hills; the south-east affords some picturesque scenery, the village of Jaulikeri particularly attracting the eye. Geologically the formation is gneissic; iron is obtained at Vepanapalli; and the presence of gold is suspected. The climate generally is malarious; average rainfall (1878), 31 inches; highest temperature in May, 81\u00b0 F. The population are miserably poor, especially since the great famine of 1876\u201378. A little weaving is carried on; and there is some trade in grain and oil-seeds. Area under cultivation (1882\u201383), 215,751 acres; land revenue, \u00a316,070. Coffee and tea have been grown, but the cultivation has not succeeded. Sandal-wood, ebony, satin, rosewood, and teak timber abound. The taluk contains 187 miles of road; 45 miles were constructed during the famine of 1876\u201378. There are within the taluk 3 criminal courts and 12 police stations; regular police, 114 men.\n\nHos\u00far.\u2014Village in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore State. Population (1872) 5751; (1881) 2061. Weekly fair held on Saturday, attended by 300 persons.\n\nHos\u00far (Oosoor).\u2014Town in Hos\u00far taluk, Salem District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5869, namely, 5170 Hindus, 655 Muhammadans, and 44 Christians. The head-quarters of a sub-Collector; tahsildar's and munshi's courts; police station; Anglo-veracular and girls' school. Four miles to the south is Mattakeri, a remount depot from which all the cavalry and artillery in the Madras Presidency are supplied.\n\nHoti-Mard\u00e1n.\u2014Cantonment in Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab, and head-quarters of the Yusafz\u00e1\u00ed Sub-division; situated in lat. 34\u00b0 11' 15\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 6' E., on the right bank of the Kalp\u00e1n\u00ed river, 16 miles north of Naushahra (Nowshera), and 33 miles north-east of Pesh\u00e1war city. Derives its name from the two villages of Mard\u00e1n and Hoti, which occupy the banks of the Kalp\u00e1n\u00ed immediately below the cantonment. Contains the lines of the Corps of Guides, whose head-quarters are permanently stationed here. Small fort, occupied by the corps. Population (1881) 2766, namely, 2323 in cantonments, and 443 in the civil lines. Muhammadans numbered 1616; Hindus, 829; Sikhs, 295; and 'others,' 26. The civil lines lie a little south on the Naushahra road, and contain the sessions house, tahsil, police station, post and telegraph offices, Government charitable dispensary, and other public offices. An Assistant Commissioner, deputed from Pesh\u00e1war, resides at Hoti-Mard\u00e1n, in charge of Yusafz\u00e1\u00ed. The ravine of the Kalp\u00e1n\u00ed is very deep opposite the station, and the stream formerly had a tendency to encroach on the cantonment, but this has now been checked by means of willows planted along its banks.\n**Houng-tharaw.\u2014River and township in Amherst District, British Burma.\u2014See HAUNG-THARAW.**\n\n**Howrah (Haura).\u2014Sub-district of HUGLI DISTRICT, Bardw\u00e1n Division, Bengal, with independent magisterial jurisdiction, lying between 22\u00b0 13' 15\" and 22\u00b0 47' N. lat., and between 87\u00b0 47' and 88\u00b0 24' 15\" E. long. The magisterial District of Howrah was created in 1841, when the following five police circles (th\u00e1nds) were withdrawn from the magisterial jurisdiction of H\u00fagl\u00ed, and incorporated into the magistracy of Howrah\u2014viz. R\u00e1j\u00e1pur (now called Jagat-ballabhpur), Ampt\u00e1, Kotr\u00e1 (now called Sy\u00e1mpur), B\u00e1ghn\u00e1n, and Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1, to which was subsequently added the police circle of Dum-jor. The Howrah Sub-district, thus constituted, forms a triangular tract in the south of H\u00fagl\u00ed. It is bounded on the north by the B\u00e1li Kh\u00e1l and by the southern limit of the H\u00fagl\u00ed District; on the east by the river H\u00fagl\u00ed; on the north by the H\u00fagl\u00ed and R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan rivers; and on the west by the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan. The northern boundary separating Howrah from H\u00fagl\u00ed District is an artificial line running in a westerly direction from the mouth of the B\u00e1li kh\u00e1l, passing north of the village of B\u00e1li on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, to the D\u00e1modar river; thence about 8 miles up that river, and thence again west to the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan. On the west and south the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan forms the boundary, with the exception of a small portion of Mandalgh\u00e1t pargan\u00e1, which extends on both sides of the river.\n\n**Physical Aspects.\u2014** Howrah District is intersected from north to south by the D\u00e1modar river, which falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed opposite Falta Point. Its chief tributary is the K\u00e1na D\u00e1modar, which has its source near Tarakeswar in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, and runs a short distance through the north of Howrah till it falls into the D\u00e1modar at Ampta. Many small streams and watercourses intersect the District, the principal being the Saraswati, which takes its rise from the H\u00fagl\u00ed near Tribeni, and flows southwards through Howrah District till it falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed at the village of Sankrel a few miles beyond the Botanical Gardens, where the river takes a sudden sweep to the south. The southern and south-western portion of the District is on a much lower level than the country to the north and east, and in this tract cultivation is only rendered possible by a network of Government and private embankments, which have to be maintained at a considerable annual expense. The Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1 and Midnapur High Level Canal for both navigation and irrigation crosses the District from east to west, and affords direct water communication between Calcutta and Midnapur town; a regular steam service is maintained between the two places. Extensive schemes of land reclamation by the drainage of the numerous jhils and marshes with which the District is studded have been under the consideration of Government for several years,\nand are now in course of execution. The principal swamps are the R\u00e1j\u00e1pur jhil, the Bara J\u00e1l\u00e1, the Jonai J\u00e1l\u00e1, the P\u00e1nchla, and the Nalu\u00e1 J\u00e1l\u00e1. For draining these, three independent schemes were proposed. One of them, known as the Howrah scheme, embracing the tract between the B\u00e1li khil on the north, and the Government Botanical Gardens to the south of Howrah town, is now being carried out at an estimated cost of \u00a350,000. The estimate and plans for the R\u00e1j\u00e1pur scheme, involving an expense of upwards of \u00a3120,000, have been sanctioned by Government, but the work has not yet (February 1885) been commenced. The Ampta scheme, involving an expenditure of about \u00a335,000, has not yet been finally sanctioned. The three schemes embrace a total area to be drained of about 270 square miles, and have been undertaken under the provisions of Act vi. (B.C.). The drainage operations in Howrah District are interesting examples of large reclamation works beyond the means of the cultivators, or of individual landholders, which are only practicable for a combination of landed proprietors or capitalists, acting under the protection of the Act.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Howrah, with its two Sub-divisions, Howrah and Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1, contains an area of 476 square miles, and is by far the smallest District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. It derives its whole importance from the existence within its limits of the great metropolitan suburb of Howrah, and in revenue matters it still continues a portion of H\u00fagl\u00ed District. Howrah District contains 1,486 villages besides Howrah town, with a total of 125,297 houses, of which 113,644 are occupied and 11,653 unoccupied. Total population (1881) 635,381, namely, males 316,479, and females 318,902. Average density of population, 1,334 per square mile, or, excluding Howrah town, 1,130 per square mile; average number of persons per village, 427; houses per square mile, 263, or, exclusive of Howrah town, 196; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b76. Hindus numbered 500,870, or 78\u00b78 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 132,118; Christians, 2051; Buddhists, 37; Brahmos, 6; Jains, 3; Jews, 13; P\u00e1rsi, 1; and Sant\u00e1ls and other non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 282.\n\nAmong the higher Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 39,141; R\u00e1jputs, 1039; K\u00e1yasths, 15,849. Baniy\u00e1s or traders were returned at 7107. The other castes numbering over 5000 are\u2014Kaibartt\u00e1, the most numerous caste in the District, cultivators, fishermen, and labourers, 155,653; B\u00e1gd\u00ed, 54,943; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, 17,317; Tior, 15,623; T\u00e1nt\u00ed, 14,250; Pod, 14,138; Sadgop, 12,692; Tel\u00ed, 11,998; N\u00e1pit, 11,460; Dhob\u00ed, 9324; Chand\u00e1l, 9282; Jal\u00edy\u00e1, 6467; Cham\u00e1r, 5815; and Kumbhar, 5712. Caste-rejecting Hindus were returned at 15,337, of whom 15,284 were Vaishnavs. The Muhammadan population are thus divided according to sect\u2014Sunns, 128,405; Shi\u00e1s, 2671;\nand unspecified, 1042. Of the Christian population, 575 belong to the Church of England, 101 to the Church of Scotland, 623 are Roman Catholics, 209 are Baptists, 398 are returned simply as Protestants, and the remainder belong to other Christian denominations. As regards race, the Christians of the District comprise 341 British-born Europeans, 614 other Europeans, 10 Americans, 2 Australians, 4 Africans, 702 Eurasians, 340 natives of India, and 38 other Asiatics.\n\nWith the exception of the town and municipality of Howrah, which has a population of 105,206, or 16.6 per cent. of the whole population, no place in the District contains so many as five thousand inhabitants. Of its 1486 villages in 1881, 639 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 551 between two hundred and five hundred; 212 between five hundred and a thousand; 65 between one thousand and two thousand; 12 between two thousand and three thousand; and 7 between three thousand and five thousand. As regards occupation, the male population were thus classified in the Census Report\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials of all kinds, and the learned professions, 9265; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 11,101; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 17,213; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 108,640; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 40,296; (6) indefinite and non-productive, comprising general labourers, male children, and unspecified, 129,964.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The chief agricultural products are rice, mustard, oil-seeds, tobacco, indigo, ginger, hemp, jute, betel-nuts and leaves, and cocoa-nuts. Silkworms are reared in some parts of the District. Manufactures are entirely confined to the town of Howrah and its immediate suburbs. The principal main lines of road are\u2014(1) From Salkhia to the B\u00e1li kh\u00e1l, 6 miles, whence it is continued to opposite Palta, where the Grand Trunk road crosses the H\u00fagl\u00ed. It is metalled and bridged throughout, and carries a very considerable traffic. (2) The old road from Howrah to Benares, 8 miles to K\u00e1l\u00edpur. This is still the main road for pedestrians to and from the Upper Provinces, but is not available for wheeled traffic, as it crosses the D\u00e1modar twice beyond the limits of Howrah District, and is unbridged. (3) Howrah to Jagatballabhpur, an unmetalled road, 17 miles in length; and (4) Jagatballabhpur to Ampta, also unmetalled, 10\u00bd miles. The East Indian Railway starts from its terminus at Howrah town, and leaves the District at its first station\u2014B\u00e1li\u2014a distance of 6 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In revenue matters, as already stated, Howrah forms a part of H\u00fagl\u00ed District, and separate figures cannot be furnished. It contained in 1882\u201383, 6 civil and 7 criminal courts, the average distance of villages from the nearest court being 9 miles. The police\nforce consisted of 251 officers and men of the regular District police, 377 town and river police, and 1433 village watchmen (chaukidars). Education is afforded by 579 schools, attended by upwards of 17,000 pupils. The magisterial District of Howrah consists of the Sub-divisions of (1) Howrah, comprising the police circles (thands) of Howrah, Balli, Golabari, Sibpur, Dumjor, and Jagat-ballabhpur; and (2) Ulubaria, comprising the police circles of Ulubaria, Ampta, Baghnan, and Shampur.\n\nHowrah.\u2014Sub-division of Howrah District, Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 30' and 22\u00b0 41' 30\" N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 5' 45\" and 88\u00b0 24' 15\" E. long. Area, 173 square miles, with 373 villages or towns, 63,259 houses, and a population (1881) thus made up:\u2014Hindus, 243,753, or 78.22 per cent.; Muhammadans, 65,537, or 21.03 per cent.; Christians, 2024, or .65 per cent.; 'others,' 330, or .1 per cent.; total, 311,644, namely, 162,603 males and 149,041 females. Proportion of males, 52.17; average density of population, 1801 per square mile; villages per square mile, 2.15; persons per village, 836 (including the large town of Howrah in the average); houses per square mile, 365; inmates per house, 4.93. The population in 1872 was 297,064, thus showing an increase of 14,580 in nine years. This Sub-division, which was created in 1843, comprises the 6 police circles (thands) of Howrah, Balli, Golabari, and Sibpur,\u2014these four comprising the Howrah municipality,\u2014Dumjor, and Jagat-ballabhpur. It contains 3 civil and 7 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 169 men, with 520 village watchmen (chaukidars).\n\nHowrah.\u2014The largest and most important town, and the headquarters of the magisterial District of Howrah. Situated on the right bank of the Hugli river, opposite Calcutta, practically forming a suburb of that city. Lat. 22\u00b0 35' 16\" N., long. 88\u00b0 23' 12\" E. At the end of last century, Howrah is described in the Board of Revenue's records as a small village; and in 1785 it was held by a Mr. Lovett, who petitioned the Board to be allowed to relinquish it. Since that time it has risen and prospered with the growth of Calcutta, and is now a large town, with a Magistrate, Small Cause Court Judge, etc. of its own. The total area of Howrah and its suburbs comprised within municipal limits is 11.05 square miles, and its population is thus returned in the Census of 1881:\u2014Hindus, 45,985 males and 35,562 females\u2014total, 81,547; Muhammadans, 13,656 males and 8169 females\u2014total, 21,825; Christians, 1110 males and 818 females\u2014total, 1928; 'others,' 238 males and 90 females\u2014total, 328: total of all denominations\u201460,989 males and 44,639 females; grand total, 105,628, dwelling in 28,340 houses; average of persons per house, 3.72. The excess of males over females is explained by the fact that the population includes a large number of artisans and labourers who come from the rural parts, and do not bring their families with them. The\npopulation of the municipality in 1872 was 97,784, showing an increase of 7844, or 8\u00b702 per cent., in nine years. In 1883-84, the gross municipal income of Howrah, including balances and collections on account of arrears of the previous year, amounted to \u00a324,885. Excluding balances and collections of arrears, the net municipal income of the year amounted to \u00a324,598, or at an average rate of 4s. 6\u00bdd. per head of the population. The Census of 1881 showed that 25\u00b724 per cent. of the male population of the town, or 15\u00b758 per cent. of the total population, are able to read and write, or are under instruction. The returns showed 3522 boys and 293 girls at school, besides 11,875 males and 769 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The educational institutions comprise four schools for European and Eurasian children. The town of Howrah is lighted with gas; it contains several large and important dockyards, and is also the Bengal terminus of the East Indian Railway. Mills and manufactories of various sorts have rapidly developed. Communication with Calcutta is carried on by means of a massive pontoon or floating bridge, which was opened for traffic in October 1874. Howrah is also a suburban residence for many people who have their place of business in Calcutta. It contains a Mechanics' Institute, supported principally by the European employ\u00e9s of the East Indian Railway. The municipality of Howrah comprises Sibpur and R\u00e1mkrishnapur to the south, and Salkhi\u00e1 to the north. Sibpur, situated opposite Fort-William, was a small village at the commencement of the century, but is now a flourishing little town, inhabited chiefly by clerks employed in Government or mercantile offices in Calcutta. On the river-side it contains a manufactory known as the Albion Works, consisting of a flour mill and a distillery; also a dockyard, saw-mill, and jute-mill. To the south of Sibpur lie the Royal Botanical Gardens and the Government Engineering College, formerly Bishops' College.\n\n**Hpa-gat.** \u2014 Township in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. It occupies the tract lying between the Salwin river on the east and the D\u00fcnthamie and Bhinlaing on the west, and comprises the 3 revenue circles of Myaing-gyi, Myaing-gale, and Bhinlaing. In the north, the country is hilly and densely wooded; in the south, it is undulating and broken by stretches of low, marshy land. Tobacco is extensively grown in this latter portion. The head-quarters are at Hpa-gat. Population of the township in 1876, 9192; land revenue, \u00a3537; capitation tax, \u00a3811.\n\n**Hpa-gat.** \u2014 Village in Amherst District, British Burma, and headquarters of the township of the same name; situated on the right bank of the Salwin. Hpa-gat is 30 miles from Maulmain. Just to the north of the village are some limestone rocks, containing a large cave, with numerous images of different sizes of Gautama Buddha and\nof Rahan. Most of these have been much damaged. Bats' dung for manure is collected in the caves.\n\n**Hpaung-lin.**\u2014The most northern township of Rangoon District, Pegu Division, British Burma; lies between $16^\\circ 45'$ and $17^\\circ 33'$ N. lat., and between $96^\\circ 5'$ and $96^\\circ 20'$ E. long.; and extends from the bank of the Pegu river northward along the Pu-zun-daung valley to the lower slopes of the Pegu Yomas, which are covered with valuable forests, containing teak, *pyin-gado*, *pyin-ma*, *in*, etc. Area, 880 square miles. Towards the south, the country is well cultivated for rice, and intersected by numerous creeks, falling into the Pegu and Pu-zun-daung rivers, the latter navigable throughout its whole length in this township. The road to Pegu traverses Hpaung-lin. Population (1876) 34,477; gross revenue, \u00a321,251. The head-quarters are at Hlay-gu, on the Pu-zun-daung river and the Rangoon and Pegu road, 28 miles distant from Rangoon.\n\n**Hpyu (Hypoo).**\u2014River in Taung-gu District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; rises in the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yomas, and after a south-easterly course of about 70 miles, falls into the Sittaung (Tsittaung), 28 miles south of Taung-gu. The first 56 miles of the Hpyu are through a mountain gorge; during the last 5 or 6 miles, its course is a series of rapids rushing through narrow channels between high walls of rock. In the rainy season it is navigable for large-sized boats up to Min-lan. The slopes of the hills drained by the Hpyu are covered with dry open forest of teak, *pyin-gado*, climbing bamboos, *thin-gan*, *ka-gnyin*, oak (*Quercus* sp.), and other 'green forest' trees. During the rains a considerable quantity of timber and raw silk are brought down the river to the Sittaung for conveyance to the local markets.\n\n**Hubli.**\u2014Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 311 square miles; contains 1 town and 70 villages. Population (1881) 91,997, namely, 45,542 males and 46,455 females. Hindus numbered 74,199; Muhammadans, 15,884; 'others,' 1914. Since 1872, the population has decreased by 9241. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 2 police stations (*th\u00e1nds*); strength of regular police, 70 men; village watchmen (*chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs*), 230.\n\n**Hubli.**\u2014Chief town of the Hubli Sub-division in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $15^\\circ 20'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 12'$ E. Situated 13 miles south-east of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r town, on the main road from Poona (P\u00fana) to Harihar; distant 274 miles south-east from Poona, 142 miles from Bellary, 102 miles from K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and 97 miles from K\u00fampta (Coompta). In 1872 the population was 37,961, and the municipal income \u00a32220. Population (1881) 36,677; municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a33255; rate of taxation, 1s. 3d. per head. Of the population (1881), males numbered 17,972, females 18,705; Hindus, 24,912, or 68 per cent.; Muhammadans, 10,902, or 29.7 per cent.; Jains, 559; Christians, 298; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 6. Situated on the main lines of communication to\nHarihar, K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and K\u00fampta, Hubli has become the centre of the cotton trade of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country. Besides raw cotton and silk fabrics, a trade in copper vessels, grain, salt, and other commodities is conducted on a large scale. Subordinate judge's court, post-office, and charitable dispensary. The number of patients treated in the dispensary was\u2014in-door, 142; out-door, 15,896. Hubli was formerly the seat of an English factory, which in 1673, with the rest of the town, was plundered by Sivaji, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader.\n\n**Hudikeri.**\u2014Village in Coorg, head-quarters of the Kiggatn\u00e1d t\u00e1luk. Lat. 12\u00b0 5' N., long. 76\u00b0 E.; 39 miles south-south-east of Merk\u00e1r\u00e1, the Coorg capital. Population (1881) 693; number of houses, 104. Hudikeri is healthily situated on the top of a grass-covered hill, whence a fine view is obtained of the Brahmagiri and Maren\u00e1d ranges. Anglo-vernacular school, with 142 pupils. Post-office.\n\n**H\u00fagl\u00ed River (Hooghly).**\u2014The most westerly and, for commercial purposes, the most important channel by which the Ganges enters the Bay of Bengal. It takes its distinctive name near the town of S\u00e1ntipur, 64 miles from Calcutta, and some distance above the point where the waters of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed join those of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. The united stream thus formed, and during the rest of its course known as the H\u00fagl\u00ed, represents three western deltaic distributaries of the Ganges,\u2014viz. (1) the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed; (2) the Jalang\u00ed, including the waters brought down by its feeder the Bhairab (all of which leave the main stream of the Ganges, or Padma, in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District); and (3) part of the waters of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, which branches off from the Ganges in Nadiy\u00e1 District. The Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed and Jalang\u00ed unite at Nadiy\u00e1, and their combined stream is joined lower down, near Ch\u00e1gdah, by the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1.\n\nAccording to some authorities, the distinctive name of the H\u00fagl\u00ed is taken by the united stream of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed and Jalang\u00ed from their point of union at Nadiy\u00e1, about 24 miles above S\u00e1ntipur. The M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 joins this united stream near Ch\u00e1gdah, about 15 miles below S\u00e1ntipur. From Ch\u00e1gdah, the three united headwaters flow down under the name of the H\u00fagl\u00ed to Calcutta, about 49 miles. But the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 has in its turn taken the name of the Churn\u00ed before the point of junction at Ch\u00e1gdah, and thrown out new distributaries of its own; so that, strictly speaking, the H\u00fagl\u00ed is made up of the united streams of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed and Jalang\u00ed, together with such part of the lower waters of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 as the Churn\u00ed brings down.\n\nThe river system chiefly represented by these three western distributaries of the Ganges is known as 'The Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers.' They are important not only as the headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, but also as great highways for inland traffic. Like other deltaic distributaries, they are subject to sudden changes in their channels, and to constant silting up.\nThe supervising and keeping open of the Nadiy\u00e1 rivers has therefore formed one of the great tasks of fluvial engineering in Bengal. A special staff, under the Superintendent of the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers, is employed to watch and to control their movements, and weekly reports of their condition are published in the official Gazette. It is due in part to the careful attention thus paid to the headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, that Calcutta has not shared the fate of almost every other deltaic capital in India, and been shut off from the sea by the silting up of the river upon which its prosperity depends.\n\nThe H\u00fagl\u00ed thus starts life under a stringent supervision, from which it is scarcely allowed to escape until it reaches the sea. There is a portion of its course, however, during which it is left to itself. This is the section between the point where it takes its name of the H\u00fagl\u00ed near S\u00e1ntipur, and that at which the river comes within the jurisdiction of the Port Commissioners of Calcutta.\n\n**General Course of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.**\u2014Proceeding south from S\u00e1ntipur, with a twist to the east, the H\u00fagl\u00ed river divides Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d from H\u00fagl\u00ed District, until it touches the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s in lat. $22\u00b0\\ 57'30''$ N., and long. $88\u00b0\\ 27'15''$ E., close to the village of B\u00e1gherkh\u00e1l. It then proceeds almost due south to Calcutta, next twists to the southwest, and finally turns south, entering the Bay of Bengal in lat. $21\u00b0\\ 41'$ N., and long. $88\u00b0$ E. From B\u00e1gherkh\u00e1l downwards, it marks the boundary between the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s on the east, and the Districts of H\u00fagl\u00ed, Howrah, and Midnapur successively on the west. The river thus forms not only the most important feature in the geography of the western delta, but also a great demarcating line in the administrative distribution of the country.\n\n**Three Sections of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.**\u2014For practical purposes, the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, and the Gangetic distributaries which combine to form it, may be divided into three lengths or sections:\u2014(1) The headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, consisting of the offshoots of the Ganges, which unite successively at Nadiy\u00e1 and near Ch\u00e1gdah to form the H\u00fagl\u00ed river. The length of the longest headwater, the Bh\u00e1gfrath\u00ed, before its point of junction at Nadiy\u00e1, is 164 miles. (2) The section from the town of S\u00e1ntipur, near to which the combined stream takes the distinctive name of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, down to Calcutta, a distance of 64 miles. (3) A longer section of say 80 miles from Calcutta to S\u00e1g\u00e1r island. At this island, or even above it, the H\u00fagl\u00ed ceases to be a river in the ordinary sense of the word, and becomes an estuary or a wide branch of the sea. The mileage of the upper sections is given approximately, as the twists, and the shifting of the channel from year to year, render precision impossible without a fresh actual survey. Throughout these upper sections the H\u00fagl\u00ed and its headwaters exhibit the characteristic features of a deltaic river. They tend to cut their banks alternately on the\nconvex curve of each twist, and to deposit silt on the opposite concave side.\n\nAlleged Deterioration of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\u2014The commerce of Calcutta, the capital of India, depends upon the maintenance of the H\u00fagl\u00ed as a great waterway. Assertions are frequently made, and grave public anxiety has been expressed, that the H\u00fagl\u00ed river is deteriorating. Such a deterioration would, it is said, leave Calcutta land-locked and ruined. The settlements of the Danes, French, Dutch, and Portuguese higher up the river, none of which can now be approached by sea-going ships, are cited as warnings of the fate which may be in store for the metropolis of British India. Such statements have a very important bearing on Indian commerce, and might, in certain states of public opinion, produce panic. Each of the three sections into which the river is divided in the foregoing paragraph has therefore been separately examined for this article.\n\nIn regard to the first section, or the H\u00fagl\u00ed headwaters, valuable special reports have been received from T. H. Wickes, Esq., Superintending Engineer of the South-Western Circle of Bengal, and P. B. Roberts, Esq., C.E., Executive Engineer of the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers Division. The old standard Report on the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers is Captain Lang's, dated 14th July 1848, which the present author freely used in his Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. ii. pp. 18 to 33. For more detailed information than can be given in this article, the reader is referred to that volume (Tr\u00fcbner, 1875). In regard to the third section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, from Calcutta to the sea, Lieutenant Petley, R.N., the officer charged with the survey of the river, has rendered kind personal assistance and furnished much valuable information.\n\nHeadwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\u2014The headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed consist, as already stated, of three spill streams from the Ganges, namely\u2014(1) the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed; (2) the Jalang\u00ed, including its upper feeder the Bhairab, which is also a Gangetic distributary; and (3) such part of the waters of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 as are brought down by its lower continuation the Churn\u00ed. During several months of the year all these rivers dwindle into insignificant streamlets quite incapable of supplying the waters of the deep and broad H\u00fagl\u00ed. 'Any one of them,' writes the Executive Engineer, 'may in the dry season be regarded as consisting of a number of deep pools, connected by shoals over which the depth of water runs as low as half a foot, if artificial means be not employed to form narrow channels through the shoals.' As will be presently shown, each of the rivers is frequently closed during the dry weather, while in the great majority of years the depth maintained does not exceed two feet at the shallower places.\n\nThe H\u00fagl\u00ed fed by Infiltration.\u2014During these dry months, the waters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed are supplied by infiltration. The delta is in fact a mere\nsieve of silt and mud, through which vast quantities of water percolate into the deep trough which the H\u00fagl\u00ed has scooped out for itself. There is, as it were, a moving mass of water flowing underneath the surface of the land into the H\u00fagl\u00ed drain. This perpetual process of subterraneous infiltration renders the H\u00fagl\u00ed almost independent of its headwaters, so long as the depth of its main channel or drainage line is maintained.\n\n'After passing Sukhs\u00e1g\u00e1r,' writes the Superintending Engineer, 'it is impossible to tell whether the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers are open or closed, as the proportion of water they supply is a mere nothing.' Thus, in 1869, two of the three headwaters were closed, and the third supplied only 20 cubic feet of water per second. Yet within twenty-five miles of their point of junction, the H\u00fagl\u00ed was a wide, deep stream; a stream which now supplies Calcutta with over eight million gallons of water per diem (besides another four millions taken off lower down), without decreasing to any appreciable extent the water in the navigable channel from Calcutta to the sea.\n\nBut in order that this vast process of infiltration should go on, the H\u00fagl\u00ed bed must lie at a considerable depth below the surface. This depth is secured by the scouring of the current during the rainy season. The spill streams from the Ganges, which form the headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, then pour down enormous masses of water. At some places, a single one of the headwaters when in overflow exceeds a mile in breadth. Their accumulated floods rush down to form the H\u00fagl\u00ed, scoop out its channel to a great depth, and so maintain its efficiency as a line of drainage for subterraneous infiltration during the rest of the year.\n\nH\u00fagl\u00ed Headwaters.\u2014(1) The Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed.\u2014The first or northernmost of the Gangetic distributaries which go to form the H\u00fagl\u00ed is the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. This is a very ancient river, which is believed on good authority to represent the original course of the main channel of the Ganges. It has been described in a separate article in *The Imperial Gazetteer of India*, and can here be considered only in its special aspect as the chief of the H\u00fagl\u00ed headwaters. The Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed at present takes off from the Ganges below Suti, between Jairampur and Dhuli\u00e1n in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District. But its head continually shifts, sometimes to the extent of fifteen miles in three years; and it has a chronic oscillation of four miles. The present length of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed is 164 miles from its point of departure from the Ganges to its junction with the Jalang\u00ed at Nadiy\u00e1.\n\nThe reasons for believing the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed to represent the old Ganges are cogent. The present stream of the Ganges ceases to be sacred below the point where the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed branches off, and changes its name to the Padm\u00e1. The Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed is itself still called the Ganges by the people along its banks, and is held sacred. A local legend tells, indeed, that the Ganges formerly ran where the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed now flows,\nuntil a certain demon at R\u00e1mpur Beauleah swallowed it. This demon was a geological one, namely, a band of stiff yellow clay which confined the Ganges to the course of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed until it was burst through by some heavy flood. It was at Suti, at the head of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, that R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00e1girath prayed to Holy Ganges to descend from the Him\u00e1layas and purify the ashes of his ancestors. The story is told in full in the separate article BHAGIRATHI. Ch\u00e1gdah is said to take its name from the R\u00e1j\u00e1's chariot-wheels having stuck in the sand, when he was on his way from Suti to K\u00e1l\u00edgh\u00e1t. (Cf. chakra, a wheel, and dah, a place where the river is silted up with sand.) It should be added that K\u00e1l\u00edgh\u00e1t, one of the most ancient shrines of Bengal, lies on an old river-bed which is, hydrographically, the true continuation of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed or old Ganges, via the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The old Ganges appears to have left the present H\u00fagl\u00ed near the Kidderpur dockyard, and to have followed the course of what is now called Tolly's n\u00e1d\u00e1 past K\u00e1l\u00edgh\u00e1t to Gariya, where it turned to the south. Tolly's n\u00e1d\u00e1 is still a sacred stream; and below Gariya the old river is to this day known as the Ganga-nad\u00e1. The limits of this old bed of the Ganges can still be distinctly traced for a considerable distance by the high ridges which once formed its banks.\n\nChanges on a great scale still take place in the bed of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. Thus, Nadiy\u00e1 town was originally situated on the right bank; but the river, after rending in twain the ancient city, now leaves the modern Nadiy\u00e1 on its left bank. This change was completed within the present century. During the past hundred years, also, the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed has eaten away the battlefield of Plassey and other memorable spots. From time to time the river gives back its prey, and the sites which it has swallowed again become dry ground.\n\nAlleged Deterioration of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed.\u2014The divergence eastwards of the main body of the Gangetic waters from the ancient Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed must have led to important changes in the latter river. The portion of the waters which still continued to flow down the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, could no longer suffice to scour and keep open the whole extent of its wide bed. Some parts of the old Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed bed would therefore be left dry; in others the languid current would drop its silt and produce shoals, mud-banks, and islands. Such shoals and islands would, in time, join themselves to the bank, by the silting up of the intervening channel.\n\nThis process gradually reduced the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed to its present modest dimensions; and the question has been raised whether it has not now reached the last stage in the life of a deltaic river. In that stage the process of silting up completes itself, and the river dwindles into a series of pools, and finally disappears. The existence of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed practically depends on its inflow from the Ganges. Its only tributary of consequence from the west is the Adjai, which brings\ndown the drainage of the Birbh\u00fam and Sant\u00e1l uplands in furious floods during the rains, but dwindles into a silver thread in the dry weather. The question as to the future of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed is therefore practically confined to the deterioration of its intake from the Ganges. The historical information bearing upon this important inquiry is as follows.\n\nIn January 1666, a French priest mentioned that the mouth of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed at Suti was dried up. In 1756, Mr. Holwell, in the narrative of his journey to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d after the catastrophe of the Black Hole, speaks of the shoals of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed, and mentions that he had to change his boat for a smaller one at S\u00e1ntipur on account of the shallowness of the water. In 1781, Major Rennel states that the Nadiy\u00e1 rivers were usually unnavigable in the dry season. In 1797, Captain Colebrooke also observed that \u2018the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed and Jalang\u00ed are not navigable\u2019 during the dry months. During the last 62 years, from 1822 to 1884, the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed has been closed 20 years in the dry weather; during 18 years a lowest depth of one and a half to two feet has been maintained; while during 24 years the lowest depth has been from two to three feet. In the rains, the floods rise from twenty-three to twenty-nine feet, and there is generally a depth of fourteen feet throughout that season.\n\n**Hugli Headwaters\u2014(2) The Jalang\u00ed and Bhairab.**\u2014Proceeding southeastwards, the next deltaic distributary which goes to form the Hugli is the united stream of the Jalang\u00ed and Bhairab. The Bhairab takes off from the Ganges at Akriganj, about 43 miles below the head of the Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed. The Bhairab has been for long a decayed river; but in its prime it must have been of great hydrographic importance. On the one hand it was inferior in antiquity and in volume to the old Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed; but on the other it is much more ancient than the two remaining headwaters of the Hugli, namely, the Jalang\u00ed and M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. The name of the Bhairab, literally \u2018The Terrible,\u2019 still bears witness to the place which it held in the imagination of the people. The levels show that it once ran across the Districts of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, Nadiy\u00e1, and Jessur, crossing the courses of the present Jalang\u00ed and M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. But the old Bhairab became a dead river, its former course being cut into three pieces. It was intersected and destroyed by the Jalang\u00ed and M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. Indeed, this tract has formed the arena for fluvial revolutions on a gigantic scale. A part of Nadiy\u00e1 District is covered with a complete network of dead river beds. This watery reticulation spreads itself in every direction; in some places as long lines of pools; in others as muddy ditches, or mere depressions of exceptional greenness.\n\nDuring the past ten years the waning fortunes of the Bhairab have begun to rise again. The floods of 1874 forced open the mouth of the Bhairab at its intake from the Ganges. The Bhairab expanded from a small stream of 20 yards into an important distributary,\nwhich poured its waters into the Jalang\u00ed forty miles farther south. The result was that the channel of the Jalang\u00ed above this point of junction began to close up, and the Bhairab is now the channel by which the river called the Jalang\u00ed obtains its main water-supply from the Ganges.\n\nThe Jalang\u00ed was, until 1874, a very important river. Inferior in remote antiquity to the Bhairab, it had some centuries ago cut across the course of that river, and diverted its waters. The Jalang\u00ed took its offshoot from the Ganges at different times from thirty to forty miles below the Bhairab mouth, and, until 1874, was a broad river about 1000 feet in width. After the forcible re-opening of the Bhairab mouth by the floods of 1874, the upper part of the Jalang\u00ed silted up, and has almost closed. The 36 miles of the upper Jalang\u00ed from its offtake from the Ganges to its junction with the Bhairab may now, in its turn, be considered as a dead river. But its main length, from its junction with the Bhairab for 111 miles to its junction with the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed at Nadiy\u00e1, still bears the name of Jalang\u00ed.\n\nIn this restricted sense, the history of the Jalang\u00ed during the past 63 years, from 1822 inclusive to 1884, may be thus summarized:\u2014Closed in the dry season, during 43 years; open to a minimum depth of one and a half to two feet, 9 years; open to a minimum depth of two to three feet, 11 years. In the rains, the Jalang\u00ed has ample water for all purposes, with an average rise of two to three feet less than the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. For general purposes of description, the Bhairab and Jalang\u00ed are now taken to be one stream, and their united waters bear the name of the Jalang\u00ed. As already stated, they unite with the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed at Nadiy\u00e1, and the combined stream flows down 39 miles, till it unites with the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 near Ch\u00e1gdah.\n\nH\u00fagli Headwaters\u2014(3) The M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 has its principal offtake from the Ganges near Maheshkunda, 40 miles below the Bhairab mouth, and 83 miles below that of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. At present it is the south-easternmost of the H\u00fagli headwaters. During the first 40 miles after leaving the Ganges, it is known as the Haul\u00ed or K\u00famar. At about the 40th mile, the true K\u00famar, locally known as the Pang\u00e1s\u00ed, branches off to the east, and carries away four-fifths of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 waters to the Sundarbans. The remaining fifth flows down the lower M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, which here takes the name of the Churn\u00ed river, till it joins the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed near Ch\u00e1gdah.\n\nThe offtake of the upper M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 or Haul\u00ed from the Ganges is subject to the same shifting and changing as the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. Within the recollection of the present Superintending Engineer, its offtake has moved down ten miles. The whole length of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, upper and lower, from its present offtake at Maheshkunda to its junction with the H\u00fagli at Ch\u00e1gdah, is 121 miles.\nThe M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 is a comparatively narrow stream, with well-defined banks throughout. It presents more of the appearance of a canal than a river to the traveller passing along it by boat, the width from high bank to high bank being only a few hundred feet. During the past 65 years, it has undergone many vicissitudes. Up to 1820, the K\u00famar river took off from the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 at the village of K\u00e1chik\u00e1t\u00e1. In that year the Superintendent of the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers constructed a strong embankment across its head, and continued the embankment for some miles above and below, with the view of forcing the entire discharge of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 down the Churn\u00ed. At first the attempt was successful, but in the great floods of 1823 the pent-up waters outflanked the embankment at the village of Pang\u00e1s\u00ed, 8 miles north of K\u00e1chik\u00e1t\u00e1. They poured across the country, and dug out a new river channel, now locally known as the Pang\u00e1s\u00ed, which unites with the true K\u00famar after a course of about 9 miles. The Pang\u00e1s\u00ed is about a quarter of a mile in width, and carries off four-fifths of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 waters. From time to time, however, the K\u00famar or Pang\u00e1s\u00ed mouth has, in its turn, showed signs of silting up.\n\nThe history of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 during the 63 years from 1822 inclusive to 1884, may be summarized as follows:\u2014Closed in the dry weather, 54 years; open to a minimum depth of one and a half to two feet, 6 years; opened to minimum depth of two to three feet, 3 years. During the rainy season, the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 rises to about the same height as the Jalangi, and is passable for large boats and river steamers.\n\nWork done by the H\u00fagl\u00ed Headwaters.\u2014It will be seen, therefore, that during the rains the three H\u00fagl\u00ed headwaters pour down floods of 20 to 29 feet, with an average depth of, say 10 to 14 feet. The concentration of these vast masses of water has hitherto sufficed to scour the H\u00fagl\u00ed bed, and to maintain the depth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed trough below the surface of the ground. So long as the depth of that trough is thus maintained by scouring in the rains, the infiltration of the subterraneous waters of the delta affords the water-supply to the H\u00fagl\u00ed in the dry weather.\n\nThe H\u00fagl\u00ed Headwaters as Trade Routes.\u2014The H\u00fagl\u00ed headwaters are also important navigable channels. They afford short and safe water routes to Calcutta for the up-country traffic, as compared with the long circuit to the south-east via the Ganges and the Sundarbans. Thus, from K\u00e1liganj, where the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed takes off from the Ganges, the distance to Calcutta is 520 miles via the Sundarbans, and only 284 miles via the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1; 270 miles via the Bhairab-Jalang\u00ed, and 240 miles via the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. It is important, therefore, that these three rivers should be kept open, not only as headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, but also for their own sakes as trade routes.\n\nDeepening Operations on the H\u00fagl\u00ed Headwaters.\u2014The dangerous\nstate of the three rivers attracted attention at the end of the last century. In 1797, experience had already shown that none of them was to be depended upon as a navigable waterway. The expansion of Calcutta commerce led to petitions to Government on the subject; and during the first quarter of the present century, operations were commenced with a view to prevent further deterioration of these 'Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers.' Those operations were directed to keeping open the rivers throughout the dry season for broad oval-bottomed cargo-boats drawing two to three feet. In the rains there was always enough water, although the obstructions and snags in the rivers sometimes rendered navigation perilous. In 1813, the police officers along the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 bank were ordered to take the necessary steps, and a toll was levied to defray the expense. Police interference could, however, yield but scanty results; and in 1818, the obstructions had become so dangerous as to wreck numbers of boats, and to entail heavy demurrage by the detention of others. In that year, the merchants of Calcutta urgently petitioned the Government to adopt adequate measures. Mr. C. R. Robinson was accordingly appointed the first Superintendent and Collector of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, and commenced operations in 1819-20. In June of the latter year he was succeeded by Mr. May, who, during a long and arduous service of twenty years, laid the foundation of the system still at work.\n\n*Nadiy\u00e1 River Operations (1820\u20131884).*\u2014Throughout more than half a century, this struggle of engineering skill against nature has been going on. Any attempt to enter into the detailed operations is beyond the scope of the present article. But the results may be summarized; and the author has given a fuller description of the Nadiy\u00e1 River works in the second volume of his *Statistical Account of Bengal*. Heroic operations, such as the creation of new channels, have seldom been found to answer. The engineers have had to accept the fact that their resources are inadequate to control the mighty changes in the course of the Ganges, and the extensive shifting in the offtakes of its distributaries. Attempts to form permanent heads for the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers have been long abandoned. Such heads, even if they were kept open at a great expense during a period of years, would be liable to be blocked up in any single season by the formation of a great char or silt island in the Ganges in front of the opening.\n\nBut the engineers have during more than half a century also found that, although they cannot compel nature, they can coax her. In the first place, they have made short connecting cuts, the advantage of which is however doubtful; in the second place, they have cleared passages through bars of tough clay, which obstructed the channels; in the third place, they have removed accidental obstructions, such as trees or sunken boats, which would have caused a deposit of silt and\nclosed the channels. In the fourth place, they have learned how to 'train' the rivers, and make them keep themselves open by the compressed force of their own current. Such training works form perhaps the most permanent resource of engineering skill in its battle with the caprices of the deltaic rivers.\n\nTraining Works on the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers.\u2014It has been found that by guiding the rivers into channels varying, according to the volume of water, from 50 to 100 feet wide, a velocity of one and a half to three feet per second, with a depth of three feet, can be maintained during the dry season. Accordingly, each November, when the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers have generally a velocity of current equal to about three miles an hour, or $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet per second, 'training' operations are commenced. Experience has shown that if the velocity can be maintained through the dry season as high as $1\\cdot2$ feet per second, the channel will keep itself clear of silt. If the velocity can be maintained at $1\\cdot5$ feet per second, or over, the current will, of itself, perform a deepening process by scouring away the bed. A velocity of 3 feet per second, or two miles per hour, suffices to cause a channel to deepen itself to 3 feet in a few days. In order to maintain the velocity (which at the beginning of the dry season may be taken at 4 feet per second), it is necessary\u2014first, to secure a sufficient offtake of water from the Ganges; and second, to confine the volume of water within sufficiently narrow limits. Efforts are therefore made to keep open the head of the river where it starts from the Ganges. Expensive cuttings and excavations were formerly made, with this end; but these have been abandoned, since 1826, in favour of simple training works.\n\nThe actual training of the channel is accomplished by spurs, jhamps, and bandhals. A spur is constructed by carrying out from the bank two parallel rows of bamboo stakes 2 to 5 feet apart, and then filling the space between them with grass or jungle. A jhamp is a screen or mat of split bamboos on a strong frame, generally about 6 feet long and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet wide. A bandhal is constructed by driving a row of bamboo stakes into the river-bed like a fishing weir, and then tying the jhamp to the stakes. Care has to be taken that a clear space is left between the bottom of the jhamp and the bed of the river, and that the upper side of the jhamp is above the surface of the water. The training works act in the following manner:\u2014Where two channels exist with a char or island between them, one is closed to increase the velocity in the other. This is done, when there is a good current, by running a bandhal across the head whilst the river is still falling. The water rushes through the space left below the jhamp, carrying a large quantity of sand with it, which is at once deposited immediately in rear of the bandhal, and soon forms a ridge. The latter appears above water in a few days, and effectually closes the channel. If the current is slack a\n'spur' is run out until the contraction of the channel produces a sufficient velocity, when the remainder of the opening is closed by a bandhal, which acts as already described. When a shoal has to be cleared, two bandhals are run out (or spurs and bandhals if the current be slack), one from each bank of the river. These are so aligned as to form a bell-shaped mouth up-stream (just above the shoal), with a contracted channel over the shoal. Sand or silt is speedily deposited by the current behind the bandhals, as above explained; a narrow channel is formed; and a suitable velocity to prevent silting is maintained.\n\nThe head-works are of a similar character to those above described, but on a larger scale. The 'spurs' are 4 or 5 instead of 2 feet in width; wooden 'bullies' or piles take the place of bamboos; and the bandhals are stronger and more elaborately constructed. These devices for training the current into narrow limits suffice to maintain the requisite velocity of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 feet per second in seasons when a sufficient volume of water is obtained from the Ganges above.\n\nResults of the Nadiy\u00e1 River Operations.\u2014The long struggle of 64 years still remains a drawn battle. A hand-to-mouth existence for the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers has been maintained. The exact depth in each of the three H\u00fagl\u00ed headwaters during the dry season from 1822 to 1884 is given in the preceding pages. That depth may seem insignificant to persons unacquainted with the light draught of Bengal cargo boats. But a minimum depth of 2 to 3 feet enables a very important traffic, with the help of shoving, and waiting to get over the shallows. On the whole, successful efforts have been made to allow cargo boats of light draught to pass down one or other of the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers throughout nearly the whole of the dry season. Even when this is not effected and the laden traffic has to go round the Sundarbans, sufficient depth is maintained to enable the return empty boats to proceed by the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers instead of having to go back by the long and tedious route. The minimum depths, recorded in the foregoing pages, refer in some years to only short periods in the dry season. The obstructed state of the channels, and the snags and sunken wrecks which led to the merchants' petition in 1818, before the operations commenced, have long disappeared. The records show that even in the dry season there has been no marked deterioration in the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers as a whole since 1820. Old heads have closed, and new heads have opened, but the total discharge does not appear to have decreased. The dry season discharge remains about the same; and the flood discharge seems rather to have increased than to have diminished since the operations commenced.\n\nThe Future of the H\u00fagl\u00ed Headwaters.\u2014If those operations have not improved the H\u00fagl\u00ed headwaters, they may claim to have arrested deterioration. The value of the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers as short waterways for the up-country traffic to Calcutta has increased, and the tolls on\ntheir courses yielded in 1883-84, Rs. 200,907, against an expenditure of Rs. 125,275 in keeping the channels open. In their even more important aspect, as the headwaters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, their vitality has been preserved. They still discharge their function of scouring out the H\u00fagl\u00ed channel during the rains, and of thus maintaining the H\u00fagl\u00ed bed at a sufficient depth to feed itself from the subterraneous infiltration of the delta during the dry weather. It would be rash to venture on any prediction as to the future of these Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers. On the one hand, engineering skill is constantly increasing the resources at its disposal. On the other hand, the tendency of deltaic distributaries branching off at rather sharp angles is to deteriorate and die away. Moreover, the floods of the Ganges and its offshoots may, during any rainy season, produce a fluvial cataclysm altogether beyond the control of man. It should also be remembered that the fate of the H\u00fagl\u00ed depends not entirely upon its headwaters. There is a section of about 42 miles from the junction of those headwaters at Ch\u00e1gdah down to the port of Calcutta, throughout which the river is subject to neither supervision nor control. In this section, important changes have taken place,\u2014changes which we shall presently consider.\n\nSecond Section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed\u2014S\u00e1ntipur to Ch\u00e1gdah, and thence to Calcutta.\u2014The waters of the Bh\u00e1gfrath\u00ed and the Jalangi, which have united at Nadiy\u00e1, flow thence under the name of the Bh\u00e1gfrath\u00ed, for about 24 miles, down to S\u00e1ntipur. At S\u00e1ntipur, the combined stream takes the name of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, and flows on for about 15 miles to Ch\u00e1gdah, where it receives the Lower M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1 (under the name of the Churni). The three Gangetic headwaters, thus finally united at Ch\u00e1gdah, proceed as the H\u00fagl\u00ed for 49 miles to Calcutta.\n\nThe Old D\u00e1modar Junction with the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\u2014The main feature of this section is the silted-up mouth of an ancient feeder from the west. The D\u00e1modar river poured its waters at one time into this section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. But during the past two centuries, a series of great floods burst through the D\u00e1modar embankments, and the river rushed southwards by a course of its own. The modern D\u00e1modar now joins the H\u00fagl\u00ed nearly opposite Falta, 31 nautical miles below Calcutta. The ancient D\u00e1modar entered the H\u00fagl\u00ed more than 39 English miles above Calcutta. Its waters represented the drainage of a vast catchment basin in Western Bengal and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\n\nIn old times, therefore, the section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed above Calcutta received not only a copious supply through its present eastern headwaters from the Ganges, but also the drainage of the western D\u00e1modar basin. In the last century, the D\u00e1modar floods gradually forced a larger passage for themselves to the scuthwards. This period of fluvial anarchy may be taken to have culminated in 1770, when the D\u00e1modar destroyed Bardw\u00e1n town, and ruined the line of embank-\nments which had formerly helped to check its southern tendency, and to confine it to its ancient easterly course into the H\u00fagl\u00ed. But long before 1770, its southern branch had so enlarged itself as to carry off the bulk of its waters. Its old eastern course into the upper section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed is now represented by a languid muddy cutting, the Kanson\u00e1 kh\u00e1l, which joins the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Nay\u00e1 Sar\u00e1i, about 39 miles above Calcutta. At the end of the last century, the Kanson\u00e1 kh\u00e1l was still officially spoken of as the 'mouth of the old D\u00e1modar.' In 1793, the Collector of Bardw\u00e1n submitted proposals for the re-opening of this mouth of the ancient D\u00e1modar; proposals which the Government, with its then defective engineering resources, declined to sanction. The old D\u00e1modar channel, locally known as the Kanson\u00e1 kh\u00e1l and K\u00e1na-n\u00e1di, is now utilized as an irrigation channel, and forms part of the Eden canal for supplying drinking water and for irrigation purposes.\n\nResults of the Closing of the D\u00e1modar Mouth.\u2014For practical purposes, therefore, the D\u00e1modar became a dead tributary so far as the H\u00fagl\u00ed section above Calcutta was concerned. It no longer swelled the three Gangetic distributaries which had scooped out and kept clear the H\u00fagl\u00ed bed. The result was, that during the last century the H\u00fagl\u00ed above Calcutta deteriorated. Silt chars and mud islands were formed. Some of these joined themselves to the neighbouring banks; while in other cases, shoals formed off the bank, and rendered the ancient trading settlements no longer accessible to sea-going ships. A single example of a char or silt island which took place during the present generation will suffice to illustrate this process. About forty years ago, an almond-shaped bank rose above the surface of the water near Tribeni. It soon became covered with long grass. A colony of B\u00fana coolies, who had emigrated from the hills and jungles of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur to work at an indigo factory, made temporary settlements upon the island. They raised, in an intermittent fashion, cucumbers, pumpkins, and other vegetables. By degrees they permanently settled down on the island; and after some years the Collector reported that they had taken to regular cultivation, and adopted the habits and customs of Bengali life. The island had almost joined itself to the bank; and unless some fluvial revolution takes place, it would become, in the natural course of things, a part of the mainland.\n\nRuin of European Settlements on the H\u00fagl\u00ed above Calcutta.\u2014This process of silting went on in different stages throughout the last century. The section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed above Calcutta had been famous during six hundred years for its entrep\u00f4ts for sea-going trade. S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, the Muhammadan royal port of Bengal, lay, as we shall presently see, near Tribeni, 36 miles above Calcutta. When that port silted up, the Portuguese founded their chief Bengal settlement, a few miles lower down, at H\u00fagl\u00ed, in 1537. The Dutch came later, and in the 17th century established their\nfactory and port at Chinsurah, a mile below H\u00fagl\u00ed town, and now forming one municipality with it. Still later, in the middle of the 18th century, Chandarnagar, or Chandernagore, founded as a small French settlement in 1673, rose to mercantile importance under Dupleix. Chandarnagar lies, in its turn, a little farther down the river, 2 miles below Chinsurah. The German or Ostend Company came after the French, and about 1723 fixed their Bengal port at B\u00e1nk\u00edpur, 5 miles below Chandarnagar, but on the other side of the river. The Danes in 1616 had selected Serampur as their port, on the same side as Chandarnagar, but 8 miles farther down. All these ports and settlements lie at a distance of from 16 to about 36 miles above Calcutta. They are, without exception, now inaccessible to sea-going ships, even of small tonnage.\n\nThe deterioration of this section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed was accelerated after the old D\u00e1modar mouth commenced to close, probably about the beginning of the last century. But the process of silting up was still very gradual. In 1757, Admiral Watson took his fleet, with his flagship of 64 guns, as high as Chandarnagar for the bombardment of that town. As late as 1821, the English pilots steered Danish ships of 700 to 800 tons up to Serampur. Indeed, one old pilot stated in evidence, that about the same period he had seen a ship of 800 tons go up to Chinsurah, and a French ship to Chandarnagar. After 1825, this section of the river seems to have rapidly deteriorated. The Dutch and Danish ships could go no farther up than Cossipur, just above Calcutta, and were there unladen in cargo boats. But until about 1865, inland navigation went on by means of flat-bottomed steamers. On the construction of the East India Railway, the flat-bottomed steamers by degrees withdrew from this section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed; and since about 1865 it has only been used in the dry season by native cargo boats.\n\nThe Old Saraswati.\u2014Another feature of this section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed is the closed mouth of the old Saraswati, which is now represented by a tidal ditch opening on the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Tribeni gh\u00e1t, 36 miles above Calcutta. At one time, this ditch was a broad river flowing between high banks, at places 600 feet apart. It carried the main body of what is now the H\u00fagl\u00ed down to the south-west, and enjoyed religious honours as being the true continuation of the Ganges. According to the Sanskrit legend, the sanctifying waters of the Saraswati enter the Jumn\u00e1 at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and leave the Ganges at Tribeni gh\u00e1t, now on the H\u00fagl\u00ed. They flowed in a wide deep channel, now represented by the Saraswati tidal ditch, to the south-west of the present H\u00fagl\u00ed river. The course of this dead river can still be traced by pools and marshes until it regains its character of a navigable channel near S\u00e1nkrel, where it re-enters the H\u00fagl\u00ed about 6 miles below Howrah. As late as the 15th\ncentury, it was an important river. S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, the 'Ganges Regia,' or ancient royal port of Bengal, lay upon its bank a short distance inland from Tribeni gh\u00e1t.\n\nS\u00e1tg\u00e1on or Saptagr\u00e1m was the traditional mercantile capital of Bengal from the Pur\u00e1nic age to the beginning of the 16th century. By that time the Saraswat\u00ed mouth had so far silted up that the Portuguese ships could no longer make use of it. Accordingly, in 1537, as already stated, they founded an emporium of their own a few miles lower down the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Gholgh\u00e1t, which grew up into H\u00fagl\u00ed town. The site of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on is now left high and dry, but old ships have been unearthed by torrents in the rainy season, at a depth of several feet in the deltaic mud. A thick jungle, dotted with oases of sugar-bearing palms, still retains the name of The Fort (kil\u00e1); and a long railway bridge spans an expanse of cultivation, with a paltry tidal channel in the middle, which was once the broad bed of the Saraswat\u00ed.\n\nPresent State of the H\u00fagl\u00ed above Calcutta.\u2014It would appear, therefore, that within historical times great fluvial revolutions have taken place in the section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed above Calcutta. One important offshoot, the Saraswat\u00ed, has silted up; another important tributary, the D\u00e1modar, no longer pours into this section the drainage from the western Districts and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The flourishing European settlements of the 16th to the 18th centuries are practically land-locked from sea-borne commerce. The process of silting up in this section has produced very marked results within the past hundred years. Alluvial formations are still going on in the river-bed from Serampur upwards. These formations are in many stages of growth, from the well-raised island with trees, down through successive phases of crop cultivation and reedy marshes, to shoals and little dots of dry land which only emerge above the water at certain seasons of the year. It is possible, therefore, that the gradual filling up of this section may in time so deteriorate the H\u00fagl\u00ed trough as to affect its water-supply derived from infiltration during the dry weather.\n\nAlleged 'drying up' of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, 1738 and 1770.\u2014In addition to the gradual process of silting, the H\u00fagl\u00ed seaboard is subject to the influence of earthquakes. There is a distinct tradition that the H\u00fagl\u00ed, at and above Calcutta, was almost dried up for short times, apparently by upheavals, in the last century. Statements are on record of persons having waded across the river at several points in 1770. Another report mentions that in '1738, 9th October, Thursday noon, at ebb tide, the river retired, leaving its bed dry opposite Calcutta.' How far these statements are strictly accurate it is now impossible to determine. The fragmentary evidence is collected in Appendix E. to the H\u00fagl\u00ed Committee Report, of January 23, 1855. It appears, however, that the river shortly regained its usual dimensions, and no means exist of\nascertaining whether the upheaval exercised any permanent effect upon the level of the H\u00fagli trough. It must also be remembered that the next rainy season might bring down floods sufficient to scour out its bed to the previous depth.\n\n**Railway Bridge near H\u00fagli.**\u2014A railway bridge is now being carried across the river near H\u00fagli town. It is constructed on iron caissons sunk to a great depth below the bed of the river, and filled in with brick and mortar. It will connect the East India Railway system with that of the Eastern and Northern Bengal Railways, and thus concentrate the traffic of Upper India at one general terminus to be built on the Calcutta side of the H\u00fagli.\n\nThe bridge is being constructed on the cantilever system, and will form an interesting example of that principle. It consists of three spans; the central cantilever span resting on two piers of great strength in the middle of the river; the second and third spans projecting from either bank, and resting upon the opposite ends of the middle cantilever span, instead of on separate piers of their own. The two extremities of the bridge are thus supported on solid masonry works on either bank; while the two massive middle piers under the central cantilever span supply the rest of the support to the structure. The two central piers are each sunk to a depth of 100 feet below mean sea-level, or 73 feet below the river-bed. They have been forced down through 64 feet of sand and silt, followed by 1 foot of wave gravel, and 8 feet of hard yellow clay. The height of the bridge above highest water mark is $36\\frac{1}{2}$ feet, so as to allow ample space beneath for the passage of river steamers and native cargo boats. Rail level, $58\\frac{1}{2}$ feet above mean sea-level. The length of the bridge is 1200 feet, consisting of two spans of 420 feet each projecting from the banks, and one central span of 360 feet. Estimated cost of the H\u00fagli Railway Bridge and approaches, \u00a3900,000.\n\n**H\u00fagli from Calcutta downwards.**\u2014The headwaters of the H\u00fagli, and the course of the river from S\u00e1ntipur to the port of Calcutta, have been treated of in the foregoing paragraphs. It remains to deal with the third section of the H\u00fagli river, or the 80 miles from Calcutta to its estuary at S\u00e1g\u00e1r island. This section, however, is now the subject of a regular survey conducted under the authority of the Port Commissioners of Calcutta. The results will shortly be published in an accessible form by Lieutenant Petley, R.N., the officer in charge of the survey. It is inexpedient to anticipate Lieutenant Petley\u2019s authoritative work by a minute description here. In the case of the headwaters and upper section, a fuller account was necessary in this article, as no attempt to deal with those sections has hitherto been available to the public.\n\n**The H\u00fagli at Calcutta.**\u2014There is evidence to show that the H\u00fagli at Calcutta was in the last century much broader than at the present\nday. The site of Calcutta has itself been raised by the debris and accumulations of a great capital. Thus, the old floor of the Black Hole, excavated in 1883-84, was found to be several feet below the present level of the ground. The vast plain, or Calcutta maid\u00e1n, with its garden and promenades, was, in the first half of the last century, a swamp during three months of each year. The well-raised quadrangle, known as Wellington Square, was part of a tidal channel; and local names such as Creek Row or Dinge-bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, literally, 'broken boats,' bear witness to a period when what are now solid streets were navigable waterways.\n\nThe change has to some extent resulted from embankments thrown out along the Calcutta side of the river. These embankments have left at their back the well-raised Strand and the commercial quarter of Calcutta. But the change has been due not altogether to artificial causes. At one time, the H\u00fagl\u00ed, instead of turning south-west at Calcutta, sent out a portion of its waters to the south-east. This south-east offshoot branched off near the exit of the present Tolly's nd\u00e1l, and its course can still be traced in a series of pools and dips across the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s. This dead river was probably, in very ancient times, the main exit of what are now the H\u00fagl\u00ed waters. The prehistoric shrine of K\u00e1l\u00edgh\u00e1t lies upon its route. Other sacred places of Hinduism mark its course, and the high ground or banks along its forgotten bed supply holy spots for the burning of the dead. The line of pools and dips and channels is still known at sections as the Adi-Gang\u00e1 or 'original Ganges.' The extinct river which they represent found its way into the Bay of Bengal near S\u00e1g\u00e1r island, and it is there that the present H\u00fagl\u00ed river is again recognised as Mother Ganges, and resumes its sanctity. Hindus who die below the point where the Adi-Gang\u00e1 left the H\u00fagl\u00ed have, during many generations, been carried to the H\u00fagl\u00ed above that point, or to the old banks of the Adi-Gang\u00e1 itself, for incremation. The spice merchant in Makunda R\u00e1m's poem of the 16th century, on his voyage to Ceylon, sailed down the H\u00fagl\u00ed to the site of the present Calcutta, and then struck off south-eastward, past K\u00e1l\u00edgh\u00e1t, to the Bay of Bengal.\n\nAlleged Deterioration of the H\u00fagl\u00ed Channels.\u2014From time to time fears have been entertained with regard to the H\u00fagl\u00ed approach to Calcutta. Such fears were very strongly expressed in the middle of the present century. Accordingly, in 1853, Lord Dalhousie appointed a Committee to inquire into 'the state of the river H\u00fagl\u00ed, particularly whether it has deteriorated for the purposes of navigation, and what has been the nature and progress of such deterioration.' It was even believed that at no distant date, ships of modern tonnage would be unable to approach Calcutta; and a project was entertained of found-\ning a new port 28 miles to the south-east, on the Matl\u00e1 river, to anticipate the silting up of the H\u00fagl\u00ed channels.\n\nThe scientific evidence of pilots and experts then taken dissipated the panic, but it also made clear the necessity of closer attention to the H\u00fagl\u00ed channels. The vigilant supervision devoted to these channels will be mentioned in the following paragraphs; and the H\u00fagl\u00ed is now (1885) said to be in a better condition for the passage of large ships than it ever was. The Matl\u00e1 project was, however, revived as a subsidiary port, and a railway was constructed to connect it with Calcutta. Trade, however, has clung to the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The Matl\u00e1 harbour, known as Port Canning, proved a failure, and the railway to it from Calcutta is a loss to the Government. A branch line from the Matl\u00e1 Railway at Son\u00e1rpur station runs to Diamond Harbour, 38 miles by rail from Calcutta.\n\nThe Changes in the Channels below Calcutta are so frequent that it would be misleading to enter into details in an account like the present. As already stated, Lieutenant Petley, R.N., Deputy Conservator of the Port of Calcutta, is now engaged on a scientific work on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, based upon continuous surveys. To that work those who require information on questions of detail must be referred. In the following paragraphs, distances below Calcutta are expressed in nautical miles, as tabulated in Lieutenant Petley's lists. Distances above Calcutta are invariably given approximately in English statute miles.\n\nJames and Mary Sands.\u2014There is, however, one feature of the H\u00fagl\u00ed channels between Calcutta and the estuary which must be specially mentioned. It has been explained that the D\u00e1modar river, which formerly poured its waters into the H\u00fagl\u00ed about 30 English miles above Calcutta, now enters the river opposite Falta, 31 nautical miles below that city. About 6 miles farther down than the present D\u00e1modar mouth, the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan also debouches from the same western side into the H\u00fagl\u00ed. These two rivers bring down the accumulated drainage of the south-western Districts of Bengal and of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. They enter at rather sharp angles into the H\u00fagl\u00ed, and their volume of water checks the flow of the H\u00fagl\u00ed current. In this way they lead to deposits of enormous quantities of silt brought down by the three rivers, the H\u00fagl\u00ed, the D\u00e1modar, and the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan.\n\nThe result of their combined deposits is the dangerous shoal known as The James and Mary Sands, which will be treated in a separate article in volume vii. The entrance of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan would probably have itself sufficed to check the current, and to cause some deposit. But when the D\u00e1modar, perhaps about the beginning of the last century, broke away to the south and forced its main passage into the H\u00fagl\u00ed just above the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, the deposits must have taken place on a greater scale. The process by which the D\u00e1modar gradually\ndiverted the main body of its waters to this new mouth occupied many years, extending over a period of probably more than a century. Shortly after the English settled at Calcutta in 1686, the sandbank thus formed had become a recognised danger. The records show that on the 24th September 1694, the Royal James and Mary was lost on this shoal, and gave her name to the James and Mary Sands.\n\nPresent State of the James and Mary Sands.\u2014These sands still continue to be one of the chief dangers of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. Banks and shifting quicksands are rapidly formed, and the channels have to be watched, and sounded, and supervised with almost the minute accuracy which a watchmaker would give to the repair of a delicate timepiece. If a vessel touches the bottom, she is pushed over by the current; and cases are known in which only the yards of a great three-masted ship have remained above water within half an hour after the accident. The vessel itself is sucked under, and covered over with the sands if not promptly blown up. The sands extend upwards from H\u00fagl\u00ed Point, 37'1 nautical miles from Calcutta, opposite the mouth of the R\u00fapn\u00e1-r\u00e1yan, to about Falta Point, 31'2 nautical miles from Calcutta, opposite the mouth of the D\u00e1modar.\n\nCatastrophes of a terrible character occur. The two following may serve as examples. In 1877, the ship County of Stirling, from Calcutta to Hull, with a cargo of 1444 tons of wheat, etc., grounded on the Falta Sands, a little north of the James and Mary, and was turned literally upside down. She disappeared in eight minutes, and several of the crew were drowned. Next year, 1878, a first-class British steamer, with 2400 tons of general cargo, grounded on the Falta Sands, and capsized in two minutes. The vessel and cargo were entirely lost, and six of the crew were drowned.\n\nThe utmost care is taken with vessels while passing this dangerous section of the river, and indeed all the way from Diamond Harbour up to Falta Point (12'2 nautical miles). The height of the water on the bars is signalled from the bank from the time the vessels enter the river until they pass the last dangerous bar at M\u00e1y\u00e1pur, 24 nautical miles above Diamond Harbour, and 19 below Calcutta. The result of this care and skill is, that ships no longer think of discharging either passengers or cargo at Diamond Harbour below the James and Mary Sands, but pass straight up to Calcutta. Diamond Harbour, formerly a busy port, is now a deserted village, with an old English graveyard. It was hoped that the opening of the Diamond Harbour Railway in 1884, connecting the port with Calcutta, would again bring back to Diamond Harbour some of its former prosperity.\n\nThe H\u00fagl\u00ed Pilot Service.\u2014Much of the credit of maintaining and improving the H\u00fagl\u00ed as a great waterway is due to the Calcutta pilots,\n\u2014one of the most highly-skilled and most highly-paid Pilot Services in the world. This service has not only produced many distinguished men, but by its trustworthiness, intrepidity, and high sense of responsibility as a body, has contributed more than hydraulic engineering to keep open the approach to Calcutta. Every incoming vessel is boarded from a pilot brig before entering the estuary, and remains in charge of the pilot until he makes over the ship to the harbourmaster at Garden Reach on the southern limit of the Port of Calcutta. In the last century, ships of 700 tons usually discharged their cargo at Diamond Harbour, so as to avoid the dangers of the James and Mary Sands, and the shoals above. A minute supervision of the channels, and the constant readjustment of the buoys, together with a highly-skilled pilot service, now render the H\u00fagl\u00ed a comparatively safe waterway for ships of the largest tonnage. Vessels drawing 26 feet are safely piloted up to Calcutta.\n\nTug Service.\u2014This result has been greatly aided by the introduction of steam, and by the powerful tug service maintained on the H\u00fagl\u00ed. When it is stated that ships of 700 tons unloaded in the last century at Diamond Harbour, it must be remembered that they had to tack up channels, which were not only shallow but narrow. This process sometimes occupied a week; and the fact that they halted at Diamond Harbour supplies no conclusive proof as to a lesser depth of water over the shoals in the last century than at the present day.\n\nAttempts to improve the Channels.\u2014While the H\u00fagl\u00ed has thus been successfully maintained as a waterway to Calcutta, direct efforts to manipulate its channels have not yielded favourable results. In 1867\u201368, a scheme for such improvements was submitted to Government; and the M\u00e1y\u00e1pur bar, a dangerous obstruction 19 nautical miles below Calcutta, was selected for experiment. Spurs were run out some distance below high line from both banks of the river; but it was found that these spurs were quite inadequate to guide the flood and ebb tide into one channel. No improvement, therefore, resulted. Since that time further direct attempts have not been made to improve the channels of the river below Calcutta. But much attention has been given to the port of Calcutta itself. Large reclamations have been made on the Howrah foreshore, and substantial spurs have been thrown out between the East India Railway terminus at Howrah and Shalimar Point. These works have already caused a marked improvement in the depth of water within the port. Steam dredgers are employed in removing the silt along the jetties, and from other places where accumulations of sand are deposited.\n\nThe accommodation for discharging cargo at Calcutta has also been improved. A line of eight screw pile jetties, varying in length from 300 to 450 feet, extend from just below Armenian gh\u00e1t to as\nfar south as Koila gh\u00e1t. These jetties are furnished with hydraulic cranes, spacious warehouses, and every appliance required for the loading and discharging of cargo. The Port Commissioners have a scientific survey staff continually employed in surveying the river, and the charts which they issue will form a lasting and valuable record of the changes that actually take place. The bars over M\u00e1y\u00e1pur and the James and Mary are sounded daily, the result being telegraphed both to Calcutta and Diamond Harbour for the information of the inward and outward bound pilots.\n\nThe Defences of the H\u00fagl\u00ed have of late years attracted serious attention. In a work like the present, it must suffice to state that, besides Fort William at Calcutta, defensive works have been erected at Falta, mounting eight 12-ton guns, and throwing 250 lbs. projectiles. It is also proposed to mount at Chingari-kh\u00e1l four 38-ton guns, together with three of these powerful weapons at Falta. In case of attack, two torpedo-boats would be employed, together with a torpedo-field, protected by light guns. Any further particulars would be out of place in this article. But the channels are so dangerous as in many places to be practically impenetrable by ships of war if the buoys were taken up. Torpedoes might render them absolutely inaccessible.\n\nEstuary of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\u2014Shortly after the river leaves Diamond Harbour, 43'4 nautical miles below Calcutta, it widens out; and at Kalp\u00ed (Culpee), on its left or eastern bank, 49'7 nautical miles from Calcutta, the estuary may be said to commence. At Khij\u00edr\u00ed (Kedgeree), 67'8 nautical miles from Calcutta on the right or western bank, it becomes a vast sea, with the low-lying Midnapur coast on the west, and S\u00e1gar (Saugor) Island, just rising a few inches above the level of the water, 15 miles distant on the eastern side. S\u00e1gar lighthouse is passed at 81 nautical miles below Calcutta, and the S\u00e1gar anchoring buoy at 86 miles. For practical purposes, the sea may be said to commence at about 80 miles from Calcutta; but the outer floating light lies 121'8 nautical miles, and the outermost (or Pilot's Ridge) buoy at 139'6 nautical miles from Calcutta via the western channel.\n\nThe estuary of the H\u00fagl\u00ed is famous for its dangerous and numerous sandbanks; but they are subject to such great and rapid changes, that any attempt at a minute description of them would be more mischievous than useful. The best known of them are the Gaspar Sands and S\u00e1gar Sands. The same reason precludes any attempt at an exact description of the entrance channels. Horsburgh in his Sailing Directions gave detailed information on this point, but it is now nearly useless. The information condensed by Commander Taylor in his India Directory for Steamers and Sailing Vessels is more recent (1874). But the best and only really safe guides are the frequent issues of the charts brought up to date, 'showing the approaches to\nthe Sand-heads;\u2019 and for the James and Mary Sands \u2018from Luff Point upwards to Anchorage Creek\u2019 and Falta. A fresh survey of the river was commenced by the Marine Survey Department in 1882\u201383, and its results are being embodied by Lieutenant Petley, R.N., in a work for general reference by the public.\n\nThe tide runs rapidly in the H\u00fagl\u00ed, and produces a remarkable example of the fluvial phenomenon known as a \u2018bore.\u2019 This consists of the headwave of the advancing tide, hemmed in where the estuary narrows suddenly into the river, and often exceeds 7 feet in height. It is felt as far up as Calcutta, and frequently sinks small boats or dashes them to pieces on the bank. The tide itself runs to above H\u00fagl\u00ed town, and is felt as high up as Nadiy\u00e1. The difference between the lowest point of low water in the dry season to the highest point of high water in the rains, is reported at 20 feet 10 inches. The greatest mean rise of tide, about 16 feet, takes place in March, April, and May; with a declining range during the rainy season to a mean of 10 feet, and a minimum during freshets reported at 3 feet 6 inches.\n\nRefuge Houses.\u2014The Port Commissioners maintain a series of shelters or Refuges along the east face of the H\u00fagl\u00ed estuary and the adjoining Sundarbans. The Refuges are clearly marked on the charts, and are supplied with provisions and a few necessary tools for the use of shipwrecked mariners. They are regularly inspected; but notwithstanding every effort of the authorities, it is right to mention that they are still frequently plundered of their stores, and might in an emergency be found destitute of provisions or appliances of any sort. The violence of the south-western monsoon, and the cyclones which at intervals rage in the north of the Bay of Bengal, render these Refuges an important work of humanity. They have been the means of saving lives which must otherwise have been lost.\n\nThe H\u00fagl\u00ed receives no tributaries except the D\u00e1modar and R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, already mentioned, and the Haldi, a few miles south of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan mouth. It is, however, connected on its left or eastern bank, by various tidal channels and creeks, with the network of distributaries by which the Ganges pours into the sea. Some of these eastern channels form the great waterways for boat and steamer traffic from Calcutta, through the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s and Sundarbans, to Eastern Bengal and Assam.\n\nAfter the junction of the H\u00fagl\u00ed with the D\u00e1modar and R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan from Midnapur District, near the James and Mary Sands, the river represents not only the three westernmost distributaries of the Ganges, but also the whole drainage of South-Western Bengal between the Ganges and the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur watershed.\n\nThe scenery on the banks of the H\u00fagl\u00ed varies greatly. The sea approach is disappointing. For many miles nothing but sandbanks can\nbe seen. These are succeeded by mean-looking mud formations covered with coarse grass, and raised only a few inches above high tide. By degrees cocoa-nut palms seem to stand out of the water on the horizon. As the river narrows above the James and Mary Sands, however, the country is not so low, and grows richer. Trees and rice-fields and villages become common, and at length a section is reached where the banks are high, and lined with hamlets buried under evergreen groves. The palm foliage and feathery bamboos now begin to assert themselves more and more strongly, and give a luxuriant tropical type to the landscape.\n\nWhen at length the Port of Calcutta is reached, a scene of unexpected magnificence, unrivalled in its kind, bursts upon the eye. The long tiers of shipping, with the stately painted mansions of Garden Reach on the margin in the foreground, the fort rising from the great plain on the bank higher up, and the domes, steeples, and noble public buildings of Calcutta beyond, gradually unfold their beauties in a long panorama. The traveller really feels that he is approaching a City of Palaces. The river by which he has reached the capital furnishes one of the greatest triumphs in the contest of man with nature.\n\n**H\u00fagl\u00ed (Hooghly).**\u2014District in the Bardw\u00e1n Division of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 13' 45''$ and $23^\\circ 13' 15''$ N. lat., and between $87^\\circ 47'$ and $88^\\circ 33'$ E. long. H\u00fagl\u00ed District is bounded on the north by the District of Bardw\u00e1n; on the east by the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, separating it from the Districts of Nadiy\u00e1 and the Twenty-four Parganas; on the south by Howrah District; and on the west by Bardw\u00e1n District. Area (excluding Howrah, which was recently erected into a separate District, although for revenue purposes it is still included with H\u00fagl\u00ed District), 1,223 square miles. Population (1881) 1,012,768. The administrative head-quarters are at H\u00fagl\u00ed Town, situated on the west bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District is flat, with a gradual rise to the north and north-west. The scenery along the high-lying bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, which forms the eastern boundary of the District, has a quiet beauty of its own. Indeed, the whole banks of this river, from Guptip\u00e1ra in the extreme north of the District to Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1 in the magisterial District of Howrah in the south, present the appearance of a connected series of orchards and gardens, interspersed with villages, temples, and factories. The principal rivers are the H\u00fagl\u00ed, the D\u00e1modar, and the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan. The H\u00fagl\u00ed nowhere actually crosses the boundary, and the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan only flows through a few miles of Mandalgh\u00e1t pargan\u00e1. The D\u00e1modar is the only large river which intersects the District. It enters H\u00fagl\u00ed from Bardw\u00e1n on the north, and flows first in a southerly and then in a south-easterly direction, until it joins the H\u00fagl\u00ed opposite Falta.\nIt is navigable during the dry weather for a distance of 25 miles from its mouth.\n\nAs stated in the foregoing article on Hugli River, the D\u00e1modar appears formerly to have debouched into the H\u00fagl\u00ed at a point about 39 miles above Calcutta; its old mouth is at present the irrigation channel known as the Kanson\u00e1 kh\u00e1l. Since it has changed its course, it empties its waters into the H\u00fagl\u00ed almost at a right angle opposite Falta, and the silt which it carries with it is thus thrown into the H\u00fagl\u00ed, meeting also the silt suspended in the latter river. A further check to their united streams is given by the waters of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, which enter the H\u00fagl\u00ed 6 miles lower down. The result is a partial obstruction to the force of the current; and the heavy silt falling to the bottom has gradually formed the 'James and Mary' Sandbank, which so seriously interferes with the navigation of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\n\nAs in other alluvial Districts, the highest land lies nearest the rivers, and the lowest levels are generally found midway between two streams. This fact explains the existence of the extensive marshes between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and the D\u00e1modar, and between the latter river and the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan. The principal of these marshes are the R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, D\u00e1nkun\u00ed, and S\u00e1mti jhils, the last of which covers an area of 30 square miles. The Ulub\u00e1ri\u00e1 and Midnapur High-level Canal passes through this District; an account of the canal will be found in the article on MIDNAPUR. There are 5 other canals in the District used for water-carriage; the total length of these is 33 miles.\n\nHistory.\u2014From a historical point of view, H\u00fagl\u00ed possesses as much interest as any District in Bengal, or, indeed, in India. The memories of many nations cluster round its principal towns, and every village on the river bank, which forms the eastern boundary of the District, is associated with some historical event. In the early period of the Muhammadan rule, S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, now a petty village, was the seat of the Governors of Lower Bengal and a mint town, and gave its name to one of the sark\u00e1rs in Todar Mall's rent-roll. Sark\u00e1r S\u00e1tg\u00e1on included not only the District of H\u00fagl\u00ed (with Howrah), but also that of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, with Calcutta, and a portion of Bardw\u00e1n. S\u00e1tg\u00e1on city was the traditional mercantile capital of Bengal from the Pur\u00e1nic age to the time of the foundation of H\u00fagl\u00ed town by the Portuguese in 1537. About this time the channel of the Saraswat\u00ed river, on which S\u00e1tg\u00e1on was situated, began to silt up; and its waters gradually deserted the old Saraswat\u00ed bed for the H\u00fagl\u00ed, which was at that time a comparatively small river. In consequence of this silting up of the Saraswat\u00ed, S\u00e1tg\u00e1on became inaccessible to large vessels, and the Portuguese moved to H\u00fagl\u00ed.\n\nIn 1632, H\u00fagl\u00ed town, having been taken from the Portuguese by the Muhammadans, was made the royal port of Bengal; and the public\noffices and records were withdrawn from S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, which rapidly fell into decay. A few years later, in 1640, the East India Company under a firm\u00e1n from Sult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1, then Governor of Bengal, established a factory at H\u00fagl\u00ed. This was the first English settlement in Lower Bengal; although the Orissa establishment at Pippl\u00ed had already been formed (1624\u201336). In 1669, the East India Company obtained, as a concession, the privilege of bringing their ships up to the town of H\u00fagl\u00ed for the purpose of loading. Until that time they had been compelled to transport their merchandise down to the seaboard in small sloops, and there re-ship them into large vessels.\n\nIt was at H\u00fagl\u00ed, too, that the English first came into collision with the Muhammadan Government of Bengal. In 1685, a dispute took place between the English factors at H\u00fagl\u00ed and the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, and a military force was despatched from England and Madras to strengthen and protect the Company\u2019s factories at H\u00fagl\u00ed. The quarrel was on the point of adjustment, and it is said that the Naw\u00e1b was about to sign a treaty of peace, when an accident frustrated his intentions. A few English soldiers walking in the b\u00e1d\u00e1r at H\u00fagl\u00ed were suddenly attacked by some men belonging to the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s force; the comrades of the former came to their rescue, and a street fight ensued; the English commander bombarded the town of H\u00fagl\u00ed, and his fire burned to the ground five hundred houses, including the warehouses of the Company, containing goods to the value of \u00a3300,000.\n\nThis was not the first time that H\u00fagl\u00ed had been the scene of a struggle with a European power in India. It has been stated that previous to the establishment of H\u00fagl\u00ed as the royal port of Bengal by the Muhammadans, they had captured the place from the Portuguese. On that occasion (1629) it was besieged for three months and a half by a large force sent by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, who had resolved to expel the foreigners from his dominions. The place was carried by storm; more than 1000 Portuguese were killed, upwards of 4000 men, women, and children were taken prisoners, and of 300 vessels of all sizes only 3 escaped.\n\nBut H\u00fagl\u00ed District possesses historical interest for other European nations than England and Portugal. The Dutch established themselves at Chinsurah in the 17th century, and held the place till 1825, when it was ceded to Great Britain in part exchange for the island of Java. The Danes settled at Serampur, where they remained until 1845, when, by a treaty with the King of Denmark, all the Danish possessions in India, consisting of the towns of Tranquebar and Serampur (or Frederiksnagar, as it was called), and a small piece of ground at Balasor formerly occupied as a Dutch factory, were transferred to the East India Company in consideration of the sum of 12\u00bd ldkhs of rupees (\u00a3125,000). Chan-\nDarnagar became a French settlement in 1673, and in the time of Dupleix was a place of some importance. In 1757, Chandarnagar was bombarded by the English fleet under Admiral Watson, and captured, the fortifications and houses being afterwards demolished. On peace being established, it was restored to the French in 1763. When hostilities broke out in 1794, it was again taken by the English, and held by them till 1816, when it was a second time given up to the French, in whose possession it has ever since remained.\n\nThe revenue jurisdiction of the District of H\u00fagl\u00ed was established in 1819. Prior to that time it had formed a part of Bardw\u00e1n, although it had been created a District Magistracy some years earlier. Up to 1829, a single officer exercised the powers of Judge and Magistrate throughout the entire District. Many changes have taken place in the area of H\u00fagl\u00ed from time to time, owing to transfers to and from neighbouring Districts, the latest being the erection of Howrah into a separate District for magisterial purposes.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014The first regular Census of H\u00fagl\u00ed was taken in 1872. The enumeration, on the area comprising the present District after the separation of Howrah, disclosed a population of 1,157,385 persons. The last Census in 1881 returned the population at 1,012,768, showing a decrease of 144,617, or 12'49 per cent., in the nine years. The decrease is attributable to the terrible fever epidemic which for so long devastated the Districts of the Presidency and Bardw\u00e1n Divisions, H\u00fagl\u00ed being one of the tracts which suffered most. The results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 1,223 square miles, with 16 towns and 2,275 villages; number of houses, 263,546, of which 238,619 were occupied and 24,927 unoccupied; total population, 1,012,768, or an average density of 828 per square mile; number of villages per square mile, 1'87; number of houses per square mile, 215; persons per village, 442; persons per house, 4'2. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014488,952 males and 523,816 females; proportion of males, 48'3 per cent. of the District population. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years old\u2014131,680 males and 123,295 females; total children, 254,975, or 25'2 per cent. The excessive proportion of male above female children, while the males only form 48 per cent. of the total population, is due to the fact that here, as elsewhere throughout India, the natives consider that girls attain womanhood at an earlier age than boys reach manhood, and many girls are thus returned as women. The ethnical division of the population is as follows:\u2014Non-Asiatics, 146, of whom the great majority are Europeans; mixed races (Eurasians), 190; Asiatics, 1,012,432. There are few aboriginal tribes in H\u00fagl\u00ed; the total number of aborigines being returned at 4828, of whom the great majority are Dh\u00e1ngars. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 822,972,\nor 81.3 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 188,798, or 18.6 per cent.; Christians, 655; Buddhists, 290; Brahmos, 16; \u2018others,\u2019 37. All the aborigines, except 37 Sant\u00e1ls, are returned as Hindus by religion. Among the high castes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 76,271; R\u00e1jputs, 5530; and K\u00e1yasths, 25,484. Baniy\u00e1s, the chief trading caste, numbered 17,352. Other Hindu castes numbering over 5000\u2014Kaibartta, the most numerous caste in the District, comprising the bulk of the agricultural population, 142,526; B\u00e1gd\u00ed, a semi-aboriginal low caste of fishermen and cultivators, with a reputation for being daring and expert thieves, 134,115; Sadgop, the highest cultivating caste, 61,021; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, cowherds and milk-sellers, 46,134; T\u00e9li, oil pressers and sellers, 38,757; T\u00e1nti, weavers, 29,767; Ch\u00e1m\u00e1r, skinners and leather workers, 21,869; N\u00e1pit, barbers, 13,988; Hari, sweepers, 13,030; Chand\u00e1l, cultivators and labourers, 11,845; Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths, 11,405; Dom, cultivators, fishermen, and basket-makers, 10,825; Jal\u00edy\u00e1, fishermen, 10,369; Kumbh\u00e1r, potters, 9688; Tambul\u00ed, sellers of betel-leaf, 8457; Kalu, oil makers and sellers, 8281; Dhob\u00ed, washermen, 7988; Tior, fishermen, 6687; Mad\u00e1k, sweet-meat makers, 6615. The Muhammadan population are thus divided according to sect\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 176,600; Shi\u00e1s, 10,146; and unspecified, 2052. The Christians of the District comprise 67 British-born Europeans, 77 other Europeans, 1 American, 1 African, 190 Eurasians, 261 natives of India, 28 other Asiatics, and 30 \u2018others.\u2019 As to sect, the Christians include 121 belonging to the Church of England; 133 to the Church of Scotland; 131 are Roman Catholics; 108 are Baptists; 83 returned themselves as Protestants only; the remainder belong to other denominations.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014H\u00fagl\u00ed District contains twelve towns with a population exceeding 5000, namely, Hugli and Chinsurah, given as one town in the Census Report, population 31,177; Serampur, 25,559; Baidyabati, 14,477; Syambazar, 12,462; Balagar, 11,233; Jahanabad, 10,507; Bhadreswar, 9241; Khanakul, 7708; Bali, 7037; Bansbaria, 7031; Kotrang, 5747; and Uttarpara, 5307. These twelve have an aggregate population of 147,486, or 14.5 per cent. of the District population, leaving a balance of 865,282 as forming the rural population. H\u00fagl\u00ed and Chinsurah lie, in fact, so close to each other as to form in reality only one town. Serampur, 13 miles from Calcutta by rail, is interesting both historically (vide supra) and as having been the scene of the labours of the Baptist missionaries Carey, Marshman, and Ward. Among other places of interest are\u2014Chandarnagar, a town on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, already mentioned in the historical section above, and one of the few remaining possessions of the French in India; Bandel, a village on the river bank, about a mile above H\u00fagl\u00ed, containing a Roman Catholic monastery, said to be the oldest\nChristian Church in Bengal; Satgaon, now a miserable village, but once, as has been already stated, the mercantile capital of Bengal; Tribeni, situated at the fabled junction of the Ganges or H\u00fagl\u00ed, the Saraswati, and the Jamuna,\u2014a place of great sanctity, and the scene of many religious gatherings; Pandua, now a small village with a railway station, but in ancient times the fortified seat of a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1; Tarakeswar, a village and terminus of a short line of railway 22 miles in length, branching off from the East Indian Railway at Baidyabati, 15 miles above Howrah, containing a large and richly-endowed shrine of great sanctity, visited at all times of the year by crowds of pilgrims.\n\nOf the 2291 villages and towns comprising H\u00fagl\u00ed District, 981 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 781 between two and five hundred, 359 between five hundred and a thousand, 126 between one and two thousand, 25 between two and three thousand, 7 between three and five thousand, 6 between five and ten thousand, 4 between ten and twenty thousand, and 2 between twenty and fifty thousand.\n\nAs regards occupation, the male population is divided in the Census under six headings:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government officials of all kinds and the learned professions, 18,849; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 10,990; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 15,593; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, 173,994; (5) industrial, 54,792; (6) indefinite and non-productive, comprising general labourers, male children, and unspecified, 214,734.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Rice forms the staple crop of the District. There are three harvests\u2014viz. boro or spring rice; dus or ni\u00e1li, the autumn crop; and \u00e1man or haimantik, the winter rice, which is the principal crop of the year. A considerable quantity of the finer kinds of table rice is cultivated in H\u00fagl\u00ed, chiefly for the Calcutta market. Subordinate cereals grown are barley, wheat, and Indian corn; and among the other crops may be mentioned peas and many varieties of pulse, mustard and other oil-seeds, vegetables, jute, hemp, cotton, sugar-cane, indigo, mulberry, tobacco, and p\u00e1n. Indigo is cultivated in the southern parts of the District, but to a much smaller extent than in former years, many factories having been lately abandoned. Of the total cultivated area of the District, it is roughly estimated that about thirteen-sixteenths are occupied by rice, and the different varieties of vegetables and pulse grown as second crops in winter after the rice has been harvested; the remaining three-sixteenths are under other crops. For land paying 9s. an acre of rent, a fair average out-turn is from 7 to 9 cwt. of unhusked rice per acre; and for superior land, renting at \u00a31, 1s. per acre, from 26 to 33 cwt. per acre. Including the value of the straw and of second crops, the average value of a year\u2019s produce from an acre of land renting at 9s. may be set down at from \u00a31, 10s. to \u00a32;\nand from an acre of land renting at 18s., at about \u00a33, 8s. Rates of rent are high in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, and have considerably increased of late years. First-class paddy land, which formerly rented for 15s. an acre, now pays from \u00a31, 1s. to as much as \u00a31, 16s.; and the rent of inferior paddy land has risen from 7s. 6d. and 9s. to 10s. 6d. and 13s. 6d. an acre. Mulberry and tobacco lands are rented at \u00a31, 4s. to \u00a33 an acre, and sugar-cane lands at from \u00a31, 4s. to \u00a32, 8s. Irrigation of rice and other ordinary crops is resorted to only in case of deficient rainfall; but potato, sugar-cane, and p\u0101n require plentiful irrigation and manure to ensure a fair return. Wages and prices of food-grains have risen greatly of late years. Coolies, who in 1861 received 2\u00bdd. a day, now receive 6d.; carpenters and bricklayers now receive 1s. who were then paid 9d. In 1860, the best quality of unhusked rice sold at 3s. 4d. a cwt.; it now sells at 4s. 1d. a cwt. The price of the best cleaned and husked rice has risen from 6s. 9d. a cwt. in 1860 to 8s. 2d. in 1882\u201383. Common rice in the latter year sold at 4s. 1\u00bdd. a cwt., and wheat at 7s. 10d. a cwt. There is very little spare land in the District. Rotation of crops is practised to a very limited extent; and when lands are allowed to lie fallow, it is only for a few months.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Blight occasionally visit H\u00fagl\u00ed, but, with one exception, they have not affected any crop throughout the entire District. The exceptional case was that of the \u2018Bombay sugar-cane,\u2019 which was totally destroyed by blight in 1860, since which time the cultivation of this valuable crop has been almost entirely abandoned. Floods, which were formerly common in the District, are now of very rare occurrence; protective embankments have been raised by Government along the banks of some of the larger rivers, and no other measures are required. Droughts, caused by deficiency of rainfall, sometimes occur, but not to any serious extent.\n\nThe drought of 1865, which preceded the great famine of the following year, was not much felt in this District; and the effects of the famine itself were much less severe in H\u00fagl\u00ed than in some of the neighbouring Districts. It was not until late in July that the Collector asked for a Government grant; and in August relief-centres were opened. In H\u00fagl\u00ed and Howrah (which were then one District), the average daily number of persons in receipt of relief was\u2014in July, 645; in August, 3242; in September, 6741; in October, 7041; in November, 5941; and in December, 1041. The total sum spent on relief amounted to \u00a35956, of which \u00a3750 was granted by the Board of Revenue, \u00a33390 by the Calcutta Central Relief Committee, while \u00a31816 were raised by private subscription. The means of transit in the District are amply sufficient to prevent the extremity of famine, by importation from other parts. The highest price of rice during the famine of 1866 was 14s. 9\u00bed. per cwt. in November at Chandarnagar.\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District is chiefly carried on by means of permanent markets. The principal exports are\u2014fine rice, silk, indigo, jute, cotton cloth, and vegetables; the chief imports\u2014common rice, English piece-goods, lime from Bardw\u00e1n and Sylhet, timber, etc. The District is said to export more than it requires to import. The principal river marts are Bhadreswar, Chandarnagar, and Baidyab\u00e1ti, at all of which large quantities of agricultural produce are stored for shipment to Calcutta.\n\nThe chief manufactures of H\u00fagl\u00ed are silk and cotton. In the early days of the East India Company, silk and cotton fabrics to the annual value of about \u00a3100,000 were produced here, but the manufacture has gradually decayed, owing to the withdrawal of the Company\u2019s weaving factories and the importation of English piece-goods. The silk and cotton fabrics of the District are of a superior description, and command high prices. Among the other manufactures of H\u00fagl\u00ed are paper, rope, oil, baskets, and pottery.\n\nThe roads in the District are maintained in good order, at an annual cost of about \u00a34000. The East Indian Railway runs through H\u00fagl\u00ed District for a distance of about 40 miles, with stations at Bainch\u00ed, Panduah, Khanyan, Magra, Trisbigha, H\u00fagl\u00ed, Chandarnagar, Bhadreswar, Baidyah\u00e1ti, Seoraphuli, Serampur, and Konnagar. A line of railway, made by a private syndicate of Calcutta, under certain Government concessions, including the free gift of the land required, runs from Baidyab\u00e1ti, on the East Indian Railway, to the pilgrim shrine at Tarakesw\u00e1r. It was formally opened by Lord Dufferin in January 1885. The length of this line is 22 miles.\n\nTwo newspapers are published in H\u00fagl\u00ed, namely, the Education Gazette, a weekly, printed in English and Beng\u00e1li, and a Beng\u00e1li weekly, the S\u00e1dh\u00e1 r\u00e1n\u00ed, both published at Chinsurah. The Friend of India, a well-known weekly English newspaper, was formerly published at Serampur, but is now printed and published in Calcutta. At several towns in the District there are small public libraries.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In revenue matters, as stated above, H\u00fagl\u00ed and Howrah form one District, but in all other matters are quite distinct. Owing to original deficiencies in the records, to the different systems of account which have been employed, and to the alterations in area which have taken place, a comparison of the revenue and expenditure of the District, as returned at different periods, would be worse than useless; but it may be simply stated that the balance-sheet of the District for 1850\u201351 gives the revenue in that year as \u00a3141,522. In 1870\u201371, the revenue had increased to \u00a3239,452, and in 1882\u201383 to \u00a3264,711. The land-tax forms the principal source of revenue, amounting in 1870\u201371 to \u00a3145,462. In 1873, after the area of the District had been considerably reduced by transfers to Bardw\u00e1n and\nMidnapur, the land revenue amounted to \u00a3128,062; in 1882-83, it was \u00a3134,206.\n\nThe sub-division of estates has increased considerably of late years. In 1850, the number of estates was 2784, held by 5775 proprietors, the average payment by each estate being \u00a341, 16s. 11d.; in 1873, the number of estates was 3537, and the average payment from each \u00a336, 4s. 1d.; in 1883, there were 3752 estates, the average payment from each being \u00a338, 8s. 4d.\n\nIn 1860, there were in the combined District of H\u00fagl\u00ed and Howrah 10 magisterial and 22 civil and revenue courts, with 7 covenanted English officers; in 1870, the number of officers was 8, and there were 16 magisterial and 35 civil and revenue courts. In 1882-83, the District of H\u00fagl\u00ed proper contained 10 civil and 19 magisterial courts.\n\nFor police purposes, the District is divided into 11 th\u00e1nds or police circles. The regular and municipal police force of H\u00fagl\u00ed consisted at the end of 1882 of 815 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a312,125. In addition to these, there was in that year a rural police force of 4939 men, costing in money or lands an estimated sum of \u00a313,630. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted in 1882 of 5754 officers and men, or an average of 1 man to every 0'21 of a square mile, or to every 176 of the population. The estimated total cost of maintaining this force was \u00a315,575, giving an average of \u00a32, 14s. 5d. per square mile, or 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. Daka\u00edti, or gang-robbery, was formerly of frequent occurrence, but is now not nearly so common. The French Settlement of Chandarnagar used to afford special facilities for smuggling opium and spirits, but this illicit business has of late been entirely stopped by the police. It is said that a little salt smuggling is carried on in Howrah. In 1882, there were three jails in the District\u2014at H\u00fagl\u00ed, Serampur, and Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d; the daily average number of prisoners was 495.\n\nEducation has spread rapidly of late, the number of aided and inspected schools having increased from 66 in 1856-57 to 193 in 1871-72, and the number of pupils from 7022 to 11,809. The number of such schools in 1877-78 was 625, attended by 22,666 pupils; and in 1882-83, 1579, attended by nearly 32,000 pupils. This is exclusive of uninspected schools; and the Census of 1881 returned 32,990 boys and 746 girls as under instruction, besides 67,665 males and 1643 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The principal educational institution in the District is the H\u00fagl\u00ed College, with its attached collegiate school and law class, which was, in 1882-83, attended by 519 students. The College is maintained out of funds derived from landed property, fees, and endowments invested in\nGovernment stock. The Muhammadan Madrasa was attended by 40 pupils at the end of 1882-83.\n\nFor administrative purposes, H\u00fagl\u00ed District is divided into 3 Sub-divisions\u2014(1) The Sadr or head-quarters Sub-division; (2) Serampur; and (3) Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-division. The District contains 14 municipalities, with an aggregate population of 151,757; the total municipal income in 1883 was \u00a312,943, of which \u00a311,332 was derived from taxation; average rate of municipal taxation, 1s. 5\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of H\u00fagl\u00ed does not differ from that of Lower Bengal generally. The ordinary maximum temperature may be taken at 96\u00b0 F., and the ordinary minimum at 60\u00b0. The average annual rainfall for a period of 18 years ending in 1881 is returned at 60\u00b742 inches. The total rainfall in 1881 was 64\u00b775 inches, or 4\u00b733 above the average, and in 1882, 50\u00b793 inches, or 9\u00b749 inches below the average.\n\nThe diseases of the District are those common to this part of the country\u2014fevers, cholera, dysentery, etc. The epidemic malarious fever, which has raged at intervals during the last quarter of a century throughout the Bardw\u00e1n and Presidency Divisions of Bengal, will be found referred to in the article on BARDWAN DISTRICT. It made its first appearance in H\u00fagl\u00ed District in 1861, and since then it has been gradually extending its ravages from village to village; and there is now hardly a spot in the District which has not been visited by it. There are no accurate statistics to show the extent of the mortality, but the disease is said to have carried off more than half of the population, and to have almost depopulated certain villages. An estimate in the Census Report of 1881 puts down the loss of life from this fever during the 12 years from 1862, when it first appeared in this part of the country, to 1874, when it abated, at no less than 650,000 in H\u00fagl\u00ed District alone.\n\nThe special dispensaries established during the ravages of the fevers were closed in 1875, and since then the fevers of the District have been the ordinary seasonal malarious fevers of the country. Permanent dispensaries are established at H\u00fagl\u00ed, Serampur, Uttarp\u00e1r\u00e1, Bainch\u00ed, Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, Baidyab\u00e1ti, Dwarbasini, Bandipur, and Roshra. These dispensaries afforded medical relief in 1882 to 1564 in-door and 37,470 out-door patients. The number of deaths registered in the District in 1882 was 23,273, or at the rate of 22\u00b797 per thousand of the population.

Area, 442 square miles, with 873 villages or towns and 86,680 houses. Population (1881) 308,217, namely, Hindus, 226,092, or 73.3 per cent.; Muhammadans, 81,810, or 26.6 per cent.; Christians, 290; and 'others,' 25. Number of males, 147,555\u2014females, 160,662; proportion of males in total population, 47.8 per cent. Average density of population, 697 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.98; persons per village, 353; houses per square mile, 221; persons per house, 3.6. The population in 1872 was returned at 363,114, showing a decrease of 54,897, or 15.12 per cent. in nine years, owing to the ravages of malarial fever described in the article on H\u00fagl\u00ed District. This Sub-division comprises the 5 police circles (th\u00e1nds) of H\u00fagl\u00ed, Bal\u00e1g\u00e1rh, Panduah, Dhaniakh\u00e1l\u00ed, and Polba. In 1883 it contained 5 civil and revenue and 8 magisterial courts; strength of regular District police, 406 men, with 1,794 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nH\u00fagl\u00ed.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; situated on the right or east bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river. Lat. $22^\\circ 54' 44''$ N., and long. $88^\\circ 26' 28''$ E. H\u00fagl\u00ed and Chinsurah immediately to the south form a single municipality, and the two towns were treated as one in the enumeration of 1881. Population of H\u00fagl\u00ed-cum-Chinsurah, (1872) 34,761; (1881) 31,177, viz. 15,382 males and 15,795 females\u2014Hindus, 24,916; Muhammadans, 6017; Christians and 'others,' 244. Area of town site, 3,840 acres. Gross municipal revenue, 1883\u201384, \u00a34326, of which \u00a33894 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 5\u00bdd. per head. Railway station on the East Indian Railway, 25 miles from Calcutta. The principal building is an Im\u00e1mb\u00e1r\u00e1, constructed out of funds which had accumulated from an endowment left by a wealthy Shi\u00e1 gentleman, Muhammad Mohsin.\n\nH\u00fagl\u00ed is said to have been founded by the Portuguese in 1537, on the decay of Satgaon, the royal port of Bengal, a decay caused by the silting up of the Saraswat\u00ed river, on which it was situated. Upon establishing themselves, the Portuguese built a fort at a place called Gholgh\u00e1t (close to the present H\u00fagl\u00ed jail), vestiges of which are still visible in the bed of the river. This fort gradually grew into the town and port of H\u00fagl\u00ed. But the Portuguese made themselves very unpopular with the Mughal Governor of Bengal. About 1621, Prince Kharram, afterwards the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, revolted against his father, the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. He was defeated, and fled to Bengal, where he solicited the assistance of the Portuguese at H\u00fagl\u00ed, and asked to be furnished with troops and artillery. The Portuguese governor refused, and taunted the prince with being a rebel. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n never forgave the refusal and the insult. Eight years afterwards, shortly after\nhis accession to the throne of Delhi, a representation was made to him by the Governor of Bengal that some European idolaters who had been allowed to establish factories at H\u00fagl\u00ed had mounted their fort with cannon, and had grown insolent and oppressive. The Emperor, glad of this pretext, gave orders that they should be immediately expelled from his dominions.\n\nA large force was accordingly marched against the Portuguese at H\u00fagl\u00ed, and, after a siege of three and a half months, the fort was carried by storm, over 1000 Portuguese being slain, and upwards of 4000 men, women, and children were taken to the Emperor at Agra as prisoners of war. After the capture of H\u00fagl\u00ed by the Muhammadans, the seat of the royal port of Bengal was removed thither from S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, together with all the records and offices.\n\nThe English factory at H\u00fagl\u00ed dates from 1640, being established under a firman granted to Dr. Boughton, a surgeon in the East India Company's service, who had cured a favourite daughter of the Emperor's of a dangerous illness. It was at H\u00fagl\u00ed, also, that the English first came into collision with the Muhammadan Government. In 1685, a dispute took place between the English factors at H\u00fagl\u00ed and the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, arising out of the oppressions and exactions which the former suffered at the hands of the native officials. Ultimately, in 1688, war was declared between the English and Mughals, and a force was despatched by the home and Madras authorities to strengthen and protect the Company's factory at H\u00fagl\u00ed. This expedition alarmed the Emperor, who hastened to end the quarrel and make peace by promising to redress the grievances complained of by the English. The Naw\u00e1b is said to have been on the point of signing a treaty, when an accident frustrated his intentions. A few English soldiers, walking in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r of H\u00fagl\u00ed, were suddenly attacked by some men belonging to the Naw\u00e1b's force. The comrades of the former came to their rescue, and a street fight ensued. The town of H\u00fagl\u00ed was bombarded by the English commander, and 500 houses burned to the ground, including the warehouses of the Company itself. The English factors embarked on the expeditionary ships, and H\u00fagl\u00ed was for a time abandoned by the Company's servants. They were, however, invited to return by the Emperor, and the peace was signed under which the Company obtained permission to build a fortified factory at Sutanat\u00ed, the present site of Calcutta\u2014a peace which lasted for upwards of seventy years.\n\n**Hugri (Hagri or Vedavati).** \u2014 River of Southern India, rises in Mysore State, and flows 125 miles into the Tungabhadra at Halekota in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 43' 20\" N., long. 76\u00b0 57' 50\" E. The Hugri, better known under its name of Vedavati, is a shallow and broad stream, rarely navigable.\nHujra.\u2014Town in Montgomery District, Punjab, and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1nd), situated in lat. $30^\\circ 44' 30''$ N., long. $73^\\circ 52' E.$, on the Kh\u00e1nw\u00e1 Canal, about 16 miles from the railway station of W\u00e1n R\u00e1dha R\u00e1m. Old fort, containing the police station and village school; post-office. Population not returned in the Punjab Census Report for 1881. Residence of an important j\u00e1gtrd\u00e1r family of Sikhs, a branch of the Bedis, descendants of Guru B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak. Originally held by a Sayyid proprietor; conquered by Bedi S\u00e1hib Singh during the reign of Ranj\u00edt Singh, and held by him in j\u00e1gtr from the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. His descendants still hold extensive revenue grants in the neighbourhood, and exercise considerable local influence.\n\nHukeri.\u2014Town in Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency; 30 miles north-north-east of Belg\u00e1um town.

Connected with the high-road to Poona (P\u00fana), and with Chikori and the large town of Gok\u00e1k by metalled roads. Hukeri is a Mahalkar's station and has a post-office. On the outside of the town, to the north, there are some interesting Muhammadan remains, including two domed tombs in the same style as those at Blj\u00e1pur. One of the tombs is kept in repair and furnished for the use of the Collector, or as a rest-house for travellers. A few miles to the east there is another large tomb of the same architecture. The celebrated falls of Gok\u00e1k are within 12 miles of Hukeri, and can be visited from thence in a day. The town is abundantly supplied with good water by means of an underground pipe connected with a spring to the north-west. This system of water-supply dates from the period of Muhammadan rule.\n\nHuliy\u00e1r ('Tiger Town').\u2014Village in Chitaldr\u00fag (Chitaldroog) District, Mysore State; 51 miles south-east of Chitaldr\u00fag town.

Lat. $13^\\circ 51' N.$, long. $75^\\circ 16' E.$ Population (1881) 840, almost exclusively Jains. Traditionally said to have been the capital of a Jain principality of the Solar line, founded by Jina-datta, who came from Mathura (Muttra) in Upper India. Existing ruins indicate the site of a large town. The oldest inscriptions found\ndate from the 10th century. It is probable that the town was founded under the Ch\u0101lukya dynasty in the 8th century. The capital was subsequently removed to Karkala in South K\u0101nara. The succession of gurus or Jain priests has been continued from of old to the present day.\n\n**Hungund.**\u2014Sub-division of Kal\u0101dgi District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 518 square miles; land revenue (1881), \u00a312,104. Contains 3 towns and 157 villages. Population (1881) 80,037, namely, 39,659 males and 40,378 females.

Population (1872) 4293; (1881) 5670, of whom 3934 were Hindus, 1592 Muhammadans, and 144 Christians. The trunk road from Seringapatam branches off at H\u016bns\u016br to Merk\u0101ra and Cannanore; and the brisk traffic supports an extensive manufactory of country carts, which has given rise to the local name of Gadipalya for the town. It is also the head-quarters of the breeding establishment of the amrit mah\u0101l, a select breed of draught cattle said to have been formed by Haidar Al\u012b for military purposes, and still kept up by Government. Until 1864, a tannery, a manufactory of kambl\u012bs or country blankets, and a timber yard were maintained here by the Madras Commissariat. The traditions of excellence in workmanship in these various trades are still continued by private enterprise. The breed of sheep, from the wool of which kambl\u012bs are made, has been improved by a cross with merinoes imported by the State. Boots, knapsacks, and pouches were once the chief articles of local industry. Large coffee works have recently been erected, where the berry, sent down from the Coorg (K\u016brg) estates, is prepared for shipment. Bone-crushing works have also been established. H\u016bns\u016br is the headquarters of the Periyapatn\u0101 taluk.\n\n**Hunza.**\u2014Mountain State in Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n.

The population consists chiefly of Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput zamind\u00e1rs and cultivators, and of Cham\u00e1r labourers and sub-tenants. Cultivation in the neighbourhood is much impeded by the existence of high grass, which harbours large numbers of wild pigs, and occasionally tigers. During the Mutiny, Husainpur was plundered by the Guj\u00e1rs, who carried off all the cattle and moveable property they could lay their hands on; and the villagers have never since succeeded in recovering their prosperity.\n\n**Hushi\u00e1rpur.**\u2014District, tahsil, and town in the Punjab. \u2014 See HOSHIARPUR.\n\n**Hutri-durga.**\u2014Hill in the south-east of T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State; crowned with fortifications, captured by Lord Cornwallis in 1792.

Up to the time of Firoz Sh\u00e1h Tughlak, this part of the country is said to have been under the sway of a tribe of the carpenter caste, who lived by robbery and marauding. In the reign of that monarch, about 1374 A.D., the Janw\u00e1r R\u00e1jput, Bari\u00e1r S\u00e1h, after having effectually put down these robbers, received a grant of the tract on condition of keeping the country in order. This was the foundation of the great Ikauna *r\u00e1j*, which continued in the family of the original grantee until the Mutiny, when the estate was confiscated for the rebellion of its owner, part being conferred upon the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kap\u00farthala, and part upon the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur, who belongs to a branch of the Ikauna family, which separated from the parent stem upwards of two centuries ago. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1p Singh, belonging to another branch of the same stock, established the Gangw\u00e1l *r\u00e1j* in this *pargan\u00e1* about 1716, and his descendants still hold the estate.

The *pargan\u00e1* contains many interesting Buddhist remains. The village of Tandw\u00e1 is identified by General Cunningham with the Tu-wei of Fa Hian and Hiuen Tsiang, where Kasyapa Buddha was born and lies buried; while a statue of the mother of Saky\u00e1 Buddha is now worshipped in the village as S\u00edt\u00e1.\n\n**Ikauna (Akona).**\u2014Town in Ikauna *pargan\u00e1*, Bahr\u00e1ich District, Oudh; situated 22 miles almost due east from Bahr\u00e1ich town, on the road from that place to Balr\u00e1mpur.

The cradle of the dynasty was at Kel\u00e1di, in Shimoga District, and its members fixed their residence finally at Bednur or Nagar. Bednur was captured by Haidar Alf in 1763, and the territory of the Kel\u00e1di chiefs was annexed to Mysore. The dynasty, however, took its name from Ikkeri, and its currency was known as Ikkeri pagodas and phanams, even after the mint was removed. The walls of Ikkeri were of great extent, formed of three concentric enclosures. In the middle stood the palace and citadel, built of mud and timber, and adorned with carving and gold.

Scarcely a stone of the ancient capital remains standing; but the village of Indarp\u00e1t and the Muhammadan fort of Pur\u00e1na K\u00edla probably occupy the true site, while the modern name is obviously a corruption of the old Hindu title. Indrapr\u00e1sth\u00e1 was probably founded in the 15th century B.C. by the earliest Aryan colonists of India; and the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata relates how the five P\u00e1ndavas, Yudhisthira\nand his brethren, leading a body of settlers from Hastinapur on the Ganges, expelled the savage N\u00e1gas, and built their capital upon this spot.
