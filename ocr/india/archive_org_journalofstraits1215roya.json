J. Irving, c.m.g., in the Chair.\nThe Hon'ble A. M. Skinner, Vice-President; the Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell, Honorary Secretary; E. Koek, Esquire, Honorary Treasurer; H. L. Noronha, Esquire, Councillor; and the following other Members:\u2014\nThe Hon'bles W. H. Read and James Graham; Messrs. C. B. Buckley, R. W. Hullett, J. Fraser, W. Bicknell, A. Knight.\n\nThe minutes of the previous general meeting were read, approved of, and signed by the Chairman.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary read the Report of the Council for the year 1883 (vide p. xiii), and the Accounts of the Honorary Treasurer for the same year (vide p. xvii).\n\nMr. Buckley moved, seconded by the Hon'ble W. H. Read, that the Report and Accounts be approved. Carried unanimously.\nThe names of the new members mentioned in the Report as having been elected by the Council since the last general meeting were then submitted for the approval of the meeting. These were, by a unanimous vote, formally approved.\n\nThe election of the two honorary members mentioned in the Report\u2014the Revd. R. G. Lawes, New Guinea, and the Revd. J. E. Tenison-Woods\u2014were also unanimously confirmed, on the motion of the Hon'ble J. Graham, seconded by the Hon'ble A. M. Skinner.\n\nThe election of President and Members of the Council, was then proceeded with.\n\nMr. Irving stated that he should be leaving Singapore before long for some time, and suggested, in view of that, that some other gentleman should be elected to the position of President. He suggested the name of the Hon'ble Cecil C. Smith, whose return might be expected shortly.\n\nMr. Buckley suggested that the matter might be left till Mr. Irving was really going away.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary said that, pending another general meeting, it would be sufficient to have the Vice-President in the chair during Mr. Irving's absence.\n\nThe Chairman thought it would be best to elect Mr. C. C. Smith now, remarking that Mr. Smith would be here very soon. For his own part, he believed there would not be, in all probability, another meeting before his departure, at which he could be present.\n\nThe election by ballot was then proceeded with, with the following result:\n\nPresident, ..................... The Hon'ble C. J. Irving.\nVice-President, at Singapore, The Hon'ble A. M. Skinner.\nVice-President, at Penang, D. Logan, Esquire.\nHonorary Secretary,........... The Hon'ble W. E.

Knight, Esquire.\nPROCEEDINGS.\n\nSome conversation ensued as to the approaching return of Dr. Bieber, who was spoken of by various members as an enthusiastic member of the Society and one who would fill the office of Vice-President with ability.\n\nMr. Skinner, in reply to a question, said that the maps (to which reference is made in the Report of the Council) would now be prepared.\n\nA vote of thanks to the Chairman closed the proceedings.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1883.\n\nThe Council are happy in being able to report that the affairs of the Society are financially satisfactory, and that there is every reason to hope that, by its agency, good work is being done in the encouragement of research and the extension of scientific knowledge in the Far East.\n\nThe following new members have been elected by the Council since the last general meeting, and their names are now submitted for confirmation:\u2014R. N. Bland, Esq., c. s.; W. A. Bicknell, Esq.; the Rev. R. G. Lawes, New Guinea, (Honorary Member); F. Pooles, Esq.; C. B. Buckley, Esq.; C. V. Creagh, Esq.; A. Knight, Esq.; H. Brooke Low, Esq.; His Royal Highness Prince Krom Mun Dewaowongse Varoprakar; J. A. Parsons, Esq.; N. Cantley, Esq.; C. B. Rickett, Esq.; the Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods, (Honorary Member).\n\nThe following have retired:\u2014Dr. Large; J. Ross, Esq., Junr.; A. H. Thompson, Esq.\n\nThe deaths of two members have been announced\u2014Frank Hatton, Esq., and C. Emmerson, Esq.\n\nRegular periodical meetings for the purpose of reading and discussing papers upon subjects of interest have been found impossible for some time past, but it is hoped that they may be recommenced, should the Society at any time find a permanent home in\nANNUAL REPORT.\n\nthe proposed Museum. The objects of the Society are not limited to the publication of a Journal; and it is felt that they would be advanced in many ways had members greater opportunities for meeting and for receiving and communicating suggestions as to subjects for enquiry and research.\n\nThe text book of Geography mentioned in the last Annual Report has not yet been completed. Great difficulty has been encountered in arranging for its production by a competent hand. It is now being completed under the direction of Mr. Skinner, and it is believed that it will be made over to the Government for publication early in the year.\n\nIt has been proposed that the Council shall undertake the republication of a selection of papers relating to the Eastern Archipelago from the Journals of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Madras Literary Society, &c., &c. Many papers scattered through the volumes of the proceedings of these and other Societies are of great local interest. Marsden, Raffles, Leyden, Crawfurd and Low contributed to \"Asiatic Researches;\" Newbold's papers on the Malay States, and Cantor's Catalogues of Malayan Animals, Reptiles and Fishes, are to be found in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal; a journey of Logan's through part of the Peninsula is printed in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. These and many other papers, if collected and republished, will, it is believed, be eagerly read by residents in the Straits of Malacca, who would never have the opportunity of consulting the files of the Journals in which they originally appeared. The permission of the Asiatic Society of Bengal has been asked for the republication of papers contained in their Journal; and Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. will undertake the production of two volumes, to begin with, if the Society will take two hundred copies.\n\nWith the object of extending our knowledge of the Geography of the Peninsula, arrangements have been made for the preparation, for the use of the Society, of a skeleton map of the Peninsula on a scale of a quarter of an inch to a mile, upon which all new information will be entered, from time to time, as exploration advances.\nANNUAL REPORT.\n\nA Catalogue of the Books belonging to the Society has been prepared and is attached to this Report. Steps will be taken to have volumes of the foreign Journals suitably bound.\n\nThe news of the death in Borneo, from a gun-accident, of Mr. Frank Hatton, a member of this Society, was received here in March last, and the following Minute was entered upon the Minutes of the Council of the Society held on the 11th June, 1883:\u2014\n\n\"The President and Council of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society desire to record the great regret with which they have heard of the premature death of Mr. Frank Hatton, F.C.S., who had evinced great interest in the objects of the Society, and whose ability and industry had led them to hope for much valuable scientific work from him in connection with Borneo.\"\n\nThe ordinary members of the Society have had too frequently but little time to give to literary pursuits and scientific studies. Still, nevertheless, the Council appeal to those whose personal tastes may lead them to take up any of the numerous branches of investigation within the reach of any one living in these regions; and to those whose residence in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Siam, &c., may enable them to note and record features of native life, folklore, superstition, &c., or to gather vocabularies of the languages of little known tribes,\u2014to do their share in adding to the store of knowledge bequeathed to us by earlier students.\n\nThe Journal of the Indian Archipelago, conducted by J. R. Logan, from 1847 to 1859, numbered amongst its contributors, Bishop Bigandet of Rangoon, Bishop Le Fevre of Cochin China, and the Abb\u00e9 Favre (author of excellent dictionaries of the Javanese and Malay languages). The body of devoted men whom the Mission \u00c9trang\u00e8res of Paris maintain in Indo-China have exceptional opportunities for Oriental studies, and no doubt number among them scholars of ability. Will not some of them, and missionaries of other denominations, aid in the objects of this Society? Naval Officers of our own and foreign Navies on the China Station sometimes visit localities which have been seldom or never described, or observe meteorological phenomena which it would be useful to record. Papers on such subjects would be welcomed. Members living in the Native States in the Peninsula, have still facilities for\ncollecting and recording particulars of customs, ceremonies, superstitions and observances which belonged to the purely Malay political organisation, and which, already rapidly disappearing, will die out altogether, as district after district is opened up, and foreign ideas assert their ascendancy. The opportunity for doing this in P\u00earak and Kedah should be seized before it is too late.\n\nThe following papers have been published in the Journal of the Society since the last general meeting:\u2014\n\n\"Journal of a Trip from Sarawak to Meri;\" by N. Denison.\n\"The Mentra Traditions;\" by D. F. A. Hervey.\n\"Probable Origin of the Hill Tribes of Formosa;\" by J. Dodd.\n\"Sea Dyak Religion;\" by the Rev. J.

There is little reason to believe that any considerable portion of the subscriptions reported as outstanding will not be recovered.\n\nW. E.

The Jungle-fowl.\n\nThe common Jungle-fowl, the \"Ayam-utan\" of the Malays, is exceedingly plentiful throughout the Native States; but I never met with it on the island of Singapore, and it is not common, if, indeed, found at all, on Pulau Penang.\n\nWhether or not the Malay species, Temminck's G. bankiva, is really distinct from the Indian, it is hard to say; but if it is distinct, both kinds are certainly found in the Malay countries; for, while stationed in P\u00earak, I shot, out of the same tract of jungle, unmistakable specimens of G. ferrugineus, with the rich golden hackles and white ear-patches, also birds of far darker, in one case almost black, plumage. But the wild Jungle-fowl interbreed so much with domestic roosters from the villages, that I cannot help thinking these dark-coloured birds to be the results of such intercourse, particularly as many of them, though very unlike the typical G. ferrugineus, are not like one another, varying much in the intensity of their colouring.\nIn P\u00earak I found Jungle-fowl breeding from March to July; and the young, when three or four weeks old, were capital eating\u2014far better than the full-grown bird, which has but little more game flavour than the ordinary domestic fowl.\n\nAt the first glimmer of daylight, and again towards evening, the Jungle-cocks may be heard in all directions, crowing loudly, and by very careful stalking may occasionally be got at; but I found far the most successful plan was, either early in the morning, or else about sunset, to sneak quietly along the edges of clearings and patches of cultivation, which at those times the Jungle-fowl frequent in search of food; and in this way; by dodging from bush to bush, I frequently rendered a good account of them. But it required the most careful stalking, as on the slightest alarm the birds ran into the thick jungle, where it was almost useless to follow them. Once or twice I shot them in thick cover by letting my dog hunt them up into the trees, which they did not leave till I was within range.\n\nIn Province Wellesley the Malays decoy Jungle-fowl by imitating the crowing and flapping of the wings of the cock, when the birds coming to accept the supposed challenge are shot.\n\nThe following are descriptions of birds I shot near Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00earak:\u2014The cock, though in magnificent plumage, wanted the white ear-coverts; he was about 22 inches in length, tarsus 3 inches; irides orange; head and neck covered with long golden hackles, darkest on the head and nape; the back and long upper tail-coverts rich chestnut, the latter of a golden hue; primary and secondary wing-coverts black, glossed with metallic shades of purple and green; lesser coverts rich maroon; wing-quills dusky, with rufous margins to the outer webs; tail black, glossed with green; underparts dull black, with some of the feathers edged with brown.\n\nThe hen is of much plainer plumage. Upper parts brown, minutely freckled with a paler and more rufous shade of the same colour, with some of the feathers pale-shafted; the hackles are black, short, and edged with yellow; underparts pale rufous-brown; the feathers of the breast pale-shafted; length of bird about 15 inches.\nGallus varius (Shaw.).\n\nIn the Botanical Gardens at Singapore there was a specimen of this handsome Jungle-fowl; but probably it had been imported.\n\nExcalfactoria chinensis (Linn.). The Blue-breasted Quail.\n\nThis tiny but most beautifully marked Quail swarms throughout the Malay States, being found in almost every dry paddy-field or tract of scrub and grass-covered ground. It is difficult to flush, not rising until almost trodden on; then, after skimming over the grass with a Partridge-like flight for fifty or sixty yards, it drops like a stone, and is hard to put up again, even with a dog.\n\nThe sudden way in which they drop to the ground frequently deceives the inexperienced sportsman, who, thinking he has made a successful shot, hurries to where the bird apparently fell, and makes a long and fruitless search, while the object of his pursuit is running as hard as it can lay legs to the ground to a distant part of the field.\n\nThey are very good eating, but so small as to be scarcely worth a charge of shot; and after being a few weeks in the country, and ceasing to look on them as a novelty, one seldom fires at them, confining one's attention to larger game, in the shape of Snipe, Plover, &c.\n\nThe sexes are very unlike in plumage, the male being by far the more handsome and brightly-coloured bird. One, shot near Sai-yong, Perak, on 24th April, was $5\\frac{1}{4}$ inches long; irides deep crimson; legs bright orange; beak black; head and upper parts brown; feathers of the back pale-shafted, and banded, mostly on one web only, with black; wings pale brown, some of the coverts edged with rufous and bluish grey; forehead, cheeks, sides of neck, and breast bright bluish grey; moustache-streak and broad crescentic mark on throat pure white, bordered by a deep black line; chin and throat black; abdomen ruddy chestnut. The female is not nearly so boldly marked: one, shot at Singapore on 7th November, measured $5\\frac{1}{4}$ inches in length, tarsus $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch; legs orange; irides red-brown; supercilium, throat, and forehead rufous brown; chin dull white; breast dingy brown, with narrow black cross bars; feathers of flanks much lengthened; the white and black markings of the throat, also the chestnut abdomen of the male, were wanting.\nROLLULUS BOUROUL (Scop.). The Crested Partridge.\n\nThough not rare, this bird is seldom seen, being very shy, and on the approach of danger trusting to its legs rather than taking flight. All my specimens were snared in the neighbourhood of Ku\u00e2la Kangsa.\n\nCaptain Wardlaw-Ramsay tells me he found it plentiful round Mount Ophir; and I saw several skins in Malaccan collections. These birds thrive well in confinement, but are not easily tamed: some which were in my aviary for several months were always wild, hiding directly any one appeared in sight; but early in the morning, when all was quiet, and they thought they were not observed, they used to come out of their hiding-places and feed on rice and Indian corn.\n\nThe male is very handsome, with a crest of red plumes on its head; the female is without the crest, and of much duller colours than her mate.\n\nRHIZOTHERA LONGIROSTRIS, (Temm.).\n\nWhile stationed at Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00earak, a Malay brought me one of these curious Pheasant-like birds, which he had snared, and I put it in my aviary; but it only lived a few weeks.\n\nI also saw a couple in confinement, at Singapore, in Mr. Whampoa's garden; but he could not tell me anything about them, not even where they came from. They were about the size of a domestic hen, wings and tail short, legs whitish, tarsus spurred; irides dark brown; beak black, sharp, and very much curved; plumage rich brown, mottled and spotted with a darker shade of the same colour; at the base of the neck and on each side of it was a greyish-blue patch; feet and claws very large and powerful.\n\nTo a casual observer these birds look like the hens of some species of Pheasant. They are known among the Malays by the name of \"Burong salantung.\"\n\nTURNIX PLUMBIPES (Temm.). The Black-breasted Bustard-Quail.\n\nFor some time I put down this Bustard-Quail as Sykes's T. tai-goor; but apparently it is distinct from that species.\n\nIt is very plentiful throughout Western Malayana; but I rarely found more than two or three together; in fact, I generally flushed\nthem singly, and, as a rule, on ground covered with scrub or long grass. Like all the Quails, they are very difficult to put up, trusting to their legs more than their wings.\n\nIn my note-book I have written as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00earak, 8th June, 1877.\u2014To-day I shot a female specimen of the Malayan Turnix, almost identical with T. taigoor of Sykes: my bird measures 6\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches; irides yellowish white; bill and legs bluish lead-colour; it has but three toes; throat and upper part of breast black; under-parts and the wings rufous brown, barred on the wings and lower part of the breast with black; head and neck freckled with black and white spots; claws white; weight slightly over 2 oz.\n\n\"When walking through the jungle I often flush these Quail. Small open patches appear to be their favourite resorts; and I very seldom find them in the paddy-fields, where the little Excalfactoria chinensis swarms.\"\n\nAmong the \"lalang\" grass round the barracks at Singapore, Bustard-Quail were very common, breeding during May, June and July.\n\nOn 1st July I found a brood of five young ones running about with their mother among the flower-beds in the Botanical Gardens, and on 24th August disturbed a family of them in the long grass close outside our mess; they could not fly more than a few yards at a time, so were easily caught.\n\nOne I carefully examined, though fully feathered, could scarcely fly at all, but ran at a great pace, and showed much cleverness in hiding itself by crouching flat on the ground, taking advantage of any hole or depression; its irides were straw-colour, like those of the adult.\n\nI used to see the Malays in P\u00earak employ these birds as decoys to catch others of their kind, much in the same way as Dr. Jerdon in his \"Birds of India\" describes it as being done by the natives in the south of India.\n\nThe decoy, usually a hen bird, is enclosed in a small wicker cage, having an arrangement by which, on the breaking of a thread which is stretched across the bars, a net springs over the front of the cage. This contrivance is placed in a likely spot in the jungle: and the\nwild Quails, attracted by the \"calling\" of the decoy, try to get at it, and, fluttering against the outside of the bars, break the thread, set free the spring-net, and are caught.\n\nDr. Jerdon says that in India all the birds thus caught are hens, as are the decoys: unfortunately I neglected to see if such was the case in P\u00earak; but if so; it conclusively proves that it is not sexual desire, but their pugnacity, that is so fatal to them. The female is the larger and by far the more handsome bird of the two, the male wanting the deep-black throat and upper breast, and being altogether less boldly marked.\n\nGlareola orientalis (Blyth.).\n\nThe Swallow-Plover is very common during the seasons of migration, arriving at the same time as the Golden Plover, Charadrius fulvus; but I never met with it at other times of the year. During March, and again in September and October, great numbers pass over the island of Singapore; but they are then so tame that it is poor sport shooting them: often they squatted so closely that I walked within a few yards before they would rise; then they frequently settled again after flying a short distance. Perhaps this extraordinary tameness was owing to the fatigue occasioned by migrating. I noticed that they were generally found in large flocks on cultivated ground, and were particularly fond of ploughed land, more especially if it was on a hillside.\n\nThe vernal migration takes place early in the year; in my notebook is the following passage:\n\n\"Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00earak, 22nd February, 1877.\u2014This afternoon I paddled down the P\u00earak river in a canoe to Kampong Saiyong, accompanied by H\u2014\u2014\u2014, on our way getting a Golden Plover out of a pair which were sitting on a sand-bank in the middle of the river.\n\n\"A little further on, on another sand-bank, we saw an enormous flock of birds, which every now and then rose with shrill cries, and after flying a few yards settled again, squatting flat on the sand. Not knowing what they were, we stalked them, and bagged six, losing three more, which fell into the river and were swept away.\n\n\"At first I took them to be the European Pratincole, but now see, as stated by Jerdon, that they differ from that species in having the tail less forked; they must be migrating, as on no former\noccasion have I seen any here; and their being in such numbers, and so easily approached, makes it still more probable that they are on passage. When fired at the big flock broke up into small parties of from ten to twenty; but after a short time they all returned to the sand-banks. While on the wing, flying close over the surface of the water, the most noticeable points about them were their Swallow-like wings and white rumps.\"\n\nIn plumage the sexes are alike; but immature birds which I shot in Singapore during September were not nearly so decidedly marked as the adults, moreover they were much mottled and freckled with brown. The pectinated middle claw, large eye, wide gape, their flight, and the way they crouch flat on the ground, all seem to point to a relationship between these birds and the Caprimulgidae.\n\n*Squatatorola helvetica* (Gm.). The Grey Plover.\n\nIdentical with the European species. The Grey Plover is common among the islands and along the coasts of the peninsula from October to March, but appears to breed further north. On 13th April, 1879, I had over a dozen brought to me, which had just been caught on the coast a few miles south of Malacca; and of these one showed considerable signs of the breeding-plumage, its breast being much blotched with black. During October, November and December, some may always be shot on the shores of Pulau Ubin, Pulau Nongsa, and the other rock-girt islands near Singapore; a female which I shot off Pulau Ubin was sitting on an isolated rock in company with a large flock of Ringed Plover (*Egialitis geoffroyi*).\n\n*Charadrius fulvus* (Gm.).\n\nThe Eastern Golden Plover is very plentiful during the northeast monsoon, but goes north in April to breed, returning again to the south of the peninsula towards the end of September. In Perak, during January and February, I found them in large flocks on the edges of all the jheels, particularly those in the neighbourhood of K\u00f4ta L\u00e2ma, Saiyong, and Sengan; but they got scarcer in March. The 8th April was the latest date on which I shot one, which, in company with another, was sitting on a sand-bank in the middle of the Perak river; it had almost fully assumed the black breast of the breeding-season. In 1879, while stationed at Singapore, as late as 13th April, a Malay fisherman brought me a large cage full\nof Terns and shore-birds, which he had netted on the sands near the mouth of the Moar river; and among them were several Golden Plovers, all in various stages of the breeding-plumage; so probably they nest somewhere towards the north of the peninsula, though in Singapore and the south they are most certainly migratory.\n\nIn Singapore, though no very large bags were to be made, they often, during October, afforded me a capital afternoon's sport. In the neighbourhood of Tanglin the best places for them were the Chinamen's gardens and the cultivated hills near Cluny; but there was also good ground near Changi, at Gaylang, and on the Trafalgar estate.\n\nWhen shot at some distance inland they are very good eating; but a coast diet spoils them for the table: some I shot on the sea-shore at Pen\u00e2ga, in Province Wellesley, were quite uneatable, having a strong, fishy, decayed-seaweed kind of flavour.\n\nIn my notes are many references to this species, among them the following:\n\n\"Tanglin, Singapore, 2nd October.\u2014Early this morning three Golden Plovers were running about our lawn-tennis ground, close to the public road; they were very tame, allowing me within a few yards before they rose, and even then flying but a short distance. In the evening, at dusk, while several of us were playing tennis, laughing and talking, a Golden Plover circled round two or three times, then settled on the ground in our midst. I never saw one so tame, but believe it was migrating, and so tired as to be regardless of danger and glad to rest anywhere.\"\n\n\u00c6GIALITIS GEOFFROYI (Wagl.). The Sand-Plover.\n\nFound in great numbers on the coasts of the peninsula during the north-east monsoon. Towards the end of November, 1879, I found enormous flocks of them at low tide on the shore of Pulau Batam; they were then all in the brown-and-white winter plumage. One, which I shot out of a flock of Charadriinae which rose from a rock in mid channel between Pulau Ubin and Singapore, was $8\\frac{1}{4}$ inches in length; irides dark brown; beak at front $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch; legs black; tarsus $1\\frac{5}{6}$ inch; upper parts and streak below the eye dull brown; forehead, tip of tail, and the underparts white; date 10th January.\nThe summer plumage is very different from that of the winter time. In my note-book I find the following notes concerning two specimens obtained alive from the Malaccan coast on 13th April, 1879:\n\n\"The two Sand-Plovers which were brought to me today differ much in appearance; both are *\u00c6. geoffroyi*. My identification has been confirmed by Mr. Davison; so there can be no mistake; but they are certainly very unlike one another, one being in the ordinary brown-and-white winter plumage, the other, a female, in the rufous colours of the breeding-season. This last, Mr. Davison tells me, is the only specimen in summer plumage that he has ever seen in these parts. The following is an accurate description of it:\n\n\"Length 8\u00bd inches, bill at front 1, tarsus 1\u00bd; bill black; irides dark brown; forehead, lores, ear-coverts, and streak below eyes black; spot on each side of forehead, the chin, throat, abdomen, margins of inner webs of the primaries, white; upper parts hair-brown, tinged with rufous, particularly on the head and neck; a broad band round the upper part of the breast bright rufous.\"\n\n*\u00c6gialitis mongolica* (Pall.).\n\nFrequents the coasts during the north-east monsoon. On 23rd November I shot one out of a flock on the shores of Pulau Batam, near Singapore. Length barely 8 inches, tarsus 1\u00bc, beak at front \u00be; upper parts dull brown, tinged, particularly on the wing-coverts, with rufous; the forehead and underparts white, with a rufous tinge, deepest on the breast. It is rather like, but smaller than, *\u00c6. geoffroyi*.\n\n*\u00c6gialitis dubia* (Scop.).\n\nOn 23rd November, 1879, I shot a specimen of this small Ringed Plover out of a party of five on the sandy strand bordering Pulau Batam. At first I thought it was *\u00c6. minuta*; but that bird has the basal half of the beak yellow, while in this the whole of it is black.\n\nI shot another during November on the parade-ground at Tanglin, Singapore.\n\n*Lobivanellus atronuchalis* (Blyth.).\n\nThe Red-wattled Lapwing is common in P\u00earak and L\u00e2rut, frequenting the edges of jheels and the swampy valleys in the jungle. I never found a nest; but they probably breed in the peninsula, as\nI saw a pair near Kuala Kangsa, Perak, as late as the first week in May. Earlier in the year I shot several in the neighbourhood of that place, also some few at a jheel near Sengan, lower down the river.\n\nIn my notes is the following passage:\n\n\"Singapore, 21st November, 1879. This afternoon I shot a few Snipe and Plover in the swampy valley behind our barracks, also put up two Red-wattled Lapwing, one of which I shot. It is exactly like those I used so often to get in Perak; but here it is a rather rare bird, and one seldom hears its plaintive cry, so well rendered in Dr. Jerdon's work by the words 'Did he do it! Pity to do it.' A male, shot at Saiyong, Perak, on 13th April, measured about 12\u00bd inches in length, tarsus 3; beak red, black at its tip; orbits and wattles red; irides red-brown, legs yellow; head, neck, and breast deep black; ear-coverts, streak down each side of neck, band across upper part of the back, abdomen, and the tail white, the last broadly barred with black; upper parts and wing-coverts dull brown, glossed with metallic shades of purple and green; greater coverts broadly tipped with white; wing-quills black; the shoulder furnished with a short blunt spur; hind toe very minute. Its stomach contained vegetable matter and particles of quartz.\"\n\nStrepsilas interpres (Linn.). The Turnstone.\n\nAbout the middle of April, 1877, a Malay brought me a cage of eighteen or twenty Turnstones, which he said he had netted on the sands near the mouth of the Moar river; they were in most beautiful plumage.\n\nI saw large flocks of Turnstones scuttling about at the water's edge on the beach at Pulau Nongsa during September, and shot one or two of them.\n\nGallinago stenura (Temm.). The Pintail Snipe.\n\nAlthough the European Snipe (G. scolopacina) is occasionally found, the one commonly met with in the Malay States is the Pintail Snipe (G. stenura), dozens (I think I may almost say hundreds) of it being obtained for one of the former. But in general appearance the two species are so alike that anybody not a naturalist, nor of a very inquiring nature, may easily shoot throughout a whole season in that land of the longbills, Province Wellesley, without\nknowing that his spoil differs in the least from the well-known Snipe of the British Isles.\n\nBut if, while resting from his labours after a few hours' plodding through mud and water under the blazing sun of those parts, he will turn out his well-filled bag and carefully examine its contents, it will be found that, with hardly an exception, the birds are \"Pintails.\"\n\nThe tait, instead of being of soft rounded feathers, as is the case with the English bird, has eight rigid pin-like feathers on either side, though I have seen specimens in which these stiff feathers were but seven in number. This is the most marked characteristic of the species, and at once determines the identity of a specimen; but the Pintail also has the axillary plumes more richly barred than its European brother\u2014though, unless one had some of each kind laid side by side for comparison, the differences between the two species would probably pass unobserved.\n\nIt is only at a certain season that Snipe abound in the Malay peninsula: from May to July, both months inclusive, it is hard to find a single bird; but about the middle or end of August they begin to arrive in Province Wellesley and Pulau Penang, extending to Malacca and the extreme south of the peninsula, including Singapore, ten days or a fortnight later, though they are not found in great numbers in any of these places until later in September.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule, as the migration is much influenced by the weather; but it may safely be said that the great body of the Snipe do not come south until the commencement of the wet and stormy period which proclaims the breaking-up of the south-west monsoon.\n\nTowards the end of April they return north to their breeding-grounds; and I doubt if any remain to nest in the peninsula, though in Perak I have shot a few stragglers as late as the second week in May.\n\nWith reference to the habits of the Pintail, my experience is that, as a rule, they are not found in any number in the paddy-fields\u2014that is to say, when the crops stand high; and though I once, at Penaga, on November 6, 1877, in about three hours, bagged twenty-five couple on paddy-land, still it was the only occasion I am able\nto record; and then, I believe, their presence was due to the paddy being scattered about in patches and much mixed up with reeds and coarse herbage.\n\nTheir favourite ground is where the jungle has been burned, and the vegetation, just beginning to spring up, shows in green shoots above the blackened soil. Another sure finding-place is rough land, with bushes, small pools of water, and moist places scattered here and there; but everywhere it will be found that during the intense heat of the day the Snipe avoid the open country, and seek shelter from the sun under thick bushes, or in the shade of high jungle. They then lie very close, and when flushed rise with a listless flight, not unfrequently settling again after flying eighty or a hundred yards; but of course this is not the case in districts where they are much shot at and disturbed.\n\nThough undoubtedly, as a rule, the Malay Snipe are not so wild nor so active on the wing as is the European species, still they afford excellent sport, and are by no means easy to shoot, particularly during the early morning, when, revived by the cool night air, they dart and twist along at a great pace; also among bushes it requires very quick and straight shooting to make anything of a bag.\n\nAs soon as the sun gets low they leave the covert and scatter themselves all over the country in search of food; often on moonlight nights, when out in the jungle after pig, on crossing open pieces of ground where, during the day, not a bird could be found, I have heard Snipe rise, squeaking on all sides. One most keen sportsman of my acquaintance sallied forth on one of these very bright nights; but, though the Snipe swarmed, he returned without having done more than frighten them\u2014not to be wondered at, considering how deceptive is the light of even the most brilliant tropical moon.\n\nDuring droughts, when the ground is parched and cracked by the heat, the Snipe probe the buffalo-dung, perforating the heaps with thousands of small holes in their search after the worms which collect beneath.\n\nI think that there can be little doubt that Province Wellesley, opposite the island of Penang, is by far the best Snipe-ground in\nthe peninsula, probably owing to its being extremely flat, well watered, cleared of jungle, and perhaps to its being very near the limit of the migration south. To a very great extent it is covered with paddy-fields; and on the rough uncultivated land bordering these the Snipe are extremely plentiful, enormous numbers often being shot in a day. One morning early in November, 1877, I bagged thirty-five couple by midday, and had quite as good sport on other occasions; but during the season of 1879, which was an exceptionally good one, the birds simply swarming, far larger bags were made, an officer of my regiment having bagged fifty-six couple to his own gun on one day, and fifty-four on another. But this represents good shooting; for it must not be imagined that the birds can be knocked down with a stick. Far from it, anything over twenty couple means really straight shooting and hard work, as the walking is bad and the heat intense.\n\nA good retriever is very useful; but few dogs can stand the sun for any length of time. I used to keep mine closely clipped, except his head and a broad stripe down his back, which proved a great protection to his spine; but in spite of all precautions, after a time, he got altogether out of condition. Without a dog birds are often lost, particularly on bushy ground, though the Malay boys, sharp little urchins, with more intelligence than clothes, who follow and carry one's cartridges, are generally very good at marking down the dead and wounded; still a dog is preferable to the best of human retrievers.\n\nNear Thaipeng, in the native state of Larut, I was once one of a party who attempted to shoot Snipe from elephants; but I cannot advise anyone to go and do likewise, at least if their dinner depends on what they kill. It happened thus. We had been all day in the jungle after a rogue elephant, which had done considerable mischief; but he proved too much for us, and got safely away to the hills without giving anyone the slightest chance of a shot, though at one time we were close to him. In the afternoon, on our way home, we had to pass near a celebrated Snipe-ground of considerable extent, swampy, and much overgrown with low bushes. \"Let's try and shoot some Snipe from our elephants' backs!\" exclaimed one of our number. The novelty of the thing pleased all; so off we\nstarted; and a queer sight it was. Five elephants advanced in line, about a hundred yards apart, each carrying two guns; while in the intervals, but a little in the rear, came several Sikhs of the military police of the district, fine tall fellows in scarlet turbans. These followed us, nominally to pick up the spoil; but, unless it takes five men to carry one Snipe, their labours were light. The Snipe were very plentiful, and for half an hour there was a tremendous banging; but I need hardly say that the result was almost nil. Personally I expended quite thirty or forty cartridges for two Snipe and a green Pigeon; all together I do not believe the ten of us averaged a bird apiece. But it was not to be wondered at; for as \"scaipe! scaipe!\" resounded and up went one's gun, the elephant would make a tremendous plunge, and one's shot went anywhere but towards the object aimed at; often, I expect, much nearer the head of our mahout, or some of our Sikh followers, than was at all pleasant for them. I know it would have taken a good deal to induce me to change places with the mahout, perched as he was on the neck of the elephant, with my companion and myself slung in baskets on either side of the great lumbering brute, and firing away as hard as we could. As we sat sideways in a small cane basket, with our legs dangling over the side, straight shooting was almost an impossibility: for, to say nothing of the jolting of our animal, I, on the off-side, could fire only at birds rising to my left front, and then in a very cramped position; and the man on the near side had similar difficulties to contend with. Between these two firing-points squatted the unfortunate mahout: he never made any remark, except to his charge; but I expect he offered up a prayer of thanksgiving to Mahomet when the whole performance was over and he found his head still on his shoulders.\n\n*Rhynclrea bengalensis* (Linn.).\n\nThe Painted Snipe, as it is called, though not really belonging to the true Snipe, is a bird frequently met with by the sportsman in Malaya.\n\nThe Painted Snipe *may* be a resident and breed in the Malay peninsula, as is the case in India, though my experience inclines me to think it migratory. In any case, if not a true migrant, it certainly moves about the country, only appearing in certain districts at par-\nticular seasons. I never heard of it nesting in the peninsula, and never even saw it except during the north-east monsoon, when it is fairly plentiful, frequenting the same ground as the common Pintail. I have shot Painted Snipe in the north of Perak during the months of January, February, and March, and found them in considerable numbers further south during October.\n\nOut of a bag of twenty couple of Snipe shot in Province Wellesley on November 9, more than half were of the Painted species. They seem to collect in small parties; for when one is flushed two or three more are generally to be found somewhere near; but they rise with a heavy Owl-like flap, as a rule settling again within forty or fifty yards. Thus offering an easy mark, and being moreover poor eating, they are scarcely worth shooting.\n\nThe chief characteristics of the Painted Snipe are the beautiful ocellated plumage and the Curlew-like bill, curved downwards at the tip, also shorter than that of the common Snipe. The female, with the handsome chestnut throat, is larger and more brightly-coloured than the male.\n\nGallinago scolopacina (Bp.).\n\nCompared with the Pintail species, the common European Snipe is rare in the Malay States.\n\nLimosa \u00e6gocephala (Linn.).\n\nPersonally I did not meet with this Godwit; but Mr. Davison showed me a specimen caught with birdlime, at the same time as two Whimbrel, on the rocks off Changi, on the north coast of Singapore.\n\nNumenius arquata (Linn.). The Curlew.\n\nPlentiful along the coasts during the north-east monsoon. I shot a few off Changi and among the islands in the Johor Straits, but found them just as well able to take care of themselves, and just as hard to get at, as in cooler climes.\n\nReferring to a visit I made during November to Pulau Nongsa, a small island off the south coast of Singapore, in my note-book is:\n\n\"The tide being very low, a broad belt of coral-reef surrounded the island, affording feeding-grounds to hundreds of shore-birds of all kinds: so we landed, or rather waded ashore, in hopes of getting at the Curlew and Plover, of which we saw a great many; but, as\nusual, the former were exceedingly wary, and, without giving us the ghost of a chance, made off to a distant sandbank, loudly uttering their shrill cries, as if to deride the unsuccessful sportsman and warn all other birds of his approach.\"\n\nNumenius phleopus (Linn.). The Whimbrel.\n\nFlocks of Whimbrel frequent the coasts during the north-east monsoon. In my notes I find:\n\n\"Singapore, 26th November, 1879. The other day, while shooting Pigeons on Pulau Betam, we put up a large flock of Whimbrel from the belt of mangroves bordering the shore, but did not get a chance at them; but next day Mr. D.\u2014bagged eight in two shots.\"\n\nTringa minuta (Leisl.). The Little Stint.\n\nI shot one of these Stints on Pulau Batam, near Singapore, on 25th November, 1879; it was a male in winter plumage, length about 6\u00bd inches; head and the upper parts whitish brown, the feathers dark-shafted; the two central tail-feathers dark brown, the others dusky, all narrowly edged with white; the underparts white, dusky on the breast; bill at front \u00be inch, tarsus \u00bc.\n\nTotanus glareola (Linn.). The Spotted Sandpiper.\n\nThis Sandpiper is by no means a rare bird; I shot several in P\u00earak and in Singapore. A female, killed at K\u00f4ta L\u00e2ma, P\u00earak, on 19th April, 1877, measured 9 inches, tarsus 1\u00bd, beak at front 1\u00bc; legs dull green; irides dark brown; head, upper parts, and the wings dull brown, spotted with grey; a dusky streak passes from the base of the upper mandible to the eye; supercilium and underparts white, dusky on the breast and much streaked with brown; the upper tail-coverts pure white; tail barred with dark brown. A specimen shot in Singapore during November was less distinctly spotted than the above.\n\nIn my notes I find:\n\n\"Singapore, 18th November, 1879. This afternoon, while Snipe-shooting in the Mount Echo valley, close behind our barracks, I came on a large flock of Spotted Sandpipers (T. glareola) feeding in the swampy fields, which are awful walking, letting one through at every step over one's knees into soft filth. The Sandpipers were rather wild, rising with shrill cries as soon as I got within forty or\nfifty yards, but settling again after flying round and round for a few minutes. Feeding with them were a great many Yellow Wagtails (*Budytes taivanus*); and I got several specimens of both them and the Sandpipers at one shot.\"\n\n**Tringoides hypoleucos** (Linn.).\n\nThe common Sandpiper is plentiful in Singapore and the neighbouring isles; during November, 1879, I found great numbers of them on the shores of Pulau Nongsa and Pulau Batam, and on many occasions saw them settle on the fishing-stakes, which stand five or six feet above the surface of the water. In China I once saw a Sandpiper dive and swim under water with wonderful ease. I find the following notes, made at the time, in my journal:\n\n\"6th October, 1878, Kowloon, near Hongkong. Towards evening we left the hills and returned to our boat, near which, on the sands, we shot a few Waders. One of these, a Common Sandpiper (*T. hypoleucos*), fell wounded into a brook; and my dog ran to retrieve it; but just as he was going to pick it up, it dived like a Duck and swam under water a distance of over twenty yards. The stream was of no width, and the water as clear as crystal; and standing within a couple of paces, I most distinctly saw the bird propelling itself with its wings as it swam beneath the surface of the water.\"\n\n**Parra sinensis** (Gm.). The Pheasant-tailed Jacana.\n\nLate one evening in the first week in May, while shooting near Saiyong jheel, on the Perak river, I was stalking a flock of Teal which had gone down on some swampy ground bordering the water, when something white darted past, which, in the dark, I took to be a Goose Teal, so fired, but found that instead of a Teal I had killed a most beautiful specimen of this handsome bird, the only one I came across in the peninsula, though in India, I believe, it is far from rare.\n\nIt was a male in summer plumage; length $17\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, of which the tail of four long tapering black feathers measures $5\\frac{1}{2}$; irides brown; beak, legs, and toes plumbeous, the toes are very long and slender, and set like the spokes of a wheel, hind claw $1\\frac{1}{8}$ inch; underparts white, barred irregularly with black; a peculiar golden mane passes along the back of the neck; the back and scapulars are brown with a bright purple gloss; wings pure white,\nexcepting the first primary, outer webs of second and third, and borders round the ends of the secondaries, which are black; wing-feathers very lanceolate, the first primary has at its tip a peculiar filament, the fourth is very attenuated and pointed; wing-coverts barred with grey.\n\nPorphyrio calvus (Vieill.). The Purple Coot.\n\nOne afternoon, while Teal-shooting in P\u00e9rak, I was wading about a jheel overgrown with weeds and aquatic plants, among which I shot a specimen, my only one, of this Coot.\n\nIts plumage reminded me much of Porphyrio caeruleus of Europe; but it is smaller than that bird, also its beak and legs are not of such a bright red. It feeds principally on weeds and other green substances. The stomach of the one I shot was very muscular, and contained vegetable matter and a quantity of sand; but possibly they occasionally prey on the young of other birds, as their relation, P. caeruleus, which I shot in Sicily, had there the reputation of killing young wildfowl; also, when visiting Mr. Whampoa, a Chinese gentleman residing in Singapore, he showed me a very handsome pair of these Coots in his garden, but said he was obliged to confine them in a cage, as, when let loose, they killed his chickens.\n\nMy P\u00e9rak specimen, a male, shot on 9th May, 1877, was 17 inches in length; neck, throat, and upper parts of the breast pale greenish blue; back of neck and the abdomen deep purple; vent freckled with grey; under tail-coverts white; wing-coverts light blue; legs, beak, and frontal plate dull red; back and scapulars dark brown tinged with green and blue. Soon after death the beautiful blue of its plumage faded.\n\nThere were two of these Purple Coots in the Botanical Gardens, Singapore, also specimens in Raffles Museum.\n\nGallicrex cristata (Lath.). The Crested Water-cock.\n\nThis Water-fowl is very plentiful, breeding among the jheels and reedy swamps of Western Malaya. Personally I never found a nest, but in P\u00e9rak, during April, have shot males with the red frontal plate, assumed only during the breeding-season, fully developed. The following is from my note-book:\n\n\"Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00e9rak, 31st March, 1877. This evening, in\na very wet paddy-swamp, I shot a bird uncommonly like a Coot (Fulica atra), except that its toes were very long, and without lobe, web, or any other aid to swimming; it flew with a heavy flapping flight close over the tops of the reeds. It was of black plumage, but a good deal marked with a rusty brown; also it had a little white on its shoulders; irides dark brown; length 15 inches; claws long, very curved and sharp; legs yellowish green, as was the beak, which extended up the forehead in the form of a reddish frontal plate; so I take the bird to be a young male in breeding-plumage; in the adult the iris is crimson.\"\n\nAgain, in my notes I find:\n\n\"Singapore, 22nd December, 1877. To-day I got four couple of Snipe in the valley near Cluny, also shot a female specimen of the Water-cock (G. cristata), which Drake flushed out of a thick patch of reeds standing in water nearly two feet deep. Though at different times I have shot dozens of these birds, I never remember finding them anywhere but in very wet places; in P\u00earak they were exceedingly plentiful on all the jheels, but kept to the thick reed-beds. During last spring I shot a great many on the jheels near Saiyong and Kota Lama, and found them very good eating, though in that respect not equal to the little Goose Teal.\n\n\"The great difference in size of the sexes of this bird is very noticeable: the female I shot to-day is 13 inches in length; irides dark brown; legs and beak dull green, the latter reddish at its base; head and the upper parts dark brown; the feathers of the back, also the tertaries, broadly edged with pale brown; chin, throat, supercilia, outer web of first primary, and the shoulder white; underparts pale rufous brown, narrowly barred with dusky brown, particularly on the flanks.\"\n\nThe male is a larger bird, about 16 inches in length, and, when mature, has red irides and its plumage very dark.\n\nIn Singapore I once put up a Water-cock which flew a short distance, then settled on the top of some bushes eight or ten feet above the ground, a most unusual thing for one of these birds to do. It looked most strangely out of place; so I shot it in order to be sure of its identity.\n**ERYTHRA PH\u0152NICURA** (Penn.).\n\nThe White-breasted Water-hen, though by no means rare, is not very often seen, owing to its extreme shyness; it frequents thick covert near water. At Singapore I occasionally saw it in the hedge-rows near the lake in the Botanical Gardens.\n\nDuring November, 1879, I shot several specimens on Pulau Batam; also during 1877 I got many in P\u00earak and L\u00e2rut. One of the Pulau Batam birds was 12 inches in length; beak yellowish green, reddish on the ridge; legs dull green; tarsus $2\\frac{1}{4}$; upper plumage dull bluish black with a slight green tinge; face, throat, and breast pure white; vent and under tail-coverts chestnut. This specimen, being immature, had the irides brown: in the adult they are deep crimson. I once saw one these birds settle on the upper branches of some trees; but they were of no height, about ten or twelve feet at the outside.\n\n**PORZANA CINEREA** (Vieill.). The Small Water-Rail.\n\nI never came across this Rail on the mainland; but on Singapore, in certain localities, notably the Mount Echo valley, they were very plentiful, particularly during September and October; but perhaps being out Snipe-shooting a great deal during those months I noticed them more than at other times, when I did not pass so much time in their resorts.\n\nMy notes are as follows:\n\n\"Singapore, 7th October, 1879. Passed the afternoon Snipe-shooting in the Mount Echo valley, wading through the swampy grass-fields knee-deep in the most horrible filth\u2014the sewage of Singapore, which is carried out from the town in large wooden tubs by the Chinese coolies and emptied over the fields as manure. The smell is most disgusting; but the valley being capital collecting-ground, in spite of the deep wading and unsavoury odours, I frequently pay it a visit.\n\n\"To-day I got some Snipe (*Gallinago stenura*), Bitterns (*Ardetta cinnamomea*), Golden Plover (*Charadrius fulvus*) and smaller Rails (*Porzana cinerea*); these last were very plentiful in the deepest parts of the swamp, and nearly every bush held one. When flushed they flew with a weak flight, with their long legs trailing behind them, for about fifty yards, then dropped and ran\nfor the nearest covert, from which it was not easy to get them up a second time.\n\n\"A female I dissected had the ovaries much developed, stomach very muscular, full of grass-seeds, a fine thread-like weed, and a quantity of sand.\n\n\"Length 7\u00bd inches, tarsus 1\u00bd; irides red, orbits scarlet; legs yellowish green, soles yellow; beak yellowish green, orange at its base; upper parts, the wings, and tail dull brown, with a plumbeous tinge on the head and neck; underparts, also a streak under and over the eyes, white; sides of the neck and breast bluish grey. Another I shot had the irides a reddish brown colour.\"\n\nAt sunset on any fine evening during September dozens of them were to be seen feeding out in the open on the swamps below Mount Echo, scuttling off in all directions directly they were disturbed.\n\n**Hypot\u00e6nidia striata** (Linn.).\n\nThis common Water-Rail is apparently more abundant in the south than in the north of the peninsula, as I did not meet with it in P\u00earak, while in Singapore I found it, at all seasons, the most common of all the Rails. I got specimens every day I went Snipe-shooting, their favourite resorts being very wet swamps covered with low bushes.\n\nA female I shot on Pulau Batam, on 30th September, 1879, was 10 inches in length, tarsus 1\u00be; irides dark brown; beak fleshy red, dusky on culmen and tip; legs dull green. Its stomach contained a quantity of dark-green substance, among which I detected the fragments of insects and the shelly covering of a chrysalis of some sort.\n\nAnother female, shot in Singapore 30 September, 1877, was slightly smaller than the above, in other respects similar. Top of head, the nape, and a streak down each side of the neck chestnut, marked with black on the crown; the wings and upper parts olive-brown, covered with narrow wavy bars of white, edged with black; the chin and throat dull white; a streak below the eye, the sides of the neck, and the breast lead-grey; abdomen, dull brownish grey barred, particularly on the flanks, with white.\nRallina fasciata (Raffles.).\n\nThis handsome Banded Rail is decidedly rare; I never shot one, and saw very few in the Malacca collections. It can easily be identified by its richly banded plumage. It is smaller, also has the olive of the back more rufous than Porzana ceylonica.\n\nLeptoptilus argala (Lath.).\n\nThe well-known Adjutant bird of Anglo-Indians is found along the Malayan coasts, but, I think, not so plentifully as the rather smaller and more darkly plumaged L. javanicus.\n\nIn August, 1877, I saw several Adjutants on the mud at the mouth of the Moar river.\n\nLeptoptilus javanicus (Horsf.). The Malay Adjutant.\n\nMuch more common in the Straits than the last-named species; both, however, there go by the name of \"Adjutant bird.\" I found it plentiful on the mud-flats at the mouths of most of the rivers on the west coast particularly, about the bar at the entrance to the L\u00e2rut river; but I never shot one, as on every occasion my baggage was much too limited to allow room for stowing away so bulky a bird.\n\nIt is easily tamed, and invaluable as a scavenger, particularly in a hot climate, where things do not improve by being kept. When quartered at Tanglin, every time I drove into Singapore I passed a pair of these Adjutants, which lived on the grass-plot at the roadside close to the town. They seemed very contented with their lot, never straying far away from one place, and were usually to be seen either perched on a railing, apparently buried in thought, or else gravely stalking along the edge of a tidal ditch bordering the road, on the look-out for frogs, fish, or pieces of offal that might come drifting down the stream. My dog frequently used to rush and bark at them, when they put themselves into the most absurd attitudes, if very closely assailed bending forwards with their wings upraised, necks extended, and enormous bills wide open, presenting a most grotesque appearance.\n\nThe detachment of my regiment stationed at Penang bought a pair of these Adjutants from a Malay, and kept them on the race-course just outside the Mess. The following account of the birds, their manners and customs, is given me by an officer of the\ndetachment, who watched them daily:\n\n\"In June, 1877, when at Penang, S. S., B\u2014\u2014 purchased, for the sum of three or four dollars, two Adjutant birds of a black and white colour; head and bill of a yellowish colour, as was also the neck; their bills were nearly a foot in length; they possessed but very few feathers on the head and neck\u2014in fact only a few sprouting hairs: their backs and wings were of a greenish black, and their breasts of a dirty white colour. The birds stood about three feet in height.\n\n\"They were never kept in confinement, and from the very first were allowed to roam over a large open expanse of ground, but never seem inclined to stray far, and very seldom even attempted to fly; and when they did it was rather a failure, and consisted of a succession of bounds for about fifty yards, after which they appeared to be quite exhausted.\n\n\"They were curious birds to watch, and always gave one the idea that the surroundings had but little attraction for them, as they would spend more than half the day standing motionless opposite each other, bill to bill, and with both wings outspread, forming a most ludicrous picture; sometimes they would stand like this for an hour or more; but occasionally one of them raised and stretched out one of its legs as if it were stiff; otherwise they would scarcely move a muscle. I do not remember ever hearing either of them utter a sound, though we often listened.\n\n\"They were very coarse feeders, and did not consider much before they fed, either as regards quality or quantity. On one occasion I threw to one of them, as fast as I could, one by one, several small fish about six inches in length; these he gulped down to the number of thirty-two, and even then did not appear satisfied.\n\n\"After they had been with us about a month, one morning one of them looked rather sorry for itself, and basked in the sun with outspread wings for several hours; but later in the day he lay down on the grass with his eyes closed, evidently very sick; by him stood his brother, quite unconcerned, and, as it seemed to us (for we watched him closely), unaware of anything unusual\nbeing the matter. They remained like this till late in the afternoon, when we saw the healthy bird put his head on one side, and, looking inquisitively at his sick comrade, proceed to stir him up with his back, but without making him move; and on going out we found him to be dead. To discover the cause of death a post-mortem was decided on; and B\u2014\u2014 and myself set to work at once, and found in the bird's stomach, which was much inflamed, the legs and claws of a large Fowl, quite undigested, and probably the cause of its decease.\n\n\"The amusing part of the post-mortem was that the surviving bird stood close by to see us cut up his brother, and evidently with much pleasure; for he eagerly watched us slice off great lumps of meat, and was delighted when they were thrown to him, gobbling them up in no time; after a good meal he stalked away, very well satisfied with the afternoon's performance, apparently thinking what a pity it was he had not a brother dying every day.\"\n\n**Ardea sumatrana.** The Malay Purple Heron.\n\nPlentiful in the jheels and paddy-swamps in P\u00earak, particularly during April, when I found them in a great numbers among the reeds of the large jheel near Saiyong; as I waded about I used to see them, with their long necks stretched out and heads raised above the reeds, most intently watching my movements.\n\nThey were rather wary, though when flushed they generally flew but a short distance, and settled on the upper branches of some large trees bordering the jheel; then, under cover of the jungle, they were easily stalked. They reminded me much of *A. purpurea*, the European Purple Heron, except that they were not nearly so richly coloured as that bird. An immature female, which I shot at Kota Lama jheel, P\u00earak, on 5th April, 1877, measured about thirty-six inches in length, bill at front $4\\frac{3}{4}$, tarsus 5; crown of head dull bluish grey; chin and throat white; face and neck rufous brown, the latter spotted longitudinally with dark brown; upper parts dull brown, the feathers edged with rufous brown and slightly glossed with purple and green; tail and wing slate-grey; wing-coverts ashy, with pale rufous edges to the feathers; abdomen yellowish white. It had been feeding\non small fishes.\n\n**Herodias garzetta** (Linn.).\n\nI frequently met with this Egret among the swamps in Singapore, generally in flocks of from fifteen to thirty.\n\nMy notes record:\n\n\"Singapore, 21st October, 1880. To-day, while shooting Snipe in the swamp behind the barracks, I put up a party of twenty white Egrets, and, as they passed overhead, brought down one of them, a fine specimen of *H. garzetta*, in pure with plumage, but of course, at this time of the year, without the crest and the dorsal and pectoral plumes of the breeding-season.\n\n\"In length it is 24 inches, bill at front $3\\frac{1}{2}$, tarsus 4; legs black, blotched with green; toes green; soles yellow.\"\n\n**Buphus coromandus** (Bodd.).\n\nThe Cattle-Egret is very plentiful throughout the Malay Peninsula; the following are some of the many references to it in my note-book:\n\n\"Kuala Kangsa, Perak, 17th February, 1877. Buff-backed Herons are very common here; wherever there are many buffaloes large flocks of them are always to be seen, either walking about among the animals' legs, or else perched on their backs picking out ticks and other vermin. This afternoon, close to Kota Lama, I shot a female specimen: length $19\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, beak at front $2\\frac{1}{4}$, tarsus $3\\frac{1}{2}$; plumage white, with the exception of a faint buff tinge on the head and nape; irides yellow; legs black; beak reddish yellow; in short, the bird was in almost perfect non-breeding plumage, though another, which I shot out of the same flock shows traces of the buff back. Every evening at dusk a large flock of these Egrets fly across the river and roost in a clump of trees exactly opposite our camp.\"\n\n\"Singapore, 4th November, 1880. Leaving Tanglin directly after tiffin, I followed a jungle-path for a mile or two till it brought me out on an open swamp, a branch of the Mount Echo valley. Quietly parting the bushes, I looked out into the open, and found myself quite close to a large flock of Cattle-Egrets, which, unaware of my presence, were stalking about the swamp picking up larvae and aquatic insects. After watching them for several\nminutes, I stepped out from my hiding-place and, as they rose, brought down a couple. The birds were so confused at my suddenly and so unexpectedly appearing almost in their midst, that they flapped about in all directions, not knowing which way to go, and gave me easy shots. One, struck by a single pellet, which grazed the top of its head, seemed to be completely dazed, and, though in other respects untouched, made no attempt to fly away nor even to walk, but stood bolt upright, quite motionless, and stared vacantly at me in a most idiotic manner: I suppose it was suffering from concussion of the brain.\n\n\"Both of the birds I shot were in pure white plumage, except a slight tinge of buff on the head; the beak was orange, at front 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches; orbital skin greenish yellow; irides yellow; legs black tinged with green; soles green; tarsus \\(3\\frac{5}{12}\\) inches. Their stomachs contained large spiders, several grasshoppers, dragon-flies, and small insects.\"\n\n\"Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00earak, 8th April, 1877. To-day I shot in the country round Saiyong, and on the large jheel saw several Herons (Ardea sumatrana); a few Teal, and literally hundreds of Cattle-Egrets; the last are becoming of a ruddy brown colour on the head, neck and breast, a sure sign of the approach of the breeding-season.\"\n\n**Butorides javanicus** (Horsf.).\n\nCommon. I got several in P\u00earak. For many weeks one resorted daily to the river-bank just below our camp at Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, and I often watched it fishing; at length, doubtless thinking itself in a dangerous neighbourhood, it took itself off to other grounds.\n\nI also found this species plentiful among the islands of the Singapore archipelago. In my notes, in a description of a trip to Pulau Mongsa, is the following:\n\n\"23rd September, 1880...........I found Pulau Mongsa to be about half a mile long by less than a hundred yards wide, thickly wooded, but fringed with a broad coral reef, at low tide of considerable width. Near its shores were long rows of fishing-stakes projecting some feet out of the water, on which sat hundreds of small green Herons (Butorides javanicus). On our\napproach they rose in regular flocks; and, so as to be certain what they were, I shot three or four. They flew very close to the surface of the water.\"\n\n**Ardeetta flavicollis** (Lath.). The Black Bittern.\n\nPersonally I never shot this handsome Bittern in the Malay States; but I saw skins in Malacca collections. I killed one or two in the neighbourhood of the Canton river, South China, where I found them in thick reeds and not easily flushed.\n\n**Ardeetta cinnamomea** (Gm.). The Chestnut Bittern.\n\nI found this small Chestnut Bittern plentiful in Singapore, and also on the mainland, and shot many specimens in P\u00earak, Larut, Province Wellesley, and Malacca, generally flushing them in paddy-fields.\n\nA female, which I shot at Singapore on 30th September, 1877, was about 14 inches in length, bill at front $1\\frac{1}{2}$; tarsus $1\\frac{3}{4}$; irides yellow; bill pale greenish yellow, dusky on the ridge; soles pale yellow; upper parts and the tail ruddy chestnut, but much variegated, many of the feathers of the wing-coverts and back being brown with pale yellowish margins; top of head dusky; chin whitish; pectoral gorget of ruddy yellowish-brown feathers with dark brown central streaks; under-surface of the wings ash-grey with a delicate pink tinge.\n\nUndoubtedly this was a young bird, being of such mottled plumage; moreover it was of much smaller dimensions than an adult, at least according to Jerdon's description.\n\nAnother specimen, which I shot during May in the neighbourhood of Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, P\u00earak, was of an almost uniform chestnut colour as regards its upper parts, but brightest on the wings and tail, and becoming brown on the back; the top of the head had a dusky tinge; underparts yellowish white; pectoral gorget boldly marked with longitudinal reddish-brown streaks; under-surface of the wings delicate pink-grey; bill at front 2 inches, in colour, yellow, the ridge dusky; legs greenish yellow; irides bright yellow, orbital region green.\n\n**Ardeetta sinensis** (Gm.).\n\nCertainly not so common as *A. cinnamomea*, still by no means rare in reedy swamps and wet paddy-fields. It is easily distin-\nguished from *A. cinnamomea* by its wing-quills and tail being deep blue-black instead of chestnut.\n\nOne which I shot at Singapore on 12th November, 1880, measured 15 inches in length; tarsus 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\); irides yellow; legs and beak pale yellowish-green, the latter dusky on its ridge; beak front 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches.\n\nAnother, from K\u00f4ta Lama, P\u00earak, 22nd March, 1877, was of similar dimensions; top of head, the wing-quills, and tail black; face and the upper parts cinnamon-red, brightest on the back of the neck; wing-coverts pale yellowish brown; underparts pale yellowish white.\n\n*Goisakius melanolophus* (Raffles). The Tiger Bittern.\n\nI only once met with this magnificent Bittern, getting a single specimen, a female, near Changi, Singapore.\n\nLength about 20 inches, beak at front 2, tarsus 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\); top of head and pointed crest, passing over the nape, bluish-black; tail brownish-black; rest of the plumage chestnut, brightest on the face and sides of neck; the back and wing-coverts freckled with wavy black lines; pectoral plumes creamy brown, dashed with black and chestnut streaks; the abdomen and vent chestnut, richly marked with irregular black and white bars; under tail-coverts white irregularly marked with dark brown; wing-quills bluish-black, the terminal portions chestnut, and the extreme tips whitish.\n\n*Dendrocygna javanica* (Sykes.). The Whistling Teal.\n\nThis bird may be called the Duck of the Malayan Peninsula.\n\nThough a migrant, it is found at certain seasons throughout all the Malay States; and I do not believe its breeding-grounds can be far north of lat. 5\u00b0 N., as the migration from the lower or southern half of the peninsula does not take place until late in June, and a few months later the birds are back again. During the winter months, or, to speak more correctly, during the northeast monsoon, these Ducks collect in large flocks on the jheels and flooded paddy-fields. In P\u00earak I found them particularly partial to small weedy lakes surrounded by thick jungle; and at one of these, near Saiyong, I used to see them literally in hundreds from February to April; but towards the end of the follow-\ning month they got very restless, and by the middle of June most of them had disappeared, probably having gone north to breed.\n\nI think there is little doubt that some few remain to nest near the banks of the P\u00earak river, in the vicinity of Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, as at the end of June, after the main body had left, I occasionally came across stragglers in the ruddy breeding plumage. Moreover, Mr. Hugh Low, H.B.M.'s Resident at P\u00earak, told me that the natives brought into Ku\u00e2la Kangsa young birds but a few weeks old, assuring him that they had been caught in the neighbourhood. This happened in January or February; so I suppose the birds breed from August or September till early in the year\u2014that is, during the rainy season.\n\nOne cannot base conclusions on the habits of semidomesticated individuals; but it is worthy of notice that several of these Whistling Teal which, a few years ago, were turned out with clipped wings on the artificial lake in the Botanical Gardens at Singapore, though, having perfectly recovered their wings, they daily fly about the islands in search of food, still do not migrate, but remain and breed, and during September I saw several young ones swimming about with their parents. There is but little, if any, difference in the plumage of the sexes, and very slight seasonal change, though towards July specimens I shot were certainly more ruddy than earlier in the year.\n\nDuring the heat of the day the Whistling Teal keep principally on the jheels, among thick reeds, and seem particularly fond of the small open pieces of water shut in by high rushes which are found in all large reed-beds. This makes them fairly easy to get at; and on several occasions, by wading quietly through the water, waist deep, the reeds concealing my head and shoulders, I came on them unawares and killed several at a shot\u2014a great addition to one's larder in a country where fresh meat was not to be got every day.\n\nWhen on open water I found them by no means easy to stalk; and even in places where I much doubt if a gun had ever been fired and they were but little disturbed, after one or two afternoon's shooting they became exceedingly wild and difficult to get near. The Malay bird can be easily distinguished from the other\nspecies of *Dendrocygna* by its small size; out of the dozens which I shot at different times I do not think one ever exceeded 17 inches in length.\n\nA male shot at K\u00f4ta Lama, P\u00earak, on 17th February, 1877, was 16 inches in length; irides dark brown, orbits bright yellow; legs and beak bluish-black; head and neck dull brown, the former dark on the crown; chin whitish; underparts ruddy brown, except the vent and under tail-coverts, which were whitish; wings black; lesser coverts and the upper tail-coverts rich chestnut; back dusky black, each feather terminating with a broad band of rusty brown.\n\n*Nettapus coromandelianus* (Gm.). The White-bodied Goose Teal.\n\nThe beautiful, and most appropriately named, little Goose-Teal is exceedingly plentiful among the jheels and swamps of the mainland; but I never met with it on Singapore or any of the islands along the coast. In many respects it is very Anserine, whence its name, having the short high bill, pure white colouring, and hoarse cry of the Goose tribe.\n\nThe Goose Teal is generally found in small parties of from four to ten, often associating with the Whistling Teal; and I have on several occasions got specimens of both species at one shot.\n\nThey seem to prefer open sheets of shallow water to thick cover, but on being disturbed become very shy and retire to quiet creeks or back waters surrounded by jungle. Though I often found them on flooded meadows, I rarely (in fact do not think I ever) saw them actually on dry land. Their legs are so short and set so far back that probably they seldom attempt to walk, but on the water are quite at home swimming and diving exceedingly well, and when slightly wounded are very hard to secure.\n\nI remember once trying, for nearly half an hour to catch a Goose Teal which fell winged into a shallow pool. It stayed under water a marvellous length of time at each dive, and when it did rise to the surface showed only its head, disappearing again the instant I moved; but at length I tired it out and consigned it to the bag. These birds also have the power of sinking their bodies below the water till nothing but their head is visible, hoping thus to escape notice.\nOne evening in P\u00earak, while out bird-hunting, I came upon a small pool completely excluded from the outer world by the most luxuriantly growing jungle. From the overhanging trees long slender creepers hung down in tangled masses to the surface of the water, which was almost covered with aquatic plants. To complete this beautiful piece of jungle-scenery, in the centre of the pool was a Goose Teal, perfectly motionless; for, quietly as I had approached, it had heard me, and, thinking it was unobserved, did not rise, but, all the time intently watching my movements, slowly and noiselessly sank under the water till nothing but its head remained above the surface.\n\nWhen on the wing, the flight of these birds is very rapid. Skimming close over the reeds, they dodge along at use of a great pace, and are far from easy to shoot.\n\nThey breed in holes in trees, laying several white eggs. I was unable to find a nest, but think they breed in the north of the Malay Peninsula, as near Ku\u00e2la Kangsa I noticed that during June they paired, and, leaving the open water, retired to out-of-the-way places in the jungle, often selecting the narrow creeks or inlets from a large jheel.\n\nConcerning the mode in which these birds, Cotton-Teal as they are called in India, carry their young down from their nests to the water, I had the following related to me by an eye-witness, an officer in the Indian Civil Service. He was stationed on the Madras coast; but I forget the exact name of the place. Anyhow, one afternoon, late in June, while out riding he saw a Cotton-Teal leave a tree and fly down to a pool of water which was near; the bird's peculiar flight, slow and steady, so different from their usual rapid mode of progression, attracted his attention; and riding closer, he saw it had something resting on its back which, on its reaching the water, proved to be three or four young Teal.\n\nMy informant then sent his native servant up the tree from which the bird flew; and at about twenty feet from the ground he found the nest, containing several more young birds, which he brought down; and my friend took them home, hoping to rear them in his poultry-yard; but in a short time they sickened and died.\n\nSpecimens shot in P\u00earak during May had their legs black, but much\ntinged with yellowish-green, which is the case, I believe, only during the breeding season. The difference between the plumages of the sexes is very marked, the female being of much duller colours than the male.\n\nThe following specimens I shot in Perak during April, 1877:\n\n**Male.** Length 12\u00bd to 13 inches; irides crimson; legs and feet greenish-yellow tinged with black; webs black; face, neck and whole of the underparts pure glossy white; a deep black ring encircles the neck; top of head dark brown; back and wings beautiful metallic green with a rich purple tinge; primaries barred, and the secondaries tipped with white, thus forming a band across the wing; flanks and tail-coverts vermiculated with grey lines, like a Wigeon\u2019s back; tail greenish brown; vent black.\n\nThe **female** is of the same size as the male, but not nearly so boldly marked; its irides are dark brown; bill yellowish black; the secondaries only are marked with white; face and neck grey; breast barred with narrow black lines; underparts dirty white; top of head dull brown, with a purple gloss.\n\nI dissected both these birds: their stomachs were exceedingly muscular, contained weed and vegetable matter, also a quantity of sand and particles of quartz.\n\n**Sterna bergii** (Licht.).\n\nI shot several of these Terns in the Straits of Johor and off the south coast of Singapore. During September, while steaming to Pulau Mongsa, several flocks passed close to our launch. They flew close to the surface of the sea and in extended order, like a line of skirmishers; all the flocks were making in the same direction; and it was about three in the afternoon: so perhaps they were on their way to some place in which to pass the night.\n\nOne shot near Johor on 13th April was from 17 to 18 inches in length, bill at front 2\u00bc, tarsus 1\u00bd; irides dark brown; bill pale yellowish-green; legs black; upper parts mottled all over with French grey and dusky brown; head and nape black, the feathers of the crown edged with white; forehead, underparts, inner portions of the inner webs of the primaries, and tail-feathers white.\n\nI think this must have been an immature bird; others I shot\nhad the legs green, blotched with black.\n\n**Sterna seena** (Sykes.).\n\nDuring May, 1879, I got one of these Terns alive, it having been caught by a fisherman on the shore near Malacca. It was a female, length 16 to 17 inches, bill at front $2\\frac{1}{2}$, tarsus 1, bill from gape 3; in colour bright yellow; irides dark brown; head and pointed crest over the nape deep blue-black; the cheeks, a band across the upper parts of the back, and all the underparts white, slightly dusky on the breast; upper parts delicate French grey, very silvery on the wings; inner portions of the inner webs of wing-quills white; tail very deeply forked.\n\nI got other specimens near Singapore during September and October.\n\n**Sterna sumatrana** (Raffl.). The Black-naped Tern.\n\nCommon among the islands at the south of the peninsula. A specimen shot in the Johor Strait late in September was a male, length $13\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, beak at front $1\\frac{1}{2}$; irides dark brown; beak and legs black; tail very long and forked, the two outer feathers projecting $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch beyond the others; top of head, also the face, silvery white; a black streak passes from the beak through the eye and enlarges into a board patch on the nape; upper parts, tail, and wings pale French grey; outer web of first primary black; underparts glossy white delicately tinged with a most beautiful rosy hue. Its stomach contained small fishes.\n\n**Sula australis** (?).\n\nIn June, 1877, I saw several Gannets sitting on some drifting tree-trunks a few miles out to sea off the mouth of the P\u00earak river.\n\n**Attagen minor** (Gm.). The Frigate-bird.\n\nOn 23rd September, 1880, I got an immature Frigate-bird on Pulau Nongsa, about ten miles off the south coast of Singapore; I believe it to be the only specimen recorded as having been obtained in the Straits.\n\nWith some friends I was shooting green Pigeons as they came at dusk to roost on the island. Shortly after sunset, while waiting for the Pigeons, we saw a large bird flying towards the shore, and sailing along close over the surface of the sea. As\nit passed near one of our party, he brought it down. Length about 30 inches; beak and gullet pale bluish-white; feet webbed and of a dull fleshy-white; head, neck, and throat white, mottled with umber-brown, becoming dark brown on the breast and back; belly pure white; wings and tail black, tinged with green; wing-coverts brown, the feathers having whitish margins; middle claw pectinated. The bird had a very rank fishy smell.\n\n**Graculus carbo** (Linn.). The Common Cormorant.\n\nOn 29th May, 1877, while returning down stream to Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, after a few days' shooting on the upper reaches of the P\u00e8rak river, I shot what I believed to be a specimen of the Common Cormorant.\n\nIn my notes I have written:\n\n\"Soon after daylight, as we were drifting with the stream past the village of Enggar, loud exclamations from my Malay boatmen drew my attention to two large birds which were walking about side by side on the sandbank in the middle of the river. Steering within shot, I fired from beneath the attap roof covering the canoe and killed one of them, and, wading to the bank, found I had got a fine Cormorant, the first I have seen in this part of the country. It was not quite dead when I reached it, and whilst flapping about on the sand disgorged four or five small fishes. It was a female, length 34 inches, tarsus $2\\frac{1}{4}$, middle toe with claw $3\\frac{1}{2}$; irides pale green; beak at front $2\\frac{1}{2}$, in colour dirty white, black on the ridge; gular pouch bright yellow; head, back of neck, wings, back, and tail rich bronze slightly tinged with green, and having the feathers of the upper part of the back, also the scapulars and the wing-coverts, edged with black; lower back and sides of abdomen uniform dark greenish-bronze colour; face, front of neck, breast, and middle of the abdomen white, much mottled and streaked with brownish-black.\n\n**Plotus melanogaster** (Gm.). The Indian Snake-bird.\n\nI got one of these curious birds, looking like a cross between a Heron and a Cormorant, at Malacca; it was shot in April, out of a party of ten or fifteen, on some pools at Kessang, a marshy district in the neighbourhood of the settlement. The local bird-collectors did not seem to be familiar with it; so probably it is\nrare in that part of the country; but further north, in P\u00e9rak, I met with it on several occasions, though I never saw more than two or three together. Its chief characteristics are the long snake-like neck and the beautifully marked black and silver scapulars.\n\nH. R. KELHAM,\nCapt., 74th Highlanders.\nGUTTA-PRODUCING TREES.\n\n[The following interesting paper upon the trees which produce the \"Gutta-percha\"* of commerce has been placed at the disposal of the Society by the courtesy of Sir Frederick A. Weld, to whom it has been submitted by Sir Hugh Low, Resident of Perak.]\n\nSir Hugh Low, Resident of Perak to the Hon'ble the Acting Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements, dated The Residency, Thaipeng, Larut, 12th October, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Governor, a Report on the trees producing the \"gutta percha\" of commerce, by Mr. L. Wray, Junr., Curator of the nascent institution which, it is hoped, may develop into a useful collection of the natural products of this State as the Perak Museum.\n\n2. The collections, when at the commencement of the current year His Excellency appointed Mr. Wray, were in a very embryonic state, and being aware of the careful habits of observation he had acquired as an amateur of considerable attainments in electrical and chemical science, and of his zealous pursuit of scientific knowledge in other directions, I requested him to devote his attention to collecting information as to the valuable product known as \"gutta percha,\" together with complete series of specimens of the\n\n* [The unknown person who first rendered the Malay word getah (sap, gum, bird-lime) by the Latin word gutta, deserves credit for some ingenuity. The accidental resemblance of the two words, and the adoption of the latter by botanists, may however be misleading as to the true derivation of the term \"gutta percha.\" Getah, in Malay, is the generic term for any kind of sticky sap which exudes from trees, plants, leaves or fruit; perchah means a rag, bit or strip of any stuff. Getah perchah would thus mean getah in strips or pieces (after being boiled), as opposed to the semi-liquid and sticky condition of the raw substance.\u2014Ed.]\nproduct, and the trees which produced it, such as might enable the eminent men of science at the Head of the Royal Institutions of Kew, Ceylon and Calcutta to botanically identify them.\n\n3. Mr. Wray has zealously and successfully carried out the instructions he received, and complete specimens of several species have been made available, and their receipt cordially acknowledged, and others are in course of preparation.\n\n4. In addition to this, Mr. Wray's scientific training has enabled him to discover that, by the wasteful means of collecting, which alone have been hitherto practised, by far the greater part of the valuable product for which the tree is destroyed remains in the bark which is left to rot in the jungle, so that not more than the merest fraction is made available for the demands of commerce.\n\n5. The process necessary for extracting the whole of the gutta, Mr. Wray describes as simple maceration of the fresh bark shred into thin slices, or of the bark dried and pounded, a process so productive of valuable results that he considers the quantity exported from the Straits Settlements might have been gathered from one-thirtieth of the number of trees which, it is estimated, must have been destroyed to produce it.\n\n6. In P\u00earak, the larger trees had been destroyed before my attention was attracted to the manner in which it was collected. The quantity exported was rapidly diminishing, when, in 1880, I advised the Government, as the only means of preventing the annihilation of the species, the young trees of which were being rapidly cut down, to forbid the export altogether.\n\n7. Old trees had become so scarce that we had great difficulty in securing flowering and fruiting specimens, and I have, as noticed in the diary of my late expedition to the upper waters of the P\u00earak River, ascertained that the central parts of the Peninsula cannot, in all cases, as has been supposed, be trusted to produce an inexhaustible supply. On the light sandy soils which prevail there, none of the \"g\u00e9tah taban\" trees are seen, and the natives assured me that although the kinds of India Rubber called \"g\u00e9tah rambong\" (Ficus elastica) and the \"g\u00e9tah s\u00ebngg\u00e2rip\" (Willoughbeia) had been common, the Dichopsis or Isonandra and the Payena, which is nearly of equal value, were quite unknown. These were, how-\never, very common on the ranges of mountains near to the Straits of Malacca and on the lands bordering the sea-coasts, where the climate is much more moist and the soil is a stiff clayey loam resting upon granite, while the lighter soils of Upper P\u00e9trak are on slates, schists and other metamorphic rocks.\n\n8. As the more economical mode of dealing with the product of the \"gutta\" trees brought to notice by Mr. Wray\u2014collecting the bark instead of the gum\u2014will be of great importance to such States as still have a supply, I would recommend that Mr. Wray's Report be published in the Straits Settlements Government Gazette or in the Straits Branch of the Asiatic Society's Journal, so that, what there seems no reason to doubt, is a valuable economic discovery, which it is quite likely may be equally applicable to other gums or India Rubber-bearing trees, may be made known as widely as possible. It might even, with advantage to the commerce of the Straits Settlements, be translated into Malay.\n\nHUGH LOW,\nResident, P\u00e9trak.\n\nMr. L. Wray, Jr., to Sir Hugh Low, Resident of P\u00e9trak, dated the 25th September, 1883.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to inform you, that in pursuance of the request you made some months ago, I turned my attention to the study of those trees from which the Gutta Percha of commerce is procured; and I now beg to present to you my Report, embodying the result of those studies up to the present time; and solicit your special attention to that portion which relates to my discovery of the large quantity of Gutta Percha that may be extracted from the bark, which is now entirely wasted.\n\nI have sent botanical specimens, and, in most cases, samples of gutta and wood, of nearly all the trees I have mentioned, to the Royal Gardens at Kew, and also to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Ceylon; so that when the eminent botanists at those establishments have examined and compared the several specimens, the mystery in which their botani-\ncal identification has been hitherto so completely enshrouded will, I venture to hope, be satisfactorily solved.\n\n*G\u00e9lah Taban Merah.* *(Dichopsis Gutta,* or *Isonandra Gutta).*  \n\nThis tree, from which the best kind of Gutta Percha is obtained, grows, or rather used to grow, throughout the jungles of the plains of P\u00e9ra and a short way up the sides of the hills.\n\nIt seems to like a considerable amount of moisture, and will even grow with its roots in a running stream. It is a tree of large size, attaining a diameter of 4 to 5 feet, and a height of between 100 and 200 feet.\n\nIt has large thin buttresses around its base, which often present, on their upper portions, a convex profile, and, on a large tree, attain a height of 6 to 8 feet, and a span at the base of 4 to 5 feet from the trunk. As far as I have yet seen, they never form an arch, but have their lower parts buried in the earth, from the trunk to their extremities.\n\nWhen growing in the forest, the tree has a clean, straight appearance, the former being due apparently to the bark peeling off in irregular pieces. The bark is of a rich brown-red colour, and from one-third to half an inch in thickness.\n\nInside the epidermis it is of an Indian-red tint; and when cut, the milk white sap oozes out, at first in small beads, which, enlarging, soon join and covers the injured part with a coating of a cream-like consistency. The leaves are lanceolate on a young tree, and roundish oval with abruptly acuminate points on a tree of mature growth. The margin is entire, and they are covered on their undersurface, with minute silky warm-brown hairs. The leaf stalks and young wood are also covered in a similar manner, which gives the whole tree, when looked at from below, a brownish tint, by which the tree may generally be recognised. The upper surface of the leaf is dark green, and the veins are not prominent.\n\nThe calyx consists of six sepals, three of which are superior to the others, and alternate with them.\n\nThey are coated, like the backs of the leaves, with silky-brown hairs. The corolla is white, and is divided into six petals. The style, which is simple, is sometimes persistent, and may be seen on\nthe ripe fruit. There are six ovules, but one or two seeds only arrive at maturity.\n\nOn the apex of the young fruit, the six carpels of which it is formed can be distinctly traced. The fruit is coated, like the backs of the leaves, with brown down; its flesh is soft, and it is sweet, but it has a disagreeable flavour of gutta percha.\n\nThe seeds are very oily, and they are, together with some of the seeds of nearly allied species, collected by the Malays and the Sakais, who dry them in the sun for some days, and then express the oil by putting them between two flat pieces of wood, and applying pressure by clamps and wedges.\n\nThe oil, which is solid at the ordinary temperature (that is up to $90^\\circ$), is highly esteemed for cooking purposes. Birds, squirrels, monkeys, &c., are very fond of the fruit and of the seeds, which adds to the difficulty of obtaining them.\n\nIt flowers in the month of March, and ripens its fruit in June; but the Malays assert that it only fruits once in three or four years.\n\nThe gutta of this variety is red, and the colour is not due to an admixture of bark, as is frequently stated. It is probable that other varieties of gutta may be sometimes mixed with bark to make them look like Taban Merah, and so command a higher price than they otherwise would; but the true G\u00e9tah Taban Merah is red per se, and the water in which it is cleaned, although changed many times, still becomes deeply dyed with that colour. Specimens of this, in fruit, together with wood, bark, and gutta, I sent to the Royal Gardens at Kew, Calcutta, and Ceylon, on May 30th, 1883.\n\nMethod of collecting the G\u00e9tah Taban Merah.\n\nA tree having been found, a staging of saplings, tied together with roots or rattans, is erected round it, so that it can be cut above the spreading buttresses. The tree is then felled with a little Malay axe called a \"belong,\" and as it lies on the ground, V shaped rings, about one inch broad, are cut in the bark, at intervals of 15 to 18 inches, all along the whole length of the trunk, and of the large branches, with a heavy chopping knife, called a \"parang.\" These cuts soon become filled with the white cream-like sap, and\nin about half an hour, the gutta will have separated from the aqueous portion of the sap, and may then be removed, by rolling a small ball of it round in the cuts, to the edge of which the coagulated gum adheres, and forms a disc, varying in size, according to the number of scores it is rolled in.\n\nThese discs are then boiled in water, and made into balls, and sold by the collectors to the men who export it to Penang or Singapore.\n\nThe gutta is, at first, pure white, but soon changes to pink, and finally to a brownish-red. The water in which the gum is boiled becomes a dark red-brown, and this colouration is the most distinctive feature that this variety of gutta possesses, and by which it may be easily recognised.\n\nThe air seems to have on the sap an effect analogous to that of rennet on milk, coagulating the gummy portions so rapidly, that only a small quantity of their watery stuff runs out of the cuts, all the gutta percha remaining as a soft spongy mass in the scores.\n\nThe amount of gutta obtained from a single tree, appears to have been greatly over-estimated in the accounts that have been written on the subject; and exceptionally large yields from gigantic trees have been erroneously quoted as being an average product, which is clearly by no means the case.\n\nI had a tree felled, that was two feet in diameter (at six feet from the ground) and about one hundred feet high, the age of which I estimated, from its annular rings, to be over one hundred years. It gave only 2lb 5oz. of fairly clean gutta, valued by a Malay dealer at \u00a31.20 per catty, or 3s. 3d. per pound, so that the product of this tree was worth only 7s. 6d.\n\nSome say, that if gutta trees are felled in the height of the rains and when the sap is rising strongly, they then yield more gutta than at other times; but I have had no means of testing the truth of this assertion.\n\n*Getah Taban Sutra.* Dichopsis \u2014\u2014\n\nThis tree is usually confused by the Malays with the preceding one, but is very different to it in many respects. It grows on low\n\n*Sutra=silk.*\nhills, and, the Malays say, will only thrive in sight of water; and those I have seen certainly bear out this idea, for they were all near the bank of some stream, and at an elevation of about 500 to 600 feet above sea level.\n\nIt has much the same appearance as the *D. Gutta*, but the leaves are smaller, and their backs have a yellower shade of brown, and the buttresses are much smaller, and have a concave outline. The bark, which is dark brown, is smooth, and shews, by small oval indentations, the places where the branches have been, when the tree was young. This is a feature I have not noticed in any other gutta, and may, I think, be taken as characteristic.\n\nThe flowers have a reddish tinge, and the fruit is coated like the backs of the leaves, and is oval in form, and about the size of a mussel plum.\n\nIts gutta is pale reddish-brown (like *Getah Sundik*) and the water in which it is boiled does not acquire a red colour. It coagulates nearly as quickly as *Taban Merah*, and is collected in the same way.\n\nThe specimens I collected were obtained from the Ulu Kenering, Perak. The tree was 12 inches in diameter at 3 feet from the ground and was in fruit when felled on the 17th August, 1883. The flower was obtained by a Malay about 10 weeks previously.\n\n*Getah Taban Puteh* (White). *Dichopsis Polyantha*?\n\nThis tree cannot be told, by its outward appearance, from *Dichopsis Gutta*, except that its leaves are rather larger.\n\nIt has large buttresses, with convex tops, and the bark is nearly of the same shade, but rather browner. The fruit also seems to be similar, and the flowers are white; so that it is not until the tree is felled, that any very distinctive character appears. It is then found that the sap, which is much more copious, does not coagulate quickly, and when it does, it is of a dirty white colour, and has a much higher softening point than any of the other kinds, even boiling water not being sufficiently hot to thoroughly soften it. This tree grows on the hills, up to an elevation of 2,500 feet above sea level.\nI have never seen it growing on the plains, nor in fact lower than 1,000 feet.\n\nIt ripens its fruit in the month of February.\n\nThe gutta is collected by felling the tree, ringing the bark, and placing leaves, bamboos, &c., under it to catch the sap; which is afterwards boiled, and the natives often add salt to hasten its coagulation.\n\nIt is frequently adulterated with the gutta from Kayu Jelutong, and two or three of the Bassias.\n\nThe usual method of mixing them is to do so before the sap has coagulated, as afterwards, owing to the high melting point of Taban Puteh, they cannot be so easily and intimately combined. A tree of ten inches in diameter, at four to five feet from the ground, gave 2 lb 11 oz. of fairly clean Gutta Percha.\n\nGetah Taban Puteh (Variety).\n\nThis variety differs from the above, in having smaller leaves, and in the shape of the fruit, which is longer in proportion to its breadth.\n\nI have found it growing on the hills at 2,300 feet elevation; and it ripens its fruit in the month of February.\n\nGetah Taban Chayer.* Dichopsis \u2014\u2014\n\nThis tree I have found growing at 600 feet above sea level; and it attains a large size.\n\nThe bark is reddish-brown, and the wood is hard and white, with a dark red centre.\n\nThe backs of the leaves are, when young, of a golden brown, but full grown ones are silvery.\n\nThey have not the points of the leaves that are present in most other varieties of Dichopsis.\n\nThe flower, which appears about the middle of September, is pale green, and very small.\n\nThe corolla has a six-toothed limb, the teeth being nearly triangular in shape, and so thin as to be almost transparent.\n\n* Chayer = liquid.\nThe diameter of the flower is about $\\frac{3}{5}$ of an inch.\n\nIn the throat of the corolla are inserted, by short filaments, twelve anthers. They are placed alternately in the centre of the teeth, and at the junction between two teeth.\n\nThe style is simple, and of such a length that it projects beyond the petals, in an unopened flower bud. It appears to be often persistent.\n\nThe gutta coagulates very slowly, hence the native name \"Chayer,\" which means watery, &c.\n\nThe gutta, which seems to be of good quality, is of a dirty white colour, but may be easily distinguished from Taban Puteh by its lower softening point, and the tree, by its having small concave buttresses.\n\n*G\u00ebtah Taban Simpor.* *Dichopsis Maingayi?*\n\nThis tree may be readily distinguished from the foregoing by its large dark green leaves, and by its prominent veins at the back, which are covered by coarse, silky light-brown hairs, the back of the leaf itself being only sparingly covered by them.\n\nThe bark is about half an inch thick, rough, and of a reddish-brown colour, much covered by a greyish lichen. It has medium-sized buttresses with a concave outline.\n\nOne tree that I measured was three feet three inches in diameter, at six feet from the ground, and from that height the buttresses sloped out until they reached the ground; having a spread of about three feet from the trunk.\n\nThe flower is white, and comes out in the beginning of April, or the end of March; but its fruit I have not yet seen.\n\nI had one tree felled, which, at three feet from the ground, measured seventeen inches in diameter, and sixty-three to the first branch. The weight of gutta obtained was 12oz. The sap, by the aid of heat and stirring, coagulated in twenty-three hours after tapping.\n\nThis gutta is sold under the name of *G\u00ebtah Puteh*. The tree grows on hills up to about the same height as *Taban Puteh*.\nG\u0113tah \u2014\u2014. Dichopsis \u2014\u2014.\n\nThis is very much like the foregoing, but the leaves are of a lighter green, and are not so much coated with hairs; the bark is smooth.\n\nI have not yet seen the flowers, but the fruit is green, smooth, devoid of hairs, and ripens in August. I found it growing near the Taban Sutra.\n\nIts gutta is slow in coagulating and softens at a lower temperature than the last named variety; and it becomes rather sticky when heated, and remains so for some time after it has cooled.\n\nG\u0113tah \u2014\u2014. Dichopsis \u2014\u2014.\n\nThis tree has large, glossy, dark-green leaves, the backs of which are coated with rich warm chocolate-brown hairs, more densely on the veins than elsewhere, and the midrib is coated, in a similar manner, on the top surface of the leaf, for about two-thirds of its length.\n\nThe bark is very rugged and greyish-brown in colour, containing so little gutta that it is not worth collecting. I have found it growing on hills, about 800 feet high; but, as yet have not been able to procure flowers, or fruit.\n\nG\u0113tah Taban \u2014\u2014. Dichopsis \u2014\u2014.\n\nTrees of this variety are said to be growing on the G\u00fbnong Miru range, near Ku\u00e2la Kangsa, to have small leaves, and to yield gutta of good quality; but I have not yet fallen in with it, nor have I had an opportunity as yet of collecting any specimens of it.\n\nG\u0113tah Sundik. Payena Leerii.\n\nThis variety grows in swampy places near the coast, and I found one tree with its roots in a small creek, the water of which was quite salt, and only a short distance from the regular Mangrove\ntrees fringing the stream. The leaves are small, shiny, and have a reddish tint when young. The bark is about three-eighths of an inch thick, and dark brown in colour, moderately rough.\n\nThe flowers are white, and the fruit is sweet, and eaten by the Malays. Its gutta is like Taban Sutra in appearance, and is collected by scoring the bark, catching the sap, and boiling it, until it coagulates. A tree measuring two feet and eight inches in circumference, at three feet from the ground, and $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet to the first branch, that I had felled, gave $6\\frac{1}{2}$ oz. of gutta.\n\n*G\u0113tah Sundik. Payena \u2014\u2014.*\n\nThis is a tree much resembling *Payena Leerii*, but differing from it in the leaves being longer in proportion to their breadth, the fruit and seed smaller, and the bark, which is reddish-brown, is only about one-half the thickness, and consequently the yield of gutta is much less (the yield seeming to be in proportion to the thickness of the bark). This variety, therefore, is less valuable commercially than the thick-barked kinds. I may observe that it grows in swamps, like the *Leerii*.\n\n*G\u0113tah Gahru? Bassia \u2014\u2014.*\n\nThis is one of the Bassias, nearly allied to *B. Motleyana*; and it grows on the hills up to an elevation of 2,600 feet. The bark is light grey, and the wood seems to be of good quality.\n\nThe leaves are dark green, and the flowers white.\n\nThe fruit is reddish-brown, and covered with silky hairs, like that of *Dichopsis Gutta*.\n\nThe style is often persistent. Its gutta is white and hard, and is used only for mixing with better classes of gutta.\n\nThere are several other Bassias which yield gums that are used for mixing also; but I have not as yet obtained any botanical specimens of them.\n\n*Kayu Jelutong. Dyera \u2014\u2014.*\n\nThe gum from this tree, is known as *G\u0113tah Jelutong*, and is employed in the same way as that from the various kinds of Bassia.\nThe word \"Kayan,\" means wood, but it is at times used by Malays instead of \"Pokok\" a tree, where they consider that it sounds better.\n\nThis tree is one of the loftiest to be found in the jungle; and has blackish-grey bark (white inside) which yields great quantities of white sap when cut into. It bears large bean-like pods, in pairs.\n\nIts leaves are green above, and bluish-white beneath, and arranged in whorls at intervals, with seven leaves in each. The wood is white and very soft, and is largely used by the Chinese for making coffins, for which purpose it is well adapted, as it is light, and decays very rapidly when exposed to moisture.\n\nOn the Great Loss of Gutta, Resulting from the Wasteful Mode of Extraction Employed by the Malays.\n\nWhilst engaged in collecting specimens and information respecting the gutta-producing trees of Perak, I was greatly struck by the exceedingly small amount yielded by even large trees, by the present Malay method of ringing the bark; which led me to an examination of the dried bark, with a view to ascertain, by a series of careful experiments, what proportion of the whole amount of gutta contained in a tree was actually left in the bark after the usual process of extracting it had been performed.\n\nWith this object, I had, on the 24th of May, 1883, a tree of Getah Taban Simpor felled, and scores cut in the bark, at distances of fifteen inches along the whole length of the trunk; and obtained 12 oz. of gutta. Some two or three days after, I had some of the bark removed, and on the 29th, I cut some of it up into thin slices, across the grain, and boiled them in water for a short time when I found that gutta had been expelled, and remained as a slight and irregular coating on the chips. This I picked off, and weighing it, I found the yield to be $3\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the weight of the wet bark operated on.\n\nEncouraged by this simple and satisfactory experiment, I next had a weighed sample of bark pounded in a mortar, and then transferred it to a glass vessel, and boiled it in water.\n\nIn a few minutes, the gutta formed itself into small detached\nwhite flakes, and by stirring, collected into a mass, which was easily removed from the flask, and purified by reboiling in clean water. By this method, the sample of wet bark yielded 5.3 per cent. of clean white gutta.\n\nAnother weighed sample of bark, was cut up and dried in the sun, and then put into chloroform, and after standing some hours, with frequent shakings, the liquid was poured off, and allowed to evaporate; fresh chloroform being added to the bark to extract any gutta which remained in it. The total product thus obtained was 5.7 per cent. of the weight of wet bark used in the experiment.\n\nI next took a weighed sample of wet bark and cut it up into small chips, and dried it thoroughly, and found as the result of several experiments, that it lost 50 per cent. of its weight in the process.\n\nThe following deductions may be made from these results:\u2014Firstly, that the wet bark, which is now allowed to rot in the jungle, contains fully 5.7 per cent. of its weight of Gutta Percha, or when dried 11.4 per cent.; and secondly, that by simply pounding or rasping, and boiling the bark, nearly all the gutta which it contains may be extracted.\n\nAfter the tree was felled, I made careful measurements of it, and weighed portions of the bark, so that I could calculate the total weight on the trunk of the tree, up to the first branch, which I found to be 530lbs. when in the wet state.\n\nNow if we take 5.3 per cent of this, as being the amount of gutta, that may be extracted by the process of pounding and boiling, already specified, we find that it would yield 28lb. over and above the 12oz. which were obtained by the ordinary Malay method; or, to put it in another way, that for every pound of gutta collected at present, 37lb. are wasted!\n\nIn the Kew Report for 1881, I find it stated, that in the year 1875, the export of gutta from the Straits Settlements and Peninsula, was estimated at ten millions of pounds weight.\n\nI have no means of ascertaining the accuracy of that estimate, but accepting it as being tolerably correct, we must, from my experiments, come to the conclusion, that even if we take the amount of gutta wasted, at only thirty times the weight of that collected,\nthere were, during that one year, no less than three hundred millions of pounds, or putting the price at only 2s. 6d. per pound, \u00a337,500,000 sterling worth of Gutta Percha thrown away, and utterly lost!\n\nTo fully realize the importance of this subject it must be borne in mind, that this vast destruction of these valuable trees (which are of such very slow growth) and of this material, on which the communication of the world may be said in a measure to depend, is going on every year, without any cessation whatever.\n\nIt will be noticed, that I have left out of my calculations, all the bark on the upper part of the trunk, and on the branches, which however is just as rich in gutta, as the lower portion of the trunk: even the leaves contain a notable proportion. I have tested, also, other varieties of these trees, and have obtained almost identical results, therefore I need not enter into further details.\n\nThe question naturally arises, can the bark be broken from the trees, and dealt with in the country, or can it be dried and sent to Europe, to be ground up and treated in the manner I have described, or in some other way sufficiently economical, as to be commercially successful? This question deserves the most anxious attention, especially of those who are engaged in the working up of this material; for if it can be successfully accomplished, then the same supply could be furnished, with one-thirtieth of the present annual destruction of trees!\n\nWith the object of having this point so far tested, I have collected some bark, and am sending it to the Royal Gardens at Kew, with a request to have it sent to one of the large manufacturers, so that a report may be obtained from them on the subject.\n\nThe labour involved in stripping the trees, carrying out the wet bark from the jungles (where no roads, or even paths, exist), drying it, carrying it to a port, and thence to England, are items of expense, which must not be overlooked. At the same time, it must also be remembered, that some other jungle products, quite as bulky, and not so valuable, are yet exported with profit.\n\nIf the gutta contained in the bark can be profitably extracted, the planting of those trees on waste lands, might possibly be undertaken by Government, with every prospect of success.\nThe variety that seems to be most easily grown, is *Payena Leerii* (G\u00ebtah Sundik).\n\nThis tree fruits freely, and will thrive on the swampy plains near the coast; and is said by the Malays to grow fast. Its wood is hard, with a close grain, and takes a good polish, therefore may be of some value as timber.\n\nI have tried experiments in making cuttings of some of the Dichopsis, but have not had any success as yet; although it is probable that they may be propagated by this means, when the proper mode of effecting it is found out.\n\nI have not tried *Payena Leerii* as yet, but hope to be able to do so very shortly.\n\nI. WRAY, JUNR.\nOME acquaintance with the black art is essential to every Malay medical practitioner. Simple remedies for wounds and bruises are generally well understood, and some of the more common diseases\u2014such as fever, small-pox, &c.\u2014are often successfully, if not skilfully, treated with native remedies. Bone-setting, too, is a branch of the healing science in which Malays sometimes shew much expertness. But, if the cause of a disease is not apparent, or if such alarming symptoms as insensibility or delirium set in, it is usually presumed that evil spirits are at the bottom of the mischief, and sorcery, not medicine, has to be resorted to. Arabic works on medicine have been translated into Malay, and there may be read learned disquisitions on the parts and functions of the human body, which, in point of scientific accuracy, are of the age of Galen and Aristotle. Demonic possession, though it has always been a popular theory among the Arabs (in common with other Semitic nations) for explaining various forms of disease, is not an idea which the Malays have imported from the West. Their beliefs regarding the distribution, powers and manner of propitiation of the evil spirits, to whom they often ascribe human disease and suffering, are relics of the days when spirit-worship was the religion of their primitive ancestors. The early rites of the aboriginal inhabitants of Sumatra and the Peninsula must have been modified at some period by Hindu settlers from India, for traces of Brahminical worship are traceable in the rude chants and invocations sung by Malay pawangs, to this day, by Muhammadan sick-beds. Where Muhammadanism is strongest, namely in the sea-ports and European settlements (whence a constant communication with Mecca is kept up), Malay ideas on the influence of devils on disease partake more of the Semitic type. The evil spirits are sheitan or jin, and pious Arabic sentences are used as charms and invocations. But in remoter districts, downright heathenism may be met with. The\ndemons to the terrified villagers of many an inland kampong have a distinct personality. They must be met by the employment of other demons to counteract their influence, or they must be propitiated by bloody sacrifices.\n\nIn the State of Perak, it is usual to ascribe nearly every disease to supernatural agency. Medicine is often dispensed with altogether, and all hope of recovery is made to rest on the result of the incantations of professional pawangs. According to the belief of the people (professed Mohamedans for generations and generations!) the mountains and rivers of their country, the ground on which they tread, the air which they breathe, and the forests in which they seek for rattans, gutta, gums and other produce, abound with spirits of various kinds and of varying powers and dispositions. The malicious bajang is the most dreaded, for he is a goblin of inveterate hostility to mankind. Searcely less formidable is the langsuyar, a kind of \"white lady\" or \"Banshee,\" who may be heard sometimes amid the darkness of a tropical night moaning among the branches of the trees or soothing the child which she carries in her unsubstantial arms. The hunter spirit (hantu pembaru), who with his wife and child sometimes rushes past the peasant's huts at night in a whirlwind, pursuing with his four ghostly dogs an unseen quarry, is a potent source of evil, and there are many others too numerous to mention.\n\nWhen the malice of some one of these many demons has caused sickness in a Malay family in Perak, help is summoned in the shape of a pawang, or medicine-man, who has a catalogue of spells at his command and is known for his familiarity with evil-spirits. The diagnosis may be effected in two ways. Either the pawang becomes entranced and sees (tilik) in his disembodied form secrets concealed from ordinary mortals and is able on recovering sensibility to declare the nature and cause of the disease, or else he calls down (menurunkan) some familiar demon (whom he has probably inherited from his guru or preceptor), and, becoming possessed by him, speaks, at his prompting, words of wisdom or folly as the case may be.\n\nSome years ago I was a witness at a kampong, or village, in Perak\nof the ceremonies performed in a Malay household for the recovery of a member of it who was lying dangerously ill.\n\nThe patient was a young married woman, little more than a child in years, whose first baby was only a few days old. The symptoms, which declared to the Malays so plainly the agency of evil-spirits, were probably paroxysms of puerperal fever and these had left the patient so weak that when I saw her she was lying in an insensible state.\n\nThe scene was the centre portion of a large Malay house feebly lighted with two or three oil lamps on the floor. The sick girl lay on a bed in a recess formed by curtaining off a space on three sides the fourth being open. Opposite to the patient, facing her left side as she lay on her back, sat the pawang, Che Johan by name, a big muscular Malay, grasping a large bunch of leaves in each hand. Between him and the bed were the lamps above mentioned. On the other two sides of a square, of which the lamps were the centre, were ranged the people of the house, neighbours, visitors and strangers according to their respective ranks. I occupied the place of honour, being nearest to the head of the curtained recess and having it on my right hand. All the men present, myself included, sat cross-legged on the floor. Round the couch were eight or ten women watching every movement of the sufferer and prepared to restrain her if she became violent in her delirium. The whole building was crowded with people, figures being discernible wherever the flickering light of the lamps happened to shed a transient gleam. Polite salutations were exchanged and a few expressions of condolence and sympathy addressed to the relations. The latter described the manner of the diabolical seizure and the behaviour of the sufferer when possessed. It was agreed on all hands that the poor girl lying insensible before us was the victim of demoniacal possession, and that her only chance of recovery lay in the exorcism of the devil who was in her.\n\nPresently the sound of a small drum called attention to the proceedings of the pawang.\n\nThe drum was beaten by a wild-looking m\u0153nad, who at the same time commenced a shrill chant addressed to the hantu blian, or\ntiger-spirits, to which class of demons Che Johan's familiar belongs. The air was not unpleasing, the words were difficult to catch, but the lines flowed in an easy rhythm and the metre was very regular. A performer of this kind is essential to every pawang, and, as in the present instance, is very often his own wife. She is commonly called bidu, or (in cases of royal s\u00e9ances) biduan.* In the invocation of the tiger-spirits, however, a peculiar nomenclature is adopted for everything, the bidu becomes pengindin, and the drum which she beats (which has only one end of the cylinder covered) is called katubong.\n\nThe pawang, naked from the waist upwards, had bound about him a couple of cords which crossed the back and breast, being brought over one shoulder and under the other arm respectively. He also wore strings round his wrists.\n\nThese cords are supposed to protect the pawang, or medium, from the malevolence of the evil spirits by whom he may be possessed. The same idea is found in Ceylon. According to the Mahawangso, Vishnu in order to protect Wijayo and his followers from the sorceries of the Yakhos, met them on their landing in Ceylon and tied threads on their arms.\u2020 Among the people of Laos, too, the same virtue is ascribed to ligatures of thread over which a charm has been pronounced. \"Le grand rem\u00e8de universel, c'est de l'eau 'lustrale qu'on fait boire au malade, apr\u00e8s lui avoir attach\u00e9 des fils 'de coton b\u00e9nits, aux bras et aux jambes pour emp\u00eacher l'influence 'des genies malfaisants.\"\u2021\n\nAs the pengindin screamed out her chant, the pawang seemed to become subject to some unseen influence and to lose control over himself. Sitting rigid at first, holding in each hand a huge bunch of leaves (daun changlun), he presently began to nod like a man overpowered with sleep, then he sniffed at the leaves, waved them over his head, and struck one bunch against the other. Finally, he fell forward burying his face in the leaves and sniffing in imita-\n\n* Sansk. vidhav\u0101, a widow; Lat. vidua.\n\u2020 Tennent's \"Ceylon,\" I, 340, n.\n\u2021 Pallegoix\u2014\"Description de Siam,\" I, 43.\ntion of a wild animal. He was now on all fours, and became as violent as the necessity of keeping to the circumscribed limits of his mat would permit. He growled and roared and worried invisible objects on the mat. Presently he sat up again, striking his chest and shoulders with the bunches of leaves, and soon afterwards the music stopped. We had now before us, not Che Johan, but simply his body possessed for the time being by the tiger-demon\u2014bujang gelap or the dark dragon. Henceforth, as long as the s\u00e9ance lasted, he spoke in a feigned voice, pronouncing Malay words with the peculiar intonation of the Sakai aborigines and introducing frequently Sakai words and phrases unintelligible to most of the Malays present. Every one who spoke to him addressed him as \"Bujang Gelap.\" The master of the house was the first to do so. Pointing to the insensible form of the poor girl on the couch beside him, he explained that she was grievously attacked by some power of evil, and asked \"Bujang Gelap\" to put forth his supernatural power to expel the demon that was afflicting her. The latter asked a few questions, said the case was a difficult one, and then commenced some fresh incantations.\n\nReturning to his mat, which he had temporarily quitted to look at the patient and to converse with the family, he took up a handful of bertih (rice parched in the husk) and scattered it broadcast around him. Then, after much growling and muttering, he rose to his feet and performed a singular dance to the accompaniment of the shrill chant and monotonous tom-tom of the pengindin. Presently he danced forward past the lamps close to the bedside of the insensible girl, and then himself chanted a long incantation commencing \"Hei\u2014\u2014\u2014i\u2014\u2014\u2014i\u2014\u2014\u2014i\u2014\u2014\u2014jin\" (O! spirit) the first word being enormously lengthened out. Then he sprinkled the couch and the patient with bertih (parched rice) and sprinkled her with tepong tawar, a fluid held in a brass bowl and showered about liberally by means of an aspergium composed of a bunch of fresh leaves. Then once more he returned to his mat, and the wild chorus of the pengindin, which had been momentarily stilled during the ceremonies by the bedside, burst out once more. After this the pawang was again seized with the violent symptoms which had attended his first possession by \"Bujang Gelap.\" He\nroared and growled and sniffed about uneasily until it was evident from his movements that he wanted to get under the mat. An accommodating person sitting close by lifted up the mat for him and he crawled under it on all fours and lay down entirely concealed from view. The chorus and the drum went on, and I hardly knew which to admire most\u2014the physical endurance of the woman who sang so persistently at the top of her voice without any symptom of fatigue, or her marvellous memory. The invocations were very long, but she never seemed to hesitate for a word. There must, however, have been a good deal of repetition, I imagine.\n\nAfter a retirement which had lasted for about a quarter of an hour, during which he had kept perfectly still and motionless, the pawang shewed symptoms of returning vitality. The mat was removed, and he resumed his seat upon it, yawned, uttered a few ejaculations in his feigned voice, and then sat up to be questioned. A desultory conversation then ensued, the pengindin acting as interpreter when the Sakai dialect used by \"Bujang G\u00e9lap\" was unintelligible to the audience. The result was declared to be that the tiger-spirit had identified the demon which was causing the suffering of the sick person present. A thrill of horror went round the assemblage when this was announced to be a dumb langsuyar (banshee). The correctness of this finding was then discussed and it seemed to command popular favour, for it was universally remarked that the patient had been insensible for two whole days, during the latter part of which time she had been quite silent. This was now, of course, accounted for by the dumbness of the evil spirit which possessed her.\n\nThe women round the sick-bed now said that the patient was trying to move, and all turned to look at this manifestation of demoniacal power. It was only a momentary access of delirium marked by convulsive movements of one arm, rolling of the eyes and movement of the lips and jaws. No sound escaped from the sufferer, another proof of the correctness of the pawang's diagnosis, and presently she was still again, after many fervent ejaculations of Astaghfir Allah (I beg forgiveness of God) from those present.\n\n\"Bujang G\u00e9lap\" continued his efforts for the cure of the patient\nfor a long time. Again and again he strewed the place with berthi and sprinkled the patient with tepong tawar. Once he charmed eight grains of berthi which were put into her mouth. He chanted long invocations, danced wild dances, and beat himself with his bunches of leaves. But all in vain, the dumb longsuyar still held possession of the sufferer. In the intervals of the ceremonies, the pawang conversed occasionally with members of the family, always retaining his assumed voice and using Sakai phrases. He even condescended to accept a Malay cigarette (roko), which he called by the Sakai word nyut.\n\nAt length he pleaded fatigue, and gave place to an old man who dealt with a different class of demons altogether. The spirits which he professed to be able to influence are the hantu sungkei, or the demons of the Sungkei river, a particular district in Perak.\n\nHis method of procedure differed a good deal from that of the pawang of the hantu blian. Instead of the old woman with a little drum, he had a male bidu with a large round tambourine. A single bunch of pinang leaves replaced in his hands the two large bunches of daun changlun which \"Bujang G\u00e9lap\" had carried. After the preliminary sprinkling of berthi by the new pawang, the bidu commenced to chant an invocation to the Sungkei spirits, addressing them in turn by name. The symptoms of possession on the part of the pawang were convulsive shaking and shivering, especially in the hand and arm which bore the bunch of pinang leaves. Both tune and metre were quite different from those employed in addressing the hantu blian. The old Sungkei pawang proved a failure, for after endless chanting and after he had been possessed successively by \"Panglima Raja,\" \"Anak Janggi,\" \"Hulubalang Raja\" and \"Mambang Dundang,\" all powerful Sungkei spirits, he was unable to declare anything, and left us as wise as we were before.\n\nWhat a common incident in Eastern tales is the dire illness of some lovely princess, for effecting whose recovery an agonised father offers half of his kingdom and the hand of the lady in marriage! There is always some favoured hero who applies some magical remedy and restores the princess to health after the medical profession has been\ncompletely baffled. But think of what the patient has had to undergo at the hands of the unsuccessful competitors, before the right man takes the case in hand! Think of all the doses administered by rival doctors, or prepared by sympathetic friends, each one assured that he is going to cure the disease and win the King's favour! I have been reminded of these things sometimes when I have seen or heard something of the treatment adopted in Malay families in cases of dangerous illness. In the household of a Perak Raja, carte blanche would be given to any one representing himself to have a remedy, on the occasion of a desperate sickness such as that which called for the scenes which I have imperfectly described. Any medicine offered would be gratefully received and administered, and very likely, before it could possibly take effect, some one else's prescription would be poured down the patient's throat on the top of it. It is thought to be a mark of sympathy and solicitude to suggest and prepare remedies, and they are usually accepted and tried in turn, to the imminent danger, I should imagine, of the unfortunate person experimented on. When a child is born in a royal house in Perak, all the old ladies in the country concoct and send to the scene of the interesting event doses called salusuh, which the mother has to swallow with great impartiality. It will be seen from this what an important part unprofessional zeal may play in sick chambers among the Malays. On the occasion I speak of, numbers of friends and relations brought their own specifics, but the state of the patient prevented their use.* I must, however, describe the dedication of a balei berpusing, or \"revolving hall,\" which was arranged and carried out at the instance of one of the relations.\n\n* It is right that I should explain that every effort had been made to persuade the family to adopt civilised remedies, and to give up the proposed resort to the pawangs. There was no English Doctor in Perak then, but the officers at the Residency had a medicine-chest and one or two simple medical works. The head of the family, however, declared that, if the pawangs were not employed and the girl died, her other relations would charge him with not having done all in his power to save her. English medicines would be thankfully received, but they would be administered in their turn with native remedies. The sex of the patient rendered interference in nursing and feeding her impossible. A large proportion of persons who die up-country in Perak are ushered out of the world by the drum and chant of the pawang and bidu.\nIt was after the Sungkei demons had been invoked in vain that propitiatory offerings in a balei berpusing were resorted to.\n\nThe two pawangs already present were asked to give their aid, their mats were spread afresh, their lamps re-trimmed, and their bowls of parched rice replenished by officious attendants. Presently, a couple of men brought in a neat model of a Perak mosque. The house of prayer in an inland Malay village is a very simple affair. It is usually a square building with a door or window on each of the four sides. The main roof of the edifice, instead of terminating in a point, is surmounted by a little square crow\u2019s nest with a peaked roof. This was exactly reproduced in white wood very neatly and artistically finished. At the bottom of the miniature building was a single bamboo support, the end of which being hollow fitted like a socket upon an upright rod fixed on the floor. The one leg of the model being thus fitted on to a stationary upright, the little house could be turned round and round at will, presenting each door in turn to each point of the compass. As soon as it was fixed, a kind of frill or border, made of young coconut leaves with a deep fringe of the same material, was tied round the base of the model so that the ends hung down, entirely concealing the bamboo leg and the simple mechanism by which it worked upon its pivot. This fringe is called jari lipan ore \u201ccentipede\u2019s legs\u201d from some fancied resemblance to the liberal numbers of members with which Nature has gifted that insect. When this had been tied round the miniature mosque and the ends of the fringe had been docked with a pair of scissors by a female slave, so as to admit of the model revolving freely, it was time to fill the interior with the propitiatory sacrifices. This was the task of the nearest relations and of the representatives of the old lady, in accordance with whose vow the balei berpusing was being dedicated.\n\nThe offerings to demons when made in this manner are of four kinds\u2014lemak, manis, masam, pedas (the fat, the sweet, the sour, the pungent). The \u201cfat\u201d consisted of a fowl sacrificed then and there before us. The blood was caught in a leaf and placed in the centre of the miniature building, or balei, as I shall now call it. The feathers were plucked out, the entrails removed, and the\nbody divided into joints. Every part of the bird was then placed reverently inside the balei, including the feathers and entrails. The wings were tied to the streamers of the fringe outside, as were innumerable sweet offerings\u2014wajil, dodul, tebu, pisang (confectionery, pastry, sugar-cane and plantains). I did not ascertain what the sour and the pungent consisted of, but they were no doubt contained in small saucers and other receptacles which I saw being poked through the little doors of the toy house.\n\nWhen all was ready, the drumming, the invocations and the performances of the pawangs began again. Each in turn, after having repeated much of what I have already described, advanced to the couch of the patient and waved the evil spirits away from it into the little balei, which was placed close by. The demons were coaxed, entreated and threatened by turns. Each pawang, armed with a bunch of leaves dipped into a bowl of tepong tawar, guided an indefinite number of the evil ones into the place where the feast had been spread for them. The incantations and waving went on for a long time, and it wanted only an hour or two of dawn when it was concluded that the last of the demons had entered the receptacle. The balei was then lifted up and carried off down to the river (on the bank of which the house stood) escorted by the pawangs, who with more charms and incantations drove the spirits in front of them to the water side. Then the balei berpusing, with its array of delicacies and its freight of wickedness, was set afloat on the river and soon disappeared down the stream in the darkness. The last ceremony was the repetition of a formula as the party returned to the house from the river. One of the men belonging to the family called out to the women in the house \"Semboh betah?\" \"Is there any improvement?\" And a shrill female voice shouted back the prescribed reply \"Ber-lari ber-jalan\" \"Running and walking,\" in allusion either to the state of the patient, implying that she was up and about again, or else to the hasty retreat of the evil-spirits, I am not quite sure which.\n\nNo improvement, however, took place, and though the efforts of the pawangs were redoubled on the following night, and the\nservices of other and more famous medicine-men were retained, the poor little patient never recovered consciousness and died within four and twenty hours after the balei berpusing, which ought to have contained all the powers of evil lately afflicting her, had been cast adrift on the Perak river.\n\nW.

MAXWELL.\nNOTES\nILLUSTRATING THE CHANGES\nWHICH\nCONSONANTS UNDERGO IN PASSING\nFROM ONE\nMALAYAN DIALECT TO ANOTHER.\n\nAs one of the principal objects of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society is to trace the origin of the various dialects of the Malayan Peninsula and Archipelago, I have thought that the following notes, though hastily put together, and with very little material to work upon, may prove interesting and give a clue to those who are more capable of following the tangled thread of Malayan etymology to its source than I am.\n\nI have taken the Malay language as the starting point whenever possible: where three or four examples of a change are given, it must be understood that thirty or forty could as easily have been supplied: but a change exemplified by only one word must be considered doubtful until corroborated, as I hope each one will be, by further contributions from some of the large number of polyglotts whom the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society counts among its members.*\n\nA.

A wider range of observations is also now available in the comparative Tables compiled by the Director of the Batavia Observatory from 166 stations in the Eastern Archipelago, the fourth volume of which (for 1882) has just been received.\n\nThe year 1882-3 has been one of peculiar interest to meteorologists. It was both a \"sun-spot\" year and a \"cholera\" year, the respective 11-year and 17-year periods happening to correspond. Nor have the theorists been disappointed.\n\nIt becomes of interest, therefore, to examine our local Returns with special attention, incomplete though they undoubtedly are for any large generalisations.\n\nIn the first place, what are these theories respecting the periodicity of solar and magnetic phenomena and all that is supposed to be connected with them? The last published volume of the new edition of the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" (vol. XVI of 1883) explains them, on the highest authority, as follows:\u2014\n\"105. Rainfall\u2014Heights of Rivers and Lakes.\u2014In 1872 Meldrum of the Mauritius Observatory brought forward evidence showing that the rainfalls at Mauritius, Adelaide, and Brisbane were, on the whole, greater in years of maximum than in years of minimum sunspots. Shortly afterwards it was shown by Lockyer (Nature, December 12, 1872) that the same law was observable in the rainfalls at the Cape of Good Hope and Madras.\n\n\"Meldrum has since found that the law holds for a great number of stations, including eighteen out of twenty-two European observatories, with an average of thirty years' observations for each. The results are exhibited in the following table:\n\n[Here follows a list of 22 cities with observations for an average of 30 years, shewing in 18 cities excess and in 4 cities defect of rain in the periodical \"sun-spot\" years.]\n\n\"It would, however, appear from the observations of Governor Rawson that the rainfall in Barbados forms an exception to this rule, being greatest about the times of minimum sun-spots.\n\n\"106. Gustav Wex in 1873 showed that the recorded depth of water in the rivers Elbe, Rhine, Oder, Danube and Vistula for the six sun-spot periods from 1800 to 1867 was greater at times of maximum than at times of minimum sun-spot frequency. These conclusions have since been confirmed by Professor Fritz.\u00b9\n\n\"Quite recently Stewart (Proc. Lit. and Phil. Soc. of Manchester, 1882) has treated the evidence given by Fritz as regards the Elbe and Seine in the following manner. He divides each sun period, without regard to its exact length, into twelve portions, and puts together the recorded river heights corresponding in time to similar portions of consecutive sun periods. He finds by this means residual differences from the average representing the same law, whether we take the whole or either half of all the recorded observations, and whether we take the Elbe or the Seine. The\n\n\u00b9 Ingenieur Zeitschrift, 1873.\n\u00b2 Ueber die Beziehungen der Sonnenflecken Periode zu den Magnetischen und Meteorologischen Erscheinungen der Erde, Haarlem, 1878.\nlaw, is that there is a maximum of river height about the time of maximum sun-spots and another subsidiary minimum about the time of minimum sun-spots. There is some reason too to think that the Nile and Thames agree with those rivers in exhibiting a maximum about the time of maximum sun-spots and a subsidiary maximum about the time of minimum sun-spots, only their subsidiary maximum is greater than it is for the Elbe and Seine.\n\n\"107. In 1874 G. M. Dawson came to the conclusion that the levels of the great American lakes were highest about times of maximum sun-spots. In this investigation the value of the evidence derived from rivers and lakes is no doubt greater than that derived from any single rainfall station, inasmuch as in the former case the rainfall of a large district is integrated and irregularities due to local influence thus greatly avoided.\n\n\"108. Dr. Hunter, director-general of statistics in India, has recently shown (Nineteenth Century, November 1877) that the recorded famines have been most frequent at Madras about the years of minimum sun-spots\u2014years likewise associated with a diminished rainfall.\n\n\"109. Winds and Storms.\u2014Meldrum of the Mauritius Observatory found in 1872, as the result of about thirty years' observations, that there are more cyclones in the Indian Ocean during years of maximum than during years of minimum sun-spots.\\(^1\\) The connexion between the two is exhibited in the following table\":\n\nHere follows a comparison of the Cyclones and Sun-spots during the years 1847-73. The maximum number of Cyclones in any one year is 15, the minimum 4, and the steady ups and downs of the periodic fluctuations are very remarkable. The following are the years of maximum and minimum Cyclones:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1847, & \\quad 5 \\text{ Cyclones} \\\\\n1849, & \\quad 10 \\text{ \"} \\\\\n1854, & \\quad 4 \\text{ \"} \\\\\n1859, & \\quad 15 \\text{ \"} \\\\\n1864, & \\quad 5 \\text{ \"} \\\\\n1869-71, & \\quad 11 \\text{ \" per annum.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\(^1\\) Br. Assoc. Reports, 1872.\nThe course of the periodic wave in this table and in the one below exhibiting the Straits rainfall, closely correspond.]\n\n\"In 1873 M. Po\u00eby found a similar connexion between the hurricanes of the West Indies and the years of maximum sun-spots. He enumerated three hundred and fifty-seven hurricanes between 1750 and 1873, and stated that out of twelve maxima, ten agreed.\n\n\"110. In 1877 Mr. Henry Jeula, of Lloyd's, and Dr. Hunter found that the casualties of the registered vessels of the United Kingdom were $17\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. greater during the two years about maximum than during the two years about minimum in the solar cycle.\n\n\"111. Temperature.\u2014Baxendell, in a memoir already quoted, was the first to conclude that the distribution of temperature under different winds, like that of barometric pressure, is sensibly influenced by the changes which take place in solar activity. In 1870 Piazzi Smyth published the results of an important series of observations made from 1837 to 1869 with thermometers sunk in the rock at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. He concluded from these that a heat wave occurs about every eleven years, its maximum being not far from the minimum of the sun-spot cycle. Sir G. B. Airy has obtained similar results from the Greenwich observations. In 1781 E. J. Stone examined the temperature observations recorded during thirty years at the Cape of Good Hope, and came to the conclusion that the same cause which leads to an excess of mean annual temperature at the Cape leads equally to a dissipation of sun-spots. Dr. W. K\u00f6ppen in 1873 discussed at great length the connexion between sun-spots and terrestrial temperature and found that in the tropics the maximum temperature occurs fully a year before the minimum of sun-spots, while in the zones beyond the tropics it occurs two years after the minimum. The regularity and magnitude of the temperature wave are most strongly marked in the tropics.\"\n\nIt has been thought best to give the whole of this well-digested summary, as it presents, under the authoritative initials of \"B. S.,\"\nthe latest information upon the whole question, from an impartial standpoint. The mere reference here made to Dr. Hunter and others is, however, so brief as to suggest but a fractional part of what has already been done to establish as a fact the recurrence of \"the sun-spot and famine period,\" especially in India.\n\nSince the article in the Encyclop\u00e6dia, from which I have quoted, was written, the outbreak of Cholera in Egypt last autumn has drawn special attention to the periodicity of that mysterious disease. An account of its recurrence in this century was published in the Times last July, without any reference to any question of periodicity, but it was impossible to overlook the similarity of the intervals marked by the dates there given:\n\n* 1832, 1849, 1866, 1883.\n\nThe connection between Meteorology and periodical epidemics forces itself into special notice in this Colony, with regard not only to Cholera, but to another mysterious and fatal disease\u2014\"Beri-Beri\"\u2014which is a far greater local scourge.\n\nThe following extracts from recent official reports regarding outbreaks of each disease will sufficiently show the claim which this matter has on our attention:\n\n\"Amount of Rain during Cholera Epidemic.\n\n\"109. From the Return attached (G) it will be seen that the total rainfall for the year was 66.19 inches, about 30 inches below the average, I believe. During the months when the Cholera prevailed the rainfall was as under:\n\n| Month | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| March | 2.57   |\n| April | 4.40   |\n| May   | 2.36   |\n| June  | 3.73   |\n| July  | 2.92   |\n\n* This was the first appearance of Cholera in Europe, but it will be remembered that it was in 1798 [1832 less (17 x 2)] that occurred the historical outbreak in Egypt by which Bonaparte's movements were so hampered.\nso that in those five months the rainfall was rather less than a quarter of that which fell in the year.\"* [Malacca Administration Report, 1882.]\n\nThe facts as regards \"Beri-Beri\" relate to the recent outbreaks in the Singapore Prison, and are shown in an official report as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Amount of Rain and number of Beri-Beri Cases:\u2014\n\n| Numbers | Deaths from Beri-Beri | Rainfall |\n|---------|-----------------------|----------|\n| 1877    | ... 814               | 22       | 61 inches. |\n| 1878    | ... 845               | 65       | 99 \"      |\n| 1879    | ... 777               | 106      | 118 \"     |\n| 1880    | ... 626               | 87       | 102 \"     |\n| 1881    | ... 642               | 35       | 92 \"      |\n| 1882    | ... 806               | 50       | 79 \"      |\n| 1883    | ... 837               | 27       | 66 \"      |\n\nAs regards another local disease, \"Country Fever,\" the following authoritative statement on this subject is to be found in the new Encyclop\u00e6dia's article \"Malaria\":\u2014\n\n\"The epidemic prevalence of intermittent and remittent fever in certain years probably finds its explanation in the meteorology of those years, but no uniform law has been discovered.\"\n\nA subject of more general interest, and one which has already excited some discussion in the Straits, has reference to the effects on rainfall of disafforesting a country. Some say that the loss of our timber has diminished the supply of rain; others deny it, and\n\n---\n\n* The Cholera which visited this Colony at the very commencement of the long drought 1882-3 seems to have followed the course of defective rainfall in the various Settlements with remarkable precision\u2014and as the disease appeared rather before than after the rainfall phenomena of the period had declared themselves, the influence must, it seems, have been less hygrometric than magnetic in its origin. The following are the facts:\u2014\n\nIn Malacca, 65 inches in 1882, ... The epidemic was worst.\n\nIn Singapore, 88 \" \" \" The epidemic was less felt.\n\nIn Prov. Wellesley, 92 \" \" \" There was not a single case.\n\nIn Penang, 126 \" \" \" The average rainfall is much the same in all the Settlements.\npoint to the Rainfall Returns as conclusive. Of this difference of opinion, an example was afforded in the apparently contradictory views published in the Forest Report, 1883, paragraph 25 and Appendix E.\n\nIn 1880, Mr. Wheatley, in his most useful paper on our Rainfall in Journal No. VII, was careful to express no definite opinion; though the necessities of his argument about \"the great influence at work\u2014the monsoons\" required him to attach little weight to any local cause.\n\nThe enquiry into the degree and mode of this \"monsoon\" influence has, since he wrote, been much facilitated by the extension of the Dutch observations in Netherlands India, to which I have referred above. The Director, Dr. Van der Stok has kindly sent me his Records of Rainfall, in which he is now able to give the mean for four years in 166 stations throughout this great region. The following summary of the 20 principal places, named in geographical order, to the North and South of the Equator respectively, has been compiled from these Dutch Returns; and they show how closely the degree of excess or defect of rain in 1882 followed the degree of North or South in the observing station. The fact of excess or defect is, it will be seen, entirely governed (except in the case of three headlands) by the question whether a place lies North or South of the Equator, which is in this matter presumably equivalent to \"monsoon\" influence.\n\nTable of Netherlands India Stations.\n\nComparing the Rainfall in 1882 with the Mean Annual Amount.\n\n(in millimetres.)\n\n[The places in brackets are headlands exceptionally situated, which differ from neighbouring places less exposed. It is noticeable also that while the rest of the Straits followed the law here observed and had deficient rain, Penang, which belongs rather to further India than Malaya, had a marked excess.\n\nThe places in italics lie South of the Equator.]\n| Location       | Average of 4 years | Rainfall 1882 |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| (Acheen)       | 1,769              | 1,806         |\n| Deli           | 2,233              | 1,840         |\n| Rio            | 2,623              | 2,430         |\n| Jambi          | 2,484              | 2,154         |\n| Palembang      | 3,075              | 3,147         |\n| (Anjer)        | 2,101              | 2,034         |\n| Bataria        | 2,012              | 2,460         |\n| Surabaya       | 1,854              | 2,856         |\n| (Banjoewangi)  | 1,485              | 1,416         |\n| Tjilatjap      | 5,054              | 5,490         |\n| Bencoolen      | 3,173              | 3,209         |\n| Padang         | 4,640              | 4,673         |\n| Singkel        | 4,455              | 4,057         |\n\n| Celebes        |                    |               |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Menado 2\u00b0 N.   | 2,647              | 2,880         |\n| Macassar 5\u00b0 S. | 3,562              | 4,203         |\n| Moluccas       |                    |               |\n| Ternate 2\u00b0 N.  | 2,402              | 2,326         |\n| Banda 4\u00b0 S.    | 3,118              | 3,488         |\n| Borneo         |                    |               |\n| Pontianak (on  | 3,090              | 3,096         |\n| the Equator)   |                    |               |\n| Banjermasin 3\u00b0 | 2,519              | 2,609         |\n| S).            |                    |               |\n\nWhether or not \"monsoon\" laws usually have such ruling influence, there can be little doubt that the effect of disafforestation on the annual rainfall, whatever it may be elsewhere, is at a minimum in the Straits. The difference of opinion on this point is, it may be surmised, partly due to some confusion between the mean annual rainfall and the periodical distribution of rain (as recorded in the numbers of days on which rain fell), and to a want of sufficient discrimination in the further matter of distribution, viz., the loss or storage of the rain after falling, which is probably the most important point of all to agriculturists, though one with which meteorology is only indirectly concerned.\n\nThere can be no doubt that temperature, on the other hand, is closely affected, here as elsewhere, by the loss of forest and by the spread of buildings. The existence of Singapore now covers\ntwo generations; the experience of the first generation was summed up by Mr. Crawfurd in 1855 with the following statement (Descriptive Dictionary p. 396):\n\n\u201c(a) January is the wettest and coldest month of the year.\n\n\u201c(b) The average rainfall in \u201ca series of years\u201d is 92.69.\n\n\u201c(c) The mean temperature is 81.24 and the range from the mean of the hottest month to that of the coldest is 2.76 only.\n\n\u201c(d) Comparing this with the temperature that was ascertained in the infancy of the Settlement, it would appear that it has increased (1855) by 2.48, a fact ascribable, no doubt, to the increase of buildings, and to the country having been cleared of forests for several miles inland from town, the site of the observations.\u201d\n\nA similar summary could most usefully be prepared in 1885 for comparison and record.\n\nThe most interesting question of all for our meteorologists is that with which this paper commenced\u2014the question whether we have here recurring periods of drought and rain, due to sun-spots or magnetic influence of some kind. If there is any such period due to solar influence, why, compared with that influence, even the \u201cmonsoon\u201d shrinks into a \u201clocal\u201d cause, and becomes of comparatively little importance. Mr. Wheatley did not like \u201cto hazard, even by guessing, a rule by which the rainfall of Singapore can be calculated upon.\u201d But the Tables he published show that in fact the period of $10\\frac{1}{2}$ to 11 years, and the subsidiary period of about 5 years, are peculiarly well-marked in Singapore. Take his figures in Tables VII and VIII, for example: the total numbers of dry days for the 17 years 1864-80 are given for each month the annual totals being as follows:\n\n| Year | Total |\n|------|-------|\n| 1864 | 19    |\n| 1865 | 12    |\n| 1866 | 18    |\n| 1867 | 23    |\n| 1868 | 13    |\n| 1869 | 9     |\n| 1870 | 15    |\n| 1871 | 7     |\n| 1872 | 13    |\n| 1873 | 11    |\n| 1874 | 9     |\n| 1875 | 10    |\n| 1876 | 11    |\n| 1877 | 11    |\n| 1878 | 9     |\n| 1879 | 7     |\n| 1880 | 8     |\nThe size of the type is intended to make the periodic fluctuation clearer. But the resources of typography do not permit the full regularity of the recurrence to be shown without a diagram, and careful attention is invited to the whole series of figures published in Journal No. VII.\n\nIt will be seen, for example, that the driest years in their respective periods are 1856-7 and 1876-7, and the least dry 1869 and 1879-80.\n\nA comparison of the exceptionally dry months, January-March 1867, (35 dry days) with August-September 1877, (27 dry days) and of the exceptionally wet months, October-December 1869 (8 dry days) with March-May 1880 (9 dry days) marks the period as one of $10\\frac{1}{2}$ years still more precisely.\n\nThe same thing is shown by the Table II of Annual Rainfall there published; the table being brought up to date. the totals for each periodic year are as follows:\n\n| Wet Years | Inches | Dry Years | Inches |\n|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|\n| 1870      | 123.24 | 1872-3    | 91.01  |\n| 1875      | 108.48 | 1877      | 61.19  |\n| 1879-80   | 111.34 | 1882-3    | 73.33  |\n\nThe mean Annual Rainfall may be roughly taken at 100 inches.\n\n[A diagram with a curved line, starting from the end of 1869 for the maximum rain, and from the middle of 1872 for the minimum rain, will be found to move up and down with an almost perfectly regular curve.]\n\nIt is certainly well to wait until we have a larger series of Annual Returns before generalising on such a matter too positively; and this branch of the subject is only touched upon now to invite the attention of all who may keep or study our Meteorological Records. But from the evidence already accumulated, the long drought of 1882-83, which ended last August, was, I maintain, clearly to be anticipated; for it closed the solar period dating from the limited rainfall (160 inches) in 1872-3, and the subsidiary dry period, showing the fall of 148 inches only, in 1876-7.\nAn excess of rain may, in the same way, be looked for in the years 1884-5, and still more in 1885-6: but not so great an excess, these years merely closing the subsidiary period of excess from 1879-80 (228 inches). It was the year 1880 that closed the full periodic term dating from the phenomenal rainfall of the rainy term\u2014August 1869 to December 1870\u2014(173 inches).\n\nBy such calculations as these, predictions about the Rainfall may, I think, be hazarded even now, notwithstanding that we still have insufficient means of deciding the scientific laws that govern the subject.\n\nA. M. SKINNER.\nOCCASIONAL NOTE.\n\nThe Journal Asiatique for January, 1883, laid before the public a short article entitled Quelques Notes de Lexicologie Malaise. Additions au Dictionnaire Malais-Fran\u00e7ais de l'Abb\u00e9 Favre, par M. Marcel Devic. The notes which M. Devic offered as a contribution to a future supplement of Favre's Malay-French Dictionary include a meagre list of thirty words only, and these seem to have been collected during a perusal of the Sajarah Malayu, in the course of which the contributor discovered what seemed to him to be omissions in the dictionary.\n\nM. Devic is known to us by a translation of the Sajarah Malayu, in which, however, the explanatory and critical notes are few and unimportant.\n\nThe dictionary of the Abb\u00e9 Favre found a champion at once in M. Aristide Marre, who, in a paper which occupies twenty pages of Le Mus\u00e9on (No. 2 of 1883), examined critically M. Devic's contribution. Each note is dealt with in turn, and if M. Marre is always right, M. Devic, with whom he seldom or ever agrees, must be almost invariably wrong. But the criticisms of the writer in Le Mus\u00e9on seem to be often less happy than the suggestions of the contributor of the Journal Asiatique. The word urdi, which occurs in the Sajarah Malayu, has occasioned some discussion; M. Devic thinks those wrong who have derived it from the English word \"order,\" and supposes that, when the chronicle describes Albuquerque as going to Europe for urdi, it is an armada that is meant. M. Marre points out that, besides \"order\" in English and Dutch, urdi may possibly be referable to ordem, ordens, in Portuguese. There is little to be said for M. Devic's emendation, but it is not necessary, on the other hand, to agree with M. Marre that le mot \"urdi\" est Malais. He will find it to be Hindustani quite as much.\nThe Sepoy in British India calls his uniform urdi, i.e., the dress which he has to wear by regulation.*\n\nM. Marre is quite right when he tells M. Devic that burong ular and burong kambing do not mean oiseau des serpents and oiseau des chevres, but oiseau-serpent and oiseau-ch\u00e8vre. His correction of the proffered translation of ber-budak is equally sound. But why he finds M. Devic\u2019s translation of niaris lepas deri tangan to be stup\u00e9fiante is not so clear. The passage quoted evidently means that the prince narrowly escaped dying of his illness. Malay abounds with figurative expressions regarding death.\n\nNeither of the disputants can suggest the real meaning of kain manchong. M. Devic says that manchong is equivalent to panchong and means a garment cut in a point. M. Marre gives manchong up, and proposes to read ber-kain panjang. The phrase is descriptive of a particular mode of wearing the sarong. Ber-kain manchong signifies to wear the sarong caught up short on the right side and long on the left with one end hanging down in front. It is considered a sign of ostentation. It is incorrect to confuse manchong with munchong, as M. Marre does. Munchong means the snout or muzzle of an animal, e.g., of a pig or dog. If applied to the human nose, it means \u201cprotruding,\u201d not necessarily \u201caquiline.\u201d Favre and Klinkert have misunderstood a phrase in which the word occurs. (Malay Proverbs, Supra, p. 81, No. 269.)\n\nI have not referred to the Sajarah Malayu to consult the text which the expression limau mangkar occurs. M. Devic does not find mangkar in Favre\u2019s dictionary, and suggests that it may be the name of a country. M. Marre rejects this idea, and prefers to regard the word as a description of a particular variety of limau. It would not need a great stretch of the imagination to suppose that, by a clerical error, mangkar might have been written for mangkasar, Macassar, and, if this is allowable, here is the name of a country at M. Devic\u2019s service. But mangkar (cf. mangkal) as applied to fruit, has a meaning of its own; durian mangkar is a durian which, though to all appearances ripe, is hard and uneatable inside. Limau\n\n* Wardi is found in Shakespear\u2019s Hindustani Dictionary and there said to be derived from the English and to mean \u201cword, order.\u201d\nmangkar may be equivalent to limu manqkal, a green lime just picked, but I do not know if this interpretation will agree with the context.\n\nM. Devic would like to derive the Malay words tuan and kiai (a title), from the Persian, while M. Marre, with much reason, points out that a Malay dictionary would be hardly the place for suggestions of this sort. Why does M. Devic fix upon tuan (which he refers to the Persian tuwanisten, to be able; tuv\u00e1na, powerful; tuwan, force, power) and leave unnoticed the pronoun ini, this (Persian, \u0627\u06cc\u0646 in, this)?\n\nIt is not necessary to examine in detail the other words in the list, and the various remarks made about them by both writers. It may be pointed out, however, that the word \u0628\u0644\u062a, which Favre writes balit, is really b\u00eblit (compare lilit). Ber-jalan dua tiga b\u00eblit signifies, as M. Devic states, \"to take two or three turns in walking,\" but both he and M. Marre, by following Favre's spelling, give an incorrect idea of the pronunciation of the word.\n\nFavre's Malay-French dictionary may, no doubt, be supplemented by hundreds of words, but they will be gathered probably from colloquial intercourse with Malays, and from books not consulted by the Reverend Abb\u00e9. The Sajarah Malayu, which is one of the authorities most often quoted by the Abb\u00e9 Favre, was not likely to furnish M. Devic with much material for new lexicological notes of value.\n\nW. E. M.\nMISCELLANEOUS NOTES.\n\nMALACCA IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\n\n[The following short paper is a translation from the old Dutch records in the Government Offices at Malacca, by the Government translator, which I have revised a little, and to which I have added a few explanatory notes, for some of which I am indebted to Mr. J. E. Westerhout.\n\nD. F. A. H.]\n\nExtract from the Diary of Malacca in the year 1756.\n\nIn the Fortress of Malacca, Anno 1756.\n\nNovember, Monday, 1st.\n\nHaving some days ago received news here, that R\u00e2ja Sa\u00efd of Sel\u00e2ngor, a relation of Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja, had joined the enemy at Kl\u00eawang* with all his forces, there was no longer any doubt but that we should hear of them before long.\n\nOur suspicions were confirmed too soon.\n\nThe enemy, wishing to shew their heroic valour to their new allies, the pirates of R\u00e2ja Sa\u00efd lately arrived from Sel\u00e2ngor, marched to Gevesteyn,\u2020 the country seat of the Hon\u2019ble Thomas Schippers, Attorney-General of the Netherlands Indies, taking the road\n\n* This is the place now called Kl\u00eabang. It was originally called \u201cKl\u00eawang\u201d owing to the murder of a Malay with an Achinese weapon of that name; so the story goes. But probably the original name was really \u201cKl\u00eabang,\u201d the name of a tree, and was changed by some Kling or other mispronunciation to \u201cKl\u00eawang\u201d and this story told to account for it. It is about three miles from the Stadt-house.\n\n\u2020 This was at B\u00e2chang, near the junction of the Malim and B\u00e2tu B\u00ebrendam roads, about two miles from the Stadt-house.\nthrough the jungle round the Lazarus-house.* They had once before, some time since, attacked the same place, but had then been vigorously repulsed by the 15 Malay defenders of the house; who were well armed with muskets and a blunderbuss. On the occasion of this second attack, they placed combustibles at the doors and windows, and the smoke and fire produced by this stratagem compelled the Malays to surrender after a short resistance, when they were brought as prisoners to Kl\u00eawang.\n\nBut two of them escaped on the way thither, and brought the news here that the enemy with their whole force were at Gevesteyn and intended to come to this place.\n\nLieutenant POPPALL was ordered at once to operate against them with 80 European soldiers, together with the Bugis garrisoned here, and 200 natives and Chinese.\n\nThey marched in the greatest silence to Gevesteyn, where the enemy were supposed to be stationed, but on their arrival at that place, the enemy had fled already (as was their custom) leaving marks of their visit behind, everything in the neighbourhood having been burnt down, destroyed and ruined.\n\nOur troops before returning crossed to the Lazarus-house, hoping to meet the enemy there; but on their arrival found the latter had left this place too and gone to Kl\u00eawang. So our troops were obliged to return without having effected their object.\n\nTuesday, 2nd November.\n\nThis morning our Captain STEFANUS ELIAS VAN STEK, leaving the place by Tranquera gate, took the road to the Lazarus-house accompanied by our master-carpenter and eighty European soldiers, together with our Bugis and some natives.\n\nAccording to the instructions of the Hon'ble the Governor, he was to select a suitable place in that neighbourhood for the construction of a bentang to contain a small garrison with some\n\n* This was at a place called \"Lindongan,\" where boats used to lie for shelter: it is now called \"Limongan,\" and is about two miles from the Stadt-house along the road to Tanjong Kling, and used also to be known as \"Baker's Plain.\" The Hospital was supported by a fund.\nartillery, as a temporary outpost, to put a stop to the marauding parties, which appeared almost daily right opposite Tranquera gate.* continually alarming the inhabitants on that side of the town.\n\nThey had hardly passed the gate, when they received news that the enemy were marching on the town with their whole force divided into two columns, one taking the road by Gevesteyn, the other the main road direct from the Lazarus-house.\n\nThe Captain then thought it better to operate against the enemy with his troops, and force them into an engagement if they stood firm. So he at once detached a column of 40 Europeans with 150 Chinese and Malays, all well-armed, towards Gevesteyn to attack the enemy advancing from that side; while he kept with him the other 40 Europeans with the Bugis of the garrison, 50 in number, and a few natives, to meet the enemy coming along the road from the Lazarus-house.\n\nThe party marching towards Gevesteyn met the enemy there, more than 300 strong, at halt on a plain quietly taking their food; upon seeing which they quickly advanced and attacked them with a well directed volley from their muskets. The enemy, not at all on their guard, fled to the neighbouring jungle, picking up a few things as they went, but in such a hurry and confusion, that they left behind a great number of arms, bullets and sarongs. Thence they fled to the jungle round the Lazarus-house, where our troops could not follow them so easily, but they found the jungle paths stained all over with blood, certain proof that many of the enemy had been wounded.\n\nOur Captain and his troops arriving near the house of the Jenlif (Tamil) Kisna, discovered the enemy on a large plain opposite the Lazarus-house. When they saw our soldiers drawing near, they\n\n*One account says this was so named after a Portuguese man of note; another states that there was a fierce elephant in the neighbourhood at Gajah Berang and hence the name and he would not come any nearer because he saw the place was cleared, \"Trangk\u00e9ra.\" \"Tranquera\" means \"an obstacle,\" probably used to denote one of the outworks beyond the fortress. The gate is at the end of Heeren Street, known to the natives as Kampong Blanda, a quarter of a mile or so from the Stadt-house; Tranquera itself extends to a mile or so from the Stadt-house.\nfired several rounds, upon which our Captain drew up his troops in order of battle, and returned the compliment with a volley from whole line. Meantime those of the enemy who had been driven from Gevesteyn came forward out of the jungle behind the Lazarus-house and joined their comrades. Our troops from Gevesteyn followed their example.\n\nOur forces then marched in excellent order, firing continuously at the enemy, who retired as we advanced. When we reached the middle of the plain, those of the enemy who were hidden in the jungle began to fire with their long M\u00fcnangk\u00e2bau guns, which carry a very great distance.\n\nOur Captain then at once ordered the B\u00fbgis and native soldiers with a few Europeans to place themselves on the right and left flanks, and march against the enemy from all quarters. His orders having been obeyed promptly and with precision by the B\u00fbgis and native troops, the Captain himself with 50 Europeans attacked the centre of the enemy. The latter very soon fell into disorder and fled into the jungle, dragging their killed and wounded with them to Kl\u00eawang.\n\nThus ended the first part of this expedition at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, in which engagement we had not one man wounded.\n\nOur Captain, having taken possession of the Lazarus-house thought it better not to stay there too long, because the building stood in the midst of dense jungle, where the enemy could very easily conceal themselves without fear of being discovered, and thence injure our troops very much.\n\nHe, therefore, resolved to return with drums beating to his former position and stay there till night. After he had returned thither and taken a rest of about half-an-hour, the enemy reappeared in large parties, dancing and shouting most horribly, trying to intimidate our troops.\n\nOur Captain immediately despatched a mounted messenger to the Hon'ble the Governor to ask him to send two culverins under a strong escort, which he expected would produce a good effect in this case.\n\nMeanwhile the enemy seemed disposed to hold their position at\nthe Lazarus-house, whence they incessantly fired on our troops, and we served them with the same sauce.\n\nOur troops were so enraged with the enemy, that it was almost impossible for the Captain to repeat the tactics he had made use of in the morning, viz., of a simultaneous attack on the flanks and the centre, but the enemy did not long resist, soon taking to flight, and this time in such a hurry, that they had to leave some of their killed behind; they had many killed and still more wounded. But we too had six wounded in this engagement, three of them Europeans and very seriously, three natives very slightly.\n\nHaving thus a second time expelled them from the Lazarus-house, the Captain returned to his former position, where he had that day already twice posted his troops.\n\nThe two culverins sent for having arrived and been placed on the sea-shore under cover of some small jungle, so that the enemy could not perceive them, the Captain took the necessary measures and those best suited to receive the enemy in such a manner, should they again return, that they would be satisfied for a long time to come. But it seemed that they were already satisfied, for they did not re-appear; and the Captain after waiting in vain till 5 o'clock in the afternoon ordered the return march to the Fortress.\n\nSaturday, 27th November.\n\nSome days before we had received news that the enemy, more than 500 strong, having forced their way through the jungle, were again stationed at Feringgi* near the Malay temple, and were making a very strong bentang there, intending to wait there for the approaching dry monsoon, and the arrival of their allies the Menangkabaus from Rembau, and then with their combined forces to invade Bunga Raya and Banda Ilir, at the same time attacking the town by a descent of the river on rafts, and so to put into execution the infernal project they had long devised of burning\n\n* This place, about two miles from town on the Durian Tunggal road, is said to be so named from the man who first cleared the place (a Portuguese) and who afterwards went to Tampin and made an orchard at Durian Feringgi, now one of the frontier boundary points.\nand destroying all the property and massacreing all the inhabitants.\n\nThe Governor, on receiving this news last night, at once gave orders that this very day a detachment of 60 European soldiers with the B\u00fbgis, numbering 50 men, and a battalion of Chinese and native military should take the field against the enemy.\n\nThe marines and sailors of the vessels stationed here, viz., \"De drei Henvelen\" and the \"Waeereld\" with a corps of volunteers formed the reserve.\n\nThese combined forces, numbering about 300 men, commanded by Ensign Kruythoff, lately arrived from Batavia, and Sergeant Meyer, left this town in the greatest silence at half past four this morning, and marched off straight by Pauklarame * (Pangk\u00e2lan R\u00e2ma) to F\u00e9ringa. Though they had a great deal of trouble on their way thither, the enemy having covered the roads with innumerable caltrops, our troops still reached their destination at half past five.\n\nThey were only discovered when at a short distance from the enemy's bentang and the latter, warned by their sentries, were up in arms at once, abusing our troops from a distance, and calling out to them to come nearer if they dared.\n\nOur Ensign Kruythoff, knowing this part of the country thoroughly, then detached the marines and sailors with the volunteers and some natives, and despatched them through the jungle to the opposite side of the bentang, with the order that they should fire again when they had reached the spot agreed on. The B\u00fbgis and one-half of the European soldiers were stationed in the jungle right in front of the bentang, while the rest of the Europeans under Kruythoff himself were stationed at the side of the main road to Malacca. The report of the gun fired by the detached troops was to be the signal for a general attack.\n\n* \"Pangk\u00e2lan,\" landing-place. \"R\u00e2ma\" or \"R\u00e2me\" is said to be a corruption of \"ramei,\" populous; the Dutch spelling does suggest that there has been a change in the pronunciation of the word in the lapse of time, but there are other derivations which might be equally plausible, such as the name \"R\u00e2ma\" a Hindu name, dating from pre-Mohamedan days. The place is a little over a mile from town on the D\u00fbrian Tunggal road.\nThe enemy, unaware of these arrangements, continually shouted at our troops, abusing and provoking them as much as they could.\n\nAfter the lapse of a quarter of an hour we heard the report of the gun, and thus knew that our companions had reached the intended point. The bentang was then attacked from three sides at the same time.\n\nThe enemy, remaining firmly in their bentang, fought as gallantly as ever a native enemy did. We had expected that they would have come to meet us, but they did not this time, and very much disappointed our soldiers, who, exposed to their fire, had to fight against the walls of their bentang.\n\nBut when our troops had two or three European soldiers killed, they could no longer be restrained; the grenadiers with their hand-grenades stormed the bentang, thus taking the lead of the other troops which followed close on their heels.\n\nThis created such disorder among the enemy that they decided to break up their centre, and with their amok-runners in front they tried to cut themselves a way through our troops at two corners of the bentang.\n\nOur Commander, perceiving their intention, ordered a general charge with the bayonet, in which close engagement the enemy had 40 men killed, and certainly more than double that number wounded, our troops having fought with the greatest irritation.\n\nAfter burning down their bentang, our various forces were re-assembled, and returned to Malacca with drums beating and colours flying, carrying as trophies the heads of those of the enemy whom they had killed, on the points of their bayonets and lances.\n\nWe had six men killed, four of whom were soldiers, one a volunteer and one a Chinaman, and not more than 5 men wounded, among the natives and volunteers, and none of them seriously.\nMISCELLANEOUS NOTES.\n\nA TIGER HUNT IN JAVA.\n\n(Extracted from the \"Ceylon Observer.\")\n\nThe slaughter which takes place among the cattle of Java, Sumatra and Bali, through tigers, panthers and wild dogs, is greater than is supposed. In remote, thinly populated districts, children (not small ones) and even full grown persons are killed by the royal tiger, and now and then similar cases occur in more inhabited places. Even here, in the neighbourhood of Sinagar (below Soekaboemi, Preanger), a thickly populated and almost entirely cleared district, I have had the sad experience that, in a short time, one can lose much cattle, horses and sheep through wild beasts.\n\nIn the first four years of my residence here, before I had become acquainted with the use of tiger poisons, I lost in this manner 14 horses and karbouws.* Since then also I have not been exempt; but by employing the poison which I am about to describe the loss of cattle has gradually decreased.\n\nThe poison which was employed by me is a yellowish brown powder, obtained from the bark of a climbing plant called wali kambing, found in the low marshy regions along the coasts of Java (among others near Tangerang, in the Bantam province and near Wijnkoopsbaai).\n\nIn Filet's Plantkundig Woordenboek voor Nederlandsch Indie (Leyden, Gualth Kolff, 1876) the plant is referred to under No. 8,705:\u2014\"Wali kambing j. Sarcolobus spanoghei miq. Nat. ord. of the Asclepiadeae; loc. Java; creeper. This plant, with others of the same family, is employed to intoxicate boars, tigers and other\n\n* Buffaloes.\nanimals for fighting; if the animal is not wounded it dies of this poison; but if it receives a wound which draws blood it recovers.\"\n\nWhat the writer means exactly by \"to intoxicate for fighting\" is not quite clear to me. If one were to use wali kambing for a tiger intended for a rampok exhibition, the animal would be made quite useless for the purpose, for it would become uneasy, gradually less active, and finally paralysed.\n\nAmong the \"other plants of the same family\" the Sarcobolus globosus is apparently also referred to.\n\nAs to what Filet says of restoration by bleeding, this statement agrees with what is said in Rigg's Sundanese Dictionary, p. 527 (Batavia, Lange & Co., 1865):\u2014 \"The root is bruised and mixed up with rice or other food, and placed in the way of wild pigs, which, after eating it, become insensible and torpid; but on bleeding them they recover.\" \u2020\n\nThe idea of bleeding wild pigs is more or less strange; but it must be assumed that the operation is to be performed not with lancet or fleam but with gollok \u2021 or klewang \u00a7 and not for any definite surgical purpose.\n\n* \"Rampog. To spear animals for amusement: a circle of men is formed, each man being armed with a spear, and whenever the animal comes at the ring, he is received on the spears. The native chiefs have exhibitions on their alun-aluns of this kind of public amusement. The tiger is the animal practised upon, which is uncaged in the midst for that purpose.\" \u2014Rigg's Sundanese Dict.\n\n\u2020 We give the context of the extract at follows:\u2014\"Wali-kambing.\u2014Name of the liane growing along some parts of the low coasts of Java. It is found, amongst other places, near the coast from the mouth of the Chidani towards Bantam. The root is bruised and mixed up with boiled rice or other food and placed in the way of wild pigs, which, after eating it, become insensible and torpid, but on bleeding them they recover. It is called Peler kambing about Batavia. Wali, G. [Clough's Sinhalese Dictionary] 628, wild, living in the wood. 'The fruit of a species of Contorta called Kalak-kambing, has a deadly effect on tigers. It is prepared by the admixture of other vegetables, and exposed on a piece of rag at the places frequented by them. In some districts their number has been sensibly diminished by this poison.' Horsfield. Raffles' Java, vol. I, p. 347. It would thus appear that a vegetable preparation known by somewhat different names, but all terminating in kambing, goat or sheep, has a deleterious effect upon wild animals and is in different parts of Java used for the purpose of stupefying wild beasts.\"\n\n\u2021 Cutlass. [Chopper.\u2014Ed.]\n\n\u00a7 Sword.\nThe statement of Mr. Rigg, that \"the root is bruised,\" is less exact. Although poisonous properties are found in the whole plant, the substance which is used for poisoning is obtained from the innermost bark of the stem. The fine outermost bark is first scraped away; even that of the smallest twigs can be used. The *wali kambing* is a plant with whiteish stem and leaves of the same colour. It is said that the fruits can be eaten with impunity. They taste like unripe papaya and have a peculiar shape, from which the *wali kambing* borrows another name. This name, however, for decency's sake, I shall not give.\n\nIt may be true that poisoned animals recover by the drawing of blood, but I can neither confirm nor contradict the statement, nor can I give any information as to the effect of the poison under notice on pigs.\n\nIt still requires much trouble and expense to obtain good *wali kambing* here, so that I have used the poison only for tigers and wild dogs.\n\nA bitch of an European cross, in pup, was poisoned a couple of years ago at Ardjasairi, through having partaken only too freely of the carcase of a buffalo prepared for tigers. The dog vomited much, became gradually paralysed, and remained lying three or four days stiff and as if lifeless; it then recovered slowly, and in due course brought into the world half-a-dozen healthy pups, which did not suffer in any way.\n\nI imagine, therefore, though I cannot say it with certainty, that in some cases, when the tiger has not swallowed much of the poison, it may recover from the effects. I know of cases, however, where without doubt poisoned flesh was eaten by a tiger, and yet no trace was to be found of the patient.\n\nIn the *Maandblad voor Natuurwetenschappen*, 8th year, No. 3, is a paper by Mr. Boscha Jzn., Phil. Nat. Cand., \"On the Poisonous constituent of *Sarcolobus spanoghei miq.*\"\n\nThe writer therein details the method and the result of his chemical investigation of a quantity of *wali kambing* sent to him for that purpose by me, and sums up his opinion as follows:\u2014\"I consider, from the corresponding indications of the physiological\neffect, the smell, and the chemical reactions, that I can pronounce with perfect certainty the poisonous matter of the *Sarcolobus spagnhei* to be coniine.\"\n\nConiine is the alkaloid to which is ascribed the poisonous nature of the hemlock or *Conium maculatum*\u2014the plant, with the juice of which, according to historical tradition, Socrates was put to death.\n\nIn the *Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederl. Indie*, part 15, p. 478, also will probably appear a report on the value and effect of the *wali kambing*. I regret that I cannot here make use of that aper, the more so as it is from the hands of our able chemist and quinologist Bernelot Moens and his now deceased brother.\n\nIt is known to the people in the neighbourhood here that, as soon as a head of a cattle has been carried off by a tiger, information is at once to be conveyed to me of the fact. I then send persons who are accustomed to make their way through jungle and waste, well armed, to the place where the slaughter has taken place, and the carcase is by them strewn over with poison (for a buffalo a beer glass three-fourths filled is sufficient; for a sheep or goat much less is needed); they are armed, because the tiger is sometimes found to come back again to his prey very quickly. My brother at Ardjasiri went himself two years ago to poison a sheep which had the previous night been taken by a royal tiger out of the fold in the middle of the factory *kampong*, and carried away close to his house through the middle of his vegetable garden. (*N. B.*\u2014The door of the fold, made of plaited bamboo, to which the sheep had been fastened, was dragged by the tiger for some distance.) In the course of the day it was discovered where the tiger had concealed the sheep. Then my brother, at about 5 in the afternoon, forced his way through the high *glagah* * to the place where the sheep lay, he found the tiger already there, which was busy preparing to carry the sheep further into the interior.\n\nThe thick cane brake rendered impossible a good shot at the beast of prey, which with amazing springs escaped from the bullet intended for it. The sheep was thereupon carefully prepared,\n\n---\n\n*The grass saccharum spontaneum.*\nand the following morning at 6 o'clock no trace of it was to be found except a few bloody flecks of wool. Although the whole neighbourhood was up to 2 o'clock the same day thoroughly searched and traced, neither then nor afterwards was anything seen of the tiger.\n\nTo prepare the carcase properly, long cuts are made in the fleshiest parts, which are closed again after wali kambing has been strewn in them. Of a buffalo, the neck, loins, groin and thighs are the parts most liked by the tiger. The ears also are usually found eaten off.\n\nFrom the condition in which buffaloes and horses killed by tigers are found, it is to be inferred that horses, colts and young buffaloes are seized sideways or from in front, after which the throat is bitten through. The tiger seizes full-grown horned buffaloes generally by one of the legs, which must then, on account of the desperate efforts of the victim to release itself, be held fast with terrible strength. Skin and flesh are often found under the claws of the tiger, cut in a circular form from the leg. With a stroke of the claw in the groin of the buffalo the belly of the strong beast is torn open, and then, defenceless from pain and loss of blood, it is dispatched. Wild dogs also hunt and seize cattle from behind. On cows which have managed to escape from a troop of wild dogs, I have seen the traces of the fearful bites of these beasts, whole pieces of the flesh being torn from the hinder part of the belly.\n\nA carcase which has been already eaten from during one night or even three, and which then swarms with maggots, is still suitable for poisoning, as the tiger (as also dogs even) is not unwilling to have his game in the condition I found set forth in a French work on pheasants:\u2014\"Pour manger un bon faisan, il faut qu'il change de place tout seul.\"\n\nAfter having seasoned the titbit, the surrounding population must be warned to keep their dogs fast tied up, or they would otherwise feast themselves on what was not meant for them. On the following day early in the morning, it must be ascertained by means of persons sent whether any of the carcase has been eaten,\nand an endeavour must also be made to prevent many people coming to have a peep at the carcase; as though the tiger is not specially timid at night, I have known of cases where, on account of the traces of numerous visitors during the day, the tiger has found it unadvisable to return at night.\n\nWith properly armed and trained hunters, and also with dogs, one can trace, when some of the bait has been eaten, the direction taken by the tiger, but this is often difficult and sometimes fruitless.\n\nThe almost entirely inaccessible and densely overgrown spot which the tiger chooses for his \"kraton\"* makes it extremely fatiguing for Europeans to track him; but, hard though it be, it is a possibility to find a poisoned tiger; to track a healthy tiger is, in my opinion, except by a stroke of good luck, a hopeless task.\n\nThe well-known tiger hunts of the English in Bengal are mostly carried out in an entirely different kind of country. There are, as a rule, extensive plains with comparatively moderate undulations. The jungles (thick canebrake and scrub) and the nullahs (small ravines, in which a rivulet or brook meanders and which are sometimes also overgrown) offer little hindrance to the hunter, who places himself, with some good weapons, some bottles of soda-water, and the invariable \"cheroots\" in a so-called howdah on the back of the elephant, with a mahout to guide the animal. The fearless, sharp-sighted elephants do duty as beaters, and so the tigers, roused by a long row of elephants and huntsmen, are shot down from above from the moving panggung.\u2020\n\nEven if we had here trained elephants, they would be useless in Java (except on occasional plains here and there), and especially so in the steep thickly wooded ravines of the greater part of the Preanger.\n\nAfter prolonged drought, tracking is naturally more difficult than in wet weather, when the ground shows the trace of the game more plainly. If it is not found plentifully near the carcase, an\n\n* Palace.\n\u2020 Elevated stage, platform, watch-tower.\nattempt must be made to \"cut the track,\" that is search in a wide circle round the place where the game has been and across his track.\n\nIf one has good dogs, which are by no means to be had everywhere, they may be utilised (only not close to the tempting smell of the bait). The dogs will probably not attack the tiger, they will generally not dare to go far from the hunter, but they will point out the presence of the game to him if he is acquainted with their habits.\n\nIf one is on the right track, vomited flesh and other strongly smelling tokens of the tiger's sickness are found. Sometimes the patient is found dead; sometimes, two days after the eating of the poisoned flesh, still quite ready for the fight. Sometimes also healthy tigers are found keeping company with the sick one; and it is therefore necessary always to exercise the greatest caution. If one comes upon steep declivities caution is still more needful, for the radius of a tiger's spring in a downward direction is much greater than on a flat or in an upward direction.\n\nI once tried to shoot a tiger-panther which was lying above me against a steep declivity, through the head. The bullet went through his ear, and with a spring and a terrific snarl the raging beast stood crouched at my feet. Only by the good help of a troop of dogs did I escape from the claws of the *wali-kambing-ed toetoele.*\n\nAlready, since the beginning of 1863, forty head of royal tigers and panthers and a large number of wild dogs have thus been destroyed by me and my hunters: and by my brother at Ardjasari near Bandoeng, whom I had provided with *wali kambing*, two panthers and six royal tigers.\n\nIn 1875, my brother at Ardjasari sent a descriptive narrative of a tiger hunt to his absent wife.\n\nAlthough this account was not written for public perusal, it seemed to me so suited to be appended in a supplement to my paper\n\n---\n\n* \"Tutul.\u2014Spotted, marked with spots or blotches. Maung tutul, the spotted tiger, a panther.\"\u2014Rigg's S. D.*\nintended for your journal, as a rather more highly coloured illustration than that paper is, that I sought and obtained the permission of the writer to do so.\n\nThe portion of the letter referred to is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"You remember the tract of land which is still wholly uninhabited above our plantation, a little below the edge of the forest that covers the Malabar; where we breakfasted a couple of years ago with our guests H. and C. under a clump of bamboos, which served as a tent from the sun? Early in the morning it looked somewhat less sunny and gay than when we made a little fire to boil the water for our coffee; when seats were placed in a circle round a camp table, and the ladies of our company unpacked boxes rich in promise: and when there was such merry chat and laughter, whilst all eyes feasted themselves on the prospect over the sunny expanse of Bandjaran.\n\n\"In the early morning of 2nd February, 1875, it was wet and cold. It had rained the whole night, and thick clouds, from which still fell steadily a fine chill drizzle, hung gray and chill and heavy over the erstwhile charming landscape.\n\n\"On an open patch between the belts lay a dead karbouw, fearfully torn and mangled, and a group of thirty living buffaloes stood in melancholy, pensive attitude. What was going on in the buffalo-heads could be gathered by the glance of an eye. The silent beasts were thinking of their deadly enemy, the tiger, who the night before had fallen upon and killed one of their brethren, and who had come back that night to feast on his prey. An old, melancholy, staring buffalo cow, perhaps mother or aunt of the one so cruelly slain, sniffled in Buffalese to the bull standing nearest to her: 'Hodie mihi, cras tibi!' and the bull shook his terrible horns angrily, as if he would say: 'I would that he would try conclusions with me for once!'\n\n\"But see! there comes more life in the misty sombre landscape. Horses are heard splashing through a stream (you know the stream into which H. let his shoes fall when he was wading barefoot through the water, so as not to spoil the patent leather), and out of the fog a hunting train appears: in front is the djoera-\nArdjasari, whom you know, armed with his heavy Forsyth gun, called by the natives 'si mariam' (the cannon); following him the 'djoeragan gamboeng' with a clean-shooting central-fire smooth-bore hunting-piece, then several mandoers,\u2020 Setra, Alsah, Alimon, Hassim, &c., with less choice firearms, among which are seen some with the barrel bound to the butt and stock with rattan; lastly, Aspan our cowkeeper, armed with a lance. The horses of the two first-named were led by hand in the rear by a pair of stable-boys.\n\n\"The 'file' now appears to become aware of the murder of the buffalo; it mounts and descends, seeks its way through the belts, and at length reaches the place where the murdered karbouw lies. The brothers and friends of the slain go respectfully to one side.\n\n\"From another direction other men appear; they are descendants of the followers of Confucius, Thio Ten Djoelong and his son, both with guns, besides the owner of the massacred beast with a number of the inhabitants of the babakan \u2021 Tji-Enggang bearing no other weapons but the inseparable gollok.\n\n\"All the men examine the dead buffalo earnestly and carefully, and find to their satisfaction that the tiger, in spite of the rainy weather, has eaten greedily of his prey, which, by order, of djoeragan Ardjasari, had the previous evening been well spiced, not with moutarde de maille, or with Worcester sauce, but with (you know) the fearful wali kambing. After some consultation, a commencement was made with the difficult, to us at first apparently almost hopeless, task of tracking the murderer on this\n\n---\n\n* \"Juragan.\u2014A headman or leader in any way.

They do indeed find, at a distance of a couple of paces, vomited blood and mucus, but nothing besides this is to be found on the ground, which has been washed thoroughly during the night. Several kampong dogs which have been brought soon show themselves, as nearly always is the case, to be not worth their salt; they run unconcernedly, after their masters, and soon everyone is convinced that if they were not tied fast they would in a trice give themselves a frightful indigestion with the remains of the tiger table.\n\n\"The 14 hunters now disperse to examine the tract patiently and carefully in all directions. One of the natives has had the luck to see imprinted on an overgrown spot the footprint of the tiger; he goes in the direction towards which the claw points, finding now and then an unsavory indication, and at length stops at the edge of the densely overgrown steep ravine of the kali * Tji Enggang, on a place where the tiger appears to have lain awhile, and where he must have felt very unwell, as evidently appears from a great mass of vomited flesh. Hurrah! hurrah! the trace is found. The scattered company is called together; two of the most experienced trackers are sent on in front; Djoeragan A. S. follows; his son pushes near to him through the brushwood that covers the steep slippery declivity of the ravine, in order to press his father once more fervently to his breast: 'that in God's name he would be cautious!' the cocks of the guns are heard uttering a threatening 'tick-tack' as they are pulled up, and the long row goes forward descending slopingly along the edge of the ravine (in a southern direction or up-stream), led by the two trackers, who now and then receive an admonition not to be over-hasty and rather to wait a little when they might be in doubt.\n\n\"With the exception of several high but widely scattered trees, this tract was covered with various kinds of brushwood, different varieties of bamboo, and in many places thick with Honjeh \u2020 and\n\n* A brook, river.\n\u2020 \"Honje.\u2014A scitameneous plant, formerly called Geanthus speciosus, but nowadays called Elettaria.

The best of this tract for our hunt consisted in this, that the tiger's tracks were easier to find here in the soft clay and rotting layer of leaves than above on the buffalo pasture. Here and there the goloks had to be taken in hand to clear a passage for us. Steepness, slipperiness and foot-entangling roots here gave the most trouble. Now and then the leaders lost the trace and all had to come up and look right and left for the right trace again. The tiger had taken a peculiar road: first southwards up-stream; next straight down towards the kali, apparently to drink; after that again northwards down-stream. With stubborn patience the file indienne of hunters followed through the dripping branches, until, after an hour and a half we saw footprints so fresh that, the particles of earth seemed not yet to have settled down; we also again found vomited flesh, etc., so that we had the certainty, that the right trace was not lost (among other tiger tracks).\n\n\"We had forced our way through a patch somewhat overgrown with glagah, when the foremost man had suddenly stood still imagining he heard rustling through the foliage; here the trace unexpectedly diverged somewhat to the right; the file of the hunters was somewhat broken in the search for the new trace, R. and the mandoers and other natives with him formed a sort of right-wing; Aspan the cowherd and Baba Djoelong went in front; I was No. 3 of the file. Baba was a pace or so in front of me, when I saw him lift his gun. The report of the explosion in the thick jungle mingled with the fierce and to us delightful roar of the tiger found at last. I spring hastily forward, catch a glimpse through the bushes of part of the back and shoulder of the enemy creeping up towards an eminence, black cross-stripes on a yellowish ground\u2014and the deep voice of 'si mariam.'\n\n* Tepus.\u2014A scitameneous plant, Gcanthus coccineus.\"\u2014Rigg's S.

Moving forward a few steps, I then managed to see the whole of the tiger, who is already lying on his back, but still motioning menacingly. All ten shots had struck, and fearful that the rug which I had promised you for your bedroom would be riddled like a sieve I ordered a cessation of fire and approached the tiger within about 12 paces. He was still living, showed me his formidable teeth, and contracted his claws convulsively. By general request I thereupon sent a 'settler' through the enemy's head, who at once sank back powerless, whilst the contracted claws were immediately relaxed.\n\n\"Then the natives raised a mad cry of delight. They yelled and fired salvoes of joy as long as they had powder; and whilst R. and I, seated on the decaying trunk of a tree overgrown with moss and ferns, smoked our cigarettes and divided our supply of tobacco amongst all our comrades of the chase, litter-poles of bamboo were cut and a rough sort of rope made from split rattan.\n\n\"We confessed to each other (R. and J.), that this result of the hunt far exceeded our expectation; for when in the morning we got on our horses in the rain and rode up more or less numbed, with the prospect of all traces being washed away, the hope was certainly very small.\n\n\"In descending the mountain we marched, with the tiger carried by four men in front, in the manner of a triumphal procession through the Tji Enggang kampoeng, where lives the owner of the herd of karbouws, so many of which had been eaten up by tigers (you know that a week or so ago one of our buffaloes also, which was bought for f52, shared the fate).\n\n\"Wasn't there joy in Tji-Enggang!\"\n\"As we neared home, a corps of nine or ten *angklong* players met us, for the winged rumor had already preceded us and to the playing of *angklongs* a circuit of the factory was made, at which the natives became fearfully excited.\n\n\"You are sure to remember that mad *gegil* \u2020 of that time when I came to the house with a *toetoel* which had stolen a calf from us.\n\n\"When the tiger was laid in our front verandah between the two middle columns, the court was black with men.

For instance, he says:\u2014\"Batin SAPI, an Orang laut, went to bring Tunku LONG from Bulang. 'I think he was away four days. Batin SAPI came back first, and then Tunku LONG came.'\"\n\nNow, it is very unlikely that Sir STAMFORD RAFFLES, who had some knowledge and experience in Malay etiquette, would send a single \"Orang laut\" to summon to his presence a Prince of the Royal Blood, whom he intended to make Sultan of Johor, in order to obtain a proper cession of Singapore, and considering it a pity to allow such an erroneous statement pass to posterity as history, I have made enquiries from the best authorities, and find that two Anak Raja, namely, Raja OMBONG and Inche WAN ABDUL-LAH, were the persons entrusted with the mission, and they brought Tunku LONG here, having found him fishing in the Straits of Rhio. These Anak Raja received each $500 for their trouble. My chief informant has been Mr. C. F. KEUN, who derived his information from Tunku PURBA, wife of Sultan HUSSEIN; from Raja PRANG, brother of Raja OMBONG, and from Tunku DAGANG: and the account seems generally accepted by the Malays as correct. It is\n\n*[With reference to this \"Note,\" it may be as well to give the letter with which the previous \"Note\" was forwarded for Journal No. 10, which is here referred to:\u2014\n\n\"All the accounts I have got hold of in H.'s extensive library are contradictory. Thus in 'Sir Stamford Raffles' Life by his Widow' no definite account is given of his landing, but it says that the account as given by CRAWFORD in the \"Embassy to Siam\" is wrong. In the first number of the predecessor of the Straits Asiatic Society's Journal, dated 1875, another account is given; and then there is the 'Hik\u00e2iat Abdullah' which differs from all. So that really I think old WA HAKIM's account is useful. I have put it in a condensed form.\" ED.]\nalso, I believe, confirmed by Munshi Abdullah in his \"Hikayat,\" but I cannot, at present, refer to the book.\n\nThe idea of a Batin being sent on such a mission will make Malays, or those acquainted with their manners and customs, smile; but it is very possible that Batin Sapi accompanied the \"noblemen\" mentioned above.\n\nW. H. R.\n\nLATAH.\n\nI have received several communications from different quarters upon the subject of my recent paper on Latah. On one point, my correspondents seem to be agreed, viz., that the omission of Chinese from the list of residents in the Straits who are afflicted with Latah, is due to my defective observation.\n\nIt would shew great presumption were I to say definitely that those who have favoured me with their criticism are wrong in their opinion; but it would be equally false humility on my part to admit its correctness, upon the data which lie before me.\n\nIn no case have any reasons been given for the assumption that I am in error; nor are any particularised instances referred to by which such error might be corrected or modified.\n\nAnd I may add, with candour, but I trust without offence, that many of my recent correspondents have had neither length of time, nor favourable opportunities, in Malaya, sufficient to warrant the formation of their very definitely expressed opinions.\n\nI am told by all who have written to me that numbers of Chinese in the Straits are imitative Latahs. I am indeed told by one writer that such cases are \"numberless.\"\n\nIt could hardly have escaped my notice that there are many Chinese in this country who imitate the words and gestures of others. But this is true of many people in all countries.\nIt is true of some monkeys * and of a large proportion of vulgar children. \u2020\n\nBut I repeat that, after careful observation, I have not met with any Chinaman in the Straits whom I should describe as Latah.\n\nMy remarks upon this section of my former paper were, no doubt, crude and unsatisfactory. But I remember saying that this division of Latah subjects must not be roughly described as \"village idiots.\"\n\nNow, I should baldly describe all the Chinese in whom I have noticed this propensity as distinctly microcephalic.\n\nIn two very marked cases which have come under my notice in the last three years, and which, for some time, perplexed me in this very connection, one patient has died insane in the charge of his friends in Penang, and the other is now an inmate of the Lunatic Asylum in Singapore. I can say, with confidence, that these two are the only instances I have met in which I have had any doubt as to the absence of Latah amongst the Chinese.\n\nThat this imitative propensity is common both as the precursor and the accompaniment of certain forms of mental disorder, is well known.\n\n\"In certain morbid states of the brain,\" says Dr. Bateman in his work on Aphasia,\u2021 \"this tendency is exaggerated to an extraordinary degree: some hemiplegic patients and others, at the commencement of inflammatory softening of the brain, unconsciously \u00a7 imitate every word which is uttered, whether in their own or a foreign language, and every gesture or action which is performed near them.\"||\n\n* Noticeably Cercopithecus.\n\u2020 Those who read my former paper will be prepared to hear that I deny the existence of Latah before pubescence, while I admit, as an inexplicable fact, that, where present, it is persistent in both sexes long after the powers of reproduction are extinct, and, in the case of women, as a rule, ends only with life itself.\n\u2021 Ed. 1870, p. 110.\n\u00a7 There is no unconsciousness, mesmeric or idiotic, in the actions of a Latah.\n|| Similarly vide Vogt's \"M\u00e9moire sur les Microc\u00e9pales\" passim, especially p. 169, Ed. 1867.\nI cannot speak from experience of the ultimate fate of any Latah of the imitative class. But I can say confidently that the exhibition of this peculiarity is unaccompanied by any other mental irregularity, except those which I have attempted to describe as pertaining to Latah. And in those cases which I have had the opportunity of observing for any length of time, I have satisfied myself that the malady is not progressive.\n\nFurther, I have seen many oldish men thus Latah who, according to the testimony of their elders, have been so afflicted from the age of puberty.\n\nAnd lastly, I have never heard an \"orang latah\" called an \"orang gila.\" Nor have I ever heard any man say of one so diseased, \"He will become mad,\" or \"He will die.\"\n\nFor these and other reasons, apart from my own theory on the subject, I am led to believe that this propensity in Latahs is an anomaly, distinct from a not uncommon mental disease in other parts of the world, to which it bears some superficial resemblance.\n\nAnd, until proof is given to the contrary, I rest content with my belief that the peculiarity is one in which the Chinese have no share.\n\nIt must be, at all times, dangerous for the unscientific to argue from apparent similarities, the causes of which must be hidden from them.\n\nAs I have written as a non-scientist, I must add that I am quite alive to the parallel danger I am running in pointing out differences which stand merely upon the basis of my own unlearned and limited observation.\n\nWhat Latah really is, it remains for some future pathologist to say. But until \"the man has spoken with authority,\" I trust that no half formed and rash generalization will be suffered to class the imitative Malay with the microcephalic idiot; our snake seer with the victim of alcohol; the rarely found Malay girl-sufferer with the ordinary nympho-maniac; in a word, the unexplained Latah with the Lunatic, whose mental disorders have now formed the subject of the specialist's investigations for several generations.\n\nH. A. O'BRIEN.\nNEW MOUNTAIN SEEN IN PERAK.\n\nOn a spur of the G\u00fbnong Bubu Range, which lies a short distance inland from the coast of P\u00earak, in Latitude 4\u00b0 35' N. and Longitude 100\u00b0 50' E., the Government of P\u00earak has opened an experimental plantation at an elevation of 3,200 feet on a hill named G\u00fbnong \u00c2rang Para. The bungalow on this hill is named \"The Hermitage,\" and from that spot I saw, on the morning of the 15th instant, a very lofty mountain, not previously discerned from this point, though a European (Mr. Bozzolo) has been living on the hill for more than 18 months.\n\nOn the night of the 14th there was a thunderstorm with heavy rain, and when the morning of the 15th broke, the mountain ranges could be seen to an immense distance with great clearness.\n\nLooking in an easterly direction across the valley of the P\u00earak River towards the succession of ranges, which must lie near the junction of P\u00earak, K\u00eblantan and Pahang, I noticed what appeared to be a lofty mountain with a filmy cloud on its southern slope.\n\nMr. Bozzolo, who was with me, thought there was no mountain, only a cloud, but fortunately we had a powerful telescope and binoculars and with their assistance an exceedingly lofty mountain was distinctly visible at a distance that I guess to have been about sixty miles. I immediately took the bearing of this mountain and found it to be 102\u00b0, i.e., about 12\u00b0 South of East. The mountain has a wide uneven top with steep sides, which rose from a thick bank of white cloud and through this cloud appeared three or four black spots, evidently the rocky points of another lower and nearer mountain or range, while the cloud shewed there was a great distance between them and the more distant and far more lofty mountain which first attracted my attention.\n\nAt a rough guess, this mountain looked to me as if it might be 11,000 feet or 12,000 feet high, perhaps even more, for within a radius of 25 miles there were many peaks between 6,000 feet and 7,000 feet to judge by.\n\nWithin a very few minutes of first sighting the mountain it was no longer visible, and even the cloud seemed to have merged in the haze of the horizon, making it difficult to believe that we had really\nseen there a far more imposing height than any I have yet beheld in the Peninsula.\n\nAll the other peaks and ranges were still wonderfully clear and I immediately made a sketch of all I could see from the Plus Valley to the limit of vision in the South.\n\nThinking this sketch would interest the Straits Asiatic Society, I have had a tracing made which I now enclose.*\n\nThe tracing is not so successful as I had hoped it might be, but still it gives an idea of the mountain ranges as I saw them, and I trust I may yet be able to furnish you with some further and better information regarding this considerable mountain which lies in the direction of the mountain marked on the Asiatic Society's map as G\u00fbnong Tahan, though that would appear to be more than 100 miles distant from G\u00fbnong Bubu.\n\nThe point in that range called on the Society's map \"Bukit Chai\" is about the position of G\u00fbnong \u00c2rang Para.\n\nThe outline of the range which divides the P\u00earak from the Kinta River (the highest point of which is G\u00fbnong M\u00earu) has been made, in the tracing I enclose, rather darker than that of the more distant ranges.\n\nThe highest ground between the Plus and Kinta valleys is not more than 300 feet, and this is imperceptible from \"The Hermitage,\" so that the Kinta valley appears to come round the back of the M\u00earu range into the Plus valley.\n\nThe range of hills which divides the head waters of those rivers which drain into the Plus valley, and ultimately into the P\u00earak River, is not very distant from the East Coast of the Peninsula and an officer of this Government (Mr. Caulfield), who did not get nearly to the sources of these rivers, told me he had seen the waters of the China Sea from the point he did reach, this feeder of the P\u00earak River stretching far to the West and North, and taking its rise in a very lofty range of mountains well within sight of the East Coast of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nF.

But what we know on this subject amounts to very little and is little more than what travellers have said of most wild tribes. The muscular strength of the Mincopies is much greater than would be supposed from their short stature and rounded limbs. Like the Aetas, they are remarkable for their extreme agility and the acuteness of their senses. Both\nparticulars gathered by a few travellers, which unfortunately come to very little.\n\nOf all the languages spoken by Negritos the most interesting to study would unquestionably be that of the Mincopies. Owing to the almost complete isolation in which these islanders have lived, especially in the Great Andaman group, their dialects can only have been altered through natural evolution and independently of foreign influence. This language goes back certainly to remote antiquity and has probably preceded those now spoken in Malacca, Siam and in India itself. The study of it would consequently be of the greatest interest, as well from an ethnological as from a linguistical point of view.\n\nMr. E. H. Man seems to have understood it so. Before him, Symes, Colebrooke, R\u00f6epstorff, Tickel, &c., had confined themselves to gathering short vocabularies. Brought into daily communication with the natives, in the course of his official duties, Mr. Man learned their languages. He translated in one of them the Lord's Prayer, which was published with a commentary\n\nraces are able to bear long fasting and also to consume at one meal a prodigious quantity of food. The Mincopies, who alone seem to have been studied at all from a pathological point of view, suffer mostly from diseases contracted from the habit, to which I shall refer hereafter, of clothing themselves, so to speak, with mud. Pulmonary consumption did not exist in the Andamans, but a few natives who came to European settlements were very soon afflicted with it. This would tend to confirm what I have repeatedly said, namely that we ourselves have imported the disease into various parts of the world where it was unknown before. (Les Polyn\u00e9siens et leurs Migrations et Journal des Savants, 1873.) M. Montano found, in one single Manthra family, two individuals afflicted one with the rickets, the other with epilepsy. (Quelques jours chez les indig\u00e8nes de la province de Malacca; Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 46.) This he appears to consider as a general rule and what he saw seemed to him to show how a race dies out. But the groups seen by M. Montano must be the exception. Logan, at all events, mentions nothing of the kind and appears, on the contrary, to assign to these populations a vitality capable of resisting the unfavourable conditions to which conquest has subjected them. (The Binua of Johore; The Journal of the Indian Archipelago, Vol. I, passim).\n\n(1) In my first \u00c9tude sur les Mincopies et la Race N\u00e9grito en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, I have mentioned the fact that signs of cross-breeding have been found in Little Andaman, south of the other islands. (Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. I, p. 213.)\n\n(2) I have borrowed from these various writers some of the examples which seemed most suited to show clearly the variety of Mincopic dialects, first pointed to by Mr. Francis Day.

(1) Colonel Lane Fox, in two different papers, has given this translation, (2) and summed up, though rather too briefly, the general conclusions of the authors. (3) Thinking that it may be useful to readers, engaged in the study of languages, I transcribe hereunder (4) the document which was the starting point of this investigation.\n\nThe study of the vocabularies to which I have just called attention had led Latham to admit of a certain connection between the Mincopie and Burmese languages. (5) M. Pruner-Bey has pointed out a few common traits in the Mincopie and New Caledonian dialects. (6) Hyde Clarke has fancied that he could discover in the Andamanese language affinities with those of several races of Asia, Africa and the two Americas. (7) Messrs. Man and Temple begin by stating that the nine tribes which figure on the map prepared by one of these authors, (8) have each a private language. \"A\n\n---\n\n(1) The Lord's Prayer translated into B\u00f3jing'jida by E.

H. Man, Esq., (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, p. 105.) The Lord's Prayer was translated into the language spoken by the tribe inhabiting the southern island of Great Andaman, where Fort Blair, the English Settlement, is situated.\nnative of North Andaman is as utterly unable to make himself understood by a native of South Andaman, as an English peasant would be by a Russian.\" It is not, therefore, a question of simple dialects, but in reality of distinct languages. Yet these languages have a common origin and structure; they are all agglutinative. Should they have any affinities with others, which Messrs. Man and Temple consider as doubtful, it might be with the languages of Australia or of the Dravidian and Scythian groups, which they resemble in a few peculiarities, such as the use of post-positions instead of prepositions; the use of two forms\u2014one inclusive, the other exclusive\u2014for the first person of the plural, and, in general, in the agglutinative structure of words. Reading over these few sentences one is naturally reminded of the connection already noted by philologists among others by our eminent colleague, Mr. Maury, as existing between the Dravidian and Australian languages. (1) To these Messrs. Man and Temple add a third philological group which has probably preceded the two others. Everything in fact tends more and more to prove that the Negrito race, of which the Mincopies are the purest representatives, is the fundamental negro element of all or very nearly all the Dravidian tribes and of those who, though not speaking a language classified under that name, resemble them in physical characteristics. (2) If this is really the case, are we not entitled to believe that the substratum of this linguistic family will be found in the Mincopie languages? At all events, it is an interesting problem to solve, and we heartily wish that Messrs. Man and Temple may pursue researches which have already led them to such curious results.\n\nThough scattered from the Andaman Islands to the Philippines, the Negrito tribes have retained, in a remarkable manner, all their exterior and osteological characteristics. It is otherwise with re-\n\n(1) La Terre et l'Homme, 3me \u00e9dition, p. 504.) M. Maury is moreover inclined to connect these two groups of languages with the Medo-Scythian, which was probably spoken, he says, by the native tribes of Media and Susiana.\n\n(2) I have dwelt on this question in a paper in the Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I.\ngard to language. This has in some instances completely disappeared, through contact with superior populations, even where Negrito groups, numerically strong and enjoying a certain independence, have preserved a comparative purity of blood.\n\nThis fact had been observed in the Philippines, from the earliest period of the Spanish occupation. Even in the island named after them, these diminutive negroes spoke Bisaya, one of the local Malay dialects, (1) to which however they added a great number of foreign words. It seems to me probable that these latter were so many surviving witnesses of the primitive language.\n\nStill more must this have been the case in Luzon. The evidence given on this point by De la Fuente, (2) has lately been fully confirmed by the researches of Dr. Montano, who has kindly placed his unpublished notes at my disposal with a liberality for which I am happy to be able to thank him here. This traveller, who speaks Malay fluently and is acquainted with several of its dialects, was able to detect, in the Aeta language, not only grammatical forms, but even a vocabulary, almost exclusively Tagalog. One by one, he verified one hundred and four words collected by Mr. Meyer in the dialect of the Mariveles. He noted down those which seemed to be foreign to the Malay languages and could find but seventeen. He is still unable to speak decidedly about some of these. (3)\n\n(1) \"La lingua dell'Isola detta de' Negri e la Bissaya stessa col miscuglio di moltissime parole forestiere.\" (L'Abb\u00e9 Torres, quoted by Prichard, Researches into the Physical History of Mankind, Vol. V, p. 221.)\n\n(2) Quoted by Prichard, loc. cit.\n\n(3) M. Montano found moreover in the same vocabulary, translated into the Negrito dialect of Zambales, thirteen words which are not Malay. He also obtained, not without some trouble, from an Aeta, the following verse of a song:\n\nMakaalis ako ina,\nI am going (oh my) friend\nmakpakla bai, ku ina\nBe very prudent thou, friend\nTa! ma papaku sayou, ako ina,\nAh! I am going very far my friend,\nInto ka man a bibing ianmo.\nwhile you stop in dwelling yours.\nHanag banuan dolipatan mo.\nNever (your) village will be forgotten (by) me.\nM. Montano was unable to procure equally accurate information with regard to the language of the Mamanuas, or Negritos of Mindanao. But these people could make themselves understood by his guides who spoke to them a kind of corrupted or rather simplified Bisaya. (1) There also, no doubt, the primitive language has more or less died out.\n\nHas it been the same in the Malay Peninsula? M. Montano, does not think he can yet answer the question. He easily understood his Manthra (2) guide, when the latter spoke Malay to him; but he could catch but very few words when the same individual conversed with his wild countrymen. He is satisfied that the Manthras have a peculiar accent which may arise from various causes. Father Pougret, who has lived for a long time in Malacca and visited all the inland tribes, told M. Montano that these wild people had no special language or dialect of their own, and that they spoke a mixture of corrupted Malay and Siamese. However, in his curious work on the Binuas of Johore, (3) Logan regards it as certain that these people, though evidently more freely crossed with Malay blood than the Manthras, have had, in former times, a language of their own; and he brings forward numerous arguments in support of his opinion. (4) In the peculiar language, which they speak when searching for camphor trees (5) amid their forests, the same author has detected a certain number of words foreign to Malay. I have compared several of these with words in two\n\n---\n\nThe Negritos of the Albay province (South-east of Luzon) speak Bicol fluently. But they are crossed with Malays.

The Russian traveller Miklucho-Maclay had previously gathered, among the wild tribes of Johore and further inland, one hundred and seventy words, (3) which several Malays, on being consulted, declared were perfectly unknown to them. Lastly Mr. de Castelnau had also arrived independently at analogous conclusions. (4) From this aggregate of facts, it seems to me to result that the original Negritos of the Malay Peninsula must have had a language of their own, which has been almost completely forgotten by a portion of their descendants and a little less so perhaps by others, because they are all more or less crossed with Malays, no doubt with Siamese also, and probably with other ethnological elements still undetermined. Was this language connected in any way with that of the Minopies? This is but an hypothesis, but the comparative proximity of the two races allows us at all events to put the question. Messrs. Man and Temple will perhaps one day tell us how much truth there may be in this conjecture. (5) They may also suc-\n\n---\n\n(1) Elements of Comparative Philology, p. 51.\n(2) Perak is situated about 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 North of Malacca towards the middle of the western coast of the Peninsula.

From Johore in the south of the Peninsula to Ligor in the south of Siam, the Russian traveller has ascertained the identity of language among tribes which are isolated and have no communication with each other. This result seems to have struck him with astonishment. There is, however, nothing in it which will not seem quite natural to any one who studies the history of Negritos taken as a whole.\n(4) Revue de Philologie, 1876. [I am indebted to M. Montano for this reference.]\n(5) It would, I think, be most interesting, with reference to this enquiry, to find out what language is spoken by the Negritos who have recently been discovered in the small archipelago of Tenasserim. Their comparative isolation might encourage a hope that their primitive language has been less altered than on the continent.\nceed in finding out whether there is anything solid in the singular affinities pointed to by Mr. Hyde Clarke, between the various Mincopie languages and certain African and American idioms. (1) Lastly it would be of some interest to investigate whether the language of the Puttouas of the Amarkantak mountains, which is perfectly different from any Dravidian dialect of the neighbourhood, (2) would seem to be at all connected with those spoken in the Andaman Islands or Malay Peninsula.\n\nSocial State.\u2014The Mincopies depend exclusively for their existence on hunting and fishing and have no permanent homes. Living on the shores of a sea in which fish is remarkably abundant, within immediate reach of dense forests where pigs are very numerous, and honey and fruits plentiful, they have not felt the want of claiming from the soil a supplement of food, and this very state of comfort has, in itself, kept them down on the lowest rung of the social ladder. (3)\n\nMost travellers, who have visited the Philippine Islands, have spoken of the Aetas as having never got past this step, though placed in much less favourable conditions. La Gironni\u00e8re, (4) and Meyer are very positive on this point, (5) and M. Giglioli has unreservedly accepted what they say on the subject. (6) Rienzi himself, to whom we are indebted for information as to the more happy past of these people, represents them as living nowadays exclusively on wild fruits and the proceeds of fishing and hunting. (7)\n\n---\n\n(1) Note on the Languages of the Andamans (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. IV, p. 467.)\n(2) Rousselet, Tableau des Races de l'Inde Centrale (Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. II, p. 282.)\n(3) Mr. Francis Day informs us that a very small Mincopie tribe, stationed close to the British Settlements and receiving daily rations, bagged, in one year, 500 wild-boars, 150 turtles, 20 wild cats, 50 iguanas and 6 dugongs (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1879, p. 153.)\n(4) Vingt Ann\u00e9es aux Philippines, p. 303.\n(5) Die Philippinen und ihre Bewohner, M.\n(6) Studi sulla Raza Negrita (Archivio per l'Antropologia, Vol. V, p. 293, and Viaggio della Pirocorvetta Magenta, p. 245.)\n(7) Oc\u00e9anie, Vol. I, p. 301.\nBut it is evident that in the Philippines, this degraded social status is the consequence of the persecution which these Negritos have suffered at the hands of more powerful and vigorous races. No doubt also, the interestedly false statements made to travellers by the petty chiefs of Tagal villages, (1) have led to the admission, as general, of a state of things which is, perhaps, more or less exceptional. In reply to these exaggerations, I cannot do better than copy almost verbally M. Montano's own words:\u2014\n\n\"The Negritos of the Bataan province seemed to value fully the security afforded to them by the just and enlightened administration of the Governor, Don Estanislao Chaves. I have visited them in their own mountains......The house of the chief, very clean indeed, was situated on an eminence surrounded by other small hills. Several huts had been erected, every one of them in the centre of a clearing of a few acres planted with banana-trees, rice, sugar-cane and, above all, sweet potatoes....... The chief shouted, and immediately the shouts were repeated near and far. Before long the whole tribe had gathered round me ....... In the province of Albay, where the conditions of life must be similar to those which exist in Bataan, I have seen a considerable quantity of cacao that had been gathered by the Negritos inhabiting the islands of the bay.\"\n\nEven among the Mamanouas (2) of Mindanao, of whom the last survivors are constantly being hunted down by the ferocious Manobros, the French traveller saw on the eastern shore of Lake Mainit, \"a timid tribe, very distrustful, who had nevertheless cleared a space in the jungle, erected huts, and planted banana-trees and sweet potatoes.\"\n\nThus, all that has been said about the indomitable roving instincts of Aetas is thoroughly inaccurate. If, in certain parts of the Archipelago, these diminutive negroes lead a wandering life, if they do not build huts or till the soil, the fault lies with those who persecute and victimize them. The method of cultivation just\n\n(1) MS. note of M. Montano.\n(2) Name given to Negritos in Mindanao. (Montano).\nmentioned, very primitive by the way, is to be seen among the half-breed Negritos of India and the Malay Peninsula. All of them seem to proceed in the same way. The Gond, like the Manthra, begins by felling the trees which he burns when half dried up. In the entanglement of trunks and branches, he then sows or plants rice, potatoes, &c. When the jungle shoots up again, he abandons his frail and leaf-covered hut and proceeds elsewhere to begin over again. A dog, a few fowls and pigs live as best they can in these primitive clearings. What they can get by fishing and hunting, together with edible roots and jungle fruits, seem to form the principal resources of these people. (1)\n\nSuch is the present state of things. But have not these tribes, now half-nomad and scattered, known better days and enjoyed a more perfect social organization? It is not easy to give a general answer to this question.\n\nAs far as regards the Mincopies, nothing indicates that they ever rose above what we know them to be now-a-days. Having, so to speak, under their hand, all that can satisfy the simple wants of a wild man, and without intercourse with foreigners, they have received nothing that could awaken new aspirations in them, and their intellectual activity has been applied solely to multiplying or improving the implements required by their mode of life. We shall see further on that they have, in that line, evinced real initiative power.\n\nIt is more than probable that in the Philippines, the Aetas were once in a more advanced stage. Rienzi, whose summary of the traditions of these people is unfortunately rather confused, represents them as having in by-gone days occupied the whole of Luzon and having for a long while resisted the Tagal invasions. (2) They had, in those times, a form of government. An assembly of chiefs and elders superintended the execution of the laws. (3) It is difficult to admit that, at that period, cultivation of the soil was not\n\n(1) Notes (unpublished) of M. Montano; Rousselet, loc. cit. p. 276; Logan, loc. cit. p. 255; etc.\n(2) Oc\u00e9anie, Vol. I, p. 301.\n(3) This is precisely what is still the custom among the Bhils, half-bred Negritos. (Rousselet, loc. cit. p. 61).\npractised at least in the same degree as that described by M. Montano.\n\nWith still more reason must it have been the same with the more or less mixed tribes of Malacca. M. Montano informs us that the Manthras have still preserved a recollection of the days when their ancestors ruled over the whole country. At that time, they say, they had numerous records written on leaves. This fact implies in itself a social state of which M. Montano seems to have found traces in the very name of his guide. He was called, as his father, grandfather, and, no doubt, his ancestors had been, Panglima dalam, which the traveller translates as \"the lord who administers the Sultan's palace.\" (1) This descendant of some great dignitary is now but a simple coolie in a Chinese plantation. In the Malay Peninsula, as in India, conquest has destroyed States that were considerable and flourishing once upon a time, but of which even recollection has been lost, driving back to the jungles and mountains the races, more or less Negro\u00efd, which had founded them. There the race, like many other Dravidian (2) groups, has returned to a wild life. It has been broken up and divided into tribes and small communities, (3) and the hierarchy of chiefs, recorded by Logan as existing among the Bermun populations, is probably all that is left of its former social state. (4)\n\n(1) Montano. Quelques jours chez les indig\u00e8nes de la province de Malacca. (Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 48).\n\n(2) The Bhils among others: however, they still have permanent homes, well built houses grouped in villages. What may be considered as a supposition with regard to some of the Bermun tribes would seem to be well ascertained with respect to their brethren the Binuas. Logan informs us that the latter were in former times governed by kings, the origin of whom was supposed to be supernatural and whose descendants are still to be found. (Logan, loc. cit. p. 279).\n\n(3) Montano, loc. cit. p. 46.\n\n(4) In his Memoir on the Binuas of Johore, Logan gives particulars concerning five tribes to which all that I say here specially applies; they are the Uda\u00efs or Orang-Pagos, the Jakuns, the Saka\u00efs, the Mintiras or Manthras and the Besisis. These tribes inhabit the mountainous region of Gunong Bermun, one of the highest ranges in the Malay Peninsula. Among the Manthras, there exist head-men (Batin) whose jurisdiction extends over well defined districts. Each Batin has under him a Jinang, a Jukra or Jorokra, and an indefinite number of Panglimas and Ulubalangs. On the death of a\nAmong Negritos, everywhere the family seems to have survived the general decline of the race. A Sepoy deserter whose assertions have been too easily accepted by some writers, represented it as rather loosely constituted in the Andaman islands. Information gathered by Lieutenant St. John (1) and particularly by Mr. Day, (2) has corrected what was erroneous in these early reports. The Mincopies are monogamous. Marriage only takes place with the consent of the guardian of the maidens, who sanctions the union of the pair by joining their hands together. The duties of man and wife are reciprocal, and the parents evince the most tender affection for their offspring. (3) In the Philippine Islands, La Girondi\u00e8re ascertained analogous facts, even among the wretched and savage tribe which he visited. \"The Aetas,\" says he, \"are faithful in wedlock and have but one wife.\" When a young man has made his choice, he applies to the parents, who never refuse their consent, but send the girl into the forest where she hides herself before daybreak. The young man has to find her, and, if he does not succeed, has to relinquish all claim. (4) It is evident that the decision really depends on the young girl.\n\nM. Montano's notes confirm and complete the information given by La Girondi\u00e8re. He moreover acquaints us with the curious ceremony which ratifies wedlock among the Aetas of Luzon. The young couple climb up two flexible trees which an old man bends down towards each other. When the head of the bridegroom touches that of the young woman the marriage is pronounced legal and is followed by a big feast and war dances.\n\nI also borrow from the same traveller the following interesting particulars relating to the Negritos of Mindanao.\n\n\"Among the miserable Mamauas, those ancient owners of the\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit. p. 245.\n(2) Loc. cit. p. 160.\n(3) Mouat, Adventures and Researches among the Andaman Islanders, p. 295.\n(4) Loc. cit. p. 302.\nland, (1) who are described as so degraded, I have found the\nsame habits as among the Negritos of Marivel\u00e8s; I have witnessed\nthe same veneration for old men, the same love for children, the\nsame respect for the dead. Among this tribe, which is fast dying\nout, the old customs have preserved an unabated influence. These\ncustoms are simple indeed, and the procedure elementary, but\nthey do exist. It must not be supposed that a Mamanua can act\nas he likes in his own hut without having an account to give to\nanyone.\n\nAn unfaithful wife may be killed by her husband, but not\nunless the adultery be proved, in which case the relations of the\nguilty woman assent to her death.

The young girls are\nvery modest in their demeanour. The slightest suspicion on that\nscore would be an obstacle to their finding a husband.\n\nA Negrito does not buy his wife, he simply makes a small\npresent to his future father-in-law, who generally gives his\ndaughter a dowry equivalent to what he has thus received.\n\nPrivate property is well recognised and can be transmitted by\nsale or inheritance.

He has, however, but\nseldom to interfere.\n\n(1) Banna \"land\"; ba possessive prefix. (Montano.)\nWe must acknowledge that there is a great discrepancy between this state of things, as described by M. Montano, and the information given by his predecessors. This is one more instance, to be added to many others, of the imprudence of limiting oneself to superficial observation when it is a question of forming an opinion of these backward and wild populations.\n\nIn spite of their intermixture with alien races, the Negritos of Malacca would, no doubt, if better known, exhibit similar social characteristics. M. Montano tells us that they never go to war, (1) that parents attend most tenderly on their offspring, and, if necessary, will, for their sake, deprive themselves of food. Logan informs us that, among the Manthras, adultery is punished with death, but not unless, as among the Mamanuas, the crime be proved by witnesses. The sentence is passed by the head chief (Batin) and carried out by the Panglima. The two culprits are laid down in the nearest stream and their heads are kept under water by the means of a fork. A man who is convinced of his wife's misconduct, but who has no actual proof of it, can leave her on condition of giving up to her his house and fields, a certain amount of cotton stuff, a few rings, and a small sum of money. The children remain with their mother, but she cannot re-marry until her divorced husband has taken to himself another wife. (2)\n\nIndustry.\u2014I have already mentioned how the various Negrito populations support themselves. I must add that none of those of whom I speak here are cannibals.

(The Binua of Johore, p 273.)\n\n(2) Loc. cit, p. 268\n\n(3) I must remark here that this paper is exclusively devoted to the study of the Negritos proper. As for the Papua-Negritos, mixed with the Papuas of New-Guinea and the adjacent island-groups, it is very possible that they may have let themselves be carried away by example and may have addicted themselves to man-eating; but it is impossible, for want of accurate information, to give an opinion on the subject. The confusion which has too long existed concerning these two races and which is still more or less kept up by some of the most recent travellers, makes it very difficult to study them independently of each other. The examination of skulls permits of our distinguishing the two races, but throws no light on the various characteristics which divide them in other respects.\nbrought against several of these tribes, particularly against the Mincopies. Now, far from having any liking for human flesh, the Andamanese look upon it as a deadly poison. (1)\n\nAll Negritos cook meat by boiling or roasting; all consequently are able to procure fire and no doubt use the same process, the friction of two pieces of wood. This is an uncertain and laborious task, even for savages, and therefore when the first spark is procured, they devise means to preserve it. The Mincopies have invented a peculiar method of their own: \"The large trees are charred in the interior: a great hollow is formed in the centre in which they allow about three feet of ashes to accumulate, under which fire is always found\u2014over the fire of these strange ovens the Mincopic can grill his little pig, fry his fish and prepare his turtle soup.\" (2) Among the Manthras the charred tree is replaced by a heap of clay enclosed in a wooden frame in which fire is carefully kept up. (3) In cold or temperate climates the most urgent wants, after food, are shelter and clothing. In tropical countries, on the contrary, clothes are a matter of luxury and are often more inconvenient than useful. It is almost the same with regard to dwellings. A simple cover, affording shade during the day, shelter from the moon's rays at night, and protection from rain, answers all the most important purposes. Travellers are but too often unmindful of these circumstances, and many writers look upon this extreme simplicity of dress or houses, as a sign of intellectual inferiority and want of industry. The Mincopies have been reproached with wearing no clothes. It is a fact; with the exception of a girdle to which I shall refer further on, their dress is limited to uncouth tattooing or painting such as we see in Mr. Dobson's phototypes. (4) Still, in order to protect themselves against mosquitos or other insects, they are in the habit, when night comes on, of smearing the body with a thick coating of\n\n(1) Day, loc. cit. p. 165.\n(2) Mouat, Adventures, p. 308.\n(3) Montano, loc. cit. p. 46.\n(4) On the Andamans and Andamanese.

They can thus sleep in peace; but it is obvious that this night-dress goes a long way towards developing the rheumatic and abdominal diseases to which they are particularly subject.\n\nPerpetually wandering as they do, along their shores, the Andamanese are not given to erecting permanent dwellings. Four poles secured together at the upper ends and covered with broad leaves give them a perfect hut, which is quickly erected and affords capital shelter against rain\u2014the only thing they seem to dread. Such a hut is in reality a kind of impervious tent, the materials of which are entirely supplied by the neighbouring jungle, and which need not be transported from place to place. They could not possibly have contrived anything better, and our own African soldiers would deem themselves lucky, could they but do the same.\n\nThe Aetas are scarcely better clad than their Andamanese brethren. (1) Further, such of their tribes as are subject to the continual attacks of formidable enemies do not even erect temporary sheds, but sleep in trees, or, as a protection against cold, roll themselves up in the hot ashes of a large fire kindled for the purpose. But we have seen already that, when placed in normal conditions of life, they know how to erect permanent houses and settle down.\n\nThe photographs of M. de Saint Pol-Lias represent the Saka\u00efs as wearing a simple waist cloth tied round the waist with the ends hanging down on the thighs. M. Montano has described the bamboo hut of a Manthra family whom he met living by themselves in the midst of the forest. (2) Though anything but luxurious, this dwelling exhibited the peculiarity of having a floor raised two feet off the ground. In almost all of the houses of our own peasants the bare earth is the substitute for plank floors and in this respect at all events the Malay savage understands hygienic conditions better than the European.\n\n(1) A portrait of an Aeta chief, engraved after a photograph by M. Montano has been given by me in a memoir called\u2014Nouvelles \u00c9tudes sur la distribution g\u00e9ographique des N\u00e9gritos et sur leur identification avec les Pygm\u00e9es asiatiques de Ctesias et de Pline. (Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 183).\n\n(2) Loc. cit p. 46.\nThe Mincopies live exclusively on hunting and fishing, but owing to their isolation and also to the fables that have been spread concerning some of their habits, (1) they have been free to develop quietly the various industries suited to their mode of life. The results attained by these islanders had already forcibly struck the learned observers who were the first in our time to study the Andamans and their inhabitants. Notwithstanding their contempt for these \"savage negroes,\" Colebrooke, Symes, and especially Mouat have in many instances done justice to their merits in this respect. (2) Thanks to Mr. Man, we are now better acquainted with them. He got together and sent to London a valuable collection illustrating most of the native industries, and of this Major-General Lane-Fox (3) has given an account as interesting as it is instructive. I can only very briefly sum up these various documents.\n\nLet us notice first of all that the Andaman Islands, where iron seems to have been introduced by the Chinese and Nicobarese, have had their stone age, the remains of which are still to be found in kiekkenmaaddings, entirely similar to those of Denmark. These heaps of \"kitchen refuse\" were discovered by M. de Roepstorff (4) and more closely examined by Dr. Stoliczka. (5) Hammers and knives were found in them together with rude hatchets undoubtedly corresponding with the chipped implements of our stone age. Close to these were discovered a polished axe which Stoliczka declares to be identical with the \"celts\" of the neolithic period, and also a real chisel, three inches long, with a sharp edge at one\n\n---\n\n(1) In a paper specially devoted to the Mincopies, I have recorded some of the fables borrowed from Marco-Polo and Arab writers\u2014(Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. I, p. 40).\n(2) I must here refer the reader to my first paper, already quoted.\n(3) Observations on Mr. Man's Collection of Andamanese and Nicobarese Objects, by Major-General Lane-Fox, F. R. S., with four plates. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, p. 434).\n(4) A Short List of Andamanese Test Words. (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 178). The Kiekkenmaadding discovered near Hope Town was about 60 feet in circumference and 12 feet high. Several of such and even larger heaps are to be found in various parts of Chatham Island.\n(5) Note on the Kiekkenmaaddings of the Andaman Islands. (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 13).\nNumerous fragments of sun-baked pottery, decorated with incisions of irregular designs, (1) were found in the same place. The Mincopies still manufacture pots of the same kind, and if they have not yet attained the art of baking pottery in a kiln, this is due, no doubt, to the facility with which they can replace water vessels by a length of bamboo, and cooking utensils by the large shells of the Tridaena and Turbo.\n\nWith the exception of harpoons exclusively used for fishing, the bow is, according to the latest travellers, the only weapon employed in hunting or warfare. (2) The bow used in Little Andaman is very similar to most others, being straight and symmetrically tapered from the middle to the ends. (3) In the Great Andaman, on the contrary, it assumes a peculiar shape. In the middle there is a kind of cylindrical handle of a comparatively small diameter; the two sides, rather wide at first, are flat inside with a convex back; they get thinner towards the extremities and are curved in opposite way so that the whole reminds one of an elongated S. This bow is from $1m75$ to $2m$ in length. (4) It is very hard to bend, and the strongest English sailors were unable to string it. (5) In spite of their small stature and rounded limbs, the Mincopies used it so skillfully and with such power that, at 40 or 50 metres, the arrows penetrated right through the clothes of Europeans and deep into the flesh. Several varieties of arrows are used, among which there is one which might be styled a hunting harpoon. The head of it, to which the point is attached, is very small, whilst the shaft is $1m$ long. The two parts are brought together by means of a strong cord twisted round so as to keep the two independent portions together. When a pig is struck and tries to escape headlong through the jungle, the cord unrolls itself, the barbed point of the\n\n---\n\n(1) Plate XVI of General Lane-Fox's Note represents several of these designs.\n\n(2) Symes alone has mentioned long spears and shields made of bark.\n\n(3) Lane-Fox, Pl.

It also resembles the Japanese bow in so far as the ends are not symmetrical. (Loc. cit., p. 440).\narrow remains in the flesh, but the shaft which is dragged after him, keeps on checking the course of the animal which is soon captured.\n\nThe Mincopie canoe has deservedly attracted the attention of the English. It is cut out of the trunk of a tree: outside, it is highly finished; the sides are very thin, and the bottom very thick. Being thus naturally ballasted, it cannot capsize and even when riddled with bullets it does not sink.\n\nThey are propelled by paddles, with marvellous speed. The gig and cutter of the Pluto, manned by picked crews, had a trial with a Mincopie canoe, and were completely beaten; the victory of the savages was owing to the superiority of their workmanship. (1)\n\nIt is useless my dwelling any longer on the various manufactures of these islanders and mentioning their harpoons, nets, &c., Here, again, they prove themselves to be equal, and at times much superior to other races placed in the same conditions of life. The collection made by Mr. Man and the plates which accompany the paper of General Lane-Fox are sufficient to refute all that has been said concerning the intellectual degradation of the Mincopies.\n\nIt is otherwise with regard to the A\u00ebtas, whom persecution keeps in a continual wandering state, and there is nothing surprising in the fact. The only weapons they use in war or hunting expeditions are a short spear, a bow, and one single kind of arrow. But these latter are poisoned, and the slightest wound, if not deadly, causes, at least, long and acute suffering, which La Gironni\u00e8re has described from his own experience. (2)\n\n---\n\n(1) Mouat, Adventures, p. 315.\n(2) La Gironni\u00e8re was wounded in the finger by one of these arrows, in the removal of the skeleton of an A\u00ebta (the first that was sent to Europe and which is now at the Paris Museum). He took no notice of the wound which he took for the scratch of a thorn. After three days, however, the poison began to act, and fearful suffering ensued; the whole arm was inflamed and the pain extended to the chest. After a whole month of torture, the sick man was reduced to the last extremity. He recovered, however, but, for more than a year, he felt pains in the chest. These symptoms recall, in no way, what travellers and experimenters tell us of the effect of known poisons. It would seem as if the poison used by A\u00ebtas was of a special kind. But perhaps also the treatment had something to do with the sufferings of the intrepid traveller.\nPoison is also employed by the Manthras (1) and other Bermun tribes. But these half-bred Negritos, although knowing the use of bows and arrows, have substituted the blow-pipe for them. (2) In this case, as in many others, we can easily detect the influence of the Malays.\n\nThese Malacca Negritos are also acquainted with the art of setting snares for big game, some of them being strong enough to capture even tigers. They place at the end of a long path, artificially made in the jungle, a strong spear fixed to a tree which is bent back and kept in position by the means of a catch. Any animal passing by, releases the spring, and is instantly transfixed. (3) In India, now-a-days, as in the time of Ct\u00e9sias, the bow is, so to speak, the characteristic weapon of the Dravidian races. The Gonds seem to be the only ones who have given it up and taken to the use of the axe and pike. (4)\n\nIV.\n\nReligious and Moral Characteristics.\n\nBelief in Superior Beings.\u2014Like many other wild races, the Negritos, to whom these chapters are specially devoted, have often been represented as perfect atheists. This is anything but accurate. We must not, in our appreciation of their rudimentary beliefs, start from the ideas which educated Europeans form of religion, even when they declare themselves unbelievers.\n\nOn the strength of assertions made by a Sepoy deserter who had lived for some time with the Mincopies, some writers have, even quite recently, taken for granted that these islanders do not believe in any superior being who has any influence, bad or good, on their\n\n---\n\n(1) Montano, loc. cit., p. 47.\n(2) Montano; Logan, loc. cit., p. 272.\n(3) Logan, loc. cit., p. 257.\n(4) Rousselet, Tableau des Races de l'Inde Centrale (Revue d' Anthropologie, Vol. II, p. 276).\ndestiny. They forget the formal evidence given by Symes, which I think right to reproduce textually:\n\n\"Their religion is the simple but genuine homage of nature, expressed in adoration to the sun as the primary and most obvious source of good; to the moon as the secondary power; and to the genii of the woods, the waters and the mountains, as inferior agents. In the spirit of the storms they confess the influence of a malignant being, and during the south-west monsoon, when tempests prevail with unusual violence, they deprecate his wrath by wild chorus, which they chant in small congregations assembled on the beach or some rock that overhangs the ocean.\" (1)\n\nThe late statements furnished by Messrs. St. John and Day have still further confirmed the above account of Colonel Symes.\n\nWhen the question has been more thoroughly studied as in other places, we shall perhaps ascertain the existence of a complete rudimentary mythology among the Mincopies. We know as yet, through Mr. Man, that they have preserved some tradition of a deluge. In the south-east of Middle Andaman, they point out a rock, called Wota-Em\u00e9da, on which the first man made his appearance and engraved the history of the creation. Mr. Man has visited this Mincopie Eden, and has given a description of it. It is an isolated boulder of small proportions, the surface of which is covered with irregular grooves due to the action of the waves and storms. (2) Let us hope that Mr. Man will enter into more detail respecting the fables connected with it. (3)\n\n---\n\n(1) Account of the British Embassy to the Kingdom of Ava, p. 282. Major Symes gives the information furnished to him by Captain Stockoe, who had resided for several years in the Andamans and taken great interest in the natives.\n\n(2) The Andaman Islands. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, pp. 105 and 455).\n\n(3) This paper was originally published in August, 1882. Since then I have read in \"The Journal of the Anthropological Institute,\" (Vol. XII, Nos. I II and III), the very remarkable paper of Mr. Man \"On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands.\" Unfortunately the first number, though bearing the same date as mine, was issued some time after, and I was consequently unable to profit by the valuable and detailed account given in it. However, far from altering my essential conclusions, it fully confirms the opinion which I had always maintained touching the religious feelings.\nWith regard to the A\u00ebtas, our present knowledge is less advanced. M. Montano says in his notes that he could find among them no form of worship; but judging from personal experience, he refrained from concluding that they were wholly destitute of any beliefs whatever. (1) La Gironni\u00e8re, while declaring that these diminutive Negroes have no religion, informs us that, at times, they worship rocks and trunks of trees which seem to bear resemblance to animal beings. (2) My impression is that in all probability, this homage is paid to something higher than these material objects, perhaps to the spirits or genii of the mountains and forests, for Rienzi tells us that these savages believe in evil spirits called Nonos, to whom they offer up sacrifices. (3)\n\nThis belief in spirits is current among the Bermun tribes, and consequently among the Saka\u00efs, Manthras, &c. Here it is professionally represented by a body of priests or rather wizards called\n\nof the Andamanese. Where certain travellers had only seen most wretched savages, where I had myself only suspected confused but genuine notions, we find in reality a pretty complete mythology and a belief in a true God, invisible, immortal and omniscient, by whom the whole world was created and whom they call P\u00fa-luga. I shall quote Mr. Man's own words (No. II, p. 157):\n\n\"Of P\u00fa-luga they say that:\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Though His appearance is like fire, yet He is (now-a-days) invisible.\n\nII.\u2014He was never born and is immortal.\n\nIII.\u2014By Him the world and all objects, animate and inanimate, were created, excepting only the powers of evil.\n\nIV.\u2014He is regarded as omniscient while it is day, knowing even the thoughts of their hearts.\n\nV.\u2014He is angered by the commission of certain sins, while to those in pain or distress he is pitiful, and sometimes deigns to afford relief.\n\nVI.\u2014He is the Judge from whom each soul receives its sentence after death, and, to some extent, the hope of escape from the torments of Jer'eg-l\u00e4r-m\u00e1gu (regarding which anon) is said to affect their course of action in the present life.\n\nThis Jer'eg-l\u00e4r-m\u00e1gu is a kind of hell or purgatory which the Mincopies consider as a cold and icy region.\n\n(1) M. Montano had been told that the Bagobogos had no religion. Owing to favourable circumstances, he was able to recognise among them a well defined and anything but rudimentary religious conception, of which he gave us an outline in one of his addresses to the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie,\" 1877.\n\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 300.\n\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 303.\nPoyang or Pawang. After having given, on this subject, many details, which I need not repeat here, Logan sums up his impressions in the following terms:\u2014\"Among these tribes, we recognise \"a pure Schamamism with its accompanying charms and talismans; \"a living faith fresh from ancient days of Eastern and Middle Asia, \"preserving its pristine vigour and simplicity, .......... untouched \"by the Budhistic deluge .......... and resisting the pressure of the \"Islamism which surrounds it.\" (1)\n\nI hardly need remark that among most Dravidian tribes, even among those who have reached a certain standard of civilization, we can detect, in spite of the influence of different Hindu or Mohamedan sects, a substratum of various beliefs similar to those I have just recorded.\n\nBelief in a future life.\u2014All Negritos believe that the soul survives the body; that it has the same wants as the living, and desires that a regard should be manifested for it. Among the Mincopies it is customary to place a vessel full of water on the grave of the deceased, so that his soul may be able to quench its thirst during the night; a fire is lighted under the stage which bears the body of a chief, in order to prevent his mighty spirit from harming any traveller passing by; the skull and bones, exhumed from the tomb, are worn round the neck as propitiatory to the spirit of the dead; the soul of a stranger is looked upon as harmless, and therefore the body of any one who dies away from his tribe is left unburied. (2)\n\nThe Aetas show great respect to the dead. \"For several \"years,\" says La Gironni\u00e8re, \"they deposit tobacco and betel on \"the tombs. The bow and arrows which belonged to the departed \"are suspended over his grave, on the day of the funeral, and every \"night, according to the belief of his friends, he leaves it and \"goes out hunting.\" (3)\n\n(1) The Binua of Johore. Loc. cit., p. 282.\n(2) The details are borrowed from Mr. Day's memoir. They have all the more weight that the writer gave them \"en passant\" and without having apparently understood their real importance. Observations on the Andamanese, loc. cit. p. 163).\n(3) Vingt ann\u00e9es aux Philippines, p. 301.\nThe Malacca Negritos do not appear to entertain such well defined ideas. Logan states that the Bermun tribes light a fire on the tomb, for several consecutive nights, in order to prevent the spirit from crying out. (1) M. Montano adds that the Manthras bury their dead sufficiently far from the houses, \"so that they shall not be troubled by the crowing of the cocks.\" (2) But neither of these two writers makes any mention of offerings being presented to the spirit of the departed, though among the Manthras the grave is evidently the object of peculiar attentions. (3)\n\nChastity, Modesty.\u2014M. Montano has given us his experience regarding the chastity of the Aeta damsels. The testimony of Symes leaves no room for doubt that this virtue is found among the Andamanese. Two Mincopie girls who had been taken as prisoners on board an English man-of-war, were soon tranquillised in many respects, but though they had been put by themselves in a separate room, they never went to sleep both at the same time, but watched alternately over each other. (4) Not one of the travellers who have visited the Andamans up to the present time has ever reported having witnessed any of those scenes and scandalous sights so often alluded to by the discoverers of the Pacific Archipelagoes. In that respect, the Mincopie women are unquestionably superior to the Polynesians.\n\nWant of decency is the most common of all the accusations which have been brought against a whole host of wild tribes. But we know that travellers have often been mistaken, so far indeed as to take for the height of immodesty what, in the eyes of the natives, was but an elementary act of decency.\n\nOn this particular point, we lack information with regard to most Negrito races. But as to the Andamans, where the dress of the women is as limited as possible, we know now, thanks to Mr. Man,\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 271.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 49.\n(3) Montano, loc. cit., p. 50, and Fig. 52, 53, 54 and 55. [But see Mr. Hervey's description of a Jakun tomb in No. 8 of this Journal.\u2014Ed., Journ. Straits Branch, R. A. S.]\n(4) Loc. cit., p. 243.\nthat such a dress does exist and bears a particular name (1) and that appearing without it is considered as indecent. (2)\n\nThough displayed otherwise than with us, modesty nevertheless exists among the Andamanese.\n\nThe history of a Mincopie, brought over to Europe, shows how much this sentiment is developed among these islanders. When a full length photograph was taken of Jack Andaman and \"he was told to strip, it was by no means an easy matter to prevail upon him to take off his clothes, and, when he was dressed again, \"he manifested much joy at the restoration of his garments. This savage seemed utterly shocked at the very thought of being seen naked.\" (3)\n\nGeneral Character.\u2014It follows, from the various descriptions given above, that the Negritos, who are the special subject of this Part, are far from deserving the accusations which have been too often brought against them.\n\nThe Mincopies who have repeatedly been depicted as horrid cannibals, have been found, when more closely examined, to be spoilt, capricious but good tempered children. (4) Mouat describes them as a gay, laughter-loving population, fond of singing and dancing. Far from being intractable and cruel, they have shown themselves kind and hospitable when fear was banished from their hearts.\n\nThe English traveller adds that they are courageous, hardworking, skilful and extremely active, and, that under the influence of civilization, they would become intelligent and industrious. (5)\n\nM. Montano tells me in his notes: \"Not only are the Negritos anything but ferocious, but they are really humane. They nurse the sick with much devotion, even when they do not belong to their own family.\" He adds again: \"The Manthras are not wanting in brain power but carelessness and laziness\n\n---\n\n(1) B\u00e9d-da.

XV.\n\"seem to prevent them from making any progress.\" (1) At the same time he acknowledges among them the gentle and soft manners to which we have already alluded. In this, he agrees entirely with Logan. The latter, however, considers the Bermun tribes as inconsistent and irritable. They must, says he, be treated as children. (2) St. John uses the very same expression with regard to the Mincopies. It shows once more that these two groups resemble each other, in their moral as well as their physical characteristics. To deny their fundamental ethnical identity is evidently impossible for any one who has at all studied the question.\n\nConclusion.\u2014However incomplete this study may be, the conclusion to be drawn from it seems to me to be obvious and easy to formulate. From nearly unanimous testimony, these races have been considered as occupying one of the last stages in humankind. When attention was originally directed to the Mincopies, some learned men of unquestionable merit, were led to believe that the missing link between the man and the monkey had been found at last. We have now seen that this is not so and that, even where furtherest removed from change and from mixture with other races, the only things which ennoble a community, the Negritos prove to be true and real men in every respect.\n\nPART IV.\n\nTHE NEGRILLOS OR AFRICAN PIGMIES.\n\nI.\n\nThe African dwarfs of whom the Ancients had a glimpse and the very genuine existence of whom has given rise to so many legends, were only discovered again by modern generations at a late period.\n\n(1) Montano, loc. cit. p. 47.\n(2) Loc. cit. p. 269.\nIn 1625, Battel first made known certain facts ascertained by him in the Loango. (1)\n\nAt eight days march to the east of Cape Negro, (2) is found, according to him, the Mani-Kesock territory, to the north-east of which \"lives a race of Pigmies, called Matimbas. Their stature hardly exceeds that of an ordinary boy of twelve, they are all most uncommonly stout. They feed on the flesh of animals which they kill with arrows. They pay to Mani-Kesock a tribute of elephants' tusks and tails. Though their disposition is by no means fierce they absolutely refuse to enter into the houses of the Marambas or receive them in their own towns. The women are as skilful as the men in archery, and are not afraid of penetrating alone into the depth of the woods, with no other protection than their poisoned arrows. (3)\"\n\nWithout mentioning the source of his information, Dapper gives details of the same kind regarding the Mimos or Bakk\u00e9-Bakk\u00e9s whom he places a little further south, in the very heart of Loango. (4)\n\nMore recent observations, the latest of which does not go back farther that 1861, (5) have come to hand to confirm these ancient data. The Bakk\u00e9-Bakk\u00e9s of Dapper were discovered again in Loango, under the name of Bakonkos, by a German expedition who brought back portraits and photographs. (6)\n\n---\n\n(1) Andrew Battel, an English sailor, taken prisoner by the Portuguese in 1589, was carried away to Congo, where he remained a captive for nearly eighteen years.

Hartmann, Die Negriller, Pl. XIII. These and many of the following bibliographical references regarding the history of Western Negrillos are borrowed from M. Hamy's work.\nDr. Touchard has remarked on the recent disappearance of a Gabonese race, the Akoas (1) a small group of whom were nevertheless in 1868, still established in the woods north of the river Nazareth. Admiral Fleuriot de Langle was able to photograph one of them who was a real dwarf. (2) It is the same with regard to the M'Boulous, Chekianis or Osi\u00e9kanis visited by M. M. Touchard (3) and Marche. (4) Smothered between the Fans and the Pongoes, they are fast dying out like their brethren, the Akoas.\n\nBy grouping together the information procured by these various photographs and descriptions, M. Hamy has been able to draw an almost complete portrait of some of these African dwarfs. The Akoa, examined by Admiral Fleuriot, \"seemed to be forty years old and was from 1m 39 to 1n 10 in height. He was most beautifully proportioned......He had a fairly good head, his hair was well placed, and less woolly than those of Negroes properly so called; the nose was straight and the commissure of the lips well defined, exhibiting in no way the bestial stamp so common with certain African types. (5)\" The photograph justifies this description. The head is globular, but relatively strong. The length of it, as compared to the total height of the individual comes very close to the ratio already mentioned by M. Hamy with reference to a Babongo (1/6). (6) The countenance is just a little prognathous. The muscles of the thorax and upper limbs present outlines at the same time developed and rounded; the lower limbs however are more slender, the feet are decidedly flat, and the heels rather too projecting.

Hamy, loc. cit., p. 84.\n(6) This is the highest ratio yet recorded among human beings. The Negrillos would surpass the Negritos in this respect.\n(7) Hamy, loc. cit., p. 84.\nM. Marche describes the M' Boulos as having an earthy-brown complexion. (1) Admiral Fleuriot confines himself to stating that these dwarfs are not so dark as their taller neighbours.\n\nWe have seen above that the Admiral has only spoken approximately of the height of his Akoa. M. Marche also confines himself to saying that the M' Boulos hardly exceed 1m 60. Dr. Falkenstein is more precise. The adult Babonko, whom he photographed, was about forty years of age and measured 1m 365. (2)\n\nThe average of these four figures is 1m 428; but as two of them have been given as maxima, we are entitled to consider this average as too high. With regard to stature, the Negrillos of this region would therefore be below Negritos and would come nearer to the Bushmen, who are perhaps the shortest race of men, their mean height being as low as 1m 370. (3)\n\nBut the Negrillos differ from the Bushmen in a most essential anatomical characteristic. These latter are strictly dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic, (4) whereas, on the contrary, the Akoas the Bongos,...&c., are brachycephalic or at least sub-brachycephalic. (5) The measurements of the skulls, brought back by Admiral Fleuriot, M. Marche and others, have removed all doubt as to this fact which a simple glance at the photographs is sufficient to prove. (6)\n\nM. Hamy has not contented himself with recognising and defining the Negrillo type of the tribes that have maintained a comparative purity of blood in Gaboon, lower Ogoou\u00e9 and Loango; he has traced it much farther and has shown that it has had a real and important influence on the formation of several of the popula-\n\n---\n\n(1) Hamy, loc. cit., p. 86.\n(2) The other individual was a young man of fifteen years old who measured 1m 025 only. (Hamy, loc. cit., p. 82.)\n(3) We shall see further on that the Akkas seem to stand below the Bushmen in this respect.\n(4) Their average horizontal index, 77.45, places them in this last category (Crania ethnica, p. 398).\n(5) Their average horizontal index, 83.23, raises them to the upper limit of sub-brachycephalism. (Crania ethnica, p. 350.)\n(6) Among others, the photograph given in the work of Admiral de Langle above quoted.\ntions of the same region and adjacent territories, who are connected with the negro type proper. Availing himself again of materials of all kinds, M. HAMY has proved that crossing of dolichocephalic with brachycephalic Negroes could alone account for the general mixture of characteristics, especially for the morphological differences in the skull, remarked, instance after instance, among various tribes of the valley of the Ogoou\u00e9 of Fernand-Vaz. (1) I need not follow him here in all the details which have brought him to this general conclusion, but will state one single fact only. When M. M. de Brazza and Ballay returned from the perilous journey, which was rewarded by the discovery of the Alima and the Licona, they found, on an island of the Upper Ogoou\u00e9, four skulls and one complete skeleton which are now in the anthropological gallery of the Museum. Two out of these five skulls, have an average horizontal index of 82.24, thus approaching very closely to true brachycephalism. (2) The three others are dolichocephalic. The former are the skulls of Negrillos the latter of Negroes.\n\nLet us add that the observations, gathered by M. Marche among the N'Javis, the Apindjis, the Okotas and the Okoas, show that among these races, who have the skull relatively full, there is a sensible falling off in stature. (3) With the N'Javis, it hardly\n\n(1) I should mention, among others, the study made by M. HAMY of the craniometrical results which Professor OWEN obtained by examining a collection brought from these regions by M. de CHAILLU. The English savant had published the rough figures. Our countryman calculated the indices and showed that, out of the 93 skulls, which formed the collection, 49 only were dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic, 11 sub-brachycephalic, and 2 brachycephalic. The intervention of an ethical element belonging to this last type is shewn clearly by this discussion which M. HAMY has made the starting point of his studies on the same subject. (Note sur l'existence des N\u00e8gres brachycephales sur la c\u00f4te occidentale d'Afrique, in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie, 2me s\u00e9rie, vol. VII, p. 210.)\n\n(2) HAMY, Note sur l'existence des N\u00e8gres brachycephales &c., p. 96.)\n\n(3) M. HAMY thinks that these tribes are allied to the Obongos seen by du CHAILLU, near Niembouai in the Ashango land. (1\u00b058'54\" south latitude and 11\u00b056'38\" east longitude). These Obongos belong in fact to the small sized populations we are examining now. The young adult male measured by the traveller, was 1m.366 only, and one of the women, 1m.340. But the dirty yellow colour of their skin and especially their short hair, growing in small frizzled tufts, had led to connecting these dwarfs with the BUSHMEN. However, du CHAILLU has not mentioned the characteristic apron and steato-\nreaches $1^m\\ 60$. Among the Akoas, the average height of the men varies from $1^m50$ to $1^m52$, that of the women being $1^m40$ to $1^m43$. (1) At the same time, the complexion is lighter, prognathism diminishes and the general outline is elegant especially among the women, whose rounded faces have a pleasant expression. It is evident that the negro type proper is modified in places by a distinct ethnological element, and we may consider the whole of this region as having been in former times, and still being to some extent, a centre of a Negrillo population. I shall further on refer again to the distinction which has thus to be made between the past and the present.\n\nI am inclined to consider as a centre of the same kind, another small territory, the Tenda-Mai\u00e9, situated much further north and west, in a bend of the Rio-Grande. MOLLIER, who visited these regions in 1818, says \"there is but little uniformity in the general characteristics of the physiognomy of these Negroes but the natives of the village of Faran are remarkable for their small stature, slender limbs and the softness of their voice. They are the true African Pigmies.\" (2) However incomplete this short description may be, it is easy to see that Tenda Mai\u00e9 is inhabited by a mixed population, of which these Pigmies are an element.\n\nAlthough Tenda Mai\u00e9 is somewhat distant from the spot where the Nasamons (3) of Herodotus were taken prisoners, yet it is difficult not to connect the diminutive men alluded to by the Greek historian with MOLLIER's Pigmies. The upper basins of the Rio-Grande and Niger are not far apart and we may admit, without difficulty, that they were inhabited, in former days, by men of the same race.\n\n(1) MARCHE Trois voyages dans l'Afrique occidentale, p. 342.\n(2) Voyage dans l'int\u00e9rieur de l'Afrique, aux sources du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et de la Gambie, second edn. vol. II, p. 216. The village of Faran is situated about $14^\\circ\\ 15'$ west longitude and $10^\\circ\\ 68'$ north latitude.\n(3) Vide Part I, p.\nThe Gaboon, the Ogoou\u00e9 and the Loango are a long way from Tenda Mai\u00e9, and the existence of Negrillo tribes has never as yet been reported within these limits. I am, however, inclined to believe that all these races of low stature are closely allied one with another. We know that the whole of the Guinea coast has been the same of successive invasions which have brought the conquering tribes of the interior up to the sea-coast. The purpose of the movement of these swarms of tribes, and their murderous customs, of which the Dahomeyans of our own times still furnish a well known example, explain easily how a comparatively feeble race could, and in fact did disappear over a considerable area. The extinction of some of these tribes has just been carried out in our own generation and under our very eyes. It was no doubt one of the last scenes of a drama, the first acts of which were enacted far back in the past.\n\nI shall not enter into more detail, the above being sufficient to lead me to the conclusion that the Negrillos of the Rio-Grande and those of the further end of the Gulf of Guinea are closely related with each other and that both have relation to the small beings described to Herodotus by the Nasamons.\n\nII.\n\nAlmost due East of this Gabonese group of pigmies, there probably exists, in the very heart of Africa, a large centre of Negrillo populations of which the ancients could have had no knowledge. The accounts given to Stanley by Ahmed, son of Djouma (1) seem to me to be of too precise a nature not to be founded on fact. This ivory merchant had himself seen the small men he spoke of and had had to fight them; he owned having been beaten by them and his statements agree with all the other information collected by the great American traveller. From this ensemble of evidence, it follows that towards the centre of the region comprised within the extensive track of Livingstone, there exists a race of dwarfs called Vouatouas, very numerous, spread over a\n\n(1) Across the Dark Continent. Vol. II, p. 114.\nconsiderable area and in possession of complete independence. (1) As he passed through Ikoundou, (2) Stanley captured an individual belonging to that or a neighbouring tribe. This Vouatoua measured 1m41. His head was large and his face was surrounded with uneven whiskers of a light chocolate-brown colour. Like Battel's little Negroes, these Vouatouas are elephant hunters and use poisoned arrows. This combination of physical and social characteristics connect them evidently with the Negrillos above-mentioned. We shall again find similar traits among their brethren, the descendants of the Pigmies of Homer and Pomponius Mela.\n\nThe tradition referring to the latter is by no means lost; it has been kept up, in particular, by the Arab geographers who have placed a river of the Pigmies in the South of Abyssinia. The Reverend Father L\u00e9on des Avanchers is of opinion that this river can be identified with a stream springing from the Anko mountains, a little to the north of the Equator. In this region, about 32\u00b0 east longitude, this eminent missionary has placed his Wa-B\u00e9rikimos, (3) also called Cincall\u00e9s, which literally means what a wonder! He also saw, in the kingdom of G\u00e9ra, several of these dwarfs whom he describes as \"deformed, thick-set beings, with large heads, and at the most four feet in height\" (about 1m 30) (4).\n\nThe particulars collected by M. d'Abbadie from Amace, ambassador of the King of Kullo, and from a woman a native of the neighbouring territory of Kaffa, (5) corroborate the preceding statements. The Malas or Maz\u00e9 Mal\u00e9as would stand a little over\n\n---\n\n(1) In Stanley's large Map this region is placed in about 3\u00b0 south latitude and 19\u00b0 east longitude.

(1)\n\nThe data, which my eminent colleague has been good enough to give me, seem to take these diminutive Negroes a little further North. But, even so, this would indicate that here, as in Western Africa, they are scattered over a more or less extensive area, and that their tribes bear different names. Everything, therefore, tends to show that, to the south of the Gallas countries, there exists a centre of a Negrillo population, and I do not think I am too bold in connecting these eastern tribes with the Pigmies of Pomponius Mela, just as I have compared the small beings of Herodotus with the dwarfs of Senegambia. It is useless, I think, my repeating here, in support of this opinion, the arguments which I have mentioned above.\n\nWe know that it is particularly the Pigmies of Homer, living in the marshy region of the Nile, who have attracted the attention of commentators. I have before this recalled the opinions expressed by Buffon and Roulin on this subject. (2) The paper of the Abb\u00e9 Banier sums up the various interpretations offered by other savants, who, also regarding these legends as having a certain groundwork of truth, have tried to identify the dwarfs of mythology with some of the populations known to the ancients. (3) It is hardly necessary to add that these conjectures, which were based on no solid foundation whatever, could lead to no valuable result, and it is easy to understand why earnest investigators should have rejected, as groundless, all that had been said on the subject. It was reserved for modern exploration to give another direction to these researches and to lead to positive conclusions.\n\nIn fact, the further travellers have penetrated in the regions of the Upper Nile, the more evidence they have been able to collect\n\n---\n\n(1) M.

The author endeavours to prove that Pigmies have really existed and are to be looked for in ancient Ethiopia. He identifies them with the Pachinians of Ptolemy.\nwith regard to these small sized populations. The existence of true Pigmies thus became more and more probable; so much so that in some instructions framed by a committee of the \"Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\" for the exploring expedition of M. d'Escayrac de Lauture, the compiler took care to draw the attention of the traveller to this particular point. (1) But we know that it has been in vain that Europeans have travelled up the Nile and have even reached its source; they have never come across these small beings. Speke alone saw, at the court of Kamrasi, a deformed dwarf of whom he gives a portrait. But this drawing and accompanying explanation show that Kymenia, far from belonging to a race of Pigmies, was not even aware of the existence of these diminutive Negroes. (2)\n\nIt is Schweinfurth to whom is due the honour of demonstrating that the myth of Homer concealed a reality, and of proving the words of Aristotle. But to do this he had to cross over from the watershed of the Nile to that of the Ouell\u00e9, to go beyond the land of the Niam-Niams and reach the country of the Monbouttous which he was the first to visit. It was at the court of Mounza that he discovered this dwarfish race, still known there under the name of Akkas, the very name which Mariette had read at the side of the portrait of a dwarf on a monument of the old Egyptian empire.\n\nFrom the information given to Schweinfurth by Adimokou, chief of the small colony which Mounza keeps near his royal residence, it would seem that the land of the Akkas or Tiki-Tikis, (3) is situated about 3\u00b0 North latitude and 25\u00b0 East longitude. This country is no doubt pretty extensive. Living on amicable terms with the surrounding populations, and protected by their mighty neighbour, the Akkas seem to occupy here a continuous area and\n\n---\n\n(1) Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.

(1) At the time of Schweinfurth's visit, these people were, partially at least, under the authority of Moummerr, one of Mounza's vassals, who came to pay homage to his suzerain at the head of a perfect regiment of these small Negroes, so that the European traveller was able to see, at the same time, several hundreds of these dwarf warriors. (2)\n\nIn exchange for one of his dogs, Schweinfurth obtained from Mounza one of the Akkas of whom he had made a portrait (3) He intended bringing him over to Europe, but the unfortunate Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 died of dysentery at Berber, South of Khartoum. His skeleton may perhaps one day be found by some traveller and brought to some Museum where it will furnish to science the anatomical indications which are still wanting concerning these people.\n\nThe only records we have as yet, with respect to the Akkas, proceed from the examination of living subjects, and are very few in number. The notes and measurements taken by Schweinfurth were burnt in the unlucky fire which destroyed the fruit of three years' arduous work and toil, and it was anything but easy to make up, even partially, for such a loss.

This journey is one of the most remarkable among those which have so rapidly increased our knowledge of Central Africa. It lasted from the beginning of July, 1868, to the early part of November, 1871, and the greater part of it was made in countries entirely unexplored up to that time by Europeans. The traveller had gathered splendid collections of all kinds and had taken numerous observations, notes, drawings, maps, etc. Nearly all of these scientific treasures were unfortunately destroyed by fire. We can well imagine the grief of the savant thus reduced to relate his travels from memory. His work is none the less most valuable on account of the information obtained about regions which until then were utterly unknown.\n\n(2) Schweinfurth, Au c\u0153ur de l'Afrique, p. 115.\n\n(3) Id. p. 64.

This is how one of these individuals arrived at Khartoum; he had been sent to the Governor of the Soudan by Emin-Bey (Doctor Schnitzor). M. Vossion, the French Vice-Consul, gave a brief description of him in a letter to which I will refer hereafter.\ngood luck, during one of his travels, of coming across two Akka female slaves, a young girl and an adult woman. (1) Another woman, Saida, sent to Italy by Gessi-Pacha, was thoroughly examined by M. Giglioli. (2) M. Chail\u00e9-Long-Bey saw also a woman who had accompanied one of Mounza's sisters to the country of the Niams-Niams. (3) M. Vossion, French Vice-Consul at Khartoum, has given, in a letter that was put at my disposal, a brief description of a grown-up man. But, though these records may corroborate and complete each other, still they would be quite insufficient, had not a favourable circumstance occurred, which furnished European anthropologists with the means of studying personally the curious race under remark.\n\nA traveller, more courageous than learned, M. Miani, had followed on the footsteps of Schweinfurth and also reached the country of Momboutous. Less fortunate than his predecessor, he broke down from fatigue, and died, bequeathing to the Italian Geographical Society, two young Akkas whom he had exchanged for a dog and a calf. (4) After various vicissitudes, Tebo and Chairallah, were taken charge of by a man of science and feeling, Count Miniscalchi-Erizzo, who had them brought up under his direction. They could thus be followed and studied at leisure. Their photographs were at the same time profusely distributed by the Geographical Society, and attracted, on all sides, the attention of anthropologists.

The author gives three photographs representing Tebo, full face and profile, and Chairallah full face only.\n\n(5) Tebo and Chairallah, on arriving at Cairo, were examined by Colucci-Pacha, Regny-Bey, Doctor Gailardot and by M.M. Schweinfurth, Owen, Cornalia and Panceri, who happened, by chance, to be at\nfirst to remove all doubt as to the reality of Schweinfurth's discovery. Some persons considered the individuals previously measured by travellers as mere children and believed that Tebo and Chairallah would grow taller. (1) The former of these two suppositions could not stand before the accurate statements made by Mar\u00f6, on the observations of MM. Giglioli and Chaillet-Long on three women, and those of M. Vossion on a man; as for the second hypothesis, it was refuted by one of the two Akkas himself, who, as he grew older, never exceeded or even reached the maximum height recorded by Schweinfurth. (2)\n\nThe Russian traveller measured six adults; none of them, says\n\nthe same time in Egypt. Their observations were published in the Bulletin de l'Institut Egyptien in 1873 and 1874. These little negroes were the cause of the publication of many other papers, among which I shall quote: Examen de deux N\u00e8gres Pygm\u00e9es de la tribu des Akkas ramen\u00e9s par Miani du fleuve Gabon, by M.

The Anthropological Society of Madrid seems to have shared the doubts entertained by the Roman Doctor.\n\n(3) Some doubt has been entertained as to the purity of type of Miani's Akkas. M. Hamy expresses, on this particular point, (loc. cit, p. 97) a reservation which is not perhaps entirely without ground with regard to Chairallah. On the other hand, his cephalic index is rather low (77.52): MM. Mantegazza and Zannetti, in their exhaustive work on these Akkas, grounding their opinion on the supposed age of the two subjects and the general laws of growth, had predicted that Tebo would stop below Chairallah (loc. cit, p. 144). The event has confirmed their prediction; Chairallah, still growing, had reached lm42, whereas Tebo, who has all the characteristics of an adult, and seems to have finished growing, has stopped at lm41 (Giglioli, loc. cit, p. 406). Moreover, the latter has a very high index (80.23). Therefore, if any doubt can still be said to exist with regard to Chairallah, who may perhaps have been affected by intermixture with a full-blood Negro element, such a supposition can however not apply to Tebo himself.\nhe, exceeded 1m50. (1) The one measured by M. Vossion, was 32 years old and 1m31 in height. Tebo, the older of Miani's Akkas, with all the characteristics of an adult, has stopped growing at 1m41, which is the average for the three figures above. (2)\n\nThe woman measured by Marn\u00f6, was from 20 to 25 years of age and came up to 1m36 (3); the one of Chaille-Long was 1m216; Sa\u00efda, 1m34 (4); the mean height thus being 1m302. The average for both sexes would be 1m356. These figures bring the Akkas, with regard to stature, perceptibly below the Minopies, and even slightly under the Bushmen, who, to this day, have been looked upon as the smallest people on earth. But the measurements obtained, up to now, among intertropical Pigmies are not numerous enough to allow of this fact being definitively accepted by science. (5)\n\nSchweinfurth describes the Akkas as having a very large head, a wide and nearly spheroidal skull. (6) The latter feature has certainly been exaggerated. The highest index, ever measured on the body, is given by Marn\u00f6's figures and only reaches 82-85, which amounts to about 80-85 for the dry skull. The average, for three young subjects, is 78-03, that is, over 76-00 for the dry skull. (7) This result, far from indicating the true dolicocephalism which distinguishes full-blooded Negroes, agrees on the contrary with the figures that distinguish the Negrillo type as shown above. According to Schweinfurth again, the complexion of the Akkas recalls the colour of slightly burnt coffee. The observations made on\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit, p. 151.\n(2) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 406.\n(3) Loc. cit, p. 461.\n(4) Loc. cit, p. p. 410.\n(5) This reservation is all the more justified that no Akka has ever exhibited so low a minimum (1m14) as the female Bushman measured by Barrow and especially as the individual of the same race to whom Doctor Weisbach assigns a stature of 1m only.\n(6) Loc. cit, p. 124.\n(7) In order to bring back the ratio obtained on the living to what it would be on the dry skull, M. Hamy takes into account the small development of the temporal muscles in young subjects, and reduces the index by one unit only, thus considering the average under remark as being 77.00 at least. (loc. cit, p. 98.)\nTebo and Chairallah are in accordance with this statement. But Count Miniscalchi has observed that their skin became much paler in winter time. (1) Their hair is about the same colour, though lighter in the case of Chairallah. With both it is decidedly woolly and forms gzom\u00e9rules; such is also the beard which has grown on Tebo's chin and upper lip. (2)\n\nSchweinfurth has represented Ns\u00e9vou\u00e9 as very prognathic, the nose being aquiline de profil, though the tip is blended with the upper lip (3); the chin is prominent, whereas, with Bombi, it recedes a good deal and the nose stands out more. (4) In that respect, Tebo's photograph approaches more closely the latter type than the former. (5) The lips are not so thick as with common Negroes, and are even described as thin by M. Vossion and by Schweinfurth as well.\n\nAll statements agree in assigning to the Akkas, men or women, a considerable expansion of the belly which gives to adults the appearance of Negro or Arab children. (6) In the photographs we possess of Tebo and Chairallah, this feature is most conspicuous. M. Panizza, who studied, in an anatomical point of view and by auscultation, the cause of such a development, attributes it to an unusual size of the spleen and of the left lobe of the liver, and also to a large amount of fat accumulated in the mesentery. (7) This distension of the abdomen is attended by consequences which have struck all observers. The chest, comparatively narrow and flat in the upper region, expands lower down so as to encompass this enormous paunch. (8) On the other hand, the protrusion of the belly requires, for the sake of balance in the body, that the lower portion of the spine should\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 301.\n(2) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 405.\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 64.\n(4) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 121.\n(5) Miniscalchi, loc. cit., p. 300.\n(6) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 123; Mar\u00f1o, loc. cit., p. 461; Vossion's unpublished letter. However, Bombi's portrait does not exhibit this character,\n(7) Loc. cit., p. 465.\n(8) Schweinfurth, loc. cit.\nalso be brought forward in consequence of which the vertebral column assumes the shape of an S causing the Akkas to look, so to speak, saddle-backed. (1)\n\nIt is obvious, however, that this abnormal development of the abdomen cannot be taken as a true racial characteristic of this people, but is no doubt brought on by their mode of living and nature of the food, and perhaps also by the general conditions of habitat. This we can infer from the personal experience of Count Miniscalchi, who noticed that, after a few weeks of wholesome and regular diet, \"the excessive expansion of the abdomen had disappeared and the spine had resumed its normal state.\" (2) The same change has occurred with regard to Sa\u00efda. (3)\n\nIn order to complete the physical description of these Akkas, I need say a few words about their limbs. The upper ones are long, and the hands very delicately shaped. (4) The lower limbs are short as compared with the bust and have a slight inward bend. The feet also are turned in, but more so than with other Africans. (5)\n\n(1) This conformation has been the cause of a singular mistake and of a good deal of discussion. In a communication to the Egyptian Institute (5th December, 1873), Schweinfurth had compared this bend of the spine to a C. The eminent traveller evidently alluded to the lower portion of the back and meant to say that the concavity of the C was turned backwards. But, acting under the influence of preconceived ideas, and in the hopes of discovering the missing link, which has been the subject of so much active search for so long, some venturesome minds supposed that the C represented the shape of the whole back, that the concavity was turned forward, and that, consequently, the Akkas bore, in that respect, a great resemblance to anthropomorphic monkeys. Before even having seen their photographs, I had combatted, at the Anthropological Society and elsewhere (loc. cit., p. 1519) this interpretation, which is perfectly incompatible with the mode of locomotion in man and with the agility universally attributed to the Akkas. Broca (loc. cit., p. 284) and also MM. Mantegazza and Zannetti (loc. cit., p. 148) have, later on, given the same arguments in support of our common opinion, which is entirely justified by the present state of knowledge on the subject.\n\n(2) Miniscalchi, loc. cit., p. 299.\n(3) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 410.\n(4) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 124. The photographs of Tebo and Chairallah do not justify this compliment, any more than the cast made of Tebo.\n(5) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 123.\nThe Akka women bear a great resemblance to the men. M. Giglioli speaks of Sa\u00efda as having a thick waist, short neck, arms neither slim nor long and hands rather large than otherwise. Her complexion, as with Chairallah, is that of a mulatto; her hair is of a fuliginous black and the grom'rules are not so distinct: prognathism rather more defined. (1) This description agrees perfectly with the portrait given by M. Chaille-Long, who adds that, in the case of his Tiki-Tiki woman, the breasts were very flaccid, though she vowed never having had any children. (2)\n\nThe physiological characteristics of Akkas resemble those of most savages. Their senses are extremely acute, and Schweinfurth repeatedly bears witness to their excessive agility. According to the Monboukous, these little creatures are wont to bound in the tall grass, after the manner of grasshoppers. (3) Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 had, in a certain measure, kept up that habit and during the time he stopped with Schweinfurth, was never able to bring a dish without spilling part of its contents. (4)\n\nThe Akkas are very courageous. \"They are men, and men who know how to fight,\" said Moumm\u00e9ri speaking of his followers. (5) They are great elephant hunters and will attack them with a very short bow, and spears hardly as high as themselves. (6) Long-Bey corroborates this statement and adds that the women are as martial as the men and this again fully confirms the information given by Battel. (7)\n\nSchweinfurth draws a miserable picture of the character and intellect of Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9. He describes him as enjoying the sight of\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 410.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 269.

Schweinfurth does not mention that their arrows are poisoned.\n(7) Long-Bey, loc. cit., p. 269.\nsuffering in men and animals, and as never having succeeded in learning Arabic or any other dialect of the country. (1) Miniscalchi, on the contrary, found Tebo and Chairallah to be affectionate and grateful pupils, always ready to improve themselves. Both of them, especially Tebo, had a great taste for music. Two years after their arrival in Europe, they knew how to read and write. Their adoptive father showed, in 1879, to one of his colleagues, two letters entirely worded and written out by them without any help whatever; the fac-simile of these specimens was inserted in the proceedings of the Congress. (2) They had not, however, forgotten their mother-tongue and could supply M. Miniscalchi with several hundred words and various information enabling him thus to draw up a grammar which he considers as similar to that of the Niam-Niam language. (3)\n\nWhat have these Akkas become under the influence of a European climate and of an education to which they were submitted, for the first time, these representatives of that ancient and wild race that has settled down at two or three degrees from the Equator? Evidently the question is of great interest, and we must feel grateful to M. Giglioli for having replied to it in detail. (4)\n\nTebo has always borne up very well against the cold winters of Verona. Chairallah has had ague and cough pretty often; he also suffered from rheumatism for the first two or three years, but both are now perfectly well acclimatized, (5) and so is also Sa\u00efda. (6)\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 125.\n(2) Loc. cit., p.p. 302 and 303.\n(3) M. Miniscalchi used to converse with them in Arabic, which they speak fluently.\n(4) Gli Akka viventi in Italia, loc. cit. This memoir was written in 1880, five years after that of Count Miniscalchi.\n(5) Id., p. 407.\n(6) M. Giglioli thought that he could discover, by a simple inspection of the head, that it had grown somewhat longer. The examination of the bust and the measures, necessarily approximative, which I took of this plaster-cast, do not, to my mind, justify this opinion.\nA casting was taken of Tebo, and his bust can be seen at the Museum. By comparing it with the photographs taken in 1874, we see that he has lost somewhat of his infantine looks; his forehead is less prominent, though not so slanting as with Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9. In that respect he comes closer to Bombi. Prognathism is rather more defined, but the other features are hardly altered. (1)\n\nThese two Akkas have kept a sensitive and unsettled disposition, like that of children. (2) They are fond of play; their motions are rapid, and, in their promenades, they like to run at a double-quick pace. (3)\n\nTebo is more affectionate and studious, and has always behaved himself well. Chairallah is more intelligent, but has occasionally showed himself spiteful and revengeful. They have, however, never quarrelled with their young friends, and they love each other most tenderly.\n\nBoth of them have been baptized and are observant of their religious duties, though their spiritual leader does not consider their sentiments in that respect as very deeply rooted. (4)\n\nThey have now completely forgotten their mother-tongue, and very nearly all the Arabic they knew. They speak Italian fluently, but experienced at first great difficulty in pronouncing words containing two z (bellezza, carezza).\n\nThey have a great sense of emulation, and, at school, have shown themselves superior to their European companions of ten and\n\n---\n\n(1) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 410.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 409.\n(3) The above could also apply to Sa\u00efda. However she was not treated in the same way as her countrymen. She remained a servant and was not taught to read and write. She speaks Italian fluently, and a little German, which is the language of her mistress; she is sometimes capricious and very fond of playing with children.

Giglioli, prove that they went thoroughly well through the various compositions in arithmetic, parsing and dictation. (1) Countess Miniscalchi gave music lessons to Tebo, and M. Giglioli heard him play, on the piano, some rather difficult pieces, with a certain amount of feeling and a good deal of precision. (2)\n\nIn short, we may conclude that, in spite of their small stature, their comparatively long arms, their large bellies and short legs, the Akkas are real and true men in every respect; those who had looked upon them as half-monkeys must be now completely undeceived.\n\nConclusion.\u2014The foregoing facts seem to convey a few general considerations which I will now briefly summarize.\n\nIn proceeding from Senegambia and Gaboon towards the land of the Gallas and Monboutous, we have verified the true existence of human communities characterized, all of them, by a small stature, a comparatively large and rounded head, a lighter complexion than that of Negroes proper, and by similar instincts and customs. With M. Hamy, we must acknowledge that these groups are as many specimens of a special race, the Negrillos, who are, in Africa, the representatives of the Asiatic and Indo-Melanesian Negritos.\n\nThe ancients evidently possessed more or less accurate information respecting these Negrillos, as well as the Negritos. They were the African Pigmies, but they had been placed in three geographical localities where they are no more to be met with nowadays. In order to find them, we must look to countries which are\n\n---\n\n(1) Chairallah had obtained 10 (maximum figure) for dictation and calligraphy; Tebo, also 10 for dictation. Their other notes are 8/10 and 9/10 except for the solution of arithmetic problems, in which Chairallah comes down to 7/10 and Tebo to 6/10. We find here again a proof of the inferiority of Negro races with regard to science.\n\n(2) Id. p. 209. Their education has unfortunately been stopped at present. Both Chairallah and Tebo make part of the household in the Miniscalchi family. (Giglioli loc. cit.)\nmuch further from Europe than was supposed in olden times; moreover, these Pigmies appear to us now as forming isolated agglomerations far apart from each other. Lastly, in one of these homes at least, we are able to witness at present the decline of the race and its fusion with a neighbouring element, which is constantly increasing in strength and number.\n\nAll these facts recall vividly the past, and the present fate of the Negritos must naturally be relegated to the same causes. They show us that, in days gone by, the Negrillos were more numerous and formed more compact and continuous communities, and that they must have been driven back and broken up by superior races. Their history, if better known, would most certainly bear a great resemblance to that of their Eastern brethren.\n\nWhat we know of the latter induces to believe that, in the lands where they are still to be found, these Negritos have preceded the races by whom they have subsequently been oppressed, dispersed and almost annihilated. With regard to Negrillos, similar facts must carry with them the same conclusions. We are thus brought to accept as most probable that these small and brachycephalic Negroes originally occupied at least a great part of Africa previous to the full-blooded Negroes characterized by dolicocephalism and a larger stature. The latter correspond with the Papuas, while the Negrillos are the Negritos of Africa.\n\nThis comparison does not arise simply from a superficial inspection of the African and Indo-Melanesian Negroes; it is also justified by the detailed study of skulls which renders evident the striking connection existing between the two great anthropological formations which represent the Negro type at both extremities of our continent. (1)\n\nHow could such a narrow resemblance have occurred between populations which are separated by so vast a space and by such\n\n(1) *Crania Ethnica.*\nnumerous and different races? Are these affinities the simple result of a common origin? This interrogation, and many others too, had been uttered, even before the late discovery of Negrillos, which has made a reply more urgent than ever. I regret to say that the present state of science does not allow us to offer a satisfactory solution to this problem, assuredly one of the most curious among the many points connected with the geographical distribution of the human race. (1)\n\nThe study of these small negro races suggests one more reflection.\n\nWhen alluding to Pigmies, the ancients mixed up with true facts many exaggerations and fables. Modern science, misled at times by its own strictness, and, dwelling solely on the unacceptable points of these traditions, rejected in a lump all the statements regarding the dwarfs of Asia and Africa. The above proves that science was wrong, and this mistake teaches us a lesson.\n\nWhen there is a question of traditions, of legends connected with people less learned than we are, and especially with wild populations, it is but right to examine them thoroughly, however strange\n\n(1) Logan has studied this question from different points of view, and has developed with much science, the theory that the African Negroes have penetrated into Asia and Melanesia through a slow influxion which has been accomplished by sea. He attributes a great influence to the Malagasy population. (The Ethnology of the Indian Archipelago; The Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia, vol. IV, and Ethnology of the Indo-Pacific Islands, vol. VII.) Flowers is inclined to admit that the small black race which sprung up in the southerly regions of India, has spread itself East and West in Melanesia and Africa, and that the tall Negroes are descended from it. (On the Osteology and Affinities of the Natives of the Andaman Islands; The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol IX.) Allen also derives the African Negroes from Asia and endeavours to prove that they have left traces of their passage in many parts of intermediate countries. (The Original Range of the Papua and Negrito Races; The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. VIII.) Professor Seeley thinks that the Negro race occupied, in former times, a strip of land which extended from Africa to Melanesia and is now submerged. (Quoted by Allen; loc. cit., p. 40.)\nand singular they may appear at first. Many of these accounts contain interesting and true information which is often concealed under superstitions, mistakes, forms of language or erroneous interpretations. The duty of the man of science is then similar to the task of the miner who separates gold from its quartz. Very often he also, with a little work and cautious criticism will succeed in redeeming, from a heap of errors, some important truth.\nVALENTYN'S DESCRIPTION OF MALACCA.\n\n[The following paper is a translation by Mr. M\u00fcller, Government Translator, of Valentyn's Account of Malacca.\n\nA portion of this has already appeared in Logan's Journal, Vol. IV, but as it appears that it was never completed, and matter was omitted which some might find interesting, and, further, that the translation was not altogether to be depended on, I have thought it worth while to insert a trustworthy translation of the whole with a few notes.\n\nD. F. A. H.]\n\nABSTRACT, TRANSLATED FROM FRANCOIS VALENTYN'S HISTORY OF MALACCA (ANNO 1726.)\n\nThe town of Malakka is situated in $2^\\circ 20'$ northern latitude and on $102^\\circ 20'$ longitude, on the Continental Malay coast, which lies easterly of the East coast of the great island of Sumatra, about 8 miles [leagues?] in a straight line from the opposite shore.\n\nPtolemy and the Ancients gave it the name of \"Terra or Regio Aurifera,\" which means \"the country rich in gold,\" or of \"Aurca Chersonesus,\" i.e., \"The Gold Peninsula,\" making it appear at about the 11th degree, where it is joined by a narrow isthmus to Tenasserim and Siam. It is the most southern territory of India.\n\nIt is situated on the point of a neck of land, between which and the N.E. coast of Sumatra is a fine sound, known by the name of the Straits of Malakka, or otherwise, by that of the Straits of Singapore, after a very ancient town commonly called Singapura.\n\nIt covers approximately an area of 1,800 paces in circuit, or of about one mile, and has a strong wall on the sea side of about 600 paces long, being also protected by a solid stone wall on the N.W. or river side. There is, moreover, a stone bastion on the N.E. side, called Santo Domingos, and there was another wall, called Tipah, built towards the waterside, and extending to a strong round bastion called St. Jago, now gone to ruins; there were also other fortresses on the S.E. side and two bastions, making it altogether a\nvery strong place, but in time almost all these fortifications have gone to ruins. We do not mention their names now, as they will appear in the course of this description.\n\nThe convent of the Jesuits, also called St. Paul's Convent, was built higher up in town, and the monastery of the Minorites, otherwise called that of Madre de Deos, stood on the adjacent hills.\n\nThe territory belonging to Malakka extends over a length of 30 miles, and over a breadth of about 10 miles. There are two islets in its vicinity, *Ilha das Naos*, (1) within a gun-shot from the town, and *Ilha das Pedras*, (2) from where they got the stones to build houses, &c. with, beyond the range of gun-shot. The Portuguese carracks and galleons used to anchor between these two islets in 4 or 5 fathoms of water. (3)\n\nOn the North-West side of the town is a wall with a gate and a small fortified turret, and next to it a river, discharging into the sea, with fresh water at low tide, but with salt water at high tide. Its width is 40 paces, and its current is generally pretty strong. It is commonly called \"Chrysorant,\" and there is another river on the East side. (4)\n\nThe country on the other side of the river (being on the same level with the land where the town is built) is joined to it by a wooden bridge; but the ground is very swampy on the South-East side, being generally flooded in the rainy monsoon, with the exception of a small piece along the beach, which lies somewhat higher.\n\nThere are in the town many fine and broad streets, but unpaved, and also many fine stone houses, the greater part of which are of the time of the Portuguese, and built very solidly after their fashion.\n\nThe town is built in the form of a crescent.\n\nThere is a respectable fortress of great strength, with solid walls and fortified with bastions, well-provided with guns, able to stand with its garrison a hard blow. (5) There are, in the fortress, several strong stone houses and pretty good streets, all remembering the Portuguese times, and the tower, erected on the hill, seems to be\n\n---\n\n(1) P\u016blau J\u0101wa.\n(2) P\u016blau \u016apeh.\n(3) Only about two fathoms now.\n(4) No traces of this now, except in the large drains near Kampong J\u0101wa, and Banda Hilir.\n(5) The only remains visible of this now are contained in the curious old gateway (near the residence of Mr. J. E. WESTERHOUT) which bears Portuguese arms, but a Dutch date, viz., 1670; this is probably what is left of the bastion called \"Baluarte Santiago\" as marked in the old plates of the Fortress.\nstill pretty strong, though its interior is falling into decay. This fortress, built on the hill in the centre of the town, is about the size of Delfshaven, and has also two gates, and though one of its sides stands on the hill, yet the other side is washed by the sea. It is at present the residence of the Governor, of the other officers employed by the company, and of the garrison, which is pretty strong. Two hundred years ago this place was merely a fishermen's village (1) and now it is a fine town.\n\nIn former times the town had a population of 12,000 souls; but there are now not more than 200 or 300 families, some of which are Dutch and some others Portuguese and Malays, the latter living in the most remote corners of the town in common attap huts.\n\nAt a small distance from the town are also some fine houses and many well-kept cocoa-nut plantations and gardens with fruit trees, the greater part of which are owned by Malays.\n\nThis town is remarkably well situated for trade, and these straits have been frequented, since the times of old, by much shipping, which still continues from Bengal, Coromandel, Surat, Persia, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, Siam, Tonkin, China, and from many other countries; the gross revenue in the year 1669 (consisting of 10 per cent. import duty and 3 per cent. export duty, and some other small taxes) amounting to 74,958.18 guilders.\n\nThere arrived in that same year 116 Javanese vessels, besides the Danish, Portuguese and Moorish vessels.\n\nThis place is very convenient for our vessels passing through the Straits of Singapore going from Japan to Bengal, Coromandel, Surat and Persia, and also for vessels bound for Batavia coming from those places.\n\nThe place is not very productive in provisions; everything must be imported from other places, with the exception of fish and some kinds of fruits.\n\nThe productiveness of this place is very poor, compared to that of the Coast [of Coromandel], Bengal, Ceylon, &c.; and the surrounding country bears a barren aspect.\n\nIt is also not safe to venture in the jungle, as it abounds in wild beasts.\n\nOne of my friends, Mr. van Naarsen, told me, that it once had happened to him in person to fall in with a tiger accidentally, and he was sure on several other occasions of being in the neighbourhood of one of these animals, for it was only in that case his horse\n\n(1) i.e. about 1525, or 14 years after the Portuguese took it, in which case it must have greatly fallen from the state in which they found it.\ngot unmanageable. There are, moreover, many elephants and other wild beasts. This same gentleman has told me also, that he once saw a tiger which made a leap at a deer that tried to escape him in the water; the deer did escape, and the tiger was dragged down by an alligator.\n\nThe East India Company has a Governor at this place, who has supreme authority over all the officers and over all the affairs. He is assisted by a Supercargo (as second in rank), an Attorney-General, (1) a Paymaster, and a staff of officers similar to those mentioned in our account of Amboina, performing almost the same duties and receiving the same pay; there are here, besides, several \"Opperhoofden\" (Commandants) of other places or factories, which are under the authority of this Governor, and also an especial \"Shahbandar\" or Collector of the Custom-house duties.\n\nA Council of Police is constituted from among these officers (as also already mentioned under Amboina) forming the Government of this territory; another Council administers the law; and a third one all the ecclesiastical affairs.\n\nThe Malays of these countries are commonly called \"orang di bawa angin,\" i.e., \"the people below the wind\" (to leeward), or else \"Easterlings,\" whilst those of the Occident, more especially the Arabs, are called \"orang atas angin,\" i.e., \"people above the wind\" or Occidentals; this is not that there are no other tribes of that name, but that these two nations are the most renowned, the most ingenious and the most civilised of that race.\n\nThe Malays are the most cunning, the most ingenious and the politest people of the whole East.\n\nWhether they have been thus called after the country, or whether the country has been called after them, will be shown by and by, when we shall have traced their origin as far back as possible, producing it from their earliest history.\n\nThey are of a rather pale hue and much fairer than other natives of India, also much kinder, more polite, neater in their manner of living, and in general so charming, that no other people can be compared to them. Their language, Bahasa Mal\u00e1yu, i.e., the Malay language (whether called after the people or after the country) was not only spoken on that coast, but was used through the whole of India, and in all the Eastern countries, as a language understood everywhere and by every one, just as French or Latin in Europe, or as the Lingua Franca in Italy or in the Levant, to such an extent even that, knowing that language, one never\n\n(1) Prokureur-Generaal.\nwill be at a loss, it being used and understood in Persia, nay even beyond that country on that side, and also as far as the Philippines.\n\nAnd if you don't understand this language, you are considered a very badly educated man in the East, whilst the Malays are accustomed to study it, trying their utmost to enlarge their knowledge of it and to learn also the Arabic; even some among them the Persian language too, and those who are more studious still strive to obtain the knowledge of the Sanskrit, the mother-language of most of the idioms in the East.\n\nThe Malay is spoken nowhere so correctly and so purely as here, though there is still a great difference between the Court language and that of the lower class. The language spoken by the courtiers is so swelling, so interlarded with Arabic (to show their erudition in that language), and differs so much from the common pure language (the former being the adulterated language), since every nation, that speaks this common or low Malay, has mixed some words of their own language with it, that it would not be understood by the common people, for which reason it is used only by princes, courtiers and priests, and therefore considered as the language of scholars. It is by nature a very pleasant, sweet, charming, and yet a very powerful language to express yourself in. A lot of works written in that language, already mentioned by us before, and several fine songs, in which they have transmitted many events of past times, show this plainly.\n\nThe Malay men are generally dressed in a pair of trousers, with a broad blue, red or green garment, worn as a blouse, and a turban rolled round the head.\n\nThey are commonly of a very lively nature, but they always keep open a back door and are not easily to be caught, while they are witty and of great self-conceit.\n\nI do not know another nation in the Indies more cunning than the Malays and the natives of Macassar, for which reason they are not much to be relied upon.\n\nThe women's dress is almost the same as that of other Indian women, or like that of the Javanese women, and consists in a long gown, hanging down to their feet and very often also fastened above the bosom under the arms, the upper part of the body being naked. They tie up their hair in a bundle at the back of their head, though some have another hair-dress, almost the same as that of the Creoles. These women too are generally of a more exalted\nmind than other women of India, and they excel also in loveliness and wit far above others. (1)\n\n(1) The following passage is given in Logan's Journal, p. 700, Vol. IV, but does not occur in my edition of Valentyn, which is dated 1726.\n\nD. F. A. H.\n\n\"The other inhabitants are Portuguese, who are well known, or other Indians, who have been already described as Chinese, Guzerattes, Bengalis, Coast-Moors, Achinese and others.\n\n\"The commodities produced here are these:\u2014\n\n\"Kelembak,* Agila-wood and Camphor in the Kingdom of Pahang, Tin, Gold, Pepper, Pedra de Porco (Query, Bezoar stones?), Elephant (tusks).\n\n\"The imported goods consist of:\u2014\n\n\"All sorts of cloths, more especially Petas Malayu, or Malay cloths.\n\n\"Surat cloths\n\n\"Bengal cloths.\n\n\"Guinea cloths (coarse blue calico.)\n\n\"Salampories.\u2020\n\n\"Bafta Brotsja.\u2021\n\n\"Bethilis.\u00a7\n\nCoast Chintz.\n\nOpium.\n\nRed Woollens.\n\nCopper.\n\nRupees.\n\nReals of eight [Spanish dollars?].\n\n\"The charges of the garrison and other expenses run very high, sometimes as much as 200,000 guilders (2 tonnen gouds), the reason of which is, that the clear income during the year is often much less than the outlay.\n\n\"In the year 1664 and during several years, the expenses were much higher and it was thought proper to reduce the strength of the garrison and bring the expenses within the sum mentioned, 200,000 guilders. Subsequently it was deemed proper further to reduce the expenditure by 40,000 guilders. Orders were given by their Excellencies in 1669 to reduce the extent of the fortifications and a certain Ensign (Vaandrig) was established there from the 17th of January of the year and entrusted with the duties of enquirer.\"\n\n* Marsden quotes Loureiro against Valentyn in support of the contention that \"k\u00e9\u010dmbak\" and \"gaharu\" (i.e. agila wood or lignum aloes) come from the same tree, and are merely different qualities arising from difference in age, &c., and he quotes also, \"Gahru chumpaka agullochum sparium, R.\" But \"k\u00e9\u010dmbak\" is the heart of the \"kamb\u00f4ja\" tree, known also as \"poko' bunga kubbur.\" The heart of the \"chemp\u00e2ka\" tree, furnishes the \"kas-t\u00fbri,\" while the heart of the \"k\u00e2ras\" tree produces all the varieties of \"gaharu,\" which are as follows:\u20141st quality, very black,\u2014\"lampam;\" the 2nd\u2014\"tandek\" or \"\u2014sisik;\" the 3rd\u2014\"wangkang;\" or \"\u2014buaya;\" 4th, which is not marketable, but is used privately, is the refuse of the 3rd and is called \"gaharu medang.\"\n\n\u2020 Half wool, half cotton.\n\n\u2021 Indian cotton cloth. Brotsja,\u2014place where it was made?\n\n\u00a7 A fine Indian linen.\nSeveral other factories are under the Governorship of Malakka of which some are in this country and others on the East coast of Sumatra, and the Opperhoofden (Commandants) of those Settlements were sent thither by the Governor of this place and by his Council. These factories are Peirah (P\u00e8rak), Keidah (K\u00e8dah), Oodjong-S\u00e0lang, (1) and Andragiri. (2)\n\nPeirah, the first named Settlement, situated on this Malay Coast, was subjected to the authority of the Queen of Atsjun (Aceh), and was only kept for the tin trade; the Hon'ble Company had appointed there an Underfactor, to purchase that mineral for ready cash, or to barter it against cloths at fifty Rix dollars the bahar, but the nature of that people is very mean and murderous, which it has shown by murdering in 1651 all the people of our factory at that place. Their Honours have often been compelled to order the Governors of this Government (Malakka) to break up quietly that factory and its lodgings, and to try to find an opportunity to avenge this abominable piece of rascality, which was carried out afterwards, and which we will mention with every particular later on.\n\nThe second outer-factory is Quedah (K\u00e8dah), also situated on this Coast almost opposite Atsjun. We had there also an Underfactor and a Settlement to barter tin, gold and elephants for the Hon'ble Company; but this small kingdom gave us also now and then so much trouble, that we have been obliged to break up this factory too.\n\nWe shall meet with the two other factories in our history of Sumatra.\n\n[Here follows a list of the Governors and principal Officials of the Government of Malacca.]\n\nLIST OF THE\n\nGOVERNORS OF MALAKKA.\n\nJohan van Twist, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, ... 1641\u20141642\nJeremias van Vliet, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India in 1645, ... 1642\u20141645\n\n(1) Commonly known as \"Junk Ceylon.\"\n(2) Indragiri.\nArnold de Vlaming van Ontshoorn, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, 1645\u20141646\nJohan Thyssoon Paijart, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India in 1657, 1646\u20141662\nJohan van Riebeek, Commander and President, 1632\u20141665\nBalthasar Bort, Commander and President, ... 1665\u20141668\nPromoted to Governorship, ... ... 1668\u20141679\nExtraordinary Council of India in 1670 and Ordinary Council of India in 1678.\nJacob Jorissoon Pits, Governor, ... ... 1679\u20141680\nCornelis van Quaalberg, Governor, ... ... 1680\u20141684\nExtraordinary Council of India in 1682.\nNicolaas Schaghen, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1682, ... ... 1684\u20141686\nDirk Komans, Director from 5th January till 26th November, ... ... ... 1686\nThomas Sicher, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India, ... ... ... 1686\u20141691\nDirk Komans, Director from 18th October, 1691, to 1st October, 1692, ... ... ... 1691\u20141692\nGelmer Vosburg, Governor, ... ... 1692\u20141697\nGovert van Hoorn, Governor, ... ... 1697\u20141700\nBernard Phoonsen, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1703, ... ... 1700\u20141704\nJohan Grotenhuys, Director from 18th January to 22nd May, ... ... ... 1704\nKarel Bolner, Governor, ... ... ... 1704\u20141707\nPieter Rooselaar, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1707, ... ... ... 1707\u20141709\nWillem Six, Governor, ... ... ... 1709\u20141711\nWillem Moerman, Governor, ... ... ... 1711\u20141717\nHerman van Suchtelen Governor, ... ... ... 1717\n### SUPERCARGOS OR SECUNDAS.\n\n| Name                        | Years          |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| Johan Verpoorten            | 1641\u20141642     |\n| N.

These three gems (which are now only found in very few libraries), though full of fictions and useless stories, are considered, however, among us as the best historical descriptions written in the Malay language, and which are not only most useful to learn the Malay thoroughly, but in which are also to be found many useful things about the Javanese, Malay and other Kings, not mentioned by another author. The Mohamedan Princes in India and their Priests are almost the unique possessors of those works, and it is the greatest difficulty in the world to get possession of one copy. But I have got them all, as I have mentioned already before, whilst speaking of the Malay language. Though we find in the two first mentioned works and in some other books, particulars clearing up many obscure points, yet the last one mentioned is in this respect the best one, while it gives us all the particulars from the very beginning, even from before the time that it (Malakka) was built, and in quite a decent style (for natives at least).\n\n(1) Hang T\u00faah.\u2014There were nine of these \"hangs,\" champions, of whom an account may be found in Leyden's \"Malay Annals.\" Crawfurd speaks contemptuously of it as a historical work, which it no doubt deserves; but it is useful for the insight it affords into the national customs and manners.\nI really don't know the author of the book *Hangtooha*, but I must admit it to be one of the most decent Malay works I ever have read, of which we will communicate to our readers a summary as briefly as possible.\n\nIf we want to trace scrupulously the origin of the Malays, it is worth while to find out first, whether they derive their name from the country (the Malay Coast and the town of Malacca) or whether that country has been called after them.\n\nThey lived first on the great island of Sumatra (called in former times *Andelis* \\(^1\\) and also *Maningeabo*, \\(^2\\) till it was discovered that this was the name of only one kingdom of this island) and there more especially in the kingdom of Palimbang, situated on the inner west coast, at about 8 degrees latitude, opposite the island of Banca, on the river *Malayoo*, which runs all round the mountain *Mahameroo*, \\(^3\\) and thence downwards to the river *T\u00e1tang* and so on into the sea.\n\n* Every one hearing the name of the first mentioned river, would feel inclined at once to think, that those who had settled there had been called after the said river \"Orang Malayoo,\" i.e., \"the Malayoo people, people living on the river Malayoo,\" others however suppose that that river (also called *Mallajoo* and *Maladjoo*) has received its name from this laborious, industrious, quick and hasty people, while the Malay word for laboriousness and quickness is also *Maladjoo*. But it is my opinion that the Malays got their first name from that river, and that they have given that name afterwards to several coasts and countries where they have settled, though the whole of this country (then nothing but fishermen) has been subdued by the King of Siam, of whom some of these natives have rid themselves a long time afterwards.\n\nAfter having been settled here for some years, without knowing anything about a King to govern them (an obscure period, about which nothing has been mentioned by one author), but not quite pleased with this place, and not always having been left unmolested,\n\n\\(^1\\) More commonly \"Indalas\" or \"Andalas.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau, or M\u00e9nangk\u00e9rbau, as to the origin of which name various legends exist, e.g. fight between tiger and buffalo, latter winning; also fight between gigantic Javanese buffalo and buffalo calf, latter victorious; again when R\u00e1ja was first instituted at Bukit Guntang P\u00e9njaringan a buffalo with golden horns and hoofs issued from a hole in the ground with a herd of followers, but returned to it before his pursuers could catch him and so \"m\u00e9nang k\u00e9rbau.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) Mahamiru, the Hindu Olympus.\n\n* This and much of what follows has already been criticised by competent critics, so I will not indulge myself here.\nthey thought it more advisable to elect a King (and such the more while they had greatly increased, whilst still heathens) which first King had the name of Sri Toori Bowana.\\(^{(1)}\\) This Prince has ruled them 48 years, and pretended to be a descendant of Alexander the Great, to whom Demang Laibur Dawang\\(^{(2)}\\) (who then ruled the Malays as a Prince of less fame) resigned his sway, in consideration of his illustrious lineage and while he was a descendant of such a renowned Prince; this happened in about 1160 A.C. (or some years before).\n\nThe Malays crossed under this Prince (Sri Toori Bowana) from the island of Sumatra to the opposite shore, now the Malay Coast, and more especially to its North-East point, known as \"Oedjong Tanah,\" that is, \"the extremity of the country,\" and known among geographers as \"Zir baad\" which means in Persian \"below wind\" (to leeward), hence receiving a long time afterwards also the new name of \"the people below wind\" (to leeward), or else \"Easterlings\" (above all the other nations in the East), from this so-called promontory where they had settled again, the same name having been given afterwards also to some of their neighbours or other Easterlings. This country has generally been known since that time by the name of \"Tanah Malayu,\" i.e., \"the Malay territory\" or else \"the Malay Coast,\" comprising in a larger sense all the country from that very point or from the 2nd degree till the 11th degree North latitude and till Tenasserim, though, taking it in a more limited sense, only that country is understood, which now belongs under the governorship and jurisdiction of Malacca and its environs; they are also considered above all the real and original Malays and they are, therefore, also called \"Orang Malayu,\" i.e., the Malays, whilst all the other Malays, either closely or far off, as those of Patani, Pahang, Peirah, Keidah, Djohor, Bintam,\\(^{(3)}\\) Lingga, Gampar,\\(^{(4)}\\) Haru, and others in this same country or on the islands of Bintang\\(^{(5)}\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) \"Sri Tribuana\" and \"Sri Trib'huvena\"\u2014Malay Annals, Leyden. But Crawfurd accepts \"Sri Turi Buana,\" and on the authority of Professor Wilson gives \"Illustrious Turi tree of the world\" as the meaning. His first name was \"Sang Sap\u00e9rba.\"\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) L\u00e9bar Daun. \"Demang,\" a Chief (Javanese).\u2014 \"Demang L\u00e9bar Daun\"\u2014 \"Chieftain Broad Leaf.\"\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) Batam or Batang Island lying between Bentan and Bulang? or Bentan?\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) Kampar, river and country of that name in Sumatra lying between the Siak and Indragiri rivers.\n\n\\(^{(5)}\\) Bentan, the island lying E. by S. of Singapore, on which is a prominent hill visible from Singapore, and alongside of which on the W. side of it, lies Pulau Penyingat, the site of Riau (Rhio).\nLingga (1) (on the South of Malakka), or in Sumatra, are also called Malays, but always with the addition of the name of the country where they come from, as for instance: Malayu-Djohor, Malayu-Patani, &c., &c.\n\nNow, this is that famous far-renowned country considered by many ancients and even by many people now-a-days, to be that very ancient Ofir, the country from where King Solomon got the gold and the other Indian curiosities, mentioned in the H. Scriptures, and consequently called by the ancients \"Regio Aurifera,\" i.e., the gold coast, the gold region.\n\nIt is certain that, leaving Ezion Geber and passing through the Red Sea and so along the shores of Arabia and Persia and from there again along the Coasts of Malabar, Coromandel and Bengal, and so on, skirting along the coast, from one shore to the other and finally along the Kingdoms of Arracan, Pegu, Siam and Tenasserim, till the Malay Coast, this could be done without a compass; but we have amply shown in our first volume and in other places, that it was not this Coast, which was meant by that Ofir, but that it must have been very likely the island of Ceylon.\n\nThe Malays, after having remained at that place for some time, built there their first town, calling it Singapura, and a small sound on the South side of the same town still carries that name.\n\nThe King of Madjapahit (an empire of Java) was in those days one of the most powerful Princes in those quarters. He was not only feared on the island of Java, but he had conquered also many places in Java Minor and in Sumatra and had extended his dominion over several other provinces. (2)\n\nMadjapahit then being one of the first and most celebrated cities, not only of Java, but of the surrounding islands too, the ambition of its Prince induced him to drive this new people out of their country, and consequently to attach a new pearl to his crown. He attacked them several times with large forces and thus forced them to fortify their place more and more.\n\nSiri Toeri Bowana died in 1208, after having ruled them as a brave Prince during 48 years, and was succeeded by Padoeka\n\n---\n\n(1) On this island is D\u00e4ck, the seat of the Johor sovereign after the abandonment of Johor-L\u00e2ma. The occurrence of the names Bintam Lingga and Bentang Lingga together, would suggest perhaps accidental repetitions, rather than the inference that Bintam was for Batam, the latter not being well known, while Bentan was in connection with Lingga. This is evidently the case from what appears on p. 65.\n\n(2) And had had communication with China after defeating a Chinese expedition sent against him.\nPikaram Wira as their second Prince. This one did not govern them for such a long space of time; he died after a period of 15 years. He did nothing of importance, only extending the recently built town and fortifying it a little more, so as to be able to withstand better the plots of the mighty Prince of Madjapahit, who did not leave him in peace.\n\nHe died A.D. 1223, and was then succeeded by the third King, Siri Rama Wikaram. This was a young and brave King, who ruled them during 13 years with moderation, and who commenced to be feared all round, but he died very suddenly in 1233, to the great grief of his people, who liked him very much.\n\nHis successor was Siri Maha Raja, who was the fourth King and who also made a very good figure and extended the town greatly. He governed them 12\u00bd years with great care, and was also very much liked by his subjects and feared by his enemies. He died in 1249.\n\nThat same year Siri Iskander Shah was elevated to the crown in his place as the last King of Singapura. He resisted the mighty King of Madjapahit in the first three years of his reign, but was so hard pressed by him at the end of 1252, that he had to abandon Singapura and to migrate higher up to the North side and from thence to the West side of this country, where he laid foundation of a new town in 1253. Including him, five kings had ruled in Singapura during a period of 91 years. He embellished that new place gradually to such an extent that, among the three great and celebrated cities in those quarters of the East, this place was considered afterwards to be the third in rank, or next to Pasi in Sumatra, which stood second next to Madjapahit. He called this new town Malakka, after a certain tree\u2014\"Kajoo Malakka,\" or the Malakka, otherwise called the Mirabolam or the pentagonal tree. While it happened that he commenced to build the town * at the very spot where he had taken some rest under such a tree, whilst waiting there till the dogs dislodged the game, one day that he was hunting in those environs, all which particulars are told at large in the book Henioowah. The former Kings of Madjapahit, not yet satisfied with the conquest of Singapura, crossed to the opposite shore of the island of Sumatra and took there the kingdom of Indragiri. Since then, they have always made one of the Javanese princes, related to them, King of that realm, and we shall find afterwards one of the Kings of\n\n---\n\n* Mr. Maxwell has drawn attention to the existence of a similar legend amongst the Guzaratis. (Journ. Roy. A. S. Soc., XIII, N.S.)\nMalakka as a King on that throne, invested with that authority by the King of Madjapahit.\n\nIn the meantime this town (Malakka) and this renowned people increased under this prince very much in importance and in power, and it was this King who laid the foundation of a permanent kingdom.\n\nHe lived till 1274 A.D., and died after having governed this people during 25 years, having swayed the sceptre three years in Singapura and 22 years as the first King of Malakka, feared by his neighbours, and beloved by his subjects. Sultan Magat succeeded him that same year as the second Malay King at Malakka.\n\nThis prince died after a short reign of two years, and on his death the Malays had been governed 115 years and 6 months by Heathen Kings.\n\nHe was succeeded in 1276 by Sultan Mohammed Shah, the seventh King of the Malays, and the third of Malakka, who was the first Mohammedan Prince of Malakka; he became famous, while he strongly propagated this new religion and greatly enlarged his empire during the 57 years that he governed this kingdom.\n\nIt seems that it was he who transferred the name of Malajoo to the adjacent islands of Lingga and Bintam or Bintang, South of the Promontory of the Malay Coast, and that he made that name famous among the natives of Djohor, Patani, Keidah (otherwise called Quedah), Peirah and of other places even on the opposite coast of Sumatra and Gampar (1) and Haru, and that the inhabitants of those quarters, feared him so much, that apparently all their countries were then already subjected to him.\n\nNot satisfied with those conquests, he married in the last years of his reign, the Princess of Arracan, heiress of that King, thus subjecting that kingdom by inheritance, installing the Prince, whom he appointed there and who had been selected among the Malays Mangkubumi, i.e., Chancellor of the Kingdom of Malakka.\n\nHe died A.D. 1333, after having reached a very advanced age, leaving to his son Sultan Aboo Shahid (the eighth King of the Malays, the fourth of Malakka, and the second Mohammedan King) a peaceable kingdom. But this Prince did not possess it a very long time, for he was stabbed by the King of Arracan in 1334, after a reign of but one year and five months, leaving the kingdom in the same condition as his father had left it to him.\n\nHe was succeeded that same year by Sultan Modafar Shah (as\n\n(1) Kampar, see note (4) page 64.\nthe ninth King of the Malays, the fifth of Malakka, and the third Mohammedan King). This King governed his people with great sagacity and very carefully.\n\nHe shewed his sagacity in leaving to his people a book full of sublime rules and maxims, called \"The Statutes of Malakka,\" and he has given also many proofs of his valour during his reign of 40 years.\n\nA very mighty Prince, called Boobatnja governed in 1340 the Kingdom of Siam (then called Sjaharnan or Sornan).\n\nThis King who had overpowered the countries all round his empire, having also received reports of the celebrated commercial town of Malakka, was jealous of its rise, challenged it to surrender, and when King Modafar would not submit to him, he ordered his General Awl Isjakar to attack it.\n\nA fierce battle ensued between these two Princes, or rather between their Generals, but Sri Nara Diraja, the General of Malakka, behaved so valiantly, that he forced the Siamese to retreat with great loss and shame. That King of Siam died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by one Chupandan, who did not leave the matter, but, again attacking the King of Malakka, besieged the town for the second time; but he was as unfortunate as his predecessor, and was also defeated by the same General of Malakka, who gave him such a severe blow in driving him away from the town, that he too died of chagrin a short time afterwards.\n\nIt was at this time that the town of Malakka was considered the third in rank with Madjapahit and Pasi, among the renowned cities in those quarters of the East.\n\nThis Prince governed this kingdom with much glory for some years more, and died in 1374.\n\nHe left his son as his successor, who was first commonly called Sultan Abdul, but called afterwards (when he became King) Sultan Mansor Shah. He was the tenth King of the Malays, the sixth of Malakka, and the fourth Mohammedan King. Many important things happened in these quarters during his reign, and none of his predecessors governed so long as he did, viz., 73 years.\n\nThe Kingdom of Indragiri on the East coast of Sumatra was still under the supremacy of Madjapahit in the beginning of the reign of this King, but when Mansor Shah had married Radin Gala Isjindra Kirana, the daughter of the King of Madjapahit and a Princess of great celebrity, that King bestowed the Kingdom of Indragiri upon his son-in-law, and in this manner Indragiri came under the rule of the Kings of Malakka, who governed it till we came here.\n\nThe King of Madjapahit was at that time (1380), so powerful\nthat he rather ought to have been styled an Emperor than a King, while there were so many Kings submitted to his supremacy, that, when they appeared in his council, he had to show to every one of them their seat according to their rank. He gave the first seat, the place of honour next to him, to the King of Daha; the second seat to the King of Tanjong Pura (Java), who was also married to one of his daughters, Nasa Kusama or Nyai Kasuma and who has succeeded him as King of Madjapahit; and the third seat was the place of the King of Malakka, his other son-in-law.\n\nKing Mansor Shah made also an alliance with the Emperor of China, and married his daughter. After this union he declared war with the King of Pahang and conquered his kingdom.\n\nAt that time Malakka was the first, Pasi the second, and Haru the third city in those quarters of the East: these places were famous, excelling in power and importance. Afterwards he declared also war with the King of Pasi, one Sainalahdin,* and defeated him too.\n\nA short time afterwards, about 1420, Krain Samarlooka, King of Macassar, sent a fleet of 200 sail with a strong army to Malakka, to wage war against that place, but the Laksamana or the Admiral of King Mansor Shah attacked the enemy so valiantly, that he compelled him to retreat, and he retired to Pasi, which place he then besieged, ruining the country all round it.\n\nThe said Sainalahdin, King of Pasi, afterwards had differences with his two younger brothers, who drove him from his kingdom, compelling him to take refuge with this King of Malakka (Mansor Shah), who took him under his protection.\n\nHe besieged Pasi for the sake of this Prince, and reconquered for him his kingdom and its chief town; but afterwards he (Sainalahdin) would not submit to Mansor Shah.\n\nHis reign thus passed in constant wars and military troubles. He died in 1447, leaving his son, Sultan Aleddin as his successor.\n\nHe was the eleventh King of the Malays, the seventh of Malakka and the fifth Mohammedan King.\n\nHis reign lasted 30 years, but it does not appear to me, that he performed anything memorable. It moreover seems to me that, under his rule, Malakka must have submitted for a short time to the dominion of the King of Siam.\n\nHe died in 1477 and was then succeeded by Sultan Mahmud Shah, who was the twelfth King of the Malays, the eighth and also\n\n* Zein\u00e9ddin, or Zeinal\u00e2b\u00e9din.\nthe last King of Malakka, and the sixth Mohammedan King.\n\nHe governed this people during 36 years, of which 29 years in Malakka and afterwards 7 years more in Johor. It was under his reign that the Malays threw off the Siamese yoke, and such in 1509; but we will see that at large in what follows.\n\nIt was also during the reign of this King, that the Portuguese arrived for the first time at Malakka, and conquered the country. For the sake of evidence and to clear up the matter, we will mention all those great events from the beginning and treat in due order that part of the history of Malakka and of its Kings till the time, when we arrived in these regions.\n\nARRIVAL OF THE PORTUGUESE AT MALAKKA.\n\nThe Malay historian is not quite correct, when he states that the Portuguese arrived for the first time in these quarters, more especially in Malakka, in the beginning of the 30th year of Sultan Mahmud Shah's reign, for, adding 29 years to the date that he ascended the throne, i.e., 1477, the first arrival of the Portuguese should have happened in A.D. 1506. and it is fully evident from what follows, that they first came here not earlier than two or three years after that date and that they did not conquer Malakka earlier than five years after that date, viz., A.D. 1511. This Prince's reign was consequently a longer one in Malakka and not such a long one in Johor.\n\nKing Emanuel of Portugal ordered in 1508 Jacob Sequeira, (1) one of his Admirals (according to Maffeijs it was the Admiral Didacus Lopes), to go with 4 vessels of his fleet of 16 sail to Malakka to make a treaty of friendship with the King of that country, then Sultan Mahmud Shah.\n\nArrived at Cochin, he first went in 1509 to Sumatra, touched at Acheen, and finally arrived thence at Malakka.\n\nHe met King Mahmud at that place, who had then just revolted from the King of Siam, under whose dominion the Malays had been for a short time. Sequeira, as soon as he had dropped anchor, forwarded one Heronemus Teixeira (1) with a present and with a letter written in Arabic from King Emanuel, requesting the said King of Malakka to allow him (Sequeira) to carry on trade in amity, which the King granted him at once.\n\nNo sooner had Sequeira made a treaty of friendship and of\n\n(1) This name is still met with here.\ncommerce, than the Moors and Arabs pointed out to the King that the Portuguese did not come here to trade, but that it was their intention to drive the Prince out of his kingdom. They spoke so in fear that, when the Portuguese were once allowed to trade here, their own traffic by means of caravans from Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt and to Europe, would be totally ruined.\n\nThey aspersed the Portuguese character to the utmost, and told the King that they had acted in that very manner at Cochin, Cannanore, Ormus and other places, that they had seized upon the said countries and had built fortresses in all those places to vindicate their rights.\n\nThe consequence of these instigations was that Mahmud at once made up his mind to violate his word and to break the treaty already made with Sequeira, and he intended to invite him with his principal officers to a dinner and to kill them all at that party.\n\nThe Moors thought this plot to be carried out as easily as it had been easy to their cunningness to persuade the King to their purposes, but we will see that they did not succeed so readily as they had imagined.\n\nTrue, Sequeira had already accepted the invitation, but, in the meantime, having been informed of the said plot, he pretended to be unwell and betrayed nothing.\n\nThe King had also allowed Sequeira to have a building on shore, in which house Rodrigo Arango (1) had already established himself as the Supercargo, for the trade of the Portuguese.\n\nThe Chinamen living here and a Persian woman had informed Sequeira in time, by means of a tailor, of the intended treachery, but at first neither he nor his companions would believe that it was true, and they went on courting the girls in the town behaving unchastely.\n\nOne Nakhoda Bequa and one Isutee Mutis, (2) a Javanese Raja (I really don't know how to spell these names), the wealthiest inhabitants of this place next to the King, meantime did their best to kindle this fire and to confirm the King of Malakka more and more in his hatred to the Portuguese. They made splendid presents to the King and to his uncle, thus trying to obtain their villainous object; but the Admiral of the King of Malakka, an honest man, fully disapproved this shameful treason, and maintained that the King was obliged to keep the treaty at least as long as these new customers had not given him a reason to do something\n\n---\n\n(1) According to the Commentaries of Albuquerque, \"Ruy de Araujo.\"\n(2) Utimuti, a Javanese title.\nof that kind with some appearance of justice: but all his persuasion, though well-founded, had no effect.\n\nWhen Mahmud heard that his first plot had failed and that the principal reason that Sequeira had not come was, that the promised spices had not been forwarded to him, he sent him word that he would despatch at once the crafts with the goods. Sequeira seemed to be pretty well pleased with this message, but he for his part stationed at the same time some of his boats on four different places so as to be prepared for all eventualities.\n\nThe King sent some embarkations with soldiers besides, who were hidden under the victuals and provisions. He ordered moreover some of his people to conceal their arms under their garments and to try to get access on board of the vessels as dealers in cattles, and to take hold of the opportunity as soon as they perceived a column of smoke going up in the town.\n\nPetrus Maffeius tells us, that Isutee Mutis had ordered his cousin, one Patiakoos, to kill Sequeira, while Sequeira had put his trust entirely in that man and admitted him freely into his presence.\n\nWhen everything had been properly arranged, the crafts paddled to the vessels; they created suspicion, however, by ascending the vessels with too large a number at once and Gracia de Sousa noticing this stopped them and sent Ferdinand Magellaan to Sequeira, to warn him that there was something suspicious in the wind.\n\nIsuti Mutis and his men, eight of which already surrounded Sequeira, who was playing at chess, stood anxiously waiting for the signal on shore, viz., the column of smoke. Sequeira, though warned by Magellaan, did not care at all about it; he only ordered a Mate to ascend the mast to see if the boats, which had their freight, were on the way back already, and continued his game as passionately as ever. Still the signal was not given, and when the Mate, who was in the mast, saw that a Malay drew his Kris and that another made a sign to show the first one, that it was not the right moment yet, he warned Sequeira at the top of his voice, that those Malays were merely waiting for a signal to effectuate their plot.\n\nSequeira called out for his arms just in time and drove the enemies overboard, who, astonished and wild that their attempt again had failed, jumped in their boats and hurried away from the vessels.\n\nThe signal on shore was given just after they had left the vessels, and the consequence was that those who had still stopped\nstraggling in the town, were murdered unmercifully. Twenty of them fled to the house of Rodrigo Arange (1) and Francisco Serano, and having got a boat in time escaped the massacre.\n\nWhilst Sequeira and his officers were still deliberating with each other about this wicked deed, the King and the Bandahara (Chancellor of the Exchequer) sent an Ambassador to the vessels to apologize for what had happened, offering to punish all the culprits and to deliver unhurt all the Portuguese who were still in Arange's house. The very first thing that Sequeira did, was to claim, that those Portuguese should be surrendered at once, but seeing that the King was continually using subterfuges and that his ships got gradually surrounded by a great many native crafts, blocking him up imperceptibly, he thought it more advisable not to stop any longer, but to weigh anchor, not only to avoid a flagrant breach of peace, but also not to miss his return to India through the Ganges, by the passing of the monsoon. But when he received the intelligence, that D'Almeida (together with whom he had been dispatched) had returned home, he too went back to Portugal. The famous Alfonsus Albukirk, who had been appointed Vice-Roy in 1509, had resolved in the meantime to conquer Aden, in compliance with the orders of his Sovereign; he consequently first sailed with 23 vessels, manned with 800 Portuguese and 600 Natives of Malabar to Ormus, intending to take the usual way, but, prevented by contrary winds, he had to put it off and to take another resolution. He then conquered Goa and made peace at Ormus.\n\nJacob Mendes Vasconsel, backed by several other ship-masters, wanted then to go to Malakka against the advice of Albukirk and actually started to realize that plan; but Albukirk had him brought back by main force, imprisoned him and dismissed several of his advisers.\n\nHe made at the same time a treaty with the King of Pacem (Pasi) and insisted upon the extradition of Nakhoda Begua; but this one having escaped before he could be surrendered, the Portuguese at once pursued him and succeeded in overtaking his ship, he was killed after having defended himself very bravely.\n\nThe following curious fact occurred at his death, viz., that no blood was to be seen first, though he had been stabbed through; but it was discovered then, that he wore a blood-stanching stone\n\n(1) See note (1) p. 71.\nin a bracelet, (1) and as soon as that stone had been removed from his body, the blood gushed from his wounds.\n\nIt was about that time that the King of Malakka, who was still a vassal of the King of Siam, threw off that yoke.\n\nHe (Albukirk) sailed to Malakka on the 1st August, 1511. The Chinamen of that place were kind enough to warn him of an attempt already planned there beforehand against him and promised at the same to assist him, whilst the King sent him a proposition of peace as soon as he had cast anchor. The King of Pahang (the Portuguese pronounce it Pan) to whom Mahmud's daughter had been betrothed a short time before, was also at Malakka, when Albukirk arrived there and it was on the wedding day at the very moment, that some of the allied princes, who had been invited to witness the marriage, were led round, seated on a magnificent triumphal car on 30 wheels, that he dropped anchor.\n\nThe sight of the arrival of Albukirk's fleet disturbed the King and all the wedding guests; the majority of them being natives, they wanted to run away at once, but the King, hearing that he did not want to interfere with their festivities, sent to inquire of him, with what kind of goods he could serve him, upon which he sent the reply that he did not want any new goods, but that he merely came to demand the Portuguese who were still there and those goods which had formerly been detained so deceitfully.\n\nThe King, who had certainly about 9,000 brass guns in the town, tried to put him off with promises and to protract till his fleet, which had left for an expedition, should have returned, and therefore told him, that those Portuguese had escaped; but Albukirk, not inclined to be put off with that excuse and receiving not even the slightest news of his companions on shore, ordered at once to set fire to some houses in the town and to some native embarkations, and thus compelled the King to deliver to him immediately Arange and the other Portuguese, whilst he assured Albukirk, that he wished most ardently to be at peace with him. But when Arange had warned Albukirk not to trust the King, he claimed a place where he could build a fortress, which the King promised him to his choice, putting it off however constantly. Seeing that\n\n(1) In the Commentaries of Albuquerque described as a bracelet of bone set in gold, said to be made \"of the bones of certain animals which were called 'cabuls' (also 'cabais') that are bred in the mountain ranges of the kingdom of Siam, and the person who carries these bones so that they touch his flesh can never lose his blood, however many wounds he may receive, so long as they are kept on him.\"\nthe King tried again to deceive him, he ordered to set fire to his palace. Then the King begged to make peace and accepted the terms made by Albukirk, who demanded the delivery of all the Portuguese, the restitution of the stolen goods, and the indemnification of the expenses for two fleets, which had been despatched this way; but the King's son (whom Maffeius has named Allodin) and the King of Pahang declining to accept the said terms, Albukirk ordered his troops to attack and to plunder the town, and to spare only the properties of one Ninachetu and of Isutinutis, (who had already made peace with him before and had submitted to him) and of all the Javanese who stood under his orders and of a few other individuals, who were his allies in town. The King having been wounded personally dismounted his elephant and fled, and so did the King of Pahang too, and they never returned again.\n\nA few days afterwards he and his General Antonio d'Abreo (1) attacked the town for a second time; a fierce battle was fought, but d'Abreo conquering a certain bridge put the Malays to flight and Albukirk made his entry in the royal palace where he found that the King and his household had already fled.\n\nAllodin having collected the fugitives, was defeated for a second time and compelled to flee to the island of Bintam (situated opposite to Singapore), where he fortified himself in spite of its Prince.\n\nThe Portuguese, once masters of the town, plundered it thoroughly, capturing among other things the 9,000 brass guns. The booty seized at Malakka was so rich, that one fifth of it, i.e., the part reserved for the King (of Portugal), amounted to 200,000 ducats.\n\nAlbukirk appointed Raja Isutinutis, head of the Moors, and Ninachetu, head of the other native inhabitants; he fortified the town, opened the place for the trade, and built of the tombs of the Kings the first Christian Church, devoted to the Annunciation.\n\nHe sent the news of this conquest to the King of Siam, who was very much pleased, that his disloyal vassal had been punished so severely, he congratulated Albukirk on his success and begged him to make an offensive and defensive alliance. The Laxaman (or Admiral of Malakka) came to beg him also to consider him a friend, assuring him, that he had tried to dissuade the King from making war, and Albukirk pardoned him also.\n\nAnd behold now this proud Malakka, the glory and the success of the Malays!\n\n(1) Commentaries\u2014Albuquerque, \"Dabreu.\"\nThe fugitive King Mahmud did not die of grief (1) (as it is asserted by the Portuguese), but he had fled in 1511, to the North-East side of the Southern Promontory of the country, after having ruled Malakka for 34 years; with him a period of 252 years was completed that this country had been under the sway of Malay Kings. He commenced to build a new town at that place (the third one built by Malay Kings in those quarters), enlarged it and finally finished it, and gave it the name of Johor, after the Arabic word \"Johor\" perhaps, which means \"a pearl\" also \"the fine human shape.\"\n\nHe founded a new empire there, the Kings of which from that date were no longer styled Malay Princes or Kings of Malakka, but Kings of Johor. He reigned two years at that place, died in 1513, and was succeeded by his son, who had not the name of Allodin (according to the Portuguese historians), but who has been mentioned by the Malays as Sultan Ahmed Shah, in their genealogical register of the Kings of Malakka and Johor. He was the thirteenth King of the Malays, the first of Johor, and the seventh Mohammedan King.\n\nTo be continued.\n\n(1) The Commentaries say he died at Pahang, a few days after his arrival there.\nTHE LAW AND CUSTOMS OF THE MALAYS WITH REFERENCE TO THE TENURE OF LAND.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nHere are, probably, few subjects connected with the Government of a Malay population which are so little understood by Englishmen in the Colony as the principles which account for the point of view from which these people treat the possession of, and rights in, land. Successive generations of public servants in the Straits Settlements have been haunted by a bug-bear known as \"the Malacca Land Question,\" which still makes periodical appearances, and is very far from having been set finally at rest: it is nearly sixty years old and has derived from the joint forces of ignorance and neglect an extraordinary vitality. From time to time a great deal of well-meant labour has been employed in trying to bring Asiatic customs and English law into harmony without the aid of legislation, and it need hardly be said that the task is an endless one. Two systems of tenure have been in operation in Malacca during the greater part of this century, and the present generation of officials have inherited a legacy of confusion in which time develops fresh combinations continually.\n\nIn all the provinces of British India, British Administrators have taken the native revenue system as the ground-work on which to build up a detailed and consistent structure of land-revenue administration. Native tenure has been fully recognised; native law has been studied; the technical terms used in the vernacular to express particular documents, tenures and native officials have been preserved and are employed in all the Courts; nothing so fatal to the prosperity of the country and\nso unsuited to the native mind as the introduction of English real-property law has been dreamt of. Why was the policy of Indian Administrators as regards Malacca directly contrary to that pursued in British India? Principally, I think, because it was not soon enough discovered that the conditions of Malacca\u2014an ancient Malay kingdom and then successively a Portuguese and Dutch Colony\u2014differed fundamentally from those of the modern Settlements of Penang and Singapore, which had no population prior to their acquisition by the East India Company, and to which, therefore, any law of land tenure might be applied without the fear of disturbing existing rights, interests, customs, prejudices or superstitions. Malacca has never been the seat of Government during its occupation by the British, and the land laws and regulations formulated from time to time by officials, more conversant with the English practice introduced into Penang and Singapore, than with native law and custom, have never really fulfilled their purpose.\n\nWithin the last nine years, certain Malay States on the West Coast of the Peninsula have fallen under the direction of British Officers subordinate to the Government of the Straits Settlements, and the latter are, therefore, to some extent, in a position similar to that of the Malacca officials earlier in the century. Unless future generations of public servants are to be confronted by a Perak, a Selangor, or a Sungei Ujong \"Land Question,\" it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of studying very closely, and understanding very clearly, the nature of native rights in land. There is even a danger of imbibing and conveying erroneous ideas on the subject by the use of English technical terms.\n\nThe first proclamation about land issued in Perak under the advice of a British Resident contained such terms as \"fee simple,\" and in Larut, as early as 1876, land was being transferred and mortgaged with all English legal technicalities by the aid of two or three ignorant scribes who brought printed forms from the nearest British Settlement\u2014Penang! It is perhaps doubtful if, to this day, the Malay law of land tenure and Malay thought and feeling regarding land are properly understood by Europeans in Native States, and, if not, there may be reason to fear difficulties in years to come.\nBesides persons in the service of the Native Governments, who are brought, by their duties, into connection with native land-holders, there is an independent class of British settlers\u2014planters, miners and others\u2014to whom it may be important to know what rights in contiguous land their native neighbours may have, and how far they are at liberty to alienate them.\n\nIt has occurred to me, therefore, that it may be useful to summarise, as far as I have been able to ascertain it, the law relating to immovable property in an independent Malay State, and to publish translated extracts from Malay Codes of laws, as well as the judgments of English Judges who have had to deal with the subject. I shall be amply repaid for the trouble which I have taken to examine the available information, and to arrange it in an intelligible form, if increased recognition and respect for the rights of native land-holders should be obtained thereby.\n\nChapter I.\n\nPROPRIETARY RIGHT.\n\nThe customary law of the Malays with reference to the occupation and proprietorship of land differs little from that of other Indo-Chinese nations\u2014the Burmese, Siamese and others. The natural condition of land in Malay countries, from Sumatra to Borneo, is characterised by dense forest, which demands no small labour and perseverance before a clearing is effected and cultivation commenced. Land is abundant, but the population is sparse; there is no restriction upon the selection and appropriation of forest land, and a proprietary right is created by the clearing of the land followed by continuous occu-\nForest land and land which, though once cleared, has been abandoned and bears no trace of appropriation (such as fruit-trees still existing) are said technically to be tanah mati, or \"dead land.\" He who, by clearing or cultivation, or by building a house, causes that to live which was dead (meny-hidop-kan bumi), acquires a proprietary right in the land, which now becomes tanah hidop (\"live land\") in contradistinction to tanah mati. His right to the land is absolute as long as occupation continues, or as long as the land bears signs of appropriation.\n\nThis qualification of the right of the proprietor is the key to several important distinctions which help towards the classification of the subject. Malays practice two kinds of cultivation\u2014either permanent cultivation (wet rice-fields and plantations of fruit-trees) in the plains; or shifting cultivation (dry rice-lands and vegetable gardens) on the hills. In cultivation of the latter kind, the element of continuous occupation, and, therefore, a lasting proprietary right, is wanting. Again, between wet rice-fields and fruit-plantations there is a wide difference in respect to the permanence of evidence of appropriation; the former, if left uncultivated for a few years, are soon covered with brushwood and rank vegetation, in which are harboured vermin of all sorts, to the injury of the crops of contiguous owners, and shew no signs, except the absence of heavy forest, of ever having been cultivated; the latter, on the other hand, even if abandoned, do not disappear for many years, not, in fact, until the insidious growth of jungle chokes and kills the fruit-trees. Malay custom has, therefore, fixed three years as the term within which wet rice-fields, if left uncultivated, shall remain subject to the proprietary right of the owner. If wet rice-land remains uncultivated for more than that period, it is open to the Raja, Chief or headman, within whose district it is situated, to put in another\n\n* \"In practice there may be said to be but one original foundation for land tenures in Burma, viz., that the cultivated-land clearer acquires an absolute dominion over the soil, subject only to contribution for the service of the State. He can alienate it by gift or sale, and in default of his doing so, it descends to his heirs in the usual order of succession. The title to land, therefore, is essentially allodial.\" British Burma Gazetteer, I, 438.\ncultivator. Abandoned fruit-plantations, on the other hand, may be successfully claimed and resumed by the proprietor, or by any one claiming under him by descent or transfer, as long as any of the trees survive, and the proprietary right is not extinguished until all evidence of proprietorship is gone.*\n\nA general view of the tenure of land in a Malay State has been given by Colonel Low; \u2020 the State selected as a type of the rest being Kedah, as it existed before the Siamese conquest:\n\n\"The sovereign was lord of the soil, which the orang bindang, \"or ryots, cultivated under regular tenures. The chief one was \"termed surat putus, under which the occupier paid at the out-\"set the price of one mas, or rupee, for every orlong of land. \"He received this deed from the Raja, and it was stamped with \"the chops of the latter and his ministers. It was in perpetui-\"ty, and could not be alienated, but was subject to resumption \"by the Government if the possessor allowed the land to go to \"waste within a given period\u2014sometimes thirty years. Instead \"of a regular quit-rent, each ryot capable of labour was sub-\"jected to a capitation-tax of 16 gantangs of paddy and one of \"cleaned rice, which would now be equivalent to nearly a \"dollar. This was occasionally commuted into a copper pay-\"ment.\" But Colonel Low fails to remark, what I believe to be the case, that only a small portion of the land of the State,\n\n* This is what I have myself observed in Perak, and have heard declared by natives to be the custom of the country. It agrees with what Marsden says of the Malays of Sumatra:\n\n\"While any of those (fruit-trees) subsist, the descendants of the planter \"may claim the ground, though it has been for years abandoned. If they are \"cut down, he may recover damages; but if they have disappeared in the \"course of nature, the land returns to the public.\"\n\n\u2020 Dissertation on Penang and Province Wellesley, p. 6. The practice of using a written document has perhaps been borrowed by the Keith Malays from the Siamese: \"A Chen Natt, or cultivator, who is desirous of clearing \"ground, applies to the headman of the village. The latter shows his written \"application to the proper officer, who directs him to inspect the land and \"measure it. The applicant, having cleared it, receives a written title; but \"although he is not in it vested absolutely with a right in perpetuity, still \"the land forms thereafter a part of his real property, is alienable by deed of \"sale, or by gift, and descends to his heirs at law. From this it is clear that \"the King can take advantage of so defective a title. Prescription is the \"owner's best safeguard.\" \u2014 Colonel Low, Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 337.\nand that the best *padi* land probably, is held direct from the Raja by *surut putus*. The restriction on alienation is, therefore, limited in operation, and the doctrine of proprietary right created by clearing and occupying is general.\n\nThe rules as to proprietary right may be stated as follows:\n\n1. There can be no proprietary right in *tanah mati*.\n2. *Tanah hidop* is of three kinds:\n   (a) Land planted with fruit-trees (*tanah kampong*).\n   (b) Wet rice-land (*tanah bendang*, or, *sawah*).\n   (c) Hill-land taken up for shifting crops (*tanah huma*, or, *ladang*).\n3. The proprietary right in *kampong* land endures during occupation and afterwards as long as any fruit-trees remain as evidence that the land is *tanah hidop*.\n4. The proprietary right in *tanah bendang*, or *sawah*, lasts as long as the land is occupied, and for three years afterwards.\n5. The proprietary right in *tanah huma*, or *ladang*, lasts as long as the land is occupied, which is usually a single season.\n\nThe rights of tenure in a primitive Malay settlement are thus exceedingly simple, if each proprietor is viewed as the owner of the piece of land which he has won for himself from the forest. The *kampong*, or village, is made up of independent holdings, and there is no such thing as a joint ownership, by the inhabitants of a village or tract, of cultivated lands, which is common in India. In long-established and populous settlements, the cultivated lands of which have been transmitted by descent for generations, there has, of course, been time for the operation of all sorts of influences\u2014the result of a comparatively civilised state of society\u2014which have contributed to introduce fresh modifications into the simple rules just enunciated. Thus, it will become necessary to consider, further on, the right of the Raja to a share of the produce, the liability of the proprietor for personal service, the right of the proprietor to sell and mortgage, the law of inheritance, &c.\nChapter II.\n\nHUMA OR LADANG CULTIVATION.\n\nThe most primitive form of cultivation known to the Malays, and one that is practised by numerous Indo-Chinese tribes, is the hill-farm system.*\n\nThe Malay peasant who does not possess a sawah, or wet padi field, or who, possessing one, is unable, from want of buffaloes or some other cause, to work it, selects a piece of forest land on the side of a hill and proceeds to clear it by first cutting down (t\u0113bas) the under-wood and then felling (t\u0113bang) the forest trees.\n\nWork is commenced about March or April, and when the fallen timber is dry it is set on fire; if this is skilfully done and advantage taken of wind, the whole is rapidly consumed, leaving a clear surface for agricultural operations. Charred stumps stick up in all directions on the clearing, and some of the lighter timber is turned to account in making a rough fence round the cultivated patch. Hill-padi (padi huma) is then sown by dropping a few seeds into holes made at short intervals with a pointed stick. Many Malays prefer the ladang system, as it is called, to the wet cultivation on the plains, for one reason, namely, the variety of different edible vegetables which a ladang will produce. Besides the hill-padi, he can grow on his farm bananas, Indian-corn, pumpkins and gourds, sugar-cane, chillies, &c., &c. Sometimes the same piece of land is cultivated in this manner two years running, but usually new land is taken up every year.\n\nThe Sakai and other aboriginal tribes who inhabit the interior of the Peninsula, also practise this system of hill-cultivation, and their clearings may be seen on the sides of the more distant mountains far removed from the districts inhabited by the Malays. Logan observed this among the wild tribes in the South of the Peninsula, and has described their mode of clearing and planting their ladang.\u2020\n\n* \"The custom of 'Chena' farms is of extreme antiquity in Ceylon. It is alluded to in the Mahawanso, B.C. 161, ch. xxiii, p. 140.\"\u2014Tennent's Ceylon, II, 463.\n\n\u2020 Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 455.\nThis is, no doubt, the national Malay mode of agriculture, and characteristically enough it is introduced into the legend which tells of the establishment of a royal line of Indian origin into Malay countries. The two peasant women whom the first Indian king meets when he descends upon the sacred mountain at Palembang, are described as engaged in cultivating a hill-garden (*ber-ladang*) where they plant hill-*padi*.* The successive processes of clearing, burning and planting appear to be carried out in Sumatra in precisely the same way as on the Peninsula.\u2020\n\nTennent's description of \"Chena\" cultivation in Ceylon is worth transcribing in full. It will be seen that he regards the disadvantages of the system as outweighed by its advantages:\n\n\"The process of Chena cultivation in this province is uniform and simple. The forest being felled, burned, cleared, and fenced, each individual's share is distinguished by marks, huts are erected for the several families, and in September the land is planted with Indian corn and pumpkins; and melon seeds are sown, and cassava plants put down round the enclosure. In December, the Indian corn is pulled in the cob and carried to market; and the ground is re-sown with millet and other kinds of grain, chillies, sweet potatoes, sugar-cane, hemp, yams, and other vegetables, over which an unwearied watch is kept up till March and April, when all is gathered and carried off. But as the cotton plants, which are put in at the same time with the small grain and other articles that form the second crop after the Indian corn has been pulled, require two years to come to maturity, one party is left behind to tend and gather, whilst their companions move forward into the forest to commence the process of felling the trees, and forming another Chena farm.\n\nThe Chena cultivation lasts but for two years in any one locality.

It likewise\nsuits the fancy of those who feel repugnant to labour for\nhire, but begrudge no toil upon a spot of earth which they\ncan call their own; where they can choose their own hours\nfor work and follow their own impulses to rest and idleness.\n\nIt is impossible to deny that this system tends to encourage\nthe natives in their predilection for a restless and unsettled\nlife, and that it therefore militates against their attaching\nthemselves to fixed pursuits, through which the interests of\nthe whole community would eventually be advanced. It\nlikewise leads to the destruction of large tracts of forest land,\nwhich, after conversion to Chena, are unprofitable for a long\nseries of years; but, on the other hand, it is equally evident\nthat the custom tends materially to augment the food of the\ndistrict (especially during periods of drought); to sustain\nthe wages of labour, and to prevent an undue increase in the\nmarket-value of the first necessaries of life. Regarding it in\nthis light, and looking to the prodigious extent of forest land\nin the island, of which the Chena cultivation affects only a\nminute and unsaleable portion, it is a prevalent and plausi-\nble supposition, in which, however, I am little disposed to\nacquiesce, that the advantages are sufficient to counterba-\nlance the disadvantages of the system.\"\n\nForbes,* who also gives a full description of this system of\n\n* British Burma, 281. \"I am not aware that the ludang mode of cultiva-\ntion offers any other advantage to the Malays than that it is compatible with\nthe enjoyment of a wandering life.\"\u2014NEWBOLD, Straits of Malacca, I, 263.\nagriculture as it prevails among the Karens of Burma, regards as \"their great peculiarity, which they possess in common \"with all the hill-races, not only of Burma and Assam, but of \"the whole of India, their unsettled and ever-changing mode of \"life, which entitles them to the designation of 'nomadic cul- \"tivators.'

The husbandry of the people of Laos \"and of the Karieng tribe is thus described by Pallegoix:\u2014\"Les \"Lao choisissent un endroit fertile dans la for\u00eat voisine, en \"abattent tous les arbres, et y mettent le feu, ce qui donne \u00e0 \"la terre une f\u00e9condit\u00e9 surprenante.\" *.............\" Les \"Karieng, de m\u00eame que les Lao, ont coutume de couper et de \"br\u00fbler chaque ann\u00e9e une certaine \u00e9tendue de la for\u00eat pour \"planter leur riz, changeant ainsi de place tous les ans, ce qui \"les oblige \u00e0 construire souvent de nouvelles cabanes.\" \u2020\n\nCambodia furnishes another example:\u2014\n\n\"La culture par le d\u00e9frichement et l'incendie des for\u00eats \"adopt\u00e9e par les habitants sauvages de l'int\u00e9rieur est encore \"bien plus barbare et plus regrettable.

The Dyaks of Borneo repeat year by year the toilsome operation of clearing forest land for their temporary farms. \"They do not suppose that the soil is in any way incapable of bearing further culture, but give always as a reason for deserting their farms, that the weeds and grass which immediately spring up after the padi has been gathered are less easily eradicated than ground occupied by old jungle is prepared. They never return to the same spot until after a period of seven years has elapsed, which they say was the custom of their ancestors.\" \u2021\n\nAmong the hill-tribes of India, the same primitive mode of cultivation which Himalaic swarms have carried eastward to Burma, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, may be viewed in the very districts, perhaps, in which it originated. The Kukis (north-east of Chittagong) cut down the jungle on the declivity of some hill in the month of March, and allow it to remain there until sufficiently decayed to burn freely, when they set it on fire, and thus at once perform the double purpose of clearing away the rubbish and of manuring the ground with its ashes. The women now dig small holes at certain distances in the spot so cleared and into each hole they throw a handful of different seeds they intend to rear. ||\n\nThe Abors observe the same method of cultivation, but take three successive crops off it before abandoning it. \u00b6\n\nIn India and Burma the control of this practice has necessarily engaged the attention of district officers, and in some districts fiscal regulations have recognised this system of shift-\n\n* Le Royaume du Cambodge\u2014Moura, I, 25, 26.\n\u2020 Journ.

In the Straits Settlements, on the other hand, where the necessity of making every cultivator take out a lease seems to have been the whole and sole guiding principle of the Land Office, the ladang or huma system has never been recognised and regulated. It is still practised, nevertheless, in parts of Malacca at a loss of revenue to the Colony. In Native States on the Peninsula it is, of course, common.\n\nThe following remarks on the temporary cultivation of hill-farms by certain tribes in India and Burma are extracted from Baden-Powell's Manual of the Land Revenue Systems and Land Tenures of British India (1882), p. 102:\n\n\"Shifting Cultivation.\n\n\"An account, however elementary, of Indian land tenures, would be incomplete without some notice of a customary holding of jungle land which is widely prevalent in parts of India, but which is of such a nature that it is very doubtful whether the term 'land-tenure' can with propriety be applied to it. I allude to the practice of temporary or shifting cultivation of patches of forest, which has in some districts proved an obstacle, or at least a source of difficulty in the way of making arrangements for the preservation of wooded tracts as forest estates, a work which modern science recognises as essential for almost any country, and especially a great continent like India with its climatic changes and seasons of drought of such frequent recurrence.\"\n\n\"In the jungle-clad hill country on the east and north of Bengal, in the Gh\u00e2ts of the eastern and western coasts of the peninsula, in the inland hill ranges of the Central Provinces and Southern India, there are aboriginal tribes who live by clearing patches of the jungle, and taking a crop or two off the virgin soil, after which the tract is left to grow up again while a new one is attacked.\n\n\"This method of cultivation seems to be instinctive to all tribes inhabiting such districts. It seems to be the natural and obvious method of dealing with a country so situated.\n\n\"The details of the custom are of course various, and the names are legion. The most widespread names, however, are\n\"jum\" in Bengal,* \"bewar\" (often, but incorrectly, dahy\u00e1) in the Central Provinces, \"kunri\" in South India, and \"toung-y\u00e1\" in Burma.\n\n\"In all cases the essence of the practice consists in selecting a hill side where the excessive tropical rainfall will drain off sufficiently to prevent flooding of the crop and on which there is a sufficient depth of soil. A few plots are selected, and all the vegetation carefully cut: the larger trees will usually be ringed and left to die;\u2014standing bare and dried, there will be no shade from them hurtful to the ripening crop. The refuse is left on the ground to dry. At the proper season, when the dry weather is at its height, and before the first rains begin and fit the ground for sowing, the whole mass will be set on fire: the ashes are dug into the ground, and the seed is sown,\u2014usually being mixed with the ashes and the whole dug in together. The plough is not used. The great labour after that consists in weeding, and it is the only labour after the first few days of hard cutting, to clear the ground in the first instance, are over. Weeding is, in many places, a sine qua non, for the rich soil would soon send up a crop of jungle growth that would suppress the hill rice or whatever it is that has been sown.\u2020\n\n\"A second crop may be taken, the following year, possibly a third, but then a new piece is cut, and the process is repeated.\n\n*Nature of Right to which such Practice gives rise.\n\n\"When the whole of the area in the locality judged suitable for treatment is exhausted, the families or tribes will move off to another region, and may, if land is abundant, only come back to the same hill sides after twenty or even forty years. But when the families are numerous, the land available be-\n\n* \"Jum is the general name used in official reports, but in reality this name must be entirely local. In fact no one name can be applied. In the Garo hills, in Chittagong, in Goalp\u00edra, in Sont\u00e1lia, and no doubt in every other district where this method of cultivation is practised, there is a different local name.\"\n\n\u2020 \"But this is not always the case, where the hill land has long been subject to this treatment, or where the soil is peculiar: in the Garo hills, I am told, weeding is not required.\"\n\"comes limited and then the rotation is shortened to a number\n\"of years\u2014seven or even less\u2014in which a growth, now reduced\n\"to bamboos and smaller jungle, can be got up to a sufficient\n\"density and height to give the soil and the ash manure neces-\n\"sary. In its ordinary form, this method of cultivation may\n\"give rise to some difficult questions. It obviously does not\n\"amount to a permanent, adverse occupation of a definite area\n\"of land; nor does it exactly fall in with any western legal con-\n\"ception of a right of user. In some cases it may be destructive\n\"of forest which is of great use and value, in others the forest\n\"may be of no use whatever, and this method of cultivation may\n\"be natural and necessary. The progress of civilisation and the\n\"increase in the population always tend to bring this class of\n\"cultivation into the former category, and then it is very difficult\n\"to deal with. It is impossible not to feel that whatever may\n\"be the theoretical failure in the growth of a strict right, the\n\"tribes that have for generations practised this cultivation from\n\"one range of hills to another, have something closely resem-\n\"bling a right; they have probably been paying a Government\n\"revenue or tax\u2014so much per adult male who can wield the\n\"knife or axe with which the clearing is effected\u2014which\n\"strengthens their claim to consideration. In creating forest\n\"estates for the public benefit, the adjustment of 'toung-y\u00e1',\n\"'kumri,' or 'j\u00fam' claims has now become a matter of\n\"settled and well-understood practice. In the Western Gh\u00e1ts it\n\"is becoming a subject of difficulty,* but the discussion of the\n\n* \"Already, in the Konkan, whole hill sides have been reduced to sterility,\n\"while the soil washed by the heavy monsoon rains off the bare hill side, has\n\"silted up and rendered useless, streams and creeks which were once navigable.\n\"The difficulty is that the tribes are always semi-barbarous, and the task is to\n\"induce them to overcome their apathy and take to permanent cultivation.\n\"Unfortunately, sympathetic officials, properly alive to the necessity of kindly\n\"treating these tribes, are usually totally blind to the real danger of destroying\n\"the Gh\u00e1t forests, or what is worse, professing to believe it, the belief has no\n\"real hold on them. To abolish this destructive cultivation, serious and sus-\n\"tained effort is necessary; to get the people to settle down, and to procure\n\"for them cattle, ploughs, and seed-grain, requires liberal expenditure. It is\n\"difficult to find officers who have the time or the zeal necessary for the first,\n\"and financial difficulties are likely to be in the way of the second. An easier\n\"course is to draw harrowing pictures of the suffering caused to the tribes by\n\"stopping their ancient cultivation, and to denounce the efforts of the Forest\n\"Administration as being harsh and without recognition of the 'wants of the\n\"question would be foreign to my present purpose, which is merely to describe what is in fact a form of land occupation or quasi-tenure.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter III.\n\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE RAJA.\n\nMonarchical government was introduced among the Malay tribes by Hindu rulers from India, and a new element was thus added to the primitive structure of society theretofore existing. The settlement or group of settlements of individual cultivators (each deriving his right to his holding from the fact that he and his family or slaves had reclaimed it from the forest) who lived in tribes under elected Chiefs, or Penghulus, for mutual protection, now became subject to the incidents of Aryan kingly government.\n\nThe rights of the Raja in the early Hindu kingdoms in India were:\n\n1. The right to a share in the grain.\n2. The right to collect taxes.\n3. The right of disposal of waste land.\n\nThe proportion of the padi crop which the Malay Raja or Chief can claim has come to be fixed by custom at one-tenth of the grain, and payment can be enforced by seizure of the crop or land. A new qualification in the proprietary right of the\n\n\"people. It is unfortunate that the very forests at the head-waters of streams with dense growth and steep slopes, which forest economy most imperatively calls on us to preserve, are the very tracts in which this temporary cultivation is most insisted on.\"\nland-holder has thus grown up in some districts. It was explained just now that his right, which was based upon original occupation, is absolute as long as that occupation continues; to this must now be added, \"and as long as a proportion of the grain is paid to the Raja or Chiefs.\"\n\nThe rate of one-tenth of the produce thus leviable by Malay custom is, it should be observed, the same as the rate still collected under a law based upon native custom, in Ceylon. So, in China, \"the land is held as a freehold as long as the sovereign receives his rent, which is estimated at about one-tenth of the produce, and the proprietors record their names in the District Magistrate's Office as responsible for the tax, feeling themselves secure in the possession while that is paid.\"*\n\nIn Cambodia, too, the share of the sovereign is one-tenth of gross produce. \u2020 Low, speaking of Siamese rule in Kedah, says: \"The Siamese, following the code of Menu, affect to exact only one-tenth of the gross produce value, but the tax is more than doubled in practice.\"\u2021\n\nThe right of the Raja to dispose of waste land cannot have been seriously exerted in Malay States in respect of forest land. The old Malay custom which permitted the free selection and appropriation of forest land for the purposes of cultivation was not interfered with, the adoption of any other course being almost impossible in countries the greater part of which was under forest. As regards abandoned land, or land to which there was no heir, it was, no doubt, different, and the rights of the Raja were often duly enforced. It is not difficult to see how the rights of the Raja to demand a proportion of the produce, on pain of forfeiture of the holding, and to dispose of waste land, tended by degrees to create the doctrine that the right to the soil was in the Raja. Such a doctrine did in fact grow up, and being, to all appearance, consistent with the rights exercised by the Raja, and not incompatible with the proprietary rights claimed by the Malay land-holder, it has received complete acceptance in Malay States. It was\n\n* The Middle Kingdom\u2014WILLIAMS, II, 100.\n\u2020 Le Royaume de Cambodge\u2014MOURA, I, 264.\n\u2021 Dissertation on Penang and Province Wellesley, 6. Journ. Ind. Arch., I 336.\nnot incompatible with the rights of the owner of the proprietary right, for he did not claim an allodial right to the soil, but merely the right to appropriate and keep for himself as much land as he had the power (usaha) to clear and keep in cultivation. There was no necessity, from his point of view, to ask in whom the absolute property in the soil was vested; he did not claim more than a usufruct, continuous as long as he chose it to be so, and terminable on abandonment.*\n\nThat the soil of a Malay State is vested in the Raja is a doctrine not now to be questioned, though it may have originated in confusion of thought, the exercise of the rights to collect the tenth and to dispose of abandoned land being assumed to imply the existence of a superior right of property in the soil, to which the rights of proprietorship were subor-\n\n* \"In the times of the early Hindu village communities, proprietary rights, as defined by powers to alienate, existed to a very trifling extent. In the more ancient form of community, as has been said, tenures had no market value; and in the later and more democratic communities where rights were more decided, the land was not an individual but a common property, and one man could not without the consent of the others sell to a stranger. Still transactions occurred in the latter case among the members of the community themselves, which showed an individual ownership within that limit. Sales were not common, and mortgages were usually not foreclose able for a very long period; but the latter existed in abundance, showing a certain value in individual ownership of landed property. Individual property in land sprung up earlier than elsewhere in the districts on the western coast, probably owing to the political circumstances which rendered the Government authority weak and the State demands light. The attitude of the Hindu rajahs with regard to the soil has been much discussed. It probably varied entirely with the circumstances of times and places. The object of Government is to obtain revenues for Government purposes. If it found communities so organized as to be able to farm the villages properly and to render the proper State dues, the Government would not interfere in the direction of the disposal of the lands claimed by the community. If it found an imperfect organization it would be forced to interfere in the disposal of the lands, especially of the waste lands, with a view to the proper development of the country and realization of the revenue. The tendency probably was for the villagers to lean more and more on the Government in these matters, and hence in many parts of the country the State interference became a regular institution. Still there is no evidence that any Hindu government ever took the step of ejecting an occupier; even if they failed to obtain their dues from him they limited their reprisals to personal torture or sale of moveable property. The sale law is not a native institution. The discussion whether the Indian governments are 'proprietors of the soil,' or not, seems to be little more than a dispute about words.\"\u2014Standing Information, Madras, p. 78.\ndinate. The right of the subject of a Malay State to appropriate and cultivate, and thus acquire a proprietary right over land which, though once tanah hidup, has been abandoned and has relapsed into tanah mati, is unquestioned*; it is not inconsistent with any supposed right of the Raja to the soil of the abandoned holding, for Malay tenant right may be established by a cultivator over the land of another. The Raja's absolute property in the soil, is but a barren right, and as he undoubtedly has, independently of it, the right of levying tenths and taxes and of forfeiting lands for non-payment, Malay law does not trouble itself much with speculation about it. Tenant right is the cardinal doctrine of the Malay cultivator, and, as long as that is fully recognised, it does not matter to him who or what functionary or power may, in theory, be clothed with the original and supreme right to the soil.\u2020\n\nWhen Malay laws speak of the grant by the Raja of lands already under cultivation to some Chief or royal favourite, it must be understood that what is granted is the right to exercise the royal privileges of claiming from the cultivators a tenth of the produce and of disposing of abandoned and forfeited lands. The Raja's property in the soil is not parted with, and the tenant right of the cultivators is in no way interfered with.

That he is perfectly despotic cannot be doubted. But eastern despots generally encourage agriculture, and however the case may have stood originally, it is evident from law cases quoted in the digests and decisions that the occupiers of the land have a firm prescriptive, if not an indefeasible proprietary right in it. Perhaps their Kings may have deemed, and with truth, that their own prosperity was linked with the admission of that right; and hence may have arisen the fixed assessment on landed property, which has not altered since the days of the earliest intercourse of Europeans with Siam. It is collected either in kind at 10 per cent. or in money. Ten per cent. on the value of the net produce is here meant. Although this, for Asia, is a light tax in itself, yet when taken in conjunction with the obligation to personal service for the State and with other exactions to which all are liable, it will be found on the whole oppressive. Besides, the Kings will often break through all law, social and moral.\"\u2014Colonel Low\u2014Journ. Ind. Arch., I. 336.\nso much trouble to the officers of the East India Company on their succession to the Government of that Settlement in 1825, were of this nature.* The grantees were nothing more than a species of what are called in India \"Zamindars.\" The absolute right of the cultivators to retain possession of their holdings as long as they paid to the grantees tenths of the produce, was in no way prejudiced, nor was the customary right of every native of the country to take up forest or waste land wherever he pleased and to bring it into cultivation. The grants were in accordance with Malay tenure, and in no sense corresponded with the English idea of a freehold holding. Nevertheless, there are not wanting, on the part of the few remaining grantees, attempts to assert that their rights within the districts granted to them include the fullest proprietorship of the soil, and to act as if they were the owners of the freehold. This is an illustration of the tendency to argue the acquisition of a proprietary right from the exercise of certain powers which, until their history is examined, seem to be inconsistent with any other position. So, in Bengal, the Zamindar, who was, in the inception of the native revenue system, a revenue official, or agent, established in course of time hereditary and proprietary rights and came to be looked on eventually as the proprietor of the district over which he exercised the rights assigned to him. Had the Straits officials from 1825 understood the true bearing of the position, according to Malay law, as the Dutch undoubtedly did (for the same system is recognised in some districts of Java), it would have been possible, perhaps, to have left the grantees in possession of their Zamindari rights, to have assessed the land revenue of their respective districts at a fixed sum, and to have exacted full payment of this, leaving the concessionaire to collect the tenth in detail from his tenantry.\n\nThe following principles regarding land tenure in Java had been laid down by Sir Stamford Raffles only eleven years before the settlement with the Malacca grantees took place \u2020:\u2014\n\n\"The nature of the landed tenure throughout the island is now\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 740.\n\u2020 Revenue Instructions, 11th February, 1814.\n\"thoroughly understood. Generally speaking, no proprietary\nright in the soil is vested in any between the actual cultiva-\ntor and the sovereign; the intermediate classes, who may\nhave at any time enjoyed the revenues of villages or districts\nbeing deemed merely the executive officers of Government\nwho received these revenues from the gift of their lord; and\nwho depended on his will alone for their tenure. Of this\nactual proprietary right, there can be no doubt that the\ninvestiture vested solely in the sovereign; but it is equally\ncertain that the first clearers of the land entitled themselves,\nas a just reward, to such a real property in the ground they\nthus in a manner created, that, while a due tribute of a cer-\ntain share of its produce was granted to the sovereign power\nfor the protection it extended, the government in return was\nequally bound not to disturb them or their heirs in its pos-\nsession. The disposal of the government share was thus,\ntherefore, all that could justly depend on the will of the\nruling authority; and consequently the numerous gifts of\nland made in various periods by the several sovereigns have\nin no way affected the rights of the actual cultivators. All\nthat Government could alienate was merely its own revenue\nor share of the produce. This subject has come fully under\ndiscussion, and the above result, as regarding this island, has\nbeen quite satisfactorily established.\"\n\nThe following description of the mode of creating these\nquasi-manorial rights in Java, and the nature of the rights\ncreated, from which it will appear that the Dutch in their\nEastern possessions have simply adopted the native law of\ntenure and have not introduced one of their own, is translated\nfrom Winckel's Essai sur les Principes r\u00e9gissant l'Administra-\ntion de la Justice aux Indes Orientales Hollandaises (1880), p.\n141. It is entirely in accordance with Malay law, and the\nprinciples laid down apply, to a great extent, to the private\nrights in Malacca which Governor Fullerton bought up,\nwith few exceptions, in 1828:\n\n\"Following in this respect the general Muhammadan law,\nat least in part, the ancient Javanese sovereigns* used to\n\n* \"This is still done in Java on the lands of the Susuhunan of Sourakarta\nand the Sultan of Jokjokarta.

We regret that this interesting subject is beyond the scope which we prescribed to ourselves. It is too extensive to be treated of in a note. Let us be satisfied with saying that the Court of Justice of Batavia (Boer's case, 5th June, 1878, Indisch Weekblad van het Regt, No. 784) admits as an extenuating circumstance the fact that the Ordinance is incomplete and bad, and that this has greatly contributed to the commission of acts of violence.

In those States which are governed by Rajas, there are also hereditary chiefs who intercept most of the revenue of particular districts, and in small quasi-republics like the Negri Sambilan taxation is practically unknown. The only purely Malay province in which I have personally seen the tenth of the grain collected by a native\n\n* \"Landheer in Dutch; Tuan tanah in Malay.\"\n\u2020 \"We are reminded that one of the estates of the Residency of Krawang has been encumbered (to prevent a partition, we believe) with a mortgage of six millions of florins. However, we are not competent to say what is the value of lands of this kind. All that we know is that they pay well worked by an European; a little less in the hands of a native farmer; enormously farmed out to a Chinaman.\"\nGovernment is the Krian province in Perak. Before 1874, the coast district lying between the Krian river and Pasir Gedabu was regarded as a personal estate of the reigning Sultan. It contains an extensive area of very fertile paddy-land, cultivated chiefly by Malays of Penang and Province Wellesley, who used in former times to live principally in the British Settlements, giving across to Krian during the padi season and removing their grain, when harvested, to their homes by the sea. The fact that most of the padi was taken out of the country in this way made it easy to collect the tax at the time of export, and at the time I speak of (1874), the headman upon each creek exacted, instead of an assessed tenth, a fixed tax of thirty gantangs of padi for every orlong cultivated, in money or kind, before a land-owner was allowed to export his grain to British territory. Those who lived permanently in Krian and did not export their padi had to settle with the Penghulu at the same rate. He kept a roll of the cultivators in his district, and estimated roughly, or by actual measurement, the area cultivated by each.\n\nThe inhabitants of this district paid also a capitation tax of $2.25 per family, or $1.12\u00bd per every unmarried male adult.\n\nThese taxes were not levied in Perak proper, first, because it is not a great grain-producing country, and taxation would have discouraged cultivators and caused them to abandon cultivation for mining\u2014the principal industry of the State; secondly, because the inhabitants of Perak proper were always available for the performance of forced services of all kinds, whereas the cultivators of Krian were a shifting population who spent most of their time in British territory.\n\nIt is evident that the Krian system of collection at the time of export is one not suited to a country in which the grain produced is intended for local consumption. It is not clear how the tithe of the produce of the Naning rice-fields, which, by an agreement made in 1644, became payable to the Dutch Government at Malacca,* was intended to be collected. It may have been levied upon cargoes coming down the river, but more probably it was never effectually exacted. In Kedah, following the Siamese custom, the practice seems to have been\n\n* Newbold, I, 203,\nto require the cultivator, under fear of punishment, to deliver\nthe tax in money or kind at a certain place. \"Grain-holders\nwere forced to deliver the rice into the Raja's granaries\nat the price he chose to fix on it, which always left him a\nprofit of about 20 per cent., nor could they sell grain without\nspecial permission.\"*\n\nThe method of levying the tenth on the rice-crops in Malacca\nis thus described by Newbold:\u2020 \"When the grain is ripe, a\nperson on the part of the Government visits the rice-fields,\nattended by the owner, the Panghulu, or Mata-Mata, of the\nvillage and several of the oldest inhabitants, on the spot, in\norder to agree upon and assess the value of the crop. A dif-\nference of opinion will naturally sometimes arise between the\ntaxer and the taxed. This is submitted to the arbitration of\nthe Panghulu and the village elders. But should these persons\nagain assess the crop at a lower value than the Collector's\nagent really thinks it worth, the latter has still the resource of\noffering to purchase the whole of the crop on the part of\nGovernment, at a price according to the owner's valuation.\nThis proposal, whenever made, has been, I believe, invariably\nrefused. It is not, therefore, improbable, all circumstances\nconsidered, that not more than seven or eight per cent., at the\nmost, ever finds its way into the Company's godowns. The\ntenth in kind on paddy is sold, whenever a good price can be\nprocured for it, on the spot, and the proceeds lodged in the\nTreasury. The tenth on the other articles of land produce is\nlevied at tolls placed at the entrances into Naning from Malac-\nca, and there immediately sold.\"\n\nThis account describes a purely native procedure, for, fifty\nyears ago, when Newbold wrote, just as at the present time\n(1884), no mode of collecting the tenth was provided by law.\nThe absence of legal powers to punish the evasion of the well-\nknown customary regulations does not, however, seem to have\nprevented the collectors from using their position as oppres-\nsively in a British possession as in a Native State.\u2021\n\n* Low\u2014Dissertation, p. 7.\n\u2020 Id., p. 261.\n\u2021 Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System of the Straits Settle-\nments, 1837-44, p. 61.\nSir Emerson Tennent, in his account of Ceylon, though he describes the manner in which the tenth is collected there under British Colonial rule,* does not state how, if at all, this varies from the practice which obtained under the native administration, but I find a very full description of the collection of a tithe on grain in an Asiatic kingdom in Moura's *Le Royaume de Cambodge*, which is interesting as shewing the extreme elaborateness of the procedure found necessary. It is instructive to compare the published descriptions of the efforts made during the last fifty or sixty years to collect the Malacca land revenue, one long history of want of knowledge on one side, and fraud and evasion on the other, shewing \"how cruelly the subject has been neglected and mismanaged,\"\u2020 with what this author is able to state as regards Cambodia, \"no difficulty or delay is ever experienced in getting in this tax\"!\n\n\"The rice-harvest is gathered between November and January, according to the forwardness of the crops. Towards the month of January, the King sends out into each province an envoy, who is the bearer of a royal order conferring on him the right of estimating the rice-crops realised by the owners, and of deciding the portion due to the State, that is to say, a tenth of the gross produce. The envoy is always accompanied on this mission by an agent of the Storekeeper-general of Phnom Penh. They proceed together to the province which has been assigned to them, and exhibit their credentials to the Governor. On sight of the King's seal, the Governor prostrates himself three times; he at once causes candles and joss-sticks to be lighted and places them on the ground in front of him, and he then listens, lying on his face, to the reading of the royal edict. He himself at once draws up instructions to the various employ\u00e9s of his province, so that the task of the envoys from the capital may be facilitated everywhere and that the reception to which they are entitled may be accorded to them. Lastly, the Governor nominates from among the local authorities a third delegate, who forms one, *c.e-officio*, of the committee of measurement. This delegate represents the interest of the\n\n* Tennent's *Ceylon*, II, 170.\n\u2020 Blundell\u2014*Journ. Ind.

As \"soon as they have settled down and are somewhat rested, the \"headman of the village joins them and presents 'the cloth \"of the oath,' a piece of cotton stuff five cubits long which is \"accompanied by five coins (worth about forty centimes), a \"cock, as door-keeper of the sala, and lastly some fresh betel \"leaves and peeled areca-nuts. The headman prostrates \"himself before his offering, and the royal delegate solemnly \"reads out his instructions. This recital over, the headman \"swears to conduct himself in the matter as an honest func-\"tionary and one anxious for the interests of the State, and \"not to lend assistance to any fraud calculated to withhold \"any portion of the crops of his district from the researches \"of the collectors.\"\n\n\"Next they proceed to examine, house by house, the heaps \"of rice; these are valued, and against the name of the person \"liable for the payment, there is entered on a register one-\"tenth of the quantity found, representing the tax due to the \"State; this the proprietor himself is under the obligation of \"conveying to the capital, together with a delivery order which \"the King's envoy delivers to each cultivator before leaving \"their house.\"\n\n\"When the circuit is finished, the Committee return to the \"chief town of the province, where three precisely identical \"registers are drawn up recording their labours; one of these \"registers is for the King, another is sent to the keeper of \"the rice-granary, and the third remains in the hands of the \"Governor. No difficulty or delay is ever experienced in \"getting in this tax.\"\n\n\"Rice which has been exported before the arrival of the \"collectors in the district has, of course, had to pay the tax of \"one-tenth at the custom house, and the cultivator has nothing \"to do but to shew the receipt of the custom-house officers.\"\n\n\"Forest produce, such as cardamums, gutta-percha, bees'\n\"wax, etc., are taxed in a different manner. The inhabitants\nof the forest are required to work these articles; the law\nprescribes what amount each family must furnish to the\nState annually, and everything exceeding this is for themselves.\nTimber is charged with a trifling duty when felled and after-\nwards with a tenth of its value on passing the custom\nhouse.\"*\n\nIt is almost incredible that the Colonial Government has\nnot got proper powers for collecting the tenth, but native cus-\ntom is hardly sufficient warrant to enable Courts governed by\nEnglish law and practice to punish by fine and imprisonment\nbreaches of a purely native revenue system, which has not been\nspecially adopted by the Legislature. Governor Fullerton,\nin a minute dated the 18th May, 1829, asked: \"How are we\nto regulate decisions at Malacca? There the sovereign right\nis one-tenth of the produce; the Dutch made over the right\nto certain of the inhabitants more than 100 years ago. This\nGovernment, by way of ensuring increase of cultivation and\nintroduction of population, redeemed the right. How are\nwe to levy the tenth if refused? The land tenures at Ma-\nlacca bear no analogy or resemblance to any English tenure;\nyet by such they must, in case of doubt, be tried. Regula-\ntions adapted to the case have indeed been sent to England,\nbut until local legislation is applied, and the mode of admi-\nnistering justice better adapted to the circumstances of the\nplace, it seems to me quite useless to attempt the realisation\nof any revenue whatever.\"\u2020\n\nThe problem is still unsolved, as the following extract from\nan official report laid before the Legislative Council of the\nColony last year shews:\n\n\"The valuation of padi before the assessment of the Govern-\nment tenths seems to be carried on in a perfunctory way.\nThe system is purely customary and its details have never\nbeen regulated by any law. When the padi in a district is\nripe, a Clerk (Eurasian or Malay) is sent there. He visits\nthe rice-fields with the Panghulu. A little of the padi is\ncut and examined, and an estimate is formed of the probable\n\n* MOURA\u2014Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 264.\n\u2020 House of Commons Papers, 320E., October, 1831.\nyield and what is the assessed tenth. These Clerks are ignorant, and the correctness of their returns is not checked in any way. They are entirely dependent upon the Panghulu for information as to the names of occupiers and the extent of their cultivation. These may vary annually, for it is the cultivator (not necessarily the proprietor, but possibly a tenant for the season only) who has to pay the tenth, and only a portion of a given holding may be under cultivation.\n\nWhen the Clerk has finished his assessment of a district, a copy of his return is made out in Malay and sent to the Panghulu. The latter collects the money from the ryots and pays it to the Land Office, receiving a commission of ten per cent. on the amounts collected. This procedure is sanctioned by custom only and not by law. There is no summary method of punishing a cultivator who cuts his crop before it has been assessed, or a Panghulu who fails to attend the valuation Clerk, or the Panghulu, or Clerk, who makes a dishonest assessment or return.*\n\n---\n\nChapter V.\n\nSUB-TENANCY.\n\n\"Persons,\" says the Malacca Code, \"who settle on the lands or plantations of others, must obey the orders of the proprietor, and if they oppose him, they may be fined ten tahils and one paha. It is the duty of all the dwellers on the land to co-operate with the proprietor.\"\n\n* Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements for 1883, p. 392.\nThis passage indicates the existence of a class of sub-tenants subordinate to a proprietor, and that the tenant right of these people includes fixity of tenure may be gathered from the fact that a refractory tenant is liable to fine only. There is no hint of eviction. The peasant cultivator, or sub-tenant, who enters into occupation of the land of another, with his consent (unqualified as to time), acquires, therefore, a proprietary right, subject to the right of the other to a share in the produce of the land, and subject to the liability of being fined if he does not obey his feudal superior.\n\nThus one proprietary right may spring up within another, and this may go on ad infinitum; in Bengal, since the permanent settlement, as many as eighteen and twenty distinct rights may sometimes be discoverable between the Zemindar and cultivator. So among the Malays a man who, by his personal industry, or by the co-operation of his family and slaves, or by inheritance, finds himself in possession of more land than he wishes to cultivate, can, by admitting sub-tenants, secure himself an annual return, in kind, of grain or fruit, besides adding to his importance by the acquisition of a number of neighbours who are bound to recognise his superior proprietary rights and to obey him on pain of fine. The first proprietor who, as was stated at the outset, is bound to keep up continuous occupation or cultivation, performs this duty vicariously in the persons of his sub-tenants, and they again, if they choose, create fresh sub-tenancies on the same system.\n\nIf cultivation, or the payment of the tenth, ceases on the part of the tenant for a period prescribed by custom (See supra p. 77) his tenant right lapses.\n\nThis is the explanation of the decision in the case of Abdul-latif v. Mahomed Meera Lebe tried in Malacca in 1829. The plaintiff, who brought an action to recover possession of a piece of land, was non-suited. Apparently he was a proprietor who had admitted a sub-tenant on the customary agreement to pay one-tenth of the produce, and he desired to regard this as a tenancy terminable at the will of the proprietor. But the Court upheld the right of the sub-tenant, or cultivator, to fixity of tenure as long as the land was kept in cultivation and the tenth paid. (See Appendix, III, p. xxxvi.)\nIn this case, it was laid down, among other things, that \"the owner of the soil\" (proprietor?) may sell or otherwise dispose of his interest without prejudice to the cultivator, and the cultivator *vice versa.* This is, of course, quite consistent with the existence of separate rights, but these are not necessarily confined to two persons, the possessor of the first proprietary right (whom, for convenience sake, I have hitherto called the proprietor) and the cultivator, but there may intervene any number of subordinate proprietary rights, one springing from within another.\n\nWhere a chief or royal favourite or some powerful individual or family has obtained a grant from the Raja, or has usurped the right of the Raja to levy tenths and taxes and to dispose of abandoned land, a relationship between this superior proprietor and the cultivator is established, which soon develops into a system of tenancy, which is not readily distinguishable from that just described. The tenant continues to be the proprietor of his holding on fixed tenure, subject to the customary terms, while the rights of the superior proprietor, be they the creation of the Raja, or inherited, or the result of usurpation, become, in course of time, so fixed and continuous as to favour the impression that they include ownership of the soil. The position, therefore, which the judgment in *Abdullatif v. Mahomed Meera Lebe* discusses as existing between \"the owner of the soil\" (see note at foot) and the cultivator, may be created either by the admission of a tenant by a proprietor already in possession or by the establishment of a proprietor over the heads of cultivators already in possession. In a Malay State, the exercise of the rights of the superior proprietor are liable to much fluctuation. The despotic power of the Raja in petty Asiatic States is, of course, fatal to anything like\n\n---\n\n*With all deference, I conceive that the learned Recorder was in error in using the term \"owner of the soil.\" The first proprietor has really only a proprietary right (unless, in Malacca, he has purchased the freehold from the British Government), which depends upon continuous occupation and payment of tenths to the Raja or Government, but, of course, in a district where land is valuable, occupation is certain to be continuous and thus the first proprietor comes to be regarded as the \"owner of the soil.\"*\nsecurity of rights of property* and everything depends upon the personal energy and family influence of the person who claims the superior rights. There will always be other candidates for royal favour who will seek to supplant him in his rights if they are profitable (the rights of minors are almost certain to be invaded in this way), and the cultivator is always anxious to be recognised as an independent proprietor. One man will make good his right to receive tenths from a whole district and to regard the cultivators as his tenants, while his successor may, perhaps, on some show of opposition, tacitly abandon all such claims and leave the cultivators to be recognised in course of time as separate proprietors. All this is quite inconsistent with any notion of \"ownership of the soil,\" though it is easy to see how a systematic and continuous exercise of proprietary rights would lead an English Court to assume that such ownership existed. I entirely repudiate the theory of \"ownership of the soil\" as incidental in any way to the Malay system of land-tenure, and all the evidence shows that the Dutch grantee in Malacca had simply the rights of a Malay *tuan tanah*, such a one as I have described as being put in by the Raja over the heads of the cultivators.\n\nThe right of the proprietor to require obedience from his tenants raises a new question\u2014the liability of the cultivator to forced labour.\n\n---\n\n* \"From the facts already adduced, regarding the state of landed tenures, it will have appeared that the proprietary right to the soil is unquestionably vested in the Sovereign. This principle is so universally established, and so frequently exercised, that it is almost superfluous to offer any proof of it. Such is the fluctuation of landed property from the operation of this principle that there is not, perhaps, all over the country, at the present day, ten *jungs* of land in the possession of the descendants of those who held them fifty, nay, thirty years ago. The actual effect of the principle is, indeed, even more violent than we should be led at first sight to argue. The descendants of those who, no great number of years ago, were in affluence, holding the highest employments of the State, and, consequently, important and valuable tracts of land, may now be seen not only not inheriting the possessions of their forefathers, but hardly enjoying the bare means of subsistence, and reduced to a level with the meanest of the people.\" CRAWFURD\u2014Report on Nature and Condition of Landed Tenures under the Native Government of Java. Quoted by RAFFLES: Minute on Administration of Java, p. 92.\nChapter VI.\n\nTHE LIABILITY OF THE CULTIVATOR TO FORCED SERVICE.\n\nIn a land regulation passed by the Governor in Council in the Straits Settlements for the Settlement of Malacca (IX of 1830), there occurs a clause which declares cultivators to be exempt from forced labour. This regulation, if it ever had the force of law, was repealed a few years afterwards, and none of the Land Acts now in force in the Straits approach the subject at all. Whether or not the liability to forced labour from which Malacca cultivators were declared to be exempt in 1830, still survives, though dormant, as one of the incidents of the local customary tenure, is not a question of much importance now, for there is little likelihood of any attempt being made to enforce it on a large scale in a British Colony. But it is clear that, if there had been no existing liability in 1830, there would have been no necessity for special exemption. A code of regulations for Penghulus, which the Dutch authorities were about to introduce in Malacca just before the cession in 1825, contains a clause requiring the Penghulu to keep all roads in order and to call on the tenants to repair them. This, too, assumes a pre-existing duty on the part of the tenants.\n\nMr. Fullerton, Governor of Penang and subsequently of the incorporated Settlements (1824 to 1830), recorded that, under the Dutch Government in Malacca, services were required and labour exacted, from the tenants; that they were, in short, kept in a state of vassalage and servitude quite inconsistent with the encouragement of cultivation.*\n\nThe cultivator or tenant, who was thus liable to be required to work for the Government or superior proprietor, was the holder of the proprietary right which has already been described. In Malay States, the liability still exists, and, for the complete understanding of the ra'iyat's position, it is necessary to ascertain, as nearly as possible, what is the extent of his liability to forced service, how far it is an incident of his\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 740.\ntenure of his land, what is the mode of enforcing obedience, and what is the penalty for contumacy. With the exception of the extract at the head of the preceding chapter, I have met with no passage in Malay laws which affects these questions; there is no written definition of the nature and extent of the services which a Raja or Chief or superior proprietor can exact from the cultivator. In a Malay State, the exaction of personal service from the ra'iyat is limited only by the powers of endurance of the latter. The superior authority is obliged, from self-interest, to stop short of the point at which oppression will compel the cultivator to abandon his land and emigrate. But within this limit, the cultivator may be required to give his labour in making roads, bridges, drains, and other works of public utility, to tend elephants, to pole boats, to carry letters and messages, to attend his Chief when travelling, to cultivate his Chief's fields as well as his own, and to serve as a soldier when required.* Local custom often regulates the kind of service exacted from the\n\n* Raffles, writing to Lord Munro in 1811 on the disadvantages of allowing Siamese influence to preponderate in Kedah, thus describes the status of the Siamese peasant:\u2014 \"Both persons and property are at the command of the King, and, of course, at the command of his Officers in recession from the lowest to the highest; hence no man will rear what he cannot call his own. Certain months are allowed the many to plant and reap their paddy: and this when stored is sacred and cannot be taken from their possession; with this exception all the rest of their time, exertions, or acquirements may be taken by the King or his Officers if so inclined.\" Life of Raffles, p. 52.\n\nThe Burman seems to be little better off:\n\n\"Corv\u00e9es and enforced duties of all kinds are frequent, and the men selected for such service can only get off by furnishing a substitute or bribing the tithing-man. The King or some great man wants to build a pagoda, and orders are sent round to the various circles that they must furnish a regular supply of workers daily. The taik or myo-thoo-gyee draws up a roster, and each man has to go to work for a certain number of days. If he fail to go, he is tied up to a post or a tree and gets a sound flogging. Similar forced duties are the protection of the frontier and the pursuit of dacoits. Such work is particularly detested, for the men have to keep themselves supplied with food, or get their friends to bring it to them, and this is not always an easy matter. Besides, such service may last an indefinite time.\" The Burman, his Life and Notions, 1882. II, 262.\ncultivator in a particular district. Thus in Perak one district used to supply the Raja with timber for building purposes, while rattans and other materials came from others; the people of one locality used to furnish the musicians for the Raja's band, while another had to provide nurses and attendants for his children.* Speaking of Kedah, Colonel Low says: \"The ryot was obliged also to pay for keeping up bands of music and state elephants. His children were liable to be forcibly taken from him\u2014the girls for the seraglio, and the youths for public works or for war, where they got no pay and but precarious supplies of food.\"\u2020\n\nTennent describes \"feudal service\" as prevailing in its ampest details in the Eastern Province of Ceylon. \"According to the custom of the country, the chief of the district directs its cultivation by the villagers; they acknowledge his authority, and, so long as they live on the land, devote their whole time and labour to his service, receiving in return a division of the grain, a share of the milk from his cattle, and the certainty of support in periods of famine and distress. Their houses, gardens and wells, though built, planted and dug by themselves, are the property of the Chief, who alone can dispose of them.\"\n\nThese serfs, whilst they live on the land, are bound to perform every service for the lord of the soil, without pay; they fence his gardens, cover his houses, carry his baggage, perform the work of coolies in balams (canoes), fish for him, act as his messengers; and when absent from his village, they must provide food for himself and servants. They\n\n* \"It would be in vain to pretend to render an account of all the irregular contributions and requisitions to which a people are liable who labour under the evils of a rude and arbitrary Government. At festivals, at marriages and births, whether in the family of the Sovereign or of the Chief who presides over them, the cultivators are called upon for contributions. In the transportation of public property, or the conveyance of the minions of the court or its officers, in the repair or construction of roads, bridges, and other public works, the services of the people are exacted unmercifully, and without thanks or reward.\" Crawfurd\u2014Hist.

But as they seldom do change, it may safely be presumed that they are contented with the arrangement, and their healthy and pleasant faces sufficiently prove that they are well-fed and happy.\"*\n\nForced service in a Malay State, too, is not merely the result of the application of the law of the stronger; it is well understood to be an incident of the lot of the cultivator of land, he acquiesces in it as one of the conditions on which he holds his fields, and he usually submits quietly to the orders of his superiors until they reach the pitch of oppression at which he decides that emigration is preferable to slavery. He knows that, by emigrating, he will forfeit his land, and in fact it is at once seized by the Penghulu and held for the Raja.\n\nThe cultivator may perhaps receive forgiveness and the restitution of his fields if he returns and submits at some later time, but he will probably have to pay a fine if he is known to possess the means of doing so.\n\nNo incident of native rule has contributed so much to swell the Malay population of Penang and Province Wellesley as this. Kedah has been half denuded of its inhabitants, and Patani, Perlis, Situl, Trang, etc., have contributed numbers of emigrants anxious to escape the unjust exactions of native rulers. But when the system is worked with justice and moderation, there are seldom complaints from the people. In the Krian district of Perak, the people (many of them British subjects), under the orders of the Orang Kaya Mantri, made roads and canals without murmuring, and in the same district, after its cession to the British Government, there was no difficulty in turning out nearly a thousand men in 1874, to commence clearing a line through the forest for a proposed road.\u2020\n\nThe kerah, or forced levy of men for labour, is effected through the headmen of villages or districts. A Penghulu receives the orders of his Chief or Raja to have a certain number of men ready at a given time or place, and runs a risk of\n\n* Tennent's Ceylon, II, 459.\n\u2020 Government Gazette, Feb. 6th, 1875.\npunishment or disgrace if he does not do so. He fines those who disobey, and takes money from those who are able to purchase exemption, so he contrives usually to make the incident profitable to himself. The cultivator who has to leave his house and his fields at this bidding, has to find his own tools and food, which may involve the carrying of a heavy load to the place of work, and a good deal of expense or privation. The abolition of the cultivator's liability for personal service in Java* was one of the facts which Raffles took into consideration in deciding what proportion of his crop the cultivator should pay to the State by way of land-revenue.\u2020 That enlightened administrator was very far from thinking that forced service, as one of the incidents of native tenure, was to be abolished simply, without any consideration given to Government for the concession. It was never for a moment doubted that the right of the Government to exact personal service from the cultivator was inherent in the system under which he held his lands, and the same holds good in Malay countries also. The right of a Malay Raja or Chief to order his feudal inferior to perform reasonable services is indisputable, and the surrender of such a right is a perfectly legitimate consideration for demanding an enhanced land revenue or other equivalent.\n\n* \"The system of vassalage and forced deliveries has been abolished generally throughout the Island.\" Proclamation by Lieut.-Governor of Java, October 15th, 1813.\n\n\u2020 \"On mature consideration, and the best advice within my reach, I conceived that a fair equivalent for them, including the acknowledged Government share of the crop, the amount paid in personal taxes and on the internal trade, and the value of forced services, might be found, one district with another, in establishing the Government share, at about two-fifths of the rice-crop, leaving the second crop and the fruit-trees and gardens attached to the villages, free from assessment, the cultivator free from personal taxes, and the inland trade unrestricted and untaxed.\" Raffles' Minute on Java, 137.\n\n\"The peasant was subject to gross oppression and undefined exaction; our object was to remove his oppressor, and to limit demand to a fixed and reasonable rate of contribution. He was liable to restraints on the freedom of inland trade, to personal services and forced contingents: our object was to commute them all for a fixed and well-known contribution.\" History of Java, I, 154.\nWith the kerah system as practised in Malay States, it is interesting to compare the state of things which the English found in Java seventy years ago. A Dutch Commissioner, reporting on the province of Sourabaya in 1812, wrote as follows:\n\n\"The feudal service was as grievous as almost all the other charges united. The origin of these services must be sought for in the feudal system of the native Government long ago adopted throughout Java. It was considered that all the land was the property of the prince, who only made provisional assignments thereof to his subjects, in remuneration for military and other services rendered. This was the cause of all the lands being divided into as many allotments as could be cultivated, called chachus, each of a size to be cultivated by one man. A certain number of these was assigned to the different chiefs, according to his rank; the custom of the country fixing not only the amount of contributions to be paid from the produce, but the number of men to be constantly kept in attendance upon him. The lands thus assigned to chiefs were exempt from service to them, and the inhabitants were only expected to watch the villages, to make and repair the roads, and to perform other general services of the State. This was the situation of the people with regard to service, when the coast districts were first ceded to the European Government. The system of trade and fixed contributions did not admit of any change, and the services were at that time of very little consequence, and such as could be performed without oppression to the inhabitants: but the case is now quite different. Successively, and particularly of late years, much heavier services have been demanded than were ever before known, and it naturally follows, that the Javan must be kept more at work than before. Besides, it is not possible to apportion those services equally, on account of the situation of the places where the services are required, and because the chiefs, who have the direction of the works, from indifference or laziness, generally make a requisition on the nearest village; and it not unfrequently happens, that many people are thus taken for the public service, who have no lands whatever allotted to them.\"\n\"Were the requisitions made for the public service alone, it would still be comparatively nothing, it being admitted that the State has a right to the labour of its subjects, but the Regents, their relations, their Patehs, and the subordinate Chiefs of every description, assume the right of disposing of the services of the common people as they think proper, and themselves employ many of them in menial labour of all descriptions, from which it arises that the number of people employed away from their houses on what is called public services is almost incredible.\"\n\nForced labour is naturally hated by Malays and is evaded as much as possible. Travelling in the interior of Kedah, I have seen the Malay peasant running from his fields into the jungle at the sight of the Raja's elephants, lest he should be called upon to form one of the train. In Perak, the establishment of British influence has led to a general \"strike\" on the part of the peasantry against the system to which they formerly submitted peacefully. A Malay Raja in Perak, who in 1876 was able to supply me with the men of two or three villages in order to convey the baggage and stores of a detachment of troops from Blanja to Kinta, now finds it difficult to procure men to pole his own boat without paying them. Men required to perform work for the Government of the State, as at present constituted, are scrupulously paid, or provided with ample rations. In Malacca, the corv\u00e9e system has never been exercised under British rule, though it is, no doubt, an incident of native tenure, and, unless surrendered by Government for a money equivalent, might very reasonably be exacted for such purely local objects as repairing the dams and other native irrigation works which are necessary for the successful cultivation of the fields of a village or district,* building a balei\n\n* Compulsory labour was formerly an institution in Ceylon also:\u2014\"Another institution to the influence and operation of which the country was indebted for the construction of the works which diffused plenty throughout every region, was the system of Raja-kariya, by which the King had a right to employ, for public purposes, the compulsory labour of the inhabitants. To what extent this was capable of exaction, or under what safeguards it was enforced in early times, does not appear from the historical books. But on all occasions when tanks were to be formed or canals cut for irrigation, the Mahavanasa alludes almost in words of course\u2014to the application of Raja-kariya for their construction, the people being summoned to the task by beat of drum.\" TENNENT'S Ceylon, I, 427.\nor place of business for the use of the headman and elders of\nthe village, keeping pathways clear of jungle, etc., etc.*\nBut no words can be too strong to condemn the exactions\nof Malay Rajas, Chiefs and their followers in respect of\nthe family and personal property of the cultivator, which may\naffect any of his possessions, from his daughter to the vegeta-\nbles growing in his garden.\u2020 The goats, fowls, fruit, crops, etc.,\nof the unfortunate peasant whose hut and land are on the route\nfollowed by a Raja on his journey, are, under a native Govern-\nment, at the mercy of his rapacious followers; gajah lalu\norang buat layu, \"the elephant passes by, but men bring\n\n* So, in England, the oath of fealty is still an incident of the tenure of cer-\ntain estates in land, though seldom or never exacted in practice.\n\n\u2020 \"The proprietors of the pusakas have also a claim to the services of the cul-\ntivators; a certain number of them are always in attendance at the houses\nof their Chiefs, and on journeys are employed in carrying their persons and\nbaggage. The lands not pusaka used to pay the same proportion of produce\nto the Sultan as the others did to the proprietors; but the cultivators of the\nroyal dominions laboured under greater disadvantages than the others.\nEvery Chief or favourite about Court had authority to employ them in the\nmost menial offices, and Chiefs possessing pusakas often spared their own\npeople, and employed the others. Report on Bantam\u2014RAFFLES' History of\nJava, I, 150.\n\n\"It may be very desirable that I should mention a few of the oppressions\nfrom which it is the object of the present system to relieve the people. I\ncannot but consider the greatest of these\u2014the extent of the personal service\ndemanded not only by the Tomunggong and his family, but the Mantris and\nall the petty Chiefs, who had trains of followers that received no stipendiary\nrecompense. These added to the individuals employed in the coffee-planta-\ntions (to which they appear peculiarly averse), in beating out rice for the\ncontingent, in cutting grass for and attending the jayang sekars (native\nmilitia), post carriage and letter-carriers, may be calculated to have em-\nployed one-fifth of the male population of the working men. Another great\nsource of exaction was the large unwieldy establishment of jayang sekars,\nand police officers: the former were liberally paid, the latter had no regular\nemoluments. Both these classes, however, quartered themselves freely in\nwhatever part of the country their functions demanded their attendance.\nThis was equally the case with any of the Regent's family or petty Chiefs\nwho travelled for pleasure or on duty. Whatever was required for themselves\nand their followers, was taken from the poor inhabitants who have now been\nso long accustomed to such practices that they never dare to complain or to\nremonstrate. The European authority did not escape the taint of corruption.\nMonopolies, unpaid services, licences, forced or at least expected presents,\nwere but too common even in the best times, and must have contributed to\nestrangle the affections and respect of the natives from that power which\nshould have afforded them protection.\" Report on Pasuruan\u2014Id.\na blight,\" is a significant saying in Perak and sufficiently denotes the effect of royal progresses from the villager's point of view. The practice of the Malay peasant, which must be well known to British officials who have worked in Malay districts, of bringing some simple offering, such as a fowl or two, or a basket of fruit or vegetables, when he presents himself before his superior with some request or application, has its origin in this custom. Such a present is expected in a State under native Government, and a man has small chance of a favourable hearing who comes empty-handed. It is satisfactory to observe the gradual disappearance of the practice of offering such presents, however trifling, for it is a testimony of the general acceptance by the people of the fact that, far from being expected or exacted, they are not even accepted under British administration.\n\nBefore quitting the subject of forced service, it may be useful to notice that Sir Stamford Raffles maintained the right of the renters of Government estates to require the cultivators to perform certain duties, but he stipulated that in such case they should be paid. The following paragraph occurs in his minute of June 14th, 1813:\n\n\"It will necessarily form a part of the arrangement to be concluded, that the renters shall engage to keep the roads and bridges in repair (with the exception of the great military road) and also to furnish labourers, carriages, etc., when required for the public service: but I propose that, on these occasions, the persons so furnished be regularly paid for, at the rate to be established in the leases of each district. This arrangement is, indeed, absolutely necessary if it were only to place in the hands of Government the means of checking the employment of people, on the various pretexts of official establishment, on the public service. At present there exists no check; and as the people so furnished by the Regents, under the existing system, ought to be paid by a proportion of land, it follows either that they are not paid for their labour, or that the Regent is obliged to give up to them a portion of that land, from which he would derive a revenue, and for which, it is naturally to be expected, he will make a proportionate exaction elsewhere. As the whole lands will now be rented\n\"indiscriminately, this fund ceases, and the additional land thus\nto be rented, instead of furnishing a fund for the payment of\npersons employed in the public service, will provide the source\nof Revenue from whence such persons will be paid, while the\nexamination of the public disbursements will effectually pre-\nvent unauthorised employment of individuals on the public\naccount.\"\n\nIn Java, it would appear from the following extract,* the\nDutch Government proceeds on the principle of requiring that\nall labour which may be legally exacted should be paid for in\nfull:\n\n\"Forced Labour.\u2014Besides the ordinary day labourers, the\nlandlord, whether Government or a private land-owner, is fur-\nther entitled to require the cottiers on his estate to work for\nhim as much as he pleases, but only on the condition of paying\neach man the highest agricultural wages of the district. This\nis the only real forced labour in Java, and the only point on\nwhich the land-owner there has any but a strictly limited power\nover the cottier peasantry on his estate. The labour rent\u2020\nextending all over the island causes no perceptible dissatisfa-\ntion, but the forced labour beyond the one-tenth excites bitter\nfeelings if persisted in. Both the labour rent and the forced\nlabour are applied, on private estates, to the cultivation of\nthose crops which the landowner is growing on the spare land\nfor his own profit, except so much of the labour as is required\nfor the gardos, and for the maintenance of the roads near the\nestate, both which the landlords have to keep up from the\nlabour rent.\n\nThe cottier peasant is carefully guarded from extortion by\nhis landlord, but bound to pay his landlord's share of the pro-\nduce of the land; his subordinate rights in his holding are\nprotected, but kept subject to his landlord's paramount right\nto the soil; and he is practically freed from oppression, though\nsubject to have his labour utilized by his landlord. By these\nmeans the cottier tenant's interests are secured, and he soon\nbecomes rich, from the large surplus produce of his holding\nafter paying his landlord's one-fifth. By the same provisions\n\n* Money's Java, II, 219.\n\u2020 The obligation of the peasant to give one day's gratuitous work in seven.\nthe land-owner is invested with sufficient power over his whole estate to enable him to turn the remainder of his land to the most profitable use it is fitted for. After having thus carefully regulated the respective rights of landlord and tenant, the Dutch are wise enough to abstain from further interference, beyond seeing that the legal conditions are fulfilled. If a land-owner chooses to exact forced labour from his cottiers, and thereby to create discontent among them, the Dutch officials do not envenom this feeling by issuing injudicious proclamations of abstract rights for the cottiers, or of remonstrance with the land-owner. They take care that the land-owner complies with the law, by paying the highest agricultural wages for such forced labour, and they meet the peasant\u2019s complaint by saying that the land-owner is only exercising his right, in a manner of which he is sole judge, and that the cottiers must either submit or withdraw from the estate.\n\nChapter VIII.\n\nTRANSFER BY SALE AND MORTGAGE.\n\n\"Land,\" says Marsden, \"is so abundant in proportion to the population, that they (the Malays of Sumatra) scarcely consider it as the subject of right, any more than the elements of air and water: excepting so far as in speculation the prince lays claim to the whole. The ground, however, on which a man plants or builds, with the consent of his neighbours, becomes a species of nominal property, and is transferable;*\n\n* In Burma \"all owners exercise the right of sale, lease, gift and mortgage, though sale outright is very seldom made. There appears to be an objection to it, which may almost be called religious, irrespective of the rights of heirs, which cannot be alienated; and when land is sold by deed, it is generally expressed that the object of the purchaser is to build a pagoda or other religious edifice thereon. This is supposed to justify the sale. Rice land is occasionally let from year to year on verbal agreement, the tenant agreeing to pay ten per cent. of the produce.\" Sir Arthur Phayre, before the Society of Arts, May, 1881.\nbut as it costs him nothing, beside his labour, it is only the produce which is esteemed of value, and the compensation he receives is for this alone. A temporary usufruct is accordingly all that they attend to, and the price, in case of sale, is generally ascertained by the cocoa-nut, durian, and other fruit-trees that have been planted on it; the buildings being for the most part, but little durable. Whilst any of these subsist, the descendants of the planter may claim the ground, though it has been for years abandoned. If they are cut down, he may recover damages; but if they have disappeared in the course of nature the land reverts to the public.*\n\nIn Celebes, in Bali, and in that ill-peopled portion of Java called the country of the Sundas, the cultivator is invested with a kind of proprietary right. By sufferance he can bequeath, alienate, or mortgage his little tenement.\u2020\n\nAmong them (the Sundanese), private property in the soil is generally established; the cultivator can transmit his possession to his children. Among them it can be sub-divided without any interference on the part of a superior; the possessor can sell his interest in it to others, and transfer it by gift or covenant. He pays to his Chief a certain proportion of the produce, in the same manner as the other inhabitants of Java: because in a country without trade or manufactures, labour or produce is the only shape in which he can contribute to support the necessary establishments of the community. So long as he advances this tribute, which is one-tenth or one-fifth of the gross produce, he has an independent right to the occupancy of his land and the enjoyment of the remainder.* * * *\n\nThe situation, however, of the cultivator in the Sunda districts, who is a proprietor, is not much more eligible than that of the tenant of the Government: he may, it is true, alienate or transfer his lands, but while he retains them, he is liable to imposts almost as great as they can bear; and when he transfers them, he can therefore expect little for surrendering to another the privilege of reaping from his\n\n* History of Sumatra, 244.\n\u2020 Crawfurd\u2014Hist. Ind. Arch., III, 53.\nown soil, what is only the average recompense of labour expended on the estate of another.\"*\n\nIn the first of the above extracts, Marsden, with his usual accuracy, describes the chief incidents of the land tenure of the Malays, as they exist among the people of the Peninsula as well as among those of Sumatra; and it is subsequently shewn that among the Sundanese in the west of Java\u2014a people who in their customs and language bear a much nearer resemblance to the Malays than do the people of any other part of Java\u2014those incidents which have relation to the alienation of land are almost identical with those which obtain among the Malays. I am inclined to think that the superior permanency of the tenure of the Sundanese, when compared with that of the Javanese, is to be accounted for by a Malay origin, and that it is unnecessary to argue, with Raffles, that it is a mere survival in a remote district of a more liberal system, which once prevailed generally in the island, but which was destroyed by the rapacity of Muhammadan sovereigns. Malays, too, have had for centuries Muhammadan Rajas, not less given to encroachment upon the rights of individuals than those of Java; yet the Malay peasant has retained his proprietary right, and I believe that, both in Malay countries and in Sunda, this has been due to a national feeling or instinct on this subject, not to be found among the Javanese, who, under native rule, were serfs without proprietary interest in the land which they cultivated.\n\nThe power of alienation is one of the most important privileges connected with land that a land-holder can exercise, but it is only the result of an advanced and liberal recognition on the part of the governing power, of the rights of the subject. It must not be forgotten that, even in England, it was not until the Statute of Quia emptores was passed, in the reign of Edward I, that tenants in fee simple obtained the right of alienating their lands at their pleasure, and that the right of devising lands by will only dates from the reign of Henry VIII.\u2020\n\n* Raffles\u2014History of Java, I, 140.\n\u2020 \"We are too apt to forget that property in land as a transferable, marketable commodity, absolutely owned and passing from hand to hand like any chattel, is not an ancient institution, but a modern development reached only in a few very advanced countries. In the greater part of the world,\nIt is not to be expected that among the Malays the system of alienation, or the effect of a transfer, should quite correspond with any European system, and it is necessary to be cautious in supposing that when land in a Malay State is said to have been bought or sold, the transaction has been similar to the purchase or sale of land in British territory, either in the mode in which it has been conducted, or in its practical operation. Crawfurd, it will have been noticed, says that the Sundanese cultivator is allowed to alienate his land \"by sufferance;\" and Marsden points out that the usufruct is all that a Malay has and all that he can dispose of.\n\nWhen Captain Low, in describing land tenure in Kedah, says that land granted by the Raja \"could not be alienated\" it must not be supposed that the right of occupancy could not in general be the subject of a bargain there. Captain Low quotes extracts from the Undang-Undang Kedah (Laws of Kedah) in which occur the two following sections:\n\n\"When a garden is to be sold, the trees are to be estimated at \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a dollar each and the amount will be the price of the land.\"\n\n\"What the Raja has given no one can take away, nor can any one sell land so given without the Raja's concurrence.\"\n\nThe first of these rules exactly coincides with what Marsden describes, as regards the interest in the land which passes by sale in Sumatra, and with Raffles' estimate of what the Sundanese peasant has a right to expect on the surrender of his\n\n---\n\n*See supra, p. 79.\n\n\u2020 Powerful as the Zamindar became in managing the land, in grasping and in ousting, he had no power (in Bengal before 1793) of alienating his estate; he could not raise money on it by mortgage, nor sell the whole or any part of it. This clearly appears from a proclamation issued on 1st August, 1786: the illegal practice of 'alienating revenue lands' is complained of: 'the gentlemen appointed to superintend the various districts are invited zealously to prevent the commission of the offence:' and the Zamindar, Chaudhuri, Taluqdar, or other land-holder who disobeys, is threatened with dispossession from his lands.\" Land Revenue and Land Tenures of India.\u2014Baden-Powell, p. 221.\nproprietary right to a transferee. It may be clearly laid down that the Malay cultivator can transfer only the interest in the land which he himself possesses; that that interest, as already shewn, is merely a permanent and inheritable right of occupation, conditional on the continuous occupation of the land on the payment of tenths and taxes, and on the rendering of certain customary services; and that the price to be paid has no reference to the value of the land itself (for, in a primitive state of society, that has little intrinsic value), but is calculated, if garden land, by estimating the value of the fruit-trees, or, if padi land, by assessing at a reasonable sum the probable value of the labour bestowed by the first cultivator in clearing the forest and bringing the field into cultivation.\n\nI have had opportunities of observing the Malay customs relating to the sale and mortgage of land in operation in purely native districts, having been deputed in 1874 to take over the territory on the left bank of the Krian river, then recently ceded by Perak to the British Government, and having since then served for some years as Assistant Resident in the Native State of Perak. I am, therefore, able to speak with some confidence upon the laws and customs which have come under my personal observation in actual practice.\n\nThe technical term used in Perak for the transfer of land by sale is pulang b\u00e9lanja (return of expenses), which sufficiently indicates that the money paid is not a price set upon the land itself, but the recoupment of the outlay incurred by the vendor in bringing it into cultivation. The new proprietor, in fact, does not buy the land; he simply buys out the occupier by compensating him for his labour, that being the factor which originally created the tenancy, and thus obtains the right to stand in his place. It is manifest that he will not pay a long price for a mere right of occupancy weighted by the incidents and liabilities above described; in Krian, in 1874, it was difficult to get ten dollars an orlong for excellent padi land by pulang b\u00e9lanja, but when security of tenure and the full right of alienation of the soil were introduced in the district by the British Government, it became possible to sell the same land for $60 or $70 an orlong.\n\nSo in the case of land on which fruit-trees are growing.\nNot long after the P\u00earak war it became necessary to acquire the piece of land at Kuala Kangsa, in Perak, on which the British Residency now stands. The bargain was effected in strict accordance with Malay law, and the sum which was paid was calculated as the value of the fruit-trees and houses standing on the land. It was clearly understood on both sides that the soil was vested in the State, and that all that the proprietor could dispose of was the proprietary right; the transaction was strictly one of pulang b\u00ealanja. Speaking of this purchase to Raja Muda Yusuf at Sayong soon afterwards, I was asked by him in a pointed manner whether the late proprietor had sold me the land; the explanation that the proprietor had merely been compensated for her interest in the land, namely, her trees and houses, quite satisfied him and others that Malay custom had been observed, and that the rights of the Raja or State had not been invaded by an undue claim, on the part of a subject, to the soil. This principle has always been recognised in all sales of land in Malay districts in Perak which have come under my notice. But the Malay cultivator is always ready to claim from British officers, whom he may think likely to be ignorant of the real conditions of native land tenure, a larger interest than Malay law gives him, in fact, as large an interest as can be conceded. The official who hears the words \"sell\" (jual) and \"buy\" (h\u00eali) used in connection with the transfer of land under native tenure, is apt to conclude that a title to the soil has been passed by the transaction, and he very possibly recognises, or allows to be recognised in a general way, this view of the matter, and so people get to believe, or are allowed to assert, that their position in respect to the State is something quite different from what it really is. This, though it may cause embarrassment in administering the land-revenue of a district, cannot, of course, affect the legal status of the cultivator, for ignorant administration of the law does not alter the law itself. Nothing can be more certain than the fact that no subject in a Malay State can lawfully claim to hold any property in land approaching our freehold or fee simple tenure.\n\nAs the Malay pulang b\u00ealanja differs widely from our idea of a sale of land, so the jual janji (conditional sale), the only\nform of hypothecation of land known to Malay law, is, in its principal incidents, quite unlike our mortgage of real property.*\n\nThe Malay who raises money on his holding by the transaction called *jual janji*, sells his proprietary right for a sum then and there advanced to him, and surrenders the land to the vendee, coupling, however, the transfer with the condition that if, at any time, or within a certain time, he shall repay to the vendee the sum so advanced, he (the vendor) shall be entitled to take back his land. This transaction differs from our mortgage in the facts:\u2014(1) that no property in the soil passes, but merely the proprietary right; (2) that possession is actually given to the person who advances the money.\n\nIt frequently happens that the conditional vendor (the debtor) wishes to retain possession of the land during the period of his indebtedness, and, if so, this is arranged by his becoming the tenant of the conditional vendee (the creditor). The rent in money or kind which he pays, or which some other tenant pays if the land is not let to the conditional vendor, or the profit which the conditional vendee derives from cultivating the land himself if he does not let it, takes the place of interest, which is not charged, usury being condemned by Muhammadan law.\n\nIf a term is mentioned within which the money must be repaid, and the condition of repayment is not fulfilled within the appointed period, the sale becomes absolute (*putus*) and the vendee takes the full rights of proprietorship. But even\n\n---\n\n* In China, \"a mortgagee must actually enter into possession of the property and make himself personally responsible for the payment of the taxes, before his mortgage is valid: unless explicitly stated, the land can be deemed at any time within thirty years on payment of the original sum. Secs. 90 to 100 of the Code contain the laws relating to this subject, some of which bear a resemblance to those established among the Hebrews and intended to secure a similar object of retaining the land in the same class or tribe.\" \u2014 *The Middle Kingdom*, Williams, II, 100.\n\n\"Land under Burman rule was never sold in the usual acceptation of the term. It was frequently conveyed for a price from one person to another, and though the transaction was styled a sale, and not a mortgage, it was fully understood that the vendor retained a right to repurchase the land at any time he liked, and that the emptor could not re-sell the land without the consent of the original vendor.\" \u2014 *British Burma Gazetteer*, Vol. I, p. 438\nthen the payment of the money at some later time would, in most cases, be sufficient to enable the conditional vendor to regain his land from a stranger under purely native rule. If no term is fixed, the money may be paid at any time, but until it is paid, the conditional vendee is entitled to retain possession of the land and to cultivate it, or let it, at his pleasure. A short document is generally drawn up in evidence of the transaction, but these are often so loosely or informally worded that the proof of the existence of the condition rests principally upon the good faith of the parties. Sometimes there is no written agreement at all.\n\nTransactions of this nature necessarily led to the investigations of many disputed claims when the rights of the native land-holders in Krian were being settled (see supra, p. 121). The rise in the value of land occasioned by the establishment of British rule resulted in a general rush for possession, men who had long since sold their fields by pulang belanja coming forward to declare that the sale was merely conditional, while in other instances conditional vendees in possession were equally ready to declare that the transaction which gave them their right was jual putus, an absolute sale, not jual janji, a conditional one.\n\nThe native laws contain some curious provisions on the subject of hypothecation, a specimen of which relating to real property may be consulted in the Appendix, p. xv. In all, the peculiar principle of the Malay mortgage, namely, the handing over to the creditor of the property on which the money is advanced, is fully recognised.\n\nChapter VIII.\n\nINHERITANCE.\n\nAmong the Malays, the distribution of the property of deceased persons is governed either by Muhammadan law, or by national custom, or partly by one and partly by the other,\ne.g., the real property by customary law and the personal property by Muhammadan law.\n\nThere are Malay treatises on the Muhammadan law of inheritance (*faraiz*), in accordance with the rules of which it is common to apportion the estate of an intestate. But there are reasons which often make it clear to the Malay mind that land is a species of property, the transmission of which should be in accordance with the national customary law (*hukum adat*) rather than with that of the Koran (*hukum shar'a*). For instance, the wife of a Malay cultivator will generally share in the toil of cultivation; indeed the planting and reaping of paddy is performed almost entirely by women, although the ploughing and harrowing fall to the lot of the men. In respect, therefore, of the crop, which is harvested as the result of these joint labours, the husband and wife are co-partners (*sharikat*) and this is often the case with regard to the land itself. Under such circumstances, in case of the death of the husband, it would be manifestly unjust to distribute the joint property as his estate under Muhammadan law. The joint property must be equally divided, and the share of the wife having been allotted to her, the share of the deceased husband may, if desired, be distributed in accordance with the Muhammadan law of inheritance. This is only the rightful due of the wife, who, properly speaking, is entitled to be maintained by her husband in a manner befitting his station in life without performing any labour.\n\nI think that it will be generally found that, in the Malay States, the property of the trading class\u2014goods, merchandise, shops, ships, &c.\u2014are distributed according to Muhammadan law, while the agricultural class cling with tenacity to their old customs, and insist that their lands at least, and often the whole of their property, shall descend in accordance with the old Malay law which has come down to them from their forefathers.\n\nThis customary law varies very much according to locality, individual States having often regulations peculiar to them alone.\n\n---\n\n*\u0641\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0636*, plural of *\u0641\u0631\u0636\u0647*, from *\u0641\u0631\u0636* to cut. (Arabic.)\nCRAWFORD mentions the subject very briefly:\u2014\u201cWhere there is a right of private property in land, or at least the usufruct of it, there is generally a community of goods among the members of a family. It is held in the name of the father or elder male of the family, and hence, by the customs of the greater number of the tribes, the father, or nearest of kin, is answerable for the debts of all the members of a family. I can nowhere discover in any of the collections of native laws which have fallen into my hands, that the right of devising property by will had any existence among the tribes of the Indian Islands.\u201d*\n\nThis recognition of a superior right in the eldest male of a family and the tendency of the Malays to confine the right of succession to land to the tribe to which the deceased owner belonged, is found in the law of the Chinese also: \u201cThe paternal estate and the houses upon it descend to the eldest son, but his brothers can remain upon it with their families, and devise their portion in perpetuo to their children, or an amicable composition can be made; daughters never inherit, nor can an adopted son of another clan succeed.\u201d\u2020\n\nMARSDEN, writing of the law of inheritance among the people of Pasummah in Sumatra, says:\n\n\u201cIf a person dies having children, these inherit his effects in equal portions and become answerable for the debts of the deceased. If any of his brothers survive, they may be permitted to share with their nephews, but rather as a matter of courtesy than right and only when the effects of the deceased devolved to him from his father or grandfather. If he was a man of rank, it is common for the son who succeeds him in title to have a larger share. This succession is not confined to the eldest born, but depends much on private agreement in the family. If the deceased person leaves no kindred behind him, the tribe to which he belonged shall inherit his effects and be answerable for his debts.\u201d\u2021\n\n* CRAWFORD\u2014Hist. Ind.

A similar custom prevails in the Eastern Province of Ceylon and in parts of India, and there is a Sinhalese legend, not unlike the Malay one, explanatory of its origin.* This custom is still observed in the district of Naning in the interior of Malacca, and in Rambau, Sungei Ujong and the Negri Sambilan.\n\nThe Perak custom differs from this. In that State the lands and houses of the deceased descend to his daughters equally, while the sons divide the personal property. The latter are supposed to be able to create landed estates for themselves, by clearing and planting land which they may select, or, at all events, to obtain the use of land by marrying women who may have inherited it.\n\nHowever, the more active of the Muhammadan priests and mosque officials, especially if they be foreigners and not Perak Malays, endeavour, as far as they can, to get the Muhammadan law of inheritance adopted, to the exclusion of the local custom. The older men are more conservative. From information supplied by an old Imam up the country, I learn that the principle of distribution practised in his district is as follows:\n\n\"If a man dies without children, leaving a widow, his property is divided between her and the waris of the deceased.\"\n\n\"If he leaves a wife and children, the property is, in the first instance, divided into two equal shares, one of which goes to the waris of the deceased and the other is again sub-divided into four parts, one of which (one-eighth of the whole) goes to the widow and the other three (three-eighths) are divided among the children.\"\n\n\"If there are children of both sexes, the three-eighths above-mentioned are divided into four portions, of which three go\n\n* Tennent's Ceylon, II, 458.\n\"to the son or sons, and the remaining one to the daughter or daughters.\"\n\nIt will be apparent that there is very little genuine Muhammadan law in all this. Under that system, the widow does not get a half under any circumstances. It is not clear who are the waris, or heirs, who take one-half of an estate to the exclusion of the widow and children. Perhaps it is meant that one-half is set apart in the first place to meet funeral expenses and the claims of persons entitled to share under Muhammadan law, among whom the children would be included. The same authority has supplied me with the following note on the customary law of inheritance practised in parts of Perak:\n\n\"Upon the death of a man possessed of property, his plantations, houses and padi-fields go to his daughters, while his other property, such as cattle, buffaloes, goats, elephants, &c., are divided into four shares: three of these go to the sons and the fourth is devoted to the cost of the funeral feasts. If there is no land or house, the daughters share in the personal property equally with the sons.\"\n\n\"If a woman who has inherited land or house property marries and then dies without leaving a child, the property goes to her waris and not to her husband. If she leaves issue, the inheritance goes to the child or children.\"\n\n\"Property which has been acquired by the joint earnings of the husband and wife must, upon the death of either of them, be divided. The funeral expenses must be deducted before division. The remainder must be divided equally in two shares, one of which goes to the survivor and the other to the children or waris of the deceased.\"\n\n\"The shares of infant children are held in trust for them by the waris of a deceased parent, until they come of age.\"\n\nThe descent of landed property in Perak to the female issue and its restitution to the family if an heiress dies childless, illustrate in a striking manner the tribal instinct of the Malays and the tendency to keep property in a particular family, group or tribe.\n\nEven the wild tribes of the Peninsula have their rules of inheritance. Favre, writing of the Jakuns, says: \"After the\ndeath of parents the whole of their property will be divided amongst all the children in equal parts.\" *\n\nIn Siam, according to Colonel Low, \u2020 \"the property of an intestate person, should he leave no legal heirs, escheats to the King, who generally contrives to get a portion of the estate of every person deceased. Wills are written or made verbally, in the presence of competent witnesses; and may not be confounded with alienation by gift. Real and personal property may be willed and gifted away to any one, and, as hereditaments, descend to, and are without distinction divided amongst, the heirs at law. The laws of inheritance are considered as applying chiefly to heads of families.\n\nUnder this view, the property of a man deceased is divided into three portions. One goes to the parents and grandparents, one to the widow, and the third to the children and other relations on the man's side according to priority. But should the man not have cohabited so long as three years with his wife, she will only receive one-third of a portion or part.\"\n\nThe distribution of the property takes effect after the solemnization of the obsequies; and should a claimant, having the power and opportunity so to do, neglect to put in his claim previous to the termination of the obsequies, he forfeits his right.\n\nA person claiming inheritance must personally appear; substitutes being inadmissible. Heirs to property must assist at and bear their share of the charge for obsequies, exceptions being made for those who cannot, from the nature of circumstances, be present.\n\nBefore property is divided, the debts of the deceased are to be punctually paid, and competent witnesses must be present at the division. It does not appear that any distinction is drawn betwixt property of which a female may be possessed, and that left by a man: both are divided on similar principles. The eldest child, whether male or female, gets the largest share. Should the individual have no parents,\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 269.\n\u2020 Id., I, 344.\n\"grandparents or great-grandparents living, then the portion,\n\"or one-third of the real and personal property which such\npersons would have otherwise taken is divided equally and\nadded to the two remaining portions, the form of first sepa-\nrating the estate into three parts being always adhered to.\nThe same principle regulates the division where there are no\nclaimants to either of the other two shares.\"\n\nWith this description, and with the customs of the Malays\nas to succession, it is interesting to compare the laws of another\nIndo-Chinese kingdom\u2014Cambodia. I take the following\naccount from a recent French work:\u2014\n\n\"Property in land does not exist in Cambodia, for, as is\nwell known, the State is the absolute proprietor of the soil.\nNevertheless, the enjoyment of lands is left to those who\nclear them and employ them for some specific cultivation,\nrice in particular. It happens also, sometimes, that the first\noccupiers are dispossessed without a word of warning, with-\nout the excuse of public interest and simply in order that\nsome one may help himself to a field quite fit for cultiva-\ntion.\"\n\n\"The fortune of a Cambodian is composed of moveable and\nimmovable property, land excepted. Generally speak-\ning, even the richest have not much money, but they own\nboats, elephants, horses, cattle, buffaloes, which they hire\nout; they have sometimes a large number of slaves whom\nthey employ at home either on the products which they cul-\ntivate or in all kinds of commercial and industrial underta-\nkings. Money is lent out at high rates of interest, but it is\nliable to catastrophes.\"\n\n\"The goods of a Cambodian who dies a widower and with-\nout children, go all to the State, that is to the King. If he\nleaves daughters only, the Government takes half of the\nproperty and divides the other half among them. If they\nare of tender age, the goods are deposited with their grand-\nfather who becomes their guardian.\"\n\n\"When the Government is a creditor of the deceased, the\nKing causes the whole of the debt to be exacted first of all\n\n*Moura\u2014Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 347.*\n\"from the assets, and the balance, if any, is divided among the heirs.\"\n\n\"When the head of a family dies leaving several wives and several children, the child or children by whom he has been more exclusively nursed during his illness share the fortune according to the rank of their mother. For this purpose, the property is divided into seven parts; out of these, the son of the third wife has one, that of the second wife two, and that of the first, four. If these ladies have several children, the distribution is made, all the same, according to the proportion just mentioned. Children who are absent at the time of the sickness and death of their father lose a portion of their rights to the inheritance.\"\n\n\"If there are no children, the first wife keeps all the goods and the family remains united. Were the second and third wife to wish to leave the house before the conclusion of the mourning, that is to say, within three years, they would have the right to do so, but on the condition of renouncing their share of the inheritance. After the three years, if the widows separate, the property is divided among them according to the rule laid down for their children, when they have any, that is to say, the first has four shares, the second, two and the third, one.\"\n\n\"The widows of the same husband may marry again after three years of mourning; the second and third have not got to pay anything to the State for this, but the first wife, if she marry again and be without children by her first husband, must first surrender half of her fortune for the benefit of the royal treasury. If she does not marry again the Government takes the whole at her death.\"\n\n\"An adopted son renounces the right of inheriting from his real parents and cannot be sued for debts which they may have contracted in their lifetime. If the head of a family, after having adopted a child, becomes himself the father of a legitimate child, the adopted son does not lose all hope of inheriting, for the law gives him equal rights with the children of the full blood.\"\n\n\"Children, who, at the time of the death of their father, are in the special service of the King, have a right to three and a half shares of the inheritance.\"\n\"In case a husband, on account of the barrenness of his first wife, marries another who bears him a son, this latter is the sole heir of his father and he provides, after the death of the latter, for the support of the first widow and his own mother.\"\n\n\"The law of the Hindus sanctions similarly the right of the eldest son to the greater part of the patrimony of the father and mother. 'The eldest of the family,' says the law, 'if he be virtuous, may take possession of the whole of his patrimony of the father and mother, and the other brothers must live under his guardianship as they live under that of their father.'\"\n\n\"Generally, in India, distribution used to be made in the following way: the eldest had a double share, the second a share and a half, and the other brothers a single share respectively. The brothers gave to their sisters by the same mother a quarter of their shares to help them to establish themselves.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter IX.\n\nNATIVE TENURE UNDER EUROPEAN RULE.\nINDIA, BURMA, JAVA, CEYLON.\n\nINDIA.\n\nA wholesale modification of the systems of land tenure of ancient and highly civilised communities in British India by the introduction of English law would obviously have been unwise. It has always been the object of British Administrators in that country to recognise native laws and customs relating to the tenure of land, and, in elaborating Revenue systems, to secure that the regulations laid down shall give due effect to every class of interest in land known to native laws. It has been gradually ascertained in the various pro-\nvinces what are the different degrees of right of occupants and proprietors and each interest has received definition in the Land Acts passed from time to time for particular provinces, divisions or districts. In such Acts, the terminology used in describing tenures, classes of proprietors, and occupants, documents evidencing title, and rents and other payments, is largely borrowed from the native languages. The use of terms which have a technical meaning in English law is thus avoided.\n\nSpeaking generally, the ra'iyat is the owner of his holding, subject to the payment of the assessed land revenue. No documentary evidence of title is necessary, though in some provinces he holds a patta, or official statement of the facts of his holding or assessment. His rights are alienable and heritable, but all transfers have to be registered.\n\nRevenue systems vary in different parts of India; there are practically two. The first contemplates settlement with a middleman; and the second, dealing with the individual cultivator direct\u2014(the ra'iyat-w\u0101ri system). The Government may, in point of fact, either deal with a whole village at once through representative headmen, or may make a settlement of each individual holding.\n\nIn the latter case the settlement of a district is based upon a survey, the soil of every field is classified with a view to ascertaining the proper rate of assessment to be imposed, and eventually settlement records are made up, which include a register shewing the name of the occupant of every surveyed allotment.\n\nIn such a system, there is no place for English documents of title, and the tenure is none the less certain and secure because it is not supported by parchment and sealing-wax. The ra'iyat's name is down in the register of the village to which he belongs, and the extent of his land and the annual assessment which he has to pay are there recorded. The village records and the evidence of the headmen and villagers are at hand to support him if his right of occupancy is impugned.\n\n\"In Bombay (just as in Madras) the occupant holds on 'the simple terms of paying the revenue; if he admits that 'he is (or is proved by a decree of a Court to be) holding\n\"on behalf of some one else, as a tenant, or in an inferior position, then the 'superior holder's' name is entered in the register, not his: he becomes the 'inferior holder,' and it is the superior who is entered in the register as the 'occupant' responsible for the assessed sum. Any one who is recorded as the responsible holder can simply resign (if he does not like to pay the assessment) any field in his holding. The assessment is fixed for a period of thirty years, so that a man who elects to hold continuously, knows for certain that during that long period, all the profit he can make will go to him.\"\n\n\"At the beginning of each year, he can signify to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r (or local revenue officer of a taluk sub-division) what fields he wishes to hold, and what he wishes to give up; as long as he does this in proper time, he is free to do as he pleases. If he relinquishes, the fields are available for any one else; if no one applies for them, they are usually auctioned as fallow (for the right of grazing) for the year, and so on, till some one offers to take them up for cultivation. Nothing whatever is said in the Revenue Code about the person in possession (on his own account) being 'owner' in the western sense. He is simply called the 'occupant,' and the Code says what he can do and what he cannot. The occupant may do anything he pleases to improve the land, but may not, without permission, do anything which diverts the holding from agricultural purposes. He has no right to mines or minerals.\"\n\n\"These are the facts of the tenure; you may theorise on them as you please; you may say this amounts to proprietorship, or this is a dominium minus plenum, or anything else.\"\n\n\"The question of tenancy is just as simply dealt with. I have stated that, if it appears that the occupant is in possession in behalf of some one else, that some one else is recorded as the 'superior holder,' and he becomes the 'inferior holder.'\"\n\n\"What sort of 'inferior'\u2014whether a tenant or on some other terms\u2014is a simple question of fact and of the agreement or the custom by which he holds.\"\n\"If an occupant dies, one (the eldest or responsible) heir must be entered as the succeeding occupant who has to pay the revenue, for there can only be one registered revenue-payer for each field with a separate survey number, though, of course, there may be several sharers (joint heirs of the deceased owner, for instance) in a number. Which of them is so entered, depends, of course, on consent, or on the result of a Court decree, if there is a dispute.\"\n\n\"Sharers can always get their shares partitioned and assessed separately, as long as there is no dispute as to what the shares are.\"*\n\nThe advantages enjoyed by the occupant of land under the survey settlement are:\n\n1st.\u2014Fixity of tenure conditional on the due payment of the Government demand.\n\n2ndly.\u2014His occupation is heritable and transferable by gift, sale, or mortgage, without other restriction than the requirement to give notice to the authorities.\n\n3rdly.\u2014His assessment is fixed, but subject to revision after periods of thirty years. The right of occupancy is not affected by the expiration of a term of settlement, being conditional solely on the payment of the assessment imposed.\n\n4thly.\u2014He is at liberty to resign his entire occupancy, or any recognised share or part of it defined by the survey in any year, provided notice be given by a fixed date. If waste land be available, he may enlarge his holding at pleasure on application to the district officials.\n\n5thly.\u2014He may sub-let his lands, and Government will assist him, under certain limitations, in recovering rents from his tenants.\n\n6thly.\u2014His holding cannot be encroached on by his neighbour, every sub-division of it being clearly defined by boundary marks, and susceptible of immediate identification by means of the village maps and registers. Further, the fact of his possession of any field or sub-division of it can be traced without difficulty in the village records year by year up\n\n* Baden-Powell\u2014Land Revenue and Land Tenure in India, 136-8.\nto the date of the introduction of the first survey settlement. Thus the chances of dispute and litigation are entirely removed, or reduced to a minimum. Subject, then, to the part of the Government assessment, the occupant of land under the survey tenure may be said to enjoy every right of property that he can desire, with the advantage of possessing a title the most simple and complete that can be imagined.*\n\nBRITISH BURMA.\n\nThe rights of the land-holder, subject to the revenue demands of Government, have been just as carefully guarded in British Burma. The Land Act of that province (Act II of 1876) is founded upon earlier local regulations, which were themselves an epitome, more or less, of the laws and customs of the Burmese as to tenure of land. The land-holder in Burma has, like the ra'iyat in Malacca, a proprietary right, but in the case of the former, this right is inchoate until there have been twelve years' continuous possession; whereas in the case of the Malay mere appropriation and possession create the right at once, provided that clearing and cultivation are undertaken.\n\nIn British Burma, \"if a person (not holding under a grant or order of Government which itself determines the extent of right) has continuously held possession of any culturable land for twelve years, and has continuously paid the revenue due thereon, or held it exempt on express grant, he is allowed to have acquired a permanent heritable and transferable title. It will not, however, do for a man to be able to assert former or ancient possession if that possession came to an end twelve years before the Act came into force (1st February, 1879). Possession, on the other hand, is not broken by a succession or transfer. If A has held for seven years, and then sells to B, who has held for five, B can put in a twelve years' possession. So if B has inherited from A. In the same way as regards the condition of paying the revenue. The payment will hold good if it has been made by a tenant\n\n* Bombay Administration Report, 1882-3, p. 32.\n\"or other person holding under the person in possession. The\n\"land-holder's right is not called proprietary, because it is\n\"restricted not only by the duty of paying revenue, taxes, and\n\"cesses, which is a restriction on all property in land in India,\n\"but also by the fact that all mines and mineral products and\n\"buried treasure are reserved to Government, as also the right\n\"to work or search for those products on paying compensation\n\"for the surface damage.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Any 'land-holder' can obtain an authoritative declara-\n\"tion that he is such, by applying to have his right recorded\n\"on a register provided for the purpose, and getting a certi-\n\"ficate of the record. There are, of course, provisions in the\n\"Act regarding the cancelment and calling in question of such\n\"record.\"*\n\nJ A V A .\n\nIt has already been stated that, under native rule, the Java-\nnese were mere serfs, without proprietary interest in the land\nwhich they cultivated. Under Dutch rule, prior to the con-\nquest of Java by the English in 1811, no proprietary tenure\nwas introduced, and the native system remained unmodified if\nthe following description given by Raffles is a correct one:\n\n\"The Dutch Company, actuated solely by the spirit of gain,\n\"and viewing their Javan subjects with less regard or consi-\n\"deration than a West Indian planter formerly viewed the\n\"gang upon his estate, because the latter had paid the pur-\n\"chase money of human property which the other had not,\n\"employed all the pre-existing machinery of despotism, to\n\"squeeze from the people their utmost mite of contribution,\n\"the last dregs of their labour, and thus aggravated the evils\n\"of a capricious and semi-barbarous government by working\n\"it with all the practised ingenuity of politicians, and all the\n\"monopolising selfishness of traders.\"\u2020\n\n* BADEN-POWELL\u2014Land Revenue and Land Tenure in India, 700-702.\n\u2020 History of Java, I, 168, (2nd edition).\nSecurity of tenure and protection from unjust exactions are the desiderata indicated in the eloquent passage which follows, written with all the burning indignation with which RAFFLES avowed the tyranny and rapacity of the Dutch Colonial Officials of those days inspired him:\u2014\n\n\"Can it, therefore, be a subject of surprise, that the arts of agriculture and the improvement of society have made no greater advances in Java? Need it excite wonder that the implements of husbandry are simple; that the cultivation is unskilful and inartificial; that the state of the roads, where European convenience is not consulted, is bad; that the natural advantages of the country are neglected; that so little enterprise is displayed or capital employed; that the peasant's cottage is mean, and that so little wealth and knowledge are among the agricultural population; when it is considered that the occupant of land enjoys no security for reaping the fruits of his industry; when his possession is liable to be taken away from him every season, or to suffer each an enhancement of rent as will drive him from it; when such a small quantity of land only is allowed him as will yield him bare subsistence, and every ear of grain that can be spared from the supply of his immediate wants, is extorted from him in the shape of tribute; when his personal services are required unpaid for, in the train of luxury or in the culture of articles of monopoly; and when in addition to all these discouragements, he is subject to other heavy imposts and impolitic restraints? No man will exert himself, when acting for another, with so much zeal as when stimulated by his own immediate interest; and under a system of government, where everything but the bare means of subsistence is liable to be seized, nothing but the bare means of subsistence will be sought to be attained.\"\n\n* \"It is but right, however, to say that the Dutch, while admitting their old Colonial rule to have been most objectionable in many ways, deny the systematic atrocities imputed to them by RAFFLES and CRAWFORD, both of whom, the Dutch say, distorted the facts and working of their old Colonial Government, which was only known to these authors by hearsay.\" MONEY'S Java, I, 57, citing TEMMINCK'S Coup d'\u0153il g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur les Possessions N\u00e9erlandaises dans l'Inde Archipelagique, I, 13.\n\n\u2020 RAFFLES\u2014Hist. of Java, Id.\nTo transmute the serf into a proprietor, and to give him immunity from forced labour and other exactions, was the task which RAFFLES set himself. To use his own words: \"The foundation of the amended system was, 1st\u2014The entire abolition of forced deliveries at inadequate rates, and of all feudal services, with the establishment of a perfect freedom in cultivation and trade; 2nd\u2014The assumption, on the part of Government, of the immediate superintendence of the lands with the collection of the resources and rents thereof; 3rd\u2014The renting out of the lands so assumed to the actual occupants, in large or small estates, according to local circumstances, on leases for a moderate term. In the course of the following years (1814 and 1815) these measures were carried into execution in most of the districts under our Government, with a view to the eventual establishment of a perpetual settlement, on the principle of the ryotwar or as it has been termed in Java, the ti\u00e1ng-\u00e1lit system.\"\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"In the first settlement, leases were only granted for a year, or, at the utmost, three years, and were given to intermediate renters; but in the more detailed settlement of 1814, after sufficient information had been collected on the state of the country, Government determined to act directly with the individual cultivator and to lay the foundation of a permanent system. By this latter period, the experiments had been tried to a certain extent, and had succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectation. Difficulties met us in the way, but they were by no means insurmountable; there were at first imperfections in the system, but they did not affect its principle, and were easily removed. By the zeal, the ability, and industry of the various officers entrusted with the execution of the duty, whatever was practicable in furtherance of the object in which they felt deeply interested, was accomplished. In the course of the years 1814 and 1815, the new system was introduced into Bantam, Cheribon and the eastern districts, over a population of a million and a half of cultivators, not only without disturbance and opposition, but to the satisfaction of all classes of the natives, and to the manifest increase of the public revenue derivable from land.\"\nRaffles' system was the *ra'iyat-w\u0101ri* system of Bengal; a proprietary right was accorded to the cultivator, and a temporary settlement was arrived at with him as to the amount of assessment payable by him in lieu of the miscellaneous liabilities of former times. The assessment was payable in money or kind (grain). It was intended that this should be a stepping-stone to a permanent settlement, when experience should have shewn the justice or otherwise of the scale first determined upon. This was:\n\nFor *sawah* lands (rice-fields).\n\n1st quality of soil, one-half of the estimated produce.\n2nd quality of soil, two-fifths of the estimated produce.\n3rd quality of soil, one-third of the estimated produce.\n\nFor *tegal* lands (maize, &c.).\n\n1st quality of soil, two-fifths of the estimated produce.\n2nd quality of soil, one-third of the estimated produce.\n3rd quality of soil, one-fourth of the estimated produce.\n\nChiefs and headmen of villages were continued in office as Collectors of Revenue. Individual rights were recorded in a document, kept for inspection in every village office, in which the name of every land-holder in the village and the amount of his assessment were to be found.\n\nAbout the year 1818, two years after the restoration of Java to the Dutch, Raffles' experiment was abandoned as unsuccessful, and the Government of Netherlands India went back to the system of settlement with the village for the whole village lands. \"The yearly allotment of lands was then left to be made as before, and the legal fiction of the separate property of each village in certain specified fields was abolished.\"\n\nThe present system of land-tenure in Java, which is founded on the native customary law, is thus explained by Mr. Money:\u2014\n\n\"Old Land Tenure and Rent under Native Rule.\u2014The old idea under the Native rule was, that the land belonged to the prince, the usufruct of it to the cultivator. The price of\n\n*Money's Java, I, 76.*\n\"the usufruct, or the rent, was one-fifth of the produce, and\n\"one-fifth of the peasant's labour, or one day's gratuituous\n\"labour in the Java week of five days. The Dutch, in re-\n\"verting to the old system, logically carried out this idea,\n\"holding that they had conquered the prince and not the\n\"people, and therefore came into the prince's rights. They\n\"however, reduced the labour rent from one-fifth to one-\n\"seventh, substituting one day in the European week of seven\n\"days, for one day in the Java week of five days.\"\n\"The different systems of land tenure in the island all\n\"derive from this idea.\"\n\n\"Landlord Property.\u2014Where the Dutch are masters by\n\"treaty and not by conquest, the produce rent and the labour\n\"rent are paid, not to the Dutch but to the Native Princes, as\n\"in the Preanger and in Soerakarta and Djokjokarta. In the\n\"rest of the island, where the Dutch are masters by conquest,\n\"the one-fifth of produce and one-seventh of labour belong\n\"to the Dutch Government, except on private estates, where\n\"the Government has pro tanto granted away its rights.\n\"There the one-fifth and one-seventh are paid by the peasant\n\"to the European or Chinese landowner, and the landowner\n\"pays to Government three-fourths of one per cent. per\n\"annum on the total value of his estate, equal at most to\n\"one-fifth of the net yearly income.\"\n\n\"Peasant's Property.\u2014The peasant's property under the\n\"Native system to which the Dutch reverted, is of three kinds.\n\"1st. Village lands belonging jointly to the whole village\n\"community, to his share in which every householder has a\n\"right. These joint village lands are yearly partitioned and\n\"separately allotted to every head of family according to the\n\"size of his family, and according to their capacity to culti-\n\"vate the land so allotted.\"\n\"2nd. Lands formerly uncultivated, which belong exclu-\n\"sively to the peasant who brings them into cultivation. For\n\"these he pays the one-fifth and one-seventh after five years,\n\"but is exempt from all payment for them, and from all\n\"gratuitous labour whatever, during the first five years.\"\n\"3rd. Lands which have descended from the first cultivator\n\"to his representatives.\"\n\"The first cultivator, however, and also his representatives, whether by purchase or descent, have, besides the land which is exclusively theirs, their share as householders in the village lands, so long as they choose to claim and cultivate such share, but no longer. Either the first cultivator or his descendants can sell any part of such their exclusive land, but only as a peasant holding to some other cultivator, and the purchaser stands in the seller's place, paying his one-fifth and one-seventh. When any holder of such exclusive land dies without heirs, his exclusive land reverts to the common lands of the village within whose boundaries it lies. In some districts, by custom, the first cultivator only holds the land exclusively rent and labour free for six years, when it reverts to the common lands of the village.\"\n\n\"Such were the old land tenures and land rent to which the Dutch reverted, with the modification of the old labour rent of one day in five being reduced to the lesser rate of one day in seven. The Java cottier would of course have preferred the reduction of the produce rent without the imposition of the labour rent; but, much as the Oriental peasant hates labour, he still more hates parting with money. The return to the old state of things was effected not only without disturbance, but, the Dutch say, without even any visible signs of dissatisfaction.\"\n\n\"Present Java Land Tenure.\u2014This simple and well-defined system of land tenure has ever since obtained all through Java, except in the Native states of Soerakarta and Djokjokarta, districts on the Southern Coast of Java, which still maintain a kind of protected and controlled independence, like many of the Native states within our Indian territory. There the old one-fifth of produce in kind and one-fifth of labour are still received by the Native princes in the old manner, and applied generally to the old purposes.\"\n\n\"The system which the Dutch substituted for our Ryot-warree not only applies to Government lands and to the Preanger, but also to private estates. The landlord's claim for rent, long limited by customs, was in 1836 expressly limited by law to one-fifth of his tenant's produce, and to one day's gratuitous labour in seven. The produce rent on\n\"Government land is not expressly limited by law to one-fifth but is settled at that rate with the village chief for the whole village, and must be paid in money. The one-fifth of produce on private estates is generally taken by the landlords from each cottier in kind. The labour rent on crown lands is mostly employed on the roads and public works. On private estates the labour rent is generally applied by the landlord owner to the cultivation of such parts of his property as he keeps in his own hand. In other respects the produce and labour rents are paid to Government or to a private landlord as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Labour Rent.\u2014Every cottier, whether on Government land or on a private estate, gives his one day's gratuitous labour in every seven to his landlord, according to the roster kept by the elected village chief. As this gratuitous labour is a part of the rent for land yielding produce, it is not payable by the artisan, or by any one holding house property only. So also, as only one-seventh of labour is due by each family, the head of the family alone is borne on the roster, but, any competent grown member of the family, or other substitute, performs the labour for him. Although when the yearly appropriation of village lands takes place, a large family gets more than a small one, still only one-seventh of one man's labour is due by that family, however large. The result very generally is, that, in each village, the householders employ some few day labourers to do the gratuitous labour for the whole village, for which they receive a certain daily payment from the villagers. By constant work on the Government roads and irrigation embankments, or on the landowner's private farm, these men become good hands, the villagers get off their one-seventh of labour for a small payment, and thus every one is satisfied.\"\n\n\"Produce Rent.\u2014When the rice crop is ripe, but before it is cut, it is assessed by agreement both as to quantity and value between the cottier tenant and the landlord. In case of agreement both as to quantity and value, the peasant is left to cut down and sell his crop, and has to pay the amount agreed on four months after harvest. If the landlord re-\nquires the one-fifth of produce to be paid in kind, the tenant\nmust deliver it at the landlord's grange on the property as\nsoon as reaped.\n\n\"If landlord and tenant cannot agree as to the number of\npiculs the different fields will yield per bahu, the rest of the\nvillagers are called in, the crop is at once cut down, tied up\nin geddings or bundles of padi as big as can be held in the\ntwo arms, and put up in heaps of five geddings each. The\nlandlord or his agent then takes one gedding from every\nheap. The villagers get a certain proportion of the geddings\nfor cutting down and stacking the crop, which, makes it the\ntenant's interest to agree to a rather higher assess-\nment in quantity, so as to be left to cut down his crop him-\nself. The landlord is subject to the disadvantage, in thus\nhaving the crop cut down by the villagers, of having to carry\naway his own share, which also induces him not to insist\non quite the highest valuation in quantity he thinks the\ncan bear.\"\n\n\"If the landlord and tenant agree as to quantity, but can-\nnot agree as to the market price, the peasant is left to reap\nhis crop himself, and has to deliver to the landlord one-fifth\nof the stipulated quantity of padi in kind, for the safe de-\nlivery of which the village chief is also responsible.\"\n\n\"The value to be agreed on is the current market value of\nthe neighbourhood in full harvest, and when consequently\nthe price is lower than the average throughout the year.\nThe cottier knows that if the landlord and he can agree as\nto value, he will have four months time to pay in. He\nknows that as soon as the harvest is all in, and the produce\nrent of the neighbourhood has either been sold on the spot\nor been sent away for export, produce will rise again to the\nusual price through the year in his locality. It is the tenant's\ninterest, therefore, to agree to both the assessed quantity and\nvalue if not exorbitant, while the landlord's estimate is kept\nwithin bounds by the tenant's right to pay the actual one-\nfifth in kind.\"\n\n\"Large European Landowners.\u2014Although, as previously\nmentioned, the English Government of Java found on in-\nquiry that the Native chiefs did not even claim any proprie-\ntary rights in the soil, yet in some few instances considera-\nble tracts of crown land were bestowed by us on Natives as\nprivate estates. On the return of the Dutch all our grants\nand alienations of crown land were recognised, but from that\ntime the Java crown lands have only been leased out, and\nnever granted away. The few Natives, whom we thus made\nlanded proprietors, then entered into the same condition as the\nold European and Chinese landed proprietors, and their\nestates became liable to sale for arrears of land tax or for\nmortgage debt. The reckless and extravagant habits of\nthese Native landowners have gradually alienated most of\ntheir properties, and there are now not above half-a-dozen\nNatives, out of the Preanger and other Native states,\nwho are still owners of land. There is no prohibition a-\ngainst any Native buying any private estate which is for sale,\nbut the practice is discouraged by the Dutch Government.\"\n\nThe culture-system, a description of which does not fall\nwithin the scope of this paper, has been founded upon and is\nin no way inconsistent with the native customary tenure.\n\nCEYLON.\n\nThe land-revenue system of Ceylon is based upon native\ncustom, which, in this respect, resembles the practice, common\nto the Malays and other Indo-Chinese peoples, of levying a\ntenth or other proportionate share of the produce. A local\nOrdinance, passed in Ceylon in 1840, gave legislative sanction\nto a procedure devised for securing the due collection of the\nGovernment share of the crops of paddy and dry grain grown\nin the island. This tax was a well-recognised impost leviable\nby custom and continued by Government proclamations issued\nin the early years of British occupation.*\n\nThe law of 1840, which is still in force, describes the duty\nleviable to be \"a tax of one-tenth or such other proportion\nof the crops of paddy and dry grain grown in and upon all\nlands now liable thereto, as by law, custom, or usage is at\npresent levied or payable.\"\n\n*Ordinance XIV of 1840, quoting in the preamble Proclamations of Sept.\n3rd, 1801, and Nov. 21st, 1818.\nThe mode of collecting the tax was, in 1841, described as follows, by one who had held high office in Ceylon and whose unfavourable opinion of this system of collecting a land revenue was formed, therefore, after some experience:\n\n\"When the crop is sufficiently advanced to enable an estimate to be formed of its possible produce, the Government Assessors proceed to calculate its probable value, and a return is made to the Government Agent of the amount leviable upon every field. The farm of the tax of each district is then sold by public auction; and, as the harvest approaches, the cultivator is obliged to give five days' notice to the purchaser of his intention to cut; two days' notice if he finds it necessary to postpone; if the crop be not threshed immediately, the renter is entitled to a further notice of the day fixed for that purpose; and for any omission or irregularity he has a remedy by suing for a penalty in the District Court.\"\n\n\"It would be difficult to devise a system more pregnant with oppression, extortion, and demoralisation than the one here detailed. The cultivator is handed over helplessly to two successive sets of inquisitorial officers\u2014the assessors and the renters; whose acts are so uncontrolled that abuses are inevitable, and the intercourse of the two parties is characterised by vigour and extortion on the one side, and cunning and subterfuges of every description on the other. Every artifice and disingenuous device is put in practice to deceive the headmen and assessors as to the extent and fertility of the land and the actual value of the crop; and they, in return, resort to the most inquisitorial and vexatious interference, either to protect the interest of the Government, or privately to further their own. Between these demoralising influences, the character and industry of the rural population are deteriorated and destroyed. The extention of cultivation by reclaiming a portion of waste land only exposes the harassed proprietor to fresh visits from the headmen, and a new valuation by the Government Assessor, and where annoyance is not the leading object, recourse is had to corruption, in order to keep down the valuation.\"\n\"But no sooner has the cultivator got rid of the assessor than he falls into the hands of the renter, who, under the authority with which the law invests him, finds himself possessed of unusual powers of vexation and annoyance. He may be designedly out of the way when the cultivator sends notice of his intention to cut; and if the latter, to save his harvest from perishing on the stalk, ventures to reap it in his absence, the penalties of the law are instantly enforced against him. Under the pressure of this formidable control, the agricultural proprietor, rather than lose his time or his crop in dancing attendance on the renter, or submitting to the multiform annoyances of his subordinates, is driven to pursue forbearance by additional payments; and it is generally understood that the share of the tax which eventually reaches the Treasury does not form one-half of the amount which is thus extorted by oppressive devices from the helpless proprietors.\"\n\nThe same process which is here described for the collection of the tax upon rice lands in the valleys is resorted to for realising that upon dry grain in the uplands and hills; and it is a striking confirmation of the discouragement to the extension of agriculture, which is inseparable from a system so vexatious and so oppressive, that by a return of the produce of the paddy tax and that on dry grain for the years prior to 1846, during which the cultivation of every other description of produce had been making extensive advances, it was shewn that the production of corn had been for some time stationary in Ceylon; and the increase has been very inconsiderable since.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter X.**\n\n**LAND TENURE IN MALACCA UNDER EUROPEAN RULE.**\n\nBritish rule in Malacca dates from 1825, the year in which the cession arranged by the treaty with the Netherlands of\n\n*Sir Emerson Tennent's Hist. of Ceylon, II, 170, n.\n1824 was carried into effect. It is true that from 1795 to 1818, Malacca had been held by the English, but this was more in the nature of a military occupation, which might come to an end at any time on the cessation of war, than permanent civil administration. As far as can be learned, the Government of Malacca between 1795 and 1818 went on very much as it had under the Dutch, save for the removal of restrictions on cultivation and trade and for the humane reforms of Lord Minto in the criminal procedure.* At all events at first, documents dealing with rights in land were made out in the Dutch language for the signature of the English Governor.\n\nTaking 1825 as the starting point, what was the land tenure of the Settlement as the British found it in that year? I reply unhesitatingly that it was the native tenure of the Malays, unchanged in any way either by Portuguese or Dutch rulers. \u2020 All the evidence supports this, the absence of any express land laws or regulations passed during the preceding period of European rule, the fact that such records as we have of the Dutch administration exhibit the government upholding the customary rules of native tenure, the fact that in their other eastern possessions the Dutch have consistently maintained the native tenure as they found it, and the fact that at the date of the final cession of Malacca a code of regulations was under the consideration of the Dutch Government, which is founded in all respects upon local custom and has nothing in common with any European system.\n\nThere were very good reasons why the tenure of Malacca should not have been interfered with. The Portuguese rule was the mere military occupation of a fortress, by which the command of the Straits, and thereby of the eastern trade, was\n\n* \"Malacca was to have been restored to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens, in 1802; but war recommenced (May 1803) before the transfer was made, and the Dutch falling again under the gripe of France, it consequently remained in the hands of the British until 1818. The law of Holland continued to be administered, and the decrees of the courts of justice passed in the name of their High Mightinesses.\"\u2014NEWBOLD, I, 126.\n\n\u2020 \"The Portuguese, while they held Malacca, and, after them, the Dutch, left the Malay customs, or lex non scripta, in force.\" See the judgment of Sir Benson Maxwell in Sahrip v. Mitchell and ano., Appendix, p. xli.\nmaintained. They were frequently besieged, and the enemy was on more than one occasion up to their very gates. It would be absurd to suppose that any new land system was devised or introduced for the limited area covered by the fort and town in those troublous times. The Dutch drove out the Portuguese in 1640. At no time during their occupation did the Dutch open up the interior by means of roads: their forts at St. John's hill and elsewhere shew that the suburbs were not always peaceful, and there is little reason to suppose that their direct rule extended far from the town of Malacca itself. The whole object of their establishment was trade, and, in the words of an English official who had studied the subject, \"Malacca was considered a mere outpost of the Supreme Colonial Government in Java for securing Dutch supremacy and monopoly in the Straits. Not only was agriculture discouraged, but it was absolutely prevented. The cultivation of grain was forbidden as interfering with monopoly in Java, and other species of tropical cultivation were equally disallowed from the same cause.\"* Among the sources of revenue of the Dutch Government before 1795 there is no mention of land revenue, and the absence of this item is sufficiently accounted for by the statement just quoted.\n\nThe Dutch did not introduce any land laws, or derive any public revenue from land, but they fully recognised individual rights in land, and supplied the means of proving title by written documents. These rights were, for the most part, rights acquired under the local native customs, and the manner in which they were transferred was quite in keeping with the native mode of thought. I have already quoted (sup., p. 120) a passage from the Kedah laws in which it is laid down\n\n---\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 737; Id. X, 45.\u2014\"Though under the dominion of an European power for about 250 years, it remains, even to the foot of the lines of the town, as wild and uncultivated as if there had never been a settlement formed here, and except by the small river that passes between the fort and town, you cannot penetrate into the country in any direction above a few miles; nor is even this extent general, being confined to the roads that run along the seashore about two miles each way and one that goes inland (about four miles).\"\u2014Capt. Lennon's Journal,\u20141796\u2014Journ. Straits Branch R. A. S., No. 7, p. 62.\nthat the Raja's concurrence shall be necessary to validate a transfer made by a land-owner to another. This is the principle upon which the Dutch documents of title, still extant in Malacca, seem to have been issued. A purchaser or inheritor of land had to go before the Court of Justice and declare and prove the transaction by which he claimed possession of the land. Upon satisfactory proof being adduced, the Court confirmed the transfer or transmission and issued to him a document in the nature of a certificate of his right of possession, that is of his proprietary right under the local law. The greater part of the land in the town of Malacca is held in this manner, and it has been hastily assumed that the certificates of the Dutch Court of Justice have superseded earlier grants issued to the original proprietors. I do not believe that there is, in the majority of cases, any foundation for such an assumption. Land in the town and suburbs of Malacca was in the possession of individuals before the Dutch occupation\u2014and before the Portuguese conquest for the matter of that. It was held and continued to be held either by the native possessors or by new-comers, with or without the permission of the ruling authority, under the local tenure. Only, after the establishment of a Court of Justice by the Dutch, secret alienation was not permitted. A transfer of land had to receive the sanction of the government, in whom theoretically the soil was vested, and this, as has been shewn, is quite in accordance with Malay ideas.\n\nThe uncertainty attending the terms on which such land could be held is clearly evidenced in some of the Dutch documents. Sometimes it is expressly declared that the land is subject to any taxes, &c., which may at any future time be imposed, and this sufficiently indicates that the terms ultimately to be imposed were not settled, though it was well understood that land was liable to a customary tax if the Government should at any time choose to exact it. But, as I have shewn, no land revenue was collected in Malacca in Dutch times and presumably no tax was ever imposed. The land on which the town of Malacca stands pays no rent, tax or revenue of any kind to the Government, to this day. But there can be little doubt that it is open to the Government of\nthe Colony to exact any reasonable assessed rental at any time, if, as I contend, the tenure on which this land is held is the native tenure of the country and in no sense \"fee simple,\" as the holders of it would like to maintain.\n\nThe Dutch claimed authority over the interior of the province of Malacca, though they neither made roads, maintained order, or otherwise directly governed the district. The greater part of it was granted away as *terres particuli\u00e8res* (see sup. p. 93) to Dutch settlers, traders, or officials in the town, and in some instances to natives. These had, that is to say, the right of standing in the place of the Government and collecting the customary tenth on produce. Several families were able to make a small income in this way, through Malay headmen appointed by them over these lands, or through Chinese sub-renters to whom they farmed out their privileges. But they had no right to the soil, and there is little reason to suppose that the Europeans either lived on or even visited the lands over which their rights extended.\n\nThis again is a purely native institution, copied by the Dutch. Its origin will be found in the extract from the Malacca Code, in Appendix I p. xv, and in the description of the \"private lands\" in Java by Dr. Winckel (sup. p. 94), who expressly states that the custom there is a native one which originated with the Javanese sovereigns.\n\nBesides the occupiers of the town and suburban lands and the proprietors (*tuan tanah*) of the concessions just mentioned, there were the Malay peasantry in the interior, proprietors, sub-tenants or mere cultivators, as the case might be, under the native laws already described. That these were never very numerous in Dutch times, when the cultivation of rice was absolutely forbidden, may be assumed from the fact that in the eight years from 1828 to 1836, (paddy-planting having been permitted since 1795) the average number of cultivators paying tenths was only 2,361.* In fact, under Dutch rule, the concessions must have paid very little to their proprietors, and\n\n---\n\n* Newbold, I, 165. Mr. W. T. Lewis, Assistant Resident of Malacca, in 1828 estimated the Malacca territory to be 450 square miles, of which 5,653 acres only were cultivated.\nit was only under the British Government, after 1795, that they began to be valuable.\n\nThe land-holders, then, in Malacca, at the time that the British took possession of the place finally in 1825, were of three classes:\n\n1.\u2014Holders of land in the town and suburbs, with or without certificates of the Court of Justice;\n2.\u2014Proprietors of concessions, in the nature of Zamin-dari rights, over country lands;\n3.\u2014Native cultivators having a proprietary right;\u2014all holding under the local customary tenure of the country.\n\nIt was difficult at first for the officers of the new Government to obtain accurate information as to the state of the tenure. The persons belonging to the second of the three classes just enumerated\u2014\"proprietors,\" as they called themselves, \"tithe-owners\" or \"impropriators,\" as Mr. Young termed them*\u2014commenced by making wholly inadmissible claims. For a time it seemed as if the whole of the land of the Province, beyond the town-limits, was the absolute property of \"proprietors,\" whether cultivated land, waste land, or forest. There was no one to appeal to for information as to the nature of the tenure except the \"proprietors\" themselves and their friends and relations. Such information as they could or would give will be found in the minutes of a meeting held by the Resident Councillor on the 10th of October, 1826 (Appendix II). They claimed the unqualified ownership of hundreds of square miles of land, the greater part of which was uncleared forest because, though the rights granted in respect of it had been conferred with a view to its being cleared, the Dutch Government had never enforced this stipulation! They called the cultivators their \"tenants,\" and denied the right of any one to settle on their alleged estates without permission; yet they admitted the right of a \"tenant\" to sell, mortgage and devise his land and to extend his property by taking up waste land at will. They alleged a customary right to collect\n\n* Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System, S.S.\u2014Mr. Young's 3rd Report, pp. 51-75.\na rent which was ordinarily a tenth of all produce, but admitted that they had no right to levy a higher rate.\n\nIt need hardly be said that this description was not sufficient to convince the Governor (Mr. Fullerton) that the relative rights of Government, \"proprietor,\" and \"tenants\" had been correctly stated.* He pointed out the inconsistencies which occurred in the information elicited at the meeting, and the claims of the concessionaires to be absolute owners were never recognised. It was made clear by the production of a Dutch Proclamation, dated 14th December, 1773, and a later one dated 20th May, 1819 (Appendix IV), that the latter were forbidden, under pain of a heavy fine, from levying more than one-tenth of the produce from the cultivators. This satisfied the Governor that all that had ever been given up by the Dutch Government to the concessionaires was the right of collecting the tax of one-tenth of the produce, and that no valid claim could be made out to any absolute right of ownership of the soil. It was decided to redeem the rights which had been thus given up, and in 1828 these were repurchased by Government from the concessionaires, who received in lieu of them hereditary allowances calculated according to the respective values of the concessions so re-acquired by Government. In a few cases, owing to absence from the Settlement, or incapacity to contract, on the part of the persons entitled, the re-purchase of the right of levying the tenth was not carried out, and this right is, therefore, still enjoyed by a few individuals in Malacca.\n\nThe lands at Malacca, having been just freed from the incubus of a middleman between Government and the cultivator, were taken in hand by the authorities. A Superintendent of Lands was appointed, and a Regulation for the Administration of the Land Revenue Department was passed on the 25th June, 1828, which, after approval by the Board of Directors, became Regulation IX of 1830.\n\nThe foundation of much of the mal-administration that has followed may be traced to this very incomplete measure. The Government ought then to have decided whether the tithe\n\n* See Mr. Fullerton's minute, Appendix II, p. xxx.\nsystem was to be persisted in or not; whether land was thenceforth to be taken up in the old way and to be subject to the payment of tenths, or whether any other system of tenure was to be introduced. But what was done was this:\n\n(1). The Government determined to collect the tenth on produce which had just been re-acquired from the former tithe-owners, and toll-houses were erected throughout the country to intercept produce on its way to market.\n\n(2). A determination was announced to survey the holdings of the then cultivators and to issue \"title-deeds\" for them. This was not carried out.*\n\n(3). For lands disposed of subsequently, grants and leases were to be issued under English law.\n\n(4). The Regulation was silent as to the method of enforcing the levy of the tenth.\n\nIs it surprising that the result has been incessant confusion ever since? Here was a native tenure easily intelligible and suited to the customs and traditions of the people. It was possible to carry it out in its entirety by encouraging the exercise of the free right of taking up land for agricultural purposes and the acquisition of an alienable proprietary right, subject to the payment of tenths, and by providing legal machinery for the collection of tenths and the punishment of persons evading payment. It was possible, on the other hand, to abandon it, to levy an assessment (founded, as in India, on a rough survey or estimate of area) in lieu of it, and to alienate lands in the future on this system. But neither of these systems was adopted. The old lands cultivated and liable to tenths before 1830 remained subject to the native customs, but they were not identified by registration or survey. Lands taken up and brought into cultivation without permission after 1830 could not, therefore, in subsequent years, be dis-\n\n* \"A Surveyor was appointed, but before he had been many months employed, his services were dispensed with in the general reduction, and in consequence until this day (1856), except in the immediate vicinity of the town, the lands are not measured, nor do the tenants hold any documents to prove their rights.\" Journ. Ind. Arch., X. 61.\ntinguished from them. The tithe system was maintained, but the toll-houses proved to be a nuisance and at the same time an inefficient means of collecting the tax. It must have been obvious that much produce liable to the tax would not pass the toll-houses at all, while, on the other hand, produce exempt from taxation, i.e., that derived from the lands of Penghulus, etc., and from lands leased or granted on a quit-rent after 1830, would very likely be charged. The outlook from the first was not promising, and two important facts\u2014one legal and the other administrative\u2014tended to aggravate all the other difficulties. One was the decision of the Recorder, Sir B. Malkin,* \"that the introduction of the King's charter into these Settlements had introduced the existing law of England also, except in some cases where it was modified by express provision, and had abrogated any law previously existing,\" \u2020 and the other was the alteration in the form of government and the reduction of establishments which took place about 1830. Thenceforward there were only two officers to perform all the executive and judicial duties of the station.\u2021\n\nThe Malacca Land Regulation (IX of 1830) was not long regarded as law. It was passed by the same authority as the Singapore Land Regulation, which was judicially declared by Sir B. Malkin, to be illegal because it was not a Regulation \"for imposing duties and taxes,\" those being the only purposes for which the Governor in Council of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca could legislate.\u00a7\n\nChanges in the law and in the Government were followed soon afterwards by the Naning War (1831-2). So it will be seen that the years which immediately followed the cession of Malacca were characterised by a number of incidents which rendered the establishment of a successful administration of the Land Department a very difficult operation.\n\n* Rodyk v.

On the continent of India, the Governments are invested with legislative power, and that power is exercised in prescribed form, by the enactment and promulgation of laws registered in the Judicial Department, under the term of Regulations. Those Regulations, besides providing for the forms of administering justice, define the relative rights of the Government and the subject, and prescribe the mode under which those rights are to be inferred on the one part, maintained on the other, by application to local Provincial Courts, bound to act according to those Regulations. The Supreme Courts have no jurisdiction in any matters of Revenue, or the collection thereof. In the Revenue Department, public officers hold summary powers of enforcing, in the first instance, all demands, whether for payment of arrears, ejecting from lands unduly held, leaving the onus prosequendi on the party supposing himself aggrieved, distrain when no arrear is due, or ejectment from lands properly belonging to him. It is only under the exercise of the summary process that the collection of the Government Revenue in India is insured. In these eastern settlements the Government has no power of framing those legislative provisions. There does not, therefore, exist any distinct and clear definition of relative rights, or prescribed mode of enforcing and preserving them. There are no Provincial Courts acting under local law. Government possesses no power of enforcing its demands. The Court administering justice as a Revenue Court is a King's Court, framed on the English model, and taking the common law of England as its guide. Questions of Revenue, there-\nfore, whether arising from land or excise, fall to be tried\nunder principles that have no relation or resemblance to the\nlocal situation of the country and its inhabitants. Before\ndemands can be enforced, legal process in all the English\nforms must be resorted to; writs of ejectment must be sued\nfor: suits entered for arrears; delays, expenses, doubts and\ndifficulties arise that render it easy for the people to evade\nthe payment of all demands, and induce the officers of Gov-\nernment rather to abandon the demand, small in individual\ncases, though considerable in the aggregate, rather than\nencounter all the difficulties and go through forms which\nthey cannot understand. Let us suppose, for example's sake,\nthat the Supreme Court at Calcutta were at once declared\nthe only Revenue Court; that every arrear of Revenue,\nevery question resulting from its collection, or the occupa-\ntion of land, were to be tried there in the first instance, under\nall its forms; would it possible to realize the Land Revenue?\nYet this, in a small way, is exactly our case. Singapore,\nindeed, is of recent acquisition, and the titles hitherto given\nhave been in English form: but even at Singapore, there is\nmuch land occupied without any title whatever; and unless\nsomething is done by regular enactment, possession will make\na title, as it has done in this Island, from the neglect of the\nlocal authorities. But how are we to regulate decisions at\nMalacca? There the sovereign right is one-tenth of the\nproduce; the Dutch made over the right to certain of the\ninhabitants more than 100 years ago. This Government, by\nway of insuring increase of cultivation and introduction of\npopulation, redeemed the right. How are we to levy the\ntenth, if refused? The land tenures at Malacca bear no\nanalogy or resemblance to any English tenure; yet by such\nthey must, in case of doubt, be tried. Regulations adapted\nto the case have indeed been sent to England, but until local\nlegislation is applied, and the mode of administering justice\nbetter adapted to the circumstances of the place, it seems to\nme quite useless to attempt the realization of any Revenue\nwhatever.\"\n\nReferences to Bengal on the many vexed questions relative\nto the occupation and alienation of land in the Straits were\nincessant for the next ten years. Each of the three Settlements had its separate history and its peculiar administrative difficulties, and it was no easy task to find out and apply the proper remedies in each. In 1837 the Supreme Government in Calcutta gave effect to some of Sir B. Malkin's recommendations by repealing the local Land Regulations (the legality of which was more than doubtful),* with a view to the introduction of a general Land Law, and by passing an Act (No. XX of 1837) which modifies, in the Straits, the English law of succession and makes all immoveable property descend to the executor or administrator and not to the heir.\u2020 In the same year a Commissioner (Mr. Young) was despatched from India to the Straits Settlements to settle existing disputes and difficulties about titles to land and to report on the whole subject. He visited Malacca in 1838, and again there was an opportunity of putting the land revenue system on an intelligible basis, either by ascertaining, and formally enacting as law, the native customs relative to the collection of the tenth (as was done in Ceylon a few years later\u2021), or by establishing by law the principle of an assessment in money, instead of the tax in kind, to be levied on the cultivated area as in India.\n\nMr. Young recommended neither. He deprecated legislation, and preferred to trust (the result has shewn how vainly) to argument and persuasion to induce the Malays to commute the tithe for a fixed annual payment in money. The idea started in Regulation IX of 1830, that each cultivator was to have a title-deed for his holding, seems to have taken complete possession of that generation of Land Revenue officials and the object of every succeeding administration seems similarly to have been to force documents of title upon an unwilling population. The toll-houses were discontinued and the voluntary commutation plan was tried. Its complete failure was thus described by Mr. E. A. Blundell in 1848:\n\n---\n\n* Act X of 1837, s. 1.\n\u2020 See Sir B. Malkin's letter to the Government of India, dated July 17, 1837; Report of Indian Land Commissioners, p. 85.\n\u2021 Sup., p. 145.\n\"He (Mr. Young) seems to have brought to notice the very objectionable system of levying a revenue in kind on the produce of the lands, and to have induced the resort to a commutation of the tenths into a money payment, but unfortunately the mode adopted either by or through him, was one that proved most unpalatable to the natives of the place, and by its enforcement led to much vexation and dissatisfaction. This novel mode of raising a land revenue was by means of technical English legal indentures between the tenants and the East India Company, drawn up with all the precision and formality of a practising attorney in England, whereby the tenant engages to pay so much per annum, and the East India Company engages not to demand any more, during a period of twenty years from the date of signing. This legal document occupies the whole of one side of a sheet of foolscap, while the other is filled with Malayan writing purporting to be a translation of the English, but, as may well be supposed, failing entirely to convey to a native reader any idea of its meaning. It requires some knowledge of law to understand the English original, considering that it is drawn up in strictly legal terms, and the attempt to translate those terms into Malay has produced an utterly unintelligible jumble of words. Indentures being duplicate documents are of course required to be signed, sealed and delivered in duplicate by each party in the presence of witnesses. To secure therefore the payment (often of a few annas only per annum) the tenants (ignorant Malay peasants) were sent for in shoals to put their marks to these sheets of foolscap paper filled with writing. They naturally got alarmed and evinced the greatest reluctance to affix their signature. To overcome this reluctance and to induce a general signing throughout, seems to have been the great and almost sole object of the Land Department from that time to the present. All the ingenuity of Residents and Assistants has been exerted to this end and all the principles of political economy have been exhausted in endeavouring to explain the advantages of the system, but in many parts without success. Threats, coaxings and explanations have been set at defiance, and an obstinate determi-\nnation evinced not to sign these legal papers. In 1843 or 1844, the then Resident hit on the notable plan of punishing the recusants for their contumacy by putting their tenths up to auction and selling them to a Chinaman, the very thing that formed one of the grounds for redeeming the lands from the proprietors!\"\n\nThe Government had redeemed the rights granted in the days of Dutch rule to a few privileged \"proprietors\" and the worst that was said of the bargain for some years was that it had been rashly and improvidently concluded and had resulted in an annual loss to Government. But as time went on it was discovered that the Government had by no means acquired, as had been supposed, an unfettered right to deal with the waste land of Malacca. The deeds by which the \"proprietors\" surrendered their rights to Government contained a stipulation to the effect that, in case the Settlement of Malacca should ever be given up to any other Power, they should be restored to their original position with respect to the lands.* This proviso effectually prevented the Government from giving a clean title to purchasers.\n\nThe legal difficulty thus engendered, and the acknowledged failure of the voluntary commutation plan, necessitated reference once more to the Government of India, and in 1861 a Bill was introduced in the Legislative Council of India, which, it was hoped, would give the local authorities all the necessary powers. During a debate on this measure, the law officer of the Government (Mr. Sconce) read to the Council an extract from a letter written by Mr. Blundell, ex-Governor of the Straits Settlements, in which the injurious effect of the exaction of the tenth in kind was pointed out. He further explained that twenty years earlier an attempt had been made to commute the payment in kind to a money payment, which had failed \"from the bad way in which it was carried out,\" and that many disputes had arisen from the inefficiency of the native surveyors, \"whose surveys were so bad that constant disputes were arising in consequence of them, many lands having been assigned twice over.\" To meet\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., X, 60-61,\nthis difficulty the Bill provided for a survey and a summary settlement of the rights of parties, \"which would put an end to disputes.\"*\n\nThe Bill in due time became law and, as Act XXVI of 1861, is still in force in the Colony. It settled summarily all difficulties as to the title of the Government to the lands over which the Dutch grantees had once had rights, by vesting the lands in question in fee simple in Her Majesty and thus forever extinguished any hopes which the former grantees might have entertained of regaining possession, at some future time, of the surrendered rights.\n\nIt also declared what was the legal status of certain classes of native land-holders and provided a scheme of survey and settlement, analogous to the Indian system, under which the rights and liabilities of every one could be ascertained and recorded.\n\nBut thirty years had been lost and the lands taken up with or without authority in that period were now not to be distinguished from the lands which were held under the local customary tenure at the time when Regulation IX of 1830 was passed.\u2020 The duty to be undertaken was a completely new survey of the Settlement of Malacca, in the course of which the status of every person claiming to have title to land was to be ascertained and declared; and this was not facilitated by any earlier survey and settlement, for the provisions of Regulations IX of 1830 in this respect had been allowed to remain a dead letter,\u2021\n\nThe Act contemplated (s. 1) two classes of native land-holders, namely, (1) \"cultivators and resident tenants\" of the lands redeemed from the Dutch grantees, and of lands in Naning \"who hold their lands by prescription;\" \u00a7\n\n(2) \"All other cultivators and under-tenants who now occupy or hold, or shall occupy or hold, any of such lands as aforesaid.\" Those who could prove a proprietary right under\n\n* Bengal Hurkaru, January 19th, 1861.\n\u2020 See p. 151.\n\u2021 See supra, p. 154, note.*\n\u00a7 i.e., by local custom, usage or law, Suhrip v. Mitchell, Appendix III, p. xli.\nthe local customary tenure, and who came, therefore within the first category, were declared to be liable to a payment, either in money or kind, of one-tenth part of the produce of the land to Government.\n\nThose (class 2), whose occupation was independent of the native customary tenure were to be treated as squatters under the Straits Land Act (Act XVI of 1839, s 2) and had the alternative of \"engaging for\" their land on terms fixed by the Government, or of removing from it altogether.\n\nPower was given to the Governor to commute the customary liability of a land-holder to pay tenths in kind, for a sum down and an annual quit-rent.\n\nWaste land at the disposal of Government was to be alienated, in the discretion of the Governor, to applicants, in perpetuity or for any term of years and subject to any quit-rent agreed upon; and the local customary right, which the peasantry of Malacca possessed, of taking up forest, waste or uncultivated land and acquiring a proprietary right over it by clearing and cultivating it, was taken away. Every land-holder was, however, declared to be entitled to add to his holding by engaging for contiguous uncultivated land in the proportion of one part of waste for every four parts of land cultivated by him.\n\nFinally, certain legal powers were given to officials to be appointed by the Governor, to make a survey of the lands of the Settlement, to require the attendance of parties and the production of documents, and to enquire into and decide questions of title, subject to an appeal to the Court of Judicature.\n\nIf this Act had been properly worked by a sufficient establishment, there would seem to be no reason why the Malacca Land Revenue Department should not be at the present time, as regards survey, settlement, maps, registration of holdings, and record of rights, on as satisfactory a footing as any settled district in an Indian province.\n\nBut no settlement operations on a sufficiently extended scale were ever undertaken. A surveyor was appointed and worked for some years during which time a tolerable survey of the coast districts (about one-fourth of the whole) was executed. The\nmaps so obtained were never published and the Indian system of declaring particular land to be liable for so much revenue annually, leviable quite irrespective of any title-deed delivered to the occupant, was not enforced by the Land Office, though this is distinctly what the Act aimed at. The officials of the day seem to have been still unable to get rid of the idea that the only way to make an occupant liable for land revenue was to make him sign a lease first of all.\n\nIn the words of the late Attorney-General of this Colony (Mr. T. Bradell, C.M.G.), whose paper on the Malacca Land History* has been of the greatest value to me in compiling these notes,\u2014\u201cthe cultivators, finding themselves better off under the Penghulus, with whom (when they had no written titles registered in the office, and followed by regular demands for the rent expressed in the title-deed) they were able to evade payment of the tenths, still refused to take titles, and continued to occupy old lands and to open up other lands with impunity, owing to the weakness of the Land Department, which was provided with so few, and such inefficient officers, that there was no regular supervision, and when any person was found encroaching on the Crown lands he was all ready with the excuse that the land was prescriptive tenant land.\u201d\u2020\n\nSystematic work in Malacca under Act XXVI of 1861 ceased with the departure of Surveyor-General Quinton from that Settlement, about 1867.\n\nA passing reference may here be made to Ordinance XI of 1876, intended to facilitate land-administration in Malacca, which has remained more or less a dead-letter for want of an efficient establishment.\u2021\n\nNeither Act XXVI of 1861, nor the Ordinance last quoted, touch on a subject which has attracted the attention of several persons who have written upon Malacca Lands. It has been stated above (p. 153) that owing to absence from the Settlement, or incapacity to contract, on the part of the persons entitled, the right of collecting the tenth was not redeemed\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., N.S., I, 43.\n\u2020 Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, 1882, p. 68.\n\u2021 Id.\nby Government in all cases and that this right is still enjoyed by a few individuals in Malacca. Blundell speaks of the omission to carry out the redemption policy in these few instances (which of course ought to have been dealt with as soon as the exceptional circumstances alluded to ceased), as an \"important error,\" but describes the unredeemed lands as \"so small in extent (probably not one-tenth of the whole), \"and already (1848) so far occupied, as to preclude their \"being selected for any extensive cultivation\" by a new colonist prospecting for agricultural land.*\n\nThe plan proposed by Mr. W. R. Young, in 1838, of providing by a special Act for the resumption by the State of the privileges held by the few remaining tithe-impropriators, upon the award of compensation on an equitable principle, has not yet been acted upon. Perhaps the limited area of the land in question, which, he states, \"does not exceed in area four or five square miles,\" was thought to characterise the matter as one of not sufficient importance to demand special legislation in Calcutta. Mr. Young's remarks and recommendations are as follows:\u2014\n\n\"I must here mention that although the great bulk of the impropriators transferred their rights to the Government in 1828, a few of them were not included in Mr. Fullerton's arrangement, either by reason of the absence from Malacca of the principals, at the time of the negotiation, or because some of the tithe-owners had sub-let their privileges to others for a term of years, and the derivative interests thus created stood in the way of the admission of those impro priators into the scheme of adjustment. The land thus excluded from the general arrangement does not exceed in area four or five square miles, and I believe that the impro priators would be quite willing to surrender their privileges to the Government in consideration of receiving compensation on the principle which was applied to the cases of the other tithe-owners. I think it would be desirable, for the sake of uniformity, to extend the arrangement to these par ties, although the land in question is not sufficiently exten-\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 743, 744.\n\u2020 Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System of the Straits Settlements, 1837-1844, para. 40, p. 69.\nsive to offer any important obstruction to the satisfactory working of the new system as a whole. The position of the lands referred to, their limited area, and the facility of obtaining correct information respecting their produce and value, would obviate all risk of a recurrence, in relation to them, of the miscalculations or deceptions which have rendered the existing composition with the tithe-owners so bad a bargain to the State. If, however, these impropiators should be unwilling to assent to an equitable arrangement with the State for the surrender of their rights\u2014the terms of which might be settled by arbitrators\u2014and if Government should be of opinion that the retention, in hands of a few individuals of privileges, the reservation of which, even to the ruling authority, has been declared to be incompatible with the good of the country, would militate against the beneficial working of the new plan\u2014there would be neither injustice nor difficulty in providing by law for the transfer of those privileges to the State, with a view to the perfection of the commutation arrangement, compensation, on an equitable principle being of course awarded to the parties whose interests may be affected by the transfer. A measure of this sort would, I have no doubt, be acceptable to the tithe-payers, who will soon find themselves in a more unfavourable position than their neighbours who have assented to the commutation, and, indeed, there is little reason to suppose that the tithe-owners would object to a fair adjustment. Perhaps it would be advisable that Government should direct the local authorities to negotiate with the impropiators in question for the surrender of their rights to tithes, and to report the result for the approval or further instructions of the Supreme Government.\n\nA good deal has been said lately about \"British Malaya,\" under which term those who favour a policy of extending our territory on the Malay Peninsula, by annexation, would include the Straits Settlements, and at least those Native States which are now under our direct protectorate (Perak, Salangor and Sungei Ujong). A word, therefore, may here be added as to the lessons to be learnt from the history of the land-laws\napplied during the last sixty years to the only Malay State which has yet become British territory.\n\nIn Malacca, the native system of land tenure and revenue has never been properly ascertained and put into the shape of an Act. It has always been, therefore, and still is, more or less unworkable under English law.\n\nThe lands held under the native tenure at the time of cession were not identified and registered, and though a new system of tenure under English grants and leases was introduced, the old native system went on extending itself side by side with the new one.\n\nWhen, in 1861, it was declared to be the intention of Government to put a stop to the native system of acquiring a proprietary right by occupation, the holdings then existing were not ascertained by a visitation or survey.\n\nSo, though the native revenue system cannot be satisfactorily worked, for want of power to exact the tenth, the officials have been unable to oblige the people to adopt the English tenure, because lands, really only recently brought under cultivation, cannot always be proved not to be old holdings under the native tenure.\n\nThe experience of other British possessions in the East conclusively shews that the wisest way to organise the collection of land revenue in an Asiatic country is to adopt and extend the native system, to work it through responsible trained officers charged with the care of separate tracts and living in their districts, to create a revenue side of every District Officer's Court and to have nothing to do with English law.\n\nThis paper, which has grown to unexpected proportions, may now fitly end with a final quotation from an official report:\n\n\"It would be well if in the Protected States the history of Malacca tenures were taken as a warning, and if an early opportunity were taken of ascertaining the rights of native cultivators and land-holders and securing to them their full enjoyment, while laying down any modifications of the native law which may be decided on as to the future. If something of this kind is not done, the modern clearing will be undistinguishable from the ancient holding and land will continue to\n\"be occupied and acquired on a system which it is difficult to\n\"assimilate with any satisfactory land revenue scheme.\"*\n\nW.

Land for these purposes is of two kinds, the first is tanah hidop, (live land), and the second is tanah mati (dead land). Tanah mati is that on which there is no sign or token that it has been appropriated by any one, or any grove of fruit-trees in respect of which a proprietor can demand a payment. Regarding such land it is certain that there can be no question. If any person proceeds to plant upland or wet padi on such land, no one has any right to dispute it with him for it has been abandoned voluntarily by its former owner.\n\nLand which is known as tanah hidop is that which is appropriated by some one, either by living on it or by planting timber or fruit-trees or by laying out a garden or enclosure. This cannot be taken by anyone and is called tanah hidop. This rule applies also to persons who settle on the lands or plantations of others. As long as they live there, they must obey the orders of the owner, and if they oppose him, they may be fined ten tahils and one paha.* It is the duty of all the persons who live on the land to support and co-operate with their lord, a rule which is also laid down in the Hukum Kanun.\u2020\n\nIf a person plants an orchard (on the land of another) and his trees grow up successfully, and a complaint is lodged by the owner of the land, the value of the land shall be divided into three equal parts, one third shall be paid to the owner of the land, and\n\n* 1 tahil = $8.\n\u2020 4 paha = 1 tahil.\n\u2020 A separate Code.

The same is the rule in the case of rice-fields, laid out by a person on the land of another.

If it is the owner of the land who does this, there is, of course, nothing to be said. Such is the law regarding tanah hidop, and it is firmly established and followed both in towns and in the country and in all districts and divisions of the State.\n\n[Huma or Ladang land.

In the case of these, if a buffalo or ox effects an entry and be stabbed at night [by the owner of the crop or his people], the latter must make good half of the value of the beast. But according to another sound doctrine, the full value of the beast must be made good (by the crop-owner) and the value of the damaged crop must be made good by the owner of the beast.\n\n* \"The prevalence of this practice (the enclosure of cattle in fences), and the care with which fencing is universally attended to, is the best evidence of the value set upon land by a dense population. Their perception of the rights of property, and their desire to maintain and respect them, are amply attested by their many arrangements to restrain the trespass of cattle. On the other hand, one of the most serious annoyances with which the planters of the South have had to contend, both on their Coffee and Sugar Estates arises from the notorious indifference of the Kandyans and Singhalese in this particular, and their disregard of all precautions for securing their buffaloes and bullocks by day or by night.\" TENNENT'S \"Ceylon,\" II, 532.\nKa-dua tanam-an itu tiada ber-pagar jika di-tikam pada malam menyilih samua-nia yang ampunia tanam-an itu dan tiada-lah di-silih-nia uleh yang ampunia benatang akan tanam-an itu.\n\nJikalau siang ter-tikam sa-pulang-dua hukum-nia melain-kan jikalau sudah masahur jahat-nia kerbau itu sa-hingga menyilih sa-bolah harga-nia jaga dan tanam-an itu di-silih pula uleh yang ampunia kerbau.\n\nPada menyata-kan hukum buah-buah-an di-dalam kam-pong orang atau di-dalam kota negri ada-pun jika tiada iya mem-bahagi-kan buah itu akan tuan-nia di-makan-nia ber-sama-sama jikalau di-jual-nia buah-nia itu maka di-pinta harga-nia sa-per-tiga dua bahagi pada ampunia kampong sa-bahagi akan tuan-nialama dan jikaiyatiada mahu mem-bori maka marah iya lalu di-tebang-nia pokok itu maka meng-adap ampunia pada hakim maka di-suroh hakim bayar harga-nia pokok itu bagei-mana \u2018adat sagala pokok kayu-kayu-an yang di-dalam kam-pong orang di-akan sagala buah-buah-an itu pun mana \u2018adat-nia yang sa-per-tiga juga dan jikalau di-jual-nia uleh ampunia kampong itu dapat di-d\u2019awa-nia uleh yang ampunia lama me-\nThe second kind of growing crop is that which is not fenced in. In the case of land of this kind, the value of a beast stabbed at night in the act of trespassing must be made good in full by the owner of the crop, and there is no obligation upon the owner of the beast to make good the value of the damage done by it.\n\nShould a beast be stabbed [trespassing] in daylight, the rule is that twice its value must be paid, except in the case of a notoriously vicious buffalo,* only one-half of the value of which need be paid, and the owner of which must make good the damage to the crop.\n\n[Superior and Inferior Rights. Malacca Code.]\n\nTo declare the law regarding the fruit of trees growing in the kampong of another or in the capital town, if the proprietor (of the trees) does not give a share of such fruit to the owner of the land, so that they may enjoy it in common, but on the contrary sells such fruit (for his own benefit), one-third of the value thereof may be demanded, that is to say, two shares go to the proprietor of the kampong and one share to the owner of the land. If the former will not give it, but in his anger cuts down the trees and the land-owner presents himself before the judge for redress, the judge must order the value of the trees to be paid in accordance with the customary price of all fruit-trees growing in the kampong of others, and in like manner fruit must be appraised, the above custom of dividing in thirds being observed, and if it is sold by the proprietor of the kampong the owner of the ancient right to the land has the right to sue.\n\n* Compare the rule of English law as to animals of a known vicious disposition.

Regarding the Bandahara and Chiefs, however, if one of them grants a kampong to a person and nothing is known of it by the Raja until the case of the cultivating-proprietor is represented to him, or if any Chief takes the kampong or dusun of any person and grants it to another and the proprietor represents the matter to the Raja and the Raja confirms the grant, the proprietor of the kampong has no further cause of action, for the thing has been done with the knowledge of the Raja. The end.\n\n[Hypothecation of Land. Recovery of Land, &c., wrongfully taken. Malacca Code.]\n\nTo declare the law regarding the hypothecation of dusuns (groves of fruit-trees). Now hypothecation is of two kinds, the first is harus (\"lawful\"), the second is ganda harus (\"lawful to double\").\n\nIf a man hypothecates a dusun (grove of fruit-trees) or a kampong planted with fruit-trees to the Raja, and the trees do not bear fruit while in the possession of the bailee during the whole time of his possession, even though he wait for years, the creditor may claim double his money.\n\nProperty in respect of which this doubling cannot take place is a grove of cocoa-nut or betel-nut or other similar trees. The law is that ganda does not apply to these, and should the creditor claim it, in-\nnia hukum-nia dan jika di-ganda-kan maka di-b\u00e9ri tahu ka-\npada hakim maka hakim-lah jadi lawan-nia jika iya men-dapat\nbarang sa-bagei-nia benda yang ghraib kapada kampong orang\nyang di-pegang-kan-nia itu di-bahagi sa-per-tiga \u2018adat dan\nsa-bahagi pada yang memegang gadei itu dua bahagi pada\nampunia karana lagi iya menunggu di-tampat itu dan dami-\nkian lagi kampong yang di-anugraha akan orang besar-besar\njikalau iya men-dapat sa-suatu pen-dapat-an di-bahagi dua pada\nyang ampunia sa-bahagi dan kapada yang men-dapat sa-\nbahagi damikian-lah hukum-nia ada-pun hukum dusun dua\nbahagi uleh sa\u2019orang yang tiada ber-hutang maka di-makan-\nnia buah-nia dan di-jual-nia maka datang tuan-nia buleh di-\nd\u2019a-wa-nia dan damikian lagi segala orang yang di-murka-i uleh\nraja-raja maka lari iya pada negri lain sebab takut-nia.

Apa-bila di-b\u00e9ri-nia uleh\nsa\u2019orang laki-laki di-buboh pada sa\u2019orang di-suroh-nia ber-\nformation may be given to the judge, who shall oppose it. If the creditor finds any concealed property of value upon the land of the debtor which is held by him in hypothecation, the custom is that it shall be divided in three equal shares, one of which shall go to the holder of the mortgaged land, and two to the proprietor, for the finding has taken place while the creditor is in possession of the land. The same principle applies to land bestowed by the Raja upon Chiefs. If anything is found thereon, it must be divided in two equal shares, one of which goes to the owner of the land and the other to the finder. This is the law.\n\nNow regarding *dusun* there are two regulations, first in the case of a man to whom no debt is due, but he nevertheless eats the fruit of the *dusun* and sells it; in such a case, if the owner appears, he has a right of action. So in the case of persons who have incurred the displeasure of their Rajas and flee to other countries out of fear for their safety, abandoning heir *dusun* or *kampong*, which are forthwith taken by others. In their case also, the rightful owners may sue in after days, for the property is theirs and shall certainly be restored to them by the judge. The end.\n\n[Sub-letting. A stated rent necessary. *Perak Code*].\n\nThe law regarding the renting of land. If land be made over by a man to another, the latter being put in to cultivate it on the condition that he receives\nPri hukum orang yang menyewa rumah maka apa-kala binasa dengan sa\u2019suatu sabab-nia maka orang menyewa itu menyilih.\n\nJikalau handak di-binasa-kan per-janji-an maka di-pinta-nia-lah kambali akan sa-b\u00e9lah sewa-nia itu-umpama-nia sa\u2019orang menyewa rumah janji-nia sa\u2019puloh bulan sa-ratus timah maka di-diam-i-nia sa\u2019bulan rumah itu runtoh atau binasa di-kira-kira-kan sa\u2019bulan sa\u2019puloh timah dan yang sambilan puloh itu di-pinta-nia-lah kambali.

But if the land be let out in consideration of gold, or silver, or food, the amount of which is determined, this is lawful.\n\n[Lease of House Property. House at risk of owner. Perak Code.]\n\nThe law affecting the tenants of houses. If the house is destroyed by the fault of the tenant he must make good its value.\n\nShould the tenant desire to put an end to the agreement, he may demand that a proportionate part of the rent shall be returned to him. For instance, a man rents a house on the undertaking that he shall pay one hundred catties of tin for ten months; he resides there for one month, and then the house falls down, or is otherwise destroyed; in this case, ten catties of tin must be allowed for the one month of occupation, and he may demand that the remaining ninety catties shall be returned to him. If he likes to continue to live in that house, he can call upon the owner to repair it for him, for he has paid in advance.\n\nThe case may be put, \"if the rent has not been paid beforehand what will the law be?\" The answer is, at the time that he refuses to live in the house any longer, he must pay rent for the term that has already expired; or if he still desires to go on living in the place, he may call on the owner to repair and must pay all rent which subsequently becomes due.\nPri hukum benda yang sakutu bumi dan sagala per-buat-an dan sagala pohon kayu meng-ikut bumi itu.\n\nBer-mula apa-bila di-jual-nia ulch sa\u2019orang deri-pada dua itu akan benda yang sakutu itu kepada orang lain.

MALACCA LANDS.\n\nTuesday, 10th October, 1826.\n\nThe following European and Native Landed Proprietors were assembled this day at the Resident Councillor's Office for the purpose of enquiring into the particulars detailed below:\n\nB. De Wind, Esq.\nJ. B. Westerhout, Esq.\nG. Koek, Esq.\nA. Velge, Esq.\n\nThe Captain of Malays:\n\nAroom\nMahmat Tyre,\nLoerien,\nBooroe,\n\nInchis.\n\nM. de Souza was present by proxy in the person of his son.\n\nMessrs. De Wit, D. Koek, and G. de Souza, the Captain Kling and Dosso Bindasa were requested to attend, but unavoidable circumstances detained them elsewhere.\n\nThe above meeting took place for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the agreement subsisting respectively between the Government, the landed proprietors, the Penghulus (or intermediate officers between the landed proprietors and the tenants), and the immediate cultivators of the soil.\n\n1.\u2014Between the Government and the landed proprietors.\n\nOn a reference to the records in the Registrar's Office, it would appear that some grants expressly state the right of Government to resume the land, and all, so far as the inquiry has gone, seem to indicate an ultimate right of this nature.\n\nThe grantee, by the records, is generally supposed to receive the land under an engagement of clearing the same of jungle, and the right of resumption on the part of Government would seem to arise from the non-fulfilment of this expressed or implied duty on the part of the grantee.\n\nIn regard to this clause, implied or seemingly understood in favour of Government, the present proprietors state that, without\nquestioning the absolute right of Government on this point, they consider themselves as possessing in equity a full and inviolate title to their grounds, inasmuch as the land has been sold to, and handed over during a series of years to various individuals without any mention being made of such inherent reservation affecting their title. On being required to produce their title deeds and grants, the present landed proprietors can only show Bills of Sale. They state that all sales or transfers of land were made in the Court of Justice, which body detained all previous papers and deeds on delivering up the last Bill of Sale or Transfer, and that the Court did not intimate to them the reservation above, to which it was their duty to do, if such a right be recognised on the part of Government.\n\nThe proprietors acknowledge that they consider themselves bound, on the requisition of Government, to keep in repair all established bridges and roads running through the grounds, and to clean the banks and body of the river bordering on their estates from nuisances. But that all new roads are to be constructed at the expense of Government, who can carry such roads through any part of an estate, after intimating their intention to the immediate proprietors of the soil.\n\nThe proprietors acknowledge also, that in cases of emergency (if any such should occur), they are bound to provide for the peace of their respective estates by embodying a police from among their tenants.\n\n2.\u2014Between the landed proprietors and the Penghulus.\n\nThe appointment of Penghulus is not obligatory, but is left to the free will of the proprietor, being solely for his own convenience. On small estates there may be no intermediate officer. On estates somewhat larger, but possessing a paucity of tenants, there may be a mata-mata, who, under a more modest designation, is de facto a Penghulu, both in power and privilege. On estates possessing 15 or 20 houses, there is usually a Penghulu appointed. On extensive estates, there are several Penghulus, one being generally appointed for each respective quarter of an estate, which may incorporate parcels of ground of different names.\n\nThe Penghulu and Mata-mata are exempted from any tax or assessment on their property, and are supposed to settle all disputes of minor importance subsisting among the tenants. But this is by simple compromise, as they possess no judicial powers. They pay regard to the tranquillity of the estate, and are the medium of communication between the landed proprietors and the tenants.\nThe Penghulus are not Government Officers in any sense of the term, and prior to the British authority receiving over Malacca on 9th April, 1825, Government did not, in any respect, interfere with them. Since that period, the Penghulus have been compelled to appear in Court, to take an oath for correctly exercising their authority.\n\n3.\u2014Between the landed proprietors and the tenants.\n\nThe tenant settles on an estate by the verbal permission of the proprietor. There is no express law as to the rate of rent payable, but the custom in general is for the landlord to receive 10 per cent. upon all the produce of the soil, although, in some particular instances, so low as 6 per cent. has been accepted by way of encouragement. When spices or pepper are to be planted, there is usually a separate and sometimes a written engagement made, and no tithe is levied for the first 3 or 4 years.\n\nDuring the Dutch administration, the inhabitants were not permitted to cultivate padi, and the produce of the estate consisted chiefly in fruits, wood and charcoal. Padi cultivation is however now extending in all parts. The tithe of padi, spices and pepper is usually received at the residence or stores of the cultivators, and in most cases this tithe is taken by estimation rather than by absolute measurement, which is found to be inconvenient. But the tithe of other articles is generally received in cash, after the same have been disposed of, and in case of apparent fraud, the sale must be traced, in order to ascertain the truth or error of such a suspicion. The land-holder possesses no right to establish his own mode of assessment or revenue, whether as to time, or place, or rate. In the collection of these tithes, some proprietors farm out their revenues, and others receive them through their own agents.\n\nA tenant may sell, transfer, devise, &c. the portions of land he may cultivate, and he is free to cultivate the soil to any extent. He may quit the estate at his free pleasure. But the land-holder cannot force him off the estate without just cause of offence. When this exists, a proper time must be granted to the tenant to enable him to dispose of his property.\n\nIf such tenant appears dilatory in effecting his arrangements, the land-holder may assemble the Penghulus and elderly people as a committee of appraisement, and the land-holder paying the amount according to their estimate, can oblige the tenant to quit the estate.\n\nIf the tenant feels aggrieved with the conduct or the judgment of the Penghulu, he is to apply to his landlord, and in all cases,\nwithout exception, where disputes or differences of opinion may subsist between the tenant and his landlord, which cannot otherwise be compromised, the appeal lies to Government.\n\nWednesday, 11th October, 1826.\n\nAs the nature of the landed tenures, so far as respects the relative right of Government and the landed proprietors, remains involved in some obscurity, the following order was issued, and it is believed that the question at issue will be satisfactorily elucidated when the Register required in this order may be completed.\n\nWith a view to ascertain the precise nature of the landed tenures, so as to complete the information which was yesterday elucidated at a meeting of the principal landed proprietors, the Dutch Translator is requested to examine the records in the office of the Registrar, who is to assist in the said enquiry, and extract from thence the particulars necessary to fill up an Abstract Registry of the following form:\n\nAbstract Registry of the Grants of Land made by Government from the earliest periods to the Inhabitants of Malacca.\n\n| No. | Date of Grant. | Names of Grantee. | Names and Extent of Land grant- ed. | Resumption by the Letter. | Resumption not stated. | Right of Resump- tion cut off by Letter. | Dates and Imposi- tions. | Remarks. |\n|-----|----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------|\n\nThe Land Surveyor will also draw up a draft of the Territory of Malacca, grounded upon the map in the Resident's office. In this draft, the Land Surveyor will trace, in double lines, the several divisions according to the original grants of Government and with Roman letters will refer to the foot of the map, or to an appended Schedule, exhibiting the dates of the original grants, names of the grantees, and other particulars as set forth in the Register to be completed by the Dutch Translator as above directed. The Land\nSurveyor will then trace off, with colours only, the present distribution of territory, using numbers, in lieu of Roman letters, for references as above.\n\nAs this Register and the map are to be submitted to the Hon'ble the Governor, the period of whose arrival is very uncertain, the Dutch Translator and Land Surveyor are requested to exercise such practicable expedition as may be compatible with a clean elucidation of the points in question.\n\nExtract from a Minute by Mr. Fullerton, Governor of the Straits Settlements, dated the 24th of November, 1827.\n\nAll the papers connected with Lands of Malacca being under preparation for transmission to Bengal, I now record a minute to accompany them, being an abstract of past transactions in that department.\n\nThe Lands of Malacca extend along the coast of the Malay Peninsula 39 miles, their greatest breadth inland, without including Naning, 28 miles containing square miles 654, or acres 418,560. Of this, 500 square miles, or acres 320,000, are capable of wet rice cultivation, and of which 500 acres are now supplied to be actually cultivated. Of the dry lands, acres 10,000 may be supposed to be planted with fruit trees, or in gardens, acres 88,560 waste and covered with forest.\n\nThe whole of the lands appeared to have been assigned over to certain of the inhabitants nearly one hundred years ago. On first enquiry and examination of the deeds held by the present proprietors as they were called, descendants of the first grantees, the Government were led to view them as absolute proprietors and owners of the soil at full liberty to rent and derive the utmost advantage from them. On a further enquiry, however, and the examination of the Dutch records, it was found that only the Government right of levying from the resident inhabitants a tenth of the produce had been granted to them, and Proclamations were discovered interdicting, under heavy penalties, the demand of any rent or tax beyond the tenth of the produce. The persons thus investing with the Government right, it appeared, took little pains to encourage or extend the cultivation. Residing at Malacca and never quitting the town, the right of levying the tax was sold annually to certain Chinese inhabitants, who appear to have exercised over the inhabitants the right of compulsory labour and a\ndegree of power inconsistent with the improvement of the country. In reality, as the exercise of Police functions seems to have been a part of the tenure, the whole authority over the country rested with a few Chinese contractors. In order to open to Government the means of direct management of the lands with a view of encouraging and extending cultivation, as well as maintaining due control over the inhabitants, the redemption of the Government right to the tenth from the persons called proprietors presented itself as a most desirable measure. The collections having been rented, and the renters supposed to gain considerably, it was calculated that, by agreeing to pay to the proprietors a sum, even a little exceeding that received by them at present, little, if any, immediate loss would be sustained, and the Government would, besides the levy of the tenth on the lands actually occupied, be entitled to dispose of the waste and derive a growing revenue from the gradual extension of cultivation and increase of produce, to a portion of which they would be entitled. A settlement was accordingly made with the proprietors, whereby Government agree to pay annually according to the list. In consideration of which, the proprietors agreed to make over to Government all right derived from previous grants given by the preceding Government, surrendering all such as were in their possession. More than a year having expired, the following is the result:\n\nThe total amount to be charged against the land.\n\nFirst, payable to former Proprietors, ... 16,270 0 0\nSecond, Contingencies, ... ... 145 5 9\nThird, Establishment, ... ... 4,560 0 0\n\n20,975 5 9\n\nCollection, ... 15,400 12 1\n\nDifference, ... 5,574 9 8\n\nR.

The investigations requisite for the adjustment of the landed tenures at Malacca have, we are happy to see, been satisfactorily performed, and the adjustment itself completed. The following are the points which have been ascertained:\n\n1st.\u2014That the pecuniary claim of Government upon the soil, by the custom of the place, and of the neighbouring Malay States, amounted to one tenth of the produce.\n\n2ndly.\u2014That the persons called the proprietors, mostly Dutch colonists resident at Malacca, were merely persons to whom Government had granted out its tenth, and who had no other claims upon the produce, nor upon the occupiers, not founded in abuse.\n\n3rdly.\u2014That the occupiers, therefore, were the real proprietors of the soil.\n\n4thly.\u2014That the Panghooloos were merely the Agents of Government, or of the persons called the proprietors, for collecting the tenth share, and performing certain duties of the nature of Police, attached by custom to the proprietorship.\n\n157. We are extremely glad that you have been able to effect, with the body of proprietors, an arrangement whereby they make over to you the whole of their rights, for the fixed annual payment, about equal to the present amount of their annual receipts. You propose to manage the lands directly on account of Government, employing the Panghooloos as Collectors and Police Officers. They are probably the most efficient instruments whom, in the present state of society at Malacca, you have it in your power to employ. They will, however, require a vigilant superintendence, and the more so since the administration of justice, as at present organised, does not afford to the cultivators so accessible or expeditious a means of redress in case of their sustaining any injury, as to dispense with the necessity of other securities.\n\n158. You have reserved, as the privilege of Government, the absolute disposal of all lands hitherto unreclaimed, or which hereafter be suffered to run again into forest and remain unproductive for five years.\n\n159. The limits of all lands occupied by individuals are to be, as soon as possible, determined by survey, and defined by Grants duly issued and registered. All future transfers of landed proper-\nty are likewise to be registered: all these arrangements are highly proper.\n\n169. You have prepared a \"Regulation for declaring the rights of the Government over the lands within the territories of Malacca and providing for the due collection of the Government share of the produce thereof.\" This Regulation, consisting of thirteen paragraphs, you have transmitted for the sanction of the home authorities. We have already separately expressed to you our approbation of most of the arrangements to which this Ordinance is intended to give effect. We have now to add, that it is worded with remarkable clearness and precision and the rights of Government and of the occupiers are exactly and at the same time concisely defined. We, therefore, in conformity with the provisions of the Act 53 Geo. III Chap. 155, hereby sanction, with the approbation of the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, the draft as a Regulation which you have submitted to us, and of which we have already transcribed the title; and we direct this Regulation be promulgated and enforced, on the receipt of this despatch.\n\nA.

BOND,\nAssistant Resident.\n\nExtract from a Minute by Mr. Fullerton, dated the 29th January, 1828.\n\nIn my minute of the 5th July, 1827, I entered into the consideration of the land tenures, but rather to record the apparent contradiction in terms or incompatibility of a supposed ownership of land with a right of levying no more than 10 per cent. of the produce, or without that of forbidding the occupancy of land except under such term as might be agreed on between parties. The main and express object of that minute was to excite further enquiries and draw forth further information on the subject apparently little understood. Mr. Lewis has now made a further report, and has submitted two documents out of the records which lend to throw much light on the whole subject. I allude to the order issued by the Dutch Government in the year 1819 referring to one of 1773. These documents render clear the terms and understanding under which the persons denominated proprietors hold their lands. It expressly interdicts and prohibits proprietors from levying as a tax from occupants of land\nmore than one-tenth of the produce. From this it appears that the Government of the day gave up to the proprietors, not the absolute right or ownership over the land, but only the Government right over it, that is, the tax of one-tenth of the produce. As far as I can trace from every enquiry, it appears that along the whole Eastern Coast of the Bay of Bengal from the commencement of the Burmese Territories to Point Romania, the right of the Sovereign is supposed to consist of one-tenth of the produce.* The ownership of the land is originally vested in the King, by whom it is made over to subordinate occupants to cultivate and render productive, on the term of yielding a tenth of the produce of every article.\u2020 The object of the late Government in assigning to the persons designated as proprietors the right of levying a tenth, probably was to make it the interest of certain individuals to introduce, encourage and extend the cultivation of the lands. In some deeds those terms are expressly mentioned. How far that object has been attained will best appear by the former report of Mr. Lewis. It appears by that report, that of 1,400 square miles, only acres 5,653 are in cultivation. It appears that so far from the persons called proprietors taking any pains to that purpose, they never even visit these estates, that they do not even themselves collect their tenth, but rent it in the mass once a year to a China contractor by public sale, who, having only one year's interest in the country, extracts from it the utmost he can, and it appears not only from the report of Mr. Lewis, but my own enquiries, that an excess is sometimes levied beyond the tenth, moreover that services are required, and labour exacted, from the tenants; in short they are kept in a state of vassalage and servitude quite inconsistent with the encouragement of cultivation. The right of levying the Government rent carries with it all the rent power of the State. That right vested in the Dutch proprietors, by them transferred in the mass to Chinese, has established a power and influence in that class too great even for the Officers of Government to hold in check. The advantages, therefore, that would result from the redemption of the rights of Government are too obvious to require further illustration. The present proprietors are stated to be willing to part with their privileges on certain terms and conditions. According to my idea.\n\n* I exclude that portion of the coast held by the Siamese Government. It is known that the Chief of Ligore takes in kind 40 per cent. of the produce, leaving to the cultivator bare subsistence.\n\n\u2020 Here then we find, as in many parts of India, two distinct rights:\u2014(1) The right to the Government tenth. (2) The right of occupancy vested in the subordinate tenant on their paying the tenth.\nthese should be settled on the principle of tendering them in the shape of an annual payment the full equivalent of which they now receive. That is to say, the proprietors should agree on their own behalf and that of their heirs to surrender and deliver up all rights, privileges and advantages, resulting from this present title, to Government, receiving in return a certain annual sum, payable as long as the British Government shall remain in possession of Malacca. It might have been expedient to have awaited the orders of the Hon'ble Court of Directors before such a measure was carried into execution, but it appears to me that the case admits of no delay. Unless immediate advantage be taken of the disposition evinced by the proprietors to part with their titles, the object may be entirely defeated, for it is impossible to say what complicated rights may arise, and come into judicial decision which may oppose difficulties to future arrangement. It is clear that, by agreeing to pay a sum equivalent to the present amount of their receipts, or even something more\u2014the right being rented and a certain excess of profit, without reckoning undue exaction, must remain to the contractor, and which would, of course, be levied by the Officers of Government\u2014no loss could occur. In support of such an arrangement, and to induce consent to such, it may be pointed out to the proprietors that, by their tenures, they are bound to perform certain services, which, though neglected by the late Government, will be required under our administration; that in all old Grants the right of Government to impose a land tax is expressly reserved, is indeed inherent in every Government, and must, in all probability, be reverted to at no distant period, as it is not to be supposed that Government can be at the expense of affording efficient protection to the country without some contribution of the people, levied in all other countries for purpose of Government. The titles to many of the principal estates as they are called, I have reason to believe are of a very questionable nature, and if strictly scrutinised would be found probably very defective: they have on some occasions been acquired, and their limits extended by the exercise of private and undue influence rather than the sanction of public authority. The circumstance of their having been long in possession of the right, such as they are, is the main argument to induce the offer of pecuniary compensation for their redemption. Should the proprietors, as they are called, decline coming to terms, a strict investigation must take place; the terms expressly stipulated on those quoted in Mr. Lewis's last report, that is, the right of resumption must be exerted whenever they can be traced. The offer of paying an annual sum to the proprietor involves no admission of their claims,\nfor it must be understood that only on their accepting these terms we waive all enquiry. It would appear that many of the original title deeds lodged in the Office of the Court have been made away with, I entertain little doubt, by persons interested, and that the right of resumption and the provision for cultivating and improving them was inserted in all. Should the proprietors assent to the transfer, our course will be very clear; we shall then stand in their place in relation to the actual tenantry. The possession of the lands now occupied and cultivated must, of course, be ensured to them, that is, on the payment of the regular tenth and no more, due notice must be given them that all existing rights will be carefully preserved to them, that regular papers will be given to them specifying and defining the land attached to each, and securing possession to them and their heirs on the established terms. They must be told that they are relieved from all vassalage and feudal services whatever, that their labour is free, that in rendering the tenth of the produce, all pecuniary obligations due to the State are fulfilled, and that for every article required over and above, payment will be made. It must, however, be understood that the settlement to be made with the occupants will embrace only the lands actually cleared, occupied and cultivated; to all lands actually waste and forest the right of Government is reserved; for the gradual clearing of all such lands, arrangement must from time to time be made by the Officers of Government, and in this respect the known and established principle will be observed. That is, to grant cutting papers to such as may apply, to allow to the parties the occupation of the land free of any payment for a given number of years, after which to be liable to the payment of the established tenth or such other terms as Government may settle with the parties. In a country where the soil is particularly rich and fertile, the climate peculiarly favourable and healthy, where due care and attention exist towards the protection of the persons and property of the inhabitants, influx of population and great extension of cultivation may be reasonably expected.\n\nHaving made these observations respecting the lands, and proposed a certain course to be eventually pursued, the next point for consideration is the Police of the country. From the report of Mr. Garling above alluded to (of the 11th December), I infer generally that there exists no Police in the interior, that the authority of Government has never been established, that the few inhabitants occupying lands near our frontier are subjected to constant annoyance from the Chiefs and inhabitants beyond them, that the proprietors can neither collect their tenth, or even prevail\non any one to reside there. It appears from Mr. Lewis's report that certain persons under the Chief of Moar have been allowed to establish themselves within the boundaries known from time immemorial as the boundary of Malacca up to Mount Ophir; that this encroachment has been brought about by the aid and connivance of a Dutch proprietor, who was content to act as sub-renter of that Chief, who brought persons into Court to depose to points affecting the limits of the territory; thus, by a strange inconsistency, the sovereign rights of Government, determinable by them only in the Political Department, were brought into discussion in a Municipal Court, which had no jurisdiction whatever in the case. The circumstance of a Dutch subject coming forward to infringe the limits of Dutch territory, affords proof of the singular power assumed by the individual, and the strange laxity and inattention of the Government to their own interest. It would appear indeed, from all I can learn, that the whole time Malacca remained under us, from 1795 to the end of 1818, the public authorities took but little interest in the affairs of the place. Holding it only for a time, the Dutch laws continued in force, and the Dutch Court of Justice was continued in operation, but instead of confining its powers to its proper duties\u2014the administration of Municipal Law\u2014the case before us shows that the Court in reality performed the functions of Government. I mention this subject now, in order to induce caution on the part of the public Officers in parting with the Records of the Dutch Court in Judicial Proceedings, since it seems evident they contain as much matter of Government as of Justice; the whole of the Records should, therefore, be kept as Government Records, the Officer of the Court of Judicature being allowed to inspect, examine and take copies when required. In respect to the measure to be pursued in order to effect the removal of the persons from Moar, and the restoration of the integrity of our territory, I am of opinion a letter should be written to the Chief of Moar to recall them. If not attended to, the gunboat with a party of Sepoys and a careful person may be sent up to a proper position to insist on their removal, but I apprehend little fear of opposition to our wishes. In respect to Police generally, it may be observed that, so long as the present persons called proprietors continue to levy their tenth, they must perform the reciprocal obligation imposed by their tenure of maintaining the peace of the country. In not performing that duty, they have entirely failed in their obligation to the State. Were the Government, therefore, now to maintain Police Establishments, it would only be to incur an expense which the proprietors ought to pay, and they should be distinctly informed that so long as they exercise the pro-\nper functions of Government in the collection of the tenth, deriving the profit thereby, they must perform the reciprocal duty. Another duty properly belonging to the proprietors is that of repairing roads, bridges, paths, &c.; this duty appears to have been much neglected; by all account the roads are by no means in the state they used to be, and ought to be in; the little labour that has been bestowed, I suspect to have been the forced labour of the inhabitants, extracted from them by the proprietors, and not paid for. Should the proprietors agree to part with their titles on reasonable terms, the establishment of a regular Police will not be a difficult matter. The enquiries I have made confirm me in the belief that the Panghooloos are the fittest instruments of Police, they appear to be the principal inhabitants of these villages or divisions. Their proper duty has indeed been to levy the tenth on account of the proprietor. When the proprietor puts his right up to outcry and sells to a Chinese contractor this duty seems to be done by the contractor himself, much to the prejudice of the people; the Panghooloo continues, however, to enjoy the immunities of his office\u2014exemption from the payment of the tithe. Two of the Panghooloos I met with at Ayer Panas, distinctly informed me that their fathers were the Panghooloos before them, and that they expected their sons to succeed them. I infer that by the custom of the country the office is hereditary in families, and I think the admission of such practice generally beneficial, as more likely to ensure good conduct and being consonant to the idea of the people. To render the Police efficient throughout the country, it would only be necessary to appoint the Panghooloo the Superintendent of the Police, to use the European term, Constable of his division, to allow him one or more Peons, to explain to him his duties, they are in this case very simple\u2014to seize, and send in all persons breaking the peace or committing crimes and offences, and to execute orders from the superior Magisterial authorities of the country; other duties naturally present themselves\u2014that of keeping a correct list of all the inhabitants of his division, their characters and mode of life, requiring all newcomers and passers by to report themselves, allowing no person to settle without a register, or report to and license from superior authority. In their Revenue capacity, that is, as a servant of the proprietors, eventually of Government, his duty will be to collect the tenth, to report the state of the crops and of the general cultivation. The duties, if I may use the expression, of Revenue and Police are so blended, that they can best be performed by the same person. As to the argument that may be used in respect to abuse of powers, we must recollect that all power in human hands is liable to abuse, that abuse would probably be\ngreater, certainly not less, by the employment of a separate stipendiary establishment of strangers\u2014Chuliahs or Chinese. Abuse of power can only be prevented by constant local supervision of the Public Servants of Government, and whether the rights of Government are redeemed or left with proprietors, the occasional presence and inspection of Public Officers is indispensable. The expense of erecting a few bungalows in different parts of the country would be very trifling, and I propose that no time be lost in their commencement. They should be built at different directions, at intervals of from six to ten miles,* and the roads between them made and kept in repair. To facilitate the means of communication is the first step to improvement and extension of cultivation. When ready means of access are afforded, when men find that they are alike secure at a distance from the town as they are on the spot, the lands then will be occupied and brought into cultivation, and it is only when that general protection shall have been fully established that we can expect Malacca to assume the appearance of a British Settlement. The communication between the Public Officers and the people should be at all times direct, free and unreserved. The interest of Government can never be separated from the prosperity, protection and happiness of the people. We can, therefore, have no object in deceit or concealment of our intention towards them, and from the knowledge possessed by Mr. Lewis of the language, habits and customs of the Malays in general, I am led to hope his endeavours will be successful in leading the inhabitants of the Malacca Territories fully to understand and duly to appreciate our views in regard to them.\n\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nCOURT OF JUDICATURE OF PRINCE OF WALES' ISLAND, SINGAPORE AND MALACCA.\n\nMalacca, the 7th day of March, 1829.\n\nBefore Sir John Thomas Claridge, Recorder, and Samuel Garling, Esquire, Resident Councillor.\n\n* At Naning, at or about Tualang Hill; at or about Pangkalan Naning; at Ayer Panas; at half-distance; at the Pepper Plantation; at Supan Hill; at Garling Hill; at Lingy.\nAbdullatif v.

B.\u2014In this case, it was proved that in the territories of Malacca the owners of the soil and the cultivators of it are entirely distinct persons, except in, and in the immediate vicinity of, the Town.\n\nThat the owner of the soil cannot eject the cultivator as long as he continues to pay him a certain portion of the produce\u2014generally one-tenth.\n\nThat the owner of the soil may sell, or otherwise dispose of his interest, without prejudice to the cultivator, and the cultivator vice versa.\n\nThat in case the cultivator allows the land to lie waste, the owner of the soil may eject him by due process of law.\n\nThat the fact of lands lying uncultivated for periods, is evidence of waste.\n\nThat the period for paddy is ... 3 years.\nCocoa-nut trees and other fruit-trees is ... 3 years.\nGambier, ... ... 1 year.\nPepper, ... ... 1 year.*\n\n---\n\nSUPREME COURT,\nMalacca.\n\nBefore Sir P. Benson Maxwell, C. J.\n\nMarch 17, 1870.\n\nSahrip v. Mitchell and Endain.\n\nTrespass. Meaning of the expression \"hold by prescription\" used in sec. 12 of Indian Act 16 of 1839, with respect to lands in Malacca.\n\n* Extracted from the Civil Court Book for Malacca, Vol. 1.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an action of trespass. The petition contains two counts\u2014one for expelling the plaintiff from his land and preventing him from reaping the growing crop; the second, for breaking and entering into his dwelling house and expelling him from it, whereby he was prevented from carrying on his business, and was compelled to procure another dwelling. The first three pleas deny the trespass and the possession. The fourth alleges that the plaintiff, not being a cultivator or resident tenant holding by prescription, was, by a duly served notice, informed that the land in question had been assessed by Government from the 1st of January, 1870, at 97 cents per annum, and was therein also called upon by the Collector to take out proper title for the land, within a month from the date of the service of the notice, and that in default he would be ejected. The plea then avers that the plaintiff would neither comply with the terms of the notice, nor remove from the land within a month; and that the defendants, by the order of the Collector, and in the exercise of the powers given to him by Act 16 of 1839, assisted him in ejecting the plaintiff, which are the trespasses, &c.\n\nThe Act referred to authorises the Collector, by section 3, to eject persons in occupation of land otherwise than under a grant or title from Government, if they refuse to \"engage for or to remove from\" it within a month from the date on which they are called upon by him to enter into such engagement or to remove. But the last section of the Act excepts from its provisions \"such cultivators and resident tenants of Malacca as hold their lands by prescription, subject only to a payment of one-tenth part of the produce thereof, whether such payment be made in kind\" or in money.\n\nThe trespass was clearly proved; indeed, it was in substance admitted. It was proved or admitted that a notice in the terms stated in the fourth plea, signed by the Lieut.-Governor, had been served on the petitioner a month before, and that by that officer's orders, the defendant Mitchell, a Clerk in the Land Office, accompanied by another Clerk of the same Office, went in company with the other defendant, Endain, who is a Police Duffadar, three other Policemen, and an European Inspector, to the house of the plaintiff at about 11 A.M. on the 24th December. The Policemen were armed with swords, and one of the Europeans with a double-barrelled gun. The plaintiff was absent; but they turned his wife and family out of the house, and the furniture was removed from it by their orders. The garden and paddy land were also taken possession of; they were afterwards sold by auction by Mitchell; and the plaintiff\nwas kept out of possession down to the present time. The plaintiff's wife made some imputations, in the course of her evidence, on the conduct of defendants and their comrades, in aggravation of the trespass, to the effect that her box had been broken open and some money taken from it, and that some of her furniture had been broken; and she also spoke of a threat to burn down the house if she did not leave it; but, as I stated yesterday at the close of the case, I did not think the imputations sufficiently borne out to be entitled to credit. They were denied by Mitchell; they were not corroborated, as they might have been, if true, by other testimony; and I had no evidence that any complaint had been made at the time, of the loss or destruction of the money or goods. A question arose in the course of the case, whether the Lieut.-Governor was a \"Collector\" within the meaning of the Act 16 of 1839, and another, whether the notice was in accordance with the 3rd section, as it did not require the plaintiff \"to engage for or remove from\" the land; but in the view which I take of the main question in the case, viz., whether the plaintiff is one of those \"cultivators or tenants holding by prescription,\" who are excepted from the provisions of the Act by the 12th section, it is not necessary that I should express any opinion on them.\n\nThe term \"prescription\" does not apply in English law, as Mr. Davidson justly observed, to land, but only to incorporeal hereditaments, such as rights of way, common or light; and if the term were construed in its strictly technical sense, it would find no application to cultivators of land. We had no statute of limitations in this country, relating to land, until 1859, and if \"prescription\" were to be understood as referring to a title to land acquired by long occupation, the section in question would find little or no application here, because the title acquired by the cultivators and tenants in Malacca does not depend on any statute or law of limitations. But there is another sense in which the term may have been used, viz., in the sense of \"custom,\" and in this sense it would make the section so widely and justly applicable to the circumstances of this Settlement that it appears to me beyond doubt that it is in this sense that the Legislature used it.\n\n\"Prescription,\" properly so called, is personal; it is the title acquired by long usage by a particular person and his ancestors, or the preceding owners of the estates in respect of which the right is so acquired. A \"custom\" is also established by long usage, but unlike prescription it is \"local\" not personal; when once established, it becomes the law of the place where it prevails, to the exclusion of the ordinary law; and those who have a right under it, have\nit, not because they and their ancestors or predecessors have long enjoyed it, as in the case of prescription, but simply because the custom of local law gives it to them, without any reference to the length of their enjoyment. In the case of prescription, long usage gives title to an individual; in the case of custom, long usage establishes the custom, and it is the custom, become law, which gives title to a class of persons in a locality, and gives it to them at once. The two things are essentially different, but there is a sufficient similarity or analogy between them\u2014usage being an element common to both\u2014to account for their being occasionally confounded; and I think it plain, from the history of the land tenure of Malacca, that it was in the sense of \"custom\" that the term \"prescription\" was used in the Act of 1839.\n\nIt is well known that by the old Malay law or custom of Malacca, while the Sovereign was the owner of the soil, every man had nevertheless the right to clear and occupy all forest and waste land, subject to the payment, to the Sovereign, of one-tenth of the produce of the land so taken. The trees which he planted, the houses which he built, and the remaining nine-tenths of the produce, were his property, which he could sell, or mortgage, or hand down to his children. If he abandoned the paddy land or fruit trees for three years, or his gambier or pepper plantations for a year, his rights ceased, and all reverted to the Sovereign. If, without deserting the land, he left it uncultivated longer than was usual or necessary, he was liable to ejectment. See Mr. Newbold's Work on the Straits of Malacca, vol. I, 160. It is clear that rights thus acquired are not prescriptive, in the technical sense of the term, but customary. They are acquired as soon as the land is occupied and reclaimed, and the title requires no lapse of time to perfect it.\n\nIt was contended by the Solicitor-General that such a custom was unreasonable and therefore invalid; but if such an objection could now be raised after its long recognition, as I shall presently show, I should not hesitate to hold that the custom was not only reasonable, but very well suited to any country like this, where the population is thin and the uncleared land is superabundant and of no value. It must be for the advantage of the State to attract settlers to lands which are worthless as forest and swamp, and thus to increase at once the population and the wealth of the country. A similar custom or law prevails in Sumatra. (Marsden's Sumatra, 224.) In Java, every Javanese has the right to occupy uncleared land, paying for it by giving the State his personal labour on road-making or similar public work, one day in five, or now, under the\nDutch, one day in seven; and though it might seem unreasonable in England that one person should acquire an indefeasible title to occupy the land of another by felling his forest and ploughing the land. I think that, in the circumstances of these countries, it is neither unreasonable nor impolitic for the sovereign power to offer such terms to persons willing to reclaim and cultivate its waste lands. But it is too late to question its reasonableness, after a long and continuous recognition, amounting virtually to an offer of forest land to all who chose to clear it, on the terms of the custom.\n\nThe Portuguese, while they held Malacca, and, after them, the Dutch, left the Malay custom or *lex non scripta* in force. That it was in force when this Settlement was ceded to the Crown appears to be beyond dispute; and that the cession left the law unaltered is equally plain on general principles. (Campbell v. Hall, Cowp. 244, 209.) It was held in this Court by Sir John Claridge, in 1829, to be then in full force*; and although it was decided by Sir B. Malkin in 1834\u2020 in conformity with what had been held in India, that the law of England had been introduced into the Settlement by the Charter which created the Supreme Court, it seems to me clear that the law so introduced would no more supersede the custom in question, than it supersedes local customs in England. Further, the custom has always been recognised by the Government; down to the present time tenths are collected, both in kind and in money, from the holders of land acquired under the custom; and from 1838 to 1853, commutations of the tenths into money payments were frequently made by deeds between the East India Company and the tenants, in which it was recited that the Company \"possessed the right of taking for the use of the Government one-tenth of the produce of all lands in the Settlement of Malacca.\" The Malacca Land Act of 1839 plainly refers to and recognises the same customary tenure, when it \"declares\" that \"all cultivators and resident tenants of lands\" (the sovereign or quasi-manorial rights of which had been granted away by the Dutch Government) \"who hold their title by prescription, are, and shall be subject to the payment of one-tenth of the produce thereof to Government,\" either in kind or in money fixed in commutation.\n\nThat the 12th Section of the Act of 1839\u2021 would be justly ap-\n\n---\n\n* See the case of Abdullah v. Mahomed Meera Lebe, supra, p. xxxvii.\n\u2020 See Judgment of S.r B. H. Malkin; In the goods of Abdullah deceased.\u2014Morton's Decisions, p. 19.\n\u2021 Section 12 of A.t XVI of 1839 is as follows:\u2014\"And it is hereby provided that nothing in this Act contained shall apply to such cultivators and resident tenants of Malacca as hold their lands by prescription, subject only to a payment to Government of one-tenth part of the produce thereof, whether such payment be made in kind or in the form of a sum of money received by the Government in commutation of the payment in kind.\"\nplicable to these customary tenants, can admit of little doubt, when it is considered that that Act made all persons, in general terms, holding lands in these Settlements otherwise than under Government grants, liable to assessment \"in such manner, at such rate, \"and under such conditions\" as the Collector, under instructions from Government, chose to impose; and authorised the Collector to eject all those who declined to \"engage for\" (that is, I suppose, to accept the terms of the Government), \"or remove from the land\" in their occupation. These provisions, suitable enough to new Settlements like Singapore and Penang, where neither custom nor even prescription had had time to spring up, could not, without manifest injustice, have been applied to persons in Malacca, who had already a good title to their land by the law or custom of the place; it was to be expected that provision should be made for excepting such a numerous and important class of persons from their operation, and it seems to me that provision was made for that purpose by the 12th section, the Legislature using the word \"prescription,\" not in its technical meaning, in which it would be insensible, having regard to the circumstances of the Settlement, but in the sense of local custom, usage or law, with which it is readily confounded.\n\nIf this be so, it is plain that the plaintiff was not liable to ejectment by the Collector for declining \"to take out the proper \"title\" for the land in his occupation, under the Act of 1839. It was forest and uncultivated land when he cleared it in 1829, and he paid tenths to the Government from that time until 1853, when he was appointed Penghulu. This appointment he held until 1868, and during his tenure of it he was, as is usual, exempted from payment. He was deprived of the appointment in 1868, and he paid tenths again in 1869. He is, therefore, plainly one of the customary tenants protected by the 12th section of the Act of 1839.\n\nThe only remaining question, then, is as to the damages. The plaintiff claims three hundred dollars. It seems to me that a serious wrong was done him, and that he sustained serious injury when he was expelled from his home and from his land. He had lived there for forty years, and I shall not conceal that I have some sympathy for the feelings of the Malay peasant, driven from his cottage, from the orchard which he planted and the field which he reclaimed\u2014from his home, in a word, and from the fruits of his labour\u2014because he would not give up his good title for one which he was not bound to accept, and nobody had the right to impose on him. But further, the injury was done by or under the orders of an officer, or officers, invested with certain powers, and under the colour of those\npowers; and I think that, when public officers set about exercising powers which necessarily inflict suffering or injury, or interfere with the rights or liberties of any person, they ought to be extremely cautious in what they do, or make their agents or subordinates do. Here, the defendants, acting on their own or their superiors' view of the law (it matters not which, as regards the plaintiff), committed a breach of the law, and a breach which might have resulted in a breach of the peace; for among the seven men engaged in the trespass, several were armed, and if the plaintiff had happened to be present, they might have encountered resistance; blood might have been shed, and the officers of the law would have had to answer for all the consequences of having been trespassers and wrong-doers. On the other hand, most of our native peasants, in the plaintiff's place, whether they resisted or yielded, at the time, to the display of force in the name of the law, would not have ventured, as the plaintiff has, to question its legality in a Court of Justice, and they would thus be permanently dispossessed contrary to law. For these reasons, I think it my duty to do what in me lies to discourage such proceedings; and, therefore, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I shall give the plaintiff the amount of the damages which he has claimed.\n\nJudgment for the plaintiff for 300 dollars.\n\nAPPENDIX IV.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nA complaint having been laid before the Court of Justice that the Captain Malayu, land-holder for Sungei Pootat and Batoo Brandam, has demanded from his tenants more than $\\frac{1}{10}$ on the produce and also on sales or transfers of the property of cultivators,\n\nConsidering that it is against the rules and regulations of the place and opposed to the prosperity of the Settlement, we have found it advisable, in order to obviate this evil, to make known by proclamation that any one found guilty of exacting from any of his tenants a rent exceeding the tenth of the produce, will be\nfined 500 Rix dollars for such offence\u2014one-half of which will be given to the Churches and the other half to the Government.\n\n14th December, 1773.\n\nJOHN CRANS.\nG.

CASSA.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nWe, John Samuel Timmerman Thyssen, Governor of Malacca and its Dependencies, to all to whom these Presents may come, send greeting:\n\nWhereas it has come to our knowledge that several covetous persons, proprietors of landed estates, have demanded from their tenants residing on their estates and possessing plantations, which through their industry have been brought to perfection, more than the fixed rate of ten per cent. on the produce of such plantations, and whereas it has also been represented to us that, on the transfer or sale of such plantations, the landed proprietors have demanded ten per cent. upon the amount realized for the same;\n\nAll of which, we consider to be an unwarrantable extortion, by which the prosperity of the settlement and the interests of the industrious inhabitants, must in a great measure be affected;\n\nSo it is, that in order to obviate this evil, we direct the following to be promulgated:\n\n1st.\u2014That the proprietors of lands shall be satisfied to levy only a tenth upon the produce of their leased lands.\n\n2nd.\u2014That whenever money shall be paid by the tenants of their leased lands or plantations, instead of payment being made in kind, the landed proprietors must, in such cases, annually pass a contract in the presence of two witnesses, viz., the Penghooloo of the district, and the High Priest residing in the neighbourhood, who shall declare that none of the contracting parties have been compelled to enter into such an engagement.\nFurther, it shall be free to every tenant, after he has planted his ground with fruit trees, or cultivated it, to dispose of the same to another person, without paying to the land-holders the ten per cent.\n\nWe renew, against this extortion, the proclamation of the Governor and Director Jan Crans, bearing date 14th December, 1773, and enforce the penalty of 500 Rix dollars denounced in that publication against the transgressor of this order, the one half of which amount will go to the poor funds and the other to the informer.\n\nIt is understood by this, that in the event of a tenant wishing to dispose of his plantation, or transfer it to another, the land-holder shall have the preference on paying down the sum offered by another.\n\nAnd that no one may plead ignorance, this publication will be published in the Dutch, Portuguese, Malay and Chinese languages.\n\n20th May, 1819.\n\nAPPENDIX V.\n\nEVIDENCE OF TITLE.\n\nSPECIMENS OF DUTCH DOCUMENTS.\n\nI.\u2014\u201cPROPRIETOR\u2019S\u201d GRANT.\n\nGovert van Hoorn, Governor and Director of the Town and Fortress of Malacca, in the place of the late Inche Hollanda, Malay Translator and Writer of the East India Company, to whom the land of Battan Tiga, extending in length from Tanjong Broas to Coeleban Pekenero* and in breadth on the north side extending to Bertam, was given for the good of this place, not only to cultivate it, but especially to settle it in order that no evil-minded or other disreputable people may have harbourage in the said land. Now as the said grantee is some time since dead; so it is that from a good mo-\n\n*Kl\u00e9bang kechil.\ntive being a place well situated, and to prevent the Manicabows our enemies or other evil-minded men from annoying us which would be the case if they were permitted to take shelter in that place: It is therefore by this that we have again appointed as Head and Superintendent of the said place Battan Tiga, Inche Aron, who at present resides in the said place, and we further permit him to cultivate the aforesaid land, on condition that in the event a future Governor, our Successor, shall judge it necessary for the service of the East India Company to make any alteration in the buildings or the plantations on the said land, he must by all means acquiesce in such measures, without expecting to receive any remuneration for the same from the East India Company, on the other side. We promise at the request of Inche Aron to recommend to the favourable consideration of the succeeding Governor, our Successor, if his conduct should deserve the favour, to place his son Samsooddeen in the next possession of the said piece of land in the event of his death or resignation of the charge, this we do in consideration of the loss of 900 Rix dollars sustained by Inche Aron, arising from the mortgage of the said land to him by his predecessor Inche Hollandia. The above land is, however, subject to all Government impositions and taxes which are at present in force or may hereafter be introduced.\n\n(Signed) G. van HOORN.\n\nMalacca, 17th June, 1700.\n\nII.\u2014GRANTS OF TOWN LOTS.\n\nJan Crans, Governor and Director of this place and of the Fortress of Malacca and its whole jurisdiction, makes known.\n\nThat I have allowed and granted with the consent of the board of Administration of this place, as I allow, grant and make over by these presents, to the master of the Smith's shop, Mr. Omstee a piece of unoccupied and uncultivated ground, belonging to the East India Company, bordering upon the trench, to the East of this Fortress, between the points Amelia and Henrietta Louisa, broad in front along the road, six rods and three feet, course N.

J. E. TENISON-WOODS, F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.\n\nLECTURE I.\n\n17th April, 1884.\n\nI have here before me two pieces of stone. One, you observe, is a rough fragment of granite of irregular shape; the other is a rounded pebble such as you may pick up any day from the gravel of a running stream. If I ask how these stones came to have their respective appearance, few would hesitate for an answer. You would say that one has been roughly broken off from a rocky mass; and the other has been rounded in the bottom of a running stream. Yet, in these opinions, simple as they are and evidently borne out by the facts of the case, you have formed by the interpretation of the geological record. You have acted upon a principle which, if followed up, must lead to the interpretation of many of the geological features upon the earth's surface. You have deciphered one of the inscriptions which nature has written on the stones, that is to say, the record of the way in which its forces have been exercised.\n\nIn this respect, there is a close resemblance between the work of an Archaeologist or Antiquary and that of a Geologist. For example, the antiquary finds a stone, covered all over with inscriptions. This, he says, must have been done by a human hand. The man who has cut this has known the use of metals as well as writing. His people had arts, and thus he draws conclusions which no one will be found to dispute, which no one can dispute, as they obviously belong to the facts of the case, however much we may question theories built upon these facts.\n\nPrecisely in a similar manner we are able to draw conclusions from the inscriptions on the stones before us. The first is rough\nand its fractured edges show that it has been detached from a more massive rock by the exercise of some force. But I shall reserve for another occasion what I have to say about this piece of stone.\n\nThe second stone is water-worn. Whatever shape it had formerly, that shape has been modified by the action of a running stream. No other natural action gives to stones the peculiar smooth and rounded shape that this stone has. It has not, however, been produced by water alone. There has been also the grinding action of friction by one stone upon another. Running streams have their gravel in constant motion. By carrying away sand and lighter particles, the large stones are constantly shifting their position and rolling over. Then a flood comes, and the stones are pushed along and pounded against one another until the edges of the fragments have abraded and rounded. This process of hammering, breaking and washing is one that is constantly going on. It is more rapid of course and constant in swift deep streams. Irregular as it would seem, modern science has found means to measure it. By the use of the water telescope and by actual experiment Mons. Daubr\u00e9e has learned much that formerly was, in this matter, mere conjecture. By means of revolving cylinders, he found that when pieces of granite are subjected to the kind of movement and friction met with in rivers, they are reduced to fine mud when they have traversed a distance of about 25 miles.\n\nOne word here about this granitic mud, which will form subsequently a subject of our enquiry. Though the change from a rough piece of granite to mere fine mud is very great, yet it is not so complete as to elude detection by the microscope. With the aid of this instrument, an expert can tell you at once that such mud has been derived from granite. He can not only tell you what kind of granite it was, but also whether it contained any metals. He can also say with certainty whether it was the action of the sea or rivers which reduced it to mud, and many other particulars which we shall find hereafter most useful in our present enquiries.\n\nIt may seem very unnecessary to spend so much time in explaining so simple a thing as the manner in which stones become water-worn. But obvious as it is, I think you will acknowledge its importance if you will bear with me a little longer. Simple also as it is, several important geological conclusions depend upon it; and in fact, like most simple things in nature, when closely observed, it serves to explain what is very complex. Thus, if you pay attention to the hills and mountains which surround the beautiful valleys near Thaipeng, you will notice features which this water-worn piece of stone will help you to explain. Our mountain\nrange has been rounded and moulded in a manner similar to all mountain ranges of its class on the earth's surface. The crest of the range rises and falls according to the projections of the rocks which are mostly bare on the summit. Weathering soon decomposes and rounds them, and the materials are swept to lower levels. From the crest buttresses descend; the drainage from which soon carves out deep valleys on the sides. On these lateral buttresses other valleys are cut down, and so on almost infinitely. The whole thing, however complex, represents one huge system of drainage. The great surface presented by the side of the range acts as an extensive condenser to the moist air from the sea. The water is ever rushing down back to the ocean, first in rivulets, then in torrents, and often, as an obstinate face of rock stops the water dashing over, in angry cascades. It is never at rest. Each day the process of wearing away goes on in thousands of rills and streams. But observe that it is not water alone which is doing the work. The sand and fragments of rock carried down by the water does the great work of scouring and cutting down the valleys, and the mountains are thus very slowly but surely worn away.\n\nAt one time in their history, probably these mountains were upheaved, but upheaval has little to do with their present form. The features which so many mountains share in common, point to some common cause for all, and this is what we call weathering, erosion or denudation. It is the effect of the friction of water and sand just as we see in the case of the water-worn pebble. So when you hold that pebble in your hand, you hold in miniature what the water is doing in the hills around you. Water is the universal solvent, and the law of gravity does the rest. Rocks are undermined and come tumbling down in landslips which fill up the valleys. Water pounces upon them here again and gives the stones no rest. They are worn away and carried to the sea, and the valley is scooped out again waiting for other supplies of material. Thus, gradually, main ridges become scarped and cut down by side valleys until they dwindle away. The materials are carried into plains which gradually build up islands and mud flats such as those which front the western side of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThose who have visited the top of the range must have remarked how the crystals of felspar stand out from the surface of the granite just like pebbles in conglomerate. They often project an inch or more. Weathering has dissolved away the rock around them. Their crystalline structure and compact form enable them to resist decomposition, and thus they remain, for a time, as a\nrecord of what water has done.\n\nIf, then, the Thaipeng Range has thus assumed its present form by the action of water, we may assume that we have no means of knowing the extent to which it has been worn away. It certainly was higher than it is, and I shall show you what reason there is for believing that it was covered by other formations. But one thing we can certainly say. It has not been recently raised from the sea. Recent marine remains are entirely absent from it. I need not tell you perhaps that the sea never leaves doubtful signs of its presence where it has once been. Its infinite treasures of life leave millions of relics behind to mark the history of its stay. Nothing of the kind is seen here. Instead, we have layers of vegetable remains to mark what has been the former land surface and how it has supported only plant life.\n\nTo find out the geological history of these hills we must interrogate the only record that remains to us, that is, the material derived from the rocks, the drifts, sands and mud banks. This at first would not seem to be a very hopeful enquiry. But more evidence will be forthcoming from it than one would think. Daubr\u00e8's experiments have shown that rocks are broken smaller and smaller by water until there comes a time when friction and abrasion have no longer any power. This is when they are reduced to fragments about one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter. Not only do they then cease to become broken, but the fragments do not readily become rounded or abraded at the edges. Such fragments are easily examined by microscopes of moderate power. By its aid the sand tells us its history. If it be from the sea, particles of lime and shell with other familiar remains soon tell its origin. If it were aerial or from a desert, every particle will be rounded, abraded and opaque. If from fresh water there will be carbonaceous matter and a peculiar sorting of the materials which I shall explain more fully.\n\nWith these facts as a guide, let us now examine the material which has come down to the plains from the mountains. Close to the hills we shall find boulders and heavy gravel. Their weight obviously prevents these materials from travelling far. Amongst the boulders some are angular, or just as they have rolled down from the hills, and some are rounded by water. Further out in the plain, we find alluvium and certain outliers of rocks which have as yet escaped denudation. These sometimes rise into detached hillocks, such as the Resident's Hill. Or they may scarcely rise above the surface at all, such as the red clays near the Thaipeng gaol. These clays are most important, and we shall consider them more\nattentively by and by. The rest of the plains are river drifts.\n\nWhen persons see only narrow streams crossing wide plains, they with difficulty understand how such rivulets could have formed such large areas of gravel, sand and earth. But the cause is quite adequate for the effects, if we remember the constant drainage from the sides of the mountains. It is unceasingly bringing down new material, which, as it accumulates, throws the stream backwards and forwards. No matter how distant certain portions of the plain may be, as soon as they become the lowest level, the water goes over to it and heaps it up.\n\nIt was the custom, long ago, to explain deposits of alluvium and gravel by theories of great inundations. But great inundations and convulsions of nature have a tendency to destroy and remove. The building up is done by the little stream which, like the busy bee, neatly spreads the materials. They may be called nature's chisels which carve and chip the stone, and nature's trowels which smooth and level everything.\n\nBear in mind again that the whole of the plains are not formed of alluvium. There were inequalities on the surface which are covered over by drift, but of unequal thickness. These, no doubt, were barriers to the waters until the drift rose up to them.\n\nBut not only does drainage level the materials. It sorts them as it carries them along. Lighter portions of granite sand, especially mica, are carried a long distance. Some metals also with light scaly ores, such as specular iron or titaniferous iron, are borne a long way. Heavy metals such as tin, gold and platinum, soon sink and remain behind.\n\nIn another lecture, I shall tell you more about granite, or the rough piece of stone with which we began this evening. But I want to say now that granite frequently contains metalliferous veins and crystals of oxide of tin scattered through it. This latter is a heavy mineral, and is never carried far from the hills. It is enclosed in granite, or at least mixed up with other rock, yet it is gradually sorted out and gathered together. The constant operations of water washes it and buries it in alluvial drift where it becomes stream tin. Vein tin, from its name, means tin ore occurring in lodes or veins, whence it has to be quarried from the solid rock. Vein tin, though in narrow lodes, goes down to great depths; stream tin is only a shallow deposit of fine ore spread over a wide surface. It is better ore and more accessible, but less permanent than vein tin.\n\nBut has all the alluvial drift of the L\u00e2rut plains been derived from granite? I think not. I referred just now to the red clays.\nThese are stratified. If you examine those which are not far from the gaol, you will perceive in them a singular ribbon-like structure. There are lines varying between red, yellow, white and dark slaty blue. In some places, traces of quartz veins may be seen. The strata are twisted and crumpled into curves and folds. Now, I regard this as a very ancient formation, and which once probably covered the granite. The latter rock has been pushed through it, and this is why we find it principally at the base and the sides of the range. Probably the granite itself has been formed from this rock. It has been melted into its present crystalline form. But the clays contain more iron than the granite does. They have been much changed by their contact with the granite, and some portions of the formation have been converted into what geologists call \"gneiss.\" I fear I cannot explain these terms to you now in the time at my disposal.\n\nThere is one thing about these clays which must strike observers, and that is their fiery red colour. This is due to per-oxide of iron or rust of iron. In these countries such a rock is called \"laterite.\" Though the term is applied to many different kinds of rock, in fact any red stone or clay. I am now referring to only one kind, which is that derived from the paleozoic or ancient formation which lies above the granite. I wish to add also that, when not affected by much oxidation or rusting, these clays are blue instead of red.\n\nThese paleozoic clays give us a clue to the age of the tin. It tells us that the metal occurs here as it does in other parts of the world, that is, in connexion with the oldest granites. These paleozoic clays are probably Ordovician, or amongst the oldest of the stratified series known to geologists. Usually such clays or slates have been much altered by the changes to which they have been subjected in their long history.\n\nFrom the great extent in which these clays appear throughout the Malayan Peninsula we may conclude they they once covered the whole of it before the granite burst through. But before this took place, the strata were much twisted and altered owing to heat, pressure and movements of the earth's crust.\n\nThere are excellent sections of this formation in the cliffs around New Harbour, Singapore, and again where the new road cuts through the hills on which Fort Palmer is built. The east side of Fort Canning also at Singapore shows an outcrop of the same rock with regular strata dipping to the westward and a surprising variety of colouring. At Tanjong Kling near Malacca the fiery red rocks, more properly termed Limonite instead of Laterite\nhave been derived from similar rocks. I call them Ordovecian, a term proposed for the Upper Cambian series, but I merely suggest this age as probable. They much resemble the Ordovecian of Australia, though the precise age cannot as yet be proved.\n\nIt is probably under these clays, at their junction with the granite, the great deposits of tin ore took place. All mining geologists are aware, that when any metal is contained in a rock, it will be most abundant at the junction of that rock with another formation. I do not undertake to explain why it is so, but I merely state the fact. The junction of two formations is the locality where metallic deposits must be looked for. The whole of the granite in the peninsula contains tin, but it is at the junction of this granite with the paleozoic clays that the richest deposits of tin ore have taken place.\n\nThus the red clays become a good indication where tin sand may be looked for. But observe: it is not at this junction that mining takes place. It is when the clay has been washed away and the tin washed out of the junction; when it has been sifted and sorted by streams of water that the stream tin has been deposited where miners get it now. Not at the base of the clays, but in the drift which has been derived from the clays and the granite together.\n\nIt may be asked, therefore, whether it would be worth while to mine through the clays where they have not been denuded and look for tin at their junction with the granite. I think it would be worth trying. I do not think the tin sand would be likely to prove so rich as in drift where it has been subjected to ages of washing and puddling from the streams. Tin sand is found upon the clays throughout Thaipeng and the neighbouring hills. I cannot even give a guess at how thick these clays are, except that I do not think they can be very thick. I repeat that it would be worth while trying whether there is what miners term a second bottom.\n\nObserve also that I do not think that the tin deposits are merely confined to the junction of the granite with the paleozoic clays. The ore may be found at the junction of the granite with any rock. On the other side of the range, we seldom see these clays, but in place of them we have limestone and marble abutting on the granite. Here also tin is found and in great richness.\n\nSo, those who go prospecting may take the presence of such formations as a favourable indication, especially where there are high ranges near so as to secure the destruction and thorough washing of the overlying rock.\n\nIf any one asks why we do not find tin in such places as Singa-\npore, where the paleozoic clays and granite are found side by side, the answer is that there are no drifts. The reason of that is that there are no high mountains near to give rise to them. Small quantities of tin have been found at the junction of the clays and granite at Singapore, sufficient perhaps to justify the conclusion that had they been subjected to the action of running water and mountain streams for ages, large deposits of stream tin would have resulted.\n\nAt the same time, I do not suppose that all the granite at its junction with some overlying formation is equally rich. Generally it is rich. There are doubtless barren granites here as elsewhere, but they seem to be fewer here than elsewhere.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact in mining for tin that stream tin ore and mineral veins or lodes of tin are seldom found together. I say seldom, because I am not so sure about the experience of Europe, but I might say never, as far as experience teaches us in Australia and in this country. The richest tin lodes in Australia (Herberton) have no stream deposits anywhere near them. I should say that the causes which made the tin segregate into lodes were more energetic than those which condensed it loosely on the edges of an overlying formation. This, however, is theory. What my experience teaches me as certain is,\u2014first, that stream tin is not derived from lodes or veins; and secondly, that lodes or veins do not decompose into anything like stream tin.\n\nNow let us, in conclusion, examine the sections presented by the tin mines at Thaipeng, and see how far these will bear out those inferences. First of all, we meet with loamy clay or black vegetable mould, full of roots, branches, stumps of large trees in the positions in which they grew, besides prostrate stems of trees. Half of this black deposit is water, and half the remainder is vegetable matter that will burn. Underneath are layers of white, red and yellow sands, mixed with coarse layers of quartz and felspar. There are also occasional deposits of red clay.\n\nBy the aid of the microscope we find that the sand is derived from granite and deposited in fresh water. If you examine it closely, you will see that the grains are all angular and transparent. When the polariscope is applied to them, we find a magnificent play of colours. By the same instrument we are enabled to distinguish a few fragments of felspar and fewer still of mica. A little experience enables one to pronounce at once that this sand has come from granite. If it had been derived from a volcanic rock, the quartz would be glassy and not give the play of colours that we observe here.\nThe red clays, and probably the yellow clays, are derived from the paleozoic strata. The white clays may be decomposed felspar from which the sand is washed out. All this careful sorting and sifting has been effected by the force of gravity aided by the never failing streams of water from the hills.\n\nOccasionally, vegetable soil is again repeated, showing that there were different surfaces of dry land at different levels and at various times in the geological history of these deposits.\n\nThen appear more or less worn fragments of quartz, felspar, fluorspar, and granite. This may be called a gravel, but its material is sometimes a stratum of mere pebbles, or sometimes consisting of large boulders. These represent various vicissitudes in the history of the stream. When such water-worn stones are cemented together, the rock is called a conglomerate.\n\nUnderneath all these deposits, at a depth of 20 or 30 feet, we find the stream tin. It is usually in a gravel with much fine clay and coarse sand, which gives the stratum a grey speckled appearance. The depth of the tin stratum is variable, but seldom more than four feet, and often, in even rich mines, much less. The tin rests upon white or blue clay either paleozoic or derived from the granite.\n\nNow, when we find the tin sand all in one place and in the lowest stratum, we must conclude that it came there by the force of gravity, or that the upper part of the rocks from which the tin was derived was richer in tin than that which subsequently supplied the materials for the drift. Both these conclusions, I think, are partly true.\n\nThe drift overlying the tin may, in some case, have been removed and replaced many times by the running waters as they shifted their beds. Streams undermine their banks, they fall in, and are thus turned over, washed and re-washed and the heavier particles of tin soon become a stationary stratum in the lowest part. This is the history of a good deal of the tin deposits, but not of all. According to what has been already said, some portions of the materials for the drift were richer in tin than others, that is, the junction of the paleozoic clays with the granite rock. When these rocks were subjected to erosion, tin sand accumulated in much larger quantities.\n\nIf this explanation be correct, then we ought to find tin sand at different levels in different mines, and, as a matter of fact, we do. But in one group of mines there is generally a correspondence in the level of the tin in all parts of the field. Thus in Thaipeng it occupies nearly the lowest levels, from which we may infer that a\ngood deal of barren rock has been denuded since the rich beds at\nthe junction of the granite and clay have been washed away.\n\nTo some extent, tin sand may have gravitated through the\nloose watery sands even after they were deposited in beds. This\nactually occurs in thin strata of washed sand which is thrown out\nof the sluices. What little tin ore remains in this sand is found\nto have settled down to the bottom. But, of course, this could not\nhappen through coarse gravel or compact clay.\n\nAt the risk of being tedious, I must repeat the important les-\nson to be learned from these facts. The way in which tin sand is\nfound in rich deposits in certain parts only of the drift, shows that\nit has been the wearing away of some restricted portion of the\nrocks. This is at the junction of a formation overlying the granite.\nWherever, therefore, either from the out-crop of the rocks or the\nnature of the drift such a junction appears evident, deposits of\ntin may be looked for. Red clays are to be regarded as a special-\nly favourable indication, and so are out-crops of slate, schist or\nlimestone near granite. But an essential condition appears to be\nthat there should be high granite hills near, in order to secure the\nrequisite drainage for the formation of drift.\n\nI have mentioned how hollows in the ground affect the deposi-\ntion of tin. There are a good many depressions of the kind about\nthese mines, though the surface is even. The ground, as the miners\nsay, rises up, and the ore is almost absent from the slopes, while it\nis unusually rich in the hollows, those nearest the hills being the\nrichest.\n\nIt may be asked whether tin sand might be looked for at any\ngreat distance from the hills. To this a double answer may be\ngiven. The first is that tin sand usually does not travel far, even\nwhen it is very fine. A mile from its origin would be a long\ndistance.\n\nBut, secondly, tin may be looked for far out in the plains, be-\ncause it is certain that both paleozoic clays or granite in the form\nof outlying hillocks have existed there, though now they are was-\nhed away. In this case, the nature of the soil would be the best\nindication.\n\nThe manner in which the paleozoic clays are stratified, and how\nthe strata are turned and twisted and crossed by white veins, has\nsuggested to the author of \"Tin Mines in L\u00e2rut\" that there were\nfearful convulsions of nature going on when the stream tin was\ndeposited. But the cause of this dates much farther back. It\ndates to the period when the paleozoic were affected by the gra-\nnite, and crumpled or folded back by that rock.\nI have gone through most of the points connected with the geology of stream tin, especially as it refers to the State of Perak. You will doubtless be inclined to ask a question which I have not touched upon at all. This is, how the occurrence of tin ore in such quantities in clays or in granite is accounted for. This must form the subject of another lecture, for the story is a long one. It cannot be accounted for in as satisfactory a manner as the occurrence of tin in drift, but the matter is of the highest interest, as you will find, connected with the most attractive field of geological research.\n\nLet me say, in conclusion, that the connexion of stream tin with paleozoic rocks, limestone and granite is a most cheering part for the future mining prospect of this State. Such rocks are to be found everywhere; the valleys of the rivers are full of them. This makes me think that the tin deposits of the Malay Peninsula are the richest in the world, and that we are as yet only on the threshold of our discoveries.\nLECTURE II.\n\n21st April, 1884.\n\nOur enquiry in this lecture will be as to the way in which we can account for the rich deposits of tin ore in connexion with granite rocks.\n\nYou will remember how, in the first lecture, we began with the study of two pieces of stone, one of which was water-worn and the other a rough fragment of granite. The water-worn stone furnished us with a clue to the erosions of mountains and the formation of drift. We shall now turn to the rough stone to sift the question of its constituent parts, and we will begin our enquiry by asking\u2014What is granite?\n\nBroadly defined, it is a compound rock consisting of quartz, felspar and mica. Quartz is a very hard glassy mineral consisting of the oxide of the element silicon. Felspar is a trifle less hard and more complex. It consists of, say roughly, 60 or 70 per cent. of quartz, a large percentage of alumina, and the rest made up of soda or potash, and a very little iron, lime and magnesia. Mica is a shiny glistening mineral, generally coloured yellow, blackish or transparent. It splits into thin flakes, and looks golden or silvery in small specks. Mica is a compound mineral and contains, besides other minerals, notably lithia, silica, alumina and an alkali usually potash and magnesia, the silica being in smaller proportion than in felspar.\n\nNow, observe that I am dealing with these things in the most general sort of way. There are not only many different kinds of granite but many different kinds of felspar. Granite also contains other different minerals besides those which I have mentioned, but exceptionally and in relatively small quantities. For my present purpose, however, my definitions as above are sufficient.\n\nObserve other differences in this stone. It is not stratified. There are no lines nor marks such as it would have if it were a rock slowly deposited by water. It is a mass of crystals. Now, how did it get this form and how comes it that such a uniform appearance is presented by granites all over the world? It is no matter where you are\u2014in Aberdeen, in Egypt, in Malacca, or Perak\u2014granite is granite everywhere, and every one who has eyes can recognize it.\n\nVarious theories have been proposed to account for this. I cannot describe them all, but I will take the most natural and the most common idea. That is, that the stone has been melted by fire. The earth's surface, so it is said, is pretty uniform in materials, and\nwhen it is melted and cooled, or slowly cooled if you will, becomes granite.\n\nBut against this theory we know many instances of the melting of the earth's surface by heat, and when cooled it becomes something very different from granite. Volcanoes emit from their craters the melted materials of the crust of the earth, but lava is not at all like granite, and even where it has cooled slowly it is still very different.\n\nHeat alone, then, will not suffice as a theory. A simple reflection will make us realize this better. Granite is in structure not unlike a piece of loaf sugar. But in the case of the sugar the structure is not due to mere heat, as I need not tell you. If you take the sugar and melt it over a fire, what a different material it becomes, and so it is with granite. If it be melted, which it requires an enormous heat to effect, the result, when cooled, is a mere slag.\n\nBesides, if granite be closely examined, a curious feature in the crystals will be noticed. The mica and the felspar have both left the forms of their crystals imbedded on the quartz. But the quartz cools at a much higher temperature than the mica or felspar. If heat alone had been in operation, the quartz should have cooled first and left its crystals to modify the other two minerals.\n\nBut for all that, geological research proved beyond a doubt that, melted or softened in some sort of way, granite had formerly been. At its junction with stratified rocks it was frequently found to throw out veins into fissures, and to be injected, so to speak, as a molten material could only be expected to do. Granite dykes or elvans are not uncommon, and these sometimes in granite itself showing that the encasing material of which the walls of the dyke are formed had cooled or solidified to some extent before the latter was injected. When granite is found in contact with stratified rocks, the latter are usually much changed, and as if the crystalline rock had affected them by its heat. When this is not the case, it can generally be proved that there has been considerable displacement and upheaval since the granite was melted. The tilted stratified rocks which lie against it came to their present position in a later period in the geological history of both formations. Sometimes gradual transition from stratified rock to granite may be observed, so that it is difficult to say where one begins and the other ends, and even where the unaltered slates which lie near granite are submitted to microscopic examination. Occasionally in granite itself marks of former stratification can be made out. Blocks of evidently stratified rock are found imbedded\nin granite paste. But the most extraordinary thing of all is that fossils have been found in granite, much changed, of course, and crystalline, but perfectly recognizable. The Jura Belemnites in the Alps may be cited as an example, and I think I have met with paleozoic fossils in a granitic rock in Australia.\n\nAll this was very puzzling and gave rise to many theories. The facts seemed to hold the balance equally between a stratified rock on the one hand, and a kind of volcanic, or at any rate, an eruptive rock on the other. Then the theory of metamorphism began to make its way. This suggested the granite had originally been a stratified rock, and that it had been converted into its present form by the agency of heat.\n\nThis, you observe, only removed the difficulty one step further back. The question was still unsolved as to what kind of heat it was. Gradually the microscope was brought to bear upon the matter, and this, with chemical aids, brought what is now believed to be a full and satisfactory explanation.\n\nIf you subject a small rough fragment of granite to microscopic examination, you will not learn much. But if you grind down thin polished slices until they become quite transparent, you will be able to subject them to very high magnifying powers. Then you will see that the apparently solid crystals are full of minute cavities. Some of these are partly filled with water, others with gas, others again are cavities containing perfect crystals of such minerals as common salt, and other salts of magnesia, soda, &c. These crystals sometimes appear in fluid, which may be water, and they are in constant movement.\n\nIt would be an error, however, to suppose that these appearances are only found in granite crystals. They are seen, though not exactly in the same manner, in volcanic rocks, in meteoric stones and even in the slags of furnaces. But microscopic examination has shown immense differences between granites and those which have been certainly subjected to heat within reach of the earth's atmosphere.\n\nI cannot, in the limits of such a lecture as this, go into the details of this subject, but it will be sufficient to say that the progress of science, largely aided by the microscopic investigation of rocks, has shown us a most probable and sufficient cause for the metamorphism of granites. All the different effects of heat are found to vary according to the pressure at which they have been exercised.\n\nIt will save a great deal of explanation if I enter at once into the consideration of what must have been the geological his-\ntory of the granites. First of all they are generally very old rocks. I say generally, because though most granites are paleozoic, there are mesozoic or secondary and cainozoic or tertiary granites as well. But the rock we have to deal with here is paleozoic, and I will consider that as affording the simplest case for consideration.\n\nNow, we have evidence in this country that the granite here has been covered by two more formations at least. These were of considerable thickness. Fifteen hundred feet of limestone is exposed in places, and even then it has been greatly denuded or worn away. The paleozoic clays belong to a formation which is known everywhere on the earth's surface to be very thick. The history of the geological changes in the earth's crust justifies the inference that between these two formations and the comparatively recent date of their uncovering and denudation, many other formations must have succeeded and disappeared. So that, without any stretch of imagination, you can perceive that our granite was at one time covered by an enormous weight of overlying rocks. The pressure thus effected I do not attempt to estimate. It defies calculation. Millions of tons weight would result from a hundred feet or so of rock, so what of thousands of feet!\n\nNow, pressure engenders heat. If we cannot estimate the weight, we may say, that at the most moderate computation, the heat engendered by pressure would have been sufficient to liquify the rocks. But the pressure would prevent liquefaction. The nature of the overlying rocks would also prevent much of the heat being lost by radiation.\n\nLet us turn for a moment, before we consider the effects of this heat, to take into account the material with which it has to deal. Before these granites were covered over, they were stratified. We can see this in many places where the marks of stratification have not been obliterated. There was a time, then, when these strata were laid down line by line horizontally by the river or the sea or the aerial current from which they were deposited. They then consisted of sand, which means silica, of mud or clay, which means alumina, magnesia, lime, soda, potash and a little oxide of iron. Fluorine and carbons, tin, gold or silver were also present infinitesimally. How they came to be present, I shall explain hereafter.\n\nBut there was one very important ingredient which we must not leave out, and that was water. All rocks contain this in a certain proportion. I do not mean those stores which come out as springs upon the surface, but water mingled with the ingredients of the rocks, that is, chemically combined. Gases of course there were,\nalso chemically combined, and also water in its simple form, mixed or soaked in we may say, and from which no compound rock is ever free.\n\nNow, consider the effect of heat caused by pressure on these materials aided by the presence of water. The latter material, you know, at the surface of the earth cannot be heated much above 212\u00b0 degrees of Fahrenheit. Then it evaporates in the form of steam. But under great pressure, of course it cannot evaporate. It may be then heated to any extent that the pressure will bear. Water, even cold water, is a solvent of rocks to a far greater extent than you would imagine, not only by wearing them away, but by really dissolving the stone. But at very high temperatures water acts on rocks such as quartz more powerfully than the strongest acid does upon iron at the earth's surface. Let us take dull red heat, for instance, and I will tell you presently why I choose that degree of heat. At this temperature, quartz would be readily dissolved by superheated water, while I need not tell you that it requires a considerably higher temperature to melt it in the air.\n\nThese conclusions are not the result of mere theory. Experiments have proved them. By means of carefully secured vessels, water has been raised to a red heat and even higher, and its action upon quartz, glass and many other substances observed. If I do not mistake, after an experiment which lasted some 18 months, some of the minerals of granite and something very like granite have been reproduced by Mons. Daubr\u00e8.\n\nThis pressure, or the weight of the superincumbent rock, is quite sufficient to account for the change of stratified rock into granite. Pressure has generated heat, heat has brought into action the highly corrosive and solvent action of water, chemical action has been set up, those elements that have the greatest affinity for each other have united, acids have neutralised alkalies, gases have been liberated and made new combinations, and finally minerals have segregated, and the result is the rocks in the form in which we see them now.\n\nBe it remembered that though we class the rocks of this Range under one category, which we distinguish as granite, the rock is very varied in its constitution. It is fine grained, and coarse, blue and red, dark coloured and light. Some of it is almost all quartz and some foliated like a schist. Mica predominates in one place, and there are thick veins of felspar in another. All this is just what we should expect. The stratified rock was not of uniform character, but even if it were, the pressure would prevent the reduction of the whole into a rock of simple mineralogi-\ncal features. This fact must also explain the presence of metals in one portion and not in another.\n\nSome persons might find it difficult to understand how any interchange would go on under such pressure, but it will solve the difficulty to some extent when they are reminded that interchange and chemical action goes on in the hardest and most solid rocks. Solidity is a relative term. There is nothing on the earth so hard that a movement is not going on in its particles. The moving crystals in the cavities of granite prove this. Some think that light is the stimulus in this case. It may be so. That shows how even on the hard transparent diamond movement is continually going on, movement that is not more appreciable than the waves of light, yet movement and interchange for all that.\n\nI mentioned red heat just now, and I did so because certain geologists believe that this is the temperature to which granite has been raised. This is not a guess. It is founded on the known qualities of gases and steam. Their rate of expansion under heat and pressure is calculated in connexion with the cavities in granite. Some of these, it will be remembered, are half full of water, which has been steam. The amount of condensation furnishes a factor from which the former heat is estimated.\n\nAnother kind of proof as to the origin of granite is found in the sections of extinct volcanoes. A few instances are found which enable us to see down into the innermost recesses of these subterranean fiery lagoons. In the lowest depths where pressure of the overlying lava prevented the escape of steam, the rock is granite. In fact, the volcano itself is probably no more than the escape through an accidental fissure of some of that heat which pressure is causing below.\n\nWe must not, however, leave out of consideration one important condition in these operations, and that is the length of time through which they have been exercised. We have no standard by which to measure it. The period of history occupies only a few thousand years. Supposing the granite to have been seething and baking amid steam at a red heat for that time, we can well imagine surprising results. But probably nature's laboratory has been working for cycles in which the historical period is only a unit. What are the mutations observed in these granite hills as a work for such eternal ages? The silence and obscurity in their history is one of those mysterious chasms to the edge of which science has enabled us to climb, but where we can discern only a depth which is unfathomable.\n\nBut now to account for the presence of the tin in the granite,\nor rather in the strata from which the granite is formed. I am of opinion that it has been very finely, nay almost infinitesimally, divided through the rocks just as gold and silver is in the sea at the present day. Many people are not aware that these metals exist in solution in sea-water, but in so small a quantity, that tons of water must be evaporated before any appreciable quantity can be extracted. Now, it is quite certain that the precious metal is being deposited in the rocks forming on the sea-shore or at the sea-bottom at the present day. No doubt, immense quantities of this deposit would have to be reduced before even a trace of gold would be seen, yet the quantity is absolutely if not relatively great.\n\nBut what is not possible to man's chemistry is easily effected in the great laboratory of nature. If the present shore and sea deposits were subjected to such an action as that which reduced the ranges here to granite, we should have the gold in rich veins and shoots just as it is in the quartz veins in Australia. You may be inclined to say that the gold in Australia has been much more abundant than in the case I am supposing, but this is not so. It is estimated that more than five tons of quartz or vein-stuff has been operated upon for every ounce of gold extracted, which is considerably below the truth. This, however, be it less or more, is only a mere fraction of the rock metamorphosed from which this gold has been derived.\n\nThe whole process depends upon a peculiarity in the chemistry of minerals which is only imperfectly understood. This is a tendency to what we call segregation. Similar minerals seek each other out and run together. In the heavier metals when they are melted, one can understand it, but this occurs when the rocks or metals are not melted at all, where they are not particularly heavy, and where they take directions quite independent of the force of gravity. You will find veins of quartz and veins of felspar running through stratified rocks, you find lines of flints in chalk and septarian nodules in clay. If these things take place in solid rocks, every facility occurs for their occurrence in granite. Thus, in effect, we find in granite innumerable veins of quartz, felspar, iron ores, tin from seams of considerable thickness to the merest threads. They evidently do not depend upon cracks in the stone and could not have been injected in a fluid state. They have simply segregated and come together in that strange movement of particles to which the materials of the most solid rock are subject, by means of which they evidently travel long distance.\n\nNow, turning to the tin ore, we find it in the form of an oxide. Pay attention to this. Tin is easily melted. If it had been sub-\njected to mere heat, it would have run together in the form of pure metal as it does in the smelting furnace. But under heat pressure and with water, it is forced to combine with oxygen gas, a combination which is not easily effected without those conditions. Tin when kept at a red heat with free access of air, oxidizes readily. There are two forms of oxide of tin, one in which one volume of tin combines with one volume of oxygen, this is called the protoxide or stannous oxide obtained by chemical precipitation. It is a very unstable compound, and on slight application of red heat makes it burn like tinder and become stannic oxide. There is the second combination, or peroxide of tin, in which one volume of tin is combined with two of oxygen. This is the common ore of tin.\n\nIf heat alone had been concerned in the production of the tin which is found, it would have occurred in a different way. The peculiar oxide of tin, which is so familiar to you here, is a state of the mineral which can hardly be adequately explained, unless formed slowly. Crystals of Cassiterite may have been formed by the sole action of water just as crystals of silica are so formed. But the proximity of the granite renders the conclusion more probable that the agencies of heat, pressure and superheated steam have been all in operation in the production of this oxide of tin.\n\nUsually, the form of the fragments of Cassiterite in the drifts is not crystalline. You do find many crystals, but the majority of the grains are angular and amorphous. The edges are very clean and sharp, and not often manifesting any marks of abrasion. They resemble in this respect the fragments of quartz washed out of granite which are associated with them in the drift. From this I conclude that the tin has been amalgamated in the matrix or other rock paste just as quartz, felspar and mica are.\n\nI am rather diffident in propounding a theory as to how this may have occurred. Supposing, however, tin to have been finely disseminated through the formation which went to form the granite, it may have been sublimed and then condensed on the edges of the strata where the metamorphism was not complete. Thus it is found at the junction of the granite with the stratified rock. The use of the terms subliming and condensation may be a little misleading. I only use them as generally expressing the category to which the processes may have belonged. As a matter of course, they must have been different, because the conditions were different from anything which we can reduce to experiment.\n\nI am aware how unsatisfactory any theory is which cannot be brought to some test for its verification. In this matter, however, we must rest content with explanations which are little more than\nplausible guesses. In tracing back things like the metalliferous deposits to their true causes, we are still working very much in the dark. My object in this lecture has been to point out what is really known about metamorphism and to show how it bears upon the occurrence of such ores as Cassiterite. I hope I have at least succeeded so far as to give you a clear and simple exposition of the subject, and with this, I must rest satisfied and conclude my lecture.*\n\n*NOTE.\u2014Tin is found in drifts or alluvial deposits in Perak. Many think that it must have been derived from veins and that these will yet be found. The context of these lectures will show that I do not think so. The true matrix of the tin is in granite at its junction with the clays where it has been abundantly disseminated in fine and coarse grains. Nevertheless, in northern Perak there are tin veins or true lodes. Furthermore, I wish to place on record my opinion that the stream tin deposits of Perak are practically inexhaustible.\nR\u0113mbau.\n\nAs little has been recorded on the subject of this State, except in works not very accessible, and as I have visited it officially on several occasions, I have thought that a short account of the country may not be without some interest for the readers of this Journal.\n\nThis State is one of the countries known as the \"Negri Sembilan,\" or Nine States, formerly under a Yam Tuan (in full, Yang-di-pertuan) Besar and a Yam Tuan Muda, each, however, with its own chief or Dato' Penghulu.\n\nIn R\u0113mbau, as in N\u0101ning and others of the \"Nine States,\" a considerable portion of the population are M\u0113nangkabau by descent, and M\u0113nangkabau people still come over, as they do to Malacca.\n\nIts name is said to derive from an enormous M\u0113rbau tree which used to grow in the plain near the foot of Gunong Dato'; there are said to be some traces left of it still.\n\nAnother account states that the great tree fell down from the mountain, and that the name of the country arose from the description of the noise of the fall as the colossal stem thundered down the steeps\u2014\"m\u0113rbau r\u0113mbau.\"(1)\n\nIt is further related that so vast was the size of this giant of the jungle that its head reached to the Sungei Ujong(2) stream, to which it gave its name (i.e., Sungei Ujong K\u0101yu M\u0113rbau); while its branches extended to the Moar, and it has been pretended that from\n\n---\n\n(1) Probably a case of metathesis. This is likely enough to be the origin of the name; the other accounts are, of course, later embellishments.\n\n(2) This is the recognised official spelling, or I should spell it \"Hajong\" in accordance with the proper Malay spelling, though Malays have begun to drop the \"h\" in this word, as in other similar ones, but I see no reason to drop it because it is mute. Many Malays still sound the \"h\" in \"hitam\" and \"hayam,\" though the latter is more commonly sounded now without it.\nthis circumstance \"Merbau Saratus,\"(1) one of the limits of fishing rights on the Moar, took its name.\n\nRembau, like the rest of these countries, was, according to Mentra traditions, at first inhabited by the aboriginal tribes alone, and its first Penghulu was, like that of Nanning, appointed by the Dato' Kelana Petr\u00e2 of Sungei Ujong.(2)\n\nAnother local version is that Rembau was first settled by Batin Bendaara Sakudei at Hulu Rembau near Gunong Dato', and he it was who felled the mighty Merbau tree. According to native authority quoted by Newbold, Bendaara Sakudei was the first chief of Sungei Ujong upon whom the title Kelana Petr\u00e2 was conferred, and was the son of a Batin,(3) and the following account of this origin was related to Newbold by the Raja di Raja of Sungei Ujong:\n\n\"In ancient times one of the princesses(4) of Sungei Ujong having had the presumption to laugh at the naked state of a Batin of the Jakuns, incurred his resentment, and was compelled irresistibly to follow him through thicket and brake, until, moved with compassion, her 'sans-culotte ma\u00eetre de danse' broke the spell and married her. The offspring of this sylvan union is said to be Sakudei,(5) from whom descend the Penghulus of Sungei Ujong.\"\n\n\"Peduanda\" is the name of one of the chief aboriginal tribes in the South of the Peninsula, and two of the chief Rembau tribes bear the same name\u2014the Peduanda Jawa, and the Peduanda Jakun\u2014from which the Penghulu is alternately elected.\n\nThis alternate election is said to be due to a dispute in days\n\n---\n\n(1) The real origin of this name was probably that it was a very large tree, said to have 100 branches: cf. \"tengas tujoh\" further down the Moar, which has seven stems branching from one root.\n\n(2) cf. infra with approval of Johor.\n\n(3) cf. infra.\n\n(4) The tradition, if the word \"princess\" is to be taken literally, is somewhat mixed (a not uncommon occurrence) about this, for there was no princely race in Sungei Ujong at the time; but it is a common practice to confer this title on women remarkable for beauty and fairness of complexion, and it may mean no more.\n\n(5) cf. with Rembau tradition infra, which makes him come from Johor.\ngone by between the two branches of the B\u00ebduanda, each claiming\nthe right to elect the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, which was settled by the sovereign\nof Johor giving each the right alternately.\n\nHe at the same time gave distinctive titles to the P\u00ebngh\u00fblus\u2014to Titles.\nthe one elected from the \"B\u00ebduanda J\u00e2wa\" that of \"S\u00ebdia R\u00e2ja,\"\nto him of the \"B\u00ebduanda Jakun\" that of \"L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja.\"\n\nThe office is hereditary, descending on the side of the sister, as in\nN\u00e2uing and in all the M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau States. I attach a table shewing\nthe constitution of the country, and giving an approximate estimate\nof the numbers of each tribe.\n\nIt will be noticed that the population is mixed.\n\nThe Siamese probably date from the time of the invasions by their\nancestors recorded in the \"S\u00ebj\u00e2rah,\" and which, if we may believe\nthat work, took place shortly before the Portuguese took Malacca.\n\nAcheh and Malacca were at one time intimately connected, the\nlatter, at first the superior, having subsequently become feudatory\nto the former.\n\nThe boundaries of R\u00ebmbau with Malacea territory were defined Boundaries.\nby the Treaty of the 9th January, 1883, and were fixed as follows:\u2014\nKw\u00e2la Sungei J\u00ebrn\u00ebh,(1) Bukit B\u00ebrtam,(2) Bukit J\u00ebl\u00f4tong,(3) Bukit\nP\u00e2tus,(4) Jirat Gunjei,(5) L\u00fbbok T\u00e2lan,(6) D\u00fbsun F\u00ebringgi(7)\nD\u00fbsun K\u00ebpar,(8) \u00dclu Sungga, Bukit P\u00e2tus.\n\n(1) \"J\u00ebrn\u00ebh,\" clear.\n(2) \"B\u00ebrtam\" a palm-like reed, of which the leaves are used for thatch,\nand the stem split for walling houses.\n(3) \"J\u00ebl\u00f4tong,\" a fine g\u00ebtah-bearing tree. The g\u00ebtah is mixed with other\nmarketable g\u00ebtah.\n(4) \"Bukit P\u00e2tus,\" cleft hill, a very common name all over the country.\n(5) \"Jirat,\" a grave; \"gunjei,\" a giant. This giant is said to have been so tall\nthat he could pluck the cocoanuts as he walked along; he is said to have been\nkilled at Pakung Ch\u00e2char (the plain of the ch\u00e2char trees) by introducing a spear\nhead into a bambu in which water was given him to drink so that when he\ntipped it up to drink he swallowed the spear-head, on which he died, and was\nbrought down by being cut in the leg; he fell and was buried where he fell, the\nheap over this marks the boundary point, where a pillar is now erected.\nThere is another Jirat Gunjei in Tampin, said to be that of a female Gunjei.\n(6) \"L\u00fbbok,\" pool in a river; \"t\u00e2lan,\" a tree (in other parts of the coun-\ntry called \"g\u00e2pis\").\n(7) \"F\u00ebringgi\" Portuguese; \"d\u00fbsun\" orchard.\n(8) \"K\u00ebpar,\" a very peculiar stumpy kind of palm.\nThe Rembau branch of the Linggi from Sempang upwards forms the rest of the boundary line.\n\nThe boundary with Sungei Ujong was fixed about two years ago by His Excellency Sir F. A. Weld, as, previous to that time, there had been disputes about it. It now runs as follows:\u2014from Sempang to Bukit Mandi Angin, thence to Perhentian Tinggi, and thence to Gunong Angsi. The boundary on the inland side towards Sri Menanti, Inas or Jolei, and Johol has shifted from time to time. Gunong Pasir, which is now under Sri Menanti, is claimed as properly belonging to Rembau, though in Newbold's time it was said to have originally belonged to Johol, and this last is confirmed by the aborigines, who are the best authorities. The boundaries with Sri Menanti are said to be Gunong Tujoh, and Gunong Lipat Kajang.\n\nThose with Johol, Batu Gajah (on hill of that name), Gunong Dato', Perhentian Lantei (or Tinggi) on Bukit Ulu Api-Api, and (including Tampin) Batu Berapit (now claimed to be in Tampin, Perhentian Manggis being said to be the right point, on Bukit Kuda Mati), Joram Kambing and Bukit Putus.\n\nChief places. Sempang, where the Rembau and Penar join to form the Linggi, and where we have now a Police Station on a small piece of land ceded to Government in 1874, was formerly one of the chief places in Rembau; Kwala Padas, a few miles further up on the right bank, was another, but they have both been abandoned. At Bandar Rasau was the residence of the Yam Tuan Muda, and latterly of the late Penghulu Haji Sail. In Newbold's time the Penghulu lived at Chembong. The present Penghulu resides at Gomayun near Chengkau, where Haji Sail had another residence. Rembau, in proportion to its size, is, no doubt, the most populous of these native States, being probably about 11,000, exclusive of Tampin, Kru and Tebong; the details will be found in the table shewing the constitution of the country: in Newbold (1839) it is given at 9,000 including Tampin and Kru. The most populous part of the country is said to be inland at Sri Lemak and Ulu Sepri, but this is not confirmed by the numbers I have obtained. From the table first alluded to, it will be seen of what a mixed character the population\nThey likewise bear, among the Malays, the character of being pre-eminently treacherous. The G\u00e1dong district (lying between our frontier and Gunong Dato') near which Haji Mastafa lives, is said to be the harbour of robbers and cattle-lifters, but Haji Mastafa is too far advanced in years, too imbecile, and too much in the hands of others to do anything to improve matters; but under the new r\u00e9gime we may in time look for amendment.\n\nAs Rembau used to be the place of installation of the Yam Tuan or Yang-di-pertuan Besar, it will not be out of place to deal here with the subject of the Yam Tuans. The original States in the interior of this part of the Peninsula, according to tradition, before they became \"Negri Sembilan\" were Kelang, Jel\u00e9bu, Sungei Ujong and Johol, with seniority in the order given.\n\nThe \"Negri Sembilan\" are stated by Newbold, and probably correctly, as being originally as follows, Kelang, Jel\u00e9bu, Sungei Ujong, Johol, Segamat, N\u00e2ning, Rembau, Hulu Pahang (including Seriting and Jempol) and Jelei (in Pahang, adjoining Jel\u00e9bu). (1) Kelang soon fell under the domination of Sel\u00e2ngor.\n\nJohol originally included Jempol and the whole watershed of the Moar as far as the Palong on one side and Mount Ophir on the other, having on the N. & W. common boundaries with Jel\u00e9bu, Sungei Ujong, Rembau and N\u00e2ning (the latter now included in Malacca).\n\nSegamat seems to have been absorbed by Johor a generation or two since. N\u00e2ning and Rembau were children of Sungei Ujong, and when the former of them came more directly under Dutch influence, Sri Menanti, or more correctly Hulu Moar, which had asserted independence of Johol, took its place in the confederation.\n\nAbout the middle of last century, the Dutch, in conjunction with the sovereign of Johor, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah, who was suzerain\n\n(1) There is of course another Jelei also known as Inas, which, till a generation or two ago, formed part of Johol, nor is it clear that it is entirely separate now; this district could not have been one of the original \"Negri Sembilan\"; the title of its chief is the same as that of the Johol Dato', while that of the Jelei in the text was Maharaja Perba. No doubt with the decadence of the Johor dynasty, and the practical independence of Pahang, Jelei ceased to be regarded as anything but a dependency of the Bendihaara.\nof the Nine States, appointed Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja, a Bugis Prince, as their chief.\n\nHis rule, however, was not approved of, and the Pengh\u00fblus of Sungei \u00dajong, Johol, R\u00ebmbau and H\u00fblu Moar invited, with the assistance of the Dutch and the consent of Johor, the Princes of the M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau dynasty to come over as their chiefs. Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja, however, found support with some of the Pengh\u00fblus, and for a time hostilities ensued between the rival parties, but in the end R\u00e2ja M\u00ebl\u00e2war, the M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau Prince, prevailed, and Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja withdrew to R\u00eeau, where he died in 1773. Thenceforward Johor, by common consent, had nothing more to do with the N\u00e9gri S\u00ebmbilan.\n\nR\u00e2ja M\u00ebl\u00e2war was then duly installed as Yang-di-p\u00ebrt\u00fban B\u00ebsar by the four Pengh\u00fblus of Sungei \u00dajong, Johol, R\u00ebmbau and H\u00fblu Moar (who were styled the Pengh\u00fblu B\u00eblantik from their office of installing the suzerainty in R\u00ebmbau, which was thenceforth called \"T\u00e2nah K\u00ebrjaan,\" i.e., the place where the business of installation is performed, not \"kar\u00e2ja-an,\" so it is said.)  \n\nThence the suzerain proceeded to Sri M\u00ebnanti, his place of residence, so named from the chief and B\u00e2tins there waiting to receive him in state, and it was called \"T\u00e2nah M\u00ebngandong.\"\n\nThe b\u00e2leis erected for the suzerain on his visits to the different States were constructed of peculiar form, which must not be altered. That in Sungei \u00dajong was called \"B\u00e2lei M\u00eblintang\" according to the best account, figuratively speaking from its Pengh\u00fblu being in a position to oppose any innovations attempted by the Yam T\u00fban; that in Johol \"B\u00e2lei B\u00ebrtingkat\" in the same way, being as it were, a third story on Sungei \u00dajong and R\u00ebmbau, and being next door to Sri M\u00ebnanti, would bring their representations right up to the Astana.\n\n(1) I am disposed to think it was \"kar\u00e2ja-an\" originally.\n(2) \"Kandong;\" to be with child, in that sense to carry, to support, so this place bore or supported the Yam T\u00e2an B\u00ebsar.\n(3) Not, I am informed, as NEWBOLD states, because it was built at right angles to the river. The allegorical explanation given in the text is more in accordance with Malay ideas.\nThe real power in these States is vested with the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, that of the suzerain being nominal only. Newbold, from whose writings I have taken much of the account here given, states that, on the elevation of R\u00e2ja M\u00e9l\u00e2war to the office of Yang-di-p\u00ebrt\u00fban, the following arrangement was agreed to between him and the P\u00ebngh\u00fblus: that he should assemble them on affairs of State and submit to a majority; that his maintenance be furnished equally by the inhabitants of the four States, each house contributing annually a gan-tang of padi, two cocoa-nuts and one suku (i.e., 13\u00bd cts.).\n\nOn the occasion of a death, marriage, or circumcision in the Royal Family, each P\u00ebngh\u00fblu was to send three buffaloes and to furnish a certain sum for distribution (probably for the benefit of the various officers who took part in the ceremonies).\n\nIn the case of a war also, the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu was expected to come forward with a certain contribution of men, arms, ammunition, and provisions.\n\nThe P\u00ebngh\u00fblu derived his revenue from his power of inflicting fines, and from contributions in kind made by the people of his State; he was said, too, to have the power, in other Malay countries reserved to the sovereign, of enforcing gratuitous labour, but I doubt if the power has been exercised, except to a very limited extent.(1) The respective positions of Yang-di-p\u00ebrt\u00fban and P\u00ebng-h\u00fblu are also defined by the following verbal M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau traditions:\n\nUndang-undang of the N\u00ebgri S\u00ebmbilan.(2)\n\n\u00c1lam nen b\u00e9r\u00e2ja, l\u00fah\u00fbk nen berp\u00ebngh\u00fblu, s\u00ebku b\u00ebrt\u00e1ha, anak b\u00fbah beribu b\u00e2pa.\n\nThe kingdom is under the R\u00e2ja, the district under the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, the suku under the elder, and the members of the s\u00ebku\n\n---\n\n(1) Such as helping in padi-planting and repairing the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu\u2019s house and fence.\n\n(2) i.e., of the \u201cP\u00ebrp\u00e2tih (or perhaps more properly \u201cP\u00e2ti\u201d Pihang) Sab\u00e2tang, opposed to which is the \u201c\u00e2dat t\u00f4m\u00ebnggongan.\u201d I may refer to this in greater detail on a future occasion.\nunder the *ibu bapa*, (lit., father and mother) title of subordinate elder.\n\n*Sabingkah tanah terbalik, sa halei \u00e9rat k\u00e2yu gang p\u00e9tus undang yang punya.*\n\nEvery clod of earth upturned, every slip of root snapped, is the Penghulu's.\n\n*Deri halu \u00e1yer m\u00e4nycncheng sampei kahilir ombak n\u00e9m\u00e9rchah, To' Bandar yang punya.*\n\nFrom the trickling source of the stream to the mouth when the waves break is the To' Bandar's.\n\n*Di pijak tanah, di langkah akar undang yang punya.*\n\nAll the soil and roots under foot belong to the Penghula.\n\n*Di sauk \u00e1yer, di p\u00e1tah ranting sa champak gilah di t\u00e9pi t\u00e9bing To' Bandar yang punya.*\n\nAll water taken, or boughs broken within reach of a punting-pole from the banks, belong to the To' Bandar.\n\n*Adat itu di anjak(1) l\u00e9gu, di \u00e1lih m\u00e1ti.*\n\nNeglect of these customs will bring decay on the country, and if they are changed, destruction will result.\n\n*Adapun R\u00e1ja itu ti\u00e1da mampungai n\u00e9gri dan ti\u00e1da b\u00e9leh mench\u00e9kei kharajat, m\u00e9lainkan b\u00e9rika\u00e9dilan sahaja s\u00ebrta p\u00e9rm\u00e1kananya duti sasiku, b\u00e9ras dua gantang, nior sat\u00e1li.*\n\nNow the R\u00e1ja does not own the country, nor can he levy taxes on its produce, but with him lies the final award of justice only, and he obtains a maintenance of a \"s\u00faku\" (12 cents), two gantangs (gallons) of rice and a string of (*i.e.*, 2) coconuts.

He was called in by the Rembau people to help in the conduct of hostilities against Yam T\u016ban M\u016bda R\u0101ja Asil, and his son R\u0101ja Haji, who had given offence by a marriage that was considered unlawful.\n\n(From M\u0113nangk\u0101bau.)

And on the decease of a L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja P\u00ebngh\u00fblu the Dato\u2019 M\u00ebrah Bangsa discharges similar functions.\n\nThe four L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga in the low country are held senior to the four inland, and when one of the former dies, his insignia are half those displayed on the death of a P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, while those of an inland\nchief are slightly less; money, for instance, is not scattered on the way, nor are cloths spread on the path. The story of the origin of Dato' Gempa, Dato' Perba, and Dato' Patih is as follows: There was a chief named Dato'(1) Bendahara Sakudei(2) (his wife was a Jakun, daughter of Batin Saribu Jaya, she was called Princess Long-hair), who came from Johor with his followers to open Rembau. After him came a man from Menangkabau named Dato' Leteh, and he and his party became trusted to the Dato' Bendahara, and supported the people from Johor: they all settled at a place called Kebun Lada (Pepper Garden). After a time Bendahara Sakudei had three children (female) the eldest named Dato' Bungkal, the next Dato' Mudek, and the youngest Dato' Mengkudu. Later on he removed to Sungei Ujong, but he left his eldest child Dato' Bungkal in Rembau with Dato' Leteh. Dato' Leteh belonged to the Mandiling branch of the Batu Hampar Suku, and at the time all those of the Batu Hampar Suku who came over from Menangkabau to Rembau put themselves under him.\n\nThere were five branches of the Batu Hampar Suku from Menangkabau who adhered to Dato' Leteh, viz., the Mandiling, the Chendiaga, the Paya Bidara, the Pagar Chinchang, and the Agam.\n\nIn course of time Dato' Leteh looked round for a suitable husband for the daughter of the Bendahara, and while he was considering the matter, there came a Menangkabau man of the Chendiaga branch of the Batu Hampar Suku named Dato' Leela Balang, to ask for Dato' Bungkal as a wife; all the family were agreed to it, and they were married.\n\nIn due course Dato' Leela Balang became father of a son, whom he named Leela Maharaja.\n\nWhen he was about six years old, and the country had become populous, Dato' Leteh consulted with Dato' Leela Balang, and suggested that it would be advisable for the latter to go to Johor and make over the country, for it belonged to the Dato' Bendahara\n\n---\n\n(1) The account quoted supra calls him a Batin, which would imply that he was himself a Jakun. The title of Bendahara is now in use amongst the Jakuns.\n\n(2) Probably because he came from the river of that name in Johor.\n(Sak\u00fbdei), the two Dato' thought that no one else could rule the country but L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja, for he was the grandson of the Dato' B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra.\n\nThen Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang went with Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam who was a M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau man with a Javanese wife, to Johor and there the son of Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang was appointed P\u00ebngh\u00fblu L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja, but while he was in his minority Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang undertook the duties, and was given the title of Dato' G\u00ebmpa Mahar\u00e2ja.\n\nThen came Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam complaining to Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang that he had obtained the P\u00ebngh\u00fbluship for his son and the administration of it for himself with a titie, while he, Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam had got nothing for his trouble (the journey to Johor?). Then Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang returned to the presence the same day and represented the state of matters. The R\u00e2ja asked whether Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam had any daughters, and finding he had, decided that when he grew up L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja should marry Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam's daughter, and if he got a child, that child should be P\u00ebngh\u00fblu S\u00ebd\u00efa R\u00e2ja, whose duties should be undertaken by Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam, and Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam had the title of Dato' M\u00ebrah Bangsa conferred on him. They then returned to R\u00ebmbau. (1)\n\nIt was subsequently decided, in consultation with Dato' L\u00ebteh, that all the Ch\u00ebni\u00e2ga branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar S\u00fbku should be handed over to the charge of the Dato' G\u00ebmpa Mahar\u00e2ja, i.e., Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang. The other four branches of the s\u00fbku remained under Dato' L\u00ebteh, who was Dato' P\u00fbtih, and have so continued to this day.\n\nThe descendants of Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam became the \"waris\" of the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu S\u00ebd\u00efa R\u00e2ja, because of the mother having been Javanese, and when the \"waris\" of both P\u00ebngh\u00fblus had become numerous, an elder was put over them with the name of Dato' P\u00ebrba, who was chosen alternately from each side, being at one time Jakun and the next J\u00e2wa.\n\nDato' P\u00fbtih has always been considered to be connected with the\n\n(1) This and the other States were no doubt at the time of the taking of Malacca by the Portuguese inhabited by aborigines only. These latter assisted in the defence of Malacca with their primitive weapons.\nDato' P\u00ebrba up to the present time, because Dato' L\u00ebteh brought up Dato' Bungkal, and Dato' P\u00fbtih is descended from Dato' L\u00ebteh, and Dato' P\u00ebrba is descended from Dato' Bungkal.\n\nThe following account is given of the origin of the name \"L\u00eema S\u00fbku\" in the low country:\n\nIn the time of P\u00ebngh\u00fblu K\u00e2sir a woman of the Dato' P\u00ebrba's Origin of L\u00eema S\u00fbku people was taken to wife by a man of the Mungkar tribe in Tampin, but his people did not pay the marriage dowry. On this the Dato' P\u00ebrba and Dato' P\u00fbtih after consultation summoned their people together and went to Tampin to demand the dowry; they kept up the attack for about a fortnight, but without success; then Dato' P\u00fbtih and Dato' P\u00ebrba called to their aid Dato' Mahar\u00e2ja S\u00ebn\u00e2ra, Dato' L\u00eala Angsa, and Dato' Ganti Mahar\u00e2ja: these three agreed to help them in the affair they were engaged in, and assembled all their people and attacked Tampin, which was defeated at their first attempt; the Mungkar people admitted the dowry claim, and the matter was settled. Then the five Dato' returned to R\u00ebmbau, and there they agreed to act together always, and they had a feast and slaughtered buffaloes, and P\u00ebngh\u00fblu K\u00e2sir removed to a place called Mesjid B\u00e2tu P\u00fbtih, where there was a great assembly and the five chiefs mentioned registered an oath with the spilling(1) of blood and under the Kor\u00e2n, that they would remain five elders with one L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga, each with his own people, but of one mind, whether advantage or injury should accrue, they should share it as long as the sun and moon, which cannot change, endure. Whichever of the five chiefs should change or depart from the above solemn agreement, he would be punished by the testimony of the thirty books of the Kor\u00e2n, the Majesty of Pagar R\u00e2yong would fall upon him, and the weapon K\u00e2wi would make an end of him. This was the origin of the five s\u00fbkus, and thenceforth Dato' P\u00ebngh\u00fblu K\u00e2sir spoke of the four and five s\u00fbkus, in the low country, with respect to the \"b\u00ebrampat berl\u00eema s\u00fbku,\" and the \"b\u00ebrampat b\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan s\u00fbku\" inland. It is said that the first settling of this\n\n(1) Each party puts some of his blood into a cup, and then each dips his finger into the blood and conveys it to his mouth.\npart of the country was agreed on by three chiefs from M\u00e9nangk\u00e2bau; one Dato\u2019 Laut of P\u00e2ya Kumboh (1) selected a stream called L\u00e2yang; from him Dato\u2019 Si Mahar\u00e2ja (2) is descended; another Dato\u2019 P\u00fbtih from Sri L\u00ebmak took the stream called L\u00fbbok R\u00fbsa; from him is descended Dato\u2019 Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja;(2) another Dato\u2019 Inda P\u00ebtr\u00e2, a man of B\u00e2tu B\u00e2lang took the stream of Bintongan; he was the ancestor of Dato\u2019 And\u00efka. (3)\n\nThese three all began planting in the places named. They claimed from the sources of the streams to their junction with the main stream. While engaged in clearing, they heard the sound of many trees falling down stream within the range of their claims, on going to see the cause, they found one Dato\u2019 P\u00fbteh K\u00ebp\u00e2la a Sri M\u00e9l\u00ebnggang man of M\u00e9nangk\u00e2bau occupied in clearing. (Dato\u2019 Mand\u00eblika (2) descends from him.) The place was called B\u00e2tu Hampar. Then there was a dispute between the three chiefs and Dato\u2019 P\u00fbteh K\u00ebp\u00e2la, the former claiming from the gullies to the mouths of their streams, saying they had settled there first; the latter claimed the same, and their claims were equally strong, for they had been all recognised from Johor. Later on authority came from the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu dividing the land between them, and making the boundary from B\u00e2tu M\u00ebnunggul to Tungg\u00e2l M\u00ebrbau in the B\u00e2tu B\u00ebsar jungle, and thence to Tungg\u00e2l Ch\u00e2char, on to Kw\u00e2la \u00c6nak \u00c2y\u00ebr H\u00eetam in the S\u00ebpri stream; whoever went up the Leng stream must be under Dato\u2019 Si Mahar\u00e2ja, whoever went up the L\u00fbbok R\u00fbsa stream must be under Dato\u2019 Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja, and any one settling up the Bintongan stream must be under Dato\u2019 And\u00efka. So the T\u00eega B\u00e2tu people under Nang B\u00ebsar, who went up the Bintongan, were under the jurisdiction of Dato\u2019 And\u00efka. So likewise in the case of the S\u00ebpri, Dato\u2019 P\u00ebngh\u00fblu Uban brought two men from Johor, Dato\u2019 Chindei Lu\u00e2tan (a B\u00ebduanda, from whom descends Dato\u2019 S\u00ebtir Mahar\u00e2ja), and a M\u00e9nangk\u00e2bau man of the P\u00e2ya Bid\u00e2ra branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar, (from whom S\u00fbtan B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra is descended), and told them to settle on the S\u00ebpri. They worked\n\n(1) Name of a rush-like grass growing in swampy ground.\n(2) L\u00ebmbaga \u201cdi-d\u00e2rat.\u201d\nwith the three chiefs, Dato\u2019 Si Mahar\u00e2ja, Dato\u2019 Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja, and Dato\u2019 Andika, and they became five s\u00fbkus, and were called \u201cb\u00earampat berl\u00eema s\u00fbku\u201d being confined within the boundaries above-mentioned.\n\nFurther down stream came Dato\u2019 M\u00ebngi\u00e2ng of the Mungkar s\u00fbku from M\u00e2chap,(1) and a M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau man, i.e., Dato\u2019 Mahar\u00e2ja Inda, making three with Dato\u2019 P\u00fbtilh K\u00ebp\u00e2la, i.e., Dato\u2019 Mand\u00ebl\u00eeka, and these were called three elders and one L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga.\n\nThe origin of the appellation \u201cb\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan\u201d is that they descended from nine mothers in these three s\u00fbkus, four in the Sri M\u00ebl\u00ebnggang, three in the Mungkar, in the T\u00e0nah Datar (2) two; these worked together, together bore disgrace and shame.\n\nThe eight L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga of s\u00fbkus, four in the low country and four inland, hold the next position in the State to the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, and in all affairs of consequence he is obliged to consult them and to follow the opinion of the majority, and no treaties or agreements affecting the country generally are valid without their signature. The four Orang B\u00ebsar, though not heads of s\u00fbkus, still, from their position as \u201cwaris\u201d and consequent eligibility for the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu-ship, are able to exercise considerable influence. But subordinate chiefs of intriguing character are, of course, often found to have an influence greatly disproportioned to their official position. The Dato\u2019 P\u00ebrba, the foremost of the \u201cduablas s\u00fbku,\u201d also occupies an influential position, from his being the head of the joint s\u00fbku of B\u00ebduanda Jakun and B\u00ebduanda J\u00e2wa, from which he, like the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, is alternately elected. He is also eligible for the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu-ship. It will also be noticed that his s\u00fbku is by far the most numerous, being double any of the others.\n\nThe soil of R\u00ebmbau resembles that of N\u00e2ning generally. The Nature of same may be said of its physical configuration; the country is of country. an undulating character, the depressions being mostly \u201cs\u00e2wah,\u201d and the rising ground kampongs or secondary jungle. The hills, except near the Malacca frontier, seem to be of less elevation than in N\u00e2ning. Bukit B\u00ebsar is the only mountain in the country, exclu-\n\n(1) In N\u00e2ning.\n(2) Datar, i.e. flat.\nsive of those in the ranges which divide it from Sngei \u00dajong, Sri M\u00e9nanti and Johol.\n\nThe \"s\u00e2wah\" or padi-fields are extensive, but a good deal is now out of cultivation, owing to the fatal cattle disease which has raged during the last three years, and has carried off almost all the buffaloes. I saw very few indeed.\n\nA large proportion of the \"s\u00e2wah\" have, however, been planted out with padi this season, the fields having been prepared by means of a large wooden \"changkul\" or hoe, which is much used by the R\u00ebmbauans.\n\nThe \"s\u00e2wah\" divisions (\"jalor\" or \"p\u00eatak\") strike me as being a good deal smaller than those in our territory, probably owing to the fact that they are cultivated by hand, and the \"batas\" or dividing ridges appear much better kept.\n\nThe soil of the \"s\u00e2wah\" is of a lighter colour than is common in Malacca and there is more tendency to sand and quartz grit in it.\n\nThe yield appears to be high, averaging eighty to ninety, and in some places runs as high as a hundred-fold. At G\u00e0dong I noticed the \"s\u00e2wah\" soil was a very white clay with an admixture of grit, and was told it was particularly good and produced a hundred-fold. In this, as in other Malay countries, a certain amount of \"ladang,\" or high-land cultivation, of padi takes place, more particularly when circumstances are unfavourable for the \"s\u00e2wah\" or wet cultivation.\n\nThere is no tin worked in R\u00ebmbau, though it was acknowledged that it existed, but was not worked for fear of the water flowing from the workings poisoning the \"s\u00e2wah\" and preventing the cultivation of padi. At \u00dalu P\u00ebdas tin has been worked, but I heard it had been given up owing to rival claims.\n\nGranite is the prevailing rock, but quartz occasionally appears cropping up to a limited extent, and loose fragments are found in the streams. The soil on the mountains of Tampin and Dato' is good, of light brown, occasionally clayey. The variety of ferns on G\u00fbnong Dato' was considerable. The Tampin soil is said to be richer than any in Malacca, except that in the M\u00e2chap district\nwhere tapioca is said to grow best.\n\nThe view from G\u00fbnong Dato' is a fine one, extending westerly from the Sungei \u00dajong mountains, over the sea-board down to P\u00fblau B\u00ebsar in the South, where G\u00fbnong Tampin shuts out the view; between the latter, however, and B\u00fbkit H\u00fblu \u00c2pi-\u00c2pi, over which is the route to Johol from R\u00ebmbau proper, Mount Ophir rears its great pile.\n\nTo the immediate North lies G\u00fbnong B\u00ebr\u00e2gak slightly higher, and forming the end of the amphitheatre opposite G\u00fbnong Dato', with which it is connected by a semi-circular ridge: from this rise two nameless summits, the one adjoining G\u00fbnong Dato' being decidedly higher than the latter, and like the rest of the ridge covered with trees which shew no tendency to be dwarfed.\n\nG\u00fbnong Dato' itself I make 2,060 feet above G\u00e2dong at Haji Mastafa's house, which cannot be much above sea-level. G\u00fbnong nong Dato'. Tampin is, to judge by the eye, 200 feet higher.\n\nThe summit of G\u00fbnong Dato' is very peculiar, being formed of immense rocks, some 50 or 60 feet high resting on a space which is barely enough to support them; between the two main rocks hang suspended 2 or 3 smaller rocks, under which is sufficient room for a large party. On one of the smaller rocks in this chamber below has been placed an earthen jar into which water trickles from above; this water is often preserved by the devotees, who are constantly making the ascent to pay their vows, as having peculiar and sacred properties. On the top of the massive rocks first mentioned are smaller rocks which form the actual summit, and on one of these is to be seen a small hollow, shaped something like the print of a human foot. This footprint is attributed to the P\u00ebtri G\u00fbnong L\u00eadang (Princess of Mount Ophir)\u2014a fairy being, who touched here on her way from Tanjong T\u00fban, whence she had taken flight in her magic robes from the importunities of the crew of her late lord Nakh\u00f4da R\u00e2gam, whom she had in a moment of irritation slain with a prick of her needle. To this footprint the mountain owes its name of Dato', and its reputation as a \"kr\u00e2mat.\" There is only one tree among these rocks, and that not in the summit, so that there is a clear view all round, except where the mountains,\nlying close inland, intervene and shut out Sri M\u00e9nanti, J\u00e9lei, Johol, and the Moar River.\n\nI was fortunate in having a fine clear day on G\u00fbnong Dato,' and was able to take a number of bearings with a prismatic compass, including a certain number of places in R\u00ebmbau territory lying at my feet.\n\nThe result is embodied in the accompanying rough chart, which has of course no pretensions to accuracy, but may perhaps serve to give a better idea of the country than has hitherto been attainable.\n\nOn a further occasion I hope to give some further account of the chiefs of this State and their surbordinates, as well as of their functions, and some of the local customs.\n\nD.

H. Everett, known for his researches into the ornithology of the Philippines, do not claim to be more than a cursory survey, but may contain some elements of interest, as treating of two rivers that have remained practically unvisited since the respective visits of Mr. Burbidge, the botanist, on his journey to Kina Balu, and of the present Sir Spenser St. John, in one of his numerous exploring expeditions.\n\nThe Tawaran river is reported to take its rise in the mountains flanking the great mountain of Kina Balu to the South. An affluent of it, however, called by the local Dusuns the Sungei Damit, which flows into the main stream on its true right bank at a point some few miles only from the sea, is said by them to flow more from the North of East, and may, therefore, be surmised to take its rise from the western flank of the big mountain. The mouth of the Tawaran opens to the westward, and is partly closed by the invariable sandy bar which obstructs the entrances of all the rivers of this part of Borneo.\n\nStarting from the island of Gaya, where the North Borneo Company have a station, our route lay across the bay of that name, past the mouth of the Menggatal, or Kabatuan river, which, debouching to the westward, has good anchorage in deep water off its mouth, to a landing place called Gantisan situate in the bight of Sapangar bay, where formerly the vil-\nlage of Gantisan stood. A low neck of land separates Sapan-\ngar bay at this point from the adjacent basin of the Karimbu-\nnai river. Coal is reported by the natives at this point. The\nwater supply is good, and there is secure anchorage close in-\nshore protected from both monsoons. A very slight cutting\nwould suffice to pierce this narrow collar, and would thus\nrender Gantisan, the natural outlet of the trade of the Karim-\nbunai, Mengkabong and Tawaran rivers. The soil of the\nwhole of this dividing ridge is apparently lateritic sandstone.\n\nDescending into the valley of the Karimbunai river, a short\nwalk down its left bank brought us to the village of that name,\nthe headquarters of Pang\u00e9ran Ratu, the Governor of the dis-\ntrict, a feudatory of the Sultan of Brunei and a member of\nthe former Brunei royal family. On examining an outcrop\nof the strata on the river bank, the strike proved to be N.E.\nwith a dip of about 80\u00b0 bed rock sandstone. After an inter-\nview with the old Pang\u00e9ran, a boat was procured in which we\npaddled down to the common mouth of the Karimbunai and\nMengkabong rivers. This is remarkably narrow and would\nseem to have been contracted by the formation of a high sand-\nbank which has been, and is being, pushed southwards by the\ninfluence of the north-east monsoon and of the heavy swell\nfrom the China Sea, the action of the opposing monsoon being\ngreatly neutralized by the protection afforded by the project-\ning bluff of Gaya head to the south-westward. The entrance\nis said to be fairly* deep, but would probably be impractica-\nble in heavy north-westerly winds. Paddling up the broad\nexpanse of the Mengkabong river, our course, on the average,\nbeing about E. by N., we came upon some fine reaches of\nwater. Numerous channels branched off from the main one,\nwhich was flanked to the northward by mangrove growth, and\nto the south and east by grassy hills, while a bold range tow-\nered up to the S.E. A few miles further brought us to a\npoint at which the river expands into a large, lake-like sheet\nof water, from the upper end of which a perfect network of\nbroad channels diverge, dotted in all directions with Bajau\nvillages extending far away up to the foot of the mountains.\n\n* Eight feet or so.\nThe entire population of this district is Bajau, and is supported mainly by fishing, a little hill paddy being grown as well.\n\nThe Mengk\u00e2bong \"river,\" so called, bears evidences of having been originally an inlet of the sea dotted with sandstone islands, which have, for the most part, become connected by the rising of the land and by the silting up of the basin itself, the blocking up of the mouth of which, by sand-bars, has led to its assuming its present form. In general features, it much resembles the Sul\u00e2man basin, no great distance to the north of it.\n\nAfter threading this watery labyrinth for some hours we penetrated a narrow channel and landed at its head, at a small kampong called Brungis, whence a walk of about an hour over a low ridge, and then across a broad plain, brought us to the banks of the swiftly flowing Taw\u00e2ran river, which at this point is a fine stream rolling its turgid yellow flood along between sandy banks of medium height. The Taw\u00e2rau here intersects a level plain of large extent and sandy soil, dotted with homesteads surrounded by plantations of cocoa-nuts, and here and there under paddy cultivation. This plain is bounded by the sea to the W., by the mountains of the upper Taw\u00e2ran to the E., and to the S. by the low ridge mentioned above, which divides the respective water-sheds of the Taw\u00e2ran and the Mengk\u00e2bong. On the northern bank the plain apparently extends to the foot of the mountains separating the Taw\u00e2ran from the Sul\u00e2man basin. Our route from Brungis lay East, East by North and then North, and the portion of the plain traversed had a general fall towards the East of North, but a very slight one.\n\nOn striking the river, our course lay upstream for some considerable distance, at first over level ground, and then, when the limits of the plain had been reached, and the true valley of the Taw\u00e2ran entered, along the steep flanks of hills abutting on the stream, where a false step would often have precipitated one into the flood below. Fields of paddy, groves of cocoa-nut trees, herds of buffaloes, together with pigs, goats and poultry, betokened a well-to-do and prosperous population. Sugar-cane appeared to thrive, but the specimens seen were\nnot well planted and were short in the staple. Some of the Dusun homesteads dotted about this Tawaran plain possessed quite a home-like air of tranquillity and repose about them. Nestling in the grateful shade of cocoa-nut groves, bowered in broad-leaved bananas, and girdled with green paddy fields, they had a pleasant look to the tired traveller's eye. Snowy paddy birds dotted the verdant pastures, huge adjutant birds flew on lazy wing from point to point. The scene was not without its idyllic charms, nor were home-associations wanting in the familiar-sounding caw of the Bornean crow (Corvus ruficollis) as it was borne to the ear on the breeze.\n\nThe district towards the mouth of the Tawaran is called the Timbalang country, and has a Bajau colony settled in it. Above this point the Dusun population prevails, though a Bajau house may be found here and there. The tribal designation of the Tawaran Dusuns is Latud, and it may here be mentioned that that of the Dusuns up the Tampassuk river further north, is Tindal; that of the Dusuns in the vicinity of the North Borneo Company's Station of Kudat, on the north coast, Memdgun (vide the late Mr. F. Witt); while that of the Dusuns up the Labuk river, on the east coast, is Tambenua.\n\nReaching at sunset the house of a Bajau named Ibu, who had settled down there and had taken a Tawaran Dusun maiden to wife, we put up for the night, our slumbers soothed by the potent influence of some tuak, or cocoa-nut toddy, pressed upon us by the proprietor of a neighbouring Dusun house. This district we were told was called Telibong.\n\nAn early start on the morrow down the bank of the river, brought us to the village of Liong Liongan, the Tawaran at our starting point flowing from N.E. with a rapid current. The bed rock of this region is sandstone. Proceeding some distance further down stream we accomplished a perilous transit in a gobong, or dug-out canoe of the very slenderest dimensions. C'\u00e9tait un mauvais quart d'heure, for neither of us could swim, and the river, swollen by flood water, resembled a boiling, eddying Maelstr\u00f6m, but fortune was kind, and on safely reaching the right bank, a short walk brought us to the Sungei Damit, which we struck a few hundred yards above\nits confluence with the main river. The Sungai Damit is a deep, sluggish stream shut in by high muddy banks. Here we halted at the house of the Datu Bandara and Tumonggong\u2014a large, long structure of the ordinary Dusun barn-like type. A sago extracting apparatus was set up on the river bank here, in which product a moderate trade exists there. I had, en route, noticed cocoa-nut and areca palms, bananas, keladi, and paddy in profusion. The country is in fact very prosperous, in despite of the ravages of the memorable flood of January, 1833, which was very destructive in the Tawaran district. From the Datu Tumonggong's conversation, it appeared that a tamu, or market, was held at a place two days' journey up the Sungai Damit, to which the people of Kiau\u2014the village on the flanks of Kina Balu, visited by Messrs. Burbidge and Spenser St. John at different times\u2014came down to trade. The route was, however, at present closed, owing to a blood-feud.\n\nReturning in the afternoon to Ibu's house, we started, after a light repast, for Temeluri, a village some distance up the Tawaran, reaching the house of a Datu Massudi at about 3 P.M. The Tawaran is here a fine rapid stream, bordered on its true right bank by wooded hills, and on its left by level ground well planted with cocoa-nuts, with paddy fields beyond, bounded by hills in the back-ground. The height of the river rendering it impossible for us to proceed to Bawang or Lokob, we returned to our head-quarters in Ibu's house at the foot of the hill of Tagerangan, after a tramp of altogether some 15 miles or more. In the evening a native of Kiau, named Bungrax, arrived. This man, in the course of conversation, declared that no man had ever yet reached the true summit of Kina Balu, which, he asserted, is inaccessible from every side when once a certain elevation has been reached, the remainder of the ascent being sheer precipice. He added that there is a Dusun legend to the effect that a deep lake exists on the top. This is probably only a deduction on their part, drawn from the existence of perennial cataracts dashing down the topmost precipices, which form a magnificent feature in the landscape on the Tawaran.\n\nThe climate in the Tawaran valley is superb. At 5 A.M\nthe thermometer will often stand as low as $68^\\circ$, while the keen, cold air blowing down from the black towering summits that cut the eastern sky-line, invigorates the frame and braces the muscles for the coming labours of the day. It would require a poet's pen to do anything like justice to the gorgeous scenic effects and grand transformation scenes, as the orb of day rises behind the jagged mountain barrier. The whole country is so well opened up, that the monsoons have free play, and fever should be comparatively unknown. The soil may be described as sandy near the sea, but of every quality as one proceeds inland. Kina Balu bears about E.S.E. from the plain near the river mouth.\n\nAn hour's walk brought us back to Brungis, where we had left our pakerangan, or native boat, and some five hours more brought us to Gaya island, whence a start was effected early on the ensuing morning for the mouth of the Putatan river.\n\nThe Putatan river has two mouths\u2014the Pat\u00e2gas mouth, which lies a little to the E. of S. of the most southerly point of Gaya island at a distance, in a direct line, of about five miles, roughly estimated, and about half that distance south of Tanjong Aru; and its main mouth, Telipuk, which lies a short distance to the southward of Tanjong Togorongon. The former is the most accessible entrance, the main kuala having a very gradually shoaling foreshore, and but little depth of water on it at high water. The Pat\u00e2gas mouth opens to the westward and has a depth of about one fathom at low water. A short distance from it, to the northward, off Tanjong Aru, there is good anchorage close inshore for prahus and small boats, completely sheltered from both monsoons by an outlying sand-bank. The Putatan river is an appanage of the Sultan of Brunei, and of Pang\u00earan Muda Binjai's family.\n\nA paddle of little over a mile and a half, passing en route, on the true right bank, the confluence of the little river Munglab, brings one to a small Bajau village, the head of which is Datu Kilan. From this point the Pat\u00e2gas flows more from the S.E., and becomes very narrow and tortuous up to its divergence from the main Putatan, rather more than a mile further on, where (and situate therefore at the apex of\nthe delta of the 'Putatan) is a large Bajau kampong containing some hundreds of inhabitants. Directly above this the Dusun country begins. The head of this village is Datu S\u00e9tia. On landing some two miles further up, I found Gaya island bearing about due North. A cursory survey showed a fine open cultivated country, bounded some two miles off to the eastward by the foot-hills of the coast range, and dotted here and there with wooded knolls. The river maintains an average width of some seventy or eighty yards, with a winding course, whose main axis lies about East and West. It carries a good volume of water with a considerable amount of matter held in solution. From native report, it is not subject to severe floods, which may perhaps be attributed to its having two mouths to discharge by. Passing at 2 p.m. a considerable Dusun village, in which the very large house of Datu Barukis, the headman, is conspicuous, we fixed our head-quarters half an hour later, at the house of one Kawan, a Dusun, at a small hamlet named Kandayan. From this point \"Castle Peak\" (of the Admiralty Chart) bore S. by W., while the right hand flank of Kina Balu bore 80\u00b0 E. of N.\n\nAfter a pleasant walk across a fine open country to the house of a Chinaman named Ah Kong, whose occupation is that of distilling arrack from rice, we were glad on our return to settle down for the night. A daughter of our host being ill with fever, I administered some medicine to her, and a regular smoking divan was then formed, all the men, and the ladies also, joining the circle. The Dusun in this respect presents a favourable contrast to the sedate, if not \"dour\" Malay. He and all his belongings, male and female, after doing the honours, will freely sit down with you and join in the conversation. These Putatan Dusuns are by far the best type of their race that I have met. They are tall, well-developed, clean-skinned, bright and intelligent looking people, who look what they are\u2014well-fed and well-to-do. Among the bevy of damsels that sat around, were some by no means unprepossessing in appearance, with bright dark eyes, open laughing countenances, clean limbs and well-turned figures. A chorus of laughter was evoked by my desperate endeavours to explain to an intelligent young Du-\nsun that the earth is round like an orange, and not only revolves on its own axis, but round the sun also. Our merriment was, however, interrupted by the ravings of the fever-stricken patient, who had become delirious. Thereupon the entire company rose and adjourned to the long and broad verandah, when a most curious \"function\" was performed. Damar torches were lighted, and all the men squatted down in a circle outside the door of the patient's room. In the centre sat her brother, back to back with another relation. A tremendous din was then struck up by the beating of numerous gongs, hanging along the walls, in a kind of measured cadence, varied at intervals by a loud shout raised by all the men present. A youngish woman then commenced to dance with a slow measured step and swaying to and fro of her body, round the inside of the circle. In her left hand she held a stick, furnished at one extremity with a curious arrangement of black feathers. In her right she held a naked sword. With this latter she continually made passes, bringing the blade down edgways between the heads of the two sitting men, and then striking the feathered stick with it. This continued for some time. She then touched the heads of all present with her \"fetish\" rod, which was then discarded and a sarong taken up in its place. With this she danced slowly round and round, holding it out extended in front of her. All this time the shouts were being vigorously given forth at intervals, while the clanging of gongs was deafening. The woman then made up the sarong into a turban which she slowly brought down over the head of the sick woman's brother, letting it rest there for a few seconds. She then removed it and laid it gently down behind her, and the ceremony was over. A torch-light procession of travelling natives, passing the verandah just at this juncture, lent an additionally weird effect to the conclusion of this curious ceremony, whose strange rites and obscure origin may perhaps be admitted to warrant my description of it. Doubtless the idea is the casting of the evil spirit out of the sick person, and the good effects of the pills administered to the patient were probably set down to the credit of the ceremony.\n\nA remarkable thing in this district is the neatness and\ncomparative cleanliness of the bulk of the houses. Instead of the objectionable split nibong, the floors are made of beaten out bamboo, the walls, of the same material, neatly plaited, chess-board pattern. There are regular sleeping compartments, and a fine broad verandah runs from end to end of the house along the front of it. Our beds were arranged in the main body of the house, a fine lofty, airy apartment where dirt and mosquitoes were equally conspicuous by their absence. We noticed as a curious fact in these Dusuns, that they made use, in talking, of the letter Z, which would seem to point to their affinity to the Milanaus of Sarawak.\n\nAn early start on the ensuing morning brought us, after a seven-mile tramp, among the foot-hills of the coast range. We were here some twelve miles, or more, inland. On our way we passed the debouchure of the river Sugut, which joins the Putatan on its proper left bank, and further up, on the opposite side, the confluence of the Pagunan river, which is the true Putatan, the river bearing that name from this point, which we followed up, being in reality only a small tributary stream flowing from S.E. Pursuing our way up the valley of the latter, we reached our destination, a house at the foot of the hills, tenanted by an old Chinaman and his Dusun wife and daughter. We were here beyond the limits of the highly cultivated Putatan valley, and in a lovely country, at the point where the district of the Dusuns of the plain, marches with that of the Orang Tagas, or Hill Dusuns. The Putatan valley is, without exception, the finest and most highly cultivated district in North Borneo. Without visiting it, it would be difficult for any one, accustomed only to such cultivation, or the lack of it, as is met with in other parts of North Borneo, to realize that, side by side with such districts, there exists one in which rice cultivation has been carried to the highest pitch of perfection, where every foot of soil is tilled, where substantial, and in many cases ornamental, land-marks of wood and stone have been erected all over the face of the country, and where the price of land ranges from $40 an acre or thereabouts. This country must be the granary of Brunei. The acreage of paddy is immense. One\nfield, or rather plain, must, at a rough estimate, have been some 600 acres in extent, the whole being marked off by the land-marks of the different proprietors. It was intersected by the Longhap, a small, canal-like stream. The water supply for purposes of irrigation is unlimited, the levels are well laid out and the banks neatly kept up, a path running along the ridge of each. It would, however, be of great benefit to the district were a fresh stock of paddy introduced, larger in the ear, the present stock being small in the grain and shewing signs of deterioration. There are some 80 to 100 Chinese settled on the Putatan, the bulk of them being the descendants of former Chinese settlers, who have intermarried with the Dusuns and shew evidence of mixed blood. These Chinese are not agriculturists, nor, as far as I could learn, landed proprietors, but are principally distillers, manufacturing arrack, which they barter with the Dusuns. The soil is decidedly superior to that of the valleys of the Papar and Kimanis rivers to the South, and there is an almost total absence of swamp, owing, no doubt, to the country being all cleared, and the complete system of drainage. The surface configuration is that of a practically level plain studded with numerous small hills, on which the timber has wisely been left standing. The paddy fields extend up to the very bases of these. In moist tracts and along the lines of water-courses, some sago is grown, but the quantity of this is inconsiderable. Some five piculs of gutta come down from the interior monthly, and tobacco, camphor, beeswax and armadillo skins form the staple exports. The Brunei Government imposes a tax of from $6 to $9 per head per annum, or about $200 for each pangkalan, or village landing-place. The number of the villages is remarkable, and in some parts of the upper portion of the river, they lie in sight of, and sometimes quite contiguous to, one another. The general aspect of the whole country is that of an orderly, industrious and civilized community, and a very fair prospect unfolds itself to the eye of one looking forth from the summit of one of the picturesque little hills above referred to, over the far stretching expanse of green paddy plains, clustering villages and detached homesteads nestling amid their\nsurroundings of tall cocoa-nut and spreading sago palms, while dotted over the plain, the numerous wooded knolls rise like islands amid a sea of green. It is a smiling landscape abounding in soft beauty, and backed by a range of noble mountains, with the father of them all\u2014the towering Kina Balu\u2014rearing his lofty mass on the northern horizon. Indeed, for general evidences of prosperity, plenty and industry, and of well applied principles of cultivation carried out on a most exhaustive and extensive scale, the Putatan district may be fairly said to be unequalled in the whole of North Borneo. The formation of the lowlands and foot-hills is sandstone of recent formation.\n\nThe Putatan does not apparently drain any of the Kina Balu water-shed, although the river, which, as before stated, goes by the name of the Pagunan above the confluence of the Putatan river so called, can, I was informed, be ascended for fifteen days. The Orang Tag\u00e1s, a hill Dusun people, who wear the chaw\u00e1t, or bark loin-cloth, and who are found at the head-waters of all the rivers in N.W Borneo, from the Taw\u00e2ran to the Kim\u00e2nis, inhabit the upper portion of the river down to its debouchure from the main coast range.\n\nI noticed a curious musical instrument, a species of guitar, called by the Dusuns tonkoonong. This is made of a piece of large bamboo about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long and has 6 strings which are formed by the detaching and raising thin strips of the bamboo sheath. These are tightened at will by pushing a piece of wood along underneath each towards its point of junction with the bamboo.\n\nTheir customs are much the same as those of the bulk of the Dusun race. An intending bridegroom has to pay a marriage portion for his bride. When a father dies, his lands and property go to his sons, the eldest getting the largest share. The widow has no share, but has a right to the usufruct of the estate during her life, and the daughters have a claim for support upon the estate until marriage. At his death, a Dusun, if a poor man, is buried in the ground, a small house being erected over his grave, from and above which various coloured calico streamers are dependent. If a rich man, his body is buried in a valuable old jar. The value of some of\nthese old jars is very great, amounting in some instances to hundreds of dollars, and the expenses of the funeral obsequies of an opulent Dusun chief often amount to over $600, buffaloes being killed and eaten, tuak consumed in large quantities, obat (fetish ceremonies) performed, etc.\n\nAlthough the Putatan cannot properly be described as a sago river, its delta would afford a large area of land suitable for planting the sago palm, the land being low-lying and swampy, and abutting on a good water-way on either side. The highlands of the interior are easily accessible up its valley, the climate is salubrious and pleasant, the population large and well-disposed, but the lands along its banks are firmly held and highly valued, and it is doubtful whether any area of such land could ever be brought into the market.\n\nThe course of the main Putatan, or Telipuk, to the sea, from the point at which the Patagas branch diverges from it, is somewhat tortuous but has a good depth of water. Its mouth, however, as already stated, is shoal and difficult of entry. An examination of an outcrop of the strata on its right bank, on the way down, shewed the strike to be S.E. with a dip of about 80\u00b0. A mangrove growth extends up both banks for a short distance from the kuala, and also along the coast on either side, and there is no beach available for landing on. This is not the case with the Patagas mouth which has a sandy beach and true jungle close to the sea with however mangroves inside.\n\nAs regards the state of cultivation of the tract watered by it, the Putatan may be fairly classed as the show river of North Borneo.\n\nS.

C. Klinkert, one of the best Malay scholars in Holland, has it in contemplation to publish an English-Malay Dictionary, adapted from his new Dutch-Malay Dictionary now passing through the press.\n\nWhether the English edition will, or will not, be produced, will depend upon the measure of support which may be depended on. A certain number of subscribers should be forthcoming, in the first instance, to ensure that a work involving so much labour will not result in pecuniary loss. The publication of the work, if subscribers are found in sufficient number (and among these, the Government of the Straits Settlements, the Raja of Sarawak and the Directors of the British North Borneo Company may perhaps be counted upon for substantial support?), will be undertaken by Mr. E. J. Brill of Leyden, whose recently issued prospectus is subjoined:\n\n\"Mr. H. C. Klinkert whose scientific and practical publications on the Malay Language and Literature have already contributed so largely to the knowledge of that language, has, as the result of several years' study, undertaken the compilation of an English-Malay Dictionary, which is to be published next year. When, during the Oriental Congress at Leyden, Mr. Klinkert, speaking with some competent men on this publication, was requested to make it accessible to those also, who do not understand the Dutch Language. Though a very tedious work, he would not directly decline the request, if by a sufficient subscription it should appear that the work would meet the wishes of those who are to use it.\n\nWith regard to the manner in which he intends to compile this dictionary, he believes it to be in consonance with the spir-\nit of the language simple and natural, and\u2014what his long experience confirms\u2014thoroughly practical.\n\nThe transcription of the Malay words will be given in the dialect of the Straits-Settlements, after the manner adopted by Messrs. Maxwell and Keasberry.\n\nThe English part will be revised by a native Englishman. As soon as we have a sufficient number of subscribers\u2014we shall begin printing. The subscription price for one copy is twenty-five shillings, bound\u2014\n\nTo show the manner in which the author has formed his plan, and to give an idea of its completeness and extent, we give a specimen, annexed to this prospectus.\n\nThe whole will be about one thousand\u2014or one thousand two hundred pages.\n\nTo lay claim to completeness the Dictionary of the English and Malay languages now projected ought to be followed by a Dictionary of the Malay and English languages, the materials for which are in preparation. It will be published as a second volume, if the support accorded to the present volume gives sufficient encouragement.\"\n\nLeyden, October, 1884.\n\n\"E. J.

C. B. Cerutti, F. H. Gottlieb, G. S. H. Gottlieb.\n\nMr. Knight then proposed that the Officers of the Society be added to by the creation of a Vice-President for Malacca, and that the Hon'ble D. F. A. Hervey be elected to that office.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary explained that the constitution of the Society is fixed by the Rules, and that before altering them, it would be desirable that notice should be given, and the nature of the proposed alteration made known to the members of the Society. This view was generally concurred in by those present. It was suggested in conversation that a sixth Councillor might be appointed, who should be resident in Malacca, but to this course the same objection applied. The Honorary Secretary said that he would be glad to see the meetings of the Society held under a Vice-President in Malacca, for that Settlement had a historical claim, having been the scene of a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1811, when Raffles and Leyden were there on their way to Java.\n\nMr. Knight said that he would, if necessary, give notice of his proposal at some future date.\n\nThe proceedings then terminated.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1884.\n\nThe Report which the Council for 1884 have to lay before the Annual General Meeting will, they believe, shew that the interest evinced in the objects for which the Society was established in 1878 continues unabated, and that those objects are being steadily kept in view by those to whom the management of the affairs of the Society is entrusted.\n\nThe new members elected provisionally by the Council since the last General Meeting are:\u2014\n\nWalter Egerton.\nE.

Krohn.  \nGeorge Mansfield.\n\nIn the Report for 1883, mention is made of a textbook of Eastern Geography which the Society had undertaken, at the request of the Government, to produce. The first part of this work (the Malay Peninsula and Borneo) has now been published, and the following letter regarding it has been received from the Government of the Colony:\n\n\"Colonial Secretary's Office,  \nSingapore, 12th February, 1885.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary,\n\nStraits Asiatic Society, Singapore.\n\nSir.\u2014I am directed by the Acting Governor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with regard to the publication of the work entitled the \"Eastern Geography,\" and to state that His Excellency fully recognises the valuable assistance which the Society has afforded to the Government in acceding to the request that it should undertake this work, and desires especially to tender the cordial thanks of the Government to the Vice-President (Mr. A. M. Skinner) for the valuable results of the action of the Society.\n\n2. The work which he has edited\u2014the first of its kind as regards this part of the world\u2014will, in His Excellency's opinion, prove of very great usefulness both inside the Schools of this Colony, and outside the Colony itself, where so much ignorance prevails regarding the Malay Peninsula and its neighbourhood.\n\n3. I am to add that His Excellency concurs in the recommendation of the Council of the Society, and will invite the Legislative Council to vote the necessary sum to enable Mr. Stanford's offer to be accepted. It appears to His Excellency that if the part regarding Australia is to be omitted, as His Excellency considers it should be, it may not even be necessary to pay so much as \u00a3100.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. P. Talbot,\nfor Acting Colonial Secretary, S. S.\"\nThe scheme for republishing a selection of papers which have appeared from time to time in the Journals or Proceedings of learned Societies bearing upon matters of scientific interest in the Eastern Archipelago, has taken definite shape.\n\nThe consent of the Asiatic Society of Bengal having been received to the republication of papers relating to Indo-China which have appeared in their Journals, the first series of selections will consist of papers extracted from \"Asiatic Researches\" and the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. These will probably be preceded by a few papers originally published in Dalrymple's \"Oriental Repertory.\" The Council have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of Dr. Reinhold Rost, Librarian of the India Office, who has consented to edit the re-printed papers in London. It is hoped that two volumes will be brought out during 1885, and it will then rest with the Society whether or not to extend the scheme and continue to issue, from time to time, as funds may allow, further volumes of selected papers relating to the Far East.\n\nThe previous ventures of the Society in the direction of publishing have not caused, in the aggregate, any pecuniary loss. The large Map of the Peninsula (1879) has, up to date, left a margin of profit of $33.63, with 8 copies still in hand.\n\nThe re-publication of the \"Hikayat Abdullah\" cost $100, of which $368 has been recovered, and 2 copies remain.\n\nIn the Department of Geography, the Council have noted with satisfaction the publication during the year 1884, by the Government of the Native State of Selangor, of a map of the State (published by Mr. E. Stanford, Charing Cross) on the scale of 2 miles to the inch.\n\nThe Skeleton Map of the Peninsula, upon which all new information is to be entered as exploration advances, mentioned in last year's Report, has been completed, and several maps and sketches embodying fresh geographical knowledge have been received from the Native States.\n\nThe most important of these is the Map of Ulu Pahang by Mr. W. Cameron, a most indefatigable explorer as well as a skilful surveyor and geologist.\n\nFour of the papers published in the Society's Journal since the last General Meeting are by Members who had not previously contributed, and the Council hope that they may infer from this that the number of active Members is increasing. They desire, however, to renew the appeal made in last year's Report, for\nliterary contributions on scientific subjects from those willing to co-operate in the objects of the Society.\n\nIt is believed that some will perhaps contribute notes, who have not leisure to write papers, and, in order to encourage this, it is proposed to develop the idea with which a few pages have usually been set apart in each number of the Journal for \"Miscellaneous Notes,\" and to publish in each future number a paper devoted to \"Notes and Queries,\" which will be edited by the Honorary Secretary.\n\nNo. 12 of the Journal of this Society (for the half-year ending December, 1883) did not appear until May, 1884, and No. 13 (for the half-year ending June, 1884) was only published in December last.\n\nThe absence of the Honorary Secretary from the Colony in the spring and autumn of the year partly accounts for this. No. 14 (for the last half-year of 1884) is now in the press.\n\nThe following papers have been published in the Journal of the Society since the last General Meeting:\n\n\"Malayan Ornithology\" (Part III), by Capt. Kelham, Highland Light Infantry.\n\"Gutta-producing Trees,\" by L. Wray, Jr.\n\"Shamanism in Perak,\" by W. E. Maxwell.\n\"Changes in Malayan Dialects,\" by A. M. Ferguson, Jr.\n\"Straits Meteorology,\" by A. M. Skinner.\n\"The Pigmies,\" translated by J. Errington de la Croix.\n\"Valentyn's Description of Malacca,\" translated by J. M\u00fcller, edited by D.

Its highest summit lies about S. 17\u00b0 E. of Thaipeng, distant, say, twenty miles as the crow flies. It is one of the series of nearly detached groups of mountains which form the coast-range, having their spurs and longest axes generally in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction. There is no record of any exploration of Gunong Bubu. It is said that some Europeans have ascended it and made a collection of plants, but what the Reverend Mr. Scortechini and I saw of the flora, inclines us to think that some of the adjacent and lower summits could only have been reached. The mountain is not quite 5,600 feet high, but rendered very inaccessible by precipices of granite 1,000 feet high, which bar most of the spurs. At the request of Sir Hugh Low, I undertook its exploration, accompanied by the Revd. B. Scortechini as botanist, and Mr. C. F. Bozzolo, who had charge of the Malays carrying our baggage. We started from the mountain garden at Arang Para, which is about 3,000 feet above sea level\u2014not a good point of departure, as we had to descend and then climb up again over several very steep spurs before we could reach even the foot of the range. The following is the journal.\n\nMay 29, 1884.\u2014Started from the mountain garden at 9 A.M. on a course due south, descending a very steep slope along a mountain track used by Chinese sawyers. It soon began to rain heavily, which made the steep path so slippery that\nprogress was exceedingly slow. We at last reached the bottom of a narrow gorge, through which a mountain torrent came down with considerable force. From this point to the summit of Gunong Bubu, our road had to be cut through the jungle. After wading along the stream to find a convenient point for climbing the next spur or ridge, we crossed it, having difficult and slow climbing both in ascending and descending. The forest was a close jungle of rattans and saplings, with an undergrowth of ferns which completely closed us in above and around. A second spur, still higher than the first, was ascended, but on its ridge we found the jungle in a slight degree more open, so we continued along it. It ascended slowly. In about two miles, finding that it was taking us too much out of our course, we left the ridge and crossed another spur which was very steep, rendering it necessary to proceed by a series of long zigzags. Rested in the furthest valley, and then mounted another ridge higher and steeper than any we had previously climbed. On the edge, we found an old rhinoceros beat, which we followed, ascending for about a mile, where it terminated on the summit of an almost precipitous bluff. The rain was so heavy at this point, that we had to wait till it ceased before we could descend. This was no easy matter, and occupied until nearly sunset in bringing down our baggage. In the valley, we found a branch of the Kenas River making a pretty cascade over large granite boulders. Here we built nice little sheds which the large-leaved Pinanga palm enabled us to thatch comfortably.\n\nMay 21.\u2014We left our encampment about 7.30, following the stream until it joined the Kenas River. Near this we found a species of Helicia, which is the second proteaceous plant we have noticed in Perak. We also found a splendid species of Fagraea, probably F. auriculata, with large fragrant\ncream-coloured flowers nearly a foot across the rotate corolla, the tube of which is eight inches long.\n\nThe Kenas River is about one hundred feet wide, descending in rapids amid large granite boulders. It contains many deep water-holes with fishes, different somewhat from those on the P\u00earak. They are under examination, with a view to specific description. There are also land crabs about the stream and a peculiar species of prawn (Pal\u00e6mou?).\n\nFrom the Kenas, we struck to the west of south crossing two small, steep, densely-wooded spurs. This brought us to the base of a steep slope, which was at the foot of Gunong Bubu. Here the jungle became more open, being mostly composed of forest trees and Bertam palm (Engeissonia tristis). We soon lost sight of the Pinanga which we had found on the Kenas. There was a distinct rhinoceros beat on the crest, covered with foot-prints, which had been made only a few hours before. The logs which lay in the way were smoothed by the constant passing and repassing of these animals. There were also many of these water-holes and it was difficult to imagine that they had not been cut artificially on one side. The jungle was easily cut, but the track was so steep as scarcely to afford a footing in places. It took us nearly the whole day to climb a distance of 5,000 yards, and then we camped on a narrow terrace near a small trickling supply of water. Near this camp, we could hear the roaring of a large cascade, probably not far off, but the descent to it was too steep for us to attempt to reach it then. Our huts were built of attap and were large and comfortable. We had descended so much from our starting point that we were still below the level of the Hermitage garden of Arang Para.\n\nMay 22.\u2014Before starting this morning we sent back a party of Malays to bring up fresh supplies to this camp for our\nreturn journey. We got away about 8 A.M. It is very difficult to make an early move from these camps. What with cooking rice for the day and packing up the baggage, a good part of the morning runs away. Our journey was just like that of yesterday, only a little more steep in places. About 1,000 feet above camp we left the region of Bertam, or attap palms, and came into that of Lieuala, growing amid high forest trees. Up to this time, we could not get a single view of the country around us. When we had ascended to the level of Arang Para we felled a number of trees in the hope of extending the prospect, but were unsuccessful. The ascent was now only very steep in places, and the spur curved much more to the north. When we reached the height of nearly 4,000 feet above the sea, we camped and built our houses. When this was done, we felled a good deal of timber on the northern slope of the spur and soon opened up an extensive view. Arang Para bungalow bore about E.N.E., but none of the Larut side of the range was visible, owing to the spurs of Mount Bubu. We had an abundance of water close to our camp. A small stream fell over about one hundred feet of rocks at a short distance below the terrace we were upon.\n\nNext day, the 23rd, we left all the baggage at our resting place, and proceeded to make a trial trip to reach the summit. We could get no reliable information from the Malays. Some said it was only two hours' journey, while others insisted that it would take the whole day. Our intention was to climb for half a day, and, if the difficulties were great, to move our camp on another stage. Our great delay, of course, was in cutting down the jungle and not being able to see more than a few yards around us. However, we were agreeably surprised to find a comparatively easy, though steep, ascent for\nabout a mile. After this, we had to climb by roots of trees, stumps and branches, and made but slow progress. I cannot say now whether this portion of our journey was on the face of a cliff or not. We could see absolutely nothing around us but trees and roots, and these overhung with such a thick coating of brown moss, ferns and orchids, that above and below were equally hidden. Sometimes we crept in and out under these roots and over them, or climbed a tree to get to some ledge near its upper branches, but where we were going, or how far we were, could only be guessed from the barometer. I do not suppose, however, that any one could climb so steep an ascent with less danger. One could not fall. It would puzzle any person to throw a stone more than a few yards amid such a thicket.\n\nAt five thousand feet by the aneroid, we began to see the first specimens of that graceful fern Matonia pectinata. This has never been previously recorded from Perak, and the only habitats are Java and Mount Ophir near Malacca, where it is associated with Dipteris Horsfeldii. The latter fern we had seen 1,000 feet below, and it occurs on all the mountains of Perak at heights a little over 3,500 feet but at Singapore it is found at the sea level. Besides this, there was plenty to see and admire in the way of ferns, orchids and mosses, with many curious fungi and lichens, for the moisture and deep shade made the place the very home of the cryptogamia. But the climbing was such very hard work, that attention to anything else was almost impossible. At about 5,400 feet, the entire vegetation changed. It was still a thicket, but more or less stunted and twiggy, very distressing to climb. I cannot say how long it continued, but long before I expected it, we suddenly found ourselves on an open level space, on the summit of Mount Bubu.\nThis, however, is not the highest point. The crest of the mountain is a narrow ridge about half a mile long, gradually sloping up to the northward until it is about 100 feet above where we then were. This might be called the lower shoulder of the ridge or crest. A splendid view was obtainable three-quarters round the compass, but the north was hidden by the higher summit.\n\nThe first thing that attracted our attention was the vegetation. The trees were all low and small, stunted and gnarled by the weather. Beneath there was a thick carpet of moss, into which the foot sunk some inches and when withdrawn left a pool of water on the foot-print. Above this was a most luxuriant growth of heather (*Lycopodium nutans*), while *Matonia pectinata* spread out its fan-like fronds on every side. The sides of the trees were hoary with long-bearded lichens (*Usnea borbata*) and mosses. There were only a few species of trees. One very common one was a conifer, but in the absence of any cones we were left in doubt whether it was *Dacrydium elatum* or some other species. Abundance of young plants of this pine covered the ground. There were also thickets of *Leptospermum flavescens*, which grew as high as the pine, and a shrub of the genus *Leucopogon*. The two latter are entirely Australian on their affinities, and both species are found on that continent. Besides these, there were abundance of Nepenthes or pitcher-plants with bushes of Rhododendrons (*R. verticillatum*?), with a *Gahnia* and some few other flowering plants and ferns.\n\nFrom this point, a hasty exploration was made to the highest point or northern summit of the mountain. Though scarcely half a mile in direct distance, it required considerably over a mile of hard climbing to reach it. The roots of the bushes have proved a kind of upper platform on the crest and\nthus one has to climb over and under in a most disgraceful manner, as the whole was an entangled mass of twigs which stopped and caught one at every side, besides being dripping with water. By the time the highest crest was reached, the clouds had gathered, and no view could be obtained. Having satisfied ourselves about the road, and cleared the most of it, we turned back. Though the descent was slower and more troublesome than going up, yet we reached our camp easily an hour before sunset. Our supplies had not arrived, and our chances of making a second ascent seemed rather uncertain. Our last rations of rice were served out that evening. On the next day (Queen's birthday, hence the camp was called Queen's Camp) we cleared away much more of the forest, but as the party were without food, and there were no signs of our messengers, we prepared, with much chagrin, to return to our lower camp. We had just packed everything when the supplies arrived. Our messengers had lost themselves in the jungle and this was the cause of the delay.\n\nOn the 27th, taking with us a light equipment for camping, we again ascended the summit of the mountain. After erecting our tents, or rather our waterproof sheets which served as a substitute, we went on to the summit and built an immense heap of wood and dammar resin to serve as a signal fire at night. Beyond the summit there is a steep valley and at the other side are isolated pinnacle of granite nearly as high as the mountain and perfectly precipitous except on the side of the valley. Messrs. Scortechini and Bozzolo ascended this with much hard climbing and found on the summit a small pile of stones and a flag-staff, while the remains of a flag were strewn on the ground. It is supposed that this flag was placed there at the instance of Captain Speedy, who paid the Malays a considerable sum to plant a flag there for surveying\npurposes. We found no other signs that any person had visited the locality before.\n\nA perfect deluge of rain with thunder and lightning obliged Messrs. Bozzolo and Scortechini to remain on the granite pinnacle for some time, for the cloud and mist obscured everything and rendered it impossible to descend. I remained on the opposite summit superintending the erection of the bonfire. It was miserably cold, and we were all very glad when we could make our way back to our tents. This we did not do until the clouds cleared, when a magnificent view was unveiled. Both sides of the coast range were visible and the plains from the Dinding River to the town of Thaipeng were laid out like a panorama. The Matang opening with the village seemed just beneath us. The whole valley of the P\u00earak with all the windings of the river were clear and distinct for a distance of fifty or sixty miles. The main range was also very clear and some of the highest peak bore a different aspect from anything I had seen before. An island between P\u00earak and Sumatra, which is rarely seen from Mount Ijau, was now plainly visible, as also several summits of mountains to the south-east. Nothing could be seen of the mountain observed by Mr. Swettenham from Arang Para. The highest summit visible to us was, in my opinion, the sugar-loaf hill to the north and east of Gunong Robinson. I should think the mountain I refer to is between eight thousand and nine thousand feet high.\n\nAltogether, the view from the summit of Gunong Bubu is one of the finest imaginable. Rivers and mountains, dense forests and open plains, the distant sea and the unexplored forests to the eastward all combine to form a scene of wonderfully varied beauty. Unfortunately, however, the clouds and mists almost continually obscure this prospect. At early morning and after a heavy thunderstorm, the whole atmosphere is\ncomparatively clear. At other times, there is generally either a cap of cloud on the summit of the mountain itself or the whole valleys are shrouded with dazzling masses of steam-like white vapour in which the mountain tops peep out like islands.\n\nWe returned to our camp about sunset, and then proceeded to light our signal fires. We had one on each end of the crest so as to be well seen from the valley of the Perak on one side and Thaipeng on the other. Owing to the good supply of dammar we had obtained, we were able to kindle a very bright and conspicuous flame at each station and we were answered by fires from Sengang, Kwala Kangsa, and other places on the Perak river as well as from Kota and Matang on the Larut side. We also fired rockets, but these were not seen except in places very close to the mountain.\n\nOur tents were completely open on one side, but the cold was not great until nearly dawn. The temperature then went down to $58^\\circ$ Fahrenheit, which was the lowest reached on this journey. At 4 A.M. we were visited by heavy rain and a strong wind from the east. Our shelter did not protect us from either, so that we passed the time rather uncomfortably until sunrise, when the rain ceased. Everything was then so wet that we could not attempt to dry our clothes, we therefore returned to Queen's Camp as speedily as we could. Having taken a hasty and scanty meal there, we made our way to our second day's camp reaching it easily at sunset. We expected to meet supplies at this camp, but they had not arrived. We had nothing but cocoa to serve out to our weary and hungry Malays after their long journey, but with this they were satisfied and went to rest quite cheerfully. An early start on the following morning enabled us to reach the Kenas River at an appointed depot, and here we found the much-needed supplies at about noon.\nI have already mentioned that, at the camp of the preceding evening, we could again distinctly hear the roar of some large cascade at about half a mile from where we were. We tried to search it, but the jungle was too thick and the descent too steep to do so that night, our want of provisions obliged us to push on without further delay in the evening. From the noise we heard, there must be a fine body of water, falling from a considerable height.\n\nThe camp we were now upon was not one we had occupied on our outward journey. It was on the River Kenas. The stream was here about eighty yards wide and descending in rapids amid large rocks. There were many deep pools of beautifully clear water. We spent a few days fishing on these pools, and caught a good many rock-fish and mullet about one pound in weight. Three species of fish were seen and a peculiar prawn. I believe the fish were species of *Barbus therapon*, and what I thought was *Polyacanthus cuponus*. The latter is the scaly fish (without barbels) which is found in the ditches and paddy fields.\n\nIn returning from the camp, we crossed the watershed between the Kenas and Kangsa, in order to explore the course of that river, which was not previously known. The watershed was somewhat difficult of access, and took us to a height of about three thousand feet above the sea-level. We had the misfortune to meet with bad weather and incessant rain during this part of the journey. The river Kangsa, even in its upper portions, was swollen into a fierce muddy stream, quite impassable, except on fallen trees. Of these there were many lying from bank to bank on the rocky sides of the torrent. We soon found that the water descended in a series of cascades for a depth of about 1,100 feet. I can give no idea of the grand magnificence of the scenery at this part of our jour-\nney. Whether there was a flood in the river or not, the beauty of the rocks and precipices in the wild forest could not be surpassed. We had to descend by a series of zigzags crossing the successive cascades on logs sometimes at a considerable height above the water. If ever the romance of a lovely view was destroyed by the perils of a journey, it was here. We had to cross fifteen of these aerial bridges. Some were narrow and some were half rotten, and all were over cascades where the slightest slip was certain destruction. In the lower part of the stream we had to ford the water, which was just fordable and no more. I consider that it was quite wonderful that this part of our journey was accomplished without accident, which, however, was only effected by constant care and much delay. We arrived at Lady Weld's rest-house on the Kuala Kangsa Road on the evening of the last day of the month the most of which had been spent in the jungle, and none the worse for our sojourn away from civilization, except in the innumerable leech-bites from which we all suffered.\n\nJ. E. TENISON-WOODS.\n\nNote.\u2014Amongst the fishes of the Kenas there was a small specimen of what I took to be *Ophioccephalus micropeltes*, but the species is doubtful. The barbel may have been *B. kolus*.\n\nSince our journey, the mountain has been again ascended by Mr. Cantley, the Government Botanist, who obtained a good collection of plants.\nSEA DYAK RELIGION.\n\nII.\n\n(Continued from Journal No. 10 p. 243.)\n\nIn a former number of the Straits Asiatic Journal (No. 10), some account was given of the religious ideas and customs of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak; of their belief in gods and evil spirits; of their sacrifices and auguries. The subject is incomplete without a consideration of their burial rites, and their ideas of eschatology. These I now endeavour to supply.\n\nBut first a word about marriage. Birth is not celebrated with any religious ceremony, and marriage is a comparatively simple matter. The marriage ceremony consists principally in publicly fetching the bride from her father's to the bridegroom's house, but the Dyak, with his love of divination, could not allow such an occasion to pass without some attempt, or pretence, to penetrate the secrets of the future. When the bridal party are assembled in the bride's house, and the arrangements for the young couple talked over, a pinang (betel-nut) is split into seven pieces by someone supposed to be lucky in matrimonial affairs; and these pieces, together with the other ingredients of the betel-nut mixture, are put in a little basket, which is bound round with red cloth and laid for a short time upon the open platform outside the verandah of the house: should the pieces of pinang by some mystic power increase in number, the marriage will be an unusually lucky one; but should they decrease, it is a bad omen, and the marriage must be postponed, or relinquished altogether; but, as matter of experience, they neither increase nor decrease; and this is interpreted in the obvious sense of an ordinary marriage upon which the spirits have pronounced neither good nor bad. This action gives the name to the whole ceremony, which is called Mlah* pinang\u2014splitting the betel-nut. When the bride has\n\n* Belah, Malay.\u2014Ed.\nbeen brought to her future husband's house, a fowl is waved* over them, with a hastily muttered invocation for health and prosperity; and with this semi-sacrificial action the marriage is complete.\n\nDeath is much more involved with sacred observances. Although the Dyaks have something of the Moslem sentiment of fate, and commonly speak of the measure of a man's life, which once reached nothing can prolong, yet this does not seem to help them to a quiet submission to the inevitable; for, even when death is unmistakeably drawing near, they are eager in fruitless efforts of resistance, and the scene is generally one of tumultuous wailing. They will shout wildly to the medicine-man to recover the wandering spirit, and they will call out to the dying\u2014\"Come back; do not go with the spirits who are leading you astray to Hades. This is your country, \"and we are your friends.\" The word pulai,pulai, \"return, return,\" is reiterated in piercing, piteous tones. Silence and reverent awe in the presence of death would be regarded as culpable callousness to the interests of a life trembling in the balance. And when actual dissolution is plainly imminent, they dress the person in the garments usually worn, and some few ornaments in addition, that the man may be fully equipped for the untried journey; and in violent demonstrations of grief, the women and younger people wait the end, or perhaps rush distractedly about in hopes of doing something to delay it. As soon as respiration has ceased, a wild outburst of wailing is heard from the women, which proclaims to all the village that life is extinct. The cessation of visible breathing is with the Dyak the cessation of life; he knows of no other way to distinguish a prolonged state of coma from death, and I have good reason to believe that sometimes bodies have been buried before they were corpses.\n\nAfter death the body is lifted from the room to the ruai, or verandah, of the village-house; some rice is sprinkled upon the breast, and it is watched until burial by numerous relatives and friends who come to show their sympathy. The nearer connections of the deceased will probably be heard\n\n* This waving of a sacrifice or offering is a noticeable feature in the practice of Hindu exorcists in India.\u2014Ed.\nshouting out to some departed relative to come from Hades and take them away also, feeling at the moment that life is unbearable. At a burial once I saw a woman jump down into the grave, and stretch herself at full length upon the coffin loudly begging to be buried with her husband.\n\nAmong some tribes, there are professional wailers, nearly always women, who are hired to wail for the dead. One of these is now fetched, not only to lament the lost, but by her presence and incantation to assist the soul in its passage to Hades. Her song takes about twelve hours to sing, and the sum of it is this. She calls with tedious prolixity upon bird, beast and fish to go to Hades with a message, but in vain, for they cannot pass the boundary. She then summons the spirit of the winds to go, and\u2014\n\n\"Call the dead of ancient times,\n\"To fetch the laid out corpse under the crescent moon,\n\"Already arranged like the galaxy of the milky way.\n\n\"To call those along ago bent double,\n\"To fetch the shroud of our friend below the moon,\n\"Already a heap like the hummock of the rengguang. (1)\n\n\"To call the far away departed,\n\"To fetch the nailed coffin under the dawn of the rising sun,\n\"Already like the form of a skilled artisan's chest.\n\n\"To call the long departed ones,\n\"To fetch the resak-wood coffin below the brilliant moon,\n\"Already bound with golden bands.\"\n\nThe Spirit of the Winds is reluctant at first; but, at the solicitation of his wife, at length consents to do the wailer's bidding. He speeds on his way through forests and plains, hills and valleys, rivers and ravines, until night comes on and he is tired and hungry, and stops to make a temporary resting place. After refreshing himself, he goes up a high tree to make sure of the proper road. \"He looks round, and all is dark and dim in the distance: he looks behind, and all is obscure and con-\n\n(1) A crustacean which burrows in the earth.\n\"fused: he looks before him, and all is gloomy as night.\" On all sides are roads, for the ways of the dead are seventy times seven. In his perplexity, he drops his human spirit form, and by a stroke of ghostly energy metamorphoses himself into rushing wind; and soon makes known his presence in Hades by a furious tempest which sweeps everything before it, and rouses the inhabitants to enquire the cause of the unwonted commotion. They are told. They must go to the land of the living and fetch so and so and all his belongings. The dead rejoice at the summons, and without delay collect their friends, get into a boat and pull through the stygian waters; and with such force does the boat plough the lake, that all the neighbouring fish die. Arrived at the landing place, they all make an eager rush into the house; \"like soldiers who fly upon the spoil; and mad like wild pigs they seize the dead one.\" The departed soul cries out in anguish at being thus violently carried off; but long before the ghostly party has reached their abode, it becomes reconciled to its fate.\n\nThus sings the wailer, who has now done her work. She has convoyed the soul to its new home, which it would never reach, it is said, without her intervention; but remain suspended somewhere, and find rest nowhere.\n\nThe climate necessitates a speedy interment; but there is another reason for putting their dead quickly out of sight. After life is extinct, the body is no longer spoken of as a body or corpse; it is an antu, a spirit; and to have it long with them would, apart from sanitary considerations, expose them to sinister ghostly influences. Some time before daylight, a sufficient number of men take away the corpse wrapped in mats and secured with a light framework of wood; and as it is being borne from the house, ashes are thrown after it, and a water-gourd is flung and broken on the floor. The graveyard is generally a small hill, or rising ground in the neighbourhood, as unkempt as the surrounding forest, overshadowed by towering trees, and full of an entangled undergrowth of grass, climbers and thorny rotan. On coming to the cemetery, the first thing done is to kill a fowl to propitiate the dread powers of Hades, to whom the ground is supposed to be devoted: and so strong is the need of this sacrifice felt, that no Dyak,\nunenlightened by other principles, will dare touch the ground until it is made. Some now dig the grave; some cook a meal, which is afterwards eaten on the spot; whilst others get a large log of wood of the required length, split it into two, scoop out the inside sufficiently to admit the corpse, and thus make a rude coffin, the two parts of which, after receiving the body, are firmly lashed together with rotan. Sometimes, however, the coffin is made of planks before proceeding to the graveyard.\n\nWith the burial of the body is deposited baiya, that is, things given to the dead. Personal necessaries, like rice, plates, the betel-nut mixture, money and a few other articles are laid with the body in the ground; whilst spears, baskets, swords, weaving materials, pots, jars, gongs, etc., are put on the surface, the jars and gongs being broken to render them useless to any alien who may be inclined to sacrilegious depredations.* This baiya, little or much according to the wealth of the deceased, is regarded as a mark of affection, and to omit it is to fail in a natural duty. But the custom is really founded upon the belief that the things so bestowed are in some mystic way carried into the other world, and useful to the dead\u2014their capital, in fact, to begin life with in the new stage of existence. And in cases where Dyaks are killed, or die by sickness, far away from home, the baiya is still deposited in the family burying-place. A burial without baiya is, in their phrase, the burial of a dog. A fence round the grave as a protection from ravages by wild pigs completes the interment.\n\nThere is a deeply-seated fear amongst Dyaks touching everything connected with death and burial rites. They have for instance, a lurking suspicion that the dead, having become the victims of the most terrible of all powers, may harbour envious feelings, and possibly follow the burying-party back to their homes with some evil intent. To prevent such mischief, some of them will make a notched stick-ladder,\u2020 and fix it upside\n\n* Compare the observances of the Johor Jakuns, No. 7 of this Journal p. 97.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 The tungga samangat of the Johor Jakuns is said \"to enable the spirit to leave the grave when required.\" Id.\u2014Ed.\ndown in the path near the cemetery to stop any departed spirit who may be starting on questionable wanderings; others plant bits of stick to imitate bamboo caltrops to lame their feet should they venture in pursuit, and so obstruct their advance.\n\nInterment is the usual, but not universal, mode of disposing of the dead. *Manangs*, or medicine men, are suspended in trees in the cemetery; * and amongst the Balau tribe, children dying before dentition has developed enjoy the same distinction, having a jar for their coffin. Some eccentric individuals have a dislike to be put underground, and request that after death they may be laid upon an open platform in the cemetery; the result of which is that a most offensive exudation soon oozes from the badly made coffin; and after a year or two the posts become rotten, and the whole structure tumbles down, the coffin bursting in pieces, adding to the already large stock of exposed bones, which, with broken pots, jars, baskets, and other miscellaneous articles, swell the property of grim death, and make the place a vast charnel awesome and gloomy, well calculated to frighten the superstitious Dyak. Occasionally, a man has a fancy to have his body put on the top of a mountain, and the relatives probably dare not refuse to carry out the wish through fear of imaginary evil consequences. Among the Kayans, this burial above ground is the general practice, but they carry it out in a more substantial manner. The *baiya* is put in the coffin, but heads of slain enemies are hung\n\n---\n\n* Even among the Malays of the Peninsula, this practice of keeping the body of a *pawang*, or medicine-man, above ground is not unknown. It exists also probably among the Sakai tribes. *Blian taun* is the Sakai name for the original tiger-spirit or man-tiger. A man who has a tiger-spirit as his familiar is a *pawang blian*, and may not be buried in the ordinary Malay way, but his body must be placed leaning against a *prah* tree, in order that the spirit may enter into another man.\n\nIn Perak, it is said that in the time of Sultan J'AFAR there was a *pawang* of the *hantu blian*, named *Alang Dewasa*. When he died (at Buluh Minyak in Ulu Perak) his relations would not permit his body to be set up against a tree, but buried it. Soon afterwards the ground was found disturbed, and since then Alang Dewasa has frequently appeared as a *hantu blian*, when invoked by *pawangs* of that class (See Journal No. 12, p 224). He comes down in the shape of a tiger, with one eye closed, the effect of an injury he received when buried, or when leaving the earth to assume his animal form.\u2014Ed.\nup round the grave. Great warriors have been sometimes buried for a time and then exhumed, and their relics sacredly kept by their descendants in or near their houses, or it may be, on the spur of a neighbouring hill, with the object of securing the departed ancestor as a tutelary spirit.\n\nSea Dyaks do not consider burial as the last office which they can render to the dead, but follow them up with certain after-ministries of mixed affection and superstition. For three or four evenings after death, they light a fire somewhere outside the house for the use of the departed; for in Hades, they say, fire is not to be procured without paying for it. After burial, the nearest relation lives in strict seclusion and keeps a comparative fast until the observance called pana is made. A plate of rice with other eatables is taken by one of the neighbours to this chief mourner, and from this time he or she returns to the usual diet, and occupations of life. But this neighbourly act to the living is the least part of pana, amongst those tribes, at least where professional wailers exist. It is principally concerned with the dead, to whom by it food is supposed to be sent. Boiled rice and other things usually eaten with it, together with Dyak delicacies, are put together, and thrown through the opening at the back of the house, and the wailer is fetched to effect their transmission to Hades. She comes again to the house of mourning, not to lament over the dead\u2014that is left for the relatives to do\u2014but to call upon the adjutant bird, \"the royal bird which fishes the waters all alone,\" to do her bidding in conveying the articles of the pana to the other world. Among these are included with some pathos the sorrows and sighs of the living.\n\n\"To carry the pana of tears to the departed one\n\"at the clear mouth of the Potatoe river.\n\"To carry deep sighs to those sunk out of view\n\"in the land of the red ripe rambutan\n\"To carry pitying sobs to those who have fallen\n\"unripe in the land of empty fruiting limes.\"\n\nThe bird, says the song, speeds on its way, and after taking a rest on the bacha tree, which bears for flower one dark red bead, arrives in the region of the departed. There\nthey do not recognize the visitant, and inquire where it comes from and why: \"Do you come to look at the widows? We have thirty and one; but only one is handsome. Do you come to seek after maidens? We have thirty and three; but only one is pretty.\" \"No,\" says the bird, \"we have widows and maidens plenty in the land of the living, all beautiful and admired of men.\" \"What is that you have brought with you so securely covered up?\" \"Get a basin, and I will pour the contents of my burden into it.\" The basin is brought and receives the pana, and lo! the eatables and the tears and the sobs of the living mourners have become gold and silver and precious stones wondrously beautiful. But neither the men or the women know what they are; and mutual accusations of ignorance and stupidity are bandied about, and a noisy quarrel is the result. At this juncture, an ancient native of Hades appears, one, that is, who never was an inhabitant of this world;\n\nDara Rabai Gruda*\nDayang Sepang Kapaiya.\n\nShe chides their unseemly squabbling, and explains to them that the bird has come from the realms of the living with presents from their friends; whereupon they are seized with a passionate desire to return, but are told that this is impossible.\n\n\"The notched ladder is top downwards.\nTheir eyes see crookedly.\nTheir feet step the wrong way.\nTheir speech is all upside down.\"\n\nTheir capacities are no longer adapted to the world they have left, and their destiny is irreversible; but still they urge their request to accompany the bird, and all the ingenuity of Hades is called in requisition to devise means of amusing the souls as yet unaccustomed to their new dwelling. Meanwhile, the bird takes its homeward flight. Thus far the wailer.\n\nUntil this pana is made, say the Dyaks who observe it, the soul is not thoroughly conscious that it has departed from the world, and Hades will not give it food or water; but after this, it is received as a regular denizen of deathland.\n\n* Garuda, the eagle of Vishnu? See No. 7 of this Journal, p. 13.\u2014Ed.\nThere is a similar observance called *sumping*, which is carried out at a varying period after death. They take the symbols and trophies of a head-hunting raid, and the wailer is supposed to procure the services of the spirit of the winds to convey them to the dead, whose abode, before full of darkness and discomfort, is now, at sight of the trophies, filled with light; for they have the satisfaction of feeling that their relations have revenged upon others their own death; so henceforth they stand more freely upon their own footing.\n\nThis observance, which, according to ancient custom, could not be performed until the head of an enemy had been obtained, brings out the darker and fiercer side of the Dyak nature. They would fight with death if they could; but as they cannot, they rejoice in taking vengeance upon the living, whenever a chance of killing the enemies of their tribe offers itself; so as to be able to say to themselves: \"My relatives have revenged my death. I am now on equal terms with the evil fate which has sent me hither.\" But in these times, when they live under a strong and civilized government, it is very seldom that this observance can be carried out in its fulness; and therefore it is either slurred over by some mild substitute, or omitted altogether.\n\nBut the great observance for the dead is the *Gawei antu*, Festival of Departed Spirits. No definite period is fixed for the celebration of it, and the time varies from one to three or four years. The preparation for it of food and drink and other things is carried on for weeks and even months; and sometimes it taxes very severely the resources of the Dyak. When all is ready, the whole neighbourhood for miles round is invited to partake of it. It is an opportunity for a general social gathering; it is a formal laying aside of mourning; above all, it is, in their minds, the execution of certain offices necessary for the final well-being of the dead.\n\nBut though it is a feast for the dead to which they are invoked and invited, yet they pretend to guard against any unorthodox and premature approach of the departed as full of uncanny influence. When the *tuak*, a drink brewed from rice, has been made, an earthenware potful of it is hung up before the door of the one room which each family of the\nvillage house occupies, so as to attract the attention of any casual wanderer from Hades. Such a one is supposed to see the pot, and to go and regale himself from it, and be satisfied without going further: and thus his thoughts are pleasantly diverted from the inner seat of family life; the room\u2014where, if permitted to enter, he might possibly, in revengeful spite, carry off some of the living circle.\n\nThe presence of the dead is desired, but only at the proper time and in the proper way. But how are they to come from Hades in the numbers desired? Nothing easier, thinks the Dyak, send a boat for them: So he despatches what is called the lumpang. A piece of bamboo in which some rice has been boiled is made into a tiny boat, which, by the aid of the wailer, who is again fetched, is sent to Hades. Actually, it is thrown away behind the house: spiritually, it is supposed by the incantation of the wailer to be transmitted to the unseen realm through the instrumentality of the king of all the fishes, who accomplishes the journey without much trouble. But in Hades he dare not ascend the great river of the dead beyond the first landing place, where he leaves the mystic craft together with food and drink. No sooner is this done than the stream becomes dammed up and overflows its banks. The curious boat is seen floating upon the swollen waters, but no one knows what it is. At length a water nymph rises out of the river, and tells them that the strange craft, which by this time has grown from the size of a toy to a mighty war-boat, has been sent by their living friends for their passage across the styx to partake of a final banquet. Great is the joy of Hades on discovering this.\n\n\"Their shouts reach beyond the clouds.\n\"They incite each other like men preparing the drums.\n\"With joy they thump their breasts.\n\"With gladness they slap their thighs.\n\"We shall soon feast below the star-sprinkled heavens.\n\"We shall soon eat where the roaring thunder falls.\n\"We shall soon feed below the suspended moon.\n\"We shall soon be on our way to visit the world, and march\n\"to the feast.\"\n\nWith this contrivance, the way is now open for the\ndeparted to visit their old habitations as soon as the feast shall be ready and the final summons sent. Meanwhile preparations for the festival advance. Those tribes who erect ironwood memorial monuments at the graves get them put together. On the day of the feast, or may be the day before, the women weave with finely split bamboo small imitations of various articles of personal and domestic use, which are afterwards hung over the grave, that is, given to the dead. If it be a male for whom the feast is made, a bamboo gun, a shield, a war cap, a sirih bag and drinking vessel, etc. are woven; if a female, a loom, a fish basket, a winnowing fan, sunshade, and other things: if a child, bamboo toys of various descriptions.\n\nThe guests arrive during the day, and the feasting begins in the evening, and lasts all night. An offering of food to the dead is put outside at the entrance of the house. The wailer of course is present, and her office now is to invoke the spirit of the winds to invite the dead to come, and feast once more with the living; and she goes on to describe in song the whole imaginary circumstances\u2014the coming of the dead from Hades, the feasting, and the return. She sings how numerous animals, one after another, and then Sulampandai, maker of men, are called upon to go to Hades, but none have the capacity to undertake such a journey; how the spirit of the winds arrives in Hades, and urges the acceptance of the invitation by expatiating on the abundance and excellence of the food their relations have provided for them; how they and a great company of friends start, and make the journey hither in the boat before sent for them; how glad they are to see our earth and sky again, and to hear the many voices of the busy world; how they eat and drink, dance, and have a cock-fight with their living friends (for they have brought fighting cocks with them); how Hades is beaten (to make it victorious would be a bad omen); how they ask for their final share of the family property, and a division is made, but here again the dead get the worst of it, for in dividing the paddy, the living get the grain, the dead only the chest in which it is kept; so, the jars remain with the living, the stand only on which they are set being given to the dead; the weapons too are retained, whilst the sheaths go to Hades, etc., etc. In the very act of\nprofessing to entertain their friends, they must cheat them for fear of conceding too much to Hades, and so hasten their own departure thither. After this pretended division of property, the children of deathland make their parting salutation with much affection and regret and go on their way. Such is the esoteric meaning of the festival according to the wailer's song.\n\nThe song makes the dead arrive about early dawn; and then occurs an action wherein the intercommunion of the dead and the living is supposed to be brought to a climax. A certain quantity of tuak has been reserved until now in a bamboo, as the peculiar portion of Hades, set apart for a sacred symposium between the dead and the living. It is now drunk by some old man renowned for bravery or riches, or other aged guest who is believed to possess a nature tough enough to encounter the risk of so near a contact with the shades of death. This \"drinking the bamboo,\" as it is called, is an important part of the festival.\n\nEarlier in the night comes the formal putting off of mourning. The nearest male relation is habited in an old waistcloth, or trousers: these are slit through and taken away, and the man assumes a better and finer garment; a bit of hair from each side of the head is cut off and thrown away. In case of female relations, some of the rotan rings which they wear round their waists are cut through and set aside; and they now resume the use of personal ornaments. This action is represented as a last farewell to the dead.\n\nThe morning after the feast, the last duty to the dead is fulfilled. The monument, if any, the bamboo imitation articles, the cast off garments, with food of all kinds are taken and arranged upon the grave. With this final equipment, the dead are said to relinquish all claims upon the living, and to go henceforward on their way, and to depend upon their own resources. But before the Gaweiau is made they are thought to carry on a system of secret depredations upon the eatables and drinkables of the living, in other words, to come for their share. When sitting down to his plate of rice, a Dyak will sometimes be seen to throw a little under the house as a portion for a departed one. And I have been told that in the morning the footprints of the dead are sometimes visible in\nthe paddy stores from which they have been supplying themselves under cover of darkness. They are driven to such little foraging expeditions, it is said, by the necessities of their position; for the powers of Hales look with contempt upon any who go thither insufficiently provisioned, and even quarrel with them. And worse still is said to happen if this feast be omitted altogether: the dead lose their personality, and are dissolved into primitive earth. Hence charity to the dead and motives of economy urge the Dyak to undertake the labour and expense of the Gauei antu, the preparation of which seriously hinders the farmwork, and diminishes the following year's crop of paddy.\n\nAccording to ancient custom, this Feast of the Spirits could not be held until a new human head had been procured, but this ghastly, yet valued, ornament to the festival has now to be generally dispensed with.\n\nThus far I have, in the main, followed Dyak thought about death and the afterstate as it is embodied in their tribal ceremonies and songs; but as might be expected popular thought is not without its ideas and theories; and these supplement what has hitherto been said.\n\nIn the borderland, says the Dyak, between this world and the next, is situated the house of the Bird bubut, a bird here, a spirit there, covering his identity in human form. Every human spirit in the extremity of sickness comes to this place: if it goes up into the house, by the influence of the bird it returns to the body, which thereupon recovers; but if it avoids the house, as is more probable, because it is always in a filthy state of dirt and stench, then it is well on its way to the other world. There is, however, another chance for it at the \"Bridge of Fear,\" a see-saw bridge stretching across the Styx, and difficult to pass over: if the soul makes the passage successfully, it is gone past recovery; if it falls into the water, the cold bath wakes it up to a sense of its real position, and determines it to retrace its steps.\n\nAfter this, it seems, the soul has to pass the \"Hill of Fire.\" Evil souls are compelled to go straight over the hill with scorching fire on every side, which nearly consumes them; but good ones are led by an easy path round the foot, and so\nescape the pain and danger.* This is the only connection in which I have met with anything which suggests the idea of future retribution for wrong doing in this life.\n\nDyaks attribute to the dead a disposition of mixed good and evil towards the living, and so alternately fear and desire any imaginary contact with them. As has been said before, they do not speak of taking a \"corpse\" to the grave, but an antu, a spirit; as though the departed had already become a member of that class of capricious unseen beings which are believed to be inimical to men. They think the dead can rush from their secret habitations, and seize invisibly upon any one passing by the cemetery, which is, therefore, regarded as an awesome, dreaded place. But yet this fear does not obliterate affectionate regard, and many a grave is kept clean and tidy by the loving care of the living; the fear being united with the hope of good, as they fancy the dead may also have the will and the power to help them. I was once present at the death of an old man, when a woman came into the room, and begged him, insensible though he was, to accept a brass finger ring, shouting out to him as she offered it: \"Here, grandfather, take this ring, and in Hades remember 'I am very poor, and send me some paddy medicine that I may get better harvests.'\" Whether the request was granted, I never heard. Sometimes they seek communion with the dead by sleeping at their graves in hope of getting some benefit from them through dreams, or otherwise. A Dyak acquaintance of mine had made a good memorial covering over the grave of his mother of an unusual pattern, and soon fell ill, in consequence, some said, of this ghostly work. So he slept at her grave feeling sure she would help him in his need, but neither voice nor vision nor medicine came; and he was thoroughly disappointed. He said to me: \"I have made a decent resting place for my mother, and now I am ill and ask her assistance, she pays no attention. I think she is very ungrateful.\"\n\n*According to the creed of the Badagas in Tamil India, the souls are obliged to pass by a column of fire which consumes the sinful, and it is only after perils that they reach the land of the blessed by a bridge of rope.\" Peschel, Races of Man, p. 284, quoting Baierlein, Nach und aus Indien.\u2014Ed.\nThis belief in reciprocal good offices between the dead and the living comes out again in those cases where the remains of the dead are reverently preserved by the living. On every festival occasion, they are presented offerings of food, etc., in return for which these honoured dead are expected to confer substantial favours upon their living descendants.\n\nTheir notions of the relationship of this world to the next, and of the dead to the living, will be further illustrated by the story of Kaduwa; which may also be taken as a specimen of their folklore.\n\nKaduwa was a great cock-fighter, but had suffered successive defeats from his fellow Dyaks. Irritated at being beaten in a sport he so dearly loved, he started off to seek a cock of a particular white and red plumage, called biring grunggang, which he believed would bear down all others before it. But a chanticleer of this peculiar plumage was a \"rara avis\" among fowls; and village after village was visited, and neither for love or money could the coveted bird be got, for the simple reason that there were none. Nothing daunted, he started off again to go further afield, and determined not to return till he had succeeded in his quest. He travelled hither and thither in the land of the Dyaks until he knew not where he was, and at length arrived at the land of Mandai idup, the borderland between Hades and this world, the inhabitants of which can visit one or the other as they wish. Here a long village house appeared in sight. He went up the ladder into it; and to his astonishment it showed all the signs of being inhabited, even to the fires burning on the hearth and the sounds of surrounding voices; but not a person could be seen; so he shouted out: \"Ho, where are you all?\" Whereupon an unembodied voice answered: \"Is that you, Kaduwa? Sit down and eat pinang and sirih. What do you want?\" \"I am come to beg or buy a biring grunggang, fighting cock.\" There is not one to be had here, but if you go on to the next village, you will find one.\" So Kaduwa trudged on, greatly wondering at the strangeness of a place peopled by bodiless beings, talking working phantoms of men and women. Soon after, he came to a populous place, where many village-houses were clustered together\u2014Mandai mati,\nthe first district of the land of the dead; but Kadawa knew it not for it had nothing to remind him of death; the people moved about, spoke and had the same form and feature as his own neighbours: moreover they recognized and called him by name. They offered to give him a biring grunggang, which he gladly accepted. Having now obtained his object, he was happy, and finding the people sociable and hospitable, he was in no hurry to return, but remained with his new-found friends more than a year, oblivious of home and its duties.\n\nBut what of his wife and child whom he had left behind in his house? She was grieved at his long absence, and at last resolved that he must be dead and she wept and bewailed him; and at length she died of sorrow.\n\nThe time came when the relations made the Gawe antu for her; and the wailer was bringing the company of guests from Hades to the feast. Just at that time Kadawa had determined upon returning, and was securing his fighting cock and buckling on his sword, when some one called to him to go on the platform in front of the house, and pointed out to him a procession marching along the hill opposite the house. Kadawa looked and saw in the middle of the long train his own wife; and it flashed upon him that his wife was dead and he himself within the confines of deathland. Without speaking a word he caught up his fighting cock, sword and spear and rushed to join his wife. She repelled him, but in vain. At length they came to the stygian lake and found a boat lying on the shore, into which they all hurried, trying to keep Kadawa out; but he vigorously persisted, and was allowed to embark. After paddling several hours the boat struck upon a rock, and would not move: all except Kadawa jumped out to pull her off, but she would not budge an inch. Kadawa was called upon by his wife to help; but he refused for fear of being left behind\u2014says his wife: \"Do you not know I am dead? What is the use of trying to follow me?\" \"Let me die also, I will not leave you.\" \"Very well,\" replied his wife, \"since you are resolved to come with me, when we get to the house, you will find some dried sugar cane over the fire place: eat that, and you will be able to bear me company.\n\"Now get out, and help to pull the boat off the rock.\" He jumped out, and as soon as his feet touched the rock, boat people and lake vanished, and he found himself standing at his own doorstep.\n\nBut no pleasure did his return bring him, for he found his friends making the last farewell feast for his wife. He neither ate nor drank nor shared in the festivities; but kept in his own room till all was over when he thought of the sugar cane over the fireplace. He searched for it, but found nothing more than a roll of poisonous *tuba* root: again and again he looked but nothing else was there; so he concluded that this was what his wife meant by the sugar cane. He spoke sorrowfully to his neighbours and told them he should not live long, and begged them to be kind to his orphan boy and give him his inheritance: then he returned to his room wrapped a blanket round him and laid himself on the floor chewed the fatal root and joined his wife in deathland.\n\nI have thus traced the general belief of the Sarawak Sea Dyak about his future existence. There are however exceptions to it. Occasionally the idea of metempsychosis is met with. At one time the spirit of a man is said to have passed into an alligator; at another into a snake, etc., the knowledge of it being always revealed by dreams. Sometimes a Dyak will deny the possibility of any future existence; but only I think to serve the purpose of an argument. But these, wherever found, are deviations from the general belief.\n\nBut it is no gloomy Tartarus, nor is it any superior happy Elysium to which the Dyak looks forward; but a simple prolongation of the present state of things in a new sphere. The dead are believed to build houses, make paddy farms, and go through all the drudgery of a labouring life, and to be subject to the same inequalities of condition and of fortune as the living are here. And as men helped each other in life, so death, they think, need not cut asunder the bond of mutual interchanges of kindly service; they can assist the dead with food and other necessaries: and the dead can be equally generous in bestowing upon them medicines of magical virtue,\n\n---\n\n*Cocculus indicus.*\u2014Ed.\namulets and talismans of all kinds to help them in the work of life. This sums up the meaning of their eschatological observances which perhaps exceed those of most other races of mankind.\n\nBut this future life does not, in their minds, extend to an immortality. Death is still the inevitable destiny. Some Dyaks say they have to die three times; others seven times; but all agree in the notion, that after having become degenerated by these successive dyings, they become practically annihilated by absorption into air and fog, or by a final dissolution into various jungle plants not recognized by any name. Maybe, they lack the mental capacity to imagine an endless state of liveable life.\n\nJ. PERHAM.\nTHE HISTORY OF PERAK FROM NATIVE SOURCES.\n\nA PAPER under the above title, which was published in No. 9 of this Journal (June, 1882), contains a translation of the later portion of the Perak \"Salsila,\" (chain, genealogy) of the royal family. This ends abruptly with the death of Marhum Muda, which took place about the year 1777. It has been carried on and brought down to 1882 by Raja Haji Yahya, of Belanja, in Perak, whose manuscript I have translated. Ungku Haji's work does not profess to be more than a genealogical record, and is not, like the older book, a historical narrative of events. It has not, therefore, the interest of the latter. It is useful, however, as exhibiting the mode of succession which was customary among the Perak Rajas in former times, and as an authentic source from which to ascertain the relative parity of the descent of the surviving members of the royal line in that State.\n\nFor convenience of reference, the names and titles, wherever they occur, of the Rajas who at any time succeeded to the throne of Perak are printed in small capitals.\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\n\nThis is the genealogy of the Rajas who are in the kingdom of Perak, at present.\n\nMarhum Jalil-ullah* was the grandson of Marhum Kasab of Siak, who was descended from Sang Sapurba of Pagar-Ruyong. Marhum Jalil-ullah married a daughter of Marhum Muda Pahang (by the grand-daughter of Marhum Kota Lama, Sultan of Perak) and had six children\u2014four sons and two daughters. The sons were:\n\n* For an explanation of the term Marhum and the Malay practice of renaming their kings after their decease, see No. 9 of this Journal.

The son received the title of Raja Kechik Bongsu, and the daughter was entitled Raja Kechik Ampuan.\n\nRaja Inu married the daughter of Raja Moqafar, and had one daughter who was named Raja Budak Kasul; he had another daughter, by a woman of the people, whose name was Raja Tengah Bongsu.\nWhen Raja Radin succeeded to the throne, he was proclaimed as Sultan Modafar Shah, and after his death he was known as Marhum Haji.\n\nRaja Bisnu was Raja Muda while Raja Radin was Sultan, and after him, while Raja Inu reigned. There was a civil war while Raja Inu was Sultan, and the Raja Muda, Raja Bisnu, was raised to the throne, and took the title of Sultan Muhammad Shah.* Later, he became Yang di-per-tuan Muda. When he died he was called by the people Marhum Aminullah.\n\nHe had eight children\u2014five sons and three daughters\u2014namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Iskandar,\n2.\u2014Raja Kemas or Salch, } by the same mother.\n3.\u2014Raja Ala-eddin,\n4.\u2014Raja Inu Muda.\n5.\u2014Raja Kechik Bongsu.\n6, 7, 8.\u2014The names of the daughters are not given.\n\nRaja Puteh gave birth to Raja Khalim. Raja Hamid begot four children, namely, one son, named Raja Cholau, and three daughters, names unknown. One of the daughters married Raja Ala-eddin, son of Marhum Aminullah, and another married Raja Senal.\n\nRaja Kemas\u2020 son of Marhum Aminullah, married Raja Kechik Ampuan, daughter of Marhum Sulong Garonggong. Raja Iskandar, who became Raja Muda, married Raja Budak Rasul, daughter of Marhum Haji, and succeeded Marhum Haji on the throne under the title of Sultan Iskandar Zu'lKarnayn. After his death, he was known as Marhum Kahar-ullah.\u2021 One of his sisters was given by him in marriage to Sherif Hassan, son of Toh Tambak (Sherif Jaladin), and one of the daughters of Raja Hamid married Marhum Tengah (Bandahara Raja Inu).\n\nBefore his marriage with the Princess Budak Rasul, Marhum Kahar already had issue by a woman of the lower orders, and\n\n* See No. 9 of this Journal, p. 106.\n\u2020 Kemas = Kei Amas.

This Raja Sherif received the title of Sultan Muda Ala-eddin, and had, by Raja Sabda, two sons and one daughter, namely; Raja Inu and Raja Alang (often called Raja Alang Pulau), sons, and Raja Itam, daughter.\n\nRaja Alang had two children, of whom one was a daughter who has left a numerous posterity, namely, Rajah Ngah Ami-nah. Rajah Itam married a Saiyid from Trengganu of the Arab tribe Beni Yahya; they had two sons, namely, Raja Ngah Daha (Saiyid Hussein) and Raja Alang Hussein, commonly known as Raja Tua.\n\nWhile Marhum Kahar was Raja Muda, Raja Kemas had the title of Raja Kechik Muda, and when the former became Sultan the latter succeeded as Raja Muda. He eventually succeeded to the throne on the death of Marhum Kahar and took the title of Sultan Muhamadin Silai,* establishing himself at Pasir Pulai, to which place he gave the name of Pulau Besar Indra Mulia. It was he who created a Sultan of Selangor\u2020 by installing there Sultan Sala-eddin, the first Yang di-per-tuan, and his descendants. After the death of Sultan Muhamadin Shah, he was called Marhum Muda. By his wife Raja Kechik Ampuan, he had one son, Raja Ibrahim, who took the title of Raja Kechik Muda\u2021 and begot a son named Raja Mahmud.\n\nAt the time that Marhum Kahar was Sultan, Raja Ala-eddin, son of Marhum Aminullah, was Bandahara, and called himself by the title of \"Bandahara Peningat Itam.\"\n\nHere it is necessary to introduce a story. There were two sisters who upon the death of their father and mother were detained by their uncle as pledges for the repayment of a debt of five dollars due to him by their parents. He employ-\n\n* This name is not given in the account printed on p. 107 of No. 9 of this Journal.\n\u2020 See No. 2 of this Journal, p. 191.\n\u2021 According to Perak tradition, this prince was the first Raja Bandahara. Before his time the title of Bandahara had been held by Chiefs not of royal blood. See Journal No. 2, p. 187.\ned the two girls in looking after his farm (ladang). One day an old woman came there and questioned them, and they explained how they were in a position of slavery in consequence of a debt of five dollars. The woman asked their names, and one of them replied: \"I am called Upik and my sister's name is Dewi.\" Then the old woman said: \"Open your mouth;\" she did so and the old woman spat into it * and touched Dewi in the waist. Then she said: \"I am Nenek Kemang,\" \u2020 and she gave them a tuai (an instrument for plucking padi-ears) and instructed them in the art of rice-cultivation and that is the origin of the knowledge of the cultivation, of padi as it is practised in Kampar and Teja up to the present day.\u2021 (In the name of the God who knoweth!) The old woman said moreover: \"Do not be unhappy, it is no longer in the power of anyone to fasten on your skin and bones; your debt is at an end and ye are no longer slaves,\" she then vanished.\n\nWhen the harvest was over and the padi had been taken to the kampong, Raja Bandahara Peningat Itam came up the little river on the bank of which they lived and the people there told him of the exceptional beauty of Che Upik and Che Dewi. He immediately took both of them and they accompanied him down the river. He married Toh Upik, and she bore him a son who was called Raja Abdurrahman.\n\nAfter the death of Marhum Kahar, Raja Kemas became Raja \u00a7; Bandahara Peningat Itam became Raja Muda and Raja Cholan became Bandahara. After the death of Raja Kemas, he was known as Mariium Muda. Raja Muda Aladdin then became Raja under the title of Sultan Aladdin\n\n* This rather objectionable incident, or something like it, occurs in the legend of Badang in the Sajarah Malaya. It is found also in other Perak legends, e.g., that of Toh Kuala Bidor.\n\n\u2020 The legend of Nenek Kemang is ignorantly introduced here as an incident which occurred in the last century. It is an ancient legend which belongs to the pre-Muhammadan times of the Malay nation, and in the folk-lore of Perak Malays the benevolent fairy or goddess is often referred to. Princk Nenek Kemang, \"the cooking-pot of Nenek Kemang\" (the contents of which could never be exhausted), is the \"widow's cruise\" of the Malay peasant.\n\n\u2021 As to the belief in a Ceres entertained by Indo-Chinese nations, see Col.

Raja Bandahara Cholan became Raja Muda, Raja Inu became Bandahara and Raja Kechik Bongsu became Sultan Muda.*\n\nRaja Muda Cholan had three children, namely two daughters by his principal wife (jahara?) and one son by another wife of a lower class (orang ka-luar-an). His daughters were called Raja Long Irang and Raja Chu, and his son was called Raja Kasim. The mother of the latter was Inche Mek Anjong; she was the daughter of the Sri Maharaja Lela, Toh Osman, of Kota Lama.\n\nThe Bandahara, Raja Inu, married a sister of Raja Muda Cholan, whose title was Raja Che Puan Tengah; she bore him two sons and one daughter, namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Abdurrahim, who married Raja Long Irang, the daughter of Raja Muda Cholan.\n2.\u2014Raja Radin, who married Raja Chu, younger sister of Raja Long Irang.\n3.\u2014Raja Itam.\n\nWhen Raja Muda Cholan died, he became known among the people as Marhum Pulau Juwar.\u2020 Raja Kasim was then still very young, and his sister Raja Long Irang brought him up. Raja Long Irang and her husband and child all died about the same time, the latter being quite young. Raja Bandahara Inu died soon afterwards and became known to posterity as Marhum Tengah. Raja Radin then became Bandahara.\n\nWhen Sultan Ala-eddin died, Sultan Muda Raja Kechik Bongsu became Yang-di-per-tuan under the title of Sultan Ahmadin Shah.

The original Perak Salsila only carries the history as far as the previous reign (Journal No. 9, p. 107). All therefore that now follows is new.\n\n\u2020 Raja Cholan (Marhum Pulau Juwer) is famous in Perak as the author of the historical work Misa Malayu, which has been described in No. 2 of this Journal, p. 187, and extracts from which will be found in No. 10, p.p. 258, 263. I take this opportunity of correcting a mistake committed in the papers quoted, where Misal is written for Misa. There is a Javanese romance which has been translated into Malay and is very popular in Perak. It is called Hakayat Misa Perbujaya, or simply Misa Java. Raja Cholan's work has been compared by its admirers to the romance in question and has thus come to be called Misa Malayu.

Che Puteh received the title of Toh Dalam and gave birth to one son whose name was Raja Abdul Mulk. The second was Raja Tengah Bougsa, daughter of Marhum Haji by a woman of low birth. She had one son, Raja Inu. The king's third wife was a woman of Katiar named Inche Sri Nayan, daughter of Toh Imam Malik-al-Amin. (This Imam Malik-al-Amin was one of nine brothers, namely Toh Biji Dewa, Toh Saiah Dusun, Toh Lubok, Toh Bujal, Toh Sarambi\u2014these last two went to Aceh\u2014and three others. They were the sons of an Arab named Saiyid Aji by Toh Dusun binti Mrah Chichik Puteh, an Achinese woman of royal blood). The king had one son by Che Sri Nayan, whom he called Raja Abdurrahman. His fourth wife was a woman of Sungkei named Toh Nah binti Toh Samban. She bore him one daughter named Raja Andak. He had one other wife, a woman of Sungei Siput, Che Sinuh by name, who had one daughter, Raja Mandak.\n\nRaja Abdul Mulk married Raja Itam binti Marhum Tengah and had by her two sons and three daughters. The sons were Raja Abdullah and Raja Ahmad, and the daughters were Raja Che Puan Besar (Raja Aminah), Raja Che Puan Saraja, and Raja Che Puan Busu.\n\nRaja Inu married Raja Tengah Irang, a daughter of Marhum Tengah by a woman of Labu Kubong Lamih.

Raja Kechik Besar, Abdul Mulk, his son, then became Raja under the title of Sultan Mansur Shah, and Raja Abdullah, his son, became Raja Muda. The Bandahara, Raja Mahmud, also died. Raja Ngah Laut married Raja Aminah, and became Bandahara. Raja Abdurrahman received the title of Raja Kechik Besar and when he died at Kampong Mangkasar, people spoke of him as Marhum Kampong. Raja Kechik Besar married Che Limah, the sister of Toh Ludin, a native of Kuala Prai, daughter of Wan Bentan, who was the son of Tumonggong Pak Ujan, who first opened Kuala Prai.* Raja Kechik Besar and his wife Che Limah had one son, Raja Abdullah. He married Raja Ngah Aminah, the daughter of Raja Alang and grand-daughter of Sultan Muda Aladdin (Raja Sherif Bisnu), and Raja Cholan, the son of Raja Inu, married Raja Mandak, daughter of Marhum Sayong, and had one son, Raja Mahmud, who died young.

He had another wife also, a woman of the lower class named Alang Milu, alias Ken Uda, by whom he had three sons:\n\n1. \u2014Raja Kulup Muhammad Kramat.\n2. \u2014Raja Idris.\n3. \u2014Raja Lop Ahamad.\n\nRaja Bandahara Alang Iskandar died at Kuala Teja, and has ever since been known by the people as Marhum Kuala Teja.\n\nSultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah by his wife Raja Perumpuan Ngah Aminah had three sons and one daughter, namely:\n\n1. \u2014Raja Ngah Yusuf, (the present Regent).\n2. \u2014Raja Pandak.\n3. \u2014Raja Suleiman.\n4. \u2014A daughter born after her father came to the throne, whose name was Raja Mandak and whose title was Raja Budak Rasul (anak banya*).\n\nRaja Ismail Hitam, son of Raja Mandak, and grandson of Marhum Bonosu, married Raja Fatimah, daughter of Raja Kechik Besar Daud by his wife Long Halimah; and Raja Ngah Ali, son of Marhum Safi-ullah, was a close friend and ally of this Raja Ismail, for the latter had been adopted by Marhum Safi-ullah and his wife in their lifetime. When this Raja Ngah Ali lost his wife Raja Puteh, daughter of Raja Kechik Tengah, he married the daughter of Raja Kechik Sulong Idris; her name was Raja Puteh Zeleha. They had two sons:\n\n1. \u2014Raja Osman.\n2. \u2014Raja Omar.\n\nBefore they reached manhood, Raja Ngah Ali divorced (ber-cherei hidap) Puteh Zeleha.\n\n* Anak banya or anak sabei is the name given in Perak to a child of a Sultan borne after his accession.\nRaja Ismail Hitam, by his wife Raja Fatimah, had two children, the elder of whom was a daughter, Raja Long Khadijah, and the second a son named Raja Lop Ahamad.\n\nWhen Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah died, Raja Muda Ngah J'Affar became Yang-di-per-tuan and took the title of Sultan J'Affar Ma'adam Shah. Raja Ali became Raja Muda and Raja Ismail became Raja Bandahara.\n\nSultan J'Affar and his wife Raja Kechik Puan Besar had one daughter named Raja Long. Her mother died before Raja J'Affar succeeded to the throne and was known after her death by the title of Sha'alam Telok Kapayang Mangkat di Pangkalan Tengah. The Sultan had, by another wife (Che Bulan), a daughter named Raja Ngah, and, by another wife (Che Mahat), a daughter named Raja Nandak and a son named Raja Abdullah. This Raja Abdullah was born on the night of Nasf Sha'aban, and it is said that on that night the water of the well Zem-zem bubbled up and overflowed. Further, a pious Menangkabau man, still living, named Haji Muhammad Ali (who is married to Che Fatimah of Bandar and is known as Tuan Besar Kramat) when he saw the new-born infant, said at the time: \"This child is supernaturally gifted (ber-luah); take the greatest care of him.\"\n\nRaja Long, the Sultan's daughter, married Raja Kechik, the son of a Raja from Riau, and his second daughter, Raja Ngah, married Daing Perbu, the son of a Bugis Raja who was the son of Kraing Chandrapoli, son of the Raja of Bernih (Brunei): and his third daughter, Raja Nandak, married Raja Pandak, son of Marium Atik-ullah Mangkat di Durian Sabatang, (Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah).\n\nRaja Abdullah, the son of Sultan J'Affar married Raja Tipah, half sister of Raja Muda Ngah Ali on the mother's side.\n\nSultan J'Affar married another wife called Che Alang Amas, who bore him a son called Raja Musah.\n\nRaja Long had three sons by her husband Raja Kechik of Riau, namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Mahmud, who is now at Riau and who has been to Meccah.\n2.\u2014Raja Ngah J'afar, who lives at Kampar at Kampong Changkat.\n\n3.\u2014Raja (hiatus in M. S.), also at Kampar at the present time.\n\nRaja Ngah bore her husband, Daing Perbu, a daughter named Raja Endah, who married Raja Ngah J'afar the son of Raja Long.\n\nRaja Nandak and her husband Raja Pandak had three sons:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Ibrahim.\n2.\u2014Raja Ali.\n3.\u2014Raja Alang.\n\nRaja Pandak had been previously married, before he married Raja Nandak, to a woman of the lower class named Che Long, daughter of Teh Marat of Pulau Tiga, and by her he had one son named Raja Mahmud.\n\nAfter Sultan J'afar died, he was always spoken of by the title of Marhum Oulia-ullah di Pasir Panjang. Raja Muda Ngah Ali then ascended the throne, and his title while Sultan was \"Al ma'tukkal billah il jali Paduka Sri Sultan al mukmel 'Anayat Shah el Perak dar el riduan.\"*\n\nRaja Abdullah, son of the late Sultan, became Raja Muda, the Bandahara, Raja Ismail Hitam, retained that office, and it was by his wish and consent that Raja Abdullah was made Raja Muda.\n\nRaja Osman, son of the new Sultan, married Raja Long Khadijah, daughter of Raja Bandahara Ismail, and had no issue.\n\nAfter the Sultan (Ali) had reigned for a time, he died at Kuala Manora at the house of Che Rajab, and was buried at Gedong Siam at Sayong. The title given to him after his death was Marhum Naji-ullah.\n\nAt this time, Raja Abdullah was down the river and though he was sent for repeatedly he did not come.\u2020 There was then a\n\n* \"He who places all his confidence in the just God, Paduka Sri Sultan el mukmel 'Anayat Shah of Perak, the abode of Paradise.\"\n\n\u2020 The custom quoted by the Perak Chiefs in explanation of their action in passing over the Raja Muda (see Blue-Book C. 1111, p. 118) is common to several Indo-Chinese nations, e.g. the Siamese, Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 344, and the Cambodians, Meura, Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 347. In Timor the body of a deceased king remains unburied till the relatives can afford to provide the burial feast.

Not long after this, Raja Muda Abdullah came to an agreement with the Chiefs down the river, at the head of whom was the Laksamana Muhammad Amin, that he should be recognised as Sultan under the title of \"El 'ashik billah\u2020 Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah, Yang-di-per-Tuan, Perak,\" and he at once went to Singapore where Governor Ord was then stationed as the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Soon after he returned to Perak, there was a change of Governors and Sir Andrew Clarke became Governor and after reaching Singapore came on to Pangkor, where he confirmed Sultan Abdullah as Yang-di-per-Tuan of Perak, Sultan Ismail becoming Ex-Sultan, that is to say, Sultan Muda. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. J. W. Birch was then appointed Resident of Perak. Again there was a change of Governors in Singapore, and Sir William Jervois became Governor. Then the death of Mr. Birch at Pasir Salak took place, and the Sultan (Ismail) retired from Pangkalan Peguh. Then Captain Dunlop and Major McNair became Queen's Commissioners in Perak and afterwards Mr. Davidson became Resident. After this, Sultan Abdullah and the Laksamana and the Shabandar were taken away to Singapore and thence to Pulau Seychelles. Then Mr. Hugh Low became Resident of Perak and Mr. Maxwell became Assistant Resident and governed Larut. Raja Muda Yusuf became Regent of Perak, and Raja Idris, son of Marhum Bandahara Iskandar, became Hakim of Perak.\n\nRaja Muda Yusuf, Regent of Perak, begot two children, a daughter named Raja Nutih, and a son, Raja Ilop Mansur. He had another son, by a concubine, Raja Muhammad Ajam; and another son, by a woman called Zenab (to whom he was never married), who was named Raja Pendawa. By a woman named Alang Malaka (whom he married) he has a son named Raja\n\n* \"The covering of the protecting mantle of God.\"\n\u2020 \"The friend of God.\"\nJohar. Thus, at the date at which this record is drawn up the children of the Regent are five in number, but judging from his robustness, it is possible that he may still beget more.\n\nThe mother of Raja Nutih and Raja Mansur (the Regent's elder children) was Toh Puan Fatimah, the daughter of Raja Indra Bongsu by Toh Mandu who held the office of bantara to Marhum Durian Sabatang, father of the Regent. Raja Nutih married Raja Idris, the Hakim, and they have one son, Raja Abdul Jalil, or Yup. By another woman, Ngah Manib, Raja Idris has two sons, Raja Abdul Hamid and Raja Alang Iskandar and one daughter Raja Ngah.\n\nRaja Mansur, younger brother of Raja Nutih, married Raja Long, daughter of Raja Alang Mamat, and had a son named Raja Abdul Majid.\n\nRaja Muhammad Ajam, son of the Regent, married Khatijah, a woman of Kota Lama, and had one daughter named Raja Long.\n\nUngku Muda Raja Ismail Puteh, or, as he was generally called in his old age, Toh Ungku Ismail Puteh, married another wife, Raja Alang Sabda, daughter of Raja Hussein, elder brother of Sultan Ismail.

Raja Yahya Kechik lived at Sungei Limau, and having performed the pilgrimage to Meccah, was nicknamed Raja Haji.*\n\nRaja Haji and Raja Fatimah, at the time when this is written have three sons and three daughters:\n\n1. \u2014 Raja Puteh Khadijah.\n2. \u2014 Raja Kulup Abdurrahman.\n3. \u2014 Raja Latifah.\n4. \u2014 Raja Muhammad Ali Khatih.\n5. \u2014 Raja Ngah Zohara Mahira.\n6. \u2014 Pachi Raja Abdul Hamid.\n\n* The author of this paper.\nRaja Haji married another wife, Teh Misum Selebuh, but divorced her without issue.

All the property which Raja Ismail and Raja Puteh acquired, subsequent to the time of the marriage of Raja Ismail Itam with Raja Teh Fatimah\u2014lands, houses, mines, slaves, elephants and buffaloes, they made over to Raja Haji Yahya while he was still quite young and they are his to this day.\n\nThe end.\n\nWritten on Wednesday, the 7th day of Jamad-ul-akhir, A. H. 1299, at Kampong Belanja.\nBRITISH NORTH BORNEO.*\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe object of this paper is to give a short and general sketch of the territory under the Government of British North Borneo Company, from personal observations made during a residence of nearly three years in the country, and from the official reports of Messrs. Pryer, Von Donop, Frank Hatton and Wittl.\n\nArea.\n\nEmbracing an area of some 20,000 square miles, and a coast line of about 500 miles, the territory lies between the 116th and 119th degrees of East longitude, and the 4th and 7th parallels of North latitude.\n\nGeographical Features.\n\nThe general geographical features of the country are as follows:\u2014A range of mountains\u2014the general direction of which is North-East and South-West\u2014forms a backbone through the heart of the country, varying in height from 4,000, 7,000 and 8,000 feet in the mountains of Melaio, Mentapok and Trodan, respectively, until the altitude of 13,698 feet is attained by the rugged peaks of Kina Balu, which tower above the surrounding country, repelling with precipitous ascent the adventurer who would attain their summits. From this range and descending to the coast on either side, are lesser ranges of\n\n* See a paper, with this title, by Sir Walter Medhurst, read at a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute this year.\u2014Ed.\nhills covered for the most part with virgin forest, and interspersed with fertile plains, watered by the numerous rivers which wend their circuitous courses to the sea beyond. The coast, as a rule, is low and flat and is, to a large extent, lined with the handsome casuarina tree, broken by stretches of mangrove, denoting swampy ground or the mouths of rivers, and diversified by low sandstone cliffs, yellow from exposure to the weather, or patches of forest reaching to the water's edge.\n\nAt a short distance from the shore on the West coast, a very large area of country is denuded of trees, and lalang, a coarse grass (*Andropogon caricosum*), has spread over it, except where here and there the plantations of the natives vary its monotony.\n\n**Harbours.**\n\nMany indentations occur on the coast, and the country is particularly rich in harbours, the principal being Gaya, Ambong and Usikan on the West coast, Kudat on the North, and Sandakan on the East. The importance of these harbours it needs but a glance at the map to realize, containing as they do, amongst other advantages, natural facilities for defence.\n\n**Sandakan.**\n\nSandakan harbour it will be seen, lies but a short distance from the track taken by trading vessels between Australia and China, and is indeed but five hours steaming distance from their course. It is extremely well protected, and contains anchorage for any number of vessels; having an extent of fifteen miles in length, by five miles in breadth.\n\n**Kudat and Gaya.**\n\nKudat and Gaya harbours are within a few hours steam of the route, through the Palawan passage, taken by ships trading from the West to China and Japan. The value of these harbours, therefore, as coaling stations, and refuges for our mercantile navy, in the event of a war with a naval power,\ncannot be overrated, and it follows, that it is of the highest importance that they should not be in the hands of any foreign and possibly hostile power.\n\nThe value of these harbours, in addition to their strategical importance, is enhanced by the rich country lying at their back. This is especially the case with regard to Sandakan, into which flow some fifteen rivers, taking their courses, for the most part, through a country which is without doubt a field for large sugar and tobacco plantations, and containing a supply of timber which, from its easy access, should be a great source of revenue to the Government.\n\nRivers.\n\nThe principal rivers in the territory are the Kinanis, Papar, Putatan, Abai, and Tampasuk, on the West Coast, Paitan and Sugut on the North, and Sibuco and Kinabatangan on the East. Most of these rivers are navigable for steam launches of light draught, for although, as a rule, deep water is found inside the entrance, all the rivers are more or less barred. The Kinabatangan is navigable for some 200 miles. Rising in the ranges south of Kina Balu, it takes its course to the sea, emerging some twenty miles south of Sandakan harbour, after passing through a very thinly populated country covered for the most part with virgin forest, varied by occasional native plantations, or patches of secondary jungle denoting where former clearings have been. The quantity of floating timber met with, in the rivers, renders careful navigation necessary.\n\nNorth Borneo as a field for the Planter.\n\nNorth Borneo as a new field for the crowded-out planters of Ceylon and Sumatra, is not to be surpassed, for in its hills and valleys will be found soil suitable to almost every tropical product. Harpion, in the New Ceylon writes as follows, and his remarks are confirmed by experts from personal observations:\u2014\n\n\"The spurs and slopes of Kina Balu are peculiarly fitted for growing coffee, tea and cinchona, while the rich plains that\n\"mark the course of the Kinabatangan and other rivers lend\nthemselves to the culture of indigo, tobacco, cotton, rice and\nthe other well-known tropical products. Such villages as the\ntraveller meets with on excursions in the interior, are fed and\nmaintained by agriculture, the successful features of which,\nbelong to the natural fertility of the soil, rather than to the\nscience of the native farmer. . . . You cross a plain of rice,\nbananas, cocoa-nut trees and other luxuriant vegetation. You\nsee the native cultivator at work, his rude plough drawn by\nbuffaloes, and flocks of white paddy birds sailing aloft, or a\nfew solitary cranes adding an oriental touch to the picture.\nYou halt on the river bank amidst tropical groves, here and\nthere relieved by neatly kept gardens, fenced down to the\nwater's edge, and containing plentiful supplies of sweet pota-\ntoes, cucumbers, maize and kaladi.\"\n\nTobacco.\n\nThat the country is peculiarly adapted for the growth of\ntobacco, is demonstrated by the fact of its cultivation by the\nnatives of both coasts, and that in spite of the want of care in\nits production, an excellent leaf is obtained. A sample of leaf\nfrom a newly opened plantation on the East Coast, has been\npronounced by experts to be unsurpassed. Such being the case,\nand considering that the available land in the tobacco producing\ncountries is becoming exhausted, it is reasonable to suppose that\nthis country will, in a short time, take a prominent place as a\nlarge producer of tobacco.\n\nSugar.\n\nSugar is also cultivated to some extent and in some parts\nof the country; a primitive mill for crushing is used by the\nnatives. Considering, however, the small profit returned,\ntogether with the known risks in cultivation, the substitutes for\ncane which are being brought into the market, and the com-\nparatively low rate at which labour is obtained in the sugar\nproducing countries, it is doubtful whether this product will be\ncultivated to any large extent.\nGambier.\n\nGambier (the inspissated juice of *Nauuclea gambir*, an astringent used in dying and tanning), the cultivation of which has met with such success in the neighbouring state of Sarawak, pepper, tea and *coffee arabica*, have all been proved suitable, and sago which is indigenous to the country would largely repay for planting in the low lying grounds at the entrances to rivers.\n\nJungle Products.\n\nEspecially is this country rich in natural jungle products, such as gutta percha, india rubber, camphor, canes, and an infinite variety of useful and ornamental woods, including the valuable *bilian* (iron-wood) and ebony.\n\nCamphor\n\nThe camphor of Borneo, (*Dryobalanops camphora*) is noted for its peculiar medicinal properties, and is highly valued by the Chinese, who will give, according to the variation of the market, from twenty to forty dollars a pound for the best.\n\nBorneo, with its natural advantages in waterways, should export its timber largely to China, and no doubt when labour becomes more abundant, this will be the case.\n\nFirewood.\n\nA market for firewood has been already established in Hongkong, and the supply of mangrove which is unequalled for this purpose, is practically inexhaustible, and can be obtained without any difficulty. The bark of this tree, which has to be removed in its preparation as firewood, has its own special value as producing a reddish dye much used by the Chinese.\n\nEdible Birds' Nests.\n\nAnother valuable and increasing product is the edible\nbirds\u2019-nest, which is obtained in small quantities on the West coast, and adjacent islands, but is chiefly supplied from the Gomanton caves on the East coast. The following description of these caves is condensed from an account lately published in the Straits Times. The caves are situate on the Kinabatangan river, near the village of Malapi, which is some fifty miles from the mouth. The chief entrance Simud putih (white entrance) is on the Gomanton hill at an elevation of 500 feet, and is about 30 feet high by 50 feet wide. The ascent to it is very steep, in some parts almost perpendicular, but the nature of the jagged hard lime-stone rocks, affords holding points for one\u2019s hands and feet. From this entrance the ascent to the summit of the hill, is another 500 feet, and at the top is a smallish hole which leads into the great Simud putih caves below, going straight down about 850 feet. Down this the natives descend by rattan ladders, fastened to the circumference of the hole, right into the abyss below, in search of the nests. At nightfall a remarkable sight is to be seen at the entrance, viz., the return of the swallows (Collocalia esculenta) to their nests, and the departure of the bats. With a whirring sound, multitudes of bats wheel round in spiral columns from the summit of which detachments break off and wheel away rapidly towards the mangrove swamps and the nipa palms. Amongst them the white bats are very conspicuous, and are termed by the natives, the Rajah, his wife and child. Soon after the bats emerge from the caves, the swallows return in countless numbers. Each morning the process is reversed, the swallows going out and the bats returning home. On entering the mouth of the cave as described above, the floor for the first part of the way slopes down at an angle of twenty-five degrees, to an enormous cave with several smaller ones leading out of it. From the side of this cave rises a high dome, from the top of which you can see the opening before-mentioned, some 850 above. The average height of the cave before coming to the dome is 150 feet. The next cave Simud itam (black entrance) is on a level with the river bank. The entrance is by a magnificent porch of 250 feet in height, opening out into a large and lofty chamber, beyond which an open space is reached, from which looking up can be seen the Simud putih.\nFrom this space is a cave running under the Sgmud Purih series which is filled, halfway to the top with bats' guano, which cannot be less than fifty feet in depth. Its extent is unknown. Samples of the guano have been sent home and were valued at from \u00a38 to \u00a315 per ton. The annual value taken from these caves is $25,000.\n\nCoal.\n\nThat coal is present in many parts of the territory, has been proved, and boring for workable deposits, is being actively engaged in. The present supply, which is stored at the principal ports of call, for the use of men-of-war and trading vessels, is obtained from the Moara mines, situate at the mouth of the Brunei River and which have been leased by the Sultan of Brunei to the Labuan firm of Messrs. Cowie Brothers. The quality of the coal has been well reported upon by engineers of Her Majesty's ships and others, and it is used to a large extent by those vessels visiting Borneo and Labuan, as well as by all the local trading steamers. There are five seams now being worked, of 26, 24, 6, 5 and 4 feet in thickness respectively.\n\nMinerals.\n\nFrom the reports of travellers and others, the mineral wealth of Borneo has been much exaggerated, although the numerous indications are sufficient to have caused them. Gold indeed is found in Dutch Borneo and Sarawak, but in comparatively small quantities. Traces of gold have also been found in North Borneo, and the island of Banguey off the North coast, and samples of auriferous quartz have lately been discovered in the vicinity of Marudu Bay and in rivers flowing into Sandakan Bay. Up to the present, however, the search has been unsuccessful, and this is not to be wondered at, when we consider how everything is hidden by a luxuriant vegetation which jealously guards the treasures of the earth from the eyes of the explorer. Samples of cinnabar, silver ore, antimony and tin have been found in different parts of the territory. Copper also was being traced by the late Mr. Frank Hatton, the Company's mineralogist, who was confident of its existence.\nbut his lamented and sad death has temporarily put a stop to the search for it. The same formations in which the silver ore and antimony are found in Sarawak, are also met with in parts of North Borneo, and from specimens which have been brought in by the natives, it is reasonable to suppose that a systematic search would disclose workable deposits.\n\n**Mother-o'pearl.**\n\nThe sea also has treasures which form no small item of export, such as mother-o'pearl, b\u00eache-de-mer (*holothuria,* ) and tortoise shell. The neighbouring oyster beds in the Sulu sea have lately been attracting the attention of Europeans, with a view to the introduction of proper appliances for the effective working of the beds, which is impossible with the primitive means employed by the natives. There is no doubt that as the European government becomes known and appreciated, the pearl oyster beds, which unquestionably exist round the coasts, will be made to yield their riches. The grasping natures of the innumerable petty chiefs of a former r\u00e9gime, who oppressed the unfortunate pearl fishers, until their occupation\u2014arduous and dangerous as it was\u2014brought them no profit, is the cause assigned by the old men for the abandonment of the pursuit, and the consequent losing sight of the exact locality of the beds. On one occasion, whilst searching for an oyster bed in a locality pointed out by an old man living on one of the small islands off the coast, the divers who accompanied the writer, obtained over a hundredweight of mother-o'pearl, valued at $45, but all the shells were isolated, and it was evident that only the outlying members of the true bed had been found.\n\n**Fauna.**\n\nBeasts of prey are conspicuous by their absence, the one known exception being a small tree tiger (*Felis macrocelis*) which is found in the interior. Deer of various kinds, wild pigs, wild cattle (*Bos gaurus*), and buffalo, are abundant, and\nafford capital sport, whilst on the East coast are found in addition the elephant and rhinoceros (*R. sumatranus*). Journeying up the rivers, many varieties of the monkey tribe are met with, including a small species of orang-utan. Small black bears (*Helarctos euryspilus*) are occasionally met with.* The tapir and other have been seen on the North coast. A large variety of squirrels abound. Amongst the snakes are found the cobra, python, and leaf snake (*Trimeresurus subannulatus*), but the writer has not known a single fatal case of snake-bite during a residence of six years in Borneo.\n\nCrocodiles are numerous, and at times extremely fierce and dangerous. The rivers and coast teem with fish, which form the staple food of a large portion of the inhabitants.\n\nPigeons of many kinds, snipe, curlew and plover, the Argus and Bulwer pheasants (*Argusianus Grayii* and *Lobiophasis Bulweri*; \u2020) and several kinds of partridge afford a tempting variety to the sportsman, and the field opened up to the naturalist amongst the numerous birds of North Borneo, is a large and but little known one.\n\n**Climate.**\n\nThe climate is more healthy than might be expected in a country situated so near the Equator. The maximum monthly mean temperature during the year 1883 was 83.9, whilst the lowest for the same period was 75.1. The nights as a rule are very cool and pleasant, and on the coast the heat during the day is rarely oppressive. The rainfall for 1883, as observed at Kudat, on the North coast, was 120.56 inches, November, December and January being the months during which most rain fell. There is no absolutely dry season, it being rare to pass many days without rain. To Europeans who take reasonable precautions against exposure to malarial influences, the climate is healthy.\n\n---\n\n* Sir Stamford Raffles described the Malayan bear before the Linnean Society in 1829. Crawfurd says that the Bornean and Sumatran bears are the same species.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 This is an error. The Bulwer Pheasant (*Lobiophasis Bulweri*) has not come under the knowledge of the author. The birds referred to are two species of the Fireback Pheasant, the *Euplocanus pyrrhopterus* and the *Euplocanus nobilis*.\nPopulation.\n\nNorth Borneo is very thinly populated and its scattered inhabitants include many different races.\n\nThe West coast is principally peopled by a mixture of Malays, Bajaus and Ibanuns, whilst on the North and East coasts Bajaus and Sulus are chiefly met with. The aborigines who reside in the interior are called Dusuns or Ida'an. They are an agricultural race, and generally peaceful. They grow tobacco and cotton, as well as rice, tapioca, yams and indian corn, but only cultivate sufficient for their own immediate use\u2014the usual habit of most natives of these parts, who fail to realize the importance of providing for the future. They use a plough and harrow, and in this respect are superior to the other natives of Borneo, although the use of these implements is said to have been introduced by the Chinese who\u2014report tells us\u2014at some remote period thickly populated North Borneo.\n\nLabour.\n\nFor purposes of labour, the native cannot be depended upon, being naturally indolent and quite content so long as his own immediate wants are satisfied, and these being simple, he finds no difficulty in supplying them. Chinese at present supply the labour market. Chinese, natives of India, and Arabs are to be found trading in most of the rivers, and the first named are settling in large numbers wherever stations have been opened by the Company, more especially at Sandakan, which now contains some 3,000.\n\nA rough estimate of the population gives the number as 150,000, but this is probably underrated, as it is being rapidly increased by the influx of Chinese. The value of the Chinese in a new country like this, is well known, and as a pioneer, his assistance in making the Government known to the natives of the interior, amongst whom he intrepidly ventures, alone or with but one or two companions, speaking imperfectly if at all their language, will be readily acknowledged by those who have experienced it.\nSlavery.\n\nOne great benefit which will follow on the establishment of a Government by Europeans, will be the gradual abolition of slavery, which, however mild it may be in this country, is repugnant to civilised humanity. By recent laws promulgated by the Government, the death blow to the various modes of obtaining slaves has been struck, the following regulations effectually accomplishing this object:\u2014(1.) No slaves can be imported from other countries. (2.) Debtors cannot be seized by their creditors, which was formerly one of the principal means of obtaining slaves. (3) All children born of slave parents after November, 1883, and who would, according to custom, be slaves also, are declared free.\n\nMost of the inhabitants of the coast are Mahomedans, whilst the aborigines put their faith in omens and old superstitions.\n\nFuture Prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment in colonization now being tried by the British North Borneo Company, is one of more than local importance, and is being anxiously watched by other nations whose interests in those seas are so great.\n\nWith the example of what has been done in the Native States, and Sarawak, and by governing through and with the assistance of the natives themselves\u2014which is indeed the only true way in a country such as this\u2014the young colony should, within a reasonable time, realize the expectations it has aroused, by taking a position corresponding to its natural advantages, and sending forth its riches to the other countries of the world.*\n\nE.

Dent when Sir Walter Medhurst's paper on British North Borneo was read before the Royal Colonial Institute on the 12th May, 1885:\u2014\u201cThe progress in North Borneo has not been so rapid as was anticipated when we obtained the charter at the end of 1881, but still we can certainly point to steady progress since the company took possession in July, 1882. I find that the fiscal revenue for 1884 as compared with 1883 shows an increase of 60 per cent., land sales a decrease of 39 per cent., leaving a total increase of 28 per cent., which, considering the state of trade and universal depression, must, I think be thought not wholly unsatisfactory. Sir Walter has alluded to several new imports and exports. We hope in 1885 to show an export of gold. Last autumn we sent one of our best officers to explore for gold in the Segama and Kinabatangan rivers, and his report showed gold to exist in alluvial deposits in the 30 or 40 places experimented upon. He could not continue his explorations, owing to the wet season having just set in, but has recently gone back, and we hope soon to hear it confirmed that there are workable deposits of gold in the country. That the Governor and officials of North Borneo believe in it is evidenced by their having taken the trouble to publish regulations and proclaim certain districts as gold fields. Tobacco we look forward to as likely to prove an important enterprise in the country. This, as the paper says, is advancing but slowly, for, owing to many difficulties which occur in a new country, the 1884 crop did not come up to expectations. Considerable preparations have, however, been made for planting during the coming season. In February last one company had 330 coolies working on their plantation, and another company 100 coolies. From all accounts, this tobacco is likely to prove equal to the finest Sumatra. It is used for covering purposes. In sugar little has been done as yet, but large tracts of country have been taken by Australians, Chinese, and others. There seems to be a fair prospect that the depression in this trade will soon pass away, for prices have recently advanced 30 per cent. There is some reason to believe that the German Government are getting tired of the system of bounties, for I believe it is a fact that the sugar manufacturers and growers of beetroot in Germany owe the Government something like ten millions sterling, and the authorities are beginning to wonder whether they will ever see their money again. As regards timber, our export for 1884 amounted to $10,000. Part went to Australia and part of China. There is a great variety of timber in Borneo, some of the hardest woods in the world being found there. The Billian, or iron wood, is plentiful, and valuable for railway sleepers, wharves, &c.; and some other woods are suited for furniture, ship-building, and other purposes. One of the Chinese merchants has 200 men cutting timber for the China market, and the Australians are cutting timber freely for the Melbourne market. The report upon the experimental garden at Silam states that Liberian coffee, now rising to its third year, is very fine, and yielding freely. The younger plantations at Sandakan promise well. The growth of pepper is all that could be desired. Cocoa, Manila hemp, and gambier are, amongst other articles, easily produced in the territory. One of the main questions remaining for consideration is that of labour. Everywhere the question seems to be how, and where, to get labour. Many restrictions are, we know, put upon the importing of Chinese into America and Australia,\nbut those who have lived as long as I have amongst the Chinese will testify to their value if they are treated properly. One advantage with this labour is that you can make contracts, and payment by results, by which means you can get the maximum amount of labour at the minimum of expense. Borneo is but a few days' steam from China and Singapore, where, for a moderate wage, an unlimited amount of this labour can be obtained. Anyone who has studied the map will, I think, recognise that, commercially and strategically, North Borneo occupies a position of great importance. Lying on the high road between China and Australia, we must in time get a large population there. The climate I can speak well of. I have lived there many months at different times of the year. The Government of the country is based, as Sir Walter has told us, on the Indian penal code, and the administration seems to meet the wishes of the natives and the Chinese, and the other settlers. A force of 180 police has hitherto been sufficient to keep order with comparative ease. As to the charter, some friends of the enterprise seem to believe that the enormous powers we hold were given by Her Majesty the Queen. It is not so at all. All our powers were derived entirely from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and what the British Government did was simply to incorporate us by Royal charter, thus recognising our powers, which recognition is to us, of course, of vital importance. I hope I have said enough to interest you in our scheme, and to show that North Borneo has a considerable future before it.\"\n\nEd.\nJELEBU.\n\nThe following Notes, regarding the history of the constitution of Jelebu have been compiled from information gleaned from the headmen of the State.*\n\nThe four following countries\u2014(1) Jelebu, (2) Sungei Ujong, (3) Rembau, and (4) Johol\u2014were in former days governed by Penghulus subject to the suzerainty of Johor.\n\nOn one occasion the Raja of Johor was guilty of an act of gross oppression towards the Penghulu of Rembau entitled Orang Kaya Kechil. The Raja of Johor wished to obtain in marriage this Penghulu\u2019s daughter, but the Penghulu refused and married her to another. The Raja\u2019s anger was roused at this, and the Penghulu, hearing of his indignation sent his own son Si\u00e2mat (sic) to explain matters to the Raja and to endeavour to appease his wrath.\n\nThe Raja, however, would not listen to Si\u00e2mat, but ordered him to be put to death.\n\nAfter this the Penghulus of the four States were afraid to go to the Court of the Raja, owing to this unjust act.\n\nAfter some time, however, the headman of Jelebu took courage to appear before him. Now this headman\u2019s name was Munyong Salih, and his title was Orang Kaya of Sungei Lumut. The name of Jelebu was as yet unknown; and it was not until some time later that the country was so called after a man of that name who was drowned in the river (Triang). This headman of Jelebu, then, went to the Court of the Raja of Johor, who presented him with a chop bearing the following inscription:\n\n\"The Sultan Ma\u2019adam Shah confers upon the Mandelika Mantri supreme authority to be the Sultan of Jelebu for ever.\"\n\n* The first division of this paper is, I need hardly point out, a literal translation of the story verbally communicated to me by Malays.\u2014H. A. O\u2019B.\nAnd this is the form of words that has been used from generation to generation by the Penghulus who have governed the country of Jelebu.\n\nThe Raja of Johor further issued instructions to the Penghulu, that from that time forth the Penghulus of Jelebu and of the other three States were not to bring their complaints before Johor.\n\nThereupon the four Penghulus made an arrangement to create a Raja of their own, and chose a man of the royal blood of Menangkabau, who on his election abode in the country of Sri Menanti.\n\nThe place where the election of this Raja occurred was Pet\u00e2jeh, and hence arises the old Malay saying: \"The source of royal power is Pet\u00e2jeh; the place where it dwells is Sri Meranti.\" A Yam Tuan Muda in Rembau, and a Yam Tuan Besar in Sri Menanti, such was the (new) order of things, and the four Penghulus no longer took their complaints to Johor, but to Sri Menanti, and had thus a Menangkabau man as their ruler.\n\nAt that time there was no Yam Tuan in Jelebu, but the Penghulu held sway in that country, and this state of things continued for a long time.\n\nAt length the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, who had a number of sons, sent one of them to Jelebu, merely to take up his abode there and to till the ground. His conduct was long watched by all the officers of Jelebu, and they saw that it was very good. His behaviour towards the people was good, and he seemed to be a man capable of supporting and sustaining the country. He was also a man of considerable mental ability, and his personal character was beyond reproach.\n\nAccordingly all the officers met together and notified to the Penghulu their intention * of making the Yam Tuan's (Sri Menanti) son their supreme ruler.\n\nHe was accordingly elected with the title of Yam Tuan of Jelebu, with the duties of protector of the inhabitants of that country. He did not, however, receive any jurisdiction in the country, and the Penghulu and the officers contributed to his support, each man as much as he could afford.\n\n* This account of the attitude of the Waris and Lembagas in these early times is noteworthy as bearing upon the present constitution of the country.\nThe district within which the Yam Tuan's authority extended was from Bandar Berangan up to Sungei Melentang, that is to say, to Batu Gominting (in other words, a portion of what is now Klawang).\n\nSuch was the limit of his private and direct rule from that time down to the time of his descendant at the present day.\n\nAnd should he violate this understanding or the customs of the country he may be deposed by his officers.\n\n\"If a king be just he is reverenced if unjust checked.\" *\n\nSuch was the order of things in former times, and the boundary of Jelebu with Pahang is the place called Meranti Sembilan, \u2020 while the boundary with Sungei Ujong is Bukit Tangga.\n\nNow Klawang is said to belong to Sungei Ujong for the following reasons.\n\nSome time ago a son of the Datu Penghulu of Jelebu violated a daughter of the Penghulu of Klambu, and was compelled to marry her. Sufficient money to pay the fine exacted was not forthcoming, and so in place of a money payment the Penghulu of Jelebu gave Klawang (to Sungei Ujong), that is to say, so much of it as is on the right as one goes up stream to Sungei Ujong and down stream so far as Lubok Kerbau Balir. For any measure that the Yam Tuan wishes to take in the district thus defined, he must first obtain the sanction of the Government of Sungei Ujong.\n\n---\n\nSuch is the account of the origin of the present Government which obtains in Jelebu, taken from the lips of those who are most likely to be informed on the subject and who are unanimous in their story.\n\nI may append a short account of the constitution of Jelebu as I found it when I visited it about the middle of the present\n\n* The headmen held that the present Yam Tuan has violated the constitution, and he now resides in Klawang, with an allowance from the British Government contingent upon his non-interference in the government of Jelebu.\n\n\u2020 This appears to have been the old Jakun boundary. It is low down on the Triang river, is decidedly Pahang in its tendencies, and does not acknowledge the Penghulu.\nyear (1884) and in what follows, for the purposes of simplicity, I venture to leave out of consideration the recent arrangements made with the rulers of Jelebu.\n\nThere is still a Yam Tuan of Jelebu * although practically he may be regarded as a cipher. He arrogated to himself powers of interference in the internal government of the country, which the Penghulu and the Waris considered to be a violation of the conditions under which the office of Yam Tuan was established, and he was ordered by them in 1880 to leave Jelebu and reside in Sri Menanti. A composition was, however, effected in his behalf, and he now resides in Klawang near the Jelebu frontier. Theoretically he still continues to be the Protector of the people, but I have not learnt that any point has been referred to him since his removal from the country, except in the case of an informal grant of land recently made to an European company in Jelebu, and again in the case of the Pahang boundary question, when he expressed his opinion to the Government at my request.\n\nThe Penghulu, therefore, Syed Ali bin Zin, is the ruler of the country, for all practical purposes. I may say the undisputed ruler, as the Yam Tuan signed a bond in January of the present year undertaking not again to interfere in the government of the State.\n\nThe Penghulu is assisted in the conduct of affairs by nine officers, or perhaps it would be more correct to describe his jurisdiction as limited by them. They are entitled Lembagas, of whom there are five, and Waris, who are four in number. The Lembagas have each a separate title:\n\n1. \u2014 Datu Mantri.\n2. \u2014 Datu Njiang.\n3. \u2014 Datu Chinchang.\n4. \u2014 Datu Sendara.\n5. \u2014 Datu Lela Angsa.\n\nThese officers are all entitled to a vote in every act of State, and any act done without their concurrence is illegal. At the State Council, however, they may, in case of illness and so on, be represented by authenticated Wakils. The entire land of Jelebu is considered to be vested in them and the Waris, but under no circumstances can a Lembaga rise to the office of Penghulu.\n\n* Since deceased\u201413th December, 1884.\u2014Ed.\nThe *Waris* are entitled as follows:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Raja Balang.\n2.\u2014Maharaja Indah.\n3.\u2014Raja Penghulu.\n4.\u2014Datu Umbei.\n\nThey also have a vote in the State Council, and the Penghulu is elected from their body with two reservations.\n\nThe Datu Umbei cannot become Penghulu, nor can the Raja Penghulu. A member of the family of the latter officer may, however, become a candidate for election.\n\nThe succession would appear to follow a fixed rule, viz., that on the death of a Penghulu who has been of the family of a Raja Penghulu, the Raja Balang of the day is elected. At his death the Maharaja Indah of the day succeeds, and is again succeeded as Penghulu by a member of the family of the Raja Penghulu.\n\nThis rule is theoretically absolute, but has often been broken through, and in all cases the appointment must be ratified by the unanimous vote of the Lembagas.\n\nThe Datu Mantri is the head of the Lembagas, with the full title of \"Datu Mantri Shah Memangku Alam.\" The full title of the Datu Umbei (father of the Waris) is \"Datu Umbei Pangkal Maharaja Lela.\"\n\nAccording to old custom, the Datu Lela Angsa was appointed by the Penghulu to protect the Yam Tuan, and the Penghulu when he wished to obtain an audience of the Yam Tuan applied to do so to the Datu Mantri, who laid the request before the Datu Lela Angsa.\n\nThe Yam Tuan has, however, no followers now, with the exception of an ex-Maharaja Indah, who was deposed for supporting him in acts of oppression, and who resides with him in Klawang. Similarly in former days the Yam Tuan had four officers attached to his household, who now exist no longer. Their titles were:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Bruang Sati who was chosen by the Datu Sendara.\n2.\u2014Penglina Prang, ... Datu Mantri.\n3.\u2014Penglina Mamat, ... Datu Chinchang.\n4.\u2014Penglina Prang No. 2, ... Datu Ngiang.\n\nThe Lembagas had thus a direct control over the internal\naffairs of the Yam Tuan's household, but, as I have said, all this is at an end now.\n\nThe Penghulu has four officers attached to his person, who are in like manner appointed and removed by the Waris.\n\n1\u2014Penglima Garang is chosen by the Datu Mantri.\n2\u2014Penglima Hitam, Datu Ngiang.\n3\u2014Penglima Sutan No. 1, Datu Chinchang.\n4\u2014Penglima Sutan No. 2, Datu Sendara.\n\nThe Penghulu, though in theory above control, is in reality entirely under the direction of the Lembagas and Waris, who, if unanimous, can obtain any constitutional change in the country they may desire by observing the following routine.\n\nIf a measure is originated at the unanimous desire of the Lembagas, it is submitted by them to the Waris, and vice versa. Should it obtain the concurrence of the party which is not its originator, it is submitted in due form to the Penghulu, who has the power of veto, but who in practice accepts what is laid before him with but little discussion. After this step has been taken, the measure (until recently) is transmitted to the Yam Tuan for final ratification, and when this has been obtained, the measure becomes law, binding upon the inhabitants of the country generally.\n\nThis process may appear to be rather too involved to work without friction in a Malay State, but there can be no doubt but that it contains elements of safety for the ryot from its very complexity.\n\nThe ex-Raja Balang left Jelebu and has reappeared with the Pahang envoy supporting his theory that Jelebu has always been Pahang territory, and that Jelebu as a separate State is non-existent.*\n\nWhatever may be the real status of Jelebu, the present condition of the country is truly deplorable. It bears marks of having been, at no very distant period, fairly prosperous and sufficiently peopled, but now, speaking generally, the whole land is waste.\n\nI passed the other day through mile after mile of deserted kampongs with fine padi land all round in abundance and with fruit-trees still in bearing.\n\nThe only sign of work or prosperity I came across was at\n\n* See the postscript.\nsome tin mines at Jel\u00fbndong, which have been worked on a small scale for 17 years by a Sungei Ujong Chinaman.\n\nThe tin deposit at this spot is the richest I have seen, being quite 100 per cent. better than in any mine at present working in Sungei Ujong, but even with this natural advantage the miner's struggle for existence is a very hard one. He is dependent for every mouthful of food upon Pahang or Sungei Ujong, and rice delivered at the mines is costly food indeed. When I was there, a dollar purchased only $2\\frac{3}{4}$ gantangs of rice, as against 7 gantangs in Sungei Ujong, and 10 gantangs at Ku\u00e2la Triang.\n\nAn arrangement has been entered into by which a bridle-track will be constructed from Pantei in Sungei Ujong to these mines early in the coming year, and other roads will be made later on. A shop in connection with the mines will be opened next year, so that I hope that they may progress as they ought to do.\n\nWith regard to the country generally, I see nothing in the way of its prosperity but the absence of population, and people are sure to come in when the proposed roads have become an established fact.\n\nH. A. O'BRIEN.\n\nP. S.\u2014At the present time (September, 1895) the road alluded to above has been completed, and a Collector (Mr. E. P. Gueritz) has been appointed, who took up his duties in June last. I understand that the old residents are gradually returning to the country, and that there is every prospect of an early development of the mineral resources of the State.\n\nThe Pahang boundary has been definitely fixed at Sungei Dua on the Triang, and the Collector's quarters, together with a Custom House, Court, and Police Station, have been erected at Ku\u00e2la Klawang.\n\nH. A. O'B.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nLATA.\n\nThe following extract will be of great interest to those who have read Mr. O'Brien's paper on this subject in No. 11 of this Journal.\u2014Ed.\n\n\"The first thing of interest to attract me within a few hours of my arrival at Kosala, was a case in one of the servants of the house of that curious cerebral affection called by the natives lata. It is of a hysterical nature, and is confined chiefly to women, although I have also seen a man affected by it. On being startled, or excited suddenly, the person becomes lata, losing the control of her will, and cannot refrain from imitating whatever she may hear or see done, and will keep calling out, as long as the fit lasts, the name\u2014and generally that word alone\u2014of whatever has flashed through her mind as the cause of it. \"He-ih-heh matjan!\" (tiger); \"He-ih-heh boorung besar!\" (a great bird). Her purpose will be arrested, as, if walking, she will stop short, and on going on again will often follow some other course. The prefatory exclamation is an invariable symptom, seemingly caused by involuntary hysterical inspirations. According to the degree of alarm the symptoms may remain only a few moments, or last for the greater part of a day, especially if the patient be prevented from calming down. The afflicted, if not very seriously affected, are not altogether incapacitated from performing the duties to which they are accustomed. The most curious characteristic of the disease is their imitation of every action they see. On one occasion, while eating a banana, I suddenly met this servant with a piece of soap in her hand: and, perceiving she was slightly lata, but without appearing to take any notice of her, I made a vigorous bite at the fruit in passing her, an action she instantly repeated on the piece of soap. On another\noccasion, while she was looking on as I placed some plants in drying paper, not knowing that caterpillars were objects of supreme abhorence to the natives, I flicked off in a humorous way on to her dress one that happened to be on a leaf; she was instantly intensely lata, and throwing off all her clothing, she made off like a chased deer along the mountain road, repeating the word for caterpillar as she ran, until compelled by exhaustion to stop, when the spasm gradually left her. My own \"boy,\" who would unconcernedly seize all sorts of snakes in his hands, became one day lata also, on suddenly touching a large caterpillar. My host's maid once, while alone at some distance from the house, having come unexpectedly on a large lizard\u2014the Baiawak\u2014was seized by a paroxysm; dropping down on her hands and knees to imitate the reptile, she thus followed it through mud, water and mire to the tree in which it took refuge, where she was arrested and came to herself. Another case which came under my knowledge was more tragic in its results. This woman, startled by treading in a field on one of the most venomous snakes in Java, became so lata that she vibrated her finger in imitation of the tongue of the reptile in front of its head till the irritated snake struck her; and the poor creature died within an hour.\n\nDuring the attack the eyes have a slightly unnatural stare, but there is never a total loss of consciousness, and throughout the paroxysm the patient is wishful to get away from the object affecting her, yet is without the strength of will to escape, or to cease acting in the way I have described. Lata persons are constantly teased by their fellows, and are often kept in an excited state for whole days.\"\u2014A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago.

Shipped on board the Alert, lent by the Resident Councillor of Penang, and started for Pangkor at 11.15 p.m. The launch Constance had been sent on to Bernam the previous day with a guard, and the Kinta being disabled, it would have been impossible to start without the Alert.\n\nSaturday, 11th April.\u2014Arrived at Pangkor at 6 a.m. Mr. Dew, the Acting Superintendent, came on board. Went ashore with Major Walker and Mr. Lister, and inspected the buildings. We left Pangkor at 2 p.m., and anchored inside the Bernam River at 6.30 p.m.\n\nSunday, 12th April.\u2014Under weigh at 4 a.m., and reached Saba at 6.30 a.m. Mr. Jones and Rajas Indut and Bidin came on board. Mr. Jones told us Mr. Hewett had gone on to Telok Mahang with the Constance and boats. Inspected the Police Station. I cannot understand the boldness of 12 Chinese robbers in attacking the station and village. There must have been at least thirty people actually on the spot in the shops between the farm and the station. Went down to Raja Indut's house with him. The cholera is decreasing. Two people died yesterday, and there have been 120 deaths since the outbreak of the disease. Left Saba at 8.30 a.m. and steamed up river to Telok Mahang. Here we met Mr. Hewett with the Constance at 3 p.m., and after two hours' further steaming arrived at Changkat Bertam, where we camped for the night, sleeping in the boats.\n\nMonday, 13th April.\u2014At daylight Walker and Hewett returned down river in the Constance, and we, having got all our baggage into eleven river-boats the previous evening,\nbegan rowing up-stream. Breakfasted on the river bank at noon, and getting into the great Bernam swamp camped for the night at Dah\u00e2 Rul the entrance to the final cutting. The banks were so low and wet we did not land, and the dew was excessive. This is where the fever was so bad when Mr. J. B. M. LEECH was cutting the canals. One of the boatmen sick.\n\nTuesday, 14th April.\u2014Started at daylight, having poled from midday yesterday. Stopped for breakfast at 12.30 p.m. The river here is most lovely, but the district is quite uninhabited and uncleared. The upper reaches of the Bernam are wonderful in the beauty and variety of water and foliage. It turns out that our sick boatman has cholera. I gave him some cholera medicine, but he was so frightened that it had no effect; we did what we could for him, and at his request sent him back in a boat. At 2 p.m. continued our journey and reached Ku\u00e2la Slim at 6 p.m., where we found Mr. Butler (the Acting Magistrate) with 39 Sakeis and 80 Malays to carry our baggage. The Bernam river, by the construction of seven miles of canal, could be shortened by about 57 miles of its present length, but those canals must be both deep and wide if they are to be useful at all times of the year and at all stages of the tide, and the question is whether the expenditure necessary for such a work is at present justifiable. The influence of the tide is felt for 80 miles from the mouth of the river.\n\nKu\u00e2la Slim is 120 miles from the mouth of the Bernam river by the present channel.\n\nWednesday, 15th April.\u2014At 7 a.m., 77\u00b0 Fahrenheit, the aneroid shewed Ku\u00e2la Slim to be 120 feet above sea level.\n\nHaving loaded the coolies, left Ku\u00e2la Slim at 7.20 a.m., and after five hours' walking over a very fair path with no steep gradients (the first three miles having been made), we reached Ku\u00e2la G\u00e9liting at 4.15 p.m. Distance 14 miles from Ku\u00e2la Slim, and 134 from Ku\u00e2la Bernam.\n\nWe found Mr. Hill and Mr. Woodgate at Ku\u00e2la G\u00e9liting waiting to go over the trace of the trunk-road with Mr. Jones.\n\nAfter dinner, had a long conversation with Haji Mustapha, Pengh\u00fblu of Ulu Bernam, Saiyid Abubakar, and Wan Lengga of Pahang. They told me they had heard that no rafts had yet been prepared at Buntu to take me down the Pahang River,\nand that I should only have to wait there; so I wrote letters to several Pahang Chiefs\u2014Toh Bakar of Buntu, Toh Kaya of Penjum, and others\u2014asking them to assist me with rafts, men and boats, and I gave these letters to Mantri Muda and Che Wanda to take over the next morning, having determined to wait a day at Kuala Geliting. The aneroid at 4.15 p.m., Thermometer 88\u00b0 F., shewed a height of 296 feet above the sea.\n\nThursday, 16th April.\u2014Messrs. Jones, Hill and Woodgate went off early towards Trolah to return by Pandras and examine two alternative traces for the main-road through Perak. They returned in the afternoon, and we determined that the trace already made crossing the Slim just below Kuala Geliting would be the best to adopt and the shortest. We spent our day in sketching and unpacking our stores from their boxes, as it was necessary to put them up in more manageable bundles in view of the difficult ground we had to travel over.\n\nFriday, 17th April.\u2014About thirty of our Malay coolies deserted before daylight, and this gave us a great deal of trouble, as we had not men enough to carry our baggage. By giving the Sikhs their kits to carry, we managed to get away at 8.15 a.m., with sixty-nine Malays and thirty-six Sakeis. Butler had fever and could not move. Hill, Jones and Woodgate went back to the Ulu Bernam, and Giles, Lister and I set our faces due North for Ulu Slim. After four miles of an intensely hot and trying walk through kampongs and padi-fields, we reached Kuala Briseh, the junction of the Slim and Briseh Rivers, and here we left the Slim, still flowing North and South, while we turned sharp to the East, following the course of the Briseh. Three and a half miles of very stiff walking, first through burnt secondary growth and then up a steep ascent, brought us to a bathing place on the bank of the Briseh, 1,233 feet above the sea, thermometer 85\u00b0, where at 11.45 we halted for breakfast.\n\nAfter a stay of two hours and a short further climb, we came to a curious overhanging rock called Sapor Batu (the stone lean-to) above the right bank of the Briseh River. Here we determined to camp for the night, as our coolies said they could go no further. At a very low estimate, we made 7\u00bd miles today from Kuala Geliting in a North-East and easterly\ndirection. The journey was infinitely more trying than the 14 miles to Kuala Geliting. Our camp was a striking sight with its fires lighting up the various groups of Sakeis, Indians, Malays and Chinese under the huge overhanging granite rock surrounded by the impenetrable gloom of virgin forest, with the faint roar of the Briseh River rushing over its rocky bed fifty feet below.\n\nSaturday, 18th April.\u2014Left Sapor Batu at 6.40 a.m., and going still easterly, with the Briseh down in a gorge on our right, we continued the ascent till we crossed a considerable tributary of the Briseh named Jelutong Laper, height 1,646 feet above the sea. Immediately afterwards we ascended a very steep hill, then followed a ridge and with longish ascents and short descents crossed in succession the following streams:\n\n7.30 a.m. S. Sapor Ibu, 1,826 feet,\n7.40 a.m. S. Sapor Anak, 1,886 feet,\nS. Sapor Manah,\n8. a.m. S. Sapor Kayu Ara, 2,281 feet,\n\nthe thermometer reading 77\u00b0 F. Fifteen minutes\u2019 walk brought us to Sapor Buluh at 8.30 a.m., height 2,550 feet above the sea, four miles from camp and eleven and-a-half miles from Kuala Geliting. Temperature 75\u00b0 F. Here a hut had been built for us, but after a halt of 25 minutes to let the baggage come up, we pushed on again almost due East up a steep ridge, and, passing Batu Hidang at 9.10 a.m., elevation 3,000 feet above sea, we reached Batu Gajah at 9.22; height 3,100 feet; and the boundary between Perak and Pahang at 9.30 a.m. The aneroid showed that the gap was 2,854 feet above Kuala Geliting and 3,150 feet above the sea.\n\nIn a very tiny rill running West we traced the source of the Briseh, and only a few feet on the other side was the first sign of a stream which, with eight others running between a succession of buttresses jutting out from the main range, forms, a little lower down, the Sungei Sambilan\u2014the most northerly of the three streams which, united, are called the Lipis; the Lipis in its turn joining the Jelei with a more northerly source, and, together, becoming the Pahang River. Looking into Pahang as one stands on the gap, a lofty mountain of some 5,000 feet rises on the right, this is Chunggang, while to the left towers\na higher mountain named K\u00e2but. These are on the true backbone of the Peninsula, which here runs very nearly due North and South, while on either side jut out spurs more or less at right angles to the main range\u2014eastward into Pahang and westward into P\u00e9ra. These spurs extend, as a rule, for about six miles on each side of the backbone.\n\nWithout halting at the summit, we immediately began the descent into Pahang, and, just as we had ascended a long, narrow, gradually rising ridge called G\u00fbnong Tel\u00e2ga with the Br\u00eeseh River flowing down its southern base, so we descended the longest of many easterly-running ridges, the Sungei Sambilan flowing West with a slight trend to the North along its southern base, but the descent into Pahang was decidedly steeper than that into P\u00e9ra, and after 30 minutes' walk we crossed one of the nine streams that form the Sambilan, and found we had come down 660 feet.\n\nThe soil on both sides was only moderate, studded all over with the most gigantic granite boulders I have ever seen in the Peninsula.\n\nOn the P\u00e9ra side, I noticed many dry watercourses full of large granite blocks. In those the water may be subterraneous, as it is on the slopes of Ginting Bidei in Sel\u00e2ngor, but more probably the long drought accounts for the absence of water. On the whole, I have never seen a range better watered than this one, and it is only surprising that the Slim is not a larger river. At 2\u00bd miles from the boundary and a height of 2,100 feet above the sea, we breakfasted by the bank of the Sambilan, road and river bearing 7\u00b0 North of East.\n\nAt 12.37 p.m. we resumed our journey, and at 1.30 p.m. reached a spot on the river called Sangka Dua, where two branches of the river meet again after dividing and forming a large island. Height above sea 1,740 feet. Thermometer 82\u00b0 F. At 1.35 p.m. crossed the river again, but here it is named the Kenor, and has, the natives say, already received the waters of the two branches, viz., the true Lipis, which rises from the western side of Gunong Temang Batuk (in which hill the Sungei Geliting takes its rise and flows westward), and the Tebatuk, rising from a mountain further South, in which the Bernam River is said to have its source. The Kenor is now a considerable stream, and crossing it (1,564 feet above\nthe sea) we immediately began the ascent of what looks like an isolated hill called B\u00earang. It is really, however, I should say, a long spur from the main range, over the end of which the water system passes, and which the Malay crosses as a short cut rather than follow the winding course of the river. The ascent is steep but short and of no great height, the highest point we reached being 1,734 feet above the sea, and from here the saddle is so narrow that Chung-gang can be plainly seen to the South-West and K\u00e2but to the North-West. This saddle runs round in an E.-S.-Easterly direction, and the descent is very fatiguing. The spur seems to be only a few feet across the top, but unusually long, and you descend by seven steps, each with a long gradual rise, and then a very steep descent. The bottom of this spur we reached at 3.8 p.m., height 680 feet above the sea, and crossing and recrossing the River Buntu, which comes from the North, we camped at the Ku\u00e2la Buntu, where it falls into the K\u00ebnor, and the combined rivers are here, for the first time, named the Lipis. The spot where the Buntu joins the K\u00ebnor is called Ku\u00e2la Buntu, and this spot we reached at 3.40 p.m., eleven miles from the boundary and fifteen miles from our last camp at S\u00e2por B\u00e2tu.\n\nSunday, 19th April.\u2014At 7 a.m. we left our camp, and walking through burnt secondary growth along the banks of the Lipis in a North-easterly direction reached Perm\u00e2tang Linggi at 8 a.m. This place is 640 feet above the sea and still 344 feet above Ku\u00e2la G\u00ebl\u00ecting on the P\u00earak side of the range. Ku\u00e2la Buntu to Perm\u00e2tang Linggi three miles. Fourteen miles from the latter place to the boundary, and twenty-five and a half miles at least from Ku\u00e2la G\u00ebl\u00ecting. Good Malay walkers can do the whole distance in a day.\n\nToh Bakar, the headman of this district, met me on the road, and took us to his house at Perm\u00e2tang Linggi, where we were received with a salute from a few muskets. About a mile before reaching Perm\u00e2tang Linggi, I noticed the stream went over a bed rock of slate, and all the gold is found further down the river. Toh Bakar had prepared twenty-three small rafts for us, on which we shall have to travel to J\u00ebram B\u00ebsu\u2014a rapid where, they tell us, it is necessary to leave the river and walk to P\u00fbchong. I found that Toh Bakar had never been in his\nlife to see the Raja at the mouth of the river, and though he (Toh Bakar) is called the owner of Tr\u00fbsang, one of the richest gold districts in Pahang, it is said the Raja has lately given the place to the Toh Gajah. Spent the day in writing and settling with our Malay and Sakei coolies, the latter returning highly delighted with their earnings. After dinner had a talk with Toh Bakar. He and the people with him told me of all the taxes they are called upon to pay. Once a year the people are numbered, and have to pay $1.33 a head to the Yam T\u00fban; this they call Hasil banchi. Then there is the serah, a form of squeeze still practised in Pahang; some worthless thing is sent from the Raja to a subject, a price is named, and the subject is obliged to purchase at that price. Again when a District Chief goes annually to pay homage to the Raja, the Chief calls upon every man in his district to pay $1 towards his expenses, and a similar contribution is demanded for the return journey. All gold must be sold to the Raja only, and it is said there is no standard of weight. It is said that most imports and exports are taxed, debt-slavery prevails in parts, and the people are liable to be called out for forced labour. The Dato' tells me that Mr. W. Cameron came here and went on to Batu G\u00e2jah, but he is the only white man he ever saw.\n\nA curious thing yesterday was to hear the cry, twice repeated, of a wild Sakei as yet unfamiliar with Malays. The cry was exactly like that of a wild beast, and was probably a warning to the friends of the man who uttered it; he could not have been far from us on the eastern slope of B\u00earang. Some of our people caught with nets this afternoon two of the finest fresh water fish I ever tasted in the East\u2014ikan klah\u2014weighing about 6 lbs. each.\n\nMonday, 20th April.\u2014After no little trouble arranging our baggage for the rafts (bamboo, four feet wide and about twenty-five feet long) we left Perm\u00e2tang Linggi at 8 A.M. We had twenty-four rafts manned by Toh Bakar's adherents and eight of the men I had brought over. The Dato', his son and all his people accompanied us, and the start was a most picturesque scene. Each raft had a poler at the stem and another at the stern, some baggage and one or two passengers on a raised central platform. The rafts at once began the descent of a\nsuccession of rapids with intervening stretches of smooth and broken water, the stream running through a gorge with steep hills always on the northern side and sometimes on both, magnificently wooded down to the water's edge, the remarkable Gapis tree being a special feature. The bed of the stream appeared to be sometimes of slate and sometimes of sandstone, the banks usually of the latter and a good soil. No river scenery in the Peninsula have I ever seen to compare with this in beauty, added to which the novelty of shooting a long succession of fairly steep rapids made the journey most enjoyable.\n\nAt 9.15 A.M. we had to unload the rafts in order to shoot a considerable rapid called Jeram Mengalor. This was negotiated without accident, and passing a very curious fishing weir in the form of the letter W, constructed by Sakeis, we stopped for breakfast at 10.30 A.M., having descended sixty feet in a distance of about three and a half miles. We left again at 2 P.M., passed the mouths of several small tributaries, and reaching a long straggling kampong called Ulu Sungei at 2.45 P.M., we tied up for the night at its lowest end named Seribu, time 3.15 P.M., total distance, say, ten and a half miles. Unfortunately the man carrying the aneroid fell overboard from my raft and the instrument was damaged. We had to unload every raft and lift them one after another over an immense fallen tree, many similar obstructions being passed by lying down as the raft glided under one end. Altogether, without stoppages, we were five hours travelling and ten and a half miles is perhaps a low estimate of the distance, but it was carefully calculated, the compass directions being at the same time noted and shewing that the river winds considerably, the general direction being from N.E. to S.E.\n\nAt Seribu I found the Panglima Muda awaiting me, and a hut prepared for our reception by the influence of Toh Bakar. The people are all very polite and friendly, but their minds are unsettled, owing to the late attempt of the Raja Muda Mansur to enter the country, and they don't know whether my sympathies are with him or with the Yam Tuan. We made a number of sketches during the day.\n\nTuesday, 21st April.\u2014At midnight last night we had a thunderstorm followed by a heavy storm of rain, the first for\nthree months here. We seem to have brought it over with us, for the night before we could see it raining at B\u00e2tu G\u00e2jah though it did not reach us. We have reason to be specially thankful for the fine weather we have had. Our journey across the hills would have been a very different matter in wet weather, many of the streams are unfordable in the rains, and though we might have made a very much more rapid descent from B\u00e2tu G\u00e2jah, it would probably not have been on our feet. Two of the twelve Bernam men we were obliged to bring to help to man the rafts showed signs of cholera yesterday; one is better, but the other worse this morning, and neither is fit for work. Left S\u00ebreb\u00fb at 7.15 A.M., and passed a rock called B\u00e2tu Rimau. This is supposed to be a petrified tiger, his body only, his head is said to be in J\u00eblei. At 8.20 A.M. we reached Ku\u00e2la Sungei Che Nek; gold is found in the Ulu of this river. At 9 A.M. we shot the Jeram M\u00ebnangis (\"the rapid of tears\"); and shortly after the Jeram Maalim, a considerable drop in the river. At 9.25 A.M. reached B\u00e2tu T\u00e2lam, and there met Haji Besar, my messenger, in a small boat with a letter from the Yam T\u00fban, saying, he feared I should find the journey over the hills a difficult one, but that he had sent orders to all the headmen to assist me. At 9.45 A.M. stopped for breakfast, and leaving again at noon reached Ku\u00e2la Tr\u00fbsang at 2 P.M.\n\nSending on the other rafts, we landed here and walked to a spot a mile distant where some twenty Chinese are mining for gold. About a quarter of an acre has been worked out by previous miners, who are said to have got $5\\frac{1}{2}$ katis from a hole 60 feet in diameter, but left owing to a poll tax of $8$ a head being imposed, and the present men have only just begun stripping; one of them washed a basin of already once washed earth and obtained from it a few grains of gold. The spot is thirty feet above Ku\u00e2la Tr\u00fbsang and is reached by crossing higher ground.\n\nReturned to Ku\u00e2la Tr\u00fbsang and started again at 3.40 P.M. getting ourselves and most of our effects drenched by a very heavy storm of rain. Arrived at Ku\u00e2la S\u00ebmantan at 4.30 P.M., and there tied up for the night.\n\nI have ascertained that the following are the prices of certain commodities sold at P\u00ebnjum, where the Ulu people have their nearest market. These prices are due to the fact that\nthe import of nearly every necessary and luxury seems to be farmed to certain Chinese at Pekan, the Yam Tuan's residence at the mouth of the river. Holding a monopoly, the farmers of course charge any price they like, and it is perhaps in consequence of this that the Chinese miners in Pahang are said to number about one hundred only, and all the Malays seem to be wretchedly poor.\n\n1 tin Kerosene oil, $2.00.\nTobacco, $1 a kati.\n40 bits of Gambier, 8 cents.\n6 gantangs Salt, $1.\n1 ball of Opium $22; and so on.\n\nThe highest price for rice is said to be $1 for twelve gantangs. The currency of the country is gold, and the following are the weights and values:\n\n1 Itam Tengko = 4 cents of a dollar.\n1 Keneri of gold = 2 Itam Tengko = 8 cents.\n1 Buso = 2 Keneri = 2 Saga = 16 cents.\n1 Suku = 1 Kupang = 2 Buso = 33\u00bd cents.\n3 Kupang = $1.\n4 Kupang = 4 Suku = 1 Mas = $1.33\u00bd cents.\n16 Mas = 1 Bungkal valued in Pahang at $24, which seems curious as it ought only to be worth $21.28.\n\nAbout 7 p.m. I heard that a messenger had arrived from Permatang Linggi to say that one of my Bernam coolies, left behind to return, had died of cholera. I determined to send all my Bernam men back at once, as this makes the third man who has sickened in two days. One of those with us is better, the other worse and unable to be moved. Kept on raining till late in the night. Distance travelled to-day thirteen miles, general direction E.S.E.\n\nWednesday, 22nd April.\u2014Sent back Penghulu Mat Saleh and the Bernam men except the one too sick to move; left him with some money in the care of a man across the river. He is a very bad patient, refuses all medicine, and does everything he is told not to do. He looks bad, but is, I think, perhaps more frightened than really ill. We had a good deal of trouble in getting new men to supply the places of these Bernam\npeople, and did not get away from Ku\u00e2la Semantau till 9 A.M. At 10.30 A.M. Imam Prang P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, a great Captain and headman of some influence, met me and invited me to go and spend the night at his house. I found he lived at a place called Smau, two hours' walk inland from Ku\u00e2la Dum, on the right bank of the river, and, as I should have lost a whole day by complying with his invitation and should have had to carry all our baggage inland and back again, I begged him to excuse me. He said he asked me to go to shew his friendship and good feeling, and I am afraid he was rather disappointed, but there was nothing to see at his place, and I could hardly spare the time.\n\nAt 11.30 A.M. stopped at Ku\u00e2la Dum for breakfast, after which I had a long talk with the Imam Prang and his people. They all complained of excessive taxation and the want of settled laws and customs. The Imam Prang told me that every buffalo exported is liable to a tax of $3, and this goes to the Toh Gajah, though formerly he himself received it. At P\u00ebnjum, there is a gambling farm, which pays the Toh Kaya $50 a month, and that chief also gets a tax of one-tenth on all imported cloth. A great deal of rice is imported from Kelantan, also silk sarongs. A good many sarongs are, however, manufactured in Pahang, chiefly at the P\u00ebkan.\n\nAt 2.30 P.M. saying good-bye to the Imam Prang, we started again and still meeting occasional rapids, we soon passed into a magnificent open country, where the scenery, though different from that in the Ulu, is in its way equally fine. The river widens into a broad stream, with a partly dry channel, shewing what a considerable river it must be in the rains. The bed is full of snags, and nothing whatever seems to have been done to it, but were it cleared, there is water enough for a launch, though of course nothing of the kind could get here owing to the Jeram B\u00ebsu rapid, which cannot be passed by boat even going down-stream. There seems to be an immense tract of level ground here. I have seen nothing like it elsewhere at such a distance from the coast. I have been told that cocoa-nuts will not flourish at over fifty miles from the sea-shore, but that is a mistake, for we have seen them everywhere.\n\nAt 3.30 P.M. we passed Ku\u00e2la Chen\u00fber and Toh Bakar\ntold me that, though his territory extended further down, his people ended here. I am told that the Jelei River, which is longer and larger than the Lipis, rises in the main range with a branch from G\u00fbnong T\u00e2han\u2014a mountain lying between the Jelei and the T\u00eam\u00ealin. The T\u00eam\u00ealin, which is said to be as considerable a stream as the Jelei, rises from the South-east face of G\u00fbnong T\u00e2han, with a branch rising in the borders of Pahang and Tr\u00ebngg\u00e2nu. G\u00fbnong T\u00e2han thus stands at the meeting of Pahang, K\u00eblant\u00e2n and Tr\u00ebngg\u00e2nu, and is not in the main range, but as this is only native report, much reliance must not be placed on it. The Lipis, Jelei and T\u00eam\u00ealin unite and form the Pahang river. At 4 p.m. we reached Ku\u00e2la S\u00ebger, Dato\u2019 Kli\u2019s kampong, one of the most beautiful places we have yet seen on the river. It is 363 feet above the sea. The Dato\u2019 received us most cordially, and seemed a very good-tempered, intelligent old man. Distance travelled eleven miles. General direction N.E. Distance from Ku\u00e2la Bernam, 195 miles.\n\nIn the evening the Dato\u2019 told me he could not get men enough to carry our baggage past the Jeram B\u00ebsu rapid, and that I must stay here to-morrow whilst he collects them. Toh Bakar told me he would now return with his men. I am sorry to hear that one of them has stayed behind with choleraic symptoms. I sent him some medicine.\n\nThursday, 23rd April.\u2014Che Wan Da arrived in the course of the morning with a number of men, and there was a great argument as to the liabilities of the owners of buffaloes, a man having been recently killed by one of those dangerous animals. Toh Bakar came to tell me he and his people must now return, and Toh Kli would take me down to P\u00ebnjum. He also said he had just heard that a girl he had brought down with him and left at Batu T\u00e2lam died last night of cholera. It is very distressing. She was perfectly well until yesterday evening, but was then attacked and died in the night. I cannot understand it. Coming across from Slim, not a man complained, the water we have had to drink has been excellent, and they have had no cholera in Pahang up to this time. I gave Toh Bakar some medicines with directions how to use them, also a present of money to himself and his men, and we parted with mutual expressions of good-will. I have had to\nprescribe for several people since I came here, fortunately with good results.\n\nDevoted the day to writing up journal, and in the evening went out to try and find some jungle fowl, but failed. Between the river and the hills there is one great level plain covered with very short grass. Until three years ago this was a padi-field, but owing to defects in the irrigation system, they cannot now cultivate. The drought here is excessive, even the *sireh* vines are all burnt up; there are no vegetables, owing to the dryness of the ground, and the people live on rice and on what fish they can catch in the river. The villagers, principally the womenkind, wash the sand in the bed of the river for gold, and get from sixteen cents to one dollar's worth a day.\n\n**Friday, 24th April.**\u2014Left Seger at 7.30 A.M. and walked through the fields to Jeram Tem\u00e2le, about two miles, Giles going in the boats. All the trees that do flower seem to have come out in this dry weather, and we passed many covered all over with a splendid purple bloom, others bright scarlet and yellow, and the *M\u00ebmplas,* the leaves of which are used as sand-paper, in full flower, a delicate pale yellow blossom with the sweetest scent. I have never seen it in flower before, nor the trees in such profusion. These level grass plains dotted over with flowering shrubs are very unlike other parts of the Peninsula. The heat is excessive even from early morning, and the nights are not cool.\n\nHaving taken out of the rafts such baggage as would be damaged by water, we started again at 9.30 A.M., and reached Jeram B\u00ebs\u00fb at 10 A.M. This rapid and the approach to it form the most striking picture we have yet seen on this river, which presents a long succession of lovely ever-changing scenes. The river widens into a pool of dark unbroken water, with steep hills covered by virgin forest rising straight from the edge of the pool; then it narrows to the head of the rapid, which is in truth a cataract. From top to bottom of the rapid,\n\n---\n\n*Probably a Michelia. The ordinary *mempelas* is a *ficus*; (*ficus microcarpa*, *amplas* and *politoria*). See the description of this and other species of *ficus* in Java. Forbes' Eastern Archipelago, 77.\u2014Ed.*\nand for many miles below, the bed rock (a hard sandstone) crops out and has been cut by the water into fantastic shapes, while huge boulders are piled in picturesque confusion on either side of the channel. These rocks as we came up were covered by men in many-coloured dresses, the rafts were either lying against the rocks at the head of the cataract, or slowly filing into the basin at its head and the clouds of spray dashed up from the rapid against the deep shadow of jungle foliage made a picture not to be forgotten.\n\nThe rapid itself, comparatively small after four months' drought, is the channel of the river running under the left bank, and at first sight it did not look like a place down which either raft or boat could go in safety, but we were shortly to see that the operation, though attended with considerable risk, could be successfully performed. The rapid is about sixty yards long, with a drop of some twelve feet, the water rushes and boils and foams between walls of rock, and there are two corners in the length which make the principal dangers. Two Malays mounted a raft, one at the stem and the other at the stern, each holding a large bamboo paddle fixed in a tripod. The raft slowly reached the top of the rapid, and then leapt into the boiling stream, where the men were instantly up to their waists in water. The stern man was washed off the raft, and it looked as if nothing could save him in such a place, but while the bow man with two or three powerful strokes of the paddle kept the bow off the opposite rock, the stern man dexterously leaped again on the raft, and in a moment of time a few more strokes of the bow man's paddle had cleared the raft of the second danger\u2014a projecting rock on the other bank\u2014and the raft was in smooth water below. After this, a second raft was taken down in the same way, and then each man went alone on a raft, and, though one of them was again thrown off in the middle of the rapid, and the other one had the paddle whirled out of his hand as the raft took its first leap, no accident occurred. A number of rafts were then sent down by themselves, and they seemed to accomplish the journey almost better without assistance, but this was explained by the fact that the weight of even one man sinks the raft to a dangerous depth, where the points of unseen rocks may wreck it. Old Dato' KLI absolutely refused to allow us to tempt Providence\nin a journey down this rapid, where a good many fatal accidents have occurred, and even tried his best to make us walk to P\u00fbchong, but this we refused to do, and sending all our non-waterproof baggage, watches, &c. by land with the Sikhs, we started again on the rafts.\n\nThe river from Jeram B\u00ebs\u00fb to P\u00fbchong runs through a long winding gorge, and the channel of the stream passing continuously between walls of bed rock and piles of immense detached boulders, is nothing but a series of more or less formidable rapids which succeed each other with somewhat confusing speed, but it is an exciting amusement, which we would not willingly have missed. We reached P\u00fbchong at 12.45 p.m., very hungry indeed, and the coolies carrying our baggage arriving at the same time, we sat down on the high bank of the river as we could get no shade and made a rather uncomfortable meal. People were washing for gold in the bed of the river in several places below the last rapid. From P\u00fbchong nearly all the S\u00ebger people returned, and we started again at 2.20 p.m. with our own people doing most of the poling. Toh Kli however still accompanied us.\n\nAt 2.45 p.m. we met the Orang Kaya L\u00eepis with a number of very small boats, a lot of men, and a Malay band, and when Giles, Lister and I had changed from our rafts into boats, we went on again at 3.35 p.m., and reached P\u00ebnjum at 6.30 p.m., dark except for the light of the moon now about fifteen days old. I went down with the Orang Kaya in his boat and as it leaked got wet through.\n\nA great reception awaited us at P\u00ebnjum; the high bank which rises from the river in three terraces was crowded by people some fifty of whom carried torches, their light strongly reflected by the river, here crowded with boats and rafts, made the effect very striking. As we hurried up the rough steps cut in the soil, a salute of many guns was fired, and the Orang Kaya, leading me by the hand, ushered us into a house which had been prepared for us, and made us as comfortable as possible with the means at his command. The \"band\" had played with great perseverance all down the river.\n\nThe distance travelled to-day was about sixteen and a half miles, and the general direction N.N.E. We did not get dinner\ntill 9.30 p.m., and after that the Orang Kaya and Che Ali, who had been sent by the Yam Tuan and received me with the utmost cordiality, came in for a talk. I told the Orang Kaya I wished to go on as soon as possible, but he said there was a difficulty about boats and we could not get on to-morrow; after he had left, I received a message from Che Ali to say that the Orang Kaya had not complied with the orders he received from the Sultan, and that the boats ought to have been ready.\n\nSaturday, 25th April.\u2014Che Wan Da, who brought over my letter to the Orang Kaya and has been very useful, came to tell me he would now return to his place. He told me there was a large gold mine called Jali, worked by Chinese, an hour's walk from here. I thought of going to see it, but found the journey would be useless as they were only stripping. I understand they are working the side of a hill. It is an old mine and has yielded good results in past times. I heard from the Chinese that there is plenty of gold in the country, but no one can live here owing to the injustice, \"squeezing,\" and want of government. They say whenever any one gets gold it is taken from him on some pretext or other, and that very few Chinese are now left in the place. If a man gets on a good mine, some chief claims it, work is stopped and not resumed, and the result is that the country is in a very bad state at the present time. A friend of Raja Ismail's told me that only about twenty Chinese had worked for him at Raub, and then in a very erratic and perfunctory way, sometimes stopping work altogether for months, even for a year, from want of capital.\n\nSpent the day in writing and making a sketch of Penjum from across the river. This place is 210 feet above sea level.\n\nSunday, 26th April.\u2014I had begged that the boats might be ready for us at 6 a.m., but was disappointed. In spite of the Yam Tuan's letter, there were only two large boats and a small one ready for our party of twenty-five, Wan Ali giving me the best part of his boat. We put the servants into the small boat, Giles and Lister went in the large one, and a number of Sikhs in the other large boat, but finding it leaked, we had to move them into a boat which providentially arrived at that moment sent by the Imam Prang Gajah, with his son as ambassador, to meet us. Wan Ali was exceedingly angry\nand said unkind things of the Orang Kaya Lipis, who kept walking on the bank in an aimless way seemingly quite unable to meet such a demand on his energy and resources. I of course said nothing, but Wan Ali told me the Yam Tuan had sent orders to all the Chiefs to assist me and treat me as they would himself. I had paid Toh Bakar for the very great help he had given us (without any orders from his Sultan) and I also sent away Toh Klri happy with a present, for he is not well off, nor in the way of squeezing other people to do his work, but I only thanked the Orang Kaya for what he did and in any case I should have hesitated to offer him money.\n\nI was sorry not to meet here the Orang Kaya Jelei, to whom the Sultan had sent a letter telling him to meet us at Penjum, but the Orang Kaya lives so far off he had not time to comply with the order, and I left a message for him in case he came after we had gone. The delay in getting our party finally settled into boats was so great that we did not leave Penjum till 10 A.M.\n\nAbove Kuala Priok, Che Wan Da met us with a present of rice, and we stopped at the Kuala, a beautiful place, for breakfast. Che Wan Da's father lives here. On the way down the river, we passed a gigantic waterwheel fixed in the river and used for irrigating the land on the bank. The wheel (undershot) is forced slowly round by the current of the river. On its outer circumference are fixed at a certain angle lengths of bamboo closed at one end and open at the other and as the wheel revolves these bamboos in turn enter the river, mouth upwards, are filled with water, and, as they arrive at the highest point of their orbit, they, one after the other, discharge their load of water into a trough which conveys it by gravitation to the required point in the field. I have not before seen in the Malay States so large or well-constructed an irrigating wheel, but I believe they have been and still may be used in Ulu Muar.\n\nLeft Kuala Priok at 1.30 P.M. and continuing our journey reached Kuala Lipis (where this river falls into the Jelei) at 1.50 P.M. Here Che Wan Da left us to return to his home; he has been very useful and shewn a great desire to be friendly and helpful. The combined rivers\u2014the Lipis and Jelei\u2014immediately after their junction, are about sixty yards wide. The\nJelei carries rather more water than the Lapis. Camped for the night at Pulau Krinau at 5.30 p.m., having passed the following kampongs during the day:\u2014Bandar Lama, Kampong Pulau, Semitong, Jeram Laina, Kuala Kechau.\n\nDistance travelled today, ten miles; general direction N.N.E.\n\nMonday, 27th April.\u2014Started before 6 a.m. and passing Changkoug, where there is a longish rapid with but little fall in it but many rocks which make it difficult for boats to navigate, stopped just below at noon for breakfast. The river is here about 100 yards wide, that is, the bed of the stream from bank to bank. There were numerous tracks of deer on the sandspit where we lunched, and while we stayed there the carcase of a wild pig floated past. Leaving again at 1.30 p.m. we camped for the night at Kuala Temelin, where the waters of that stream join the combined Lapis and Jelei thus forming the Pahang River.*\n\nThe Temelin, which, as I have said, comes from the North and rises in a mountain on the borders of Pahang and Trengganu, is in width and body of water about the same size as the combined Lapis and Jelei, at least so it appears at the confluence, but it is a curious fact that neither the addition of the waters of the Jelei nor yet of the Temelin appears to make any immediate and pronounced difference in the width or depth of the Pahang River. The growth of the stream seems gradual, and, except at the actual points of junction, the reception of the waters of the Jelei and Temelin, themselves large rivers, seems to have no more effect in widening or deepening the river than is made by the addition of the waters of any of those smaller tributaries the mouths of which we pass daily. It was 5 p.m. when we reached Kuala Temelin, 134 feet above the sea, and with some difficulty I got here a few specimens of really excellent Malay pottery\u2014vessels of various forms and designs for holding water.\n\n* This place is mentioned in Perak history, on the occasion of the marriage of the Raja Muda of Pahang with a Perak princess (circ. A.D. 1600), as the place at which the Perak and Pahang envoys met. The Temelin is the river called Tumblang in the Misa Malaya and in the Undang-undang ha Raja-an (code of laws) of Perak, Pahang and Johor. See No. 9 of this Journal, p. 101.\nKu\u00e2la T\u00ebm\u00eblin is celebrated in Pahang for its earthenware, but like all natives far from a market, the potters keep no stock and make only what is ordered. The shapes of the jars I got are all good, and the decoration, done with a sharp tool before the firing, is most artistic. We ordered some further specimens to be made, including incense-burners.\n\nDistance travelled to-day 21\u00bd miles; general direction E.S.E.\n\nWe passed, in the order in which they are given, the following small villages or clusters of huts on our journey to-day:\u2014P\u00e2sir Sibau, Jeram Ch\u00ebkuas, B\u00e2tu G\u00e2jah, Sungei K\u00ebnung, Rantau Panjang, Pulau Sa\u2019amas, Sungei Chika, Pulau T\u00ebmb\u00e2nga, Changkat Glagor, B\u00e2tu P\u00e2pan.\n\nTuesday, 28th April.\u2014Got away at 5.30 A.M., and stopped for breakfast at Kangsa at 12.25 P.M. The temperature in my boat at noon was 93\u00b0 and in the water of the river 98\u00b0. The thermometer stands at 95\u00b0 in the boat every day at 2 P.M. and the excessive heat of Pahang strikes us all. We notice here that the people are decidedly darker than the Malays on the western side of the Peninsula, and those Malays who have come with us from P\u00e9r\u00e1k complain especially of the great heat of the ground to bare feet when walking in the exposed fields which stretch inland from the river bank. Unfortunately I broke the thermometer to-day, but I do not think it could tell us much more than we have learnt already.\n\nStarted again at 3.45 P.M., and reached Pulau T\u00e2wer at 4 P.M. Here we were met by the Imam Prang Indra G\u00e2jah, the Yam T\u00fban\u2019s right-hand man in all matters connected with that part of the country which lies up-stream from Pulau T\u00e2wer. The Imam Prang gave us a most cordial reception and, dragging me by the hand up the almost vertical bank (here twenty to twenty-five feet high), ushered us into a comfortable hut, which we were informed had been constructed in a day. Our subsequent proceedings, whether dressing, writing, eating or sleeping, seemed to be matters of the deepest interest to the large crowd of Malays who surrounded the place and never lost sight of us for a moment. Toh G\u00e2jah, who is a man of about forty, very thickset and dark, but full of laughter, informed me that he had four wives, twenty-five children and nine grandchildren. He introduced his brother and a few of his male children, and after seeing that we wanted nothing\nwent to arrange for men to take us to Kota K\u00eblanggi to-morrow morning as I expressed a wish to visit the caves there.\n\nNo one has been for some time, and the path is said to be overgrown, so the Toh G\u00e2jah sent off a lot of men to clear it. The river here is about 700 feet wide (about the same width as the P\u00earak River at Ku\u00e2la Kangsa); the banks are exceedingly high and steep and the river at the present time is said to be lower than ever known. The Toh G\u00e2jah says that if the drought continues for another two months, that is, making six instead of three dry months as usual, there may be partial famine in the place.\n\nThe Toh G\u00e2jah settled with his people at Pulau T\u00e2wer twelve years ago, after he returned from Klang where he was sent in command of the three thousand Pahang men who, at the request of Governor Sir Harry Ord, were despatched by the B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra to assist Tunku Dia Uddin in the struggle with R\u00e2j\u00ee Mahdi.\n\nA fine kampong, and houses shut in by a long bamboo fence, stretches along the bank of the river in a grove of young cocoa-nut and other fruit trees. Behind this hamlet extends an almost level plain, as far as the eye can reach, broken only to the North by a small pointed hill, and to the East by the limestone rocks in which are the caves of Kota K\u00eblanggi. A considerable portion of the plain is now being ploughed for the cultivation of rice, and the rest is jungle.\n\nFar away to the West is the mass of hills called Gunong Raya, to the North of which lies the river down which we have come. The mountains of the main range are nowhere visible, and we are told that the mouth of the Pahang River lies from here East a little South.\n\nToh G\u00e2jah's father was a Sumatran Malay, his mother a Pahang woman; he is reported to be a great warrior, is the Field Marshal of Pahang and ranks with the Orang B\u00ebsar Ampat or Chiefs of the first class. He is a man of much energy, greatly feared by the discontented faction in the upper country and greatly trusted by the Yam T\u00fban.\n\nI have ascertained from Che Ali, who is a good authority and one of the Yam T\u00fban's most trusted adherents, that the following are the principal Chiefs of Pahang:\u2014\nNew Creation,\n\nThe R\u00e2ja Muda.\nThe D\u00e2toh B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra.\nThe D\u00e2toh T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong.\n\n\u00d4rang B\u00ebsar Ampat,\nClass I.\n\n1. The Toh Bandar.\n2. Toh K\u00e2ya Ch\u00ebno.\n3. Toh K\u00e2ya T\u00ebmerloh (at present vacant).\n4. Mahar\u00e2ja Perba (at present the \u00d4rang K\u00e2ya J\u00eblei holds this post).\n\n\u00d4rang B\u00ebsar dil\u00e2pan,\nClass II.\n\n5. Toh Muda Tunggal.\n6. Toh Jabe.\n7. Toh Bangau.\n8.

Toh L\u00ebla.\n11. \u00d4rang K\u00e2ya J\u00eblei.\n12. \u00d4rang K\u00e2ya L\u00ebpis.\n\nDistance travelled to-day, eighteen and a half miles; general direction, S.E. We passed the following villages on the way:\u2014Kampong Te, Tanjong G\u00e2tal, Tanjong Lindong, Pulau Did\u00e2ri, Ku\u00e2la P\u00ebdas, Kampong Ku\u00e2la S\u00eblan, Ku\u00e2la K\u00ebdundong.\n\nWednesday, 29th April.\u2014I think the Toh G\u00e2j\u00e2h must have been up all night, for he appeared at midnight and again at 4.30 A.M. We got up at 5.30 A.M., but could not make a start till 7 A.M. Then, with the Toh G\u00e2j\u00e2h and nearly 100 men, all armed as every one seems to be in this State, we started down the left bank of the river for Ku\u00e2la T\u00ebkam, a distance of one and a half miles, level walking but hot, for in Pahang, in this weather at any rate, light means heat and from daylight to dark one seems to be in a vapour bath. It was a curious sight to see in the Malay Peninsula buffaloes ploughing the slightly undulating plain of dry but not hard soil and more strange still to be told that the rice grain is then sown as wheat is in the West, the ground harrowed and no irrigation done whatever, the harvest depending simply upon the rain. These fields when fallow seem to grow no weeds, only a sparse short grass, and they are ploughed across and across like a chess-board several times before the wooden\nplough gets deep enough, then sown, harrowed, and nothing more is required till the time of harvest.\n\nThese fields have for many years yielded crop after crop under these conditions, and the only renewal or manuring of the soil is the annual small flood, which rises over even these high banks, and a higher flood which comes about once in six years and drives the people out of their homes into rafts. I should suppose that with this soil and three months rainless weather, cotton might be successfully grown.\n\nThe Sungei T\u00ebkam was almost dry, and whilst the Malays walked up the bed crossing and recrossing what little water there was, we were dragged up-stream in a dug-out for half a mile and then landing walked over a good level jungle-path for two and a half miles reaching K\u00f4ta Tongkat 8.35 A.M. This K\u00f4ta Tongkat is a curious sort of gate through which a river appears to have run, and it is flanked on both sides by high limestone cliffs covered with foliage; these cliffs appear to shut in a narrow valley, a mile long, at the far end of which is the cave K\u00f4ta K\u00eblanggi,* in reality, however, the valley is only rock-bound on the right hand side as you enter and the ancient river must have met this obstruction at K\u00f4ta K\u00eblanggi, been turned by it and, cutting along the face of these limestone cliffs, made its exit through the Kota Tongkat and thence found its way, probably by the channel of the Sungei T\u00ebkam, to the Pahang River. There is nothing specially remarkable about K\u00f4ta Tongkat, but since the river ceased to flow through this giant gate of stone, the action of the atmosphere has formed a number of stalactites which extend from the clear cut ledges of roof to the ground (no great distance) and these probably gave to the place its present name\u2014K\u00f4ta Tongkat.\n\nAfter a short rest here (the Toh G\u00e2jah having succumbed to the pace at which we came from the river), we walked up the valley until we reached the foot of K\u00f4ta Balei. Up to this cave we climbed by a ladder of forty steps and then found ourselves in a vast cave lighted mainly from the entrance and completely closed at the further end, but having three subsi-\n\n* See Mr. Cameron's account of his visit to these caves, No. 9 of this Journal, p. 153.\n\nEd.\ndiary caves or chambers, two on the right of the entrance and one on the left, each partially lighted by rifts in the roof. The main cave and the smaller chambers are all very fine, and reminded me of the S\u00e9l\u00e2ngor cave at Batu, though I do not think any of them equal in beauty or size that magnificent rock chamber.\n\nWe spent a considerable time in this K\u00f4ta Balei and then, descending the ladder, walked a few steps to the edge of the present insignificant stream where you find yourself facing a long, low and straight gallery with a straight, flat roof not less than twenty feet wide. This very remarkable passage with its wide flat roof only about seven to eight feet from the ground was cut by the river out of the solid rock before that ancient period when, for some reason not yet explained, the volume of water in the river became immensely reduced, or the original stream was diverted into some other channel leaving the results of the battle between the water and the rock in the form of the present caves, whence all trace of water has disappeared leaving only the evidence of its power as a constant source of admiration and wonder to the Malays of the country.\n\nAt the end of this gallery the rock has been hollowed out into a circular chamber of some height, while from the centre of the ceiling depends one enormous and strikingly beautiful stalactite. After luncheon, with lanterns and torches we explored the long dark cavern which extends into the hill from the back of this circular ante-chamber.\n\nThere is nothing to reward the explorer, but the place is infested by myriads of bats which are only with difficulty kept from striking you in their blind flight towards the lights. The masses of Malays in their many coloured dresses with the light of the torches shining on their weapons and swarthy faces, the deep shadowy gloom of the cave as a background, here and there faintly lighted by a ray from the distant entrance, made a scene very remarkable in its picturesque effect.\n\nWe left K\u00f4ta K\u00ealanggi at noon and reached our hut at Pulau T\u00e2wer in exactly two hours, after a very smart walk; the heat from Ku\u00e2la T\u00eakam to the village was indescribable, and the Ton G\u00e2jah was quite knocked up, taking refuge in a\nboat and shirking the last mile and a half. About 4 p.m. a heavy storm of rain fell and continued till late in the night. From 8 p.m. till 11 p.m. I talked politics with the Toh G\u00e2jah and Che Ali and then retired to the boat to sleep so that we might be able to start in the morning without delay.\n\nIt is worthy of record that this K\u00f4ta K\u00ealanggi is mentioned in the Sej\u00e2ra M\u00e2l\u00e2iu (the Malay Annals) as having been occupied by the Siamese. The Sej\u00e2ra M\u00e2l\u00e2iu is supposed to be the earliest written record of Malay History.\n\nThursday, 30th April.\u2014Did not get away till 7 a.m., Toh G\u00e2jah accompanying us. At 10 a.m. passed Batu B\u00fbrong, where the cave-making process may be very readily seen in the action of the Pahang River on a huge limestone rock which crops out from its left bank. It is said that there is a subterranean channel from the bottom of this cliff to a place many days' journey down the river. At 10.30 a.m. reached Pulau Burau, where there are said to be quantities of s\u00e9l\u00e1dang (wild cattle) in the wet season. In the line of the next reach of the river and straight ahead of us lie two remarkable isolated hills called B\u00fbkit S\u00e9nyum and B\u00fbkit Sah. These hills are said to be plainly visible from the sea and used by the fishermen as landmarks.\n\nAt noon reached Tanjong Blanja, the limits of Toh G\u00e2jah's jurisdiction, and here we stayed for one and a half hours breakfasting and then parted with the D\u00e2toh and continued our journey down river. The Toh G\u00e2jah has done everything possible for us. I gave him my P\u00e9rak g\u00f3l\u00f3k (chopping knife) and we parted excellent friends. I saw him in the river up to his waist saying good-bye to the Subadar.\n\nPassing Ku\u00e2la Krau, a river and kampong on the right bank, we reached Pulau Ch\u00ebngal at 6.20 p.m., and there camped for the night. Distance travelled, $17\\frac{3}{4}$ miles; general direction, South.\n\nThe following kampongs were passed during the day:\u2014Klang, Sungei Kio, Tanjong Antan, Tanjong T\u00ebnggoh, T\u00ebluk Maik, Sungei S\u00ebbul, Pulau Raya.\n\nFriday, 1st May.\u2014Left at 6 a.m. and passed a Chinese sugar mill at P\u00ebngk\u00e2len B\u00ebnom at 8.30 a.m.; subsequently we saw several of these mills on the left bank, they are driven by buffaloes, and the juice is expressed from the canes by pass-\ning them between three revolving circular blocks of wood in juxtaposition on the same horizontal plane. At 9.30 A.M. B\u00fbkit S\u00ebnyum appeared directly astern of the boats, which were then dropping down a long straight reach of the river. Passing P\u00e2sir Mandi, one hundred feet above the sea, we stopped at T\u00ebluk Sintang at noon for breakfast. The river here cuts deeply into the right bank forming a bay and making the width of the stream at this point very considerable.\n\nThe Bungau trees with their gorgeous purple flowers grow larger and more numerous as we descend the river, and the forest is everywhere strikingly beautiful. I saw a quantity of maiden-hair fern in the jungle to-day at our halting place, but it did not look like a new kind.\n\nLeft T\u00ebluk Sintang at 1.30 P.M., passed Ku\u00e2la S\u00ebmantan Ilir a little before 5 P.M., and reached Pulau T\u00ebmerloh at 6 P.M. Camped here for the night. Pulau T\u00ebmerloh, said to be half way between the Sultan's place and P\u00ebnjum, is an extensive kampong, admirably situated on the right bank opposite to a large island which here divides the stream.\n\nDistance travelled to-day, twenty-one miles; general direction, South. Distance from Ku\u00e2la Bernam, 300 miles.\n\nPassed the following kampongs to-day:\u2014J\u011bn\u010drak, Ku\u00e2la T\u00ebkai, L\u00eepat K\u00e2jang, Dor, Sanggang, Bintang, T\u00ebbing Tinggi, Balei Gantang and Bangau.\n\nSaturday, 2nd May.\u2014To-day the villages are larger, the river is wider though no deeper, and the banks are not quite so high. There must be a very considerable population of Malays settled on the banks of the Pahang, and its three large tributaries, of which the J\u011blei is undoubtedly the longest, and is properly called by the Malays the parent stream. We left T\u00ebmerloh at 3 A.M., and passed Gual, a large village on the left bank, at 9 A.M., reaching Tr\u00e2ng, kampong and tributary stream, at 10 A.M. Tr\u00e2ng is 88 feet above the sea. At Tr\u00e2ng the river was very shallow, and twice we had to drag our boat over the sand. Breakfasted at Ku\u00e2la Bra at noon, and leaving again at 2.30 P.M., reached K\u00ebrtau at 7 P.M., and camped there for the night. There is a hill called B\u00fbkit K\u00ebrtau on the right bank, and the place at present is chiefly remarkable for the enormous extent of sand which stretches between the left bank and the channel of the river. Under the right bank, however, there\nis a deep hole said to be infested by crocodiles, and these reptiles have dragged four or five people, sleeping on the sand, into the pool.\n\nWe passed the following villages and kampongs to-day, in the order named:\u2014P\u00e1sir Anam, Ber\u00e2leh K\u00e2pas, L\u00ebb\u00e2k B\u00e9l\u00ebngu, J\u00edlam, M\u00ebngk\u00e2rak, Tambak, L\u00fbbok P\u00e2rap, P\u00e2mun, Ch\u00ebru\u00eds, B\u00e2tu P\u00e2pan, B\u00e2tu Hanchor, L\u00fbbok Lien, Pulau K\u00ebnin, Sintang, L\u00ebm\u00fbse, Pulau Nyak.\n\nDistance travelled, twenty-five miles; general direction, North.\n\nSunday, 3rd May.\u2014It was intolerably hot and close last night, and having started the boats at 12.30 A.M., I tried in vain to sleep on the stern platform of my boat in spite of mosquitoes, and it was not till nearly 5 A.M. that sleep was possible.\n\nIt is hardly fair to complain of mosquitoes here, for though the statement that there are none in Pahang is no more accurate than that there are no snakes in P\u00e9ranak, yet there are comparatively few of these pests, in this dry weather at all events, and even after the occasional showers of rain we have had hardly any.\n\nWe stuck on a sand-bank for half an hour almost directly after starting, and passed Ch\u00ebno at 1.30 A.M. Ch\u00ebno is celebrated for making the best mats in Pahang. They are made of bleached and dyed M\u00ebngkuang leaves and are very pretty.\n\nFrom Ch\u00ebno we pushed on down some very long reaches, each two and three miles in length, and even more, usually with islands at intervals making an ever-changing panorama of beautiful pictures. Passed L\u00e2wan at 10 A.M., fifty-five feet above the sea, and at noon we stopped opposite B\u00fbkit Serlin for breakfast. Left again at 2 P.M., and passing Ku\u00e2la Luit, a river formerly worked for gold, we reached Terpei at 3.30 P.M. From here there is a good view of the high mountain called G\u00fbnong Ch\u00ebni, a long irregular triple-peaked mass of hills with a large lake, or series of lakes, at its base.\n\nG\u00fbnong Ch\u00ebni is seen on the right bank of the river apparently distant about five miles. The lakes are only approachable by a small river\u2014the Ch\u00ebni (almost dry in this weather), the mouth of which we passed at 4 P.M. The Malays have a great dread of these lakes, will not live near them, though they\nare full of fish, and say they are haunted by evil spirits.\n\nStopped for the night on the sands at Sungei Duri at 6.30 p.m., the last of the boats not coming up till 8.30 p.m. Sungei Duri is another place with a reputation for crocodiles. Che Ali's nephew was taken here two years ago, but was rescued by his cousin, though the crocodile injured him for life. In the sixteen hours we were travelling to-day, we made thirty-one and three-quarter miles, going at times in nearly all the directions on the compass, but mainly South.\n\nPassed the following places:\u2014Pulau M\u00e2lang, B\u00e2tu G\u00e2jah, Ku\u00e2la Jingka, P\u00ebs\u00e2gi, Tanjong B\u00e2tu, Ku\u00e2la J\u00ebmp\u00f4l, P\u00ebjin, T\u00ebmiang, Lam\u00eb, Ku\u00e2la M\u00ebnt\u00ebnang, G\u00e2long, L\u00fbbok Paku, B\u00e2tu R\u00e2kit, Ku\u00e2la T\u00ebm\u00eblong, Pulau Dato'.\n\nMonday, 4th May.\u2014Left Sungei Duri at 5 a.m. Stopped for two hours at Pinyo, thirty-nine feet above the sea\u2014Che Ali's kampong\u2014and made an unsuccessful search for peacock, but shot some golden plover. We have seen several peacock on the sands in the early morning, but they keep out of range of anything but a rifle. Passed Sungei M\u00ebnt\u00eega (whatever that may mean) at noon. This small stream, which flows into the Pahang River, not a day's journey from the sea, bifurcates and one branch, called Sempang, runs back towards the Rumpin river, a tributary of the Muar, so that by ascending the Muar and Rumpin rivers, crossing a few hundred yards of land and descending the Sempang, M\u00ebnt\u00eega and Pahang Rivers, or vice versa, the Peninsula can very easily be crossed in a comparatively short time.\n\nStopped at Batu Bu\u00e2ia for breakfast at 11.30 a.m., and continuing our journey at 2 p.m. reached Tanjong Pulei at 6.30 p.m. The river is here about one thousand yards wide.\n\nDistance travelled, eighteen miles; general direction, E.N.E.\n\nPassed the following kampongs to-day:\u2014Kinchi, Pulau Ubah, Pulau Plak, Ku\u00e2la L\u00ebpa, Pulau K\u00ebp\u00e2yang.\n\nTuesday, 5th May.\u2014Started at 2 a.m., and stopped at Gan-chong at 8 a.m. for an hour to allow the boatmen to breakfast. Gan-chong is only twelve feet above sea level. Che Ali went on from here in a small boat to tell the Yam T\u00fban of our whereabouts. At 1 p.m. reached Langger, a fine kampong on the left bank, where the whole population turned out to watch us breakfasting. Left again at 2.30 p.m., and reached Pulau\nKl\u00eadi, two miles above the P\u00ebkan, at 4.15 p.m. Here we waited, according to agreement, and in a short time Che Ali returned with Che G\u00e2doh and a message from the Yam T\u00fban to say that he was very unwell (consumption they say), and asking me to wait here till to-morrow to allow them to make proper preparations. We accordingly camped on the bank, and the tide falling left us ten yards of mud to cross to the boats.\n\nDistance travelled, eighteen miles; general direction, S.E. The river is about one thousand yards wide at this point, and the banks low, but covered with grass and jungle where there is no cultivation.\n\nUnlike the rivers on the West coast, there is no mangrove. To-day the banks were thickly populated, and we passed the following hamlets:\u2014Kampong Temai, Bl\u00fbker Acheh, Pulau Ganchong, Tanjong R\u00ebngas, Aur G\u00e2ding, Kampong T\u00ebluk, Sungei P\u00e2hang Tua, Ku\u00e2la Langger.\n\nThis sort of travelling may seem very easy and pleasant, but it has its disadvantages; for instance, at midnight I started for bed, seemingly no very difficult journey, and immediately stepped into a nest of the s\u00ebmut api, or fire ant, that is an experience that no one would care to repeat. A Sikh then carried me over the mud and deposited me up to my ankles in water in a dug-out and, with the assistance of that unstable conveyance, I reached the back of my boat somewhere in the depths of which a rat had died three days before. To get as far as possible from the pestilent stench of the decaying rat, I had had my mosquito net hung in the middle of the boat, and to reach that it was necessary to crawl through two doors, each two and a half feet by two feet, and over the body of a sleeping Malay, arranged seemingly to make one\u2019s progress as difficult and uncomfortable as possible. Then I faced my curtain to find the hole through which alone entrance can be gained, and which for the best reasons is not in the side but in the bottom of the curtain, next the side of the boat, i.e., with two inches of wood between it and the water. Through that hole I got by a series of gymnastic feats which no one would attempt in the light, and finally reached my goal to find the small mattress quite wet with the heavy dew, and the curtain simply wringing. Fifteen days in a boat four feet wide\nand only high enough to sit up on the floor, where the thermometer registers from $92^\\circ$ to $95^\\circ$ for several hours in each day, where rats, scorpions, centipedes, and other vermin abound, and where the crew are too close to be agreeable in this climate, is an experience which forces its drawbacks on the notice of the traveller, in spite of the loveliest scenery and situations which are often more picturesque than pleasant. One result of these circumstances is that, ever since we started, not less than twenty per cent. of our party have been on the sick list, the medicine chest has proved invaluable, and, considering how often its dangerous contents have been drawn upon, it is surprising that, with so much liberality and so little skill, no particular harm has been done. The man and woman who died of cholera were never under my treatment, I am glad to say, and since leaving Seger we have heard nothing more of cholera.\n\nWednesday, 6th May.\u2014Went ashore early this morning, and shot a couple of peacock and a brace of jungle fowl. It is certainly rather an astonishing sight to see peacock flying about or sitting on the dead stumps of an old clearing. I also saw a snipe, which is rather remarkable at this time of year and after such a drought; the ground he was in was hard and dry as a highroad. The tide is curious here, it was falling when we arrived at 4 p.m. yesterday, it fell a good deal lower, and at midnight some of our boats were high and dry; at 5 a.m. they were still in the same position, but at 8 a.m. the tide began to rise, and at 2 p.m. it was nearly up to the top of the bank.\n\nAt that hour, on the top of high water, four large barges appeared round the point which hides the Yam Tuan\u2019s place from us, and in a few minutes reached us. They were all crowded with rowers and chiefs who invited us to take our seats in the largest boat, a long two-storeyed barge with twenty-two rowers clad in yellow jackets, sarongs and white trousers. Half an hour\u2019s paddling carried us over the two miles of water, and we landed at the stairs in front of the Yam Tuan\u2019s house, an immense crowd of well dressed Malays lining the steps, the bank of the river and both sides of the road from the jetty down to the gate of the reception hall, where a double line of spearmen waited and conducted us to\nthe hall, a nicely decorated room raised on low pillars. Here the Datoh B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra, and D\u00e2toh T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong, the two Chief Officers of the State, received us with great ceremony, and telling us the Yam T\u00fban was far from well but wished to see us, invited us to sit down. Whilst we made our way from the landing place and greeted the B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra and T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong, a salute was being fired lower down the river.\n\nI carried on a spasmodic conversation with the B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra for one and a half hours, during which the Yam T\u00fban again sent to say he meant to come and see us, and then His Highness appeared. He certainly looked deadly ill, but he was just as courteous and nice as ever, and we all thought he looked a trifle better and spoke with less difficulty (his voice was hoarse and changed, and he complained of cough and fever) when we left him than when he came in.\n\nAfter I had told him of our journey, he asked us to have some coffee, &c., he and his son, a nice looking boy, joining in this part of the ceremony, and then I told him I should like to see him when he felt better and we left.\n\nSome of the Yam T\u00fban\u2019s people took us across the river to a raft which had been prepared for our accommodation. On the raft is a plank house containing one large room, very comfortably furnished, and a sort of verandah all round it has been planked over so that we can sit out and watch the busy river-life with the picturesque town and palm groves for a background. Another raft much larger than ours with an upper storey (but rapidly falling into decay) was handed over to our people, and a guard of twenty-two Malays were sent to see that no harm befell us! The B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra, T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong and others came to see that everything was in order, and then we were left to ourselves. In the night there was a tremendous storm of rain with thunder and lightning, but that was hardly so disturbing as the uproar made by the rats who live under the floor of our raft, a protest I suppose against our occupation of the tenement.\n\nThursday, 7th May.\u2014The Dato\u2019 Mantri of Johor called on me and we had a very long talk about Pahang and the other States.\n\nOn making up our itinerary, I find that we have come down the river two hundred and forty-one and a half miles from\nBuntu, and three hundred and ninety-five miles from Ku\u00e2la Bernam, while there remains another seven miles or so to the mouth of the river.\n\nThere is much to admire in this place. Specially striking to any one acquainted with the other Native States is the appearance of the village on the banks of this large river, here about fifteen hundred yards wide, with the picturesque house rafts moored not only along the bank of the river and in face of the Yam T\u00fban\u2019s various houses, but along the shores of the islands which here stud the stream.\n\nThese islands are the most beautiful feature of the place; they are large, covered with cultivation in the shape of palms, the cocoa-nut, betel and jagaree, or with flowering trees and shrubs and fine short grass. The raft we occupy is moored to the shore of one of these islands just opposite the new mosque of P\u00ebkan, and between us and the opposite bank of the river are three considerable islands with wide stretches of water in between.\n\nOn shore in the village there are four notable buildings\u2014the new mosque in the angle made by a small stream or canal coming into the river from the right bank; one hundred and fifty yards higher up a new brick house such as those occupied by Europeans in Singapore; one hundred and fifty yards further on, the old mosque, a building with far more to recommend it as regards appearance than the new one; and immediately to the right rear of the mosque the Yam T\u00fban\u2019s principal house, a building which, as far as I could judge, is as satisfactory in its accommodation as it is pleasing to the eye. This house, which was built without any plan, is said to have cost $25,000, and is worth the money.\n\nThe Yam T\u00fban\u2019s Balei or Audience Hall is an indifferent structure inside the enclosure of another and less pretentious house, which stands half way between the old mosque and the new one.\n\nThe business part of the village is of the most wretched description. Two small rows of the veriest hovels, built on either side of the main road, containing in all forty or fifty dwellings constitute the \u201cbazaar\u201d of the principal place in Pahang. As long as the customs of the country are such that Chinese don\u2019t find it to their advantage to settle here,\nthere is no likelihood of improvement in this respect. At the present time the Chinese population of P\u0113kan numbers about eighty, and when asked why that is so, they reply because the taxation, both in system and as including every article of import or export, is intolerable, and that if ever they import from outside, or buy in the interior anything of value, it is removed by some chief who forgets to pay for it. Chinese will put up with many evils and difficulties and much injustice that no European will tolerate, and while making every allowance for exaggeration, mistakes and wilful falsehoods, the fact that there are not more than two or three hundred Chinese in the whole of this large and rich State so close to Singapore is the best proof of how matters really stand.\n\nThis is the fourth time I have visited Pahang, and I have on this occasion had an opportunity of verifying some of the stories that have reached us in the last two years. Without proceeding to details, I can say that those whose experience of the Peninsula has been confined to the Protected Native States would be rather astonished at the manners and customs still prevalent in the governing class in Pahang and if Europeans will risk their capital in any large undertaking here and can manage to comply with their obligations, get business transacted, and obtain justice and satisfaction in their dealings with those they are brought in contact with, I think it will be a little surprising. It will also be well for them to remember that in a purely Malay State patience is not so much a virtue as a necessity.\n\nA good many wide and well selected roads have been laid out and formed, but not metalled, in and about the P\u0113kan; some fair bridges have also been constructed, and it seems as if, in any future arrangements for the housing of a large Chinese or other population, some new ground would have to be chosen for the site of a town, as there is none available upstream of the canal to which I have referred. Below that, however, land might be got and a town built with the advantage that large boats and steam-launches can get to this point and lie there while they cannot reach the mouth of the canal owing to the shallowness of the water.\n\nAll the ground about the Yam T\u016ban\u2019s house being already occupied, the best spot for dwelling houses is the island which\nlies opposite the Yam T\u00fban's principal dwelling. The whole country seems to be one vast level plain only a few feet above the level of the river, the soil is excellent and would probably grow any low-country produce, while swamps seem unknown, though I have no doubt the appearance of the place is different in the wet season.\n\nThe people of the country, outside the R\u00e2jas and Chiefs, with some few exceptions, are industrious for Malays, but their distaste for work may, to some extent, be explained by the fact that a man does not care to work for more than bare subsistence if his gains can always be appropriated by his more powerful neighbour. That, at least, is an explanation offered here and in other Malay States, especially where Siamese influence is strong. *Sic vos non vobis* might have been written of the Malay ryot.\n\nThe principal industries of Pahang are agriculture (the cultivation of rice and fruit), the rearing of cattle (especially buffaloes, which are very cheap here), sheep and poultry, a little gold-washing (but there are good reasons why this occupation is limited), and the manufacture of mats and silk cloth. The weaving and mat-making is done by the women, and the silk and mats produced are excellent of their kind, but very little known outside Pahang.\n\nThe present occupation of the ruling class in Pahang is top-spinning, and the example is pretty generally followed by all the unemployed male Malays in P\u00ebkan. There is not much to be said against this very innocent amusement, but it strikes the casual observer as curious that while the people of the Ulu (and indeed nearly every one outside this village) are crying out for the redress of manifest grievances and the introduction of something resembling fixed laws and fair government, those who have the direction of affairs devote to the spinning of tops the time that can be spared from less harmless distractions.\n\nIn many respects the State is unlike any on the western coast and more nearly resembles Kelantan in features and products. Pahang has undoubtedly great resources and unusual capabilities for supporting and enriching a large population and no intelligent person could see the country without regretting the circumstances which still keep it closed to\nlegitimate enterprise, whilst its people are unable to take advantage of the gifts lying ready to their hands.\n\nThe Map which accompanies this journal shows the route we followed from Ku\u00e2la Bernam in the Straits of Malacca, Latitude $3^\\circ 50'$, to Ku\u00e2la Pahang in the China Sea, Latitude $3^\\circ 44\\frac{1}{2}'$. The trace of the Bernam River has been taken from existing information, lately revised by Mr. F. St.G. Caulfield, also the land route from Ku\u00e2la Slim to Ku\u00e2la G\u00ebliting. From Ku\u00e2la G\u00ebliting on the Bernam to Buntu on the Lipis River is roughly sketched from a time and compass survey, the distances and general direction being fairly correct, but there is no attempt at accuracy. The sketch of the Lipis and Pahang Rivers is plotted from a time and compass survey made by Captain Giles, R.A., and in this case there is no pretence to accuracy, though it will probably be some years before a more careful survey is made of this river.\n\nSo far as I know, this is the first time the Peninsula has been crossed from sea to sea by a European from any point North of the Muar River, that is to say, in the wider part where the journey can only be accomplished by crossing the main range of mountains which forms the backbone of the Peninsula. I believe that Mr. C. Bozzolo crossed from the Galena mines in Patani to the mouth of the Muda River in Kedah, passing however North of the main dividing range.\n\nFourteen years ago I saw in Klang a Frenchman who told me he had three times crossed the Peninsula from Klang to Tr\u00ebngg\u00e2nu, but there are very strong reasons for doubting that statement.\n\nSome years ago Messrs. Daly and O'Brien ascended the Muar River, crossed a few hundred yards of dry land by portage and descended the Bra, a tributary of the Pahang River, having its embouchure about eighty miles above P\u00ebkan, while Mr. W. Knaggs, I am told, has just crossed by the Muar and Triang Rivers, the mouth of the Triang being a few miles further from P\u00ebkan than that of the Bra. The shortest crossing of all is said by the Malays to be by the Muar, Rumpin and Mentiga Rivers.\n\nWe have crossed the Peninsula by probably the longest route, unless the ascent of the Muda and descent of the Patani Rivers be longer and feasible. The Bernam river, the largest\nin some senses of those flowing into the Straits of Malacca, is the furthest North of those rivers which, rising in the main range, flow East and West to the Straits of Malacca, both the Krian and Muda Rivers being stated to take their rise in mountains other than the main chain. The Pahang River again is universally admitted to be the longest navigable river on either side of the Peninsula, and though we did not descend the centre or parent stream, the Jelei, there is probably not very much difference in navigable length between that and the Lipis, and there is no recognised crossing from the western to the eastern side of the range which would take the traveller to the head waters of the Jelei, nor any easily navigable river on the western side that would lead up to a point on the western slopes of the main chain opposite to the source of the Jelei. When it is considered that the measured distance on the map from Kuala Bernam to Kuala Pahang is, as the crow flies, one hundred and seventy miles, the route by which we have travelled covering a distance of four hundred and two miles ascending the largest river on the western side of the Peninsula and descending the longest on the eastern, may be considered fairly direct.\n\nThe Straits Government steamer Sea Belle arrived on the 7th, and as I was not able to leave and Captain Giles seemed to be seriously ill, I sent him on to Singapore in the Sea Belle on the 8th instant.\n\nMr. Lister and I remained at Pekan till the 14th May. In that time we saw something of the country in the immediate neighbourhood of Pekan, and had many opportunities of talking to Malays of all ranks on matters concerning Pahang. The Raja Muda of Pahang (brother of the Yam Tuan), who had arrived in the Sea Belle, landed on the 8th, and I had the pleasure of taking him to the Balei (Audience Hall) and seeing him reconciled to his brother. On two other evenings I had interviews with the Yam Tuan, and he took us to his principal house, and let us see the joget danced by ladies of his own household. I described these dances and the gamelan accompaniment in an early number of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. I noticed that on these occasions the company of onlookers was much more select than when I first saw the dances, but, as before, the\namusement was continued till nearly daylight.\n\nOn the 14th, at 1 p.m., the Yam T\u00fban, the R\u00e2ja Muda and all the Chiefs came over to our raft to bid us good-bye, the Yam T\u00fban with his usual generosity giving something to every member of my party. At 2 p.m. we left in the Sea Belle's launch and boats, while a salute was fired from some guns in front of the new mosque, and the Sultan's flag, which he had lowered on our arrival eight days before, was re-hoisted.\n\nThe tide had nearly run out when we started, and we only just managed to get the launch out of the river, reaching the Sea Belle (lying a long way out) at 4 p.m. We arrived at Singapore at 8 a.m. on the 15th.\n\nI cannot close this journal without remarking that, having journeyed through nearly all the Malay States, I have never met with elsewhere such courtesy as we experienced from all classes in P\u00e2hang. I could only regret my inability to make any adequate return for the hospitality and kindness of the Yam T\u00fban.\n\nIt is stated that the mouth of the P\u00e2hang River is unapproachable in the North-East monsoon and that P\u00e2hang is shut off from communication with the outer world (except by a few jungle paths across the main range of the Peninsula) for six months in the year. I cannot say whether that is true or not, but it is likely, and even in the best of weather no vessel of any size can get near Ku\u00e2la P\u00e2hang, while only steam launches of the lightest draught can, in the best weather, get up to P\u00ebkan at all times of the tide. There is, however, an easy way to open this rich country, and that is by the construction of a road, one hundred and thirty miles long, from Johor Bharu, exactly opposite the Johor end of the Singapore-Kranji Road, to P\u00ebkan. About seventy miles of this road would pass through Johor territory, and the rest through P\u00e2hang. A first class bridle-road could be constructed in eighteen months for less than $150,000, and it could at any time be widened into a cart-road or converted into a tramway or light railroad. This would put Singapore and its resources in direct communication with the lower country of Pahang, besides tapping a long stretch of land, both in Johor and Pahang, useful for the cultivation of low country tropical products.\nA town should be established at the junction of the Temelin and Pahang rivers, as a centre for the trade of the upper metalliferous country, while the present road from Kuala Lumpor (the terminus of the Selangor railway) to Ginting Bidei should be continued down the Pahang side of the main range to Bentong and Penjum, or some nearer point on the Pahang river. The cost of these roads would be insignificant in comparison with the advantages they would bring to Pahang, and in a lesser degree to Johor and Selangor; but if it were possible to get the work done under the present r\u00e9gime, it may be doubted whether those who now direct the affairs of Pahang would be able to utilize their opportunities for the best interests of the State.\n\nF. A. SWETTENHAM.\n\nPahang, 10th May, 1885.\nTHE OBJECT AND RESULTS OF A DUTCH EXPEDITION INTO THE INTERIOR OF SUMATRA IN THE YEARS 1877, 1878, AND 1879,\n\nBY\n\nM. A. L. VAN HASSELT.\n\n[The following paper has been translated from the French by Mr. R. N. Bland, C. S. The original will be found in the second Volume of the Proceedings of the Third International Geographical Congress (held at Venice in September 1881), published by the Italian Geographical Society. No account, it is believed, has been published in English of the Dutch Mid-Sumatra Expedition and, in the absence of an English version of their official reports, it is hoped that Mr. Van Hasselt and his companions will not object to the publication of this translation, which has been undertaken unavoidably without their consent being first obtained.\n\nEd.]\n\nA short time after the Commission of the Netherlands Geographical Society had decided upon a scientific expedition into the interior of Sumatra, I was, by virtue of my office, as Government \"Controleur\" at Soepajang, invited by the above-named Commission to take charge of one of the sections into which the expedition had been divided. Although convinced of the great difficulties of the task about to be entrusted to me, I thought it my duty not to refuse so honourable a mission.\n\nFrom February, 1877, to March, 1879, we remained in the districts that had been assigned to us, and though not able to apply \"Veni, vidi, vici\" to ourselves, we nevertheless collected a mass of details regarding the country, of which, on our return, it was our privilege to render an account.\n\nThose who are acquainted with the work in which are united the results of the Sumatra expedition, and which, thanks to the efforts of our Commission, has taken so high a place at this Geographical Congress, may have observed that our labours are not yet ended.\nWhile we were still occupied with our report, the Netherlands Society received an invitation from the Central Commission of this Congress, to send its representatives to the ancient City of the Doges. Amongst the delegates of our Society to this Congress where so many illustrious geographers and famous travellers were to meet, the honour of representing the Sumatra Expedition, fell upon two of its Members, Mr. D. D. Veth and myself. I was specially entrusted to explain in this place the object of the Netherlands Scientific Expedition into the interior of Sumatra, and the results arrived at.\n\nI would ask, at starting, to be allowed to refer to the published portion of the work compiled on the return of the Expedition, by its Members. I trust I may be permitted to state briefly what was known of the interior of Sumatra previous to our Expedition, and what has been done by us to extend this knowledge. Various circumstances had within recent years contributed to awaken attention to Sumatra, and our experience of the country and its people was called in to supply the existing gaps. Up to the end of the 18th century Marsden's book* was the only work comprising everything which at that epoch was known of Sumatra, but after that time, the scientific researches of several later travellers had accumulated knowledge and discovered new facts with regard to the Eastern Coast; these were most notably Junghuhn,\u2020 Van der Tuuk, Solomon M\u00fcller, A. H\u00f6mer, Van Oort and Korthals, Oosthoff, Teysman, Cordes, Ludeking, and lastly the Italian traveller Beccari. In the branch of geographical research, Beyerinck and Cluysenaer chiefly distinguished themselves, and in the region of topography and geology, the Engineers Van Diick de Greve and Verbeck. For Bencoolen and the Lampung districts we had the data of Major Steck, the travellers Du Bois and Zollinger, General K\u00f6hler, the philologist Van der Tuuk, and various public officials of Netherlands\n\n* History of Sumatra, London, 1783, 1784, 1811, 4\u00b0.\n\n\u2020 The titles of all works and articles in Reviews treating of Sumatra will be found at the end of a paper upon this Island by Professor P. J. Veth, reprinted in the Statistical and Geographical Dictionary of Netherlands India, Amsterdam, 1873, p. 777 et seq.\nIndia. Until Marsden's time the extent of the important kingdom of Palembang was little known, but the wars and military operations on a small scale which were the inevitable result of the collapse of the Sultanate and submission to the Netherlands authority, have, within the last half-century, increased our information with regard to this important country. To this the writings of Salmond, Presgrave, Court, de Stuerlee Praetorius, Gramberg, Teysman, Wallace, Mohnick and de Pruys Van der Hoeven have especially contributed.\n\nOn the North of Palembang, are situated the kingdoms of Djambi, Indragiri and Kampar, of which the first is reckoned as a dependency of Palembang. The second is tributary to the Sultan of Lingga and consequently considers itself as within the jurisdiction of the Riouw Residency, whilst Kampar, formerly part of the ancient kingdom of Siak, now acknowledges the authority of the Residency of the East Coast of Sumatra. This part of the interior had never, previously to our Expedition, been thoroughly explored, and of the two rivers\u2014Kampar, and Indragiri or Kouantan\u2014our specific knowledge was limited to their mouths and the immediate vicinity. The Residency on the East Coast embraced in 1873 the dependencies of the ancient Sultanate of Siak; after that date many now highly flourishing agricultural undertakings were established, chiefly at Deli and Langkat, and our acquaintance with this part of the island has thus been increased. Finally, the circumstance to which science is indebted for so much information with regard to the ancient kingdom of Acheen and its people, is no other, alas, than the long war with all its attendant evils, which is now said to be over,\u2014having led to a peace by no means assured, owing to the spirit of hatred existing amongst the vanquished. Sumatra now belongs wholly to Netherlands India. In reality, however, there is in the centre and on the East Coast, a large extent of country in which the rule of the Netherlands is still a fiction, but even there its influence has been daily extending for some years.\n\nThe Coast of Acheen in the North; Tapanouli and the West Coast, down to the borders of Mount Barisan; Benkoulen, the Lampong districts and Palembang to the South; the Coasts of Siak, Deli and Langkat to the N. E.\u2014these, gentle-\nmen, are the provinces now subject to our administrative system. Notwithstanding the researches of the travellers I have already mentioned, there remained a wide extent of country in the centre of the Island which was still, for the most part, if not entirely, *terra incognita*.\n\nThe maps of this region showed very inaccurately the configuration of the ground, the topography of the mountains, the courses of the rivers, the geological aspect and fertility of the soil, and the facilities for transport by land and water. With regard to all this and many other questions of ethnography, language and natural history, the works written upon Sumatra left the explorer painfully in the dark. Thus matters stood when our representative, Colonel Versteeg, conceived the idea of exploring these unknown regions.\n\nScarcely anything was known of the river, which, with its many affluents, traverses Djambi, except that its source lies south of the highlands of Padang, and a few other facts gathered in the interests of navigation. Djambi, the Sultan of which was a nominee of the Netherlands India Government, and where a Netherlands official acted as Political Agent, was looked upon as a dependency of the Province administered by the Resident of Palembang.\n\nDjambi was as much unknown to us as Central Africa was to our fathers. Nevertheless there was more than one reason for desiring more intimate knowledge. Most of the Central Districts were celebrated for the beauty of their scenery, their unequalled richness of soil and the industry and pleasant disposition of their inhabitants.\n\nIn 1869, after the existence of rich seams of coal on the banks of the Ombilin (the upper waters of the Indragiri) had been discovered by Greve, an Engineer, who died in the midst of his labours, serious efforts were made to provide means for the transport of this \"black gold.\" The country lying between the coal beds and the West Coast was explored by a band of engineers under the orders of M. Cluyseenaer. They published a large work and detailed maps, but though this was useful from a scientific point of view, the estimated cost of constructing and working a railway to the West Coast was so considerable, that there could be no hope of putting such an idea into execution. This, then, was one of the most\npowerful reasons for selecting this portion of the centre of Sumatra as the chief aim of the researches of our expedition. The more so, as the Government was willing to encourage travelling in all these countries, except Korintji, which, for political reasons, was closed to travellers. All the reports of the Government officials as to the attitude of the natives were favourable, and the Government itself gave full support to the undertaking of our Society by large contributions both of money and stores. The actual state of affairs, however, as we found afterwards, differed widely from what had been hoped for in Holland during the preparations for our expedition. Our companion, Schouw Santvoort, who afterwards died at Djambi, experienced this at starting, when making his perilous expedition across the island in a canoe; and when later we endeavoured to visit the petty states of Manangkabo, which divide the Netherlands territory in the highlands of Padang from the great kingdom of Djambi, we were obliged to beat a precipitate retreat owing to the hostile attitude of the Prince of Si Gountour;* and the news of the unfavourable disposition of the above-named States spread with such rapidity, that the Government thought it prudent to forbid our penetrating further into the States of Rantau, Barouk and Djambi from the west. We were therefore obliged to turn our steps towards the east. But there also, we soon discovered, when we endeavoured to explore the District of Limoun, a part of the Djambi territory, that all the original reports had been dictated by an unjustifiable optimism, and that even when a friendly chief lent us his support, the general feeling of the natives was too hostile to allow us to shew ourselves any longer without military escort, and still less, of course, to attempt any scientific researches.\n\n* Forbes, the Naturalist, two years later, failed to penetrate into Djambi. He was advised \"not to attempt to enter without the mandate of the Sultan,\" meaning not the Sultan recognised by the Dutch Government, but the previous deposed ruler, who had taken up his court in the interior of the country and whom all the Djambi people recognised. This was very disappointing, but I had fared no worse than the Dutch Mid-Sumatra Expedition, which, two years before, had been advised to turn back at that same place.\"\u2014Forbes Eastern Archipelago, 253.\u2014Ed.\nWhat then was the actual condition of Djambi? In 1834, the Netherlands Government had signed a treaty with the Sultan, who, no longer feeling himself able to cope with his discontented subjects, had made the first advances. But when in 1855, Ratou Ahmad Natsarouddin succeeded him, difficulties arose, resulting in a military expedition to Djambi, which, by an attack on the Kraton, drove out the Sultan. The Government appointed Sultan Ahmad as his successor, and was satisfied by erecting a small fort, in which a weak garrison was stationed, leaving the conduct of the new Sultan to be controlled by a Political Agent. The expelled Sultan, generally known as Soutan Taha, retired to the interior, where, fixing his residence at Telok Perdah on the Batang Hari, near the mouth of the Tabir, he managed to attract a number of followers.\n\nHis authority, though insignificant, was recognised by all the Chiefs along the Hari and its tributaries as far as the mouth of the Tembesi.\n\nSultan Ahmad, lacking the power to make himself respected, was obliged to submit to the existing state of things and to conclude a treaty of amity with his predecessor, by which the boundaries of the territory of each were fixed.\n\nMeanwhile, the resentment of Soutan Taha against the Europeans who had deposed him did not diminish, and he did not cease to incite revolt among all who could be considered friendly towards the Netherlands Government.\n\nThe unfortunate results of such a state of things were, as might have been expected, experienced by our comrades, who in a steam-launch were engaged in making a survey of the rivers; they were obliged to suspend their labours owing to the hostile attitude of the natives, who prevented their further advance. As I have already stated, the expedition had been divided into two parties, one of which was detailed to explore the highlands, the other to survey the river Djambi and its affluents. The leader of the latter was Mr. S. Schouw Santvoort, an officer of the Netherlands Navy, who, on his decease, was succeeded by Lieutenant C. H. Cornelissen. A steam-launch was placed at their disposal,\u2014a boat perfectly suited to the work in hand owing to its dimensions and its small draught of water. The other members of the\nparty were Mr. Makkink, the pilot, and Mr. Hermans, the engineer, afterwards succeeded by Mr. Snijdewind.\n\nAs for myself, I was at the head of the other party, assisted by the Civil Engineer, Mr. D. D. Veth, who was entrusted with the geographical, geological and meteorological investigations, as well as the preparation of negatives for photographs, and by Mr. Soh T. Snelleman, whose province was zoology in its higher branches. Ethnology and the study of languages fell to my share.\n\nIn summing up the results of our researches in this marvellous country, I will first deal with geography, as this subject, at a Geographical Congress like the present, should be given the first place.\n\nIt seems superfluous to explain the success which crowned the efforts of Messrs. Veth, Cornelissen and Santvoort; with the exception of quite a small portion, the courses of the Hari and its chief affluent, the Tembesi, were minutely surveyed. It was thus discovered that the Hari, on quitting the highlands of Padang, flows due North, whence it follows that the furthest point navigable for large boats, is much nearer to the coal mines of Ombilin than it appeared to be on former maps; so much so that the Hari is of as much importance, as a highway for the transport of minerals to the East Coast, as the river Indragiri itself. In surveying the southern part of the Padang up-lands it was discovered that the rivers Mamoun and Pottar belong in no way to the Kouantan basin, but are affluents quite distinct from the Hari. But most notably in the survey of Lebong was the inaccuracy of former surveys made apparent.\n\nThe mountains of the interior of Sumatra have been described with great exactness by Mr. Veth in the 2nd part of our work, which also contains all the geological and meteorological records. The large collection of photographs of the country and of the people taken by him, are assuredly not the least part of the labours which have helped to extend our imperfect knowledge of Sumatra and its inhabitants. Again, amongst the things which we were enabled to bring back with us, I must mention an ethnographical collection* of more\n\n* This collection is placed in the Royal Ethnographical Museum at Leyden.\nthan 500 objects, almost the whole of which have been reproduced in the 3rd part of our work. We trust that they will give a true idea of the life and customs of the Malays, set forth as they are in thirteen chapters of our ethnographical description. In my linguistic researches, I set myself as much as possible to note words and to collect manuscripts.\n\nAs to these latter, I frequently had them read and explained to me, in order to learn the real meaning and the proper pronunciation of words. The difficulties I had to overcome will be evident to all those who will take the trouble to examine the word-lists of the Rawas and Lebong (known as the Redjang) dialects, and the songs, puzzles and proverbs which I gathered from the lips of the people themselves, as well as the Manangkabo, Mouroi-Batou and Touankounan Tjeredeg manuscripts. Besides, I was fortunate enough to gather complete information about the figure-characters of the Rentjoung as well as the method of spelling and writing them.\n\nThis figure-writing owes its name to the manner in which the words are engraved with the point of a knife upon strips of bamboo.\n\nI was, on several occasions, able to gather interesting information with regard to the aborigines of this part of the country\u2014the Koubous\u2014and I am in a position to state this curious fact, viz., that their language, which at the first glance appears to differ entirely from Malay, appears on closer investigation to be almost the same language as that of the Malays who inhabit the Koubou district. Only, the pronunciation of the Koubous is harsher, and their peculiarity of expression takes the form of a dialect.\n\nWe were lucky enough to obtain some valuable botanical specimens, and some other fortunate finds go to show that our researches were not altogether fruitless. But most remarkable of all were the results of our zoological investigations. We brought back 30 mammals, 285 birds, 173 reptiles and amphibians, 385 fish, 5 to 6 thousand insects, including 323 species of lepidoptera, and a large number of molluscs.*\n\n* The greater part of this collection is now in the Royal Museum of Natural History at Leyden.\nAmongst these animals, there are many new species, especially amongst the insects of which many species had never previously been observed in Sumatra. Looking at this large number of animals collected in a comparatively short space of time, one might be led into the mistake of supposing that the formation of such a collection would be an easy matter. Without counting the difficulty of preparing and packing up most of the specimens, the very hunting for them was attended with many obstacles, and involved great loss of time. The richness of the tropical fauna has passed into a proverb, not without reason, but like most treasures, it must be sought after out of the beaten track, and it is only little by little that the paths leading to the hidden treasures of nature are to be discovered.\n\nIn giving the preceding resum\u00e9, I have accomplished the task allotted to me, but permit me now to introduce you in imagination, for a few moments at least, to the countries visited by my companions and myself at the time that we traversed these uncultivated regions, deeply impressed with their unique beauty. I will choose those pages of our journal which describe our ascent of the peak of Korintji, or Indrapura, the highest mountain in Sumatra, and one of the highest volcanoes in the Indian Archipelago. We were in the country of the \"twelve kotas,\" a district bounded on the S.W. by the above-named mountain, and as before ourselves no European, and still less any native, had ever attempted the ascent, the preparations for our departure occupied some space of time. Our first idea was to take with us native carriers, called koulis, but as it was too risky to set out with our necessary baggage without knowing anything about the nature of the ground, or even if it were possible to reach the summit, we took the precaution of sending some explorers on ahead as an advance-guard. The superstitious nature of these people, however, so excited their imagination that they returned to us with all sorts of extravagant stories of the inaccessible rocks they had seen, and the fearful monsters they had met. A second attempt on their part was more successful, and although uncertain as to being able to reach the highest point, we set out on the 5th December, 1877, full of ardour and determination. Besides\nthe coolies, we were accompanied by the two guides who had conducted the exploring parties, and by the Touankou of Dourian Taroung, an intelligent chief, with two of his followers. Each kouli carried 8 chupaks (4\u00bd kil.) of rice, whilst the two guides and the chief's followers carried between them 40 chupaks. Besides rice, each had to carry a part of the baggage necessary for such a long stay in the jungle: firstly, our camp-beds, and klambous, or mosquito curtains, articles not less indispensable than a change of clothes in case of rain; some simple cooking utensils, and some tinned provisions, to afford a change in our principal diet, viz., rice; these constituted our equipment, together with the other part of our baggage, consisting of instruments for making geographical and atmospheric observations, whilst those necessary for the collection of plants and animals were not wanting, and finally 2 chairs and some guns and ammunition completed the whole. Every portion of our baggage was carefully wrapped up in tarpaulins, which, fastened together, served as a roof for our shelter at night. Clad in the simple dress suitable for a wandering life in these wild regions, we set out, and our first task was to clear a path with our wood-knives for the koulis. These carriers, who, in Sumatra, are accustomed to carrying their burdens on their heads, would never have been able to get along in the small space sufficient for persons not laden, and would have been liable every moment to get caught in the lianes and thorny branches spreading out in every direction overhead, if the guides had not formed a regular bed, so to speak, for the long line of koulis following them. We were soon obliged to quit the path on account of the unfavourable nature of the ground, and to continue our march along the bed of a river, a change which considerably diminished our speed and compelled our koulis to drop a long distance behind. When we left the water to take again to dry land, our first care, while waiting for the koulis to rejoin us, was to look around to see if there was anything worth carrying off. We perceived an object which we were far from expecting to find in such a place, namely a human skull, which projecting out of the water was gazing at us with hollow orbits. Approaching, we discovered the thigh bones belonging to the same individual,\na Malay, who two years previously had been banished from his negari on account of leprosy. Ten souke of rice had been set apart for him, and he had betaken himself in this direction provided with an axe, a chopper, a wallet containing tobacco and sirih, and a flint and tinder. Thus equipped, he had begun to climb the great mountain, the Peak of Korintji in order to seek among the mountain-spirits a cure for his frightful malady.* He may, perhaps, have reached the summit, but it would seem that the spirits did not grant his wish. Though it may seem inhuman to treat fellow creatures in this way, we must remember that the instinct of preservation, in countries where the population is too often decimated by epidemics, leads easily to measures of this kind. We perched the skull, blanched by the alternate action of air and water on the end of a pole by the riverside, so as to find it easily on our return, feeling sure that no one would come in the interval to dispute with us this strange product of the soil. We followed the path which led from the stream towards the mountain slopes, and which was nothing but a broad track formed by elephants and rhinoceroses. This brought us at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon to Timbouloun. There, we found such an excellent resting place for the night, amidst a conglomeration of projecting volcanic rocks, that we resolved not to push on further, and all the more so because the koulis were still far behind. It was only an hour afterwards that the first arrived, and as their number gradually increased, we had to listen to confused accounts of the difficulties they had undergone, and the misfortunes they had met with.\n\nThe short time remaining before sunset was occupied in following up for a bit the course of the river, and not far from our encampment, we came across a stream, the limpid water of which dashed down from a height of 20 feet between\n\n* Among Malay races mountain-tops are resorted to as places of seclusion and penance, as being the abode of powerful spirits.

The water dripped ceaselessly from trailing creepers and from the rocks which overhung the cataract. Everything around was damp, the air chill, and the silence, which weighed like lead upon the whole scene, was unbroken, save for the monotonous noise of the falling drops. In the meantime some of our koulis began to cut down young trees and branches, and to drag them to the place where we intended to form our bivouac. The lopped branches formed the supports of our dwelling-place, which, thanks to the natural shelter we had found, was for once quickly enough put up, and in which, besides our baggage, there was space enough to lodge our followers. A little distance on our left, a large fire was lighted at which our cook busied himself in preparing a meal as frugal as it was welcome. A second fire was lighted in front of the hut, its tall flames casting such fantastic shadows around that we had no fear of being disturbed by any wild beast. After long marches, such as we made nearly every day of our expedition, one is not much disposed to prolong the evening after having dined. The conversation soon begins to flag, and the slightest hint is sufficient to convince the company of the advantage, nay the necessity, of going to rest. We found this to be so, and whilst the koulis were, according to their custom, squatting round the fire engaged in animated conversation, we were stretching our wearied limbs on our camp-beds, which though very simple, made a much more comfortable bed than the bare ground. The next morning we made haste to continue our journey, and just allowing enough time to cook a few handfuls of rice, which with ship's biscuit formed our breakfast, we were on our way by half-past 6 o'clock.\n\nWe still followed the track formed by the pachyderms, which led us upwards to the north of the mountain. We advanced very slowly, having continually to clear the path of fallen trees, and twisted creepers.\n\nWe marched in front with the guides, and towards 11 o'clock we arrived at a hut which had previously sheltered them, but which we could not now make use of, on account of its distance from any water we could drink, and also because our day's task was by no means done. At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon we came to the last hut occupied by the guides,\nrather more favourably situated by reason of its proximity to water. We commenced at once, therefore, to establish ourselves there, and after we had cleared and levelled a space of 6 m\u00e8tres long by 2 broad, we put up a long shed or pondok.\n\nI will not weary you with a too detailed account of our undertaking. Suffice to say that after several fruitless attempts to push forward, we resolved on the 7th December to leave our koulis behind with the baggage, and to endeavour ourselves, each escorted by two men with axes, to reach the summit by different routes.\n\nOn the 8th of December, about half-past twelve, I was only about 200 m\u00e8tres from the summit, when my guide, stumbling over a loose stone, fell on his face. Turning round, I found him sitting on a rock, his mouth was bleeding and his knee and arm were bruised. At this moment a violent peal of thunder, with at least a hundred reverberating echoes, broke over our heads. My guide instantly began to urge a return. \"Let us go back, Tuan, since we know the way. It is beginning to get dark and we are going to have heavy rain.\" A second thunder-clap, as loud as the first, sounded almost as he spoke.\n\n\"The mountain is angry,\" he continued \"do not let us wait longer.\" Looking up towards the summit where a short time before a picturesque crest of jagged rocks had stood out above the gravel slopes of the mountain, I could perceive nothing but a black and threatening cloud. There was nothing for us but to return. But this was not so easy, the stones which previously had seemed so solid, broke away every moment under our feet, bringing down others in their fall.\n\nArriving at the spot where we had quitted the forest, we resolved to follow up the course of the river as well as possible as far as the cataract just above our hut. In this we succeeded, and at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon we reached our bivouac.\n\nOn the sixth day after leaving the plain, we at last got to the top. It was on my hands and feet that I climbed the last part, and the view that then met my eyes made me start back with surprise, what I had taken for the top was but the narrow rim of a yawning crater with precipitous sides. More\nthan 1,000 m\u00e8tres below, water and sulphur were seething and giving off vapours, which filled the cavity for moments at a time, and then lifted so as to reveal to us the whole bottom of the abyss. This floor presented a sandy surface, with lakes of sulphur here and there, easily recognisable by their yellow colour, and a number of small arteries connecting them. To my right and left the cliffs were more elevated, and prevented my seeing the surrounding country, leaving only a view of the summits of mountains in the distance. Notwithstanding the grand spectacle presented by the high lands of Padang, I could not, but express a feeling of disappointment at our situation, for I saw that it would be very difficult to make our way round the lofty and rugged edge, whose exterior slope, at an angle of not less than 45\u00b0 was composed of such loosely holding shingle, that a single step was sometimes enough to send immense stones rolling down the precipice.\n\nA few moments later M. Veth rejoined me, and after having satisfied himself that the rocks on our right were absolutely inaccessible, he proceeded to try and discover, more to the south, a spot level enough to set up the tripod rest of our telescope, by means of which we were to observe the surrounding country. After a quarter of an hour's climb he called for the instruments; the Mandor, or head of the koulis, with his men, advanced a few steps, but then sat down, declaring that they were giddy. Only two coolies ventured to follow me to the spot where my companion was waiting. Climbing over sharp rocks, we at last reached a level space of a few m\u00e8tres. Our observations, however, had to be very brief, for big clouds collecting on all sides hindered all exploration. To the S. E. towards the Gounoung Toujouk (seven mountains) we noticed a large lake shut in by serrated peaks, forest clad. In bygone ages this mountain, had evidently been a gigantic volcano, such as the Peak of Korintji at the present day.\n\nN. W. from the foot of the Gounoung Toujouk, the first rice fields of Korintji are situated on the banks of a considerable torrent. These fields were flooded and shone in the sunshine like polished plates of metal. Lastly, when a big cloud suddenly intercepted our view, we noted the state of the\nbarometer and the thermometer. The first indicated 495 millim\u00e8tres, the second 7\u00b08. C. On the following day we succeeded in reaching the highest summit of the mountain.\n\nWe had been forced to send back five coolies who had broken down, and even the Chief of Dourian Taroung himself was obliged to leave us through illness. As our provisions were sensibly diminishing, and we were afraid that the rest of the coolies would not be able to stand the fatigue and cold much longer, we decided to return.\n\nI must not quit this subject without making some observations upon the character of the fauna and flora of this volcano, which rises to a height of 3,600 m\u00e8tres.\n\nAs far as the place where we spent the first night, the forest generally resembled those we had already so often traversed, containing a considerable number of large trees linked together by strong creepers and heavy rotan-manau. The kal\u00e9 rises side by side with the waringin, the sacred tree of the Hindoos, the koubang, the sianouk, or milk-tree, with its white bark, and the wild kabau or kapok. The undergrowth consists of large-leaved bamboos, with knotted stems which interlace in every direction, of the dahun katari, much used in Malay households, of the balunking with its edible flowers, and a large variety of ferns and grasses.\n\nAdvancing upwards, towards our second halting place, bamboos were replaced by varieties of pouar, whilst along the river banks the djombou-ajar were met with, and further on, in the jungle, meranti and other straight-stemmed trees. At this elevation rattan is still common enough, but as in the case of the lianes, it is finer and weaker than in the lowlands.\n\nAscending higher still, the trunks of the various species of the kali, and the djirah-pidang diminish in size, and we notice that they are twisted, knotted, and covered with different kinds of moss. The rattans and climbing plants become more and more rare, grasses take the place of the pouar, to be replaced in turn by the thick-stemmed pakou-rasum, a species of fern which, together with other volcanic plants, is found right up to the summit.\n\nAbove a height of 2,500 m\u00e8tres, no trees worthy of the name are to be met with, but various kinds of flowering, or\nsweet-smelling shrubs, such as the *lawang*, the bark of which has an odour of orange-flowers, as also the flowers, the leaves, and the fruit of the *sarikmandjari*, a number of sharp edged grasses, and several graceful species of nepenthe. At the highest point, which exceeds 3,000 m\u00e8tres, wherever a little vegetable soil is collected in corners of the porous rock, are to be seen, besides the plants already mentioned, the *lobak* with its yellow flowers, and the *tjapo-gounong*, whose little white flowers and pointed velvet leaves remind us of the Edelweiss of the Alps. I will not go into the question as to whether the presence of these plants proves the fertility of the soil, but it is certain that the soil of the gentle slope to the east and to the north-east of the Peak, is singularly rich, and perfectly suited to agricultural enterprise.\n\nIn digging the ground for the foundations of our hut, as well as in places where landslips had occurred, I ascertained that the vegetable soil was in places more than a metre in depth. But in order to obtain satisfactory results from the cultivation of this district, it would first of all be necessary to supplement its present scanty population with a supply of labourers from Hindostan, Java, or elsewhere.\n\nThe result of our observations of animal life, after leaving the foot of the mountain, may be stated in a few words. The large animals did not show themselves, which indeed they rarely do, for in the depths of these vast forests animal life seems extinct. The tracks of the rhinoceros were only met with up to a height of 2,000 m\u00e8tres, those of the elephant not beyond 1,500 m\u00e8tres; wild chamois frequent the inaccessible rocks, and choose out those crevices and grottos which by their projections afford them cover from the wind and rain. Up to the very top we found tracks and droppings of this *antilocarpus sumatrensis*. With regard to insects, we remarked at the summit, some bees, gad flies, some small black insects under stones, and here and there a butterfly. We also met with a species of brown pigeon, perhaps the *Treron Nasica*, and some smaller birds with green wings and red heads. Leeches were only perceived up to a height of 1,300 m\u00e8tres, while spiders, especially those of the family of *Lycocides* do not go higher than 3,000 m\u00e8tres.\nWe came down the mountain much more slowly than we had gone up. Still the rate at which we were going prevented us from bestowing sufficient attention on the natural features by which we were surrounded, and on the peculiarities of the mysterious forests in which the struggle for existence is ceaselessly going on\u2014a struggle which man is often unable to explain.\n\nWhat a delightful feeling it is to reach, at the close of day, an open space where one can give oneself wholly over to the repose and comfort of a bivouac. Many of these places will remain indelibly in our memories. Thus on the evening of the 5th October, we arrived at Sungai Sapi, a most picturesque spot. Our people were already busy putting up a shelter for us under the river bank. The banks rose sheer up both sides, leaving only a clear view of the water up and down stream. Our hut was quickly built on the stony soil of the upper part of the river-bed, which was then dry. Soon the fire for preparing our repast was lit, whilst near at hand resounded the axes engaged in felling the trees destined for building our pondok or hut. All around is movement, not, however, to be of long duration, for as soon as the strictly necessary labour is over, everyone makes himself as comfortable as possible, in order to make the most of this charming resting-place.\n\nLet us take the trouble to more minutely examine the ground around us. By the path leading to the river, and at a short distance from it, we notice coffee-bushes, durians, mangosteens, and jambu-trees. It is evident that these are not forest trees, but are the living remains of a village, which, like so many others, has disappeared. Not a house whose inhabitants might have told us their story has been left standing; nothing has survived but these few fruit trees which nature will reclaim in like manner, so as to completely wipe out every vestige of the past.\n\nTo our left, the river flows slowly over a bed of stones, and not far away is hidden from us by a bend.\n\nOn our right hand the scene is very different. The water flows impetuously and dashes itself down from a high rock into a deep basin, falling in a broad sheet with a continual roar, like an avalanche of pearls, and bringing with\nit an icy current of air. It would be impossible to imagine a more picturesque bit of water scenery than this natural basin. As long as the day-light lasted we made notes, or arranged the collections made during the day.\n\nThe approach of night forced us to give up our work, and we placed our chairs at the water's edge enveloping ourselves in fragrant Havana smoke. The subdued effects of twilight are unfortunately unknown in these countries. It is as though the sun were in haste to hide himself, and in this enchanting spot the night fell suddenly and covered all our landscape with its black veil.\n\nThen almost at once we heard the leader of the insect orchestra take up his office, and with a diabolic note give the signal to begin. The light of phosphorescent cock-chafers shine fantastically amidst the trees, bats flit like shadows around our resting-place.\n\nThe koulis, who have lighted a second fire on the other side of the hut, are squatting round it, intercepting the light, which thus falls only on a portion of the river and hardly reaches the distorted tree-roots which a land-slip has exposed on the opposite side.\n\nOur rice will soon be ready; our old cook is giving it his whole attention. Clad only in a pair of trousers, he is sitting cross-legged and is with imperturbable gravity stirring his rice with a long spoon. His whole figure is stiff, severe, and rigid, as though it were carved in wood. Of the Malays seated between us and the fire, we can only distinguish the outlines, whilst every feature of their companions who are sitting opposite to us is vigourously brought out by the red gleams, produced by the light of the flaming wood upon their browned faces and bodies. And while they rest themselves, smoking their cigarettes, they listen attentively to one of their number who is telling the history of some previous excursion. Doubtless, nowhere does nature offer more splendid spectacles than in these distant forests. There is no monotony, on the contrary, an infinite variety. Sometimes the surroundings inspire us with calm, at other times we are awed by the stern force with which nature works out her ends. The aspect of water rushing downward from the mountains with ever increasing impetuosity,\ntearing a way for itself through and over the most colossal and massive rocks, is truly terrific.\n\nAnd what shall we say regarding the fine layer of earth, which covers the rock, and which, although often not more than a few centim\u00e8tres in depth, yet nourishes and gives its vital forces to a forest of gigantic trees, of brushwood and lianes infinitely varied, and wearying the imagination with their diversity of form and colour?\n\nOur European forests cannot be compared with the flora which Sumatra presents to our astonished eyes. Gigantic trees strike their tenacious roots into the earth, or project them into the air, as though nervously defending themselves against the attacks of assailants.\n\nIn straight lines and fantastic curves, branches, leaves, trunks and roots, twist in and out disputing for nourishment; here lianes attach themselves like tightened ropes to the trees, or else twist in spirals round a young tree, whilst there, they are poised without support, cork-screw fashion. What is the meaning of this spiral without a prop? The victim which it formerly entwined, succumbed to its stifling embrace and fell into dust, leaving only the fatal knot which had strangled it. No plant can grow without a struggle: parasites are everywhere, on the bark, on the branches, on the leaves. It may easily be understood how hard it is to recognise the parent amidst this chaos; the parasites climb from branch to branch, until the last leaf disappears, and the last twig, bending beneath their weight, succumbs, and hangs like the powerless arm of a vanquished man. And all this luxuriant verdure, striving to climb on high in order to enjoy the sparkling sun-light, twists about and forms an inextricable network, which only the wood-knife and the axe can unravel. The rattan winds about like a snake between the most delicate stems as well as between the thickest trunks, and rears its spiny head, like a plume, amidst the tops of the loftiest trees.\n\nFrom time to time a bamboo grove presents an agreeable change to the eye. The large stems spring forth majestically, to fall afterwards in graceful curves; sometimes the path is blocked by a fallen tree, which in its heavy fall has dragged down a whole plantation with it, while crushing a\nportion of the forest opposite. Knowing that time with his inevitable scythe will put all things in order, the native in such a case avoids the obstacle, goes round it, and clears himself a new path which rejoins the old one further on.\n\nGloomy obscurity and heavy silence weigh upon these forests, never visited by Europeans, and seldom by Malays. At midday, surrounded by native followers, there should be nothing to alarm one in such a place, nevertheless one lifts one's head with a shudder, when the mysterious stillness is broken by a falling leaf, fluttering down and grazing the tree-branches, or by a loosened stone rolling down a ravine. It is the influence exercised by this tropical nature.\n\nThus in a framework of verdure, the torrent rolls down from rock to rock with foam whiter than snow, until, become at last a cataract, it sways the broad leaf of the pisang, as easily as the lace-like fern. The basin into which it is ever pouring its limpid water contains myriads of shining fish, which find nourishment in the fruit which the torrent brings down with it. And when chance rays of sun-light manage to pierce the dome of verdure, then one's eyes are greeted with a splendour of tints and colours, which one must have seen before one can admit that it is impossible to describe them.\n\nBut other surprises are in store for us in these wild localities. When after marching for several hours, or rather jumping from stone to stone in the bed of a river, one enters the forest, one is struck by the incredible mass of dead leaves which one meets with, and which form a fertile soil for the trees from which they have fallen. All these leaves are covered with a mildew as glossy as silk, delicate as a spider's web, and white as snow, standing out against a dark background. Indeed one is afraid to make a step lest one should destroy in an instant these works of art of such inimitable delicacy and elegance. In the midst of these is enthroned the Giant of the Forest, the malaboumei, a tree whose trunk is a metre and a half in diameter, and which rears its majestic head straight overhead at a height of 100 feet.\n\nIt is natural that one should be singularly impressed by this contrast, or rather by these extremes which meet, as the proverb says, like the first and last pages of a treatise on Botany placed side by side.\nThe tree-trunks are covered with many species of plants, belonging, it is true, to the same family, but varying infinitely in their development. Here are rattans twining round a tree like the boa round its prey. There the akar lamboutou thick as man's arm grows side by side with the rotan emboun as fine as thread.\n\nAs has already been remarked, few large animals are met with in these regions. Sometimes one hears the shrill note of the argus pheasant. Occasionally a monkey is visible leaping and swinging from one branch to another. But as far as the smaller animals are concerned, an attentive explorer may observe much. Amongst insects, we found many whose only means of defence lay in their disguise, creatures which so much resemble, in form and colour, the earth and the plants amongst which they live as to be mistaken for them. They must have had many enemies to be obliged to assume this disguise in order that their species may preserve its vitality.\n\nBefore ending this narrative, I must touch upon the charms which night offers amidst these forests. Hardly has the darkness set in and the stars begun to gleam through the leafy roof than the forest is lighted up by a thousand fires which, at first stationary, seem to be resting in the tree tops in order to afterwards take flight in graceful curves, and at last be lost to sight, like shooting stars.\n\nEven the leaves, the dead twigs, the very soil itself, seem to give forth a phosphorescent radiance. This formless mass covering the earth, which but lately impeded our march, is now enveloped in a mysterious light; we might describe it as an enchanted garden, like those of the Arabian stories, if this simile were not worn threadbare.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this fairy-like scene is marred by the music of cicadae, which far from producing the harmonious sounds which would be appropriate to une belle nuit fantastique, assail our ears with piercing cries, uttered with demoniacal strength and a pertinacity only to be paralleled by the bass notes in this impromptu concert which are supplied by the mountain torrent.\n\nSuch are the sights that nature unfolded to us in Sumatra. It will easily be understood that we shall not readily forget them.\nFURTHER NOTES ON THE RAINFALL OF SINGAPORE.\n\nFIVE years ago I had the privilege of submitting a few notes on the rainfall of Singapore, which appeared in No. 7 of this Journal. I now purpose to add a few more remarks on this interesting study.\n\nIn the last notes above referred to, the registers of two places only were taken into account, viz., those of the old criminal Prison between Brass Bassa and Stamford Roads, for the rainfall in Town, and Mr. Knight's on Mount Pleasant, Thompson Road, for the country; but in 1880, on the removal of the Criminal Prison to its new locality, the former was discontinued, and later on Mr. Knight changing his residence the latter also.\n\nIt, therefore, became necessary to take a more general view, and a table has been prepared of the Mean Annual Rainfall of Singapore as observed at present at seven stations, which, through the kindness of Dr. Rowell, Principal Civil Medical Officer, Straits Settlements, in permitting me to have access to the records, I now have the pleasure of submitting, together with charts shewing the ranges of the Mean Annual Rainfall, and Rainy Days since 1869. It will be an easy matter to continue these charts, say at intervals of five years, and thus arrive at some idea of the law of the rainfall of Singapore.\n\nMr. Skinner in his article on \"Straits Meteorology\" (No. 12 of this Journal), is of opinion that it is \"not too early to endeavour to obtain some results from the series of Rainfall returns\" now to hand, and has ventured to connect certain outbreaks of cholera, beri-beri, &c., with the rainfall. The concluding paragraphs of that article are very hopeful and promising. The chart accompanying this paper apparently bears out his anticipations that \"an excess of rain may be looked for in the years 1884-85,\" for the line is an ascending one; but it requires the tracings of a few more years to get a clear knowledge of the rhythm of the alternations of periods of lesser and greater ascents before\nthe corresponding fallings. For instance, the chart shows a sudden fall in the amount of rain for 1871 and 1872, with a slowly increasing rise up to 1875, followed by a still lower fall in 1877 (the lowest recorded). In 1878 there is almost double the rainfall of 1877, rising still higher in 1879, from which period down to 1883, the annual rainfall was steadily decreasing, but in 1884 it again ascended, and may ascend further if Mr. Skinner's conclusions rest on a sound basis.*\n\nThe continuous and steady improvements in the sanitary condition of Singapore town and suburbs within the last eight years have been so marked, that it would hardly be fair to draw conclusive inferences from the old returns of health by comparing them with those of recent dates, and attributing any differences to the rainfall. For instance, when cholera broke out as an epidemic in 1873 (having been in the first instance imported from Bangkok where the disease was raging virulently) Singapore was suffering badly from want of water, the season was unusually dry, nearly all the wells such as they were\u2014many being mere pits a few feet deep without any protective wall\u2014had almost run dry, the brick conduit for bringing the water from the impounding reservoir was a failure, as the water could not rise in the aqueduct over the canal, so that the poorer people resorted to the filthy canal water when the tide had ebbed. The largest number of cases of cholera occurred in the vicinity of that canal commencing from the Lunatic Asylum, which suffered severely, extending to Kampong Kapor, which was a regular hot-bed for developing, continuing and spreading the disease, and terminating at Rochor. There were also some cases of cholera from Kampong Malacca and the crowded parts of the\n\n* It is certainly well to wait until we have a larger series of annual returns before generalising on such a matter too positively; and this branch of the subject is only touched upon now to invite the attention of all who may keep or study our Meteorological Records. But from the evidence already accumulated the long drought of 1882-83, which ended last August, was, I maintain, clearly to be anticipated; for it closed the solar period dating from the limited rainfall (160 inches) in 1872-3, and the subsidiary dry period, showing the fall of 148 inches only, in 1876-7. An excess of rain may, in the same way, be looked for in the years 1884-5, and still more in 1885-6; but not so great an excess, these years merely closing the subsidiary period of excess from 1879-80 (228 inches).\u2014Journal No. 12 of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, pp. 254-5.\ntown south of the Singapore river, places deficient in water supply, and where sanitation of any sort was never thought of.\n\nThen, again, in 1875-77, outbreaks of cholera in an epidemic form were mainly averted by the untiring exertions of Messrs Bayliss and Colson who had charge of the waterworks then in course of completion. They opened up the conduit in several places near the Race Course, and stationed a steam engine at the distal end of the aqueduct and pumped the water across the canal, rendering the precious element available to large numbers of people; and, later on, by the completion of the water-works, good wholesome water was distributed throughout the town, which has helped to produce so marked a change, that since then, cholera or choleraic diarrhoea has not appeared in an epidemic form.\n\nAs regards beri-beri, I think the Medical returns will show a marked falling off in the numbers treated since the removal of prisoners to the new Jail.\n\nThere can be no question that a great many unknown influences are at work on and around this globe of ours which more or less affect the health of its inhabitants. For some time past attention has been drawn to the wonderful spots on the sun, and they have been the subject of study of many observers, but the results must necessarily be slow. That the moon also has a share in some of these influences must be conceded, for it is well known that atmospheric disturbances are more frequent at certain stages of the moon's phases than at others, and quite recently there has been free expression regarding the influences caused or to be caused by the perihelia of certain planets, so that the conclusion is still forced on us, that it is as yet premature to calculate with any certainty on this question; yet every little effort towards helping its solution should be encouraged, and in time the skein which now seems tangled may be unravelled.\n\nIn connection with this line of thought it may be suggested that in this, almost the wealthiest of the British Colonies, it is not too soon to provide for an observatory under an Astronomer and Meteorologist. The equatorial position of Singapore gives to the Astronomer a more interesting\nfield for observations than can be obtained at higher or lower latitudes. But till such an idea is taken up by the powers that be, those who have the means, time and inclination can contribute much information by daily observations of the sun when possible, registering the sun spots, if any, and thus ascertain if there be any connection between their occurrence and our rainfall; and the Principal Civil Medical Officer would also help considerably if he could see his way to having rain gauges and registers kept at Changi or Siranggong (extreme east), Tanjong Karang (west), at the Police stations, Bukit Timah Road 7th mile, and Seli-tar; a more general average of the rainfall could thus be ascertained. The absence of a station or stations well in the centre of the island is a drawback, the more so as many of the streams running into the impounding reservoir, which supplies the town with its drinking water, are fed by the rains falling on the southern aspect of Bukit Timah. There should be little difficulty in teaching the Police Sergeants in charge of the stations to keep the register.\n\nJ. J. L.

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE HILL TRIBES OF NORTH FORMOSA.\n\nIn a previous number of this Journal,* I touched lightly on the subject of the probable origin of the Hill Tribes of Formosa, adding at the same time a short vocabulary of a dialect spoken by certain tribes and families occupying the savage forest-clad mountains to the South-East and South of the Chinese town of Banca \u8239\u982d\u7684 the quondam emporium of foreign and native trade in the North of the island\u2014a town said some twenty years ago to have been composed of thirty to forty thousand Chinese souls. Its position as a trading centre has been somewhat interfered with of late years by the rival town of Twatutia \u57c3\u5229\u5927 (situated only a mile or so to the North of Banca), whose growing importance is owing almost entirely to the establishment there of foreign mercantile houses, and to the rapid development of the tea trade, of which Twatutia is the principal mart.\n\nIt is my present object to give a description of the aboriginal tribes living in the hills in rear of Banca extending in various directions towards S\u00fb-oh Bay on the East coast, and more especially of those tribes living nearest to the western borderland in the neighbourhood of K\u00f4t Chiu \u5c3a\u5c48 formerly a Chinese border outpost, as well as of those residing in the mountains at the back of San Ko Yeng \u6c38\u89d2\u4e09 and to the East also of To Ko Ham \u5854\u79d1\u5927 extending down to the \"Sylvian and Dodd\" ranges in the vicinity of the \"Petroleum Wells\" discovered by myself in the spring of the year 1865.\n\n* Journal No. 9, pp. 69-84.\nThe Hill Savages of North Formosa are, without doubt, exactly like other human beings in the shape of their bodies and number of their limbs, and although they are as wild as the animals which roam about their country, have no written language of their own, and live in a most primitive style, yet there are no signs of a Darwinian tail, neither do they at all give you the idea that their progenitors were of the monkey species.\n\nThe men are not remarkably tall; in fact I should say that few of them measure over five feet nine inches, and the majority of them are, probably, under five feet six inches. In the South of the island, it is said, the men are of a larger mould than those residing North of Latitude 24 N.\n\nThe complexion of old men of the tribes is very sallow and often swarthy; that of young, healthy warriors much lighter and clearer, but there is observable in the majority of faces a dark tinge not to be seen in the faces of Chinese, not quite so dark as the complexion of mixed descendants of Portuguese settlers in Macao, but resembling more the tint to be seen in the faces of fair-complexioned Japanese. They are, if anything, darker-skinned than ordinary Chinamen who have not been exposed to the sun; but the peculiar strain referred to, does not appear so distinctly in the younger members of the tribe, or so strong, as it does in the complexions of those who have taken an active part in hunting, fighting, and in the hard daily struggle for existence.\n\nThe skin of the darkest savage of the North of the island is not so dark as the complexions of many representatives of Spain, southern France and Italy, and in higher latitudes, many faces of Celtic type shew as dark a hue as that observable in the faces of the aborigines of the North. In old members of the tribes, the colour of the skin assumes a duskier and sallower tint, constant on the frequent exposure to the sun and to the weather, but with all this, there is no similarity of colour to that visible in the faces of African negroes.\n\nThe strain of negro blood was plainly visible in the faces of the wrecked Pellew Islanders, but in the colour\nof the skin and in the texture of the hair of the northern tribes there are no signs of negro extraction. Their hair is invariably dark and lank, not curly or frizzled, their lips are not so thick even as those of Malays, and the high noses possessed by many approach often the European type. With these evidences before us, it is safe to assume that these savages have inherited an intermediate colour not apparently traceable to negro admixture. The diversities of colour in men, whether in a civil sed or wild state, have puzzled enquirers, I imagine; up to the present day, and it is impossible to say with any certainty now, after all the speculations and theories enunciated in books on the subject, whether our first parents were created black or fair-skinned. The stronger reasons are in favour of the former colour, in any case the hot rays of the sun seem to have the effect of only tanning the skin brown, even in the tropics, and this effect in Formosa, where, in the valleys, it is extremely hot for more than half the year, would appear to have no hereditary consequence on the colour of young savages who are launched into the world year after year. The colour of the skin of all peoples must necessarily be a guide to descent, for it must be inherited, of course with modifications. I have considered it advisable to allude to this subject to prove that the savages of North Formosa are not apparently directly descended from the Eastern negro section of the human family, specimens of which are to be found in the islands of the South Pacific Ocean. It is well known that there are certain dark curly-headed tribes in the Philippine group, and possibly similar representatives of that class of people may later on be discovered in some of the numerous valleys of Formosa amongst the tribes to the South of the 24th parallel, when the whole of the country between Mount Morrison and the Sylvian Range has been thoroughly explored. The colour of the skin of all the Northern tribes I have seen appears to be of a uniform hue, without any variety, beyond a darker or lighter complexion observable when comparing bronzed and swarthy old men with younger members of the tribe who have never been much exposed to the weather.\n\nThe general contour of the face resembles somewhat that\nof a Malay, but the lips of the Formosan savage are not so thick, neither are their noses (excepting in few instances) quite so flat as those of the Malays whom I have seen at Singapore and in China. It may safely be said that there is nothing in their physiognomy which resembles the Chinese, their natural enemies, whom they imagine to be the only other inhabitants of Formosa or indeed of the world.\n\nOn first meeting a savage of the true type (not beggar savages who are to be found on the borders and often in Chinese villages), you notice immediately the wide difference between him and the Celestial whom you have left on the opposite side of the borders, not only in the shape of his head, but particularly in the expression of the eye, which reminds you more than anything else of the wild and anxious gaze of a Scotch deer-hound. The eyes of most of the young warriors are strikingly black and piercing, they always appear to be on the move, staring to their full extent and gazing with a clear but eager look as it were at some far distant object beyond you. In the eye of the younger huntsmen and warriors, you cannot recognise care, but the look of those in their prime speaks of anxious thought for the morrow and is an index of the general feeling of insecurity, which must frequently and naturally exist amongst men who almost daily encounter dangers from contact with their human enemies, in the shape of neighbouring unfriendly tribes or the wily Chinese invader, as well as at times the wild animals of the forests, on the flesh of which they are, for the most part, dependent for their subsistence. The expression referred to is not one of fear, but denotes rather a life of care and anxiety.\n\nThe head being generally small and round, the face is not particularly large or full. The eyes are very dark-coloured and straight cut, not at all oblique. In those of good-looking young men and women, the lashes are dark and long, eyebrows black, strong and thick, but not overhanging. In some faces they often nearly meet at the root of the nose. They are decidedly a very distinct feature of the face, as beards and whiskers are unknown and a moustache is seldom attempted, though I have seen certain old members of tribes\nwearing a resemblance to one: as a rule all hairs appearing on the chin or cheek are plucked out by the roots, a small pair of tweezers being used for the purpose.\n\nThe shape of the heads of savages varies considerably, though the majority of them appear round and rather small. Their faces are for the most part of a Malayan type, some have a Jewish cast, and again you observe faces whose profiles resemble those of Europeans. I am inclined to think that these differences in physiognomies are attributable to the mixture of Malay, Philippine and Polynesian blood with the original ancient stocks previously existing in the island.\n\nThe men of the northern tribes are in the habit of tattooing the forehead and chin in horizontal lines of about three quarters of an inch in length, and one-sixteenth part of an inch in breadth right in the centre of the forehead from the parting of the hair, which is always in the middle, to the root of the nose.\n\nOn the chin, also, are similar horizontal lines, and these are, as a rule, the only tattoo marks that are visible on the faces of the men. On the body they tattoo slightly, but it is not very general amongst them. The men have also a curious custom of piercing the lobes of their ears. Each lobe has a hole through it, large enough to receive a piece of bamboo about the size of a Manila cheroot. They usually wear therein hollow pieces of young bamboo with tufts of scarlet long-ells sticking out of the opening at the upper end; others insert pieces of what appears to be white cuttle-fish bone, about four inches long, with a disc made of the same material in the outer end. On the foreheads of some of the men may be seen similar flat but round pieces of cuttle-fish bone, fixed there by means of a piece of string round the head or attached to a circlet or wreath of embroidered camlets or native-made cloth. On their small, tight-fitting caps, they frequently fix circular pieces of this white cuttle-fish bone, or whatever it is. It seems to be quite a common article of barter amongst them. They use strings of small beads made of cuttle-fish bone not only as ornaments for their heads and necks, but as a \"circulating medium.\" Necklaces, earrings and trinkets of various kinds are made of it. The\naborigines of the northern and central mountains are immensely fond of all sorts of trinkets. Round the necks of old men and young warriors are seen necklaces of wild boars' tusks and teeth of animals. They are worn often as heirlooms, but principally as symbols of individual prowess. They often load their necks with metal trinkets, cuttle-fish beads, &c., to which they attach numerous little appliances connected with the priming and loading of their matchlocks, a motley sort of collection, which excites the curiosity of the beholder. Every man who possesses a gun (p\u00e2ht\u00fbs) wears round his neck curious-looking priming-flasks full of powder, and over his shoulder, or round his waist, an oblong-shaped case, made of skin, often containing several cylindrical-shaped wooden receptacles full of powder. He has generally about him a small bag containing shot and long iron projectiles almost the size of the little finger, which are slipped down the muzzle of the long-barrelled matchlock on top of the powder without any wad between. Matchlocks, however, are not very common in the interior, and even the border tribes are only scantily furnished with them. The majority of the men are armed with bows and arrows, with which they make good practice at stationary objects. Bowmen wear round their waists a deer skin strap, or arrow-belt, and not a man is without a long knife called lal\u00fbo. Another common appendage is a bag made either of hempen cloth or skin, about four or five inches broad and nine or ten inches long, in which they place dried tobacco leaves. Tobacco grows wild in many parts of the country inhabited by the savages, and in Chinese territory it is cultivated to a large extent in certain districts. The savages simply sun-dry it, then rub it in their hands and place it in their pipes. In this form it is very mild. Foreigners make it into blocks by placing the leaves one above the other; a little water is then sprinkled over them, sometimes a dash of rum, the leaves are then pressed into a compact block, or are compressed into a circular shape about the size of the wrist and tapering to a point at both ends. Tobacco made in this form is tied round tightly together with rope, and is a very good substitute for what is called ship's tobacco. Native-grown tobacco, has been often prepared in this way by sailors on board\nBritish gunboats visiting Tamsui, and has been much appreciated by every one fond of a pipe.\n\nChinese cultivate the tobacco plant, and large quantities are exported in junks to the mainland, where it is \"cured\" according to Chinese taste, and in this form is re-imported for the use of Chinese only. The plant seems to thrive in Formosa luxuriantly, and it is a wonder that no attempt has been made here to manufacture cigars and cheroots for foreign exportation. Judging from the quality and size of the leaf, there ought to be no difficulty in producing cigars equal to those made in Manila.\n\nThe aborigines of the North one and all smoke tobacco. Men and women invariably do so, and even young boys and girls are addicted to this pleasant vice, and as the plant grows wild and Formosa is a feverish and aguish country, it is not astonishing that smoking is such a common habit amongst them. Their pipes are made of hollowed bamboo and the stem (t\u00fat\u00fa bidn\u00e1 k\u00fai) is also made of very thin bamboo reed, being about half a foot to a foot in length, according to the taste of the owner. The bowls are often very tastefully and prettily carved and are frequently ornamented with pieces of metal. When not in use, the pipe is generally stuck in the hair at the back of the head by both men and women.\n\nThe clothing of these so-called savages living in the lower hills adjoining Chinese territory is, especially in the summer months, very scant. It consists chiefly of a coat, called l\u00fa-k\u00fas resembling very much an enlarged singlet open in the front and as a rule without sleeves. Four straight pieces of native hempen cloth are sewn together two to the back and two in front, leaving room for the arms to pass through, sewn also at the top over the shoulders, but open in front, exposing the chest and stomach. Sometimes they are buttoned across the chest, and sleeves are occasionally worn by border savages. These coats cover the back entirely, and reach down nearly as far as the knees, and although they are usually made of plain, coarse, bleached, hempen cloth, they are almost always embroidered from the waist downwards, or interwoven with either blue or scarlet threads of long-ells, which they obtain from the\nChinese borderers.\n\nThe patterns vary very much, resembling somewhat the carvings to be seen on their pipe stems and not unlike the tattoo lines and bars on the faces of the women. They shew great diversity as well as regularity of design, and if not imitations derived from outside sources, they indicate not only originality but great taste. In addition to the luk\u00fas the men wear round their waists a strip of woven hemp four or five inches broad, embroidered in the same way as the lower part of the luk\u00fas. This girdle or belt is called habbock, and is worn next to the skin as a rule, but sometimes outside the coat. The luk\u00fas and habbock are almost the only articles of clothing worn by the men in the lower ranges of hills, but on the higher levels many wear coats with sleeves, and sometimes clothes made of the skins of animals.\n\nIn the summer months, one often meets men and boys roaming about with absolutely no clothes on at all. Some consider \"full dress\" to consist of a rattan wicker-work closely fitting cap (mobu), others strut about all day long with only the belt or habbock round their waists, with the lal\u0101o stuck in it.\n\nThe blade of the lal\u0101o is about a foot and a half long and is always kept sharp. It is set in a haft of wood, which is usually adorned in the same way as their pipes, with carvings and pieces of metal. The blade is protected by a sheath of wood on one side and an open wire work guard on the other. At the end of this scabbard is often fixed part of the tail of a Chinaman, or other enemy, who has fallen a victim in some border war or on some head-hunting expedition. The lal\u0101o is a most necessary article to possess, for with it they cut their way through the jungle and thick undergrowth, with it they give the death-blow to the game they hunt; they use it in dividing the animals they kill, they eat with it as sailors do with their knives, they cut and split firewood with it, and last of all they cut off the heads of their enemies with this most useful implement. The blades are made by Chinese and are obtained by the savages in barter for deer's horns, &c.; often they are taken from the bodies of Chinese killed by them\nin their numerous encounters with their would-be exterminators.\n\nOn occasions the men sometimes wear tied over their right shoulder and flowing down the back and across the chest, a square piece of variegated cloth (worn by women as a sort of petticoat, tied round the waist and reaching to the knees), but this article of apparel is worn more by the women than the men.\n\nThey wear another kind of coat, or rather jacket, called the fighting jacket. It is made in every way like the luk\u00e1s, but in its size. Instead of extending low down the body, it only reaches as far as the waist, and is more like a shell jacket without sleeves than anything else. It is made of hemp, very closely interwoven with threads of scarlet long-ells, a colour which, amongst the northern tribes, seems to be the favourite. Further south, towards the Sylvian Range, coats embroidered with blue thread of long-ells are more the fashion. The long-ells and camlets used by the border savages are obtained from their neighbours, the Chinese hillmen. In describing the dress of the savages, I am alluding at present more especially to that worn by men living in the hills to the North of N. Lat. 24, and to the East of 121 E. Long. There appears to be very little variety in the costumes worn in this region, that is, in the lower ranges of hills, but at 6,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea level, great differences in the appearance of the dresses as well as in the manners and ways of the people are observable. A rather curious apology for a great coat is worn in damp or rainy weather, of which they get a very full share at all times of the year, for the lofty mountain ranges, varying from 4,000 to 12,000 feet running nearly the whole length of the island, offer a great attraction to rain clouds.\n\nThis coat is made generally of the skin of the large brown deer, only partially cured by exposure to the sun and wind. The design is about as rude as anything can be, a slit of about six inches in length is made in the hide and at the end of the slit a circular piece of the skin is cut out, allowing just room for the neck. The stiffness of the hide and the narrow space\nallowed for the neck prevent the coat dropping off the shoulders. A man with a covering of this kind can screw himself into such a position that no part of his body is exposed, excepting his head, and on this he places his jockey-cap-shaped rattan cap, with the peak at the back, thus securing perfect protection from rain. A few other articles besides those named are carried, such as hand nets, fishing gear, rope port-fires (made of hemp or the bark of a tree), worn round the wrists of men armed with matchlocks, &c., but such articles will be referred to later on.\n\n(To be continued.)\n\nJ.

The alleged necessity for this is thus stated by a writer in Excursions et Reconnaissances, VIII, 206 (November and December, 1885):\n\n\"It was necessary that France, the protecting power, should at last intervene. Without wishing to interfere unreasonably in the administration of the country, it was necessary that the revenue realised by the land-tax, ceasing to be devoted to the augmentation of the personal wealth of the King or privileged mandarins, should be the source of productive expenditure; it was necessary that the peasant should become owner of his land, and the slave master of his person; that justice should be regularly administered, and that, placed at first within the reach of all by the creation of minor courts, it should be secured by the existence of superior tribunals. It was necessary beyond everything that the execution of these reforms should not be evaded, as so many promises have been during the last twenty years, by the ill-will of mandarins\n\n* The Law and Customs of the Malays with reference to the Tenure of Land, Journal, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society, No. 13, p. 75.\n\u2020 p.p. 100 and 130.\ninterested in maintaining the existing state of affairs.\"\n\n\"The perusal of the decrees which follow will show better than any commentary how it has been decided to solve all these difficulties. The tax in kind has been abolished and the right of private property in land created. The eight provinces formed out of the fifty-seven old ones are placed severally under the superintendence of a French Resident; a civil list is assigned to the King, while the headmen of provinces and the judges receive salaries which justify the exaction from them of integrity and industry. Finally, at the Court of the King, France is represented by a Resident-General who, instead of being, as in the past, an almost powerless spectator of Cambodian decline, will have a firm hand over all branches of the administration.\"\n\nThe decrees here alluded to include one relating to the political and administrative organisation of Cambodia, one providing for the judicial organisation, one abolishing slavery, one creating private property in land, and one abolishing tax in kind levied on paddy. All of these are of interest to Englishmen, to whom no experiment in colonisation and in the government of subject races can be a matter of indifference. But only the two last, as bearing upon land-tenures and land-revenue, and therefore related to the subject of the paper already mentioned, are here translated. Whether the political condition of the country will admit of their peaceful introduction remains yet to be seen.*\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\n\n* \"The last mail from Indo-China brings also some particulars as to the situation in Cambodia. This country is far from being pacified; if it is true that our soldiers have been victorious in all engagements and that they have inflicted enormous losses on the insurgents, it is none the less true that the whole country is disorganised, that anarchy reigns there, and that security is wanting. What is most painful to us to notice is that these tidings only reach us through the post, that in the seven months during which the insurrection has now lasted the Governor of Cochin-China has given no details, except when they have been forced from him, and that it is only now that we are beginning to learn the names of the killed and wounded. Undoubtedly it was necessary not to give the movement more importance than it deserved, but it is, to say the least of it, strange that we should not have been informed, until a month after the event, that Pnom-Penh, the capital of Cambodia, had been attacked.\"\u2014Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient, July, 1885, p. 27.\nORDER RELATIVE TO THE CREATION OF PROPRIETORSHIP IN LAND IN CAMBODIA.\n\nPart I.\u2014Of the creation of property in land.\nPart II.\u2014Division of the State-domain.\nPart III.\u2014Of the administration of the State-domain.\nPart IV.\u2014Of occupiers.\nPart V.\u2014Of alienation.\nPart VI.\u2014Of registration of proprietorship.\nPart VII.\u2014Of dispossession.\n\nGeneral provisions.\n\nPart I.\n\nOf the Creation of Property in Land.\n\n1. The territory of Cambodia, up to this day the exclusive property of the Crown, is declared to be the property of the State.\n\n2. All persons holding lands by virtue of documents indicating a temporary hiring or alienation will be required to deposit the same, during the six months next following after the publication of this order, in the hands of the Resident of the Province, who will grant receipts for them.\n\nAfter having been verified by the Resident-General, these documents will, if their validity is established, be countersigned and returned to the parties interested.\n\n3. In default of compliance, within the period specified, with the requirements of the preceding section, land-holders will forfeit all rights.\n\nPart II.\n\nDivision of the State-domain.\n\n4. The State-domain includes,\nlands assigned as an endowment to the Crown;\nlands employed for public purposes (*le domaine public*);\nreserved lands (*le domaine de r\u00e9serve*);\nalienable lands (*le domaine ali\u00e9nable*).\n\nIn the endowment of the Crown is included all the immoveable property placed at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Cambodia, with power to him to collect the revenues thereof and to dispose of them at his pleasure, subject to the reservations contained in this order.\n\nIn the public domain are included\u2014roads, highways, railway lines and their appurtenances; streams navigable for vessels or rafts, as well as their banks or shores to a breadth of eight *m\u00e8tres* beyond the ordinary level of high water; all the ways of communication in general; buildings, lands and premises appropriated to a public purpose.\n\n5. The Crown endowment and the public domain are inalienable; the immoveable property composing them can neither be pledged or mortgaged.\n\n6. The reserved tracts include such immoveable property as the government decides to withhold from immediate alienation and to reserve for the wants of the future, although they form a portion neither of the Crown endowment nor of the public domain.\n\nSuch immoveable property is inalienable as long as it continue to be classed under this category; it may, however, be pledged or mortgaged.\n\n7. The alienable tracts comprise all lands, the alienation of which is authorised as occasion arises. They may be classified, in each *commune*, in different classes, which will only be disposed of successively, so that lands of the second class will only be alienated after those of the first have been exhausted, those of the third class after the complete alienation of the second, and so on.\n\n8. Land revenue of all kinds, and the rents derived from the immoveable property of the State-domain, with the exception of the Crown endowment, go to the credit of the State budget, which benefits similarly by the sums realised by the sale of alienable lands.\n9. The classification of the lands of the State-domain into\u2014\n\nthe Crown endowment,\nthe public domain,\nthe reserved portion, and\nthe alienable portion,\n\nwill be carried out, and may be modified from time to time by an order of the Resident-General, confirmed by the Governor of Cochin-China, after consultation with the Council of the Government of Cambodia.\n\nThe division, according to communes, and the classification of the alienable tracts will be effected by the provincial Residents, after consultation with the native authorities, and sanctioned by the Resident-General.\n\nPart III.\n\nOf the Administration of the State-domain.\n\n10. The State-domain is administered, under the high authority of the King and of the Governor of Cochin-China, by the French Resident-General, represented in the provinces by the Residents.\n\nThe Resident-General executes, either in person or by those to whom he has delegated authority, all the instruments which affect the State-domain; purchases, sales, concessions, contracts, exchanges, leases and agreements, and represents it in Courts of law.\n\nPart IV.\n\nOf Occupiers.\n\n11. Exceptional advantages will be offered to occupiers of the soil.\n\nThose who have established themselves upon lands forming part of the alienable domain will be admitted, in preference to all other persons, either to become the owners of such lands on a gratuitous title, or else to acquire them by private contracts in consideration of a payment calculated on the\nintrinsic value of the soil independent of any added value resulting from improvements made by such occupiers.\n\n12. Those who have established themselves on lands appropriated to the public domain or the reserved tracts will have to quit them within a period to be fixed by the Resident of the province; but they will receive, free of cost, if they desire it, a concession of land sufficient to indemnify them for any losses resulting from compulsory removal.\n\nWhen the lands in respect of which such evacuation is to be effected are occupied by standing crops, the period aforesaid can only commence from the day of their removal.\n\n13. Every person who shall occupy in the future, without the license of a competent authority, a piece of land belonging to the State, shall be liable to a fine of four times the letable value of the land occupied.\n\nPart V.\n\nOf Alienation.\n\n14. The land of the State may be alienated by means of free gift (concession gratuite), of sale by private contract, and of sale by public auction.\n\n15. Free concession of fifty hectares* and under, in the country, or of one thousand square m\u00e8tres and under in centres of population, may be granted by the provincial Residents, after consultation with the native authorities; but they will not take effect until after approval by the Resident-General.\n\n16. Concessions of greater extent may be made by the Resident-General. When they exceed three hundred hectares, in the case of country lands, or three thousand square m\u00e8tres in the case of populous centres, they must, in addition, be ratified by the Governor of Cochin-China, after consultation with the Council of the Government of Cambodia.\n\n17. Sales by private contract of land of a value of two hundred dollars and under may be concluded by the provincial Residents and confirmed by the Resident-General; above two hundred dollars, they may be concluded by the Resident-\n\n* One hectare=two acres one rood thirty-five perches.\nGeneral; when they exceed two thousand dollars, they must, in addition, be submitted for the approval of the Governor of Cochin-China, the Council of the Government of Cambodia being consulted.\n\n18. The putting up of land for sale by public auction must, in every case, be authorised, as a preliminary measure, by the Resident-General, who has subsequently to confirm the report of the sale. This report must, in addition, receive the approval of the Governor of Cochin-China, in consultation with the Council of Government of Cambodia, if the price realised at the auction exceeds two thousand dollars.\n\n19. In case the confirmation of the Resident-General, or the approval of the Governor, is refused, the alienations mentioned in sections 16, 17 and 18 will be rendered void and will be of no effect.\n\n20. The draft of the instrument of free concession or of private contract is shewn on the counterfoil of the register of alienations kept at the Residency of the Province in which the land is situated: a duplicate is made out on the detachable part of the same register and an extract thereof upon the butt attached to the latter. These three documents are signed by the provincial Resident and by the purchaser or concessionaire, or by two witnesses if the latter be illiterate. The detachable copy and its butt are then torn off and despatched to the Resident-General, who will transmit them, if necessary, to the Governor.\n\nAfter all the prescribed formalities have been performed, the butt is detached from the duplicate and kept at the Chief Residency (la R\u00e9sidence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) while this latter is made over to the party interested to serve as his document of title.\n\n21. The approval of the Governor of Cochin-China may be given in a general way, by a resolution mentioning the various instruments, to several alienations.\n\n22. Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 (the three first paragraphs only), 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the resolution of the 22nd August, 1882, relating to the alienations of public land in Cochin-China, shall be applicable to sales by auction of public lands in Cambodia. The Resident-General is to perform the functions which in Cochin-China devolve on the Director of the Interior.\n23. The instrument of alienation may contain a stipulation exempting the land from taxation, either wholly or partially, for a period which shall in no case exceed four years.\n\nThe purchase money will be payable either in cash at the time of delivery of title, or by annual payments calculated in such a manner that the purchaser will find himself entirely free within a maximum period of ten years.\n\n24. The cost of taking possession must be defrayed entirely by the purchasers and concessionaires.\n\n25. Instruments by which the alienation of State lands is effected are exempt from all fees for registration or otherwise, with the exception of a fixed charge of 20 cents for delivery of title, which will be levied at the time of registration in the register of alienations, on which a minute of sales by auction will be entered.\n\n26. The alienation of State lands takes final effect\u2014in the case of free concessions, by the discharge, for four consecutive years, of the land-tax; or, in the case of alienations burdened with a payment, by the entire payment of the purchase-money.\n\n27. The Resident-General can always direct the revocation of alienations which have not taken final effect, either for non-compliance with the clauses of the contract, or for insufficient or bad cultivation.\n\nThe eviction of the purchaser or concessionaire is pronounced, after a preliminary suit, by the authority who ordered the alienation, subject to the confirmation or approval of the superior authorities whose concurrence is necessary as laid down in sections 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.\n\n28. No demise of State lands for farming can take place if it has not been previously authorised by the Resident-General; such demise will then be concluded by the provincial Resident, entered on the register of leases specially kept for that purpose (which will be kept in the way indicated in section 20 as to the register of alienation), and confirmed by the Resident-General in the same way as sales by private contract where the purchase money is less than two hundred dollars, before the detached duplicate is issued to the lessee. This latter can in no case be exempted from payment of the land-tax.\n29. Leases of land belonging to the State will be chargeable with a fee of twenty cents on delivery of title. This fee will be levied at the time of the entry on the register of leases.\n\n30. Christian institutions, pagodas, mosques and other religious establishments, will be permitted to keep in full property the lands occupied by them on the 17th June, 1884, the day of the signature of the Pnom-Penh Convention, that is to say, temple-grounds, cemeteries, schools, and priests' houses, with their gardens and out-houses.\n\nPart VI.\n\nOf Registration of Lands.\n\n31. During the six months next following after the publication of this order, there will be opened, for each commune, or, if necessary, for each section of a commune, quarter, or hamlet, a register of the lands comprised in it, the form of which will be decided upon hereafter.\n\nThese registers will be kept in French by the provincial Residents.\n\n32. All mutations of immoveable property must, under pain of nullity, be certified to the headmen of cantons, who will receive the instrument by virtue of which the mutation is effected, will give a receipt for it, and will forward it without delay, through the successive grades of headmen (par la voie hi\u00e9rarchique), to the provincial Resident for entry on the register of lands of his Residency.\n\nThe certificate of the parties interested is verified by a statement signed by the Resident and written upon the instrument of transfer.\n\nNo mutation of title can be effected by a verbal contract.\n\n33. The registers of lands will be commenced afresh every five years.\n\nPart VII.\n\nOf Dispossession.\n\n34. No one shall henceforth be obliged to surrender his\nproperty except in the case of its being required for public purposes, and in consideration of fair compensation previously paid.\n\n35. Lands in respect of which dispossession is effected on account of their being required for public purposes, will become part of the State-domain and be classified under the head of *le domaine public*.\n\n36. Whenever there shall be occasion for dispossession, the nature of the public purposes for which the land is required shall be previously declared by an order of the Resident-General. This order will describe the lands to be appropriated, will declare their appropriation, will state, if necessary, any reasons for urgency in fixing the date from which possession will be taken, and will appoint the non-official members of the Committee mentioned in the following section.\n\n37. Within (at the latest) the three months next following the order of the Resident-General, a Committee consisting of\u2014\n\n1. the Provincial Resident, or his deputy, President;\n2. the Headman of the *arrondissement* and the Headman of the *canton*, within which the land appropriated is situated;\n3. the two non-official members appointed by the order prescribed in s. 36;\n\nshall proceed to the spot, inspect the land appropriated, listen to the claims of the owners and other persons interested (notice having been given to them at least eight days previously) and fix the amount of the compensation.\n\nThe Committee will draw up a Report of its proceedings and forward it without delay to the Resident-General, who will pay, within three months from the date of such report, the sums thereby awarded.\n\n38. Except in cases of urgency, possession shall never be taken until the compensation has been paid.\n\nThe taking of possession must never be delayed longer than the month following such payment.\n\nIf urgency has been formally declared to exist, possession will be taken on the date fixed in the order of the Resident-General.\nIn either case, the fact of possession having been taken must be recorded in a report by the Provincial Resident.\n\n39. Every act of dispossession which shall not be in conformity with the preceding regulations is hereby declared to be void and of no effect, provided that this shall in no way affect any liability, civil or criminal, which may have been incurred by those officers who may have ordered, prosecuted, carried out, or in any manner taken part in the same.\n\nGeneral Procedure.\n\n40. Any matter not provided for in the present Regulation shall, on the motion of the Resident-General, be determined by the Governor of Cochin-China, the Council of the Government of Cambodia being consulted.\n\n41. The Resident-General is charged with the carrying out of the present order, which shall be enrolled wherever needful, and inserted in the Journal Officiel de la Cochin-Chine Francaise and in the Bulletin Officiel du Cambodge.\n\nGiven at Pnom-Penh, the 28th October, 1884.\n\nCHARLES THOMSON,\nGovernor of Cochin-China.\n\n(Seal of the first Minister).\n\nOrder abolishing the Tax on Paddy.\n\n1. The tax upon paddy levied by the Oknhaluong is, and shall remain, abolished.\n\n2. The foregoing decision shall apply to the harvest, now in progress, for 1884.\n\n3. Paddy intended for the manufacture of spirits shall continue to be charged with a duty of ten per cent.\n4. The representative, for the time being, of the Protectorate is charged with the enforcement of this decree.\n\nGiven at Pnom-Penh, the 18th November, 1884.\n\nCHARLES THOMSON,\nGovernor.\n\n(Seal of the first Minister).\n\nBy order of the Governor,\n\nJ. FOUR\u00c9S,\nRepresentative (provisional) of the Protectorate.\nMALAY LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.\n\nThe Malay language is a member of the Malayan section of the Malayo-Polynesian class of languages, but it is by no means a representative type of the section which has taken its name from it. The area over which it is spoken comprises the peninsula of Malacca with the adjacent islands (the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago), the greater part of the coast districts of Sumatra and Borneo, the seaports of Java, the Sunda and Banda Islands. It is the general medium of communication throughout the archipelago from Sumatra to the Philippine Islands, and it was so upwards of three hundred and fifty years ago when the Portuguese first appeared in those parts.\n\nThere are no Malay manuscripts extant, no monumental records with inscriptions in Malay, dating from before the spreading of Islam in the archipelago, about the end of the 13th century. By some it has been argued from this fact that the Malays possessed no kind of writing prior to the introduction of the Arabic alphabet (W. Robinson, J. J. de Hollander); whereas others have maintained, with greater show of probability, that the Malays were in possession of an ancient alphabet, and that it was the same as the Rechang (Marsden, Friederich), as the Kawi (Van der Tuuk), or most like the Lampong (Kern),\u2014all of which alphabets, with the Battak, Bugi, and Macassar, are ultimately traceable to the ancient Cambojan characters. With the Mohammedan conquest the Perso-Arabic alphabet was introduced among the Malays; it has continued ever since to be in use for literary, religious, and business purposes. Where Javanese is the principal language, Malay is sometimes found written with Javanese characters; and in Palembang, in the Menangkabo country of Middle Sumatra, the Rechang or Renchong characters are in general use, so called from the sharp and pointed knife with which they are cut on the smooth side of bamboo staves. It is only since the Dutch have established their supremacy in the archipelago that he\nRoman character has come to be largely used in writing and printing Malay. This is also the case in the Straits Settlements.*\n\nBy the simplicity of its phonetic elements, the regularity of its grammatical structure, and the copiousness of its nautical vocabulary, the Malay language is singularly well-fitted to be the lingua franca throughout the Indian archipelago. It possesses the five vowels, \\(a\\), \\(i\\), \\(u\\), \\(e\\), \\(o\\), both short and long, and one pure diphthong \\(au\\). Its consonants are \\(k\\), \\(g\\), \\(ng\\), \\(ch\\), \\(j\\), \\(\u00f1\\), \\(t\\), \\(d\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), \\(b\\), \\(m\\), \\(y\\), \\(r\\), \\(l\\), \\(w\\), \\(s\\), \\(h\\). Long vowels can only occur in open syllables. The only possible consonantal nexus in purely Malay words is that of a nasal and mute, a liquid and mute and vice versa, and a liquid and nasal. Final \\(k\\) and \\(h\\) are all but suppressed in the utterance. Purely Arabic letters are only used in Arabic words, a great number of which have been received into the Malay vocabulary. But the Arabic character is even less suited to Malay than to the other Eastern languages on which it has been foisted. As the short vowels are not marked, one would, in seeing, e.g., the word \\(bntng\\), think first of \\(bintang\\), a star; but the word might also mean a large scar, to throw down, to spread, rigid, mutilated, enceinte, a kind of cucumber, a redoubt, according as it is pronounced \\(bantang\\), \\(banting\\), \\(bentang\\), \\(buntang\\), \\(bunting\\), \\(bonteng\\), \\(benteng\\).\n\nMalay is essentially, with few exceptions, a dissyllabic language, and the syllabic accent rests on the penultimate unless that syllable is open and short; e.g., \\(d\u00e1tang\\), \\(nam\u00e1\u00f1a\\), \\(b\u00e9s\u00e1r\\), \\(diumpatkan\u00f1\u00e1lah\\). Nothing in the form of a root word indicates the grammatical category to which it belongs; thus, \\(k\u00e1sih\\), kindness, affectionate, to love; \\(ganti\\), a proxy, to exchange, instead of. It is only in derivative words that this vagueness is avoided. Derivation is effected by infixes, prefixes, affixes, and reduplication. Infixes occur more rarely in Malay than in the cognate tongues. Examples are\u2014\\(g\u00e1ruh\\), a rumbling noise, \\(gum\u00faruh\\), to make such a noise; \\(tunjuk\\), to point, \\(telunjuk\\), the forefinger; \\(ch\u00fachuk\\), to pierce, \\(cher\u00fachuk\\),\n\n---\n\n* No. The Roman character has not yet been adopted in the Straits Settlements, either in the Government Vernacular Schools, or by the Native Press.\n\nED.\na stockade. The import of the prefixes\u2014m\u011b (m\u011bng, m\u011b\u00f1, m\u011bn, m\u011bm), p\u011b (p\u011bng, p\u011b\u00f1, p\u011bn, p\u011bm), b\u011br, (b\u011bl), p\u011br, p\u011bl, ka, di, t\u011br,\u2014and affixes\u2014an, kan, i, lah\u2014will best appear from the following examples: root word \u0101jar, to teach, to learn; meng\u0101jar, to instruct (expresses an action); b\u011bl\u0101jar, to study (state or condition); meng\u0101jari, to instruct (some one, trans.); meng\u0101jarkan, to instruct (in something, causative); peng\u0101jar, the instructor; p\u011bl\u0101jar, the learner; pengaj\u0101ran, the lesson taught, also the school; p\u011blaj\u0101ran, the lesson learnt; di\u0101jar, to be learnt t\u0113raj\u0101r, learnt; t\u0113raj\u0101rkan, taught; t\u0113raj\u0101ri, instructed; [p\u0113r-\u0101ja; (from r\u0101ju, prince), to recognize as prince; p\u0113raj\u0101kan, to crown as prince; karaj\u0101an, royalty]; \u0101jarkanlah, teach! Examples of reduplication are\u2014\u0101jar-\u0101jar, a sainted person; \u0101jar-b\u0113r\u0101jar, (or b\u011bl\u0101jar), to be learning and teaching by turns; similarly there are forms like \u0101jar-m\u011bng\u0101jar, b\u0113r\u0101jar-aj\u0101ran, \u0101jar-aj\u0101ri, m\u011bmp\u0113r\u0101jar, m\u011bmp\u0113r\u0101jarkan, m\u011bmp\u0113raj\u0101ri, t\u0113rb\u0113l-\u0101jarkan, p\u0113rb\u0113l\u0101jarkan, &c. Altogether there are upwards of a hundred possible derivative forms, in the idiomatic use of which the Malays exhibit much skill. See especially H. von De-wall, De vormveranderingen der Maleische taal, Batavia, 1864; and J. Pijnappel, Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek, Amsterdam, 1875, \u201cInleiding.\u201d In every other respect the language is characterized by great simplicity and indefiniteness. There is no inflexion to distinguish number, gender, or case. Number is never indicated when the sense is obvious or can be gathered from the context; otherwise plurality is expressed by adjectives such as sag\u0101la, all, and b\u0101n\u016bk, many, more rarely by the repetition of the noun, and the indefinite singular by sa or s\u0101tu, one, with a class-word. Gender may, if necessary, be distinguished by the words laki-l\u0101ki, male, and p\u0113ramp\u0101an, female, in the case of persons, and of jant\u0101n and b\u0113t\u012bna in the case of animals. The genitive case is generally indicated by the position of the word after its governing noun. Also adjectives and demonstrative pronouns have their places after the noun. Comparison is effected by the use of particles. Instead of the personal pronouns, both in their full and abbreviated forms, conventional nouns are in frequent use to indicate the social position or relation of the respective interlocutors, as, e.g., hamba tuan, the master\u2019s slave, i.e., I. These nouns vary according to the different localities. Another peculiarity of\nMalay (and likewise of Chinese, Shan, Talaing, Burmese, and Siamese) is the use of certain class-words or coefficients with numerals, such as orang (man), when speaking of persons, ekor (tail) of animals, kepang (piece) of flat things, biji (seed) of roundish things; e.g., lima biji telur, five eggs. The number of these class-words is considerable. Malay verbs have neither person or number nor mood or tense. The last two are sometimes indicated by particles or auxiliary verbs; but these are generally dispensed with if the meaning is sufficiently plain without them. The Malays avoid the building up of long sentences. The two main rules by which the order of the words in a sentence is regulated are\u2014subject, verb, object; and qualifying words follow those which they qualify. This is quite the reverse of what is the rule in Burmese.\n\nThe history of the Malays amply accounts for the number and variety of foreign ingredients in their language. Hindus appear to have settled in Sumatra and Java as early as the 4th century of our era, and to have continued to exercise sway over the native populations for many centuries. These received from them into their language a very large number of Sanskrit terms from which we can infer the nature of the civilizing influence imparted by the Hindu rulers. Not only in words concerning commerce and agriculture, but also in terms connected with social, religious, and administrative matters, that influence is traceable in Malay. See W. E. Maxwell, Manual of the Malay Language, 1852, pp. 5-31, where this subject is treated more fully than by previous writers. This Sanskrit element forms such an integral part of the Malay vocabulary that in spite of the subsequent infusion of Arabic and Persian words adopted in the usual course of Mohammedan conquest it has retained its ancient citizenship in the language. The number of Portuguese, English, Dutch, and Chinese words in Malay is not considerable; their presence is easily accounted for by political or commercial contact.\n\nThe Malay language abounds in idiomatic expressions, which constitute the chief difficulty in its acquisition. It is sparing in the use of personal pronouns, and prefers impersonal and elliptical diction. As it is rich in specific expressions for the various aspects of certain ideas, it is requisite to employ always the most appropriate term suited to the particular\naspect. In Maxwell's Manual, pp. 120 sq., no less than sixteen terms are given to express the different kinds of striking, as many for the different kinds of speaking, eighteen for the various modes of carrying, &c. An unnecessary distinction has been made between High Malay and Low Malay. The latter is no separate dialect at all, but a mere brogue or jargon, the medium of intercourse between illiterate natives and Europeans too indolent to apply themselves to the acquisition of the language of the people; its vocabulary is made up of Malay words, with a conventional admixture of words from other languages; and it varies, not only in different localities, but also in proportion to the individual speaker's acquaintance with Malay proper. The use is different as regards the term Jawi as applied to the Malay language. This has its origin in the names Great Java and Lesser Java, by which the medi\u00e6val Java and Sumatra were called, and it accordingly means the language spoken along the coasts of the two great islands.\n\nMalay is probably spoken with greatest purity in the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago and in the independent states of Perak and Kedah, on the western coast of the peninsula of Malacca. In other states of the peninsula (Johor, Tringganu, Kelantan) dialectical divergencies both as to pronunciation and the use of words have been noted. The most important and the most interesting of all the Malay dialects is that of Menangkabo (Menangkarbau) in the residency of Padang and in Upper Jambi, in Central Sumatra. It abounds in diphthongs, and prefers vocalic to consonantal terminations, thus changing final al and ar into a', il and ir into iye, ul and ur into uwe, as and at into e', us into uci; final a mostly passes into o, so that for sud\u0101ru and sud\u0101gar they say sud\u0113r\u014d, sud\u0113g\u014d; the emphatic -lah is turned into -malah or malah h\u00e1; the prefixes b\u0113r, p\u0113r, t\u0113r are changed into b\u0103, p\u0103, t\u0103, or b\u0103r\u0103, p\u0103r\u0103, t\u0103r\u0103. Among other changes in pronunciation may be noted \u016brang for orang, mungko for maka, lai for l\u0101gi; they use nan for yang, na' for hendak, deh for oleh, ba' for b\u0101gai, pai for pergi, ko' for jikalau, &c. In some districts of Menangkabo (Palembang, Lebong) the Renchong character is in general use in writing this dialect, for which purpose it is far better suited than the Arabic. As early as 1822 a small tract on the customs and traditions\nof Moko-Moko, in this dialect, was printed with a translation at Bencoolen. But it is only in recent years that the Dutch have commenced to pay the dialect the attention it deserves, by publishing texts, with transliteration and translations and supplying other materials for its investigation. See the Transactions and Journal of the Asiatic Societies of Batavia and the Hague the Indische Gids, and more especially the philological portion, by A. L. van Hasselt, of Midden-Sumatra, iii. 1 (Leyden, 1880), where also the best and fullest account of the Renchong character is to be found. Of other Malay dialects in Sumatra, only the one spoken at Achih (Achin) deserves mention: in Java the Batavian dialect shows the most marked peculiarities. The numerous and greatly divergent dialects spoken in the Molucca Islands (valuable information on which has been supplied by F. S. A. de Clercq, G. W. W. C. van Hoefvell, and A. van Ekris) and in Timor differ so materially from the Malay of the peninsula of the Menangkabo that they cannot be called Malay dialects at all; whereas the Malay spoken in some parts of the Minahassa (Celebes) scarcely differs from Malay proper.\n\nThere is no grammar of Malay by a native writer with the sole exception of a small tract of 70 pages, entitled Bust\u0101nul-k\u0101til\u012bn, by R\u0101ja Ali Hajji of Rhio, which was lithographed in the island of Penengal in 1857. A. Pigafetta, who accompanied Magellan in his first voyage round the globe, was the first European whose vocabulary of Malay words (450) has come down to us. Next in the field were the Dutch, who provided a medium of intercourse between their traders and the Malays. F. Houtman's Vocabulary and Conversations, in Dutch, Malay, and Malagasy, appeared at Amsterdam in 1603; and it may be noted that the Malay spoken in those days does not appear to have materially altered since. The same dialogues appeared in English and Malay in 1614. Since then numerous grammars, dictionaries, and conversation books have been brought out by English and Dutch writers. As the best helps at present available for the study of Malay may be recommended W. E. Maxwell's Manual of the Malay Language, London, 1882 (especially valuable for its full treatment of the idioms); P. Favre, Grammaire de la langue Malaise, Vienna and Paris, 1876; and Dictionnaire Malais-Fran\u00e7ais, ib., 1875,\n2 vols.; *Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Malais*, ib., 1880, 2 vols.; J. J. de Hollander, *Handleiding bij de beoefening der Maleische taal en letterkunde*, Breda, 1882; J. Pijnappel, *Maleische Spraak-kunst*, Hague, 1866; and *Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek*, Amsterdam, 1875. The printing of Von Dewall's *Dictionary*, edited by H. N. van der Tuuk, is still in progress at Batavia.\n\n**Literature.**\u2014There are two kinds of Malay popular literature\u2014the one in prose, the other in poetry. The former comprises the proverbs, the latter the \"pantuns.\" \"Agriculture, hunting, fishing, boating, and wood-craft are the occupations or accomplishments which furnish most of the illustrations, and the number of beasts, birds, fishes, and plants named in a collection of Malay proverbs will be found to be considerable\" (W. E. Maxwell, *Malay Proverbs*). H. C. Klinkert, published a collection in the *Bijdragen tot de taalkunde van N. I.* (Journal of the Asiatic Society of the Hague) for 1866, pp. 39-87. See also J. Habbema on the Menangkabo proverbs, in vols. xxv. and xxvi. of the Batavian *Tijdschrift*, and Favre's *Dictionnaire Malais-Fran\u00e7ais*, passim. The pantuns are improvised poems, generally (though not necessarily) of four lines, in which the first and third and the second and fourth rhyme. They are mostly love poems; and their chief peculiarity is that the meaning intended to be conveyed is expressed in the second couplet, whereas the first contains a simile or distant allusion to the second, or often has, beyond the rhyme, no connexion with the second at all. The Malays are fond of reciting such rhymes \"in alternate contest for several hours, the preceding pantun furnishing the catchword to that which follows, until one of the parties be silenced or vanquished.\" See T. J. Newbold, *Account of the British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca*, vol. ii. 346; Klinkert in the *Bijdragen* for 1868, pp. 369-70; L. K. Harmsen in the *Tijdschrift*, vol. xxi. pp. 480-533 (Menangkabo). If the Malays have kept entirely aloof from the influences of Islam in this the most characteristic part of their literature, they have almost equally preserved their independence in the other departments. Not that this may be considered entirely to their credit; for, if they had endeavoured to infuse into their writings some of the spirit of Arabic and Persian historiography, poetry, and fiction, it could not but have benefited the character of their own liter-\nary productions. As it is their histories and chronicles are a strange motley of truth and fiction; their poems and novels lack coherence and imagination, and are singularly monotonous and devoid of that spirit of chivalry which pervades the corresponding branches of literature among the leading nations of Islam. As Malay copyists are much given to making arbitrary changes, it happens that no two MSS. agree, and that of many a popular work different recensions exist, which, moreover, often go by different names. This circumstance greatly tends to increase the difficulties of editing Malay texts. Works on specially Mohammedan subjects (theology, law, ethics, mysticism) are of course only imitations of Arabic or Persian originals; there are also numerous novels and poems treating of purely Mohammedan legends. But not only is there traceable in many of these a slight undercurrent of Hinduism and even pre-Hinduism; the Malays possess also, and indiscriminately read along with their Mohammedan books, quite as many works of fiction of purely Hindu origin. The want, however, of political cohesion, and of a national spirit among tribes so scattered as the Malays are, which could have favoured the growth of a national epic or national songs, sufficiently accounts for the absence from their literature of any productions of this class, such as exist in Bugi and Macassar literature. The most popular of their poetical productions are the Sha'ir Ken Tambuhan, Sha'ir Bidasari, Sha'ir Jauhar Manikam and Sha'ir Abdulmuluk, all of which have been printed. Among the prose works there are various collections of local laws and customs (undang-undang), chronicles (such as the Sajarat malayu), books on ethics (the best are the Makota sagala raja-raja, and the Bustanussalatin, and a very large number of works of fiction and legendary lore, some of which possess much descriptive power. They all bear the title Hikayat, and the following are the best-known: H. Hang Tuah, H. Hamzah, H. Isma Yatim, H. Jumjumah, H. Bakhtiyar (Sadah Bakhtin, Gholam), H. Simiskin, H. Sultan Ibrahim, H. Sri Rama, H. Pandawa Lima. Several of these and many other works not mentioned here have appeared in print (with or without translation) chiefly in Holland, Batavia, and Singapore, and extracts have been given in the various Malay chrestomathies by Dulaquier, De Hollander, Niemann, Van der Tuuk, Gra-\nshuis, and in Marsden's Malay Grammar. The best recent Malay writer was 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdelkadir Munshi of Singapore, who died, it is said of poison, at Mecca, some eight and twenty years ago. His autobiography, \"Journey to Kelantan,\" and \"Pilgrimage to Mecca\" are patterns of Malay style, though the author's contact with educated Europeans is traceable in them, while his translation (from the Tamil version) of the Panchatantra is free from such influence.\n\nMalay literature is fairly represented in England in the British Museum, the India Office, and the Royal Asiatic Society, and descriptive catalogues of the Malay MSS. in each of these libraries are available. See Niemann in the Bijdragen, iii. 6, p. 96-101; Van der Tuuk in Tijdschrift voor Ned. Indi\u00eb for 1849, i. p. 385-400, and in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, new series, ii. p. 85-135. An account of the Leyden collection, by J. Pijnappel, is given in the Bijdragen, iii. 5, pp. 142-178. The finest collection of Malay MSS., upwards of 400 volumes, is in the library of the Asiatic Society of Batavia. See L. W. C. van den Berg, Verslag van eene verzameling Maleische, &c., handschriften, Batavia, 1877. If it had not been for the loss, by fire, on their passage from India, of three hundred Malay MSS., the property of the late Sir T. S. Raffles, England would now boast of the largest assemblage of Malay MSS. in the world. On Malay literature in general, compare G. H. Werndly, Maleische Spraakkunst, Amsterdam, 1736, pp. 227-357; E. Jacquet in the Nouveau Journal Asiatique, vol. ix. (1832), pp. 97-132, and 222-253; T. J. Newbold, British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca, 1839, vol. ii. pp. 215-368; E.

R.\n\n[The foregoing paper, which is extracted from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (1883) is from the pen of Dr. Reinhold Rost, the learned librarian of the India Office Library, a friend to Oriental research of every description.\n\nEd.]\nA MISSIONARY'S JOURNEY\nTHROUGH LAOS FROM BANGKOK TO \u00dbBON.\n\nI am glad to be able to communicate to the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society some notes made by a Missionary on his way from Bangkok to \u00dbbon to convert the Laos tribes.\n\nMissionaries penetrate gradually and from different directions into the midst of these savage tribes, and try to convert them to Christianity. The story of what occurred among the wild Ba-huars, an independent tribe on the West of Cochin-China near the 14\u00b0 lat. N. and 106\u00b0 long. E. (Paris), is well known. In the beginning of 1884 five Missionaries were murdered by brigands while they were engaged in establishing a Mission among the Chau tribe in the West of Tonquin.\n\nFor some time past the Mission in Siam has maintained a Station at \u00dbbon, near 15\u00b0 20' N. lat. and 102\u00b0 30' E. long. (Paris) on the Seimoun, a tributary of the Mekong. It is the Narrative of a Missionary on his way to \u00dbbon which I have now the pleasure of communicating.\n\nN. C.\n\nIt is not a carefully composed narrative that I propose to give you, but simply a journal kept from day to day, written often by the light of a torch, or of the setting sun, when, tired by the day's march, we had pitched our camp for the night. In order to take the place of P\u00e8re Rondel, invalided, I started with\nP\u00e8re Xavier Gu\u00e9go, who had already been for two years a Missionary in Laos. We bought in Bangkok such things as were absolutely necessary, these being of an exorbitant price among the Chinese of Laos, viz., cotton goods, thread, cooking utensils, medicines, etc. On Septuagesima Monday, the 11th of February, 1884, two boats loaded with luggage took their departure for Thakien, four days' journey N. E. of Bangkok. The following Thursday we were at Thakien, where the inhabitants entertained us during the few days employed in preparing the carts to be used on our journey. These carts were the same which had brought down our confr\u00e8res from Laos a few days before. On Wednesday, the 20th February, the carts started; we followed a few hours later, and overtook them, and halted at mid-day at the village of Ban-seng. This village is at the entrance of the forest, which we were not to leave again after this point. There is nothing but one immense forest, in some places very dense, in others relieved by clearings in the midst of which villages are scattered about. It is a thick wood, through which passes a road just broad enough for a cart, there is not room for a man either on the right or on the left. Here and there one comes across a clearing. It must not be supposed that the road is free from obstructions; now it is a deep rut which nobody fills up, now it is an enormous root which blocks up part of the road-way and which has to be crossed at the risk of seeing the cart smashed into a thousand pieces. We advanced in this way with our ten carts and relays of bullocks, which either followed or preceded us by a short distance. Sometimes a wheel would lose its spokes, and sometimes an axle would break (these axles are merely bars of some tough wood which go through the wheels and have to be renewed frequently).\n\nAt last, about 9 o'clock, we reached a muddy pool and pitched our camp on its banks. This consisted in arranging the carts in a large circle, in the centre of which the bullocks and horses were tethered to stakes driven into the ground. Their drivers spread their mats on the grass under the carts and passed the night there. As for ourselves, we had manufactured two little tents which we set up between two carts. Large fires, fed with fuel by watchmen who mounted\nguard armed with muskets, were a safeguard against wild beasts and robbers.\n\nThursday, 21st.\u2014Daylight had hardly appeared when I wakened the camp and rang to prayers. Then each made his way to the cart that served as our kitchen, to swallow a cup of tea, while waiting for breakfast, which might be a long time coming, for it was necessary first to reach the regular halting-place, otherwise no water was to be got. The bullocks were yoked, and we started\u2014my confr\u00e8re, on horseback, leading the way, while I brought up the rear in order to keep an eye upon stragglers. After an hour\u2019s march, there was a sudden halt, and I went from one cart to another asking what was the matter. Each had stopped because the one in front of it had stopped! It turned out that a wheel was broken, the damage was repaired with rattan, and we went on again. About midday we stopped near a pool and cooked our breakfast, while the bullocks, unyoked, cropped the fresh herbage. We were at the village of Ramachai, but we were in want of a spare felloe, for which we sought in vain. Our people went off to the Laosian village of Ban-kula and thence brought back the piece of wood that we wanted. We then set off. The route here was over loose, white sand, which made it very heavy travelling for the bullocks. In the evening we reached two muddy marshes; here, at the pool known as Nong-pi-ieng, we camped.\n\nFriday, 22nd.\u2014Towards the evening we arrived at a small village\u2014a group of little huts built upon piles in the middle of an enclosure formed of felled timber. We did not halt here, for the water was not good and the custom-house of Muang Sanam is only a kilom\u00e8tre further on and there is a good spring there.\n\nThe mention of a \u201ccustom-house\u201d is calculated to make you suppose that we were approaching a collection of houses protected by a military station. But in this country a douane is a much more simple affair. No registers, no commissioners! Two men sprawling peacefully in a hut of leaves await, at the frontier of a province, the passage of cart and bullocks and levy a tax on the owners.\nSaturday, 23rd.\u2014A short stage. Busy preparing an altar.\n\nSunday, 24th.\u2014Mass. We camped in the evening on the banks of a torrent, which is nearly dry in this season.\n\nMonday, 25th.\u2014We found in the evening on the surface of the ground a kind of iron ore which the most intelligent of our followers called \"stone of Bien-hoa.\" This substance seems to me to be somewhat curious; it looks as if it were formed of little globules of iron, or like the slag which is taken from a furnace after smelting. Blocks of this stone are found at distant intervals, quite isolated one from the other. We camped near a little torrent.\n\nTuesday, 26th.\u2014We started again, crossing the stream Huai Khai, and met four bullock-carts accompanied by some Siamese. This is the first time for five days that we have come across any human being.\n\nWednesday, 27th.\u2014We had to cross the river Sak\u00e9o, which never dries up, and the bed of which is at the bottom of a deep ravine and is disfigured with stakes and snags.\n\nThe descent was negotiated, and we crossed over and halted for breakfast. Four or five Burmese caravans were encamped not far from us, and in another direction a party of Cambodians. These people had come from the provinces of Sourin and Sisaket to buy gambier, which they eat with the betel-leaf and arcca-nut. They had been here for more than a week and had not yet been able to make their purchases, owing to their not having complied with some formality or other insisted on by the local authorities. While we took our meal, we received several visits. The first to come was a judge from the town of Amnet, twelve leagues from Ubon, who was on his way to Bangkok, and was good enough to take charge of a short note to Monseigneur Vey giving him news of us. By degrees all these folks disappeared on their way south, in the direction by which we had come. About 2 o'clock we too started. We had been on the march for about three quarters of an hour when we reached the custom-house of Sak\u00e9o, which is situated on the side of a road as large and straight as ours in Europe. It goes from the province of\nKabin to Battambang. Constructed originally by a Phya (high Siamese official) to secure easy communication with the Cambodian provinces subject to Siam, this road might be of the greatest use to travellers. But since the date of its construction it has not received any repairs whatever, and the forest therefore is taking possession of it again. In this very year (1884) a telegraph line has been erected along this road, over its entire length, by the agency of Frenchmen from Saigon (this line goes from Saigon to Bangkok). In the evening we camped at a pool called Nong Salika. A caravan of Chinese traders from Sourin had established themselves before our arrival, and among them was the nephew of an old Chinese Christian whom I had known at Bangkok. He was travelling towards Kabin to sell skins, silk, etc., and intended to bring back with him cloth, hardware, etc. His correspondent at Kabin being a Christian, I entrusted him with a second letter for Bangkok.\n\nThursday, 28th.\u2014At 3 p.m. we reached the frontier of the province of Vathana. We were all fasting, and we established ourselves in the sheds which had been built for the workmen employed on the telegraph line. Night had already fallen when we heard the sound of a band of men advancing in our direction. P\u00e8re Xavier got up to see what was happening, and saw a black mass a few feet in front of him. \"Who goes there?\" \"Phra Aphai.\" Torches were bought and P\u00e8re Xavier then saw that the black mass was an elephant of the largest size followed by two smaller ones. The travellers were in search of a lodging for the night, and as there still remained one large shed unoccupied, they settled themselves down in that.\n\nFriday, 29th.\u2014To-day we rested, and watched at our leisure the travellers of last night. Their chief is a Cambodian mandarin subordinate to Siam. Of the three elephants which he had with him, two were intended for the King of Siam as presents.\n\nThe mandarin came to pay us a visit, and informed us of the object of his journey. He is, he said, the son of Phya Anuphat (a high official) and the second mandarin of the Province\nof Siem-rab. In return for the elephants which he was going to offer to the King, he hoped for certain favours. We paid a visit to the Governor, for whom we had brought letters from Bangkok. His house is a tumble-down affair. He is of Laosian race, about sixty years old, and has under his government about two or three hundred houses scattered about in the forest, the population of which is Cambodian.\n\nSaturday, 1st March.\u2014For the last time we crossed the telegraph line, which we then quitted in order to take the road to Nong-bua (pool of Lokas). At one o'clock we resumed our journey, and camped in the evening at the village of Bang-sang inhabited by Laosians.\n\nSunday, 2nd.\u2014Our itinerary instructed us to go by Nong-phi, and Tong-nong\u2014two pools which are close to the roadside\u2014but the dryness of the weather obliged us to take another course, viz., by Ban-kin. Starting at half-past two, we travelled through forest, everything being most distressingly dry; at night we slept in the forest, the bullocks having to go without water. Our rice was cooked with the little which we had in reserve.\n\nMonday, 3rd.\u2014At ten o'clock we arrived at Ban-kin. Water good and abundant. At two o'clock the signal for departure was given, but two bullocks were missing and had to be recovered. We got away at last. Road bad. On the left a chain of mountains of considerable height was observable. At night we camped on the banks of a pool.\n\nTuesday, 4th.\u2014Excellent water in the morning, muddy water in the evening.\n\nWednesday, 5th.\u2014In the evening we arrived at the village of Huari-Sameron and pushed on to Kra-sa-m\u00ebmai, where we passed the night in the middle of a field.\n\nThursday, 6th.\u2014Early in the morning the headman of the village visited us at our camp, and brought us the provisions which we had asked for the night before on our arrival. These consisted of rice, fowls and red chillies. We were able also to procure here an additional cart for eleven ticals; this extra assistance was absolutely necessary, for we were ap-\nproaching a chain of mountains which we should have to cross in order to reach the plateau of Ubon. About half past four we emerged in an extensive clearing covered with reeds which were still green; we judged that we should here find the water we wanted so much, and we found accordingly a clear and abundant supply.\n\nFriday, 7th.\u2014We reached Puthai-saman at a tolerably early hour. Puthai-saman was formerly an important town, or perhaps rather an imposing temple erected to the worship of Buddha. It is one of those monuments of Cambodia which are so much renowned, and which astonish all travellers by their original and beautiful architecture. These monuments indicate the existence, among the people who conceived and carried them out, of a very advanced degree of civilization. We were tempted to inspect one of these precious specimens of the architecture of the Khmers, as savants would say.\n\nIt was not more than eight o'clock when we reached the east gate of the ruined city, which is flanked on its four sides by an enormous moat filled with water, the breadth of which is at least from thirty to forty metres. The sides of the moat are composed of enormous blocks of Bien-hoa stone and have a slope of about forty-five degrees. Everything was hidden from view by large trees, creepers, shrubs, and high grass which have taken possession of the locality. We camped outside the east gate. While breakfast was being got ready, I penetrated into the middle of the ruins. I shall not undertake to give a very exact description of them. This has already been done by the numerous learned travellers who have written about the ruins of Angkor-vat and Angkor-lom. The plan, the buildings, the details, are the same in all. Everything has been reproduced, down to the smallest piece of carving. These ruins differ one from another only in area. Puthai-saman seems to be Angkor-vat on a reduced scale.\n\nFollow me then step by step through the midst of colossal statues lying on the ground, stepping over a fragment of fallen wall, or a tree lying prostrate on the ruins. I reached the east gate by an immense causeway or bridge spanning the moat which I have just mentioned. On both sides, and an-\nswering the purpose of parapets, there are colossal statues of Siva, seated, and with the head turned three-quarters-face towards the traveller as he advances. Nothing is left of these now but the pedestals, the various parts lying on the ground or in the moat. I measured, out of curiosity, a fragment of one of these statues from the lower lip to the top of the head; the measurement was 0m.60, with a distance of 0m.50 from one ear to the other. A few paces further on I found the neck and upper part of the chest of the same statue, this fragment being deeply embedded in the ground. The designs with which the neck and chest are ornamented, are executed with much delicacy, and have resisted the ravages of time. This causeway must be that which they call the bridge, or the gate, of the giants. At the end of it there is a thick wall, in the middle of which is a gateway adorned with sculptures, and grotesque monsters. A little further on is seen a little building which gives one the idea of a chapel.\n\nIt is a tolerably broad corridor pierced with windows on the side facing south. These windows are fitted with bars of rounded stone, each being of a different shape or pattern. The vaulted roof, which is somewhat of the ogival shape, is entirely of hewn stones one placed over the other. Looking closely at the structure, no trace of timber, lime, or iron is to be seen in the walls, all the blocks are fitted together, and placed one on the other. The blocks are enormous, ten men could hardly lift one of them. A sculptured ornament occupies the centre of the vault. In the middle of the building, on a pile of stones, pious visitors have deposited a statue of Buddha seated on snakes, the heads of which spread out like a fan behind him. The whole building is of pyramidal shape.\n\nBetween the eastern and southern gates, there is an immense wall about 40 or 50 m\u00e8tres in length, and 3 or 4 m\u00e8tres in height, the inner surface of which is entirely covered with bas-reliefs relating probably to the fabulous births of Buddha. These sculptures are still in good preservation. It would seem that this series of sculptures used to be protected by a covered gallery, which has fallen down, and the ruins of which lie about the base of the wall where the explanatory inscription ought to be found. I reached the southern gate;\nit is now nothing more than an enormous heap of ruins on which trees and creepers grow at pleasure. It was in the midst of these that I made these hasty notes. Several doors and windows, however, were to be seen, appearing out of the ruins. I sounded all the parts of these. Returning to the southern gate, I continued to follow the long wall of bas-reliefs. Here the direction in which the figures are walking changed. On the wall which terminates at the southern gate they were walking towards the East; now they were advancing towards the West. This southern gate\u2014I speak of the inner erection which must have been the palace, or a great temple raised in honour of Buddha\u2014furnishes access to four porticoes of colossal proportions, the roofs of all being composed of enormous blocks of stone shaped and placed one on the other. I continued to climb over the blocks lying about in all directions, and I reached a series of galleries in sufficiently good preservation to allow one to judge of the general plan. Here, as in almost all similar buildings of the races of Indo-China, the outside is generally finished while the inside, on the contrary, is hardly commenced. Is this intentional, or was the work abandoned before it was completed? Many savants are of the latter opinion. The gallery which I traversed is in the shape of a cross; it joins other galleries, the point of intersection being in all cases topped by a dome or a pyramid. In one of the doorways, there was still to be seen a frame of carved wood partly destroyed by white ants and exposure. In the opposite doorway, there is also a little fragment, but these were the only traces of wood I could find. In a small inner court near the doors and windows, there are statues of Siva let into the wall; the figure wears a diadem on its head, and holds a lotus in one hand, and a garland or snake in the other. The neck is ornamented with a phallus, and the feet with two rings. Beyond this court, a pyramid rises above a doorway; the stones are so put together as to form the features of a fabulous personage. This figure is repeated on all four sides. At the present time only one remains, all the others have fallen down.\n\nIn front of the south gate and spanning an inner moat, there is a large causeway, not so long as the one outside the main enclosure, which is bordered by fragments of a balustrade\nlike those of Angkor-vat, a long dragon supported on the knees of a whole row of seated statues; these have the legs crossed and one of the hands under one thigh.\n\nAfter two hours spent in crossing these ruins, I endeavoured to make a plan of all that I had seen. This city or temple is built according to regular bearings, and forms a complete square.\n\nOn the four sides, each facing one of the cardinal points, enormous causeways thrown across a broad and deep moat gave access to the inner side of the outer wall. In front of these gateways, about three or four metres from the moat, and as if intended to protect the entrance, there were square enclosures, provided with a single door, above which rose a pile of cruciform buildings topped by pyramids.\n\nThe inner buildings, which it would be difficult to describe, were surrounded by a second ditch, less broad and deep than the first. There were four gates magnificently sculptured and defended, as it were, by monstrous figures with human bodies and hideous faces\u2014regular demons. The general mass of buildings was composed of galleries all connected one with another and crowned with domes at the points where they crossed; these domes were more and more lofty in proportion as they approached the centre, the middle one towering above all the others. The coping of all the walls, whether inner or outer, is formed of little sema (mounds) * in the middle of which is a Buddha seated. The large moat is kept abundantly supplied with water from two little streams.\n\nSaturday, 8th.\u2014It was with regret that we quitted these ruins. Who can tell us their story? What has become of those who built this city? Learned authorities are reduced to conjectures. The people of the country can furnish nothing but fabulous legends; according to them, these buildings are the work of the angels. After a troublesome journey through dense forest we camped on the banks of a muddy pool.\n\nSunday, 9th.\u2014After breakfast P\u00e8re Xavier went ahead to purchase provisions and to hire men and carts to enable us to\n\n* Sema, the sign by which a grave is known; a mound, a barrow.\ncross the mountain. In two days we shall be there; the village of Phra Sat Sing, towards which we are advancing, is the last which we shall pass before arriving at the range. We passed the night under some large sheds, built to accommodate a white elephant which is to be brought down from Bassai to Bangkok. I went to look for water, and found a pool; a wolf made off as I approached, leaving the carcase of a deer almost intact. This was at once flayed, and the meat spread out in the sun to be dried and salted. P\u00e8re Xavier then came in, having obtained the promise of two additional carts.\n\nNot far from Phra Sat Sing is a very ancient ruined pagoda. Local tradition makes it co-eval with the erection of Phuthaisaman, partly because of the similarity of the building materials in the two places, and partly because of certain carvings. This ruin did not seem to me to present any great interest.\n\nMonday, 10th.\u2014A journey under difficulties. The bullocks were vicious, the wheels came to grief, the spare cattle went astray and had to be hunted up, the rice was left behind in one of the carts which was in the rear, etc., etc. Evening saw us at Huai-pha-sai-tia.\n\nTuesday, 11th.\u2014A pleasant journey. P\u00e8re Xavier was lost, but turned up again safely.\n\nWednesday, 12th.\u2014At 8 o\u2019clock we commenced the ascent. The little range of hills which we had to cross is neither high nor broad, the highest point does not exceed probably 200 m\u00e8tres, and a good walker could easily get across in four or five hours. But the road is something indescribable, a perfect goat\u2019s path; the carts had to follow it, nevertheless. We tackled it accordingly, dragging the carts, one by one, from one boulder to another, by main force. At about 2 o\u2019clock we had got over about 200 m\u00e8tres of road and had attained an elevation of about 50 m\u00e8tres. A good meal awaited the labourers, and all did justice to it; the bullocks were sent to graze at the foot of the hills. In the evening, we continued our journey, following a little valley which led to another hill, which may be considered as one of the peaks of the pass over which we crossed. We passed the night at the top of this.\nThursday, 13th.\u2014After crossing a ravine, we gained the plateau beyond. We were about to push on to the top, when a Cambodian caravan, consisting of thirty carts, on its way from Sourin to Battambang, came in sight on the only road. We passed the night on the road.\n\nFriday, 14th.\u2014After the morning\u2019s stage, we halted on the banks of a pool. Another Cambodian caravan, composed of twenty carts, passed close to us. This one came from Sourin and was bound for Nakhon Siemrab in Cambodia, on the banks of the Touli-sap (great lake) to buy fish.\n\nWe reached the plateau of Korat, all the chief difficulties being passed. About one o\u2019clock we were able to camp for the night under the sheds prepared for the white elephant. In the evening another train of Cambodians passed, coming from Korat and going to buy fish at Siemrab.\n\nSaturday, 15th.\u2014After great difficulty in renewing our stores of provisions, we started and passed through the village of Ban Kham. The road passes through an open undulating country. The forest has been cleared over a great stretch of ground, and there is an extensive view. Towards the East, a hill was visible, which is probably a portion of the range which we had just left. The soil was now less dry, and we came across numerous springs, some of which were ferruginous. It was still broad daylight when we entered \u00dalok. We pitched our tent close to that place.\n\nSunday, 16th.\u2014A day of rest. Splendid pasture.\n\nMonday, 17th.\u2014We left the village of \u00dalok at dawn. Beautiful vegetation was on all sides of us. If the country were not so often harried by bands of ruffians, numerous villages might exist here comfortably. On our left, we passed one of many abandoned villages. Robbers had carried off everything, and had then set fire to it. We reached Ban-nai-mut and then Ban-khu, making the latter our halting-place.\n\nTuesday, 18th.\u2014We passed through the village of Bak-tran, halting at night at Ban-dai.\n\nWednesday, 19th.\u2014We skirted the village of Ban-kathum. The head-man, hearing of our approach, came to meet us in\norder to warn us to keep away. Small-pox was making great ravages in the village. Detained by a storm, we passed the night in an old pagoda of the village of Tamnon.\n\nThursday, 20th.\u2014There are still three or four more provinces through which we have to pass and then we shall reach the end of our journey. The first thing in the morning we set off in the direction of Muang Songl\u00e9, under a pelting shower of rain, and reached the shelter prepared for the white elephant, where we breakfasted. An hour\u2019s march brought us to Muang Songl\u00e9. As we left the forest, we could see the town on a slight eminence. The scene is a most charming one, the lofty stems of palms and betel-nut trees forming a perfect bouquet of verdure, while the houses are lost to view behind the leaves of bananas. We camped on the north side, occupying a building set apart for the use of travellers on the banks of a stream, whose waters fall into the Seimun, the river of \u00dcbon.\n\nFriday, 21st.\u2014We reached the village of Ban Nong Mek. In this part of the country, numerous pines are intermingled with the forest trees. We camped at the village of Sameron.\n\nSaturday, 22nd.\u2014Our guide was to have taken us by Khan-tararum, but he missed the way, and we went by Ban Huai and Pi Nai.\n\nSunday, 23rd.\u2014We were taken to the site of a village which had been plundered and abandoned. Here we established ourselves for a couple of days.\n\nMonday, 24th.\u2014Went out shooting green pigeons and peacocks.\n\nTuesday, 25th.\u2014We reached Khu Khane a little before midday. Once more the building erected for accommodation of the white elephant and his attendants served as our place of shelter. Two days before, according to the inhabitants, two Europeans had halted at the same place, but from what they said I concluded that these must have been Cambodian half-castes. They came to sell opium. We passed through the village of Ban Sami\u00e9 and at ten o\u2019clock at night we reached Ban Xam Lom.\nWednesday, 26th.\u2014This plain is covered with numerous villages. We passed the night at Ban Pheng-puai.\n\nThursday, 27th.\u2014We breakfasted at the village of Ban Thum. At night we travelled by torch-light. When we were within half a kilom\u00e8tre of the village where we intended to sleep, a wheel of one of the carts gave away, a section of the tire and three spokes being broken. It was impossible to make the necessary repairs on the spot, so I left the cart and bullocks under the charge of three men and went on to the village with the other carts. There I had a wheel taken off one of the latter, to take the place of the broken one of the cart which had been left behind. During the night the broken wheel was repaired.\n\nFriday, 28th.\u2014We left the village of Ban Song Sang, where we had slept, with the intention of going as far as Ban Nong. We passed the huai (torrent) of Khajung by a large bridge built in the preceding year. The bridge was a good one, but the roadway, being formed of planks placed loosely on the cross-pieces, reminded one of the keys of a piano as the carts went over it. The road presented no difficulties, so, notwithstanding darkness, we pushed on by torchlight. At last, as our guides no longer knew the way, we camped where we were, for fear of going wrong. Our compass shewed us the blunder which the guides were making; our right course was N. E. and we were going N. W.\n\nSaturday, 29th.\u2014In the morning, after some search, we hit upon the right road, about six hundred m\u00e8tres to our left. The mistake was quickly rectified, and the country being level and free from underwood, we were able to make short cuts. We passed Ban Khin and then Ban Non Noi and Ban Non Jai and slept at Ban Kho, the last village before Ubon. We slept in the midst of carts which had pulled up on the road.\n\nSunday, 30th.\u2014This very day we were to be at Ubon! We set off in advance at a canter. In an hour we were on the banks of the S\u00eaimun, opposite the town. The river, though very low at that time, seemed as broad as the Loire at the Pont de la Belle Croix, at Nantes. We followed the bank upstream, it being about six o'clock in the morning. P\u00e8re\nXavier pointed out to me the site of our station, but I could not make it out in consequence of the trees and bushes which cover the banks. We soon dismounted and fired several rounds. I blew a horn also. We were heard; the children were the first to arrive, followed soon after by the grown-up people. Mass was just over when our signals announced our arrival. The two P\u00e8res came down at last; not too robust either of them, fever having tried them severely. They procured us a boat which took us across the river with our steeds. With what joy did we embrace one another!\n\nOur first act was to enter the humble chapel and to thank God for the protection granted to us by Him during so long a journey. Some hours later our carts arrived, and during the afternoon we conveyed them across in boats. Blessed be God for ever.\n\nG. DABIN.\n\nUbon, 30th March, 1884.\n\n[In their Annual Report for 1883,* the Council of this Society made an appeal to those who are favourably placed for the purpose, to further the objects of the Society. Allusion was made to the exceptional opportunities for observation possessed by the French Missionaries in the East. The foregoing paper shews that that appeal has not been in vain and it is with great pleasure that I have performed the task of translating from the French the MS. sent to me through the Revd. N. J.

It was to no purpose that his widow offered to pay one hundred thousand ducats if their lives were spared.\n\nIntent then on revenging herself, she promised her daughter in marriage to a Moor called Paticatir (Osorius calls him Pasecatir and Maffejus, Quitirius) who had been appointed head of the Moors by Albuquerque, on condition that he should avenge the death of her husband, son and brother-in-law, Paticatir having often previously in vain asked for her hand while Isutinutis was still alive.\n\n(1) \"Pati Cnus\" according to Faria y Souza, who afterwards became King of Sunda.\nThe marriage having been concluded quite secretly, the widow engaged 6,000 troops, and with their aid attempted to carry his plots into execution, but Albuquerque put him to flight on the first engagement, and thus broke up at once all his power and influence.\n\nHaving established peace here in 1511, Albuquerque appointed Rodrigo Brit Patalyn first Governor of Malakka, and Ninachetu Shahbandar and head of the Moors. Sainaladin, the King of Pasi (P\u00e2sci), who had once before deserted to Mahmud, was again restored to favour, but notwithstanding went over a second time to the enemies of Albuquerque.\n\nAlbuquerque then left Malakka in charge of Patalyn with a garrison of 300 Portuguese, sent one of his captains with a squadron of ten sail to the Singapore Straits, and returned with four vessels to Malaar (Malabar?) to keep a watchful eye upon the plots of Abadilchain against Goa.\n\nHe, however, not only failed to carry out his expedition, but narrowly escaped with his life, his vessel having struck and sunk in a storm off Pasi on the Island of Sumatra. Though this happened at night, he and his crew were saved; but he lost Nakhoda Begua's bracelet with the precious blood-stanching stone. (1)\n\nAfter suffering many distresses and being almost starved, they arrived safely at Cucheen (Cochin on West Coast of India) in February, 1512.\n\nMeantime the Portuguese (at Malakka) had been again attacked by Paticatir, but he was so completely defeated by Petrejus Andrado that he did not venture a further attempt. The Pati Onius (2) previously mentioned from Jap\u00e2ra, who had eight years before promised his aid to R\u00e2ja Isutinutis, now at last appeared before Malakka with a fleet of 3,000 (3) sail, having secured at the same time many adherents in the town itself, but he likewise met with total defeat, and barely succeeded\n\n(1) For an account of this wonderful ornament, see pp. 73 and 74 Journal, S.B., R.A.S., No. 13 for June, 1884, and note.\n(2) P\u00e2ti \u00danus.\n(3) Faria y Sousa says ninety sail, which sounds more probable, with 1,200 men (an average of 133 to each vessel) and a good supply of artillery.\nin escaping himself in a small craft, the only one left of the whole fleet, after losing more than 8,000 men. (1) The loss of the Portuguese on the other hand was not more than 20 men killed though they had many wounded in this severe engagement. The Portuguese Governor Patalyn and his Captain Andrado were much praised by Albuquerque for their gallant behaviour.\n\nOnce again Malakka ran the risk of being reconquered by the Malay kings. Taehar Madjelis (Tuanno Maselis according to Portuguese historians) a Moor from Bengal, was the originator of this new plot. Being on good terms with one Peter Person, a friend of the Governor, he had arranged with his adherents that he should first kill Person, and this was to be the signal for a general massacre. A few days afterwards having been invited to dinner by Person, he tried to execute his plot, but instead of killing Person, he only wounded him; this of course caused an alarm and frustrated all their plans. (2)\n\n---\n\n(1) Faria y Souza's account agrees as to the completeness of Pati Unus's defeat, but differs in his account of his fleet, concerning which he remarks:\u2014\"Several of his ships were equal in size to the largest Portuguese galleons, and the one destined for himself was larger than any ships then built by the Europeans.\" And, again:\u2014\"After a furious battle of some endurance, Unus fled, and was pursued all the way to Java, where he preserved his own vast vessel as a memorial of his escape, and of the grandeur of his fleet, and not without reason, as a merchant of Malakka engaged to purchase it of Percy for 10,000 ducats if taken.\"\n\n(2) Faria y Souza's account of this affair is as follows:\u2014King Mahomet had not yet lost all hope of recovering Malakka, to which he now drew near: and having in vain attempted to succeed by force, he had recourse to stratagem. For this purpose he prevailed on a favourite officer named Juan Maxiliz to imitate the conduct of Zopirus at Babylon. Being accordingly mutilated, Juan fled with some companions to Malakka, giving out that he had escaped from the tyrannical cruelty of his sovereign. Ruy de Brito, who then commanded in the citadel of Malakka, credited his story, and reposed so much confidence in his fidelity that he was admitted at all times into the fortress. At length, having appointed a particular day for the\nWhen the King of Djohor found that all his attempts miscarried, he deemed it advisable to conclude a permanent peace with the Portuguese (1514), which was preserved for some years.\n\nThe Viceroy Alfonsus Albukirk sent his cousin George Albukirk the same year (1514), to Malakka to succeed the valiant Rodrigo Patalyn as second Governor of that place (Malakka).\n\nNinachetu was dismissed at the same time, and the King of Campar appointed Shahbandar (1) in his place (no one knew the cause of his dismissal); he was so chagrined at this that he committed suicide by burning himself on a pile after delivering a solemn speech to the people.\n\nAbdallah, the King of Campar, was soon afterwards attacked by the King of Bentan, but with the assistance of the Portuguese easily beat off his enemy. But some years later the King of Djohor induced the Portuguese, by false imputations, to suspect the King of Campar his own son-in-law, so that they bribed assassins to kill him; but it is also said that he was publicly executed on a charge of conspiring to surrender Malakka to the enemies of the Portuguese. (2)\n\n---\n\n(1) Faria y Souza says \"Bandara,\" i.e. \"Bendahara.\"\n\n(2) This is the account given by Faria y Souza, who says that Mahomed, the King of Johor, caused it to be noised abroad that Abdullah, his own son-in-law, had gone to Malacca with his knowledge and consent for the express purpose of getting an opportunity of seizing the fort by a sudden and unexpected attack, which false\nGeorge Brit succeeded (1515) George Albuquerque as third Governor of Malakka, just before the arrival of the new Viceroy of India, Lopez Toarez Alvarenga, successor of Alfonsus Albukirk.\n\nNothing of importance happened while Brit was Governor. He died here (at Malakka) in 1517. This death gave rise to sharp disputes between two high Portuguese Officials as to the succession, and Ferdinand Petrejus Andrado, who touched at Malakka on his voyage homewards from China, tried in vain to reconcile them. Meantime whilst Nuguez Vasco Pereira was temporarily administering the Government, Alfonsus Lopez Costa had been appointed fourth Governor of Malakka by King Emanuel.\n\nThe King of Djohor, being disinclined to suffer the Portuguese to remain any longer in such quiet possession of Malakka, waged war against them once more, attacked them suddenly, and had some very sharp engagements with one Alexis de Menezes, (1) the Portuguese commander, but without obtaining the slightest advantage. When de Menezes had left, the King resumed his attack on the town, besieged the fortress for seventeen days, and made an assault on it, but was repulsed by the Portuguese. After this last defeat he remained quiet for a short time.\n\nThe new Viceroy, Didacus Lopez Sequeira, appointed one Correa Captain of the Portuguese Garrison at this place in 1519 to frustrate the repeated attacks of King Ahmed Sjah, and one Garcia de Sala to be fifth Governor to relieve the invalid Governor Alfonsus Lopez Costa.\n\nA little before this the King of Djohor had made another attack upon the town, but being again repulsed with great\n\nreport obtained credence from the Portuguese Commander and led to Abdullah's downfall. This, he says, led to the natives, who much appreciated Abdullah's administration, leaving Malacca in such numbers that it was almost left desolate.\n\n(1) According to Faria y Souza, this attack was made in the time of Brit (or Brito), and De Menezes arrived to assume the Government with a reinforcement of 300 men just in time to prevent Malakka falling into the hands of the enemy, and appointed Costa Deputy Governor in place of Brito, who was dying.\nloss and disgrace, (1) he abandoned his plans for a long time.\n\nIn 1521 Garcia de Sala was succeeded by another Governor. During his governorship George Albukirk and Antonio Brit came this way for the purpose of besieging Bintam, but it did not come to anything. (2) Garcia de Sala in that year (1521) resigned the governorship to George Albukirk, who was thus the sixth Portuguese Governor. In 1522 the people of Bintam again came forth against Malakka with eighty vessels, but George Albukirk having been already informed that the Laksamana of Djohor was coming with a numerous and powerful fleet, despatched a strong Portuguese fleet to meet him, and a fierce fight ensued. Sixty-five Portuguese were killed, and their vessels were compelled to retreat to Malakka; the Laksamana likewise quietly withdrew.\n\nMeantime several Portuguese, who had landed at Pahang in ignorance that the King there was son-in-law to the King of Djohor were murdered; many others were compelled by the King of Djohor to embrace the Mahomedan faith, while those who refused to do so were tied to the mouth of a cannon and blown to pieces.\n\nAbout this time also a force from Bintam appeared before the town (Malakka) took Simon de Breo and thirteen Portuguese by surprise, slew them all, and burnt their vessels. Garcia Henrik who, on his return from the Moluccas, was cruising off the island of Bintam, was drawn into an ambuscade by the vessels of the Laksamana, lost both his vessels, and was obliged to retreat to Malakka after making a gallant defence, in which almost all his men were killed.\n\nAll these small advantages gained over the Portuguese made the King of Djohor so proud, that he again entertained the idea of attacking Malakka by sea and land and making a\n\n(1) Faria y Souza says the King of Bintang (Bentan) which is practically the same thing, and that the Portuguese succeeded in taking the Malay Fort at Moar with 300 cannon.\n\n(2) Faria y Souza describes Bentan as \"having two strong castles and its rivers staked to prevent the access of ships, so that it was considered almost impregnable, and though Albuquerque went with 18 vessels and 690 men, he was obliged to retire.\"\nfresh effort to expel the Portuguese. He then collected a force of 20,000 men, 16,000 of which he despatched by land under the command of a renegade Portuguese Captain called Amlaar, while the Laksamana had to take the other 4,000 men to blockade the Malakka roadstead.\n\nAmlaar immediately marched on the town and very soon succeeded in making a trench sixty palisades wide near the village of Quillyn [i.e., Kampong Kling, as it is termed], but he was unable to take advantage of it, for George Albukirk had it repaired at once.\n\nThe siege lasted for about a month, after which it was raised and the besiegers beat a retreat, on hearing that relief had been sent from Goa. This happened about 1525. They had hardly left when Martyn Alfonso de Souza arrived with a fleet to the rescue of the town, and he was told that during the siege people had paid fifty ducats for a fowl.\n\nThe Governor appointed the said de Souza Admiral of the Portuguese fleet in place of his cousin Garcia Henrique, and the very first act of the new Admiral was to blockade the river of Bintam with five vessels and so prevent the entrance or egress of anything.\n\nIn 1526 Peter Mascarenhas was appointed Governor of Malakka, being the seventh Portuguese Governor.\n\nThe King of Djohor soon after again besieged the town, but the brave Mascarenhas would not brook such provocation; he began to take aggressive action, and declared war against the King of Bintam, who called his son-in-law of Pahang to his aid, but both the Laksamana of Bintam and the King of Pahang's Admiral were completely defeated and put to flight, and the Portuguese conquered the whole island (i.e., Bentan). The said King of Bintam (a creature of the King of Djohor, the lawful King having been expelled) died of grief soon after. The other King then re-appeared and submitted to the Portuguese who restored him to his throne.\n\n(1) Faria y Souza states that Mascarenhas took Bentan with twenty-one ships and four hundred Portuguese soldiers and six hundred Malays under Tuan Mahomed and one Sinai Raja, though it was well fortified and defended by seven thousand men.\nAfter the taking of Bintam, the King of Djohor left the Portuguese unmolested for some time.\n\nIn 1527 Georg Kapraal was appointed eighth Governor of Malakka, and nothing of importance occurred during his government, the King of Djohor being still at peace with the Portuguese.\n\nIn 1528 the Viceroy Lopez de Sampaio appointed Peter de Far ninth Governor of Malakka, and his government was also a peaceful one, the King of Djohor not having yet recovered the shock his power had received.\n\nIn 1529 Garcia de Sa arrived at Malakka as the tenth Portuguese Governor.\n\nThe inhabitants of Atsjien (in Sumatra) gave him much trouble, but we will treat the subject later, when we deal with the affairs of that island, mentioning only this that Garcia having discovered that one Sanage was conspiring with the enemy ordered him to be thrown out of the tower of the fortress.\n\nI cannot say who succeeded Garcia de Sa as Governor of Malakka, but I have been able to trace the names and dates of the following Governors, viz., Stephanus Gama in 1537, Ruy Paz Pareira in 1545, Simon Melo in 1547, Pedro de Silva in 1551, and his brother Don Albaro Ataydo in 1552.\n\nI am equally ignorant of the names of the Governors from the last-mentioned date up to 1604, when that brave Portuguese Don Andrea Furtado de Mendoza (of whom we will speak more at length later) administered the supreme authority as Governor of this place.\n\nWe cannot say much about the events of that period, the Portuguese historians having recorded nothing about them.\n\nAhmed Sjah, the exhausted King of Djohor (i.e., after the failure of his repeated attacks on the Portuguese), continued to rule his country till 1540, and was succeeded after a reign of twenty-seven years by Sultan Alawoddin Sjah, (\"Ala-eddin Shah,\" Malaice \"Ala-udin\") who was the fourteenth King of the Malays, the second of Djohor, and the eighth Mahomedan King.\nIt was during the reign of this King (9th October, 1547) that the Achinese laid siege to Malakka, causing damage to the value of more than a million, and only raising the siege on account of famine.\n\nWe have found nothing recorded of the life of this King and of his successor, beyond the fact that he reigned 19 years, i.e., from 1540 to 1559, and that he was succeeded by Sultan Abdul Djalil Sjah as the fifteenth King of the Malays, the third of Djohor, and the ninth Mahomedan King.\n\nThis prince ruled this people 32 years, died in 1591, and was succeeded by Sultan Alawoddin Sjah III. He, the sixteenth King of the Malays, the fourth of Djohor, and the tenth Mahomedan King, reigned 19 years.\n\nIt seems to me that the first Dutch made their appearance either at this place (Malakka) or at Djohor in the twelfth or thirteenth year of this reign (i.e., in 1603 or 1604).\n\nIt appears also that he (Alawoddin Sjah III) was styled Yangdipertuan, that he resided at Batoe Sabar, (2) six miles higher up the river (i.e., above Johor Lama) and that he had a brother, called Radja Bongsoe, who lived on friendly terms with the Dutch.\n\n(1) Faria y Souza makes it in October, 1571, and states that the Achinese raised the siege on Tristran Vaz de Vega completely defeating a Malay fleet in the Moar river; it may be a separate occasion, but it looks like the same, and Souza makes no mention of the one referred to at the date given in the text, which seems to have been so serious that he would hardly have omitted to notice it.\n\nHe also mentions in the time of de Vega an attack on Malacca by a fleet sent by the Queen of Jap\u00e1ra consisting of eighty large galleons and two hundred and twenty smaller vessels, but the besiegers were severely defeated after a siege of three months. This was almost immediately followed by an attack by the Achinese, who, however, abandoned the siege in a panic, thinking there were some special stratagems being devised against them, when as a matter of fact, the Portuguese were in sore straits, and might easily have been overcome.\n\n(2) \"Sawar\" said to mean a kind of fishing-weir. (See Malay Proverbs, No. 2 of Journ., S.B., R.A.S., p. 145.)\nI find that one Roche de Mello was Portuguese Governor of Malakka in 1598.\n\nI think that probably Admiral Jacob Heemskerk was the first of our people who had any trade with the King of Djohor: he captured a large Portuguese carrack on his return voyage from China, touched at Djohor, and left behind there in 1603 one Jacob Buyzen, who would, he was sure, be treated as a friend, the King being a mortal foe of the Portuguese, and doing his utmost to harass them.\n\nWhen in October, 1603, the vessels Ziericzee and Hollandse Thuyn (Dutch garden) under the command of Commodore Jacob Pieterzoon van Enkhuyzen (forming part of the fleet under Wybrand van Warwyck) arrived at the Singapore Straits, they met with a prahu or canoe of the King of Djohor bringing a letter from Jacob Buyzen, which informed them that during the last month two Portuguese men-of-war, four galleys, and twenty smaller craft had arrived at that place, under the command of Estevan Teixeira de Made, a man of great fame: that these vessels were waiting for some ships, which were expected to arrive there within a couple of months from Japan and Macassar, and which they had to escort safely to Malakka out of danger from the Dutch vessels.\n\nIt appeared from a letter of the supercargo Jacob Buyzen, dated the 7th October, that the Portuguese of Malakka were besieging Djohor, and the King wrote to our Commodore to beg him most earnestly, that our troops might assist him in relieving his city from this siege. Buyzen added, besides, that Radja Bongsoe, the King's brother, intended to come very soon on board the Commodore's vessel and to remain there till their joint efforts should have vanquished the Portuguese; it, was this very Radja Bongsoe who was with Admiral Heemskerk when he had captured the carrack already mentioned.\n\nOur Commodore then gave battle to the Portuguese fleet during the whole day and put her to flight right through ours, whereupon Radja Bongsoe and Jacob Buyzen after having witnessed this naval combat, arrived on board the Commodore's vessel, and Radja Bongsoe after having thanked him cordially for the eminent service he had done them, presented him with a fine kris, after which he and Buyzen left him.\nThe only losses we suffered in that fight, were five or six men killed, and a few men wounded on both vessels. The King of Djohor, much pleased with this victory, and with our assistance, arrived that very night with his fleet of forty prahus and four or five fine galleys near our two vessels, when he was visited by our Commodore in his own galley, to whom that Prince likewise showed his gratitude by presenting him with a splendid kris.\n\nWhen the Commodore made some inquiries about pepper, the King answered him, that he would be able to forward some to him within a short time, if his river were kept open and free.\n\nRadja Bongsoe, accompanied by many Malay gentlemen, came again on board of the vessel Ziericzee on the 10th October: we fought the Portuguese that day, and put them again ot flight, but the King, though he was present with his prahus, left all the work to be done by us, and only looked on.\n\nHe then visited the Commodore accompanied by his two brothers (one of whom was the King of Siak), and offered him his thanks; the Commodore then presented him with a Japanese sword with a silver hilt and sheath, and Radja Bongsoe with a fine musket, whereupon that Prince took leave of him.\n\nOn the 1st September, 1603, Andrea Furtado de Mendoza succeeding Fernando Albukirk as Governor of Malakka, as Governor-General of the Southern Provinces of India, and as Commander-in-Chief of the royal fleet, sent in the beginning of 1604 an Ambassador to the said King of Djohor to acquaint him with this change, and to announce to him that he wished to live in peace with him, though he had been at war with the former Governor of Malakka.\n\nThe King sent the reply, that he too desired to make peace, but that he wanted to know first the terms of that peace.\n\nDon Andrea Furtado then required that the King should part with the Dutch (having dealt already too much with them), deliver them up to him, and deprive them of their property, and he informed him that there should never be peace if the King of Djohor would not accept the said conditions. On the 8th February the King gave a flat refusal, and briefly said that he would rather see his whole country ruined than\nbetray or deliver up the Dutch, who stood under his protection.\n\nThe 3rd May, 1604, Admiral Warwyck having returned to the Djohor river, the King presented him with two and a half bharas of pepper, whilst he presented the King with a quantity of powder and some balls. He sailed again on the 20th of the same month.\n\nIn February 1605, Furtado resolved to besiege Batoe Sabar, but when he heard that our Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck was in its very neighbourhood, he gave up his plan.\n\nOn the 14th of the same month, our Admiral was informed, that in the meantime the Portuguese fleet had been reinforced considerably, numbering now 7 men-of-war, 30 bantings, 20 galleys, and 19 Javanese sampans, and further that Andrea Furtado had threatened the King with an early visit, and if he again failed to conquer Batoe Sabar he would willingly pay the King tribute.\n\nIn the meantime some vessels of our fleet, under the command of Admiral C. Sebastiaanse, had captured off Patani a fine and richly laden Portuguese carrack, called St. Anthony, and the Wissingen (joining the said Admiral's squadron off Patani in February that year) had also captured on the 14th January, 1605, off Pedra Blanca another carrack coming from Cochin-China and consigned to Don Andrea Furtado.\n\nWe found in the first carrack the following goods, viz.:\n\n- 2,000 piculs of white powder-sugar and some baskets of sugar-candy;\n- 4,500 piculs of Tintenaga or Spelter (zinc);\n- 223 fardels of Chinese camphor;\n- 90 fardels Agelwood; (1)\n- 18 leaden boxes of musk-balls;\n- 11 boxes of vermilion;\n- 22 boxes of Chinese fans;\n- 209 fardels of raw silk, and 75 fardels bad yellow silk;\n- 6,000 pieces of variegated porcelain;\n- 10 casks of coarse and fine porcelain;\n\n(1) \"K\u00e2yu gaharu.\"\nsome gilt couches and knick-knacks, one lot radix China, (1) one lot benzoin, 150 baskets with prepared silk, velvet, damask, taffeta and fine silk, besides some boxes with gold-wire.\n\nIn the second carrack we found:\u2014\n\n174\u00bd piculs of Agelwood;\n33\u00bd piculs of Benzoin; (2)\n2 small casks with Chinese camphor, and some common sarongs.\n\nThe Wissingen had captured another small Portuguese ship off Solor, laden with ninety-two bharas Sandal-wood and 2\u00bd pikuls of tortoise-shell.\n\nThe Wissingen sailed on the 15th September with the captured carrack St. Anthony from Patani to Djohor to try and get a cargo at that place. Wybrand van Warwyck followed on the 27th October, and dropped anchor on the 12th November in the mouth of the Djohor river near the said carrack at about 1\u00bd miles from the Wissingen. The vessels Amsterdam and Dordrecht were under his command. Admiral Cornelis Sebastiaanse's squadron was also lying in the roads here.\n\nThe King called in the aid of both these Admirals, which Sebastiaanse pledged himself to give, whilst van Warwyck begged to excuse him for this time.\n\nThe letters, addressed by H. H. Prince Maurice to the King, were then presented to him, which he received with much respect. Admiral Cornelis Sebastiaanse presented him at the time with two brass guns, and van Warwyck gave him four small barrels of gunpowder, 40 shot-cartridges for the said cannon, 12 Japanese swords, four Portuguese muskets with shoulder-belts, some pieces of prepared silk and a shot-proof armour.\n\nThe two Admirals presented the King at his request with two small wide-mouthed guns cannon-royal, and some shot-\n\n(1) \"Jin seng,\" or \"Jinsam,\" as it is also called, supposed to very invigorating. It is stated that it is only found near the mountains, a man shoots an arrow, and if it falls where the \"jin seng\" is to be found, a flame appears, which guides him to the spot.\n\n(2) \"Kem\u00e9nyan,\" burnt by Malays and aborigines in most of their charms and spells.\ncartridges for the same, from the vessel Dordrecht and with an iron pedrero (small field piece) and ten small barrels of gunpowder and some shot-cartridges from one of Warwick's vessels, in order that he should be better able to repel the assaults of the Portuguese.\n\nAdmiral van Warwick left Djohor on the 10th December with his vessel the Wissingen, after having strongly recommended the King to take good care of his people, who were left behind with a valuable cargo, and the Admiral Sebastiaanse soon followed him with his vessel the Amsterdam and the carrack St. Anthony.\n\nAt the beginning of January, 1603, our Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge having met with Admiral Steven van der Hagen off the island of Mauritius, and having heard from him in what state Malakka was, set sail with his fleet to that town, but Don Andrea Furtado had fortified it considerably during the last three years, and besieged Djohor with an army of 8,000 men. The said Admiral sailed for Malakka on the 27th January and dropped anchor on the 30th April at half a mile distance from the town. (1)\n\nHe at once manned all his boats and sloops and ordered them to set fire to four ships, just aground opposite the town. These were ships of 200, 100, and 80 lasts each. Though the garrison fired five shots, they all missed the boats.\n\nThe same night Matelief informed the King of his arrival.\n\nThe day before, our sloops having captured three prahus of the King of Quedah, loaded with sarongs, the Admiral sent them back to that King and assured him, that he wished to live in peace with him.\n\nThe Admiral then assembled a Council of war, and the Council of all the shipmasters and merchants, and they resolved to approach as near Malakka as five fathoms of water (1) would bring them, and to bombard the town from the fleet.\n\nThe vessels neared the coast with neap tide to a depth of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms of water, (1) but even at that distance their small cannons-royal were of no use; though a few balls did hit some of the houses, they could not reach the fortress.\n\n(1) There is something wrong about the distances and cannon range here, perhaps \"league\" should be read for \"mile?\"\nThe artillery of the town answered our fire; but the Witte Leeuw (White Lion), was the only vessel once hit, whilst the most effective shot from our side, was the one, that hit the St. Paulus Church, so-named by the Dutch; Albuquerque dedicated it to \"Our Lady of the Annunciation,\" belonging to the order of the Jesuits.\n\nMatelief in the meantime ordered four boats to survey the North side of the town, and to take soundings, for if possible he intended to land there and to take its suburb; but he had to abandon his plan, the soil being too muddy, the Portuguese having raised strong stockades there to defend their houses.\n\nHe had erected in the meantime a battery of 24 pounders at Ilha das Naos, (1) one of the islets near the town, and had equipped it also with two small cannons-royal, and intended to bombard the town from that place, it being much nearer than the nearest place where the vessels could anchor.\n\nOur Admiral having been informed in the meantime that it was almost impossible to make a descent on the south side of the town, intended to land on its north side, hence he garrisoned the said islet with some 30 men.\n\nWe then opened our fire from the battery of the 24 pounders in the afternoon of the 2nd May, and soon silenced the two batteries on the south side of the town.\n\nNow and then the artillery of the town fired at our vessels, but without any effect; they did not fire at the battery however. But when Matelief saw that all this firing to and fro was of no use, he deliberated with his Captains, whether it would be better to leave the town alone and go first to meet and give battle to the Portuguese fleet, or whether it would be more advisable to take the town first; after a mature deliberation he resolved to ask the opinion of the King of Djohor, chiefly because he wanted to make sure if the latter would help him and what his assistance would consist of.\n\nThey did not expect much from the aid of the King of Djohor, but they forwarded a message to him, and it was decided that they should wait for his answer, before acting in any way; the more that there was nothing known about the arrival of the Portuguese fleet.\n\n(1) P\u00falau J\u00e1wa, lying opposite St. Paul's Hill.\nMeanwhile the Portuguese had burnt down the southern suburb.\n\nMatelief ordered ten men of the crew of each vessel to Pulau Sapta, (1) a pretty big island about two miles from Malakka, to make ten gabions for each vessel, to be used when they should attack the town.\n\nMatelief was informed on the 4th May, that our fire had wounded some of the inhabitants of the town, and that the Portuguese fleet with the Viceroy and Archbishop on board was soon expected from Goa, first to come to the rescue of Malakka, and then to reconquer the Moluccas and to fight the King of Djohor; that the place had but very little victuals, but that there were many guns with a large supply of ammunition, that there were more than 3,000 slaves and Malays within the town, but not more than 80 Europeans.\n\nOn the 5th of May, two prahus of the King of Djohor, with the Sjahbandar of Singapura, Sri Raja Negara, (2) reached our fleet; they came to see if there were Dutch vessels in this neighbourhood, and they assured our Admiral, that it was certain that the King would come this way as soon as he knew of the Admiral\u2019s presence, so they would go back that very night.\n\nOn the 13th, the Admiral received a letter from the King of Djohor informing him that he should join him within four days, and that he should bring as many troops as he could assemble.\n\nAfter the receipt on the 14th of a letter of the same tenor, there appeared on the 17th some vessels with three hundred men under the command of the King\u2019s brother Radja Sabrang, he (the King) being absent.\n\nThe then reigning King of Djohor, called Jangdipertoehan, was the eldest of three brothers. He was a lazy and indolent prince, sleeping almost the whole day, getting drunk, and amusing himself with his women, whilst he left the business\n\n(1) Probably P\u00fblau \u00dapeh (which is somewhere about 2\u00bd miles from the town, but then, as may be seen by the rocks on its shore side, extending further towards the town), as they were going to attack on the North side.\n\n(2) Royal drum; or possibly connected with Sansk: nagara or nagari, country.\nof government to his brother, Radja Sabrang, or Radja Bongsoe, and to the high court dignitaries.\n\nHis other brother, the King of Siak, who had married a daughter of the King, or a sister of the Queen of Patani, was also a bad sovereign; he came very seldom to Djohor, but remained at Siak, which was a fief of Djohor.\n\nThe third brother, who, like the King of Siak, was also of another mother, was called Radja Laut; but the said three princes were not to be relied upon, owing to their fondness for drinking. Radja Sabrang was the only exception.\n\nHe then came to welcome the Admiral, and presented him a golden kris inlaid with some common diamonds.\n\nThey had a long talk together, and Matelief told him that it was his intention to take Malakka and to keep it for him, but Radja Bongsoe did not like that, and asked him, why he should assist him to besiege the town, if after all the Dutch would keep the place, for in that case it was only a change of neighbours, and that we did not assist him, but that he then assisted us.\n\nMatelief then asked him, what would be his reward if he took the town, whereupon Radja Sabrang promised him to give him a suitable place for building store-houses to put their goods and provisions in, which they were allowed to import duty free. But Matelief answered that his offer amounted to nothing, that many native princes had made him the same offer, though he had never rendered them any services; he also pointed out that the present town of Malakka did not belong to the King of Djohor, but that it was a town built by the Portuguese, and that only the surrounding country had at one time been the property of the King.\n\nFinally, he gave in about the town and agreed to leave Malakka in our possession, if Matelief would promise to make war upon Atsjien, which Matelief however refused to do, being at peace with that State; but he promised that, either he would assist the King of Djohor if Atsjien declared war against him, or he would do his best to appease the King of Atsjien.\n\nFinally, the following agreement was entered into on the 17th May, 1606, and signed by the different parties:\u2014\n1. Admiral Matelief promises to take Malakka from the Portuguese with the aid and assistance of Djohor, after which the town will remain in the power of the States-General (Holland), but the surrounding country will be under the King of Djohor, provided we shall be allowed to take of it as much as we may require to fortify the town;\n\n2. The States-General are allowed to cut timber in the territory of the King, to build ships, and to provide for all the other necessities of the town;\n\n3. All the vassals of the States-General are allowed to discharge their ships and to land their goods in the town without paying any duty;\n\n4. No other Dutch or European merchants may trade in the countries of the King, without first having obtained leave from our Governor at Malakka to do so, and they will be considered enemies if they trade without the said permission;\n\n5. His Majesty can re-people and govern the burnt down suburb, known under the name of Campo Clin, (\u00b9) without any interference of the States-General. His Majesty shall if possible take up his residence at that place and fortify it, whilst the States-General shall assist him to do so;\n\n6. All the guns and cannon which are found in the town after its conquest shall belong to the King, one part of which he is allowed to remove at once, whilst he must leave the other part for the defence of the town, until the States-General shall have provided it with other artillery;\n\n7. All the merchandize, money and any other goods that shall be found in the town are to be divided in two portions, one to go to the States-General, the other to the King;\n\n8. Any goods not belonging to vassals of the States-General must be landed in the said suburb [Campo Clin]; but the subjects of the States-General are allowed to purchase them there freely and to carry them from there to the town;\n\n9. Both parties promise to assist each other faithfully against the Portuguese and Spaniards, but not in the case of a war with another nationality, unless it be to stand upon the defensive only;\n\n(\u00b9) i.e., Kampong Kling.\n10. Neither of the two parties shall make peace with the King of Spain, without the consent of the other;\n11. If any subject of either party gives offence in matters of religion, the offender shall be brought up and punished by his own authorities;\n12. If any subject of one of the two parties has a claim in the way of debt upon a subject of the other party, the defendant shall be called before his own authorities;\n13. Both parties bind themselves to surrender deserters or runaway criminals.\n\nThe said treaty was sworn to and signed by both parties, by each of them according to the customs of his country.\n\nThe Admiral then delivered to Radja Sabrang a letter addressed to the King and coming from His Highness Prince Maurice, which letter was accompanied by the presents also sent to the King by the said Prince, which presents consisted of a long fusil, a double-barrelled pistol inlaid with mother-of-pearl, two other pistols, a sword of honour, and a halberd, besides those sent by the Directors of the East India Company, consisting of one fine harness, two halberds and six cuirasses.\n\nMr. Matelief thereupon landed on the 18th May, with 700 men, and falling in with a troop of 400 Portuguese and black soldiers armed with muskets and pikes, he immediately attacked them, and drove them back to the suburb.\n\nFinding a strong thick wall there (\u00b9) they at once threw up an entrenchment, from behind which they opened such a hot fire upon the enemy, that he had to abandon his position, which was set fire to by its own inhabitants.\n\nAfter having made a rapid personal examination of the town, Mr. Matelief found near it a pretty large river, (\u00b2) which to cross would be rather a hard task, seeing as he did so many strong turrets and such solid heavy walls round the town that it would have been very easy for the Portuguese to prevent him from taking the town; besides that he had not forces\n\n(\u00b9) Pintu Tranquerah?\n(\u00b2) The Malacca river, separating the fortress and main town from the suburbs.\nenough for the purpose, many of his soldiers being laid up already with sickness, and as for the assistance of the Malays, he did not feel inclined to rely too much upon it.\n\nIn the meantime he ordered his troops with the assistance of the Malays to construct a battery in the said suburb, and armed it with two 17 pounders, with which he intended to silence the fire of the enemy on that side of the town.\n\nBy this time Mr. Matelief had noticed, that whenever he had asked Radja Sabrang for the help of his men he indeed promised to send him people, but they never appeared; and concluding that there was something amiss between the King of Djohor and his brother, he became aware, that he was knocking at a deaf man's door, the more so that they had conceived a sentiment of jealousy against each other. Finally, becoming convinced that he could never take the town with the small number of troops under his command, he thought it advisable to raise the siege and re-embark his troops, especially when the Bandahara had told him plainly that the Malays intended to leave the whole business to us, under pretence that Ternate and Ambon had also been taken by us without the assistance of the natives.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of correcting an erroneous statement I made in foot-note (3) p. 59 of No. 13 of this Journal for June, 1884. The arms on the old gateway there mentioned are not Portuguese, though I was so informed by a Portuguese Consul, but Dutch after all, the Batavian Lion is clear.\n\nD. F. A. II.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nRapport \u00e0 M. le Ministre de l'Instruction Publique sur une Mission aux Iles Philippines et en Malaisie (1879-1881), par M. le Docteur J. MONTANO. Paris, HACHETTE, 1885.\n\nEvery contribution to the scientific literature of the Philippines is of value, for though these islands have been under European dominion for over 300 years, it is astonishing how much there is still to be learned about them. There is no complete work which embraces the whole subject of the geology, geography, and natural history of this group. One has to look for the botany in old Fray Blanco's work, or pursue it through the voluminous pages of A. de Candolle's Prodromus. A valuable illustrated work on the forest flora of the Philippines has been lately published at Manila by Se\u00f1or Vidal. But both works are incomplete. The geology of the island may be sought in the various papers supplied to the Boletino del Carte Geologico di Espana, a work now extending to many volumes. M. Jagor has given many valuable details in his Reisen in den Philippinen (Berlin 1873), a work which has been translated into Spanish, French, and English. There is also an Appendix by J. Roth on the geology of the islands. Baron Richtofen has published some observations on the nummulitic limestones of Binangonan. Finally, M. Vidal has published (Madrid, 1874) a Memoir on the mountains of the Philippines.\n\nIn the numerous works published by the monks about their missions, which are very voluminous, there are scattered notices of geology and natural history, which have more value than one would imagine from the imperfect state of scientific knowledge when they were written. In these may be found many interesting details of hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The history of the Dominican Mission in the Philippines is in\nsix volumes, while the works of the Augustinians and Jesuits are too numerous to specify.\n\nIn spite of all these, however, a good general work embracing all the departments of science is still a desideratum, for the material of which Dr. Montano's Report is a contribution which cannot be too highly praised. His opportunities for observation have been considerable. He visited in succession Luzon, Calamianes, Palawan, Balabac, Mindanao, and Panay, besides making long journeys inland, especially in the little known island of Mindanao. His qualifications for making the most of such opportunities appear to be of the highest order, and thus we have notices, necessarily brief it is true, in almost every department of science.\n\nThe Report is divided into five chapters, viz.:\u20141.\u2014Geology; 2.\u2014Meteorology; 3.\u2014Anthropology; 4.\u2014Pathology; 5.\u2014Dialects; 6.\u2014Political Geography, including Agriculture and Commerce. Zoology and Botany are to form the subjects of a subsequent work.\n\nOne would suppose, from the volcanic nature of these islands, that the geology would be somewhat uniform and that the author's notes would be confined to notices of volcanic products with investigations on the disturbances to which the group has been subjected. But sedimentary and fossiliferous rocks are not wanting in the islands. The formation ranges from the lower paleozoic to miocene, through, like all the eastern islands, mesozoic rocks appear to be wanting. The writer of this notice, when visiting the Calamianes group some few months back, was surprised to find the island of Coron and many other smaller islands entirely composed of precipitous limestone similar to what is found in Selangor and Perak in the Malay Peninsula. And what makes the resemblance still more striking is that immediately opposite, on the island of Culion, the rocks are paleozoic and ferruginous, decomposing into laterite just like what is found in the tin formations at Thaiper g. Limestone is also found in the north-west of Luzon, and also miocene rocks and broken fossils mostly of foraminifera. As a general rule, it may be said that the sedimentary rocks belong more to the southern islands. In Mindanao there are quartz veins with gold in slates, also tertiary rocks. There\nis also coal in the central and southern islands. Dr. Montano explored a good deal of the River Agusan in Mindanao. Between Bislig and Catel he found traces of an extensive upheaval of the coast line. Large banks of madreporic coral were raised above the level of the sea, extending in wide horizontal strata rounded by the waves which the north-east wind frequently dashes over them. The mineralogical notices in the Report are not very numerous, and the chapter concludes with a long account of earthquake phenomena. Of course, the great earthquake of 1880 is not passed over, but the author gives the account and diagrams of the Jesuit Padre Fauna, which have been already published. Dr. Montano's remarks and observations on seismology are very interesting.\n\nThe meteorological portion of this work is less satisfactory, inasmuch as the author did not reside long enough in Malaysia or the Philippines to enable him to form any conclusions from actual observation. He might, however, have obtained excellent material from the published reports in Singapore, just as he has availed himself of the published reports of the Jesuit Observatory at Manila. These are very complete, but the whole subject, including that of typhoons, to which Manila is so liable, is about to be treated of in a separate work by Padre Fauna, who, for many years, has been the Director of the Observatory of the Ateneo Municipal.\n\nThis Report is especially interesting in the department of ethnography, and much that is new will be found in it. The author gives a very full record of facts, which, as he has no theory of his own to support, appear to be entirely trustworthy. He describes the Negritos or aboriginal mountain tribes in a very full manner. They correspond to our Sakeis in Malaysia, and are quite distinct from the bulk of the native population throughout the island. They are divided into different tribes according to the mountains where they dwell. They have never been civilised in any way, and all attempts to reclaim them have failed. Even on Mariveles, close as these mountains are to the city of Manila, they are to be found, uncontrolled by the Spanish Government and occasionally killing a solitary Chinese or Tagal who strays into their mountain fastnesses.\nThe great portion of the natives or Indians who inhabit the lowlands of the islands belong to the tribes or races which are distinguished as Tagalocs, Bisayes or Vishayas, and Bicols. They are all branches from the Malay stock, with a somewhat marked approach to the Chinese type.\n\nThough I have said that Dr. Montano has no theory of his own to support, of course he has a system which he develops. He follows those who regard the people of Malaysia and all that portion of the great archipelago to the west of Flores, Ceram and Gilolo (the limit of the Papuan race) as belonging to three distinct races, viz.:\u2014the Negritos, the Indonesians, and the Malays. Dr. Montano limits the application of this system to the countries which he visited. As he saw very little of the Malay Peninsula, that portion of his work is incomplete.\n\nMaking every allowance for the changes and admixtures to which every race is subject, the author gives the following idea of the system. The islands are supposed to be divided into three zones. The Negritos, occupy the internal or mountain region to which they have been driven by the Indonesian invasion. The Indonesians occupy the central zone, where they have been driven in their turn by the Malay races, which almost exclusively occupy the external zone and are spread on all the coasts of the Indian Archipelago as far as Flores.\n\nSo far the idea is simple enough, but it soon becomes complicated, even when applied to the Philippine Islands alone. There we have the Negrito in the mountains, but in most of the islands there is not much trace of the Indonesian. We find ourselves in presence of a Malay race divided into three peoples, as we may call them, speaking three different languages, though all of undoubted Malay origin. There are the Bicols, the Tagalocs, and the Bisayes. These form the bulk of the population of the islands. The Negritos are rapidly disappearing and do not number in Luzon and Mindanao more than 500 souls. The Bicols are close on half-a-million; the Tagalocs about twelve hundred thousand; and the Bisayes two million and a half. Dr. Montano confines his observations to the Indonesians of Mindanao, and enumerates them as about fifty thousand.\n\nThe three great tribes of Malays already described are con-\nsidered as having a predominance of Chinese blood, and in the Gulf of Davao (Mindanao) and Sulu he finds Malays with a mixture of Arab and Indonesian blood. These are called Moors by the Spaniards and are all Mohammedans. They number about ten thousand souls.\n\nThe author divides the Negritos of Luzon and Mindanao into:\u20141.\u2014Negritos; 2.\u2014Mamanua; 3.\u2014Negrito Mestizos. In Malacca he enumerates four tribes, namely:\u20141.\u2014Manthra, 2.\u2014Knabui, 3.\u2014Udai, and 4.\u2014Jakuns. Other Sakeis are not taken into account. Besides these, there are many Negritos in the other large islands of the Philippine group, such as Mindoro, Panay, &c., but of these Dr. Montano saw nothing.\n\nThere can be no doubt that there are three zones of races to be found in most of the larger islands of the Indian Archipelago. Nay more, we find the same or similar facts far beyond the limits ascribed to them by Dr. Montano. There are three zones of races very distinctly marked in Formosa, in Hainan probably, and there are even traces of the same in Japan. But when we come to analyze the constituents of these zones, the difficulty of classifying them under one head becomes manifest. In Borneo, for instance, the coast line is on the west, north and north-east overspread with Malays (Bajows), the central zone may roughly be said to be made up of the various tribes of Dusuns and Dyaks. But the Dusuns are of partly Chinese origin, and there does not seem to be anything in common between them and the Indonesians. In the centre we have wild mountain tribes, of which little is known, but yet sufficient to say that they are not Negritos.\n\nIn Formosa the Negritos of the mountains are a fierce savage tribe very like those of Luzon, but more treacherous. The central zone is a mixture of Chinese and possibly a Malay race, while the coast line is entirely Chinese. We have no traces of a distinct Indonesian population in the Malay Peninsula, but any person who pays much attention to the diversities of type amongst the Malays in the various States must see at once that some admixture of races must have taken place. Of course, the recent mestizos of Malay-Chinese and Indo-Malays are taken into account by Dr. Montano.\n\nThe portion of this work which is devoted to language will\nbe read with great interest by the student. The author states that all the dialects of the independent tribes which he visited belong to a family of languages which he calls Malayo-Polynesian. This result is the more important as it tends to throw some little light on the approximation which some have found between the Japanese language and the Polynesian. In Japanese, Malay words and a Malay structure are also slightly perceptible. What if the Polynesian races are the ultimate dispersion of a race which once spread over and peopled the east even as far as Japan? In the Philippines Dr. Montano takes Tagalog as the type, comprising under that group the Bicol and Bisaya dialects. They are almost as distinct from each other as they are from the Malay, but yet they are all of Malay origin beyond a doubt.\n\nThe author says that in all these languages or dialects there are no such things as parts of speech properly speaking. Theoretically all the words may be considered as roots and by themselves having no more than a vague sense. Their value as subject or object verb or quality is determined by affixes and suffixes less numerous in Malay than in the Tagalog dialects, where their use is extremely complicated. This renders the language difficult for Europeans. Yet most of the monks speak it fluently, and they have published so many and such excellent grammars and dictionaries of all the dialects that the study of them and the elucidation of their history is much facilitated. The Negritos have no language of their own, at least now in the Philippines. They speak a corrupted Tagalog. It is a pity that we know so little of the language of our Sakeis. Mr. J. E. de la Croix has published something on the subject (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, August and November, 1882), and we may hope that before long some of the officers of Government in the Malay Peninsula will take the matter up.\n\nDr. Montano gives very full vocabularies of Malay, Tagalog, Bisaya, Buled-Upih, Negrito, Samal, Manobo, Bagobo, Tagacalo, Bilan, and Atas. The last five are small tribes in Mindanao with very distinct dialects. Buled-Upih is the language of the natives on the Kinabatangan River in north-east Borneo. The orthography of the Malay given in this book is peculiar, and adds one more to the ways of rendering that language accessible\nto Europeans by odd combinations of letters. Dr. Montano's mode may be better than its predecessors, but at any rate it differs from them. At present no two books agree, and the student is fairly bewildered. Who will put an end to this confusion?\n\nConnected with the subject of ethnology, there are thirty beautifully executed phototypes by Quinsac. Their execution leaves nothing to be desired. There is also a plate representing microscopic sections of hair from various tribes. These sections show an oval, or sometimes a triangular and quadrangular outline, but never a cylindrical one.\n\nThe chapter on pathology is exceedingly interesting, containing as it does notices of all the various diseases amongst the natives which came under the author's notice. He also gives some well-considered observations on the effect of the climate upon Europeans. The subject, however, is too long to be dealt with here, and the same may be said on the chapters devoted to commerce and agriculture. This notice may be concluded by stating that Dr. Montano has contributed a most valuable addition to our knowledge of the Philippine Islands, which will hereafter be a standard work of reference on the subject. Scientific men will look forward anxiously to the portions especially devoted to zoology and botany. Even in this report there is a list of native names of plants with their corresponding botanical names and the orders to which they belong, amounting to 190 plants. A similar list is given by Vidal, which the writer of this notice has found most useful in travelling through the Philippines, but Montano's list contains tribal names which are not found elsewhere.\n\nJ. E. TENISON-WOODS.\n\n\"Work and Adventure in New Guinea, 1877 to 1885,\" by Rev. James Chalmers, and Rev. W. Wyatt Gill.\u2014The Religious Tract Society, 1885.\n\nJust a year has elapsed since Commodore Erskine proclaimed a British protectorate over a large portion of the southern shores of New Guinea extending from the limit of\nthe territory claimed by the Government of the Netherlands, about Longitude 141\u00b0 E., to East Cape including certain adjacent islands. A High Commissioner (Major-General Sir Peter Scratchley, R.E.) has been appointed, and may perhaps soon be heard of off the coast of the Protectorate. In the meantime the work of Messrs. Chalmers and Gill, which has been lately published, comes opportunely to afford the most recent information, from those best qualified to give it, of the territory in which Great Britain has acquired new interests and responsibilities, and of the manners and customs of the tribes inhabiting it.\n\nThe authors are missionaries of the London Missionary Society, but their book is no mere chronicle of mission work; it contains valuable ethnographical notes about comparatively unknown tribes, and records of exploration in new regions. The mission, which dates only from 1871, seems now to be firmly established; the head-quarters of the missionaries are at Port Moresby, while thirty-two native teachers, most of them South Sea Islanders, but some of them New Guinea converts, are stationed at various villages along the south-eastern coast of the great island between Motu-Motu and East Cape.\n\nThe only specimen of the language given consists of the names of the months (thirteen) and the numerals in the Motu dialect, which is used by the natives of Port Moresby. Other dialects are mentioned\u2014Roro, Hula, Koiari, &c.\u2014and the natives of different districts seem to be unintelligible to each other. At Teste Island several Polynesian words were recognised in the conversation of the natives with each other.\n\nThe people of Port Moresby speak of themselves as being of the same origin as the natives of the gulf of Papua. \"Two men sprung out of the earth\u2014Kerimaikuku and Kerimaikape\u2014but no woman; their only companion was a female dog. Anxious for children, a daughter and a son were born to them. When these were grown up they married, and children being born the inhabitants soon numbered fourteen. They then separated, two going right back to the mountains, and from them sprung the great Koiari tribe; two going not so far inland, and dwelling on the low lands and from them sprung the Koitapuans, a tribe of sorcerers; the remainder all going to Elema, where they remained many generations.\"\nThe only account that a mountain tribe in the interior of the Kabadi district could give of their faith was that their great spirit lived on the mountains and was called Oarova; he had a wife named Ooirova and they had a son called Kurorova.\n\nA native of Orokolo, a place at the head of the gulf of Papua, furnished the following particulars as to the beliefs of his tribe:\n\n\"The spirit Kanitu made two men and two women who came out of the earth. The name of the elder brother was Leleva and the younger Vovod; from them have sprung all mankind. This spirit lives in spirit-land on the mountains and when he visits a village he rests on the ridge of the temple. He is represented in the temple in wicker-work; there he is consulted and presents made to him.\"\n\nIn connection with this word Kanitu, or Kanidu, which by the way seems to have been adopted by the missionaries as a mode of translating the word God, it is noticeable that the word Sinitu, meaning a malevolent spirit, is found among certain Malayan tribes, e.g., the islanders of Mantawe off the West Coast of Sumatra. See Journl. Ind. Arch., IX, 287.\n\nAs is the case with all of the larger eastern islands, the interior of New Guinea seems to be inhabited by aboriginal tribes who have been driven back to the hills by a robuster race now occupying the coast districts. While the latter are described as being in places as fair as South Sea Islanders, the former are said to be black with woolly hair, beards and moustaches, and are all cannibals. The physique of the people is found to improve as one travels castward from Port Moresby, and Dufaure island is mentioned as the point of meeting of two races\u2014one from the Kerepunu side and the other from the east. Both would seem to differ considerably from the Papuans of the Gulf. At South Cape the people are small and puny and much darker than the Eastern Polynesians.\n\nThe houses of the natives are built on piles, and in many places villages are found composed entirely of houses built in this way in shallow water on the sea-shore, communication being maintained between them by horizontal poles supported on perpendicular ones. Mr. Gill describes these as \"Swiss-lake-like villages\" in allusion, of\ncourse, to discoveries of the remains of houses raised on piles in lacustrine sites in Switzerland and North Italy.\n\nWallace long ago stated that the view of an ancient lake-dwellers village, given as the frontispiece of Sir Charles Lyell's \"Antiquity of Man,\" is chiefly founded on a sketch of a New Guinea village, viz., Dorey in the North-west of the island.*\n\nThe custom of building on piles or bamboo posts at various heights above the ground is very general from the frontiers of Tibet to the islands of the South Sea, and is one of the many points which support the theory of an identity of origin between the Indo-Chinese races and the races of the Indian Archipelago.\u2020 Specimens of Malay villages on stilts standing in the sea may be viewed any day in New Harbour, Singapore.\n\nThe customs of the people as regards clothing are not such as to encourage a hope of finding a new market for English cotton goods in New Guinea! The married men and women are described as having very little dress; the young men and girls have a little more than their parents. Shell ornaments for the hair, shell necklaces, and nose-ornaments and armlets of the same material are much worn. So are tortoise-shell ear-rings. A grass petticoat is worn by women and is said to be identical with that formerly worn in the Ellice group, the grass being ornamented by alternate red and yellow strips of pandanus leaf; married women have their heads close shaven, while unmarried girls wear their hair \"in a complete frizle, four or five inches long and not parted.\" Young men wear a coloured band of native cloth round the stomach. It is made from the bark of the native mulberry, and is woven tightly on the body, the flesh bulging out above and below. It can be removed only by cutting it. The face is painted in stripes of black, white, red and yellow, and nasal ornaments, often nine inches long and curved, are inserted in the pierced septum. At Murray Island the old men, to conceal their grey hair, take to wigs, \"which represent them as having long, flowing, curly hair as in youth!\"\n\nTattooing is common. Women at Port Moresby are described by Mr. Gill as \"exquisitely tattooed,\" while at Hula,\n\n* Wallace's Malay Archipelago, II, 305.\n\u2020 Colonel Yule, Journ. Anthrop. Instit.\nfurther east, the tattooing is said to be \"simply perfect\" and to leave upon the mind the effect of clothing. \"Married women have a necklace or chain tattooed round the neck; each pattern has a distinct name. It is done to please the future husband, who has to pay liberally for it.\" At South Cape, says Mr. Chalmers, the women \"tattoo themselves all over their faces and bodies and make themselves look very ugly,\" shewing either an inferiority in art on the part of the South Cape people, or a diversity of taste between the two authors. Tattoo-marks on the chest and back of a chief indicate severally a life violently taken.\n\nWhen in mourning for a relative the body is blackened over and besmeared with ashes, and the chest and shoulders, and sometimes the entire person, are enveloped in fine net-work. A widow will sometimes remain in mourning for five years, during which period, it is said, she wears no ornaments and performs no ablutions. A mother in mourning for her daughter will wear round her neck all the ornaments once the property of the deceased, and along with them the jawbone taken from the unburied body. The latter incident must be looked upon, however, as a charm to avert the evil influence of the spirit of the deceased rather than any token of mourning, for in another place Mr. Chalmers describes one of his guides (at Stacy Island) as wearing, as an armlet, the jawbone of a man whom he had killed and eaten, \"while others strutted about with human bones dangling from their hair and about their necks.\" Similarly, it may be doubted if the \"immense necklace,\" seen by Mr. Gill, slung over the left shoulder of a woman (consisting of the vertebrae of her deceased brother), was really worn \"as a mark of affection,\" and the five widows of one husband who carried about, each of them, a portion of his remains, the eldest carrying the skull in a basket, were probably guided by some superstition which the European observer did not fathom.\n\nCannibalism, though not universal, is general. The Stacy Islanders boasted of having killed and eaten ten of their enemies from the mainland, and the house of the chief was hung with the skulls of the enemies eaten by himself and his people. Among these people a cannibal feast, to which\nMr. Chalmers was invited, was held and \"some of our friends appeared with pieces of human flesh dangling from their necks and arms.\" The black tribes of the interior have the reputation of being cannibals, and those with whom the Port Moresby natives trade are said to laugh at the latter for not eating such delicate food as human flesh. Instances are given too of cannibalism on the part of natives of the Hayter and Heath Islands, of Teste Island and of South Cape. At the last-named place a friendly chief presented to Mrs. Chalmers a human breast, \"a highly prized and delicate bit.\" It is not astonishing, therefore, that her husband records that after this he ceased to gratify the natives in this part of New Guinea with exhibitions of his chest, though the free inspection of the feet, boots, arms, and chest of an European seems to peculiarly delight them. \"All shout with delight, and every new arrival must have a look.\"\n\nThe gods of the natives of the south-east of New Guinea are Kaevakuku, Semese, and Tauparau, the first being a female and the others male spirits. The district of Elema is supposed to be the place of residence of these gods, and here, as well as at other places along the coast, there are temples containing idols where dances and feasts are held. No females or youths may approach the temples. Singing enters largely into the worship of these people, which would seem to be rather dictated by the fear of evil spirits than belief in beneficent ones. \"The centre post in every house is sacred to Kaevakuku and her portion of food in every feast is first offered there. The first fruits belong to her. All planting is useless unless blessed by the gods. The sun belongs to Kaevakuku. Rain, lightning and thunder to Semese and Tauparau.\" ......... \"Kaevakuku is represented by a large frame of wicker-work. Semese and Tauparau are made from blocks of wood and stand outside of some temples, and against all the posts running down the centre.\" During a thunderstorm the natives beat drums and shout in order to drive away the storm-spirits.\n\n\"Spiritists,\" as Mr. Chalmers calls them, who profess to make revelations by the aid of spirits who speak through\nthem, after the manner of the Bornco manang and the Malay pawang, are much believed in and feared, and, like the latter, adopt a feigned voice and use much singing and chanting in their incantations. They have the reputation of being expert poisoners, and wars are undertaken and murders committed on their representations. It is no wonder that the sorcerer \"gets the best of everything\u2014best pig, best food, best tomahawk, best shells.\" There are sorceresses also. So, among the islanders of Buru, the \"Swangi,\" who has a familiar spirit at his command and is able to cause sickness or disaster, receives presents, not only from those anxious to retain his goodwill, but also from those who wish to use his power to the injury of an enemy.*\n\nOf social customs, or ceremonies at births and marriages, there is no account. It would appear to be the custom for the husband to purchase his wife, one chief having stated to Mr. Chalmers that he had paid \"an enormous sum\" for his consort, viz., ten arm shells, three pearl shells, two strings of dogs teeth, several hundreds of cocoa-nuts, a large quantity of yams, and two pigs. But in another district (up the William River) a man pays nothing on marriage for a girl, but has to pay heavily if the object of his choice be a widow!\n\nAccounts of burial customs vary according to the different localities and tribes visited. Of the natives of Suau, or South Cape, Mr. Gill says: \"All the members of a family at death occupy the same grave (above which a small house is erected), the earth that thinly covered the last occupant being scooped out to admit the new-comer. These graves are shallow; the dead being buried in a sitting posture, hands folded. The earth is thrown in up to the mouth only. An earthen pot covers the head. After a time the pot is taken off, the perfect skull removed and cleansed\u2014eventually to be hung up in a basket or net inside the dwelling of the deceased over the fire to blacken in the smoke.\n\n* Forbes, Eastern Archipelago, 404 (Buru), 338 (Timor).\nAmong the Koiari tribe the bodies of the dead are not buried, but are dried and preserved in the following manner:\u2014\n\n\"A fire is kept burning day and night at the head and feet for months. The entire skin is removed by means of the thumb and forefinger and the juices plastered all over the face and body of the operator (parent, husband, or wife of the deceased). The fire gradually desiccates the flesh, so that little more than the skeleton is left. Their next anxiety is to discover by whose sorceries he or she has died. The mode of proceeding is as follows: the wise man of the tribe places on the body as many bits of dried grass as there are known villages round about, each bit being placed in the correct relative position. The incantation begins; at length a fly or some other insect alights on one of these straws, probably attracted by the smell. It is now evident to the wise man that an inhabitant of the village indicated by the straw occasioned the death of their friend by sorcery, for has not the god spoken? That same night revenge must be obtained! The desiccated body is well wrapped up and fixed in a lofty tree. The ashes of the two fires are rubbed over the faces of the relatives and other watchers, a grand feast and dancing concluding the whole.\" The resemblance of some of these incidents to the customs of the islanders of Buru and Timor and of the Australian aborigines is worthy of remark. Forbes has noticed that the Timorese, like the Australians, cannot understand why any one should die unless he be killed and seek, after a death, the person whose malevolent influence has caused it.\u2020 The same people suspend dead bodies, folded at the thighs and wrapped in mats, in lofty trees.\u2021\n\nIn districts where burial is practised (e.g., Port Moresby) a stake is planted beside the grave to which are tied the spear, club, bow and arrow of the deceased, (if a man),\n\n* Mr. Gill points out that D'Albertis in his work on New Guinea [vol. ii, pp. 133, 134], has furnished evidence of a similar practice obtaining among the natives of the Fly River, 500 miles further west.\n\n\u2020 Eastern Archipelago, 404, 438.\n\n\u2021 Id., p. 434.\nbroken to prevent theft: at the grave of a woman her cooking utensils, grass petticoats, &c., are similarly suspended. This is the *baiya* of the Dayaks of Borneo* and agrees, as Mr. Gill points out, with customs which prevail generally among the Polynesians. At a funeral which he witnessed, the widow sat at the head of the grave besmeared with ashes. A lament was sung by the assemblage to the accompaniment of drums which each man carried. The women scratched each others' faces and bosoms until they bled freely: \"then the hair of the dead was plucked and shaved off as charms; indescribable phallic scenes followed.\" It is the custom for relatives to watch by the graves of their deceased friends, and small huts are erected over or near the graves, in which they sleep at night.\n\nOf a tribe of mountaineers whom he visited, Mr. Chalmers says: \"the natives very seldom bury their dead, leaving the body in a house set apart for it, which they often visit. When a number of deaths take place, they leave the village and settle somewhere else not far off. There is one grave here, near to our house, on which a tobacco plant is growing, a bamboo pipe, the property of the deceased, alongside a few sticks on end with yams on top. When they do bury, the body is placed standing in the grave.\" A most cruel and unnatural custom, said to prevail in the district of Aroma, is that of burying alive decrepit parents and grandparents. A native teacher saw a man dig a grave for his aged grandmother. With his own strong arms he deposited her in it, despite her tears and feeble resistance. When remonstrated with, he replied: \"She cannot live. She is already as good as dead.\" He then filled up the grave and trod the earth down upon the living victim and went home.\n\nTaro, sago, cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, yams, plantains, and sugar-cane are produced abundantly. \"Sago is cooked with shell fish, boiled with bananas, roasted on stones, baked in the ashes, tied up in leaves, &c., &c.\" Pork and the meat of the wallaby are much valued as food by the natives, and iguanas are also eaten. The indigenous breed of fowls is inferior. Cucumbers are cultivated. A small oyster, described as \"capital eating\"\n\n* See No. 14 of this Journal, p. 291.\nis plentiful at Port Moresby. The South Sea Island kava (piper methysticum) grows wild. Among the products of one district are enumerated raspberries, strawberries, nutmegs, tobacco, capsicums and indigenous cotton.\n\nMr. Chalmers gives the native names of several species of wild animals, but as he did not see them, was unable to identify them. \"The Jakoni, Gomina and Agila are very large and fierce. The Papara and Gadana are small but fierce.\" In the existence of these Mr. Gill does not appear to believe, for he says that the wild pig (sus papuensis) is the largest and, excepting the dingo, almost the only true mammal in New Guinea, all the rest being marsupials. There are two species of wallaby in New Guinea and \"two species of the hitherto strictly Australian genus Echidna, or spiny ant-eater, have been discovered,\" (Tachyglossus Bruijnii and T. Laevissi). Both forms are oviparous. The Echidna produces a single egg at a birth, thus supplying, as Mr. Gill remarks, the connecting link between reptiles and mammalia.\n\nMr. Gill discusses the relative advantages of three places as the capital of British New Guinea. These are Hall Sound, Port Moresby, and Kerepunu. The first is near a vast extent of fertile land, but swamps make it unhealthy; the second is shut off by hills from the interior; and the third though giving access to a valuable district is so thickly inhabited that to obtain a site would be difficult. The advantages of a safe harbour tell in favour of Port Moresby, but probably the headquarters of the High Commissioner will be the deck of his steamer for some time to come. The density of the population and the attachment of the natives to their holdings will make colonisation in New Guinea a very different undertaking to that which lay before early settlers in Australia. At South Cape Mr. Gill was told that \"every acre of soil along this part of New Guinea has its owner. A native desirous of making a plantation on another person's land can do so by asking permission, or by a stipulated payment, but only for once.\" The cultivation of jute is mentioned as an industry likely to be valuable in the future, a specimen of New Guinea jute, submitted to \"a well-known Dundee firm,\" having been pronounced to be the finest jute in the world.\nThis book contains an account of the murder of four native teachers and the wives and children of two of them in 1881, and of the murder of Dr. James and Mr. Thorngreen, with allusions to other outrages. And it is not difficult to gather from Mr. Chalmers' unvarnished narrations of his various journeys that difficulties and dangers which he successfully surmounted might, in the case of one not gifted with equal coolness and courage, have given occasion for bloodshed, and consequently for permanent hostility with a revengeful people. His knowledge and influence will, no doubt, be most useful to those charged with the administration of the Protectorate, and it is to be hoped that he may, at some future time be able to give to the world fuller details about New Guinea than those contained in this unpretending volume, which has apparently been compiled in England, in his absence, from some of his journals and papers. Ill-digested as information communicated in this way must necessarily be, it is sufficient to enable the reader to admit, with the author of the introduction, that Mr. Chalmers has combined the qualities of missionary and explorer in a remarkable degree, and has added enormously to the stock of our geographical knowledge of New Guinea, and to our accurate acquaintance with the ways of thinking, the habits, superstitions, and mode of life of the various tribes of natives.\n\nW. E. M.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nEXPLORATION OF PAHANG.\n\nExtract from a letter from Mr. W. Cameron to H. E. the Acting Governor (the Hon'ble Cecil C. Smith, C.M.G.) dated 4th September, 1885.\n\nI have had a very successful expedition this time, and think it is the most complete and comprehensive piece of exploring I have done yet, as well as one likely to lead to practical results.\n\nI have discovered Pahang to be a much larger territory than even I imagined, and I always knew it to be larger than was generally supposed. It impinges right up to the Ulu of the Kinta and the Raia close into Perak just as it does at Ginting Bidei, and there is no intermediate nobody's land, except that this portion is totally unknown even to the Pahangites or to any Malays. There is in this place a sort of central hill country, a sort of vortex in the mountains, where for a wide area we have gentle slopes and pamah (plateau) land, with rounded hills shut in all round by loftier ranges but which from the mean elevation of this vortex appear comparatively low, but the mean of the valley for many miles is 4,300 to 4,750 feet above sea level by aneroid. Streams of considerable size glide along easily from all around and go to feed one large stream eventually, and this is the Telom\u2014the real Ulu of the Jelei. I ascended one mountain at the N.E. corner\nof this central land and looked down on the N. E. side to the real Ulu (upper reaches) of the Kelantan, further east again behind a lofty range, Pahang, octopus-like, shoots out another arm to the north impinging on Kelantan. The mountain which I ascended was 6,300 feet by aneroid, probably considerably higher real altitude, and stands in somewhere about $4^\\circ 38'$ North Latitude 10 degrees north of east. Of this a lofty mountain range rises closing in the vortex (to continue the simile) to the East (the vortex being the Telom). This lofty range I estimated to be over 8,000 feet, perhaps considerably more. I dared not ascend it, for, not knowing what stream or system of streams I was on, I was obliged to hold on to the watershed till it brought me right into Pahang known. I had no one who could give me any information, and the Sakeis all fled before us, so that I had to be my own guide, and thus, as I say, was tied to this watershed till I could make sure what it was, as I felt certain it would settle the question of the central watershed about which there have been various conjectures, and it has solved the question, at least up to this point and a good way north of it.\n\nWe had rather a trying time of it, owing to the fearful rains. Colds, fevers and rheumatism were our constant companions, and my men suffered very much.\n\nI hope that I may have an opportunity of placing some of the results of this expedition more fully before you, and thanking you for your kind wishes.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWILLIAM CAMERON.\n\nP.S.\u2014I was fortunate enough to obtain particularly interesting geological data, of which I have brought many specimens and made copious notes. I should have stated generally that my route was up the Raia which I explored, the Ulu\n(upper reaches) being unknown, as well as the Penoh which is an anak (tributary) of the Kinta. I crossed a mountain by a pass 5,300 feet by aneroid lying exactly at the Ulu of the Kinta, Penoh and Telom. This I have called Gunho Pass. I took the elephants over with me, explored this new country and followed the Telom till I got to within a day's sail of the place where it joins the Jelei. Long ere this all our stores but rice had been exhausted, so for the purpose of obtaining supplies, and also because a rumour had got abroad in Pahang that I was a musoh (enemy) with forty elephants and four hundred men come down to harry and to raid, I had to reassure the authorities: I went down to the Toh Kaya's and to Penjum by sampan, then back again and then crossed southerly all the rivers of Upper Pahang, keeping close to the foot of the main ranges, and coming out over mountains 5,000 feet high at the Ulu of a tributary of the Slim, and thence on to Bernam.\n\nI have reason to thank the Great Master that I was enabled under his protection to bring my men back alive, although I cannot say well, for I on several occasions had great reason to be alarmed and feared some would succumb; there are several of them now under treatment, and one I left in the hospital at Penang.\n\nThe elephants, I am happy to say, notwithstanding the unprecedented fatigue, are well and in fair condition. By this time they will be pretty strong, for I left them at the Ulu of Sungkei to feed and rest eight days ago, and they will soon be in good condition. I am starting the relief party back again today by way of the Perak river and Batu Gajah and I propose taking a run down to Singapore for a day to get some outfit which cannot be procured here, when I shall do myself the honour of calling on you, but I must start my party first and I will meet them at the Bernam almost as soon as they can get there, as we are taking an additional elephant.\n\nW. C.\nSpecial Regulations for the Leasing of Uncultivated Lands in Lots of less than 100 acres in extent.\n\nThe following Proclamation appears in the Official Gazette, North Borneo, of October 1st, 1885:\n\nWhereas it is expedient to repeal that portion of the Proclamation of the 23rd day of December, 1881, by which the provisions of the Labuan Land Ordinance, numbered 2 of 1863, were adopted as Law in the Territory of British North Borneo, and to make other provision in lieu thereof.\n\n1. It is hereby enacted and proclaimed that the aforesaid portion of the proclamation of the 23rd day of December, 1881, by which the provisions of the Labuan Land Ordinance, numbered 2 of 1863, were adopted as Law in the Territory of British North Borneo, shall be and is hereby repealed from the date of the coming into operation of this Proclamation, save and except as touching rights which shall have accrued, liabilities which shall have been incurred, acts which shall have been done, and all proceedings on matters which shall have taken place before this Proclamation shall come into force.\n\n2. All Government Lands under 100 acres in extent within the said territory shall be distinguished into Town Lots, Suburban Lots, and Country Lots and be disposed of in leases for the term of 999 years, unless at the time of sale of any Lot or Lots, any shorter term of lease shall have been notified in the advertisements or conditions of sale with the approval of the Governor, or if any Lot or Lots shall be disposed of under Section 5 hereof, for such term as the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, shall think fit.\n\n3. Applications for lands shall be made to the Commissioner of Lands or to the duly appointed officer at out-stations, but no sale or transfer shall be valid unless approved under the hand of the Governor.\n4. Before proceeding to the disposal of any Lots within the Suburban Town or suburban boundaries, the limits of the said Lots shall be accurately defined and published.\n\n5. The said lands shall from time to time be disposed of by Mode of Sale. the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, by public auction, and it shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands to dispose of any land which shall have been once so exposed first instance. for sale without being sold, to applicants by private contract within four months from the date of such auction on terms sanctioned by the Governor.\n\n6. The Town Lots shall be subject to an annual quit-rent at the rate of one hundred and twenty dollars per acre, such quit-rents being redeemable at 15 years' purchase.\n\n7. Lands in the suburbs shall be disposed of in Lots of about one acre each, and in the country in Lots of less than 100 acres each. Such lands shall be subject to such annual quit-rent as shall be fixed by the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, from time to time, and publicly notified; the said quit-rents being redeemable at 15 years' purchase.\n\n8. It shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands to determine at the time of sale whether any or what credit shall be allowed to the Lessees of Lots, and to regulate the terms on which the whole or any portion of the purchase-money paid down shall be forfeited, but in no case shall less than one-tenth of the purchase-money be paid at the time of sale.\n\n9. The payment of the quit-rent, reckoning from the date of sale, shall in every case be made in advance to the end of the current year upon the execution of the lease or of the permit to occupy, and the succeeding payments shall be made on the 1st day of January in advance for each succeeding year, and any lands for which the quit-rents may be more than one year in arrear and unpaid shall revert and escheat to the Government, and all premia or other monies paid on account of such lands shall be forfeited.\n\n10. Country Lots which remain unoccupied and unimproved for three years from the date of the lease shall revert and escheat to the Government, and all premia, quit-rents, or other monies paid on account of all or any such Lots shall be forfeited.\n11. In the case of the Town Lots and Suburban Lots which shall remain unoccupied and unimproved for one year from the date of the lease, the Government shall have the option of re-entering upon and reselling the same at public auction paying to the original Lessee the whole or such portion of the premium obtained on resale as the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Government, shall think fit, not exceeding the amount of the premium originally paid to the Government for such Land, any excess being retained by the Government, but all premia, quit-rents or other monies paid on account of all or any such Lots shall be forfeited. In the case of Town Lots it is hereby enacted that any buildings erected thereon must be built in conformity with the Local Building Law for the time being in force.\n\n12. All Lots shall be surveyed and boundary stones or other land-marks be set up by the Government at the expense of the Lessees; and all boundary stones or land-marks shall be kept in repair by and at the expense of the Lessees, who, when called upon by the Commissioner of Lands, shall point out their boundaries. And no lease shall be executed or issued by the Commissioner of Lands until the whole of the premium, the quit-rent in advance for the year, and all expenses of survey, and the cost of such boundary stones or land-marks, and of setting up the same, and all fees for registration or transfer, and all expenses of conveyancing shall have been paid by the Lessees.\n\n13. Should the Lessees when duly called upon fail at any time to point out or define their boundaries, or should their definition be incorrect, it shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands, after one month's notice of his intention so to do has been served upon the Lessees, their Agents or Managers, or has been published in the Gazette, to survey and define the said boundaries, and to charge the Lessees with the cost of so doing not exceeding one dollar per linear chain of boundary, and to recover the same in the manner provided in section 22 of this Proclamation.\n\n14. Should it happen in case of Country Lots that immediate measurement of any land to be disposed of under the provisions of this Proclamation be found impracticable, it shall be lawful for the Governor to issue a Permit or written authority to clear and occupy such land subject to the conditions on which a regular grant would have been issued; which Permit shall specify the extent and describe as nearly as may be the relative positions of the land to which it relates; and after the measurement of the land\nso occupied, the Permit shall be called in and cancelled, and a regular grant issued in lieu thereof.\n\n15. It shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands, upon the application of the Lessee or other duly authorised person, to accept a surrender of any original grant of land, and to grant new leases for sub-divisions of the same, provided that all arrears of rent due under the original grant have been previously paid, and provided that in no case shall the quit-rent for any portion of a Lot so sub-divided be less than one dollar per annum.\n\n16. All coal, minerals, precious stones and mineral oil on, under and within the said lands are absolutely reserved to the Government or its Licensees, together with the right to enter upon the said lands and to search for, get and take away coal, minerals, precious stones and mineral oils in, on, or under the same, and to reserve such portions of land as may be necessary for examining or working any mines, or conveying away the products thereof, upon payment of reasonable compensation to the Licensees for surface damage to such land or any buildings thereon.\n\n17. It shall be lawful for the Governor to grant mining licenses on favourable terms to the Licensees of demised lands.\n\n18. The Government reserves the right to resume possession of such portions of land as may be necessary for public purposes, such as police, revenue and telegraph stations, roads, railways, tramways, canals, &c., upon payment of reasonable compensation for loss and damages actually sustained by the Lessee.\n\n19. The Government reserves the right at all times to take, or to authorise others to take, timber, stone, clay, sand and other road-making material for the construction and repair of neighbouring roads, bridges, &c., on payment of reasonable compensation for loss and damages actually sustained by the Lessee.\n\n20. The Government reserves all navigable streams, rivers and creeks and a belt of land 50 yards wide along the banks of the same, and also a similar belt of land from high water mark along the sea-shore; ample provision, free of rent, being made for landing places and other purposes, for the convenience of the neighbouring Licensees.\n\n21. The Government reserves all edible bird's nests and guano, and also the right at all times to enter on the demised land, and to take or authorise others to take such edible birds' nests or may subdivide original grants provided that all arrears of rent be first paid.\n\nThe right to work minerals reserved to the Government.\n\nMining licences may be granted by Governor.\n\nReserves for roads, &c.\n\nGovernment reserves for roads, &c.\n\nLand reserves.\n\nBird's nests and Guano reserved.\nand guano on payment of reasonable compensation for actual damage done to crops or roads of the Lessee.\n\nThe Lessee of any demised land shall be entitled to collect thereon all gums, gutta-percha, india-rubber, and other natural produce (save edible birds' nests and guano), paying any such Royalties in respect of the export of such produce as may for the time being be reserved to the Government, in pursuance of any regulations made or to be made by the Government. Provided that if at any time, the Lessee shall not exercise his right of collecting any kind of such produce, the Government may from time to time, serve on him a notice of its intention to collect such kind of produce, and if within a period of six months from the service of such notice the Lessee does not exercise his right, the Government or its Licensees, agents, or servants may, at any time within three months from the expiration of such period of six months, enter on any forests or uncleared or uncultivated parts of the demised land, and collect therefrom the produce referred to in the notice for the use or benefit of the Government, on payment of reasonable compensation for actual damage sustained by the Lessee.\n\n22. All arrears of payment due by any Lessee under the provisions of this Proclamation shall be recoverable by summary process in any Court of Law in the Territory of British North Borneo.\n\n23. The Regulations respecting the registration of Titles to land shall be such as shall be provided by the Law or Proclamation in force for the time being, but every Lessee shall deliver to the Commissioner of Lands a copy of every assignment or under-lease of his demised lands or any part thereof, and shall produce or cause to be produced to the Commissioner of Lands the original thereof, for the purpose of registration, and until such registration no such assignment or under-lease shall be valid.\n\n24. The fee chargeable for the registration under the provisions of this Proclamation upon the issue of a lease or a permit to occupy, is the sum of two dollars, and such registration shall be compulsory.\n\nThe expenses of survey and the cost of boundary stones or other land-marks, and the expenses of setting up boundary stones or other land-marks shall be such as shall be notified from time to time by the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, by public notification.\n25. Nothing in this Proclamation provided shall be taken to affect the special conditions under which Lots of one hundred acres and upwards in extent are leased in accordance with the Special Regulations approved by the Court of Directors of The British North Borneo Company on the 7th day of February, 1883, or such other Special Regulations as may hereafter be in the same manner approved by the said Court of Directors.\n\n26. All dealings in land between European and Chinese and other foreigners on the one hand, and the natives of the country on the other hand are hereby expressly forbidden, and no such dealings shall be valid or shall be recognised in any Court of Law unless such dealings shall have been entered into and concluded before the 16th day of January, 1883.\n\n27. A foreigner desirous of purchasing land from a native shall address his application to the Governor through the Commissioner of Lands, and the Governor, if he sees fit to sanction such purchase, shall, if the native owner consent, acquire the land on behalf of the Government, and shall fix the premium at which the same shall be leased by the Government to the applicant, and the land when so leased shall thenceforward be deemed to be alienated under the provisions of this Proclamation, and shall be subject to all the provisions thereof.\n\n28. This Proclamation may be cited as \"The Land Proclamation, 1885.\"\n\n29. In the Interpretation of this Proclamation the word \"Governor\" shall mean and include the Officer administering the Government of the Territory of the time being, and the words \"Commissioner of Lands\" shall mean and include the Officer in charge of the Land Office for the time being, or his duly appointed deputies, and in Section 11 the term \"unoccupied and unimproved\" shall, so far as regards Town Lots, mean Lots on which tenantable houses have not been erected and maintained.\n\nSandakan, 1st August, 1885.\nWith a race devoted to ancestral worship, as the Annamese are, funerals are necessarily a very solemn matter, conducted with a minute regard for traditional rites, imperative for the future welfare of the deceased. The first thing to be done is to assure one's self that the person is really dead. A film of cotton is suspended before the nostrils by a silken thread, so that the faintest breath would make it move. Death being verified, the face is covered with three sheets of paper, and over these is placed a red cloth, of silk or cotton, according to the family's wealth. One of the commonest forms of abuse in the country is to pray that your enemy may have no one at his death to perform this service for him. The object is of course to prevent evil spirits from entering and carrying off the dead man's spirit. For the same reason a constant guard is kept by the body, to prevent a cat from passing over it. Cats are particularly hateful to disembodied spirits.\n\nThree grains of rice are then put into the corpse's mouth, and if any teeth have been lost they are replaced. The old are particularly careful to preserve whatever teeth may drop out, for this purpose, and lock them up with their most valued treasures. There is a special reason for this care. Teeth are often employed for making medicines, and the sorcerers who wander about the country always have a number in their wallets, and are not at all scrupulous about how they increase the store. Instead of the three grains of rice, wealthy families sometimes put one or more precious stones in the mouth. The resemblance to the Greek obolos to pay the Stygian ferry need not be urged.\n\nThe body is then laid out, washed with water in which flowers or fragrant leaves have been boiled, the hair combed and done up in a chignon, and a black turban wound round the head. The deceased's finest clothes, very often specially prepared years before for this purpose, are put on, and he is decorated with the tokens of whatever rank he may have held. The finger nails are cut and placed in a little packet by the side of the head. If they grew into the flesh it would bring\ndisaster to the family. The corpse is then tightly bound up in cotton cerecloths, the every-day clothes being put between the limbs. Then it is ready to be put into the coffin, and care must be taken to turn the head towards the door. The shell is then closed and varnished all over to prevent the attacks of insects, particularly white ants. The varnish is black, and the best comes from Cambojan marsh lands.\n\nIn the meantime the women have been making up the mourning garments. They must be white and of linen or cotton. The nearer the relation, the coarser the material must be, and in no case are they hemmed. The Annamese Code devotes thirty pages (in Philastre's French edition) to a description of the different classes of mourning garments. It is evident, therefore, that quite enough has been said here about the matter. As soon as the mourning suits are ready the family assembles and solemnly puts them on. Then sacrifices are made to the ancestors and to the deceased, and each of the celebrants prostrates himself four times before the coffin.\n\nAccording to common Oriental custom it is usual to keep the coffin in the house for days and even weeks before burial. By its side is erected a small altar, on which are placed three cups of tea, different condiments, an incense brazier and two candles. The delay is of course to permit the assemblage of all the friends of the house, and the arrangement of one of those gorgeous funeral ceremonies which so often ruin families in the East. There is much mummery on such occasions in England, but the garish parade at a \"first-class funeral\" in Annam far exceeds any foolery we indulge in. Most of the properties are supplied by professional undertakers, and for details about them the curious may refer to the Annamese Code. Suffice it to say that there are huge lanterns of different shapes, pendant gongs to drive away evil spirits, incense tables, the red and gold painted and highly-carved bier, offering tables and a variety of banners in silk and cloth, some of them peculiar to the family, others common to ordinary, vulgar humanity, such as the fillet borne on two poles, which is inscribed Trung-tin (faithful) for a man, and Trinh-thuan (pure and obedient) for a woman.\n\nThe time for the interment is of course fixed by the wise\nmen, who select a lucky day and hour; at the head march men with wands to scare off prowling devils. Then in the midst of some of the objects mentioned above comes the \"dead man's house,\" a sort of bamboo cage. The children and the nearest relations follow the bier. In passing the threshold of the door the coffin has been carried over their prostrate bodies. In the middle march a body of monks chanting a noisy but rhythmical requiem. Sham gold and silver leaf is scattered all along the road to soothe the Co-hon\u2014the abandoned spirits. These are the souls of people who have died violent deaths, and have had no rites of sepulture. Their relations have not known of their fate, and have been unable or unwilling to perform the ceremonies which custom prescribes for the delivery of their souls. Therefore the Co-hon remain wanderers on the face of the earth, irritated with the living, and tormenting and oppressing them in every way. They trouble the sacrifices, upset the prognostics, and annihilate the efforts of domestic piety. The superstitious, therefore, are driven to all sorts of devices to appease and deceive these evil-minded demons. The Co-hon are attracted by the glitter of the false gold and silver leaf, halt to lay hands on it, and, before they discover the deception, have lost the opportunity of spoiling the funeral ceremony. There are others, however, who are more considerate, or more fearful of the wrath of these homeless spirits. They burn regular Nhut-nhut-dong-dong\u2014\"numerous pieces of money.\" These are strips of paper with coins printed on them, regular postal orders on the lower world for the support of indigent devils. Naturally the funerals so protected are the safer for the deceased.\n\nThere are no public cemeteries in Annam. The grave is usually dug anywhere out in the middle of the fields belonging to the family. The rich usually have a special place for their own relations, and sometimes assign a patch for their poorer neighbours. Otherwise these must be buried by the roadside or in some part of the village common lands. At the grave the coffin is lowered in, a banneret of silk or paper giving in white and yellow characters deceased's name, age, dignities, position in family, and virtues, is thrown upon it, and then a small pile of the above-mentioned money paper. Each friend\nthrows in a handful of earth. The sextons fill it up and make a circular mound above. Offerings and prostrations are made before the completed grave, and then there is a general consumption of rice, wine, and betel-nut.\n\nThe period of mourning is very protracted. Nominally it lasts for three years for father or mother, but immemorial custom decrees that this means twenty-four months. For a grandparent or brother or sister it lasts one year, and so on in decreasing ratio. Men of rank cannot undertake public duties during this season, and ought not to be present at marriages or feasts of any kind. The son should eat no meat and drink no wine. The people are very proud of these regulations, but they do not keep them. At the end of the first year there are great sacrifices before the grave, at the end of the second the \"dead man's house,\" the bamboo cage, is burnt, and with it the mourning garments. Desecration of the grave is punished with extreme severity.\n\nThe richer people erect stone monuments over their ancestors. The plain between Saigon and Cholon, the Pluine des Tombeaux, is full of these, of all sizes and in all states of decay, sometimes standing quite alone, sometimes with shrubs and then trees planted by them. There are inscriptions on most of them, usually cut into the stone and painted various colours. They bear the family and individual name and those of the deceased's titles and place of birth, the date of death, and the name of the person who set up the stone. Some of them are almost miniature temples. They are kept up by the head of the house, and there are regularly fixed days for worship before them.\n\nThis is in fact the only worship the Annamese have, but some of them carry it on with tolerable regularity. The first and the fifteenth of every month are the regular days set apart for worship at the ancestral shrine. At the same time there is always more or less sacrificing to the Co-non already spoken of. Nothing is deemed too great to soften their rancour. Besides the silver and gold paper and the \"cash notes\" above alluded to, there is a much more valuable paper currency. These are sheets of paper covered all over with designs and\nwritten characters; at the top there is a bell with a tongue to it to attract the Co-hon. On either side are invocations to the Buddhas, the good genii, and the priests, preceded occasionally by the well-known formula Nam-mo A-di-da Phat.\n\nBelow are representations of fine clothes, different domestic utensils, embroidered robes with Phoc inscribed on them, mandarins' boots, strings of different kinds of money with Thai-Binh (eternal peace) on them, and a variety of other combinations\u2014everything, in fact, that an indigent devil could require. The invocations at the top vary. In some of them they run, \"Oh, all ye Phat (Buddhas) who live for aye in the ten places. List, ye spirits, all-powerful.\" Or again, \"Hearken, all ye saints, all-blessed, all-powerful, ye who are like unto fire pure and undefiled, grant, in your mercy, to forsaken spirits who have suffered from the three evils, entrance into the divine abode.\"\n\nOn the first and fifteenth of the month such papers of supplies, pecuniary and personal, are burnt not only at the ancestral altars and on the threshold of the houses, but upon special altars erected in lonely places to the Co-hon. While the papers are burning, the head of the family prostrates himself, and afterwards scatters broadcast on the roof of his cottage somewhat more substantial, but still scanty, offerings of rice and bananas. These are of course to prevent the Co-hon from coming inside, an occurrence which the most hospitable goodman would view with horror.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, more particularly of the seventh, there are almost universal offerings to these troublesome Co-hon. They are called Le Phat-Luong\u2014distributions of food.\n\nIt is curious to watch the people come out of their houses just after dark. The father of the house calls out, \"Spirit who hast a name, but no title; spirits who have titles but no human name; spirits of universal nature, crowd hither and eat my offering.\"\n\nThen he turns to the four points of the compass, one after the other, commencing with the west, throws towards each of them a handful of salt and rice mixed, and burns a little of\nthe spirit-money, saying, \"I call the laggard spirits; he who comes fastest will eat most. May ten become a hundred; may a hundred become a thousand; a thousand, ten thousand; ten thousand, a hundred thousand; a hundred thousand, a million; a million, a countless multitude.\" This is, it need hardly be explained, a desire to obtain the multiplication of his offering. The notion is of course borrowed from the Chinese with their regular sacrifices of Di\u00ean. A development of this, found in all parts of the world among uncivilised nations, is the exorcism of evil spirits which are supposed to enter into people and cause illnesses. The method of driving these out in Annam differs little from the process described by dozens of writers on nations in other parts of the earth. The sorcerer is called Thai-Phap, and he must on no account eat the flesh of buffaloes or dogs.\n\nAn analogous superstition is the ceremony of making offerings once every year to the former holders of the soil. No country farmer would think of letting the first three months of the year pass without making offerings of a general kind to the old aboriginal cultivators. Sometimes, however, this is not enough. He loses his dogs and pigs and chickens, his rice gets drowned with too much water or dies of drought; he falls sick himself and sees visions of capering, bloodthirsty savages.\n\nThen he knows what is the matter, and goes straight off to a paper-goods manufacturer and orders a facsimile of his house to be built in paper. This is a most elaborate affair, reproducing not only a general model of the house, but of everything in it\u2014furniture, people, dogs, cats, and pigs, and even the lizards in the thatch. All the human beings, however, are represented twice over, so that the ghost to whom this model is to be given up may not have an exact model of the owner, or of his wife or children. These houses are very dear, costing sometimes as much as \u00a36, which is a large sum for a peasant farmer. If it is the commune that is making the offering, a model is made of the village shrine, the Dinh.\n\nOn the determined day, offerings of the usual kind are made, and the wizard, the Thai-Phap, falls into a trance, and is possessed by the deceased owner of the land. He blackens\nhis face on the bottom of a pot, eats ducks and chickens raw, and drinks wine by the bucketful. This is proof positive that the old savage owner is inside of him and is having a real good time. Then he is requested to make a formal cession of the land in question. If the farmer is a rich man the spirit does not yield for several days, if he is poor it is settled as soon as possible. A sum is fixed upon, a few hundred ligatures say, and this is promptly paid, in funeral money of course, which can be bought for a shilling or two. The possessed Thai-Phap signs for the departed savage, planting a thumb dipped in ink at the bottom of the written conveyance. Then the medium is restored from his mesmerised state, the paper house is burnt, and with it the sum of money formally agreed upon. It is usually also stipulated that a pig shall be sacrificed every three years or oftener for the better comfort of the old land-owner. After this it is hard if the farmer does not enjoy peace o' nights.\n\nThe household ancestry, as we have said, are worshipped more or less all the year round; but the especial great season for every one, rich and poor, is the new year, the Tet, the Annamese new year of course, which corresponds with the Chinese, and falls about the beginning of February. Then every one, down to the poorest, who at other times may not have the means or the leisure to pay proper attention to their forefathers, betakes himself to the last resting-place of his progenitors, and there is much burning of incense and funeral money, much scattering of rice and heaping up of fruit and flowers, during four days. The grass and other vegetable growths round about the tombs are carefully weeded away, and at the head of each a leaf of gold or silver is placed, and on this a stone to prevent it from being carried off by the wind. The belief is that, at a season such as the Tet, the evil spirits are particularly active and spiteful on account of the general rejoicing and feasting which they see going on upon earth. They are therefore exceptionally likely to do harm to ordinary, easy-going souls, such as those of the rude forefathers of the hamlet. But their cupidity thwarts them. They clutch at the glittering leaf placed at the grave-head, and, while they are doing so, the respectable spirit down below has time to scurry off to a place of safety. The Plaine des Tombeaux at\nSaigon presents an extraordinary appearance at this season of the year. Ordinarily it is as desolate, if not as big, as the similar place at Cairo; but during the four days of the T\u00eat both sides of the Tay-Ninh road are crowded with pious descendants from all parts of the country, come to secure the tranquillity of their ancestry.\u2014France and Tongking, by James G. Scott, 1885.\n\nThe scientific decoration of officier d'Acad\u00e9mie (les palmes acad\u00e9miques) has been conferred by the French Government upon Madame de la Croix, whose husband M. J. Errington de la Croix is a member of this Society and has done much useful scientific work in this part of the world.\n\nThe following extract is taken from the minutes of a meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Geographie, Paris, held on the 17th July, 1885:\n\n\"Le Pr\u00e9sident annonce ensuite la nomination de Mme.
